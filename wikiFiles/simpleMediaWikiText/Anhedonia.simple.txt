In psychology, anhedonia (< Greek αν- an-, without + ηδονή hēdonē, pleasure ) is not being able to feel pleasure. This may include not enjoying things like eating, exercise, watching movies, meeting friends, social activities, or sexual interaction and activity.
In most cases, anhedonia is caused by mental disorders. It happens in some severe cases of depression and it is a common symptom of schizophrenia and schizoid personality disorder.
