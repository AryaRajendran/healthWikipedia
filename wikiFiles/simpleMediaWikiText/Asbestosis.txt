 Asbestosis is a disease of the lungs caused by inhaling fibers of asbestos. It is not to be confused with mesothelioma, a cancer of the lungs which is also caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. Asbestosis has been the subject of many lawsuits, and many lawyers specialize in asbestosis and mesothelioma.
