Glaucoma is a disease that causes damage to the eye. If the person who has glaucoma does not get help from a doctor, they will not be able to see.
The disease happens because of damage to the nerve that connects the eye to the brain. Many times, if a person has high pressure in their eye, it will cause glaucoma.
Sometimes, it is hard for a person to know that they have glaucoma, because they lose their ability to see little by little.
When you lose sight from glaucoma, that ability to see cannot be gotten back.
There are two kinds of glaucoma, the kind that happens very fast, and the kind that happens slowly, over a long time.
Glaucoma is the second cause of blindness of the world.
Glaucoma happens much more for people with dark skin, whose family of long ago comes from Africa.and also can affect the cordon between the eye and the brain
