The Y chromosome is a chromosome that makes someone a boy or a girl. It is in most mammals, including humans. It contains the gene SRY, which triggers testis development, thus makes an animal male or female.
Females have two X chromosomes, males have one X and one Y. An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans.
