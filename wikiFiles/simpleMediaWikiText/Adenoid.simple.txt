Adenoids (also called pharyngeal tonsils, or nasopharyngeal tonsils) are tissues at the very back of the nose, in the roof of the nasopharynx, where the nose blends into the mouth.
Normally, in children, they make a soft mound in the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx, just above and behind the uvula.
Taking away adenoids with surgery is called adenoidectomy.
