There are 3 main categories in which amnesia can happen to a person.

Some other different types of Amnesia include:

Amnesia can be permanent, or it can be temporary. Damage to the brain, or the use of certain drugs can cause amnesia. Some of these drugs are sedatives. Another well known cause for amnesia can be drinking too much alcohol. Those kinds of causes are called organic, because they can been directly seen. Other causes cannot directly be seen, they are called functional.  Rather they are psychological in their nature. People may want to shield off a traumatic event they witnessed, for example.

Sometimes certain types of amnesia fix themselves without being treated. There are also different types of therapy that work with the brain to help with amnesia. There is no medicine that can directly help with amnesia.
