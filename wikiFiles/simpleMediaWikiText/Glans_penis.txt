 The glans penis (or just glans) is the sensitive tip of the penis. It is also called the "head" of the penis. Slang names include "helmet" and "bell end". When the penis is not erect, it is covered by the foreskin, except in men who have been circumcised. The opening of the urethra is at the tip of the glans. In children who have been circumcised and wear diapers, the opening of the penis has no protection. This can cause the urethra to get very narrow which can need surgery to reopen later. The epithelium of the glans penis is moist and washing it too much can dry the mucous membrane that covers the glans penis and cause dermatitis. The glans penis is a cap around the corpus spongiosum. It is attached to the Corpus cavernosum penis and at the tip of the glans is the urethra opening. The foreskin helps keeps the glans moist.<ref name="prakash%253E%257B%257Bcite%2520journal%2520%257C%2520last%2520%253D%2520Prakash%2520%257C%2520first%2520%253D%2520Satya%2520%257C%2520coauthors%2520%253D%2520Raghuram%2520Rao%252C%2520K%252E%2520Venkatesan%2520%2526amp%253B%2520S%252E%2520Ramakrishnan%2520%257C%2520year%2520%253D%25201982%2520%257C%2520month%2520%253D%2520July%2520%257C%2520title%2520%253D%2520Sub-Preputial%2520Wetness--Its%2520Nature%2520%257C%2520journal%2520%253D%2520Annals%2520Of%2520National%2520Medical%2520Science%2520%2528India%2529%2520%257C%2520volume%2520%253D%252018%2520%257C%2520issue%2520%253D%25203%2520%257C%2520pages%2520%253D%2520109%25E2%2580%2593112%2520%257C%2520url%2520%253Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww%252Ecirp%252Eorg%252Flibrary%252Fanatomy%252Fprakash%252F%257D%257D%2526lt%253B%252Fref%253E%2520In%2520males%2520who%2520have%2520been%2520circumcised%252C%2520the%2520glans%2520is%2520dry%252E%2526lt%253Bref%2520name%253D"szabo">
