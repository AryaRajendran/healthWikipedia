The pituitary gland is at the base of the brain between the eyes. It is an important part of the endocrine system. The gland is attached to the hypothalamus and gives out hormones. It controls a whole range of vital functions.
The pituitary gland consists of two parts: the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary. It is functionally linked to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk (also called the 'infundibulum'). 
The hypothalamus releases factors down the pituitary stalk to the pituitary gland where they stimulate the release of pituitary hormones. While the pituitary gland is known as the 'master' endocrine gland, both of the lobes are under the control of the hypothalamus.

The gland releases several kinds of hormones.

The anterior pituitary synthesizes and secretes the following important endocrine hormones: 

The two 'Gonadotropins';

and; 



Oxytocin is one of the few hormones to create a positive feedback loop. For example, uterine contractions stimulate the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary, which, in turn, increases uterine contractions. This positive feedback loop continues throughout birth labour.
