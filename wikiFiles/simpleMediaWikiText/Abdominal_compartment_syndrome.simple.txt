Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity (compartment) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within. This may be caused by internal bleeding, a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines, or 'ascites' which is when fluid accumulates in the the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and the abdominal organs (the stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder).
This increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand, stetching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs, which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them. This cause the organs to not function properly, and may cause organ failure.
An operation called a decompressive laporectomy may need to be performed. In a decompressive laporectomy an incision is made opening the abdominal cavity, and it is left open for a period of time to reduce the  pressure in the abdomen. 
Abdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories:
