 Chorea (sometimes called Choreia) is the name for a set of symptoms which characterise a number of neurological conditions. The term is derived from Greek, where it means dance; there is also a dance with the name. People with the disorder move involuntarily. The movements seem to progress from one muscle to the next. Chorea is one of the main features of Huntington's disease. Some forms of chorea are not linked to neurological conditions though: Chorea can develop as a complication of pregnancy, or be a sign of Hyperthyroidism. It can also result of drugs taken in the wrong dose; this is the case of L-Dopa (taken against Parkinson's disease), certain forms of hormonal contraception or certain Antipsychotics, amongst others.
