 Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine. A chiropractor is a doctor who went to school to learn chiropractic. A chiropractor may diagnose and treat many conditions relating to muscles, joints, and nerves of the body. He may give what is called an "adjustment" to the body. An adjustment is a fast short push to an area of the patient's spine or other joints to help their condition. A chiropractor does not use drugs to treat patients. They will look into using natural treatments such as nutrition, exercise, physical therapy, adjustments, and massage in order to help their patients. Chiropractic has changed since it was created over 100 years ago as new facts and research are learned by chiropractors. Today, chiropractors have many different ways to treat their patients. They all have one thing in common. This is to use drug free treatments. Chiropractic is most famous for helping people with spine pain, but chiropractors can also help other problems.
