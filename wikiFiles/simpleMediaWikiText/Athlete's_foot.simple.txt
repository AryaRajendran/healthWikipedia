Athlete's Foot is a condition where the foot is dry and cracked, which can be mildly painful. It was named athlete's foot because it was common in people who play sports or do exercise. The infection can be spread to other areas of the body, such as the armpits, knees and elbows.

Athlete's foot causes scaling, flaking, itching, blisters and cracked skin. It can be cured by using antibiotics.
