 Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology (cause) that can affect multiple organs, although the Lungs are the most frequent site of involvement. Corticosteroids such as Prednisone are often used to treat sarcoidosis. In some cases, the immuosuppressive drug methotrexate may be also used. Antimalirial drugs have also been used. It may involve the brain. If it does, it is referred to as Neurosarcoidosis. In some cases, pulmonary fibrosis is a complication of sarcoidosis.
