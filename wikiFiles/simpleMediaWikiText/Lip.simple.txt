The Lips are a body part around the mouth. There is a (usually larger) lower lip, and a smaller upper lip. They help us to eat, touch and speak.
Lips also show emotions.
There are diseases that can affect the lips, for example herpes simplex. Someone can get this disease by kissing or having oral sex.
