 <body><a href="Template:Infobox disease">Template:Infobox disease</a><strong>Dissociative identity disorder</strong> (<strong>DID</strong>), is a <a href="mental disorder">mental disorder</a>. It is listed in the mental health diagnosis manual known as the <a href="DSM IV">DSM IV</a>. It is sometimes known as <strong>multiple personality disorder (MPD)</strong>. It is one of the most controversial mental disorders because people disagree about what causes it. The main <a href="symptom">symptom</a>s of DID are a person having two or more "identities" or "personality states"; the person behaves differently depending which identity is in control. The second important symptom is when a person forgets important, personal things which people normally do not forget. The person is not diagnosed with DID if the symptoms are caused by <a href="drug">drug</a>s, <a href="illness">illness</a> or, with children, pretending to play with imaginary friends. Doctors must also rule out <a href="w:Factitious disorder">factitious disorder</a> (pretending to have DID for attention or sympathy) or <a href="w:Malingering">malingering</a> (pretending to have DID for another reason like avoiding prison).<h2>Definitions</h2>The DSM IV uses the terms "identity", "personality states" and "alternate identities" when talking about DID and other people use the term "alters" to mean the same thing. These words can be confusing since not everyone uses the same definition. Professionals have not agreed on a specific definition for a <a href="personality">personality</a>; other terms, including dissociation and <a href="amnesia">amnesia</a>, may also be defined differently by different professionals.Dissociation is a <a href="symptom">symptom</a>. Most people experience normal dissociation, where they stop paying attention to what is happening around them. People with DID have <a href="Pathology">pathological</a> dissociation, which is much more serious. It involves problems with memory and attention that make it hard for people to work, shop and have relationships with other people. Everyone can dissociate but some people can do it much more easily and to an extreme that can be unhealthy. Some doctors think <a href="trauma">trauma</a> causes the dissociation that is seen in disorders like DID.<h2> Signs and symptoms </h2>According to the DSM-IV, the symptoms of DID are "the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states" (which are often called "alters"), as well as forgetting things that people normally don't forget. Also, the symptoms cannot be caused by <a href="drug">drug</a>s or normal childhood play. People can report having a lot of alters, or just a couple. Most people diagnosed with DID have less than ten, though some have said they have several thousand.<h3>Diagnosis</h3>The DSM uses the following criteria to diagnose DID:<ul> <li> At least two "distinct identities" that alternate control of behavior</li> <li> Inability to recall "important personal information too great" to be attributed to "ordinary forgetfulness" </li> <li> None of the above are due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition</li></ul>The <a href="List of ICD-10 codes">International Classification of Diseases-10</a> (ICD-10) uses the term multiple personality disorder instead of dissociative identity disorder. It classifies DID in section F44.8, "Other dissociative [conversion] disorders".<h2> Causes </h2>There are two main ideas about what causes DID, but there is still disagreement about which is correct. The trauma model says that DID is caused by parents or family that abuse or neglect their children. Some of these children deny the abuse is happening or pretend it is happening to someone else, and this eventually becomes a different identity or alter. Most people diagnosed with DID say they remember being abused by their parents or other caregivers when they were children. When asked about their childhood, patients with DID are more likely to say they were abused or neglected than people with any other diagnosis. However, the idea that DID develops in childhood is disputed because childhood memories are not very reliable and it is not clear if the abuse actually happened. Though DID has been diagnosed in children, there are reasons to believe the diagnosis is because of the influence of parents and doctors rather than abuse. There is not enough good scientific evidence about DID in childhood to be sure DID is actually caused by abuse or something else.The iatrogenic or sociocognitive model (SCM) of DID says that it is created during <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a> when the therapist creates false memories and patients become convinced they have multiple personalities. Some patients may be more likely to develop DID in these circumstances because they are naturally more likely to accept their therapists are right about DID.A middle position says that trauma may change how the brain remembers things which makes it easier to remember things that did not actually happen.<h2>Treatment</h2>There is no treatment approach that has been scientifically proven to work. Most therapists who treat patients with DID use several different approaches. Therapy usually lasts for several years, and does not always work. Some therapists try to reduce or eliminate the alters so the patient only has one personality, while others do not.<h2>Prognosis</h2>Sometimes patients with DID will get better without any help, but this is not common. Patients with more diagnoses than just DID often take longer to improve.<h2>Epidemiology</h2>There have been no large-scale studies to learn how common DID is. The ISSTD says DID occurs in between 1 and 3% in the general population, and between 1 and 5% in groups of patients in hospitals. DID is more common in women than in men<h2>History and culture</h2><div class="thumbnail"><img src="Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde poster edit2.jpg" style="width:200px;" alt="""" />The book <em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em> was about someone with a "split personality", and later became a story people associated with DID.ref name = SinghTemplate:Cite journal </div>]]Before 1900 it was thought DID was caused by <a href="spirit">spirit</a>s or ghosts who controlled people's behavior.Even though DID is a very rare, there are a lot of books, plays and movies about people with DID.<h2>DID in the legal system</h2><a href="Lawyer">Lawyer</a>s and doctors who work with the <a href="law">law</a> also consider DID to be very controversial.<h2>References</h2><a href="Template:reflist">Template:reflist</a><a href="Template:Psychology">Template:Psychology</a></body>
