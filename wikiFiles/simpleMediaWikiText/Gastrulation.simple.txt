Gastrulation is a phase early in the development of most animal embryos. In it the embryo is dramatically restructured by cell migration.
Gastrulation varies in different phyla. It is followed by organogenesis, when individual organs develop within the newly formed germ layers.
The Gastrula is the double-walled stage of the embryo resulting from invagination of the blastula. During gastrulation, some of the cells migrating inward contribute to the mesoderm, an additional layer between the endoderm and the ectoderm.

Among animals, sponges show the simplest organization, having a single germ layer. Cnidaria and ctenophores show an increase in complexity, having two germ layers, the endoderm and ectoderm. All higher animals (from flatworms to humans) possess a mesoderm as well as ectoderm and endoderm.

The purpose of gastrulation is to position the 3 embryonic germ layers, the endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm. These layers later develop into certain bodily systems.
