Mastectomy is a surgery to remove the breast. They may remove one breast or both breasts. They may remove some of the breast, or all of it.
Mastectomy is often done for people with breast cancer. Both men and women can get this cancer. Both men and women can need a mastectomy. Some people with a high risk of breast cancer have the operation before the cancer starts.
If they find a tumor in the breast, they may only remove part of the breast around the tumor. Then the person might also take drugs (chemotherapy) to stop the cancer. They might also have a machine send energy (radiation) into the breast. Sometimes this can stop the cancer.
