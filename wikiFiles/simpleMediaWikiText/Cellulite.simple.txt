Cellulite is a dimpled appearance of the skin, caused by fat cells pushing against the body's connective tissue. The word "cellulite" only refers to how the skin looks, and does not describe a medical condition.
Cellulite is not related to cellulitis which is a spreading bacterial infection of the skin.

80-90% of women around the world are thought to have cellulite, and most doctors think that it is the "normal condition of many women".Cellulite is closely linked with female hormones such as estrogen, and rarely appears in men. Cellulite is most common on the upper legs (or thighs), buttocks and the abdomen. 

The appearance of cellulite has been linked to hormonal changes, changes in diet, stress, and poor blood circulation.

Cellulite has little to do with weight. Both slim people and overweight ones can have cellulite.

Cellulite is often hereditary, meaning that you get it from the genes passed on to you from your parents. This can mean many things because you can inherit your body type, shape, and hormonal function from your parents.

Normal hormone functions can cause or change the appearance of cellulite. Estrogen, prolactin, thyroid hormones, and stress hormones may all play a role. 

There are lots of treatments for cellulite reduction, but none have been proven by doctors to be effective.. Doctors have stated that "there is no outstanding treatment for cellulite" and that "realistically, there is no cure for cellulite."
