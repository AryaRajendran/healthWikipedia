Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (often shortened to NSAIDs) are drugs that have analgesic or fever-reducing properties, but that are not based on steroids. Higher doses of such drugs can also be used to fight inflammation. Such drugs are special as they are not narcotic, that is they don't induce sleep. Well-known examples of such drugs are aspirin, diclofenac and ibuprofen.
