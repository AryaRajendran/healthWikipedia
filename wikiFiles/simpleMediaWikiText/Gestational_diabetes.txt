 Gestational diabetes is a condition in which females who were not previously diagnosed as carrying diabetes exhibit higher than normal levels of blood glucose while pregnant. There are serious questions about whether this condition is natural in pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is caused when a pregnant woman's body does not secrete enough needed insulin during her pregnancy. Babies born to mothers having gestational diabetes are subject to problems, including being large for gestational age and lower than normal blood glucose. In addition, women with gestational diabetes are under increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes (or, in rare cases, Type 1 diabetes). In most cases, children belonging to mothers having gestational diabetes are under risk for obesity and diabetes later in life unless they eat right and follow strict exercise guidelines. Family history of having diabetes (regardless of type) and ethnic background are among risk factors for gestational diabetes.category:Female reproductive systemcategory:Health problems
