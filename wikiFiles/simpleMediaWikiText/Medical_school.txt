 A medical school is a place where medical students learn medicine. When they graduate from a medical school, they become a physician or a doctor. Medical Schools grant Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) and sometimes Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degrees. Students take classes in human biology and disease then take a license exam to practice medicine.
