Reactive attachment disorder is a severe condition which affects children and is represented by markedly disturbed or substandard ways of socially relating onto others. The problem may take the form of constant failure to initiate social interaction or too much response to relative strangers. Obvious symptoms for those affected include a failure to form normal attachment to primary caregivers. This may result because of abuse, sudden separation, trauma or neglect. The condition begins to affect children usually between three and 36 months past birth.
