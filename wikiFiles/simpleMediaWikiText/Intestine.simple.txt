The intestines of an animal are like a hollow tube so that food and bile from the stomach can reach the rectum. They also take any useful compounds from the digested food through small villi or tiny microvilli. These are very small, hair-like structures in the walls of the intestine. It is also called bowel and is part of the alimentary canal between the stomach and the anus.
