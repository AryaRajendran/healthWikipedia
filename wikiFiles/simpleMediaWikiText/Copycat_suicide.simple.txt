Copycat suicides are the emulations of another suicide that the attempting person knows of either through the personal knowledge, accounts of or the description for the original incident via television and from other other media. Spikes in copycat suicides are known as the Werther effect (i.e., well-known suicides serve as models for future suicides). Sudden incident spikes may spread through school systems, households or even nationwide-these are known as cluster suicides. The causes for copycat incidents include, although are not limited to, abuse of any kind, mental troubles, depression and death of friends or other family members.
