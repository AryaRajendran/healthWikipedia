A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in psychiatry, and treats people with mental illness. Psychiatrists can prescribe psychiatric medication.

In the United States, psychiatrists train by  going to university first, then they go to Medical School for 4 years. Then they must complete a residency. When they graduate, they get to use the initials M.D. (Medical Doctor) after their names.  Then these doctors specialize by training for 3 or 4 years in Psychiatry. In other countries psychiatrists train in similar ways but may not have to go to a separate university and medical school.
