Dehydration (hypohydration) means less water in something. The word comes from the ancient Greek word for water, hydor.
When people are dehydrated, they have lost so much water in their body that their bodies no longer work in the right way.  Dehydration is a very bad condition and if the problem is not fixed, then the person who is dehydrated can die since they do not have enough water in their bodies. 

Dehydration is most of the time caused by not drinking enough water while exercising a lot.  It can also be caused by diseases such as diarrhea and cholera and infections by bacteria that may harm the intestines.  Vomiting causes a person to lose a lot of water as well, and this can dehydrate a person.  If a person is in a desert area or any place where it is hot, then he or she sweats more and can get dehydration if he or she does not drink a lot of water.
