 Self-esteem is the way people think about themselves, and how worthwhile they feel. Psychologists use the word self-esteem to describe whether someone likes them self or not. Someone with high self-esteem might think that they are good at things and are worthwhile. Someone with low self-esteem might think that they are bad at things and worthless. Different psychologists have different ways of measuring self-esteem, and many people do not agree with what it means. Some people think that self-esteem is linked to depression, eating disorders and bullying. Some people may also injure themselves if they suffer from a low self-esteem. Self-esteem also considered by the international law on human rights, such as Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Yogyakarta Principles, and they affirm that each person's self-esteem must be protected against any kind of abuse or violence out of social prejudices and discriminations.
