A dietary supplement (or food supplement or nutritional supplement) can be a pill, powder, or a liquid form that helps enhance food that a person or animal may eat. The supplement can provide nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, or amino acids. People may want to take supplements because they may not have enough nutrients in their body or may want to get more healthier. Some countries define supplements as food. Others define them as drugs or natural health products.
Bodybuilding supplements are dietary supplements for those involved in bodybuilding and athletes. These supplements can help with weight gain or weight loss, or to improve their performance.
