David W. Oaks is the founder and executive director of MindFreedom International, based in Eugene, Oregon. The organization includes psychiatric survivors and dissident psychiatrists who reject what they say is the "domination" by the biomedical model that defines contemporary psychiatry. Oaks says that the psychiatric drugs that patients take have harmful side effects, and people can often recover without them.
David Oaks himself was institutionalized and forcibly medicated in the 1970s, while studying at Harvard University, for what was diagnosed as schizophrenia.  He recovered, he says, by rejecting drugs and getting support from family and friends. Oaks says he "maintains his mental health with exercise, diet, peer counseling and wilderness trips â€” strategies that are well outside the mainstream thinking of psychiatrists and many patients".
Oaks is on the board of directors for the United States International Council on Disability.
