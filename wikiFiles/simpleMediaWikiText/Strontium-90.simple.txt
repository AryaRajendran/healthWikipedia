Strontium 90 is a radioactive isotope of strontium. It has a half life of roughly 29 years. Strontium 90 and Strontium 89 have medical applications. They are used for radioation therapy,  in the treatment of certain bone cancers. Because its application generates a lot of heat it is sometimes used instead of Plutonium in nuclear power plants.
