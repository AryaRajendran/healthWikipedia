They are performed by paramedics, veterinarians, emergency physicians, and surgeons. Both surgical and percutaneous techniques are now widely used.
Tracheostomy was written about in ancient Egyptian tablets, but, in the 12th century, Ibn Zuhr described the first correct tracheotomy operation for people who were suffocating (could not breathe). The current tracheostomy was described in 1909 by Chevalier Jackson, an American doctor.
