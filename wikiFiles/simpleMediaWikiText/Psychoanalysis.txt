 Psychoanalysis is the type of treatment first developed and used by Sigmund Freud. It is a type of psychological treatment that tries to help people understand themselves better. It usually involves the patient meeting several times a week for several years with a trained doctor, called a psychoanalyst. The goal of the treatment is to help the patient know more about themselves, their thoughts and feelings. Most psychoanalysts believe that our thoughts and feelings are caused by what happens in childhood. They think our relationships with our parents are very important. Because these relationships are so important, they will most likely try to change how the patient sees other people, including the way they see the psychoanalyst. When the patient has strong thoughts or feelings towards the psychoanalyst, this is called transference. In psychoanalysis, the patient tries to say everything that comes to mind. This helps the doctor and patient to work together to understand the patient's thoughts and feelings. It is also important for the psychoanalyst to help the patient know how transference might change the way he or she thinks about the psychoanalyst. Over a long period of time, the patient should know his or her thoughts and feelings much better. The patient should also better know how to put these thoughts and feelings into words. They will also most likely have a better understanding of themselves and other people.
