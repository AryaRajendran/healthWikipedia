Ryan White (born March 17, 1988) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre currently with the Montreal Canadiens organization of the National Hockey League (NHL).

White spent four seasons, from 2004–05 to 2007–08, in the Western Hockey League with the Calgary Hitmen.  He was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the third round, 66th overall, in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. Following his WHL career, White was assigned to the Canadiens' minor league affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (AHL), where he recorded 29 points in 80 games as a rookie in 2008–09.  
White made his NHL debut in a call-up with the Montreal Canadiens on November 5, 2009 against the Boston Bruins, recording an assist. He was called up once again for a game against the Ottawa Senators the following month on December 8.  White played the entirety of the first period before being pulled from the game after the NHL noticed he was playing, despite the Canadiens not having properly reported his call-up to the league before the 5 p.m. deadline.
