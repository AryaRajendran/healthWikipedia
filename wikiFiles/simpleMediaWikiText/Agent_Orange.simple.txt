Agent Orange is a very powerful herbicide that was used in the Vietnam War. It is a defoliant that destroyed forests. It was used by the United States military so their enemies had no place to hide.

The problem with Agent Orange is that when it is released, some dioxins are also generated. Dioxins have many problems: It takes a long time until they are eliminated from the environment. They are very toxic, and cause genetic modifications and cancer.
