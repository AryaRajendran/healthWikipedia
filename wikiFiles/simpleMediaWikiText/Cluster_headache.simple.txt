A cluster headache is a kind of nerve disease. Its most prominent feature is a strong and one-sided pain in the area behind and around the eye. "Cluster" refers to the tendency of these headaches to occur periodically, with active periods interrupted by spontaneous remissions. Some patients do not have remission periods. The headaches can last anywhere from 15â€“180 minutes and, in severe cases can occur many times a day. The cause of the disease is currently unknown.

Cluster headaches can have different symptoms. Most patients get restless or agitated during an attack, unlike migraine patients who usually would prefer to stay calm and lie down in a dark room. Other symptoms can be a runny nose, nasal congestion and/or a red and/or tearing eye on the side of the headache.
