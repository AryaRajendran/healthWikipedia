A throat culture is a medical test which looks for bacteria or fungus that cause infections in the throat. A sterile piece of cotton is rubbed across the back of the throat near the tonsils. This may cause a person to want to cough or vomit. The bacteria on the cotton are then grown in a laboratory where scientists can identify them using a microscope.
