Anoxia means there is no oxygen. Anoxic is used in biology to refer to habitats with little or no oxygen. A related term is hypoxia, which means low oxygen.
Anaerobic usually means the same thing: an anaerobic organism is one which does not need oxygen.
Anoxic events occur when an area of ocean loses most of its oxygen below the surface layers.
