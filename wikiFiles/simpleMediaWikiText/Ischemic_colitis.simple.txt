Ischemic colitis (also called Colonic ischemia) is a medical condition in which inflammation and injury cause an inadequite blood supply to the large instestine. It occurs more often in older people. In fact, more than 90% of cases occur in people over the age of 60. Ischemic colitis is the most common form of bowel ischemia.



Most cases of ischemic colitis are mild and will get better on their own. IV fluids are givin to patients to treat dehydration. Patients are also told not to eat or drink anything until the symptoms get better. Severe ischemic colitis that leads to gangrene can be treated with antibiotics and surgery.
