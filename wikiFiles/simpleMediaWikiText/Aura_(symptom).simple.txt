In some people, the way they perceive things (or generally, how they feel) changes, before they have an epileptic seizure, or before they develop migraine. This feeling is known as aura, from the Greek word for breeze. The cause of the aura is related to the way the brain works, so this is a neurological condition. There are different kinds of migraine. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have the kind with an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems such as losing vision for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots, dizziness, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus) and problems speaking.
Some epileptics can prevent themselves from being hurt badly, because they often have an aura before having a seizure. The time between the aura, and an epileptic seizure is generally short. With migraine, this time between the aura and the onset of migraine can be longer, up to about an hour. 
There are other neurological conditions which can cause symptoms that resemble those of an aura. These include strokes, and panic attacks, for example. 





Scotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: skotos): a blind spot or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. i.e.: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is.Scotomas may affect one or both eyes and be either and be either absolute where nothing can be seen within the scotoma or, relative with some ability to see within the area of the scotoma.
