Pancreatic cancer  is cancer affecting the pancreas. It has a poor prognosis, with less than 5% of patients surviving beyond five years after the cancer has been diagnosed.



In cases of localized pancreatic disease, the surgery to remove the cancer is often the first treatment. It is typically followed by chemotherapy, often with Gemzar or 5-FU.
