The somatic nervous system (SNS) is part of the peripheral nervous system . It controls voluntary body movements by skeletal muscles, and sensory input of external stimuli (e.g., touch, hearing, and sight).
The SNS consists of nerves responsible for stimulating muscle contraction, including all the neurons connected with skeletal muscles, skin, and sense organs.
The somatic nervous system processes sensory information and controls all voluntary muscular systems within the body, with the exception of reflex arcs.
