 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also called electroshock, is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are caused by electricity in unconscious patients to treat illness. The process is completed by placing electrodes on a patient's temple (on either both or just one side) and sending a small electric current through the brain. This lasts for about half a second.The patient is also made unconscious before the treatment for safety reasons. It is used mainly for people suffering from depression. It is generally only used when anti-depressant drugs have had no effect.
