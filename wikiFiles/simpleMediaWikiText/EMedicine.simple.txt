eMedicine is an online research tool for clinical studies. It was founded in 1996 by two medical doctors, Scott Plantz and Richard Lavely. The website is searchable by keyword. It consists of about 6,800 articles, each of which is associated with one of 62 clinical subspecialty textbooks. Pediatrics, for example, consists of 14 subspecialty textbooks (endocrinology, genetics, cardiology, pulmonology, etc.).  For example, 750 articles comprise the textbook on emergency medicine.  Each article is authored by board-certified specialists in the subspecialty to which the article belongs. The article's authors are identified with their current jobs.  Each article is updated yearly and the date is published on the article.

It was sold to WebMD in January 2006.
