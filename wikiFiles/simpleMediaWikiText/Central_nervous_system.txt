 The central nervous system (CNS) is the largest part of the nervous system. It is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. Together with the peripheral nervous system, it has an important role in the control of behaviour. The CNS is protected by bone in the dorsal cavity: the brain in the cranial subcavity, and the spinal cord in the spinal cavity.
