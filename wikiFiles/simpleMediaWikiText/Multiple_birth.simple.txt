Multiple birth is when one woman gives birth to more than one child at the same time. Depending on the number of children born, it can be called twins (two), triplets (three), quadruplets (four), and so on. There have been cases known in which woman gave birth to eight children at once. These have a higher risk of dying.
The chance of multiple birth grows when artificial insemination is used. It is therefore used in China to outsmart the one-child policy.
