An Astroctytoma is a form of a brain tumor that comes from astrocytes (a type of brain cell). While many low-grade astrocytomas can be effectively treated with surgery alone, with some reports indicating rates of five year survival of up to 90%. Pilocytic astrocytomas are even more indolent, with excellent survival rates. On the other hand, high-grade astrocytomas such as Anaplastic astrocytoma have worse prognoses. Temozolomide is approved for the treatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma.
