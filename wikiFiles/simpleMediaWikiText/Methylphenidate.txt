It is sometimes used together with other drugs to treat depression. In most countries, its use needs to be prescribed by a doctor. The most common side-effects of taking the drug are nervousness and sleeping problems. About one in ten patients see these problems. Other side-effects include changes of blood pressure, headache, and weight loss. Rare cases of Tourette syndrome and psychosis have been reported, amongst others.
