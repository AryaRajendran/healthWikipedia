Prostate cancer is a disease in which cancer develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. It is often treated with prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy.
Aggressive prostate cancer is now known to have a genetic basis. Men with gene BRCA2 are more likely to get the cancer, and more likely it will be in its most aggressive form.
