In vertebrates (<em>left</em>) <strong>1</strong> represents the <a href="retina">retina</a> and <strong>2</strong> is the nerve fibers, including the optic nerve (<strong>3</strong>), whereas in the octopus eye (<em>right</em>) <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> represent the nerve fibers and retina respectively.</div>A <strong>blind spot</strong> is a part of the <a href="visual field">visual field</a> our brains get no information from. It is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light-detecting <a href="photoreceptor cell">photoreceptor cell</a>s where the <a href="optic nerve">optic nerve</a> passes through the <a href="optic disc">optic disc</a> of the <a href="retina">retina</a>. Since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc, a part of the field of vision is not perceived. The <a href="human brain">brain</a> fills in with surrounding detail and with information from the other eye, so the blind spot is not normally perceived.Although all <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s have this blind spot, <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a> eyes, which are superficially similar, do not. In them, the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind, so it does not create a break in the retina.The first documented observation of the phenomenon was in the 1660s by <a href="Edme Mariotte">Edme Mariotte</a> in France. At the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive portion of the retina; however, Mariotte's discovery disproved this theory.<h2> Blind spot test </h2><h2> Not seeing the blind spot </h2>As to why the blind spot is normally not seen, there are two theories. One, less favoured, is that it is simply ignored by the brain. The other is that they are 'filled in' by the brain with information from surrounding areas. Perception theorists have generally favoured this second <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a>. The filling-in works with quite complex and unusual visual patterns, suggesting an active brain process works to mimic patterns surrounding the blind spot.<h2> Vertebrate eye and cephalopod eye </h2>These natural blind spots are present only in the eyes of vertebrates. Cephalopods have their optic nerves attached to the back of the retina, so they are not a problem. The vertebrate eye is illogical because light must go through and past the <a href="nerve fibre">nerve fibre</a>s before getting to the retina.This comes about because vertebrate eyes are outgrowths from the brain; they grow outward from the <a href="Embryology">embryological</a> tissue which forms the brain.<h2> References </h2><a href="Template:Reflist">Template:Reflist</a></body>
