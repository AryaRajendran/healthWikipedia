A prosthesis is a device made to replace a missing human body part. They are used by people who have lost them in accidents or due to health problems (amputees) or were born without them, so that they can do normal things. Originally, prostheses were simply pieces of wood (for example, wooden legs), but now they are made of lighter mater.
