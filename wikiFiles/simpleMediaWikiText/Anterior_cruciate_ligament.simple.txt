The anterior crutiate ligament is one of the four major ligaments of the human knee. The injury of this ligament is the most common one of the knee. Many athletes suffer from this condition. Moving the knee sideways or rotating it can cause this ligament to strain or tear. Tears will almost always require surgery to repair.
