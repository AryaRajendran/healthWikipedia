A brain tumor is any tumor in the brain. Tumors may be benign or malignant.



The treatment varies based on the type of tumor. For meningiomas, surgical removal of the tumor alone is often sufficient. Malignant tumors like anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme, however, require more aggressive therapy. For glioblastoma multiforme, surgical removal of the tumor followed by radiotherapy is used. Temozolomide (also known as Temodar) is also used for gliomas (including Glioblastoma multiforme).
