Aspirin is a brand name of Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). It has many uses, but is most commonly used as a pain killer, or used to reduce Fever or Inflammation.  It also has an Anti-Platelet effect - it reduces the number of Platelets in the blood which reduces blood clotting- in that function it is used to prevent Heart Attacks.
There are some possible side-effects to this drug. For example, large amounts can damage the kidneys. Children taking aspirin can develop Reye's syndrome which causes the liver to become fatty and not work properly and also the brain to become enlarged. Reyes Syndrome can be fatal, however most children survive it with treatment.
People with lung, kidney disease, Gout, Hyperuricemia (high amounts of Uric Acid in the blood), Hemophilia (a blood clotting disorder), Diabetes or high blood pressure should not take aspirin except on the advice of a qualified medical professional. Nor should people who are allergic to it, to Ibuprofen or to Naproxen. People with Asthma where attacks are brought about by aspirin should avoid using any Anti-inflammatory drugs based on it.
