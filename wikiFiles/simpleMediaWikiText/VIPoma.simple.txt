A VIPoma  (Pronounced "V I P oma") (also called Verner Morrison syndrome after the doctors who first noticed it), is a tumor that does not happen a lot (1 per 10,000,000 per year) in the pancreas. VIPoma makes something called vasoactive intestinal peptide, or VIP.  It can do bad things to the heart, brain, gut, gallbladder, and more.

Octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) can be used to help symptoms. Surgery is the only thing that will make it go away completely.
