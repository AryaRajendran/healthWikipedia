Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequently encountered type of liver cancer. It is more common in those with cirrhosis of the liver. If localized to the liver and small at the time of diagnosis, it can be surgically treated. If metastatic, it may be treated with Nexavar, a oral medication approved in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation may be used in some cases.
