A '''genetic disorder''' is an [[illness]] caused by abnormalities in the [[genome]]. They are [[heritable]], and are passed down from the parents' [[genes]]. If a genetic disorder is present from birth, it is a type of [[congenital defect]]. Some only show up in later life.

Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions. Sometimes they are relatively frequent in a population. Some types of [[recessive]] gene disorders confer an [[Heterozygote advantage|advantage in certain environments]] when only one copy of the gene is present.<ref>[http://www.teachersdomain.org/resources/tdc02/sci/life/gen/lp_disorder/index.html WGBH Educational Foundation]</ref> [[Sickle cell anaemia]] is an example.

The same [[disease]], such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and by nongenetic causes in still other people. A disease in only called a genetic disease when it is inherited.
