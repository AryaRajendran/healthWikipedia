'''Alopecia''' is a [[disease|condition]] which is found in [[human]]s, as well as in some [[animal]]s. When it occurs, it will mean that those affected will permanently lose some (or all) of their hair. Since some of the factors are linked to the [[gene]]s on the [[chromosome]], the condition can be seen more often with men, than with women. 
'''Alopecia areata''' is the name for a condition in which a person suddenly loses his or her hair. It mostly happens to men, who become [[baldness|bald]].
