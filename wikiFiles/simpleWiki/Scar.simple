A '''scar''' is the natural [[wikt:result|result]] of a [[healing]] [[wikt:process|process]] in the [[human]] [[body]]. When the deeper [[layer]] ([[scientist]]s call that ''dermis'') is hurt by a [[wound]], the wounded [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] will be replaced by scar tissue. Scar tissue is not identical to the tissue it replaces. A scar will look different (and have different [[wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s) than the surrounding tissue.
