'''Cerebral aneurysms''', also called '''brain aneurysms''', are a cerebrovascular issue in which weakness in the walls of a cerebral artery causes localized dilation or ballooning in the [[blood]] vessel. Small, unchanging aneurysms may produce very few symptoms. However, before a larger aneurysm ruptures, individuals may experience sudden or severe headaches, nausea, [[vomit]]ing and vision problems. The rupture may also directly cause serious damage directly to the brain, usually from the bleeding itself-this is a hemorrhagic stroke that can lead to and may cause [[arm]] or [[leg]] weakness or paralysis and speech troubles. Cerebral aneurysms may result due to congenital defect, [[high blood pressure]] or [[head]] trauma. Onsets are sometimes sudden and without warning, and such ruptures are extremely dangerous and usually result in bleeding into the brain itself, leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which then constitutes a stroke. This condition may lead to death or permanent disability for some individuals.
