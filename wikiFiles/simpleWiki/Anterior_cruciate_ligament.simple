The '''anterior crutiate ligament''' is one of the four major [[ligament]]s of the human [[knee]]. The injury of this ligament is the most common one of the knee. Many [[athlete]]s suffer from this condition. Moving the knee sideways or rotating it can cause this ligament to strain or tear. Tears will almost always require [[surgery]] to repair.
