'''[[Animal]] testing''', also known as '''animal [[experiment]]ation''', '''animal research''', and '''in vivo testing''' is the use of animals for experiments. [[Drosophila melanogaster|Fruit flies]] and [[mice]] are often used for animal testing. About 50 to 100 million [[vertebrate]] animals and many more invertebrate animals are used around the world every year.<ref>[http://www.buav.org/pdf/VivisectionFAQs.pdf "Vivisection FAQ], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection; [http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/fileLibrary/pdf/RIA_Report_FINAL-opt.pdf "The Ethics of research involving animals"], Nuffield Council on Bioethics, section 1.6.</ref> The source of the animals are different according to the country and species. Most animals used for experiments are [[wikt:breed|bred]] for this purpose. But others may be caught from the wild or bought from people who buy them from [[pound]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.newsweek.com/2006/02/16/bought-to-be-sold.html

They say that it is cruel, poorly done, and costly. Others argue that animals have the right not to be used for experiments, and that animal models are different from humans. The limits to animal testing is different in various countries.

== Definitions ==

The words animal testing, '''animal experimentation''', animal research, '''''in vivo'' testing''', and '''[[vivisection]]''' have similar meanings,differently. "tatiosion" means to "cut up" a living animal. It was used only in experiments that [[dissection|dissected]] live animals. The word "vivisection" is sometimes used [[wikt:negative|negatively]] about any experiment with live animals. For example, the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' described "vivisection" as: "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382118?query=Vivisection&ct= "Vivisection"], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2007. Also see Croce, Pietro. ''Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health''. Zed Books, 1999, and [http://www.buav.org/pdf/VivisectionFAQs.pdf "FAQs: Vivisection"], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.</ref> However, [[dictionary|dictionaries]] note that the wider definition is "used only by people who are opposed (dislike) to such work".<ref>Definitions in [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-vivisection.html Oxford Pocket Dictionary] and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vivisection Merriam-Webster Dictionary]</ref> The word makes people think of [[torture]], pain, and [[death]].<ref>Carbone, Larry.

== History ==
[[Image:An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump, from 1768, by Joseph Wright]]

The earliest mention of animal testing is in the writings of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] in the second and fourth centuries BCE. [[Aristotle]] (Αριστοτέλης) (384 – 322 BCE) and [[Erasistratus]] (304 – 258 BCE) were some of the first people to try out experiments on living animals.<ref>Cohen and Loew 1984.</ref> [[Galen]], a doctor in second-century [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] who was known as the "father of vivisection", dissected [[pig]]s and [[goat]]s.<ref name=lpag>[http://www.lpag.org/layperson/layperson.html#history "History of nonhuman animal research"], Laboratory Primate Advocacy Group.</ref> Avenzoar, an Arabic doctor in twelfth-century Spain, tested out [[surgery|surgical]] processes on animals before applying them to humans.<ref name=Rabie2005>Rabie E.

Animals have often been used in the history of scientific study. In the 1880s, [[Louis Pasteur]] showed the [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] of medicine by putting [[Anthrax (disease)|anthrax]] in [[sheep]].<ref name="pmid11544370">{{cite journal|author=Mock M, Fouet A|title=Anthrax|journal=Annu.

In the 20th century, [[toxicology]] testing became important. In the 19th century, laws about [[drug]]s were less strict. Drugs did not have to be checked for safety.<ref name=raspberrypoison>{{Cite web |url= http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm |title=Sulfanilamide Disaster |work=fda.gov |accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> But in 1937, a drug called Elixir Sulfanilamide  killed more than 100 people. They caused great and long lasting pain, [[vomit]]ing, and fits.<ref name=raspberrypoison/> After that, the U.S. congress made laws that said that drugs had to be tested on animals before they could be sold. Other countries passed similar laws.<ref name=raspberrypoison/>

Even back in the 17th century, people disagreed about animal testing. In 1655, Edmund O'Meara said that "the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state."<ref>Ryder, Richard D. Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism.

Croom Helm, London, 1987, p. 22.</ref> O'Meara and others said that animals could be affected by pain during vivisection, making results unreliable. Others also disliked animal testing because they felt that animals should not be hurt for humans.<ref name=ANZCCART/> Others opposed animal testing for different reasons: many believed that animals were not as good as humans and that they were so different that results of animal testing would not work on humans.<ref name=ANZCCART/>

Supporters had different views. They argued that experiments on animals were necessary for knowledge. [[Claude Bernard]], the "prince of vivisectors"<ref name=Croce11>Croce, Pietro. ''Vivisection or Science? An Investigation into Testing Drugs and Safeguarding Health''. Zed Books, 1999, p. 11.</ref> and the father of physiology famously wrote in 1865 that "the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly (brightly) lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen".<ref name=TelegraphNov2003>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2003/11/24/hsick23.xml "In sickness and in health: vivisection's undoing"], ''The Daily Telegraph, November 2003.</ref> He declared that "experiments on {{nowrap|animals ... are}} entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of {{nowrap|man ... the}} effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree".<ref name=Bernard>[[Claude Bernard|Bernard, Claude]] ''An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine'', 1865.

In 1896, [[Walter Cannon|Dr. Walter B.
