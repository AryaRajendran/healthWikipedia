A '''stroke''' is an [[event]] which damages part of the [[brain]]. This can happen if an [[artery]] that feeds [[blood]] to the brain gets clogged, or if it tears and leaks.

A stroke, or '''cerebrovascular accident''' ('''CVA'''), is the rapid loss of brain function(s) due to disturbance in the [[blood supply]] to the brain. This can happen because of [[ischemia]] (lack of blood flow) caused by blockage ([[thrombosis]], [[arterial embolism]]), or a [[haemorrhage]] (leakage of blood).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sims NR, Muyderman H |title=Mitochondria, oxidative metabolism and cell death in stroke |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume= 1802|issue= 1|pages= 80–91|year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19751827 |doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.09.003}}</ref> 

As a result, the affected area of the brain cannot work properly. [[Symptom]]s might include: [[hemiplegia]] (an inability to move one or more [[limb]]s on one side of the body), [[aphasia]] (inability to understand or use speech), or an inability to see one side of the [[visual field]].<ref name=Donnan>{{cite journal |author=Donnan GA, Fisher M, Macleod M, Davis SM |title=Stroke |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9624 |pages=1612–23 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18468545 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60694-7}}</ref>

A stroke is a [[medical emergency]]. It can cause permanent damage. If it is not quickly treated, it may lead to death. It is the third most common cause of [[death]] and the most common cause of disability for adults in the United States and Europe.

Factors that increase the risk of a stroke include [[old age]], [[high blood pressure]], a previous stroke, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], [[smoking]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[migraine]] with aura, and [[thrombophilia]] (a tendency to [[thrombosis]]). Of those factors, the most easy to fix are high blood pressure and smoking.
