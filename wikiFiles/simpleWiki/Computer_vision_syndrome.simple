'''Computer Vision Syndrome''' or '''CVS''' is when someone's sight goes [[blurry]] because they have been looking at a [[computer]] [[screen]] for too long.

Sometimes, simply changing a work environment to have better ergonomics is all that needs to be done to reduce eye strain and other vision problems related to CVS. In some cases, a good pair of computer eyeglasses may help someone see better at the right distance range needed for looking at a computer screen.
