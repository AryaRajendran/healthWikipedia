'''Hodgkin's lymphoma''', also known as '''Hodgkin's disease''', is a cancer of the [[lymphatic system]], also known as a [[lymphoma]]. It was first discovered by [[Thomas Hodgkin]] in 1832. It is one of many kinds of cancers of the lymphatic system. Most of the time, the cancer develops in a single [[lymph node]] before it spreads to the rest of the body. The symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma change as the disease progresses. At the first stage of the disease, the person may feel a lump on the affected lymph node that does not hurt when touched. The person may have strange [[fever]]s, sweating during the night, and itchy skin. In the later stages of the disease, the person may feel very tired and their [[spleen]] may grow larger.
