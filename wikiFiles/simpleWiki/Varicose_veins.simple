'''Varicose veins''' are a condition in which the [[vein]]s in the [[leg]] area have become enlarged. If veins have become varicose, the leaflets of the valves do not work properly, and in turn, the vein valves themselves won't work. The [[blood]] then flows backwards, at which point the veins then start to increase. This condition is most common in superficial veins which involve the legs. The condition not only causes cosmetic troubles, it also creates [[itch]]ing and painful problems.
