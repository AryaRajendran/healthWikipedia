A '''Mutagen''' is a substance or a process that changes the [[gene]]tic material of an organism. Mutagens also increase the number of [[mutation]]s that occur. Many mutagens also cause [[cancer]], so they are also [[carcinogen]]s. Examples of mutagens are [[Ionizing radiation]], many [[bromine]] compounds, [[benzene]]. A test to detect mutagens is the [[Ames test]].
