'''Epithelium''' is one of the four main types of [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] in the body of [[animals]]. It is made up of one or more layers of [[cell]]s. Epithelium is found on the surface of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and many other parts of the body. The main function of epithelium is moving [[liquid|fluids]] into or out of an organ or body part. It can also help protect organs and [[sensory system|sense]] things. There are many different types of epithelium that do different things in the body, including the [[excretory]] system.
