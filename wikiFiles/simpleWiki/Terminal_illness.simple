'''Terminal illness''' is a term used to describe an illness which cannot be cured and will almost definitely end in the death of the [[patient]].  The term is mostly used for progressive diseases such as [[cancer]] or advanced [[heart disease]].  Someone who has a terminal illness may be described as a '''terminal patient''' or as being '''terminally ill'''.  Usually a patient is called "terminally ill" when they are not expected to live more than 6 months.  Medical conditions such as [[AIDS]] are not called terminal illnesses because the patient may live for many years before eventually dying of the illness.

Very often, terminally ill patients are given [[palliative care]] to give them a better quality of life.  Sometimes they go to a [[hospice]] to be looked after.
