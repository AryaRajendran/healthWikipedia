A '''heart-lung transplant''' is a type of [[surgery]] to help people who have very sick [[heart]]s and [[lung]]s. In this surgery, the patient's own heart and lungs are taken out and replaced by healthy [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. During the surgery, a machine called a [[heart-lung machine]] pumps blood for the patient and breathes for him or her. Not many heart-lung transplants are done, because there are not enough [[organ donation|donated organs]].
