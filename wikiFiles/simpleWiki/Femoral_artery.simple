The '''femoral artery''' is the large [[artery]] that takes [[oxygen]] rich [[blood]] to a human's legs. Coming from the [[heart]] the blood flows along the iliac artery which then divides into the two (bifurcates) femoral arteries, to supply blood to each leg.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/femoral_artery |title=Femoral Artery  |first= |last= |work=Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> The artery is very close to the surface where it passes through the [[groin]].
