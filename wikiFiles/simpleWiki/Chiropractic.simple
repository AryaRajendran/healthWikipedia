'''Chiropractic''' is a form of [[alternative medicine]]. A '''chiropractor''' is a [[doctor]] who went to [[school]] to learn chiropractic. A chiropractor may [[diagnose]] and treat many [[condition]]s relating to [[muscle]]s, [[joint]]s, and [[nerve]]s of the [[body]]. He may give what is called an "adjustment" to the body. An adjustment is a fast short push to an area of the [[patient]]'s [[spine]] or other joints to help their condition. A chiropractor does not use [[drug]]s to treat patients. They will look into using [[nature|natural]] [[treatment]]s such as [[nutrition]], [[exercise]], [[physical therapy]], adjustments, and [[massage]] in order to help their patients. Chiropractic has changed since it was created over 100 years ago as new [[fact]]s and [[research]] are learned by chiropractors. Today, chiropractors have many different ways to treat their patients. They all have one thing in common. This is to use drug free treatments. Chiropractic is most famous for helping people with spine [[pain]], but chiropractors can also help other problems.
