'''Melanoma''' ({{pron-en|ˌmɛləˈnoʊmə}}) is a [[malignant]] [[tumor]] of [[melanocyte]]s which are found predominantly in skin but also in the [[bowel]] and the [[eye]] (see [[uveal melanoma]]). It is one of the rarer types of [[skin cancer]] but causes the majority of skin cancer related deaths. Malignant melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer. It is due to uncontrolled growth of pigment cells, called melanocytes.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_34983.html Melanoma Death Rate Still Climbing]</ref><ref>[http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/melan.html Cancer Stat Fact Sheets]</ref>
