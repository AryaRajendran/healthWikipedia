'''Metastasis''' is what happens when [[cancer]] spreads from its original place to another part of the body.  Cancer cells spread from the original site to other places in the body by traveling through the [[bloodstream]]. When the cancer cells stick to a new place in the body, they grow and form another tumor there.
