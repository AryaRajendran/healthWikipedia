An '''Astroctytoma''' is a form of a [[brain]] tumor that comes from [[astrocytes]] (a type of [[brain cell]]). While many low-grade astrocytomas can be effectively treated with [[surgery]] alone, with some reports indicating rates of five year survival of up to 90%. [[Pilocytic astrocytoma]]s are even more indolent, with excellent survival rates. On the other hand, high-grade astrocytomas such as [[Anaplastic astrocytoma]] have worse [[prognosis|prognoses]]. [[Temozolomide]] is approved for the treatment of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma.
