'''Dietary fiber''' is the part of food from plants that cannot be digested. Dietary fiber helps to [[absorb]] water or remove waste from the body. Dietary fiber has many parts that plants have, and  is eaten in plant foods.

Dietary fiber includes substances like [[cellulose]], [[wax]] and [[lignin]], among others. The term "fiber" is not the best way to describe it, because many of these substances are not actually [[fibers]].

Dietary Fiber [http://gicare.com/Diets/high-fiber-diets.aspx] is grouped if it is [[soluble]] or insoluble. Soluble means if it helps to absorb water or not. If it is insoluble, it helps remove wastes from the body.
