'''Peripheral neuropathy''' happens when the nerves of the peripheral [[nervous system]] suffer damage due to disease, trauma to the nerves or through side effects of a certain illness. The four patterns of this condition are polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, nononeuritis mp and autonomic nerve damage. The most common of these is polyneuropathy which affects the [[foot|feet]] and legs. The actual forms may be broken down by causes. Losses of muscle bulk and muscle twitches may be seen. Damage to the sensory nerves may lead to numbness, strong tingling or burning [[pain]] that is described as electric-like, freezing and burning. Autonomic nerve damage leads to issues, such as [[hypertension]], [[sex]]ual troubles, bladder dysfunction and abnormal heart rate. Neuropathy can happen with or without the presence of [[diabetes mellitus]].
