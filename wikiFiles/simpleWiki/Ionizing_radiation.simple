'''Ionizing radiation''' is a process in [[physics]] where something sends out [[particle]]s or [[electromagnetic radiation|waves]] that can [[ion]]ize an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] through atomic interactions. 

The strength of ionizing radiation depends on the energy of the individual particles or waves, and not a function of the number of particles or waves present. 

There are several types of [[Ionization|ionizing]] radiation, including:
*[[Radioactive decay|gamma radiation]], which is high-energy electromagnetic waves
*[[particle radiation]], in which small pieces of matter are radiated, which include:
**[[Radioactive decay|alpha radiation]], made of [[helium]] [[nucleus (physics)|nuclei]]
**[[Radioactive decay|beta radiation]], made of energetic [[electron]]s or [[positrons]]
**[[neutron radiation]], made of [[neutron]]s

Some radiation can go through the [[human body]] and other objects. Usually when people use the term radiation, they are talking specifically about potentially harmful types of ionizing radiation. If something produces this sort of radiation, we can say it is ''radioactive''. 

There is a little radiation all around us all the time, which people's bodies are used to, but larger amounts of radiation can make people sick or kill them. Natural radiation is produced by some [[chemical element]]s, such as [[uranium]], and by [[star]]s and other things in [[outer space]]. Some things that are radioactive only stay radioactive for much less than a [[second]]. Other things can stay radioactive for thousands of years. 

People can also make radiation because of small traces of [[Carbon-14]] in them. Some of the machines that make radiation are called [[cyclotron]]s, [[linear accelerator]]s and [[particle accelerator]]s. Scientists use these machines to make radiation so they can study it. [[X-ray]] machines make radiation so doctors can see the inside of the [[human body]] and help people. [[Nuclear weapon]]s ([[atomic weapon]]s) use a nuclear reaction to produce massive amounts of energy, in the form of heat, light, and radiation. This radiation is spread by the dust, ash, and smoke produced by the blast.

[[Nuclear reactor]]s are used to make [[electricity]]. They make a lot of radiation, but the reactors are built carefully to keep the radiation inside the reactor. But many people are afraid that if there were a problem with the reactor, the radiation could escape into the environment, harming or killing many animals and people. Also, the parts of the reactor stay radioactive, and can kill people, for hundreds or thousands of years, so people are not sure where they can keep parts of old reactors safely away from people.
