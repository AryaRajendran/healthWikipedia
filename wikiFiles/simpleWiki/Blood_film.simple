A '''blood film''' or '''peripheral blood smear''' is a thin layer of [[blood]] smeared on a microscope slide and then stained in such a way to allow the various blood cells to be examined microscopically. Blood films are usually examined to investigate disorders of the blood and, occasionally, to look for [[Apicomplexa|parasites]] within the blood such as [[malaria]] and filaria.<ref>Helmut LÃ¶ffler, Johann Rastetter, Torsten Haferlach, H.
