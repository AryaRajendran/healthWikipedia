'''Iodised salt''' (also spelled "iodized salt") is [[Sodium chloride|table salt]] mixed with tiny amounts of [[iodine]] and is used to prevent [[disease]] of the [[thyroid]] gland.

People only need a very small amount of iodine to prevent disease.  Food [[crop]]s usually get iodine from the [[soil]], but some places around the world have low amounts of iodine.  Iodised salt is a very cheap and good way of getting the necessary iodine.

Ordinary table (cooking) salt is a [[chemical compound]] called "[[sodium chloride]]" (its chemical formula is NaCl). "Sodium [[iodine|iodide]]" (NaI) is added to the NaCl to make iodised salt.
