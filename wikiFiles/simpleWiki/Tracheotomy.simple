'''Tracheotomy''' and '''tracheostomy''' is a [[surgery]] on the [[neck]] to open a direct path by cutting a hole in the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (windpipe). They are performed by [[paramedic]]s, [[veterinarian]]s, emergency [[physician]]s, and [[surgeon]]s. Both surgical and percutaneous techniques are now widely used.

Tracheostomy was written about in [[ancient Egypt]]ian tablets,<ref>[http://www.tracheostomy.com/resources/pdf/evolution.pdf "Tracheostomy: Evolution of an Airway,"] Steven E. Sittig and James E. Pringnitz, ''AARC Times,'' February 2001.</ref> but, in the 12th century, Ibn Zuhr described the first correct tracheotomy operation for people who were [[suffocation|suffocating]] (could not breathe).<ref name=Shehata>Prof. Dr. Mostafa Shehata, "The Ear, Nose and Throat in Islamic Medicine", ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2003 (1): 2-5 [4].</ref> The current tracheostomy was described in 1909 by Chevalier Jackson, an American doctor.
