The '''herpes simplex virus''' ('''HSV''') (also known as '''Cold Sore''', '''Night Fever''', or '''Fever Blister''') is a [[virus]]. It causes two common [[virus|viral infections]]. Each infection has painful, [[water]]y [[blister]]s in the skin or mucous membranes (such as the mouth or lips) or on the [[genital]]s. The disease is [[contagious]], particularly during an outbreak. ''Contagious'' means that it can spread from one person to another.It is incurable with present medicine. An infection on the lips is commonly known as a "cold sore" or "fever blister," though this should not be confused with a [[canker sore]], which appears inside the mouth and is not caused by the herpes simplex virus.
