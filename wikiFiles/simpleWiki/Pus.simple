[[File:Swollen eye with conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|[[Conjunctivitis]] is an inflammation of the [[Conjunctiva]] of the eye. The yellow liquid below the eye is pus.]]
'''Pus''' is a [[fluid]] that is created as a result of certain [[inflammation]]s in [[vertebrate]]s. In vertebrates, [[White blood cell]]s fight the inflammation. [[Neutrophil]]s destroy the agents that cause the infection, for example [[bacteria]], [[Macrophage]]s engulf and neutralise these agents. Pus is made of dead neutrophils and macrophages, mostly. In most cases, pus is the result of bacterial infection, but it can also result from other conditions, such as [[Psoriasis]].
