'''Periodontitis''' is a set of [[disease]]s which usually attacks the tissues surrounding the [[teeth]]. Periodontitis in comparison with [[Gingivitis]] is a more severe inflammation, because not only it affects the tissues, but also, it affects the bottom of the teeth. If it is not treated at all, it may lead to a [[loss of teeth]].

The word "periodontitis" comes from peri ("around"), odont  ("tooth") and -itis ("redness").
