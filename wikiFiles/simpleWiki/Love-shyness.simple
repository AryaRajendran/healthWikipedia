The term '''love-shyness''' represents a major condition which impairs or may not allow intimate relationships. People who are love shy may find it extremely hard to be assertive in informal situations related to [[sex]] or [[romance|romantic]] partners. For example, straight men might have problems having a conversation with women, and vice versa. Being love-shy may exist with or without [[social phobia|social troubles]]. The condition affects both males and females, although in males the problem is a lot more obvious than in females. People that are love shy may have had negative influences in their personal lives, including serious abuse, [[mental illness]] or being insulted from others. However, love-shyness has not been recognized as a mental disorder by the [[World Health Organization]].
