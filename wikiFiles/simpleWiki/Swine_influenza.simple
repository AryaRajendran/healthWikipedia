[[File:Sow with piglet.jpg|thumb|right|Pigs can have more than one type of flu at the same time. This means that viruses can mix [[gene]]s and become a type of flu that could cause a pandemic.]]

'''Swine influenza virus''' is a [[virus]] that is common in [[pig]]s. This type of [[influenza]] virus can also infect humans and birds. Swine influenza virus is sometimes called '''SIV''' or '''swine flu'''.

== Background ==
[[File:Spanish flu hospital.png|thumb|Military hospital during Spanish flu pandemic in 1918.]]

H1N1 came from the [[Spanish flu]], which caused a [[pandemic]] in humans in 1918 and 1919.<ref name=Pandemic>

}}</ref><ref name=NYT76/> New viruses came from the Spanish flu. These viruses became common in pigs. Every once in a while, the viruses spread from pigs to humans. This has happened during the 20th century. (However, they happened at the same time as the flu [[epidemic]]s that happen every year. Because of this, it is hard to tell the difference between 'normal' influenza and swine influenza.)<ref name=Pandemic/> Infections that spread from pigs to humans are rare. Scientists only know of 12 known cases in the [[United States]] since 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN26488473 |title=U.S. pork groups urge hog farmers to reduce flu risk |agency=Reuters |date=26 April 2009}}</ref> 

It is very difficult to prevent the flu virus. This is because the virus changes all the time. If a person gets the flu, his body forms [[antibody|antibodies]] to fight that virus off if it happens again. But since the flu virus changes all the time, a person's antibodies do not recognize the virus the next time it happens, because it is different. The same thing happens with [[vaccine]]s. 

The changes in the flu virus can cause a flu [[pandemic]]. For example, the virus might only change a little bit in about two to three years. After about ten years, most people will have developed antibodies to fight these small changes. But if the virus then changes a lot, there can be a pandemic. Hundreds of millions of people suddenly realize that the antibodies they developed are useless.<ref name=DiJusto>[http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/28/1976_swine_flu/ "The Last Great Swine Flu Epidemic"], ''Salon.com'', April 28, 2009</ref> Even during the Spanish flu pandemic, the first wave of the disease was relatively mild, while the second wave was very deadly.<ref name=NYT76/>

In 1957, an Asian flu pandemic infected about 45 million Americans and killed 70,000. Eleven years later, from 1968 to 1969, the [[Hong Kong flu]] pandemic infected 50 million Americans and caused 33,000 deaths. It also cost about $3.9 billion. In 1976, about 500 soldiers became infected with swine flu over a few weeks. However, by the end of the month, investigators found that the virus had "mysteriously disappeared", and there were no more signs of swine flu anywhere on the post.<ref name=NYT76>{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10914FA3E5E14768FDDAC0894D1405B868BF1D3&scp=9&sq=Swine+Flu+epidemic&st=p |title=Soft evidence and hard sell |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=5 September 1976}}</ref> There were a small number of isolated (far-apart) cases around the U.S. However, these were in people who were thought to have caught the virus from pigs. 

Scientists fear the swine flu virus might [[mutation|mutate]], or change, into a pandemic as deadly as the 1918/1919 pandemic. They watched the outbreak in 2009, and made plans about what to do if a global pandemic breaks out.

== Symptoms ==
The main symptoms of the swine influenza is much the same as regular [[influenza]]. Symptoms include [[vomiting]], [[nausea]], [[runny nose]], (loss of appetite), [[lethargy]] (feeling tired), [[chills]], [[fever]], [[body aches]], [[sore throat]], [[cough]]ing, [[diarrhea]], and [[stomach ache]].

== Where swine influenza is found ==
The [[bird flu]] virus [[H3N2]] is endemic in pigs in [[China]]. It has recently been found in pigs in [[Vietnam]]. Specialists also think that this might lead to new variations of the influenza virus.<ref>

In 2005 it was discovered that [[H5N1]] could be infecting up to half of the pig population in some areas of [[Indonesia]], but without showing [[symptom]]s. Chairul Nidom, a virologist at [[Airlangga University]]'s tropical disease center in [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]], did some [[independent]] [[research]]: he tested the blood of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in [[West Java]] where avian flu had broken out, ''Nature'' reported. Five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative.<ref>

The Swine Flu is susceptible to four licensed drugs in the United States, [[amantadine]], [[rimantadine]], [[oseltamivir]] and [[zanamivir]]. However, for the 2009 outbreak, it is recommended it be treated with oseltamivir and zanamivir.<ref>{{cite web

== Veterinary swine flu vaccine ==
The virus has [[evolution|evolved]] in recent decades. This has made Swine influenza a bigger problem, mainly because traditional [[vaccination|vaccines]] against influenza do not always work against Swine influenza. There are special vaccines against Swine influenza, but they only work if the virus strain is similar to some extent. In the cases more difficult to treat, special vaccines are produced. These are very similar, as they are made to match the specific virus strain.<ref>

Present [[Influenza vaccine|vaccination]] strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms, typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of non-reactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests that current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.<ref>{{cite journal

The new strain of swine influenza A is called H1N1 is responsible for the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in humans. It resulted from a combination of several strains of [[influenza|influenza in humans]] and [[avian influenza|influenza in birds]] as well as swine influenza. Tests were done, they found that the [[hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]] (HA) gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses present in United States pigs since 1999, but the [[neuraminidase]] (NA) and [[matrix protein]] (M) genes resembled versions present in European swine. Viruses that were built like this had not been found in humans or pigs before. There is no program to monitor what viruses are circulating in pigs in the United States, however.<ref name="MMWR5815a5">

The first known case was a five year old boy, named Edgar Hernandez. The boy had been near a pig farm in La Gloria, Veracruz state in Mexico. This farm raises almost one million pigs a year.<ref>http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2009/04/29/search-for-swine-flus-patient-zero-leads-to-mexican-boy/</ref>
People living nearby have been complaining about the clouds of flies. These flies are attracted by so-called ''manure lagoons'', which is one of the problems such large farms have.<ref name="timesonline.co.uk">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article6182789.ece Mexico outbreak traced to 'manure lagoons' at pig farm], Times Online, April 28, 2009</ref> It was first thought the boy had a normal influenza. Laboratory tests showed, however, that he had contracted swine flu. The boy fully recovered.<ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/>

"If the people who are supposed to be familiar with this didn't know what it was, how will we ever know how my son got it?" Edgar's mother, Hernandez said.

La Gloria, Perote, Veracruz is a small community, surrounded by large pig farms. Reports indicate that during February 2009 over 400 people in the town had flu like symptoms and 2 infants died of '[[pneumonia]]'. 

Juan Rodriguez died of 'pneumonia' February 9th at age 7 months.

Yovanni Apolinar also died of 'pneumonia' March 12th aged 2 months.

An unidentified Mexican [[toddler]] contracted swine flu in Brownsville, Texas, United States and died April 29th in Houston, Texas, United States at age 23 months.

The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say that while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html?full=true/|title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic?|date=2009-04-29}}</ref>

Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim Deputy Director for CDC Science and Public Health, said that the American cases were found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses – North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza (bird flu), human influenza, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe – "an unusually [[mongrelization|mongrelised]] mix of genetic sequences."<ref name="NewSci-20090426-dn17025">{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17025-deadly-new-flu-virus-in-us-and-mexico-may-go-pandemic.html|title=Deadly new flu virus in US and Mexico may go pandemic|publisher=New Scientist|date=2009-04-26|accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref> Pigs have been shown to act as a potential "mixing vessel" in which [[reassortment]] can occur between flu viruses of several species.<ref>{{cite web|title=New swine flu virus supports 'mixing vessel' theory|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/dec2007swine.html|author=Robert Roos|date=2007-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/52/20949.abstract|title=Identification of H2N3 influenza A viruses from swine in the United States|journal=PNAS|date=2007-12-26|doi=10.1073/pnas.0710286104}}</ref> This new strain appears to be a result of [[reassortment]] of [[human influenza]] and swine influenza viruses, presumably due to [[superinfection]] in an individual human.

The current strain of swine flu can adapt to humans and spread more efficiently than previously known swine H1N1 strains. Moreover, co-infection of H1N1 swine flu and [[Oseltamivir]] resistant H1N1 season flu can lead to acquisition of the H274Y mutation by the swine flu via [[recombination]] or [[reassortment]].<ref name="recombinomics.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.recombinomics.com/News/04220902/H1N1_CA_Swine_H2H.html|title=Human Transmission of Swine H1N1 in Southern California|date=2007-04-22}}</ref>  Swine H1N1 with human H1 and N1 have been reported.<ref name="recombinomics.com"/>

The [[1918 flu pandemic]] strain had undergone [[polymorphism]] from swine and human H1N1 in all eight pieces of [[RNA]] gene segments.  Similar swapping of gene segments in humans co-infected with seasonal human influenza and swine H1N1 can lead to rapid [[evolution]].<ref name="recombinomics.com"/>

The new strain of swine influenza A (H1N1) is currently listed by the United States and World Health Organization as a Stage 5 [[pandemic]] virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicolnews.com/who-raises-h1n1-to-stage-5/|title=
