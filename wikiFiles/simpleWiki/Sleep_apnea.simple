'''Sleep apnea''' (or '''Sleep apnoea''') is a [[problem]] certain people have: When they sleep, they may stop [[breath|breathing]] for short periods. These periods can last for 10 seconds or more. 3-4 breaths are ''missed''. As a result of this, those affected are often tired during the day. Mainly because such people also tend to have [[microsleep]], they should not drive vehicles. Sleep apnea is a treatable disease.

*In case the patient is [[obese]], losing weight improves sleep apnea.
*Fixing the environment where they sleep
*Continuous positive airway pressure([[CPAP]])
*Expiratory positive airway pressure([[EPAP]])
*Circular breathing technique (It makes muscle of the upper airway stronger, so airway remains opening when sleeping. Playing [[didgeridoo]] is good for learning this technique.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Puhan MA, Suarez A, Lo Cascio C ''et al.'' | title=Didgeridoo playing as alternative treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: randomised controlled trial | journal=BMJ | year=2005 | volume=332 | pages=266â€“70 | doi=10.1136/bmj.38705.470590.55 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/332/7536/266 | pmid=16377643 | issue=7536 | pmc=1360393}}</ref>
