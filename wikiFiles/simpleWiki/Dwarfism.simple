'''Dwarfism''' is used to describe a person of short stature, less than 4 feet 10 inches (147 cm). This can occur naturally, but often it is a [[medical condition]]. 

Dwarfism is often caused by the person inheriting an  [[allele]] (a [[mutation|mutant]] [[gene]]), which produces a defect in development. Defects caused by [[genetics]] are the main kind of [[congenital defect]]s, and usually cannot be cured.

The most common cause of dwarfism is a defect in [[bone]] development called ''achondroplasia'', in which the limbs are short in proportion to the body. This accounts for 70% of cases. 

Extreme shortness, but with body parts of normal proportions, may be caused by growth [[hormone]] deficiency, once known as ''[[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] dwarfism''.<ref name='dwarfism-pbshome'>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/bigenough/special_dwarfism_ety.html |title=P.O.V. â€“ Big Enough.
