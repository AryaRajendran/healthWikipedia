'''Acromegaly''' is a medical condition that happens when the anterior (rear) pituitary gland makes too much growth hormone (GH), after a person has passed puberty. If this happens before [[puberty]] it causes a condition known as gigantism. A number of medical conditions may cause the pituitary gland to make too much growth hormone, but the most common cause is a tumor on the pituitary gland called a [[pituitary adenoma]]'

Acromegaly is most commonly diagnosed in middle aged adults, and can result in severe disfigurement, serious complicating conditions, and early death if not treated. Acromegaly is hard to diagnose when it is just beginning. It is usually not found  until 10â€“12 years after it starts. This is when it causes changes in the way a person looks, especially their face.<ref>Shlomo Melmed: The Pituitary. p.433</ref>
