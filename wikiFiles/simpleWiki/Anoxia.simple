'''Anoxia''' means there is no [[oxygen]]. ''Anoxic'' is used in [[biology]] to refer to [[habitat]]s with little or no oxygen. A related term is '''hypoxia''', which means low oxygen. 

'''Anaerobic''' usually means the same thing: an [[anaerobic organism]] is one which does not need oxygen.

[[Anoxic event]]s occur when an area of ocean loses most of its oxygen below the surface layers.
