'''Trisomy 18''', also known as '''Edwards syndrome''' is a [[trisomy]]. It is a [[genetic disorder]]. People with trisomy 18 have three copies of [[chromosome 18]]. "Normal" people have two copies of the chromosome. It is named after [[John H. Edwards]], who first described the syndrome in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/3438.html|title=Edwards syndrome (John Hilton Edwards)|publisher=WhoNamedIt.com|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> It is the second most common [[autosome|autosomal]] [[trisomy]], after [[Down Syndrome]], that carries to term.  

It is estimated that about  one in 3,000 live births are affected.<ref>(2007, July 07). MedlinePlus medical encyclopedia: Trisomy 18.

The syndrome has a very low rate of survival. People with Edwards syndrome often have heart abnormalities, kidney malformations, and other internal organ disorders.  

About 95% of the babies with Edwards syndrome die before they are born. About half of all babies born with the condition will reach two months of age, and only 5-10% will survive for a year.  The [[median]] life span is five to fifteen days.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rodeck|first=Charles H. |coauthors=Whittle, Martin J. |title=Fetal Medicine: Basic Science and Clinical Practice|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|date=1999|isbn=044305357X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0BY0hx2l5uoC&pg=PA555&dq=Trisomy+18&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U0a7Zv57yptaVir5OE6D9VuAY0uBg#PPA555,M1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYD/is_5_38/ai_98830102|title=Trisomy 13 survival can exceed 1 year|last=Zoler|first=Mitchel L. |date= March 1, 2003|publisher=OB/GYN News|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> One percent of children born with this syndrome live to age ten, typically in cases of the less severe [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] Edwards syndrome.<ref name="emed">{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic652.htm#section~Introduction|title=Introduction to Trisomy 18|last=Chen, MD|first=Harold |publisher=EMedicine|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>
