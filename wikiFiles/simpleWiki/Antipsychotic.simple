'''Antipsychotic drugs''' or '''Neuroleptics''' are [[drug]]s that act on the [[central nervous system]], and that usually have [[sedative|sedating]] properties. The name ''neuroleptic'' was introduced in 1955, from the 1990s, the term ''antipsychotic'' is used more frequently. Neuroleptics make the patient calm. Today, they are mostly used for the [[treatment]] of [[psychosis]], as it occurs in [[schizophrenia]] and  [[bipolar disorder]]. They can also be used to treat [[Depression (illness)|depression]] and mood swings. Very strong antipsychotics can be combined with an [[opioid]] to produce a special [[analgesic]]; the patient will be conscious, but heavily [[sedative|sedated]], and feel very little [[pain]].
