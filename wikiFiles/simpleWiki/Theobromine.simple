'''Theobromine''' is a [[chemical substance]], also known as '''xantheose'''<ref name="dictbiochem1943">{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Bio-Chemistry and Related Subjects | author=William Marias Malisoff | year=1943 | publisher=Philosophical Library | pages=311, 530, 573 | isbn = B0006AQ0NU}}</ref> It is an [[alkaloid]]. It occurs in the [[cacao]] plant. Chemically, it is very similar to [[caffeine]].<ref name="dictbiochem1943"/> Because the cacao plant is used to make [[chocolate]] it also occurs in chocolate. Despite its name, there is no [[bromine]]  in it – ''theobromine'' comes from ''Theobroma'', the name of the [[genus]] of the cacao tree, (which itself is made up of the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] roots ''theo'' ("[[God]]") and ''brosi'' ("food"), meaning "food of the gods")<ref name="worldofcaffeine">{{cite book | last = Bennett | first = Alan Weinberg | coauthors = Bonnie K.

Theobromine is a [[water]] [[solubility|insoluble]], [[crystalline]], bitter powder. It colour is listed as either [[white]] or [[colourless]].<ref name="theobromine-chemprops">{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=theobromine&db=* | title=theobromine | publisher=Dictionary.com | accessdate=2007-02-22 }} For convenience, the direct source of the three definitions used has been cited.</ref> It has a similar, but lesser, effect to caffeine, making it a lesser [[homologous series|homologue]]. Theobromine is an [[isomer]] of theophylline as well as [[paraxanthine]]. Theobromine is categorized as a [[methyl|dimethyl]] xanthine,<ref name="omd-theobromine">{{cite web | url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?query=theobromine&action=Search+OMD | title=Theobromine | publisher=On-Line Medical Dictionary | accessdate=2007-02-23 }}</ref> which means it is a [[xanthine]]<ref name="omd-xanthine">{{cite web | url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?xanthine | title=Xanthine | publisher=On-Line Medical Dictionary | accessdate=2007-02-23 }}</ref> with two [[methyl]] groups.<ref name="omd-dimethyl">{{cite web | url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?dimethyl | title=Dimethyl | publisher=On-Line Medical Dictionary | accessdate=2007-02-23 }}</ref>

Theobromine was first isolated from the seeds of the cacao tree in 1878<ref name="drugdiscovery">{{cite book | title=Drug Discovery: A History | author=Walter Sneader | isbn=0471899801 | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=2005}}</ref> and then shortly afterwards was synthesized from xanthine by [[Hermann Emil Fischer]].<ref name="historicalchemistry">{{cite book | title=Essays in Historical Chemistry | author=Thomas Edward Thorpe | year=1902 | publisher=The MacMillan Company }}</ref>
