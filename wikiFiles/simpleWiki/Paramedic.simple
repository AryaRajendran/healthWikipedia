A '''paramedic''' is a [[Human|person]] who works outside a [[hospital]] and goes to help at an [[emergency]]. Paramedics usually get to an emergency in an [[ambulance]]. Paramedics usually work in a [[team]] of two, but sometimes three or four, and they work together to help a hurt person quickly and sometimes take them to a nearby hospital. In many cases, they are also [[firefighter]]s and work from fire engines.

In some countries like the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[United Kingdom]], it is against the law for people to say they are paramedics unless they have special [[training]] and have passed some tests.
