'''Electrology''' is an [[electricity|electrical]] process to remove human [[hair]] so that it does not grow back. An electrologist is sometimes called an electrolysist in the [[United Kingdom]]. The process of removing the hair is referred to as electrolysis. The electrolysist slides a thin metal probe into each [[hair follicle]]. This, if done the right way, does not hurt the skin. Electricity flows to the follicle through the probe. This causes damage to the areas that grow hair so that it does not grow back.
