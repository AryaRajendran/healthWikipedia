A '''sneeze''' is a reaction in the [[nose]] in which [[air]] and [[mucus]] (the liquid found in the nose) are forced out quickly. It often happens after breathing [[dust]] or other small things into the nose. When people sneeze, their [[eye]]s close. This is a natural reflex which keeps the eyes from being bulged by the great [[pressure]] of air which is being released through the [[sinus]] cavity (the area the [[nostril]]s lead into). A common thing to say to people when they sneeze is "Bless you!" or in the [[United States]] sometimes "Gesundheit!" (from [[German language|German]], meaning "Good [[health]]"). There is a story that the blessing started with [[Pope Gregory VII]] (540â€“604&nbsp;AD). He said a blessing might stop people from getting the [[bubonic plague]] which was killing people in [[Rome]] at the time.<ref name="Siy">{{cite book|last=Siy|first=Alexandra|coauthors=Kunkel, Dennis|title=Sneeze!|publisher=Charlesbridge|location=Watertown, MA|date=2007|page=40|isbn= 9781570916533.|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=XPgGBoqt9MUC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=pope+gregory%2Bsneeze&source=bl&ots=41nso8BMX4&sig=cle0s2mxrkDS3MEkVs38EhMZLnk&hl=en&ei=8_rkS42yFZSXkQW0q9Ea&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCcQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=pope%20gregory%2Bsneeze&f=false|accessdate=May 8 2010|language=English}}</ref> When people sneeze the speed is about 150 kilometers per hour or more.
