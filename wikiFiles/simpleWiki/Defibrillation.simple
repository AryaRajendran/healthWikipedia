'''Defibrillation''' is the act of defibrillating the [[heart]] to try [[treatment|treat]] [[ventricular fibrillation]] or pulseless [[ventricular tachycardia]].  Defibrillation works by delivering a controlled [[electric current]] to the heart, which [[depolarisation|depolarises]] a critical mass of the heart muscle, which stops the arrhythmia and allows a coordinated heart rhythm to return.  Defibrillation may be administered outside the body with the use of an [[defibrillator|external defibrillator]] or an [[automated external defibrillator]], or inside the body with an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]].
