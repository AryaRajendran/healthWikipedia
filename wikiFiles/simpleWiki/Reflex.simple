A '''reflex''' is an [[act]] where a [[nerve]] sends an electric impulse to the [[spinal cord]]. After that it comes to the [[muscle]] and the muscle reacts.

A '''reflex action''', also known as a '''reflex''', is an [[involuntary]] and very quick movement in response to a [[stimulus]].<ref>Purves 2004. ''Neuroscience''. 3rd ed, Massachusetts, Sinauer Associates.</ref>  A true reflex is a [[behaviour]] which is mediated via the [[reflex arc]]; this does not apply to casual uses of the term 'reflex'.
