The '''gastrointestinal system''' is the body system that [[eat]]s and [[Digestion|digests]] food; it is also called a '''digestive system'''. By breaking down food into simple [[chemical]]s that can be  [[wikt:absorb|absorbed]] by other parts of the body so the [[chemical]]s can be used for energy and building the body, it also gets rid of waste after digestion. The gastrointestinal system starts at the [[lip]]s and ends at the [[anus]]. Animals like [[worm]]s, [[insect]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], and [[human|people]] all have digestive systems.

The gastrointestinal tract is the ''gut'' and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] that help us digest food.

The gut is the round tubes that food goes through and is digested.
The parts of the [[human]], and some other animals, gut system are:
*[[Mouth]]
*[[Pharynx]]
*[[Oesophagus]]
*[[Stomach]]
*[[Intestine]]s
**[[Small intestine]]
***[[Duodenum]]
***[[Jejunum]]
***[[Ileum]]
**[[Large intestine]]
***[[Cecum]]
***[[Colon]]
*[[Rectum]]
*[[Anus]]

Other organs that are part of the gastrointestinal system but are ''not'' part of the gut are:
*[[Liver]] and [[gallbladder]]
*[[Pancreas]]
*[[Salivary gland]]s, [[lip]]s, [[teeth]], [[tongue]], [[epiglottis]], [[thyroid]], and [[parathyroids]]
Food does not go through these organs. But they help the gut digest the food. They also have other [[work]]. For example the pancreas, thyroid, liver, and parathyroids are also endocrine [[gland]]s that make [[hormone]]s like [[insulin]].

There are many diseases that affect the gastrointestinal system. [[Medical doctor|Doctors]] who study the gastrointestinal tract are called [[gastroenterology|gastroenterologists]].
