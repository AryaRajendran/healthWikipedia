The '''combined oral contraceptive pill''' ('''COCP''') is a [[contraception|contraceptive]] for women. It is often called '''birth control pill''' or simply '''"The Pill."''' The pills contain [[hormone]]s that make the women who take them [[Infertility|infertile]]. Women who take the pill will not become [[pregnancy|pregnant]] during [[sexual intercourse]]. When a woman stops taking the pills, she will usually become fertile again. When taken as prescribed, the pills are one of the safest methods of contraception.

In the 1950s, scientists realized that the [[hormone]] [[progesterone]] stopped women from making [[ovum|eggs]] (stopped ovulation).  After this discovery, the combined oral contraceptive pill was created.<ref name = NEJM>{{cite web|url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/328/21/1543|title = Hormonal Contraception |first = David T. |last = Baird|coauthors = Anna F.

Some oral contraceptive pills have only progesterone. These are often called the "minipill".

In the United States, the combined oral contraceptive pill was first given to women in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/340778|format = abstract|title = The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives and Women's Career and Marriage Decisions|publisher = University of Chicago|work = Journal of Political Economy, 2002, vol. 110, no. 4|first = Claudia |last = Goldin |coauthors = Lawrence F. Katz |date = 2002}}</ref> When a woman uses the Pill in the right way, it works very well to prevent pregnancy. At the same time, it allows the woman and her partner to have sexual intercourse whenever they wish, without reducing the pleasure of sex. For these reasons, the Pill is a very popular method of birth control. Many different pills exist, with different kinds or amounts of hormones.

In 2005, more than <!-- 100 - see talk page --> 80 million women across the world used the Pill.<ref name="uncontraceptiveuse" >{{cite web|author=UN Population Division |year=2006 |title=World Contraceptive Use 2005 |location=New York |publisher=United Nations |id=ISBN 92-1-151418-5 |url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/contraceptive2005/2005_World_Contraceptive_files/WallChart_WCU2005.pdf|format=PDF}} In 2005, there were 1,097,427,000 women in the world between the ages of 15-49, who were married or in union (living with a partner in a marriage-like relationship).  Of these women, 7.5% used the Pill. However, in different countries, there are a lot of differences in how many women use the Pill. For example, in the United States, 15.6% of women in relationships use the Pill. In the United Kingdom, 22% do. In Japan, the Pill is much less common; only 2.3% of women in relationships use either the Pill or an[[IUD]] as well. The numbers for some other countries are: Algeria, 44.3%; Morocco, 40.1%; Zimbabwe, 35.5%; India, 2.1%; Egypt, 9.3%; Vietnam, 6.3%.</ref>

==Different countries use different contraceptives==
The choices a woman has for contraception - and whether contraception is even available - depends on what country she lives in. These things are different in different countries. In the United Kingdom, one out of every 4 women aged 16–49 were using the Pill as at 2006 (either the combined pill or [[progestogen only pill]] ("minipill")).<ref name="taylor">{{cite book |author=Taylor, Tamara; Keyse, Laura; Bryant, Aimee |year=2006 |title=Contraception and Sexual Health, 2005/06 |location=London |publisher=Office for National Statistics |id=ISBN 1-85774-638-4 |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health/contraception2005-06.pdf|format=PDF}} British women aged 16-49: 24% currently use the Pill (17% use Combined pill, 5% use Minipill, 2% do not know type)</ref> compared to only 1% of women in [[Japan]].<ref name="cbs">{{cite news|author=Aiko Hayashi |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> 

Local [[culture]] and habits may also affect whether or not people use the Pill.<ref name="AndeanWomen">{{cite journal|url=http://www.figo.org/docs/World%20Report%20Pages%20357-363.pdf|format=pdf|title=Cultural aspects related to the health of Andean Women in Latin America: A key issue for the attainment of progress towards the Millenium Development Goals|author=AV Camacho and MD Castro and R Kaufman|journal=International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics|year=2006|issue=94|pages=357-363}}</ref><ref name="religiousinfluencesOnContraception">{{cite journal|author=A Srikanthan and  RL Reid|title=Religious and Cultural Influences on Contraception|journal= J Obstet Gynaecol Can|volume=30|issue=2|year=2008|pages=129-137|url=http://www.sogc.org/jogc/abstracts/full/200802_WomensHealth_1.pdf|format=pdf}}</ref> 

In some countries, women do not really have a choice because only one kind of contraception is available.<ref name = popcouncil>{{cite web|url = http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/wp/141.pdf|title = Future Trends in Contraception in the Developing World: Prevalence and Method Mix | first = John |last = Bongaarts| coauthors = Elof Johansson|date = 2000|work = Revised version of a paper prepared for the IUSSP Seminar on “Family Planning Programmes in the 21st Century” at ICDDR,B, Dhaka, January 2000.|publisher = The Population Council (international, nonprofit, nongovernmental organization)|accessdate = 208-11-17}}</ref> In some countries (like [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Zimbabwe]]), the Pill is the most common method offered by national [[family planning]] programs.

Other countries, like [[Egypt]] and [[Vietnam]], only offer the [[Birth control#Intrauterine methods|IUD, intrauterine device]].<ref name="uncontraceptiveuse"/><ref name = popcouncil/>

==Different kinds of pills==
There are two major kinds of oral contraceptive pills. The first kind has both estrogen and progesterone in it. The other only has progesterone (these are called progesterone-only pills, or POPs). The pills do not actually have natural hormones in them. Instead, they have other [[chemical substance]]s that are mostly the same as the hormones, but have been made in a [[laboratory.]] 

Some women can only take one kind of COCP. For example, estrogen stops the [[breast]] from producing milk. Because of this, women who are [[breastfeeding]] should not take pills that have estrogen in them. There are also some other types of women who should not be given estrogen. These women should only use progesterone-only pills.

While there are just two major kinds of birth control pills (COCPs and POPs), there are many different brands or versions of each kind of pill. Every brand of COCP will have the same hormones (estrogen and progesterone) in it. However, each brand has a different amount of hormones in it. Also, some brands change the amount of hormones given from week to week.

== Effectiveness ==
There are two ways to measure how well COCPs work. (Most forms of [[birth control]] are also measured in these two ways.):
*We can look at how well the Pill works in cases of ''perfect use''. This means that the Pill has been used exactly how it is supposed to be used. The women using the Pill are assumed to have made no mistakes in how they used it. (For example, they have taken every dose on time, without missing any doses.)
*We can look at how well the Pill works in cases of ''actual use'' or ''typical use''. Usually, it is not realistic to think that every women uses the Pill perfectly. Some women use the pill the wrong way, miss doses, or stop taking the pill. This makes the Pill's effectiveness (how often it prevents pregnancy) lower.
To show how well the Pill works, scientists figure out rates of effectiveness (for perfect use and for actual/typical use). These rates show how many women are kept from getting pregnant by the Pill. Rates of effectiveness usually look at how well the Pill works during the first year that women are using the Pill.<!--

However, some studies use [[decrement table]]s.<!--

The typical use pregnancy rate for women taking COCPs measures how many women get pregnant while taking COCPs. All women are not equally likely to get pregnant while taking COCPs. Different groups of women have different typical use pregnancy rates. Overall, between 2% and 8% of women taking COCPs get pregnant every year. If COCPs are used perfectly, only 0.3% become pregnant each year.<ref name="hatcher" />

There are a few reasons why women do not use the Pill perfectly. Because of these things, typical use effectiveness is lower than perfect use effectiveness.
* People are not always told how to use the Pill correctly. (For example, they are not given the right information about how often the Pill should be taken.)
* People sometimes make mistakes when they try to use the Pill, without knowing what they have done wrong. (For example, a woman might forget to take the Pill.)
* People sometimes make mistakes on purpose. (For example, a woman might not get new pills from the pharmacy. She might also decide to stop taking the Pill, or skip doses, if she decides she wants to get pregnant.)<ref>They want to get pregnant, put their partner does not want them to</ref>

COCPs can prevent pregnancy if the first pill is taken no later than 5 days after a woman starts [[menstruation|menstruating]]. If the treatment is started at any other time in the [[menstrual cycle]], COCPs cannot safely prevent pregnancy for the first 7 days of use. During this time, a woman needs to use other types of contraception in order to prevent pregnancy. When active pills have been taken for 7 days, COCPs can work well to prevent pregnancy. COCPs should be taken at about the same time every day.<!--

Certain things can make COCPs not work as well:
#If a woman misses more than one active pill in a packet. (Certain packets also contain "placebo pills", which do not have any hormones in them. COCPs are usually used for three weeks out of the month. The woman then takes a break from the pills for a week. Some packets have placebo pills for women to take during this week, so that the woman does not get out of the habit of taking a pill evey day. If a woman does not take placebo pills during this week, it does not make her more likely to get pregnant.)
#If a woman waits more than a week to start taking COCPs (active pills) again, after her week-long break.
#If a woman's body has problems with absorbing active pills (for example, if the woman has [[diarrhea]] or [[vomit]]ing).
#If a woman is taking other medicines which interact with her COCPs to make them not work as well (for example, medicines which lower her estrogen or progestogen levels).<!--

== Problems with other drugs ==
Some other [[medicine]]s can interact with COCPs and make them not work as well. These medicines can also cause [[breakthrough bleeding]] (where a woman bleeds between her periods). Some of these medicines are:
*Some [[antibiotics]] which are used to treat [[tuberculosis]] and [[meningitis]] (like [[rifampicin]])
*Some [[sedative]]s (especially [[barbiturate]]s)
*Some drugs to treat [[epilepsy]] (like [[phenytoin]] and [[carbamazepine]])
*Broad-spectrum [[antibiotic]]s, like [[ampicillin]] and [[doxycycline]]. These medicines may cause problems "by impairing the [[Human flora|bacterial flora]] responsible for recycling [[ethinylestradiol]] from the large bowel" ([[British National Formulary|BNF]] 2003). This means that a person's [[large intestine]] does not take up estradiol the way it should.<!--
  --><ref>The effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics on Combined contraceptive pills is not found on systematic interaction metanalysis (Archer, 2002), although "individual patients do show large decreases in the plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol when they take certain other antibiotics" (Dickinson, 2001). "...experts on this topic still recommend informing oral contraceptive users of the potential for a rare interaction" (DeRossi, 2002) and this remains current (2006) UK [http://www.fpa.org.uk/information/leaflets/documents_and_pdfs/detail.cfm?contentID=130#17 Family Planning Association advice].

The traditional medicinal herb St. John's Wort also seems to make COCPs not work as well. This is because of the way St. John's Wort affects the [[liver]].

== Non-contraceptive uses ==
The Pill can be used for other things besides contraception. There are many medical conditions that are caused by problems with hormone levels. Because the Pill has hormones in it, it can treat these conditions. Some of these conditions are:
*[[Anemia]] caused by menstruation
*Painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea)
*Mild or moderate [[acne]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Huber J, Walch K |title=Treating acne with oral contraceptives: use of lower doses. | journal = Contraception | volume = 73 | issue = 1 |pages=23–9 |year=2006|pmid = 16371290 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2005.07.010 <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->}}</ref>
If a woman's menstrual cycle is not regular, the Pill can make the woman menstruate on a regular schedule. The Pill can also be used to treat certain problems that cause bleeding from the [[uterus]].

Women who use combined oral contraceptives are less likely to get [[ovarian cancer|cancer of the ovaries]]. If a woman takes Pill for five years, her risk for getting ovarian cancer is cut in half. Women taking the Pill are also only half as likely to get [[endometrial cancer]] than women who have never taken the Pill. The longer a woman uses the Pill, the more her risk of getting endometrial cancer drops. However, women who take the Pill have a higher risk of getting [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/oral-contraceptives|title = Oral Contraceptives and Cancer Risk: Questions and Answers|work = National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet|publisher = National Cancer Institute (US Government)|accessdate = 2008-11-27}}</ref>
