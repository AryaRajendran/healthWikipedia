'''Pernicious anemia''' is when a person has less red blood cells because their [[intestine]]s cannot [[absorb]] [[vitamin B12]] properly.<ref name=pmh>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001595/ |title=Pernicious anemia  |first= |last=|work=Pub Med Health|year=8 February 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> A special [[protein]], called intrinsic factor, helps the body get vitamin B12 from food such as meat, [[poultry]] and dairy foods. Intrinsic factor is made by cells in the [[stomach]].<ref name=pmh/> If there is not enough intrinsic factor, the small intestine is unable to get the vitamin B12. There are several causes of pernicious anemia. These include a weakened stomach lining or a problem with the body's [[immune system]] which causes it to attack the intrinsic factor.<ref name=pmh/> In some rare cases is can be passed down through families. Treatment is usually a regular [[injection]] of vitamin B12.<ref name=pmh/>
