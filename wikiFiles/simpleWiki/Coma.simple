'''Coma''' is a [[medicine|medical]] term. It is a state of deep [[unconscious]]ness. People who are in that state can not be woken up. They also do not [[wikt:react|react]] to [[pain]] or [[light]]. Coma can result from various conditions. Some of these are [[intoxication]], [[poison]]s or [[wikt:damage|damage]]s or [[disease]]s of the [[nervous system]]. It can also be the result of certain [[drug]]s. Doctors sometimes put patients that have very bad injuries into a coma. There are different levels of coma. Comas usually do not last more than several weeks, but those several weeks could be [[disaster|disastrous]]. Sometimes only basic bodily [[function]]s are left over. Intensive hospital care is often needed to [[wikt:recover|recover]] some of these functions.
Some comas can last years, but these are usually not woken up from. The family of a coma victim (or whoever has the power of attorney) can sign papers so that they are taken off of life support and die.
