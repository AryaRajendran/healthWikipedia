The [[vulnerability index]] is a tool for finding out who among the street [[homeless]] population needs health care and housing the most.<ref>www.endhomelessness.org/files/2061_file_Kanis_handout_vi101.pdf</ref> It is being used in more and more cities in the USA. Volunteeers conduct a survey of people living in [[homeless]] shelters, [[warming centers]] and people who do not have any housing at all. 

The  vulnerability index is from the work of Dr. Jim O'Connell of [[Boston]]'s Healthcare for the Homeless. He was concerned about the causes of death of unsheltered homeless individuals living on the street. A national drive is underway by [[Common Ground]] to  work with the HUD homeless count. Since communities are doing the count, he believes that is a good time to do the vulnerability index too. <ref>http://www.commonground.org/?page_id=789</ref> Its' people say that using it will help getting needy individuals off the street. <ref>http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/programs/coc/</ref>

The vulnerability index has been tried out in a lot of other places not just the [[East Coast]]. These include [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]<ref>http://www.urbanministrycenter.org/resources/vulnerability-index-fact-sheet</ref>, [[Albuquerque]],New Mexico and [[Santa Monica]], California.<ref>http://vulnerabilityindex.blogspot.com/</ref>
