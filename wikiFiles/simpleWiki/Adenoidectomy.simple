'''Adenoidectomy''' is the process of taking out a person's [[adenoid]]s from the back of their [[throat]] through the process of [[surgery]]. They may be removed for several reasons, including difficulty breathing through the nose and having ear infections. The surgery is common in young kids. The procedure is usually performed using a substance called [[anaesthesia]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "without [[sensation]]"), and the substance puts a person to sleep when it is applied. Recovery time from the operation can vary from several hours to a few days.

Adenoidectomy is usually done on young children because their adenoids were infected by a [[virus]]. If the disease was to be left alone, it would worsen. The affected person could have harder times breathing or hearing, and may possibly be [[kill]]ed from the disease. Normally functioning adenoids help maintain the body's healthy [[immune system]] during early childhood. They shrink when a person gets older. When a person becomes an [[adult]], their adenoids completely disappear.
