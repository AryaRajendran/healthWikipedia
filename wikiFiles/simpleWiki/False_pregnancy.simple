A '''false pregnancy''', '''hysterical pregnancy''' or '''pseudopregnancy''' is when a [[mammal]] shows some of the symptoms associated with a [[pregnancy]], but without being pregnant. False pregnancies commonly occur in [[dog]]s and [[mouse|mice]]. False pregnancy in humans is less common, and usually has [[psychology|psychological]] causes. False pregnancy is probably caused by changes in the [[endocrine system]] of the body, which leads to the [[secretion]] of hormones. These hormones are the reason physical changes happen, similar to those during pregnancy. The underlying cause is often mental.<ref>[http://www.falsepregnancy.net/ False Pregnancy In Women] Retrieved on 2010-01-19</ref>
