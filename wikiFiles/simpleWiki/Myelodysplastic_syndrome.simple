The '''Myelodysplastic syndrom''' is a group of [[disease]]s and [[condition]]s that affect how [[blood]] is made. These diseases were formerly known as '''preleukemia''', mostly because sometimes they can lead to [[leukemia]]. Often, its name is shortened to '''MDS'''. 

Myelodysplastic syndromes affect the [[bone marrow]] [[stem cell]]s. The production of blood does not rely on good stem cells, but ones that have been modified [[gene]]tically. This means that the production of [[red blood cell]]s, sometimes of [[white blood cell]]s and [[blood platelet]]s changed. The production becomes inefficient, or goes wrong altogether. Most of the time, this manifests in [[anemia]] - not having enough blood. Depending on the severity of the condition, it can also cause [[hemorrhage]]s and [[infection]]s with [[fever]].

Most of the people who have these conditions are 60 years or older, but younger people can get it too, especially if they went through a form of [[chemotherapy]]. Most of the suffers die from the disease, usually after six to thirty months. The only known [[cure]] is a [[stem cell transplant]]. About a third of those suffering contract leukemia within a few months to a few years.
