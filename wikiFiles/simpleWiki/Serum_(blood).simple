'''Serum''' is a clear, yellowish coloured fluid which is part of the [[blood]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/blackmed/serum |title=Serum |first= |last=|work=Black's Medical Dictionary, 42nd Edition |year=2010 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> It does not contain white or red [[blood cell]]s or a [[clotting factor]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/collinsbiology/blood_serum_or_serum |title=blood serum or serum |first= |last= |work=Collins Dictionary of Biology |year=2005 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> It is the [[blood plasma]] without the [[fibrinogen]]s. Serum includes all [[protein]]s not used in [[blood clotting]] (coagulation) and all the [[electrolyte]]s, [[antibodies]], [[antigen]]s, [[hormone]]s, and any extra substances such as [[drug]]s and [[microorganism]]s).

The study of serum is [[serology]]. Serum is used in many medical [[diagnostic test]]s, as well as in [[blood typing]].

[[Blood]] is [[centrifuge]]d to remove cellular components. Anti-coagulated [[blood]] yields [[Blood plasma|plasma]] containing [[fibrinogen]] and [[clotting factor]]s. Coagulated [[blood]] (clotted blood) yields serum without [[fibrinogen]], although some clotting factors remain.

Serum is an important part of the self-renewal of [[embryonic stem cells]] when combined with the cytokine [[leukemia inhibitory factor]].
