'''Gut flora''' consists of [[microorganisms]] that live in the [[digestive system]] of animals. It is the largest reservoir of [[microbe]]s in the [[human microbiome]]. 

The [[human body]], consisting of about 100 [[trillion]] [[cell (biology)|cells]], carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the [[intestine]]s.<ref name="Björkstén">{{cite journal |author=Björkstén B, Sepp E, Julge K, Voor T, Mikelsaar M |title=Allergy development and the intestinal microflora during the first year of life |journal=J.

Research suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely [[commensalism|commensal]] (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a [[symbiotic]] relationship.<ref name=Sears/>  Though people can survive without gut flora,<ref name=Steinhoff/> the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as [[Fermentation|fermenting]] unused energy substrates, training the [[immune system]], preventing growth of harmful, pathogenic bacteria,<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/> regulating the development of the gut, producing [[vitamin]]s for the host (such as biotin and [[vitamin K]]), and producing [[hormone]]s to direct the host to store fats.  However, in some conditions, some species can cause [[disease]] by producing an [[infection]] or increasing [[cancer]] risk for the host.<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/><ref name="University of Glasgow"/>

Over 99% of the bacteria in the gut are [[anaerobic]],<ref name="Guarner and Malagelada 2003b"/><ref name=Sears/><ref name="University of Glasgow"/><ref name="Beaugerie L and Petit JC"/><ref name=Vedantam>{{cite journal |author=Vedantam G, Hecht DW |title=Antibiotics and anaerobes of gut origin |journal=Curr.

The traditional view is that no [[metazoa]]n [[phylum]] can break down [[cellulose]] by producing the [[enzyme]] cellulase. Instead, herbivores contain, in their gut, microorganisms which produce cellulase.<ref>Cleveland L.R. 1923. Symbiosis between termites and their intestinal protozoa.
