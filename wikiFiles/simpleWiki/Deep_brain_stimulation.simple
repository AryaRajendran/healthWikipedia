'''Deep Brain Stimulation''' ('''DBS''') is a [[surgery]] when [[doctor|doctors]] put [[electronics|electronic]] equipment inside a [[patient|patient's]] [[brain]]. The electronic equipment sends signals to specific parts of a person's brain. DBS is used to [[therapy|treat]] many [[disease|diseases]]. DBS has been used to treat [[pain disorder]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Major depressive disorder]], [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and [[Tourette syndrome]]. <ref name="Translational principles of DBS">{{cite web|last=Kringelbach|first=Morten L.|title=Translational principles of deep brain stimulation|work=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|coauthors=Jenkinson, Ned; Owen, Sarah L.F.; Aziz, Tipu Z.|pages=623–635|doi=10.1038/nrn2196|date=1 August 2007}}</ref> The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved DBS as a treatment for [[tremor|tremors]] in 1997, for [[Parkinson's disease]] in 2002<ref name=USDHHS>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/NEW00580.html FDA approves implanted brain stimulator to control tremors.] Retrieved October 18, 2006.</ref>, Tourette syndrome in 1999<ref name=stereo>{{cite web|last=Vandewalle|first=V|title=Stereotactic treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome by high frequency stimulation of thalamus|work=The Lancet|coauthors=van der Linden, Chr; Groenewegen, HJ; Caemaert, J|pages=724|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)05964-9|date=1 February 1999}}</ref> ,  and dystonia in 2003<ref>[http://knbc-tvhealth.ip2m.com/index.cfm?pt=itemDetail&item_id=97349&site_cat_id=470 'Brain pacemaker' treats dystonia.] KNBC TV, April 22, 2003.

==Applications==
===Parkinson's Disease===
[[Parkinson's disease]] is a [[neurology|neurological]] [[syndrome]] characterized by  [[tremor]], [[hypokinesia]], [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], and [[balance disorder|postural instability]].<ref name=Aminoff_2005>{{cite book | author = Aminoff MJ, Greenberg DA, Simon RP | title = Clinical Neurology | publisher = Lange: McGraw-Hill Medical | edition = 6th | pages = 241–5 |year = 2005 | isbn = 0-07-142360-5 }}</ref>  DBS does not cure Parkinson's, but it can help reduce symptoms and improve the patient’s life.<ref>Kleiner-Fisman G, Herzog J, Fisman DN, et al. "Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation: summary and meta-analysis of outcomes." ''Mov Disord''. 2006 Jun;21 Suppl 14:S290–304 PMID 16892449</ref> DBS is only used for patients whose symptoms cannot be controlled with medications.

DBS was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Parkinson's in 2002.<ref name=USDHHS/> DBS carries the risks of major surgery, with a complication rate related to the experience of the surgical team.  The major complications include hemorrhage (1–2%) and infection (3–5%).<ref>Doshi PK. "Long-term surgical and hardware-related complications of deep brain stimulation". ''Stereotact Funct Neurosurg'' (2011). '''89''':2, 89–95. PMID 21293168 </ref>

===Major depression===
Deep brain stimulation has been used in a few patients to treat [[major depressive disorder]](MDD).<ref name=Anderson>Anderson, R. J., Frye, M. A., Abulseoud, O. A., Lee, K. H., McGillivray, J. A., Berk, M., & Tye, S. J. (2012). "Deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression: Efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action". ''Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews''. 36(8), 1920–1933. PMID 22721950. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.06.001</ref> It is hard to find a good target in the brain for DBS because there are few patients that have had DBS for MDD.<ref name=Anderson>Anderson, R. J., Frye, M. A., Abulseoud, O. A., Lee, K. H., McGillivray, J. A., Berk, M., & Tye, S. J. (2012). "Deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression: Efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action". ''Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews''. 36(8), 1920–1933. PMID 22721950. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.06.001</ref>

A study of DBS for major depressive disorder and [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) looked at 23 patients — nine for OCD, seven for MDD, and one for both. It found that "about half the patients did show dramatic improvement" and that there were few side effects and complications.<ref name=Lakhan>Lakhan SE, Callaway H. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2838907/?tool=pubmed "Deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder and treatment-resistant depression: systematic review".] ''BMC Research Notes''. 2010 Mar 4;3(1):60. {{DOI|10.1186/1756-0500-3-60}} PMID 20202203</ref>

DBS for treatment resistant depression can be as effective as [[antidepressant|antidepressants]], but side effects and complications need to be watched. Common side effects for DBS for MDD include [[infection]], [[headache]], bad [[mood]], and [[suicide|suicidal thoughts]].<ref name=Moreines>Moreines JL, McClintock SM, Holtzheimer PE.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023999/?tool=pubmed "Neuropsychologic effects of neuromodulation techniques for treatment-resistant depression: a review".] ''Brain Stimul''. 2011 Jan;4(1):17-27. PMID 21255751</ref>

===Tourette syndrome===

In 1999, DBS was approved for [[Tourette syndrome]] - an [[hereditary disease|inherited]] [[neurology|neurological]] [[disease|disorder]] <ref>{{cite web|last=Vandewalle|first=V|title=Stereotactic treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome by high frequency stimulation of thalamus|work=The Lancet|coauthors=van der Linden, Chr; Groenewegen, HJ; Caemaert, J|pages=724|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)05964-9|date=1 February 1999}}</ref>. Deep brain stimulation is used to treat patients with severe Tourette syndrome when [[medication]] does not help the patient. Many patients have fewer [[symptoms]] after DBS <ref name=Mayo>{{cite web|last=Savica|first=Rodolfo|title=Deep Brain Stimulation in Tourette Syndrome: A Description of 3 Patients With Excellent Outcome|work=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|coauthors=Stead, Matt; Mack, Kenneth J.; Lee, Kendall H.; Klassen, Bryan T.|pages=59–62|doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.08.005|date=1 January 2012}}</ref>. In some patients, the DBS is only put on one side of the brain. This can reduce symptoms and patients may have fewer side effects when the stimulation is only put on one side of the brain <ref>{{cite web|last=Kuhn|first=J|title=Clinical effectiveness of unilateral deep brain stimulation in Tourette syndrome|work=Translational Psychiatry|coauthors=Bartsch, C; Lenartz, D; Huys, D; Daumann, J; Woopen, C; Hunsche, S; Maarouf, M; Klosterkötter, J; Sturm, V|pages=e52|doi=10.1038/tp.2011.51|date=1 November 2011}}</ref>. 

There are two places in the brain where the stimulation is placed. The stimulation is either put in the [[thalamus]]<ref name="Ackermans 2011">{{cite web|last=Ackermans|first=L.|title=Double-blind clinical trial of thalamic stimulation in patients with Tourette syndrome|work=Brain|coauthors=Duits, A.; van der Linden, C.; Tijssen, M.; Schruers, K.; Temel, Y.; Kleijer, M.; Nederveen, P.; Bruggeman, R.; Tromp, S.; van Kranen-Mastenbroek, V.; Kingma, H.; Cath, D.; Visser-Vandewalle, V.|pages=832–844|doi=10.1093/brain/awq380|date=24 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=unfavorable /><ref name=Mayo /><ref name=Kuhn>{{cite web|last=Kuhn|first=J|title=Clinical effectiveness of unilateral deep brain stimulation in Tourette syndrome|work=Translational Psychiatry|coauthors=Bartsch, C; Lenartz, D; Huys, D; Daumann, J; Woopen, C; Hunsche, S; Maarouf, M; Klosterkötter, J; Sturm, V|pages=e52|doi=10.1038/tp.2011.51|date=1 November 2011}}</ref> or the [[globus pallidus pars interna]]<ref name=cannon>{{cite web|last=Silburn|first=Peter|title=Deep Brain Stimulation of Anteromedial Globus Pallidus Interna for Severe Tourette's Syndrome|work=American Journal of Psychiatry|pages=860|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.11101583|date=1 August 2012}}</ref> <ref name=hwynn>{{cite web|last=Hwynn|first=Nelson|title=Improvement of Both Dystonia and Tics With 60 Hz Pallidal Deep Brain Stimulation|work=International Journal of Neuroscience|coauthors=Tagliati, Michele; Alterman, Ron L.; Limotai, Natlada; Zeilman, Pamela; Malaty, Irene A.; Foote, Kelly D.; Morishita, Takashi; Okun, Michael S.|pages=519–522|doi=10.3109/00207454.2012.683219|date=1 September 2012}}</ref>.

===Other medical applications===

====Alzheimer disease====
In 2012, a literature review showed some slowed onset of [[dementia]] and [[memory|memory loss]] in six [[Alzheimer's disease]] patients who had DBS<ref name=alzh>{{cite web|last=Oluigbo|first=C. O.|title=Deep Brain Stimulation for Neurological Disorders|work=IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering|coauthors=Salma, A.; Rezai, A. R.|pages=88–99|doi=10.1109/RBME.2012.2197745|date=1 January 2012}}</ref>. 

====Trauma/coma====
In August 2007, US scientists used DBS on a 38-year-old man who was in a [[coma]] for six years because of a [[trauma|head injury]]<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070730/full/448522a.html Implant boosts activity in injured brain.] ''Nature'' news (August 1, 2007). Retrieved on August 1, 2007</ref>. The patient was able to wake up, open his eyes, and turn his head in response to talking. After more DBS, the patient could name objects and use his hands. He could also drink liquid and eat food by mouth<ref>Schiff N. D. et al. "Behavioural improvements with thalamic stimulation after severe traumatic brain injury". ''Nature''. 448, 600–3. (2007) PMID 17671503</ref>. Although DBS has worked for some patients with head injuries, DBS may not work for every patient with serious head injury and/or coma.

====OCD==== 
DBS has been used to treat [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD)<ref>Nuttin B, Cosyns P, Demeulemeester H, Gybels J, Meyerson B (1999). "Electrical stimulation in anterior limbs of internal capsules in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder". ''Lancet''. 1999 Oct 30;354(9189):1526 PMID 10551504</ref>  The use of DBS for OCD is one of the most successful uses of DBS for any disease. It is not understood why DBS is so successful for OCD<ref name=Benabid>Benabid AL, Wallace B, Mitrofanis J, Xia R, Piallat B, Chabardes S, Berger F. (2005). "A putative generalized model of the effects and mechanism of action of high frequency electrical stimulation of the central nervous system". ''Acta Neurol Belg''. 2005 Sep;105(3):149–57. PMID 16255153</ref>. 

==Possible complications and side effects==
DBS is helpful for some patients, but other patients have side effects and complications. Patients may experience side effects of apathy, [[hallucination|hallucinations]], [[addiction]] to [[gambling]], [[hypersexuality]], [[Cognition|cognitive]] problems, and [[Clinical depression|depression]]. However, these may be temporary and related to correct placement and calibration of the stimulator. Some side effects can go away after some time.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Burn D, Troster A| title = Neuropsychiatric Complications of Medical and Surgical Therapies for Parkinson's Disease | journal = Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology| volume = 17| issue = 3 | pages = 172–180 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15312281 | doi = 10.1177/0891988704267466}}</ref>.

Because the brain can move a little during surgery, there is the possibility that the electrodes can move out of place. This may cause more complications like personality changes. Electrode movement is easy to find using a [[Computed tomography scanner|CT scan]].
There may also be complications of surgery, such as bleeding within the brain. <ref name="Ackermans 2011">{{cite web|last=Ackermans|first=L.|title=Double-blind clinical trial of thalamic stimulation in patients with Tourette syndrome|work=Brain|coauthors=Duits, A.; van der Linden, C.; Tijssen, M.; Schruers, K.; Temel, Y.; Kleijer, M.; Nederveen, P.; Bruggeman, R.; Tromp, S.; van Kranen-Mastenbroek, V.; Kingma, H.; Cath, D.; Visser-Vandewalle, V.|pages=832–844|doi=10.1093/brain/awq380|date=24 February 2011}}</ref>.

In an rare case, a patient with severe Tourette's Syndrome had very severe side effects and complications. The patient suffered from [[tetanus|opisthotonus]]- when the muscles are contracted without the patient's control. The patient later died from other [[infection|infections]]  <ref name=unfavorable>{{cite web|last=Duits|first=A.|title=Unfavourable outcome of deep brain stimulation in a Tourette patient with severe comorbidity|work=European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry|coauthors=Ackermans, L.; Cath, D.; Visser-Vandewalle, V.|pages=529–531|doi=10.1007/s00787-012-0285-6|date=24 May 2012}}</ref>.
