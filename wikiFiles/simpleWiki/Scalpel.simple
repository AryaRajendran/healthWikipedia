A '''scalpel''' is a very sharp [[knife]], made to be used for [[surgery]]. Scalpels were developed for cutting through [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. In 2013, most scalpels used for surgery had [[blade]]s which are only used once. The blade is replaced after use. Sometimes, the lower part of the scalpel is re-used. The blades are made of different kinds of [[metal]] or [[steel]]. In some cases, [[titanium]], [[diamond]] or [[obsidian]] are used. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] uses [[magnetism]] to generate an image. This means that people performing operations in such an environment cannot use metal tools. In some cases, scalpels are replaced with [[laser]]s, or with [[electrocautery]]. [[Ancient Egyptian medicine]] used scalpels for [[enbalming]]; the material used was obsidian, it is still in use today. [[Medicine in ancient Rome]] used over 150 different tools, among them, the scalpel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1572030/Roman-ruins-cast-new-light-on-a-trip-to-doctor.html |title=Roman ruins cast new light on a trip to doctor |newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk |date= December 9, 2007 |accessdate= }}</ref>
