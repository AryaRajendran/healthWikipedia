'''Mirex''' is a chlorinated hydrocarbon that was commercialized as an [[insecticide]]. It was later banned because it was harmful to the environment. This white crystalline odorless solid is a derivative of [[cyclopentadiene]]. It was popularized to control [[fire ants]] but by virtue of its chemical robustness and [[lipophilicity]] it was recognized as a [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulative]] pollutant. However, the spread of the [[red imported fire ant]] was actually encouraged by the use of Mirex, as it also kills native ants that are highly competitive with the fire ants. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] prohibited its use in 1976.<ref name=Ullmann>Robert L.
