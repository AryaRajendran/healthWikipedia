'''Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults''' ('''LADA''') is very similar to both [[diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]]: although the disease is autoimmune, [[insulin resistance]] accompanies the disease as it does Type 2 diabetes.<ref name=Jenny20080512>{{cite web |author=Jenny |date=12 May 2008 |title=The LADA Epidemic.

Most [[wikt:latent|latent]] autoimmune diabetic people are thin, although there are many people that are overweight to slightly obese who have the LADA.<ref>{{cite report|title=LADA/Insulin Resistance|publisher=Diabetes Health|url=http://www.diabeteshealth.com/read/2007/05/07/5173/insulin-resistance-leads-to-lada-latent-autoimmune-diabetes-in-adults/ |accessdate=April 10, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=Jenny20080512>{{cite web |author=Jenny |date=12 May 2008 |title=The LADA Epidemic.

People with LADA are misdiagnosed as having Type 2 diabetes, except that LADA has GAD antibodies. Contrary to the popular belief, some people with latent autoimmune diabetes do have family histories of Type 2 diabetes involving their parents, sister, brother, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults|publisher=American Diabetes Association|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/2/245.full | accessdate=Jan. 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is LADA|url=http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=27869&a=73748&l=en |accessdate=22 November 2009 }}</ref><ref name=diaclin.26.1.44>{{cite journal |doi=10.2337/diaclin.26.1.44 |title=Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults and Pregnancy: Foretelling the Future |year=2008 |last1=Dunn |first1=J.

==Prognosis and treatment==
People with LADA usually control their diabetes using very similar methods and [[Healthy lifestyle|changes of lifestyle]] to Type 2 diabetes: [[Healthy diet|eating right]], [[Exercise|exercising]] and oral [[medication]]s; [[weight loss]] is optional. Unlike Type 2 diabetics who might never need to inject [[insulin]], however, the LADA patients become insulin dependent within several years. By contrast only 20% to 30% of those with Type 2 diabetes eventually become insulin dependent (i.e., inject insulin).<ref>{{cite report|title=LADA: A Little Known Type of Diabetes|publisher=Pharmacy Times|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/issue/pharmacy/2009/october2009/FeatureFocusLADA-1009 | accessdate=January 27, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LADA|publisher=Action LADA|url=http://www.actionlada.org | accessdate=April 22, 2010}}</ref>

==Genes and antibodies==
There are [[glutamic acid]] decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies connected with the latent autoimmune diabetes. There are also TCF7L2 genes associated with Type 2 diabetes which are also connected with LADA.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is LADA|publisher=Blood Sugar 101|url=http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/18382053.php | accessdate=Sunday, November 22, 2009 }}</ref>

==Complications==
The [[complication]]s of latent autoimmune diabetes of adults are highly similar to those for types 1 and 2 diabetes: [[stroke]], [[heart disease]], [[gangrene]], [[Kidney failure|kidney trouble]], [[heart attack]]s, etc.
