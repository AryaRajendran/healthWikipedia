'''Repetitive strain injury (RSI)''', also known as '''occupational overuse syndrome''', is a medical condition affecting the [[muscle]]s and [[nervous system]]. It is usually caused by doing the same thing repeatedly or without breaks. Using a computer for long periods of time is a common way of causing this problem. 

Repetitive strain injury is described as a sudden, intense pain in affected parts of the body, often the [[wrist]]s, [[neck]], [[back]] or [[hand]]s, that keeps coming back. It is different from more specific [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]], because RSI does not have an easily found cause. The pain is often spread across different muscle groups and inspection of the affected area usually cannot show any differences from that of a healthy person. Because of this, treatment for RSI is usually limited to rest and exercises, and sometimes wearing a [[brace]].
