The '''savant syndrome''' is a rare condition in which people with neurodevelopmental disorders, notably [[autism spectrum]] disorders, and/or brain injuries, demonstrate profound and [[child prodigy|prodigious]] capacities and/or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal. In spite of the name [[syndrome]], it is not recognized as a [[mental disorder]], or as a part of mental disorder. In simple terms these are very gifted individuals with fewer than 50 alive today.

==Characteristics==
These individuals in some cases may not be able to tie their shoes, however they may memorize and entire book in days.
