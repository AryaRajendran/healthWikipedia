'''Leptospirosis''' (also known as '''Weil's disease''', '''canicola fever''', '''canefield fever''', '''nanukayami fever''' or '''seven day fever''') is a [[infectious disease|bacterial]] disease. It is caused by [[spirochaete]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Leptospira]]''. This bacterium affects [[human]]s and many animals, including [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s, and [[reptile]]s. It was first described by [[Adolf Weil (physician)|Adolf Weil]] in [[1886]]. At the time he reported an "acute infectious disease with enlargement of [[spleen]], [[jaundice]] and [[nephritis]]". The [[pathogen]], ''Leptospira''-genus [[bacteria]] was isolated in [[1907]] from a [[post mortem]] [[kidney]] slice.

Leptospirosis is a relatively rare bacterial [[infection]] in humans. The infection is commonly transmitted to humans by allowing [[fresh water]] that has been contaminated by animal [[urine]] (often from [[rat]]s) to come in contact with the [[skin]], [[eye]]s or with the [[mucous membrane]]s. 

It usually causes heart failure, kidney failure or liver failure, and most sufferers die if they are not treated urgently. The disease causes little concern, as it is quite rare
 
Except for tropical areas, Leptospirosis seems to occur most often in the months August to September, in the Northern Hemisphere.
