[[Image:Hypertrophy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Normal cells (A), Hypertrophy (B), Hyperplasia (C) and combination (D).]]'''Hypertrophy''' (from Greek ὑπέρ "excess" + τροφή "nourishment") is the increase in the [[volume]] of an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] due to the enlargement of its component [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. It should be distinguished from ''hyperplasia'', in which the cells remain approximately the same [[size]] but increase in [[number]]. Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together, such as in the case of the [[hormone|hormonally]]-induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the [[uterus]] during [[pregnancy]].

One of the two most common and visible forms of organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to [[strength training]] or [[bodybuilding]].
