The '''fibula''' is one of the two [[bone]]s which make up the lower leg (humans), or back leg in [[tetrapod]]s. The other one is the [[tibia]]. Above them is the [[knee]] and [[femur]]; below are the [[feet]]. Muscles are attached to the top of the fibula which help move the knee. It is also used to support the knee and the tibia.
