[[File:Deodorant.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of deodorant]]
'''Deodorant''' is anything that takes away an odor, or bad [[Odor|smell]]. Often, it means something people put on their [[body|bodies]] so their [[sweat]] does not smell as bad. The most commonly used deodorants are for use on the [[armpit]]s. These are also '''anti-perspirants''' because they reduce the production of sweat. There are deodorants for other places on the body as well. Deodorant can be sold in the form of [[sprays]], bottles, or sticks that are rolled onto the body.
