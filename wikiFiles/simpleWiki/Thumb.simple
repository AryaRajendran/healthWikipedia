[[File:Thumbup.jpg|thumb|right|Thumb]]
The '''thumb''' is one of the five fingers on the human [[hand]]. Thumbs are different from the other four fingers because they are in a different [[direction]], have only 2 [[bone]]s (the others have 3), and are shorter. Thumbs allow us to pick things up. This is called having "opposable thumbs". Thumbs have an [[artery]] in them. Arteries have a [[pulse]]. This is why we should not take other peoples' pulses with our thumbs.
