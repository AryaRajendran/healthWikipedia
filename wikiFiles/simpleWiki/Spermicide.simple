'''Spermicide''' is a substance that kills [[sperm]] before it can enter the [[vagina]].  When a spermicide is used as the only form of [[contraception]], the pregnancy rate is much higher than it is when other contraceptives are used.  Spermicides are normally used with [[barrier contraception]], such as [[condom]]s, [[cervical cap]]s, diaphragms, and [[contraceptive sponge]]s.
