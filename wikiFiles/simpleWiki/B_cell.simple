'''B cells''' are [[lymphocytes]], a type of [[white blood cell]]. Once the B cell is activated, it turns into a plasma cell,<ref>Plasma cell = cell which makes antibodies</ref> and starts producing [[antibodies]]. They are a vital part of the [[adaptive immune system]]. They have a [[protein]] on the B cell's [[Cell membrane|outer surface]] known as a 'B cell receptor'. This allows a B cell to bind to a '''specific''' [[antigen]].

The main functions of B cells are:
#to make [[antibody|antibodies]] against [[antigen]]s, 
#to perform the role of [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs), 
#to develop into memory B cells after activation by antigen interaction. 

Recently, a new, suppressive function of B cells has been discovered.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-074934 |title=Immune regulatory function of B Cells |year=2012 |last1=Mauri |first1=Claudia |last2=Bosma |first2=Anneleen |journal=Annual Review of Immunology |volume=30 |pages=221â€“41 |pmid=22224776}}</ref> 

In mammals, immature B cells are formed in the [[bone marrow]].<ref>Alberts B. ''et al'' 2002. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mboc4&part=A4422 ''Molecular biology of the cell'']. Garland Science: New York, pg 1367.</ref>
