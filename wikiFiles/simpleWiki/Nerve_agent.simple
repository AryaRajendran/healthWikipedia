'''Nerve gas'''  or '''nerve agent''' is the name of a family of chemical [[poison]]s. Usually people call them ''nerve agents'', they do not need to be a gas. They are often used during [[war]]s. They work by changing the way the [[nerve]]s work in the human body. Messages from the [[brain]] are no longer transmitted to the [[muscle]]s and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.

Since they are [[chemical weapon]]s, they are classified as [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] by the [[United Nations]] according to [[UN Resolution 687]]. It is forbidden to stockpile or to produce them since 1993. 

People who are subjected to such nerve agents most often die, or bear [[mutilation]]s and [[scar]]s for life.
