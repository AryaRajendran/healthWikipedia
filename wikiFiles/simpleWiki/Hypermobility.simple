'''Hypermobility''' refers to when [[human]] [[joint]]s stretch further than is usual. For example, certain people can bend their [[thumb]]s back to their [[wrist]], their [[toe]]s backwards, put their leg behind their heads or any other ways of unusual performances. This condition can affect a particular joint or multiple joints throughout the human body. Hypermobility often results from one or more body issues: misaligned joints, abnormally shaped ends of one or more bones near a joint or other body issues. The same defect also results in weaker than normal bones, which may lead to [[osteoperosis]] or bone fracture. This condition is often described with the term ''double jointed''. Some people that are hypermobile carry no other health matters.
