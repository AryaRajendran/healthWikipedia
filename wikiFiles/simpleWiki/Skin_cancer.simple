'''Skin cancer''' is the term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the [[skin]]. In everyday use, people often talk about [[melanoma]], but there are other forms of skin cancer, too. These are usually named after the type of [[cell]] that grows uncontrollably. Most skin cancers develop in the [[epidermis]]. Very often a [[tumor]] can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease.<ref name = "NCI">National Cancer Institute - Common Cancer Types (http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/commoncancers)</ref>, though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive.<ref>[http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/skin/survival/ CancerStats - Skin cancer survival], Cancer Research UK</ref>

Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than [[lung cancer|lung]], [[breast cancer|breast]], [[colorectal cancer|colorectal]], and [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="NCI" /> Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious â€” for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths.<ref>[http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/skin/ CancerStats - Skin Cancer statistics UK]Cancer Research UK</ref> It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15-34 in the UK.<ref>[http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/news/archive/pressrelease/2011-04-06-two-young-adults-diagnosed-skin-cancer-each-day Two young adults diagnosed with skin cancer each day], Cancer Research UK press release, 6th April 2011</ref>  Most cases are caused by over-exposure to [[Ultra-violet|UV]] rays from the sun or [[sunbeds]].<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112688770/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0]</ref> Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers.  The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas. These are usually localized growths caused by excessive cumulative exposure to the sun and do not tend to spread.
