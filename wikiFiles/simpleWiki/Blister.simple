'''Blisters''' are small pockets of [[fluid]] in an upper layer of the skin caused by [[friction]], [[burn]]ing or [[freezing]]. Most blisters are filled with a clear fluid called [[serum]] or [[plasma]] (blister water). Some blisters, however, are filled with [[blood]]; they are called blood blisters.
