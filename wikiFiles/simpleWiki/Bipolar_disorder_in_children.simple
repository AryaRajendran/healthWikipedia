'''Bipolar disorder in children''', more well known as '''pediatric bipolar disorder''', is a very serious condition that affects [[child]]ren and [[teenager|adolescents]]. Identifying [[bipolar disorder]] for children and teenagers may be challenging-certain symptoms are very different from adults. Children and teens often have [[depression|depressed]] moods mixed with mania taking place almost every day and sometimes at exactly the same time. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is controversial, however. This condition often leads to impairments of daily function, and people with bipolar disorder which is prior to 18 years of age are far more likely to commit [[suicide]]. Pediatric bipolar disorder is far more acute in children and youth than in the adult population, with diagnoses at very early age. In children or teens, mania often has serious psychotic troubles with mixed mania and depression episodes which are worse and for more erratic times than in adults. Certain medications for this condition may have strong side effects for those under 18. Most bipolar children have [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]].
