'''2-1-1''' is a special [[telephone number]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It was made to be easy to remember. Calling the number lets people get information quickly about health [[organization]]s. It can also be called in an [[emergency]].

==History==
[[New York Telephone]] (now part of [[Verizon]]) used the 2-1-1 number for many years. It was an automatic, meaning it worked by itself, number for phone numbers that were dialed wrongly. 2-1-1 was used this way from the [[1970s]] through the early [[2000s]]. 

The city of [[Atlanta]] started a new way of using 2-1-1 in [[1997]]. This new way of using it was similar to how it is used now. After Atlanta, many other cities and states started to use it as a special number to call in an emergency. [[5-1-1]] is also used for this.
