A '''hysterectomy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὑστέρα}} ''hystera'' "womb" and {{lang|grc|ἐκτομία}} ''ektomia'' "a cutting out of") is [[surgery]] to remove the [[womb]]. This is usually done by a [[gynecologist]]. 
Women who undergo a hysterectomy can no longer bear children. Since the womb also produces [[hormone]]s their hormone levels change. Hysterectomies are done for only a few, very specific conditions, including:
* Certain forms of [[cancer]] of the reproductive system (affecting womb, [[cervix]], [[ovary|ovaries]]), or [[tumor]]s
* For [[transsexual]] men, as part of the gender transformation
