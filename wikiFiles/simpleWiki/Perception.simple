In [[psychology]] and the [[cognitive science]]s, '''perception''' is the process of getting, interpreting, selecting, and organizing [[sense|sensory]] [[information]].<ref>The word ''perception'' comes from the Latin ''perception-, percepio'' and means "receiving, collecting, action of taking possession, apprehension with the mind or senses."—OED.com.</ref> 

Methods of studying perception range from essentially  [[biology|biological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] approaches, through [[psychology|psychological]] approaches through the [[philosophy of mind]] and in [[empiricist]] [[epistemology]], such as that of [[David Hume]], [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], or as in [[Merleau Ponty]]'s affirmation of perception as the basis of all science and knowledge.

== History of the study of perception == 
Perception is one of the oldest fields within scientific psychology, and there are correspondingly many theories about its underlying processes.  The oldest quantitative law in psychology is the [[Weber-Fechner law]], which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of physical stimuli and their perceptual effects.  It was the study of perception that gave rise to the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] school of psychology, with its emphasis on [[holism|holistic]] approach.
