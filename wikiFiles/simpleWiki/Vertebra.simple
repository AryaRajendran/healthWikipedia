'''Vertebrae''' (singular: '''''vertebra''''') are the individual [[irregular bone]]s that make up the [[spinal column]] (''aka'' ischis) â€“ a flexuous and flexible column.
There are normally thirty-three (33) vertebrae in humans, including the five that are fused to form the [[sacrum]] (the others are separated by [[intervertebral disc]]s) and the four [[coccyx|coccygeal]] [[bone]]s which form the ''tailbone''.
The upper three regions comprise the remaining 24, and are grouped under the names ''cervical'' (7 vertebrae), ''thoracic'' (12 vertebrae) and ''lumbar'' (5 vertebrae), according to the regions they occupy.
