'''Paralysis''' is the complete loss of [[muscle]] function for one or more muscle groups, when the thing that is '''paralysed''' cannot move. 

Paralysis is most often caused by damage to the [[nervous system]] or [[brain]], especially the [[spinal cord]]. Major causes are [[stroke]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[botulism]], [[spina bifida]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[Guillain-Barr√© syndrome]]. Partial paralysis can also occur in the REM stage of [[sleep]] (see:[[Sleep paralysis]]). Paralysis often includes loss of feeling in the affected area.
