'''Chorea''' (sometimes called '''Choreia''') is the name for a set of [[symptom]]s which characterise a number of [[neurology|neurological condition]]s. The term is derived from Greek, where it means [[dance]]; there is also a dance with the name. People with the disorder move involuntarily. The movements seem to progress from one [[muscle]] to the next. Chorea is one of the main features of [[Huntington's disease]]. Some forms of chorea are not linked to neurological conditions though: Chorea can develop as a [[complication]] of [[pregnancy]], or be a sign of [[Hyperthyroidism]]. It can also result of [[drug]]s taken in the wrong dose; this is the case of [[L-Dopa]] (taken against [[Parkinson's disease]]), certain forms of [[birth control|hormonal contraception]] or  certain [[Antipsychotic]]s, amongst others.
