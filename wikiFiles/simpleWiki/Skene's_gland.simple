'''Skene's glands''' (also called '''lesser vestibular glands''' or '''paraurethral glands''') are [[gland]]s in the upper [[wall]] of the [[vagina]]. They empty into the [[urethra]]. Their location is known as the [[Gr√§fenberg spot]]. In males, their [[homologue]] is the [[prostate gland]].

The glands are named after the person who described them first, [[Alexander Skene]]. He was a [[physician]].
