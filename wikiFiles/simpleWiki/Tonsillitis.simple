'''Tonsillitis''' is a [[disease]]. The [[tonsil]]s in the [[mouth]] get [[inflammation|inflamed]], and grow red. This may cause a [[sore throat]] or a [[fever]]. Usually the inflammation goes away on its own, but if it does not the tonsils may have to be [[surgery|surgically]] removed. This operation is called a ''tonsillectomy''.

The disease is caused by certain [[virus]]es most of the time, but can also be caused by [[bacteria]]. It easily spreads between humans. The most important thing is to treat sore throat (pharyngitis) if it is caused by bacteria called streptococcus, with antibiotic for 10 days.
