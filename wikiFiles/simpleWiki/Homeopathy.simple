The basic theory behind Homeopathy is that a sick person can be healed using the rebound effect of a substance that produces the [[symptom]]s of  the [[illness]] in a healthy person.

The solutions in homeopathy are prepared in such a way that, for most of them, it is unlikely that anything from the original substance is still there.  Homeopaths claim that the solution carries a memory of the original substance, but according to science, it is really unlikely that this memory exists or that homeopathy will help people's health.<ref name=NatureWhenToBelieve>{{cite journal|title=When to believe the unbelievable|journal=Nature|volume=333|issue=30|pages=787|year=1988|doi=10.1038/333787a0}}</ref><ref name="shang">{{cite journal |author=Shang A, Huwiler-Müntener K, Nartey L, ''et al.'' |title=Are the clinical effects of homoeopathy placebo effects?

It is prepared by adding lots of water to a substance, shaking it, then taking a small amount of that water, adding it to more water, shaking that, and repeating that over and over, up to 200 times in some homeopathic remedies. Hahnemann said this would bring out the "spirit-like medicinal powers held within a drug".<ref>[http://www.hpathy.com/philosophy/hahnemann-organon261to270.asp ''Organon of Medicine,''] Samuel Hahnemann, combined 5th/6th edition</ref> However, modern science shows how many [[atoms]] or [[molecules]] - tiny things that cannot be divided up any more - existed in the original substance being diluted.

Most [[scientist]]s believe that homeopathy does not work, because its ideas go against those of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name="Weissmann">{{cite journal |author=Weissmann G |title=Homeopathy: Holmes, Hogwarts, and the Prince of Wales |journal=FASEB J. |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1755–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16940145 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/full/20/11/1755 |doi=10.1096/fj.06-0901ufm}}</ref>

Homeopathy became popular because it was created at a time when medicine did not work very well and could make people sicker.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=2260507&pageindex=1#page British Medical Journal: Blood-letting], page 283, [[March 18]] [[1871]], retrieved on [[March 21]] [[2008]]</ref> Back then, taking homeopathy, might have kept people from getting hurt by bad doctors. However, medicine has improved since then, and now helps people  a lot more than it hurts people. So while most people think using homeopathy won't hurt you, if you go to a homeopath instead of a qualified medical doctor, it may keep you from getting help that could save your life. Homeopaths have also been known to tell their patients not to take medicines like [[antibiotic]]s and [[vaccine]]s that could cure (or keep them from getting) [[:wikt:dangerous|dangerous]] diseases.<ref name="pmid9243229">{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=The attitude against immunisation within some branches of complementary medicine |journal=Eur.

Homeopaths view illness as a systemic condition, a disturbance in the overall homeostasis of the total being and accordingly, consider that almost ''any'' sick person, may benefit from proper homeopathic treatment. <blockquote>"homeopathy is designed to treat the whole person and can therefore be considered in almost any situation where a person's health is depleted." <ref>[http://www.trusthomeopathy.org/about_homeopathy/which_conditions_is_it_used_for/ British Homeopathic Association]</ref></blockquote>
