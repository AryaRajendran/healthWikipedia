A '''fever''' is when a person's body temperature is hotter than 37.5 degrees [[Celsius]] (99.5 [[Fahrenheit]]). Normal body temperature for humans varies based on a variety of factors, including age and level of physical activity.<ref>[http://firstaid.webmd.com/body-temperature WebMD Body Temperature</ref>  It is typically cited as 37 degrees Celsius (98.6&nbsp;F), but naturally varies from person to person by at least .5 degrees Celsius. The actual measurement of body temperature will vary based on the location of the measurement.  For a temperature taken from under the [[tongue]], the measurement may be lower. [[Rectal]] temperatures will read about 0.3&nbsp;C (0.55&nbsp;F) higher, and armpit temperatures will read about the same amount lower.

When people are ill, their body's [[immune system]] fights the [[disease]], and so the body temperature rises. Fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs: the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises.

About 38&nbsp;°C (100.4&nbsp;F) degrees is called a low-grade fever, and above 39&nbsp;°C (103&nbsp;F) degrees is a high-grade fever.

[[Child]]ren usually have a higher fever than adults; their immune system is less mature. Infants have the highest normal temperature, which decreases as people age. Some animals, especially small ones like [[rabbit]]s and [[cat]]s, also have a higher normal temperature than humans.

Sometimes, high-grade fever can be a [[medical emergency]]. At or above 42&nbsp;°C (107.6&nbsp;F) organs start taking damage that may not be repairable. While most fevers are caused by [[Infection]], whether bacterial or viral, some fevers can be caused by cancers, including [[leukemia]],<ref>[http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/all_page?item_id=7026 Leukemia &nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society]</ref> [[lymphoma]],<ref>[http://lymphoma.about.com/od/symptoms/tp/warningsigns.htm Warning Signs of Lymphoma - First Signs of Lymphoma]</ref> and [[renal cell carcinoma]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281340-overview Medscape: Medscape Access] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/63t69BTpq|date =2011-12-12}}</ref>
