A '''pharmacy''' is a [[shop]] where [[drug|therapeutic drugs]] are sold. Sometimes a pharmacy is also called a  ''drug store''. The people working in a pharmacy are called [[pharmacist]]s or [[chemist]]s (British English). These people can recognise simple [[diseases]] and give [[drug]]s for some of them.

Certain drugs are special, because they can be [[addiction|addictive]], or they change the way other drugs act, or they need to be taken in a special way. These drugs cannot simply be bought at a pharmacy. A [[prescription]] is necessary to get them. Medical doctors give out prescriptions, which can then be used to get the drug.

Many pharmacies do not sell drugs only. They also sell [[beauty products]] and [[hygiene]]-related products, like [[tampon]]s for women and [[contraception|contraceptives]].

Pharmacy is also a branch of [[chemistry]] that studies the molecular structure of drugs to find better drugs.
