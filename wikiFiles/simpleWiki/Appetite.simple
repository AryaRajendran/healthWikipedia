'''Appetite''' is wanting to eat [[food]], the feeling of [[hunger]]. [[Human]]s and [[animal]]s have appetite to make sure that they eat enough food to survive. A loss of appetite is also called [[anorexia]] (this is not the same as the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]]).

Appetite can change when people are [[illness|ill]], when they have [[eating disorder]]s and when they are on different types of [[medication]]s. A big appetite can make somebody eat more than they need to, and they can put on weight, even becoming [[obese]]. A small appetite can make someone eat less than they need to, making them lose weight or become [[malnutrition|malnourished]].
