'''Thalidomide''' is a [[drug]]. It can be used as a [[sedative]]. It also has uses for other illnesses. 

It was mainly prescribed to [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women in the 1950s and 1960s, until it was found to be a '''teratogen''' (that is: birth deformity causing substance). The drug can cause [[birth defect]]s in [[rat]]s, [[primate]]s and [[human]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drugsafetysite.com/thalidomide|title=Thalidomide: Drug safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding}}</ref> Before the drug was released, not enough tests were done, so this was unknown. About 10,000 children were born with deformities, between 1956, and 1962. These could be directly linked to the fact that their mothers had taken the drug during their pregnancy.<ref name =Bren> {{cite news | first =Linda | last =Bren | author = | coauthors = | title =Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History | url =http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | work =FDA Consumer | publisher =US [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date =[[2001-02-28]] | accessdate =2006-09-21 }}</ref> After this discovery, more rigorous tests were required in the United States, before a drug can be said to be safe to take during pregnancy.<ref name =Burkholz>{{cite news | first =Herbert | last =Burkholz | title = Giving Thalidomide a Second Chance | url =http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/1997/697_thal.html | format = | work =FDA Consumer | publisher =US [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date =[[1997-09-01]] | accessdate =2006-09-21 }}</ref> Other countries made similar laws. Thalidomide was not used as a drug for decades.

Researchers continued to look for ways to use the drug. They discovered that it had good effects on certain types of skin diseases, associated with [[leprosy]]. Currently, studies are being done to see how this drug could help with [[cancer]] treatment, as well as some other, less-known diseases. It has been used in [[Multiple myeloma]] treatment with success.<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/thalidomide-comeback0500</ref>
