'''Cervical cancer''' is [[cancer]] of the [[cervix]] or cervical area that can result in [[malignant|malignance]] and [[death]]. One sign of the cancer is [[blood|bleeding]] or [[discharge]] from the [[vagina]]. Sometimes, there are no symptoms until the cancer is very developed. For this reason, [[pap smear]]s have become common to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] this cancer. They have made the cervical cancer rate drop 50 percent.{{fact|date=July 2010}}

To treat the cancer, one can get [[surgery]] in the beginning and [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] if the cancer is far along. Most types of cervical cancer can be prevented by a [[vaccine]]. It prevents the types of [[HPV]] that cause 70% of cervical cancer.<ref name='FDA Licenses New Vaccine'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=FDA Licenses New Vaccine for Prevention of Cervical Cancer | date=[[2006-06-08]] | publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | url =http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01385.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | language = }}</ref><ref name="pmid16670757">{{cite journal | author = Lowy DR, Schiller JT | title = Prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccines. | journal = J.
