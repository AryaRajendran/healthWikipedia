'''Leukodystrophies''' are disorders which affect the [[white matter]] of the [[brain]] and the [[nervous system]]. Nerves are surrounded by [[fat]]ty cover of a substance called [[myelin]]. In a leukodystrophy, there are problems with the growth or the development of  this cover. This affects the function of the respective nerve. Myelin is made of at least ten different chemicals. Leukodystrophy is a gene defect. As a result of this defect, one of the molecules that make up myelin cannot be synthesized as it should.
