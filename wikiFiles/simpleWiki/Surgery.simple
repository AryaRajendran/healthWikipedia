'''Surgery''' is an [[operation]] that involves a [[Medical doctor|doctor]]. The doctor helps his [[wikt:patient|patients]] by taking out, changing or fixing parts of the [[human]] [[body]]. Doctors who do surgeries are called '''surgeons'''. Many surgeons are experts in certain areas; for example, a surgeon that operates on [[bone]]s is called an [[orthopaedic]] (orth-o-pae-dic) surgeon.

Surgery (operations) can be very simple, like taking a [[teeth|tooth]] out. Surgery can also be very complicated, like surgery to remove a [[cancer]].

Operating rooms have to be very clean places. The doctors and [[nurse]]s go to great lengths to keep the room clean where the surgery is done. Regular cleaning of the room and its tools is done to keep everything clean and [[germ]]-free.

Everyone in the operating room must wear special [[clothing|clothes]], [[hat]]s, [[shoe]]s, [[gown]]s, [[glove]]s and [[mask]]s that are clean and germ free. The only people allowed in the operating rooms are the doctors and nurses as well as the patient too.

When people have operations they are normally put to sleep with [[anaesthesia]]. When the patients are asleep, they cannot feel anything.

In recent years, many patients that cannot get the required surgery in their own country, or find the costs too high, travel to another country for medical care. This is called [[Medical Tourism]].
