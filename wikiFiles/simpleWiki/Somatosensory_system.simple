The ''''''somatosensory system'''''' is a [[sensory system]] that detects experiences labelled as touch or [[pressure]], [[temperature]] (warm or cold), [[pain]] (including [[itch]] and [[tickle]]) and those that belong to [[proprioception]]. These are the sensations of [[muscle]] movement and [[joint]] position including [[posture]], [[movement]], visceral (internal) senses and [[facial expression]]. [[Visceral senses]] have to do with sensory information from within the body, such as [[stomach]] aches.

Touch may be considered one of five human [[sense]]s; however, when a person touches something or somebody this gives rise to various [[touch|feeling]]s: the [[perception]] of [[pressure]] ([[shape]], [[soft]]ness, [[texture]], [[oscillation|vibration]], etc.), relative [[temperature]] and sometimes [[pain]]. Thus the term "touch" is actually the combined term for several senses. In medicine, the colloquial term "touch" is usually replaced with '''somatic senses''', to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved.
