An '''insecticide''' is a [[poison]] made to kill [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s.

Insects are very tough [[animal]]s that have adapted to a great variety of settings. Therefore, the poison used to kill them is also deadly to [[human]]s. There can be great danger of eating pesticide when you have vegetables. This is why often people will rub an [[apple]] on their jumper before eating it. This adds a nice shine to the apple and rubs away the pesticides. If you do not clean the jumper there is a risk pesticide might build up.
