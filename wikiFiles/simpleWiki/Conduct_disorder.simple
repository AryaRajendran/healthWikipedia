'''Conduct disorder''' (CD) is a [[mental disorder]] in which a person [[habit]]ually, deliberately violates the [[Human rights|rights]] of others. They are typically [[Aggression|aggressive]] and threaten to hit people. [[Kleptomania|Habitual stealing]] is common; some people with CD are sex offenders. They do not feel bad or guilty about hurting people, and often enjoy doing so. Many people with CD go on to develop [[antisocial personality disorder]]. The CD affected person finds that acting out gives them [[attention]] (even though it is negative attention they are receiving) and in turn they feel it gives them a sense of [[importance]]. Some risk factors are [[child neglect]] and the loss of family member and or parent. Anti-[[psychotic]] therapy is recommended in cases where the offender is psychotic.
