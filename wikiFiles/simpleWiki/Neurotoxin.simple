A '''neurotoxin''' is a [[toxin]] that acts specifically on nerve cells – [[neuron]]s – usually by interacting with [[membrane protein]]s and [[ion channel]]s. 

Many of the [[venom]]s and other toxins that organisms use in defense against [[vertebrate]]s are neurotoxins. A common effect is [[paralysis]], which sets in extremely rapidly. The venom of [[bee]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[pufferfish]], [[spider]]s and [[snake]]s can contain many different toxins. Many neurotoxins act by affecting voltage-dependent ion channels.
