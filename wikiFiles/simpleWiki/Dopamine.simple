'''Dopamine''' is a [[neurotransmitter]]. Many different kinds of [[animal]]s and [[human]]s use it to transmit [[information]]. It is used when the brain sends signals to the muscles in the body to make them move. It can make a person feel happy. 

Dopamine is an important chemical found in the brain. If the brain does not make enough dopamine, it causes an illness called [[Parkinson's disease]]. This can be treated by giving the Parkinson's disease patient a drug called [[L-Dopa]], which the body converts to dopamine.
