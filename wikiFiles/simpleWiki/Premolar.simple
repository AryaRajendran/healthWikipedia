The '''premolar''' [[teeth]] of [[mammal]]s are the teeth between the [[Canine tooth|canines]] and the [[molar]]s. There are at most a total of eight of them. The number is reduced in the [[dental formula]] of many species.

As the name suggests, they are like smaller molars, and their function is to crush  and grind food.
