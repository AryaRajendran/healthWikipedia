'''Gerontology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: γέρων, ''geron'', "old man" and -λογία, ''-logy'', "study of") is the study of the [[social]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Biology|biological]] aspects of [[Ageing|aging]]. It is distinguished from ''geriatrics'', which is the branch of [[medicine]] that studies the [[disease]] of the [[elderly]].[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth II]] born 21 April 1926.]] 

Gerontology includes these and other endeavors:
*investigating the aging process itself (''biogerontology'');
*investigating the interface of normal aging and age-related disease (''geroscience'');
*investigating the effects of our aging [[population]] on society, including the fiscal effects of [[pension]]s, entitlements, life and health [[insurance]], and [[retirement]] planning;
*applying this knowledge to policies and programs, i.e. government planning or running a nursing home.

== Biogerontology ==
''Biogerontology'' is the subfield of gerontology dedicated to studying the biological processes of aging. It includes ''Biomedical gerontology,'' also known as ''experimental gerontology'' and ''life extension'', is a sub discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow, prevent, and even reverse aging in both [[humans]] and [[animals]]. Curing age-related diseases is one approach, and slowing down the underlying processes of aging with the help of [[exercise|physical exercises]] is another. Most "life extensionists" believe the human life span can be altered within the 21st century.

== Social gerontology ==
''Social gerontology'' is a multi-disciplinary sub-field that specializes in studying or working with older adults. Social gerontologists may have degrees or training in social work, [[nursing]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], demography, gerontology, or other [[social science]] disciplines. Social gerontologists are responsible for [[Education|educating]], researching, and advancing the broader causes of older people by giving informative presentations, publishing books and articles that pertain to the aging population, producing relevant films and television programs, and producing new graduates of these various disciplines in college and university settings.
