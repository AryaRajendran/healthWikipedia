A '''facelift''' is technically known as a '''rhytidectomy'''. Rhytidectomy actually means surgical removal of wrinkles. Rhytidectomy is a type of cosmetic surgery procedure used to give a more young appearance. Rhytidectomy usually involves the removal of excess facial skin and the redraping of the [[skin]] on the [[patient]]'s [[face]] and [[neck]]. The tightening of underlying tissues of the face is optional. Nearly 112,955 face lift procedures were performed in the United States in the year 2010 alone according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. <ref>http://www.plasticsurgery.org/news-and-resources/statistics.html</ref>
