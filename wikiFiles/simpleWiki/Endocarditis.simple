'''Endocarditis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the inner layer of the [[heart]]. Endocarditis most often affects the [[heart valve]]s. The heart valves are a part of the [[human]] [[body]] that does not get blood. This is odd because they are a part of the heart itself. Because of this, if one of the valves gets [[infection|infected]] with a [[bacteria]] or [[protozoa]], the body can not defend itself against that bacteria. This can cause the valve to not work the way it should.
