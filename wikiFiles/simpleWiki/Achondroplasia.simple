'''Achondroplasia''' is a form of [[Dwarfism]]. It is part of the [[chondrodystrophies]] or [[osteochondrodysplasias]] family which makes bones in a human's [[skeleton]] be too short or grow too slowly. It often affects the [[femur]] and [[humerus]]. It is caused by a [[dominant allele]]. That means only one parent has to have the gene. This gives a child a 50% chance of getting the condition. If both parents have the gene the chances are increased to 75%, but it is very unlikely that the child would live more than a few months. However, the condition can also occur without either parent having the gene. Achondroplasia is caused by a change in the [[DNA]] for [[fibroblast]] growth factor receptor 3. This change affects the making of [[cartilage]]. Now that the part of the DNA that causes the condition is known, there is hope that new treatments may be developed.
