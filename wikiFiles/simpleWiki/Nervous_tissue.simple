'''Nervous tissue''' is the main part of the [[nervous system]] â€“ the [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], and [[nerve]]s. These control the body functions. It is made up of [[neuron]]s, which transmit impulses, and the [[neuroglia]] cells, which help propagation of the [[nerve impulse]] as well as provide food to the neuron.
