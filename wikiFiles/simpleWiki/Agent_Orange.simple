'''Agent Orange''' is a very powerful [[herbicide]] that was used in the [[Vietnam War]]. It is a [[defoliant]] that [[destroy]]ed [[forest]]s. It was used by the [[United States]] [[military]] so their [[enemy|enemies]] had no place to hide.

==Problems==
The problem with Agent Orange is that when it is released, some [[dioxin]]s are also generated. Dioxins have many problems: It takes a long time until they are eliminated from the environment. They are very [[toxic]], and cause [[gene|genetic modifications]] and [[cancer]].
