'''Polychlorinated biphenyls''' (often shortened to '''PCBs''') are [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[chemical compound]]s that contain [[chlorine]] [[atom]]s. They were used in [[industry|industrial]] chemistry, and to make certain [[transformer]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[cooling fluid]]s. The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] declared them to be among the worst chemical polluants. Their use has been banned worldwide, since 2001. The mode of action of these substances is similar to that of [[dioxin]]. 

Polychlorinated biphenyls were widely used, and they can be found in the atmosphere, the soil, and the bodies of water anywhere on the earth. In the short term, these substances are not very [[toxic]], but they accumulate in the body. They are [[teratogen]]s, and may cause [[cancer]].
