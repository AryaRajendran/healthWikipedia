The '''rectum''' is a part of the large intestine which forms a part of the [[gastrointestinal system]]. The rectum ends in the anus which is the end of the gastrointestinal system. It is where [[feces]] or stools are stored temporarily before coming out of the [[anus]].

[[Body temperature]] can also be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting a [[medical thermometer]] not more than 25&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;inch) into the rectum via the [[anus]]. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38&nbsp;°C (97.6 to 100.4&nbsp;°F) and is about 0.5&nbsp;°C (1&nbsp;°F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1&nbsp;°C (2&nbsp;°F) above [[axillary|axilla]] (armpit) temperature.
