'''Heartburn''' is an [[wikt:uncomfortable|uncomfortable]] feeling in the [[chest]] that happens when [[acid]]s from the [[stomach]] travel up the [[esophagus]] (the tube leading from the [[mouth]] to the stomach). When stomach acids hurt the lining of the esophagus, the feeling is a [[symptom]].<ref>PubMed Health, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001311/  "Gastroesophageal reflux disease ... GERD,"] August 11, 2011; retrieved 2012-1-27.</ref> 

The burning sensation is commonly called "heartburn," but it has nothing to do with the [[heart]].<ref>WebMD, [http://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/heartbrun-and-gerd  "Heartburn and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)"]; retrieved 2012-1-27.</ref>

The symptom may be helped by taking [[antacid]]s, such as [[calcium carbonate]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]].<ref>Mayo Clinic, [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR602357 Antacid (Oral Route)]; retrieved 2012-1-27.</ref>
