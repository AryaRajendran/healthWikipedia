'''Psychopathy''' is a [[mental illness]]. It is generally seen as a type of [[antisocial personality disorder]]. Psychopaths are [[emotion|unemotional]]. They do not care about the emotions or rights of others. They show almost no [[empathy]], and do not try to conform to social [[norm]]s. They lack a [[conscience]] and do not feel [[guilt]] or [[remorse]]. Many psychopaths are [[charm]]ing and often manage to have superficial ties with other people, which they use to [[psychological manipulation|manipulate]] people for their own benefit. Psychopaths often show other antisocial behaviour as well, including [[sadism]], [[violence]] and [[deception]]. They are very [[selfish]] and discard people whom they have no further use for. They tend to have many children by many partners.

There are efforts to use [[behaviour therapy]] to treat psychopaths; very often, this is done in [[prison]]s. 

Popular science also labels other characters as ''psychopaths'': These have no problems with social norms, but they are good at influencing people.
