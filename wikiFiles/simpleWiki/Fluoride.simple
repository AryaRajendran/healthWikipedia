'''Fluoride''' is the [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] form of [[fluorine]]. When fluorine gains an [[electron]] by taking it from another substance ([[oxidation|oxidizing]] it), it converts into fluoride. Fluoride is found in [[toothpaste]] and helps prevent tooth [[wikt:decay|decay]]. Fluoride is added [[artificial]]ly to drinking water in some places and has caused a [[controversy]] over the harmful effects versus the benefits of [[fluoridation]].
