'''Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs''' (often shortened to '''NSAIDs''') are [[drug]]s that have [[analgesic]] or [[fever]]-reducing properties, but that are not based on [[steroid]]s. Higher doses of such drugs can also be used to fight [[inflammation]]. Such drugs are special as they are not [[narcotic]], that is they don't induce sleep. Well-known examples of such drugs are [[aspirin]], [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]].
