'''Hydrofluoric acid (HF)''' is a [[solution]] of [[hydrogen fluoride]] in [[water]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.2090259 | year = 2005 | month = Nov | author = Ayotte, P; HÃ©bert, M; Marchand, P | title = Why is hydrofluoric acid a weak acid? | volume = 123 | issue = 18 | pages = 184501 | pmid = 16292908 | journal = [[J. Chem. Phys.]]}}</ref> Its chemical formula is HF. It is a weak [[acid]], but very corrosive and extremely toxic. It can dissolve [[glass]] to make [[hexafluorosilicic acid]]. If it gets on the skin, it can kill you. It is made by reacting [[fluorite]] with [[sulfuric acid]]. It is used in the processing of [[petroleum]]. It is also used to make various other chemicals containing fluorine, such as [[teflon]] (the coating in a frying pan), [[freon]] (the cooling agent in an [[air conditioner]]), and [[fluorocarbon]]s (used as propellants in aerosol cans). It is used to clean metals. It is very toxic because it bonds with [[calcium]] [[ion]]s in the body and makes them so they cannot be used. As an acid, it can be [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] to produce [[fluoride]]s, which are also the [[salt]]s of hydrofluoric acid.

If someone gets Hydrofluoric acid on them, medical attention is necessary, as just small amounts are very toxic.
