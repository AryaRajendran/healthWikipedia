 The Francis Crick Institute is a planned biomedical research centre being built for 2015 in London, United Kingdom. The Francis Crick Institute is a partnership between Cancer Research UK, Imperial College London, King's College London, the Medical Research Council, University College London (UCL) and the Wellcome Trust. It will be the biggest centre for biomedical research and innovation in Europe.

The Francis Crick Institute, (formerly the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation) will be located in a new state-of-the-art 79,000 square metres building to be built next to St Pancras International railway station in the Camden area of Central London. Construction began in July 2011, with researchers expected to be able to start work in 2015. Construction and fit-out of the building is budgeted at approximately £600 million. Once up and running the Francis Crick Institute is planned to have 1,500 staff, including 1,250 scientists, and an annual budget of over £100 million. It is named after British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine with James Watson and Maurice Wilkins. In February 2005 it was announced that the Medical Research Council's National Institute for Medical Research would relocate to UCL. The creation of the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation (UKCMRI) was announced by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Gordon Brown MP, on 5 December 2007. It was announced on 15 July 2010 that Nobel laureate Sir Paul Nurse would be the first Director and Chief Executive of the UKCMRI. He took up his post on 1 January 2011. On 20 October 2010 the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne confirmed that the British Government would be contributing £200 million towards the capital cost of the Centre. On 11 November 2010 Cancer Research UK, the Medical Research Council, UCL and the Wellcome Trust signed an agreement to establish the UKCMRI as a charitable foundation, subject to the agreement of the Charity Commission. On 15 April 2011 it was announced that Imperial College London and King's College London would be joining the UKCMRI as partners and had both signed a memorandum of understanding to commit £40 million each to the project. On 25 May 2011 it was announced that the UKCMRI would be renamed the Francis Crick Institute in July to coincide with ground being broken on the construction of its building, in honour of the British scientist Francis Crick. Laing O'Rourke are carrying out the construction work. In July 2011 the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation was renamed the Francis Crick Institute,. The Francis Crick Institute is a registered charity in England and Wales no. 1140062 and a company registered in England and Wales no.06885462, with its registered office at 215 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE.
