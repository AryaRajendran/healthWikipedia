 In medicine, the Golden S sign is a sign seen on imaging of the chest that suggests a central lung mass or lung collapse. It was first described by Golden in 1925 in association with bronchial carcinoma, but it is also seen in metastatic cancer, enlarged lymph nodes, and collapse of the right upper lobe of the lung. The Golden S sign can be seen on plain radiographs as well as on computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest. The sign is seen in the right lung as a distorted minor fissure, whose lateral aspect is concave inferiorly and whose medial aspect is convex inferiorly. This produces a "reverse S" appearance, responsible for the sign being occasionally called the reverse S sign of Golden.
