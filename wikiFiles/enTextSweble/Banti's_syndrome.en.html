 Banti's syndrome (also known as Banti's disease) is a chronic congestive enlargement of the spleen resulting in premature destruction of the red blood cells by the spleen. However, the term Banti's syndrome is a term that was used in the past (but isn't any longer) to describe patients with splenomegaly, hypersplenism and portal hypertension without cirrhosis and without occlusion of the portal venous system. It is named for Guido Banti. The basic pathology is some kind of obstructive pathology in the portal, hepatic or splenic vein that causes obstruction of venous blood flow from the spleen towards the heart. The cause of such obstruction may be abnormalities present at birth (congenital) of certain veins, blood clots, or various underlying disorders causing inflammation and obstruction of veins (vascular obstruction) of the liver. Enlargement of spleen, ascites, jaundice, and the result of destruction of various blood cells by spleen – anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal tract bleeding – may constitute the presenting symptoms.
