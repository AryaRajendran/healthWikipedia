 Focal neurologic signs also known as focal neurological deficits or focal CNS signs are impairments of nerve, spinal cord, or brain function that affects a specific region of the body, e.g. weakness in the left arm, the right leg, paresis, or plegia. Focal neurological deficits may be caused by a variety of medical conditions such as head trauma, tumors or stroke; or by various diseases such as meningitis or encephalitis or as a side effect of certain medications such as those used in anasthesia. Frontal lobe signs usually involve the motor system, and may include many special types of deficit, depending on which part of the frontal lobe is affected: Parietal lobe signs usually involve somatic sensation, and may include: Temporal lobe signs usually involve auditory sensation and memory, and may include: Occipital lobe signs usually involve visual sensation, and may include: Damage to the Limbic System involves loss or damage to memory, and may include: Cerebellar signs usually involve balance and coordination, and may include: Brainstem signs can involve a host of specific sensory and motor abnormalities, depending on which fiber tracts and cranial nerve nuclei are affected. Spinal cord signs generally involve unilateral paralysis with contralateral loss of pain sensation
