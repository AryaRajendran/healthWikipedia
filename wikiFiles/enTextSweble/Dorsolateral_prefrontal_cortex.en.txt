 The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC or DLPFC) is an area in the primate brain. It is, according to a more restricted definition, roughly equivalent to Brodmann areas 9 and 46. According to a broader definition, DL-PFC consists of the lateral portions of Brodmann areas 9 â€“ 12, of areas 45, 46, and the superior part of area 47. These regions mainly receive their blood supply from the middle cerebral artery. With respect to neurotransmitter systems, there is evidence that dopamine plays a particularly important role in DL-PFC. DL-PFC is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, and to a variety of brain areas, which include the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (specifically, the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex, including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas. DL-PFC is the last area, 45th, to myelinate in the human cerebrum. DL-PFC serves as the highest cortical area responsible for motor planning, organization, and regulation. It plays an important role in the integration of sensory and mnemonic information and the regulation of intellectual function and action. It is also involved in working memory. However, DL-PFC is not exclusively responsible for the executive functions. All complex mental activity requires the additional cortical and subcortical circuits with which the DL-PFC is connected. Damage to the DL-PFC can result in the dysexecutive syndrome, which leads to problems with affect, social judgement, executive memory, abstract thinking and intentionality. The DL-PFC may also be involved in the act of deception and lying, which is thought to inhibit normal propensity to truth telling. Research suggests that using TMS on the DL-PFC can hamper a person's ability to lie, or indeed to tell the truth. More recent research has found a connection between the DL-PFC and lucid dream states in which executive function is retained.
