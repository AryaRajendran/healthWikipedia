 The Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine is located at 34th and Civic Center Blvd, on the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center, on the campus of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The $302-million project was designed by Rafael Vi√±oly Architects and completed in 2008. It is the largest capital project ever undertaken by the University of Pennsylvania Health System. The Center is home to Penn Medicine's Abramson Cancer Center, radiation oncology, cardiovascular medicine and an outpatient surgical pavilion. One of the most important parts of the Center for Advanced Medicine is the Roberts Proton Therapy Center which houses the largest proton therapy center associated with a medical center in the world. The proton therapy center will be used by both the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, as well as the Penn Health System to treat cancer patients. Of noted importance is center glass atrium which delivers daylight throughout the building. This design element is part of a patient-focused mission that seeks to coordinate diagnosis and treatment within a healthy setting. In addition to providing patient-focused design and care, the Perelman Center's is designed to anticipate and respond to future trends in medicine. Penn plans for the Perelman Center will accommodate the rapid increase in outpatient surgery and house the most advanced medical technology available.
