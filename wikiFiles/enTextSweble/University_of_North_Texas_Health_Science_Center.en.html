 The University of North Texas Health Science Center, commonly known as the UNT Health Science Center and abbreviated UNTHSC, is a graduate-level institution of the University of North Texas System. The 1,949-student, 33-acre campus opened in 1970 and is located in the Cultural District of Fort Worth, in the U.S. state of Texas. The UNT Health Science Center comprises the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (TCOM), the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, the School of Public Health, the School of Health Professions, the UNT System College of Pharmacy, plus other centers and institutes. UNT Health at UNTHSC is the TCOM faculty practice program providing direct patient care. UNT Health handles over 600,000 patient visits annually. The group's 170 physicians practice in 40 medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties, including allergy/immunology, family practice, cardiology, neurology, obstetrics & gynecology, oncology, orthopedics, psychiatry, sports medicine and neurosurgery. Research centers and institutes at UNTSHC include the Cardiovascular Research Institute (CRI), the Center for Commercialization of Fluorescence Technologies (CCFT), the Focused on Resources for her Health Education and Research (FOR HER), the Institute for Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research (IAADR), the Institute for Cancer Research (ICR), the Institute of Applied Genetics (IAG), the North Texas Eye Research Institute (NTERI), the Osteopathic Research Center (ORC), the Texas Prevention Institute (TPI), the Center For Community Health (CCH), the Primary Care Research Center (PCRC), and The Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD). The UNT Center for Human Identification, which is housed at UNTHSC, analyzes DNA samples from both unidentified remains as well as reference samples submitted by family members of missing persons to law enforcement agencies nationwide. It also conducts all DNA analysis for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Center is the only academic center in the U.S. with access to the FBI’s next-generation CODIS 6.0 DNA Software. UNTHSC also manages the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) for the U.S. Department of Justice. UNTHSC serves as home to several National Institutes of Health-funded research programs and currently leads all Texas health science centers in research growth. The Health Science Center also houses laboratories for TECH Fort Worth, a non-profit business incubator for biotechnology. Community and school outreach programs include Fort Worth’s annual Hispanic Wellness Fair and the annual Cowtown Marathon, which were founded by UNTHSC. The Health Science Center participates in 10 state and federally funded programs that bring students and teachers onto campus each summer. Founded in 1970, the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine (TCOM) is a state-supported osteopathic medical school that serves as the cornerstone of the University of North Texas Health Science Center. Originally established as a private, non-profit institution on the campus of Fort Worth Osteopathic Hospital, TCOM began receiving state funding in 1971 and officially became part of North Texas State University in 1975 when the Texas Legislature overwhelmingly passed Senate Bill 216, which made TCOM a state medical school. TCOM was the second university-affiliated osteopathic medical school to be established. The college grants the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (D.O.). TCOM currently has 685 D.O. students and over 300 full-time basic science and clinical faculty members. The full-time faculty is augmented by over 400 part-time faculty members. TCOM is ranked as the number 31 medical school for primary care by U.S. News and World Report. TCOM graduates the fourth most physicians in the United States that go on to practice primary care. Approximately 55 percent of TCOM's graduates practice primary care medicine (family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology), while the remainder are in specialties ranging from aerospace medicine to vascular medicine. Clinical rotation sites include John Peter Smith (JPS) Hospital in Fort Worth, Harris Methodist Hospital in Fort Worth, Plaza Medical Center in Fort Worth, Cook Children's Hospital in Fort Worth, Methodist Dallas Medical Center in Dallas, Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi, San Jacinto Methodist Hospital in Baytown, Conroe Regional Medical Center in Conroe, Bay Area Medical Center in Corpus Christi, and Good Shepherd Medical Center in Longview. Residency programs include dermatology, family practice, general surgery, internal medicine, neuromusculoskeletal medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, radiology. Fellowship programs include cardiology, gastroenterology, geriatrics-internal medicine, interventional cardiology, neuromusculoskeletal medicine, palliative medicine, and rheumatology. TCOM also offers dual degree programs (D.O./M.P.H., D.O./M.S., D.O./Ph.D.) with the School of Public Health and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and an early admission program is available for qualified undergraduates from UNT and UT Dallas. As a state medical school, TCOM is required to enroll 90 percent Texas residents for each entering class. Applications for admission are processed through the Texas Medical & Dental Schools Application Service (TMDSAS). The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences was established in 1993 when the Department of Biomedical Sciences at UNT was transferred to the Health Science Center. The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in biomedical sciences as well as dual degrees (DO/MS and DO/PhD), with options to specialize in biochemistry and molecular biology, cancer biology, cardiovascular science, cell biology, integrative physiology, microbiology and immunology, neurobiology of aging, pharmacology and neuroscience, physical medicine, structural anatomy, visual sciences, and integrative biomedical science. Specialized master's programs are available in biotechnology, clinical research management, forensic genetics, lab animal science, and medical sciences. The School of Public Health (SPH) was founded in 1999. Degree programs in SPH include Master of Health Administration (MHA), Master of Public Health (MPH), Doctor of Public Health (DrPH), and Ph.D. in public health sciences. Graduate certificate programs are available in Public Health and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). SPH also offers dual degree programs with TCOM, the UNT Anthropology Department and the University of Texas at Arlington School of Nursing. The School of Health Professions at UNTHSC started with the Physician Assistant program in 1997, which became the first PA program in Texas granted authority to award the Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) degree. The MPAS program is currently ranked as the number 38 graduate-level physician assistant program by U.S. News and World Report. The School also offers a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree. In 2011 the Texas Legislature authorized the establishment of a college of pharmacy at UNTHSC. A founding dean has been named, and the college is scheduled to matriculate its inaugural class of Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students in 2013. UNT Health is the physician entity of UNTHSC. It includes 170 physicians (99 DOs and 71 MDs) from nearly every medical specialty who practice in over 30 offices across Tarrant County as well as area hospitals. UNT Health handles over half a million patient visits every year. The Gibson D. Lewis Health Science Library's collections, including more than 20,000 journal titles and 67,000 books, provide UNTHSC students and faculty with access to the latest basic science and clinical research. The Lewis Library provides access to virtually 100 percent of the world's current medical information, including a wide variety of research databases.
