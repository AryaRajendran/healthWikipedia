 Coxsackie A virus is a cytolytic coxsackie virus of the Picornaviridae family, an enterovirus (a group containing the polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, and echoviruses). The most well known Coxsackie A disease is Hand, foot and mouth disease (unrelated to hoof and mouth disease), a common childhood illness which affects mostly children aged 5 or under, often produced by Coxsackie A16. In most cases infection is asymptomatic or causes only mild symptoms. In others, infection produces short-lived (7â€“10 days) fever and painful blisters in the mouth (a condition known as herpangina), on the palms and fingers of the hand, or on the soles of the feet. There can also be blisters in the throat, or on or above the tonsils. Adults can also be affected. The rash, which can appear several days after high temperature and painful sore throat, can be itchy and painful, especially on the hands/fingers and bottom of feet. Other diseases include acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (A24 specifically), herpangina, and aseptic meningitis (both Coxsackie A and B viruses). Treatment is dependent on the disease process initiated by the virus. There is no known cure or vaccine against the coxsackie.
