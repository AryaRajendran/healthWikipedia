 Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the name for a group of clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogeneous disorders associated with atrophy in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe of the brain, with sparing of the parietal and occipital lobes. In the over 65 age group, FTLD is probably the fourth most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and vascular dementia. In the below 65 age group, it is the second most common cause after Alzheimer's disease. In some patients the symptoms of FTLD and Alzheimer's may overlap FTLD is the pathological term for the clinical syndrome Frontotemporal dementia, which can be subdivided as follows: There are 3 main histological subtypes found at post-mortem: FTLD-TDP43 Type1 presents many long neuritic profiles found in the superficial cortical laminae, very few or no neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, neuronal intranuclear inclusions or glial cytoplasmic inclusions. FTLD-TDP43 Type2 presents with lots of neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in both the upper (superficial) and lower (deep) cortical layers, and lower motor neurons. However neuronal intranuclear inclusions are rare or absent. FTLD-TDP43 Type3 presents with many small neurites and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the upper (superficial) cortical layers. Bar-like neuronal intranuclear inclusions can also be seen they are fewer in number. This type is associated with C9ORF72 mutations (see next section). FTLD-TDP-43 Type4 presents with lots of neuronal intranuclear inclusions and dystrophic neurites, and an unusual absence of inclusions in the granual cell layer of the hippocampus. Type 4 is associated with VCP mutations. There have been numerous advances in descriptions of genetic causes of FTLD, and the related disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mutations in all of the above genes cause a very small fraction of the FTLD spectrum. Most of the cases are sporadic (no known genetic cause). For diagnostic purposes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) are applied. They measure either atrophy or reductions in glucose utilization. The three clinical subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia, are characterized by impairments in specific neural networks. The first subtype with behavioral deficits, frontotemporal dementia, mainly affects a frontomedian network discussed in the context of social cognition. Semantic dementia is mainly related to the inferior temporal poles and amygdalae; brain regions that have been discussed in the context of conceptual knowledge, semantic information processing, and social cognition, whereas progressive nonfluent aphasia affects the whole left frontotemporal network for phonological and syntactical processing. United States Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM) is a known sufferer of FTLD, and the illness is the main reason behind his October 4, 2007 announcement of retirement at the end of his term.
