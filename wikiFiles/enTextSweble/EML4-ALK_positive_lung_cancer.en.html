 EML4-ALK positive lung cancer is a medical term that refers to a primary malignant lung tumor whose cells contain a characteristic abnormal configuration of DNA wherein the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene is fused to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. This abnormal gene fusion leads to the production of a protein (EML4-ALK) that appears, in many cases, to promote and maintain the malignant behavior of the cancer cells. The transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene was first reported in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell 2007 non-small-cell lung cancer. Most lung carcinomas containing the EML4-ALK gene fusion are adenocarcinomas. Some studies suggest that the papillary adenocarcinoma and the signet ring cell adenocarcinoma variants are more likely to carry this fused gene than other histological variants. EML4-ALK gene fusions occur almost exclusively in carcinomas arising in non-smokers. EML4-ALK mutations rarely occur in combination with K-RAS or EGFR mutations. The signs and symptoms of this lung cancer variant seem to mimic those of the underlying major cell type. See screening below. A 2011 consensus recommendation from 37 Canadian lung cancer specialists found that, as of June 2011, there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening of lung cancer speciments for EML4-ALK fusions, but that may soon change.
