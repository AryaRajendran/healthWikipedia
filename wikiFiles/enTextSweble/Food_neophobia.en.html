 Food neophobia, fussy eating or picky eating is a relatively common phase of resisting or refusing to eat new foods in children. As the word neo-, means 'new', and the word -phobia means fear, food neophobia it literally means a fear of trying new foods. (See also Neophobia.) It differs from selective eating disorder. Food neophobia is particularly common in toddlers and young children. However, as they grow up through adolescence and teenage years, most children generally grow out of it. Very few children continue to have food neophobia as they become adults. Those that do can live with the phobia throughout their adult lives. In a study done in 2011, food neophobia among international students is also reported to be the cause of reluctance to accept changes to food. This explains the fussiness or fear in choosing food. A child's risk for developing food neophobia is primarily genetic. Psychosocial factors can also increase a child's chances of developing food neophobia. Young children carefully watch parental food preferences, and this may produce fussy or picky eating if parents tend to avoid some foods. Other causes include being more sensitive than average to bitter tastes, which may be associated with a significant history of middle ear infection or an increased perception of bitter foods, known as a supertaster. They may also associate certain foods with bad experiences. For example, if a child eats a banana and then is sick afterwards, then he might believe that the banana caused him to be ill, so he might dislike bananas. This is a very simplistic example; however, if a child or toddler is ill for a long time, and the intake of food continually makes them worse, then the number of foods that the child believes to be bad is likely to be quite high, suggestively a cause of food neophobia. According to an article written by Ken Lee in 1989, food neophobia in adults is psychological and largely due to an outsized fear of chemicals or technology. Although people's greatest food-related health risks are from microbial contamination and eating too much, picky adults worry about "chemicals" and may have chemophobia (a fear of things that sound like artificial chemicals) or orthorexia (a desire for all food to meet the eater's idea of perfection). Some efforts to address this situation, such as pressuring the child to eat a disliked food or threatening punishment for not eating it, tend to exacerbate the problem. Effective solutions include offering non-food rewards, such as a small sticker, for tasting a new or disliked food and for parents to model the behavior they want to see, by cheerfully eating the new or disliked foods in front of the children.
