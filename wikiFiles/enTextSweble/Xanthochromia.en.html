 Xanthochromia [from the Greek xanthos (ξανθός)=yellow and chroma (χρώμα)=colour], is the yellowish appearance of cerebrospinal fluid (which envelops the brain) in particular medical conditions, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most effective test for SAH is computed tomography (CT, a type of brain scan), but this identifies only 98% of cases in the first 12 hours after the symptoms and becomes less useful afterwards. Therefore, obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (after a CT scan) by lumbar puncture is recommended if someone has characteristic symptoms (e.g. a thunderclap headache) but no blood visible on the CT. It is not necessary if the images were taken with a third generation CT scan in the first six hours after the onset of the symptoms and no blood is present on the scan. The yellow appearance is caused by red blood cells entering the CSF during the bleeding. The cells are eventually destroyed by the body, releasing their oxygen-carrying molecule heme, which is degraded by enzymes into the yellow-green pigment bilirubin. Heme from red blood cells that enter the CSF for a different reason, e.g., because a small blood vessel was damaged during the lumbar puncture, has no time to be digested in this fashion, and bilirubin is therefore absent. Many laboratories rely on the color of the fluid alone when reporting the presence or absence of xanthochromia. Recent guidelines, however, suggest that spectrophotometry should be performed. This relies on the fact that bilirubin absorbs light of wavelengths between 450–460 nm. Two related substances that are also released when heme is metabolized are oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin (the absorption ranges are 410-418 nm and 403-410 nm respectively) may also be detected during this process., Xanthochromia is not seen in traumatic tap. There are other causes for xanthochromia.
