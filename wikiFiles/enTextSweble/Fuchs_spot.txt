 The Fuchs spot or sometimes Forster-Fuchs' retinal spot is a degeneration of the macula in case of high myopia. It is named after the two persons who first described it: Ernst Fuchs, who described a pigmented lesion in 1901, and Forster, who described subretinal neovascularisation in 1862. The size of the spots are proportionate to the severity of the pathological myopia. First signs of a Fuchs spot are distorted sight of straight lines near the fovea, which some days later turn to the typical well-circumscribed patches after absorption of haemorrhage, and a pigmented scar remains. As in macular degeneration, central sight is affected. Atrophy leads to the loss of two or more lines of the Snellen chart.
