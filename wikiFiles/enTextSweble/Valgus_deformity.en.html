 In orthopedics, a valgus deformity is a term for outward angulation of the distal segment of a bone or joint. The opposite deformation, medial deviation of the distal bone, is called varus. The terms varus and valgus always refer to the direction that the distal segment of the joint points. For a discussion of the etymology of these words, see the entry under varus. Common causes of Valgus Knee in adults include arthritis of the knee and trauma. Rheumatoid knee commonly presents as valgus knee. Osteoarthritis knee may also sometimes present with valgus deformity though varus deformity is common. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to correct valgus deformity is surgically difficult and requires specialized implants called constrained condylar knees.
