 Isotonic hyponatremia is a form of hyponatremia with mOsm measured between 280 and 295. It can be associated with pseudohyponatremia, or with isotonic infusion of glucose or mannitol. Certain conditions that interfere with laboratory tests of serum sodium concentration such as extraordinarily high blood levels of lipid (hyperlipidemia/hypertriglyceridemia) or protein (hyperparaproteinemia) may lead to an erroneously low measurement of sodium. This is called pseudohyponatremia, and can occur when laboratories use the flame-photometric and indirect (but not direct) ion-selective electrode assays. This is distinct from a true dilutional hyponatremia that can be caused by an osmotic shift of water from cells to the bloodstream after large infusions on mannitol or intravenous immunoglobulin. It is associated with hyperlipidemia more frequently than with elevated protein.
