 Retinoblastoma (Rb) is a rapidly developing cancer that develops in the cells of retina, the light-detecting tissue of the eye. In the developed world, Rb has one of the best cure rates of all childhood cancers (95-98%), with more than nine out of every ten sufferers surviving into adulthood. There are two forms of the disease, a heritable form and non-heritable form (all cancers are considered genetic in that mutations of the genome are required for their development, but this does not imply that they are heritable, or transmitted to offspring). Approximately 55% of children with Rb have the non-heritable form. If there is no history of the disease within the family, the disease is labeled "sporadic", but this does not necessarily indicate that it is the non-heritable form. In about two thirds of cases, only one eye is affected (unilateral retinoblastoma); in the other third, tumours develop in both eyes (bilateral retinoblastoma). The number and size of tumours on each eye may vary. In certain cases, the pineal gland is also affected (trilateral retinoblastoma). The position, size and quantity of tumours are considered when choosing the type of treatment for the disease. The most common and obvious sign of retinoblastoma is an abnormal appearance of the pupil, leukocoria, also known as amaurotic cat's eye reflex. Other signs and symptoms include deterioration of vision, a red and irritated eye with glaucoma, and faltering growth or delayed development. Some children with retinoblastoma can develop a squint, commonly referred to as "cross-eyed" or "wall-eyed" (strabismus). Retinoblastoma presents with advanced disease in developing countries and eye enlargement is a common finding. Depending on the position of the tumors, they may be visible during a simple eye exam using an ophthalmoscope to look through the pupil. A positive diagnosis is usually made only with an examination under anesthetic (EUA). A white eye reflection is not always a positive indication of retinoblastoma and can be caused by light being reflected badly or by other conditions such as Coats' disease. The presence of the photographic fault red eye in only one eye and not in the other may be a sign of retinoblastoma. A more clear sign is "white eye" or "cat's eye" (leukocoria). Retinoblastoma is rare and affects approximately 1 in 15,000 live births, but it is the most common inherited childhood malignancy. In the UK, around 40 to 50 new cases are diagnosed each year. Most children are diagnosed before the age of five years old. In the UK, bilateral cases usually present within the first year with the average age at diagnosis being 9 months. Diagnosis of unilateral cases peaks between 24 and 30 months. In children with the heritable genetic form of retinoblastoma there is a mutation on chromosome 13, called the RB1 gene. The genetic codes found in chromosomes control the way in which cells grow and develop within the body. If a portion of the code is missing or altered (mutation) a cancer may develop. The defective RB1 gene can be inherited from either parent; in some children, however, the mutation occurs in the early stages of fetal development. Inherited forms of retinoblastomas are more likely to be bilateral; in addition, they may be associated with pinealoblastoma (also known as trilateral retinoblastoma) with a dismal outcome. The genetic codes found in chromosomes control the way in which cells grow and develop within the body. Several methods have been developed to detect the RB1 gene mutations. Attempts to correlate gene mutations to the stage at presentation have not shown convincing evidence of a correlation. Current research being joint funded by The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust in Birmingham, UK, is attempting to establish the different types of retinoblastoma children may have and subsequently determine a more successful treatment pathway. Somatic amplification of the MYCN oncogene is responsible for some cases of non-hereditary, early-onset, aggressive, unilateral Rb. Although MYCN amplification accounted for only 1.4% of Rb cases, researchers identified it in 18% of infants diagnosed at less than 6 months of age. Median age at diagnosis for MYCN Rb was 4.5 months, compared with 24 months for those who had non-familial unilateral disease with two RB1 gene mutations. Screening for retinoblastoma should be part of a "well baby" screening for newborns during the first three months of life, to include: If the eye examination is abnormal, further testing may include imaging studies, such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. CT and MRI can help define the structure abnormalities and reveal any calcium depositions. Ultrasound can help define the height and thickness of the tumor. Bone marrow examination or lumbar puncture may also be done to determine any metastases to bones or the brain. Gross and microscopic appearances of retinoblastoma are identical in both hereditary and sporadic types. Macroscopically, viable tumor cells are found near blood vessels, while zones of necrosis are found in relatively avascular areas. Microscopically, both undifferentiated and differentiated elements may be present. Undifferentiated elements appear as collections of small, round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei; differentiated elements include Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, Homer-Wright rosettes, and fluerettes from photoreceptor differentiation. Identifying the RB1 gene mutation that led to a child's retinoblastoma can be important in the clinical care of the affected individual and in the care of (future) siblings and offspring.It may run in the family. Treatment of retinoblastoma varies from country to country. The priority is to preserve the life of the child, then to preserve vision, and then to minimize complications or side effects of treatment. The exact course of treatment will depend on the individual case and will be decided by the ophthalmologist in discussion with the paediatric oncologist. Many treatment options exist, including chemotherapy (administered locally via a thin catheter threaded through the groin, through the aorta and the neck, into the optic vessels), cryotherapy, radioactive plaques, laser therapy, external beam radiotherapy and surgical removal of the eyeball. Any combinations of these treatments may be adopted. In recent years, there has been an effort to find alternatives to enucleation and radiation therapy.
