 Heartburn is an uncomfortable feeling in the chest that happens when acids from the stomach travel up the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach). When stomach acids hurt the lining of the esophagus, the feeling is a symptom. The burning sensation is commonly called "heartburn," but it has nothing to do with the heart. The symptom may be helped by taking antacids, such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate.
