 Hymenorrhaphy or hymenoplasty or hymen reconstruction surgery is the surgical restoration of the hymen. The term comes from the Greek words hymen meaning membrane, and raphe meaning suture. It is also known as hymenoplasty, although strictly this term would also include hymenotomy. Such procedures are not generally regarded as part of mainstream gynecology, but are available from some plastic surgery centers, particularly in the USA, Japan and Western Europe, generally as day surgery. The normal aim is to cause bleeding during post-nuptial intercourse, which in some cultures is considered proof of virginity. The term may cover at least four significantly different types of procedure: Some hymen reconstruction operations are legal in some countries, while other countries ban all hymenorrhaphy. Infibulation is generally illegal. In the United States of America, hymen restoration is available in private clinics and becoming more common. In France, some of the cost is reimbursed by the state in cases of rape or trauma.
