 Integrative medicine or integrative health is the combination of practices and methods of alternative medicine with evidence based medicine. The term has been popularised by, among others, Deepak Chopra, VA Shiva Ayyadurai, Andrew Weil and Prince Charles. Weil says that patients should take the Western medicine prescribed by the doctor, and could significantly benefit from complementary therapies such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and herbal remedies, meditation and other strategies. In the UK, the universities of Buckingham and Westminster have previously offered courses in integrative medicine, for which they have received criticism. Integrative medicine receives the same types of criticisms that are directed at alternative medicine. Arnold S. Relman, a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine wrote: The US government has funded studies of integrative medicine through the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Steven Novella, a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine, wrote that NCCAM's activities are "used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate." Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of The New England Journal of Medicine said "It's a new name for snake oil." Organizations such as The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health, The College of Medicine and The Sunflower Jam that advocate or raise money for integrative medicine in the UK have been criticised in the British Medical Journal for promoting unproven complementary treatments.
