 Intubation, sometimes entubation, is the insertion of a tube into an external or internal orifice of the body for the purpose of adding or removing fluids. The term intubation is often considered synonymous with tracheal intubation, but may reference inserting a tube into the gastrointestinal tract, as with balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube.
