 The ischium forms the lower and back part of the hip bone (os coxae). The word ischium dates back to c. 164o B.C.E., from Greek ἰσχίον iskhion meaning "hip joint", in plural, "the hips", and most likely comes from ισχύς iskhys "loin", which is of unknown origin. Situated below the ilium and behind the pubis, it is one of these three bones whose fusion creates the coxa. The superior portion of this bone forms approximately one third of the acetabulum. It is divisible into three portions: The ischial ramus joins the inferior ramus of the pubis anteriorly. It is the strongest of the coxal bones. Clinically, avulsion fracture of the ischial apophysis may occur (Wootton 1990). Avulsion fractures of the hip bone (avulsion or tearing away of the ischial tuberosity) may occur in adolescents and young adults during sports that require sudden acceleration or deceleration forces, such as sprinting or kicking in football, soccer, jumping hurdles, basketball, and martial arts. These fractures occur at apophyses (bony projections that lack secondary ossification centers). Avulsion fractures occur where muscles are attached: anterior superior and inferior iliac spines, ischial tuberosities, and ischiopubic rami. A small part of bone with a piece of a tendon or ligament attached is avulsed (torn away) (Moore 2006). The clade Dinosauria is divided into the Saurischia and Ornithischia based on hip structure, including importantly that of the ischium.
