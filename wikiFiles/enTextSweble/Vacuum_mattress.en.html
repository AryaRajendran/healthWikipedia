 A vacuum mattress, or vacmat, is a medical device used for the immobilisation of patients, especially in case of a vertebra, pelvis or limb trauma (especially for femur trauma). It is also used for manual transportation of patients for short distances (it replaces the stretcher). It was invented by Loed and Haederl√©, who called it "shell" mattress (matelas coquille in French). It consists of a sealed polymer bag (bigger than an adult human body) that encloses small polystyrene balls, with a valve, straps and handles. It is washable and invisible to X-rays. When the mattress is under pressure, the balls are free and the mattress can be moulded. Usually, the vacuum mattress is put on a stretcher, the patient is put on the mattress (e.g. with a scoop stretcher), and the sides of the mattress are moulded around the patient. Then, the air is pumped out through the valve and the valve is closed. The atmospheric pressure presses the balls together and the mattress becomes hard and rigid. The straps are then tied to secure the patient. A sheet is usually put on the vacuum mattress, for three reasons: The full spine immobilisation (splint) is performed with: The vacuum mattress is put on a stretcher or possibly on a long spine board. The straps are put under the mattress, along its side, so they do not reach the ground. Then, the polystyrene balls are distributed evenly through the mattress by shaking its surface. A section with fewer balls would be less rigid. It is also possible to concentrate the balls in a given point to make this place more rigid. Finally, a sheet is put on the mattress. The sheet is folded so it will be possible to pull it to wrap the casualty into it; the profile has an S-shape. The team member also checks that the pump (manual or electrical) works in the right direction. There are three ways to put the casualty on the vacuum mattress: In all cases, the vacuum valve is up and at the feet of the casualty. Once the casualty is on the mattress, the sheet is wrapped around him/her and the sides of the mattress are folded against their body. The top of the head must be kept clear (the mattress could retract when pumping out the air and thus compress the spine). The air is pumped until the mattress is rigid, then the valve is closed and the straps are fastened. When only three team members are available and there is no scoop stretcher, the following procedure can be used: While the lifting methods can induce a flexing of the spine, this rolling method can be hazardous for several reasons: the risk of a torsion of the spine when rolling, the risk when sliding the casualty on the mattress, the risk of anteversion of the hips (and thus of flexing of the spine) due to the weight of the legs when lifting the mattress to slide the board. The vacuum mattress is an alternative to the use of a long spine board. Its advantages are: Its drawbacks are:
