 Opipramol (Insidon, Pramolan, Ensidon, Oprimol) is an antidepressant and anxiolytic used in Germany and other European countries. Although it is a member of the tricyclic antidepressants, opipramol's primary mechanism of action is much different in comparison. Most TCAs act as reuptake inhibitors, but opipramol does not, and instead acts as a sigma receptor agonist, among other properties. Opipramol is typically used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Its anxiolysis becomes prominent after only 1-2 weeks of chronic administration. Upon first commencing treatment, opipramol is rather sedating in nature due to its antihistamine properties, but this effect becomes less prominent with time. Opipramol acts as a high affinity sigma receptor agonist, primarily at the σ1 subtype, but also at the σ2 subtype with somewhat lower affinity. It is this property which is responsible for its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression. Opipramol also acts as a low to moderate affinity antagonist for the D2, 5-HT2, H1, H2, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. H1 and H2 receptor antagonism account for its antihistamine effects, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism is responsible for its anticholinergic properties. Opipramol should not be taken with alcohol, or in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or glaucoma.
