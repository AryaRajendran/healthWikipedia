 Phlebitis is an inflammation of a vein, usually in the legs. When phlebitis is associated with the formation of blood clots (thrombosis), usually in the deep veins of the legs, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. These clots can travel to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolisms that can be fatal. Vasculitis: Phlebitis is a contraindication to massage, because massage manipulations may break loose a clot which could travel to the heart or lungs, creating a pulmonary embolism. Phlebitis was first described by John Hunter in 1784.
