 Hepatitis A is viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus. Unlike the other common forms of hepatitis (hepatitis B and C) it does not cause chronic liver disease. There is no medication effective against Hepatitis A. In most cases, the infection resolves on its own. Unfortunately, a small number of patients develop Fulminant hepatic failure, which is very serious. A vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A, and anti-hepatitis A immunoglobulin is also used.
