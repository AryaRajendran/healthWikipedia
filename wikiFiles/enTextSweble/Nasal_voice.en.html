 A nasal voice is a type of speaking voice characterized by speech with a "nasal" quality to it. It can also occur naturally because of genetic variation. In vocal context, the opposite of nasal is adenoidal or denasal. Nasal speech can be divided into hypo-nasal or hyper-nasal. Hyponasal speech is a lack of appropriate nasal airflow during speech, such as when a person has nasal congestion. Some causes of hyponasal speech are adenoid hypertrophy, allergic rhinitis, deviated septum, sinusitis, and turbinate hypertrophy. Hypernasal speech is inappropriate increased airflow through the nose during speech, especially with plosives and fricatives (syllables that begin with a consonant). Examples of hypernasal speech include cleft palate and velopharyngeal insufficiency.
