 The Perryville Tree Engravings are carvings and engravings on more than 100 trees located in Perryville Community Park in Perryville, Maryland. The trees were carved by former patients of the nearby Perry Point Veteran's Medical Center, which was a psychiatric hospital. The trees sit on land formerly owned by the hospital which is now part of Perryville Community Park. Several of the trees contain engravings that were made by mentally ill American military veterans.

For example, one tree is engraved with "Christ said to police there was no Second World War." Other engravings include:
