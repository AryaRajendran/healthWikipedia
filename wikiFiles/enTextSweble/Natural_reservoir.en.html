 Natural reservoir or nidus (the latter from the Latin word for "nest") refers to the long-term host of the pathogen of an infectious disease. It is often the case that hosts do not get the disease carried by the pathogen or it is carried as a subclinical infection and so asymptomatic and non-lethal. Once discovered, natural reservoirs elucidate the complete life cycle of infectious diseases, providing effective prevention and control. Examples of natural reservoirs are: Some diseases have no non-human reservoir: poliomyelitis and smallpox are prominent examples. The natural reservoir of some diseases remain unknown. This is the case of the Ebola disease, which is caused by a virus.
