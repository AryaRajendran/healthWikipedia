 Non islet hypoglycemic cell tumor is a rare tumor that secretes the protein insulin-like growth factor 2 into the bloodstream. This protein causes cells to consume excessive amounts of sugar, which can cause the condition hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Symptoms include night sweats, sleepwalking, memory loss, and, in very rare cases, abnormal facial swelling and hair growth, as the protein can sometimes act as growth hormones. Removal of the tumor alone will often solve the problems it causes. The most common treatment of the tumor is either radiotherapy or complete removal of the tumor, although there is a high chance of dying during the procedure. A tumor can be found with the use of an x-ray or MRI.
