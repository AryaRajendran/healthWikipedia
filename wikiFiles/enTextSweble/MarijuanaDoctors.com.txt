 MarijuanaDoctors.com is a Web 2.0 company that launched in early 2010 as the medical marijuana industry’s first online search and booking platform for medical marijuana evaluations. MarijuanaDoctors.com officially launched on April 14, 2010 as the medical marijuana industry’s first online search and booking platform for medical marijuana evaluations. The website operates in all states that have passed medical marijuana laws and is free to use. In December 2010 the company released new features that include a Patient Pre-Qualification System, which is a questionnaire form that determines if patients would qualify for medical marijuana in a particular state, and a Recommendation Letter Generator for doctors that are members of the site. The company also launched a "do it yourself" service that gives patients "the information and resources needed to obtain medical marijuana recommendations from their primary care physicians," such as the patient’s prequalification data from the site’s prequalification system, state-specific legal information for the physicians, and a pre-filled state-specific recommendation letter. In April 2010, MarijuanaDoctors.com formed a partnership with PotLocator.com, an online pot dispensary locator site. PotLocator.com integrated MarijuanaDoctors.com into its site as the exclusive marijuana doctor directory, and MarijuanaDoctors.com presented PotLocator.com on its site as the exclusive dispensary provider. The two companies also finalized plans to add a doctor-finding feature to PotLocator’s iPhone app that locates marijuana dispensaries. The company is active in the medical marijuana political scene and co-sponsored a pro-medical marijuana billboard with patient advocacy organization NY Patients First in Binghamtom, NY. The billboard depicted the image of a woman in front of a rundown home with the caption: "This is her pharmacy. Medical Marijuana: It's Time, NY." The goal of the billboard was to bring attention to the medical marijuana legislation that was pending in the New York State Senate at the time.
