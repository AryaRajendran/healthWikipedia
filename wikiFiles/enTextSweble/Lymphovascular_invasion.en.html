 Lymphovascular invasion (LVI or lymphovascular space invasion) is spread of a cancer to the blood vessels and/or lymphatics. Lymphovascular invasion may be used interchangeably with vascular invasion, which strictly speaking is not synonymous. The term lymphovascular invasion is generally preferred to vascular invasion as it is difficult to differentiate small lymphatic spaces from small vascular spaces under the microscope without special techniques. Lymphovascular invasion, especially in carcinomas, usually precedes spread to the lymph nodes that drain the tissue in which the tumour arose. Conversely, cancers with lymph node spread (known as a lymph node metastases), usually have lymphovascular invasion. Lymph node metastases usually precede secondary tumours, i.e. distant metastases. The absence of LVI in the context of proven lymph node metastasis is usually thought to be due to sampling error. The predictive value and prevalence of lymphovascular invasion is strongly dependent on the type of cancer. In other words, LVI in one type of cancer may be much less important than LVI in another type of cancer. Generally speaking, it is associated with lymph node metastases which themselves are predictive of a poorer prognosis. In the context of (histologically) proven lymph node metastases, LVI may have less prognostic significance or no prognostic significance. In breast cancer, LVI is not an independent risk factor for a poorer prognosis. In urothelial carcinoma, LVI is an independent predictor of a poorer prognosis that has more predictive power than tumour stage. In sporadic colorectal carcinoma, LVI is an independent predictor of a poorer prognosis.
