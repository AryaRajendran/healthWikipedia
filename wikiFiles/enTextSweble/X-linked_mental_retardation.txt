 X-linked mental retardation (also known as X-linked intellectual disability) refers to forms of mental retardation which are specifically associated with X-linked recessive inheritance. As with most X-linked disorders, males are more heavily affected than females. Females with one affected X chromosome and one normal X chromosome tend to have milder symptoms. Unlike many other types of mental retardation, the genetics of these conditions are relatively well understood. It has been estimated there are ~200 genes involved in this syndrome; of these ~100 have been identified. X-linked mental retardation accounts for ~16% of all cases of intellectual disability in males. Several X-linked syndromes include retardation as part of the presentation. These include Coffin-Lowry syndrome, MASA syndrome, and X-linked alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome. Following is a list of genes located on the X chromosome and linked to mental retardation. There are also several loci that have not been associated with a specific gene.
