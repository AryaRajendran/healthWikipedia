 The clinical descriptions of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) vary. Different agencies and scientific bodies have produced different guidelines to define the condition, with some overlap of symptoms between descriptions. Aspects of the condition are controversial, with disagreements over etiology, pathophysiology, treatment and naming between medical practitioners, researchers, patients and advocacy groups. Subgroup analysis suggests that, depending on the applied definition, the CFS population may represent a variety of conditions rather than a single disease entity. The most widely used diagnostic criteria for CFS are the 1994 research guidelines proposed by the "International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group", led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These criteria are sometimes called the "Fukuda definition" after the first author (Keiji Fukuda) of the publication. The 1994 CDC criteria specifies the following conditions must be met: ;Primary symptoms Clinically evaluated, unexplained, persistent or relapsing chronic fatigue that is: ;Additional requirements The concurrent occurrence of four or more of the following symptoms, all of which must have persisted or recurred during 6 or more consecutive months of illness and must not have predated the fatigue: ;Final requirement All other known causes of chronic fatigue must have been ruled out, specifically clinical depression, side effects of medication, eating disorders and substance abuse. The clinical evaluation should include: Other diagnostic tests have no recognized value unless indicated on an individual basis to confirm or exclude a differential diagnosis, such as multiple sclerosis. The initial chronic fatigue syndrome definition was published in 1988. It is also called the "Holmes definition", after the manuscript's first author. Unlike the 1994 CDC criteria, the Holmes criteria exclude patients with psychiatric diagnoses and require the presence of eight secondary symptoms, not just four. The Oxford criteria were published in 1991 and include both CFS of unknown etiology and a subtype of CFS called post-infectious fatigue syndrome (PIFS), which "either follows an infection or is associated with a current infection." Important differences are that the presence of mental fatigue is necessary to fulfill the critera and symptoms are accepted that may suggest a psychiatric disorder. A clinical case definition for ME/CFS was initiated by Health Canada and published by an international group of researchers in 2003. Diagnosis requires "two or more neurological/cognitive manifestations" and one or more symptoms from at least two of the categories of autonomic, neuroendocrine and immune manifestations, in addition to multiple major criteria of fatigue, post exertional malaise and/or fatigue, chronic pain and sleep dysfunction. The definition is also referred to as the Canadian consensus criteria. An important difference is that the Canadian definition excludes patients with symptoms of mental illness. It was updated in 2010 to provide greater specification to the original. Functional impairment must be below defined thresholds in two of the three designated subscales of the Short Form 36 Health Survey i.e. Vitality, Social Functioning, and Role-Physical. Criterion symptoms which predate fatigue onset can now be counted towards diagnosis, and individuals "who do not meet the fatigue criterion may still obtain a Clinical ME/CFS diagnosis if they meet the other five criteria". The London criteria were designed for research purposes and used by AFME in all the studies funded by them until the mid 90s. An incomplete version edited by Nick Anderson (CEO of AFME) was published in a 1994 report. These revised criteria require exercise-induced fatigue; memory and concentration impairment, normally accompanied by other neurological or psychological symptoms; and variability of symptoms, often brought on by mental or physical activity. In light of the advances in understanding of CFS, the criteria were updated in 2009. These have been cited in articles and are currently being evaluated, for example, in studies to ascertain differences between patients selected using different case definitions. Developed by a group of 26 individuals from 13 countries and consisting of clinicians, researchers, teaching faculty and an independent patient advocate. Based on the 2003 "Canadian" definition by Carruthers et al, chronic fatigue is no longer required and the six-month waiting period before diagnosis has been dropped. The main symptom is "post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion" (PENE) i.e. low stamina, rapid fatigability, symptom exacerbation, and variable onset with prolonged recovery; which is also accompanied by symptoms from neurological, immune/gastro-intestinal/genitourinary, and energy metabolism/transport impairment categories, and at least a 50% reduction in activity which is described as "mild". National guidelines, based upon some or all of the above diagnostic criteria, have been produced by several national bodies, for example in Australia in 2004 and in the United Kingdom in 2007. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales published a multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline in 2007 in which the following criteria are employed: The diagnosis should be reconsidered if none of the following symptoms remain: post-exertional fatigue or malaise, cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbance, chronic pain. The guideline requires fatigue to have been present for 4 months in an adult or 3 months in a child. It expects a diagnosis in a child to be made by a pediatrician. The guideline states that a referral to a CFS/ME specialist should be offered immediately to the severely ill. There is no generally accepted diagnostic test to reliably diagnose or exclude chronic fatigue syndrome. The 1994 CDC criteria states diagnostic tests should be directed to confirm or exclude other causes for fatigue and other symptoms. Further tests may be individually necessary to identify underlying or contributing conditions that require treatment. The use of tests for diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome should only be done in the context of protocol-based research. The following routine tests are recommended: The 2007 NICE guideline includes, in addition to panel recommended by the CDC, tests for C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation), creatine kinase (a muscle-related enzyme), plasma viscosity (optional if ESR done) and serology for celiac disease. Ferritin determination may be performed in children and young people, and in adults only if other tests suggest iron deficiency. The guideline recommends clinical judgment in decisions to perform other tests in addition to the standard set. Testing for infections (e.g. Lyme disease, viral hepatitis, HIV, mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus) is only recommended if the patient gives a specific history for this. The NICE guideline discourages routine performance of the head-up tilt test, auditory brainstem response and electrodermal conductivity for the purpose of diagnosis. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales states that none of the existing case definitions are based on robust evidence, and no studies have confirmed any case definition to be superior to others. Some researchers say that subtypes of CFS may exist. A 2003 international CFS study group for the CDC found ambiguities in the CDC 1994 CFS research case definition which contribute to inconsistent case identification. Different self-reported causes of CFS are associated with significant differences in clinical measures and outcomes. An examination of the CDC 1994 criteria applied to several hundred patients found that the diagnosis could be strengthened by adding two new symptoms (anorexia and nausea) and eliminating three others (muscle weakness, joint pain, sleep disturbance). Other suggested improvements to the diagnostic criteria include the use of severity ratings. A new "empirical definition" of the CDC 1994 criteria was published in 2005. A 2009 evaluation of the 2005 empirical definition compared 27 patients with a prior diagnosis of CFS with 37 patients diagnosed with a Major Depressive Disorder. The researchers reported that "38% of those with a diagnosis of a Major Depressive Disorder were misclassified as having CFS using the new CDC definition."
