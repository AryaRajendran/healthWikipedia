 Treatment of rare lung cancers refers to specialized medical interventions utilized in an attempt to cure or palliate uncommon histological forms of malignant lung neoplasms, particularly forms of lung cancer for which no specific therapeutic guidelines have yet been derived from randomized clinical trials. Lung cancer classification schemes comprise the foundation for epidemiologic and clinical research on this highly lethal disease. Although a number of different systems have been devised and advocated for classifying tumors of the lung, none of them have as yet been universally accepted. Lung cancers are a very large and extremely heterogeneous family of malignancies, with well over 50 different histological variants recognized under the 2004 revision of the World Health Organization typing system ("WHO-2004"), currently the most widely used scheme. As different histological variants exhibit a broad spectrum of differing genetic, biological, and clinical properties, including response to various treatment regimens, correct classification of lung cancer cases are necessary to assure reliability and validity of clinical trials and optimization of patient management. WHO-2004 assigns primary lung cancers to one of five groups according to the putative lineage of their cell of origin: Approximately 98% of lung cancers are carcinoma. Primary lung sarcomas, lymphomas, teratomas, and melanomas are all rare, with a relative incidence of 1% or less each among all primary lung cancers. WHO-2004 recognizes 8 major types of primary lung carcinoma based on cytological and tissue architectural characteristics. Of these, four are relatively common and four are relatively rare: With the exception of adenosquamous carcinoma – itself comprising a spectrum of composite tumors containing components of at least 10% each of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma — each of the major histological types of lung carcinoma encompasses at least one "subtype" and/or "variant" form. This exceptional histological heterogeneity is thought to reflect the great diversity of mutations due to oncogenetic insults and their effects on the molecular pathways that initiate, drive, and maintain malignant phenotypes. Some experts have recently advocated the use of histotype to identify variants of NSCLC into "better" and "worse" prognosis groups, and suggested tailoring aggressiveness of therapy on this basis. Prior to the early part of the 20th century lung cancer was considered a very rare disease, and all malignant lung tumors were treated identically. Radical surgical resection (i.e. lobectomy or pneumonectomy) was the only effective intervention available for lung cancer prior to the 1940s, when the era of modern cytotoxic chemotherapy began. It was not until 1962 that small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), then called "oat cell carcinoma" was recognized for its unique biological behavior, including a much higher frequency of widespread metastases at presentation, and exquisite sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. It is estimated that approximately 80% of lung cancer patients in the U.S. have non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), while approximately 12% have "pure" small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Patients diagnosed with lung cancers in these two groups are treated, in most cases, according to guidelines derived and published by consensus of expert panels after review of clinical trial and meta-analytic data, and published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Early studies suggested that patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) fared better when treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation than when treated surgically. While this approach to treating SCLC remains the current standard of care, the role of surgery in SCLC is being re-examined, with recent studies indicating that surgery may improve outcomes in some patients with early stage SCLC and combined forms of SCLC and NSCLC. It is estimated that approximately 80% of lung cancer patients in the U.S. have non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), while approximately 15% have small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Patients diagnosed with lung cancers in these two groups are treated, in most cases, according to guidelines derived and published by consensus of expert panels after review of clinical trial and meta-analytic data, and published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Although controversial, the traditional dichotomous stratification paradigm that has long divided patients with lung carcinoma into NSCLC and SCLC groups for treatment purposes is increasingly being replaced by a "higher order histomolecular stratification" (HOHMS) paradigm that recognizes and incorporates newly discovered associations between particular histologic subtypes of lung cancer and molecular oncogenetic mutations and pathways driving their malignant phenotypes. To date there have been no randomized clinical trials of therapies conducted in adenosquamous carcinomas (AdSqC's), and there are no published guidelines in place for their treatment. Numerous studies suggest that EGFR mutations occur at relative rates consistent with their histologically composite nature (i.e. more frequently mutated in AdSqC's vs. SqCLC, but less frequently vs. AdC's) NSSN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine Tumors LCNEC comprises approximately 3 percent of all lung cancers. It is recognized as a distinct subtype of large cell lung carcinoma in the WHO-2004 classification system. There has been considerable controversy about this histological subtype with regard to whether it should be treated using protocols for SCLC or NSCLC. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is currently considered to be a histological variant of NSCLC that typically exhibits better response to chemotherapy and/or radiation, and has with a better-than-average prognosis. Capecitabine, a prodrug converted into 5-FU within tumor cells, has been used as salvage therapy with some considerable success. In a study of 5 patients with advanced and metastatic pulmonary LELC, the disease control rate was 60%. One patient showed durable stabilization of disease for 15 months. Case report of complete remission using platinum and radiation. Case report of complete remission using carboplatin and paclitaxel. As pulmonary LELC is considered a histological variant of large cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) under the WHO lung tumor classification system. Recently, a number of clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of a cisplatin/pemetrexed combination in LCLC. Case report: metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, high levels of LDH and CEA, clear partial response to capecitabine after several lines of chemotherapy. Increase in thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression could provide a rationale for the use of capecitabine in AdC. Carcinoids comprise approximately 1.2% of all lung cancers. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Somatostatin analogues, interferon, 5-FU, doxorubicin, streptozocin, and dacarbazine appear to offer benefit, as do radionuclides 177Lu, 90Yt, and 111In.
