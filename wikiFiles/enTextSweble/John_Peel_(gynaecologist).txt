 Sir John Harold Peel KCVO FRCOG FRCS FRCP (10 December 1904 â€“ 31 December 2005) was a leading British obstetrician and gynecologist, who was Surgeon-Gynaecologist to HM The Queen from 1961 to 1973, present at a number of royal births. The son of a Methodist clergyman, John Harold Peel was educated at Manchester Grammar School and Queen's College, Oxford. Studying and specialising in gynaecology at King's College London School of Medicine, London, he qualified as a doctor in 1930, and passed his membership exams for the Royal College of Physicians in 1932. Appointed consultant surgeon for obstetrics and gynaecology at King's College Hospital, in 1937 he moved to the Princess Beatrice Hospital in London, where he remained as a consultant until 1965. Between 1948 and 1967, Peel was director of clinical studies at King's College Hospital Medical School. He was an examiner at around a dozen British universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, London and Bristol. Peel became a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1944. In 1955 he became a member of its council, and in 1959 its honorary treasurer, there by raising suffiecent funds to allow the college to move into premises in Regent's Park. Between 1966 and 1969 he was President of the RCOG, elected to an honorary fellowship in 1989. Peel assisted Royal Surgeon-Gynaecologist Sir Andrew Gilliattat at the births of Prince Charles (1948) and Princess Anne (1950). After the death of Sir Andrew Gilliattat in 1956, from 1961 to 1973 Peel himself was appointed Surgeon-Gynaecologist to Queen Elizabeth II. Peel hence delivered a number of royal births, including: The Prince Andrew (1960); The Prince Edward (1964) (both assisted by John Brudenell), Viscount Linley (1961) and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (1964). Peel himself was replaced by Sir George Pinker. Whilst President of the RCOG, in 1967 Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act, accepting with the brief to reduce the amount of disease and death associated with illegal abortion. Introduced by the Liberal MP David Steel, it proposed to legalise the medical termination of pregnancy. Both the ROCG council and government committee reflected the deep divisions surrounding this issue, including professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at University of Birmingham Medical School and a prominent anti-abortionist Hugh Maclaren, as well as several Roman Catholics. On publication of his advisory report, Peel won praise for his diplomatic skills as chairman of the government report committee, which came out in support of the Bill. Peel headed a number of steering groups and committees to government agencies, which included chairing the important Peel Report: Enquiry into Domiciliary Midwifery Beds Needs (1971) for the Department of Health and Social Security. To reduce maternal and infant mortality, the report recommended that all women should give birth in a hospital and remain there for some days. Among the Report's critics was epidemiologist Archie Cochrane, who pointed out that there was little correlation between high hospitalisation rates and lower perinatal mortality. The report however resulted in a change in the medical establishment's approach to maternity, at the expense of domiciliary midwifery services. Peel was the author of Textbook of Gynaecology (1943); Lives of the Fellows of Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 1929-1969 (1976); and Biography of William Blair Bell (1986). In the 1980s, as sponsor of the Responsible Society, Peel accused the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Social Security of encouraging girls under 16 to have sexual intercourse: Peel was married three times: He married first, in 1936, Muriel Elaine Pellow, with whom he had a daughter; Freda Margaret Mellish in 1947. After Muriel death in 1993, he married Sally Barton in 1995. Peel was a keen gardener, owned a stock of Friesian cattle on his farm, and enjoyed Salmon fishing on the River Spey in Scotland.
