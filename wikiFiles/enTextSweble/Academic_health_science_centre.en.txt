 An academic health science(s) centre (AHSC; also known as an academic health science(s) system, an academic health science(s) partnership or an academic medical centre) is a partnership between one or more universities and healthcare providers focusing on research, clinical services, education and training. AHSCs are intended to ensure that medical research breakthroughs lead to direct clinical benefits for patients. The organisational structures that comprise an AHSC can take a variety of forms, ranging from simple partnerships to, less frequently, fully integrated organisations with a single management board. There are currently AHSCs in operation in Canada, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 2005, the 16 highest ranked hospitals in the U.S. were all AHSCs. In 2007 a review of healthcare in London led by Professor Lord Darzi, A Framework for Action, recommended the creation of a number of AHSCs. In October 2007 Imperial College Healthcare became the first AHSC to be established in the UK when the Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine merged with the Hammersmith Hospital and St Mary's NHS trusts. Four more AHSCs have subsequently been established in the UK and one is planned. The following AHSCs are currently in operation in England: The Scottish national health science centre is Health Science Scotland AHSCs currently in operation in the United States include: AHSCs currently in operation in the rest of the world include:
