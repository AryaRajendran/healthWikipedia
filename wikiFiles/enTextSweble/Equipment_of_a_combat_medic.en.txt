 This article discusses the standard equipment of a Combat Medic. An armed medic, or a medic engaging in any combat role (such as manning an artillery piece), is considered a combatant and is not subject to protection under the Geneva Conventions. In order to enjoy those protections, a medic must be unarmed and also wear large, clear identifying insignia such as a red cross. However, in the type of asymmetric warfare which typifies modern conflicts, the enemy often has no respect for the laws of war and may in fact actively target medics (in addition to officers and radio operators), for the significant value they have in keeping the unit combat-effective. Thus, in most modern forces, medics are armed and do not wear large identifying insignia. A rifle or carbine is standard, often augmented with a sidearm because the medic may have to pass his rifle off in order to treat the wounded. There is actually no requirement to wear identifying insignia or to be unarmed. Geneva Conventions require that Medics use weapons to defend only themselves or their patients. To understand this, one must know that litter-bearers fall under the same protection, but are not required to be marked or unarmed. Chaplains can also carry weapons to defend themselves. The Combat Medic is commonly referred to as "Doc." With a combat unit, they function as a member of an infantry platoon up until the point that one of their comrades is wounded. Therefore, the Medic carries basically what a Rifleman or any other soldier carries. His Basic Equipment is usually: A combat medic will typically carry a backpack styled bag known as a "Unit One Pack". Aid bags are available from many different manufacturers, in many different styles. Depending on the unit and their standard operating procedures, the medic may have to follow a strict packing list, or may have the liberty of choosing their kit depending on the mission at hand. A typical aid bag will include: Fluid Resuscitation Hemorrhage (blood loss) Control Airway Management Assorted Equipment Battlefield Medicine A combat medic is generally expected to care for the needs of the soldiers in his group, including their everyday ailments. A medic will usually carry a small amount of what are referred to as "snivel" or "sick call meds." These are common over-the-counter medications that do not require a prescription. A Combat Medic may also carry other supplies as the mission dictates. A stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, otoscope, ophthalmoscope, and thermometer may help the medic treat his/her soldiers or civilians on the battlefield (COBs) while on an extended mission, as space dictates.
