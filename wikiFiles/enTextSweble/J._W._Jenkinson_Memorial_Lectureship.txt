 John Wilfred Jenkinson (1871–1915) was a pioneer in the field of comparative developmental biology and one of the first to introduce experimental embryology to the UK at the start of the twentieth century. He was the first lecturer in Embryology at the University of Oxford. After Jenkinson's tragic death at Gallipoli in 1915, the University of Oxford established the John Wilfred Jenkinson Lectureship in his memory. The original statutes required the lecturer(s), appointed annually, to deliver “one or more lectures or lecture demonstrations on comparative or experimental embryology”. Each year, a Board of Electors selects one or two Jenkinson Lecturers who are invited to Oxford to present a lecture in the broad area of developmental biology. The list of Jenkinson Lecturers includes many distinguished names, including Nobel Laureates. The lecturers are elected by an electoral board consisting of: the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford; the Rector of Exeter College, Oxford; the Regius Professor of Medicine; the Linacre Professor of Zoology; the Waynflete Professor of Physiology; Dr. Lee's Professor of Anatomy; and a member of the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Board elected by that board.
