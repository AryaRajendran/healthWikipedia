 THP1 is a human monocytic cell line derived from an acute monocytic leukemia patient. It is used to test leukemia cell lines in immunocytochemical analysis of protein-protein interaction, and immunohistochemistry. These cells show a large, round, single-cell morphology. They are derived from the peripheral blood of a 1 year old human male with acute monocytic leukemia. Some of their characteristics are: This cell line can provide continuous culture, grown in suspension; RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS + 2mM L-Glutamine. The average doubling time is 35 to 50 hours. You may also add 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml) to inhibit bacterial contamination. Maintain cultures between 2-9x105 cells/ml. 37C, 5% CO2. Cells are non-adhesive. Hazard: Cell line of human origin. There is no evidence for the presence of infectious viruses or toxic products. However, it is recommended that cultures are handled under Biosafety Level 2 containment.
