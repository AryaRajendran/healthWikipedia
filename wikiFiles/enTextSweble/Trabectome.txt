 Trabectome is a surgical device that can be used for Ab interno trabeculectomy, a minimally invasive glaucoma surgery for the surgical management of adult, juvenile and infantile glaucoma. Unlike trabeculectomy, the surgery does not create an external filtering bleb. Instead, the Trabectome handpiece opens access to Schlemm's canal by ablating the trabecular meshwork of the eye, therefore reducing intraocular pressure which is major risk factor for glaucomatous vision loss. The irrigation/aspiration device provides irrigation during surgery and collection of residual fluid and ablated tissue in a collection bag. This procedure is performed through a small incision and can be done on an outpatient basis. This device was invented by George Baerveldt at the University of California, Irvine and has been manufactured by the NeoMedix Corporation in Tustin, California. The images below illustrate how Trabectome improves aqueous drainage by removing the damaged trabecular meshwork. Trabectome decreases intra-ocular pressure to mid-teen range and reduces patient's requirement to take glaucoma eye drops and glaucoma medications (see references).
