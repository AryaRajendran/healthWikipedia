 Rhabomyosarcoma is a form of soft-tissue sarcoma that occurs often in children. It has different cellular subtypes, including embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and aveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the cellular subtype in slightly more than half of patients. It can arise in the parameningeal area, genitourinary region, in the eye, area in and around the head and neck, or extremities (arms/legs). Rhabdomyosarcoma is usually treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery if it has not spread beyond the primary site. Patients whose disease has not spread beyond the primary tumor have a five-year survival rate of up to 80% when treated well, but patients whose disease has spread past the primary tumor have a five-year survival rate of only 30%.
