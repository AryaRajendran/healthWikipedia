 A rectilinear scanner is an imaging device once used in nuclear medicine. Before the invention of the rectilinear scanner in 1950 by Benedict Cassen, nuclear medicine pioneers used to move their insensitive Geiger Counters over different parts of the body, which resulted in a fairly crude determination of the distribution of radioactivity. The scanner consists of : NaI(Tl) crystal of the detector moves in a raster pattern over studied area of the patient, making a constant count rate. Simultaneously, the light source moves over the photographic film. The intensity of light produced increases with an increase in activity, producing dark areas on the film. Device can be modified electronically to enhance count rate differences in areas of medical interest. Data taken during a scan is recorded on a magnetic tape or a disc to be analyzed later by a computer to provide a quantitative image. Dimensions of scan areas, spacing of scan lines and rate of movement of scanning head is adjusted according to organ size and amount of radioactivity. Rectilinear scanner can scan the entire body. The image is then minified to fit a standard 36 cm x 43 cm film. As it uses a focused collimator, it measures radiation distribution 7.5 - 12.5 cm from the end of the collimator. Thus, a scan from both sides of the patient is often necessary. A few scanners have 2 detectors facing each other to scan simultaneously. Other types of image Image can also be made Because of these defects, the invention of the gamma camera by Hal Angers in 1956 was indeed a breakthrough.
