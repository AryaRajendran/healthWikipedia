 The Association of American Cancer Institutes (AACI) is a membership association of 95 academic and freestanding cancer research centers in the United States. AACI's membership roster consists of National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated centers and academic-based cancer research programs that receive National Institute of Health (NIH) and NCI support. The association is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. AACI cancer centers serve as the headquarters for most of the NCI sponsored clinical trials. In addition to providing their local populations ready access to a wide array of cancer specialists—multidisciplinary experts in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and cancer care—AACI cancer centers have developed partnerships with local community and state health agencies to design and implement programs aimed at reducing the overall cancer burden of the region. ;Alabama ; Arizona ; Arkansas ; California ; Colorado ; Connecticut ; District of Columbia ; Florida ; Hawaii ; Illinois ; Indiana ; Iowa ; Kansas ; Kentucky ; Louisiana ; Maine ; Maryland ; Massachusetts ; Michigan ; Minnesota ; Missouri ; Nebraska ; New Hampshire ; New Jersey ; New Mexico ; New York ; North Carolina ; Ohio ; Oklahoma Peggy and Charles Stephenson Cancer Center University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center ; Oregon ; Pennsylvania ; Puerto Rico ; South Carolina ; Tennessee ; Texas ; Utah ; Vermont ; Virginia ; Washington ; West Virginia ; Wisconsin
