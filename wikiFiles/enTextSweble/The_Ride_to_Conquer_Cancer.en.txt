 The Ride to Conquer Cancer is an annual charity fundraiser held in various locations across Canada and Australia. It is organized as a non-competitive cycling event that sees thousands of riders travel over over two days. It was first held in the Toronto area in 2008 and raised $14 million for the Princess Margaret Hospital. Following the success of the first ride, the event spread to Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver beginning in 2009, and to Brisbane in 2011. In the four Canadian events in 2011, 11,000 riders raised $43.9 million. The Ride to Conquer Cancer was created in 2008 as a "mega-event" fundraiser in support of the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. Differing from other fundraisers, the event focused on having a relatively small number of participants raise considerably more money in support of cancer research. Each participant is required to raise a minimum of $2,500 in order to ride. The event was a success, raising $14 million for the hospital and spawning three more rides in other locations across the country for 2009. It has quickly grown to become the largest cycling fundraiser in Canadian history, raising $88 million between 2008 and 2010. The title sponsor for the four Canadian events is Enbridge, and between 2008 and 2011, the ride has raised over $130 million. The Ontario ride originates in Toronto and travels down to Niagara Falls. 4,610 riders raised $17.5 million in support of the Princess Margaret Hospital in 2011, topping the 2010 record of $16.1 million. The British Columbia ride originates in Vancouver, and crosses into the United States to finish in Seattle. Nearly 2,900 riders raised $11.1 million in 2011 in support of the B.C. Cancer Foundation, in addition to the $18 million raised in the first two rides. The Alberta ride originates at Spruce Meadows in Calgary and heads southwest to Chain Lakes Provincial Park in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains before returning to Calgary. 2,880 riders raised $8.6 million in support of the Alberta Cancer Foundation in 2011, both records. The event raised $14.2 million in its first two rides of 2009 and 2010. The Quebec ride originates at Montreal and finishes in Quebec City and supports Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. 1,886 riders raised $6.7 million in 2011. The event went international in 2011, as the The Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer took place in Brisbane in August 2011 and 2012. The event has raised nearly $10 million for cancer research at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, one of the largest research institutes in Australia.
