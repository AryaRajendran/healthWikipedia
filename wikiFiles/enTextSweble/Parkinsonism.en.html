 Parkinsonism (also known as Parkinson's syndrome, atypical Parkinson's, or secondary Parkinson's) is a neurological syndrome (not the specific disease) characterized by tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. The underlying causes of parkinsonism are numerous, and diagnosis can be complex. The neurodegenerative condition Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism. However, a wide range of other etiologies may lead to a similar set of symptoms, including some toxins, a few metabolic diseases, and a handful of non-PD neurological conditions. The age of the person presenting with parkinsonism is significant. A 20 year old person might present with Parkinsonism. Younger patients should be checked for the many causes of parkinsonism listed in the differential etiology below, including Wilson disease and not immediately be given the diagnosis of Parkinson "disease". However, Juvenile Parkinson disease can cause parkinsonism in a child or young adult. In contrast a 60 year old person might present with Parkinsonism, at first be diagnosed with Parkinson Disease, then determined to have a Parkinson plus syndrome. About 7% of people with parkinsonism have developed their symptoms following treatment with particular medications. Side effect of medications, mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially the phenothiazines (such as perphenazine and chlorpromazine), thioxanthenes (such as flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol) and butyrophenones (such as haloperidol (Haldol)), piperazines (such as ziprasidone), and, rarely, antidepressants. The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism increases with age. Drug induced parkinsonism tends to remain at it's presenting level, i.e. does not progress like the parkinson disease. Before Parkinson's disease is diagnosed the differential diagnosis or list of potential causes for Parkinsonism must be investigated and includes:
