 Chronic allograft nephropathy, abbreviated CAN and also known as sclerosing/chronic allograft nephropathy, is the leading cause of kidney transplant failure and happens month to years after the transplant. CAN is characterized by a gradual decline in kidney function and, typically, accompanied by high blood pressure and hematuria. CAN is diagnosed by examination of tissue, e.g. a kidney biopsy. The histopathology is characterized by interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, fibrotic intimal thickening of arteries and glomerulosclerosis.
