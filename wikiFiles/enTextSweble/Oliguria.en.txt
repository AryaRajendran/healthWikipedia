 Oliguria is the low output of urine, It is clinically classified as an output below 300-500ml/day. The decreased output of urine may be a sign of dehydration, renal failure, hypovolemic shock, HHNS hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, urinary obstruction/urinary retention, DKA, pre-eclampsia, and urinary tract infections, among other conditions. The most extreme type of Oliguria is called anuria, which represents an absence of urine, clinically classified as below 50ml/day. Oliguria is defined as a urine output that is less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants, less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children, and less than 400 mL or 500 mL per 24h in adults - this equals 17 or 21 mL/hour. For example, in an adult weighing 70Â kg it equals 0.24 or 0.3 ml/hour/kg. Alternatively, however, the value of 0.5 mL/kg/h is commonly used to define oliguria in adults as well. Olig- (or oligo-) is a Greek prefix meaning small or few. Anuria is defined as less than 50mL urine output per day. Perform ultrasound examination of the kidney to rule out obstructive processes. The pathophysiologic mechanisms causing oliguria can be categorized globally in three different categories: Patients usually have decrease in urine output after a major operation that may be a normal physiological response to: Oliguria, when defined as less than 1 mL/kg/h, in infants is not considered to be a reliable sign of renal failure.
