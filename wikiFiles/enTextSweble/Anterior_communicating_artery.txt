 In human anatomy, the anterior communicating artery is a blood vessel of the brain that connects the left and right anterior cerebral arteries. The anterior communicating artery connects the two anterior cerebral arteries across the commencement of the longitudinal fissure. Sometimes this vessel is wanting, the two arteries joining together to form a single trunk, which afterward divides; or it may be wholly, or partially, divided into two. Its length averages about 4 mm, but varies greatly. It gives off some of the anteromedial ganglionic vessels, but these are principally derived from the anterior cerebral artery. It is part of the cerebral arterial circle, also known as the circle of Willis. Aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery are the most common circle of Willis aneurysm and can cause visual field defects such as bitemporal hemianopsia, psychopathology and frontal lobe pathology.
