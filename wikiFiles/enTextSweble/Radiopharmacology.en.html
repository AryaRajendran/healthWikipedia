 Radiopharmacology is the study and preparation of radiopharmaceuticals, which are radioactive pharmaceuticals. Radiopharmaceuticals are used in the field of nuclear medicine as tracers in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. Many radiopharmaceuticals use technetium-99m (Tc-99m) which has many useful properties as a gamma-emitting tracer nuclide. In the book Technetium a total of 31 different radiopharmaceuticals based on Tc-99m are listed for imaging and functional studies of the brain, myocardium, thyroid, lungs, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood and tumors. The term radioisotope has historically been used to refer to all radiopharmaceuticals, and this usage remains common. Technically, however, many radiopharmaceuticals incorporate a radioactive tracer atom into a larger pharmaceutically-active molecule, which is localized in the body, after which the radionuclide tracer atom allows it to be easily detected with a gamma camera or similar gamma imaging device. An example is fludeoxyglucose in which fluorine-18 is incorporated into deoxyglucose. Some radioisotopes (for example gallium-67, gallium-68, and radioiodine) are used directly as soluble ionic salts, without further modification. This use relies on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the body. See nuclear medicine. Production of a radiopharmaceutical involves two processes: Radionuclides used in radiopharmaceuticals are mostly radioactive isotopes of elements with atomic numbers less than that of bismuth, that is, they are radioactive isotopes of elements that also have one or more stable isotopes. These may be roughly divided into two classes: Because radiopharmeuticals require special licenses and handling techniques, they are often kept in local centers for medical radioisotope storage, often known as radiopharmacies. A radiopharmacist may dispense them from there, to local centers where they are handled at the practical medicine facility. A list of nuclear medicine radiopharmaceuticals follows. Some radioisotopes* are used in ionic or inert form without attachment to a pharmaceutical, these are also included. There is a section for each radioisotope with a table of radiopharmaceuticals using that radioisotope. The sections are ordered alphabetically by the English name of the radioisotope. Sections for the same element are then ordered by atomic mass number. 47Ca is a beta and gamma emitter. 11C is a positron emitter. 14C is a beta emitter. 51Cr is a gamma emitter. 57Co is a gamma emitter. 58Co is a gamma emitter. 169Er is a beta emitter. 18F is a positron emitter with a half life of 109 minutes. It is produced in medical cyclotrons, usually from oxygen-18, and then chemically attached to a pharmaceutical. See PET scan. 67Ga is a gamma emitter. See gallium scan. 68Ga is a positron emitter, with a 68 minute half life, produced by elution from germanium-68 in a gallium-68 generator. See also positron emission tomography. 3H or tritium is a beta emitter. 111In is a gamma emitter. 123I is a gamma emitter. It is used only diagnostically, as its radiation is penetrating and short-lived. 125I is a gamma emitter with a long half-life of 59.4 days (the longest of all radioiodines used in medicine). Iodine-123 is preferred for imaging, so I-125 is used diagnostically only when the test requires a longer period to prepare the radiopharmaceutical and trace it, such as a fibrinogen scan to diagnose clotting. I-125's gamma radiation is of medium penetration, making it more useful as a therapeutic isotope for brachytherapy implant of radioisotope capsules for local treatment of cancers. 131I is a beta and gamma emitter. It is used both to destroy thyroid and thyroid cancer tissues (via beta radiation, which is short-range), and also other neuroendocrine tissues when used in MIBG. It can also be seen by a gamma camera, and can serve as a diagnostic imaging tracer, when treatment is also being attempted at the same time. However iodine-123 is usually preferred when only imaging is desired. 59Fe is a beta and gamma emitter. 81Krm is a gamma emitter. 13N is a positron emitter. 15O is a positron emitter. 32P is a beta emitter. 82Rb is a positron and gamma emitter. 153Sm is a beta and gamma emitter. 75Se is a gamma emitter. 22Na is a positron and gamma emitter. 24Na is a beta and gamma emitter. 89Sr is a beta emitter. 99Tc is a gamma emitter. It is obtained on-site at the imaging center as the soluble pertechnetate which is eluted from a technetium-99m generator, and then either used directly as this soluble salt, or else used to synthesize a number of technetium-99m-based radiopharmaceuticals. ... 201Tl is a gamma emitter. 133Xe is a gamma emitter. 90Y is a beta emitter.
