 The hypophyseal portal system is the system of blood vessels that link the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary in the brain. It allows endocrine communication between the two structures : the hypothalamus secretes releasing and inhibitory hormones in the portal system such as corticotropin-releasing hormone or thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and they are received by the anterior pituitary. Using these, the anterior pituitary is able to fulfill its function of regulating the other endocrine glands. Hypophysiotropic peptides released near the median eminence are transported to the anterior pituitary, where they exert their physiologic effects. Branches from the internal carotid artery provide the blood supply to the pituitary. The superior hypophyseal arteries form the primary capillary plexus that supplies blood to the median eminence. From this capillary network, the blood is drained in long hypophyseal portal veins into the secondary plexus. The hypophysiotropic peptides released at the median eminence enter the primary plexus capillaries. From there, they are transported to the anterior pituitary via the long hypophyseal portal veins to the secondary plexus. The secondary plexus is a network of fenestrated sinusoid capillaries that provides the blood supply to the anterior pituitary. The cells of the anterior pituitary express specific G protein-coupled receptors that bind the neuropeptides, activating intracellular second-messenger cascades that produce the release of anterior pituitary hormones. It is one of the portal systems of circulation of the human body; that is, it involves two capillary beds connected in series by venules. One other such system is the hepatic portal system. Mechanism for hormone transport via hypothalamoportal vessels:
