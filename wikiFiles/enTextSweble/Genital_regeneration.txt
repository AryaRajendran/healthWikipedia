 Genital regeneration encompasses many forms of treatment, all of which aim to help those who have been victims of substantial genital trauma. The goal of genital regeneration is to restore proper form and function of the damaged parts of the male or female genitalia by manipulating the body's capacity to heal in order to restore the missing anatomy of the genitals. In order to do this, doctors, such as Wake Forest's Anthony Atala MD, have been experimenting with stem cells and an extracellular matrix that provides a framework for these stem cells as well as local cells to regenerate missing body parts. Great progress has been made, but far more research must be done to successfully turn regeneration from a lab project to a routine procedure. Those who stand to benefit most from further research and application in this field are those born with congenital defects, have genital cancer, have sustained injuries that have excised parts of their genitalia (most notably soldiers in war), transgender women/men, and men and women displeased with their circumcisions. Often in science, and especially in this field, the accomplishments of genital regeneration will be applied to other subfields in regeneration and vice-versa as scientists continue to understand how to properly engineer living tissue. There are various regenerative and therapeutic methods available today that address individuals with unique medical needs. These therapies include those dealing with regenerative technology, uncircumcising methods, and a host of other categories. In the last decade, there have been numerous notable accomplishments made possible by utilizing extracellular matrices and stem cells to reconstruct lost tissue. These accomplishments include all parts of the bodies including the genitals. For males, no extracellular matrix therapy exists currently to regenerate damaged genitalia. However, Professor Atala and his group at Wake Forest University's Institute of Regenerative Medicine have successfully regenerated fully functioning rabbit penises from rabbits whose penises were excised for the sake of the experiment. To regrow these penises, autologous cells were attached to a 3-D collagen matrix (ECM). Once ready, these regrown penises were attached and fully functional on the rabbits whose penises had been excised. Proponents of regenerative medicine say that experiments like these show the potential benefits of investing in regenerative medicine for those with genital and other types of injuries. For women, an Italian doctor named Dr. Cinzia Marchese has successfully reconstructed the inner mucosal lining of congenitally deformed vaginas by using an enzyme to break down the abnormal mucosal lining in the vagina and then inserting stem cells to remodel the vaginal walls to restore normal function. Results such as these provide stronger evidence for proponents of regenerative medicine that stem cells have a future in medicine. Circumcision remains a highly controversial topic. The reasons for this controversy stem from cultural differences, religious significance, and potential medical benefits and risks. For males, the recovering of the glans after circumcision, or uncircumcision, by hanging weights on the remaining penile skin has been around since before the Common Era. Throughout history, much of the demand for uncircumcision was driven by the fear of persecution for being Jewish. In modern times, there have been many anti-circumcision groups who openly oppose male circumcision (i.g. NOCIRC, Intact America, etc.) for a variety of reasons. Men wishing to uncircumcise themselves have the option to undergo foreskin restoration, which is either surgically grafting skin onto the penis, or hanging weights on the penile skin as discussed above as to induce tissue expansion. There are no regeneration therapies currently available, but there is an organization which is currently facilitating trials to apply ECM therapies to circumcised males. For females, there is currently no therapy that uses autologous cells to regenerate the clitoris. However there is a surgery developed by a French surgeon, Pierre Fold√®s MD, that exposes the unexposed clitoris. This surgery has had success in restoring pleasure and reducing pain associated with sexual intercourse with a circumcised vagina. There are other therapies whose goal is to restore normal genital anatomy that do not utilize autologous cells or attempt to mitigate the effects of a circumcision. For women in need of vaginal tissue regeneration, there is a patent pending vibration therapy combined with a vaginal lubricant, developed by Ellen L. Barnard and Myrtile Wilhite, to promote new vaginal cell lining growth. For those women who are in need of new cell growth in the vulvar area, there is a patent pending topical cream, developed by Lyle Corporate Development, Inc., containing cyclopentanohydrophenanthrene ring systems. This topical claims to revitalize vaginal tissue that has undergone the effects of vaginal cell hypoxia. There are organizations which perform research into or conduct genital regeneration, such as the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the United States Department of Defense, and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.
