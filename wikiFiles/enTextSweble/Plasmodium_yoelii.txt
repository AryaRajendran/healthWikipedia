 Plasmodium yoelii is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium subgenus Vinckeia. Like all Plasmodium species P. yoelii has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are mammals. This species was described in 1968 by Landau, Michel and Adam. This species occurs in Africa. The natural vectors of this species are not currently known. This species infects Thamnonys rutilans Three subspecies are recognised: P. yoelii killicki, P. yoelii nigeriensis and P. yoelii yoelli. Its most notable feature is that it is used in the laboratory to infect mice, as a model of human malaria, particularly with respect to the immune response. It is advantageous to have a whole-animal model of malaria because often it is difficult to know which factors to study in vitro, particularly in a complex system like the immune system. Moreover, for many experiments it is not ethical or practical to use humans. One of the special things about this particular model is that it has two strains with vastly different pathogenicity. These are generally referred to as the "lethal" and "non-lethal" strains of the species. Comparison of these two strains can be used to deduce which factors may contribute to more serious malaria infections in humans. ;Information about the genome and genes of P. yoelii:
