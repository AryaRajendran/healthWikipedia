 Zenana (, , ). The literal meaning of the word zenana is "of the women" or "pertaining to women". It contextually refers to the part of a house belonging to a Hindu or Muslim family in South Asia which is reserved for the women of the household. The Zenana are the inner apartments of a house in which the women of the family live. The outer apartments for guests and men are called the Mardana. The Zenana missions were by women missionaries, who went to Indian women in their own homes with the aim of converting them to Christianity. The Baptist Missionary Society inaugurated Zenana missions to India in the early 19th century. The concept was later taken up by other churches such as the Church of England (the Church of England Zenana Missionary Society, London) and extended to other countries such as China. By the 1880s, the "Zenana missions" added medical work to their ministry to encourage conversions and became Zenana Bible and Medical Mission. This involved recruiting female doctors, both by persuading female doctors in Europe to come to India and by encouraging Indian women to study medicine in their pursuit of conversion. They also provided schooling for girls, including the principles of the Christian faith. As a result, the Zenana missions helped break down the male bias against colonial medicine in India to a small extent. A 11/17/2011 "Men of the Bible" entry from BibleGateway about the apostle Peter mentions Peter's Syrian mission with Antioch as a center, 44-61 AD, during which he was accompanied by his wife, who became the pioneer zenana missionary. The Church of England Zenana Mission was a British Anglican missionary society that was involved in sending workers to countries such as India (19th and 20th centuries) and China (late Qing Dynasty, beginning in 1884).
