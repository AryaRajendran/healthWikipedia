 A seizure threshold is the balance between excitatory and inhibitory forces in the brain which affects how susceptible one is to seizures. Those diagnosed with epilepsy or certain other neurological conditions are vulnerable to sudden new seizures if the threshold is upset, and so must be especially careful and compliant with their therapeutic drug regimen, if they must use anticonvulsants. Drugs such as the antidepressant and nicotinic antagonist bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban) and the analgesic tramadol (Ultram, Ultram ER, Ultracet) can lower the seizure threshold. So can other factors, including: exposure to neon or laser flashing lights, lengthy periods of fasting, malnutrition, starvation, lengthy periods of high stress and/or fear, fatigue and exhaustion, uncontrolled diabetes, other endocrine and/or metabolic irregularities (like electrolyte or hormonal imbalances), cancer, and certain disorders of the nervous, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems.
