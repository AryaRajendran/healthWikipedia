 The Swank Diet is a low saturated fat diet for the treatment of multiple sclerosis developed by Roy L. Swank (1909-2008), which he introduced in 1948. Swank's research has been disputed due to methodological concerns. Currently there is not enough evidence to suggest that dietary interventions have any major effect on the course of multiple sclerosis. The diet consists of: Swank's research on 144 patients over a 34-year period was published in The Lancet in 1990. The study indicated that those who followed the diet had not shown any significant deterioration of their condition over a 34-year period, while those that did not follow the diet did significantly deteriorate over the same period. Swank's research has been disputed because it lacked double-blind testing. Moreover, overall evidence is insufficient to indicate any potential benefit from diet interventions in MS.
