 RTS,S or Mosquirix is an experimental vaccine for malaria. A completely effective vaccine is not yet available for malaria, although several vaccines are under development. SPf66 was tested extensively in endemic areas in the 1990s, but clinical trials showed it to be insufficiently effective. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the malaria parasite's life cycle, have also been insufficient on their own. RTS,S is one of several potential vaccines under development that target the pre-erythrocytic stage of the disease. Among them, RTS,S has shown the most promising results so far. In November 2012, findings from a Phase III trial of RTS,S reported that it provided modest protection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants. The RTS,S vaccine was engineered using genes from the outer protein of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite and a portion of a hepatitis B virus and a chemical adjuvant to boost the immune system response. The RTS,S-based vaccine formulation had previously been demonstrated to be safe, well tolerated, immunogenic, and to potentially confer partial efficacy in both malaria-naive and -experienced adults as well as children, although further research was considered necessary to improve the effectiveness of the vaccine. RTS,S is being developed by PATH, GlaxoSmithKline and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
