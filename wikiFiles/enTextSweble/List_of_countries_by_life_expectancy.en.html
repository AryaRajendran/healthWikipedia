 This is a list of countries by life expectancy at birth. Life expectancy equals the average number of years a person born in a given country would live if mortality at each age remains constant in the future. Each entry includes total population as well as the male and female components. Several non-sovereign entities are also included in this list. The figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including ongoing wars, obesity, and HIV/AIDS infections. Worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 67.88 years (65.71 years for males and 70.14 years for females) over the period 2005â€“2010 according to United Nations World Population Prospects 2010 Revision, and 66.57 years (64.52 years for males and 68.76 years for females) for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009. Women on average live longer than men in all countries, with the exception of Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Swaziland and Afghanistan. Many of the countries with the lowest life expectancies, namely Swaziland, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, the Central African Republic, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau, are suffering from very high rates of HIV/AIDS infection, with adult prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 38.8 percent. In countries with high infant mortality rates, the life expectancy at birth will be lower, and may not reflect the life expectancy of a person who has survived his or her first year of life. On 3 May 2011, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), Population Division, released World Population Prospects, The 2010 Revision. The following table shows the life expectancy at birth for the period 2005 to 2010.
