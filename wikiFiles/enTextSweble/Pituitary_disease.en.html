 A Pituitary disease is a disorder primarily affecting the pituitary gland. The main disorders involving the pituitary gland are: Over- or underproduction of a pituitary hormone will effect the respective end-organ. For example insufficient production (hyposecretion) of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the pituitary gland will cause hypothyroidism, while overproduction (hypersecretion) of TSH will cause hyperthyroidism. Thyroidisms caused by the pituitary gland are less common though, accounting for less than 10% of all hypothyroidism cases and much less than 1% of hyperthyroidism cases.
