 Stedman's Medical Dictionary is designed in a dictionary format to provide the language of medicine, nursing and the allied health profession. It is made up of terms, images and appendices. It can be used to look up medical terms, abbreviation, acronyms, measurements and more. Pronunciation and word etymology (showing mostly Latin and Greek prefix and roots) are also provided with most definitions. There are over 54,000 terms and 900 illustrations included in the current print edition of Stedman's Medical Dictionary. If a hard copy of the text is purchased, it comes with a CD that can be easily searched and navigated. The CD also includes audio pronunciation to all terms and even more images. Most of Stedman’s products can now be purchased in electronic only versions. These come with all the terms, definitions, images, appendixes with the benefits of electronic searching and networking.
