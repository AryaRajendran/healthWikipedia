 Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is the highest level of pressure applied to the lungs during inhalation. In mechanical ventilation the number reflects a positive pressure in centimeters of water pressure (cmH2O). In normal breathing, it may sometimes be referred to as the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIPO), which is a negative value.
