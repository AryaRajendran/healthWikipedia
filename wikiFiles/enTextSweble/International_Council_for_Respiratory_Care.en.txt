 The International Council for Respiratory Care (ICRC) is a professional organization established in 1991 by the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) and currently consists of 25 member countries. The mission of the ICRC is to promote the profession of the respiratory therapist internationally. Most countries do not utilize the respiratory therapist like the United States and Canada do, the therapeutic methods are split between nursing practitioners and specialized physiotherapists.
