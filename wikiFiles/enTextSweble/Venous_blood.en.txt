 Venous blood is deoxygenated blood which travels from the peripheral vessels, through the venous system into the right atrium. Deoxygenated blood is then pumped by the right ventricle to lungs via the pulmonary artery which is divided in two branches, left and right to the left and right lungs respectively. Blood is oxygenated in lungs and returns to the left atrium through pulmonary veins. Venous blood is typically colder than arterial blood, and has a lower oxygen content and pH. It also has lower concentrations of glucose and other nutrients, and has higher concentrations of urea and shoes waste products. The difference in the oxygen content of the blood between the arterial blood and the venous blood is known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference. Most medical laboratory test are conducted on venous blood, with the exception of arterial blood gas tests. It is obtained for lab work by venipuncture (also called phlebotomy), or by fingerprick for small quantities. Human blood is red, ranging from bright red when oxygenated to dark red when not. It owes its color to hemoglobin, to which oxygen binds. There exists a popular misconception that deoxygenated blood is blue and that blood only becomes red when it comes into contact with oxygen. Blood is never blue, but veins appear blue because light is diffused by skin. Moreover, the blood inside is dark red and exhibits poor light reflection. From a physiological perspective, veins and arteries appear similar when skin is removed and are seen directly. The appearance of veins as dark blue is a wavelength phenomenon, having to do with the reflection of blue light away from the outside of venous tissue if the vein is at 0.02 inches deep or more. Deoxygenated blood is darker than oxygenated blood due to the difference in color between deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin. Venous blood is used during stem cell donation.
