 Keele University School of Medicine based at Keele University in Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, England, was established in 2002. The first two years of the school's MBChB course are taught on Keele University campus. Years three to five are mainly taught within the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent, at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals Trust, Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust, North Staffs Combined Healthcare Trust and South Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare Foundation Trust. Medical students also have placements in general practices in Staffordshire and Shropshire. The school accepts 120 UK/EU and 10 non-EU medical students each year for the 5-year MBChB course and 10 UK/EU/non-EU students for the 6-year course. The Royal Commission on Medical Education (1965–68) issued its report (popularly known as the Todd Report) in 1968 on the state of medical education in the United Kingdom. The commission estimated that by 1994 there would be a need to train more than 4,500 doctors a year for the United Kingdom, and that this would have to be achieved by both increasing the numbers of medical students at existing medical schools, and establishing a number of new ones. It recommended that new medical schools should be immediately established at the universities of Nottingham, Southampton and Leicester, but that this would still not produce enough doctors. It considered the possibility of a medical schools being established at Keele University, Hull University, Warwick University and Swansea University (then University College, Swansea). It was considered that North Staffordshire would be a very good site as it had a large local population and several large hospitals. However, it was considered that it would need a minimum intake of 150 students a year would be necessary to make it economically and educationally viable. It was considered that Keele University was at that time too small to support a medical school of this size. However, it was recommended that the hospital rebuilding programme going on at that time, should take account of the possible future establishment of a medical school. The commission envisaged a medical school Keele between 1975 and 1990. In 1978, Keele Department of Postgraduate Medicine opened. This department conducted medical research, and played a part in postgraduate medical education, but did not teach undergraduate medical students. In 2002, over 30 years after the publication of the Todd Report, the current medical school was founded. From 2002 the school began teaching clinical undergraduate medicine to clinical medical students who had completed their pre-clinical medical education at either School of Medicine, University of Manchester or the Bute Medical School (University of St Andrews). These students followed the curriculum of the Manchester School of Medicine clinical course, and after three years of clinical study at Keele, were awarded the degrees of MBChB by the University of Manchester. The first cohort of students completing their course at Keele did so in 2005. In 2003, Keele started teaching the full five-year course, using the Manchester curriculum. Both pre-clinical and clinical medical education were established in Staffordshire and Shropshire. Keele began to develop its own undergraduate medical curriculum in 2007. From the 2011/12 academic year all students have followed the Keele curriculum. In January 2012 it was announced that the General Medical Council (GMC) had approved and registered the new five-year undergraduate curriculum. Students graduating in 2012 will be awarded the Keele MBChB, wearing a new Keele two-colour hood reflecting the fact that students gain two degrees Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. Previously medical students at Keele have graduated with a Manchester degree. The GMC visited and scrutinised progress throughout the course’s development and reports are available on the GMC's website. Keele's curriculum is integrated, with clinical experience and skills being taught in years one and two, and weekly science teaching in year three. A small number of graduate entry places are available for year two of the course and there is a six-year option for applicants with non-science qualifications. From 2006, applicants have been required to sit the UKCAT admission test. Years 1 and 2 teaching takes place on Keele University campus. Clinical teaching, years 3-5, takes place at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire site, in Hartshill. Teaching at Keele also involves attachments at District General hospitals in Stafford, Shrewsbury and Telford, as well as attachments to General Practitioners (GP) in Staffordshire and Shropshire. Keele Medical School promotes the use of online learning material, such as Keele Basic Bites, which is a free online video-based learning tool for Keele University Medical students, created by Senior Academic Staff Dr Russell Crawford and Dr Andrew Morris, providing medical education in an entertaining, as well as an informative fashion. Keele medical students formed the Keele Medical Society (KMS) in 2005. The organisation aims to represent students and promote social inclusion. In January 2013 work started on £2.8m state of the art Anatomy Skills Facility. The school will join a select group of institutions offering leading edge facilities to attract surgeons from across the UK. This will also provide improved facilities for students and also offer senior surgeons the chance to improve high level skills. The work should be completed by August 2013.
