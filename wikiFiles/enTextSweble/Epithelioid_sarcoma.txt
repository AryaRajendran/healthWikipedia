 Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare mesenchymal soft tissue tumour with an epithelioid pattern. It often occurs in the extremities, and is more commonly found in young adults. The diagnosis is made by examination of tissue, e.g. a biopsy. The diagnosis may be delayed because of the unusual nature of the tumour and its rarity. Its histomorphology near perfectly may mimic an adenocarcinoma, melanoma or granuloma. Their immunohistochemical profile may mimic those of carcinomas; thus, these tumours may be misdiagnosed as such. They typically stain for vimentin and keratins. They characteristically have loss of staining for SMARCB1 (INI1, BAF47), and typically stain for CA125.
