 The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is a UK government agency which is responsible for ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency was formed in 2003 with the merger of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA). In April 2013, it merged with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) and was rebranded, with the MHRA identity being used for the parent organisation and one of the centres within the group. It is an executive agency of the Department of Health. The agency employs over 900 people. The MHRA is divided into three main centres: In 1999, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) took over control of the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) from Office for National Statistics. Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) merged in 2003 to form the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (with a lower case "products" at that time). In April 2012, the GPRD was expanded and relaunched as the Clinical Practice Datalink (CPRD). In April 2013, the MHRA merged with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) and was rebranded, with the MHRA identity being used for the parent organisation and one of the centres within the group. At the same time the CPRD was formally declared a separate centre if the MHRA as well. MHRA hosts and supports a number of expert advisory bodies, including the Commission on Human Medicine which replaced the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in 2005, and the British Pharmacopoeia Commission. As part of the European system of approval, MHRA or other national bodies can be the rapporteur or co-rapporteur for any given pharmaceutical application, taking on the bulk of the verification work on behalf of all members, while the documents are still sent to other members as and where requested.
