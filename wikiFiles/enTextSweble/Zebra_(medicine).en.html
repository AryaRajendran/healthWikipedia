 Zebra is a medical slang term for a surprising diagnosis. Although rare diseases are, in general, surprising when they are encountered, other diseases can be surprising in a particular person and time, and so "zebra" is the broader concept. The term derives from the aphorism "When you hear hoofbeats behind you, don't expect to see a zebra", which was coined in a slightly modified form in the late 1940s by Dr. Theodore Woodward, a former professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. Since horses are the most commonly encountered hoofed animal for most people and zebras are comparatively rarely encountered, logically one could confidently guess that the animal making the hoofbeats is probably a horse. By 1960, the aphorism was widely known in medical circles. As explained by Sotos, medical novices are predisposed to make rare diagnoses because of: (a) the availability heuristic ("events more easily remembered are judged more probable") combined with (b) the well-known phenomenon, first enunciated in Rhetorica ad Herennium (circa 85 BC), that "the striking and the novel stay longer in the mind." Thus, the aphorism has a valid role in teaching medical students to be better diagnosticians. Three master diagnosticians have noted, however, that cautions against making surprising diagnoses (e.g. of a rare disease) are not valid in practitioners with greater knowledge and experience: A related, but distinct, term for an obscure and rare diagnosis in medicine is fascinoma.
