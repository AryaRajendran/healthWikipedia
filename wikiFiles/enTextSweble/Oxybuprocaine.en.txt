 Oxybuprocaine (INN), also known as benoxinate or BNX, is a local anesthetic, which is used especially in ophthalmology and otolaryngology. Oxybuprocaine is sold by Novartis under the brand names Novesine or Novesin. Safety for use in pregnancy and lactation has not been established. Anaesthesia starts with a latency of 30 to 50 seconds and lasts for about 10 to 30 minutes, depending on perfusion. The drug is metabolised by esterases in blood plasma and liver. When used excessively, oxybuprocaine like any other topical anesthetic used in the eye and on mucous membranes (like for example tetracaine, proxymetacaine and proparacaine) can cause irritation, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, irreversible corneal damage and even complete destruction of the cornea. (Excessive use means several times a day during several days or even weeks.) Oxybuprocaine is incompatible with silver and mercury salts, as well as basic substances. It also reduces the antimicrobial action of sulfonamides.
