 Tidal volume is the lung volume representing the normal volume of air displaced between normal inspiration and expiration when extra effort is not applied. In a healthy, young adult, tidal volume is approximately 500 ml per inspiration or 7 ml/kg of body weight. Tidal volume plays a significant role during mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate ventilation without causing trauma to the lungs. Tidal volume is measured in milliliters and ventilation volumes are estimated based on a patient's ideal body weight. Measurement of tidal volume can be affected (usually overestimated) by leaks in the breathing circuit or the introduction of additional gas, for example during the introduction of nebulized drugs. Ventilator-induced lung injury such as ALI/ARDS can be caused by ventilation with very large tidal volumes in normal lungs, as well as ventilation with moderate or smaumes in previously injured lungs, and research shows that the incidence of ALI increases with higher tidal volume settings in nonneurologically-impaired patients. initial settings of mechanical ventilation: use the rule of 12-12, meaning 12 ml/kg is programmed to be delivered 12 times a minute in the assist control mode. use the rule of 10-10, meaning 10 ml/kg is programmed to be delivered 10 times a minute in the assist control mode. There is evidence that limiting tidal volume to 6-8 ml/kg may be beneficial in the management of ARDS. In ARDS Mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of therapy. PEEP levels of up to 15 cm H2O are used.
