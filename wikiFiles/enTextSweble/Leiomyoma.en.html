 A leiomyoma (plural is 'leiomyomata') is a benign smooth muscle neoplasm that is very rarely (0.1%) premalignant. They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel and the esophagus. Uterine fibroids are leiomyomata of the uterine smooth muscle. As other leiomyomata, they are benign, but may lead to excessive menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), often cause anemia and may lead to infertility. A rare form of these tumors is uterine lipoleiomyoma - benign tumors consisting of a mixture of adipocytes and smooth muscle cells. Uterine lipoleiomyomata have been observed together with ovarian and other pathologies and some of them may develop into liposarcoma. These tumors are monoclonal, and non-random chromosomal abnormalities have seen in 40% of the tumors. They are also the most common benign esophageal tumour, though this accounts for less than 1% of esophageal neoplasms. The remainder consists mainly of carcinomas. Although the vast majority of benign esophageal tumors are clinically silent and go undetected, large or strategically located tumors may become symptomatic. Leiomyomas of the skin are generally (1) acquired, and (2) divided into several categories: Leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor of small bowel. Approximately 50% of cases are found in the jejunum, followed by the ileum in 31% of cases. Almost one half of all lesions are less than 5 centimeters.
