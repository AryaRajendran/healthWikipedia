 (–)-2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(4-tolyl)tropane (RTI-32, tolpane) is a phenyltropane-based cocaine analog that is important in the field of medicinal chemistry for performing SAR. It has similar properties in vitro to related drugs such as RTI-31. Whereas the potency of RTI-31 has been quoted as being as high as 64 x cocaine, RTI-32 is not anything like this strong.
