 The John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC) is part of the federal government of the United States and is the only arm of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) whose sole mission is to support global health. It is one of the 27 component organizations of the NIH, which is in turn part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It was formally established in 1968 and is headquartered at a central campus in Bethesda, Maryland, as well as funding research around the world. On July 1, 1968 President Lyndon Johnson issued an Executive Order establishing the John E. Fogarty International Center for Advanced Study in the Health Sciences at the National Institutes of Health. In the 40 years since, the span of a single generation-support for international biomedical and behavioral research and research training by the Fogarty International Center has grown from modest roots laid down at the outset-FIC's first year budget totaled $500,000-to a globe-encircling $66 million research, training, and capacity-building enterprise extending to over 100 countries and involving some 5,000 scientists in the U.S. and abroad. In 2008, the Fogarty Center is celebrating its 40th Anniversary. The Fogarty International Center, the international component of the NIH, addresses global health challenges through innovative and collaborative research and training programs and supports and advances the NIH mission through international partnerships. The Fogarty International Center's five-year strategic plan, Pathways to Global Health Research: Strategic Plan 2008-2011, will direct the Center's activities until 2012. Dr. Roger I. Glass, M.D., Ph.D., was named the Director of the Fogarty International Center and Associate Director for International Research by NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni, M.D., on March 31, 2006. He formally took office on June 11, 2006. Dr. Glass graduated from Harvard College in 1967, received a Fulbright Fellowship to study at the University of Buenos Aires in 1967, and received his M.D. from Harvard Medical School and his M.P.H. from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1972. He joined the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1977 as a medical officer assigned to the Environmental Hazards Branch. He received his doctorate from the University of Goteborg, Sweden in 1984, and joined the National Institutes of Health Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, where he worked on the molecular biology of rotavirus. In 1986, Dr. Glass returned to the CDC to become Chief of the Viral Gastroenteritis Unit at the National Center for Infectious Diseases. Dr. Glass's research interests are in the prevention of gastroenteritis from rotaviruses and noroviruses through the application of novel scientific research. He has maintained field studies in India, Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Russia, Vietnam, China and elsewhere. His research has been targeted toward epidemiologic studies to anticipate the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. He is fluent and often lectures in five languages. Dr. Glass has received numerous awards including the prestigious Charles C. Shepard Lifetime Scientific Achievement Award presented by the CDC in recognition of his 30-year career of scientific research application and leadership, and the Dr. Charles Merieux Award from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases for his work on rotavirus vaccines in the developing world.
