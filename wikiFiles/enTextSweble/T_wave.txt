 In electrocardiography, the T wave represents the repolarization (or recovery) of the ventricles. The interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to the apex of the T wave is referred to as the absolute refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period (or vulnerable period). The T wave contains more information than the QT interval. The T wave can be described by its symmetry, skewness, slope of ascending and descending limbs, amplitude and subintervals like the Tpeakâ€“Tend interval. In most leads, the T wave is positive. This is due to the repolarization of the membrane. During ventricle contraction (QRS wave), the heart hyperpolarizes to a point at which contraction is no longer possible. Through the action of the Na+/K+ pump, the heart muscle is repolarized to a state receptive to further conduction. This is why the T wave is positive; although the cell remains in a negatively charged state, the net effect is in the positive direction, and the ECG reports this as a positive spike. However, a negative T wave is normal in lead aVR. Lead V1 may have a positive, negative, or biphasic (positive followed by negative, or vice versa) T wave. In addition, it is not uncommon to have an isolated negative T wave in lead III, aVL, or aVF. Numbers from Lepeschkin E in
