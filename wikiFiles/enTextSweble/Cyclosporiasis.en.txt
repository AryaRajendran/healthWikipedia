 Cyclosporiasis is an infection with the protozoan Cyclospora cayetanensis, a pathogen transmitted by feces or feces-contaminated fresh produce and water. Outbreaks have been reported due to contaminated raspberries. It is not spread from person to person. It can be a cause of diarrhea for travelers. When an oocyst of Cyclospora cayetanensis enters the small intestine and invades the mucosa it incubates for about one week. After incubation the person begins to experience severe watery diarrhea, bloating, fever, stomach cramps, and muscle aches. Oocysts can be present due to using contaminated water or human feces as fertilizer. This infection primarily affects humans and other primates. Diagnosis can be difficult due to the lack of recognizable oocysts in the feces. Using tests like PCR-based DNA tests and acid-fast staining can help with identification. The infection is often treated with Co-trimoxazole, because traditional anti-protozoan drugs are not sufficient. To prevent transmission through food, cook food and try to avoid drinking stream water while outdoors. Haiti is one of the countries that is known to be highly endemic for the parasite Cyclospora. Symptoms of cyclosporiosis include prolonged watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, weight loss, anorexia, myalgia, and occasionally vomiting and/or fever. There is no vaccine to control Cyclospora or toxoplasmosis in humans at the present time but one is available for reduction of fetal losses in sheep.The cost to develop vaccine for humans and the fact that poor people are mostly affected has delayed development.
