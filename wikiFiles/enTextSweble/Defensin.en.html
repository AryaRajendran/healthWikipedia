 Defensins are small Cysteine-rich cationic proteins found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They have also been reported in plants. They are, and function as, host defense peptides. They are active against bacteria, fungi and many enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. They consist of 18-45 amino acids including six (in vertebrates) to eight conserved cysteine residues. Cells of the immune system contain these peptides to assist in killing phagocytosed bacteria, for example in neutrophil granulocytes and almost all epithelial cells. Most defensins function by binding to the microbial cell membrane, and, once embedded, forming pore-like membrane defects that allow efflux of essential ions and nutrients. The underlying genes responsible for defensin production are highly polymorphic. Some aspects are conserved, however; the hallmarks of a Î²-defensin are its small size, high density of cationic charge, and six-cysteine-residue motif. In general, they are encoded by two-exon genes, wherein the first exon encodes for a hydrophobic leader sequence and the second for a peptide containing the cysteine motif. In immature marsupials, because their immune system is underdeveloped at the time of birth, defensins play a major role in defense against pathogens. They are produced in the milk of the mother as well as by the young marsupial in question. Human genome contains theta-defensin genes, but they have a premature stop codon, hampering their expression. An artificial human theta-defensin, retrocyclin, was created by `fixing' the pseudogene, and it was shown to be effective against HIV and other viruses, including herpes simplex virus and influenza A. They act primarily by preventing these viruses from entering their target cells. Also interesting is the effect of alpha-defensins on the exotoxin produced by anthrax (Bacillus anthracis). Chun Kim et al. showed how anthrax, which produces a metalloprotease Lethal Factor (LF) protein to target MAPKK, is vulnerable to human neutrophil protein-1 (HNP-1). This group showed HNP-1 to behave as a reversible noncompetitive inhibitor of LF. Defensin-like proteins are also a component of platypus venom. Similar molecules (e.g. PMX-30063) are being developed as antibiotics. The alpha defensin peptides are increased in chronic inflammatory conditions. Alpha defensin are increased in several cancers, including colorectal cancer. An imbalance of defensins in the skin may contribute to acne. A reduction of ileal defensins may predispose to Crohn's disease. In one small study, a significant increase in alpha defensin levels was detected in T cell lysates of schizophrenia patients; in discordant twin pairs, unaffected twins also had an increase, although not as high as that of their ill siblings. The authors suggested that alpha-defensin levels might prove a useful marker for schizophrenia risk. Defensins are found in the human skin during inflammatory conditions like psoriasis and also during wound healing.
