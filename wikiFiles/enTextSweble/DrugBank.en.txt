 The DrugBank database, available at the University of Alberta, is a bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that combines detailed drug (i.e., chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e., sequence, structure, pathway) information. The database contains nearly 4800 drug entries including: More than 2500 protein (i.e., drug target, non-redundant) sequences are linked to these drug entries. Each DrugCard entry contains 148 data fields with half of the information being devoted to drug/chemical data and the other half devoted to drug target or protein data. It is maintained by David Wishart and Craig Knox. Users may query DrugBank in a number of ways:
