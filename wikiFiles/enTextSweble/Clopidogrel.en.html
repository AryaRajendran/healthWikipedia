 Clopidogrel (INN) is an oral, thienopyridine class antiplatelet agent used to inhibit blood clots in coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. It is marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi under the trade name Plavix. The drug works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12, an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) chemoreceptor on platelet cell membranes. Adverse effects include hemorrhage, severe neutropenia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Clopidogrel is a prodrug, the action of which may be related to an ADP receptor on platelet cell membranes. The drug specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin. Platelet inhibition can be demonstrated two hours after a single dose of oral clopidogrel, but the onset of action is slow, so that a loading-dose of 300 mg is usually administered. Clopidogrel is indicated for: It is also used, along with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, brand name Aspirin), for the prevention of thrombosis after placement of intracoronary stent or as an alternative antiplatelet drug for patients who are intolerant to ASA. International guidelines granted the highest grade of recommendation for NSTE-ACS, PCI and stent, for clopidogrel in addition to ASA. Consensus-based therapeutic guidelines also recommend the use of clopidogrel rather than ASA for antiplatelet therapy in patients with a history of gastric ulceration, as inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by ASA can exacerbate this condition. A study has shown that in patients with healed ASA-induced ulcers, however, patients receiving ASA plus the proton pump inhibitor esomeprazole had a lower incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding than patients receiving clopidogrel. However, a more recent study suggested that prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors along with clopidogrel following acute coronary syndrome may increase adverse cardiac outcomes, possibly due to inhibition of CYP2C19, which is required for the conversion of clopidogrel to its active form. The European Medicines Agency has issued a public statement on a possible interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors. However, several cardiologists have voiced concern that the studies on which these warnings are based have many limitations and that it is not certain whether there really is an interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors. Clopidogrel is marketed as clopidogrel bisulfate (clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate), most commonly under the trade names Plavix, as 75 mg and 300 mg oral tablets. After repeated 75 mg oral doses of clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting effect, are very low and are generally below the quantification limit (0.258 µg/L) beyond two hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is a pro-drug activated in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2C19. Due to opening of the thiophene ring, the chemical structure of the active has three sites that are stereochemically relevant, making a total of eight possible isomers. These are: a stereocentre at C4 (attached to the —SH thiol group), a double bond at C3—C16, and the original stereocentre at C7. Only one of the eight structures is an active antiplatelet drug. This has the following configuration: Z configuration at the C3—C16 double bond, the original S configuration at C7, and although the stereocentre at C4 can't be directly determined, as the thiol group is too reactive, work with the active metabolite of the related drug prasugrel suggests that R-configuration of the C4 group is critical for P2Y12 and platelet-inhibitory activity. The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about eight hours and acts by forming a disulfide bridge with the platelet ADP receptor. Patients with a variant allele of CYP2C19 are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die or have complications than patients with the high-functioning allele. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% was excreted in the urine and approximately 46% in the feces in the five days after dosing. Effect of food: Administration of clopidogrel bisulfate with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite. Absorption and distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (approx. 3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately one hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of clopidogrel. Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 110 μg/mL. Metabolism and elimination: In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed. In March 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning to Plavix alerting that the drug can be less effective in people who cannot metabolize the drug to convert it to its active form. CYP2C19 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransformation of many clinically useful drugs including antidepressants, barbiturates, proton pump inhibitors, antimalarial and antitumor drugs. Clopidogrel is one of the drugs metabolized by this enzyme. Several recent landmark studies have proven the importance of 2C19 genotyping in treatment using clopidogrel or Plavix. In March 2010, the FDA put a black box warning on Plavix to make patients and healthcare providers aware that CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, representing up to 14% of patients, are at high risk of treatment failure and that testing is available. Researchers have found that patients with variants in cytochrome P-450 2C19 (CYP2C19) have lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, less inhibition of platelets, and a 3.58 times greater risk for major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, and stroke; the risk was greatest in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. Serious adverse drug reactions associated with clopidogrel therapy include: Clopidogrel interacts with the following drugs: proton pump inhibitors (except possibly pantoprazole), phenytoin (Dilantin); tamoxifen (Nolvadex); tolbutamide (Orinase); torsemide (Demadex); fluvastatin (Lescol); a blood thinner such as warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, ardeparin (Normiflo), dalteparin (Fragmin), danaparoid (Orgaran), enoxaparin (Lovenox), or tinzaparin (Innohep); (Activase), anistreplase (Eminase), dipyridamole (Persantine), streptokinase (Kabikinase, Streptase), ticlopidine (Ticlid), and urokinase (Abbokinase). In November 2009, the FDA announced that clopidogrel should be used with caution in patients on proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and esomeprazole. Plavix is marketed worldwide in nearly 110 countries, with sales of US$6.6 billion in 2009. It had been the second top-selling drug in the world for a few years as of 2007 and was still growing by over 20% in 2007. U.S. sales were US$3.8 billion in 2008. In 2006, generic clopidogrel was briefly marketed by Apotex, a Canadian generic pharmaceutical company before a court order halted further production until resolution of a patent infringement case brought by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The court ruled that Bristol-Myers Squibb's patent was valid and provided protection until November 2011. The FDA extended the patent protection of clopidogrel by six months, giving exclusivity that would expire on May 17, 2012. The FDA approved generic versions of Plavix on May 17, 2012. In June 2009, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) gave authorisation to six generic versions of clopidogrel bisulfate and the drug is now available in several European countries, including the United Kingdom. Generic clopidogrel is produced by several pharmaceutical companies in India and elsewhere, and often sold under its INN clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is marketed by Cipla under the trade name Clopivas, by Sun Pharmaceuticals as Clopilet, by Ranbaxy Laboratories as Ceruvin, under the name "Clavix" by Intas Pharmaceuticals and under the name "Deplatt" by Torrent Pharmaceuticals. In India, it is sold as Clopivas AP, by Cipla, Clopigrel A, by USV, Clopitab A, by Lupin by Lupin(mixed with aspirin). Generic clopidogrel is produced in Slovenia (European Union) under the trade names Zyllt, Kardogrel and Clopidogrel Krka by Krka d.d., Novo Mesto.
