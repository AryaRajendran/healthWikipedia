 Hirsuties coronae glandis (also known as "hirsutoid papillomas" and "pearly penile papules") are small saliences that may form on the ridge of the glans of the human penis. They are a harmless anatomical variation. The papules appear as one or several rows of small, pearly or flesh-colored, smooth, dome-topped bumps situated circumferentially around the corona or sulcus of the glans. They may range in size from less than 1 mm to 3 mm. The condition is common and estimated to be present in a quarter of adult men. The bumps are not transmitted through sexual activity and are not a sexually transmitted infection. Studies suggest they are found more often on younger men and those who have not been circumcised. Hirsuties coronae glandis are sometimes described as vestigial remnants of penile spines, sensitive features found in the same location in other primates. However, penile spines in chimps and mice are small surface projections made by piling up of keratinized cell layers in the outer most skin surface. In contrast, the common structures found in humans are substantially larger, appear to be an outpocketing of both surface and underlying connective tissue layers, and lack the rich innervation seen in other animals. Thus the relationship between the structures is still uncertain. In the primate line from which humans have evolved, a regulatory DNA sequence associated with the formation of small keratinized penile spines was lost. This particular DNA sequence is missing in all humans tested, so cannot explain why some human males form penile papules and some do not. In species which retain the full expression of penile spines, penile spines contribute to sexual pleasure and quicker orgasms. A similar expression, vestibular papillomatosis of the vulva or Hirsuties papillaris vulvae, occurs in females and similarly can be misinterpreted as an outbreak of the HPV infection. Like hirsuties papillaris genitalis, it is a normal variation on human anatomy. While hirsuties papillaris genitalis pose no risk to a male's health or sex life, some men or their sexual partners may consider them aesthetically displeasing. There are several medical ways to remove them. Like any elective medical procedure, there is always some risk of unexpected consequences, so doctors advise against their removal unless they are causing a patient serious problems. One of the available treatments is performed by a dermatologist, using a CO2 laser to vaporise the papules. This normally takes only a few minutes to perform. It is simple and does not normally require a hospital stay; discomfort should be minimal and the expected recovery time is limited to a few days. Another procedure involves electrosurgery performed with a hyfrecator and should take less than an hour to perform. Both procedures should be out-patient procedures if no complications arise. Although it is not related to any pathological condition, hirsuties papillaris genitalis is occasionally mistaken for HPV warts. Home remedies abound for "curing" it. Some of the "home remedies" found on the Internet and elsewhere use mild ointments or creams to soften the papules, but others are physically dangerous techniques for papule removal which can result in permanent genital mutilation. Rapini et al. advise that, since dermatologists have safe, effective ways to remove them if desired, home remedies involving corrosive substances or self-surgery should be avoided, since they can permanently damage sexual functioning. They further state that removal should only be performed by a physician using proven medical techniques.
