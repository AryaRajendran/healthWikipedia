 A low residue diet is a diet designed to reduce the frequency and volume of stools while prolonging intestinal transit time. It is similar to a low-fiber diet, but typically includes restrictions on foods that increase bowel activity, such as milk, milk products, and prune juice. A low residue diet typically contains less than 7–10 grams of fiber per day. Long term use of this diet, with its emphasis on processed foods and reduced intake of fruits and vegetables, may not provide required amounts of nutrients including potassium, vitamin C, calcium, and folic acid. New evidence tends to run counter to the well-established myth that a low residue diet is beneficial. A Mayo Clinic review from 2011 finds no evidence for the superiority of low residue diets in treating diverticular disease and in fact tends to show that a high-fiber diet can prevent diverticular disease. A systematic review published in 2012 found no high quality studies, but found that some studies and guidelines favor a high-fiber diet for the treatment of symptomatic disease.
