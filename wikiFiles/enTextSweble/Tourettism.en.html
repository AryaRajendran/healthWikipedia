 Tourettism refers to the presence of Tourette-like symptoms in the absence of Tourette syndrome, as the result of other diseases or conditions, known as "secondary causes". Tourette syndrome (TS) is an inherited neurological condition of multiple motor and at least one vocal tic. Although Tourette syndrome is the most common cause of tic disorders, other sporadic, genetic, and neurodegenerative disorders may also exhibit tics. Erer S, Jankovic J.
