 In human anatomy, the subtalar joint, also known as the talocalcaneal joint, is a joint of the foot. It occurs at the meeting point of the talus and the calcaneus. The joint allows inversion and eversion of the foot, but plays no role in dorsiflexion or plantarflexion of the foot. It is considered a plane synovial joint, also commonly referred to as a condyloid joint. The subtalar joint can also be considered a combination of the anatomic subtalar joint discussed above, and also the talocalcaneal part of the talocalcaneonavicular joint. This is the more common view of the subtalar joint when discussing its movement. When both of these articulations are accounted together, it allows for pronation and supination to occur. The talus is oriented slightly obliquely on the anterior surface of the calcaneus. There are two points of articulation between the two bones: one anteriorly and one posteriorly: The subtalar joint contributes to 10% of dorsiflexion of the ankle. The main ligament of the joint is the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament, a thick, strong band of two partially joined fibers that bind the talus and calcaneus. It runs through the sinus tarsi, a canal between the articulations of the two bones. There are four additional ligaments that form weaker connections between the talus and calcaneus. A synovial membrane lines the capsule of the joint, and the joint is wrapped in a capsule of short fibers that are continuous with the talocalconeonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints of the foot.
