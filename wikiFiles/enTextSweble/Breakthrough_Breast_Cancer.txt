 Breakthrough Breast Cancer is a United Kingdom charity dedicated to saving lives by finding the causes of breast cancer, improving detection, diagnosis, treatment and services. The Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, at the Institute of Cancer Research, is the result of more than ten years' work by Breakthrough Breast Cancer and its supporters. Breakthrough was the vision of Bill Freedman and his children. Freedman's wife, actress Toby Robins (1931–1986), died from breast cancer in 1986. With Professor Barry Gusterson of the Institute of Cancer Research, Freedman realized that a new approach was needed to tackle this disease. Their vision was of a centre of excellence for breast cancer research, with experts working under one roof on a coordinated programme of research. Breakthrough Breast Cancer was founded to make this a reality. In addition to the Breakthrough Research Centre, Breakthrough has campaigned for better breast cancer services. In November 2003, Breakthrough's Campaigns & Advocacy Network 1 was formed when the UK Breast Cancer Coalition (UKBCC) merged with Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Breakthrough works in partnership with other cancer research organisations and is a member of the National Cancer Research Institute. The Breakthrough Generations Survey aims to survey 100,000 women and "plans to be the largest, most comprehensive scientific study into the causes of breast cancer" It is being carried out in association with the Institute of Cancer Research. Women taking part are asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire about a wide range of health and lifestyle topics, and to have a blood sample taken, and will be followed up by investigators over the next 50 years. Breakthrough Breast Cancer offers many fundraising campaigns throughout the year, including Fashion Targets Breast Cancer, £1,000 Challenge, Go Pink, running events, treks and more. M & S has sold a wide range of charitable women's clothes for Breakthrough Breast Cancer for many years, and Avon have supported the charity for over 20 years with a range of fundraising products and campaigns. Breakthrough Breast Cancer's TLC (Touch, Look, Check) breast cancer awareness campaign 2 encourages women to be aware of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer. Breakthrough Breast Cancer launched 'iBreastCheck' 3 as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in 2010. iBreastCheck is a mobile app that is an extension of the TLC campaign (see above), incorporating a TLC video, slideshow and reminder service, personalised breast cancer risk report, and information on Breakthrough's activities and how to get involved. Initially available for iPhones, an Android version was released in 2012.
