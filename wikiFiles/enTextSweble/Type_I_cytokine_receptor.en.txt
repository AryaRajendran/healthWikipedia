 Type I cytokine receptors are transmembrane receptors expressed on the surface of cells that recognize and respond to cytokines with four Î±-helical strands. These receptors are also known under the name hemopoietin receptors, and share a common amino acid motif (WSXWS) in the extracellular portion adjacent to the cell membrane. Members of the type I cytokine receptor family comprise different chains, some of which are involved in ligand/cytokine interaction and others that are involved in signal transduction. The signal transducing chains are often shared between different receptors within this receptor family. Type I cytokine receptors include interleukin receptors, colony stimulating factor receptors and other cytokine receptors
