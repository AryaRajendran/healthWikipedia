 The National Osteoporosis Society, established in 1986, is the only UK-wide charity dedicated to improving the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. It is based in Camerton, Somerset, England. The income of the charity was about £3.5 million in 2010. Three million Britons are affected by osteoporosis. HRH Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is the president of the charity, which in June 2011 celebrated its 25th anniversary. A public kiss, at a charity reception, between Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, was seen as a step on the road to public acceptance of their relationship. The patrons include actress Susan Hampshire and journalist Maggie Philbin. The charity, in 1999, reported an increase in incidence of osteoporosis among young women, particularly those who are underweight or who have suffered anorexia. However, in 2000, research by the charity showed that moderate consumption of alcohol can help to reduce bone loss at the hip. In 2008 the charity, in conjunction with the Order of Mark Master Masons, awarded around £2.6 million to 14 NHS trusts to improve osteoporosis services and access to DXA scanners.
