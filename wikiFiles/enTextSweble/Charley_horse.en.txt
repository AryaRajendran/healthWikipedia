 A charley horse is a popular North American colloquial term for painful spasms or cramps in the leg muscles, typically lasting anywhere from a few seconds to about a day. It can also refer to a bruise on an arm or leg and a bruising of the quadriceps muscle of the anterior or lateral thigh, or contusion of the femur, that commonly results in a hematoma and sometimes several weeks of pain and disability. Such an injury is known in the United Kingdom, United States, and many Commonwealth countries as a dead leg, gunt, or chopper. In Australia it is also known as a corked thigh or "corky." It often occurs in contact sports, such as football when an athlete suffers a knee (blunt trauma) to the lateral quadriceps causing a hematoma or temporary paresis and antalgic gait as a result of pain. Another nuance for the term "charley horse" is used to describe simple painful muscle cramps in the leg or foot, especially those that follow strenuous exercise. These muscle cramps can have many possible causes directly resulting from high or low pH or substrate concentrations in the blood, including hormonal imbalances, low levels of potassium or calcium, side effects of medication, or, more seriously, diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and neuropathy. They are also a common complaint during pregnancy. Relief is usually given by either massaging or stretching the foot, ankle or knee in the opposite direction of the spasm. Colloquial advice suggests that dietary deficiency of potassium, found richly in bananas and many vegetables, is a common cause of these spasms. The term may date back to American slang of the 1880s, possibly from the pitcher Charlie "Old Hoss" Radbourn who is said to have suffered from cramps. In Norway, it is referred to as a lårhøne (thigh hen), in Sweden lårkaka (thigh cookie), and in France as a crampe (cramp) or claquage (if the muscle is torn). In Portugal, it is known as a paralítica, roughly translated to "paralyzer". In Brazil it has become known as "tostão" or "paulistinha". In Japan it is known as , which is literally "cramp in the calf". In northeastern Italy, it is commonly called a lopez, while in the northwest it is called vecchia (old woman) or dura ("hard one" or "tough one"); in the south of the country, instead, it is called morso del ciuccio (donkey's bite). In some areas of central Italy, it is called water buffalo. In Israel it is called Regel Etz which means wooden leg. It is called chaca (rat) in the Chamorro language of Guam and the Mariana Islands. .
