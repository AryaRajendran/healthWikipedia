 Polymyxin B is an antibiotic primarily used for resistant Gram-negative infections. It is derived from the bacterium Bacillus polymyxa. Polymyxin B is a mixture of two closely related compounds, polymyxin B1 and polymyxin B2. It has a bactericidal action against almost all Gram-negative bacilli except the Proteus group. Polymyxins bind to the cell membrane and alter its structure, making it more permeable. The resulting water uptake leads to cell death. Polymyxins are cationic, basic proteins that act like detergents (surfactants). Side effects include neurotoxicity and acute renal tubular necrosis. Polymyxins are used in the topical first-aid preparation Neosporin. In addition to its antibiotic function, polymyxin B has been used to clear endotoxin contamination in reagents.
