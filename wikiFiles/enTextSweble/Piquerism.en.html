 Piquerism or picquerism (from the French piquer - "to prick") is sexual interest in penetrating the skin of another person, sometimes serious enough to cause death. Piquerism is a paraphilia and form of sadism. The most frequently targeted areas of the body are the breasts, buttocks, or groin. It is usually found only in older offenders who have a history of violence and sexual offending. This, coupled with possible cigarette burns, suggests an older offender who smokes. Andrei Chikatilo was impotent and could only get sexual arousal through stabbing and cutting people with a knife. Dr. Robert D. Keppel and his colleagues concluded in an analysis of London's Jack the Ripper murders of 1888 that "the injuries sustained by the victims displayed the signature characteristic of picquerism." Notorious serial killer Albert Fish has been said to have engaged in piquerism upon his victims and his own body, flagellating himself constantly with a nail-studded board. After his arrest and subsequent jailing for the murder of Grace Budd, an X-Ray revealed at least 29 needles that were inserted into his groin. However, this is actually a condition called infibulation. Infibulation is the purposeful use of sharp objects such as pins, needles, and piercings, in the genital area for sexual pleasure and pain.
