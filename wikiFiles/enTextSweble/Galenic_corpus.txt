 The Galenic corpus is the collection of writings of the ancient physician Galen. Galen produced more work than any author in antiquity, and may have possibly written up to 600 treatises, although less than a third of his works have survived. His surviving work runs to around 3 million words. Karl Gottlob Kühn of Leipzig (1754-1840) translated 122 of Galen's writings (1821–1833) and his edition, which is the most complete although flawed, consists of the Greek text, with Latin translations, and runs to 22 volumes, 676 index pages, and is over 20,000 pages in length. More modern projects like the Corpus Medicorum Graecorum have still to match the Kühn edition. A digital version of the Galen's corpus is included in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae a digital library of Greek literature started in 1972. Another useful modern source is the French Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de santé (BIU Santé).
