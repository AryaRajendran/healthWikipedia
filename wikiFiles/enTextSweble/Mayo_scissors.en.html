 Mayo scissors are a type of surgical scissor, often used in the cutting of fascia. Mayo scissors were developed by Mayo Clinic surgeons. Mayo scissors may be made from stainless steel or titanium, with stainless steel ones being markedly cheaper than titanium ones. They may also be available in standard or extra-long scissors, and typically measure between 6 inches (150 mm) and 6 ¾ inches (170 mm) in length. Like most other modern-day surgical instruments, a vast majority of Mayo scissors are made from stainless steel and are disposable due to convenience, as such scissors do not need to be sterilised and reprocessed. Straight- and curved-blade varieties of Mayo scissors exist, each of which is particularly suited to specific surgical, including veterinary and podiatric surgery applications, applications.
