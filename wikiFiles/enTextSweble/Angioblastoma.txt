 Splinter is the seventh album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 2003. It was the first album the band released without drummer Ron Welty and even though many of their previous albums contain explicit langugage, it was the first to have a Parental Advisory. While the album was not as successful as The Offspring's albums between Smash and Conspiracy of One, Splinter received gold certification two months after its release. The album received average reviews, but still sold reasonably well, even though a third U.S. single was never released. It debuted at 30 on the US Billboard 200 with around 87,000 copies sold in its first week, and has sold more than 1.8 million copies worldwide.
