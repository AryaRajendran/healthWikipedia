 The Lillian Booth Actors Home of The Actors Fund is an American assisted-living facility, in Englewood, New Jersey. It is operated by the Actors Fund, a nonprofit umbrella charitable organization that assists American entertainment and performing arts professionals. In 2003, it was renamed in honor of Lillian Booth, a philanthropist who donated $2 million to the facility. On May 8, 1902, the Actors Fund opened a home for retired entertainers on Staten Island, a borough of New York City, New York. In 1928, the New York City government took the property using eminent domain to enlarge an adjacent city park. That year, the residents were moved to the former mansion of American businesswoman Hetty Green in Englewood. The mansion was razed in 1959, and a modern facility was erected in 1961. In 1975, the facility was merged with the Percy Williams Home on Long Island, New York. The facilities were expanded in 1988 with a 50-bed nursing home. In the same year, the Edwin Forrest wing was created at the nursing home after a merger with the Edwin Forrest Home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1993, a wing was named in honor of actress Natalie Schafer, notable for her role as Eunice "Lovey" Wentworth Howell on the television sitcom Gilligan's Island (1964–1967), who left $1.5 million to the Actors Fund after her death. (year of birth–year of death) The facility was the subject of the short documentary film Curtain Call (2008), directed by Charles Braverman; the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).
