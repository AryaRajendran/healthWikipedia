 The hypochondrium is the upper part of the abdomen dorsal to the lowest ribs of the thorax. The word derives from : hupochondros, meaning abdomen, or literally under cartilage. The liver is found in the right hypochondrium. Some sources have disputed usage of the term to the parts of the anterior abdominal wall below the costal margins. The region named the right hypochondrium exists anatomically, but is almost totally under the chest wall. In clinical situations, the part of the abdominal wall just below the right and left costal margins are referred to as the right and left hypochondriac regions respectively. Clinically speaking, symptoms and signs arising from this region are of great importance and have a specific list of diseases in their differential diagnoses.
