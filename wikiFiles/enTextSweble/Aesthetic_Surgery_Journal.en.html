 Aesthetic Surgery Journal is a peer-reviewed medical journal that covers the field of plastic surgery. The journal's editor-in-chief is Foad Nahai (Emory University School of Medicine). It was established in 1996 as Aesthetic Surgery Quarterly and is currently published by SAGE Publications on behalf of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS). Aesthetic Surgery Journal is the official journal of plastic and aesthetic surgery organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, Thailand, and Turkey. In North America, besides ASAPS, it is also an official publication of the Canadian Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and The Rhinoplasty Society. Aesthetic Surgery Journal evolved from an earlier publication that focused primarily on association news for the plastic surgeon membership of ASAPS and gradually grew to incorporate articles of clinical interest in aesthetic surgery. From 1988 through 1994, this newsletter was published three times per year and called Aesthetic Surgery. Beginning in 1995, with an additional issue per year, the name was changed to Aesthetic Surgery Quarterly. It was not until 1996, when ASAPS entered into a publishing agreement with Mosby, that a significant portion of this periodical was designated as the "Clinical Journal" devoted to peer-reviewed original articles. Beginning in January 1997, publication was increased to six issues per year, and the name was changed to Aesthetic Surgery Journal.
