 DBH-like monooxygenase protein 1, also known as monooxygenase X, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MOXD1 gene. DBH-like 1 maintains many of the structural features of dopamine beta-monooxygenase DBH. Since Peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM; EC 1.14.17.3) is homologous to dopamine beta-monooxygenase (DBM; EC 1.14.17.1) this concerns a structural basis for a new family of copper type II, significantly specific for ascorbate-dependent monooxygenases based on the corresponding mouse homolog. The pathway of catecholamine synthesis is a possible catecholamine-binding metabolic copper enzyme domain, a neuron-like property encoding MOX without a signal sequence enzyme metabolism resolving the monooxygenase X chemical pathway of an unknown substrate, exogenous MOX is not secreted, and it localizes throughout the endoplasmic reticulum, in both endocrine or nonendocrine cells. DBH deficiency has been treated effectively with L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS).
