 The Migraine Aura Foundation (MAF) is a non-profit organization based in Germany. MAF runs a website providing access to medical information and material that helps migraine patients to recognize and understand their neurological symptoms during migraine, and thus to assume greater responsibility for their healthcare. In 2000, the German national daily newspaper Die Welt published an article about the work of the theoretical physicist Markus Dahlem on the emergence of visual hallucinations during migraine. In the following days and weeks, the scientist received numerous letters asking for more information and many people were willing to provide additional information on their migraine symptoms. The obvious need for a wider public understanding of these visual hallucinations and further peculiar neurological symptoms suggested that a website devoted exclusively to migraine with aura would have a strong impact. It went online in 2000. This website was until 2004 available only in German. In 2004, the physician Klaus Podoll, an expert in migraine art, joined the project. The content presented on the website increased dramatically in the years 2004-2005. From 2004 on, it was published in a German and English version. In 2005, the website was nominated for the Media Art Award, an international competition jointly organized by SÃ¼dwestrundfunk (South West German Broadcasting Corporation) and others. At the same time, due to the vast increase in content, the website could no longer be provided in two languages. Today, information on the website is available only in English. It provides the largest source available to the public on migraine with aura.
