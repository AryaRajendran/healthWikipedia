 The World Health Summit is a gathering of leaders from academia, science, politics and industry as well as stakeholders of the private sector and civil society. The summit was initiated on the occasion of the 300th year anniversary of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, under the patronage of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy. It is now held annually in Berlin. The meeting is presided over by Prof. Detlev Ganten, a medical research scientist and Chairman of the Board of the Charité foundation. It is organized by the M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers and Medical Universities together with the National Academies, the EU and WHO. President Francois Hollande continues the tradition of co-patronage by the French head of state. According to the World Health Summit's Mission Statement, published in The Lancet in 2009, the conference's mission is in keeping with the UN Declaration of Human Rights' (1948) acknowledgement of health as a fundamental human right. Since at present more than half of the world's population is not receiving proper medical care, the organizers of the World Health Summit see their mission in the improvement of healthcare worldwide and the achievement of equitable access to medication and prevention. This mission is seen as threatened by unsolved and newly emerging problems such as: "The demographic shift to an ageing society; climate change and its health consequences that are already being felt; new types of epidemics, such as obesity, mental ill-health, and violence and injury, in developed and developing countries, in addition to the still raging epidemics of HIV, TB, and malaria; the rising costs of health care; and the worldwide economic crisis and its serious threats to the health of populations across the globe." Thus, the conference initiators intend to address these challenges by bringing together stakeholders from research, education, clinical care and many other disciplines to jointly develop strategies to tackle these issues. The outcome of this multi-sectoral summit is intended to serve decision-makers and governments as recommendations for future healthcare challenges. Each year the World Health Summit is being held under a different motto and focuses on different key topics. These are formulated by members of the M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers and Medical Universities and also by the eminent academicians, researchers and clinicians who form the World Health Summit Council. The first World Health Summit under the motto "The Evolution of Medicine" took place 14–18 October 2009 at the Charité University, Berlin. 700 participants worked on concrete recommendations for dealing with pandemic planning, effective prevention strategies and climate change-related diseases. Prof. Dr. Axel Kahn from the Université Paris Descartes, France, held the co-presidency of the first World Health Summit. In 2010, the World Health Summit was held 10–13 October in Berlin. The conference focused on the key topics: Translation – Transition – Transformation. In keeping with these topics, solutions facilitating the translation of medical knowledge into interventions that benefit patients across the globe, the new health challenges in a world of constant transition and the transformation of health politics and management to respond to these challenges were discussed. The co-president of the meeting was Prof. Dr. Stephen K. Smith, Principal of the Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London. The third World Health Summit took place 23–26 October 2011 under the motto "Today's Science – Tomorrows Agenda". Prof. Dr. Steve Wesselingh from Monash University, Melbourne, Australia officially held the co-presidency for the year preceding the third Summit with Prof. Dr. Christina Mitchell deputising as Co-President at the Summit itself in Prof. Dr. Wesselingh's absence. Professor Michael Klag, Dean of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University of the United States was Co-President of the fourth World Health Summit held in Berlin 20–24 October 2012. Professor John Wong of the National University of Singapore is the Co-President for the fifth World Health Summit in 2013, and also for the satellite Asia-Pacific conference of the World Health Summit to be held in Singapore in April 2013. The University of Sao Paulo will exercise the World Health Summit co-presidency in 2014. Traditionally the co-presidency institution hosts the annual M8 Alliance planning meeting in its own home city in March preceding the Summit in October of that year. The World Health Summit has been criticized by Thomas Gebauer, director of medico international, as an "elitist club of decision makers", that ignores both the social factor of global health issues and the notion of health as a human right, but rather serves particular interests. Thus, in 2009, the Frankfurt-based organization medico international intitiated an alternative conference as a form of protest against the World Health Summit. Despite all the criticism of the summit, and in particular of its sponsors - the pharma industry - both sides, the critics and the initiators of the World Health Summit, showed a readiness to engage in a constructive discussion. Professor Dr med Detlev Ganten, the permanent Co-President of the World Health Summit invited the participants of the 2009 alternative conference to attend the World Health Summit 2010 and, thus, to enter into a dialogue. The M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers and Medical Universities is an academic network of institutions of education and research, including national academies where these exist. It was first officially inaugurated in 2009 on occasion of the first World Health Summit. This international network provides the academic foundation to the World Health Summit. According to the 'M8 Alliance Profile', the network seeks to improve global health and works with political and economic decision makers and civil society to develop science-based solutions for health challenges worldwide. It was created as a permanent platform for framing future considerations of global medical developments and health challenges. The M8 Alliance consists of thirteen member sfrom five continents:. After the second World Health Summit in 2010, the University of Sao Paulo and the National University of Singapore joined the network, with the University of Montreal being welcomed into the group in 2012. The M8 Alliance secretariat is based at the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin at the Mitte campus. English is the operating language of the group and the World Health Summit.
