 Health care quality refers to a level of value of any health care resources as determined by some a measurement. The goal of health care is to provide medical resources of high quality to all who need them. Researchers use many different measures to attempt to determine health care quality, including counts of a therapy's reduction or lessening of diseases identified by medical diagnosis, a decrease in the number of risk factors which people have following preventative care, or a survey of health indicators in a population who are accessing certain kinds of care. The modern field of determining health care quality began in about 1970 and became a much greater topic of interest by the mid 1990s. Some areas for development which have been proposed to improve the accuracy and research of measures of health care quality are the following: Researchers measure health care quality to identify problems caused by over use, under use, or misuse of health resources. A study in the United States found that quality problems existed with equal frequency in both large and small communities. Organizations which work to set standards and measures for health care quality include Government health systems; accreditation programs such as those for hospital accreditation, health associations, or those who wish to establish international healthcare accreditation; philanthropic foundations; and health research institutions. These organizations seek to define the concept of quality in healthcare, measure that quality, and then encourage the regular measurement of quality so as to provide evidence that health interventions are effective.
