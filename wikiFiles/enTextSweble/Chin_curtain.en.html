 The chin curtain beard (also called a Donegal or Lincoln) is a particular style of facial hair that grows along the jaw line and covers the chin completely. This is not to be confused with the chinstrap beard—a similar style of beard that also grows along the jaw line but does not fully cover the chin. In addition, many chin curtain beards do not extend that far below the jawline, if at all, whereas all chinstrap beards generally do. This style of facial hair was made famous by individuals such as Abraham Lincoln. In Spain, it could be largely associated with 1970s progres and other cultural icons, such as writer Álvaro Pombo.
