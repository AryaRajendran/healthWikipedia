 The prozone phenomenon is defined as a falsely negative (=incorrectly normal) test due to very high titers (concentration) of antibody. Many laboratory tests rely on antigen-antibody interactions. The prozone phenomenon is said to be present when dilution of a previously negative sample leads to a positive test. High levels of antigen or antibody may prevent the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. Examples include high levels of syphilis antibodies in HIV patients or high levels of cryptococcal antigen leading to false negative tests in undiluted samples. This phenomenon is also seen in serological tests for Brucellosis. The serological test is mainly seen in the precipitation reaction.The antibody that fails to react is known as the blocking antibody which does not allow the precipitating antibody to bind to the antigens for proper precipitation reaction to take place;but when diluting the serum,the blocking antibody are also diluted and its concentration decreased for proper precipitation reaction to occur
