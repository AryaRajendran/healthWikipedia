Part of the UC San Diego Health System, Nevada Cancer Institute offers current and advanced cancer treatment options, with patient and family support services, to residents of Nevada. The Institute provides inpatient treatment services such as chemotherapy, radiation and diagnostic imaging services, as well as an array of clinical trials, many of which would not otherwise be available in the state of Nevada. The Institute also provides assistance to help patients find the information and non-medical resources they need to support themselves during treatment - including support groups, an on-site meditation room, yoga and other activities.
