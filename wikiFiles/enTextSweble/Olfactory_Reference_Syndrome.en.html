 Olfactory Reference Syndrome (ORS) (also referred to as Autodysomophobia) is a psychiatric condition in which the affected person is excessively preoccupied by the concern that one's body odor is foul or unpleasant. This disorder is often accompanied by shame, embarrassment, significant distress, avoidance behavior, social phobia and social isolation. ORS is not currently recognised by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition), and is currently considered by many to be a sub-type of Body dysmorphic disorder. However it has been proposed as a diagnosis for addition in the yet to be finalized DSM-V. ORS links obsessive and compulsive aspects and has been treated as an Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorder with a strong anxiety component. Sufferers may have trouble concentrating at a given task or in particular situations due to obsessive thoughts concerning body odor. Common symptoms of ORS include excessive thoughts of having: People with ORS believe others' behaviors or comments are related to the imagined odor (e.g., another's cough, sneeze, or turning of the head is due to the alleged odor). ORS should not be diagnosed without thorough clinical assessment related to the perceived symptom. Something malodor conditions all have in common is that they are very poorly managed and understood by health care professionals and the public in general. e.g. a full halitological consultation by a clinician educated in the differential diagnosis of halitosis. Genital malodor, rectal malodor and body odor are also extensively complex topics. It is inappropriate to diagnose any patient with a delusional symptom without applying the most modern evidence based management guidelines for their complaint. Individuals with ORS often engage in time-consuming behaviors in an attempt to alleviate their perceived odor. Common compulsive behaviours include: Olfactory reference syndrome may be treated with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
