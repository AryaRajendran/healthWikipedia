 Francis William Rogers Brambell (25 February 1901 – 6 June 1970) was a British medical scientist. He was born in Sandycove, Dublin and was educated (1911–1914) at Aravon School and then privately, specializing in zoology. He was appointed Lloyd Roberts Professor and Head of the Department of Zoology at Bangor in 1930 at the age of 29; from that time until his retirement 38 years later he brought great and increasing distinction to his Department and College. He was the father of the field of transmission of immunity, which he entered 50 years ago. As part of his quantitative and temporal studies on transmission, he defined the first Fc receptor system for IgG, and furthermore recognized the link between transmission of passive immunity from mother to young and protection from catabolism for IgG. He wrote Antibodies and Embryos with W. A. Hemmings and M. Henderson in 1951. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March, 1949 and won their Royal Medal in 1964 "In recognition of his important contribution to our understanding of the passage of protein from maternal to foetal circulations". He died on 6 June 1970. He had married Margaret L. Adgie in 1927.
