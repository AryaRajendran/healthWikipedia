 Celadrin (cetylated fatty acids) is a proprietary blend of esterified fatty acids carbons and also the name of a topical analgesic drug that contains this cream and is used for osteoarthritis. The only active ingredient in this over-the-counter drug formulation is menthol, however celadrin is mentioned on a specific brand as functional ingredient. It is distributed by Imagenetix of San Diego, California. A human study showed that one week of treatment with a topical cream consisting of cetylated fatty acids (Celadrin) and menthol was similarly effective for reducing pain and improving functional performance in individuals with arthritis of the knee, elbow, and wrist; these data support the use of a topical cream consisting of cetylated fatty acids (with or without menthol) for enhancing the potential for exercise training in this population. Another human study concluded that compared to placebo, CFA (cetylated fatty acids; Celadrin) provides an improvement in knee range of motion and overall function in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee; thus CFA may be an alternative to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of OA. An in vitro study that investigated the effects of glucosamine (a dietary supplement used for knee osteoarthritis) and celadrin on platelet function concluded that glucosamine and celadrin may inhibit platelet aggregation in some individuals via aspirin-like effects as well as inhibition of ADP receptor P2Y1, but not P2Y12 The antiplatelet effects of cealdrin (see above) mean that theoretically celadrin may interact with blood thinners (such as aspirin, clopidogrel and warfarin), although this interaction has not been studied, and it is doubtful if this interaction occurs with the topical application of celadrin where the systemic absorbance is low.
