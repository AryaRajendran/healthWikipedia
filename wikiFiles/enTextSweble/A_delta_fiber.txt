 A joint is the place where two or more bones make contact. They allow movement (except for skull bones) and give mechanical support. Joints have cartilage in between them, which help to make the movement flexible. Joints are described structurally and functionally. Structural classification is how the bones connect to each other; function is the degree of movement between the articulating bones.
