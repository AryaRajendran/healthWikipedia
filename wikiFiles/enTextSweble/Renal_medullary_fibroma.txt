 Renal medullary fibroma, also renomedullary interstitial cell tumour and medullary fibroma, is a benign kidney tumour. It is commonly an incidental finding. Renal medullary fibromas are typically asymptomatic. Renal medullary fibromas are diagnosed by pathologists based on the examination of tissue. They consist of bland spindle-shaped or stellate-shaped cells in a loose stroma. Renal tubules may be entrapped. Generally, no treatment is required.
