 Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine (RVUCOM) is a for-profit osteopathic medical school located in Parker, Colorado. The school grants the degree Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, and admitted its inaugural class of medical students in August 2008. RVUCOM broke ground on March 23, 2007 and admitted its first class in August 2008. The most recent matriculating class of 2016 had an average MCAT score of 27.4, science GPA of 3.5 and a cumulative GPA of 3.6. RVUCOM operates a clinic which accepts Medicaid and Medicare patients to help the underserved in the Denver and Parker area. The school is fully accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, and graduated its inaugural class on May 19, 2012. RVUCOM is notable for being the first and only modern day for-profit medical school operating in the United States. As such, its opening has generated controversy. Critics have raised concerns that a for-profit school will be beholden to investors, and lack credibility. Supporters say that the school will be held to the same academic and accreditation standards as other medical schools. Rocky Vista LLC is owned by Yife Tien and his wife Lucy Chua Tien, MD, and governed by a Board of Trustees. Castle Pines Holdings LLC was established as a holding company to control the Tiens' interest in Rocky Vista LLC and provide stability in the event of Tien's death or incapacity. Parkview Medical Center in Pueblo, Colorado, has been awarded a 5-year $770,000 federal grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to train primary care internal medicine residents. Parkview has developed a new osteopathic internal medicine residency program which matriculated its first trainees in July 2012. The grant was a joint effort of Parkview Medical Center and Rocky Vista University along with Rocky Mountain OPTI. RVUCOM and Rocky Mountain OPTI are currently working to establish additional residency programs in Colorado and Wyoming.
