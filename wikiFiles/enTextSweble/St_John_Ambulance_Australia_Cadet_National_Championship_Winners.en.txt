 The St. John Ambulance Australia Cadet National Championship began in the 1960s. At the time there were 4 categories for competition; Ambulance Cadet Team, Ambulance Cadet Individual, Nursing Cadet Team and Nursing Cadet Individual. The Ambulance Cadet categories were for boys between 11 and 18 years of age and the Nursing Cadet categories were for girls of the same age. They were held on alternating years until 1985. In 1985, the championships amalgamated when the girls and boys cadet groups joined. A two new categories were added, the Cadet Leader Individual and the Champion State/Territory, and the Ambulance and the Nursing trophies were reassigned to become singular team and individual Championships. At this time, the St John National Champion badge was also introduced. Initially, it was only granted to the winners of the Cadet Team, Cadet Individual and Cadet Leader Championships, however, since 2003 it has been also granted to the winners of the Champion State/Territory, regardless of their rankings in their relevant events. Each year these competitions are held in January at the National Cadet Camp (NatCamp). In 2014, the camp and competitions will be held in New South Wales and will be an international camp with there being the National Championships but also the international competitions with countries invited to send competitors from all over the world where St John is established.
