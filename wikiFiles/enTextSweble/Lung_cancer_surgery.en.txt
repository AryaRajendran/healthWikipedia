 Lung cancer surgery describes the use of surgical operations in the treatment of lung cancer. It involves the surgical excision of cancer tissue from the lung. It is used mainly in non-small cell lung cancer with the intention of curing the patient. Not all patients are suitable for operation. The stage, location and cell type are important limiting factors. In addition, patients who are very ill with a poor performance status or who have inadequate pulmonary reserve would be unlikely to survive. Even with careful selection, the overall operative death rate is about 4.4%. "Stage" refers to the degree of spread of the cancer. See non-small cell lung cancer staging In non-small cell lung cancer, stages IA, IB, IIA, and IIB are suitable for surgical resection. Pulmonary reserve is measured by spirometry. If there is no evidence of undue shortness of breath or diffuse parenchymal lung disease, and the FEV1 exceeds 2 litres or 80% of predicted, the patient is fit for pneumonectomy. If the FEV1 exceeds 1.5 litres, the patient is fit for lobectomy.
