 In gastroenterology, a sessile serrated adenoma (abbreviated SSA), also known as sessile serrated polyp (abbreviated SSP), is a premalignant flat (or sessile) lesions of the colon, predominantly seen in the cecum and ascending colon. SSAs are thought to lead to colorectal cancer through the (alternate) serrated pathway. This differs from most colorectal cancer, which arises from mutations starting with inactivation of the APC gene. Multiple SSAs may be part of the serrated polyposis syndrome. SSAs, generally, are asymptomatic. They are typically identified on a colonoscopy, by a gastroenterologist, and excised for a definitive diagnosis and treatment. SSAs are diagnosed by their microscopic appearance; histomorphologically, they are characterized by (1) basal dilation of the crypts, (2) basal crypt serration, (3) crypts that run horizontal to the basement membrane (horizontal crypts), and (4) crypt branching. The most common of these features is basal dilation of the crypts. Unlike traditional colonic adenomas (e.g. tubular adenoma, villous adenoma), they do not (typically) have nuclear changes (nuclear hyperchromatism, nuclear crowding, elliptical/cigar-shaped nuclei). Complete removal of a SSA is considered curative. Several SSAs confer a higher risk of subsequently finding colorectal cancer and warrant more frequently screening. The screening guidelines are the same, as for other colonic adenomas. The screening interval is dependent on (1) the number of adenomas, (2) their size and, (3) whether high-grade microscopic features are present.
