 The micro-organisms that colonize the vagina, collectively referred to as the vaginal microbiota or vaginal microflora, were discovered by the German gynecologist Albert DÃ¶derlein in 1892. The amount and type of bacteria present have significant implications for a woman's overall health. The primary colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual are of the genus lactobacillus, such as L. acidophilus and L. doderlein, and the lactic acid they produce (some species produce hydrogen peroxide or antibiotic), in combination with fluids secreted during sexual arousal, are greatly responsible for the characteristic scent associated with the vaginal area. During menstruation, the concentration of vaginal microbiome is observed to decline. The effect of tampon use on vaginal flora is debated, but application of tampons appears not to significantly modify the balance of bacterial presence. A healthy vaginal microbiome aids in the prevention of bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections and other possible problems by maintaining an acidic pH (< 4.5) that is unfavourable for the growth of common pathogens, such as Gardnerella vaginalis. The lactobacilli present in a healthy vaginal microbiome also occupy the ecological niche that would otherwise be available for exploitation by pathogenic organisms. However, harmful bacteria or an imbalance in bacteria can lead to infection. One method of reducing the risk of infection in the local area of the urethra is to urinate immediately after sex. Additionally, exclusive use of sterile contraceptives can assist in prevention of infection.
