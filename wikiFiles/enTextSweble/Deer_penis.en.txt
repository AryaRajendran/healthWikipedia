 In traditional Chinese medicine, a deer penis () is said to have important therapeutic properties.

During the 2008 Summer Olympics, the country banned deer penis, turtle blood, and angelica root potions from athletes' diets.

Chinese Olympic officials advised national athletes not to take the traditional remedy because it may contain some banned substances like the stimulant herbal ephedrine. It joined steroids and amphetamines on the list of banned substances. When consumed, a deer penis or tiger penis is also said to enhance virility, and is thought by some to be an aphrodisiac.
