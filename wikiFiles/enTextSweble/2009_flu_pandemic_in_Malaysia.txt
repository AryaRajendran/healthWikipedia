 The 2009 flu outbreak in Malaysia is part of a larger flu pandemic involving a new type of influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A (H1N1)) virus. As of 11 August 2009, the country has over 2,253 cases, beginning with "imported" cases from affected countries, including the United States and Australia from May 15, 2009 onwards, and the first local transmission on June 17, 2009. From August 12, the Malaysian Health Ministry said that it had discontinue officially updating the total number of H1N1 cases within Malaysia in line with guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation. As of August 21, 2009 the unofficial number of cases reported in the media is 5,876 so far. The first death related to the A(H1N1) virus was reported on 23 July 2009 and so far there have been 78 deaths reported. On July 6, 2009 Malaysia announced that it was shifting from containment to mitigation to tackle the spread of the virus. The federal government has declared a national health emergency in Malaysia due to the A(H1N1) outbreak and is considering imposing a health curfew similar to the week-long shutdown of non-essential services and industries in Mexico. Since the Nipah virus outbreak in 1999, the Malaysian Health Ministry have put in place processes to be better prepared to protect the Malaysian population from the threat of infectious diseases. Malaysia was fully prepared during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) situation (Malaysia was not a SARS affected country) and the episode of the H5N1 (bird flu) outbreak in 2004. The Malaysian government has developed a National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan (NIPPP) which serves as a time bound guide for preparedness and response plan for influenza pandemic. It provides a policy and strategic framework for a multisectoral response and contains specific advice and actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Health at the different levels, other governmental departments and agencies and non governmental organizations to ensure that resources are mobilized and used most efficiently before, during and after a pandemic episode. According to the Malaysian Ministry of Health, headed by Liow Tiong Lai, health screenings were carried out on passengers traveling to and from Mexico via sea, air and land beginning April 17, 2009. The Health Ministry's disease control division has activated its operations room to monitor the swine flu situation and informed medical practitioners who are treating cases with symptoms of influenza-like illness or severe pneumonia and persons who had visited Mexico, California or Texas to inform the district health office immediately for preventive and control measures. As has several Asian countries, thermal scanners had been installed at entry points at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) following the start of the global alert on the flu. Screenings were imposed in Pengkalan Hulu, at the border with Thailand, in late April. Quarantine rooms had been allocated in 28 hospitals, and the country has stockpiled more than 2 million doses of Tamiflu, as of May 2009. The Malaysian Health Ministry has warned Malaysians not to withhold health information to the authorities saying that those doing so could be fined RM10,000 or jailed two years or both if they are found guilty under the Disease Prevention Act 1988. On June 18, 2009 Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin declared that all visitors and Malaysians returning from abroad will be required to fill the health declaration form following the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic around the world. On August 17, The Government said that will consider declaring a health curfew if the mortality rate of Influenza A(H1N1) is above 0.4% from the current 0.1%-0.3%. Health Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said that they'are currently treating the flu as a "health emergency". Health Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai urged the public to wear a mask if showing symptoms of the flu. In response to the country's first case of A (H1N1), the health ministry urged calm among the populace "as the situation is under control" and "the ministry has taken all the possible precautionary measures to control and contain the disease after the WHO issued a level-five alert." In addition, schools were issued strict hygiene procedures on May 16 to contain any H1N1 outbreak among students and teachers. Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Assunta 1 in Petaling Jaya became the fourth school to be closed in a week. The country had reported no suspected cases before May 4, 2009, but all cases tested negative between May 4 and May 15. On May 15, the Health Ministry confirmed Malaysia's first case of A (H1N1) infection of a 21 year-old male student who had arrived at the KLIA on May 13 via a Malaysia Airlines flight (MH091) from Newark and on transit at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, followed by a second case on May 16 of a female student in Johor who shared the same flight as the first patient and boarded an AirAsia flight (AK5358) from KLIA to Penang International Airport.

The first patient has been warded at the Sungai Buloh Hospital, while house quarantines were undertaken on two of the second patient's friends who boarded the same flight, along with their family members. All passengers of the flights were also asked to contact the Health Ministry or head to any hospital, clinic or health office or further action, and crew members of MH091 and AK5358 were located and grounded. As the first patient has indicated, the use of thermal scanners is revealed not to be entirely effective as symptoms of his flu had yet to manifest; the Health Ministry resumes the use of the scanners nevertheless. On June 4, three additional inbound airline passengers were reported to be carrying the virus.
