 Chromosome 19 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 19 spans more than 63 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 2 and 2.5 percent of the total DNA in cells. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 19 likely contains between 1,300 and 1,700 genes. The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 19: The following diseases are some of those related to genes on chromosome 19:
