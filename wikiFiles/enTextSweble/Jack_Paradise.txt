 Jack L. Paradise is a professor emeritus of pediatrics at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and a leading researcher of the placement of tympanostomy tubes in children with persistent otitis media. Paradise asserts that the common fear of developmental problems caused by persistent ear infections in children are unfounded. According to Paradise's research, for children up to 3 years old, "ear disease does not cause any developmental problems." The research asserts that if the insertion of tympanostomy tubes into a child's ear is delayed, there is "no effect on a child's performance on language tests and speech tests." In otherwise healthy children ages 9 to 11 who have persistent middle-ear effusion, a study led by Paradise concluded that "prompt insertion of tympanostomy tubes does not improve developmental outcomes." According to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Paradise's studies have helped to promote the use of strict criteria for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. The 78% decline in pediatric tonsillectomies in the United States between 1971 and 1996 has also been largely attributed to his work.
