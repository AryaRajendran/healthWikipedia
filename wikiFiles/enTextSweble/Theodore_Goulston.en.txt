He entered Merton College, Oxford, was elected a fellow in 1596, and graduated M.A. 8 July 1600, and M.D. 30 April 1610.

These lectures were annually delivered from 1639, and have continued for more than three centuries. In 1619 he published in London Versio Latina et Paraphrasis in Aristotelis Rhetoricam, with a dedication to Prince Charles in Latin prose, and his notes and Latin version were reprinted in the edition of the Greek text published at Cambridge in 1696.
