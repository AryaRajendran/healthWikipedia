 Cerebral ventriculography is a medical procedure developed by Walter Dandy, and designed to enable visualization of structures inside the skull. In this procedure, holes are drilled in the skull, and air pumped through the holes in to the ventricles, to facilitate clearer imaging on X-rays. It has been replaced by more effective and less invasive imaging techniques.
