 The NHS number is a unique number used by the National Health Service in England, Wales and the Isle of Man to identify patients. Scotland's equivalent is called a CHI number. The NHS number was introduced in 1996 replacing a previous system. It is a ten digit number in a 3-3-4 format with the final digit being a check digit. Examples given are 943-476-5919 and 943-476-5870. Currently issued numbers are in two ranges from 400-000-000 to 499-999-999 and 600-000-000 to 708-800-001. A person gets an NHS number at birth, or when they first make contact with the NHS by registering with a GP. It comes from a record being made on the Personal Demographics Service, a national patient database.
