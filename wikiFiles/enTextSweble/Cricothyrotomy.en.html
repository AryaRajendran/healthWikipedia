 A cricothyrotomy (also called thyrocricotomy, cricothyroidotomy, inferior laryngotomy, intercricothyrotomy, coniotomy or emergency airway puncture) is an incision made through the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. Cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed as a last resort in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine, and is associated with fewer complications. However, while cricothyrotomy may be life-saving in extreme circumstances, this technique is only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established. The procedure was first described in 1805 by Vicq d'Azyr, a French surgeon and anatomist. A cricothyrotomy is generally performed by making a vertical incision on the skin of the neck just below the "Adam's apple", or thyroid cartilage, then making another transverse incision in the cricothyroid membrane which lies deep to this point. One then inserts a tube into this opening, which allows one to breathe for the patient with a machine or bag. A needle cricothyotomy is similar, but instead of making a scalpel incision, a large over-the-needle catheter is inserted (12- to 14-gauge). This is considerably simpler, particularly if using specially-designed kits. However, it provides very limited airflow. In particular, a needle cricothyrotomy is insufficient to clear waste carbon dioxide, and so is a stopgap measure. This procedure can buy about 45 minutes of time , after which the patient must receive more definitive care. There is some evidence that (as commonly depicted in popular culture) a ballpoint pen barrel can be, in lieu of a needle, used successfully in extremis to restore an airway. ; Surgical procedure In a typical cricothyrotomy procedure, a scalpel is used to create a 1 cm vertical incision through the skin and the cricothyroid membrane, and the resulting hole is opened by either inserting the scalpel handle into the wound and rotating 90 degrees or by using a clamp. A tracheostomy tube or endotracheal tube with a 6 or 7 mm internal diameter is then inserted, the cuff is inflated, and the tube is secured. A bag-valve device with the highest available concentration of oxygen is used to provide ventilation, the success of which is assessed by bilateral ausculation and observation of the rise and fall of the chest. No attempts are made to remove the tracheostomy or endotracheal tube in a prehospital setting. On the TV show M*A*S*H , Father Mulcahy performs an emergency cricothyrotomy on a patient. With the direction of Dr. Pierce via radio, he uses a pen knife and an eye dropper to perform the operation. Needless to say, this would be extremely dangerous in real life. Even under ideal, clinical conditions, a cricothyrotomy is difficult and requires specific tools, preparation and a practiced knowledge of anatomy. There are many major blood vessels and nerves in the neck and cutting there, even with the best of intentions carries a high risk of harming the patient. In the 1980 Nicolas Roeg film Bad Timing, Theresa Russell's character Milena Flaherty has an emergency cricothyrotomy performed following an intentional overdose. In Grey's Anatomy, emergency cricothyrotomy is mentioned in at least three episodes: In the ER episode "Reason to Believe" Dr. Kerry Weaver performs an emergency cricothyrotomy on a student. She is shooting a news segment on childhood obesity in an elementary school cafeteria when one of the students begins to choke; after the heimlich maneuver fails, she performs a cricothyrotomy with a kitchen knife and a drinking straw. It is also used many other times, especially in the trauma room, when an airway can't be established. In the movie Playing God (1997), David Duchovny plays a famed LA surgeon, stripped of his license due to drug abuse, who finds himself witnessing a gun fight at a bar. He saves a mafia crime figure by performing an emergency cricothyrotomy. This endears him with the mafia family and drives the plot forward. In the BBC3 medical drama Bodies, the main protagonist Rob Lake, a newly appointed obstetrics and gynaecology registrar (played by Max Beesley), is called to a patient who is having difficulty breathing due to epiglottitis. Lake calls for emergency assistance but help is slow coming, so fearing for the patient's life decides to undertake a cricothyrotomy himself - a procedure he has not been trained in. The procedure is unsuccessful and the patient dies before help arrives. The guilt surrounding the event combined with the covering up by his consultant provides an important backdrop to the further development of the character and his relationship with his consultant. On Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman; Sully, the white man raised by Indians who is her lover and companion, performs the procedure on one of Dr. Quinn's boys using a bird's feather (the base where it is hollow). On the New Zealand Soap opera Shortland Street, Series 21, Episode 5104 / 5105, Student doctor Paige Munroe Performs a Cricothyrotomy with a pocket knife and pen and saves a woman's life, even though she was not qualified (and nervous).
