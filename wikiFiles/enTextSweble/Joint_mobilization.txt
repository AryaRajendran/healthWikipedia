 Joint mobilization is a type of passive movement of a skeletal joint. It is usually aimed at a 'target' synovial joint with the aim of achieving a therapeutic effect. When applied to the spine, it is known as spinal mobilization. These techniques are often used by chiropractors, osteopaths, occupational therapists, and physical therapists. Mobilization is a manual therapy intervention and is classified by five 'grades' of motion, each of which describes the range of motion of the target joint during the procedure. Roman numerals are generally used in labelling the grades of motion (i.e. Grades I to V). Grade V is the same as manipulation. The different grades of mobilization are believed to produce selective activation of different mechanoreceptors in the joint:. Ola
