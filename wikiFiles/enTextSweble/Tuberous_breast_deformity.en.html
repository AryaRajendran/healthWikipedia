 Tuberous breasts (or tubular breasts) are a result of a congenital abnormality of the breasts which can occur in both men and women (also see Hypoplasia). During puberty breast development is stymied and the breasts fail to develop normally and fully. The exact cause of this is as yet unclear. The condition is thought to affect one to five per cent of breast augmentation patients. This condition is also known as constricted breasts, tubular breasts. Tuberous breasts are not simply small or underdeveloped breasts. The effect of the condition on the appearance of the breast can range from mild to severe, and typical characteristics include: enlarged, puffy areola, unusually wide spacing between the breasts, minimal breast tissue, sagging, higher than normal breast fold, and narrow base at the chest wall. The condition can affect the ability of women to breastfeed as in some cases the breasts, including the milk glands, have not developed enough to produce breast milk. However, other physical aspects of fertility and pregnancy are not affected by the condition. The appearance of tuberous breasts can potentially be changed through surgical procedures, including the tissue expansion method and breast implants. The procedure to change the appearance of tuberous breasts can be more complicated than a regular breast augmentation, and some plastic surgeons have specialist training in tuberous breast correction. As tuberous breasts are a congenital deformity, referral for treatment under the National Health Service may be possible in the United Kingdom. A starting point for those seeking such a referral may be a visit to their local General Practitioner. For those seeking non-surgical solutions, counseling may be recommended as a way of coming to terms with body image.
