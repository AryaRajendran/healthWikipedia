 Female genital prolapse (or vaginal prolapse) is characterized by a portion of the vaginal canal protruding (prolapsing) from the opening of the vagina. The condition usually occurs when the pelvic floor collapses as a result of childbirth. They are graded either via the Baden-Walker System or the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) System. Vaginal prolapses are treated according to the severity of symptoms. They can be treated: Genital prolapse occurs in about 316Â million women worldwide as of 2010 (9.3% of all females).
