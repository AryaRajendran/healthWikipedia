 Michael B. Yaffe is the Chief Scientific Editor (Editor in Chief) of the peer reviewed science journal Science Signaling published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is currently a Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his Ph.D. in 1987 from the Case Western Reserve University which is where he also received his M.D. in 1989. The main focus of Yaffe's research is decoding natural cell signaling pathway behavior using bioinformatics, combinatorial chemistry, cell biology, physical biochemistry, structural biology and molecular genetics. The stated goal of his team's research is to "understand how signaling pathways are integrated at the molecular and systems level to control cellular responses." Besides his professorship at MIT, Yaffe is also attending surgeon at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. He is also a founder of Consensus Pharmaceuticals and Merrimack Pharmaceuticals. He also co-founded The DNA Repair Company in 2004 and serves as Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board at the company. He also serves as Member of Scientific Advisory Board of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Boston Biomedical Research Institute, Inc He currently has a number of highly cited articles. Two of Yaffe's papers have over 850 citations, and several others have over 400 citations.
