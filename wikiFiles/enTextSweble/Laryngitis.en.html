 Laryngitis is an inflammation of the larynx. It causes hoarse voice or temporary complete loss of the voice because of irritation to the vocal folds (vocal cords). Dysphonia is the medical term for a vocal disorder, of which laryngitis is one cause. Laryngitis is categorized as acute if it lasts less than three weeks. Otherwise it is categorized as chronic, and may last over three weeks. The chronic form occurs mostly in middle age and is much more common in men than women. It is mainly caused by excessive smoking. Laryngitis can be infectious as well as noninfectious in origin. In early stages, erythema (reddening) and edema of epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids and ventricular folds occurs. In late stages, the vocal folds and subglottic structures are also involved. There are sticky secretions between cords and in interarytenoid region. Sometimes, submucous hemorrhage is seen, especially in case of vocal abuse. Acute membranous laryngitis, a condition resembling acute membranous tonsillitis, is caused by pyogenic nonspecific organisms. It has to be differentiated from laryngeal diphtheria. In some cases tightening of the chest may be present due to COPD or other relevant breathing disorder. If you are having difficulty taking in a breath, you may need an inhaler. See your physician. Most cases of laryngitis are viral and resolve without treatment with sufficient voice rest. Laryngitis, hoarseness, or breathiness that lasts for more than two weeks may signal a voice disorder and should be followed up with a voice pathologist. This is typically a vocology certified SLP (speech language pathologist) or a laryngologist (voice specialized ENT). http://www.medicinenet.com/laryngitis/page5.htm http://www.emedicinehealth.com/laryngitis/page5_em.htm
