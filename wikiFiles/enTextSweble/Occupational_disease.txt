 An occupational disease is any chronic ailment that occurs as a result of work or occupational activity. It is an aspect of occupational safety and health. An occupational disease is typically identified when it is shown that it is more prevalent in a given body of workers than in the general population, or in other worker populations. The first such disease to be recognised, squamous-cell carcinoma of the scrotum was identified in chimney sweep boys by Sir Percival Pott in 1775.

Some well-known occupational diseases include: Occupational lung diseases include asbestosis among asbestos miners and those who work with friable asbestos insulation, as well as black lung (coalworker's pneumoconiosis) among coal miners,silicosis among miners and quarrying and tunnel operators and byssinosis among workers in parts of the cotton textile industry.
