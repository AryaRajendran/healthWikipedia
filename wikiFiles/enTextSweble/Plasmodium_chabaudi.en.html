 Plasmodium chabaudi is a parasite of the genus Plasmodium subgenus Vinckeia. Like all Plasmodium species P. chabaudi has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are rodents. This species was described in 1965 by I. Landau. It is named after Dr A. Chabaud. The nuclear genome is 18.8 megabases in size with a karyotype of 14 chromosomes. The G+C content is ~23%. A genome sequencing project is underway. This species is found in Africa. This species was first isolated from the blood of a shiny thicket rat (Thamnomys rutilans) in the Central African Republic. Two subspecies have been defined: P. chabaudi chabaudi and P. chabaudi adami.
