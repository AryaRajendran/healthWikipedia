 Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis is a disorder of the glomeruli (glomerulonephritis), or small blood vessels in the kidneys. It is a common complication of infections, typically streptococcal skin infection (impetigo) rather than streptococcal pharyngitis, for which it is also known as postinfectious or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. It can be a risk factor for future albuminuria. Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis can be a complication of streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) and impetigo. The exact pathology remains unclear, but it is believed to be type III hypersensitivity reaction. Immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes formed during an infection) become lodged in the glomerular basement membrane below the podocyte foot processes. This creates a lumpy bumpy appearance on light microscopy and subepithelial humps on electron microscopy. Complement activation leads to destruction of the basement membrane. It has also been proposed that specific antigens from certain nephrotoxic streptococcal infections have a high affinity for basement membrane proteins, giving rise to particularly severe, long lasting antibody response. Diagnosis rarely requires a renal biopsy since there is usually a classical clinical presentation. There will be elevated levels of ASOT Ab and low complement levels (C3 and C4) in the blood. 1) Hematuria: 2) Oliguria 3) Edema 4) Hypertension. 5) General 6) Acute renal necrosis due to injury of capillary or capillary thrombosis. Diffuse Proliferative Glomerulonephritis (DPGN) is a nephritic syndrome; therefore, it causes edema through an increase in hydrostatic pressure and fluid overload secondary to inflammatory damage. Examples of nephritic syndrome include: DPGN, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and MPGN. Hypoalbuminemia is the cause of edema in nephrotic syndrome (characterized by heavy proteinuriaâ€”greater than 3.5g/day). Examples include: minimal change disease (MCD), membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), lupus, amyloidosis, and diabetes. Possible complications of acute proliferative glomerulonephritis include renal failure and hypertensive encephalopathy.
