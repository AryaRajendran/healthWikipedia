 The glottis is defined as the combination of the vocal folds (vocal cords) and the space in between the folds (the rima glottidis). As the vocal folds vibrate, the resulting vibration produces a "buzzing" quality to the speech, called voice or voicing or pronunciation. Sound production involving only the glottis is called glottal. English has a voiceless glottal transition spelled "h". In many accents of English the glottal stop (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant allophone of the phoneme (and in some dialects, occasionally of and ); in some languages, this sound is a phoneme of its own. Skilled players of the Australian didgeridoo restrict their glottal opening in order to produce the full range of timbres available on the instrument. The vibration produced is an essential component of voiced consonants as well as vowels. If the vocal folds are drawn apart, air flows between them causing no vibration, as in the production of voiceless consonants. The glottis is also important in the valsalva maneuver.
