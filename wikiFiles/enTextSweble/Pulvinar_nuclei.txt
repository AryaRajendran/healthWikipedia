 The pulvinar nuclei (nuclei pulvinares) are a collection of nuclei located in the pulvinar thalamus. The pulvinar part is the most posterior region of the thalamus. The pulvinar is usually grouped as one of the lateral thalamic nuclei in rodents and carnivores, and stands as an independent complex in primates. The word is derived from the Latin pulvinus for "cushion". In Ancient Roman religion a pulvinar was an "empty throne" or cushioned couch for occupation by a deity. It is conventionally divided into anterior, inferior, lateral, and medial subdivisions, each containing multiple nuclei. The pulvinar varies in importance in different animals: it is virtually nonexistent in the rat, and grouped as the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex" with the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus due to its small size in cats. In humans it makes up roughly 40% of the thalamus making it the largest of its nuclei. Lesions of the pulvinar can result in neglect syndromes and attentional deficits.
