 The Medical Protection Society (MPS) is a not for profit organisation which offers legal and ethical help to medical and dental (through its subsidiary company Dental Protection Ltd.) professionals. Based in the United Kingdom, it operates in over 40 countries (including Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa, New Zealand plus the Caribbean and Bermuda) and has over 280,000 members worldwide. The MPS was founded in 1892, with just 13 original members all practising in the home counties of England, and now (2013) has over 280,000 members worldwide. The other two organisations in the same field in the UK are the Medical Defence Union (MDU) and the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland (MDDUS).

Members of the MPS look to the organisation for medicolegal advice and indemnification for the legal costs in defence of their professional reputations. MPS also pays out damages for clinical negligence.

The Council’s obligations and powers are set out in the Memorandum and Articles of Association. A copy of this is sent to members when they join MPS. Some of the servicesprovided by MPS include:
