All recognized medical schools are listed in the FAIMER International Medical Education Directory (IMED) and/or the Avicenna Directory for medicine. Several agencies may also accredit Caribbean medical schools, as listed in the FAIMER Directory of Organizations that Recognize/Accredit Medical Schools (DORA). Caribbean medical schools can be categorized as either regional or offshore. Regional medical schools train students to practice in the country or region where the school is located.
