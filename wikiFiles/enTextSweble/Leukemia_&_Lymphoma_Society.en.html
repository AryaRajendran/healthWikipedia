 The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), founded in 1949, is the world's largest voluntary health organization dedicated to funding blood cancer research, education and patient services. LLS's mission is to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. LLS created the Information Resource Center (IRC) to provide blood cancer patients, their families and health professionals accurate, current disease information and support. IRC information specialists are social workers, nurses and health educators. LLS has 64 chapters nationwide, as well as 4 chapters in Canada. See Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada. Nationwide volunteer fundraising events and activities include Team in Training (an endurance sports training program where volunteers train to complete an endurance sports event while fundraising to support the fight against blood cancers), Light The Night Walk (a community-based walk that celebrates patients battling cancer, their families and supporters), and School & Youth (K-12 student service and cooperative team program to raise awareness and funds to fight blood cancer). Each chapter also organizes its own fundraising activities. LLS is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Financial information, including Form 990s on the organization can be found on Guidestar. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society is accredited with The Better Business Bureau, meeting all 20 standards for charitable accountability and is certified by HonCode, Health on the Net Foundation. Originally known as the Robert Roesler de Villiers Foundation, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society was founded in New York City in 1949 by Rudolph and Antoinette de Villiers after the death of their son Robert from leukemia. The name of the organization was later changed to the Leukemia Society of America in the 1960s, and later to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in 2000 to reflect the organization's focus on all types of blood cancer. Since its founding, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society has provided more than 600 million dollars for research on blood cancers and has coordinated a nationwide informational clearinghouse for medical professionals, caregivers, and patients. For the organization's 60th anniversary, an organizational goal to transform the lives of people with blood cancer and the healthcare landscape that patients, families and caregivers navigate was established. LLS also advocates public policy positions that accelerate progress toward cures for leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma, and to improve the quality of life of those with blood cancer, their friends and families. The signature fundraising program, Team in Training (TNT), is the world's first and largest charity sports training program, raising nearly $1 billion for blood cancer research and patient support since its inception 20 years ago. Additionally, there are yearly endurance events run to benefit the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, including the Rock ‘n’ Roll San Diego Marathon & ½ Marathon, to be held on June 6, 2010. In previous years, Nike, Inc. has sponsored a Women's Marathon for similarly charitable purposes. The largest annual fundraiser is the Light The Night Walk, a non-competitive walk held at various sites throughout the US and Canada, raising funds for blood cancer research and patient support. Children, adults, and seniors walk carrying illuminated balloons - supporters carry red balloons, survivors and patients carry white balloons, and gold balloons are held in memory of a loved one. Additionally each year, candidates from communities across the nation engage in a ten-week fundraising competition to earn the titles of LLS Man & Woman of the Year by raising funds for blood cancer research in honor of local children who are blood cancer survivors, the Boy and Girl of the Year. In 2009, the candidates collectively raised $910,000. Nearly 50 LLS chapters also hold a Leukemia Cup Regatta. Sailors and local businesses raise funds for the society and then participate in a day or two on the water. In addition to the racing, each Regatta holds several social functions which usually include at least one presentation by a world class sailor. Past speakers have included Russell Coutts, Terry Hutchinson, Anna Tunnicliffe, and Gary Jobson. Jobson has been the national Honorary Chairperson for the Regatta since 1994 and was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2003. The first Leukemia Cup Regatta was held in 1988 by a group of sailors seeking to honor their friend who had lost his battle with blood cancer. Since then it has grown to a series of events that raise over $3.2 million annually. In 2008, FarmHouse Fraternity adopted LLS as its International Philanthropy.
