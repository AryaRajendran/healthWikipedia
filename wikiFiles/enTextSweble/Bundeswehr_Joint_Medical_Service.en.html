 The Bundeswehr's Joint Medical Service () is a part of the German Armed Forces but explicitly no new branch of arms. Medical personnel of all three branches (Army, Navy and Air Force) were assigned to a centralized authority which was installed to concentrate their capabilities. However these troops remain members of their original branch of arms. Only very specialized medical units (such as medical care for divers and aircraft crews) are not a part of the Joint Medical Service. Just like all other branches of the German Armed Forces, the Joint Medical Service is divided into two divisions, one exercising command and control over the operational units whilst the other is in charge of schools and facilities. Furthermore, the area of responsibility is divided into four Medical Regions, each commanded by a central authority and identical to the four Defense District Commands of the Armed Forces.
