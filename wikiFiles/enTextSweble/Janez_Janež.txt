 Janez Janež (pronounced ; January 14, 1913 - October 11, 1990) was a Slovene medical doctor and surgeon, who worked for most of his life in mainland China and Taiwan. In Chinese he's known as Fan Fenglong () or simply Doctor Fan (). Janež was born on January 14, 1913 in Dolsko near Ljubljana, Slovenia. His parents Ana and Franc Janež had three other sons (Franc jr., Karel and Viktor) and one daughter (Mimi). After baccalaureate on classical gymnasium his mother encouraged him to study theology. Janež however decided to study medicine in Ljubljana, Zagreb and Graz. He promoted on May 28, 1937. Later he continued special studies in Belgrade and Vienna. Since 1937, he has been working as a surgeon in Ljubljana hospital. He continued to work as physician and surgeon during the World War II. In the war time he was neither military nor politically active. He was never collaborating with German or Italian forces, but after the war Yugoslav communist authorities accused him of collaborationism and put him on death-sentence list. To save his life he fled to a refugee camp in Carinthia, Austria. This camp was under British military command. When Yugoslavia demanded the repatriation of these refugees, British soldiers loaded them on a train saying that they were going to Italy. Janež however suspected that they were going in wrong direction and he fled again. It was a right decision - most of the people on the train were slaughtered in Kočevski Rog and several other locations in Slovenia, without trying to find out who's guilty and who not. Janež spent a while hiding in Austria. In 1947 he went to Rome, Italy. There he met Ladislav Lenček, a lazarist who proposed him to go to China and help Italian missionaries as a physician. Janež decided to become a layman missionary - a Christian missionary who has not received Holy Orders, but dedicates his life in serving other people and giving them a good example of Christian love and virtues. Soon he left Italy, and after a shorter stop in South America, he came to China. In mainland China he worked as a medical doctor in Zhaotong (昭通, WG: Chaot'ung), Yunnan. The hospital in Zhaotong was supervised by Camillian monks from Italy and school sisters from Slovenia. On his arrival the hospital was in quite bad condition - it was lacking modern equipment and the staff was not suitably qualified. Janež organized educational training of staff and bought some modern equipment (thanks to donations made by sponsors from abroad): X-ray machine and surgical instruments. Soon the hospital experienced a real boom and the fame of a miraculous doctor who can cure any illness began to spread among the neighboring population. In this period Janež realized that he won't be able to establish a sincere contact with his patients without the knowledge of language, so he began learning Chinese. In 1952 the Chinese communist authorities arrested the entire hospital staff. Janež was (along with some colleagues) sentenced to death but later his sentence was changed to the expulsion from the country. He moved to Taiwan to the city of Luodong (羅東, WG: Lotung). He intentionally chose this small and undeveloped town because he saw that the people living there have a greater need of his medical help. The situation in the city was desperate: Taiwan accepted many refugees from the mainland, the people were struck by poverty and diseases caused by lack of hygiene. There was no hospital. The Camilian monks established a small ambulatory clinic which over years evolved to a modern hospital, now known as St Mary's Hospital. In this hospital Janež lived and worked for the next 38 years. He worked since dawn till late evening, he often had 10 or more difficult operations in one day. In all this time he refused wage - he requested only a small apartment, food and a little pocket money. He died on October 11, 1990. He was buried on October 19 in Luodong. On the day of his burial an enormous crowd came to Luodong to honor the memory of this great man whose entire life was a sacrifice to the simple people in need. Pope awarded him Order of St. Sylvester and Order of St. Gregory the Great. Taiwanese authorities awarded him the medal "The Good Man". In 2007 Dr Fan Fenglong Memorial Center (范鳳龍紀念大樓 Fan Fenglong jinian dalou) was opened in Luodong.
