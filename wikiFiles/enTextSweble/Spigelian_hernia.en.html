 A Spigelian hernia (or lateral ventral hernia) is a hernia through the spigelian fascia, which is the aponeurotic layer between the rectus abdominis muscle medially, and the semilunar line laterally. These hernias almost always develop at or below the linea arcuata, probably because of the lack of posterior rectus sheath. These are generally interparietal hernias, meaning that they do not lie below the subcutaneous fat but penetrate between the muscles of the abdominal wall; therefore, there is often no notable swelling. Spigelian hernias are usually small and therefore risk of strangulation is high. Most occur on the right side. (4thâ€“7th decade of life). Compared to other types of hernias they are rare. Patients typically present with either an intermittent mass, localized pain, or signs of bowel obstruction. Ultrasonography or a CT scan can establish the diagnosis, although CT scan provides the greatest sensitivity and specificity. These hernias should be repaired because of the high risk of strangulation; fortunately, surgery is straightforward, with only larger defects requiring a mesh prosthesis. Varied Spigelian hernia mesh repair techniques have been described, although evidence suggests laparoscopy results in less morbidity and shorter hospitalization compared with open procedures. Mesh-free laparoscopic suture repair is feasible and safe. This novel uncomplicated approach to small Spigelian hernias combines the benefits of laparoscopic localization, reduction, and closure without the morbidity and cost associated with foreign material. Adriaan van den Spiegel, a surgeon-anatomist born in Brussels, described this hernia. The first publication was in 1645, twenty years after Spiegel's death.
