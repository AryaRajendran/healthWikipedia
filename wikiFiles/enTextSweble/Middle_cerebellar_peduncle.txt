 The middle cerebellar peduncles (brachia pontis) are paired structures (left and right) that connect the cerebellum to the pons and are composed entirely of centripetal fibers, which arise from the cells of the nuclei pontis of the opposite side and end in the cerebellar cortex; the fibers are arranged in three fasciculi, superior, inferior, and deep.
