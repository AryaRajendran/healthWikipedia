 The International Lyme And Associated Diseases Society (ILADS, pronounced ) is a non-profit interest group which advocates for greater acceptance of the controversial medical entity of chronic Lyme disease. Controversy exists as to the existence and proper treatment of chronic Lyme disease. Major patient advocacy organizations, as well as the Center for Science in the Public Interest support the ILADS position. In addition, several states including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island have laws protecting doctors who use ILADS treatment guidelines. Major US medical authorities, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Institutes of Health, have stated that there is no convincing evidence that Borrelia is involved in chronic Lyme disease. Along with a few physicians, ILADS has questioned the generalizability and reliability of some of the trials referred to by IDSA and the reliability of the current diagnostic tests. As a result of this fundamentally different view of the nature of long-term effects of Borrelia infection, ILADS has produced treatment recommendations which conflict with those of major mainstream medical bodies. A 2004 article in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal on the prevalence of inaccurate online information about Lyme disease cited the ILADS website as a source of such inaccurate material. ILADS announced in 2008 that it had started a physician's training program in conjunction with the Turn the Corner Foundation (TTCF). According to the TTCF, it also gave a grant to develop a DNA-based detection test for Lyme disease.
