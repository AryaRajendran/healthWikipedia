 Prenatal sex discernment is the prenatal testing for discerning the sex of a fetus before birth. Prenatal sex discernment can be performed by preimplantation genetic diagnosis before conception, but this method may not always be classified as prenatal sex discernment because it's performed even before implantation. Potential applications of prenatal sex discernment include: Prenatal sex determination was banned in India in 1994, under the Pre-conception and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act. The act aims to prevent sex-selective abortion, which, according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, "has its roots in Indiaâ€™s long history of strong patriarchal influence in all spheres of life".
