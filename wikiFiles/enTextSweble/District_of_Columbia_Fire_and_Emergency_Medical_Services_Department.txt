 The District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, (also known as DC FEMS, FEMS, DCFD, DC Fire, or Fire & EMS), established July 1, 1884, is the municipal fire department and emergency medical service agency for Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. An organ of the devolved district government, Fire & EMS is responsible for providing fire suppression, ambulance service and hazardous materials containment for the federal district. On January 13, 1803, prior to the formation of a fire fighting company in the city, Washington's first law regarding fire control was passed; this law instructed that for every building in the city, the building's owner must provide leather buckets for use in fire suppression. Owners were required to provide as many buckets as there were stories to the building. The fine for failure to provide the required number of buckets was one dollar per missing bucket. To resolve problems stemming from the rivalry between competing private volunteer companies, an act to organize a paid fire department was approved in 1864 and implemented on September 23, 1871, with a combination of paid and volunteer staff. This very first incarnation of the fire department had seven paid firefighters and thirteen call men to answer alarms, manning three engines and two ladders. By 1900, the DCFD had grown to 14 engine, 4 ladder and 2 chemical companies. Rescuers and firefighters from the DCFD were major participants in the 1968 riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Widespread civil unrest, looting and arson resulted in the mobilization of the entire force, along with 70 outside companies, to battle over 500 fires and perform 120 rescues during the four days of disorder. The DCFD operates 33 Fire Stations, located throughout the district in 6 Battalions, under the command of 6 Battalion Chiefs and a Deputy Chief.

In January 2010, The Washington Examiner reported that, in a major management failure, the agency failed to budget for seniority pay in its fiscal 2010 budget, causing a $2 million shortfall. After a hiring freeze left 130 positions unfilled, the department was projected to spend $15.4 million in fiscal 2010 (2.5 times the budgeted amount). More than 75 percent of the agency's budget goes to salaries and fringe benefits. The DC Fire & EMS Department was profiled in episode 5 of Discovery Channel's Nerve Center, which first aired in June 2011. The episode followed the Department's activities on October 30â€“31, 2010, including providing emergency medical services at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear and the 35th Marine Corps Marathon. In late August 2011, the department shuttered it's popular Twitter account. The new communications director, Lon Walls, stated that "Social media is for parties. We ain't giving parties." The department PIO, Pete Piringer, was transferred to another agency. After pushback from local media, the account returned, without Piringer, though it no longer reports crime-related events, such as response to stabbings or shootings.
