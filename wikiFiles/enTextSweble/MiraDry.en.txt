 miraDry, is the trademark name of a non-invasive microwave-based technology for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis created by Miramar Labs in 2006 and FDA Cleared in 2011. Axillary hyperhidrosis, or excessive underarm sweat, is a medical condition where the sweat glands are overactive, producing more sweat than is needed to cool the body. MiraDry is a treatment that destroys sweat glands in the axilla (underarms) without surgery. MiraDry currently does not treat hyperhidrosis for hands or feet. The treatment is currently offered in both the US and Japan. MiraDry utilizes microwave energy, for the reduction or removal of sweat glands. The current product use is for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis. Microwave energy is suited to address hyperhidrosis because it can penetrate to the dermal-fat interface where sweat glands reside. Due to the microwave frequency chosen, device design, and the electromagnetic properties of skin and fat, constructive interference occurs and creates a Focal Energy Zone. The energy generates heat which results in thermolysis of the sweat glands. In parallel, a continuous hydro-ceramic cooling system protects the dermis while heat continues to spread into the region where sweat glands reside, resulting in cellular thermolysis. Sweat glands do not regenerate, so once destroyed, the excess sweat glands are permanently disabled.
