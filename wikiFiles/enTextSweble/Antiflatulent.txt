 An antiflatulent agent is a drug used for the alleviation or prevention of excessive intestinal gas, i.e., flatulence. For the alleviation of flatulence, an antifoaming agent such as simeticone may be taken orally. This agent will coalesce the smaller gas bubbles into larger bubbles, thereby easing the release of gas within the gastrointestinal tract via burping or flatulence.
