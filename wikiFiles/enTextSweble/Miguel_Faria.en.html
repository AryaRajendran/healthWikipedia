 Miguel A. Faria, Jr., M.D. (born 30 September 1952) is an Associate Editor-in-Chief and a World Affairs Editor of Surgical Neurology International (SNI), an open access, international journal of neurosurgery and neuroscience. He is a retired neurosurgeon and noted neuroscientist, editor and author, medical historian and ethicist, public health critic, defender of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and advocate of freedom in medicine. Faria is a former Clinical Professor of Surgery (Neurosurgery, ret.) and Adjunct Professor of Medical History (ret.) at Mercer University School of Medicine, in Macon, Georgia. He has written over 200 scientific and medical articles, as well as opinion pieces, published in both the professional and lay literature. His topics are myriad, ranging in areas of interest in science and medicine from brain surgery for the removal of cerebral tumors; traumatic blood clots of the brain; diagnosis and treatment of pituitary tumors via microsurgery; diagnosis and treatment of cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations; radiographic techniques; diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of the Chiari types I and II Malformations; advances in neurosurgery; to medical history and politics. Faria has written or coauthored several chapters in medical textbooks, and his works are cited and referenced in a number of other books and publications. He is the sole author of three books: Vandals at the Gates of Medicine — Historic Perspectives on the Battle Over Health Care Reform (1995), Medical Warrior: Fighting Corporate Socialized Medicine (1997), and Cuba In Revolution: Escape From a Lost Paradise (2002). Faria has studied Soviet communism and the Cold War and has written articles and reviewed books detailing many of the crimes committed by former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and his henchmen. Most recently in a historic and medical article published in Surgical Neurology International entitled “Stalin’s Mysterious Death,” Faria cited compelling evidence that the Russian dictator was poisoned, eliminated by members of his inner circle, including Lavrentiy Beria and others, who feared for their own survival. He continues to closely follow the evolving democratic process in Russia today. Faria was appointed by HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson to serve on the Injury Research Grant Review Committee (later renamed the Initial Review Group [IRG]) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He served on that committee from 2002-2005. The IRG reviews grants seeking public funding for scientific and technical merit in the area of injury prevention and control. His appointment to the CDC committee by the George W. Bush Administration was of great interest to public health because during the 1990s, Faria was involved in the gun control debate regarding the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). Faria and other critics felt the NCIPC's program on gun violence was involved in gun politics and biased against gun owners, promoting "politicized, result-oriented research.” In March 1996, Faria testified before the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health, and Human Services to that effect stating, "I have yet to see a published report that has been funded by the NCIPC in which the benefits of firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens have been published even though they are there...if you don't conclude that guns are bad and that they need to be eradicated because they are a 'public heath menace,' they are not published." Faria wanted to defund the NCIPC entirely but Congress opted to act by prohibiting the CDC from funding gun research and proscribed public health officials from using taxpayer's money in lobbying and participating in politically partisan activities. Faria's views on his testimony remain unaltered. In March 1990, Faria traveled to El Salvador as part of a fact-finding mission sponsored by Accuracy In Media (AIM), an organization headed at that time by the late Reed Irvine and Joseph Goulden. Faria agreed with AIM that the American media coverage of news from El Salvador was biased against the conservative government and favored the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) insurgents. During this trip to El Salvador, Faria visited hospitals and orphanages. He found that while neighboring Sandinista Nicaragua directed its efforts almost solely for war, the government of El Salvador, despite the ongoing war against the communist rebels of the FMLN, directed much of its resources toward the welfare of its citizens in health and education. After his return to the United States, Faria, who was then serving as Chief-of-Staff at HCA Coliseum Medical Centers in Macon, Georgia, convinced Dr. Thomas Frist Jr., CEO of Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), to send humanitarian assistance to El Salvador, which received the assistance with gratitude. During 1993-1995, Faria was the editor of the Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia, taking that state medical journal to national prominence and controversy. Faria has also described the circumstances surrounding his resignation in correspondence and in his book Medical Warrior. In 1996 Faria founded and served as Editor-in-Chief of the Medical Sentinel of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). As Editor of the Medical Sentinel, Faria called for an "open data, public review policy in peer reviewed medical journalism." He called for other medical journal editors to post research data online thereby allowing investigators to validate scientific conclusions before public policy is implemented, particularly in the area of public health. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that public policy is dictated by sound scientific principles and not by premature assertions or tainted by politics or ideology. Faria left AAPS in 2002 to pursue other interests. From 2004-2010, Faria served on the Editorial Board of Surgical Neurology, an international journal of neurosurgery, formerly the Official International Journal of the Neurosurgical Societies of Belgium, Brazil, China, Romania, Russia, and Taiwan. Surgical Neurology International (SNI), its successor publication, is also headed by James I. Ausman, M.D., Editor-in-Chief. Faria now serves with SNI as one of its editors, along with his friend and colleague, Dr. Russell Blaylock. Faria's last historical and autobiographical book, Cuba in Revolution — Escape From a Lost Paradise, details his childhood experiences and his family’s involvement in the Cuban Revolution. Faria's parents were members of the urban underground Revolutionary Directorate (RD) under Faure Chomón that fought against the dictator Fulgencio Batista. Faria (age 13) and his father, also a physician, were prompted to a daring escape from Cuba while under the watch of Castro's G2 (i.e., state security). A police informant attempted to trap and implicate the elder Faria in collaborating with the anticommunist rebels fighting in the so-called War against the Bandits. Their escape was successful, despite the inquiries and pursuit of the G2 police, and the tale of their escape through several Caribbean islands is also narrated in Faria's book. Dr. Miguel A. Faria, Jr. continues to write and edit articles on science, politics, history, and socio-economic topics for numerous journals and websites, particularly Surgical Neurology International and his own website, HaciendaPublishing.com.
