 A limited symptom attack (LSA), also referred to as a limited symptom panic attack (LPA), is a milder, less comprehensive form of panic attack, with fewer than 4 panic related symptoms being experienced (APA 1994). For example, a sudden episode of intense dizziness or trembling accompanied by fear that something terrible is about to happen. Many people with panic disorder have a mixture of full blown and limited symptom attacks. LSAs often manifest in anxiety disorders, phobias, panic disorder and agoraphobia. However, experiencing a LSA is not necessarily indicative of mental illness. Often persons recovering from and/or being treated for panic attacks and panic disorder will experience LSAs. According to the DSM-IV, during a LSA, fewer than 4 of the following symptoms would be experienced, in contrast to a full blown panic attack, which must include 4 or more symptoms. As with a panic attack, a LSA typically peaks in 10 minutes. However, attacks can be as short as 1 to 5 minutes or can form a series of episodes waxing and waning for a period of hours.
