 Verrucous carcinoma is a type of squamous cell carcinoma that may be associated with HPV infection (usually HPV types 6 and 11). Several subtypes of verrucous carcinoma have been described. Treatment of verrucous carcinoma with radiation therapy should be avoided due to the risk of anaplastic transformation.
