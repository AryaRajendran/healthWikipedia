 Semen extender is a liquid diluent which is added to semen to preserve its fertilizing ability. The extender allows the semen to be freighted to the female, rather than requiring the male and female to be near to each other. Special freezing extender use also allows cryogenic preservation of sperm ("frozen semen"), which may be transported for use, or used on-site at a later date. The addition of extender to semen protects the sperm against possible damage by toxic seminal plasma, as well as providing nutrients and cooling buffers if the semen is to be cooled. In the case of freezing extenders, one or more penetrating cryoprotectants will be added. Typical cryoprotectants include glycerol, DMSO and dimethylformamide. Egg yolk, which has cryoprotective properties, is also a common component. In the equine, Kenney extender (named after its developer, Dr. Robert M. Kenney of the University of Pennsylvania, New Bolton) has been used for many years, and contains a non-fat dried milk solid (NFDMS) and glucose. Dual-sugar extenders typically have similar ingredients, with an additional sugar, sucrose. Other extenders (e.g. INRA '96) may also contain milk components. Antibiotics are almost universal in semen extenders, especially those being used for shipping or freezing semen. Ticarcillin (often used in combination with clavulanic acid under the designation timentin), amikacin sulfate, penicillin, and gentamicin are commonly used. The latter - gentamicin - has been noted to reduce sperm motility in the equine.
