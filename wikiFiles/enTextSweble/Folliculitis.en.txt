 Folliculitis (also known as "Hot Tub Rash") is the inflammation of one or more hair follicles. The condition may occur anywhere on the skin with the exception of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They may appear as red dots that come to white tips on the chest, back and arms. Most carbuncles, furuncles, and other cases of folliculitis develop from Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Folliculitis starts when hair follicles are damaged by friction from clothing, an insect bite, blockage of the follicle, shaving, or braids too tight and too close to the scalp. In most cases of folliculitis, the damaged follicles are then infected with the bacterium Staphylococcus. Iron deficiency anemia is sometimes associated with chronic cases.
