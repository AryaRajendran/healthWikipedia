 The Association of Women Surgeons is an international organization of women who practice in surgical specialties which remained male dominated for years after women entered medicine in large numbers. The organization was formalized following a strategic planning session in which its mission statement, "To inspire, encourage, and enable women surgeons to achieve their personal and professional goals," was developed and adopted. The Association of Women Surgeons was founded in 1981 when Patricia Numann, M.D, invited as many female surgeons as she could identify to breakfast at the October meeting of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) in the San Francisco Hilton Hotel. Sharing many common experiences, and concerns, this small group of women decided to meet annually. For the next few years, these breakfasts were the first significant contact that many female residents or newly practicing female surgeons had with more professionally advanced surgical women. Note: beginning with the 1995-1996, presidential terms changed from two years to one year.
