 Brenner tumors are uncommon tumours that are part of the surface epithelial-stromal tumor group of ovarian neoplasms. The majority of these tumours are benign. However, they can be malignant. They are most frequently found as incidental findings on pelvic examination or at laparotomy. Brenner tumours very rarely can occur in other locations, including testis. On gross pathological examination, they are solid, sharply circumscribed and pale yellow-tan in colour. 90% are unilateral (arising in one ovary, the other is unaffected). The tumours can vary in size from less than to . Borderline and malignant Brenner tumours are possible but each are rare. Histologically, there are nests of transitional-type epithelial cells with longitudinal nuclear grooves (coffee bean nuclei) lying in abundant fibrous stroma. Transitional cell carcinoma is an even rarer entity, in which neoplastic transitional epithelial cells similar to transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder are seen in the ovary, without the characteristic stromal/epithelial pattern of a Brenner tumour. It is named for Fritz Brenner, who characterized it in 1907. The term "Brenner tumor" was first used by Robert Meyer, in 1932.
