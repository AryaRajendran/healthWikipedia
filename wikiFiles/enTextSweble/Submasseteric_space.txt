 The submasseterric space (also termed the masseteric space) is a fascial space of the head and neck (sometimes also termed fascial spaces or tissue spaces). It is a potential space in the face over the angle of the jaw, and is paired on each side. It is located between the lateral aspect of the mandible and the medial aspect of the masseter muscle and its investing fascia. The term is derived from sub- meaning "under" in Latin and masseteric which refers to the masseter muscle. The submasseteric space is one of the four compartments of the masticator space. Sometimes the submasseteric space is described as a series of spaces, created because the masseter muscle has multiple insertions that cover most of the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible. The boundaries of each buccal space are: The communications of each submasseteric space are: In health, the space contains: Submasseteric abscesses are relatively rare, and may be confused with a parotid abscess or parotitis. They tend to be chronic. The submasseteric space may be involved by infections that spread from the buccal space. Sometimes mandibular fractures in the region of the angle of the mandible may cause an infection of the submasseteric space. The signs and symptoms of a submasseteric abscess may include marked trismus (i.e. difficulty opening the mouth, since the masseter elevates the mandible and it becomes restricted) and swelling in the region of the masseter muscle. The treatment of a submasseteric space infection is usually by surgical incision and drainage, and the incision is placed intra-orally (inside the mouth) or both intra and extra-orally if other parts of the masticator space are involved. The submasseteric space is sometimes involved by the spread of odontogenic infections, such as a pericoronal abscess associated with an impacted mandibular third molar (lower wisdom tooth) when the apices of the tooth lie very close to or within the space.
