 Medsin is a grassroots student network focussed on global health equity. Its vision is "A fair and just world in which equity in health is a reality for all". Its mission is "To create a network of students empowered to effect tangible social and political change in health on a local, national and gloabl level through education, advocacy and community action" Formed in 1995, the organisation has branches over 30 Universities in the UK. Medsin is the UK member of the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations. Medsin-UK is a registered charity tasked with facilitating the activities of Medsin in the UK. It has an elected national committee consisting of students active within Medsin, and a regional structure to aid communication between branches and the national committee. A by-law in its constitution prevents it from accepting donations from pharmaceutical companies. Medsin branches, campaigns and projects are autonomous. Medsin consists of its branches, affiliated activities, regional coordinators, the national committee, and a board of trustees. The network also holds two conferences per year. Branches are located at almost every medical school within the UK, as well as at some other universities and educational institutions. There are 10 nationally recognised projects running at individual branches throughout the UK which seek to tackle a wide range of health issues. Medsin works on a number of campaigns, which reflect their aim to raise awareness of global health issues and reduce health inequalities. Past campaigning activity has included the topics of 'Water and Sanitation' and access to free health care for refused asylum seekers. Medsin also works with external partners, including Oxfam and Student Partnership Worldwide. Their campaigns seek to raise awareness, lobby, and motivate students to take action on important issues.
