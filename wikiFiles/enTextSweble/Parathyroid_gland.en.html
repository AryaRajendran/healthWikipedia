 The parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck that produce parathyroid hormone. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, which are usually located on the rear surface of the thyroid gland, or, in rare cases, within the thyroid gland itself or in the chest. Parathyroid glands control the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones. The parathyroid glands are four or more small glands, about the size of a grain of rice, located on the posterior surface (back side) of the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands usually weigh between 25 mg and 40 mg in humans. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher (closer to the head) are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are named for their proximity to the thyroid but serve a completely different role than the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands are quite easily recognizable from the thyroid as they have densely packed cells, in contrast with the follicle structure of the thyroid. However, at surgery, they are harder to differentiate from the thyroid or fat. Because the inferior thyroid arteries provide the primary blood supply to the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland where the parathyroid glands are located, branches of these arteries usually supply the parathyroid glands. However they may also be supplied by the branches of the superior thyroid arteries; the thyroid ima artery; or the laryngeal, tracheal and esophageal artery. Parathyroid veins drain into thyroid plexus of veins of the thyroid gland. Lymphatic vessels from the parathyroid glands drain into deep cervical lymph nodes and paratracheal lymph nodes. In the histological sense, they distinguish themselves from the thyroid gland, as they contain two types of cells: The parathyroid glands were first discovered in the Indian Rhinoceros by Richard Owen in 1850. The glands were first discovered in humans by Ivar Viktor Sandström (1852-1889), a Swedish medical student, in 1880 at Uppsala University. It is the last major organ to be recognized in humans so far. The major function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's calcium level within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. Parathyroid hormone (PTH, also known as parathormone) is a small protein that takes part in the control of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin. Calcium PTH increases blood calcium levels by stimulating osteoclasts to break down bone and release calcium. PTH also increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption by activating vitamin D, and promotes calcium conservation (reabsorption) by the kidneys. Phosphate PTH is the major regulator of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal and also distal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Through activation of Vitamin D the absorption of Phosphate is increased. Many conditions are associated with disorders of parathyroid function. These can be divided into those causing hyperparathyroidism, and those causing hypoparathyroidism. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of neural crest mesenchyme and third and fourth branchial pouch endoderm. Eya-1 (transcripitonal co-activator), Six-1 (a homeobox transcription factor), and Gcm-2 (a transcription factor) have been associated with the development of the parathyroid gland, and alterations in these genes alters parathyroid gland development. The superior parathyroids arise from the fourth pharyngeal pouch, and the inferior parathyroids arise from the third pharyngeal pouch. They are vertically transposed during embryogenesis. This is significant in function-preserving parathyroidectomy, because both the superior and the inferior parathyroids are supplied by the inferior thyroid artery. If the surgeon is to leave a single functional parathyroid for the patient, he/she must preserve the appropriate blood supply. Parathyroid glands are found in all adult tetrapods, although they vary in their number, and in their exact position. Mammals typically have four parathyroids, while other groups typically have six. The removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning and irregular muscle contractions. Fish do not possess parathyroid glands, although the ultimobranchial glands, which are found close to the oesophagus, may have a similar function and could even be homologous with the tetrapod parathyroids. Even these glands are absent in the most primitive vertebrates, the jawless fish, but as these species have no bone in their skeletons, only cartilage, it may be that they have less need to regulate calcium metabolism. The conserved homology of genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills with those in the parathryroid glands of birds and mammals is recognized by evolutionary developmental biology as evolution-using genes and gene networks in novel ways to generate new structures with some similar functions and novel functions.
