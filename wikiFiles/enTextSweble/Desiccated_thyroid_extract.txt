 Desiccated thyroid or thyroid extract, refers to porcine (or mixed beef and pork) thyroid glands, dried and powdered for therapeutic use. Pork (or mixed beef and pork) thyroid preparations were developed in the late 19th century, and are still used today to treat hypothyroidism, the condition of having an underactive thyroid gland. This product is sometimes referred to as "natural thyroid", "natural thyroid hormones", "pork thyroid", thyroid USP, thyroid BP, or by the name of a commercial brand, such as "Armour Thyroid" or "Nature-Throid" & "Westhroid". Desiccated thyroid has been described in the United States Pharmacopoeia for nearly a century as the cleaned, dried, and powdered thyroid gland previously deprived of connective tissue and fat... obtained from domesticated animals that are used for food by man (USP XVI). In the last few decades, pork alone is the usual source. Historically, before modern assays, the potency was specified only by iodine content ("not less than 0.17% and not more than 0.23%"), rather than hormonal content or activity. Brands include Forest Lab's Armour, and Naturethroid & Westhroid by RLC Labs. Also available is a new generic NP thyroid by Acella Pharmaceuticals. Canada's desiccated thyroid is made by Erfa and is called Thyroid. All consist of desiccated porcine thyroid powder, differing only in the binders and fillers. Nature-Throid and Westhroid are available in the following strengths: 1/4(16.25 mg), 1/2(32.5 mg), 3/4(48.75 mg), 1(65 mg), 1.25(81.25 mg), 1.5(97.5 mg), 1.75(113.75), 2(130 mg), 2.25(146.25 mg), 2.5(162.5 mg), 3(195 mg), 4(260 mg), & 5(325 mg) grain. Each one grain (65 mg) contains 9 mcg of T3, and 38 mcg of T4. All brands contain a mixture of thyroid hormones: T4 (thyroxine), T3 (triiodothyronine) in the proportions usually present in pig thyroids (approximately 80% T4 and 20% T3). Armour is made in the following strengths: 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, and 3 grain as well as 4 and 5 grain tablets. One grain (about 60 mg) of desiccated thyroid contains about 38 mcg of T4 and 9 mcg of T3. Because the preparation is whole thyroid gland, each 60 mg tablet also contains over 59 mg of all of the other constituents of pork thyroid glands. The earliest oral treatment for hypothyroidism consisted of thyroid extract. George Redmayne Murray of the United Kingdom first described treatment of myxedema with thyroid extract in 1891, and published a description of long-term successful treatment (28 years) of a patient with myxedema (severe hypothyroidism) in 1920 His treatment was quickly adopted in North America and Europe. The first recorded American use dates to 1891 by a woman who was still taking it 52 years later at 84 years of age Desiccated thyroid extract is prepared from pig thyroid glands. The glands are dried (desiccated), ground to powder, combined with binder chemicals, and pressed into pills. This was a new use for parts that were previously unwanted slaughterhouse offal, and Armour and Company, the dominant American meatpacker in the 20th century, supplied the best-known brand of thyroid extract. Replacement by thyroid extract in hypothyroidism was one of the most effective treatments of any disease available to physicians before the middle of the 20th century, and in severe cases afforded dramatic relief of the myriad symptoms. The decision to treat was usually based on the presence of signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism because there were no accurate, readily available laboratory tests of thyroid function. Many less severe cases of hypothyroidism went untreated. Dosage was regulated by improvement of symptoms. Desiccated Thyroid became a commercial treatment option in 1934 with Westhroid, and has to this day, never been recalled for instability. In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by levothyroxine (T4), or by combinations of T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed levothyroxine or T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract. Several reasons have been identified as to why prescriptions changed from the previously-effective desiccated thyroid treatment. These factors included a desire for improved effectiveness, medical evidence, scientific theory, cultural fashion, and effective marketing. Thyroid care changed in other ways as well. Accurate T4 and T3 measurements became widely used in the 1970s, and by the late 1980s, TSH measurement had become sensitive enough to detect mild degrees of hyperthyroidism and overtreatment. To no one's surprise, blood levels of thyroid hormones and TSH were found to be the best predictors of objective benefits from thyroid replacement: those with the most severe measurable deficiency enjoyed the most dramatic and sustained benefits. It was also discovered that even mild hyperthyroidism as defined by a suppressed TSH level, whether due to disease or overtreatment, was associated with poorer bone density in women, and with higher rates of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients. Doctors began to trust the TSH measurement more and more as the index of optimal replacement dose. As more doctors prescribed thyroxine instead of thyroid extract, the use of thyroid extract became associated with those whose medical practices deviated in many ways from standard care. (See complementary and alternative medicine.) This association became a disincentive for using thyroid extract, and those prescribing it were considered to be unscientific and irrational practitioners. Desiccated thyroid is preferred by a growing body of patients and doctors who claim better relief of symptoms such as fatigue and depressed mood. Many proponents of desiccated thyroid feel passionately about the issue. . A number of specific claims are commonly made about thyroid extract: To endocrinologists the preference of some hypothyroid people for thyroid extract raises some important questions which current evidence cannot answer with certainty: Despite claims of proponents that desiccated thyroid pills are superior to thyroxine or combinations of T4 and T3 for most people with hypothyroidism, no controlled clinical trials have been published, and many physicians remain unconvinced that the superiority is anything other than a placebo effect or an overtreatment effect. At present, a large majority of people (at least in the English-speaking world) of all ages with hypothyroidism are being treated with levothyroxine. When their blood levels of thyroid hormones and TSH are most normal, the majority have no more signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism than similar members of the population. The Royal College of Physicians has recommended the exclusive use of synthetic levothyroxine for the treatment of hypothyroidism. There are several books promoting thyroid hormone replacement with desiccated thyroid:
