 Marie Curie Cancer Care is a registered charitable organisation in the United Kingdom which provides nursing care, without charge, to terminally ill people at home and in hospices. It was established in 1948, the same year as the National Health Service. In financial year 2010/11 the charity provided care to 31,800 terminally ill patients in the community and in its nine hospices, along with support for their families. More than 2,700 nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals help provide this care. At the nine Marie Curie Hospices, quality of life for patients is actively promoted as is providing much needed support for their carers. Marie Curie provides the largest number of hospice beds outside the National Health Service. Research commissioned by Marie Curie Cancer Care shows that 65 per cent of people would choose to die at home; in reality only 25 per cent do. Marie Curie Nurses, always free of charge to patients and carers, provide home care for thousands of people with terminal cancer and other illnesses across the UK every year. Marie Curie Nurses cared for around 50 per cent of all cancer patients who die at home, working by day or through the night. The nurses also provide practical and emotional support for families and carers. Marie Curie Cancer Care provides the largest number of hospice beds outside the NHS and voluntary contributions, together with statutory government funding, are essential to continue providing these services. There are hospices in Belfast, Bradford, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London (Hampstead), Liverpool, Newcastle, Penarth (near Cardiff), and Solihull. Marie Curie Cancer Care conducts palliative care research to find better ways of caring for terminally ill people. It also funds seven scientific teams at UK universities investigating the causes and treatments of cancer. Marie Curie Cancer Care adopted the daffodil emblem in 1986; it is also the emblem of leading cancer charities in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. Marie Curie Cancer Care's biggest fundraising campaign is called The Great Daffodil Appeal and takes place throughout March each year. Actor Hugh Grant did publicity work for the organization in 2008 after his mother received care from Marie Curie Cancer Research.
