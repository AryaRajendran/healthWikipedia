 Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) is a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode used during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. It delivers a preset inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). BPAP can be described as a continuous positive airway pressure system with a time-cycled or flow-cycled change of the applied CPAP level. CPAP, BPAP and other non-invasive ventilation modes have been shown to be effective management tools for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute respiratory failure. Another term for bilevel positive airway pressure, and the term becoming increasingly adopted by the medical community, is non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Bilevel positive airway pressure is used when positive airway pressure is needed with the addition of pressure support. Common situations where positive airway pressure is indicated are those where taking a breath is difficult. These include pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and status asthmaticus. Often BPAP is incorrectly referred to as "BiPAP". . Biphasic/bilevel as a mode of ventilation was first presented in 1988 by Professor Benzer of Innsbruck and his group. His theory consisted of alternating PEEP levels. This was the first time the acronym BIPAP was used and was followed in 1989 with the publication of a new approach to ventilatory technique by Baum & Benzer which was also the first full year of commercial introduction of "Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure" as an integrated mode of ventilation on the Evita ventilator. This concept was introduced as a positive adjunct to weaning from ventilator support.
