 Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy is form of osteodystrophy, otherwise known as Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a. The disorder is characterized by a lack of responsiveness to parathyroid hormone, resulting in low serum calcium, high serum phosphate, and appropriately high serum parathyroid hormone. Individuals with Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy have short stature, characteristically shortened fourth and fifth metacarpals, rounded facies, and often mild mental retardation. Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy is commonly known as Pseudohypoparathyroidism because the kidney responds as if parathyroid hormone were absent. In fact, blood levels of parathyroid hormone are elevated in Pseudohypoparathyroidism due to the continued Hyperphosphatemia & Hypocalcemia. It is associated with epigenetic genetic imprinting. Because of this the disease can occur when a mother with mild clinical symptoms or a de novo mutation of the maternal allele passes it to her offspring. It is believed to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is associated with a Gs alpha subunit deficiency. The disorder bears the name of Fuller Albright, who characterized it in 1942. He was also responsible for characterizing McCune-Albright syndrome as well as a number of other bone disorders. He originally named it "Sebright Bantam syndrome", after the Sebright Bantam, which demonstrated an analogous hormone insensitivity. Much less commonly, the term "Martin-Albright syndrome" is used, after the first author of a 1940 paper in a Swiss medical journal that may have described a case.
