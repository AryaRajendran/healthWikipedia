The ONCC offers six options for certification: Certification is granted for four years, after which it must be renewed by taking a recertification test or by earning a certain number of continuing medical education credits. To become certified, nurses must have an RN license, meet specific eligibility criteria for nursing experience and specialty practice, and must pass a multiple-choice test. For the advanced AOCNP and AOCNS certifications, a nurse must have a master's degree or higher in nursing and a minimum of 500 hours of supervised clinical practice of oncology nursing.
