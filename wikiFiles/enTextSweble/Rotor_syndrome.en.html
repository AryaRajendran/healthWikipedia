 Rotor syndrome, also called Rotor type hyperbilirubinemia, is a rare, relatively benign autosomal recessive bilirubin disorder of unknown origin. It is a distinct disorder, yet similar to Dubin–Johnson syndrome — both diseases cause an increase in conjugated bilirubin. Rotor syndrome has many things in common with Dubin–Johnson syndrome, an exception being that the liver cells are not pigmented. The main symptom is a non-itching jaundice. There is a rise in bilirubin in the patient's serum, mainly of the conjugated type. It can be differentiated from Dubin–Johnson syndrome in the following ways: Rotor syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Rotor syndrome is named after the Filipino internist, Arturo Belleza Rotor (1907–1988).
