 Following is a list of instruments used in the practice of anesthesia: NON-KINK CATHTER MOUNT Catheter mounts are of great use in anaesthesia to add that’extra length’ to breathing system when needed. The Non-Kink catheter mount is a modification to the standard catheter mounts used in anaesthesia. Catheter mounts made of plane rubber tubing kink when bent, while those made of corrugated rubber tubing kinked when twisted. This causes a great deal of inconvenience during anaesthesia for neurosurgery and other operations performed on the head and neck. To overcome this difficulty, Dr.A.K Jamil (Anaesthetist,Manchester) designed the catheter mount which he named ;Non-kink catheter mount. He dismantled an ordinary catheter mount and discarded the rubber tube. A No.9 plain endotracheal tube was cut to the required length, covered with the armour of a flexible bath shower and connected to the distal and proximal pieces. The armour was then welded at both ends. The armour prevents kinking during flexion in different planes. The catheter mount may be twisted by about 180 without any change in performance. It has been tried in practice with satisfactory results. General anesthesia does not require the anesthetic machine, tested daily, as basic equipment. Anesthesia machines may differ in appearance, size and degree of sophistication but generally speaking, they consist of sections for: It is imperative that essential medical pipeline gas supply, e.g. oxygen, nitrous oxide and air, are secured firmly to the machine, and readily available without any obstructions, defects or pressure leaks. They should also be checked in between cases, ensuring that the breathing apparatus and breathing circuit are fully patent, for the safe anesthesia of patients. Major manufacturers of anesthetic machines are General Electric (GE), Larsen & Toubro Limited, Draeger and MAQUET.
