 Activities of daily living (ADLs) is a term used in healthcare to refer to daily self-care activities within an individual's place of residence, in outdoor environments, or both. Health professionals routinely refer to the ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regards to people with disabilities and the elderly. ADLs are defined as "the things we normally do...such as feeding ourselves, bathing, dressing, grooming, work, homemaking, and leisure." A number of national surveys collect data on the ADL status of the U.S. population. While basic categories of ADLs have been suggested, what specifically constitutes a particular ADL in a particular environment for a particular person may vary. Basic ADLs (BADLs) consist of self-care tasks, including: A useful mnemonic is DEATH: dressing, eating, ambulating, toileting, hygiene. Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are not necessary for fundamental functioning, but they let an individual live independently in a community: A useful mnemonic is SHAFT: shopping, housekeeping, accounting, food preparation/meds, telephone/transportation. Occupational therapists often evaluate IADLs when completing patient assessments. The American Occupational Therapy Association identifies 12 types of IADLs that may be performed as a co-occupation with others: There are several evaluation tools, such as the Katz ADL scale, the Lawton IADL scale. and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale. Most models of health care service use ADL evaluations in their practice, including the medical (or institutional) models, such as the Roper-Logan-Tierney model of nursing, and the resident-centered models, such as the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE).
