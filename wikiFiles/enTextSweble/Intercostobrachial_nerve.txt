 The intercostobrachial nerves are cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves. The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve does not divide, like the others, into an anterior and a posterior branch; it is named the intercostobrachial nerve. It pierces the Intercostalis externus and the Serratus anterior, crosses the axilla to the medial side of the arm, and joins with a filament from the medial brachial cutaneous nerve. It then pierces the fascia, and supplies the skin of the upper half of the medial and posterior part of the arm, communicating with the posterior brachial cutaneous branch of the radial nerve. It is often the source of referred cardiac pain. The intercostabrachial nerve is also sometimes divided in axialliary node clearance (ANC), such as that done for breast cancer surgery which requires the removal of the axilliary nodes. Sensation to the cutaneous region supplied by the nerve is affected. The size of the intercostobrachial nerve is in inverse relationship to that of the medial brachial cutaneous nerve. A second intercostobrachial nerve is frequently given off from the lateral cutaneous branch of the third intercostal; it supplies filaments to the axilla and medial side of the arm.
