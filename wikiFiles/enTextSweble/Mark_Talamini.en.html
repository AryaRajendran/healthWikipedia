 Mark A. Talamini, MD is professor and M. J. Orloff Family chair of the department of surgery at UC San Diego Medical Center, editor-in-chief of Surgical Endoscopy, the official journal of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and European Association for Endoscopic Surgery, and former president of SAGES. Talamini specializes in gastrointestinal surgery, with a particular emphasis on the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) and the use of minimally invasive technology to minimize pain and scarring. He is certified by the American Board of Surgery as well as the Critical Care Board. Talamini is the author of Advanced Therapy in Minimally Invasive Surgery, an in-depth exploration of new and emerging surgical practices. In 2008, Talamini's surgical team gained worldwide attention for pioneering natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), the practice of removing diseased organs through natural body openings. Part of the UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery, the team was the first in the United States to remove an appendix through the mouth. In partnership with Jacobs School of Engineering and Calit2, Talamini is pushing the limits of surgical technology by helping to develop a new surgical camera that boasts auto focus and optical zoom. Designed for NOTES, optical zoom will give surgeons the ability to change the field of view and some peripheral vision. The first prototype is called Surgicam. Prior to UC San Diego Medical Center, Talamini was director of minimally invasive surgery at The Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1992 to 2004, where he pioneered new minimally invasive surgical techniques for abdominal diseases. Talamini was one of the first surgeons at Johns Hopkins to use robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques for general abdominal procedures such as gallbladder removal and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux A highly respected surgeon, researcher, and teacher, Talamini is recognized as one of the leading authorities on laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery in the US. In his clinics and surgeries at UC San Diego Medical Center and Moores UCSD Cancer Center, he specializes in gastrointestinal surgery, with a particular emphasis on the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
