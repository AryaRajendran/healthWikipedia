 Forequarter amputation is amputation of the arm, scapula & clavicle. It is usually performed as a last resort to remove a cancer, but decreasingly so as limb-sparing operations improve. The rhomboid muscles, trapezius, levator scapulae and latissimus dorsi are transected. The neurovascular bundle consisting of the axillary artery, axillary vein and brachial plexus is ligated and cut. The area of the chest left exposed is then normally covered with a split-thickness skin graft. In 2008, Mr. David Nott, a British vascular surgeon in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with Médecins Sans Frontières performed a forequarter amputation to save the life of a 16-year-old boy, whose arm had been severed by an injury. It is unclear whether the arm was bitten off by a hippopotamus or destroyed by crossfire in the conflict. He was left with a gangrenous stump and had a few days to live. It made the news because his colleague, Professor Meirion Thomas, sent pointers via SMS text message. The text message included 10 steps to be followed and finished by saying, "Easy! Good luck."
