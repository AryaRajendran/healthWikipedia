 Radiography is the use of ionizing electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays to view objects. Although not technically radiographic techniques, imaging modalities such as PET and MRI are sometimes grouped in radiography because the radiology department of hospitals handle all forms of imaging. Treatment using radiation is known as radiotherapy. Radiography started in 1895 with the discovery of X-rays (later also called Röntgen rays after the man who first described their properties in rigorous detail), a type of electromagnetic radiation. Soon these found various applications, from helping to find shoes that fit, to the more lasting medical uses. X-rays were put to diagnostic use very early, before the dangers of ionising radiation were discovered. Initially, many groups of staff conducted radiography in hospitals, including physicists, photographers, doctors, nurses, and engineers. The medical speciality of radiology grew up around the new technology, and this lasted many years. When new diagnostic tests involving X-rays were developed, it was natural for the radiographers to be trained and adopt this new technology. This happened first with fluoroscopy, computed tomography (1960s), and mammography. Ultrasound (1970s) and magnetic resonance imaging (1980s) was added to the list of skills used by radiographers because they are also medical imaging, but these disciplines do not use ionising radiation or X-rays. Although a nonspecialist dictionary might define radiography quite narrowly as "taking X-ray images", this has only been part of the work of an "X-ray department", radiographers, and radiologists for a very long time. X-rays are also exploited by industrial radiographers in the field of nondestructive testing, where the newer technology of ultrasound is also used. Diagnostic radiography involves the use of both ionising radiation and non-ionising radiation to create images for medical diagnoses. The predominant test is still the X-ray (the word X-ray is often used for both the test and the actual film or digital image). X-rays are the second most commonly used medical tests, after laboratory tests. This application is known as diagnostic radiography. Since the body is made up of various substances with differing densities, X-rays can be used to reveal the internal structure of the body on film by highlighting these differences using attenuation, or the absorption of X-ray photons by the denser substances (like calcium-rich bones). Medical diagnostic radiography is undertaken by a specially trained professional called a diagnostic radiographer in the UK, or a radiologic technologist in the USA. There are several sub-specialities: For the main article see Projectional Radiography The creation of images by exposing an object to X-rays or other high-energy forms of electromagnetic radiation and capturing the resulting remnant beam (or "shadow") as a latent image is known as "projection radiography." The "shadow" may be converted to light using a fluorescent screen, which is then captured on photographic film, it may be captured by a phosphor screen to be "read" later by a laser (CR), or it may directly activate a matrix of solid-state detectors (DR—similar to a very large version of a CCD in a digital camera). Bone and some organs (such as lungs) especially lend themselves to projection radiography. It is a relatively low-cost investigation with a high diagnostic yield. Projection radiography uses X-rays in different amounts and strengths depending on what body part is being imaged: Other modalities are used in radiography when traditional projection X-ray cannot image what doctors want to see. Below are other modalities included within radiography; they are only summaries and more specific information can be viewed by going to their individual pages: Fluoroscopy is a term invented by Thomas Edison during his early X-ray studies. The name refers to the fluorescence he saw while looking at a glowing plate bombarded with X-rays. This is a technique that provides moving projection radiographs of lower quality. Fluoroscopy is mainly performed to view movement (of tissue or a contrast agent), or to guide a medical intervention, such as angioplasty, pacemaker insertion, or joint repair/replacement. The latter are often carried out in the operating theatre, using a portable fluoroscopy machine called a C-arm. It can move around the surgery table and make digital images for the surgeon. Biplanar Flouroscopy works the same as single plane flouroscopy except displaying two planes at same the time. This gives the advantage to work in two planes which is necessary for orthopedic and spinal surgery. The operation time is greatly reduced since no re-positioning is required. Angiography is the use of fluoroscopy to view the cardiovascular system. An iodine-based contrast is injected into the bloodstream and watched as it travels around. Since liquid blood and the vessels are not very dense, a contrast with high density (like the large iodine atoms) is used to view the vessels under X-ray. Angiography is used to find aneurysms, leaks, blockages (thromboses), new vessel growth, and placement of catheters and stents. Balloon angioplasty is often done with angiography. DEXA, or bone densitometry, is used primarily for osteoporosis tests. It is not projection radiography, as the X-rays are emitted in 2 narrow beams that are scanned across the patient, 90 degrees from each other. Usually the hip (head of the femur), lower back (lumbar spine) or heel (calcaneum) are imaged, and the bone density (amount of calcium) is determined and given a number (a T-score). It is not used for bone imaging, as the image quality is not good enough to make an accurate diagnostic image for fractures, inflammation etc. It can also be used to measure total body fat, though this isn't common. The radiation dose received from DEXA scans is very low, much lower than projection radiography examinations. Computed tomography or CT scan (previously known as CAT scan, the "A" standing for "axial") uses a high amount of ionizing radiation (in the form of X-rays) in conjunction with a computer to create images of both soft and hard tissues. These images look as though the patient was sliced like bread (thus, "tomography"-- "tomo" means "slice"). The machine looks similar to an MRI machine to many patients, but is not related. The exams are generally short, most lasting only as long as a breath-hold. Contrast agents are often used, depending on the tissues needing to be seen. Radiographers perform these examinations, sometimes in conjunction with a radiologist (for instance, when a radiologist performs a CT-guided biopsy). X-ray photons are formed in events involving electrons and are the mainly form of ionizing electromagnetic radiation used in medical radiography. This radiation is much more energetic than the more familiar types such as radio waves and visible light. Proper production and detection of photons are important in the creation of good radiograms. X-ray radiation for medical imaging is typically produced by X-ray tubes, which operate through bombarding the anode with high energy electrons emitted from a hot cathode. Image sharpness, contrast, and patient dosage are important considerations in medical radiography and these requirements determined the desired energies of the tube, the type of material used on the anode, and the method in which the power is generated to drive the tube. Although the technical definition of x-rays range from 1-700 keV, medical x-rays typically use 5-150 keV x-rays. The photons emitted come in discrete bands of energy corresponding to the material of the anode, and the undesired bands are removed. Choice of the anode and its emitted radiation energies depends on the application and the tissues being imaged, for instance molybdenum is often used in mammography because of its 20 keV x-rays. Too high radiation energies will result in poor pictures since the radiation cannot be readily attenuated, however too low energies will increase the radiation dosage of the patient without improvements in image quality. Sharpness of a radiographic image is strongly determined by the size of the x-ray source. This is determined by the area of the electron beam hitting the anode. A large photon source results in more blurring in the final image and is worsened by an increase in image formation distance. This blurring can be measured as a contribution to the modulation transfer function of the imaging system. The power used by the x-ray tube is generated by a specialized generator, which supplies the voltage and current required to drive the tube. The generator needs to supply high voltages with small exposure times. An exposure thus can be described by two factors: These variables can be controlled by the operator but are more typically assigned automatically by the x-ray machinery through sampling the emitted radiation. Power generators convert standard 120 or 220 volt AC to higher DC voltages and typically employ rectified and filtered multiphase transformers which maintain a constant voltage and can be turn rapidly on and off for millisecond exposures. Photons images that have been shadowed from an imaging subject must be detected at high fidelity and resolution to allow for diagnosis. There are three main types of image detection methods used namely: film/screens, image intensifiers, and digital detectors, with the latter fast becoming the standard for x-ray image detection. The ability of an x-ray detector to produce high-quality images is determined largely by the modulation transfer function (MTF) and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of the system. X-ray film is almost always used in conjunction with x-ray sensitive screen because high resolution film is quite poor at detecting x-rays. These screens contain rare earth minerals and phosphor materials that convert x-ray radiation to visible light or lows EM energies to which the film is sensitive. Screen generally have to have good contrast, dynamic range, and resolution, with the former two factors being competing properties. The resolution of the screen also affects the sensitivity of the detectors since more sensitive screens are generally thicker, which causes the more blurring because of spreading light. The film speed also play a factor in image quality. Higher speeds are more sensitive to photons but are generally lower in resolution and more susceptible to noise. Lower speed films produce images of good resolution and dynamic range but requires more photons for exposure and increases the radiation dosage of the subject. Image intensifiers are analog devices that readily convert the acquired x-ray image into one visible on a video screen. This device is made of a vacuum tube with a wide input surface coated on the inside with caesium iodide (CsI). When hit by x-rays material phosphors which causes the photocathode adjacent to it to emit electrons. These electron are then focus using electron lenses inside the intensifier to an output screen coated with phosphorescent materials. The image from the output can then be recorded via a camera and displayed. Digital devices known an array detectors are becoming more common in fluoroscopy. These devices are made of discrete pixelated detectors known as TFTs which can either work indirectly by using photo detectors that detect light emitted from a scintillator material such as CsI, or directly by capturing the electrons produced when the x-rays hit the detector. Direct detector do not tend to experience the blurring or spreading effect caused by phosphorescent scintillators of or film screens since the detectors are activated directly by x-ray photons. The term skiagrapher was used until about 1918 to mean radiographer. The word was derived from Ancient Greek words for 'shadow' and 'writer'.
