 Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive consumption of fluoride. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes pain and damage to bones and joints. Common causes of fluorosis include inhalation of fluoride dusts/fumes by workers in industry, use of coal as an indoor fuel source (a common practice in China), consumption of fluoride from drinking water (naturally occurring levels of fluoride in excess of the CDC recommended safe levels), and consumption of fluoride from the drinking of tea, particularly brick tea. Skeletal fluorosis can be caused by cryolite (Na3AlF6, sodium hexafluoroaluminate). In India, the most common cause of fluorosis is fluoride-laden water derived from deep bore wells. Over half of ground water sources in India have fluoride above recommended levels. In Tibet, excessive consumption of poor-quality pu-erh tea is reported to cause fluorosis. Fluorosis can also occur as a result of volcanic activity. The 1783 eruption of the Laki volcano in Iceland is estimated to have killed approximately 25% of the Icelandic population, and 50â€“80% of livestock, as a result of fluorosis and sulfur dioxide gases. The 1693 eruption of Hekla also led to fatalities of both people and livestock under similar conditions. The best way to view the mechanism of action by which fluorine breaks down bones and causes skeletal fluorosis is in a step-wise fashion. In some areas, skeletal fluorosis is endemic. While fluorosis is most severe and widespread in the two largest countries - India and China - UNICEF estimates that "fluorosis is endemic in at least 25 countries across the globe. The total number of people affected is not known, but a conservative estimate would number in the tens of millions." The World Health Organization recently estimated that 2.7 million people in China have the crippling form of skeletal fluorosis. In India, 20 states have been identified as endemic areas, with an estimated 60 million people at risk and 6 million people disabled; about 600,000 might develop a neurological disorder as a consequence. Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluorine concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Most patients suffering from skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluorine dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea. Fluorine can also damage the thyroid gland leading to hyperparatthyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. As a result, bone flexibility decreases making the bone more amenable to fractures. The histological changes which are induced through fluorine on rats resemble those of humans. That has been observed in an experiment with young and old rats. NaF was dissolved in their drinking water. Young rats have shown to be more susceptible to skeletal Fluorosis, because their bones react faster with the fluorine. Further aspects are major changes in teeth morphology, defects on dental enamel and abrasion of the incisors and porous compression of the upper and lower jaw. As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients. However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the fluorine existing in bone structures will deplete and be excreted via urine. However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients. Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing is aleatory.
