 The superior thyroid artery arises from the external carotid artery just below the level of the greater cornu of the hyoid bone and ends in the thyroid gland. From its origin under the anterior border of the Sternocleidomastoideus it runs upward and forward for a short distance in the carotid triangle, where it is covered by the skin, Platysma, and fascia; it then arches downward beneath the Omohyoideus, Sternohyoideus, and Sternothyreoideus. To its medial side are the Constrictor pharyngis inferior and the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. It distributes twigs to the adjacent muscles, and numerous branches to the thyroid gland, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the inferior thyroid arteries. The branches to the gland are generally two in number; Besides the arteries distributed to the muscles and to the thyroid gland, the branches of the superior thyroid are: This artery must be ligated at the thyroid when conducting a thyroidectomy. If the artery is severed, but not ligated, it will bleed profusely. In order to gain control of the bleeding the surgeon may need to extend the original incision laterally to gain access to its origin from the external carotid artery and ligate it there. A surgeon tells a medical student to tap the side of the face of a patient who just had thyroid surgery. The surgeon is most worried about damage to which of the following vessels? Answer: Superior and inferior thyroid arteries. Why? These vessels also supply the parathyroid glands. If disrupted during surgery, necrosis of the parathyroids occurs, with subsequent hypocalcaemia and tetany. The masseter is a good muscle to test for tetany.
