 The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid, or caBIG is an initiative of the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. The caGrid computer network and software support caBIG. caBIG is a voluntary virtual informatics infrastructure that connects data, research tools, scientists, and organizations to leverage their combined strengths and expertise in an open federated environment with widely accepted standards and shared tools. Driven primarily by scientific use cases from the cancer research community, caGrid provides the core enabling infrastructure necessary to compose the Grid of caBIG. It provides the technology that enables collaborating institutions to share information and analytical resources efficiently and securely, while also allowing investigators to easily contribute to and leverage the resources of a national-scale, multi-institutional environment. Though caGrid is a suite of products, typically caGrid refers to the core Infrastructure. caGrid uses version 4.03 of the Globus Toolkit, produced by the Globus Alliance. The caGrid Portal is a Web-based application built on Liferay Portal that enables users to discover and interact with the services that are available on the caGrid infrastructure. Portal serves as the primary visualization tool for the caGrid middleware, and provides a standards-based platform for hosting caBIG-related tools. It also serves as a caBIG information source. Through the caGrid Portal, users have instant access to information about caBIG participants, caGrid points of contact (POCs), and caGrid-related news and events. caGrid workflow uses: In March 2011, the NCI published an extensive review of CaBIG, the NCI CBIIT program that funded the caGrid software development (see 1, 2), which included a long list of problems with the program, and recommended that most of the software development projects should be discontinued.
