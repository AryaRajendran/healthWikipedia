 In anatomy, the splenic artery (in the past called the lienal artery) is the blood vessel that supplies oxygenated blood to the spleen. It branches from the celiac artery, and follows a course superior to the pancreas. The splenic artery gives off branches to the stomach and pancreas before reaching the spleen. Note that the branches of the splenic artery do not reach all the way to the lower part of the greater curvature of the stomach. Instead, that region is supplied by the right gastroepiploic artery, a branch of the gastroduodenal artery. The two gastroepiploic arteries anastomose with each other at that point. Along its course, it is accompanied by a similarly named vein, the splenic vein, which drains into the portal vein. Splenic artery aneurysms are rare, but still the third most common abdominal aneurysm (after aneurysms of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries). They may occur in pregnant women in the 3rd trimester and rupture carries a maternal mortality of greater than 50% and a fetal mortality of 70% - 90%. Risk factors include smoking and high blood pressure.
