 Dilatation and Curettage is a surgical procedure to remove tissues from the inside of a woman's uterus. It was, in former times, considered a type of abortion. In such cases, the baby is removed by use of a curette (looped, steel knife). The curette is inserted up through the cervix, into the uterus. The curette is then used to cut apart the baby and placenta. The remains of the baby and placenta are then scraped into a basin.
