 Astronauts are exposed to approximately 50-2,000 mSv (mili-Sievert) while on missions to the International Space Station (ISS), the moon and beyond. The risk of cancer caused by ionizing radiation is well documented at radiation doses beginning at 50 mSv and above. Related radiological effect studies have shown that survivors of the atomic bomb explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear reactor workers and patients who have undergone therapeutic radiation treatments have received low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation (x-rays and gamma rays) doses in the same 50-2000 mSv range. While in space, astronauts are exposed to protons, helium nuclei, and high-Z high energy ions (HZE ions), as well as secondary radiation from nuclear reactions from spacecraft parts or tissue. Space radiation is composed mostly of high-energy protons, helium nuclei, and HZE ions. The ionization patterns in molecules, cells, tissues and the resulting biological insults are distinct from typical terrestrial radiation (x-rays and gamma rays, which are low-LET radiation). GCRs (galactic cosmic rays) from outside of the Milky Way galaxy consist mostly of highly energetic protons with a small component of HZE ions. Prominent HZE ions: GCR (galactic cosmic ray) energy spectra peaks (with median energy peaks up to 1,000 MeV/amu) and nuclei (energies up to 10,000 MeV/amu) are important contributors to the dose equivalent. One of the main roadblocks to interplanetary travel is the risk of cancer caused by radiation exposure. The largest contributors to this roadblock are: (1) The large uncertainties associated with cancer risk estimates, (2) The unavailability of simple and effective countermeasures and (3) The inability to determine the effectiveness of countermeasures. Operational parameters that need to be optimized to help mitigate these risks include: Quantitative methods have been developed to propagate uncertainties that contribute to cancer risk estimates. The contribution of microgravity effects on space radiation has not yet been estimated, but it is expected to be small. The effects of changes in oxygen levels or in immune dysfunction on cancer risks are largely unknown and are of great concern during space flight. Studies are being conducted on populations accidentally exposed to radiation (Chernobyl, production sites as well as Hiroshima and Nagasaki). These studies show strong evidence for cancer morbidity as well as mortality risks at more than 12 tissue sites. The largest risks for adults who have been studied include several types of leukemia, including myeloid leukemia and acute lymphatic lymphoma as well as tumors of the lung, breast, stomach, colon, bladder and liver. Inter-gender variations are very likely due to the differences in the natural incidence of cancer in males and females. Another variable is the additional risk for cancer of the breast, ovaries and lungs in females. There is also evidence of a declining risk of cancer caused by radiation with increasing age, but the magnitude of this reduction above the age of 30 is uncertain. It is unknown whether high-LET radiation could cause the same types of tumors as low-LET radiation, but differences should be expected. The ratio of a dose of high-LET radiation to a dose of x-rays or gamma rays that produce the same biological effect are called relative biological effectiveness (BRE) factors. The types of tumors in humans who are exposed to space radiation will be different from those who are exposed to low-LET radiation. This is evidenced by a study that observed mice with neutrons and have RBEs that vary with the tissue type and strain. The various approaches to setting acceptable levels of radiation risk are summarized below: NCRP Report No. 153 (NCRP, 2006) provides a more recent review of cancer and other radiation risks. This report also identifies and describes the information needed to make radiation protection recommendations beyond LEO, contains a comprehensive summary of the current body of evidence for radiation-induced health risks and also makes recommendations on areas requiring future experimentation. Astronauts' radiation exposure limit is not to exceed 3% of the risk of exposure-induced death (REID) from fatal cancer over their career. It is NASA's policy to ensure a 95% confidence level (CL) that this limit is not exceeded. These limits are applicable to all missions in low Earth orbit (LEO) as well as lunar missions that are less than 180 days in duration. The relationship between radiation exposure and risk is both age- and gender-specific due to latency effects and differences in tissue types, sensitivities, and life spans between genders. These relationships are estimated using the methods that are recommended by the NCRP and more recent radiation epidemiology inormation The as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle is a legal requirement intended to ensure astronaut safety. An important function of ALARA is to ensure that astronauts do not approach radiation limits and that such limits are not considered as "tolerance values." ALARA is especially important for space missions in view of the large uncertainties in cancer and other risk projection models. Mission programs and terrestrial occupational procedures resulting in radiation exposures to astronauts are required to find cost-effective approaches to implement ALARA. The risk of cancer is calculated by using radiation dosimetry and physics methods. For the purpose of determining radiation exposure limits at NASA, the probability of fatal cancer is calculated as shown below: The cumulative cancer fatality risk (%REID) to an astronaut for occupational radiation exposures, N, is found by applying life-table methodologies that can be approximated at small values of %REID by summing over the tissue-weighted effective dose, Ei, as where R0 are the age- and gender- specific radiation mortality rates per unit dose. For organ dose calculations, NASA uses the model of Billings et al. to represent the self-shielding of the human body in a water-equivalent mass approximation. Consideration of the orientation of the human body relative to vehicle shielding should be made if it is known, especially for SPEs Confidence levels for career cancer risks are evaluated using methods that are specified by the NPRC in Report No. 126. These levels were modified to account for the uncertainty in quality factors and space dosimetry. The uncertainties that were considered in evaluating the 95% confidence levels are the uncertainties in: The so-called "unknown uncertainties" from the NCRP report No. 126 are ignored by NASA. The double- detriment life-table approach is what is recommended by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NPRC) to measure radiation cancer mortality risks. The age-specific mortality of a population is followed over its entire life span with competing risks from radiation and all other causes of death described. For a homogenous population receiving an effective dose E at age aE, the probability of dying in the age-interval from a to a+1 is described by the background mortality-rate for all causes of death, M(a), and the radiation cancer mortality rate, m(E,aE,a), as: The survival probability to age, a, following an exposure, E at age aE, is: The excessive lifetime risk (ELR - the increased probability that an exposed individual will die from cancer) is defined by the difference in the conditional survival probabilities for the exposed and the unexposed groups as: A minimum latency-time of 10 years is often used for low-LET radiation. Alternative assumptions should be considered for high-LET radiation. The REID (the lifetime risk that an individual in the population will die from cancer caused by radiation exposure) is defined by: Generally, the value of the REID exceeds the value of the ELR by 10-20%. The average loss of life-expectancy, LLE, in the population is defined by: The loss of life-expectancy among exposure-induced-deaths (LLE-REID) is defined by: The low-LET mortality rate per Sievert, mi is written where m0 is the baseline mortality rate per Sievert and xα are quantiles (random variables) whose values are sampled from associated probability distribution functions (PDFs), P(Xa). NPRC in Report No. 126 defines the following subjective PDFs, P(Xa), for each factor that contributes to the acute low-LET risk projection: The accuracy of galactic cosmic ray environmental models, transport codes and nuclear interaction cross sections allow NASA to predict space environments and organ exposure that may be encountered on long-duration space missions. The lack of knowledge of the biological effects of radiation exposure raise major questions about risk prediction. The cancer risk projection for space missions is found by where represents the folding of predictions of tissue-weighted LET spectra behind spacecraft shielding with the radiation mortality rate to form a rate for trial J. Alternatively, particle-specific energy spectra, Fj(E), for each ion, j, can be used The result of either of these equations is inserted into the expression for the REID. Related probability distribution functions (PDFs) are grouped together into a combined probability distribution function, Pcmb(x). These PDFs are related to the risk coefficient of the normal form (dosimetry, bias and statistical uncertainties). After a sufficient number of trials have been completed (approximately 105), the results for the REID estimated are binned and the median values and confidence intervals are found. The chi-squared (χ2) test is used for determining whether two separate PDFs are significantly different (denoted p1(Ri) and p2(Ri), respectively). Each p(Ri) follows a Poisson distribution with variance . The χ2 test for n-degrees of freedom characterizing the dispersion between the two distributions is The probability, P(ņχ2), that the two distributions are the same is calculated once χ2 is determined. Age- and gender-dependent mortality rare per unit dose, multiplied by the radiation quality factor and reduced by the DDREF is used for projecting lifetime cancer fatality risks. Acute gamma ray exposures are estimated. The additivity of effects of each component in a radiation field is also assumed. Rates are approximated using data gathered from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. There are two different models that are considered when transferring risk from Japanese to U.S. populations. The NCRP recommends a mixture model to be used that contains fractional contributions from both methods. The radiation mortality rate is defined as: Where: Identifying effective countermeasures that reduce the risk of biological damage is still a long term goal for space researchers. These countermeasures are probably not needed for extended duration lunar missions, but will be needed for other long-duration missions to Mars and beyond. There are three fundamental ways to reduce exposure to ionizing radiation: Since space radiation is omnidirectional, distance has no bearing in space. Also, since the duration of space missions will only increase, reducing the exposure time is not a feasible option. Shielding is a plausible option, but due to current launch mass restrictions, it is prohibitively costly. Also, the current uncertainties in risk projection prevent the actual benefit of shielding from being determined. Strategies such as drugs and dietary supplements to reduce the effects of radiation, as well as the selection of crew members are being evaluated as viable options for reducing exposure to radiation and effects of irradiation. Shielding is an effective protective measure for terrestrial radiation workers. In space, high-energy radiation is very penetrating and the effectiveness of radiation shielding depends on the atomic make-up of the material used. Antioxidants are effectively used to prevent the damage caused by radiation injury and oxygen poisoning (the formation of reactive oxygen species), but since antioxidants work by rescuing cells from a particular form of cell death (apoptosis), they may not protect against damaged cells that can initiate tumor growth. The evidence and updates to projection models for cancer risk from low-LET radiation are reviewed periodically by several prestigious bodies, which include the following organizations: These committees release new reports about every 10 years on cancer risks that are applicable to low-LET radiation exposures. Overall, the estimates of cancer risks among the different reports of these panels will agree within a factor of two or less. There is continued controversy for doses that are below 5 mSv, however, and for low dose-rate radiation because of debate over the linear no-threshold hypothesis that is often used in statistical analysis of these data. The BEIR VII report, which is the most recent of the major reports is used in the following sub-pages. Evidence for low-LET cancer effects must be augmented by information on protons, neutrons, and HZE nuclei that is only available in experimental models. Such data have been reviewed by NASA several times in the past and by the NCRP.
