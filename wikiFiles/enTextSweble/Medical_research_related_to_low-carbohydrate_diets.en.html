 Low-carbohydrate diets became a major weight loss and health maintenance trend during the late 1990s and early 2000s. While their popularity has waned recently from its peak, they remain popular. This diet trend has stirred major controversies in the medical and nutritional sciences communities and, as yet, there is not a general consensus on their efficacy or safety. As of 2008 the majority of the medical community remains generally opposed to these diets for long term health although there has been a recent softening of this opposition by some organizations. This article summarizes a sampling of the studies and other research that exist related to low carbohydrate diets, including the efficacy of such diets on weight loss and their effects on other health aspects such as ketosis. It is not a comprehensive list of all relevant research. For general information about low-carbohydrate diets see the main article. Because of the substantial controversy regarding low-carbohydrate diets, and even disagreements in interpreting the results of specific studies, it is difficult to objectively summarize the research in a way that reflects scientific consensus. Although there has been some research done throughout the twentieth century, most directly relevant scientific studies have occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s and, as such, are relatively new and the results are still debated in the medical community. Supporters and opponents of low-carbohydrate diets frequently cite many articles (some times the same articles) as supporting their positions. One of the fundamental criticisms of those who advocate the low-carbohydrate diets has been the lack of long-term studies evaluating their health risks. This has begun to change as longer term studies are emerging. The following is not a complete list of all relevant research but a selected list of articles demonstrating some of the breadth of scientific knowledge available on this subject. Lieb et al., 1926 conducted a case study of Dr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson, an anthropologist and explorer who lived with the Inuit eating a diet consisting almost entirely of meat, fish, and fat. A research team studied Stefansson's health looking for signs that his "unusual" diet had adversely affected his health. The team was unable to find any health problems in Stefansson and noted that the Inuit themselves also were quite healthy. Note that Dr. Stefansson's diet, like that of the Inuit, included substantial amounts of raw liver, an essential source of vitamin C for this diet. Tolstoi, 1929 performed a one-year study of two men who consumed a diet of exclusively meat. One of the subjects demonstrated a dramatic increase in cholesterol levels while the other actually lowered his cholesterol levels by the end of the study. All other health indicators were normal for both subjects. Note that because of the magnitude of the reported increase (and decrease following the test period) in the cholesterol levels, the measurement methodology has to be questioned by modern standards (i.e. the numbers may not directly correlate to modern cholesterol measurement techniques). Kekwick and Pawan, 1956 conducted a study of subjects consuming 1000-calorie diets, some 90% protein, some 90% fat, and some 90% carbohydrates. Those on the high fat diet lost the most, the high protein dieters lost somewhat less, and the high carbohydrate dieters actually gained weight on average. Kekwick and Pawan noted irregularities in their study (patients not fully complying with the parameters of the study). The validity of their conclusions has been questioned, and follow-up studies over a longer duration concluded that these temporary differences were due chiefly to changes in water balance A study conducted in 1965 at the Naval Hospital Oakland (Oakland, California) used a diet of 1000 calories per day, high in fat and limiting carbohydrates to 10Â grams (40 calories) daily. Over a ten-day period, subjects on this diet lost more body fat than did a group who fasted completely. Larosa, 1980 followed 24 patients for 12 weeks, 8 weeks on a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, studying their weight loss and cholesterol changes. The authors concluded the following. Despite weight loss the study found serious negative metabolic changes. Holt et al., 1997 performed a study of glucose and insulin responses for test subjects to a variety of foods, both high- and low-carbohydrate. The conclusions state the following. This study challenges the general assertion that only carbohydrates significantly impact insulin production. The authors describe their work as "preliminary" and so the results should be judged with caution. Anderson et al., 2000 performed computer simulations analyzing eight popular diet programs including Atkins and Protein Power. Their conclusions state the following. Note that this was not a study of human trials, only a theoretical computer analysis. Reddy et al., 2002 studied ten subjects consuming a low-carbohydrate high-protein (LCHP) diet over six weeks. The patients were found to have substantially increased calcium loss compared to their conventional diet among other negative health indicators. The authors conclude the following. Bowman et al., 2002 completed a survey study of 10,014 adults correlating carbohydrate intake to body mass index in addition to other measurements in the diet. The subjects surveyed had not necessarily been dieting per se. The authors concluded the following. The study found people on a high carbohydrate diet are more likely to be a healthy weight (have Body Mass Index values below 25.) Samaha et al., 2003 completed a study of 132 obese subjects comparing the efficacy of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets. The conclusions of the article state the following. Foster et al., 2003 performed a study with 63 obese subjects randomly assigned either to low-carbohydrate or conventional low-fat diets for one year. Their conclusion was the following. Foster's study claims to be the first truly randomized, controlled study of the efficacy and safety of low-carbohydrate diets. Bravata et al., 2003 conducted a literature search study of low-carbohydrate diet studies conducted between 1966 and 2003. The paper stated the following conclusion. The study determined that carbohydrate reduction did not significantly contribute more to weight loss than simply reducing calories. The article does state that Evangeliou et al., 2003 completed a 6-month study of 30 autistic children following a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet. The paper stated the following conclusions. The authors state clearly that the study was limited and the results are preliminary. Kossoff et al., 2003 conducted a small study of six epileptic patients studying the effects of the Atkins diet. The abstract states the following. In a 2004 Lancet article, Dr. Kossoff also stated that Greene et al. studied participants consuming one of three diet regimens over 12 weeks: a low-fat diet, a low-carbohydrate diet with the same number of calories, and a low-carbohydrate diet with 300 extra calories per day. The researchers found that the low fat group lost 17 pounds on average, the low carbohydrate group eating the same number of calories lost 23 pounds, and the low-carbohydrate group eating more calories lost 20 pounds. In commenting on their results Greene stated Two significant studies can be found in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2004. Yancy et al., 2004 completed a study of 120 overweight, high-lipid-count subjects comparing the efficacy of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets. The conclusions of the article state the following. Stern et al., 2004 conducted a one-year study of 132 obese adults. The conclusions state the following. Feinman and Fine, 2004 present an argument refuting the "calorie is a calorie" principle cited by some as an argument against the weight-loss benefits of low-carbohydrate diets. The "calorie is a calorie" argument, loosely speaking, states that the laws of thermodynamics imply that calories ingested from any source are burned at the same rate in the body (meaning that, for the purposes of weight loss, all sources of calories are the same). The paper refutes this (the argument is omitted here) stating the following in the conclusion. The authors' point is that while some have argued that there is no point in comparing the effectiveness of diets based on the sources of calories (proteins, fats, or carbohydrates), the second law of thermodynamics, specifically entropy, results in more calories from protein being burned during digestion than from ingesting either carbohydrates or fats. Romieu et al. 2004 completed a survey-based study of a selected group of 475 women against a control group of 1391 correlating diet and breast cancer rates. The study concluded the following. Astrup et al., 2004 completed a Rapid Review of published research regarding low-carbohydrate diets. The authors concluded the following. Although the authors question the merits of low-carbohydrate diets they nevertheless recommend longer-term studies to judge them more effectively. Mozaffarian et al. studied 235 postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease for 3 years. They monitored intake of fat and carbohydrate as well as progression of the narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). The authors conclude the following. An editorial in the same journal observed that these and other results seem to entirely contradict the prevailing theory that saturated fat causes heart disease. Ma et al., 2005 completed a one-year study of 572 healthy adults monitoring their diet and physical activity. The study concluded the following. This study refutes the suggestion that total carbohydrate consumption directly correlates with weight loss but does support the notion that the glycemic index of foods consumed correlates with weight loss. The study does not specifically distinguish between nutritive and non-nutritive carbohydrate consumption nor is it clear that any of the diets was ketogenic (a key factor for most low-carbohydrate diets). Yancy et al., 2005 completed a study of 28 overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes. The conclusion of the study was the following. The article lends support to the argument that low carbohydrate diets can be at least a partial remedy for some forms of diabetes (and may lend support to the argument that some forms of diabetes may in fact be caused by high carbohydrate diets). Halton et al., 2006 completed a study analyzing the long-term (20 years) health effects of low-carbohydrate diets. The study was limited to women and followed 82,802 subjects. Based on questionnaires, the study determined the correlation between the carbohydrate intake and coronary heart disease risk. The conclusion in the article states the following. Johnston et al., 2006 completed a study of 20 subjects over a 6-week period comparing ketogenic low-carbohydrate diets (i.e. very low carbohydrate) and non-ketogenic low-carbohydrate diets (i.e. moderate carbohydrate). The authors of the paper concluded the following. This study suggests that ketosis has no real benefit and is potentially harmful in a diet regimen. Bravi et al., 2006 completed a study of 2301 subjects, 767 with renal cell carcinoma (cancer of the kidneys), analyzing the effects of various types of foods on the risk of developing the cancer. The authors of the paper concluded the following. This, in effect, says that bread consumption was strongly correlated with increased risk of this carcinoma whereas the consumption of meats and vegetables decreased the risk. Nielsen et al., 2006 completed a study of type 2 diabetics randomly assigned to low-carbohydrate diets and conventional high-carbohydrate diets monitored over 22 months. All test subjects consumed the same amount of calories. Over the first 6 months the low-carbohydrate group was found to have significantly greater weight loss and glycemic control, after which many of the control (high-carbohydrate) group changed diets. The low-carbohydrate group was found to mostly maintain their weight loss and glycemic control through the 22 months of the study. The authors conclude Long-term study with participants of 22 944 healthy adults with aspect of cardiovascular and cancer mortality, concluded following: Gardner et al., 2007 studied 311 overweight women each following one of four diet plans (Atkins, Zone, LEARN, and Ornish) in 12-month trials. The authors concluded the following. Long-term study with participants of 42 237 women titled "Low carbohydrateâhigh protein diet and mortality in a cohort of Swedish women" concluded following: Kossoff et al., 2008 studied adult epileptic patients (as opposed to children used in other studies) following a modified Atkins diet for up to 6 months. The authors concluded the following. Shai et al., 2008 studied 322 moderately obese adults over a 2-year period assigning each to one of three diets: a low-fat, restricted-calorie diet (based on the 2000 AHA recommendations); a "Mediterranean", restricted-calorie diet; or a low-carbohydrate, non-restricted-calorie diet in which the participants were counseled to choose vegetarian sources of fat and protein and to avoid trans fat (based on the Atkins Diet, however ketosis was detected only 8.3% from participants). Adherence among the participants was high (84.6%). The low-carbohydrate group showed both the greatest weight loss and the most improvement in lipids (cholesterol). The Mediterranean group showed the greatest improvement in glycemic control (related to diabetes). They conclude Interestingly, this study was significant enough that the American Heart Association issued an immediate response to clarify its position (essentially saying that the low-fat diet used in the study is no longer recommended by the AHA and that the AHA's 2006 guidelines emphasize more fiber, vegetables, and "lean" meats). Additionally, a four-year follow-up study among 259 of the original 322 participants was performed. During the period after the study, participants had regained 2.7Â kg, 1.4Â kg, and 4.1Â kg of weight lost on the low-fat, Mediterranean, and low-carbohydrate diet, respectively. The total weight lost for the six-year period was 0.6Â kg, 3.1Â kg, and 1.7Â kg for the respective diets. However, the weight loss between the low-carbohydrate and Mediterranean diet was not statistically significant (P=0.22). Also, the low-carbohydrate diet was the only one to significantly improve the LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio (a reduction of 0.16, P=0.04). Research upon apolipoprotein E(-/-) mice suggest that diets low in carbohydrates and high in protein and fats might reduce vascular regenerative capacity and so increase atherogenesis and, through this, cardiovascular risk, even though this diet does not necessarily effect serum levels of lipids. The researchers noted "Although caution is warranted in extrapolating from such animal studies, these data at least raise concern that low carbohydrate high-protein diets could have adverse vascular effects not adequately reflected in serum risk markers." Study titled "Long-term Effects of a Very Low-Carbohydrate Diet and a Low-Fat Diet on Mood and Cognitive Function" concluded following: Long-term study titled "Mediterranean and carbohydrate-restricted diets and mortality among elderly men: a cohort study in Sweden" concluded following: Study measured all-cause mortality and specifically cardiovascular mortality. A four-year long study titled "Effects of Dietary Composition on Energy Expenditure During Weight-Loss Maintenance" was done at Boston Children's Hospital examining the effects of three dieting regimens on resting energy expenditure and total energy expenditure and other hormonal and metabolic markers. The study closely followed 21 overweight and obese males and females ages 10â40 years, and compared a very low carbohydrate diet (the Atkins diet) with a low fat, high carbohydrate diet, and a low glycemic index diet. Reduction of the resting metabolic rate as a result of dieting, a known factor in the failure of dieting, was the least in the very low carbohydrate diet. In addition, measured total energy expenditure in the patients was the highest in the very low carbohydrate diet, suggesting that a very low carbohydrate diet would be the most likely to produce a sustained weight loss. A possible negative side effect was that C-Reactive Protein levels, a marker for possible future cardiovascular disease, trended higher in the very low carbohydrate diet. A long term study involving 43,396 Swedish women followed up for an average of 15.7 years and analyzed the long term consequences of low carbohydrate-high protein diet. The study suggests that low carbohydrate-high protein diets, used on a regular basis and without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The relevance and bias of this study has been questioned, with particular concern about it's methodology, application to a LCHF diet (the conclusion was that a low-carb high-protein diet increased risks) and the degree to which the risks were increased (0.04%). Meta-analysis is a method to succinctly summarize and combine the results from multiple individual studies. The following meta-analyses of low carbohydrate diets are limited to randomized controlled trials that directly compare low carbohydrate diets to other diets. Some of the studies listed above are randomized controlled trials and are included in these meta-analyses. A recent meta-analysis that included randomized controlled trials (from January 1, 1980 to February 28, 2005) published after the Cochrane review found that "low-carbohydrate, non-energy-restricted diets appear to be at least as effective as low-fat, energy-restricted diets in inducing weight loss for up to 1 year. However, potential favorable changes in triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values should be weighed against potential unfavorable changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values when low-carbohydrate diets to induce weight loss are considered." A more recent meta-study of randomized controlled studies (from January 2000 to March 2007) that compared low-carbohydrate diets to low-fat/low-calorie diets found that measurements of weight, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride levels and systolic blood pressure were significantly better in groups that followed low-carbohydrate diets. The authors also found a higher rate of attrition in groups with low-fat diets. They conclude that "Evidence from this systematic review demonstrates that low-carbohydrate/high-protein diets are more effective at 6 months and are as effective, if not more, as low-fat diets in reducing weight and cardiovascular disease risk up to 1 year." They also call for more long-term studies. A 2012 systematic review studying the effects of low-carbohydrate diet on weight loss and cardiovascular risk factors showed the LCD to be associated with significant decreases in body weight, body mass index, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting blood sugar, blood insulin and plasma C-reactive protein, as well as an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and creatinine did not change significantly. The study found the LCD was shown to have favorable effects on body weight and major cardiovascular risk factors (but concluding the effects on long-term health are unknown). The study didn't compare health benefits of LCD to low-fat diets. A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2013 compared low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, vegan, vegetarian, low-glycemic index, high-fiber, and high-protein diets with control diets. The researchers concluded that low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, low-glycemic index, and high-protein diets are effective in improving markers of risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
