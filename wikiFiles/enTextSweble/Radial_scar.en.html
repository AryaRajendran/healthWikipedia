 In breast pathology, a radial scar of the breast, formally radial scar of the breast and also known as complex sclerosing lesion of the breast or simply complex sclerosing lesion, is a benign breast lesion that can radiologically mimic malignancy, i.e. cancer. It is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both breasts, not only within the breast it occurred. Radial scars are diagnosed by a microscopic examination of excised tissue, i.e. they are diagnosed by pathologists based on their histomorphology. Radial scars are spiculated masses characterized microscopically by a sclerotic appearing (i.e. scar like) center with peripheral entrapped normal breast ducts and lobules. Radial scars are often excised to exclude malignancy; however, observation following a core biopsy may also be considered.
