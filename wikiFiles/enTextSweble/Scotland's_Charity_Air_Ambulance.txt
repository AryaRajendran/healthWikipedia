 Scotland's Charity Air Ambulance is an organisation which will provide emergency medical services through the provision of a helicopter air ambulance covering the whole of Scotland, United Kingdom. The helicopter will be run by a registered charity, hoping to raise money from public and private donations in excess of Â£1.5 million every year. The air ambulance will work alongside and complement the state-funded aircraft that presently operate in Scotland. Scotland's Charity Air Ambulance is scheduled to commence operations in early 2013 and will comprise a Bolkow 105 airframe crewed by Scottish Ambulance Service paramedics. The aircraft is expected to be based at Perth Airport and tasking will be from the SAS ambulance control centre at Cardonald.
