 Xq28 is a chromosome band and genetic marker situated at the tip of the X chromosome which has been studied since at least 1980. The band contains three distinct regions, totaling about 8 Mb of genetic information. Xq28 contains the 12 genes of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family, of which MAGEA11 has been identified as a coregulator for the androgen receptor. Duplications of certain genes within Xq28, namely MECP2 and IRAK1, have been associated with phenotypes including anxiety and autism. The marker came to the public eye in 1993 when studies by Dean Hamer and others indicated a link between the Xq28 marker and male homosexuality, but the original study's results have been disputed. The 1993 study by Hamer examined 114 families of gay men in Italy and found increased rates of homosexuality among maternal uncles and cousins, but not among paternal relatives. Genetic linkage was studied in 40 of the families, in which there were two gay brothers. A correlation to Xq28 and other microsatellite markers was found in approximately 64% of the cases. A similar study by the same team conducted in 1995, again based on Italian material corroborated these results, but failed to find a link to the Xq28 gene among homosexual females. A further study of these results in 1999 disputed the results. Studying Canadian material consisting of 52 pairs of gay brothers, George Rice and others found no statistically significant linkage in alleles and haplotypes and concluded against an X-linked male homosexuality gene. When the disputing study was published in Science, Hamer responded by defending his original results and cited possible problems with how Rice's team selected their study subjects.
