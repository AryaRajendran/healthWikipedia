 In medicine, Meigs syndrome, also Meigs' syndrome, is the triad of ascites, pleural effusion and benign ovarian tumor (fibroma, Brenner tumour and occasionally granulosa cell tumour). It resolves after the resection of the tumor. Because the transdiaphragmatic lymphatic channels are larger in diameter on the right, the pleural effusion is classically on the right side. The etiologies of the ascites and pleural effusion are poorly understood. It may mimic other conditions. Because of the presence of ascites and transudative pleural effusions, the differential diagnosis includes liver failure (cirrhosis), congestive heart failure, renal diseases, and metastatic tumors to the peritoneal surfaces. These entities must be clinically excluded. Treatment of Meigs' syndrome consists of thoracentesis and paracentesis to drain off the excess fluid (transudate), and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or wedge resection to correct the underlying etiology. Meigs' Syndrome is named for Joe Vincent Meigs.
