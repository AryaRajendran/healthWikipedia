 Thomas Jeeves Horder, 1st Baron Horder, GCVO (7 January 1871 – 13 August 1955) was an English physician recognized as a leading clinician and diagnostician of his day. Thomas Jeeves Horder was born on 7 January 1871, the son of draper Albert Horder, in Shaftesbury, Dorset. Jeeves was his mother's maiden name. He was educated privately, and at the University of London and St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. Horder began his career at St Bartholomew's Hospital and, when still quite young, successfully made a difficult diagnosis on King Edward VII which made his reputation. His patients were to include every British monarch except Edward VIII from Edward VII to Elizabeth II. They also included two prime ministers, Ramsay MacDonald and Bonar Law and labour leader Hugh Gaitskell. He was involved in many official committees including advising the Ministry of Food during World War II. After the war he opposed many of Aneurin Bevan's plans for a national health service and may have helped get some of those less palatable to the medical profession modified. He also held the positions of Deputy Lieutenant County of Hampshire; Extra Physician to the Queen (formerly Extra Physician to King George VI); and Consulting Physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital (1912–1936). He was created Baron Horder on 23 January 1933. Horder served as president of the Cremation Society of Great Britain from 1940 to his death in 1955. In 1902 Horder married Geraldine Rose Doggett (died 1954), of Newnham Manor, Hertfordshire. Their son was the publisher Thomas Mervyn Horder, 2nd Baron Horder (died 1997). He lived for many years at Steep near Petersfield, Hampshire where he died on 13 August 1955.
