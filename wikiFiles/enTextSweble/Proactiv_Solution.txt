 Proactiv Solution is an over-the-counter topical treatment for mild to moderate forms of acne. The treatment is widely known for being marketed in Guthy-Renker infomercials since 1995 and for heavily featuring celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Justin Bieber and Adam Levine in their commercials. Like many acne treatments, the active ingredient is benzoyl peroxide, along with other ingredients such as moisturizers and exfoliants. In 1995, Dr. Kathy Fields and Dr. Katie Rodan of Rodan + Fields Dermatologists launched the Proactiv Solution skin-care line. Proactiv products are now available from vending machines. Proactiv Solution was created to treat mild to moderate cases of acne. However, it is not guaranteed that the user will ever see results. Like most antibacterials for treating acne, Proactiv Solution uses benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient. Reportedly, benzoyl peroxide may cause dryness and peeling of the skin; approximately 5 percent of the population is allergic to it. Reported reactions include redness, itching, hives, swelling and a burning sensation after topical application. Benzoyl peroxide may also cause increased sensitivity to sunlight and induce color-specific discoloration of clothes. For those who may be sensitive or allergic to it, Proactiv Solution has marketed the Gentle Formula kit, containing salicylic acid instead, although it is unclear whether or not salicylic acid can also cause these side effects.
