 Health problems have been a long standing issue limiting development in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). These health problems include HIV/Aids, Malaria, outbreaks of polio, cholera, typhoid, yellow fever, the Ebola virus, and hemorrhagic fever. Tuberculosis is an increasingly serious health concern in the DR Congo. Many insect-borne illnesses are present as well. Medical facilities are severely limited, and medical materials are in short supply. An adequate supply of prescription or over-the-counter drugs in local stores or pharmacies is also generally not available. Payment for any medical services is expected in cash in the DR Congo, in advance of treatment. HIV/Aids is the most serious health problem in the DR Congo due to the incurable nature of this disease. By the end of 2003, UNAIDS estimated that 1.1 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, for an overall adult HIV prevalence of 4.2%. Life expectancy in the DR Congo dropped 9% in the 1990s as a result of HIV/AIDS. According to UNAIDS, several factors fuel the spread of HIV in the DR Congo, including the movement of large numbers of refugees and soldiers, scarcity and high cost of safe blood transfusions in rural areas, a lack of counseling, few HIV testing sites, high levels of untreated sexually transmitted infections among sex workers and their clients, and low availability of condoms outside Kinshasa and one or two provincial capitals. With an eventual end of hostilities and a government in transition, population movements associated with increased stability and economic revitalization will exacerbate the spread of HIV, which is now localized in areas most directly affected by the presence of troops and war-displaced populations. Consecutive wars have made it nearly impossible to conduct effective and sustainable HIV/AIDS prevention activities. The consequence of this widespread illness in Africa is lower labor productivity caused by detrimental health conditions. Hence, there is a lack of healthy population to engage in production of goods and services, resulting in a slow economic growth. Therefore, the lack of education about HIV has allowed the further spread of this fatal illness which makes one so ill that he/she cannot participate in the labor market fully as an individual. The lack of full access to HIV knowledge sparks a vicious negative cycle that takes its form when those infected cannot engage in productive employment due to poor health, leading to chronic poverty, and being unable to gain access to knowledge about HIV. This cycle goes on and on, creating an increasing number of infections over time.
