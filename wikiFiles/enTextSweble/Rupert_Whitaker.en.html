 Dr Rupert Whitaker (born in 1963) is founder and Chairman of the Tuke Institute, an international think-tank that promotes standards in medicine and medical science. He was a founder of Terrence Higgins Trust a charity set up to provide direct services for people with HIV and to advocate on their behalf. Dr Whitaker has worked in the fields of medicine and community advocacy for almost 30 years as a clinician and scientist living with HIV and stroke; in this work, he has appeared as a subject in television documentaries and in the news-media internationally, including the Times (London), Sky News, Guardian newspaper, Independent newspaper, Herald Magazine, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5, Independent on Sunday, Daily Mirror, Radio Times, Channel 4, McNeil-Lehrer News Hour, BBC1 ("Panorama"), BBC ("Horizon"), and Granada TV. Born in 1963, the son of a publisher, Rupert Whitaker was educated at Lord Wandsworth College, Hampshire, from which he graduated at the age of 17 in 1980. He came out as gay at school in 1978. He took a gap year in Germany and, in 1981, he attended St. Hild and St. Bede College, Durham University to study philosophy and psychology. While he was there, his partner Terry Higgins died from AIDS, one of the first people to do so in the country. Rupert Whitaker became ill himself and transferred to the University of London. He was not expected to live longer than a year. When he was 19, in 1982, Rupert Whitaker began to raise awareness and funds after the death of his partner Terry Higgins with a group of Terry’s friends to address what was then called Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (GRID). He took part in a conference on the problem of ‘GRID’, organised by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Lesbian_and_Gay_Switchboard|Gay Switchboard, London] which marked a turning point in the development of the Trust. Rupert Whitaker was the only member of the original group to continue the work of developing the Terrence Higgins Trust through its registration as a charity, working to establish the educational, mental health, and buddying services, and speaking to media. Terrence Higgins Trust was the first European HIV charity to be founded and is currently one of the leading HIV charities in Europe. Following the completion of an undergraduate degree in 1984, Rupert Whitaker was awarded a University fellowship to the University of Toronto to train in psychiatry and biobehavioural science of HIV. He undertook a further eleven years of university education and training in Canada and the USA. In 1984, he was named a University Scholar at Boston University for five years in the nationally prestigious University Professors Program and was later awarded a national American fellowship in psychiatric public health. Unable to afford graduate study in the UK, these awards paid for his doctoral studies in the USA. He received his doctoral qualifications in psychiatry, neurology, and immunology with a 100% grade point average. This was followed by three post-doctoral Fellowships in immunology and psychiatry at Tufts New England Medical School, University of Michigan Medical School, and the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine. Continuing his work in social justice around health during his studies, Dr Whitaker led the international response to anti-HIV immigration and travel laws, based on his published research in public health with Richard Edwards, and prompted the International AIDS Society to boycott the USA as the location of any future IAS conferences until the laws were changed. They were finally lifted in 2009 and the next IAS conference was held in Washington, DC. Following his third post-doctoral fellowship, Rupert Whitaker was diagnosed with AIDS at the age of 30. Shortly afterwards, he also suffered a stroke, which left him with visual, communication, cognitive, and mobility problems. The stroke required brain surgery, which left him with epilepsy. This was followed by a number of years of intensive rehabilitation, although he continued to publish HIV-related research As a consequence of this two-year experience, in 2007 he founded the Tuke Institute, an independent think-tank of international scientists, clinicians, and other professionals. It promotes standards and methods in the practice of health services and science with the primary focus on how best to help ill people get well and stay well. Primary methods include promoting the measurement of health outcomes from the patient’s perspective, measuring the effectiveness of individual service's performance, and promoting public participation in the delivery, audit, and governance of services. It promotes a biopsychosocial framework for treatment with integrated and nurse-led services. The Tuke Institute also provides training internships for graduate students wishing to gain practical experience in the translation of health science into policy. Dr. Whitaker has been an Expert Adviser to the Department of Health and a member of numerous committees for specialised commissioning and expert advice on health service delivery. He has published and presented over 50 academic and policy papers in the fields of psychiatry, immunology, neurology, and public health, and has had senior Honorary Fellowships at various universities. He acts as a forensic expert for the courts, with cases in the UK, Iran, Australia, and Poland, but his work over 30 years in HIV, disability, and social justice has been unpaid. In 2004, Rupert Whitaker was awarded a Police Commendation for bravery in the apprehension of an armed and violent robber.
