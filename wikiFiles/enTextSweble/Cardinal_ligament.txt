 The cardinal ligament (or Mackenrodt's ligament, lateral cervical ligament, or transverse cervical ligament) is a major ligament of the uterus. It is located at the base of the broad ligament of the uterus. Importantly, it contains the uterine artery and uterine vein. There is a pair of cardinal ligaments in the female human body. It attaches the cervix to the lateral pelvic wall by its attachment to the Obturator fascia of the Obturator internus muscle, and is continuous externally with the fibrous tissue that surrounds the pelvic blood vessels. It thus provides support to the uterus. It may be of clinical significance in hysterectomy, due to its close proximity to the ureters, which can get damaged during ligation of the ligament.
