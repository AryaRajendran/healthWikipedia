 Amniotic stem cells are multipotent stem cells of mesenchymal origin extracted from amniotic fluid. Amniotic stem cells are able to differentiate into various tissue type such as skin, cartilage, cardiac tissue, nerves, muscle, and bone, and may have potential future medical applications. All over the world, universities and research institutes are studying amniotic fluid to discover all the qualities of amniotic stem cells, and scientists such as Shinya Yamanaka and Pascale Guillot have discovered important results. Amniotic fluid stem cells are harvested without destroying embryos, although amniocentesis does carry a small procedure-related excess risk of pregnancy loss (estimated at 0.06%). The use of amniotic fluid stem cells should therefore be somewhat less controversial to religious organizations objecting to the use of embryos. Thanks to recent studies, supported in part in England at the Imperial College London, it is possible to bank stem cells derived from amniotic fluid in private stem cells banks 1. In 2009, the first US amniotic stem cell bank was opened in Medford, MA, by Biocell Center, an international company specializing in the cryopreservation and private banking of amniotic fluid stem cells.
