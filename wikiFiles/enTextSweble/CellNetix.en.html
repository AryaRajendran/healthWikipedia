 CellNetix Pathology & Laboratories, LLC, headquartered in Seattle, Washington, is the largest anatomic pathology provider in the Pacific Northwest, with 50 physicians and more than 270 total staff. Services include cytology, histology, fine needle aspiration (FNA) services, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, UroVysion™, and molecular diagnostics. CellNetix uses a subspecialized case allocation process in which specimens arrive in the pathology laboratory and staff allocate them by subspecialty: breast cases to breast pathologists, gastroenterology (GI) cases to GI pathologists, genitourinary cases (GU) cases to GU pathologists, etc. In a typical case allocation process in a non-specialized pathology practice, cases are manually allocated to pathologists based on workload, without regard to the type of case. Tests are interpreted by board-certified pathologists who have experience in breast core biopsies, GI biopsies, Pap tests, and prostate biopsies. CellNetix is expanding the utilization of molecular biology to identify the root cause of abnormalities within the genetic material of the cell itself. The CellNetix molecular pathology department tests for breast, gastric, colon and lung cancers, as well as melanoma. A women’s health subspecialty provides high-risk HPV testing, testing for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), as well as vaginosis/vaginitis testing. CellNetix institutes pollution prevention planning and receives technical assistance from Washington State Department of Ecology. In addition to conducting on-site recycling of xylene, ethanol, formalin, and solvent, CellNetix treats those chemicals which cannot be eliminated before they enter the waste stream. For example, in the case of the potent mutagen Diaminobenzidine, CellNetix is able to render the mutagenic properties of the chemical inert, making the waste much less hazardous. CellNetix uses a specimen tracking system in which each specimen is labeled with a bar code and scanned up to 15 times during transit—from pickup at the hospital or clinic, to arrival at the lab, to final report. Early in 2012, the company invested in whole-slide imaging which views a live capture of the slide on a microscope. This is done using an ultra-high resolution scanner to image the complete slides and store them digitally. CellNetix is a physician- and employee-owned partnership formed in 2005 by the merger of three independent pathology groups—Black Hills Pathology (Olympia), Associated Pathology (Everett) and Washington Pathology Consultants (Seattle), with the addition of Northwest Pathology Group in 2008. In 2007, CellNetix opened a 48,000-square-foot pathology and laboratory facility in downtown Seattle, where most of the testing is conducted. CellNetix provides diagnostic services for nine hospitals across western Washington as well as physicians and patients in Washington and Alaska. On December 4, 2012, Spokane, Wash.-based PAML (Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories) and CellNetix signed a letter of intent in which PAML agreed to purchase a minority ownership interest in CellNetix, LLC. As part of this partnership, CellNetix and PAML will form a jointly owned molecular pathology esoteric testing division. PAML employs approximately 1,400 staff and is 75% owned by Providence Health & Services and 25% by CHI (Catholic Health Initiative). By agreement, PAML and CellNetix will have a seat on each other’s boards.
