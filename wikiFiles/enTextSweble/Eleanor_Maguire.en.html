 Eleanor A. Maguire FMedSci is an Irish neuroscientist who works in London, UK. She undertook her PhD at University College Dublin, Ireland, where she first became interested in the neural basis of memory while working with patients as a neuropsychologist. She is a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow and Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London, UK, where she is also the Deputy Head. Maguire heads the Memory and Space research laboratory at the Centre. In addition, she is an honorary member of the Department of Neuropsychology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London. Maguire and others have noted that a distributed set of brain regions supports human episodic (autobiographical) memory, defined as the memory for personal everyday events, and that this brain network overlaps considerably with that supporting navigation in large-scale space and other diverse cognitive functions such as imagination and thinking about the future. In her research Maguire seeks to place episodic memory in the context of wider cognition so as to understand how common brain areas, and possibly common processes, support such disparate functions. In this way she hopes to gain novel and fundamental insights into the mechanisms that are involved. Her team uses standard whole brain and high resolution structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with behavioural testing and neuropsychological examination of amnesic patients in order to pursue their aims. They mainly employ ecologically valid or 'real life' experimental paradigms to examine brain-behaviour relationships; examples include using virtual reality to examine navigation , investigating autobiographical memories of people’s personal past experiences, and their ability to imagine fictitious and future scenes and events. Perhaps the most famous of these is her series of studies on London taxi drivers , where she documented changes in hippocampal structure associated with acquiring the knowledge of London’s layout. This work on hippocampal plasticity not only interested scientists, but also engaged the public and media world-wide. This is also true of her other work such as that showing that patients with amnesia cannot imagine the future which several years ago was rated as one of the scientific breakthroughs of the year ; and her other studies demonstrating that it is possible to decode people’s memories from the pattern of fMRI activity in the hippocampus. Maguire’s interest is mainly focused on the hippocampus, a brain structure known to be crucial for learning and memory, whilst also exploring the roles of the parahippocampal cortex, the retrosplenial cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Besides her direct scientific activities, Maguire and her research group have an active public engagement agenda, involving public lectures, school visits and demonstrations, TV, radio and internet contributions, and collaborations with several artists, encouraging people of all ages to think about the value of science in their everyday lives. Maguire has won a number of prizes for outstanding contributions to science, including: the Ig Nobel Prize for Medicine - awarded for research promoting the public awareness and understanding of science, the Cognitive Neuroscience Society Young Investigator Award , two Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowships , the Royal Society Rosalind Franklin Award , The Feldberg Foundation Prize , and The Kemali Prize. She was also named as one of ‘Twenty Europeans who have changed our lives’ when The European Union launched a new science and innovation initiative several years ago. She is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences.
