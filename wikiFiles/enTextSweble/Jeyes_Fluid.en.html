From 1877 to December 31st 1887, 241 cases of scarlet fever were treated by the medical officers at the sanatorium without a death." Since 1877 Dr. Woodman's patients were given frequent warm baths with some Jeyes' Fluid added. This proved significant in the treatment of scarlet fever and the prevention of dropsy, which usually followed. For the first time in its 130 years, Jeyes Fluid appeared on television screens with a Â£500,000 advertising campaign that was aired in the UK over the Easter bank holiday in 2011. This campaign was to widen the appeal of the brand, remind consumers of its versatility, and introduce the product to a new generation. The product is pronounced as "Jays" Fluid. It has a pH from 8.0 to 10.0.
