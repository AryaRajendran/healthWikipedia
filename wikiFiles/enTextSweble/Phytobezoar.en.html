 A phytobezoar is a type of bezoar, or trapped mass in the stomach, that consists of components of indigestible plant material, such as fibres, skins and seeds. While phytobezoars may be discovered incidentally on barium x-ray or endoscopic testing of the stomach, individuals with phytobezoars may develop symptoms: nausea, vomiting, gastric outlet obstruction, perforation, abdominal pain, and bleeding have been reported. Conditions that lead to decreased motility in the stomach (gastroparesis) and surgeries on the stomach (such as vagotomy or gastric bypass) are associated with the development of phytobezoars. A specific type of phytobezoar, termed a diospyrobezoar, is associated with ingestion of unripe persimmons, which contain a soluble tannin called shibuol that polymerizes into a coagulative cellulose-protein compound in the acid environment of the stomach, to form the bezoar. In addition to their presence in human stomachs, phytobezoars have been documented in the stomachs of slaughtered plant-eating animals. Several treatments for phytobezoars have been described. Endoscopy involves using a fibre-optic flexible camera to identify the phytobezoar, that can be evacuated from the stomach using various assisted devices (such as Roth baskets, snares, or Dormia baskets). If the phytobezoar cannot be removed due to size, electrohydraulic lithotripsy, mechanical lithotripsy, snares, or therapy may be used to fragment the mass. Papain (meat tenderizer) and cellulase enzymes have been used to help reduce the size of phytobezoars. Coca-Cola ingestion has been found to be particularly useful to decrease the size of diospyrobezoars. When all other measures have failed, surgical gastrotomy is required to evacuate the bezoar.
