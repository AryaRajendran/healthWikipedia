 An imperforate anus or anorectal malformations (ARMs) are birth defects in which the rectum is malformed. ARMs are a spectrum of different congenital anomalies in males and females, that varies from fairly minor lesions, as well as complex anomalies. The cause of ARMs is unknown, the genetic basis of these anomalies is very complex because of their anatomical variability, in an 8% of patients genetic factors are clearly associated with ARMs. Anorectal Malformation in Currarino Syndrome represent the only association for which the gene HLXB9 has been identified. There are several forms of imperforate anus and anorectal malformations.The new classification is in relation of the type of associated fistula. The classical classification was in low,and high anomalies: Imperforate anus is usually present along with other birth defectsâ€”spinal problems, heart problems, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies are among the possibilities. Imperforate anus is associated with an increased incidence of some other specific anomalies as well, together being called the VACTERL association: When an infant is born with an anorectal malformation, it is usually detected quickly as it is a very obvious defect. Doctors will then determine the type of birth defect the child was born with and whether or not there are any associated malformations. It is important to determine the presence of any associated defects during the newborn period in order to treat them early and avoid further sequelae. There are two main categories of anorectal malformations: those that require a protective colostomy and those that do not. The decision to open a colostomy is usually taken within the first 24 hours of birth. Sonography can be used to determine the type of imperforate anus. Imperforate anus usually requires immediate surgery to open a passage for feces unless a fistula can be relied on until corrective surgery takes place. Depending on the severity of the imperforate, it is treated either with a perineal anoplasty or with a colostomy. With a high lesion, many children have problems controlling bowel function and most also become constipated. With a low lesion, children generally have good bowel control, but they may still become constipated. For children who have a poor outcome for continence and constipation from the initial surgery, further surgery to better establish the angle between the anus and the rectum may improve continence and, for those with a large rectum, surgery to remove that dilated segment may significantly improve the bowel control for the patient. An antegrade enema mechanism can be established by joining the appendix to the skin (Malone stoma); however, establishing more normal anatomy is the priority. Imperforate anus has an estimated incidence of 1 in 5000 births. It affects boys and girls with similar frequency. However, imperforate anus will present as the low version 90% of the time in females and 50% of the time in males. Imperforate anus is an occasional complication of sacrococcygeal teratoma.
