 Graphomania (from Greek γραφειν — writing, and μανία — insanity), also known as scribomania, refers to an obsessive impulse to write. When used in a specifically psychiatric context, it labels a morbid mental condition which results in writing rambling and confused statements, often degenerating in a meaningless succession words or even nonsense and called then graphorrhea. The term 'graphomania' has been used in early 19th century by Esquirol and later by Eugen Bleuler, becoming more or less usual Graphomania is near condition to typomania - obsessiveness with seeing one's name in publication or with writing for being published, excessive symbolism or typology. Outside the psychiatric definitions of graphomania and related conditions, the word is used more broadly to label the urge and need to write excessively, whether professional or not. Max Nordau, in his attack to what he saw as degenerate art, frequently used the term 'graphomania' to label the production of the artists he condemned (most notably Richard Wagner or the French symbolist poets ) According to Kundera, graphomania is the groundless claim, sometimes being large-scale, of being a writer: Kundera's feeling about graphomania may be explained by the fact that such a pejorative meaning of graphomania is actually often used in Post-Soviet block to denote foolish, unprofessional and excessive writings (not only in the form of literature, but also science), while logorrhea as a noun (with its negative, pejorative meaning) is not as often used. The word "logophiliac" is used in a similar disparaging fashion by cognoscenti in the US. "Graphomania" is also used as part of the name of several surrealist methods, including entopic graphomania.
