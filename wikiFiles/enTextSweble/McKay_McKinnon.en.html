 McKay McKinnon is an American physician specializing in plastic surgery. He works at Saint Joseph Hospital in Chicago, Illinois and also at Childrenâ€™s Memorial Hospital and the University of Chicago Medical Center. He graduated medical school at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and completed his residency at the University of Miami. In 2000, McKinnon treated a woman with a large tumor disorder in Michigan. He successfully removed a 200-pound tumor in an 18-hour operation that drew worldwide attention, according to USA Today. In 2004, McKinnon offered his services and traveled on a special mission to Romania. Along with 12 other doctors, he performed a 10-hour operation and removed an 80-pound tumor from a 47-year-old woman that suffers from a genetic disorder causing tumors to grow on her body, according to BBC news. He has led a mission to Choluteca, Honduras where he performs cleft lip and palate surgery. Over the years, more than 500 children have received treatment at no cost. McKinnon was asked to lead the service and says the children are grateful to be given the health treatment. In January 2012, in a 12 hour operation a team led by McKinnon removed a 198-pound (90kg) non-cancerous tumor which was growing on the right leg of the patient, Nguyen Duy Hai, in Vietnam. McKinnon waived his fee and other costs were funded through donations. In October 2012, McKinnon was featured in the television program My Giant Face Tumor on the TLC Network. In the program, he successfully removed large facial tumors from two patients, one in Ohio and the other in Thailand, who suffer from neurofibromatosis.
