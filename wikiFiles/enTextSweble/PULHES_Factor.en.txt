 PULHES is a United States military acronym used in the Military Physical Profile Serial System. It is used to qualify an enlistee's physical profile for each military skill. Each letter in the acronym (see box below) is paired with a number from 1 to 4 to designate the soldier's or airman's physical capacity. For instance, the MOS 19D Cavalry Scout requires a physical profile of 111121 or better, indicating that he may wear glasses (a "2" in the E category) but is otherwise without medical, physical, or psychiatric limitations. Four numerical designations are used to reflect different levels of functional capacity. The basic purpose of the physical profile serial is to provide an index to overall functional capacity. Therefore, the functional capacity of a particular organ or system of the body, rather than the defect per se, is evaluated in determining the numerical designation 1, 2, 3, or 4. For example, if a military job requires a physical profile of "123123," that means, in order to qualify for that job, a person would have a medical rating a "1" in the area of "Physical capacity or stamina," a medical rating of "2" or better in the area of "Upper extremities," have a medical rating of "3" or better in the area of "Lower extremities," a rating of "1" in the area of "Hearing and Ears," etc. As for the numerical designators, they generally mean a military medical evaluation of: 'This is an abridged excerpt from Air Force Instruction 48-123 Medical Examinations and Standards "Table 1.1.
