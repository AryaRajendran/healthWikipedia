 Coryza is a word describing the symptoms of a "cold". It describes the inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity which usually gives rise to the symptoms of nasal congestion and loss of smell, among other symptoms. Coryza may not always have an infectious or allergenic etiology and can be due to something as innocuous as a cold wind, spicy food or tender points in the muscles of the neck such as the sternocleidomastoid. It is also a symptom of narcotic withdrawal. Coryza is classically used in association with the "four Cs" of measles infection: cough, conjunctivitis, Koplik's spots, and coryza. This word may have its roots in the Greek Koryza, which is likely to be compounded from "kara" and "zeein". which are the noun for head and the verb, to boil. Coryza would therefore be a boiling over of the head. According to another source, coryza was an ancient Greek word denoting a fool. According to physician Andrew Wylie, "we use the term for a cold in the head, but the two are really synonymous. The ancient Romans advised their patients to clean their nostrils and thereby sharpen their wits." Treatment of coryza depends on etiology. Coryza from any allergic causes usually gets relieved if contact with the allergen (dust, pollen, cold wind,etc.) is avoided. Nasal sprays, antihistamines, decongestants are beneficial. However, if it is due to any virus it usually take 3â€“7 days to improve. Symptomatic treatment can be obtained from saline nasal irrigation, nasal sprays, decongestants. But antihistamines are of little value. If in the rare event coryza is due to bacterial or fungal infections, then appropriate antimicrobial therapy may be required in addition to the symptomatic treatment. Notes on Infectious Coryza
