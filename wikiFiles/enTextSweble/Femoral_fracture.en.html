 A femoral fracture is a bone fracture that involves the femur. It includes hip fractures. A femoral fracture that involves the femoral head, femoral neck or the shaft of the femur immediately below the lesser trochanter may be classified as a hip fracture, especially when associated with osteoporosis. â€¢ Three types of femoral shaft fractures Type 1: Spiral or transverse Type 2: Comminuted Type 3: Open Femoral shaft fractures can be classified with the Winquist and Hansen classification, which is based on the amount of comminution: Treatment depends on the part of the femur that is fractured. Traction may be useful for femoral shaft fractures but is contraindicated in femoral neck fractures.
