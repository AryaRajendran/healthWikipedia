 Incest between twins is a subclass of sibling incest and includes both heterosexual and homosexual relationships. While in modern Western European culture, such behaviour is considered taboo and is quite rare, incest between twins is a common feature in Indo-European, Indonesian and Oceanian mythology, and there are a few societies in which the prohibition on it is limited or it is partially accepted. An old Japanese myth says that if two star-crossed lovers commit dual suicide, they get reincarnated as twins. A few anime, manga, light novels or erotic dating simulators feature incest between twins as a subject.
