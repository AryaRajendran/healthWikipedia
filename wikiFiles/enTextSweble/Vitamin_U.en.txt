 Vitamin U is a tentative designation given by Garnett Cheney for antipeptic ulcer factors in cabbage juice that he found to cure peptic ulcers in eleven days versus thirty-seven days for placebo. It has since been identified as S-methylmethionine (SMM). Other research points to fibre preventing ulcers. Glucosinolate is a group of molecules in the Brassicaceae family with gastro- and hepato-protective action. Indoles and iso-thio-cyanates dominate effects of Brassicaceae in this article, because they are products of glucosinolate decomposition. Without myrosinase, bacteria in the rat cecum can hydrolyse glucoraphanin into raphanin. Allyl-iso-thio-cyanate (AITC) increases food transit time in rat colons. Sulforaphane enhances protection and repair of gastric mucosa in vitro. While Brassicaceae is a large genus of plants containing hepato-protective agents, it does not contain a monopoly on them. I3C promotes cancer cell death with many molecular targets. Broccoli sprouts are rich enough in glucoraphanin for experimental results against aflatoxin, a carcinogen. Ulyasov and others found positive results in leukemia with DIM, Glucobrassicin being a precursor of DIM through indole-3-carbinol. Iso-thio-cyanates are an important factor in the action of Wasabi against Helicobacter Pylori, and ITC is not a molecule, but a functional group on many different molecules, Sinigrin being a notable precursor of allyl-ITC, and AITC being a larger part of Wasabi than of most other Brassicaceae. Sulforaphane demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects on Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosae in mice and human subjects. Brassica species probably cause baby colic in breast-feeding.
