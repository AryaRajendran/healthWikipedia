 Orthostatic hypertension or postural hypertension is a medical condition consisting of a sudden increase in blood pressure when a person stands up. Orthostatic hypertension is diagnosed by a rise in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more when standing. Orthostatic diastolic hypertension is a condition in which the diastolic raises to 98 mmHg or over in response to standing; however, this definition currently lacks clear medical consensus, and is thus subject to change. Orthostatic hypertension involving the systolic is known as systolic orthostatic hypertension. Orthostatic hypertension if affecting an individual's ability to remain upright, is viewed as a form of orthostatic intolerance. The body's inability to regulate the blood pressure can be a type of dysautonomia. Baroreflex and autonomic pathways normally ensure that blood pressure is maintained despite various stimuli including postural change. The precise mechanism of orthostatic hypertension though remains unclear but it is thought that alpha-adrenergic activity may be the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism of orthostatic hypertension in elderly hypertensive patients. Other mechanisms are proposed for other different groups of individuals with this disorder. A prevalence of 1.1% was found in a large population study. The risk of orthostatic hypertension has been found to increase with age, with it being found in 16.3% of older, hypertensive patients. Dr. David H.P. Streeten is the discoverer of orthostatic hypertension. There is not any official recommended treatments currently for orthostatic hypertension as the condition is still little known and can be due to different causes, hence treatment for those with this disorder is still trial and error experimental treatment. Some treatments which have been successfully used for this condition are medications doxazosin, carvedilol, captopril, and propranolol hydrochloride. Treatment of coexisting conditions e.g. hypovolemia. Some specialists in severe cases give saline IVs for the hypovolemia which then if that is the cause, brings the orthostatic hypertension down to a safe level. Pressure garments over the pelvis and the lower extremeties may be used as part of treatment, due to the blood pooling issue happening in many with the disorder.
