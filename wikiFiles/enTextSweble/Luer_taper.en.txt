 The Luer taper is a standardized system of small-scale fluid fittings used for making leak-free connections between a male-taper fitting and its mating female part on medical and laboratory instruments, including hypodermic syringe tips and needles or stopcocks and needles. Named after the 19th century German medical instrument maker Hermann WÃ¼lfing Luer, it originated as a 6% taper fitting for glass bottle stoppers. Key features of Luer Taper connectors are defined in the ISO 594 standards. It is also defined in the DIN and EN standard 1707:1996 and 20594-1:1993. There are two varieties of Luer Taper connections: Luer-Lock and Luer-Slip. Luer-Lock fittings are securely joined by means of a tabbed hub on the female fitting which screws into threads in a sleeve on the male fitting. The Luer-Lok fitting was developed in the United States by Fairleigh S. Dickinson. Luer-Slip fittings simply conform to Luer taper dimensions and are pressed together and held by friction (they have no threads). Luer components are manufactured either from metal or plastic and are available from many companies worldwide. "Luer-Lock" and "Luer-Slip" are registered trademarks of Becton Dickinson. "Luer-Lok" style connectors are often generically referred to as "Luer lock".
