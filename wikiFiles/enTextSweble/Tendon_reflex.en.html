 Tendon reflex (or T-reflex) may refer to: To test the reflex, tap on the tendon. In a healthy individual the intensity on both sides is equal. This means that the connections between the spinal cord and the muscles are undamaged. The tendon reflex is a response to extensive tension on a tendon.It helps avoid strong muscle contractions which could tear the tendon from either the muscle or bone. In sports, quick movements can damage the tendon before the reflex can occur. .The tendon reflex also helps spread the workload more evenly over the entire muscle by preventing “muscle fibers connected with overstiumlated tendon organs so that their contraction is more comparable to the contraction of the rest of the muscle.”
