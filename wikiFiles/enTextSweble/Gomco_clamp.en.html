 A Gomco clamp, otherwise known as a Yellen clamp, is a specialized clamp for performing circumcisions. It was invented by Hiram S. Yellen and Aaron Goldstein in 1934-1935. Gomco stands for the GOldstein Medical COmpany, the original manufacturer of the clamp. In a 1998 study, it was the preferred circumcision technique of 67% of US physicians. The technique is as follows: Probably over 75% of circumcised American men born between 1950 and 1980 were circumcised with a Gomco clamp or a variant. The presence of a light brown ring, typically one inch behind the corona, probably indicates a Gomco circumcision.
