 Some diseases have been named after the person who first described the condition. This usually involves publishing an article in a respected medical journal. Rarely an eponymous disease may be named after a patient (examples include Christmas disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, Hartnup disease and Mortimer's disease). There is at least one example of a disorder which follows neither of these conventions - Fregoli delusion. Related disease namings include place names (Bornholm disease, Lyme disease, Ebola hemorrhagic fever) and even societies (Legionnaires' disease). These, however, are not eponyms. Eponyms are a longstanding tradition in Western science and medicine. Being awarded an eponym is regarded as an honour: "eponymity, not anonymity, is the standard" (Merton R K, 1973). It is regarded as bad form to attempt to eponymise oneself. At a time when medicine lacked the tools to investigate the underlying causes of many syndromes, the eponym was a convenient mechanism for attaching a label to a disease. In order to freely discuss something, it must have a name. In 1975, the Canadian National Institutes of Health held a conference where the naming of diseases and conditions was discussed. This was reported in The Lancet where the conclusion was that "The possessive use of an eponym should be discontinued, since the author neither had nor owned the disorder." Medical journals, dictionaries and style guides remain divided on this issue, with European journals tending to use the possessive and US journals largely dropping it. There is a trend away from the use of eponymous disease names towards a medical name that describes either the cause or the primary signs. Reasons for this include: Arguments for maintaining eponyms include:
