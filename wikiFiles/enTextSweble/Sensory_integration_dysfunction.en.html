 Sensory integration dysfunction (SID) is a hypothesized dysfunction of the vestibular system. It is characterized by increased or decreased sensitivity to stimuli. Currently, there is a movement to change the name of the dysfunction to Sensory Processing Disorder. It is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10. SID was first described in-depth by occupational therapist Anna Jean Ayres (1920â€“1989), who defined sensory integration as the ability to organize sensory information for use by the brain. According to Ayres's writings, an individual with SID would, therefore, have a decreased ability to organize sensory information as it comes in through the senses. Along with "sensory processing dysfunction," the term "sensory integration dysfunction" is used informally in the medical literature to describe any such difficulty. Various conditions can involve SID, such as schizophrenia, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, primary nocturnal enuresis, prenatal alcohol exposure, learning difficulties and autism, as well as people with traumatic brain injury or who have had cochlear implants placed. The concept of SID as a discrete mental disorder was popularized by Anna Jean Ayres, a Californian occupational therapist. Since the 2005 publication of her monograph on the subject, some occupational therapists argue in favor of creating a discrete diagnostic category for SID, but this position is disputed. SID is not listed as a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10.
