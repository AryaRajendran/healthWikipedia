 Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest (DHCA) is a surgical technique that involves cooling the body of the patient and stopping blood circulation. It is used in cardiac surgery to allow operation on the aortic arch and in neurosurgery to repair some brain aneurysms. The body can not live for more than 7 minutes without blood circulating. The procedure requires keeping the patient in a state of hibernation at 12 - 18 degrees Celsius with no breathing, heartbeat, or brain activity for up to one hour. Blood is drained from the body to eliminate blood pressure. The patient is considered clinically dead during the operation. "Most patients tolerate 30 min of DHCA without significant neurological dysfunction, but when this is extended to longer than 40 min, there is a marked increase in the incidence of brain injury. Above 60 min, the majority of patients will suffer irreversible brain injury, although there are still a small number of patients who can tolerate this. Longer periods of DHCA are tolerated in neonates and infants compared with adults." "Surgical management of giant cerebral aneurysms remains a major technical challenge for modern neurosurgeons. Endovascular approaches for giant aneurysms does not provide an acceptable alternative to direct surgical approaches. The use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest as an adjunct during clipping of complex giant aneurysms shows promise as a treatment for otherwise incurable lesions. Patient selection and techniques of circulatory arrest surgery are discussed". In the 2005-2006 season of the Grey's Anatomy TV series, doctors performed a standstill operation on Joe, the bar owner from across the street from the hospital. Doctor O'Malley came up with a creative solution to Joe's financial inability to pay for the expensive surgery by declaring that part of the surgery was experimenting on a cadaver, thereby entitling Joe to be paid for allowing his body to be used for the benefit of science.
