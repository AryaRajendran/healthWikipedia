 Palmaris brevis is a thin, quadrilateral muscle, placed beneath the integument of the ulnar side of the hand. It acts to fold the skin of the hypothenar eminence transversally. It arises by tendinous fasciculi from the transverse carpal ligament and palmar aponeurosis; the fleshy fibers are inserted into the skin on the ulnar border of the palm of the hand, and occasionally on the pisiform. It tenses the skin of the palm on the ulnar side during a grip action, and deepens the hollow of the palm. It is the only muscle innervated by the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve (C8, T1). It is supplied by the palmar metacarpal artery of the deep palmar arch.
