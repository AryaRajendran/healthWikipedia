 Sociogenic illness (or mass sociogenic illness) is a term that is used to describe a medical condition that occurs to multiple individuals within a social group, but does not seem to have a common organic cause. It does not 'spread' per se, as sociogenic illness is not transmissible as would occur with an infectious disease like flu, smallpox or bubonic plague. Sociogenic illnesses may be psychosomatic in nature resembling a mass hysteria (a term which is falling out of favor for its pejorative connotations), or may be defined by individuals with disparate illnesses that are wrongly linked to a common cause. Three examples of sociogenic illness widely publicised by the media are as follows: The examples above attest to the fact that sociogenic illness is difficult to determine and diagnose. It occurs under circumstances that are often complex and involving many factors.
