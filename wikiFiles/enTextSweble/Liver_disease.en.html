 Liver disease (also called hepatic disease) is a type of damage to or disease of the liver. The symptoms related to liver dysfunction include both physical signs and a variety of symptoms related to digestive problems, blood sugar problems, immune disorders, abnormal absorption of fats, and metabolism problems. The malabsorption of fats may lead to symptoms that include indigestion, reflux, deficit of fat-soluble vitamins, hemorrhoids, gall stones, intolerance to fatty foods, intolerance to alcohol, nausea and vomiting attacks, abdominal bloating, and constipation. Nervous system disorders include depression, mood changes, especially anger and irritability, poor concentration and "foggy brain", overheating of the body, especially the face and torso, and recurrent headaches (including migraine) associated with nausea. The blood sugar problems include hypoglycaemia. Abnormalities in the level of fats in the blood stream, whether too high or too low levels of lipids in the organism. Hypercholesterolemia: elevated LDL cholesterol, reduced HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, clogged arteries leading to high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes, build up of fat in other body organs (fatty degeneration of organs), lumps of fat in the skin (lipomas and other fatty tumors), excessive weight gain (which may lead to obesity), inability to lose weight even while dieting, sluggish metabolism, protuberant abdomen (pot belly), cellulite, fatty liver, and a roll of fat around the upper abdomen (liver roll) etc. Or too low levels of lipids: hypocholesterolemia: low total cholesterol, low LDL and VLDL cholesterol, low triglyderides. There are also many pediatric liver disease, including biliary atresia, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, alagille syndrome, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis to name but a few. The most effective way to treat alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is to make lifestyle changes, such as: Cutting out alcohol. Improving your diet. Taking regular exercise. Anti-viral medications are available to treat infections such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C. This is an area of active research and drug development and today many treatments offer improved outcomes, by clearing or controlling the virus to slow any decline in the condition of your liver. Other conditions may be managed by slowing down disease progression: By using steroid-based drugs in autoimmune hepatitis. Regularly removing a quantity of blood from a vein (venesection) in the iron overload condition, haemochromatosis. Wilsonâ€™s disease, a condition where copper builds up in the body, can be managed with drugs which bind copper allowing it to be passed from your body in urine. In cholestatic liver disease (where the flow of bile is affected) a medication called ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO, also referred to as UDCA) may be given. Made from naturally occurring bile acid, it may offer some protection for the liver from the harmful chemicals in the bile, slowing damage. A number of liver function tests are available to test the proper function of the liver. These test for the presence of enzymes in blood that are normally most abundant in liver tissue, metabolites or products. LFT's, serum proteins, serum albumin, serum globulin, A/G Ratio, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count.
