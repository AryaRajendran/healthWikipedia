 A bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a fistula between the pleural space and the lung. It sometimes develops following pneumonectomy or an infection. It may also develop when large airways are in communication with the pleural space following a large pneumothorax or other loss of pleural negative pressure, especially during positive pressure mechanical ventilation.
