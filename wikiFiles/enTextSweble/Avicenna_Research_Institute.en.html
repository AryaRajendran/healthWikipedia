 Avicenna Research Institute (ARI) () ) – affiliated to ACECR – was established in order to achieve latest medical technologies through conducting clinical and laboratory research projects in 1998. The institute consists of three research centers including Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center (RBRC), Monoclonal Antibody Research Center (MARC) and Nanobiotechnology Research Center (NBRC). ARI also includes Avicenna Biotechnology Incubator and Avicenna Infertility Clinic (AIC). Named after Ibn Sina, the research institute was found in 1998 in Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran. Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center (RBRC) includes Embryology and Andrology, Reproductive Genetics and Biotechnology, Reproductive Immunology, Reproductive Infections and Bio law & Ethics departments. For the purpose of laying a ground to provide therapeutic services and applied research findings in the field of infertility treatment, Avicenna Infertility Clinic (AIC) was founded. Five specialized clinics including Infertility Treatment, Recurrent Abortion, Perinatology, Sexual Health and Replacement Therapies organize AIC. Monoclonal Antibody Research Center (MARC) established in 2001 consists of Hybridoma, Immunochemistry and Antibody-Antigen Engineering Departments. Following introduction of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology as one of the main priorities of the country, Nanobiotechnology Research Center (NBRC) was founded in 2005. Three departments including Nanotechnology, Recombinant Technology and Medical Diagnostic Products form NBRC. Interaction between specialists of various professional fields such as biology, biotechnology and clinical and molecular medicine in 11 research departments provide the ground for educational and scientific activities. Considering modern equipment and enjoying specialized team in Avicenna Research Institute, Medical Biotechnology Incubator initiated its activity under technical, economical and scientific supports of ARI, in 2010. The main activities of this center are summarized in the fields of reproductive biotechnology, monoclonal antibodies, nanobiotechnology and etc. All the established sections in this center have the possibility to benefit from the facilities and services provided by Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center, Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Nanobiotechnology Research Center and Avicenna Infertility Clinic. Medical Biotechnology Incubator will foster new professions and encourage entrepreneurs working within the newly-founded units in the above fields. The most prominent missions of ARI:
