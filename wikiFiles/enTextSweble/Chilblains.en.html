 Chilblains (; also known as pernio and perniosis) is a medical condition that is often confused with frostbite and trench foot. Chilblains are a tissue injury that occurs when a predisposed individual is exposed to cold and humidity. The cold exposure damages capillary beds in the skin, which in turn can cause redness, itching, blisters, and inflammation. Chilblains are often idiopathic in origin but can be manifestations of serious medical conditions that need to be investigated. Chilblains can be prevented by keeping the feet and hands warm in cold weather. A history of chilblains is suggestive of a connective tissue disease. Rarely, chilblains in infants, together with severe neurologic disease and unexplained fevers, can be seen in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, a rare inherited condition. The areas most affected are the ears, earlobes, nose, and extremities; feet and toes, hands and fingers. With treatment, chilblains usually heal within 7–14 days. There are anecdotal reports that chilblains may be helped by Vitamin D and Calcium supplements. Recommend three to four times a day soaking in warm water with epsom salts for 15-20 minutes. The medieval Bald's Leechbook recommended that chilblains be treated with a mix of eggs, wine, and fennel root. ~
