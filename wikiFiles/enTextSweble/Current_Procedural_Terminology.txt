 The Current Procedural Terminology(CPT) code set is a medical code set maintained by the American Medical Association through the CPT Editorial Panel. The CPT code set (copyright protected by the AMA) describes medical, surgical, and diagnostic services and is designed to communicate uniform information about medical services and procedures among physicians, coders, patients, accreditation organizations, and payers for administrative, financial, and analytical purposes. New editions are released each October. The current version is the CPT 2013. It is available in both a standard edition and a professional edition. CPT coding is similar to ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding, except that it identifies the services rendered rather than the diagnosis on the claim. ICD code sets also contain procedure codes but these are only used in the inpatient setting. CPT is currently identified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as Level 1 of the Health Care Procedure Coding System. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) was developed by the American Medical Association (AMA) There are three types of CPT codes: Category I, Category II, and Category III. Category I CPT Code(s). There are six main sections: The CPT code revisions that effect counselors are simple and straightforward.

CPT is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association. The AMA holds the copyright for the CPT coding system. Despite the copyrighted nature of the CPT code sets, the use of the code is mandated by almost all health insurance payment and information systems, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and HIPAA, and the data for the code sets appears in the Federal Register. As a result, it is necessary for most users of the CPT code (principally providers of services) to pay license fees for access to the code. The AMA offers a limited search of the CPT manual for personal, non-commercial use on its web site.
