 The Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network (CERN) Foundation is a Nonprofit organization composed of scientists and adult and pediatric cancer researchers who work together to develop new treatments for Ependymoma, a type of primary brain or spinal cord tumor that occurs in both children and adults, and improve the outcomes and care of patients. The organization is headquartered in Dayton, Ohio, USA. The CERN Foundation’s research is based on a model that includes preclinical evaluation of new and FDA-approved drugs in laboratory models of ependymoma. The drugs are tested in clinical trials involving both pediatric and adult cancer centers from within the CERN network. The CERN Foundation’s research is needed to design better treatment plans for patients with ependymoma. The CERN Foundation differs from other cancer research organizations through its focus on collaborative research and sharing knowledge and available resources among participating researchers. In November 2006, the concept of creating an international group to develop new treatments for ependymoma was proposed to Mark Gilbert, M.D., Deputy Chairman of Neuro-Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center, during a meeting with an ependymoma survivor. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Gilbert was joined by Richard Gilbertson, M.D., Ph.D. and Amar Gajjar, M.D. of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and Ken Adalpe, M.D. and Terri Armstrong, Ph.D. of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. After the organization created its initial vision and established its leadership, additional partners joined the CERN team. Today, investigators representing many internationally recognized cancer centers are partnered with the CERN Foundation. On April 19, 2012 the CERN Foundation commemorated the first Ependymoma Awareness Day in Houston with a mass butterfly release. The mission of the CERN Foundation is to develop new treatments for ependymoma, improve the outcomes and care of patients, ultimately leading to a cure. CERN leads five research projects to discover new treatments for ependymoma. The CERN Foundation is led by investigators at two top cancer centers in the United States, MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. These institutions are supported by the collaborative efforts of other national and internationally recognized cancer centers where clinical trials can be accessed at most of these locations, including: The CERN Foundation is a private foundation. The majority of funding comes from individuals and organizations who are dedicated to the CERN Foundation mission. Tax deductible donations may be made on the CERN Foundation website. The CERN Foundation established the first Ependymoma Awareness Day on April 19, 2012, with a butterfly release. The CERN Foundation supporters purchased butterflies for the release and proceeds went to help fund the organization. The Foundation will be hosting the second annual Ependymoma Awareness Day on April 18, 2013.
