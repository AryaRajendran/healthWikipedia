 Steri-strips are 3M's Nexcare branded thin adhesive strips which can be used to close small wounds, generically known as butterfly stitches. They are applied across the laceration in a manner which pulls the skin on either side of the wound together. Steri-strips may be used instead of sutures (stitches) in some injuries, because they lessen scarring and are easier to care for. The precursor to the steri-strip was Micropore Surgical Tape. Reports exist of dramatic cases where Micropore Surgical tape alone was used to hold large abdominal incisions together when the skin was too fragile to accommodate sutures and another where one patient's abdominal wall was literally rebuilt with the tape and his life saved when sutures on the patient's compromised skin failed to hold the wound closed. These reports prompted 3M to cut Micropore Surgical Tape into one-eighth inch, one-fourth inch and one-half inch (, , and ) strips, sterilise and package it as primary surface closures for incisions. One of the drawbacks of the construction of steri-strips is the fact they are paper based, this means that their durability can be compromised if they get wet. Products such as Leukostrip have been developed that are made of a synthetic material that will repel water and therefore remain in place longer. Steri-strips are ideal for use in highly contoured areas or areas of musculoskeletal movements, such as joints. They are also for use in areas where swelling, edema, hematomas, or bloating may occur. Additionally, they provide wound support following early suture or staple removal. Steri-strips help prevent maceration. They result in less scarring when compared to staples or sutures. They present a lesser chance of infection than sutures or staples.
