 ARCH Air Medical Service (ARCH was an initialism for Area Rescue Consortium of Hospitals)is an emergency medical service (EMS) that provides critical care air ambulance service in Missouri, Illinois, and the surrounding regions. Air ambulance programs (also known as Medevac) offer transport by helicopter (rotor-wing) or fixed-wing aircraft. ARCH Air was the twelfth program in the U.S. to offer such services when it began operating in March 1979. Transporting approximately 4,200 patients per year by rotorwing, ARCH aircraft are staffed by a pilot, nurse and paramedic. Flights are 80% inter-facility (hospital to hospital) and 20% scene. Transport is also provided for specialty teams from St Marys Health Center obstetrics, Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, St. John's Mercy Medical Center, Creve Coeur neonatal, St Francis Medical Center, Cape Girardeau neonatal, Southeast Missouri Hospital Cape Girardeau neonatal, and St Johns Hospital, Springfield, IL neonatal, University of Missouri Children's Transport Service Peds and Neonate. The Helicopter Service area is around 150 miles around each base. Unlike what most programs in the industry practices, Arch's call signs and tailnumbers stay together no matter which base the aircraft responds from. Most Air Medical Programs will keep the call sign to identify which base the given aircraft responded from. Arch Also have currently 1 Fixed Wing that can fly nationwide; The Communication Center also does flight intake for the follow sister programs owned and operated by Air Methods:
