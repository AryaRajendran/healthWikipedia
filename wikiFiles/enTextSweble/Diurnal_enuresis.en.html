 Enuresis is defined as involuntary voiding of urine beyond the age of anticipated control. Diurnal enuresis is daytime wetting, nocturnal enuresis is nighttime wetting. Both of these conditions can occur at the same time, however, many children with nighttime wetting will not have wetting during the day. Children with daytime wetting may have frequent urination, have urgent urination or dribble after urinating. Daytime wetting is more common in girls than in boys, but bedwetting is three times as prevalent in boys (i.e., around 75% of sufferers are male). At the age of 7 approximately 3% of girls and 2% of boys experience functional daytime wetting at least once a week. Common causes include, but not limited to: Major changes in the management of daytime wetting came about in the 1990s. In most current programs, non-invasive treatments incorporate hydration, timed voiding, correction of constipation and in some cases, computer assisted pelvic floor retraining. These methods have been extremely successful in correcting daytime wetting. Bladder stretching exercises (where the person tries to hold their urine as long as possible) are no longer recommended. In fact, some urologists actually believe that this can be dangerous because the person could develop the long-term habit of tightening the urethral sphincter muscle, which can cause bladder or kidney problems. Urinating on a regular basis is much preferred. Ruling out infections can also be a part of the differential. This article contains facts and text from with permission from the author.
