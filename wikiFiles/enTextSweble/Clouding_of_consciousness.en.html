 Clouding of consciousness, also known as brain fog or mental fog, is a term used in conventional medicine denoting an abnormality in the "regulation" of the "overall level" of consciousness that is mild and less severe than a delirium. The sufferer experiences a subjective sensation of mental clouding described as feeling "foggy". In the 1817 German treatise Der Traum und des fieberhafte Irreseyn, translated as "The Dream and the feverish Insanity", Greiner first pioneered the term clouding of consciousness (Verdunkelung des Bewusstseins) to describe the pathophysiological abnormality responsible for delirium. Recently, however, the term has been dropped from US definitions of delirium. Many doctors now define clouding of consciousness to be milder than delirium on the continuum from full alertness to coma. Clouding of consciousness is basically synonymous with subsyndromal delirium. Subsyndromal delirium differs from normal delirium by being overall less severe, lacking acuteness in onset and duration, having a relatively stable sleep-wake cycle, having relatively stable motor alterations, and lacking significant hallucinations or delusions. The significant clinical features of subsyndromal delirium are inattention, thought process abnormalities, comprehension abnormalities, and language abnormalities. The DSM-IV-TR codes subsyndromal delirium under the miscellaneous category of "cognitive disorder not otherwise specified". Despite the similarities, subsyndromal delirium is not the same thing as mild cognitive impairment. The fundamental difference is that mild cognitive impairment is a dementia-like impairment, which does not involve a disturbance in arousal. Conventional doctors understudy and neglected subsyndromal delirium because they "expect" delirium to be severe and they prefer to dedicated their medical resources to managing the more immediate "life-threatening" problems. Many alternative medicine practitioners, on the other hand, enthusiastically embrace the concept of a brain fog. However, Peter A. Lipson, MD, a blogger and skeptic of alternative medicine, claims that "it is not clear what the phrase represents", referring to a writer describing bouts of "brain fog" after getting Lyme disease. Conventional medicine recognizes that a characteristic presentation of Lyme disease is clouding of consciousness, which, in turn, conventional medicine also calls mental fog. The difference between the word "brain" and the word "mental" is perhaps trivial just like the difference between the word "clouding" and the word "fog" is perhaps trivial. However, the difference between the word "fog" and the word "fag" is not trivial. Brain fag is a culture-bound syndrome characterized by complaints of the brain being "fatigued" and is not the same thing as brain fog or mental fog. Such diseases as hepatic encephalopathy, minimal hepatic encephalopathy (also known as subclinical hepatic encephalopathy or latent hepatic encephalopathy), Wernicke's encephalopathy, subclinical Wernicke's encephalopathy, candidiasis, and intestinal tapeworms cause this clouding of consciousness. Doctors have long said that autointoxication causes clouding of consciousness and that this autointoxication is what is responsible for hepatic encephalopathy. Some alternative medicine practitioners say that candidiasis (also known as candida-related complex or the yeast syndrome) causes "brain fog". Some alternative medicine practitioners also say that mucoid plaque can indirectly cause "brain fog" by providing a haven for bacteria and candida yeast as well as by acting as a reservoir for the toxins they produce. Yet other alternative medicine practitioners say that ongoing caffeine anaphylaxis can cause clouding of consciousness. Neurologists conceptualize clouding of consciousness in terms of a part of the brain regulating the "overall level" of the consciousness part of the brain responsible for awareness of oneself and of the environment. Various etiologies disturb this regulating part of the brain, which in turn disturbs the "overall level" of consciousness. This system of a sort of general activation of consciousness is referred to as "arousal" or "wakefulness". The term "wakefulness" apparently has two contradictory definitions. On one hand, it is said that wakefulness is the degree of sensory stimulation required to keep the patient awake and vigilant. On the other hand, it is said that it is possible for sufferers to be "awake" yet to still have a clouded consciousness. Paradoxically, sufferers declare that they are "awake but, in another way, not". Lipowski explains that "wakefulness" as used here with clouding of consciousness does not mean "sleepiness" as is commonly thought of in common parlance. One is a stage on the way to coma, the other on the way to sleep which is very different. The sufferer experiences a subjective sensation of mental clouding described in the patient's own words as feeling "foggy". One sufferer described it as "I thought it became like misty, in some way... the outlines were sort of fuzzy". Sufferers compare their overall experience to that of a dream because like in a dream consciousness, attention, orientation to time and place, perceptions, and awareness are disturbed. Barbara Schildkrout, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and clinical instructor in psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School described her subjective experience of clouding of consciousness, or what she also called "mental fog", after taking a single dose of the antihistamine chlorpheniramine for her cottonwood allergy while on a cross-country road trip. She described feeling "out of it" and being in a "dreamy state". She described a sense of not trusting her own judgment and a dulled awareness, not knowing how long time went by. Clouding of consciousness is not the same thing as depersonalization even though both sufferers compare their experience to that of a dream. Psychometric tests produce little evidence of a relationship between clouding of consciousness and depersonalization. This may affect performance on virtually any cognitive task. As one author put it, "It should be apparent that cognition is not possible without a reasonable degree of arousal." The most significant, however, are inattention, thought process abnormalities, comprehension abnormalities, and language abnormalities. Sufferers may complain of being “confused”, “unable to think straight”, or “unable to get it together”.
