 Intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) is a respiratory therapy treatment for people who are hypoventilating. While not a preferred method due to cost, IPPB is used to expand the lungs, deliver aerosol medications, and in some circumstances ventilate the patient. IPPB may be indicated for patients who are at risk for developing atelectasis and who are unable or unwilling to breathe deeply without assistance. In patients with severe lung hyperinflation, IPPB may decrease dyspnea and discomfort during nebulized therapy. Most contraindications are relative, such as nausea, hemodynamic instability, tracheal fistula, singulation and hemoptysis. Untreated tension pneumothorax is an absolute contraindication.
