 Medicine Unboxed is a project arising from a view that good medicine demands more than scientific and technical expertise, and that it necessitates ethical judgment, an understanding of human experience, empathy, professionalism and wisdom. Medicine Unboxed is a not-for-profit organisation that has held four international conferences ("Unboxing Medicine" in 2009, "Stories, Language and Medicine" in 2010, "Medicjne and Values" in 2011 and "Belief" in 2012) in Cheltenham, UK. The aim of Medicine Unboxed is to explore "understanding medicine through the arts and humanities", and engage the public and front-line National Health Service staff with a view of medicine that is infused and elaborated by the humanities, with a view to promoting dialogue around the goals and values of medicine within society. Contributors to the conferences include artists, writers, the clergy, poets, philosophers, lawyers, linguists, musicians, theatre, ethicists, academics and doctors. Previous notable contributors include Amateur Transplants, Dannie Abse, Gwyneth Lewis, Jo Shapcott, Frank Harsent, Gabriel Weston and Raymond Tallis. Medicine Unboxed is curated by Dr. Sam Guglani, Consultant Oncologist at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, that supports the organisation along with the Wellcome Foundation. The Creative Director is Peter Thomas and advisors are Dr. Sean Elyan and Dame Janet Trotter. Medicine Unboxed has been widely reported in the medical press including The Lancet, The British Medical Journal Online and Lapidus. The third event in the Medicine Unboxed series was "Medicine and Values", which took place on 15 October 2011 at the Parabola Arts Centre in Cheltenham and includes contributions by Lionel Shriver, Jo Shapcott, Revd. John Bell, Raymond Tallis, John Carey, Paul Bailey, Michael Arditti, Havi Carel and Tom Isaacs (of The Cure Parkinson's Trust). In 2012, the Medicine Unboxed theme was Belief.
