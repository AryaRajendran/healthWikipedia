 Florid cutaneous papillomatosis (also known as Schwartz-Burgess syndrome and FCP) is the sudden onset of numerous cutaneous papillomas that are indistinguishable from viral warts, and associated with underlying malignancy. It was discovered by Robert A. Schwartz MD and Gordon H. Burgess MD. The original description was published in the Archives of Dermatology, which is published by American Medical Association. Florid cutaneous papillomatosis presents with verrucous papulonodules resembling viral warts. These skin lesions develop on the trunk, extremities, and face, and are almost twice as common in men than in women, especially individuals aged 53–72 years. This papillomatosis may also present with other cutaneous signs of internal malignancy, such as acanthosis nigricans type I and Leser-Trélat. Florid cutaneous papillomatosis is associated with underlying malignancy, most often gastric adenocarcinoma but also with breast cancer, bladder cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer; however, the cause of FCP is currently not known.
