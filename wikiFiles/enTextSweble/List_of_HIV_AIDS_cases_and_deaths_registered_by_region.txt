 This page lists the reported and registered HIV/AIDS cases by reporting region. This may be a country or subdivision, for some large nations national statistics are complicated and rare. This list is only documented cases, not for estimated cases. Estimated cases can vary wildly by source and year, and often are significantly higher than reported cases. In nations where reporting is poor, much of the population may go untested, and much of the reported deaths may be improperly attributed to opportunistic infections rather than AIDS, therefore, higher statistics here do not indicate one region is harder hit by HIV/AIDS than another, rather the government acknowledgement and action to document cases of an epidemic. Some of the hardest hit nations, especially in Africa and Asia, have very poor reporting, and thus low or no statistics here. US CDC has begun reporting AIDS related deaths but HIV cases is not uniform among states. Reporting of cases and deaths may be delayed by years in many nations, masking epidemics. According to World AIDS Day 2011 estimates, some 30 million have died, 64 million have been infected since the epidemic began. COLOR CODE: Countries/regions in light blue have latest year HIV cases exceeding 10% of cumulative total, deep blue exceeding 20%, and pink exceeding 30%. These colors suggest an outbreak or insufficient reporting. If HIV estimates are correct, government efforts to report are still hugely inadequate, only 1 in 4 hiv cases have ever been reported globally, and 1 in 13 deaths.(using this list as reference)
