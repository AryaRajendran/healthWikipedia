 Reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI) is a surgical subspecialty of obstetrics and gynecology that trains physicians in reproductive medicine addressing hormonal functioning as it pertains to reproduction as well as the issue of infertility. While most REI specialists primarily focus on the treatment of infertility, reproductive endocrinologists are trained to also evaluate and treat hormonal dysfunctions in females and males outside of infertility. Reproductive endocrinologists have specialty training in obstetrics and gynecology (ob-gyn) before they undergo sub-specialty training (fellowship) in REI. Reproductive surgery is a related specialty, where a physician in ob-gyn or urology further specializes to operate on anatomical disorders that affect fertility. In a number of countries, the pathway to become a sub-specialist in REI is regulated. Thus, in the United States, for instance, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) sets the standards for sub-specialtists to become certified. After four years of training in Obstetrics and Gynecology, a three-year approved fellowship needs to be successfully completed. Then, to become board certified in reproductive endocrinology and infertility, one must first complete board certification in obstetrics and gynecology (written and oral exams), and then certify in reproductive endocrinology and infertility (written, oral, and thesis exams). In the United States, fellowships in reproductive endocrinology are offered in the following locations in 2013: In the European Union, accreditation centers for the EBCOG subspecialist training program in reproductive medicine are located at: Reproductive endocrinologists Certified by ABOG often belong to a specific medical society named Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (SREI). As a condition of full membership, medical practitioners must be ABOG-certified in the reproductive endocrinology and infertility subspecialty. Also, many academic journals in obstetrics and gynaecology dedicate many articles to reproductive endocrinology and infertility. According to a systematic review, fertility patients want to be treated like human beings with a need for medical skills, respect, coordination, accessibility, information, comfort, support, partner involvement and a good attitude of and relationship with fertility clinic staff.
