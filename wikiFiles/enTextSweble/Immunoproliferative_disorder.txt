 Immunoproliferative disorders (also known as “immunoproliferative diseases” or “immunoproliferative neoplasms”) are disorders of the immune system that are characterized by the abnormal proliferation of the primary cells of the immune system, which includes B cells, T cells and Natural killer (NK) cells, or by the excessive production of immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies). These disorders are subdivided into three main classes, which are lymphoproliferative disorders, hypergammaglobulinemia, and paraproteinemia. The first is cellular, and the other two are humoral (however, humoral excess can be secondary to cellular excess.)
