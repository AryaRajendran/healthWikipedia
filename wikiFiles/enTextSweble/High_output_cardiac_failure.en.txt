 High-output heart failure is a term in human and veterinary medicine to describe a condition that occurs when there is a high-output state (a condition where the cardiac output is higher than normal). There is a circulatory overload which may develop pulmonary edema secondary to an elevated diastolic pressure in left ventricle. These patients have usually a normal systolic function but symptoms are those of a heart failure. With time, this overload causes systolic failure. Ultimately cardiac output can be reduced to very low levels. It may occur in situations with an increased blood volume, from excess of water and salt (renal pathology, excess of fluid or blood administration, treatment with retaining water steroids), chronic and severe anemia, large arteriovenous fistula or multiple small arteriovenous shunts as in Paget's disease of bone, some forms of severe hepatic or renal disorders, hyperthyroidism, beriberi. and acutely in septic shock, especially caused by Gram-negative bacteria.
