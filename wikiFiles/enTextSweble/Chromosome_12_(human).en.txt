 Chromosome 12 is one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 12 spans about 143 million base pairs (the building material of DNA) and represents between 4 and 4.5 percent of the total DNA in cells. Identifying genes on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 12 likely contains between 1,000 and 1,300 genes. It also contains the Homeobox C gene cluster. The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 12: The following diseases are some of those related to genes on chromosome 12:
