 The Obliquus oculi inferior (inferior oblique) is a thin, narrow muscle placed near the anterior margin of the floor of the orbit. Its actions are extorsion, elevation and abduction of the eye. Primary action is extorsion; secondary action is elevation; tertiary action is abduction (i.e. it extorts the eye and moves it upward and outwards). The field of maximal inferior oblique elevation is in the adducted position. The inferior oblique muscle is the only muscle that is capable of elevating the eye when it is in a fully adducted position. The inferior oblique arises from the orbital surface of the maxilla, lateral to the lacrimal groove. Passing lateralward, backward, and upward, between the inferior rectus and the floor of the orbit, the inferior oblique inserts onto the scleral surface between the inferior rectus and lateral rectus. The origin of the inferior oblique muscle is not on the common tendinous ring (annulus of Zinn). The inferior oblique is innervated by the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). While commonly affected by palsies of the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve, isolated palsies of the inferior oblique (without affecting other functions of the oculomotor nerve) are quite rare. "Overaction" of the inferior oblique muscle is a commonly observed component of childhood strabismus, particularly infantile esotropia and exotropia. Because true hyperinnervation is not usually present, this phenomenon is better termed "elevation in adduction". Surgical procedures of the inferior oblique include: loosening (also known as recession see Strabismus_surgery), myectomy, marginal myotomy, and denervation and extirpation.
