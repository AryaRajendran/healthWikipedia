 Chondroitinase treatment is a treatment of proteoglycans, a protein in the fluid among cells where (among other things) they affect neural activity (communication, plasticity). Chondroitinase treatment has been shown to allow adults vision to be restored as far as ocular dominance is concerned. Moreover there is some evidence that Chondroitinase could be used for the treatment of spinal injuries.
