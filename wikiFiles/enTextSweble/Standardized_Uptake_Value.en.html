 The Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) is often used in PET imaging for a simple semi-quantitative analysis. An example is the analysis of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) images for cancer therapy monitoring. It can also be used with other PET agents especially when no arterial input function is available for more detailed pharmacokinetic modeling. If the arterial input function is available, commonly via blood sampling but also via advanced image analysis techniques, other measures like the Fractional Uptake Rate are preferable, or more advanced pharmacokinetic modeling may be undertaken. The SUV is calculated either pixel-wise or over a region of interest (ROI) for each image of a dynamic series at time points t. It is the ratio of (1) tissue radioactivity concentration (e.g. in MBq/kg=kBq/g) at time t, c(t), and (2) the injected activity (e.g. in MBq) at the time of injection (t=0) divided by the body weight (e.g. in kg): In other words, the SUV represents the ratio of (1) the actual radioactivity concentration found in a selected part of the body at a certain time point, and (2) the radioactivity concentration in the hypothetical case of an even distribution of the injected radioactivity across the whole body. Here, the difference between c(t) measured per volume (as in images) or per weight (as indicated by the unit MBq/kg above) is ignored assuming that in case of soft tissues the mass density is approximately 1 kg/L. Moreover, both radioactivity measures c(t) and injected activity are corrected for the physical decay of the radioisotope to the same time point (e.g. time of injection). Some authors prefer to use the lean body weight or the body surface area instead of the body weight. Also for c(t) often either the maximum or the mean value of a ROI is taken, and further modifications like additional thresholds may be employed. SUVs can be affected by image noise, low image resolution and user biased ROI selection. For the semi-quantitative analysis of [18F]FDG uptake in tissue or tumor, several corrections have been recommended (see and references therein). The SUV concept has been only begun to be tested in connection with other radiotracers like [18F]fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT) and conclusions on its usefulness and robustness in these cases might be premature. In summary, SUVs are a convenient measure for the evaluation of [18F]FDG-PET images, but care has to be taken with respect to its pitfalls and interpretation of the results.
