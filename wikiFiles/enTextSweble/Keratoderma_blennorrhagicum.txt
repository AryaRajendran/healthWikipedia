 Keratoderma blennorrhagicum (also called Keratoderma blennorrhagica) are skin lesions commonly found on the palms and soles but which may spread to the scrotum, scalp and trunk also, and which resemble psoriasis. Keratoderma blennorrhagicum is commonly seen as an additional feature of reactive arthritis in almost 15% of male patients. The appearance is usually of a vesico-pustular waxy lesion with a yellow brown colour. These lesions may join together to form larger crusty plaques with desquamating edges.
