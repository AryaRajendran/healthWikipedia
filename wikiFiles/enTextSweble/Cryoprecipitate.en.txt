 Cryoprecipitate, also called "Cryoprecipitated Antihaemophilic Factor", "Cryoprecipitated AHF", and "cryo" for short, is a frozen blood product prepared from plasma. It is often transfused as a four to six unit pool instead of as a single product. Many uses of the product have been replaced by factor concentrates, but it is still routinely stocked by many hospital blood banks. Like fresh frozen plasma, compatibility testing is not strictly necessary, but cryo is given as ABO compatible when possible. (Compatibility is reversed for plasma products: AB type is the universal plasma donor and O type is the universal plasma recipient.) Each 15 mL unit typically contains 100 IU of factor VIII, and 250 mg of fibrinogen. It also contains von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor XIII. US standards require manufacturers to test at least four units each month, and the products must have an average of 150 mg or more of fibrinogen and 80 IU of factor VIII. Individual products may actually have less than these amounts as long as the average remains above these minimums. Typical values for a unit are substantially higher, and aside from infants it is rare to transfuse just one unit. Indications for giving cryoprecipitate include:
