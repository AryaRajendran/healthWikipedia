 Volkmann's contracture, also known as Volkmann's ischaemic contracture, is a permanent flexion contracture of the hand at the wrist, resulting in a claw-like deformity of the hand and fingers. It is more common in children. Passive extension of fingers is restricted and painful. On examination the fingers are white or blue and cold and the radial pulse is absent. It is named after Dr. Richard von Volkmann (1830 - 1889), the 19th century German doctor who first described it, in a paper on "non-Infective Ischemic conditions of various fascial compartments in the extremities". Because the contracture occurred at the same time as the paralysis, he considered a nerve etiology to be unlikely. Any fracture in elbow region or upper arm may lead to Volkmann's ischemic contracture but commonly caused due to supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Volkmann's contracture results from acute ischaemia/necrosis of the muscle fibres of the flexor group of muscles of the forearm, especially flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus which becomes fibrotic and short. It is caused by obstruction on the brachial artery near the elbow, possibly from improper use of a tourniquet, improper use of a plaster cast, or compartment syndrome. It is also caused by fracture of forearm bones which cause profuse bleeding from major blood vessels of forearm. Surgery to release the fixed tissues may help with the deformity and function of the hand. All splints, plaster and bandages that might be obstructing the circulation should be removed and fascial compartment should be opened fasciotomy in incipient stage. Prevention: Management:
