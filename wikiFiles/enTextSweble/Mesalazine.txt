 Mesalazine (INN, BAN), also known as mesalamine (USAN) or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), is an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease. Mesalazine is a bowel-specific aminosalicylate drug that acts locally in the gut and has its predominant actions there, thereby having few systemic side effects. As a derivative of salicylic acid, mesalazine is also thought to be an antioxidant that traps free radicals, which are potentially damaging byproducts of metabolism. Mesalazine is considered the active moiety of sulfasalazine, which is metabolized to sulfapyridine and mesalazine. Commonly: Uncommonly: Rarely: Mesalazine avoids the sulfonamide side effects of sulfasalazine (which contains additional sulfapyridine), but carries additional rare risks of: As a result of the small risks of kidney, liver and blood disorders, blood tests should be taken before and after starting treatment. Patients are advised to report any unexplained bleeding, bruising, purpura, sore throat, fever or malaise that occurs during treatment so that a full blood count can be urgently taken. Mesalazine is formulated for oral ingestion as tablets or granules, and for rectal administration as a rectal suppository, suspension or enemas. It is marketed under a variety of brand names: Chron-asa 5, Pentasa, Pentasa Enema, Mesaneo Dosing depends on the preparation used; in particular, slow-release tablets may have quite different drug delivery characteristics and are not interchangeable. Preparations that lower stool pH (such as lactulose, a laxative) will possibly affect the binding of mesalazine in the bowel and will therefore reduce its efficacy.
