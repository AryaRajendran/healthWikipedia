 Micrognathism (or Micrognathia) is a condition where the jaw is undersized. It is also sometimes called "Mandibular hypoplasia". It is common in infants, but is usually self-corrected during growth, due to the jaws increasing in size. It may be a cause of abnormal tooth alignment and in severe cases can hamper feeding. It can also, both in adults and children, make intubation difficult, either during anesthesia or in emergency situations. While not always pathological, it can present as a birth defect in multiple syndromes including: fetal alcohol syndrome, congenital rubella, DiGeorge's Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Pierre Robin syndrome, Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, Trisomy 13(Patau syndrome), Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), X0 syndrome (Turner syndrome), Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Progeria, Treacher Collins syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Coffin–Lowry syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, Seckel syndrome, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Cri du chat syndrome, Bloom syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Craniofacial microsomia (Goldenhar Syndrome), and Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome. It can be detected by the naked eye as well as dental or skull X-Ray testing.
