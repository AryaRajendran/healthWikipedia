 Arterial Insufficiency is a lack of enough blood flow through the arteries typically caused by atherosclerosis. Arterial insufficiency can affect many different parts of the body. The specific symptoms may indicate which artery is involved. If heart arteries are involved, it can cause symptoms of heart attack. If brain arteries are involved, it can cause symptoms of stroke. If the arteries of the lower abdomen or legs are involved, you might have repeated episodes of leg cramping when you walk. Arterial insufficiency also can affect the arteries in the abdomen, causing pain after eating meals. A common disorder of the arteries elastic and muscular-elastic types (large and medium-sized), characterized infiltration into the vessel wall atherogenic apoprotein-ß-containing lipoproteins and the subsequent development of connective tissue, atheromatous plaques, organ and general blood circulation disorders Macroscopically the aorta and its branches are transferred traces of inflammation: The presence of dense fibrous capsule The increase in para-aortic lymph nodes Diameter of the aorta is increased due to thickening of the outer layers of the wall Outer shell is presented in the form of connective collagen bundles Thickened muscle layer in the vasa vasorum Proliferation, giperelastoz tunica Smooth muscle and elastic membranes are fragmented between granulation tissue in short In children, the disease is often the type of SARS After puberty - begins to dominate ischemic syndromes defeat respective pools Antiplatelet therapy - Leading Required: complete cessation of smoking, the compensation related diabetes and hypertension diet Normalization of body weight Antiplatelet drugs and rheological Lipid funds Antispasmodic Antioxidants Efferent therapy Physiotherapy Vazaprostan (alprostadil) Complex action (antiplatelet agents, selective spazmalytic) Drug of choice for critical limb ischemia Stenosing or occlusive lesions of the aorta and / or arteries, symptomatic limb ischemia     Aneurysm of the abdominal aorta Local or diffuse enlargement of its diameter greater than 3 cm Takes the 10th place among the causes of death for men over 55 Prevalence: 2 - 5% of men over 60 years 6% of men older than 65 years (in the presence of hypertension or atherosclerotic occlusive arterial aneurysm prevalence - 10%) 11% of men older than 75 years 4% of women over 65 years The disease is mainly of acquired character The main reasons Atherosclerosis - 85% CTD - 6% Nonspecific aorto-arteritis - 5% Injuries - 4% Indications for elective surgical reconstruction: The outer diameter of the aneurysm> = 4 cm Outer diameter of aneurysm <4 cm and an increase of 0.5 cm in 6 months Perioperative mortality rate of 3-5% Alternative to surgical treatment - arthroplasty (CFR 1.5-2%) Conservative therapy is indicated for: Aneurysm diameter <4 cm Increasing the diameter of less than 2 mm Numbness and paresthesias hands Monoparezy (cortical type) and hemiparesis Transient aphasia, dysarthria, cortical Transient blindness in one eye Homolateral Horner's syndrome Optical-paretic and paretic-afatooptiko syndromes duplex scanning transcranial Doppler computed tomography electroencephalography ultrasound scanning Radiopaque angiography Asymptomatic carotid stenosis of more than 60% and more Symptomatic carotid stenosis greater than 50% Ultrasound signs of the "unstable" plaque Hemodynamically significant carotid artery pathological tortuosity Marfan Syndrome - a genetic defect in 15 pairs of chromosomes, resulting in disturbed synthesis of fibrillin, which is one of the main components of fibro-elastic connective tissue Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - a congenital defect of the connective tissue. One of its forms (type IV) is associated with severe pathology of the cardiovascular system Dilatation of the aortic root - (cause of death in 75 - 85%) Occlusion of the mouths of the coronary arteries Exfoliating aortic Prolapse and mitral regurgitation Dilatation of the left ventricle and heart failure Aortic valve insufficiency as a result of aortic root dilatation The risk of aortic rupture increases significantly when the diameter of the aorta is greater than 5.5 cm Smoking cessation and exercise therapy (regular walking) are useful both for treatment of arterial insufficiency and its prophylaxis. Two medications currently are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of intermittent claudication: pentoxifylline (hemorheologic agent) and cilostazol (phosphodiesterase inhibitor). The type of operation depends on the anatomic level and extent of arterial disease: While there is no direct association between arterial insufficiency and diet, a low fat, low cholesterol diet is generally recommended. Regular walking exercise at least 30 minutes 3 times a week is recommended.
