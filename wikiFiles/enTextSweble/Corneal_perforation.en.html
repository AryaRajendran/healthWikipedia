 Corneal Perforation is an anomaly in the cornea resulting from damage to the corneal surface. A corneal perforation means that the cornea has been penetrated, thus leaving the cornea damaged. The cornea is a clear part of the eye which controls and focuses the entry of light into the eye. Damage to the cornea due to corneal perforation can cause decreased visual acuity. Corneal perforation can be diagnosed by using the Seidel test. Any aqueous leakage is revealed during the Seidel test confirms corneal perforation. A fluorescence strip is wiped over the wound. If the clear aqueous humor from the eye runs through the yellow stain, the patient tests positive for corneal perforation. The treatment of corneal perforation depends on the location, severity and the cause of damage
