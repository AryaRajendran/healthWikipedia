 The Endocrine Society is a professional, international medical organization in the field of endocrinology and metabolism, founded in 1916 as The Association for the Study of Internal Secretions. The official name of the organization was changed to The Endocrine Society on January 1, 1952. It is a leading organization in the field and publishes four leading journals. It has more than 14,000 members from over 85 countries in medicine, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, physiology, genetics, immunology, education, industry and allied health. The Society's mission is: "excellence in hormone research and care of patients with endocrine disease". It is said to be "the world's oldest, largest and most active organization devoted to research on hormones and the clinical practice of endocrinology" Annual Meetings have been held since 1916 except in 1943 and 1945 during World War II when meetings were cancelled at the request of the United States government. Realizing the increasing importance of endocrinology to general medicine, the Council, in 1947, established an annual post graduate assembly now known as the Clinical Endocrinology Update. The Society publishes Endocrinology, the first issue of which was published in January 1927 and edited by Henry Harrower. Another publication, The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology, was established in 1941, and the name of the journal was changed to The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism on January 1, 1952. In 1997, The Society established The Hormone Foundation, a public education affiliate. The mission of The Hormone Foundation is to serve as a resource for the public by promoting the prevention, treatment and cure of hormone-related conditions through outreach and education. The Endocrine Society publishes the following journals:
