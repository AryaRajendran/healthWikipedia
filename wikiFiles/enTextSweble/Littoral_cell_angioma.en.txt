 Littoral cell angioma, abbreviated LCA, and formally known as littoral cell angioma of the spleen, is a benign tumour of the spleen that arises the from the cells that line the red pulp. LCAs can manifest with splenomegaly, persistent fever and weight loss. Littoral cell angiomas are diagnosed by pathologists. Histologically, they have anastoming small vascular channels and cystic spaces with papillary projections. The treatment for a littoral cell angioma is a splenectomy.
