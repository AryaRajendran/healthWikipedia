 Facial rejuvenation is any cosmetic or medical procedure used to increase or restore the appearance of a younger age to human face. The specific term, however, refers to a set of surgical procedures which try to restore facial geometry and skin appearance which are typical of youth, by using a combination of brow lift, elimination of eye bags, eyelids lift, elimination of senile spots, skin aging, facial sagging and wrinkles by face lift and rhytidectomy and physical or chemical peeling, chin lift (reduction of double chin), restoration of facial hairline, etc. These procedures are usually successful and in some cases achieve striking results. Examples of facial rejuvenation treatments are Fractional Radiofrequency and Ultherapy, both non-invasive procedures stimulating the body's own regenerative process of building new skin and tighten the skin. Other procedures are: More recent research has pointed out the influence of changes in the facial skeleton with age on the appearance of "oldness", especially in the mid-face area and the lower part of the orbits around the nose. quantitative study with CAT scans of the faces of men and women in several age brackets 1 has revealed that there is an appreciable amount of loss of bone tissue in these regions with age, leading to changes in angles, lengths and volumes, and also decreasing the distance between the eyes. This occurs earlier in women than in men. It has been hypothesised that skin sagging and wrinkles may occur not only because of loss of soft tissue and fat, but also because bone retraction creates an excess of skin which is no longer flexible. Future facial rejuvenation techniques may take into account these findings and restore bone lost by aging processes. Human visual perception is notable to its sensitivity and accuracy in estimating or perceiving age by instant pattern recognition of facial features. Often, human faces with no measurable difference in facial geometry and appearance are perceived as having different ages. This mechanism is not yet entirely understood, but they may be related to the subtle changes in facial bone structure related above. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, more than 114,000 facelifts and nearly 55,000 forehead lifts were performed in the USA in 2004, the majority on women. A significant upward trend on the number of facial rejuvenation procedures is predicted, due to the following factors: In 2011, the ASPS numbers continue to increase for the majority of rejuvenating procedures. 119,026 facelifts but 46,931 forehead lifts (also known as a brow lift) were performed. However, while surgical procedures are preferred to achieve a more dramatic improvement, the current trend is for less invasive procedures, such as injectables (Botox, fillers) and laser skin treatments. While these treatments achieve temporary results, they tend to be preferred due to their less intensive recovery period.
