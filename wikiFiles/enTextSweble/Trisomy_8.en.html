 Trisomy 8 is a human chromosomal disorder caused by having three copies (trisomy) of chromosome 8. It can appear with or without mosaicism it is also called 'Warkany syndrome 2'. Complete trisomy 8 causes severe effects on the developing fetus and can be a cause of miscarriage. Complete trisomy 8 is usually an early lethal condition, whereas trisomy 8 mosaicism is less severe and individuals with a low proportion of affected cells may exhibit a comparatively mild range of physical abnormalities and developmental delay. Individuals with trisomy 8 mosaicism are more likely to survive into childhood and adulthood, and exhibit a characteristic and recognizable pattern of developmental abnormalities. Common findings include retarded psychomotor development, moderate to severe mental retardation, variable growth patterns which can result in either abnormally short or tall stature, an expressionless face, and many musculoskeletal, visceral, and eye abnormalities, as well as other anomalies. A deep plantar furrow is considered to be pathognomonic of this condition, especially when seen in combination with other associated features. The type and severity of symptoms are dependent upon the location and proportion of trisomy 8 cells compared to normal cells. Trisomy 8 with or without mosaicism is occasionally referred to by the eponym Warkany syndrome or Warkany syndrome 2. Trisomy 8 mosaicism affects wide areas of chromosome 8 containing many genes, and can thus be associated with a range of symptoms.
