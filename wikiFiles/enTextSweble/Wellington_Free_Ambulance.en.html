 The Wellington Free Ambulance (WFA) provides free to the patient ambulance services in the Wellington Region of New Zealand. The ambulance service was created on 9 November 1927 by the mayor of Wellington, Sir Charles Norwood, and initially operated out of the Old Navals boatshed. The service moved into a purpose built station on Cable Street in 1932, with Lord Bledisloe laying the foundation stone. The board created a long service medal for staff in 1956, for twelve (later ten) years service. In 1994 Prince Charles opened the new ambulance station in Davis Street, Thorndon, after a major fundraising drive. A WFA officer was accidentally shot in the leg by police during an AOS exercise on 27 July 2002. On 8 September 2005 an ambulance belonging to the service was stolen during a call-out, the vehicle was found crashed on its side at nearby intersection. Thieves stole $5,000 worth of equipment and caused $15,000 damage to a WFA vehicle in November 2007. The service annually assists over 40,000 patients in the Wellington Region. The headquarters includes vehicle maintenance facilities, and a communications centre - one of three in the national network. The Life Flight air ambulance service jointly owns an ambulance in Wellington with the WFA. The cost of running the service in 2006 was $10.8 M. 75% of this cost is met by the Ministry of Health and the Accident Compensation Corporation. The remainder comes from donations and bequests from the public, proceeds from first aid training and supplies, and medical alarms. the service has the following resources:
