 Stridor (Latin for "creaking or grating noise") is a high-pitched wheezing sound resulting from turbulent air flow in the upper airway. Stridor is a physical sign which is produced by narrowed or obstructed airway path. It can be inspiratory, expiratory or biphasic. Inspiratory stridor is common. It can be indicative of serious airway obstruction from severe conditions such as epiglottitis, a foreign body lodged in the airway, or a laryngeal tumor. Stridor is indicative of a potential medical emergency and should always command attention. Wherever possible, attempts should be made to immediately establish the cause of the stridor (e.g., foreign body, vocal cord edema, tracheal compression by tumor, functional laryngeal dyskinesia, etc.) That examination requires visualization of the airway by a team of medical experts equipped to control the airway. A reduction in oxygen saturation is considered a late sign of airway obstruction, particularly in a child with healthy lungs and normal gas exchange. The first issue of clinical concern in the setting of stridor is whether or not tracheal intubation or tracheostomy is immediately necessary. Some patients will need immediate tracheal intubation. If intubation can be delayed for a period, a number of other potential options can be considered, depending on the severity of the situation and other clinical details. These include: In obese patients elevation of the panniculis has shown to relieve symptoms by 80%. Stridor may occur as a result of: Stridor is usually diagnosed on the basis of history and physical examination, with a view to revealing the underlying problem or condition. Chest and neck x-rays, bronchoscopy, CT-scans, and/or MRIs may reveal structural pathology. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy can also be very helpful, especially in assessing vocal cord function or in looking for signs of compression or infection.
