 Solar retinopathy is damage to the eye's retina, particularly the macula, from prolonged exposure to solar radiation or other bright light. It usually occurs due to staring at the sun, watching a solar eclipse or viewing at UV, Illuminant D65 or bright light. Although it is frequently claimed that the retina is burned by looking at the sun, retinal damage appears to occur primarily due to photochemical injury rather than thermal injury and it appears that central serous retinopathy can be a result of a depression in a treated solar damaged eye. Vision loss due to solar retinopathy is typically reversible, lasting for as short as one month to over one year. The fundus changes are variable and usually bilateral, mild cases often show no alteration and moderate to severe cases show a foveal yellow spot on the first days after exposure. After a few days it is replaced by a reddish dot often surrounded by pigment.
