 A hangover (medical terminology: veisalgia) is the experience of various unpleasant physiological effects following heavy consumption of alcoholic beverages. The most commonly reported characteristics of a hangover include headache, nausea, sensitivity to light and noise, lethargy, dysphoria, diarrhea and thirst, typically after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to wear off. While a hangover can be experienced at any time, generally a hangover is experienced the morning after a night of heavy drinking. In addition to the physical symptoms, a hangover may also induce psychological symptoms including heightened feelings of depression and anxiety. Hypoglycemia, dehydration, acetaldehyde intoxication, and glutamine rebound are all theorized causes of hangover symptoms. Hangover symptoms may persist for several days after alcohol was last consumed. Approximately 25-30% of drinkers may be resistant to hangover symptoms. Some aspects of a hangover are viewed as symptoms of acute ethanol withdrawal, similar to the longer-duration effects of withdrawal from alcoholism, as determined by studying the increases in brain reward thresholds in rats (the amount of current required to receive from two electrodes implanted in the lateral hypothalamus) following ethanol injection. Dehydration is caused by alcohol's ability to inhibit the effect of anti-diuretic hormone on kidney tubules, which leads to an interruption of the body's Krebs cycle and the swelling of the brain against the lining of the skull. Hangovers are caused by several factors. First, the body has to metabolize the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages: ethanol. This process requires cellular energy, distracting the body from normal activities like making glucose for the brain. Even after all the ethanol is metabolized, the by-products of this process can cause additional problems. Likewise, other substances in certain alcoholic beverages can make a hangover worse. Lastly, ethanol is a diuretic and can lead to dehydration. After being ingested, ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and then to acetic acid by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. These reactions also convert NAD+ to NADH. However, by causing a shortage of NAD+ and an excess of NADH, alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult. For example, excess NADH causes the important citric acid cycle to shut down by inhibiting three important enzymes (citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase). To correct this imbalance the body uses pyruvate and lactate dehydrogenase to convert the excess NADH back into NAD+. In the process, however, the body diverts pyruvate from other important pathways such as gluconeogenesis. This impares the ability of the liver to compensate for a drop in blood glucose levels, especially for the brain. Because glucose is the primary energy source of the brain, this lack of glucose (hypoglycemia) contributes to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, mood disturbances, and decreased attention and concentration. Alcohol consumption can result in depletion of the liver's supply of glutathione and other reductive detoxification agents, reducing its ability to effectively remove acetaldehyde and other toxins from the bloodstream. Additionally, alcohol induces the CYP2E1 enzyme, which itself can produce additional toxins and free radicals. Acetaldehyde, the first by-product of ethanol, is between 10 and 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself. In addition, certain genetic factors can amplify the negative effects of acetaldehyde. For example, East Asian people have a mutation in their alcohol dehydrogenase gene that makes this enzyme unusually fast at converting ethanol to acetaldehyde. Therefore, acetaldehyde accumulates faster in those people. In addition, about half of these people are slower at converting the acetaldehyde to acetic acid (via acetaldehyde dehydrogenase), causing the acetaldehyde to build-up even more. All together, this high acetaldehyde concentration causes the alcohol flush reaction. Since hangovers might be immediate and severe in some of these people, they are less likely to become alcoholics. Likewise, acetic acid (or the acetate ion) can cause additional problems. One study found that injecting sodium acetate into rats caused them to have nociceptive behavior (headaches). In addition, there is a biochemical explanation for this finding. High acetate levels cause adenosine to accumulate in many parts of the brain. But when the rats were given caffeine, which blocks the action of adensonine, they didn't get headaches anymore. In addition to ethanol and water, most alcoholic drinks also contain congeners, either as flavoring or as a by-product of fermentation. However, different types of alcohol contain different amounts of congeners. In general, dark liquors have a higher concentration while clear liquors have a lower concentration. Several studies have examined whether certain types of alcohol cause worse hangovers. All four studies concluded that darker liquors, which have higher congeners, produced worse hangovers. One even showed that hangover were worse and more frequent with darker liquors. In a 2006 study, an average of 14 standard drinks (330 ml) of beer was needed to produce a hangover, but only 7 to 8 drinks was required for wine or liquor. Another study ranked several drinks by their ability to cause a hangover (from low to high): distilled ethanol diluted with fruit juice, beer, vodka, gin, white wine, whisky, rum, red wine, and brandy.While congeners do cause hangovers, they don't effect how drunk the person becomes. One potent congener is methanol. It is naturally formed in small quantities during fermentation and it can be accidentally concentrated by improper distillation techniques. Metabolism of methanol produces an extremely toxic compound, formaldehyde; however, its metabolism is suppressed when ethanol is present in the bloodstream. Therefore, methanol is a likely cause of hangovers that begin when the person's blood alcohol level approaches zero. Incidentally, these hangovers can be "cured" by consuming more ethanol. Ethanol has a dehydrating effect by causing increased urine production (diuresis), which causes headaches, dry mouth, and lethargy. Dehydration also causes fluids in the brain to be less plentiful. This can be mitigated by drinking water before, during and after consumption of alcohol. Alcohol's effect on the stomach lining can account for nausea. In addition, it is often said that hangovers grow worse as one ages; this is thought to be caused by declining supplies of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in metabolizing alcohol. An alcohol hangover is associated with a variety of symptoms that may include dehydration, fatigue, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, weakness, elevated body temperature and heart rate, hypersalivation, difficulty concentrating, sweating, anxiety, dysphoria, irritability, sensitivity to light and noise, erratic motor functions (including tremor), trouble sleeping, severe hunger, halitosis, and lack of depth perception. Many people will also be repulsed by the thought, taste or smell of alcohol during a hangover. The symptoms vary significantly from person to person, and it is not clear whether hangovers directly affect cognitive abilities. Psychological research of alcohol hangover is growing rapidly. The Alcohol Hangover Research Group had its inaugural meeting in June 2010 as part of the Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) 33rd Annual Scientific Meeting in San Antonio, Texas. In 2010, researchers from the Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research at the University of Aarhus in Copenhagen charted how hangovers progress over time in the face of continued drinking. They found no evidence of hangover tolerance. Instead, they found that hangover symptoms became steadily worse over the course of one week. In 2012, Ã‰duc'alcool, a Quebec-based non-profit organization that aims to educate the public on the responsible use of alcohol, published a report noting hangovers have long-lasting effects that inhibit the drinker's capabilities a full 24 hours after heavy drinking. Hangovers are poorly understood from a medical point of view. Health care professionals prefer to study alcohol abuse from a standpoint of treatment and prevention, and there is a view that the hangover provides a useful, natural and intrinsic disincentive to excessive drinking. Within the limited amount of serious study on the subject, there is debate about whether a hangover may be prevented or at least mitigated; additionally, there is a vast body of folk medicine and simple quackery. There is currently no empirically proven mechanism for prevention except reducing the amount of ethanol consumed, or for making oneself sober other than waiting for the body to metabolize ingested alcohol, which occurs via oxidation through the liver before alcohol leaves the body. A four-page literature review in the British Medical Journal concludes: "No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. The most effective way to avoid the symptoms of alcohol induced hangover is to avoid drinking." Recommendations for foods, drinks and activities to relieve hangover symptoms abound. The ancient Romans, on the authority of Pliny the Elder, favored raw owl's eggs or fried canary, while the "Prairie Oyster" restorative, introduced at the 1878 Paris World Exposition, calls for raw egg yolk mixed with Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper. By 1938, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel provided a hangover remedy in the form of a mixture of Coca-Cola and milk (Coca-Cola itself having been invented, by some accounts, as a hangover remedy). Alcoholic writer Ernest Hemingway relied on tomato juice and beer. Certain mixtures were developed specifically for the purpose. The "Black Velvet" consists of equal parts champagne and flat Guinness Stout, A 1957 survey by a Wayne State University folklorist found widespread belief in the efficacy of heavy fried foods, tomato juice and sexual activity. Activities said to be restorative include a showerâ€”alternating very hot and very cold water, exercise, and steambath or sauna (although medical opinion holds this to be very dangerous, as the combination of alcohol and hyperthermia increases the likelihood of dangerous cardiac arrhythmias). Other untested or discredited treatments include:
