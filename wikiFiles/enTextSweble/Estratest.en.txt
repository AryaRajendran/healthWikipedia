 Estratest is a hormone replacement therapy drug that combines esterified estrogens with methyltestosterone in one pill. Estratest is used to treat menopausal women who suffer from hot flashes, but do not get relief from estrogen-only therapy. Estratest was first marketed in the United States in 1965 by Reid-Provident Laboratories, which as 100% of Reid-Rowell, Inc. stock was acquired by the Belgian pharmaceutical company Solvay in 1986. There has been some controversy surrounding the drug in recent years as to its status with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Solvay is sponsoring a clinical trial of Estratest in the United States to determine whether the product is superior to treatment with esterified estrogens tablets. Solvay announced it has discontinued supplying Estratest and Estratest HS, and will not fill new orders after March 31, 2009. Estratest is sold in tablet form, with either 1.25 mg estrogens/2.5 mg methyltestosterone or 0.625 mg estrogens/1.25 mg methyltestosterone available. Estratest was supplied by Solvay. In March 2009 Solvay announced that, based on a variety of business factors, it would discontinue supplying Estratest and Estratest HS tablets, and would stop accepting orders for the product on March 31, 2009.
