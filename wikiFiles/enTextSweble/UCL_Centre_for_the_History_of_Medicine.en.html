 The UCL Centre for the History of Medicine (formerly the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine) is an academic research and teaching centre for the history of medicine located in London, United Kingdom and a part of University College London (UCL). The Centre was founded in 1966 and received its primary funding from the Wellcome Trust until 2012. As of September 2012, it had four emeritus academic staff, six teaching staff, and associated staff in a number of other UCL departments. The Centre is based in the UCL Medical Sciences Building in the main UCL campus on Gower Street in the Bloomsbury area of Central London, close to the British Library and University College Hospital.

In 1993 the Centre started running a series of witness seminars to record medicine's key events. In February 2010 the centre was the first history unit in the world to be nominated for centre collaborative status with the World Health Organization. In April 2010 it was announced that the Wellcome Trust would not be renewing its grant for the Centre, and that it would therefore be closing within two years. On 15 March 2011 it was announced that the Centre would be relaunched as the UCL Centre for the History of Medicine for the 2011/2012 academic year.
