 According to the National Cancer Institute, the incidence of childhood cancers has increased over the past 20 years. New medical treatments and technologies are improving the survival rate of childhood cancers however, late effects of cancer and its treatments, particularly those involving learning and cognition, require further study. Research shows that children with cancer are at risk for developing various cognitive or learning problems. These difficulties may be related to brain injury stemming from the cancer itself, such as a brain tumor or central nervous system metastasis or from side effects of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Studies have shown that chemo and radiation therapies may damage brain white matter and disrupt brain activity. Cognitive problems that have been associated with cancer and its treatments in children include deficits in attention, working memory, processing speed, mental flexibility, persistence, verbal fluency, memory, motor skills, academic achievement and social function. These deficits have been shown to occur irrespective of age, socioeconomic status, months since onset or cessation of treatment, anxiety, fatigue and dosage schedule. As survival among children treated for cancer continues to improve, more attention is being focussed on the late effects of cancer treatment. In children treated for brain tumours, chronic neurocognitive effects are especially challenging. Deficits in cognitive development have been described most thoroughly among children treated for posterior-fossa tumours, specifically medulloblastomas and ependymomas, which account for about 30% of all newly diagnosed cases of brain tumours in children. Most children who have survived brain tumours have required surgical resection and focal or craniospinal radiotherapy (irradiation of the entire subarachnoid volume of the brain and spine), with or without systemic chemotherapy. Historically, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores have provided a benchmark against which to measure changes in cognitive development after treatment. Observed declines in IQ are most likely a result of failure to learn at a rate that is appropriate for the age of the child, rather than from a loss of previously acquired knowledge. The rate of IQ decline is associated with a several risk factors, including younger age at time of treatment, longer time since treatment, female sex, as well as clinical variables such as hydrocephalus, use of radiotherapy and radiotherapy dose, and the volume of the brain that received treatment. Loss of cerebral white matter and failure to develop white matter at a rate appropriate to the developmental stage of the child could partly account for changes in IQ score. Technical advances in radiotherapy hold promise for lowering the frequency of neurocognitive sequelae. Further efforts to limit neurocognitive sequelae have included design of clinical trials to test the effectiveness of cognitive, behavioural, and pharmacological interventions. Some clinicians and research groups in neuropsychology are developing programs to help treat the cognitive problems associated with childhood cancer. Treatment typically involves a program of cognitive rehabilitation which aims to help improve cognitive function either by restoring capacities that were impaired and/or helping the patient learn ways to compensate for the impairment(s). Cognitive rehabilitation therapy usually involves evaluation to determine the specific impairments involved, an individualized program of specific skills training and practice and metacognitive strategies. Metacognitive strategies include helping the patient increase self-awareness regarding problem solving skills by learning how to better monitor the effectiveness of these skills and self-correct when necessary. Cognitive rehabilitation is conducted under the supervision of a neuropsychologist or other trained professional. Brain injury rehabilitation involves two essential processes: restoration of functions that can be restored and learning how to do things differently when functions cannot be restored to pre-injury level. Brain injury rehabilitation is is based on the nature and scope of neuropsychological symptoms identified on special batteries of test designed to measure brain functioning following brain injury. While practice in various cognitive tasks--doing arithmetic problems, solving logic puzzles, concentration skills, or reading--may help brain rehabilitation, this is usually not enough. Brain injury rehabilitation must be designed taking into account a broad range of neuro-functional strengths and weaknesses. Basic skills must be strengthened before more complex skills are added. Only through comprehensive neuropsychological analysis can the many possible effects of brain injury be sorted out. This pattern of functional strengths and weaknesses becomes the foundation for designing a program of brain rehabilitation. Brain recovery follows patterns of brain development. Gross or large-scale systems must develop (or be retrained) before fine systems. Attention, focus, and perceptual skills develop (or are retrained) before complex intellectual activity can be successful. Although a number of investigators have begun to examine the effects of childhood cancer on the family, the relationship between family adjustment and long-term psychosocial outcome is not well understood. The present study explored the relationship betwecn various facets of adaptation to cancer and psychosocial outcome variables asscssed in survivorhood. For 7- four children and their parents were asscssed two years after the children had completed treatment. Parental reactions to the child's illness were related to a variety of psychosocial variables. Most important, parental coping was associated with the long-term adjustment of both parents and child. Also, the amount of emotional distress that parents ex erienced was related to their ability to establish and maintain socially supportive ties with other people. When a child is diagnosed with cancer, the family experiences great stress and disruption to daily life. As part of a national study in New Zealand, we evaluated the mental health of mothers and fathers of children with cancer, making comparisons to parents of children from the general population. This was a cross-sectional study. All children diagnosed with cancer at ages 0–14 years in New Zealand during a defined period were ascertained from the national cancer registry and other databases. The population-based comparison children were selected using national birth records. Parents from both groups completed self-administered questionnaires containing the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and other measures. The analyses included 218 mothers and 179 fathers of children with cancer, and 266 mothers and 224 fathers of children in the comparison group. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, life events, and social support. Mothers and fathers of children with cancer had poorer GHQ-12 and mood rating scores than those of controls. The adjusted difference in the mean total GHQ-12 score (comparing mothers of children with cancer to mothers of controls) was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.3–3.2). The 12 items of the GHQ were each scored 0–3, and the total score was the sum, so 2 points is a small difference. For fathers the difference was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.6–2.4). Some subgroups of cancer group parents had poorer emotional health scores than others, including those with poor social support and no paid employment and also those who were bereaved. We found statistically significant but small differences between the mental health of parents of children with cancer and controls. The small differences suggest that as a group the parents of children with cancer are relatively resilient. Med. Pediatr.
