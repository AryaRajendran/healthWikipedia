 Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O. or DO) is a professional doctoral degree for physicians offered by medical schools in the United States. Holders of the D.O. degree are known as osteopathic physicians and have the same rights, privileges, and responsibilities as physicians with a Doctor of Medicine degree (M.D.). D.O. physicians are licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in all 50 states, and make up 7 percent of the total U.S. physician population. There are over 77,784 D.O. physicians in the United States, of which 69,429 are in active practice. Currently, there are 29 medical schools with 37 locations throughout the United States that offer the D.O. degree, and 141 medical schools that offer the M.D. degree. As of 2011, 1 in 5 medical students in the United States were D.O. students. The curricula at osteopathic medical schools are very similar to those at M.D.-granting medical schools. Four years in total length, the first two years of medical school focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences, followed by two years of core clinical training in the clinical specialties. One notable difference in the education at D.O.-granting medical schools is the inclusion of 300 – 500 additional hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system. This training, referred to as osteopathic manipulative medicine, is absent in the M.D. curricula. Upon graduation from medical school, osteopathic physicians enter internship or residency training programs, which may be followed by fellowship training. Many D.O. physicians attend the same graduate medical education programs as their M.D. counterparts, and then take M.D. specialty board exams, while other D.O. graduates enter osteopathic programs and take D.O. specialty board examinations. However, as of June 2015, all post-graduate training for both D.O. and M.D. physicians will be accredited by the ACGME. In the United States, there are over 77,784 osteopathic physicians; of which 69,429 are in active practice. Osteopathic medical school curricula are virtually identical to those at schools granting the Doctor of Medicine M.D. degree. Once admitted to an osteopathic medical school, it takes about four years to graduate, and the schooling is roughly divided into the pre-clinical and clinical years. The pre-clinical years, the first and second years, focus on the biomedical and clinical sciences. The clinical years, the third and fourth years, consist of core clinical training in the clinical specialties. Osteopathic medical school accreditation standards require training in internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, family practice, surgery, psychiatry, emergency medicine, radiology, preventive medicine and public health. According to Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, "the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of physicians with M.D. qualifications, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and [board] certification." However, D.O. schools provide an additional 300 – 500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system, which is referred to as osteopathic manipulative medicine. After completing medical school, D.O. physicians begin graduate medical training. Many D.O. physicians attend the same internship and residency training programs as their M.D. counterparts, and then take M.D. specialty board exams while other D.O. graduates enter osteopathic internships and residencies and take D.O. specialty board examinations. Some authors note the differences in the average GPA and MCAT scores of students who matriculate at D.O. schools versus those who matriculate at M.D. schools within the United States. In 2011, the average MCAT and GPA for students entering U.S.-based M.D. programs were 31.1 and 3.67, respectively, and 26.51 and 3.50 for D.O. matriculants, although the gap has been getting smaller every year. Up to one third of students matriculating at a D.O. medical school were not accepted by M.D. programs; however, DO medical schools are more likely to accept non-traditional students who are older and entering medicine as a second career, or coming from non-science majors. D.O. medical students are required to take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination (COMLEX-USA) that is sponsored by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME). This exam is a prerequisite for osteopathic residency programs, which are available in almost every specialty of medicine and surgery. D.O. medical students may also choose to sit for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) if they wish to take an M.D. residency; however, if they have taken COMLEX, it may or may not be needed, depending on the individual institution’s program requirements. First-time USMLE pass rates for D.O. and M.D. students in 2011 are as follows: Step 1: 89% and 94%, Step 2 CK: 93% and 97%, and Step 2 CS: 93% and 97% respectively; Step 3: 94% and 100%--but this number may be misleading, as 18 D.O. students compared to 18,314 M.D. students, were evaluated for Step 3. To obtain a license to practice medicine in the United States, medical students must pass the COMLEX (Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Exam), which is the exam given by the licensing board at the conclusion of their medical training. Students are given the option of taking the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Exam) to apply for some Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) residency programs. Those that have received or are in the process of earning an M.D. or D.O. are both eligible to sit for the USMLE. Because of their additional training, only holders of the D.O. are eligible to sit for the COMLEX. Upon completion of internship and residency requirements for their chosen medical specialty, and depending on whether the program attended as ACGME or AOA accredited, holders of the D.O. may elect to be board certified by either a specialty board (through the American Medical Association's American Board of Medical Specialties) or an osteopathic specialty board (through the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists certifying boards). Depending on the state, medical licensure may be issued from a combined board (D.O. and M.D.) or a separate board of medical examiners. All of the 70 state medical boards are members of the Federation of State Medical Boards. Currently, there are no osteopathic programs located outside of the United States that would qualify an individual to practice as an osteopathic physician in the United States. Foreign osteopathic degrees are not recognized by any state in the U.S. as being equivalent to American D.O. degrees.
