 The posterior triangle (or lateral cervical region) is a region of the neck. It has the following boundaries: Apex: Union of the sternocleidomastoid and the trapezius muscles at the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone Anterior: Posterior border of the sternocleidomastoideus Posterior: Anterior border of the trapezius Base: Middle one third of the clavicle The posterior triangle is crossed, about 2.5Â cm above the clavicle, by the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle, which divides the space into two triangles: A) Nerves and Plexuses: B) Vessels: C) Lymph Nodes: D) Muscles: The accessory nerve (CN XI) is particularly vulnerable to damage during lymph node biopsy. Damage results in an inability to shrug the shoulders or raise the arm above the head (e.g., for brushing hair), particularly due to compromised trapezius muscle innervation. The external jugular vein's superficial location within the posterior triangle also makes it vulnerable to injury.
