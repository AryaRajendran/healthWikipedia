 The Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) is a form of health insurance coverage offered to uninsured Americans who have been unable to obtain coverage because of a pre-existing health condition. The PCIP will provide coverage to as many as 350,000 people and fill the gap until the Affordable Care Act goes into effect in 2014. The plan has been funded by congress through the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor and distribute. States are either individually run or administered by HHS with 23 states and the District of Columbia. The plan is open through an Association (GEHA) or Government Employees Health Association. The program has since ceased in order to make certain funding would be sufficient to carry the existing approximately one hundred thousand (100,000) members it has taken on since PCIP inception. Federal states ended February 16, 2013 and the other states end date is March 2, 2013 cutoff. To be eligible, patients must have a pre-existing condition, been uninsured for at least 6 months, and must be a U.S. citizen or a legal resident. The Affordable Care Act provides federal funding to support Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plans in every state and downloadable applications are available in the states where the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is running the PCIP. In those states, coverage will begin on August 1, 2010 for applicants who apply by July 15, 2010. The Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plans are designed to provide affordable insurance to Americans with pre-existing conditions. The premiums for the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plans will be based on the standard cost of an individual health insurance policy in the health insurance poolâ€™s geographic area and out-of-pocket maximums are limited to $5,950 for individuals and $11,900 for families. Pcip is not accepting new patients until further notice.
