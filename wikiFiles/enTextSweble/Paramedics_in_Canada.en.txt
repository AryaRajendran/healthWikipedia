 In Canada the paramedic or registered paramedic (RP, RPCP, RACP, RCCP) is a healthcare professional, providing pre-hospital assessment and medical care to the victims of illnesses or injuries. The term is generally limited to include those who work on ambulances providing emergency medical services. In Canada, the term 'paramedic' is used generically, to refer to anyone who works on a land or air ambulance. This may not be completely accurate as paramedics are increasingly being utilized in emergency rooms as supervisors or providing patient care in collaboration with physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and registered nurses. Increasingly in Canada, paramedics are becoming self-regulated health professionals, operating and regulated in the same manner as nurses, physiotherapists, etc. Paramedic training in Canada is intense, as paramedics are seen as medical professionals. Nevertheless, the nature of training and how it is regulated, like actual paramedic practice, varies from province to province. Paramedics take on many medically delegated acts that can be provided in the field. In Ontario Paramedics perform more delegated medical acts than all other health care professions, besides a physician. However, the authorization of delegated medical acts vary province to province. Paramedic education varies regionally, for example, the primary care paramedic program may be six months (British Columbia), eleven months in Manitoba and two years to four years in Ontario. Training as an advanced care paramedic (ACP) requires that the student be first qualified as a primary care paramedic. Eligibility for ACP training varies from immediate entry following PCP qualification to a mandatory period of experience working as a PCP for usually one to three years. The length of time required to complete ACP training also varies between provinces, and it is generally inversely related to the length of time required to have completed the prerequisite PCP training. Shorter (around one year) programs build upon the education already learned in a 2 year PCP training program, while longer (typically up to two years) college programs typically cater to PCP who graduated from shorter PCP programs. Thus, while there is continual debate on the merits of longer or shorter PCP programs (often centered around teaching philosophy), in common, ACPs across Canada will generally have completed approximately 3 years of intense formal education, inclusive of didactic study and clinical placements. There is a bachelor of paramedicine currently available in Canada although seldomly available. There is emerging interest toward further development of a degree required for practice as paramedics. Paramedics are increasingly becoming involved in medical, health related and trauma research. This would be similar to when nursing moved from the college based program to the collaborative or university based program in Canada. These programs are often offered through partnerships between Canadian universities and community colleges, blending vocational training with higher education. The accreditation of paramedic educational programs in Canada also varies from province to province. The Canadian Medical Association's Committee on Conjoint Accreditation offers the most comprehensive and best known system of national accreditation. Their accreditation model is an independent body, and draws from The "National Occupational Competency Profile" as the benchmark document that details the knowledge, skills and abilities outcomes that must be possessed by practitioners of each respective level of paramedic practice. In Canada the scope of practice of paramedics is described by the National Occupational Competency Profile (NOCP) for Paramedics document developed by the Paramedic Association of Canada with financial support from the Government of Canada. The NOCP outlines four provider levels: Emergency Medical Responder *not a paramedic (EMR), Primary Care Paramedic (PCP), Advanced Care Paramedic (ACP), and Critical Care Paramedic (CCP) Under the new NOCP most providers that work in ambulances will be identified as 'paramedics'. However, in some cases, the most prevalent level of emergency prehospital care is that which is provided by the emergency medical responder (EMR) which is not a 'paramedic'. This is a level of practice recognized under the National Occupational Competency Profile. As a group, EMRs staff rural ambulance stations, community volunteer ambulance services, and for many small communities, without this level of certification, the operation of a much-needed small community ambulance system might not be possible. EMRs across Canada contribute an important role in the chain of survival. It is a level of practice that is least comprehensive (clinically speaking), and is also generally not consistent with any medical acts beyond advanced first-aid, with the possible exception of automated external defibrillation, which is still a regulated medical act in Canada, although one which is increasingly delegated to the general public. Of considerable relevance to understanding the nature of Canadian paramedic practice, the reader must appreciate the considerable degree of inter-provincial variation. Although a national consensus (by way of the National Occupational Competency Profile) identifies certain knowledge, skills, and abilities as being most synonymous with a given level of paramedic practice, each province retains ultimate authority in legislating the actual administration and delivery of emergency medical services within its own borders. For this reason, any discussion of paramedic practice in Canada is necessarily broad, and general. Specific regulatory frameworks and questions related to paramedic practice can only definitively be answered by consulting relevant provincial legislation, although provincial paramedic associations may often offer a simpler overview of this topic when it is restricted to a province-by-province basis. Regulatory frameworks vary from province to province, and include direct government regulation (such as Ontario's method of credentialing its practitioners with the title of A-EMCA, or Advanced Emergency Medical Care Assistant) to professional self-regulating bodies, such as the Alberta College of Paramedics. Though the title of paramedic is a generic description of a category of practitioners, provincial variability in regulatory methods accounts for ongoing differences in actual titles that are ascribed to different levels of practitioners. For example, the province of Alberta uses the title "emergency medical technician", or 'EMT' for the PCPs and 'paramedic' only for those qualified as ACPs, meaning Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers. Almost all provinces, however, are gradually moving to adopting the new titles, or have at least recognized the NOCP document as a benchmarking document to permit inter-provincial labour mobility of practitioners, regardless of how titles are specifically regulated within their own provincial systems. In this manner, the confusing myriad of titles and occupational descriptions can at least be discussed using a common language for the sake of comparison. Although there is a great deal of variation in what paramedics in Canada are trained and permitted to do from province to province, these are the baseline skills performed by all paramedics in Canada: Primary Care Paramedics (PCPs) are the entry-level of paramedic practice in Canadian provinces. The scope of practice includes performing semi-automated external defibrillation, interpretation of a 12 lead ECG, depending on the area. Administration of Symptom Relief Medications for a variety of emergency medical conditions (these include oxygen, epinephrine, antihistamine, salbutamol, ipratropium bromide, aspirin, nitroglycerine, naloxone, dextrose, thiamine, glucagon, Gravol, Benadryl and nitrous oxide), performing trauma immobilization, including cervical immobilization, and other basic medical care. PCPs may also receive additional training in order to perform certain skills that are normally in the scope of practice of ACPs. This is regulated both provincially (by statute) and locally (by the medical director), and ordinarily entails an aspect of medical oversight by a specific body or group of physicians. This is often referred to as medical control, and is the role played by a base hospital. For example, in the provinces of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia paramedic services allow PCPs to perform 12-lead ECG interpretation, or initiate intravenous therapy, or to deliver a few additional medications, such as 50% Dextrose, ASA, Nitroglycerin, Epinephrine, Ventolin, and Glucagon. Patients requiring the need of an Advanced Care Paramedic will, for the most part, have a PCP providing the initial assessment, treatment and often transport to hospital. Image:BC Ambulance.jpg Image:Eru tahoe 2003.jpg Image:Montreal Ambulance.jpg The ACP is a level of practitioner that is in high demand by many ambulance services across Canada. However, still not all provinces and jurisdictions have ACPs (Quebec, New Brunswick). The ACP typically carries approximately 20 different medications, although the number and type of medications may vary substantially from region to region. ACPs perform advanced airway management including intubation, surgical airways, intravenous therapy, place external jugular IV lines, perform needle thoracotomy, perform and interpret 12-lead ECGs, perform synchronized and chemical cardioversion, transcutaneous pacing, perform obstetrical assessments, provide pharmacological chemical pain relief for various conditions, and reverse hypoglycemic states. Several sites in Canada have experimented with pre-hospital fibrinolytics and rapid sequence induction, and prehospital medical research has permitted a great number of variations in the scope of practice for ACPs. Current programs include providing ACPs with discretionary direct 24-hour access to PCI labs, bypassing the emergency department, and representing a fundamental change in both the way that patients with S-T segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) are treated, but also profoundly affecting survival rates. as well as bypassing a closer hospitals to get an identified stroke patient to a stroke centre. Critical Care Paramedics (CCPs) are paramedics who generally do not respond to 9-1-1 emergency calls, with the exception of helicopter "scene" calls. Instead they focus on transferring patients from the hospital they are currently in to other hospitals that can provide a higher level of care. When CCPs are not available, it is usually necessary to have some combination of nurse, and/or respiratory therapist accompany acute patients on inter-facility transfers. Having CCPs provide care to the patient allows the sending hospital to avoid 'losing' their staff on long transfers. CCPs are able to provide all of the care that PCPs and ACPs provide. That being said, CCPs significantly lack practical experience with advanced skills such as IV initiation, peripheral access to cardiovascular system for fluid and drug administration, advanced airway, and many other techniques. Where an PCP and ACP may run 40-50 medical codes per year a CCP may run 1-2 in an entire career. IV/IO starts are nearly non-existent in the field and for this reason CCPs are required to attend nearly double the amount of time in classroom situations or in hospital to keep current. In addition to this they are trained for other skills such as medication infusion pumps, mechanical ventillation and arterial line monitoring. CCPs often work in fixed and rotary wing aircraft when the weather permits and staff are available, but systems such as the Toronto EMS Critical Care Transport Program work in land ambulances. ORNGE Transport operates both land and aircraft in Ontario. In British Columbia, CCP's work primarily in aircraft with a dedicated Critical Care Transport crew in Trail for long-distance transfers and a regular CCP street crew stationed in South Vancouver that often also performs medevacs, when necessary. Image:STARSFMC.jpg Image:On scene.jpg File:BC Ambulance Service Helijet.jpg Most jurisdictions in Canada, paramedics do not work under their own medical license. One exception is in British Columbia where each paramedic regardless of level, has their own license to practice. Even so, they, as most other paramedics in Canada, are permitted to perform regulated medical acts by the process of 'delegation'. This means that one medical doctor (the medical director) has become familiar with the individual paramedic and then has delegated authority to that paramedic which allows them to perform specific regulated medical act under defined situations. The scope of practice for the paramedic is defined in paramedic protocols (also referred to as advanced medical directives). These protocols specify which skill and the conditions required for the paramedic to act. Each protocol is signed by the medical director. Medical directors are generally ER physicians who work in a hospital associated with the paramedic service. The relationship between this hospital ('Base Hospital') is formalized through legal agreements. Other physicians in the base hospital who are allowed to give direct orders to paramedics that exceed their protocols (often via telephone) are referred to as delegating physicians. These physicians are usually ER physicians. The British Columbia Ambulance Service is moving away from protocols and towards a process called treatment guidelines allowing much more flexibility at all levels when a patient's condition warrants. Some Canadian paramedics are moving towards the status of self-regulated health professionals with paramedics forming their own professional Colleges in much the same manner as nurses and other health professions. These organizations are responsible to the government for the examination and licensing of practitioners, the establishment of standards of practice, the investigation of public complaints against members, and the disciplining of members. They are also required to advise the government on all issues and legislation related to the practice of their members. Following the example of their British colleagues, Colleges or Associations have been established in Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, with Ontario actively moving towards this type of legislation. Paramedics have a close relationship with the physicians who (in most systems) grant paramedics the legal right to practice their profession with a regulated paramedic service. Some systems in Canada are transitioning to a self regulated organization, where medical authority dervies directly from legislation and self-regulation rather than the approval of a medical doctor. Also, because physician assistants in Canada exist primarily in the Canadian Forces, the role of clinical paramedic practitioners is under serious study. Both urban and rural centres have begun utilizing paramedics working in-hospital on cardiac arrest teams, patient transfer teams, emergency department triage/treatment and to facilitate faster "off-load" times. Some hospitals in Alberta and Saskatchewan have engaged paramedics to supervise Emergency Rooms in the place of Medical Doctors because of their ability to independently determine a patients immediate health status and direct the rest of the healthcare team in patient care. Similarly, community outreach programs led by paramedics, such as providing tuberculosis screening and influenza vaccinations to the homeless, are becoming more common. In Halifax, NS, ACPs and CCPs work side by side with physicians in various emergency departments within the Capital District Health Authority. The responsibilities of these department paramedics varies from ER to ER within CDHA but include advanced airway stabilization, suturing, minor treatment as well as other expanded paramedic roles such as procedural sedations. They have also proven a necessary and integral member of the cardiac arrest and trauma teams. PCPs have been employed by CDHA since the early 1990s to perform triage assessments. Paramedics often work long hours, most with 12 hour shifts. In some areas, however, 24 and even 96 hour shifts are not unusual. Salary and benefits are generally commensurate with the level of education and certification, though often less than the salary expectations of police officers and firefighters, as well as nurses. This incongruity is often argued as being unfair, especially in light of the relative level of responsibility a paramedic may have for acting decisively and without having direct supervision. However, many paramedics consider their career to offer intangible benefits and reported job satisfaction is generally high. Paramedics in Canada generally work only as paramedics, and only rarely as cross-trained firefighters or police officers, and most are paid full or part-time professionals. In the first quarter of 2005, paramedics were granted status federally as a "Public Safety Occupation" which means that paramedics are now eligible for early retirement, as are police officers and fire fighters. Many EMS agencies run a full range of paramedic speciality squads including: Marine medics, Bike medics, First Response medics, Tactical ERT & CCU medics, CBRNe medics (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive) and USAR medics (Urban Search And Rescue - specializing in urban disaster rescue recovery) and finally NOHERT medics (members of Provincial or regional Health Emergency Response Teams) Paramedic wages in Canada vary depending on province and experience. Paramedics in Ontario in such regions or cities as Ottawa, Toronto, Peel Region, or Durham, will have an annual salary starting from $65,000 to $75,000 as a Primary Care Paramedic, an Advanced Care Paramedic salary can on average range from $80,000 to $100,000, and Critical Care Paramedics range from $95,000 to $120,000. Education background, experience, and level of practice all are contributing factors to which salary is established. Many of the paramedics in Alberta are employed by Albert Health Services EMS, and unionized under HSAA. Typical starting annual salaries for an Alberta paramedic working for AHSEMS is $70,000. Oilfield operations also employs a large portion of paramedic practitioners, with a typical daily wage of $650. There is a high demand for paramedics and EMTs in Saskatchewan, mainly rural regions. The reason is paramedics are on call for a certain amount of hours at a time, making a salary around $30 an hour.
