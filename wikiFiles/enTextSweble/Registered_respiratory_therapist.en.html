 A Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) is a certification for respiratory practitioners. In the United States the certificate for the RRT is issued by the National Board for Respiratory Care after passing the NBRC-WRE and NBRC-CSE examinations. Eligibility for the NBRC RRT examinations are both previously passing the entry-level examination for the certification of Certified Respiratory Therapist, the NBRC-ELE, and holding at least an Associate of Science in Respiratory Care. In Canada the RRT certification is granted by examination from the Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists. Internationally respiratory care is governed by local governments and certification or license to practice as a respiratory practitioner is managed locally without the use of separate organizations as in the United States and Canada. The Registered Respiratory Therapist is typically governed by their medical direction for clinical services and their licensing body for laboratory, rehabilitation and home-health services. Trained in cardiology and pulmonology medicine. The registered respiratory therapist is prepared didactically and clinically to perform advanced procedures and emergency management. Actual scope of practice varies by region and institution.
