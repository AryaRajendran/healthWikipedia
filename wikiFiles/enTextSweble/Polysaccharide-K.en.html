 Polysaccharide-K (Krestin, PSK) is a protein-bound polysaccharide, which is utilized as an anticancer immunologic adjuvant in some countries. Japan began using PSK in 1977 and it is presently covered by government health insurance. PSK is isolated from the fruitbody of Trametes versicolor. Preliminary evidence indicates PSK has anticancer activity in vitro, in vivo and in human clinical trials. Preliminary research has also demonstrated that PSK may inhibit various cancer onset mechanisms. Preliminary evidence indicates PSK may have use as an adjuvant in the treatment of gastric, esophageal, colorectal, breast and lung cancers. Human clinical trials suggest PSK may affect cancer recurrence when used as an adjuvant, and basic research has demonstrated it inhibited certain human cancer cell lines in vitro. The MD Anderson Cancer Center reported that it is a "promising candidate for chemoprevention due to the multiple effects on the malignant process, limited side effects and safety of daily oral doses for extended periods of time." The Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia reported that the WHO has only eight records of adverse effects with PSK and none reported for PSP. In conjunction with chemotherapy, PSK has increased the survival time of cancer patients in randomized, control studies, with stomach cancer (meta-analysis of 8,009 patients), colorectal cancer (randomized, controlled study of 448 patients), non-small cell lung carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma of the lungs. PSK has produced mixed results with breast cancer, liver cancer, and leukemia. Research has shown PSK can help to restore the immune system of immuno-deficient animals, and in vitro research indicates PSK may enhance the activity of doxorubicin and etoposide. PSK is a protein polysaccharide consisiting of a beta-glucan β-1,4 main chain with β-1,3 and β-1,6 side chains. The approximate molecular weight of PSK is 100,000 Da, and the protein component is reported at the β-1,6 side chain. PSK is isolated from the "CM-101" strain of Trametes versicolor. The analogous compound PSP, is derived from the "COV-1" strain of Trametes versicolor.
