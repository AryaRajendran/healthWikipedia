 The Little Foundation is a London based charity operating internationally.

The charity, founded in 1990 by the late Ian Dawson-Shepherd, initially focused on funding research into the causes of cerebral palsy but now has broader objectives seeking to fund research into not only the causes and prevention of cerebral palsy but also allied disorders which include autism, dyslexia, epilepsy, deafness and blindness, learning difficulties, and other forms of neurodevelopmental disorder.
