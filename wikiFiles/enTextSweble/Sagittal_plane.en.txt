 Sagittal plane is a vertical plane which passes from ventral (front) to dorsal (rear) dividing the body into right and left halves. Examples include: The term sagittal is derived from the Latin word Sagitta, meaning "arrow". An image of an arrow piercing a body and passing from front (anterior) to back (posterior) on a parabolic trajectory would be one way to demonstrate the derivation of the term. Another explanation would be the notching of the sagittal suture posteriorly by the lambdoidal suture â€”similar to feathers on an arrow.
