 A Soft tissue injury (STI) is the damage of muscles, ligaments and tendons throughout the body. Common soft tissue injuries usually occur from a sprain, strain, a one off blow resulting in a contusion or overuse of a particular part of the body. Soft tissue injuries can result in pain, swelling, bruising and loss of function (Lovering, 2008). Immediately after the injury occurs one should apply the RICE principle to minimize the local tissue damage and reduce inflammation. ’R’est ’I’ce ’C’ompression ‘E’levation ’PROTECTION’ Protect the individual from further injury by preventing them from moving and keep further hazards away from the individual (Flegel, 2004). ‘REST’ Rest the individual from any activity that causes pain. If simple movements such as bending, straightening or walking are causing pain ‘’rest’’ means immobilizing the injury by splinting or preventing weight bearing with crutches is essential (Flegel, 2004). If walking does not cause any pain, continue to walk for short distances as comfort allows (Lindsay, Watson, Hickmott, Broadfoot & Bruynel, 1994). ’ICE’ During the first 72 hours following an injury ice can help minimize pain and control swelling caused by bleeding and fluid loss from the injured tissue (Flegel, 2004). Icing is recommended for 15minutes every 4 hours to help control the swelling and pain (Subotnick, 1991). ‘COMPRESSION’ Compression is the application of pressure over the injured area with the use of a bandage, elastic wrap or compression tape (Lindsay et al., 1994). This is to control the initial bleeding of joint or limb tissues, or to reduce residual swelling (Flegel, 2004). It is vital that compression is applied within the first few minutes following the injury to see the benefits (Lindsay et al., 1994). ‘ELEVATION’ Used in combination with ice and compression, elevation can also minimize initial tissue bleeding and swelling. Elevate the injured part above the level of the heart as much as possible for the first 72hours, or longer of the swelling persists. (Flegel, 2004). If severe pain persists after the first 24hours it is recommended that an individual consults with a professional who can make a diagnosis and implement a treatment plan so the patient can return to everyday activities (Flegel, 2004). These are some of the tools that a professional can use to help make a full diagnosis; Nerve conduction studies may also be used to localize nerve dysfunction (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), assess severity, and help with prognosis. Electrodiagnosis also helps differentiate between myopathy and neuropathy. Ultimately, the best method of imaging soft tissue is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), though it is cost-prohibitive and carries a high false positive rate. Flegel, M.J. (2004).
