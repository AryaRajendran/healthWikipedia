 Flupentixol (INN), also known as flupenthixol (former BAN), marketed under brand names such as Depixol and Fluanxol, is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as Anxiset, Deanxit, Mixit, a combination product containing both melitracen and flupentixol. Flupentixol is not approved for use in the United States. It is also available under the name anxistream. Flupentixol's main use is as a long-acting injection given once in every two or three weeks to individuals with schizophrenia who have poor compliance with medication and suffer frequent relapses of illness. Flupentixol is also used in low doses as an antidepressant. Flupentixol acts as an antagonist at various dopamine (D1-D5), serotonin (5-HT2), adrenaline (Î±1), and histamine (H1) receptors, without affecting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Its antipsychotic effects are likely caused by D2 and/or 5-HT2A antagonism, whereas its antidepressant effects at lower doses may be mediated by preferential D2/D3 autoreceptor blockade, resulting in increased postsynaptic activation. The side effects of flupentixol are similar to most other typical antipsychotics, namely extrapyramidal symptoms of akathisia, muscle tremors, and rigidity and antihistamine effects like sedation and somnolence. However, it lacks anticholinergic adverse effects.
