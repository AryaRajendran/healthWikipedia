 Race for Life is a series of fundraising events for women only, organised by the British charity, Cancer Research UK. They involve running, jogging or walking a 5-kilometre course and raising sponsorship for doing so. The money raised funds cancer research in all 200 types of cancer, however, none of the money from the entry fee (£14.99 for adults and £10 for children in 2012) actually benefits Cancer Research UK, only the additional sponsorship raised by participants. Following complaints from John Taylor, the 5K Run for Moore was launched - see Run for Moore Race for Life was conceived, designed and launched by Jim Cowan specifically for raising awareness of women's cancers. The first Race for Life event took place in 1994 when 680 participants participated in a race in Battersea Park, London and raised £36,000. Race for Life has subsequently grown to become one of the UK's largest fundraising events, which in 2006 involved 240 races, 750,000 participants and raised £46 million. Since Race for Life began in 1994, 6 million participants across the UK have raised over £493 million for the charity. Notable participants include Jane Tomlinson, whose first fundraising event was a Race for Life in 2001 after being diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. She went on to raise over £1.75 million for charity before her death in 2007. In 2009 actresses Laila Morse and Lynda Bellingham became a Race for Life ambassadors in memory of Wendy Richard and Jade Goody, both of whom had recently died from cancer. The rules were amended in 2012 to allow boys up to age 11 to participate following a determined campaign by Claire Parker - see http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/local/we-ve-won-1-4442686#.T7jGE-C0_cK.facebook Following complaints from John Taylor, stressing that the (5K Race for Life) was in breach of "Section 29 of the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act", which stated it was illegal to discriminate in the provision of Goods, Facilities and Services, the Equal Opportunities Commission wrote to Cancer Research UK which then launched the (5K Run for Moore).Kate Bracken See http://www.gazetteherald.co.uk/archive/2006/02/16/Ryedale+Archive/6670131.Men_urged_to_run_for_their_rights/ The proceeds from this event only went towards bowel cancer research and campaigns and the venture was discontinued in 2010.
