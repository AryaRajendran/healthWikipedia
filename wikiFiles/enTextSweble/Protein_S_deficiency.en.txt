 Protein S deficiency is a disorder associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis. Protein S, a vitamin K-dependent physiological anticoagulant, acts as a nonenzymatic cofactor to activated protein C in the proteolytic degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Decreased (antigen) levels or impaired function (activity) of protein S leads to decreased degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa and an increased propensity to venous thrombosis. Protein S circulates in human plasma in two forms: approximately 60 percent is bound to complement component C4b Î²-chain while the remaining 40 percent is free. Only free protein S has activated protein C cofactor activity. There are three types of hereditary protein S deficiency: Protein S deficiency can also be acquired due to vitamin K deficiency or treatment with warfarin, systemic sex hormone therapy and pregnancy, liver disease, and certain chronic infections (for example HIV). Vitamin K deficiency or treatment with warfarin generally also impairs the coagulation system itself (factors II, VII, IX and X), and therefore predisposes to bleeding rather than thrombosis. Protein S deficiency is the underlying cause of a small proportion of cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). ERRR.^^
