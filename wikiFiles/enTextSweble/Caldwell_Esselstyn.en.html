 Caldwell Blakeman Esselstyn Jr., M.D., (born December 12, 1933) is an American physician, author, and former Olympic rowing champion. He is the author of the 2007 book Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease that argues for plant-based, whole foods, no-oil nutrition. The book influenced former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Esselstyn starred in the 2011 American documentary, Forks Over Knives. Caldwell Esselstyn was born in New York, New York in 1933. He grew up on a cattle farm in upstate New York and attended public schools. He attended Deerfield Academy for high school and graduated from Yale University in 1956 where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He also competed in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, winning a gold medal in "eights" as a member of the American team. Esselstyn received his M.D. from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1961 (during which time he met his wife Ann), and was an Intern (1961-2) and Resident (1962–66) at the Cleveland Clinic. He worked with the Cleveland Clinic beginning in 1968 where he served as President of the Staff and as a member of the Board of Governors. He served as the President of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons in 1991. In 2000, he gave up his post at the Cleveland Clinic. In 2005, he also "became the first recipient of the Benjamin Spock Award for Compassion in Medicine. He received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Cleveland Clinic Alumni Association in 2009. In September 2010, he received the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame Award." Esselstyn is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Nutrition Action magazine, published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Esselstyn is the author of the 2007 text, Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, in which he discusses his patients' reversals of atherosclerosis by following a no-oil, whole foods, plant-based (vegan) diet, in some cases combined with cholesterol-lowering medication. The second half of the book contains recipes from his wife Ann Crile Esselstyn (the granddaughter of George Washington Crile, founder of the Cleveland Clinic) who works with him to counsel patients on cooking practices. Esselstyn and his family of four children have maintained a plant-based diet since the mid-1980s. Esselstyn attributes the success of his twelve-year trial with heart patients to low mean levels of both total cholesterol (145 mg/dl) and LDL cholesterol (82 mg/dl). After undergoing cardiac surgery in 2010, former American president Bill Clinton adopted the plant-based diet recommended by Dean Ornish and Esselstyn. Esselstyn stars in the 2011 documentary Forks Over Knives, based on his work in Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease and the research of his his colleague T. Colin Campbell in The China Study. It also explores the work of other doctors who share this approach as well as the personal experiences of some Esselstyn's patients. Esselstyn's son, Rip Esselstyn, a "professional triathlete," firefighter, and author of The Engine 2 Diet based on his father's research, also appears in the film as does his wife Ann.
