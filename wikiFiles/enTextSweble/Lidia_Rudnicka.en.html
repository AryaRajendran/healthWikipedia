 Professor Lidia Rudnicka, MD, PhD (born February 19, 1960 in Chicago, Illinois) is a Polish-American researcher and dermatologist with significant contributions to the field of scleroderma research, knowledge about hair diseases and work on challenges of melanoma prevention. Lidia Rudnicka is currently chairman of Department of Dermatology CSK MSWiA (Central Clinical Hospital of Ministry of Internal Affaires) in Warsaw, Poland. From 1990 to 1993, she worked in American and European institutions: Food and Drug Administration (USA), University of Liège (Belgium) and Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia (USA). In the years 2002-2004 Lidia Rudnicka was an advisor to Prime Minister of Poland. Professor Rudnicka has authored or co-authored over 200 articles and book chapters, mainly concerning autoimmune skin diseases, biological therapies, videodermoscopy, trichoscopy, epidemiology of skin diseases and managing medical institutions Lidia Rudnicka graduated from Warsaw Medical School (having previously studied in Bonn and Cologne) in 1986. She went on to receive PhD in medical sciences in 1990 and habilitation degree in 1994. In 2001 Lidia Rudnicka became Full Professor in medical sciences. From 1987 to 1998 she worked as an Assistant Lecturer and Assistant Professor in Department of Dermatology, Warsaw Medical School. Since 2008 Lidia Rudnicka has been professor at the Faculty of Health Sciences in Medical University of Warsaw. Lidia Rudnicka started her professional career in 1986 in Department of Immunopathology of National Institute of Hygiene. In 1987 she became Assistant Lecturer in Department of Dermatology, Warsaw Medical University. The clinic was headed at that time by most prominent Polish dermatologist of the 20th century, professor Stefania Jablonska. The fruitful scientific cooperation with Stefania Jablonska lasted 11 years, until 1998, when Lidia Rudnicka accepted chairmanship of Department of Dermatology, CSK MSWiA. From 1990 to 1993 she worked in American and European institutions: Food an Drug Administration (National Institute of Health; 1990), University of Liège (research laboratory of Department of Dermatology; 1991) and Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia (Department of Dermatology; 1991–1993). Since 2007 professor Rudnicka has been a member of National Examinary Commission for dermatology and venerology exams. Lidia Rudnicka, beside her activity in Dermatology Department of CSK MSWiA, participates in works of Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Polish Academy of Sciences. Lidia Rudnicka's early work was related to the role of Natural Killer Cells and adhesion molecules in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and showed that activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of scleroderma patients exhibit increased adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, which is an early event, preceding formation of perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and development of skin fibrosis. She is the author of the hypothesis linking etiology of systemic sclerosis to a mutation in the topoisomerase I gene and abnormal topoisomerase I expression. Furthermore, professor Rudnicka believes that presence of anti-topoisomerse I antibodies in sera of patients with scleroderma represents a protective reaction to these abnormalities. This hypothesis was partly confirmed by Lidia Rudnicka's and her students' studies. The study on which Urszula Nowicka's doctoral thesis was based showed a mutation in the 3’ coding region of the topoisomerase gene in 56% of patients with anti-topo I – positive (Scl70-positive) systemic sclerosis. It was also indicated that specific antibodies penetrate into the nuclei of fibrobasts and inhibit the activity of topoisomerase I. Moreover, the studies evidenced that topoisomerase I inhibitor, campothecin, down-regulates the expression of type I collagen in fibroblasts of scleroderma patients and yields immunosuppressive effects. Certain cytokines were shown to increase the activity of topoisomerase I in dermal. The hypothesis by professor Rudnicka was discussed during medical conferences, but was never confirmed by other researchers. However, the findings related to the role of campothecin and its potential therapeutical use were reaffirmed in the study by Zhang et al. conducted in patients with keloid. Another observation by Lidia Rudnicka and her co-workers, which may be potentially beneficial as far as managing systemic sclerosis is concerned, was abnormally high expression of prolactin in peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from patients A second field of research of professor Lidia Rudnicka is trichology. She made a significant contribution to development of hair and scalp dermoscopy. Most known are her and her co-workers’ studies on genetic hair disorders, which showed that it is possible to diagnose genetic hair shaft abnormalities in children without the need of pulling hairs for microscopic evaluation. In 2005, Lidia Rudnicka and Malgorzata Olszewska used videodermatoscopy in assessing disease severity and monitoring impact of dutasteride therapy on hair thickness and hair shaft heterogeneity in androgenic in androgenic alopecia, indicating this method can be used as a research tool to evaluate the effects of therapeutic or cosmetic agents The next year, together with Malgorzata Olszewska and their co-workers she introduced the term trichoscopy for hair, scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes dermoscopy (videodermoscopy). Their subsequent studies showed this technique can easily replace traditional microscopic evaluation in genetic hair shaft abnormalities such as Netherton syndrome, monilethrix, wooly hair syndrome, pili torti, pili annulati and trichothiodystrophy. It has also been proved trichoscopy can be useful in diagnosing acquired hair diseases including androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata, cicatrical alopecia and tinea. Professor Rudnicka and her co-workers were the first to apply in vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy in hair diagnostics. Their studies showed potential usefulness of this method in evaluation of hair shaft diseases. Professor Lidia Rudnicka is the organizer of a Polish nation-wide campaign to promote prevention and early detection of melanoma (with dermoscopy and videodermoscopy). The campaign "Stop-Melanoma", based on highly successful Australian experience, is an ongoing program which started in 2004. Clinical observations made by professor Rudnicka and her co-workers indicate the rationality of long-term low-dose antibiotic therapy in chronic inflammatory skin diseases: SLE and psoriasis. Lidia Rudnicka is a member and in years 2004–2008 was secretary of the board of Polish Dermatological Society. Since 2004 she has been a member of board of International Dermoscopy Society. Professor Rudnicka is also a member of International Committee of American Academy of Dermatology in term 2008-2012. Professor Rudnicka was speaker (and on many occasions a co-organizer) at multiple dermatology meetings, including: American Academy of Dermatology, European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology (topics included: hair diseases, dermosopy and skin cancer detection, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, biological therapy in skin diseases, connective tissue diseases, acne, clinical trials). Lidia Rudnicka is author or co-author of more than 200 articles and book chapters, mainly concerning autoimmune skin diseases, biological therapies, videodermoscopy, trichoscopy, epidemiology of skin diseases and managing medical institutions. Lidia Rudnicka is managing editor of "Journal of Case Reports in Dermatology", chairman of scientific board of "Dermatologica", member of scientific and editorial boards of Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Przeglad Dermatologiczny, Expert Review in Dermatology and Dermatologia Estetyczna. She also reviewed papers for significant periodicals in the field of dermatology and venerology, with Archives of Dermatology, Journal of European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Expert Review in Dermatology among them.
