 Marc Darrow M.D. is a Board Certified Physiatrist, professor and author specializing in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Dr. Darrow is an acting Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine where he emphasizes a treatment known as prolotherapy. Dr. Darrow attended Northwestern University where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology followed by degree in Medicine from the University of Hawaii. In addition, Darrow holds a Doctorate in Jurisprudence from Golden Gate University as well as an MBA from the University of California. Darrow’s work and commitment to Prolotherapy has led to four published books, ‘’The Knee Sourcebook’’, ‘’The Collagen Revolution: Living Pain Free’’, ‘’The Hollywood Pain Solution and Prolotherapy: Living Pain Free’’, a radio show and regular contributions to popular blogs such as the Huffington Post. In 2007, Newsweek Magazine featured Darrow in an article about chronic pain and its effect on U.S. veterans. After a golf injury caused Dr. Darrow chronic pain, he discovered Prolotherapy (short for “proliferation therapy”) which promotes rapid, or prolific, growth of cartilage and collagen integral in human joint function. Such growth occurs when benign natural substances are injected into targeted areas of the body known as “trigger points,” activating the natural healing process and growth of new collagen and cartilage. By rejuvenating deteriorated connective tissue and joint capsules, chronic pain can be relieved. Such chronic pain is suffered by millions of Americans, even avid sports enthusiasts like Darrow himself. After realizing the healing potential of the then little-known Prolotherapy, Darrow devoted his practice to bringing his methods to many suffering with debilitating pain, eventually developing an approach called the Trinity of Healing. This threefold method focuses on treating the body in need of repair, the mind coping with the pain, and the emotional state of the patient helping them to transcend the physical and move to a higher level of consciousness. In addition to his medical practice including musculoskeletal injury, pain management, electrodiagnosis (EMG/NCS), sports medicine and rehabilitation, Dr. Darrow hosts his own self-titled radio show on Southern California’s KRLA 870 AM. The Huffington Post also sees regular contributions from the doctor on topics such as obesity, sleep and relationships.
