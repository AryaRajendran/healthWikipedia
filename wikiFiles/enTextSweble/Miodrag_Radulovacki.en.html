 Miodrag (Misha) Radulovacki, MD, PhD (Serbian Cyrillic: Миодраг Радуловачки; Serbian Latin: Miodrag Radulovački), Professor of Pharmacology in the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), is a scientist and inventor with significant research accomplishments in two areas: (1) he postulated the Adenosine Sleep Theory, and (2) together with his longtime research collaborator, Dr. David W. Carley, (Professor of Medicine at the UIC), he pioneered pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep apnea. Dr. Radulovacki and Dr. Carley invented several drug therapies for the treatment of sleep apnea which have been patented by the UIC. As a result, the UIC recognized them as the 2010 "Inventors of the Year." During his long academic career at the UIC, Dr. Radulovacki published more than 170 scientific papers. Dr. Radulovacki has been a Foreign Member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 2003. Miodrag Radulovacki was born in 1933, in Parage, a village in northwestern Serbia. Both of his parents were elementary school teachers. At the beginning of World War II, Dr. Radulovacki's father was drafted into the Yugoslav Army and was later taken prisoner by the invading Germans. From 1941 to 1944, Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, was occupied by the German armed forces. In 1943, when Dr. Radulovacki was 10 years old, he moved to Sremski Karlovci after his mother accepted a teaching position in the town. Sremski Karlovci (also known as Karlovci), a historic baroque Serbian town on the banks of the Danube River, had been home to the Radulovacki family for over 200 years. Dr. Radulovacki attended Karlovci High School or "Gymnasium," which is the oldest high school in Serbia. Karlovci High School's famous patron was the Russian czar, Peter the Great, who sent the school its first teachers and text books. Dr. Radulovacki graduated as valedictorian of the Karlovci High School Class of 1951. During his high school years, Dr. Radulovacki developed a deep interest in research and discoveries. And, in order to pursue the best clinical research opportunities, Dr. Radulovacki enrolled in the University of Belgrade School of Medicine. Dr. Radulovacki graduated from the University of Belgrade School of Medicine in 1959. He decided to pursue an academic career in basic sciences and went on to obtain a PhD in Neurophysiology. The topic of his PhD thesis was: ”Sleep in Split-Brain Cats,” partly done at the Brain Research Institute at UCLA. In order to gain broader experience in the field of sleep research, Dr. Radulovacki spent a year and a half at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Brain Research Institute where his mentor was Dr. Ross Adey. One of the significant findings of his research at UCLA was that the electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern of sleep in cats with split brain to the pons is synchronous in both brain hemispheres, indicating the importance of the brainstem in sleep regulation. In 1966, Dr. Radulovacki accepted a teaching position with the Physiology Department in the College of Medicine at the University of Khartoum, Sudan. It was there that he invented an approach for obtaining cerebrospinal fluid using a cannula to the cisterna magna in the brain of cats. The cannulation method enabled researchers to obtain cerebrospinal fluid during sleep and wakefulness for the analysis of monoamine metabolites. This approach was of interest since Michel Jouvet’s Monoamine Theory of Sleep, with serotonin as the sleep inducing agent, was dominant at the time. Later, from 1970 to 1984, at the University of Illinois, Dr. Radulovacki published a series of papers dealing with the role of monoamines in sleep. In 1970, Dr. Radulovacki was recruited by Dr. Klaus Unna to join the Department of Pharmacology in the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago as an Assistant Professor. Dr. Unna was a world authority on neuropharmacology which coincided with Dr. Radulovacki’s interest in the physiology and pharmacology of sleep. Dr. Unna came from a long line of University Professors in Hamburg, Germany who had made outstanding contributions to medicine. His grandfather invented the Unna boot, a special gauze bandage, which can be used for the treatment of venous insufficiencies of the leg. And, Dr. Unna's mother discovered and described the dermatological disease, Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis. With the benefit of the high caliber research environment created by Dr. Unna, Dr. Radulovacki has gone on to publish more than 170 scientific papers during his long academic career at the UIC. In 1984, Dr. Radulovacki postulated the Adenosine Sleep Theory, (JPET, 228: 268-274, 1984). The idea for adenosine’s role in sleep occurred to him after reading a paper by Sol Snyder’s group (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 78: 3260-64, 1981) about the importance of adenosine receptors in the behavioral actions of methylxanthines. In the article, the authors correlated the behavioral excitation produced by theophylline in micromolar concentrations with the blockade of adenosine receptors. Dr. Radulovacki reasoned that if the blocking of adenosine receptors produces excitation, then perhaps stimulation of the same receptors could induce sleep. He knew that experiments by John Phillis and his group (Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 57:1289-1312, 1979), which utilized an iontophoretic application of adenosine in the brain, had demonstrated adenosine's depressant effect on the responses of neurons in several brain regions and that the general neurophysiological effects of adenosine were shown to be inhibitory. In addition, the preliminary experiments in dogs by Haulica et al. (J. Neurochem. 21:,1019–20, 1973) and the administration of adenosine into the brains of rats, cats and fowl suggested that adenosine was able to produce behavioral sleep. The explanation of adenosine's hypnotic effect was through its interaction with serotonin, widely believed to be a sleep inducing agent. However, since there was no suggestion how this adenosine-serotonin link was achieved, experiments highlighting the potential role of adenosine in sleep had largely been forgotten. In 1993, Dr. Radulovacki started a long and fruitful collaboration with Dr. David W. Carley, a Professor of Medicine, Bioengineering and Pharmacology at the UIC. Their research efforts focused on developing pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, an involuntary cessation of breathing that occurs during sleep, affects at least 3% to 5% of the adult population in the United States. In addition, the prevalence of sleep-related apnea is dramatically elevated in the elderly, ranging from 28% to 67% of that population. Sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, memory problems, weight gain, headaches and death. Since there were no medicines to alleviate this condition, Drs. Carley and Radulovacki set out to develop a drug treatment. Their initial work focussed on an experimental model of sleep apnea in rats, initially testing the effects of adenosine compounds. Eventually, they obtained positive results using serotonin and other compounds. As a result, the UIC patented their discoveries, obtaining numerous US and international patents. Patents for sleep and sleep-related disorders include: Dr. Radulovacki was named the 2010 Inventor of the Year at the University of Illinois, alongside his research collaborator, Dr. David Carley. Drs. Carley and Radulovacki were honored by the University of Illinois for producing a dozen potential treatments for sleep apnea, many of which are now under consideration for commercial development. Their ground-breaking results have culminated in an IllinoisVentures-supported startup company, Pier Pharmaceuticals, that focuses on the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. In October 2003, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Belgrade elected Dr. Radulovacki as one of its Foreign Members. Dr. Radulovacki received this distinction for his significant scientific research contributions in the fields of Neuropharmacology, sleep disorders and sleep-related breathing disorders. Other foreign scientists elected to the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts that same year were Noam Chomsky from MIT and Nobel Laureate, Stanley Prusiner. In 1990, Dr. Radulovacki initiated the Yugoslav Student Summer Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the University of Illinois at Champagne-Urbana (UIUC) after the creation of International Linkage Agreements between the UIC and the Universities of Belgrade and Novi Sad in Yugoslavia. The motivating force behind this program was to bring outstanding students from these Yugoslav Universities to the UIC and the UIUC for one month in order to introduce them to graduate programs and advanced research. The Yugoslav Student Summer Program was successful due to its strict system of pre-selection and final selection of participants. Participants were chosen on the basis of their academic success - only students with an average grade of 9.00 and higher (where the top grade was 10.00) were able to apply. The final selection was done by Dr. Radulovacki on the basis of supplemental English writing tests that he developed and which were administered every December at the two Yugoslav Universities. The Yugoslav Student Summer Program lasted for 12 years and had 304 participants. As a result of the Summer Program, at one point, over 100 students from Yugoslavia had been enrolled at the UIC and the UIUC graduate programs with full teaching assistantships. More about the Yugoslav Summer Program can be found on the web site: http://mir.cs.uiuc.edu/uisp. Dr. Radulovacki is also a philanthropist. In 2005, Dr. Radulovacki established the Miodrag Radulovacki Family Prize for Excellence in Basic Sciences at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago. The purpose of the prize, given annually, is to honor a fourth year Medical student who displays a high degree of intellectual integrity and who has demonstrated strong academic achievement. The prize consists of a plaque and a check for $1,000. In addition to the establishment of a scholarship at the UIC, Dr. Radulovacki made numerous contributions to his home town of Sremski Karlovci, a city with a rich history on the banks of the Danube River in Serbia. Throughout its history, Sremski Karlovci has been a leading Serbian cultural center, home to the first Serbian high school and the first Serbian Orthodox Theological Seminary (established soon after the founding of the Russian Orthodox Seminary in Kiev). Sremski Karlovci was, for several centuries, the seat of the Serbian Patriarchy and has also served as the site for a number of important Serbian National Assemblies. Dr, Radulovacki lives in Chicago. He is an avid cross country skier and belongs to the Lake Shore Ski and Sports Club. He participated in several Birkebeiner-Kortelopet cross-country ski marathons in Cable-Hayward, Wisconsin. He has two sons.
