The current minister is Deb Matthews. The Ministry also regulates hospitals and nursing homes; operates psychiatric hospitals and medical laboratories; and co-ordinates emergency health services for the Province. The Ministry once operated ambulance services outside of major cities in Ontario, but the services were off-loaded to municipalities circa 1998. The Public Health Act of 1882 created the Provincial Board of Health of Ontario, as it was originally known, and which was the first permanent health care administrative body in the Province. In 1925 it became the Department of Health. In 1930, the Department of Hospitals was established under the direction of the first Minister of Health; that Department became a division of the Department of Health in 1934. Insured hospital services and insured physicians' services, introduced in 1959 and 1966 respectively, were combined under the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) in 1972. The Department of Health became the Ministry of Health in 1971, and then the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care in June, 1999.
