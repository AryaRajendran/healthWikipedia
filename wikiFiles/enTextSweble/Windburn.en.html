 Windburn is sunburn accelerated by the effects of wind removing the UV-filtering thin layer of lipids from the skin and irritation caused by the wind. Though formerly thought to be solely the result of wind, the condition has been demonstrated to be the result of sun exposure aggravated by exposure to wind. Thus treatment and prevention of windburn and sunburn are basically identical.
