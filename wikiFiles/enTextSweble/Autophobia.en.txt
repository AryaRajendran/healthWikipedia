 Autophobia is the specific phobia of isolation; a morbid fear of being egotistical , or a dread of being alone or isolated. Sufferers need not be physically alone, but believe that they are being ignored, unloved, threatened by intruders, and so on. Autophobia also is used in its literal text to mean, by yourself, an uncontrollable fear of oneself. It is sometimes associated with self-hatred, or loathing. Autophobia may be a symptom of other psychological disorders or it may predispose a person to developing other psychological disorders. It also means not being able to trust yourself, and possibly having a guardian, friend, or just having somebody that you can rely on to positively reinforce you, and your actions. This is a phobia normally caused by traumatic experiences, such as losing a loved one, or being left alone by someone that you rely on. To be diagnosed with such a phobia is difficult to overcome, to be have the inner fear within yourself. People who suffer from autophobia may show symptoms but may not be fully aware that they suffer from it. Some symptoms of autophobia may include: Autophobia can be caused by being left by someone you hold close to you; a spouse, significant other, relative. You will grieve for losing them, but it will heal over time. However, if you do pick up this disorder, it does become increasingly hard to get rid of. While there is no real cure to the disorder, just as with most phobias, there are ways to help treat it. Some doctors encourage the use of medication for the treatment of autophobia, and some believe that it helps, however it should only be used to dull the impact, because medication only hides the disorder. A medicine to help make this disorder more manageable than before is anti-anxiety medication. The most effective that doctors have found is a combination of anti-anxiety medication, counseling; to express what you feel and why you believe you feel that way, and a strong and supportive group of friends/family.
