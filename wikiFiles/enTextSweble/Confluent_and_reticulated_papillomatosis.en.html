 Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis of Gougerot and Carteaud (also known as "Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis," "CRP", "CARP", "Familial cutaneous papillomatosis," and "Familial occurrence of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis") is an uncommon but distinctive acquired ichthyosiform dermatosis characterized by persistent dark, scaly, papules and plaques that tend to be localized predominantly on the central trunk. Henri Gougerot and Alexandre Carteaud originally described the condition in 1927. The cause remains unknown, but the observation that the condition may clear with Minocycline turned attention to an infectious agent. Actinomycete Dietzia strain X was isolated from one individual. Other antibiotics found useful include azithromycin, fusidic acid, clarithromycin, erythromycin, tetracycline and cefdinir.
