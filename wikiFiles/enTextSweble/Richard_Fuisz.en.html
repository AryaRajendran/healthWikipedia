 Richard Carl Fuisz, M.D. (born December 12, 1939) is an American physician, inventor, licensed pilot, and entrepreneur. Fuisz founded Fuisz Technologies, Ltd. and Medcom, Inc. He is credited with bringing the first Miss USSR to the United States through his modeling agency Dr. Fuisz is also a well-known nonrepresentational painter, working mainly in the futurist style. Fuisz was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to Slovenian immigrants Anton and Margaret Fuisz, and has dual US/Slovenian citizenship as a result. He attended Bethlehem Catholic High School. He majored in Biology at Georgetown University and graduated from Georgetown Medical School. Richard Fuisz and his brother, Robert Fuisz, established an endowed professorship at the Georgetown University School of Medicine. After graduating from medical school, he worked on public health films. He then hosted a television talk show, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Pennsylvania. Later Fuisz was commissioned as a Lt. Commander in the United States Navy. His Naval work included a White House posting. Fuisz then founded Medcom, a publicly traded medical training company. Fuisz established the Seline Modeling Agency together with Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The Seline Agency brought the first Miss USSR to the United States. Seline was acquired by the Click Agency. In 1981, Baxter International acquired Medcom. Fuisz provided documents to Baxter directors and to The Wall Street Journal showing that Baxter International sold a plant in Israel to comply with the Arab economic and political boycotts of Israel. In 1993 Baxter was the first company to face criminal charges under the anti-boycott law. As a result of Fuisz's documentation and testimony, Baxter pled guilty in March 1993 to violation of U.S. anti-boycott laws and was fined $6.5 million. He told the House Agriculture Committee in 1992 that Terex Corporation had built mobile Scud missile launchers for Saddam Hussein with the "CIA's blessing". Terex "vigorously denied" the charge and started a libel suit against Fuisz. A 16-month federal investigation concluded that there was "no credible evidence that Terex supplied Scud missile launchers to Iraq" and the New York Times printed a retraction of their Seymour M. Hersh article saying "The Times has no evidence that contradicts the task force's findings."The Sunday Herald in 2005 reported on documents provided by Iraq to the UN naming companies that had provided assistance to Iraq's weapons program. Although the US government attempted to censor the contents, Terex is listed in a table of "UK firms that sold arms to Iraq", arms that involved "rocket" material. In 1989 Fuisz started Fuisz Technologies to produced a quick dissolve tablet for drug delivery. A spin-off of Fuisz Technologies, RXdrugstore.com was created by Fuisz and had notables such as Rahm Emanuel on the board. He also created the CEFORM encapsulation technology for taste masking and controlled release. Biovail purchase Fuisz Technologies in late 1999. Fuisz formed Kosmos Pharma, a thin film drug delivery company. Kosmos Pharma was acquired by MonoSol Rx. In addition to drug delivery, Fuisz has actively invented other, new medical technologies such as the remotely adjustable stent and a liquid used in the place of water to take conventional medicine tablets. Fuisz holds software patents relating to e-commerce and electronic mail.1 Fuisz holds over 200 patents, including 90 U.S. patents in technology. He endowed the Richard and Lorraine Fuisz Library at Moravian Academy. He also funded the Fuisz Scholarship fund, also at Moravian Academy, to benefit students of Slovenian ancestry. He serves on the Board of Regents for Georgetown University.
