 Definitions of abortion vary from one source to another. Abortion has many definitions that can differ from each other in significant ways. Given the contentious nature of abortion, lawmakers and other stakeholders often face controversy in defining abortion. Influential non-state actors like the United Nations and the Roman Catholic Church have also engendered controversy over efforts to define abortion. Ambiguous definitions can create concerns in the medical community. Physicians in several countries, including Ireland and Canada, have expressed concern over ambiguous definitions of abortion. Even in situations where there is a clear definition of abortion, it does not always match definitions of related terms in effect in the same jurisdiction.
