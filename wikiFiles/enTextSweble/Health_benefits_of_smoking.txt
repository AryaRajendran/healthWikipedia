 In addition to the numerous documented negative health effects of smoking, several types of "Smokerâ€™s Paradoxes" ( cases where smoking appears to have specific beneficial effects) have been observed. These effects should not be confused with altered mortality rate in "quitting ill". Patients who QUIT smoking have an increase in mortality from lung cancer compared to smokers, due to the lungs going into "overdrive" in an attempt to heal, often forming new growths in the process. Smoking is also known to reduce the incidence of sarcoidosis and uterine fibroids. Often the actual mechanism remains undetermined. A plausible mechanism of action in some cases may be the nicotine in tobacco smoke acting as an anti-inflammatory agent and interfering with the disease process.
