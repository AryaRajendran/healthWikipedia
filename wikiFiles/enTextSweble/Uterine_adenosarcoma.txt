 Uterine adenosarcoma, also adenosarcoma of the uterus, and MÃ¼llerian adenosarcoma of the uterus, is an uncommon form of cancer that arises from mesenchymal tissue of the uterus and has a benign glandular component. The most common presentation is vaginal bleeding. Other presentations include pelvic mass and uterine polyp. Generally, the clinical findings are non-specific. Uterine adenosarcoma have, by definition, a malignant stroma and benign glandular elements. The WHO criteria has a mitotic rate cut point; however, this is often disregarded, as bland appearing tumours with a low mitotic rate are known to metastasize occasionally. Uterine adenosarcomas are typically treated with a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy (TAH-BSO). Ovary sparing surgery may be done in women wishing to preserve fertility. The prognosis is determined primarily by the cancer stage. Most tumours are discovered at an early stage and have a good prognosis, especially when compared to uterine carcinosarcoma. Five year survival for stage I and stage III tumours is approximately 80% and 50% respectively.
