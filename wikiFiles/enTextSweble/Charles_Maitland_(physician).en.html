 Doctor Charles Maitland (1668â€“1748) was a Scottish surgeon who inoculated people against smallpox. He inoculated two of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's children during a smallpox epidemic: her five-year-old son in March 1718 in Constantinople, Turkey, and her daughter, who was four, in April 1721 in London, which was the first professional inoculation in England. The family promoted inoculation in England. On 9 August 1721, Maitland received a Royal License that allowed him to test variolation on six prisoners in Newgate Prison. The experiment took place in August 1722, under the direction of Sir Hans Sloane. All prisoners survived, and one who was exposed to the disease proved to be immune. They were pardoned later that year. In late 1722, Caroline of Ansbach ordered the inoculation of five orphans of St. James's Parish in London. Following their success, Caroline had Maitland inoculate her eldest son, Frederick and one other child. The surgeon died in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1748.
