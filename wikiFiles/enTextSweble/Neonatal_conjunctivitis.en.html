 Neonatal conjunctivitis, also known as ophthalmia neonatorum, is a form of conjunctivitis contracted by newborns during delivery. The baby's eyes are contaminated during passage through the birth canal from a mother infected with either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. Ophthalmic ointment containing 0.5% erythromycin is typically applied to the newborn's eyes within 1 hour of birth as prophylaxis against gonococcal ophthalmia. If left untreated it can cause blindness. Neonatal conjunctivitis by definition presents during the first month of life. It may be infectious or non infectious.organism is transmitted from the genital tract of an infected mother during birth or by infected hands. Chemical irritants such as silver nitrate can cause chemical conjunctivitis, usually lasting 2–4 days. Thus, silver nitrate is no longer in common use. In most countries neomycin and chloramphenicol eye drops are used instead. Many different bacteria and viruses can cause conjunctivitis in the neonate. The two most feared causes are N. gonorrheae and Chlamydia acquired from the birth canal during delivery. Ophthalmia neonatorum due to gonococci (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) typically manifests in the first five days of life and is associated with marked bilateral purulent discharge and local inflammation. In contrast, conjunctivitis secondary to infection with chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis) produces conjunctivitis after day three of life, but may occur up to two weeks after delivery. The discharge is usually more watery in nature (mucopurulent) and less inflamed. Babies infected with chlamydia may develop pneumonitis (chest infection) at a later stage (range 2 weeks – 19 weeks after delivery). Infants with chlamydia pneumonitis should be treated with oral erythromycin for 10–14 days. Other agents causing ophthalmia neonatorum include Herpes simplex virus (HSV 2), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Untreated cases may develop corneal ulceration, which may perforate resulting in corneal opacification and Staphyloma formation. Prophylaxis needs antenatal, natal, and post-natal care. Systemic therapy: Neonates with gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum should be treated for seven days with one of the following regimens
