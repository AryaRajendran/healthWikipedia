 Porotic hyperostosis, also known as osteoporosis symmetrica, cribra crani, hyperostosis spongiosa, and symmetrical osteoporosis. is a disease that causes bone tissue to become soft and spongy. In the disease, the spongy marrow within the bones of the skull becomes overgrown. The overgrowth of the skull's marrow may cause the outer table of the bones to move and become thinner. The disease was widely accepted to be related to anemia, probably due to an iron deficiency but several lines of evidence suggest that the accelerated loss and compensatory over-production of red blood cells seen in hemolytic and megaloblastic anemia is the most likely proximate cause of porotic hyperostosis. In anthropology, presence of the condition is used by researchers to detect malnourished populations. Anthropologists can look at bones of people from ancient populations and learn about their diets and lifestyles, a discipline known as paleonutrition. A high incidence of the disease indicates the population adapted poorly to its environment or was under nutritional stress. A low level of iron in the blood is also a defense against pathogens, so a high incidence of the disease in a population could also indicate an attempt to fight off a microorganism. From this perspective, porotic hyperostosis could be viewed as an adaptation to the environment, rather than an indicator of malnutrition.
