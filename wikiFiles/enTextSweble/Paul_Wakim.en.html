In The Wichita Eagle and Beacon Newspaper, on Saturday June 4, 1977, section 4C lie ‘Severed Foot Replanted in Rare Surgery’ discussed how a Wichitan man's right foot was ‘severed in an industrial accident.’ The Wichitan man, 28 year old Pedro Espinosa, was cleaning on an early Thursday at Sunny, Kansas Flour Mills, and stepped in a loop of moving rotary cable which dragged him and snapped his right foot from his leg. Mr. Espinosa was rushed to St. Francis Hospital. Espinosa's foot was preserved in a bucket filled with iced salt water solution, as the man was transported to the hospital. According to The Wichita Eagle and Beacon Newspaper, “the chances of success were very poor.” The operation lasted 5½ hours with a team of physicians led by 32 year old, Dr. Wakim in St. Francis Hospital. The team connected two arteries (dorsalis pedis & posterior tibial) and four veins using microsurgical tools and magnifying glasses. “Wakim said extremity replants have been done for eight to 10 years, but only now have the tools, the technique, and the education become well established.” “…microvascular surgery, with the special equipment required is only two to three years old.” “[Dr. Paul Wakim] said he thought he could remember reading of only one case of foot replantation. An arm replanted at University of Kansas Medical Center a couple years ago.” Dr. Wakim had many clinical, academic, and professional positions before and after he received his Board of Certifications in 1982.
