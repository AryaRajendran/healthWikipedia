 The Burzynski Clinic is a clinic in Texas, United States founded in 1976 and offering unproven cancer treatment. The clinic is best known for its "antineoplaston therapy", a controversial pharmacological treatment using compounds it calls antineoplastons, devised by the clinic's founder Stanislaw Burzynski in the 1970s. The clinic has been the focus of much criticism due to the way its unproven antineoplaston therapy is promoted, the costs for cancer sufferers participating in "trials" of antineoplastons, significant problems with the way these trials are run, legal cases brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without board approval, and for other causes. There is a scientific consensus that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and of little promise in treating cancer. Clinical trials initiated in 1993 and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute were closed due to inability to recruit qualifying patients, and a Mayo Clinic study found no benefit from antineoplaston treatment. Some sixty phase 2 clinical trials and one Phase 3 trial have been registered by Burzynski since the mid-1990s, but no results have been published. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has stated: "Bottom Line: There is no clear evidence to support the anticancer effects of antineoplastons in humans." Stanislaw Rajmund Burzynski is founder, president and chairman of the controversial Burzynski Research Institute Inc. (), based in Houston and Stafford, Texas. He was born on January 23, 1943 in Lublin, Poland. On graduating at age 24, from the Medical Academy in Lublin, he had reportedly already published fourteen papers. The following year he is stated to have earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry. Burzynski immigrated to the United States in 1970 working at Baylor College until 1977, when he and established the Burzynski Research Laboratory, where he administered antineoplaston therapy, initially to 21 patients then more widely as "experimental" treatment, immediately opening himself up to "charges of unethical conduct and to the suspicion he had become a merchant of false hope".<ref name=<"Smithp138">Smith, p. 138. Effectively having exiled himself from mainstream medicine, Burzynski pursued a course of promoting his offerings using publicity, and "aggressively [seeking] out ... terminally ill cancer patients", leading to several instances of media controversy. Burzynski founded the Burzynski Research Institute in 1984. He has authored various research publications on antineoplastons and holds American patents on the treatments. In 2013, Burzynski was awarded the James Randi Educational Foundation's Pigasus Award. Antineoplaston is a name coined by Stanislaw Burzynski for a group of peptides, peptide derivatives, and mixtures that he uses as an alternative cancer treatment. The word is derived from neoplasm. Antineoplaston therapy has been offered in the US since 1984 but is not approved for general use due to lack of clinical evidence. The compounds are not licensed as drugs but are instead sold and administered by as part of clinical trials at the Burzynski Clinic and the Burzynski Research Institute. Although Burzynski and his associates claim success in the use of antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases, there is no evidence of clinical efficacy of these methods. Oncologists have described Burzynski's studies as flawed, with one doctor stating that they are "scientific nonsense". In particular, independent scientists have been unable to reproduce the positive results reported in Burzynski's studies. There is no convincing evidence from any randomized controlled trial that antineoplastons are useful for the treatment of cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved antineoplastons for the treatment of any disease. The American Cancer Society has found no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects in cancer, and it has recommended that people do not spend money on antineoplaston treatments. A 2004 medical review described this treatment as a "disproven therapy". Burzynski stated that he began investigating the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered significant differences in peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group. Burzynski first identified antineoplastons from human blood. Since similar peptides had been isolated from urine, early batches of Burzynski's treatment were isolated from urine collected in a Texas park. Since 1980 he has been reproducing his compounds synthetically. The first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston A-10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione). From A-10, antineoplaston AS2-1, a 4:1 mixture of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetylglutamine, was derived. The website of the Burzynski clinic states that the active ingredient of antineoplaston A10-I is phenylacetylglutamine. Burzynski has published a few trials claiming effectiveness for antineoplastons, although reviewers have criticized these trials as being "of a rather unclear design," and the National Cancer Institute reports that no randomized, controlled trials showing the effectiveness of antineoplastons have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Independent researchers have failed to reproduce the benefits reported by Burzynski. The evidence for use of antineoplaston therapy as a treatment for cancer is still, after more than 35 years, "inconclusive". A Phase II trial in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme was conducted under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute. Due to recruitment criteria imposed by Burzynski, over the period of two years only nine patients were accrued, six of whom were evaluated for response. All six evaluable patients showed evidence of tumor progression after treatment durations of between 16 to 66 days, and five of the six suffered neurologic side effects caused by the antineoplastons. All nine patients died, eight due to tumor progression. The study authors concluded: "The efficacy of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 remains uncertain. We were unable to document efficacy in any of six assessable patients." Since Burzynski was forced to administer the treatment only as part of a registered trial, some sixty Phase II trials have been registered with clinicaltrials.gov. No results of any of these trials have been published. In December 2010, a planned Phase III trial was registered but it subsequently did not open for patient recruitment. The consensus among the professional community, as represented by the American Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK among others, is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven, the Burzynski clinic is expensive, and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. At the same time, while the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy, it is in fact a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects. The clinical efficacy of antineoplaston combinations for various diseases has been the subject of many such trials by Burzynski and his associates, but these have not produced any clear evidence of efficacy. There is no convincing evidence from randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved these products for the treatment of any disease. The American Cancer Society has stated since 1983 that there is no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects in cancer and recommended that people do not buy these products since there could be serious health consequences to patients who use this therapy. A 2004 medical review described antioneoplaston treatment as a "disproven therapy." In 1998, three prominent oncologists were enlisted by the weekly Washington newsletter The Cancer Letter to conduct independent reviews of Burzynski's clinical trial research on antineoplastons. They concluded that the studies were poorly designed, not interpretable, and "so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works". One of them characterized the research as "scientific nonsense". In addition to questioning Burzynski's research methods, the oncologists found significant and possibly life-threatening toxicity in some patients treated with antineoplastons. Independent scientists have been unable to reproduce the positive results reported in Burzynski's studies: the National Cancer Institute has observed that researchers other than Burzynski and his associates have not been successful in duplicating his results, and Cancer Research UK states that "available scientific evidence does not support claims that antineoplaston therapy is effective in treating or preventing cancer." The marketing of antineoplaston therapy as "personalized gene-targeted therapy" is also controversial as the treatment is not related to actual gene therapy. Burzynski's use and advertising of antineoplastons as an unapproved cancer therapy were deemed to be unlawful by the U.S. FDA and the Texas Attorney General, and limits on the sale and advertising of the treatment were imposed as a result. In 2009, the FDA issued a warning letter to the Burzynski Research Institute, stating that an investigation had determined the Burzynski Institutional Review Board (IRB) "did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and FDA regulations governing the protection of human subjects." It identified a number of specific findings, among them that the IRB had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized, had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation, and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies, among others. The Institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations. Another warning issued in October 2012 notes that the Burzynski Clinic is advertising investigational drugs as being "safe and effective", noting: The letter requires cessation of noncompliant promotional activities, including use of testimonials and promotional interviews with Burzynski himself. In 1994, a court found against Burzynski in a case of insurance fraud. According to the SMU Law Review, Burzynski was found to have defrauded an ERISA health insurance fund by billing it for unapproved "treatment" with antineoplastons, in violation of the terms of the health plan it covered. In 2010, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners filed a multi-count complaint against Burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards. An appeal against the advertising restrictions on the grounds of free speech was denied on the basis that this was commercial speech promoting an unlawful activity. In December 2010, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners filed a multi-count complaint against Burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards. This suit was eventually withdrawn in November 2012 after the judge allowed Burzynski to repudiate responsibility for the actions of staff at the clinic. In January 2012, Lola Quinlan, an elderly, stage IV cancer patient, sued Dr Burzynski for using false and misleading tactics to swindle her out of $100,000. She also sued his companies, The Burzynski Clinic, the Burzynski Research Institute and Southern Family Pharmacy, in Harris County Court. She sued for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, deceptive trade and conspiracy. In November 2011, a music writer and editor for the British newspaper The Observer sought help raising £200,000 to have his 4-year-old niece, who was diagnosed with glioma, treated at the Burzynski Clinic. Several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment, and had died, and challenged the validity of Burzynski's treatments. Marc Stephens, identifying himself as a representative of the Burzynski Clinic, sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of Burzynski be removed from their sites. One of the bloggers who received threatening e-mails from Stephens was Rhys Morgan, a 17-year old sixth-form student from Cardiff, Wales, at the time, previously noted for exposing the Miracle Mineral Supplement. Another was Andy Lewis, a skeptic and publisher of the Quackometer blog. Cory Doctorow of Boing Boing summarized Stephens' threats and referred to the Streisand Effect. Following the publicity fallout resulting from the legal threats made by Stephens against the bloggers, the Burzynski Clinic issued a press release on November 29, 2011 confirming that the Clinic had hired Stephens "to provide web optimization services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning Dr. Burzynski and the Clinic", apologizing for comments made by Stephens to bloggers and for the posting of personal information (e.g. a satellite image of Morgan's home), and announcing that Stephens "no longer has a professional relationship with the Burzynski Clinic." The story, including the threats against the bloggers, was covered by the BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal). The chief clinician at Cancer Research UK expressed his concern at the treatment offered, and Andy Lewis of Quackometer and science writer Simon Singh, who had previously been sued by the British Chiropractic Association, said that English libel law harms public discussion of science and medicine, and thus public health. The 2010 film, Burzynski, Cancer is Serious Business, directed, written, edited, and narrated by Eric Merola, an art director of television commercials, describes Burzynski's use of antineoplastons and his legal clashes with government agencies and regulators. The Village Voice commented that the movie "violates every basic rule of ethical filmmaking" and that by interviewing only Burzynski's supporters, the film's producer "is either unusually credulous, or doesn't understand the difference between a documentary and an advertisement". Variety described the film as having the qualities of a "paranoid conspiracy theory" and likened it to the National Enquirer, adding that the film's explanatory diagrams are "simplistic to the point of idiocy". The review concluded that "despite its infotainment look, Burzynski ultimately proves convincing." Prior to the debut of "Burzynski", Houston Press correspondent Craig Malisow mocked the film's lack of objectivity, characterizing it as "a puff-piece paean that cherrypicks facts and ignores any criticism", and criticized the project for presenting only Burzynski's side of the story. A follow-up movie to Cancer is Serious Business is being planned for release in 2013. Based on analysis of pre-release trailers, and comments made by filmmaker Eric Merola on a video blog, David Gorski, MD, PhD, FACS – Associate Professor of Surgery at the Wayne State University School of Medicine, and surgical oncologist at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute  – has opined that the new film will focus on "[t]estimonials (or anecdotes)...of 'success stories'"; "'conversion stories' of oncologists who have become Burzynski believers"; attacks on critics and skeptics of Burzynski; attempting to justify Burzynski's "enormous bills for his antineoplaston therapy and criticism that he's making clinical trial subjects pay" to be in such trials; and "vindication", through an as-yet unpublished clinical trial claimed by Dr. Hideaki Tsuda, an anesthesiologist at Kurume University Hospital in Japan, who asserts efficacy of antineoplastons in metastatic colorectal cancer. A showing of Burzynski by CPT12 generated a large number of complaints to the PBS Obmudsman, who concurred with earlier reviewers of the film that the movie displays a serious lack of objectivity. Some CPT staffers were also criticized for failing to ask Eric Merola any of the hard questions.
