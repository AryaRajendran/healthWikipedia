 The International Association for Physicians in Aesthetic Medicine (IAPAM) is a voluntary association founded to unite licensed physicians who practice aesthetic medicine, by assisting in their professional and personal development. Aesthetic Medicine is defined as: "A branch of medicine focused on satisfying the aesthetic desires and goals of patients. This speciality is primarily focused on the pathophysiology of aging skin, and adheres to scientific based procedures. Physicians practicing Aesthetic Medicine are trained in both invasive and non-invasive treatment modalities, and typically utilize a combination of both to meet the needs of the patient." The IAPAM membership is open to licensed Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.), and the medical students studying for those degrees.
