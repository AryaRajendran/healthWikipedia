 Case management is the coordination of community services for mental health patients by allocating a professional to be responsible for the assessment of need and implementation of care plans. It is usually required for individuals who have a serious mental illness and need ongoing support in areas such as housing, employment, social relationships, and community participation. This level of support is also suitable for service users with a major psychotic disorder. The underlying tasks of case management include: The case management model developed in the USA in response to the closure of large psychiatric hospitals (known as deinstitutionalisation) and initially following a brokeage model, where professionals arranged for the provisions of services, without the need for direct patient care or contact. Clinical or therapeutic case management then developed as the need for the mental professional to establish a therapeutic relationship and be actively involved in clinical care was recognised. A more intensive form of case management (assertive community treatment or Intensive Case Management) was also developed for patients with more severe illness who needed a more assertive approach.
