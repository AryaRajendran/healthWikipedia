 The Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, is a national society of physicians trained in treating female reproductive cancers, especially gynecologic oncologists. With over 1,500 members, it is "the leading organization of gynecologic oncologists in the United States." The current president is Ronald Alvarez, MD, who is also a professor in the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in Birmingham, Alabama. The purpose of SGO is to improve the care of women with gynecologic cancers by encouraging research and disseminating knowledge to raise the standards of practice in the prevention and treatment of gynecologic malignancies, in cooperation with other organizations interested in women's health care, oncology and related fields. The idea for a national medical association dedicated to the study and treatment of gynecologic cancer originated in February 1968 during a discussion between Drs. Hervy E. Averette and John J. Mikuta at a meeting of the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics in New Orleans. Over time, a growing number of physicians signed on to the idea, and the society was formally founded at a meeting held in Key Biscayne, Florida in January 1969 under the chairmanship of George C. Lewis, Jr., MD.
