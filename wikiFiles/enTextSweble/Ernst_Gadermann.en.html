 Oberstabsarzt Dr. med. Ernst Gadermann (born 25 December 1913 in Wuppertal – died 26 November 1973 in Hamburg) was a German World War II doctor in the Sanitätsdienst. He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. After World War II he became a well known cardiologist. Gadermann joined the Luftwaffe in 1941, where he worked as a doctor in Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 "Immelmann" on the Eastern Front. In addition to his medical work, he was quickly coopted to the wing staff. Later he became an observer and gunner in the III. Group. During World War II he flew more than 850 combat missions in Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka) aircraft as a rear gunner. From May 1944 until his last mission on 9 February 1945 he flew with the most decorated German serviceman of the war, Hans-Ulrich Rudel. On this last mission he saved Rudel's life by pulling him from their severely damaged Ju 87 and applying first aid. Rudel's lower leg had been almost shot off, but he managed to land the aircraft before losing consciousness. Gadermann served the remainder of the war in a Medical Observation Center in Brunswick. After the war Gadermann worked as heart and circulatory specialist in Hamburg. There in 1947 he and Adolf Metzner developed the basics of the first telemetric measurements of the ECG in athletes. Gadermann was chief of the 1972 Summer Olympics sports medicine faculty. He died of a heart attack on 26 November 1973 in Hamburg on his way to a lecture. ;Citations ;Bibliography
