 Puberty blockers, also called puberty inhibitors, puberty suppressors, or hormone suppressors, are a group of medications used to inhibit puberty. They were originally used to treat children with precocious puberty or other such early onset of puberty. Puberty blockers stunt the growth of sexual organs and production of hormones. Other effects include the suppression of facial hair, deep voices, and Adam's apples for boys and the halting of breast growth and menstruation in girls. They have been used in children diagnosed with gender identity disorder (GID), a rare psychiatric condition in which a person feels that they are one sex while their body is another. Children can be prescribed puberty blockers, with their parent's permission, by an endocrinologist, usually after psychiatric or mental health evaluations. Puberty blockers take the form of a monthly injection. Currently, treatment including puberty blockers are not worldwide. Proponents of the use of puberty blockers argue that much of the mental and emotional distress caused by GID and body dysphoria can be mitigated with medications that ease a child into gender reassignment. The medications also are said to make gender reassignment surgery easier on the patient, as less is needed in terms of medical procedures and medications later on in life. Further arguments affirm that treatment with puberty blockers is reversible. Opponents of the medications state that the use of puberty blockers only increases the agony for a child and could possibly prevent a child from resolving such feelings with time. Furthermore, opponents argue that transgender identities and the use of puberty blockers are being encouraged by societal forces onto children not yet mature enough to make decisions on their gender identity.
