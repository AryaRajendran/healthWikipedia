 The inguinal ligament is a band running from the pubic tubercle to the anterior superior iliac spine. Its anatomy is very important for operating on hernia patients. It forms the base of the inguinal canal through which an indirect inguinal hernia may develop. The inguinal (crural) ligament runs from the anterior superior iliac spine of the ilium to the pubic tubercle of the pubic bone. It is formed by the external abdominal oblique aponeurosis and is continuous with the fascia lata of the thigh. There is some dispute over the attachments. Structures that pass deep to the inguinal ligament include: It is also referred to as Poupart's ligament, because Poupart gave it relevance in relation to hernial repair (he called it "le suspenseur de l'abdomen", the suspender of the abdomen). It is sometimes termed the Fallopian ligament. The ligament serves to contain soft tissues as they course anteriorly from the trunk to the lower extremity. This structure demarcates the superior border of the femoral triangle.
