The same study suggests an estimated total number of surgical mistakes at just over 4,000 per year in the United States; however, these statistics are extrapolations from incomplete data rather than actual event counts. As defined by the National Quality Forum and commonly agreed upon by health care providers, the current list of 28 never events includes: The Leapfrog Group offers four actions as industry standards following a never event:
