 The medical effects of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima upon humans can be put into the four categories below, with the effects of larger thermonuclear weapons producing blast and thermal effects so large that there would be a negligible number of survivors close enough to the hypocenter who would experience prompt/acute radiation effects, effects, which were observed after the 16 kiloton yield Hiroshima bomb, due to its relatively low yield: Fallout exposure - Depending on if further afield individuals Shelter in place or evacuate perpendicular to the direction of the wind, and therefore avoid contact with the fallout plume, and stay there for the days and weeks after the nuclear explosion, their exposure to fallout, and therefore their total dose, will vary. With those who do shelter in place, and or evacuate, experiencing a total dose that would be negligible in comparison to someone who just went about their life as normal. Staying indoors until after the most hazardous fallout isotope, I-131 decays away to 0.1% of its initial quantity after ten half lifes - which is represented by 80 days in I-131s case. Would make the difference between likely contracting Thyroid cancer or escaping completely from this substance depending on the actions of the individual. Some scientists estimate that if there were a nuclear war resulting in 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear explosions on cities, comparable to the construction of Hiroshima 1945, it could cause significant loss of life in the tens of millions from long term climatic effects alone. The climatology hypothesis is that if each city firestorms, a great deal of soot could be thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, cutting out sunlight for years on end, causing the disruption of food chains, in what is termed a Nuclear Winter scenario. The main causes of death and disablement in this state are thermal burns and the failure of structures resulting from the blast effect. Injury from the pressure wave is minimal in contrast because the human body can survive up to 2 bar (30 psi) while most buildings can only withstand a 0.8 bar (12 psi) blast. Therefore, the fate of humans is closely related to the survival of the buildings around them. In a nuclear explosion the human body can be irradiated by at least three processes. The first, and most major, cause of burns is due to thermal radiation and not caused by ionizing radiation. In the picture above, the normal clothing (a Kimono) that the woman was wearing attenuated the far reaching thermal radiation, the kimono however would have naturally been unable to attenuate any gamma radiation, if they were close enough to the weapon to have experienced any, and it would be likely that any such penetrating radiation effect would be evenly applied to her entire body. Beta burns would be likely all over the body if there was contact with fallout after the explosion, unlike thermal burns which are only ever on one side of the body, as heat radiation infrared naturally does not penetrate the human body. In addition, the pattern on her clothing has been burnt into the skin by the thermal radiation. This is because white fabric reflects more visible and infrared light than dark fabric. As a result, the skin underneath dark fabric is burned more than the skin covered by white clothing. There is also the risk of internal radiation poisoning by ingestion of fallout particles, if one is in a fallout zone. Radiation poisoning, also called "radiation sickness" or a "creeping dose", is a form of damage to organ tissue due to excessive exposure to ionizing radiation. The term is generally used to refer to acute problems caused by a large dosage of radiation in a short period, though this also has occurred with long term exposure to low level radiation. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning occur as ionizing radiation interferes with cell division. There are numerous lethal radiation syndromes including prodromal syndrome, bone marrow death, central nervous system death and gastrointestinal death. In prodromal (initial) syndrome, a dose of 1.5 gray or less is not lethal, but causes gastrointestinal distress such as anorexia, nausea, fatigue and possibly diarrhea. Bone marrow death is caused by a dose of radiation between 2 and 10 gray and is characterized by the part of the bone marrow that makes the blood being broken down. Therefore production of red and white blood cells and platelets is stopped by division of precursor stem cells ceasing (4.5 gray kills 95% of stem cells). The loss of platelets greatly increases the chance of fatal hemorrhage. While the lack of white blood cells causes septicemia infections, the fall in red blood cells is minimal and only causes mild anemia. The exposure to 4.5 gray of penetrating gamma rays has many effects that occur at different times: In 24 hours: These will usually abate after 6–7 days. Within 3–4 weeks there is a period of extreme illness. The peak incidence of acute BM death corresponds to the 30 day nadir in blood cell numbers. The number of deaths then falls progressively until it reaches 0 at 60 days after irradiation. The amount of radiation greatly affects the probability of death. For example over the range of 2 to 6 gray the probability of death in untreated adults goes from about 1% to 99%, but these figures are for healthy adults. Therefore results may differ because of the thermal and mechanical injuries and infectious conditions. Gastrointestinal death is caused by a dose of radiation between 10 and 50 gray. Whole body doses cause damage to epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract and this combined with the bone marrow damage is fatal. All symptoms become increasingly severe causing exhaustion and emaciation in a few days and death within 7–14 days from loss of water and electrolytes. The symptoms of gastrointestinal death are: Central nervous system death is the main cause of death in 24–48 hours among those exposed to 50 gray. The symptoms are: The skin is susceptible to beta-emitting radioactive fallout. The principal site of damage is the germinal layer, and often the initial response is erythema (reddening) due to blood vessels congestion and edema. Erythema lasting more than 10 days occurs in 50% of people exposed to 5-6 gray. Other effects with exposure include: The lungs are the most radiosensitive organ, and radiation pneumonitis can occur leading to pulmonary insufficiency and death (100% after exposure to 50 gray of radiation), in a few months. Radiation pneumonitis is characterized by: A single dose of 1-2 gray will cause temporary damage and suppress menstruation for periods up to 3 years; a dose of 4 gray will cause permanent sterility. A dose of 0.1 gray will cause low sperm count for up to a year; 2.5 gray will cause sterility for 2 to 3 years or more. 4 gray will cause permanent sterility. The timespan for developing this symptom ranges from 6 months to 30 years to develop but the median time for developing them is 2–3 years. Cancer induction is the most significant long term risk of exposure to a nuclear bomb. Approximately 1 out of every 80 people exposed to 1 gray will die from cancer and 1 in 40 people will get cancer. Different types of cancer take different times for them to appear: A 1 gray (unit) dose of radiation will cause between 0 and 20 extra cases of perinatal mortality, per 1,000 births and 0-20 cases per 1000 births of severe mental sub normality. A 0.05 gray dose will increase death due to cancer 10 fold, from the normal 0.5 per 1000 birth rate to a rate of 5 per 1,000. An antenatal dose of 1 gray in the first trimester causes the lifetime risk of fatal cancer sometime in the child's life to increase from, ~25% in non exposed humans, to 100% in the first trimester 1 gray exposed. Exposure to even relatively low doses of radiation generates genetic damage in the progeny of irradiated rodents. This damage can accumulate over several generations. In humans however, Microcephaly is the only proven malformation, or congenital abnormality, found in the in Utero developing Human fetuses present during the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. No statistically demonstrable increase of congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the Nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities than the Japanese average. It was assumed in the 1983 book "Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War." that although not caused by radiation, one of the long term effects of a nuclear war would be a massive increase in infectious diseases caused by fecal matter contaminated water from untreated sewage, crowded living conditions, poor standard of living, and lack of vaccines in the aftermath of a nuclear war, with the following list of diseases being cited: However although what the authors describe are conditions already prevalent in many of the world's city slums, it is inconceivable why people would try to remain living in crowded conditions by reverting to slum lifestyles, during or after a nuclear war. As many cities would already be destroyed, with urban life, slum or otherwise, therefore serving no benefit to inhabitants. There would be billions of disease carriers, in the form of city residents, lying deceased in cities caused by the direct nuclear weapons effects alone, with the surviving few billion people spread out in rural communities living agrarian lifestyles, with the survivors therefore posing a way of living far less prone to creating the crowded slum living conditions required for infectious diseases to spread. Moreover, as reported in a paper published in the journal Public Health Reports, it is also one of a number of prevalent myths that infectious diseases always occur after a disaster in cities.
