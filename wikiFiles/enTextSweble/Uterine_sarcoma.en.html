 A uterine sarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the smooth muscle or connective tissue of the uterus. Subtypes include leiomyosarcomas, endometrial stromal sarcomas, carcinosarcomas and "other" sarcomas. Leiomyosarcomas are now staged using the 2009 FIGO staging system (previously they were staged like endometrial carcinomas) at time of surgery. Endometrial stromal sarcomas and uterine adenosarcomas are classified as above, with the exception of different classifications for Stage I tumors. Finally, malignant mixed MÃ¼llerian tumors, a type of carcinosarcoma, are staged similarly to endometrial carcinomas. Unusual or postmenopausal bleeding may be a sign of a malignancy including uterine sarcoma and needs to be investigated. Other signs include pelvic pain, pressure, and unusual discharge. A nonpregnant uterus that enlarges quickly is suspicious. However, none of the signs are specific. Specific screening test have not been developed; a Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer and not designed to detect uterine sarcoma. Investigations by the physician include imaging (ultrasound, CAT scan, MRI) and, if possible, obtaining a tissue diagnosis by biopsy, hysteroscopy, or D&C. Ultimately the diagnosis is established by the histologic examination of the specimen. Typically malignant lesions have >10 mitosis per high power field. In contrast a uterine leiomyoma as a benign lesion would have < 5 mitosis per high power field. Therapy is based on staging and patient condition and utilizes one or more of the following approaches. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy if feasible involving total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Other approaches include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Prognosis is relatively poor. The vast majority of malignancies of the uterine body are endometrial carcinomas - only about 4% will be uterine sarcomas. Generally, the cause of the lesion is not known, however patients with a history of pelvic radiation are at higher risk. Most tumors occur after menopause. Women who take long-term tamoxifen are at higher risk.
