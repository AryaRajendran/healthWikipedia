 Wolfiporia extensa (Peck) Ginns (formerly known as Poria cocos F.A. Wolf) is a fungus in the Polyporaceae family. It is a wood-decay fungus but has a terrestrial growth habit. It is notable in the development of a large, long-lasting underground sclerotium that resembles a small coconut. This sclerotium (called "Tuckahoe", or Indian bread) was used by Native Americans as a source of food in times of scarcity. It is also used as a medicinal mushroom in Chinese medicine. Common names include hoelen, poria, tuckahoe, China root, fu ling (茯苓), and matsuhodo.
