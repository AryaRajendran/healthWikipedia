 Pakistan Red Crescent Society The United States does not have a centralized blood donation service. The American Red Cross collects a little less than half of the blood used, the other half is collected by independent agencies, most of which are members of America's Blood Centers. The US military collects blood from service members for its own use, but also draws blood from the civilian supply.
