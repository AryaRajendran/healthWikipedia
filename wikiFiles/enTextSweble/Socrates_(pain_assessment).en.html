 SOCRATES is a mnemonic acronym used by emergency medical services, doctors, nurses and other health professionals to evaluate the nature of pain that a patient is experiencing. The acronym is used to gain an insight into the patient's condition, and to allow the Health Care Provider to develop a plan for dealing with it.
