 Bart syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the association of congenital localized absence of skin, epidermolysis bullosa, lesions of the mouth mucosa, and dystrophic nails. The disease is inherited by autosomal dominant transmission with complete penetrance but variable expression. This means that children of an affected parent that carries the gene have a 50% chance of developing the disorder, although the extent to which they are affected is variable. Bart syndrome is caused by ultrastructural abnormalities in the anchoring fibrils. Genetic linkage of the inheritance of the disease points to the region of chromosome 3 near the collagen, type VII, alpha 1 gene (COL7A1).
