 Macrencephaly (from Greek "makros" - big, large and "enkephalos" - brain) is a condition present at or soon after birth in which the brain is abnormally large. Generally this is the case when its measures are statistically more than 97% of the population. The brain can become larger due to certain diseases like Alexander disease, later phases of the Tay-Sachs disease, and spongy degeneration of infancy. The large growth of the brain is usually not caused by the formation of tumors. Macrencephaly is also known as macrencephalia and macroencephaly. See also: cephalic disorders.
