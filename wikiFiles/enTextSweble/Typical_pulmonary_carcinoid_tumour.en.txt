 Typical pulmonary carcinoid tumour is an uncommon low-grade malignant lung mass that is most often in the central airways of the lung. It is also known as typical lung carcinoid tumour, lung carcinoid, and typical lung carcinoid. Lung carcinoids typically present with a cough or hemoptysis. Findings may closely mimic malignant tumours of the lung, i.e. lung cancer. The definitive diagnosis is rendered by a microscopic examination, after excision. Typical carcinoids have cells with stippled chromatin and a moderate quantity of cytoplasm. They typically have few mitoses and lack necrosis. By definition, they are greater than 4 mm in largest dimension; smaller lesions are referred to as pulmonary carcinoid tumourlets. The differential diagnosis of typical pulmonary carcinoid tumour includes: atypical pulmonary carcinoid tumour, pulmonary carcinoid tumourlet and lung adenocarcinoma. Typical carcinoids are usually treated with surgical excision.
