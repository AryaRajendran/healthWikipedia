 Hyperchloremia is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is an abnormally elevated level of the chloride ion in the blood. The normal serum range for chloride is 97 to 107 mEq/L. Hyperchloremia is defined as a chloride concentration exceeding this level. Hyperchloremia can affect oxygen transport. Often hyperchloremia does not produce any symptoms. However, hyperchloremia is sometimes associated with excess fluid loss such as vomiting and diarrhea. If the sufferer were to be a diabetic, hyperchloremia could lead to poor control of blood sugar concentration, which could cause it to become elevated. Hyperchloremia can be symptomatic with signs of Kussmaul's breathing, weakness, and intense thirst. Elevations in chloride may be associated with administration significant amounts of IV normal saline, diarrhea, certain kidney diseases as Renal tubular acidosis type II (Lightwood syndrome), Renal tubular acidosis type I, and overactivity of the parathyroid glands. Hyperchloremia is often comorbid with diabetes or hyponatremia. Certain drugs, especially diuretics such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, hormonal treatments, and polypharmacy, may contribute to this disorder. As with most types of electrolyte imbalance, the treatment of high blood chloride levels is based on correcting the underlying cause.
