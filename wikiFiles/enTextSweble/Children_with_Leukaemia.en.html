 Children With Leukaemia is a British charitable organisation, inaugurated by Diana, Princess of Wales on 12 January 1988, that provides funding for research into the prevention and cure of childhood leukaemia including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (lymphoid) (ALL) and Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It also supports families through welfare programmes and campaigns on their behalf. Children With Leukaemia is a member of the Association of Medical Research Charities and the National Cancer Research Institute1. The organisation’s objects are Children With Leukaemia is the registered working name of Children with Cancer UK. It was constituted as a charity under a Trust Deed dated 4 January 1988, in memory of Paul O'Gorman who died of leukaemia on 6 February 1987 and his sister Jean, who died on 3 November 1987, also of cancer. Children With Leukaemia has become a major funder of scientific research and since 2004 this funding has been granted by a peer-reviewed process as recognised by the Association of Medical Research Charities. Applications for funding are initially reviewed by a panel made up of at least two members of the organisation’s Scientific Advisory Committee and relevant external reviewers from within the appropriate scientific field. This process results in the funding of world-class research. Children With Leukaemia research endeavours to investigate what causes childhood leukaemia and, ultimately, how to prevent it. Children With Leukaemia is working to develop treatments which are not only more effective, driving up the survival rate, but which are less punishing, reducing the risk of the side-effects associated with current treatments. Children With Leukaemia allocates significant funding towards welfare projects that are designed to help children and families cope with the trauma of leukaemia diagnosis and treatment. Funding of childhood leukaemia research centres The Paul O’Gorman Childhood Leukaemia Research Centre at Great Ormond Street opened in 1995 and now houses one of the UK’s leading leukaemia research teams. Since then Children With Leukaemia has helped to develop many other childhood leukaemia research centres around the UK – including centres in Bristol, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle. Little is currently known about what causes children to develop leukaemia. The number of new cases being diagnosed has been increasing, suggesting that aspects of our changing lifestyle may play a role. Children With Leukaemia is working with policy makers to raise awareness of the association between childhood leukaemia and high-voltage power lines. It is seeking to gain support for a building moratorium to stop new houses being built near power lines. Children With Leukaemia raises awareness of childhood leukaemia by providing information to the public on new scientific research and through celebrity appeals and fundraising efforts. Children With Leukaemia hosts a variety of fundraising events throughout the year. Some of these include the Opera at Syon, The Amazing Great Children’s Party and the Captains Cup Tournament. The organisation also offers a variety of opportunities for individual fundraising. It organises Overseas Challenges for individuals to explore the world and raise money. It also offers help and advice to individuals or groups that wish to organise their own events or challenges for fundraising. Children With Leukaemia receives no government funding and relies entirely on donations. A substantial amount of the money needed to fund research is obtained through fundraising events.
