 Livedo reticularis is a common skin finding consisting of a mottled reticulated vascular pattern that appears like a lace-like purplish discoloration of the skin. The discoloration is caused by swelling of the venules owing to obstruction of capillaries by thrombi. It can be caused by any condition that makes venules swell. The condition may be normal or may be related to more severe underlying pathology. It has a broad differential diagnosis, broadly divided into possible blood diseases, autoimmune (rheumatologic) diseases, heart (cardiovascular) diseases, cancers, and endocrine disorders. It can usually (in 80% of cases) be diagnosed by biopsy. It may be aggravated by exposure to cold and occurs most often in the lower extremities. The condition's name derives from the Latin livere meaning bluish and reticular which refers to the net-like appearance. A number of conditions may cause the appearance of livedo reticularis: Other than identifying and treating any underlying conditions in secondary livedo, idiopathic livedo reticularis itself may improve with warming the legs, but once established the skin discolouration may become permanent.
