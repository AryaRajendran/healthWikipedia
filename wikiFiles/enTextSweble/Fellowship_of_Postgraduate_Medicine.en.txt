 The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine is a British non-profit organisation that was founded after World War I and pioneered the development of postgraduate educational programmes in all branches of medicine. Its foundation in the autumn of 1919 was the results of a merger between the Fellowship of Medicine and the Postgraduate Medical Association and Sir William Osler became the first president of the new organisation. The fellowship is supported by national and international fellows with expertise in the practice of medicine, medical education, clinical research, and related disciplines. The office and meeting rooms of the fellowship are in Central London. It is governed by a council that meets quarterly. The fellowship aims to achieve its objectives through publications, organising educational meetings and supporting other relevant activities. The fellowship hosts a range of seminars and conferences. The fellowship is a major supporter of the International Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine.
