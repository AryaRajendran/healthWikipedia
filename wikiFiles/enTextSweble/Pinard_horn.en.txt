 A Pinard horn is a medical device used to monitor the heart rate of a fetus during pregnancy. It is a type of stethoscope, formerly called a "fetoscope", but the term is still sometimes associated with the Pinard stethoscope. The horn is made of wood or metal and is hollow. It is about 8 inches long. It functions similarly to an ear trumpet by amplifying sound. The wide end of the horn is held against the pregnant woman's belly, while the doctor, nurse, or midwife listens through the other end. The Pinard horn was invented by Dr. Adolphe Pinard, a French obstetrician, during the 19th century. Pinard was an early supporter of advancements in prenatal care, including closer fetal health monitoring. Pinard horns continue to be used around the world, particularly by midwives, but also by doctors and nurses. Pinard horns are the most common fetal stethoscopes in much of Europe, even today, which surprises some doctors from the United States, where a Doppler ultrasound is standard. It is still considered a practical device. It provides an alternative to more expensive technology, such as the Doppler ultrasound procedure. A midwife in Mexico describes using the Pinard horn: A Pinard horn may be used to determine the position of the fetus. A Pinard horn is more precise than a Doppler ultrasound for this purpose. A Doppler device detects a heart tone farther away from the location of origin. A Pinard horn must be pressed to a location very close to the fetal heart in order to detect it, providing a more accurate indication of fetal position. A doctor, nurse, or midwife can also use palpation and auscultation to determine fetal position.
