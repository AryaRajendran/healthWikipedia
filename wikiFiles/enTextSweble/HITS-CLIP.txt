 High-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) is a genome-wide means of mapping proteinâ€“RNA binding sites in vivo. HITS-CLIP was originally used to generate genome-wide protein-RNA interaction maps for the neuron-specific RNA-binding protein and splicing factor NOVA1 and NOVA2; since then a number of other splicing factor maps have been generated, including those for PTB, RbFox2, SFRS1, and hnRNP C. HITS-CLIP of the RNA-binding protein Argonaute has been performed for the identification of microRNA targets by decoding microRNA-mRNA and protein-RNA interaction maps in mouse brain, and subsequently in Caenorhabditis elegans, embryonic stem cells and tissue culture cells. Recently, improved bioinformatics applied to Argonaute HITS-CLIP enables identification of binding sites with single nucleotide resolution.
