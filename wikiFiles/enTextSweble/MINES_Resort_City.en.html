 MINES Resort City is an integrated Health and Wellness resort city in Malaysia. It is both an expansion and transformation of the current MINES Resort City. The expansion of the city is part of the government’s Economic Transformation Plan (ETP) which is spearheaded by PEMANDU (Performance Management and Delivery Unit), under the Prime Minister’s Department. It was announced on 11 January 2011 by the Prime Minister of Malaysia Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. MINES Resort City is located south of the federal district of Kuala Lumpur in Seri Kembangan, Selangor. The land was formerly the world's largest open cast tin mine. It consists of Palace of the Golden Horses, Mines Wellness Hotel, Golden Horses Health Sanctuary, The Mines Shopping Mall, MINES Waterfront Business Park, MINES Resort & Golf Club, Malaysia International Exhibition & Convention Centre (MIECC), The Heritage and MINES 2 Streetmall. MINES Resort City was formerly the site of the Hong Fatt Mine, which was the largest opencast tin mine in the world, covering 1,300 acres, including the lakes. Malaysian Government alienated the land to Country Heights Holdings Bhd (CHHB) on 30 March 1988 for the development of recreational and tourism. Country Heights Holdings Berhad is founded by Y.Bhg. Tan Sri Dato' Seri Lee Kim Yew and incorporated officially on the 10th May 1984 under a private limited company with the name of Kurniata Sdn Bhd. In order to complement the tourism theme, a five-star hotel, the Palace of the Golden Horses 1 with a distinctive architectural design and Mines Wellness Hotel 2 (formerly known as The Mines Beach Resort and Spa) with a man-made beach and swimming lagoon were built. Other components of development completed to date within the Mines Resort City are the Mines Shopping Fair and a theme park named Mines Wonderland. In March 2010, CapitaMalls Asia has re-branded Mines Shopping Fair to a contemporary neighborhood shopping mall with a major upgrading work, including additional retail space, revamping the carpark system, changing new wash rooms, creating additional link bridges and new sets of escalators inside the mall. The transformation of MINES Resort City into the nation's very first Wellness City is part of the government’s Economic Transformation Plan (ETP) which is spearheaded by PEMANDU (Performance Management and Delivery Unit), under the Prime Minister’s Department. The company transform the city to an integrated health and wellness city, which will serve as a one-stop destination for both modern and complementary medicine. By the year 2020, the City is envisioned to be a RM 5.5 billion development, playing a central role in tourism and becoming the foremost wellness destination in the country.
