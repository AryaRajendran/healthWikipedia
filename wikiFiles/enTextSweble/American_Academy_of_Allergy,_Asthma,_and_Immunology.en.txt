 Poliomyelitis or polio is a virus that causes a serious disease. It is spread from person to person. Most of the time, polio has no symptoms unless it goes into the blood. It is uncommon for it to enter the brain or spinal cord. If this does happen, it can cause one to become paralyzed. Vaccination with polio vaccines could stop the disease all over the world. Organizations like the World Health Organisation have been doing this. 32nd President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt so far was the only President to had polio.
