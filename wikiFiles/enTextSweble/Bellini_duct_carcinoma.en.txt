 Bellini duct carcinoma (BDC, also known as low-grade collecting duct carcinoma and tubulocystic carcinoma) is a type of kidney cancer that originates in the duct of Bellini of the kidney. It is rare, accounting for 1-3% of all kidney cancers. It is also recently described; a 2002 review found just 40 case reports worldwide. Previously, due to its location, BDC was commonly diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma or a subtype of renal cell carcinoma. However, BDC does not respond well to chemotherapy drugs used for renal cell carcinoma, and progresses and spreads more quickly. One small study reporting 20% survival at 2 years. BDC may be related to urothelial carcinoma aka transitional cell carcinoma, and case reports of treating BDC as for transitional cell carcinoma indicate some benefit. BDC is extremely rare, and thus hard to study. Currently, very few published works compare histopathological and clinical data. Because of this, there is no standard protocol for its diagnosis and treatment. This cancer has a distinctive "bubble wrap" appearance. It has been reported to occur together with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, and a cancer with intermediate histology also has been reported, leading to the suspicion that these cancers are related. Signs and symptoms are as for kidney cancer. BDC was thought to be renal cell carcinoma, until "recently developed techniques of lectin histochemistry" helped forward knowledge of kidney duct cancers.
