 Quebec Platelet Disorder (QPD) is a rare, autosomal dominant bleeding disorder described in a family from the province of Quebec in Canada. The disorder is characterized by large amounts of the fibrinolytic enzyme urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) in platelets. Consequently, stored platelet plasminogen is converted to plasmin, which is thought to play a role in degrading a number of proteins stored in platelet Î±-granules. These proteins include platelet factor V, Von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, thrombospondin-1, and osteonectin. There is also a quantitative deficiency in the platelet protein multimerin 1 (MMRN1). Furthermore, upon QPD platelet activation, u-PA can be released into forming clots and accelerate clot lysis, resulting in delayed-onset bleeding (12-24hrs after injury). Individuals with QPD are at risk for experiencing a number of bleeding symptoms, including joint bleeds, hematuria, and large brusing. In 2010, the genetic cause of QPD has been determined as a mutation involving an extra copy of the uPA (urokinase plasminogen activator) gene http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/115/6/1264.long. The mutation causes overproduction of an enzyme that accelerates blood clot breakdown. The discovery was found by a team of doctors at McMaster University, led by Dr. Catherine Hayward, a hematologist.
