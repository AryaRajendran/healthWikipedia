 The ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) is an American system of medical classification used for procedural codes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency responsible for maintaining the inpatient procedure code set in the U.S., contracted with 3M Health Information Systems in 1993 to design and then develop a procedure classification system to replace Volume 3 of ICD-9-CM. ICD-9-CM contains a procedure classification; ICD-10-CM does not. ICD-10-PCS is the result. ICD-10-PCS was initially released in 1998. It has been updated annually since that time. Each code consists of seven alphanumeric characters. The second through seventh characters mean the same thing within each section, but may mean different things in other sections. Each character can be any of 34 possible values the ten digits 0-9 and the 24 letters A-H,J-N and P-Z may be used in each character. The letters O and I excluded to avoid confusion with the numbers 0 and 1. There are no decimals in ICD-10-PCS Of the 72,081 codes in ICD-10-PCS, 62,022 are in the first section, "Medical and surgical". For medical/surgical, these are the root operation codes: 00 alteration; 01 bypass; 02 change; 03 control; 04 creation; 05 destruction; 06 detachment; 07 dilation; 08 division; 09 drainage; 0B excision; 0C extirpation; 0D extraction; 0F fragmentation; 0G fusion; 0H insertion; 0J inspection; 0K map; 0L occlusion; 0M reattachment; 0N release; 0P removal; 0Q repair; 0R replacement; 0S reposition; 0T resection; 0U supplement ; 0V restriction; 0X transfer; 0Y transplantation They can be grouped into several categories: Regions: 0 Head; 1 Cervical, 2 Thoracic, 3 Lumbar, 4 Sacrum, 5 Pelvis, 6 Lower extremities, 7 Upper extremities, 8 Rib cage, 9 Abdomen
