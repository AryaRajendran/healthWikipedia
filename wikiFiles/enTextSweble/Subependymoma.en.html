 A subependymoma is a type of brain tumor; specifically, it is a rare form of ependymal tumor. The prognosis for a subependymoma is better than for most ependymal tumors, and is considered a grade I/IV tumor in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. They are classically found within the fourth ventricle, typically have a well demarcated interface to normal tissue and do not usually extend into the brain parenchyma, like ependymomas often do. The diagnosis is based on tissue, e.g. a biopsy. Histologically subependymomas consistent of microcystic spaces and bland appearing cells without appreciable nuclear atypia or mitoses. The nuclei tend to form clusters.
