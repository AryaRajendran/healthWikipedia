 William Beanes (24 January 1749 – 12 October 1828) was a medical doctor in the American Colonial Period. Beanes was the third generation of the same name and the fourth generation American. He was born near Croome in Prince George's County, Maryland. Little is known of his childhood except that he is of Scottish descent. Throughout his life he spoke with a Scottish accent. His parents were wealthy and owned large parcels of land in Prince George's County. Because of this Beanes grew up in a rural environment that was comfortable. Beanes may have been tutored for his basic education or otherwise graduated from a public school. It is known that he obtained initial medical education from one of the experienced medical practitioners in his town where he lived since there was no medical college in America at this time. Beanes began to practice medicine when he felt he was educated enough and qualified to do so. Beanes married Sarah Hawkins Hanson on November 25, 1773. She was the niece of John Hanson who became the president of the First Continental Congress and some say technically then was the first President of the United States. Beanes supported Boston’s position in the resistance of the Coercive Acts and was one of the committee of Prince Georgians who put into effect the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress. Beanes offered his medical services at the first General Hospital in Philadelphia after the Battles of Lexington and Concord. He also mended the wounded soldiers there from the Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Long Island and Valley Forge. Beanes bought land just outside of Upper Marlboro, Maryland in 1779. Here he built a house and began practicing medicine. He was also a farmer there and owned a local grist mill. In the later 18th century Beanes was a respected medical doctor and distinguished scientist with an excellent reputation. In 1799 he was one of the founders of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland with John Archer and his son. Beanes was in the limelight during the War of 1812. In the summer of 1814 the British landed near Benedict, Maryland. They marched to Upper Marlboro which was about 16 miles from Washington, D.C. The town was mostly deserted except for its most prominent citizen, Beanes. He offered British General Robert Ross and Admiral George Cockburn the use of his house as his headquarters from August 22 until the afternoon of August 23. Because of this, Ross believed Beans was sympathetic to the British. There was no resistance to the British in town, which additionally confirmed the notion. The British continued their march onto Washington and entered Bladensburg which was about eight miles east of Washington. There they encountered American resistance in the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814. After a decisive victory by the British they continued to Washington and burned some public buildings, including the White House. On their return trip back to their ships they again stopped briefly at Upper Marlboro. Some British deserters plundered some of the small farms in the area. Robert Bowie, who was a former governor of Maryland, and owned some farmland in the area, decided he was going to take matters into his own hands and do something about it. He was able to get the help of Beanes, who in turn was able to get Dr. William Hill and Philip Weems to participate. They then captured a few of the deserters and took them to the county jail. One escaped and went straight away to Ross and told him about the captives. Ross was furious to think that he was misled by Beanes’ earlier hospitality and that it was perhaps just a ruse on Beanes’ part. It could have been that the marauders, lied accusing Beanes of undue vehemence, but in either case Ross immediately put out an arrest for Beanes, Bowie, and four others. British soldiers seized Beanes, Bowie, Dr. Hill and Mr. Weems shortly after midnight. Upon receiving these men from the soldiers, Ross and Cockburn soon released Bowie and the others but took Beanes back to their ship. Brigadier general William H. Winder in a letter dated August 31 protested to no avail. Friends of Beanes went to Francis Scott Key, a lawyer in Georgetown, for help on the release of the elderly doctor. Key got the permission of President James Madison who also sent John Stuart Skinner, the US Prisoner Exchange Agent for the region. Skinner and Key took one of Skinner's flag of truce vessels, a Chesapeake Bay cartel (the Minden), and set out to locate the British fleet in the Chesapeake Bay. Skinner and Key came across the British flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. They then had a meeting with Ross who refused to release Beanes. Skinner knew Beanes and the high reputation he had. He had the foresight to collect from wounded British soldiers left behind after the Battle of Bladensburg letters of how well they had been treated by the Americans. Skinner then pulled his trump card and gave Ross the letters. The soldiers wrote about what excellent medical treatment they were receiving by the Americans. Ross then had a change of heart and released Beanes. Skinner and Key with Beanes were allowed to go back to their ship, however were not allowed to go back to Baltimore. They were held eight miles off shore from Fort McHenry until the outcome of the Battle of Baltimore. Skinner, Key and Beanes had learned too much about British forces and plans of the attack on Baltimore to allow them free at that time. They were tied up to a British ship in the Chesapeake Bay and guarded by British soldiers until after the battle that started the morning of September 13, 1814. The three men watched the battle from their ship as it went into the night. There was a large flag put up at Fort McHenry that they could see, however eventually the smoke of British gunfire, cannons, Congreve rockets and nightfall obscured the flag. They could only look and hope for the best. When morning came on September 14, they saw the flag was still there. Fort McHenry had not been taken by the British. The British had broken off the attack in the night and were retreating. Skinner, Key, and Beanes were released to go back home on their ship. They arrived at Baltimore on September 16. Key was inspired to write a poem of the event on the back of a letter, which ultimately became the Star Spangled Banner. Beanes was the incidental cause for the reason why Key wrote the poem that led to the American national anthem. Some historians think it was the morning of September 13, instead of September 14, when Key saw the flag was still there and wrote his famous poem, later called "The Star-Spangled Banner." Some historians think the name of the sloop / cartel that Key, Skinner, and Beanes were on when they viewed the Battle of the Baltimore was instead The President. A letter dated Washington, 1856 from Chief-Justice R. B. Taney, brother-in-law of Francis Scott Key, to Judge Joseph Hopper Nicholson states that Key, Skinner, and Beanes were transferred back off the British vessel Surprise to their own "flag of truce" vessel usually employed as a cartel, but of an unknown name. From their own vessel they then viewed the battle and where Key was inspired to write his famous poem when he immediately jotted down the lines before being released by the British to go back to land. Still another report about a Mrs. George H. Pendleton (daughter of Key) says Key wrote the poem on September 14, however also from an unnamed vessel that was of American nature, but not the British vessel Surprise.. Still other reports say the ship HMS Minden was not involved in the Battle of Baltimore and as far away as Java. The Boston Daily Globe reports in 1886: A letter of brother-in-law of Key, a Judge Taney, says in part as reported by the Pennsylvania Magazine 1898 p. 22-3: The same letter goes on to say: According to the Maryland Historical Society upon release of Beanes from the British, he, along with Skinner and Key, were put on the sloop Minden on or about September 8 to sail up the Chesapeake Bay toward Baltimore. They were guarded by British soldiers along with a fleet of some forty vessels going to attack Fort McHenry. The Minden had it sails removed and was towed by the British frigate Surprize. The British fleet arrived at Baltimore between September 11 and September 13. The battle on Fort McHenry then began during the early morning hours of September 13. When Key saw the next morning that the flag was still flying after a fierce battle he was inspired then and there on the Minden to write on the back of a letter the poem "To Anacreon in Heaven", which ultimately became the Star-Spangled Banner. Beanes spent the remainder of his life on Academy Hill in Upper Marlboro. He died there in 1828 with his wife preceding him in 1822.
