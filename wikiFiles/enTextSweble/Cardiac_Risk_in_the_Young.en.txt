 Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) is a humanitarian charitable organization helping to raise awareness of cardiac risk, Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD), Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS, SADS). Established in May 1995 by Alison Cox (MBE) and based in the United Kingdom. The former tennis player Mark Cox is one of its patrons. The organisation initially promotes the heart screening of young people through ECG Testing Programmes and contributes to medical research. CRY holds ECG screening clinics for those aged 14 to 35 at three locations in the UK. The charity also offers support to those who have suffered a loss through a network of affected families & counselling groups, heart screening, ECG testing, sponsors medical research, donates medical equipment to surgeries and hospitals, funds the CRY Centre for Sports Cardiology at the Olympic Medical Institute and the CRY Centre for Cardiac Pathology. Some of the CRY's programmes, mainly the counselling programme, are financed by a grant from the Department of Health. On the 15th July 2004 CRY launched its National Postcard Campaign to highlight the deaths of eight young people per week from undiagnosed heart problems by featuring their pictures. The campaign was launched at a Parliamentary Reception in Westminster. From August 2004 the Postcard has been re-launched as region specific including South West, North East, South, North West, Scotland and Wales versions. In February 2009 the postcard campaign was updated to "12 a week" and continues to draw attention the number of young people with undetected heart conditions.
