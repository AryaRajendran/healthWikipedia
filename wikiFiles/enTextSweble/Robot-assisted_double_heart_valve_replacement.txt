 The first robotic-assisted double heart valve replacement was carried out in the Chennai region of India at Chettinad Hospital. Considered a rare form of surgery, this is the first instance of such a procedure using robotic surgery. The surgery was carried out by Dr R Ravi Kumar, who is the director of the Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and head of robotic surgery centre at the Chettinad Health clinic.
