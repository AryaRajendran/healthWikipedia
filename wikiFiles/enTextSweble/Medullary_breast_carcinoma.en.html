 Medullary breast carcinoma is a rare type of breast cancer that often can be treated successfully. It is marked by lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in and around the tumor that can be seen when viewed under a microscope. This is the only breast cancer associated with a loss of function mutation in BRCA1, and thus the only form associated with a hereditary mutation. HER2/NEU over-expression is associated with sporadic breast cancer. This is one of five important types of epithelial breast cancer: ductal, lobular, medullary, colloid, and tubular. This is the only breast cancer associated with a loss of function mutation in BRCA1, and thus the only form associated with a hereditary mutation. HER2/NEU over-expression is associated with sporadic breast cancer.
