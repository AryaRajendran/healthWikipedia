 Vas-occlusive contraception is an experimental male contraceptive method that is not yet approved for general use. Proposed methods of vas-occlusive contraception attempt to prevent sperm from traveling down the vasa deferentia. Potential methods include clips, plugs, valves, and other devices. The intra vas device (IVD), analogous to the intrauterine device (IUD) for women, is meant to be a reversible alternative to a vasectomy. The device consists of a set of flexible, hollow silicone plugs, each about a millimetre in diameter and 2.5 cm long. The IVDs are inserted into the vas deferens and block the flow of sperm from the testes to the seminal vesicles. , human clinical trials are being performed to evaluate its effectiveness as a contraceptive. One version is currently in research and development by Shepherd Medical in Vancouver. Another version currently being researched in China is an elastomer plug device, using medical-grade polyurethane (MPU) and silicone rubber (MSR) injected as a liquid. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved human clinical trials for the intra-vas device in 2006. The procedure is expected to have similar side effects to vasectomy, such as formation of sperm antibodies.
