 Alopecia universalis or alopecia areata universalis is a medical condition involving rapid loss of all hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the most severe form of alopecia areata, with an incidence of .001% (1 in 100,000). Alopecia universalis can occur at any age, and is currently believed to be an autoimmune disorder. There is no standard treatment for alopecia universalis. Many treatments have been explored, including immunomodulatory agents such as imiquimod. Alopecia universalis may be acute and short-lived or remain permanently. Regrowth is always a possibility, even for those with 100% hair loss over many years. However, it is not possible to predict when regrowth will occur.
