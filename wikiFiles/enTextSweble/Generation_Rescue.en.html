 Generation Rescue is a nonprofit organization that advocates the view that autism and related disorders are primarily caused by environmental factors, particularly vaccines. These claims are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence. The group gained widespread attention through use of an aggressive media campaign, including sponsoring full page ads in the New York Times and USA Today. Today, Generation Rescue is known as a platform for Jenny McCarthy's autism and anti-vaccine advocacy. The organization was established in 2005 by Lisa and J.B. Handley and 150 volunteer "Rescue Angels" that included many members of the biomedical treatment movement at the time. Beginning in the spring of 2005 and running through January 2007, Generation Rescue began a national media campaign in the US, placing advertisements in such publications as USA Today. More recently it has been fronted by Jenny McCarthy, an author, television personality and former Playboy model. Jim Carrey, during his relationship with McCarthy, also promoted Generation Rescue. Generation Rescue believes that autism and other developmental issues are caused by environmental factors. Its members primarily blame vaccines, the increase in the number of vaccines administered, and thiomersal, a mercury-based vaccine preservative. Generation Rescue claims that biomedical intervention can help children recover. The hypotheses that vaccines, such as MMR, or thiomersal cause autism are not supported by scientific evidence, nor are claims that diets or drugs can cure autism. Because of Generation Rescue's public profile through national advertising and because its point of view is not shared by the mainstream medical community, its message has been controversial and the organization has been described as anti-vaccine. Claims that the MMR vaccine causes autism, promoted by Andrew Wakefield, were declared in January 2011 to be based on manipulated data and fraudulent research. Parental concerns over vaccines have led, in turn, to decreased immunization rates and an increased incidence of whooping cough and measles, a highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease. Generation Rescue issued a statement that the "media circus" following the revelation of fraud and manipulation of data was "much ado about nothing". Salon.com responded to Generation Rescue's statement with: But any organization using a celebrity to mislead parents with claims of "new" data that rely on decade-old vaccine formulas and schedules is more than disingenuous, it's flat-out dangerous. It maintains three websites, Generation Rescue Fourteen Studies.org, and PutChildrenFirst. Generation Rescue details the organization’s points of view described above. PutChildrenFirst alleges a cover-up by the Centers for Disease Control concerning the role that vaccines have played in recent increases in the number of reported autism cases. Generation Rescue bases much of their case on publications that do not go through a proper peer review process. In particular, an article Generation Rescue publishes in its website, "Autism: A Novel Form of Mercury Poisoning" appeared in Medical Hypotheses, a journal without scientific peer review; the hypothesis has not been confirmed by credible scientific evidence. According to the BMJ, the implication that the MMR vaccine is linked to autism "relied on parental recall and beliefs … epidemiological studies consistently found no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. By the time the paper was finally retracted 12 years later, after forensic dissection at the General Medical Council's (GMC) longest ever fitness to practise hearing, few people could deny that it was fatally flawed both scientifically and ethically." Generation Rescue co-sponsors an annual conference at the Westin Hotel in Chicago along with another charity, Autism One. The choice of speakers at these conferences have led critics to accuse both organizations of promoting unproven therapies and harmful quackery. Generation Rescue and Autism One were criticized for including self-employed Maryland physician Mark Geier in their 2011 conference, despite the Maryland State Board of Physicians having suspended Geier's medical license. The board stated that Geier "endangers autistic children and exploits their parents by administering to the children a treatment protocol that has a known substantial risk of serious harm and which is neither consistent with evidence-based medicine nor generally accepted in the relevant scientific community." The board ruled that Geier misdiagnosed patients, diagnosed patients without sufficient tests, and recommended treatments without fully explaining the risks to parents. The board also ruled that Geier misrepresented his credentials, including during an interview before the panel. Geier lost his medical licenses in Washington, Virginia, and California shortly thereafter; he has also seen his licenses revoked and/or suspended in Florida and Indiana. One of the speakers at the 2012 conference was Kerri Rivera, the proprietor of an autism treatment clinic in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico. Rivera hosted a presentation promoting the Miracle Mineral Solution, or MMS, a liquid product containing chlorine dioxide that she claimed had cured thirty-eight children of autism. Several bloggers criticized the presentation, noting that MMS consists of the same chemical compound as industrial strength bleach and was thus potentially harmful to children being given the product, both orally and through enemas. MMS has been subject to a warning by the Food and Drug Administration, and by government health agencies in the United Kingdom and Belgium; MMS was banned outright in Canada in February 2012. Generation Rescue's second New York Times advertisement had to undergo one alteration due to one scientist who asked to be removed from the ad. Also, after the ad ran, several of the scientists thanked in the ad wanted to disassociate their work from the mercury/autism connection. This group of scientists wrote: "we believe Generation Rescue’s advertisement, at first appearance an innocuous gesture of appreciation, may actually mislead the public into thinking that the mercury–autism hypothesis has stronger support in the scientific literature than it actually does." Generation Rescue has asserted that countries that require fewer infant vaccines have lower infant mortality rates. However, this has been criticized as "rhetorical sleight of hand": in the U.S., a country that requires more vaccines than most, the infant mortality rate declined 50% from 1966 to 1981, during which the number of vaccines increased.
