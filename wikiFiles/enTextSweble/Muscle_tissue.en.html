 Muscle tissue is one of four basic biological tissues present in animals. It is a soft tissue that composes muscles. It is formed during embryo development in a process known as myogenesis. Muscle cells (myocytes) are elongated and classified and or compatible as either striated muscle cells or smooth muscle cells depending on the presence or absence, respectively, of organized, regularly repeated arrangements of myofibrillar contractile proteins called myofilaments. Striated muscle is further classified as either skeletal or cardiac muscle. Thus, muscle tissue can be described as being one of three different types: In vertebrates, there is a third muscle tissue recognized: Cardiac and skeletal muscles are "striated" in that they contain sarcomeres and are packed into highly regular arrangements of bundles; smooth muscle has neither. While skeletal muscles are arranged in regular, parallel bundles, cardiac muscle connects at branching, irregular angles (called intercalated discs). Striated muscle contracts and relaxes in short, intense bursts, whereas smooth muscle sustains longer or even near-permanent contractions. Skeletal muscle is further divided into several subtypes:
