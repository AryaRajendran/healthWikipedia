 The Malaria Atlas Project, abbreviated as MAP, is a non-profit project primarily funded by the Wellcome Trust, UK. MAP is a joint project between the Malaria Public Health & Epidemiology Group, Centre for Geographic Medicine, Kenya and the Spatial Ecology & Epidemiology Group, University of Oxford, UK, with collaborating nodes in Americas and Asia Pacific Region. Spatial medical intelligence is central to the effective planning of malaria control and elimination. Forty years have passed since the cartography of malaria worldwide was taken seriously. The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) was founded in 2005 to fill this niche for the malaria control community at a global scale. The MAP team have assembled a unique spatial database on linked information based on medical intelligence, satellite-derived climate data to constrain the limits of malaria transmission and the largest ever archive of community-based estimates of parasite prevalence. These data have been assembled and analysed by a team of geographers, statisticians, epidemiologists, biologists and public health specialists. The initial focus of MAP has been centred on predicting the endemicity of Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly form of the malaria parasite, due to its global epidemiological significance and its better prospects for elimination and control. Work in 2009 began to map the extent and burden of the relatively neglected Plasmodium vivax.
