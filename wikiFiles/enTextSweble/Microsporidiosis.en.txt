 Microsporidiosis is an opportunistic intestinal infection that causes diarrhea and wasting in immunocompromised individuals (HIV, for example). It results from different species of microsporidia, a group of microbial (unicellular) fungi. In HIV infected individuals, microsporidiosis generally occurs when CD4+ T cell counts fall below 100. Although it is classified as a protozoal disease in ICD-10, their phylogenetic placement has been resolved to be within the Fungi; however, they are highly divergent and rapidly evolving. As unicellular eukaryotes they are still generally considered to be Protists, and some sources classify microsporidiosis as a mycosis. At least 14 microsporidian species have been recognized as human pathogens, spread across eight genera: The primary causes are Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis.
