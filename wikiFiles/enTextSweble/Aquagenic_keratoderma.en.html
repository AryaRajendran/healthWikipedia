 Aquagenic keratoderma, also known as acquired aquagenic palmoplantar keratoderma, transient reactive papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma, aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma, and aquagenic wrinkling of the palms, is a skin condition characterized by the development of white papules on the palms after water exposure. The condition causes irritation of the palms when touching certain materials after being wet, e.g., paper, cloth. An association with cystic fibrosis has been suggested.
