 A urethrocele ( ) is the prolapse of the female urethra into the vagina. Weakening of the tissues that hold the urethra in place cause it to move and to put pressure on the vagina, leading to the descent of the anterior distal wall of the vagina. Urethroceles often occur with cystoceles, (involving the urinary bladder as well as the urethra). In this case, the term used is a cystourethrocele. Urethroceles are often caused by childbirth, the movement of the baby through the vagina causing damage to the surrounding tissues. When they occur in women who have never had children, they may be the result of a congenital weakness in the tissues of the pelvic floor. There are often no symptoms associated with a urethrocele. Where present, symptoms include stress incontinence, increased urinary frequency and difficulty in emptying the bladder. Pain during sexual intercourse may also occur. A urethrocele can be treated surgically. Where a urethrocele causes difficulty in urinating, this can lead to cystitis.
