 The Vanderbilt exoskeleton is a prototype powered exoskeleton designed by the Center for Intelligent Mechatronics at Vanderbilt University, Tennessee. It is intended to assist paraplegics, stroke victims and other paralyzed or semi-paralyzed people to walk independently. Motion and control technologies manufacturer Parker Hannifin is funding further development, and plans to release a commercial version of the exoskeleton in 2014. In 2012, there were estimated to be over 270,000 Americans with long-term spinal cord injuries, of whom around 21 percent suffer from complete paraplegia. The lifetime cost of care and lost productivity for each paraplegic ranges from US$1.4 million to $2.2 million. However, since the late 2000s, robotics and battery technology have become sufficiently advanced to make wearable walking assistance devices viable. The Vanderbilt exoskeleton weighs – lighter than most contemporary commercial medical exoskeletons – and can support users weighing up to . It is strapped to the user's legs, and uses an onboard computer to detect the user's movements, which are then supported and amplified by battery-powered motors in the exoskeleton's hip and knee joints. It also uses functional electrical stimulation to enervate the muscles of paralyzed patients, improving their strength and circulation, and can be quickly disassembled for easy removal. It can be used interchangeably with a wheelchair, and can be donned without assistance, allowing disabled individuals significantly greater independence. It is compact enough for a person to sit in a normal chair without needing to remove the exoskeleton. Vanderbilt University has been testing its exoskeleton with paraplegics and medical experts at a rehabilitation center in Atlanta, Georgia, since 2010. In October 2012, Parker Hannifin signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Vanderbilt University for the right to develop and manufacture a commercial version of the exoskeleton, which it plans to release in 2014. Whereas existing commercial exoskeletons can cost as much as $140,000, Parker Hannifin hopes to leverage its manufacturing capabilities and the Vanderbilt model's lightweight design to ensure that the final version is significantly cheaper.
