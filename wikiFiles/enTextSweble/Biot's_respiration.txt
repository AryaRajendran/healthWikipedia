 Biot's respiration, sometimes also called ataxic respiration, is an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by groups of quick, shallow inspirations followed by regular or irregular periods of apnea. It generally indicates a poor prognosis. It is named for Camille Biot, who characterized it in 1876. Biot's respiration is caused by damage to the medulla oblongata due to strokes or trauma or by pressure on the medulla due to uncal or tentorial herniation. It can be caused by opioid use. It is distinguished from ataxic respiration by having more regularity and similar-sized inspirations, whereas ataxic respirations are characterized by completely irregular breaths and pauses. As the breathing pattern deteriorates, it merges with ataxic respirations. In common medical practice, Biot's respiration is often clinically equivalent to Cheyne-Stokes respiration, although the two definitions are separated in some academic settings.
