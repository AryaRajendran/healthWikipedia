 The University of Central Florida College of Dental Medicine is a planned academic college of the University of Central Florida located in Orlando, Florida, USA. Approved by the UCF Board of Trustees in May 2011, the college still needs to seek approval from the Florida Board of Governors and accreditation from the American Dental Association. The university hopes to open the college in 2014. The college will consist of a public dental school located on the UCF Health Sciences Campus in the Lake Nona neighborhood of Orlando. In early May 2011, UCF announced that the Board of Trustees would consider a motion to create a new College of Dental Medicine. This followed a private donation of $10 million to the university for the purpose of creating a dental school. On May 26, 2011, the Board voted to approve the new college. The current dean of the UCF College of Medicine, Dr. Deborah C. German, will lead the effort to create the college.
