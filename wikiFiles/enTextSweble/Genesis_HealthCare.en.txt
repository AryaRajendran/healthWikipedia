Genesis HealthCare is headquartered in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. On April 1, 2011, Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN) completed the $2.4 billion acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of privately owned Genesis HealthCare, which was previously announced on February 28, 2011. In June 2012, Genesis HealthCare announced its plans to acquire Sun Healthcare Group. Genesis Health Ventures was established by Michael R. Walker in 1985 with acquisition of nine Centers. Between 1985 and 1998, Walker grew Genesis Health Ventures from a $32 million to a $2.4 billion public company through the acquisition of nursing homes and services such as rehabilitation therapy, diagnostic testing, respiratory therapy, and pharmacy. In 1999, the Federal government made drastic, unanticipated cuts to Medicare, which at that time funded virtually all the care for individuals admitted to Genesis Centers from hospitals. Genesis Health Ventures sought Chapter 11 protection in 2000. In 2001, the company reorganized and reemerged from bankruptcy. In 2003, Genesis Health Ventures’ separated the Company’s in-patient care and pharmacy divisions. As part of the separation, Genesis Health Ventures adopted the NeighborCare pharmacy division’s trade name, and spun off the Company’s Genesis ElderCare Skilled Nursing Centers, and Assisted Living and Independent Living Communities, as well as Genesis Rehabilitation Therapy Services, into a new entity – Genesis HealthCare Corporation. On July 13, 2007, Formation Capital and JER Partners completed the acquisition of Genesis HealthCare Corporation, previously (NASDAQ: GHCI).
