 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is an alliance of twenty-one cancer centers in the United States, most of which are designated by the National Cancer Institute (one of the U.S. National Institutes of Health) as comprehensive cancer centers. It is a non-profit organization with offices in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania. The mission of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is "to improve care, with respect to cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up." The main activity of the organization is the development and publication of practice guidelines for oncology care. These guidelines are developed by oncologists at the member cancer centers based on research evidence from clinical trials and other studies. NCCN also develops guidelines for patients. According to the organization, the goal of developing these guidelines "is to improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of oncology care." On April 1, 2009 the organization launched a consumer website with their cancer treatment summaries.
