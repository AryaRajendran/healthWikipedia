 Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a chemokine produced by macrophages and other cell types such as epithelial cells. It is also synthesized by endothelial cells, which store IL-8 in their storage vesicles, the Weibel-Palade bodies. In humans, the interleukin-8 protein is encoded by the IL8 gene. There are many receptors of the surface membrane capable to bind IL-8; the most frequently studied types are the G protein-coupled serpentine receptors CXCR1, and CXCR2. Expression and affinity to IL-8 is different in the two receptors (CXCR1 > CXCR2). Toll-like receptors are the receptors of the innate immune system. These receptors recognize antigen patterns (like LPS in gram negative bacteria). Through a chain of biochemical reactions, IL-8 is secreted and is an important mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response. IL-8, also known as neutrophil chemotactic factor, has two primary functions. It induces chemotaxis in target cells, primarily neutrophils but also other granulocytes, causing them to migrate toward the site of infection. IL-8 also induces phagocytosis once they have arrived. IL-8 is also known to be a potent promoter of angiogenesis. In target cells, IL-8 induces a series of physiological responses required for migration and phagocytosis, such as increase of intracellular Ca2+, exocytosis (e.g. histamine release), and respiratory burst. IL-8 can be secreted by any cells with toll-like receptors that are involved in the innate immune response. Usually, it is the macrophages that see an antigen first, and thus are the first cells to release IL-8 to recruit other cells. Both monomer and homodimer forms of IL-8 have been reported to be potent inducers of the chemokines CXCR1 and CXCR2. The homodimer is more potent, but methylation of Leu25 can block activity of the dimers. IL-8 is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by viral infection.{fact} IL-8 is a member of the CXC chemokine family. The genes encoding this and the other ten members of the CXC chemokine family form a cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 4q. While neutrophil granulocytes are the primary target cells of IL-8, there is a relative wide range of cells (endothelial cells, macrophages, mast cells, and keratinocytes) responding to this chemokine, too. The chemoattractant activity of IL-8 in similar concentrations to vertebrates was proven in Tetrahymena pyriformis, which refers to a phylogenetically well-conserved structure and function in the case of this chemokine. Interleukin-8 is often associated with inflammation. As an example, it has been cited as a proinflammatory mediator in gingivitis and psoriasis.1. The fact that Interleukin-8 secretion is increased by oxidant stress, which thereby causes the recruitment of inflammatory cells induces a further increase in oxidant stress mediators, making it a key parameter in localized inflammation. If a pregnant mother has high levels of interleukin-8, there is an increased risk of schizophrenia in her offspring. High levels of Interleukin 8 have been shown to reduce the likelihood of positive responses to antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia. IL-8 was renamed CXCL8 by the Chemokine Nomenclature Subcommittee of the International Union of Immunological Societies, although its approved HUGO gene symbol remains IL8.
