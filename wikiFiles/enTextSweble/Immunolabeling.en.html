 Immunolabeling is a biochemical process that enables the detection and localization of an antigen to a particular site within a cell, tissue, or organ. Antigens are organic molecules, usually a protein, capable of binding to an antibody. A tag links a antigen-specific antibody with a means of detection. This tag provides a way to observe the location of antigens to which the antibodies bind. If the immunolabeling process is meant to reveal information about a cell or its substructures, the process is called immunocytochemistry. Immunolabeling of larger structures is called immunohistochemistry. There are two complex steps in the manufacture of antibody for immunolabeling. The first is the production of antibody that binds specifically to the antigen of interest and the second is the fusion of a tag to said antibody. Since it is impractical to fuse a tag to every conceivable antigen-specific antibody, most immunolabeling processes use an indirect method of detection. This indirect method employs a primary antibody that is antigen-specific and a secondary antibody fused to a tag that specifically binds the primary antibody. This indirect approach permits mass production of secondary antibody that can be bought off the shelf. The indirect method first adds the primary antibody to the test system. The primary antibody seeks out and binds to the target antigen. The secondary antibody, which is designed to attach exclusively to the (otherwise invisible) primary antibody, is first tagged with a "visualizing" substance (such as a fluorescent compound, gold beads, particular epitope, or enzyme producing a colored compound) that is linked to the secondary antibody by a chemical bond and then added to the test system. The secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody (which has already bound itself to the target antigen), thus allowing the (indirect) identification and visualization of the antigen of interest in its native location in the tissue (e.g., in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, or nuclear membrane). Under certain conditions the method can be adapted to provide quantitative information. When the secondary antibody is tagged with a piece of gold (or material of similar density), the heavy, electron-dense metal is sufficiently impenetrable to electromagnetic radiation that light or electron microscopy can reveal the target entity's location. The resulting image is of great precision, thus increasing localization accuracy. The characteristic radiation emitted by fluorescent compound tags can be photographed or measured at the appropriate wavelength. The applications of immunolabeling are numerous. For example, immunolabeling can be used to identify the effects of a drug on a particular organ. First, the primary and secondary antibodies are added to a sample of the organ without the drug, then the sample is run through a light and/or electron microscope to get an initial control image (to see what is the normal distribution of the target antigen). Then, the drug is administered to another sample of the organ, followed by the primary and secondary antibodies. The drugged sample is then run through a light and/or electron microscope, and the resulting image helps identify which antigens are activated/induced after a drug is administered. This technique allows scientists to observe how the activated antigens differ from the antigens prior to the administration of the drug. Immunolabeling can be used in pharmacology, molecular biology, biochemistry and any other field where the precise location of an antibody-bindable molecule is desirable. There are two methods involved in immunolabeling, direct and indirect methods. Although an indirect method is more commonly used in immunolabeling, a direct method can still be used. In order to prevent any type of cross-reaction between the primary and secondary antibodies from the same species, a direct method (one layer antibody) can be used. However, there are more problems with the direct method over the indirect method. The direct method is not commonly used in laboratories since the primary antibodies must be covalently labeled, and it can require an abundant supply of purified antibody. Also, it can result in less sensitivity over the direct method. There are different indirect methods that are used due to their highly sensitive results. First, two-step protocols are used often to avoid the cross-reaction between the immunolabeling of multiple primary and secondary antibodies mixtures, where secondary Fab antibodies are frequently used. Secondly, haptenylated primary antibodies can be used, where the secondary antibody can recognize the associated hapten. The hapten is covalently linked to the antibody of interest by succinylimidesters or conjugated IgG Fc-specific Fab sections. Lastly, primary monoclonal antibodies that have different Ig isotypes can be detected by specific secondary antibodies that are against the isotype of interest. Overall, antibodies must bind to the antigens with a high specificity and affinity. The specificity of the binding of an antibody mandates that the antibody binds to the protein that is associated with the immunogen peptide. Scientists commonly use monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, which are composed of synthetic peptides. During the purification process of these antibodies, an immunizing peptide is attached to the affinity column, which decreases the likelihood that the antibodies will bind to unwanted epitope of the antigen not found on the initial peptide. Hence, the specificity of the antibody is established by the specific reaction with the protein or peptide that is used for immunization by specific methods (i.e., immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation). Much of the determination of specificity of antibodies lies within the type of synthetic peptides or purified proteins being used. Unfortunately, if the specificity of an antibody is not sufficient, it will greatly affect the binding of the antibody to the protein or peptide. For instance, in the case of synthetic peptides, the advantage is the amino acid sequence is easily detected; however, the peptides do no always reiterate the 3-D structural conformation or post-translational modification of the native form of the protein. Therefore, antibodies that are produced to work against a synthetic peptide may have problems with the native 3-D protein. These types of antibodies would lead to poor results in immunoprecipitation or immunohistochemistry experiments, yet the antibodies may be capable of binding to the denatured form of the protein during an immunoblotting run. On the contrary, if the antibody works well for purified proteins in their native form and not denatured, an immunoblot cannot be used as a standardized test to determine the specificity of the antibody binding, particularly in immunohistochemistry. In regards to an immunolabaling experiment, there was a study done with HeLa cells that were transfected with human fibrillarin and a green fluorescent tag (GFP), and the intensity of the tag was shown as both a weak and strong signal. The fixed (via formaldehyde) fibrillarin-GFP cells were immunolabeled with antibodies for fibrillarin, and these investigators found the nucleoli that had the weak GFP signal were strongly immunolabeled, whereas the strong GFP signal gave rise to weak immunolabeled stains.
