 NHS Sustainable Development Unit' is a British Government Agency with a mission to promote sustainable development for the National Health Service. The NHS was the first major organisation to measure its Scope 3 Supply Chain Carbon Emissions in 2008 and recognise that it was impossible to achieve its carbon reduction targets with out a significant reduction in supply chain emissions. This resulted in the creation of the Procure for Carbon Reduction (P4CR) program, and more recently a carbon hot spot project to build up the Scope 3 supply chain carbon emissions from the 4 million individual products purchased by the NHS. NHS SDU staff are based in Cambridge. NHS SDU was set up in 2008 by the CEO of the NHS Sir David Nicholson. NHS SDU has partnerships with the Global Green and Healthy Hospitals Initiative. It was formed by the NHS in England under the auspices of the Office of the Strategic Health Authorities (OSHA). It is now hosted by NHS Midlands and East and its Chief Executive, Sir Neil McKay.
