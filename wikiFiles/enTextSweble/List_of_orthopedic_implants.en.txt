 An orthopedic implant is a medical device manufactured to replace a missing joint or bone or to support a damaged bone. Internal fixation is an operation in orthopedics that involves the surgical implementation of implants for the purpose of repairing a bone. Among the most common types of medical implants are the pins, rods, screws and plates used to anchor fractured bones while they heal.
