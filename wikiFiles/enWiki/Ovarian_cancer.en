'''Ovarian cancer''' is a [[malignant|cancerous]] [[tumor|growth]] arising from the [[ovary]]. Symptoms are frequently very subtle early on and may include: bloating, [[pelvic pain]], difficulty eating and [[frequent urination]], and are easily confused with other illnesses.<ref name="wsj">{{Cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704869304575109703066893506.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Laura | last=Johannes | title=Test to Help Determine If Ovarian Masses Are Cancer | date=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

Most (more than 90%) ovarian cancers are classified as "epithelial" and are believed to arise from the surface ([[epithelium]]) of the ovary. However, some evidence suggests that the [[fallopian tube]] could also be the source of some ovarian cancers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Piek JM, van Diest PJ, Verheijen RH |title=Ovarian carcinogenesis: an alternative hypothesis |journal=Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. |volume=622 |pages=79–87 |year=2008 |pmid=18546620 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-68969-2_7 |series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |isbn=978-0-387-68966-1}}</ref> Since the ovaries and tubes are closely related to each other, it is thought that these fallopian cancer cells can mimic ovarian cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Piek, J.M.J. |date=2004-10-29 |title=Hereditary serous ovarian carcinogenesis, a hypothesis |series=Doctoral Theses — Medicine |publisher=Vrije Universiteit |location=Amsterdam |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1871/9013 }}</ref>  Other types may arise from the [[Ovum|egg cells]] ([[germ cell tumor]]) or supporting cells. Ovarian cancers are included in the category [[gynecologic cancer]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer are frequently absent early on and when they exist they may be subtle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goff|first=BA|coauthors=Mandel, L; Muntz, HG; Melancon, CH|title=Ovarian carcinoma diagnosis.|journal=Cancer|date=2000 Nov 15|volume=89|issue=10|pages=2068–75|pmid=11066047}}</ref> In most cases, the symptoms persist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed. Most typical symptoms include: [[bloating]], abdominal or pelvic pain, difficulty eating, and possibly urinary symptoms.<ref name=Goff2012>{{Cite journal|last=Goff|first=BA|title=Ovarian cancer: screening and early detection.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America|date=2012 Jun|volume=39|issue=2|pages=183–94|pmid=22640710|doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2012.02.007}}</ref> If these symptoms recently started and occur more than 12 times per month the diagnosis should be considered.<ref name=Goff2012/>

Other findings include an abdominal mass, [[back pain]], [[constipation]], [[tiredness]] and a range of other [[non-specific symptom]]s, as well as more specific symptoms such as abnormal [[vaginal bleeding]] or involuntary [[weight loss]].<ref name=pmid15957984>{{cite journal |author=Bankhead CR, Kehoe ST, Austoker J |title=Symptoms associated with diagnosis of ovarian cancer: a systematic review |journal=BJOG |volume=112 |issue=7 |pages=857–65 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15957984 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00572.x}}</ref> There can be a build-up of fluid ([[ascites]]) in the abdominal cavity. 

Ovarian cancer is associated with age, family history of ovarian cancer (9.8-fold higher risk), anaemia (2.3-fold higher), abdominal pain (sevenfold higher), abdominal distension (23-fold higher), rectal bleeding (twofold higher), postmenopausal bleeding (6.6-fold higher), appetite loss (5.2-fold higher), and weight loss (twofold higher).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hippisley-Cox|first=J|coauthors=Coupland, C|title=Identifying women with suspected ovarian cancer in primary care: derivation and validation of algorithm.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2011 Jan 4|volume=344|pages=d8009|pmid=22217630|pmc=3251328}}</ref>

==Cause==
In most cases, the exact cause of ovarian cancer remains unknown. The risk of developing ovarian cancer appears to be affected by several factors:<ref>http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/OvarianCancer/OverviewGuide/ovarian-cancer-overview-what-causes</ref>  
<li>Older women who have never given birth, and those who have a first or second degree relative with the disease, have an increased risk. 
<li>Hereditary forms of ovarian cancer can be caused by [[mutations]] in specific [[genes]] (most notably ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'', but also in genes for [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]]). 
<li>[[Infertility|Infertile]] women and those with a condition called [[endometriosis]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Celeste Leigh|coauthors=et al.|title=Association between endometriosis and risk of histological subtypes of ovarian cancer: a pooled analysis of case—control studies|journal=The Lancet Oncology|year=2012|month=April|volume=13|issue=4|pages=385–394|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(11)70404-1|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(11)70404-1/abstract|accessdate=Oct. 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://hcp.obgyn.net/endometriosis/content/article/1760982/2066478   Article by Prof. Farr Nezhat, MD, FACOG, FACS, University of Columbia, May 1, 2012]</ref>  and those who use [[postmenopausal]] [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|estrogen replacement therapy]] are at increased risk. 

===Hormones===
[[Combined oral contraceptive pill]]s are a protective factor.<ref name="pmid18061864">{{cite journal |author=Vo C, Carney ME |title=Ovarian cancer hormonal and environmental risk effect |journal=Obstet.

The relationship between use of oral contraceptives and ovarian cancer was shown in a summary of results of 45 case-control and prospective studies. Cumulatively these studies show a protective effect for ovarian cancers. Women who used oral contraceptives for 10 years had about a 60% reduction in risk of ovarian cancer. (risk ratio .42 with statistical significant confidence intervals given the large study size, not unexpected). This means that if 250 women took oral contraceptives for 10 years, 1 ovarian cancer would be prevented. This is by far the largest epidemiological study to date on this subject (45 studies, over 20,000 women with ovarian cancer and about 80,000 controls).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer, Beral V, Doll R, Hermon C, Peto R, Reeves G |title=Ovarian cancer and oral contraceptives: collaborative reanalysis of data from 45 epidemiological studies including 23,257 women with ovarian cancer and 87,303 controls |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9609 |pages=303–14 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18294997 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60167-1 }}</ref>

The ovaries contain eggs and secrete the hormones that control the reproductive cycle. Removing the ovaries and the fallopian tubes greatly reduces the amount of the hormones estrogen and progesterone circulating in the body. This can halt or slow breast and ovarian cancers that need these hormones to grow.<ref name="Mayo">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cancer/</ref>

The link to the use of [[fertility medication]], such as [[Clomiphene citrate]], has been controversial. An analysis in 1991 raised the possibility that use of drugs may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Several [[cohort study|cohort]] studies and [[case-control]] studies have been conducted since then without demonstrating conclusive evidence for such a link.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brinton, L.A., Moghissi, K.S., Scoccia, B., Westhoff, C.L., Lamb, E.J. |title=Ovulation induction and cancer risk |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=261–74; quiz 525–6 |year=2005 |pmid=15705362 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.09.016}}</ref> It will remain a complex topic to study as the infertile population differs in [[parity (medicine)|parity]] from the "normal" population.

===Genetics===
{{Further|Hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome}}
[[File:PedigreechartC.png|right|thumb|Ovarian and breast cancer patients in a pedigree chart of a family]]
There is good evidence that in some women genetic factors are important. Carriers of certain [[BRCA mutation]]s are notably at risk. The ''[[BRCA1]]'' and ''[[BRCA2]]'' genes account for 5%–13% of ovarian cancers<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lakhani SR |title=Pathology of ovarian cancers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers |journal=Clin. Cancer Res. |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=2473–81 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15073127 |url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15073127 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-1029-3 |author-separator=, |author2=Manek S |author3=Penault-Llorca F |display-authors=3 |last4=Flanagan |first4=A |last5=Arnout |first5=L |last6=Merrett |first6=S |last7=McGuffog |first7=L |last8=Steele |first8=D |last9=Devilee |first9=P}}</ref> and certain populations (e.g. [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish women) are at a higher risk of both [[breast cancer]] and ovarian cancer, often at an earlier age than the general population.<ref>Northwestern Memorial Hospital: Ovarian cancer risk for ashkenazi women</ref>  Patients with a personal history of breast cancer or a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, especially if diagnosed at a young age, may have an elevated risk, and should be tested for the "cancer gene".

In the United States, 10 to 20 percent of women with ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree relative with either breast or ovarian cancer. Mutations in either of two major susceptibility genes, breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2), confer a lifetime risk of breast cancer of between 60 and 85 percent and a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of between 15 and 40 percent. However, mutations in these genes account for only 2 to 3 percent of all breast cancers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wooster R, Weber BL |title=Breast and Ovarian Cancer |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=348 |issue=23 |pages=2339–47 |date=June 5, 2003 |pmid=12788999 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/348/23/2339 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra012284}}</ref>

A strong family history of [[uterine cancer]], [[colon cancer]], or other [[gastrointestinal cancer]]s may indicate the presence of a syndrome known as [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]] (HNPCC, also known as [[Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer|Lynch syndrome]]), which confers a higher risk for developing ovarian cancer. Patients with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the use of [[prophylactic]], i.e. preventative, [[oophorectomy]] the surgical removal of both ovaries, after completion of childbearing years. Prophylactic oophorectomy significantly reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer and ovarian cancer if you're at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of fallopian tube cancer.<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-cancer/WO00095</ref>

[[Hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome]]s (HBOC) produce higher than normal levels of [[breast cancer]] and ovarian cancer in genetically related [[families]] (either one individual suffered from both, or several individuals in the families suffered from one or the other disease). The hereditary factors may be proven or suspected to cause the pattern of breast and ovarian cancer occurrences in the family.

Alcohol consumption does not appear to be related to ovarian cancer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hjartåker|first=A|coauthors=Meo, MS, Weiderpass, E|title=Alcohol and gynecological cancers: an overview|journal= European Journal of Cancer Prevention|date=2010 Jan|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–10|pmid=19926999|doi=10.1097/CEJ.0b013e328333fb3a}}</ref>

A Swedish study, which followed more than 61,000 women for 13 years, has found a significant link between milk consumption and ovarian cancer.

===Risk factors===
Women who have had children are less likely to develop ovarian cancer than women who have not, and breastfeeding may also reduce the risk of certain types of ovarian cancer. [[Tubal ligation]] and [[hysterectomy]] reduce the risk and removal of both tubes and ovaries (bilateral [[salpingo-oophorectomy]]) dramatically reduces the risk of not only ovarian cancer but breast cancer also.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Finch A |title=Salpingo-oophorectomy and the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutation |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=2 |pages=185–92 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16835424 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.2.185 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16835424 |author-separator=, |author2=Beiner M |author3=Lubinski J |display-authors=3 |last4=Lynch |first4=HT |last5=Moller |first5=P |last6=Rosen |first6=B |last7=Murphy |first7=J |last8=Ghadirian |first8=P |last9=Friedman |first9=E}}

==Pathophysiology==
A long-standing hypothesis that has considerable support via animal model studies is the incessant ovulation hypothesis. According to this, "repeated cycles of ovulation-induced trauma and repair of the OSE [ovarian surface epithelium] at the site of ovulation, without pregnancy-induced rest periods, contributes to ovarian cancer development."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ho, Shuk-Mei |title=Estrogen, Progesterone and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |journal=Reprod Biol Endocrinol |volume=1 |pages=73|year=2003 |month=October |pmc=239900 |pmid=14577831 |doi=10.1186/1477-7827-1-73}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:POvarianCA.png|thumb|A very large ovarian cancer as seen on CT]]
[[File:Serous carcinoma cytology.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of [[serous carcinoma]], a type of ovarian cancer, diagnosed in [[peritoneal fluid]].]]
Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a [[pelvic examination]]), a blood test (for [[CA-125]] and sometimes other markers), and [[transvaginal ultrasound]]. The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the [[abdominal cavity]], take [[biopsies]] (tissue samples for [[histopathology|microscopic analysis]]) and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid.

Ovarian cancer at its early stages(I/II) is difficult to diagnose until it spreads and advances to later stages (III/IV). This is because most symptoms are non-specific and thus of little use in diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rossing, Mary Anne |author2=Wicklund, Kristine G. |author3=Cushing-Haugen, Kara L. |author4=Weiss, Noel S. |date=2010-01-28 |title=Predictive Value of Symptoms for Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst. |pages=222–9 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djp500 |url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/djp500v1 |volume=102 |pmid=20110551 |issue=4 |pmc=2826180 }}</ref> The serum [[BHCG]] level should be measured in any female in whom pregnancy is a possibility. In addition, serum [[alpha-fetoprotein]] (AFP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be measured in young girls and adolescents with suspected ovarian tumors because the younger the patient, the greater the likelihood of a malignant germ cell tumor. 

When an ovarian malignancy is included in the list of diagnostic possibilities, a limited number of laboratory tests are indicated. A complete blood count (CBC) and serum electrolyte test should be obtained in all patients. A blood test called [[CA-125]] is useful in differential diagnosis and in follow up of the disease, but it by itself has not been shown to be an effective method to screen for early-stage ovarian cancer due to its unacceptable low sensitivity and specificity. Another tests used is OVA1.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=RW|coauthors=Ueland, FR|title=Risk of malignancy in sonographically confirmed ovarian tumors.|journal=Clinical obstetrics and gynecology|date=2012 Mar|volume=55|issue=1|pages=52-64|pmid=22343229}}</ref>

Current research is looking at ways to combine tumor markers [[proteomics]] along with other indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve accuracy. The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results (i.e. performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intra-operatively). However, the contributions of [[proteomics]] are still in the early stages and require further refining. Current studies on proteomics mark the beginning of a paradigm shift towards individually tailored therapy.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Dunn, J. D. (Ed.)| title=Associated Title(s): PROTEOMICS – Clinical Applications|publisher=Online ISSN: 1615-9861|issue=15| year=|doi=|volume=11|url= }}</ref>
 
A pelvic examination and imaging including CT scan<ref name="urlcomputed tomography—Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computed+tomography |title=computed tomography—Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |work= |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> and trans-vaginal ultrasound are essential. Physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or [[ascites]] (fluid within the abdominal cavity). Pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. The pelvic examination can include a [[Rectovaginal]] component for better palpation of the ovaries. For very young patients, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] may be preferred to rectal and vaginal examination.

To definitively diagnose ovarian cancer, a surgical procedure to take a look into the abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure ([[laparotomy]], incision through the [[abdominal wall]]) or [[keyhole surgery]] ([[laparoscopy]]). During this procedure, suspicious areas will be removed and sent for [[Histopathology|microscopic analysis]]. Fluid from the [[abdominal cavity]] can also be analysed for cancerous [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. If there is cancer, this procedure can also determine its spread (which is a form of [[tumor staging]]).

===Classification===
[[File:Ovarian carcinoma.JPG|thumb|A pathological specimen of ovarian carcinoma.]]
[[File:Mature cystic teratoma of ovary.jpg|right|thumb|A benign tumor of the ovary, discovered during a [[Caesarean section|C-section]]; this is a 4 cm [[teratoma]]]]

Ovarian cancer is classified according to the [[histology]] of the tumor, obtained in a [[pathology]] report. Histology dictates many aspects of clinical treatment, management, and [[prognosis]].

*[[Surface epithelial-stromal tumour]], also known as ovarian epithelial carcinoma, is the most common type of ovarian cancer. It includes [[serous tumour]], [[endometrioid tumor]], and [[mucinous]] [[cystadenocarcinoma]]. Less common tumors are malignant [[Brenner tumor]] and [[transitional cell carcinoma of the ovary]].
*[[Sex cord-stromal tumour|Sex cord-stromal tumor]], including [[estrogen]]-producing [[granulosa cell tumor]] and virilizing [[Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor]] or [[arrhenoblastoma]], accounts for 8% of ovarian cancers.
*[[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for approximately 30% of ovarian tumors but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign. Germ cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20's-30's) and girls. Whilst overall the prognosis of germ cell tumors tend to be favourable, it can vary substantially with specific histology: for instance, the prognosis of the most common germ cell tumor ([[dysgerminomas]]) tends to be good, whilst the second most common ([[endodermal sinus tumor]]) tends to have a poor prognosis. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]]; dysgerminomas with [[Lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]]; and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].
* Mixed tumors, containing elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology.

Ovarian cancer can also be a '''secondary cancer''', the result of [[metastasis]] from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body. 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases while the rest are primary cancers. Common primary cancers are [[breast cancer]] and [[gastrointestinal cancer]]. (A common mistake is to name all peritoneal metastases from any gastrointestinal cancer as a [[Krukenberg cancer|Krukenberg tumor]],<ref>http://www.MedicineNet.com: Search "Krukenberg tumor"</ref> but this is only the case if it originates from primary gastric cancer). Surface epithelial-stromal tumor can originate in the [[peritoneum]] (the lining of the abdominal cavity), in which case the ovarian cancer is secondary to [[primary peritoneal cancer]], but treatment is basically the same as for primary surface epithelial-stromal tumor involving the peritoneum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bridda A, Padoan I, Mencarelli R, Frego M |title=Peritoneal mesothelioma: a review |journal=MedGenMed |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=32 |year=2007 |pmid=17955087 |pmc=1994863 }}</ref>

Ovarian cancer is bilateral in 25% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Micci F, Haugom L, Ahlquist T, ''et al.'' |title=Tumor spreading to the contralateral ovary in bilateral ovarian carcinoma is a late event in clonal evolution |journal=J Oncol |volume=2010 |issue= |pages=646340 |year=2010 |pmid=19759843 |pmc=2744120 |doi=10.1155/2010/646340 |url=}}</ref>

===Staging===
Ovarian cancer staging is by the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total abdominal [[hysterectomy]], removal of (usually) both ovaries and fallopian tubes, (usually) the omentum, and [[pelvic washing|pelvic (peritoneal) washing]]s for cytopathology. The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage.
The AJCC staging system describes the extent of the primary Tumor (T), the absence or presence of [[metastasis]] to nearby [[lymph Nodes]] (N), and the absence or presence of distant Metastasis (M).<ref name="A">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/ovariancancer/detailedguide/ovarian-cancer-staging |title=How is ovarian cancer staged? |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref> 
*Stage I — limited to one or both ovaries
**IA — involves one ovary; capsule intact; no tumor on ovarian surface; no malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal washings
**IB — involves both ovaries; capsule intact; no tumor on ovarian surface; negative washings
**IC — tumor limited to ovaries with any of the following: capsule ruptured, tumor on ovarian surface, positive washings
*Stage II — pelvic extension or implants
**IIA — extension or implants onto uterus or fallopian tube; negative washings
**IIB — extension or implants onto other pelvic structures; negative washings
**IIC — pelvic extension or implants with positive peritoneal washings
[[File:Tumor deposet.JPG|thumb|Ovarian adenocarcinoma deposit in the mesentry of the small bowel]]
*Stage III — peritoneal implants outside of the pelvis; or limited to the pelvis with extension to the small bowel or omentum
**IIIA — microscopic peritoneal metastases beyond pelvis
**IIIB — macroscopic peritoneal metastases beyond pelvis less than 2&nbsp;cm in size
**IIIC — peritoneal metastases beyond pelvis > 2&nbsp;cm or lymph node metastases
*Stage IV — distant metastases to the liver or outside the peritoneal cavity

Para-aortic lymph node metastases are considered regional lymph nodes (Stage IIIC). As there is only one para-aortic lymph node intervening before the thoracic duct on the right side of the body, the ovarian cancer can rapidly spread to distant sites such as the lung.

The AJCC/TNM staging system includes three categories for ovarian cancer, T, N and M. The T category contains three other subcategories, T1, T2 and T3, each of them being classified according to the place where the tumor has developed (in one or both ovaries, inside or outside the ovary). The T1 category of ovarian cancer describes ovarian tumors that are confined to the ovaries, and which may affect one or both of them. The sub-subcategory T1a is used to stage cancer that is found in only one ovary, which has left the capsule intact and which cannot be found in the [[fluid]] taken from the [[pelvis]]. Cancer that has not affected the capsule, is confined to the inside of the ovaries and cannot be found in the fluid taken from the pelvis but has affected both ovaries is staged as T1b. T1c category describes a type of tumor that can affect one or both ovaries, and which has grown through the capsule of an ovary or it is present in the fluid taken from the pelvis. T2 is a more advanced stage of cancer. In this case, the tumor has grown in one or both ovaries and is spread to the [[uterus]], [[fallopian tubes]] or other pelvic tissues. Stage T2a is used to describe a cancerous tumor that has spread to the uterus or the fallopian tubes (or both) but which is not present in the fluid taken from the pelvis. Stages T2b and T2c indicate cancer that metastasized to other pelvic tissues than the uterus and fallopian tubes and which cannot be seen in the fluid taken from the pelvis, respectively tumors that spread to any of the pelvic tissues (including uterus and fallopian tubes) but which can also be found in the fluid taken from the pelvis. T3 is the stage used to describe cancer that has spread to the [[peritoneum]]. This stage provides information on the size of the metastatic tumors (tumors that are located in other areas of the body, but are caused by ovarian cancer). These tumors can be very small, visible only under the [[microscope]] (T3a), visible but not larger than 2 centimeters (T3b) and bigger than 2 centimeters (T3c).

This staging system also uses N categories to describe cancers that have or not spread to nearby lymph nodes. There are only two N categories, N0 which indicates that the cancerous tumors have not affected the lymph nodes, and N1 which indicates the involvement of lymph nodes close to the tumor.

The M categories in the AJCC/TNM staging system provide information on whether the ovarian cancer has metastasized to distant organs such as [[liver]] or [[lungs]]. M0 indicates that the cancer did not spread to distant organs and M1 category is used for cancer that has spread to other organs of the body.

The AJCC/TNM staging system also contains a Tx and a Nx sub-category which indicates that the extent of the tumor cannot be described because of insufficient data, respectively the involvement of the lymph nodes cannot be described because of the same reason.

The ovarian cancer stages are made up by combining the TNM categories in the following manner:
*Stage I: T1+N0+M0
**IA: T1a+N0+M0
**IB: T1b+N0+M0
**IC: T1c+N0+M0
*Stage II: T2+N0+M0
**IIa: T2a+N0+M0
**IIB: T2b+N0+M0
**IIC: T2c+N0+M0
*Stage III: T3+ N0+M0
**IIIA: T3a+ N0+M0
**IIIB: T3b+ N0+M0
**IIIC: T3c+ N0+M0 or Any T+N1+M0
*Stage IV: Any T+ Any N+M1

Ovarian cancer, as well as any other type of cancer, is also graded, apart from staged. The histologic grade of a tumor measures how abnormal or malignant its cells look under the microscope.<ref name="B">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancerfacts.com/GeneralContent/Ovarian/gen_diagnosis.asp?CB=9 |title=Diagnosis and Staging |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref>  There are four grades indicating the likelihood of the cancer to spread and the higher the grade, the more likely for this to occur. Grade 0 is used to describe non-invasive tumors. Grade 0 cancers are also referred to as borderline tumors.<ref name="B"/> Grade 1 tumors have [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that are well differentiated (look very similar to the normal tissue) and are the ones with the best prognosis. Grade 2 tumors are also called moderately well differentiated and they are made up by cells that resemble the normal tissue. Grade 3 tumors have the worst prognosis and their cells are abnormal, referred to as poorly differentiated.

==Prevention==
[[Tubal ligation]] appears to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry the [[BRCA1]] (but not [[BRCA2]]) gene.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pruthi|first=S|coauthors=Gostout, BS; Lindor, NM|title=Identification and Management of Women With BRCA Mutations or Hereditary Predisposition for Breast and Ovarian Cancer.|journal=Mayo Clinic proceedings.

===Screening===
Routine screening of women for ovarian cancer is not recommended by any professional society — this includes the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.<ref name=Clarke-Pearson>{{cite journal |author=Clarke-Pearson DL |title=Clinical practice. Screening for ovarian cancer |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=361 |issue=2 |pages=170–7 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19587342|doi=10.1056/NEJMcp0901926 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/2/170}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moyer|first=VA|coauthors=on behalf of the U.S. Preventive Services Task, Force|title=Screening for Ovarian Cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Reaffirmation Recommendation Statement.|journal=Annals of internal medicine|date=2012 Sep 11|pmid=22964825|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-157-11-201212040-00539}}</ref> This is because no trial has shown improved survival for women undergoing screening.<ref name=Clarke-Pearson/> Screening for any type of cancer must be accurate and reliable — it needs to accurately detect the disease and it must not give false positive results in people who do not have cancer. As yet there is no technique for ovarian screening that has been shown to fulfil these criteria. However, in some countries such as the UK, women who are likely to have an increased risk of ovarian cancer (for example if they have a family history of the disease) can be offered individual screening through their doctors, although this will not necessarily detect the disease at an early stage.

The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully. However, the development of the disease is not fully understood, and it has been argued that early-stage cancers may not always develop into late-stage disease.<ref name=Clarke-Pearson/> With any screening technique there are risks and benefits that need to be carefully considered, and health authorities need to assess these before introducing any ovarian cancer screening programmes.

==Management==
Treatment usually involves [[chemotherapy]] and surgery, and sometimes [[radiotherapy]].<ref name=pmid18381114>{{cite journal |author=Chobanian N, Dietrich CS |title=Ovarian cancer |journal=Surg. Clin. North Am. |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=285–99, vi |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18381114 |doi=10.1016/j.suc.2007.12.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039-6109(07)00180-6}}</ref>

===Surgery===
Surgical treatment may be sufficient for malignant tumors that are well-differentiated and confined to the ovary. Addition of chemotherapy may be required for more aggressive tumors that are confined to the ovary. For patients with advanced disease a combination of surgical reduction with a combination chemotherapy regimen is standard. Borderline tumors, even following spread outside of the ovary, are managed well with surgery, and chemotherapy is not seen as useful.

[[Surgery]] is the preferred treatment and is frequently necessary to obtain a tissue specimen for differential [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] via its [[histology]]. Surgery performed by a specialist in [[gynecologic oncology]] usually results in an improved result.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.1999.tb08137.x |author=Junor EJ, Hole DJ, McNulty L, Mason M, Young J |title=Specialist gynaecologists and survival outcome in ovarian cancer: a Scottish national study of 1866 patients |journal=Br J Obstet Gynaecol |volume=106 |issue=11 |pages=1130–6 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10549956 }}
</ref> Improved survival is attributed to more accurate staging of the disease and a higher rate of aggressive surgical excision of tumor in the abdomen by gynecologic oncologists as opposed to general gynecologists and general surgeons. 

The type of surgery depends upon how widespread the cancer is when diagnosed (the cancer stage), as well as the presumed type and grade of cancer. The surgeon may remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy), the fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), and the uterus (hysterectomy). For some very early tumors (stage 1, low grade or low-risk disease), only the involved ovary and fallopian tube will be removed (called a "unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy," USO), especially in young females who wish to preserve their fertility. 

In advanced [[malignancy]], where complete resection is not feasible, as much tumor as possible is removed (debulking surgery). In cases where this type of surgery is successful (i.e. < 1&nbsp;cm in diameter of tumor is left behind ["optimal debulking"]), the prognosis is improved compared to patients where large tumor masses (> 1&nbsp;cm in diameter) are left behind.  [[Minimally invasive]] surgical techniques may facilitate the safe removal of very large (greater than 10&nbsp;cm) tumors with fewer complications of surgery.<ref>{{cite journal

===Chemotherapy===
[[Chemotherapy]] has been a general [[standard of care]] for ovarian cancer for decades, although with highly variable protocols.<ref name="pmid14661040">{{cite journal

}}</ref>
Chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease, if appropriate. This depends on the [[histology]] of the tumor; some kinds of tumor (particularly [[teratoma]]) are not sensitive to chemotherapy. In some cases, there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first, followed by surgery.  

====Intraperitoneal chemotherapy====
For patients with stage IIIC epithelial ovarian adenocarcinomas who have undergone successful optimal debulking, a recent clinical trial demonstrated that median survival time is significantly longer for patient receiving '''intraperitoneal''' (IP) chemotherapy.<ref name="pmid16394300">{{cite journal

Patients in this clinical trial reported less compliance with IP chemotherapy and fewer than half of the patients received all six cycles of IP chemotherapy. Despite this high "drop-out" rate, the group as a whole (including the patients that didn't complete IP chemotherapy treatment) survived longer on average than patients who received intravenous chemotherapy alone.

Some specialists believe the toxicities and other complications of IP chemotherapy will be unnecessary with improved IV chemotherapy drugs currently being developed.

Although IP chemotherapy has been recommended as a [[standard of care]] for the first-line treatment of ovarian cancer, the basis for this recommendation has been challenged, and it has not yet become standard treatment for stage III or IV ovarian cancer.<ref name="pmid18006894">{{cite journal

===Radiation therapy===
[[Radiation therapy]] is not effective for advanced stages because when vital organs are in the radiation field, a high dose cannot be safely delivered. Radiation therapy is then commonly avoided in such stages as the vital organs may not be able to withstand the problems associated with these ovarian cancer treatments.<ref name="E">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ovariancancersymptoms.us/treatment.php |title=Ovarian Cancer Treatments Available |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
[[File:Relative survival of ovarian cancer by stage.png|thumb|300px|Relative [[5-year survival]] of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer by stage.<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/OvarianCancer/OverviewGuide/ovarian-cancer-overview-survival-rates Survival rates for ovarian cancer] from Cancer.org — American Cancer Society. Last Medical Review: 10/18/2010. Last Revised: 06/27/2011.</ref>]]
Ovarian cancer usually has a relatively poor [[prognosis]]. It is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test, meaning that most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages. More than 60% of women presenting with this cancer have stage III or stage IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, included the [[uterus]], [[urinary bladder]], [[bowel]] and the lining of the bowel wall [[Greater omentum|omentum]] forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.

The [[five-year survival]] rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 47%.<ref name="wsj" /> For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%.<ref name=SEER>Survival rates based on SEER incidence and NCHS mortality statistics, as cited by the National Cancer Institute in [http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets — Cancer of the Ovary]</ref>

Ovarian cancer is the second most common [[gynecologic cancer]] and the deadliest in terms of absolute number.<ref name="merck"/> It caused nearly 14,000 deaths in the [[United States]] alone in 2010. While the overall five-year survival rate for all cancers combined has improved significantly: 68% for the general population diagnosed in 2001 (compared to 50% in the 1970s),<ref name="wsj"/> ovarian cancer has a poorer outcome with a 47% survival rate (compared to 38% in the late 1970s).<ref name="wsj"/>

===Complications===
* Spread of the cancer to other organs
* Progressive function loss of various organs
* [[Ascites]] (fluid in the abdomen)
* Intestinal obstructions

These cells can implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, urinary bladder, bowel, lining of the bowel wall (omentum) and, less frequently, to the lungs.

The disease is more common in industrialized nations, with the exception of [[Japan]]. In the [[United States]], females have a 1.4% to 2.5% (1 out of 40-60 women) lifetime chance of developing ovarian cancer. Older women are at highest risk.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Ovarian cancer symptoms, early warning signs, and risk factors|journal=MedicineNet.com|url=http://www.genetichealth.com|author=Stöppler, Melissa Conrad; Lee, Dennis; Shiel, William C.

In 2010, in the United States, it is estimated that 21,880 new cases were diagnosed and 13,850 women died of ovarian cancer. The risk increases with age and decreases with numbers of pregnancy. Lifetime risk is about 1.6%, but women with affected first-degree relatives have a 5% risk. Women with a mutated [[BRCA1]] or [[BRCA2]] gene carry a risk between 25% and 60% depending on the specific mutation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert C.

===New screening methods===
Researchers are assessing different ways to screen for ovarian cancer. Screening tests that could potentially be used alone or in combination for routine screening include the [[CA-125]] marker and [[transvaginal ultrasound]]. Doctors can measure the levels of the CA-125 protein in a woman’s blood —high levels could be a sign of ovarian cancer, but this is not always the case. And not all women with ovarian cancer have high CA-125 levels. Transvaginal ultrasound involves using an ultrasound probe to scan the ovaries from inside the vagina, giving a clearer image than scanning the abdomen. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Several large studies are ongoing, but none have identified an effective technique.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Partridge E |title=Results from four rounds of ovarian cancer screening in a randomized trial |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=775–82|year=2009 |month=April |pmid= 19305319|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31819cda77|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0029-7844&volume=113&issue=4&spage=775 |pmc=2728067 |doi_brokendate=2010-03-17 |author-separator=,|author2=Kreimer AR |author3=Greenlee RT |display-authors=3 |last4=Williams |first4=C |last5=Xu |first5=JL|last6=Church |first6=TR |last7=Kessel |first7=B |last8=Johnson |first8=CC |last9=Weissfeld|first9=JL}}</ref> In 2009, however, early results from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) showed that a technique combining annual CA-125 tests with ultrasound imaging did help to detect the disease at an early stage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Menon U |title=Sensitivity and specificity of multimodal and ultrasound screening for ovarian cancer, and stage distribution of detected cancers: results of the prevalence screen of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=327–40 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19282241|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70026-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470-2045(09)70026-9|laysummary=[http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2009/03/12/early-results-from-ovarian-cancer-screening-trial-look-promising/Early results from ovarian cancer screening trial look promising] |laysource=Cancer Research UK, Science Update blog |laydate=March 2009 |author-separator=, |author2=Gentry-Maharaj A |author3=Hallett R|display-authors=3 |last4=Ryan |first4=Andy |last5=Burnell |first5=Matthew |last6=Sharma |first6=Aarti|last7=Lewis |first7=Sara |last8=Davies |first8=Susan |last9=Philpott |first9=Susan}}</ref> However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives — the full results of the trial will be published in 2015.
