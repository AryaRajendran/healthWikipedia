The '''Tanner scale''' (also known as the '''Tanner stages''') is a scale of [[Child development|physical development in children]], [[adolescent]]s and [[adult]]s. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external [[primary sex characteristic|primary]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, such as the size of the [[breast]]s, [[genitalia]], testicular volume and development of [[Pubic hair|pubic]] and [[Underarm hair|axillary hair]]. This scale was first identified by [[James Mourilyan Tanner|James Tanner]], a British pediatrician and thus bears his name.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3082}}</ref><ref name="pmid5440182">{{cite journal |author=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in the pattern of pubertal changes in boys|journal=Arch.

Due to [[Human variability|natural variation]], individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of [[puberty]]. In [[HIV]] treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which treatment regimen to follow (adult, adolescent, or pediatric).

===Genitals (male)===
[[File:Tanner scale-male.svg|166px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for males.]]
; Tanner I : prepubertal ([[Testicle|testicular]] volume less than 1.5 [[liter|ml]]; small penis of 3&nbsp;cm or less) [typically age 9 and younger]
; Tanner II : testicular volume between 1.6 and 6 ml; skin on scrotum thins, reddens and enlarges; penis length unchanged [9-11]
; Tanner III : testicular volume between 6 and 12 ml; scrotum enlarges further; penis begins to lengthen to about 6&nbsp;cm [11-12.5]
; Tanner IV : testicular volume between 12 and 20 ml; scrotum enlarges further and darkens; penis increases in length to 10&nbsp;cm and circumference [12.5-14]
; Tanner V : testicular volume greater than 20 ml; adult scrotum and penis of 15&nbsp;cm in length [14+]

===Breasts (female)===
[[File:Tanner scale-female.svg|240px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for females.]]
; Tanner  I : no glandular tissue: [[areola]] follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal) [typically age 10 and younger]
; Tanner II : [[Thelarche|breast bud]] forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue; areola begins to widen [10-11.5]
; Tanner III : breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast [11.5-13]
; Tanner IV : increased breast size and elevation; areola and [[nipple|papilla]] form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast [13-15]
; Tanner V : breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla. [15+]

===Pubic hair (both male and female)===

; Tanner I : no pubic hair at all ([[Puberty|prepubertal]] Dominic state) [typically age 10 and younger]
; Tanner II : small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the [[penis]] and [[scrotum]] (males) or on the [[labia majora]] (females) [10–11.5]
; Tanner III : hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally [11.5–13]
; Tanner IV : adult-like hair quality, extending across [[pubis]]{{dn|date=April 2013}} but sparing medial thighs [13–15]
; Tanner V : hair extends to medial surface of the thighs [15+]

==Criticism==
The scale has been criticized by the pornography industry for its potential to lead to false [[child pornography]] convictions, such as in the case when government experts used it to assert that pornographic actress [[Lupe Fuentes]] was underage. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/37817.html |title=Lupe Fuentes Saves Man From Bogus ‘Child Porn’ Charge|date=April 16, 2010|work=AVN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Adult Film Star Verifies Her Age, Saves Fan From 20 Years In Prison|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/04/adult-film-star-verifies-her-age-saves-fan-20-years-prison |work=Radar Online|date=April 21, 2010}}</ref> The author of the classification system himself has argued that age classification utilizing the Tanner stages represents invalid use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age but rather maturity stages and thus are non-diagnostic for age estimation.<ref>Rosenbloom AL, Tanner, JM (1998).
