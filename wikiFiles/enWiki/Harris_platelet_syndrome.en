'''Harris platelet syndrome''' (HPS) is the most common inherited [[giant platelet disorder]].<ref name="pmid12079722">{{cite journal |author=Naina HV, Nair SC, Daniel D, George B, Chandy M |title=Asymptomatic constitutional macrothrombocytopenia among West Bengal blood donors |journal=Am.

==Terminology==
In 2002, this syndrome was called "asymptomatic constitutional macro thrombocytopenia" (ACMT).<ref name="pmid12079722"/>

In 2005, to avoid confusion between ACMT and [[congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia]] (CAMT) this entity was referred as '''Harris platelet syndrome'''.<ref name="pmid16241959"/>

==Presentation==
HPS was identified among healthy blood donors in the north-eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, characterized by absent bleeding symptoms, mild to severe [[thrombocytopenia]] (platelets rarely <50 X 109/L)with giant platelets (Mean platelet volume 10fL) and normal platelet aggregation studies with absent [[MYH9]] mutation.<ref name="pmid12079722"/><ref name="pmid16241959"/>

In the blood donors with HPS authors found a statistically higher MPV, RDW and a lower platelet count and platelet biomass.<ref name="pmid20201635">{{cite journal |author=Naina HV, Harris S |title=Platelet and red blood cell indices in Harris platelet syndrome |journal=Platelets |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=303–6 |year=2010 |pmid=20201635 |doi=10.3109/09537101003615402 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09537101003615402}}</ref>

At present the diagnosis of HPS is made by ascertaining the ethnicity of the patient, as well as assessing for conditions causing acquired thrombocytopenias, and after also excluding the known inherited giant platelet disorders(IGPD) and other congenital thrombocytopenias. Unfortunately few patients with IGPD are treated inappropriately with corticosteroids, immunoglobulin infusions and even [[splenectomy]].<ref name="pmid16916536">{{cite journal |author=Gohda F, Uchiumi H, Handa H, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of inherited macrothrombocytopenias based on mean platelet volume among patients diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenia |journal=Thromb.

It is extremely important to recognize Harris platelet syndrome, as one third the population of certain parts of Indian subcontinent is affected.<ref name="pmid18834201">{{cite journal |author=Naina HV, Harris S |title=Harris platelet syndrome--underdiagnosed and unrecognized |journal=Arch.
