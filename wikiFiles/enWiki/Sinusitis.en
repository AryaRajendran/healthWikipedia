'''Sinusitis''' or '''rhinosinusitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[paranasal sinuses]]. It can be due to [[infection]], [[allergy]], or [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] issues.  Most cases are due to a viral infection and resolve over the course of 10 days.  It is a common condition, with over 24 million cases annually in the U.S.<ref name=Review2010/>

==Classification==
Sinusitis (or rhinosinusitis) is defined as an inflammation of the mucous membrane
that lines the paranasal sinuses and is classified chronologically into
several categories:<ref name="clevelandclinicmeded.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/allergy/rhino-sinusitis/ |publisher=[[Cleveland Clinic]] |author=Christine Radojicic |title=Sinusitis |work=Disease Management Project |accessdate=November 26, 2012 }}</ref>

*[[acute]] rhinosinusitis — a new infection that may last up to four weeks and can be subdivided symptomatically into severe and non-severe;
*recurrent acute rhinosinusitis — four or more separate episodes of acute sinusitis that occur within one year;
*[[subacute]] rhinosinusitis — an infection that lasts between four and 12 weeks, and represents a transition between acute and  chronic infection;
*[[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] rhinosinusitis — when the signs and symptoms last for more than 12 weeks; and
*acute exacerbation of chronic rhinosinusitis — when the signs and symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis exacerbate, but return to baseline after treatment. 
All these types of sinusitis have similar [[symptom]]s, and are thus often difficult to distinguish. Acute sinusitis is very common. Roughly ninety percent of adults have had sinusitis at some point in their life.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pearlman | first1 = AN | last2 = Conley | first2 = DB | title = Review of current guidelines related to the diagnosis and treatment of rhinosinusitis. | journal = Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–30 | month = June | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1097/MOO.0b013e3282fdcc9a | pmid = 18475076 }}</ref>

===Acute===
[[Acute (medical)|Acute]] sinusitis is usually precipitated by an earlier [[upper respiratory tract infection]], generally of [[virus|viral]] origin. If the infection is of bacterial origin, the most common three causative agents are ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]''.<ref name=Leung2008/> Until recently, ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' was the most common bacterial agent to cause sinus infections. However, introduction of the ''H. influenza'' type B (Hib) vaccine has dramatically decreased ''H. influenza'' type B infections and now non-typable ''H. influenza'' (NTHI) are predominantly seen in clinics. Other sinusitis-causing [[bacterial]] [[pathogen]]s include ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and other [[streptococci]] [[species]], [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]] and, less commonly, [[gram negative]] bacteria. Viral sinusitis typically lasts for 7 to 10 days,<ref name=Leung2008/> whereas bacterial sinusitis is more persistent. Approximately 0.5% to 2% of viral sinusitis results in subsequent bacterial sinusitis. It is thought that nasal irritation from nose blowing leads to the secondary bacterial infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gwaltney JM, Hendley JO, Phillips CD, Bass CR, Mygind N, Winther B |title=Nose blowing propels nasal fluid into the paranasal sinuses |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=387–91 |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10671347 |doi=10.1086/313661 |url=http://www.cid.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10671347}}</ref>

[[Acute (medical)|Acute]] episodes of sinusitis can also result from [[fungus|fungal]] invasion. These [[infection]]s are typically seen in [[patient]]s with [[diabetes]] or other [[immunodeficiency|immune deficiencies]] (such as [[AIDS]] or [[Organ transplant|transplant]] [[patient]]s on immunosuppressive anti-rejection medications) and can be life threatening. In type I diabetics, ketoacidosis can be associated with sinusitis due to [[mucormycosis]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|222551|Mucormycosis}}</ref> 

Chemical irritation can also trigger sinusitis, commonly from cigarette smoke and chlorine fumes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gelfand|first=Jonathan L|title=Help for Sinus Pain and Pressure|url=http://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinus-pain-pressure-9/sinus-headaches|publisher=WebMD.com|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref> Rarely, it may be caused by a tooth infection.<ref name=Leung2008/>

===Chronic===
Chronic sinusitis, by definition, lasts longer than three months and can be caused by many different diseases that share chronic inflammation of the sinuses as a common symptom. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis may include any combination of the following: [[nasal congestion]], facial pain, [[headache]], night-time coughing, an increase in previously minor or controlled asthma symptoms, general [[malaise]], thick green or yellow [[Rhinorrhea|discharge]], feeling of facial 'fullness' or 'tightness' that may worsen when bending over, dizziness, aching teeth, and/or [[halitosis]].<ref name=clevelandclinicmeded.com />{{verification needed|date=November 2012}} Each of these symptoms has multiple other possible causes, which should be considered and investigated as well. Unless complications occur, [[fever]] is not a feature of [[chronic sinusitis]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Often chronic sinusitis can lead to [[anosmia]], a reduced sense of [[olfaction|smell]].<ref name=clevelandclinicmeded.com /> In a small number of cases, acute or chronic [[maxillary sinus]]itis is associated with a dental infection. [[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]], [[lightheadedness]], and [[blurred vision]] are not typical in chronic sinusitis and other causes should be investigated.

Chronic sinusitis cases are subdivided into cases with [[nasal polyp|polyps]] and cases without polyps. When polyps are present, the condition is called chronic hyperplastic sinusitis; however, the causes are poorly understood<ref name=Leung2008>{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=RS|coauthors=Katial, R|title=The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic sinusitis.|journal=Primary care|date=2008 Mar|volume=35|issue=1|pages=11-24, v-vi|pmid=18206715}}</ref> and may include allergy, environmental factors such as dust or pollution, bacterial infection, or fungus (either allergic, infective, or reactive). Non-allergic factors, such as [[vasomotor rhinitis]], can also cause chronic sinus problems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Abnormally narrow sinus passages, such as having a [[deviated septum]], can impede drainage from the sinus cavities and be a contributing factor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 

Chronic rhinosinusitis represents a multifactorial inflammatory disorder, rather than simply a persistent bacterial infection.<ref name="Leung2008"/> The medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis is now focused upon controlling the inflammation that predisposes patients to obstruction, reducing the incidence of infections. However, all forms of chronic rhinosinusitis are associated with impaired sinus drainage and secondary bacterial infections. Most individuals require initial antibiotics to clear any infection and intermittently afterwards to treat acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis. 

A combination of [[anaerobic infections|anaerobic and aerobic bacteria]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I |title=Sinusitis |journal=Periodontology 2000 |volume=49 |pages=126–39 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19152530 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0757.2008.00293.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I, Frazier EH |title=Bacteriology of chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with nasal polyposis |journal=J.

Also isolated are  ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (including methicilin resistant ''S.aureus'' )<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I, Foote PA, Hausfeld JN |title=Increase in the frequency of recovery of meticillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis |journal=J. Med. Microbiol. |volume=57 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=1015–7 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18628504 |doi=10.1099/jmm.0.2008/000851-0 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/57/8/1015}}</ref> and coagulase-negative ''[[Staphylococci]]'' and Gram negative enteric organisms can be isolated. Typically antibiotic treatment provides only a temporary reduction in inflammation, although hyperresponsiveness of the immune system to bacteria has been proposed as a possible cause of sinusitis with polyps (chronic hyperplastic sinusitis).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Attempts have been made to provide a more consistent nomenclature for subtypes of chronic sinusitis. The presence of [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]] in the mucous lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses has been demonstrated for many patients, and this has been termed [[eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis]] (EMRS). Cases of EMRS may be related to an allergic response, but allergy is not often documented, resulting in further subcategorization into allergic and non-allergic EMRS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chakrabarti A, Denning DW, Ferguson BJ, Ponikau J, Buzina W, Kita H, Marple B, Panda N, Vlaminck S, Kauffmann-Lacroix C, Das A, Singh P, Taj-Aldeen SJ, Kantarcioglu AS, Handa KK, Gupta A, Thungabathra M, Shivaprakash MR, Bal A, Fothergill A, Radotra BD |journal=Laryngoscope |date=2009 Sep |volume=119 |issue=9 |pages=1809–18 |title=Fungal rhinosinusitis: a categorization and definitional schema addressing current controversies |pmid=19544383 |pmc=2741302}}</ref>

A more recent, and still debated, development in chronic sinusitis is the role that [[fungus]] plays in this disease. Fungus can be found in the nasal cavities and sinuses of most patients with sinusitis, but can also be found in healthy people as well.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} It remains unclear if fungus is a definite factor in the development of chronic sinusitis and if it is, what the difference may be between those who develop the disease and those who remain free of symptoms. Trials of antifungal treatments have had mixed results.

===By location===
There are several paired paranasal sinuses, including the frontal, ethmoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. The [[ethmoid sinus]]es is further subdivided into anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses, the division of which is defined as the basal [[:wikt:lamella|lamella]] of the middle [[turbinate]]. In addition to the severity of [[disease]], discussed below, sinusitis can be classified by the sinus cavity which it affects:

*[[Maxillary sinus|Maxillary]] – can cause [[pain]] or pressure in the maxillary ([[cheek]]) area (''e.g.,'' [[toothache]], [[headache]]) (J01.0/J32.0)
* [[Frontal sinus|Frontal]] – can cause pain or pressure in the [[frontal sinus]] cavity (located above eyes), [[headache]] (J01.1/J32.1)
* [[Ethmoid sinus|Ethmoid]] – can cause pain or pressure pain between/behind the [[Human eye|eyes]] and [[headache]]s (J01.2/J32.2)
*[[Sphenoid sinus|Sphenoid]] – can cause pain or pressure behind the [[Human eye|eye]]s, but often refers to the [[vertex (anatomy)|vertex]], or top of the [[head]]

Recent theories of sinusitis indicate that it often occurs as part of a spectrum of [[disease]]s that affect the [[respiratory tract]] (''i.e.'', the "one airway" theory) and is often linked to [[asthma]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Grossman J | title = One airway, one disease | journal = Chest | volume = 111 | pages = 11S–16S | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1378/chest.111.2_Supplement.11S |pmid = 9042022 | issue = 2 Suppl }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Cruz AA | title = The 'united airways' require an holistic approach to management | journal = Allergy | volume = 60 |issue = 7 | pages = 871–4 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2005.00858.x | pmid = 15932375 }}</ref> All forms of sinusitis may either result in, or be a part of, a generalized [[inflammation]] of the [[airway]], so other [[airway]] [[symptom]]s, such as [[cough]], may be associated with it.

==Signs and symptoms==
Headache/facial pain or pressure of a dull, constant, or aching sort over the affected sinuses is common with both acute and chronic stages of sinusitis.  This pain is typically localized to the involved sinus and may worsen when the affected person bends over or when [[supine position|lying down]].  Pain often starts on one side of the head and progresses to both sides.<ref name="umm.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_symptoms_of_sinusitis_000062_4.htm |publisher=University of Maryland |title=Sinusitus Complications |work=Patient Education }}</ref>
Acute and chronic sinusitis may be accompanied by thick nasal discharge that is usually green in color and may contain pus (purulent) and/or blood.{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}<ref name="Sinusitis discharge1">{{cite web|last=Brook I|title=Sinusitis Understood |url=http://sinusitisunderstood.blogspot.com/p/epidemology-and-diagnosis.html }}{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}</ref><ref name="Sinusitis discharge2">{{cite web|title=Sinusitis|url=http://www.herbs2000.com/disorders/sinusitis.htm|publisher=herb2000.com|quote=Incidence of acute sinusitis almost always set in following the appearance of a cold for several days at a stretch in the person to the point that all the profuse nasal discharge turns a distinct yellow or a dark green color, or perhaps very thick, and foul-smelling in some cases.}}{{MEDRS|date=April 2012}}</ref> Often a localized headache or [[toothache]] is present, and it is these symptoms that distinguish a sinus-related headache from other types of headaches, such as tension and migraine headaches. Infection of the eye socket is possible, which may result in the loss of sight and is accompanied by fever and severe illness.  Another possible complication is the infection of the bones ([[osteomyelitis]]) of the forehead and other facial bones – [[Pott's puffy tumor]].<ref name="umm.edu"/>

Sinus infections can also cause inner ear problems due to the congestion of the nasal passages. This can be demonstrated by dizziness, "a pressurized or heavy head", or vibrating sensations in the head. Other symptoms of sinusitis include [[Halitosis|bad breath]] and [[Post-nasal drip]].

Recent studies suggest that up to 90% of "sinus headaches" are actually [[migraines]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schreiber C, Hutchinson S, Webster C, Ames M, Richardson M, Powers C |title=Prevalence of migraine in patients with a history of self-reported or physician-diagnosed "sinus" headache |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=164 |issue=16 |pages=1769–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15364670 |doi=10.1001/archinte.164.16.1769}}</ref><ref name="pmid16213917">{{cite journal |author=Mehle ME, Schreiber CP |title=Sinus headache, migraine, and the otolaryngologist |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=489–96 |year=2005 |pmid=16213917 |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2005.05.659}}</ref>{{verify source|date=September 2010}} The confusion occurs in part because migraine involves activation of the [[trigeminal nerves]], which innervate both the sinus region and the meninges surrounding the brain. As a result, it is difficult to accurately determine the site from which the pain originates. Additionally, nasal congestion can be a common result of migraine headaches, due to the autonomic nerve stimulation that can also cause tearing ([[lacrimation]]) and a runny nose ([[rhinorrhea]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  A study found that patients with "sinus headaches" responded to triptan migraine medications, but stated dissatisfaction with their treatment when they are treated with decongestants or antibiotics.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Ishkanian, G|title= Efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in migraineurs self-described or physician-diagnosed as having sinus headache: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study|journal=Clin Ther |year=2007 |month=January |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=99–109|doi= 10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.01.012 |pmid= 17379050 |first2= H| first3= CJ| first4= MS| first5= M| last2= Blumenthal| last3= Webster| last4= Richardson| last5= Ames}}</ref> People with migraines do not typically have the thick nasal discharge that is a common symptom of a sinus infection.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The International Classification of Headache Disorders: 2nd edition |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=24 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=9–160 |year=2004 |pmid=14979299 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2004.00653.x |author1= Headache Classification Subcommittee of the International Headache Society}}</ref>

The close proximity of the brain to the sinuses makes the most dangerous complication of sinusitis, particularly involving the frontal and sphenoid sinuses, infection of the brain by the invasion of [[anaerobic organisms|anaerobic bacteria]] through the bones or blood vessels.

Contiguous spread to the orbit may result in periorbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, orbital cellulitis, and abscess. Orbital cellulitis can complicate acute ethmoiditis if anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins thrombophlebitis enables the spread of the infection to the lateral or orbital side of the ethmoid labyrinth.

==Causes==
Factors which may [[:wikt:predisposition|predispose]] someone to developing sinusitis include: [[allergy|allergies]]; structural abnormalities, such as a [[deviated septum]], small [[sinus ostia]] or a [[concha bullosa]]; [[nasal polyp]]s; carrying the [[cystic fibrosis]] gene, though research is still tentative; and prior bouts of sinusitis, because each instance may result in increased inflammation of the nasal or sinus mucosa and potentially further narrow the nasal passageways.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Both smoking and [[second hand smoke]] are associated with chronic rhinosinusitis.<ref name=Ham2011/>

Maxillary sinusitis may also be of dental origin ("odontogenic sinusitis"),<ref>[http://www.lecourrierdudentiste.com/dossiers-du-mois/les-sinusites-maxillaires.html The maxillary sinusitis of dental origin: From diagnosis to treatment] Le courrier du dentiste</ref> and constitutes a significant percentage (about 20% of all cases of maxillary sinusitis),<ref name="Hupp 2008">{{cite book|last=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=317–333|edition=5th ed.}}</ref>  given the close proximity of the teeth and the sinus floor. The cause of this situation is usually a periapical or periodontal infection of a maxillary posterior tooth, where the inflammatory exudate has eroded through the bone superiorly to drain into the maxillary sinus. Once an [[odontogenic infection]] involves the maxilary sinus, it is possible that it may then spread to the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] or to the [[ethmoid sinus]].<ref name="Hupp 2008" /> Complementary tests based on conventional radiology techniques and modern technology may be indicated. Their indication is based on the clinical context.

Chronic sinusitis can also be caused indirectly through a common but slight abnormality within the auditory or [[Eustachian tube]], which is connected to the sinus cavities and the throat. This tube is usually almost level with the eye sockets but when this sometimes hereditary abnormality is present, it is below this level and sometimes level with the vestibule or nasal entrance. This almost always causes some sort of blockage within the sinus cavities ending in infection and usually resulting in chronic sinusitis.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Pathophysiology==
It has been hypothesized that biofilm bacterial [[infection]]s may account for many cases of [[antibiotic]]-refractory chronic sinusitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Palmer JN |title=Bacterial biofilms: do they play a role in chronic sinusitis? |journal=Otolaryngol.

==Diagnosis==

===Acute===
Bacterial and viral [[acute (medicine)|acute]] sinusitis are difficult to distinguish. However, if symptoms last less than 10 days, it is generally considered viral sinusitis. When symptoms last more than 10 days, it is considered bacterial sinusitis.<ref name=Ros2007/> At this point 30% to 50% of cases are bacterial.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Imaging by either Xray, CT or MRI is generally not recommended unless complications develop.<ref name=Ros2007>{{cite journal|last=Rosenfeld|first=RM|coauthors=Andes, D; Bhattacharyya, N; Cheung, D; Eisenberg, S; Ganiats, TG; Gelzer, A; Hamilos, D; Haydon RC, 3rd; Hudgins, PA; Jones, S; Krouse, HJ; Lee, LH; Mahoney, MC; Marple, BF; Mitchell, CJ; Nathan, R; Shiffman, RN; Smith, TL; Witsell, DL|title=Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis.|journal=Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery|date=2007 Sep|volume=137|issue=3 Suppl|pages=S1-31|pmid=17761281}}</ref> Pain caused by sinusitis is sometimes confused for pain caused by [[pulpitis]] (toothache) of the maxillary teeth, and vice versa. Classically, the increased pain when tilting the head forwards separates sinusitis from pulpitis. 

===Chronic===
For sinusitis lasting more than 12 weeks a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] is recommended.<ref name=Ros2007/>  Nasal endoscopy, and clinical symptoms are also used to make a positive diagnosis.<ref name=Leung2008/> A tissue sample for [[histology]] and [[cultures]] can also be collected and tested.<ref name=Harrison>Harrison's Manual of Medicine 16/e</ref> Allergic [[fungal]] sinusitis (AFS) is often seen in people with asthma and [[nasal polyp]]s. In rare cases, [[sinusoscopy]] may be made.

Nasal endoscopy involves inserting a flexible fiber-optic tube with a light and camera at its tip into the nose to examine the nasal passages and sinuses. This is generally a completely painless (although uncomfortable) procedure which takes between five to ten minutes to complete.

==Treatment==
===Conservative===
[[Nasal irrigation]] may help with symptoms of chronic sinusitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harvey R, Hannan SA, Badia L, Scadding G |editor1-last=Harvey |editor1-first=Richard |title=Nasal saline irrigations for the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3 |pages=CD006394 |year=2007 |pmid=17636843 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006394.pub2 }}</ref> Decongestant [[nasal spray]]s containing for example [[oxymetazoline]] may provide relief, but these medications should not be used for more than the recommended period.

===Antibiotics===
The vast majority of cases of sinusitis are caused by viruses and will therefore resolve without antibiotics.<ref name=Leung2008/> However, if symptoms do not resolve within 10 days, [[amoxicillin]] is a reasonable antibiotic to use first for treatment<ref name=Leung2008/> with [[amoxicillin/clavulanate]] being indicated when the person's symptoms do not improve after 7 days on amoxicillin alone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I |title=Treatment modalities for bacterial rhinosinusitis |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=755–69 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20201730 |doi=10.1517/14656561003598901 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14656561003598901}}</ref><ref name=Ros2007/> Antibiotics are specifically not recommended in those with mild / moderate disease during the first week of infection due to risk of adverse effects, [[antibiotic resistance]], and cost.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=SR|coauthors=Montgomery, LG; Williams JW, Jr|title=Treatment of mild to moderate sinusitis.|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=2012 Mar 26|volume=172|issue=6|pages=510–3|pmid=22450938|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2012.253}}</ref>

[[Fluoroquinolones]], and a newer [[macrolide]] antibiotic such as [[clarithromycin]] or a tetracycline like [[doxycycline]], are used in those who have severe allergies to penicillins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Karageorgopoulos DE, Giannopoulou KP, Grammatikos AP, Dimopoulos G, Falagas ME |title=Fluoroquinolones compared with beta-lactam antibiotics for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=CMAJ |volume=178 |issue=7 |pages=845–54 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18362380 |pmc=2267830 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.071157 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18362380}}</ref> Because of increasing resistance to amoxicillin the 2012 guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as the initial treatment of choice for bacterial sinusitis.<ref name=IDSA2012>{{harvnb|IDSA|2012}}</ref> The guidelines also recommend against other commonly used antibiotics, including azithromycin, clarithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, because of growing drug resistance.

A short-course (3–7 days) of antibiotics seems to be just as effective as the typical longer-course (10–14 days) of antibiotics for those with clinically diagnosed acute-bacterial sinusitis without any other severe disease or complicating factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Falagas ME, Karageorgopoulos DE, Grammatikos AP, Matthaiou DK |title=Effectiveness and safety of short vs. long duration of antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis: a meta-analysis of randomized trials |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=161–71 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19154447 |pmc=2670373 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03306.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0306-5251&date=2009&volume=67&issue=2&spage=161}}</ref> The IDSA guideline suggest five to seven days of antibiotics is long enough to treat a bacterial infection without encouraging resistance. The guideline still do recommend children receive antibiotic treatment for 10 days to two weeks.<ref name=IDSA2012/>

===Corticosteroids===
For unconfirmed acute sinusitis, intranasal [[corticosteroids]] have not been found to be better than [[placebo]] either alone or in combination with antibiotics.<ref name=JAMA2007>{{cite journal | author=Ian G. Williamson | title=Antibiotics and Topical Nasal Steroid for Treatment of Acute Maxillary Sinusitis | journal = JAMA | year=2007 | volume =298| pages =2487–96 | doi= 10.1001/jama.298.21.2487 | pmid= 18056902 | issue=21 | author-separator=, | display-authors=1 | last2=Rumsby | first2=K. | last3=Benge | first3=S. | last4=Moore | first4=M. | last5=Smith | first5=P.

There is only limited evidence to support short treatment with oral corticosteroids for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.<ref name="Fokkens W, Lund V, Mullol J 2007 1–136">{{cite journal | author =Fokkens W, Lund V, Mullol J | title =European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2007 | journal =Rhinol Suppl. | volume =  16| issue =20 | pages =1–136 | year =2007 | pmid =17844873 | doi =10.1017/S0959774306000060}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Prim Care Respir J|date=2008 Jun|volume=17|issue=2|pages=79–89|title=EPOS Primary Care Guidelines: European Position Paper on the Primary Care Diagnosis and Management of Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2007 - a summary|author=Thomas M, Yawn BP, Price D, Lund V, Mullol J, Fokkens W; European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps Group |pmid=18438594}}</ref>

===Surgery===
For chronic or recurring sinusitis, referral to an [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologist]] specialist may be indicated, and treatment options may include nasal surgery. Surgery should only be considered for those patients who do not experience sufficient relief from optimal medication.<ref name="Fokkens W, Lund V, Mullol J 2007 1–136"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sinuses.com/faq.htm#surgery |title= FAQ — Sinusitis — WS Tichenor M.D. |accessdate=2007-10-28 |last=Tichenor |first=Wellington S. |date=2007-04-22 }}</ref>

Maxilliary antral washout involves puncturing the sinus and flushing with [[saline (medicine)|saline]] to clear the mucus.  A 1996 study of patients with chronic sinusitis found that washout confers no additional benefits over antibiotics alone.<ref>{{cite pmid|8977854}}</ref>

A number of surgical approaches can be used to access the sinuses and these have generally shifted from external/extranasal approaches to intranasal [[endoscopic]] ones.  The benefit of [[Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery]] (FESS) is its ability to allow for a more targeted approach to the affected sinuses, reducing tissue disruption, and minimizing post-operative complications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stammberger H |title=Endoscopic endonasal surgery—concepts in treatment of recurring rhinosinusitis. Part I. Anatomic and pathophysiologic considerations |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=143–7 |year=1986 |month=February |pmid=3083326 }}</ref>

Another recently developed treatment is [[sinuplasty (procedure)|balloon sinuplasty]]. This method, similar to [[balloon angioplasty]] used to "unclog" arteries of the heart, utilizes balloons in an attempt to expand the openings of the sinuses in a less invasive manner. The utility of this treatment for sinus disease is still under debate but appears promising.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

For persistent symptoms and disease in patients who have failed medical and the functional endoscopic approaches, older techniques can be used to address the inflammation of the maxillary sinus, such as the [[Caldwell-Luc radical antrostomy]].  This surgery involves an incision in the upper gum, opening in the anterior wall of the antrum, removal of the entire diseased maxillary sinus mucosa and drainage is allowed into [[inferior nasal meatus|inferior]]  or [[middle nasal meatus|middle meatus]] by creating a large window in the lateral nasal wall.<ref>Bailey and Love</ref>

==Research==
Based on recent theories on the role that [[fungus]] may play in the development of chronic sinusitis, antifungal treatments have been used, on a trial basis. These trials have had mixed results.<ref name=Leung2008/>
