'''Levosalbutamol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''levalbuterol''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), trade name '''Xopenex''', is the ''R''-[[enantiomer]] of the short-acting [[beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist|β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist]] [[salbutamol]]. It is marketed by [[Cipla]] as '''Levolin''', & by axa named Axazest.

== Uses ==
As a [[bronchodilator]], it is used to treat [[asthma]] and [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). In general, levosalbutamol has similar [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] properties to [[salbutamol]]; however, its manufacturer, [[Sepracor]], has implied (although not directly claimed) that the presence of only the ''R''-[[enantiomer]] produces fewer side effects.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Activation of beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of [[adenylate cyclase]] and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3', 5' -[[adenosine monophosphate]] (cyclic AMP). The increase in cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein [[kinase]] A, which in turn, inhibits the [[phosphorylation]] of [[myosin]] and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation.

Levosalbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to the terminal bronchioles. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways. Levosalbutamol acts as a functional [[agonist]] that relaxes the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thereby protecting against all [[bronchoconstrictor]] challenges. While it is recognized that beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on brochial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta-receptors in the human heart, 10-50% of which are beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established. However, all beta-adrenergic agonist drugs can produce a significant [[cardiovascular]] effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or [[electrocardiographic]] (ECG).

== Preference over salbutamol ==
The use of levosalbutamol over the more traditionally used racemic salbutamol is controversial among health care professionals.  That using levosalbutamol instead of salbutamol produces less direct effect on β1-adrenergic receptors and/or fewer cardiac side effects has been suggested, but not consistently demonstrated by long term, well-designed clinical trials. 

There are differing opinions on whether there is sufficient therapeutic benefit to using levalbuterol that outweighs the 5-10 times higher price tag.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schreck DM, Babin S |title=Comparison of racemic albuterol and levalbuterol in the treatment of acute asthma in the ED |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=842–7 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16291438 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2005.04.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735-6757(05)00159-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hendeles L, Hartzema A |title=Levalbuterol is not more cost-effective than albuterol for COPD |journal=Chest |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=1176; author reply 1176–8 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=12970057 |doi=10.1378/chest.124.3.1176 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/full/124/3/1176}}</ref>  In general, it appears that if a clinician and patient feel that a low dose of racemic mixture is causing undesirable side effects, levalbuterol may be a viable alternative.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abbott MB, Levin RH, Miller JA |title=Point-counterpoint: A comparison of levalbuterol and racemic albuterol in the treatment of pediatric asthma |journal=Pediatr Rev |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=108–9 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14993519 |doi=10.1542/pir.25-3-108 }}</ref>

== Approval ==
Levalbuterol was originally available only as a solution for [[nebulizer]] and eventually become available as a [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]-free [[metered dose inhaler]] under the trade name "Xopenex HFA (levalbuterol [[tartrate]]) Inhalation Aerosol". The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval date was on March 11, 2005. [http://www.xopenex.com/aboutXopenex/inhaler/xopenex-mdi-FAQs.html (See Official FAQ)]
