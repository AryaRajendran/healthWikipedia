The symptoms of a perianal hematoma can present over a short period of time. Pain, varying from mild to severe,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=7SZWRe2OBlgC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=perianal+hematoma&source=web&ots=MDFzjRcX4Z&sig=FxJrXIAC0vyYBd44sY4HIieo4u0#PPA396,M1aClinical Anatomy by Regions] - Richard S. Snell (Google Books)</ref> will occur as the skin surrounding the rupture expands due to pressure. This pain will usually last even after the blood has clotted, and may continue for two to four days.

==Causes==
Perianal hematoma are caused by the rupture of a small [[vein]] that drains [[blood]] from the anus.<ref>[http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_h_05zPzhtm MerckSource - Site Improvements In Progress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This rupture may be the result of forceful or strained bowel movement or caused by heavy lifting, [[cough]]ing or straining. Once the rupture has formed, blood quickly pools within a few hours and, if left untreated, forms a [[clot]].

==Management==
If diagnosed within the first few hours of presentation, the pooling blood may be evacuated using a [[syringe]]. Once the blood has clotted, removal by this method is no longer possible and the clot can be removed  via an incision over the lump under local anesthetic. The incision is not stitched, but will heal very well. Care needs to be taken in regard to bleeding from the wound and possible infection with fecal bacteria. If left alone it will usually heal within a few days or weeks.<ref>[http://www.medbroadcast.com/channel_section_details.asp?text_id=1450&channel_id=1017&relation_id=5225 Perianal hematoma - Medbroadcast<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
