The '''Shettles Method''' is a child [[fertilisation|conception]] idea that is reputed to help determine a [[Infant|baby's]] sex. It was developed by [[Landrum B. Shettles]] in the 1960s and was publicized in the book ''How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby'', coauthored by Shettles and [[David Rorvik]]. The book was first published in 1971 and has been in print in various editions ever since.

By following the various methods outlined in the book, it is proposed that a couple can affect the probability of having a boy or a girl.  Proponents claim between 75 and 90 percent effectiveness, but experts do not agree that the method works;  for example, the 1995 article 'Timing of Sexual Intercourse in Relation to Ovulation—Effects on the Probability of Conception, Survival of the Pregnancy, and Sex of the Baby', in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' concludes that "for practical purposes, the timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation has no influence on the sex of the baby."<ref>{{Cite journal

==Concept==
According to the theory, male (Y) sperm are faster but more fragile than female (X) sperm. Further, acidic environments harm Y sperm, according to the theory, making conception of a girl more likely<ref>{{Cite book

The Shettles method differs from the [[Ericsson method]], in which the semen is deposited outside the woman and time is given for the fast/slow swimmers to separate before [[artificial insemination]] takes place.

===Timing of Intercourse===
In order to have a boy insemination should occur as close as possible to the moment of ovulation so that the faster, Y-sperm arrive first and achieve conception, according to the theory.  When seeking a girl insemination the couple should seek to have sex 2½ to 3 days before ovulation.

===Sexual Position===
Shallow penetration coupled with the sperm deposited close to the entrance favors female conception because the area is more acidic, which inhibits the weaker Y sperm, according to the theory. To allow the Y sperm to reach the egg first (which supposedly moves at a faster rate), deeper penetration should be sought, to deposit the sperm at the least acidic area near the uterus opening.

===Orgasms===
Female [[Orgasm]] favors male sperm because they make the vaginal environment more alkaline.
