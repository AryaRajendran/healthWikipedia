'''Gene therapy''' is the use of [[DNA]] as a pharmaceutical agent to treat disease. It derives its name from the idea that DNA can be used to supplement or alter [[gene]]s within an individual's [[Cell (biology)|cells]] as a therapy to treat [[disease]]. The most common form of gene therapy involves using DNA that encodes a functional, therapeutic gene to replace a [[mutate]]d gene. Other forms involve directly correcting a mutation, or using DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein drug (rather than a natural human gene) to provide treatment. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a "[[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]]", which is used to get the DNA inside cells within the body. Once inside, the DNA becomes expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of therapeutic protein, which in turn treats the patient's disease.

Gene therapy was first conceptualized in 1972, with the authors urging caution before commencing gene therapy studies in humans.<ref name="Friedman 1972" /> The first FDA-approved gene therapy experiment in the [[United States]] occurred in 1990, when Ashanti DeSilva was treated for [[adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA]]-[[severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]].<ref name="Gene Therapy Finds Its Niche">{{cite doi|10.1038/nbt.1769}}</ref> Since then, over 1,700 clinical trials have been conducted using a number of techniques for gene therapy.<ref name="JGenMed Database">[http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical/ ''J.

Although early clinical failures led many to dismiss gene therapy as over-hyped, clinical successes in 2006–2013 have bolstered new optimism in the promise of gene therapy.

==Approach==
Scientists have taken the logical step of trying to introduce genes directly into human cells, focusing on diseases caused by single-gene defects, such as [[cystic fibrosis]], [[haemophilia]], [[muscular dystrophy]], thalassemia, and [[sickle cell anemia]]. However, this has proven more difficult than [[Bacterial transformation|genetically modifying bacteria]], primarily because of the problems involved in carrying large sections of DNA and delivering them to the correct site on the gene. Today, most gene therapy studies are aimed at cancer and hereditary diseases linked to a genetic defect. [[Antisense therapy]] is not strictly a form of gene therapy, but is a related, genetically mediated therapy.

The most common form of genetic engineering involves the insertion of a functional gene at an unspecified location in the host genome. This is accomplished by isolating and copying the gene of interest, generating a construct containing all the genetic elements for correct [[Gene expression|expression]], and then inserting this construct into a random location in the host organism. Other forms of genetic engineering include [[gene targeting]] and knocking out specific genes via engineered [[nucleases]] such as [[zinc finger nucleases]], engineered [[I-CreI]] [[homing endonucleases]], or nucleases generated from [[TAL effector]]s. An example of gene-knockout mediated gene therapy is the knockout of the human [[CCR5]] gene in [[T-cells]] to control [[HIV]] infection.<ref>{{cite pmid|18587387}}</ref> This approach is currently being used in several human clinical trials.<ref name="pmid20717154">{{cite pmid|20717154}}</ref>

==Types of gene therapy==
Gene therapy may be classified into the two following types:

===Somatic gene therapy===
In somatic gene therapy, the therapeutic genes are transferred into the [[somatic cell]]s, or body, of a patient. Any modifications and effects will be restricted to the individual patient only, and will not be inherited by the patient's offspring or later generations. Somatic gene therapy represents the mainstream line of current basic and clinical research, where the therapeutic DNA transgene (either integrated in the genome or as an external episome or plasmid) is used to treat a disease in an individual.

===Germ line gene therapy===
In germ line gene therapy, [[germ cells]], i.e., sperm or eggs, are modified by the introduction of functional genes, which are integrated into their genomes. This would allow the therapy to be heritable and passed on to later generations. Although this should, in theory, be highly effective in counteracting genetic disorders and hereditary diseases, many jurisdictions prohibit this for application in human beings, at least for the present, for a variety of technical and ethical reasons.<ref>Strachnan, T. and Read,  A. P. (2004) ''Human Molecular Genetics'', 3rd Edition, Garland Publishing, p. 616, ISBN 0815341849.</ref>

==Vectors in gene therapy==
{{Main|Vectors in Gene Therapy}}

Gene therapy utilizes the delivery of DNA into cells, which can be accomplished by [[Vectors in Gene Therapy|a number of methods]]. The two major classes of methods are those that use recombinant viruses (sometimes called biological nanoparticles or viral vectors) and those that use naked DNA or DNA complexes (non-viral methods).

===Viruses===
{{Main|Viral vector}}
All [[virus]]es bind to their hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as part of their replication cycle. Therefore this has been recognized as a plausible strategy for gene therapy, by removing the viral DNA and using the virus as a vehicle to deliver the therapeutic DNA.

A number of viruses have been used for human gene therapy, including [[retrovirus]], [[adenovirus]], [[lentivirus]], [[herpes simplex virus]], [[vaccinia]], [[pox virus]], and [[adeno-associated virus]].<ref name="JGenMed Database" />

===Non-viral methods===
Non-viral methods can present certain advantages over viral methods, such as large scale production and low host immunogenicity. Previously, low levels of [[transfection]] and [[gene expression|expression of the gene]] held non-viral methods at a disadvantage; however, recent advances in vector technology have yielded molecules and techniques that approach the transfection efficiencies of viruses.

There are [[Vectors in Gene Therapy#Non-viral methods|several methods for non-viral gene therapy]], including the injection of naked DNA, [[electroporation]], the [[gene gun]], [[sonoporation]], [[magnetofection]], and the use of [[oligonucleotide]]s, lipoplexes, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles.

==Major developments in gene therapy==

===1970s and earlier===
In 1972 Friedmann and Roblin authored a paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' titled "Gene therapy for human genetic disease?"<ref name="Friedman 1972">{{cite doi|10.1126/science.175.4025.949}}</ref> Rogers (1970) was cited for proposing that ''exogenous good DNA'' be used to replace the defective DNA in those who suffer from genetic defects.<ref>Rogers S, New Scientist 1970, p.&nbsp;194</ref>

===1990s===
The first approved gene therapy case in the United States took place on 14 September 1990, at the National Institute of Health. It was performed on a four year old girl named Ashanti DeSilva. It was a treatment for a genetic defect that left her with [[adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA]]-[[severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]], a severe immune system deficiency. The effects were only temporary, but successful.<ref>{{cite pmid|7570001}}</ref>

New gene therapy approach repairs errors in messenger RNA derived from defective genes. This technique has the potential to treat the blood disorder [[thalassaemia]], [[cystic fibrosis]], and some cancers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2915-subtle-gene-therapy-tackles-blood-disorder.html |title=Subtle gene therapy tackles blood disorder |date= 11 October 2002|author=Penman, Danny |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref>

The researchers demonstrated this method of gene therapy to be a more permanent means to increase the production of the therapeutic HbF.<ref name="St Jude">{{cite web|last=St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|title=Gene Therapy Corrects Sickle Cell Disease In Laboratory Study|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081203184643.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|accessdate=29 December 2012|date=4 December 2008}}</ref> 

In 1992 Doctor Claudio Bordignon working at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy performed the first procedure of gene therapy using [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s as vectors to deliver genes intended to correct hereditary diseases.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/356465a0}}</ref> In 2002 this work led to the publication of the first successful gene therapy treatment for adenosine deaminase-deficiency (SCID). The success of a multi-center trial for treating children with SCID ([[severe combined immune deficiency]] or "bubble boy" disease) held from 2000 and 2002 was questioned when two of the ten children treated at the trial's Paris center developed a leukemia-like condition. Clinical trials were halted temporarily in 2002, but resumed after regulatory review of the protocol in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cavazzana-Calvo M, Thrasher A, Mavilio F |title=The future of gene therapy |journal=Nature |volume=427 |issue=6977 |pages=779–81 |year=2004 |month=Feb |pmid=14985734 |doi=10.1038/427779a |bibcode = 2004Natur.427..779C }}</ref>

In 1993 Andrew Gobea was born with [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID). Genetic screening before birth showed that he had SCID. Blood was removed from Andrew's placenta and umbilical cord immediately after birth, containing stem cells. The allele that codes for [[Adenosine deaminase|ADA]] was obtained and was inserted into a retrovirus. Retroviruses and stem cells were mixed, after which the viruses entered and inserted the gene into the stem cells' chromosomes. Stem cells containing the working ADA gene were injected into Andrew's blood system via a vein. Injections of the ADA enzyme were also given weekly. For four years [[T cell]]s (white blood cells), produced by stem cells, made ADA enzymes using the ADA gene. After four years more treatment was needed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===2000s===

====2003====
In 2003 a [[University of California, Los Angeles]] research team inserted genes into the brain using [[liposomes]] coated in a [[polymer]] called [[polyethylene glycol]]. The transfer of genes into the brain is a significant achievement because viral vectors are too big to get across the [[blood–brain barrier]]. This method has potential for treating [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3520-undercover-genes-slip-into-the-brain.html|author= Ananthaswamy, Anil |title=Undercover genes slip into the brain |publisher=New Scientist |date=20 March 2003 |accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref>

[[RNA interference]] or [[gene silencing]] may be a new way to treat [[Huntington's disease]]. Short pieces of double-stranded RNA (short, interfering RNAs or [[siRNA]]s) are used by cells to degrade RNA of a particular sequence. If a siRNA is designed to match the RNA copied from a faulty gene, then the abnormal protein product of that gene will not be produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3493-gene-therapy-may-switch-off-huntingtons.html |title=Gene therapy may switch off Huntington's |publisher=New Scientist |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=17 August 2010|author=Holmes, Bob }}</ref>

====2006====
Scientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] ([[Bethesda, Maryland]]) have successfully treated metastatic melanoma in two patients using killer T cells genetically retargeted to attack the cancer cells. This study constitutes one of the first demonstrations that gene therapy can be effective in treating [[cancer]].<ref><!-- Confirm correct ref-->{{Cite pmid|16946036}}</ref>

In March 2006 an international group of scientists announced the successful use of gene therapy to treat two adult patients for a disease affecting [[myeloid]] cells. The study, published in Nature Medicine, is believed to be the first to show that gene therapy can cure diseases of the [[myeloid]] system.<ref><!-- Confirm correct ref-->{{Cite pmid|16582916}}</ref>

In May 2006 a team of scientists led by Dr. Luigi Naldini and Dr. Brian Brown from the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (HSR-TIGET) in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] reported a breakthrough for gene therapy in which they developed a way to prevent the immune system from rejecting a newly delivered gene.<ref>{{Cite pmid|16633348}}</ref> Similar to [[organ transplant]]ation, gene therapy has been plagued by the problem of immune rejection. So far, delivery of the 'normal' gene has been difficult because the [[immune system]] recognizes the new gene as foreign and rejects the cells carrying it. To overcome this problem, the HSR-TIGET group utilized a newly uncovered network of genes regulated by molecules known as [[microRNA]]s. Dr. Naldini's group reasoned that they could use this natural function of microRNA to selectively turn off the identity of their therapeutic gene in cells of the immune system and prevent the gene from being found and destroyed. The researchers injected mice with the gene containing an immune-cell microRNA target sequence, and the mice did not reject the gene, as previously occurred when vectors without the microRNA target sequence were used. This work will have important implications for the treatment of hemophilia and other genetic diseases by gene therapy.

In November 2006 Preston Nix from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] reported on VRX496, a gene-based [[immunotherapy]] for the treatment of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) that uses a [[lentivirus|lentiviral]] [[viral vector|vector]] for delivery of an [[Sense (molecular biology)|antisense]] gene against the [[HIV envelope]]. In the Phase I trial enrolling five subjects with chronic HIV infection who had failed to respond to at least two [[antiretroviral]] regimens, a single intravenous infusion of [[autologous]] [[CD4]] T cells genetically modified with VRX496 was safe and well tolerated. All patients had stable or decreased viral load; four of the five patients had stable or increased CD4 T cell counts. In addition, all five patients had stable or increased immune response to HIV [[antigen]]s and other [[pathogen]]s. This was the first evaluation of a lentiviral vector administered in U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]-approved human clinical trials for any disease.<ref>{{Cite pmid|17090675}}</ref> Data from an ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial were presented at CROI 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-02/uops-pmp021009.php|date=10 February 2009|title=Penn Medicine presents HIV gene therapy trial data at CROI 2009|accessdate=19 November 2009|publisher=EurekAlert!}}</ref>

====2007====

On 1 May 2007 [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]] and [[University College London]]'s Institute of Ophthalmology announced the world's first gene therapy trial for inherited retinal disease. The first operation was carried out on a 23 year-old British male, [[Robert Simon Johnson|Robert Johnson]], in early 2007.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6609205.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gene therapy first for poor sight | date=1 May 2007 | accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]] is an inherited blinding disease caused by mutations in the [[RPE65]] gene.

==Problems==
For the safety of gene therapy, the [[Weismann barrier]] is fundamental in the current thinking. Soma-to-germline feedback should therefore be impossible. However, there are indications<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.planet.nl/~gkorthof/kortho39a.htm |title=The implications of Steele's soma-to-germline feedback for human gene therapy |author=Korthof G}}</ref> that the Weismann barrier can be breached. One way it might possibly be breached is if the treatment were somehow misapplied and spread to the testes and therefore would infect the germline against the intentions of the therapy.

Some of the problems of gene therapy include:
*Short-lived nature of gene therapy – Before gene therapy can become a permanent cure for any condition, the therapeutic DNA introduced into target cells must remain functional and the cells containing the therapeutic DNA must be long-lived and stable. Problems with integrating therapeutic DNA into the [[genome]] and the rapidly dividing nature of many cells prevent gene therapy from achieving any long-term benefits. Patients will have to undergo multiple rounds of gene therapy.
*Immune response – Any time a foreign object is introduced into human tissues, the immune system has evolved to attack the invader. The risk of stimulating the immune system in a way that reduces gene therapy effectiveness is always a possibility. Furthermore, the [[immune system]]'s enhanced response to invaders that it has seen before makes it difficult for gene therapy to be repeated in patients.
*Problems with viral vectors – Viruses, the carrier of choice in most gene therapy studies, present a variety of potential problems to the patient: toxicity, immune and inflammatory responses, and gene control and targeting issues. In addition, there is always the fear that the viral vector, once inside the patient, may recover its ability to cause disease.
*[[Multigene disorders]] – Conditions or disorders that arise from [[mutation]]s in a single gene are the best candidates for gene therapy. Unfortunately, some of the most commonly occurring disorders, such as [[heart disease]], [[high blood pressure]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[arthritis]], and [[diabetes]], are caused by the combined effects of variations in many genes. Multigene or multifactorial disorders such as these would be especially difficult to treat effectively using gene therapy (although a 2013 trial using genes Ins and Gck reported promise in treating diabetes in dogs<ref>{{Cite doi|10.2337/db12-1113}}</ref>).
*Chance of inducing a [[tumor]] (insertional mutagenesis) – If the DNA is integrated in the wrong place in the genome, for example in a [[tumor suppressor gene]], it could induce a tumor. This has occurred in clinical trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) patients, in which hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with a corrective transgene using a retrovirus, and this led to the development of T cell leukemia in 3 of 20 patients.<ref>{{cite pmid|16641981}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16988659}}</ref> One possible solution for this is to add a functional tumor suppressor gene onto the DNA to be integrated; however, this poses its own problems, since the longer the DNA is, the harder it is to integrate it efficiently into cell genomes.

Three patients' deaths have been reported in gene therapy trials, putting the field under close scrutiny. The first was that of [[Jesse Gelsinger]] in 1999,<ref>[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/medicine/genetherapy.shtml#status ORNL.gov]. ORNL.gov. Retrieved on 15 December 2012.</ref> which represented a major setback in the field. One X-SCID patient died of leukemia following gene therapy treatment in 2003.<ref name="Gene Therapy Finds Its Niche" /> In 2007, a rheumatoid arthritis patient died from an infection in a gene therapy trial; a subsequent investigation concluded that the death was not related to her gene therapy treatment.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMoa0801066}}</ref>

==Preventive gene therapy==

Preventive gene therapy is the repair of a gene with a mutation associated with a progressive disease, prior to the expression of a medical condition, to prevent that expression.

One case study of preventive gene therapy: Retinitis Pigmentosa

Blindness can be caused by multiple genetic diseases. Many gene therapy efforts have been focused on treating blindness as a result of moderate success in preventing the loss of vision in multiple animal models. To do this, blindness must be diagnosed early on before the symptoms begin. The retina, which is located in the back of the eyeball, is the first step in processing visual information, accordingly it is a common target in exploration of the genetic issue that leads to blindness. One [[genetic disease|autosomal genetic disease]] that has been extensively researched is retinitis pigmentosa (RP) because it has excellent animal models for genetic therapy techniques to treat blindness.

Within a single disease, there can be multiple preventative gene therapy strategies used to combat the progression of the symptoms. Most people who suffer from RP are born with [[rod cells]] that are either dead or dysfunctional, so they are effectively blind at nighttime, since these are the cells responsible for vision in low levels of light. What follows often is the death of [[cone cells]], responsible for color vision and acuity, at light levels present during the day. Loss of cones leads to full blindness as early as five years old, but may not onset until many years later. There have been multiple hypotheses about how the lack of rod cells can lead to the death of cone cells. Pinpointing a mechanism for RP is difficult because there are more than 39 genetic loci and genes correlated with this disease. In an effort to find the cause of RP, there have been different gene therapy techniques applied to address each of the hypotheses.<ref>{{cite pmid|22573664}}</ref>

One hypothesis is that when the rod cells die, there is no longer a critical growth factor secreted for proper cone function and survival. Some scientists have experimented with treating this issue by injecting substitute trophic factors into the eye. One group of researchers injected the rod derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) protein (encoded for by the Nxnl1 (Txnl6) gene) into the eye of the most commonly occurring dominant RP mutation rat models. This treatment demonstrated success in promoting the survival of cone activity, but the treatment served even more significantly to prevent progression of the disease by increasing the actual function of the cones.<ref>{{cite pmid|19277021}}</ref> Two of the major issues encountered when trying to inject these desirable proteins, is that they are both difficult to purify and difficult to deliver multiple times as a consistent treatment. Researchers are currently trying to develop an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to use for such treatments to address these problems. Injection of an AAV vector encoding this factor might only have to happen once. 

Another issue is choosing which protein to inject. Multiple candidates such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF) have demonstrated functional success within the eye when they are delivered to the subretinal region. One of the most successful proteins of those aforementioned, is ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). CNTF has shown success of slowing retinal degradation in 13 different animal models. CNTF is currently being used as a treatment in human clinical trials.<ref>{{cite pmid|16505355}}</ref> In Phase I of the clinical trial, there were 10 participants suffering from advanced RP who each had one of their eyes implanted with CNTF encapsulated cell devices for six months, followed by explantation. Five of the participants received higher dose implants of CNTF, and the other five received an approximately five times smaller dose implant. Multiple participants displayed improved acuity both while the implant was in the eye, and one month later when retested. In some of the other animal models, high doses of CNTF have demonstrated increased photoreceptor metabolic activity, which suggests that it is possible for CNTF to increase photoreceptor metabolic activity in human damaged cones as well. CNTF could improve metabolic activity in photoreceptor cones to the extent that it improves visual acuity, as seen in several of the participants who performed significantly better on the letter recognition task compared to their respective pretreatment baseline. Although not all of the participants experienced a significant increase in visual acuity, this method of encapsulated implantations poses an intriguing line of research. It offers the advantage of being reversible, as one can remove the encapsulated cells should anything go wrong. Gene therapy using viral vectors to deliver a therapeutic gene is not obviously reversible.

==In popular culture==
*In the TV series ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]'' gene therapy is mentioned as one of the practices performed on transgenics and their surrogate mothers at Manticore, and in the episode Prodigy, Dr. Tanaka uses a groundbreaking new form of gene therapy to turn Jude, a premature, vegetative baby of a crack/cocaine addict, into a boy genius.
*Gene therapy is a crucial plot element in the video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', where it has been used to illegally enhance the battle capabilities of soldiers within the US military, and their Next Generation Special Forces units.
*Gene therapy plays a major role in the sci-fi series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', as a certain type of alien technology can only be used if one has a certain gene which can be given to the members of the team through gene therapy involving a mouse retrovirus.
*Gene therapy also plays a major role in the plot of the [[James Bond]] movie ''[[Die Another Day]]'', where a scientist has developed a means of altering peoples' entire appearances through the use of DNA samples acquired from others- generally homeless people that would not be missed- that are subsequently injected into the bone marrow, the resulting transformation apparently depriving the subjects of the ability to sleep.
*Gene therapy plays a recurring role in the ''present-time'' sci-fi television program [[ReGenesis]], where it is used to cure various diseases, enhance athletic performance and produce vast profits for bio-tech corporations. (e.g. an undetectable performance-enhancing gene therapy was used by one of the characters on himself, but to avoid copyright infringement, this gene therapy was modified from the tested-to-be-harmless original, which produced a fatal cardiovascular defect)
*Gene therapy is the basis for the plot line of the film ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080508185334.htm |title=A Real-life 'I Am Legend?'

*Gene therapy is an important plot key in the game [[Bioshock]] where the game contents refer to [[plasmids]] and [gene] splicers.
*The book ''[[Next (novel)|Next]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] unravels a story in which fictitious biotechnology companies experiment with gene therapy.
*In the television show ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', a breakthrough in molecular gene therapy is discovered, whereby a patient's body is reshaped to identically resemble someone else. Protagonist [[Sydney Bristow]]'s best friend was secretly killed and her "double" resumed her place.
*In the 2011 film ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'', a fictional gene therapy called ALZ-112 was a drug that was a possible cure for [[Alzheimer's disease]], the therapy increased the host's intelligence and made their irises green, along with the revised therapy called 113 which increased intelligence in [[ape]]s yet was a deadly, internal [[virus]] in humans.
