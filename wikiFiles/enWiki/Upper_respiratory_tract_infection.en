'''Upper respiratory tract infections''' ('''URI''' or '''URTI''') are the illnesses caused by an acute [[infection]] which involves the upper [[respiratory tract]]: [[human nose|nose]], [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]], [[pharynx]] or [[larynx]]. This commonly includes: tonsillitis, [[pharyngitis]], [[laryngitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[otitis media]], and the [[common cold]].<ref name="Eccles2007">{{cite journal |author=Eccles MP, Grimshaw JM, Johnston M, ''et al.'' |title=Applying psychological theories to evidence-based clinical practice: Identifying factors predictive of managing upper respiratory tract infections without antibiotics |journal=Implement Sci |volume=2 |pages=26 |year=2007 |pmid=17683558 |pmc=2042498 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-2-26 |url=}}</ref>

Common URI terms are defined as follows:
* [[Rhinitis]] - Inflammation of the nasal mucosa
* Rhinosinusitis or [[sinusitis]] - Inflammation of the nares and paranasal sinuses, including frontal, ethmoid, maxillary, and sphenoid
* [[Nasopharyngitis]] (rhinopharyngitis or the common cold) - Inflammation of the nares, pharynx,hypopharynx, uvula, and tonsils
* [[Pharyngitis]] - Inflammation of the pharynx, hypopharynx, uvula, and tonsils
* [[Epiglottitis]] (supraglottitis) - Inflammation of the superior portion of the larynx and supraglottic area
* [[Laryngitis]] - Inflammation of the larynx
* [[Laryngotracheitis]] - Inflammation of the larynx, trachea, and subglottic area
* [[Tracheitis]] - Inflammation of the trachea and subglottic area

==Signs and symptoms==
Acute upper respiratory tract infections include [[rhinitis]], [[pharyngitis]]/[[tonsillitis]] and [[laryngitis]] often referred to as a [[common cold]], and their complications: [[sinusitis]], [[ear infection]] and sometimes [[bronchitis]] (though bronchi are generally classified as part of the lower respiratory tract.) Symptoms of URI's commonly include [[cough]], [[sore throat]], [[runny nose]], [[nasal congestion]], [[headache]], low grade [[fever]], facial pressure and [[sneezing]]. Onset of symptoms usually begins 1–3 days after exposure.  The illness usually lasts 7–10 days.

Group A beta hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis(strep throat) typically presents with a sudden onset of sore throat, pain with swallowing and fever.  Strep throat does not usually cause runny nose, voice changes or cough.

Pain and pressure of the ear caused by a middle ear infection ([[Otitis media]]) and the reddening of the eye caused by viral [[Conjunctivitis]] are often associated with upper respiratory infections.

==Cause==

Over 200 different viruses have been isolated in patients with URIs. The most common virus is called the [[rhinovirus]]. Other viruses include the [[coronavirus]], [[parainfluenza virus]], [[adenovirus]], [[enterovirus]], and [[respiratory syncytial virus]].<ref>Viruses and Bacteria in the Etiology of the Common Cold Mika J. Mäkelä, Tuomo Puhakka, Olli Ruuskanen, Maija Leinonen, Pekka Saikku, Marko Kimpimäki, Soile Blomqvist, Timo Hyypiä, and Pertti Arstila
J Clin Microbiol. 1998 February; 36(2): 539–542.</ref>

Up to 15% of acute pharyngitis cases may be caused by bacteria, most commonly ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' a [[Group A streptococcus]]  in [[Streptococcal pharyngitis]] ("Strep Throat").<ref>Bisno, AL. Acute pharyngitis. N Engl J Med 2001; 344:205.</ref> 

[[Influenza]] (the flu) is a more severe systemic illness which typically involves the upper respiratory tract.  Influenza is a relatively uncommon cause of [[influenza-like illness]].

==Prevention==
[[Probiotics]] may be useful in preventing URTIs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hao|first=Q|coauthors=Lu, Z, Dong, BR, Huang, CQ, Wu, T|title=Probiotics for preventing acute upper respiratory tract infections|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2011 Sep 7|volume=9|pages=CD006895|pmid=21901706|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006895.pub2|editor1-last=Dong|editor1-first=Bi Rong|issue=9}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. There are currently no medications or herbal remedies which have been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of the illness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = SM | last2 = Schroeder | first2 = K | last3 = Fahey | first3 = T | last4 = Smith | first4 = Susan M | title = Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings | journal = Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) | issue = 1 | pages = CD001831 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18253996 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001831.pub3 | editor1-last = Smith | editor1-first = Susan M }}</ref> Treatment comprises symptomatic support usually via [[analgesics]] for headache, sore throat and muscle aches.<ref>^ "Common Cold: Treatments and Drugs". Mayo Clinic. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/common-cold/DS00056/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs. Retrieved 09 January 2010.</ref>

Moderate exercise in sedentary subjects with naturally acquired URTI probably does not alter the overall severity and duration of the illness.<ref name="pmid12893713">{{cite journal |author=Weidner T, Schurr T |title=Effect of exercise on upper respiratory tract infection in sedentary subjects |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=304–6 |year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12893713 |pmc=1724675 |doi= 10.1136/bjsm.37.4.304|url=}}</ref> Getting plenty of sleep; however, is advisable since even mild sleep deprivation has been shown to be associated with increased susceptibility to infection.<ref>"Effects of sleep on the production of cytokines in humansPsychosomatic Medicine", Vol 57, Issue 2 97-104</ref><ref>Behavioural Brain Research Volume 69, Issues 1-2, July–August 1995, Pages 43-54 The Function of Sleep</ref> No randomized trials have been conducted to ascertain benefits of  increasing fluid intake. <ref>BMJ. 2004;328:499-500</ref>

===Antibiotics===
Judicious use of antibiotics can decrease unnecessary adverse effects of antibiotics as well as out-of-pocket costs to the patient. But more importantly, decreased antibiotic usage will prevent the rise of [[drug resistance|drug resistant bacteria]], which is now a growing problem in the world. Health authorities have been strongly encouraging physicians to decrease the prescribing of antibiotics to treat common upper respiratory tract infections because antibiotic usage does not significantly reduce recovery time for these viral illnesses.<ref name="pmid17443555">{{cite journal | author = Reveiz L, Cardona AF, Ospina EG | title = Antibiotics for acute laryngitis in adults | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD004783 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17443555 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004783.pub3 | editor1-last = Reveiz | editor1-first = Ludovic}}</ref> Some have advocated a delayed antibiotic approach to treating URIs which seeks to reduce the consumption of antibiotics while attempting to maintain patient satisfaction. Most studies show no difference in improvement of symptoms between those treated with antibiotics right away and those with delayed prescriptions.<ref name="pmid17636757">{{cite journal | author = Spurling GK, Del Mar CB, Dooley L, Foxlee R | title = Delayed antibiotics for respiratory infections | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 3 | pages = CD004417 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17636757 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004417.pub3 | editor1-last = Spurling | editor1-first = Geoffrey KP}}</ref> Most studies also show no difference in patient satisfaction, patient complications, symptoms between delayed and no antibiotics. A strategy of "no antibiotics" results in even less antibiotic use than a strategy of "delayed antibiotics".  However, in certain higher risk patients with underlying lung disease, such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), evidence does exist to support the treatment of [[bronchitis]] with antibiotics to shorten the course of the illness and decrease treatment failure.<ref name="pmid16625602">{{cite journal | author = Ram FS, Rodriguez-Roisin R, Granados-Navarrete A, Garcia-Aymerich J, Barnes NC | title = Antibiotics for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD004403 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16625602 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004403.pub2 | editor1-last = Ram | editor1-first = Felix SF}}</ref>

===Decongestants===
According to a Cochrane review single oral dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is modestly effective for the short term relief of congestion in adults; however, "there is insufficient data on the use of decongestants in children." Therefore decongestants are not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age with the common cold.<ref>Spurling GKP, Del Mar C, Dooley L, Foxlee R. Delayed antibiotics for respiratory infections. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2007, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD004417. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD004417.pub3}}.</ref>  Oral decongestants are also contraindicated in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and history of bleeding strokes.<ref>Tietze KJ.

===Alternative medicine===
The use of [[Vitamin C]] in the inhibition and treatment of upper respiratory infections has been suggested since the initial isolation of vitamin C in the 1930s. Some evidence exists to indicate that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and/or cold environments.<ref name="pmid17636648">{{cite journal | author = Douglas RM, Hemilä H, Chalker E, Treacy B | title = Vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 3 | pages = CD000980 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17636648 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub3 | editor1-last = Hemilä | editor1-first = Harri}}</ref>

The benefits versus risk of [[nasal irrigation]] are currently unclear and therefore is not recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kassel|first=JC|coauthors=King, D, Spurling, GK|title=Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2010-03-17|issue=3|pages=CD006821|pmid=20238351|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006821.pub2|editor1-last=King|editor1-first=David}}</ref>

Transmission is via respiratory droplets or by virus-contaminated hands. Upper respiratory tract (nose, throat, sinuses) mucosa inflammation causes increased secretions, [[rhinorrhea]] and results in sneezing, and coughing facilitating the spread.

In United States URIs are the most common infectious illness in the general population. URIs are the leading reasons for people missing work and school. URI is the leading diagnosis in the office setting.<ref>1.Cherry DK, Hing E, Woodwell DA, Rechtsteiner EA. National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey: 2006 Summary.
