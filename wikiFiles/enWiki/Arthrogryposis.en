'''Arthrogryposis''',  also known as '''arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC)''', is a rare [[congenital disorder]] that is characterized by multiple [[joint]] [[contracture]]s and can include [[muscle weakness]] and [[fibrosis]]. It is a non-progressive disease. The disease derives its name from Greek, literally meaning 'curved or hooked joints.'<ref name=Artho>[http://www.arthrogryposis.ie/html/arthrogryposis.htm ARTHROGRYPOSIS - Page Has Moved<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.kumc.edu/gec/support/arthrogr.html Arthrogryposis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=MED1>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7533 AMC (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita) definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=NLM>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/jablonski/syndromes/syndrome039.html Congenital Syndromes Database Closed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=DPO>http://www.dpo.uab.edu/~birmie/amc.htm</ref><ref name=Alfonso>{{cite journal | author = Alfonso I., Papazian O., Paez J.O., Grossman J.A.I | year = 2000 | title = Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita | url = | journal = International Pediatrics | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 197–204 }}</ref><ref name= NORD>[http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=Arthrogryposis%20Multiplex%20Congenita NORD - National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=Ortho>[http://www.orthoseek.com/articles/arthrogryposis.html Orthoseek | Orthopedic Topics | Arthrogryoposis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=MED2>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7546 Arthrogryposis definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Donohue M, Bleakney DA.

There are many known subgroups of AMC, with differing signs, symptoms, causes etc.<ref name=MED1 /> In some cases, few joints may be affected and may have a nearly full range of motion. In the most common type of arthrogryposis, called [[amyoplasia]], hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, feet and knees are affected. In the most severe types, nearly every joint is involved, including the jaw and back. 

Frequently, the contractures are accompanied by muscle weakness, which further limits movement. AMC is typically symmetrical and involves all four extremities with some variation seen.<ref name=Artho /><ref name=DPO />

==Signs and symptoms==
There are numerous symptoms for this group of conditions.<ref name=NLM /> Some of the more common signs and symptoms are associated with the shoulder (internal rotation), elbow (extension and pronation), wrist (volar and ulnar), hand (fingers in fixed flexion and thumb-in-palm), hip (flexed, abducted and externally rotated, often dislocated), knee (flexion) and foot ([[clubfoot]]).<ref name=Ortho /> Complications may include [[scoliosis]], [[pulmonary hypoplasia]], respiratory problems, [[growth retardation]], [[midfacial hemangioma]], facial and jaw variations, and abdominal hernias.  Cognition and language are usually normal.<ref name=DPO />

==Causes==
The cause is unknown,<ref name=NORD /> although several mechanisms have been suggested. This includes [[hyperthermia]] of the fetus, prenatal virus, fetal vascular compromise, septum of the uterus, decreased amniotic fluid, muscle and connective tissue developmental abnormalities.<ref name=DPO /><ref name=Alfonso /> In general, the causes can be classified into extrinsic and intrinsic factors.

===Extrinsic===
* There is insufficient room in the [[uterus]] for normal movement. For example, fetal crowding; the mother may lack a normal amount of [[amniotic fluid]] or have abnormally shaped uterine muscles.<ref name=MED1 /><ref name=MED2 />

===Intrinsic===
* Neurological - [[Central nervous system]] and [[spinal cord]] are [[malformation|malformed]]. In these cases, a wide range of other conditions usually accompanies arthrogryposis.<ref name=Alfonso />
* Connective Tissue - Tendons, bones, joints or joint linings may develop abnormally. For example, tendons may not be connected to the proper place in a joint.<ref name=MED1 /><ref name=MED2 />

Research has shown that anything that prevents normal joint movement before birth can result in joint contractures. The joint itself may be normal. However, when a joint is not moved for a period of time, extra [[connective tissue]] tends to grow around it, fixing it in position. Lack of joint movement also means that [[tendon]]s connecting to the joint are not stretched to their normal length; short tendons, in turn, make normal joint movement difficult. (This same kind of problem can develop after birth in joints that are immobilized for long periods of time in casts.) 

The principal cause of AMC is believed to be decreased fetal movements (akinesia) caused by maternal or fetal abnormalities.  It is associated with neurogenic and myopathic disorders.  It is believed that the neuropathic form of AMC involves a deterioration in the anterior horn cell leading to muscle weakness and fibrosis.<ref>Berkow R ed. The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. 16th ed. . Rathway, NJ: Merck Research Laboratories;1992:2075</ref> 
  
In most cases, arthrogryposis is not a [[genetics|genetic]] condition and does not occur more than once in a family. In about 30% of the cases, a genetic cause can be identified. The risk of recurrence for these cases varies with the type of genetic disorder.<ref name=NLM /> There is a rare [[autosomal recessive]] form of the disease known to exist.<ref name=NORD />

==Diagnosis==
To date, no prenatal diagnostic tools are available to test for the condition. Diagnosis is only used to rule out other causes. This is done by undertaking muscle [[biopsies]], [[blood test]]s and general clinical findings rule out other disorders and provides evidence for AMC.<ref name=DPO />

== Treatment ==
While there is no reversal of this condition, individual quality of life can be greatly improved. As each person will respond differently, and will have different needs, a combination of therapies is beneficial. [[Physical therapy]] including stretching, strengthening, and mobility training are often provided to improve flexion and range of motion to increase mobility. [[Occupational therapy]] (may also include [[Orthopedic cast|casting]], [[splint]]ing of affected joints) can include training in ADL and fine motor skills as well as addressing psychosocial and emotional implications of living with a disability. Since there is a variety of mobility impairments, individually tailored [[orthopaedic]] correction is often beneficial.  Orthopedic surgery, which include osteotomy or external Ilizarov fixator, may be elected to correct severely affected joints and limbs and symptoms such as clubfoot, hernia repair and correction of unilateral hip dislocation, in cases where these surgeries improve quality of life. However, in most cases, the contractures would recur despite surgery. A surgery called Tendon Release is usually done to stretch out the tendon that makes most patients walk on their toes.

==Prognosis==
Individuals with AMC are aided by vigorous therapy and in some cases surgical intervention. This varies to some degree, depending on the severity of mobility reduction.<ref name=DPO />  AMC is not a progressive disorder. Typically these individuals have normal cognition and speech and therefore the potential for productive, rewarding, and independent lives.

==Epidemiology==
AMC is relatively rare occurring in 1 out of every 3,000 live births.<ref name=DPO /><ref name=Ortho />  [[Amyoplasia]], characterized by fatty and fibrous tissue replacement of the limb muscles, is the most common form, at 43% of reported cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hall JG |title=Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita: etiology, genetics, classification, diagnostic approach, and general aspects |journal=J Pediatr Orthop B |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=159–66 |year=1997 |pmid=9260643 |doi= 10.1097/01202412-199707000-00002|url=}}</ref> The majority of individuals thrive, with a minority strongly affected by respiratory muscle involvement.
