{{Main|List of blood donation agencies in the United States}}

The United States does not have a centralized blood donation service.  The [[American Red Cross]] collects a little less than half of the blood used, the other half is collected by independent agencies, most of which are members of [[America's Blood Centers]].  The US military collects blood from service members for its own use, but also draws blood from the civilian supply.<ref>[http://www.militaryblood.dod.mil/ Armed Services Blood Program: The Official Program for Blood Donation and Collection for the Armed Services<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
