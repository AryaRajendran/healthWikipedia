'''Septo-optic dysplasia''' (SOD), also known as '''de Morsier syndrome'''<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2548}}</ref><ref>G. de Morsier. Études sur les dysraphies, crânioencéphaliques. III. Agénésie du septum palludicum avec malformation du tractus optique. La dysplasie septo-optique. Schweizer Archiv für Neurologie und Psychiatrie, Zurich, 1956, 77: 267-292.</ref> is a [[congenital disorder|congenital]] [[birth defect|malformation]] [[syndrome]] made manifest by hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the [[optic nerve]] and absence of the [[septum pellucidum]] (a midline part of the [[brain]]). Vision in each eye can be unaffected, partially lost, or in some patients, completely absent.

Although not included in the name, [[hypopituitarism]] is sometimes included in the definition.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000033252|septo-optic dysplasia}}</ref>

Neuroradiologically, intracranial malformations associated with septo-optic dysplasia include [[agenesis]] of the [[septum pellucidum]], [[schizencephaly]], and lobar [[holoprosencephaly]].

===Optic nerve===
The optic nerve hypoplasia is generally manifested by [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (involuntary eye movements, often side-to-side) and a smaller-than-usual optic disc. The degree of visual impairment is variable, and ranges from normal vision to complete blindness. When nystagmus develops, it typically appears by 1–8 months of age, and usually indicates that there will be a significant degree of visual impairment, but the severity is difficult to predict in infancy. Although there are many measures to compensate for visual impairment, there are few treatments available to induce normal optic nerve function.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp=40678268&#40678268&from=en-us_msnhp&snid=18424776</ref>

===Pituitary===
The degree of [[pituitary]] deficiency is also variable, and ranges from normal function, to deficiency of a, to deficiency of both anterior and posterior hormones. It is often unclear if the hypopituitarism is due to a primary pituitary dysfunction or is secondary to a hypothalmic dysfunction. Hypopituitarism in this syndrome is most often manifested by [[growth hormone deficiency]]. If severe, it can lead to diagnosis in the first days of life by causing [[hypoglycemia]], [[jaundice]], and [[micropenis]] (if a boy). The cause of the jaundice is unknown, and an unusual aspect of it (compared to most [[neonatal jaundice]]) is that it can be largely a conjugated (direct) [[hyperbilirubinemia]] suggestive of obstructive [[liver]] disease. It typically resolves over several weeks once hormone replacement is begun. All of the pituitary hormones can be replaced, and this is the treatment for deficiencies. Septo-optic dysplasia is one of the most common forms of congenital growth hormone deficiency.

===Septum pellucidum===
The brain effects are also variable. [[Seizure]]s sometimes occur. Prediction of intellectual outcome in infancy is difficult. Various types of early intervention or equivalent programs can help a child reach full developmental potential.

===Variability===
Septo-optic dysplasia is a highly variable disorder.  It is rare for siblings to present with identical features of the septo-optic dysplasia spectrum.  Many patients present with additional developmental defects outside the Septo-optic dysplasia triad.  In particular digital defects are common.

==Causes==
Septo-optic dysplasia is a developmental disorder resulting from a defect of normal embryological development. There is no single cause of septo-optic dysplasia. Septo-optic dysplasia has been linked to young maternal age.<ref name="pmid17148560">{{cite journal |unused_data=pmid17148560 |author=McNay DE, Turton JP, Kelberman D, ''et al.'' |title=HESX1 mutations are an uncommon cause of septo-optic dysplasia and hypopituitarism |journal= J Clin Endocrinol Metab. |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=691–7 |year=2006  |doi=10.1210/jc.2006-1609 |pmid=17148560}}</ref>

=== Genetic ===

Rare familial recurrence has been reported, suggesting at least one [[genetic disease|genetic]] form ([[HESX1]]).<ref name="pmid9620767">{{cite journal |author=Dattani MT, Martinez-Barbera JP, Thomas PQ, ''et al.'' |title=Mutations in the homeobox gene HESX1/Hesx1 associated with septo-optic dysplasia in human and mouse |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125–33 |year=1998 |pmid=9620767 |doi=10.1038/477}}</ref> In addition, mutations of the neuronal guidance cue netrin and of its receptor DCC have been implicated in De Morsier's syndrome (Serafini et al. 1996, Fazeli et al. 1997, Deiner et al. 1997), but in most cases SOD is a sporadic birth defect of unknown cause and does not recur with subsequent pregnancies.

===Valproate toxicity===

{{See|Sodium valproate}}
[[Valproate]] toxicity ''[[in utero]]'' has been implicated as a possible etiology of septo-optic dysplasia.<ref>Jerome F. Strauss and Robert L. Barbieri (eds), "Yen and Jaffe's reproductive endocrinology; physiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management", 6th ed, 2009, p. 421.</ref>
