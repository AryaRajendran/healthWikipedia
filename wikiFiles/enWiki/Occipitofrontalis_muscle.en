The '''occipitofrontalis''' or '''epicranius''' is a [[muscle]] which covers parts of the [[human skull|skull]].  It consists of two parts or bellies: The occipital belly, near the [[occipital bone]], and the frontal belly, near the [[frontal bone]].

Some sources consider the occipitofrontalis to be a structure consisting of two distinct muscles, the [[Frontalis muscle|frontalis]] and the [[Occipitalis muscle|occipitalis]]. However, [[Terminologia Anatomica]] currently classifies it as a single muscle, and also includes the [[temporoparietalis muscle]] as part of the epicranius.

== Course ==
{{Main|occipitalis muscle|frontalis muscle}}
The occipital belly originates on the lateral two-thirds of the [[superior nuchal line]] of the [[occipital bone]], and on the [[mastoid process]] of the [[temporal bone]].  Inserted into the [[galea aponeurotica]], or epicranial aponeurosis, the occipital belly communicates with the frontal belly by an intermediate tendon.  From the aponeurosis, the frontal belly is inserted in the [[fascia]] of the [[facial muscles]] and in the skin above the eyes and nose.<ref name="Stone-26">Stone, 2000, p 26</ref>

== Action ==
Assisted by the occipital belly, the frontal belly draws the [[scalp]] back which raises the [[eyebrow]]s and wrinkles the [[forehead]].<ref name="Stone-26" />

== Evolution ==
In humans, the occipitofrontalis only serves for facial expressions.  In apes, however, the head is not balanced on the [[vertebral column]], and apes therefore need strong muscles that pull back on the skull and prominent [[supraorbital ridge]]s for the attachment of these muscles.<ref name="Saladin-286-287">Saladin, 2003, pp 286-287</ref>
