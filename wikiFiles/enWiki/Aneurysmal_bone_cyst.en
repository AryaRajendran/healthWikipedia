'''Aneurysmal bone cyst''', abbreviated '''ABC''', is a [[benign]] [[osteolytic]] [[bone]] [[neoplasm]] characterized by several spong-like blood or serum filled, generally non-[[endothelium|endothelialized]] spaces of various diameters.<ref name=sd>{{cite book|last=Maroldi|first=Roberto|title=Imaging in Treatment Planning for Sinonasal Diseases|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540266310|pages=114}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
The term is a misnomer, as the lesion is neither an [[aneurysm]] nor a [[cyst]].<ref name=sd /> 

== Causes ==
Aneurysmal bone cyst has been widely regarded a reactive process of uncertain etiology since its initial description by Jaffe and Lichtenstein in 1942. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the etiology and pathogenesis of aneurysmal bone cyst, and until very recently the most commonly accepted idea was that aneurysmal bone cyst was the consequence of an increased venous pressure and resultant dilation and rupture of the local vascular network. However, studies by Panoutsakopoulus ''et al.'' and Oliveira ''et al.'' uncovered the clonal neoplastic nature of aneurysmal bone cyst. Primary etiology has been regarded arteriovenous fistula within bone.<ref name=ped>{{cite book|title=Pediatric Orthopedics in Practice|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540699644|pages=151-155}}</ref>

The lesion may arise de novo or may arise secondarily within a pre-existing bone tumor, this is because of the abnormal bones changes in [[hemodynamics]].  An aneurysmal bone cyst can arise from a pre-existing [[chondroblastoma]], a [[chondromyxoid fibroma]], an [[osteoblastoma]], a [[Giant cell tumor of bone|giant cell tumor]], or [[fibrous dysplasia]].  A giant cell tumor is the most common cause, occurring in 19% to 39% of cases. Less frequently, it results from some [[malignant]] tumors, such as [[osteosarcoma]], [[chondrosarcoma]], and [[hemangioendothelioma]].

Histologically, they are classified in two variants. 
* The classic (or standard) form (95%) has blood filled clefts among bony trabeculae. [[Osteoid]] tissue is found in stromal matrix. 
* The solid form (5%) shows [[fibroblast]]ic proliferation, osteoid production and degenerated calcifying fibromyxoid elements.

According to Buraczewski and Dabska, the development of the aneurysmal bone cyst follows three stages.<ref name=sd />
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage !! Description
|-
| Initial phase (I)|| [[Osteolysis]] without peculiar findings
|-
| Growth phase (II)|| 
* Rapid increase in size of osseous erosion
* Enlargement of involved bone
* Formation of shell around central part of lesion
|-
| Stabilization phase (III)|| Fully developed radiological pattern

They can also be associated with a ''TRE17''/''[[USP6]]'' translocation.<ref name="pmid20418905">{{cite journal |author=Ye Y, Pringle LM, Lau AW, ''et al.'' |title=TRE17/USP6 oncogene translocated in aneurysmal bone cyst induces matrix metalloproteinase production via activation of NF-kappaB |journal=Oncogene |volume=29 |issue=25 |pages=3619–29 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20418905 |pmc=2892027 |doi=10.1038/onc.2010.116 }}</ref>

Aneurysmal bone cysts may be intraosseous, staying inside of the bone marrow.  Or they may be extraosseous, developing on the surface of the bone, and extending into the marrow.

== Clinical features ==
The afflicted may have relatively small amounts of pain that will quickly increase in severity over a time period of 6–12 weeks.  The skin temperature around the bone may increase, a bony swelling may be evident, and movement may be restricted in adjacent joints.<ref name=TMJ>{{cite journal |author=Zadik, Yehuda; Aktaş Alper; Drucker Scott; Nitzan W Dorrit |title=Aneurysmal bone cyst of mandibular condyle: A case report and review of the literature |journal=J Craniomaxillofac Surg |volume=40 |issue= |pages= |year=2012 |month= |pmid=22118925 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010518211002551|doi=10.1016/j.jcms.2011.10.026}}</ref>

Spinal [[lesions]] may cause [[quadriplegia]] and patients with skull lesions may have headaches.
=== Sites ===

Commonly affected sites are [[metaphyses]] of [[vertebra]], [[flat bones]], [[femur]] and [[tibia]].<ref name=rosai>{{cite book|title=Rosai and Ackerman's surgical pathology, Volume 2, 9th ed|year=2004|publisher=Mosby|isbn=9780323013420|pages=148}}</ref>   Approximate percentages by sites are as shown:
* Skull and mandible (4%)
* Spine (16%)
* Clavicle and ribs (5%)
* Upper extremity (21%)
* Pelvis and sacrum (12%)
* Femur (13%)
* Lower leg (24%)
* Foot (3%)

==Diagnosis==
On a radiograph, well-defined, expansile, lytic lesion is observed. Expansion of cortex gives the lesion a balloon-like appearance. Larger lesions may appear septated<ref name=who>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Arthur|title=Who Manual Of Diagnostic Imaging: Radiographic Anatomy And Interpretation Of The Muskuloskeletal System, VOlume|year=2002|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9241545550|pages=168-186}}</ref>
===Differential diagnosis===
Following conditions are excluded before diagnosis can be confirmed:<ref name=ddsp>{{cite book|title=Differential Diagnosis in Surgical Pathology: Expert Consult - Online and Print, 2e|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9781416045809|pages=878-879}}</ref> 

* Unicameral bone cyst
* Giant cell tumor
* Telangiectatic osteosarcoma
* Secondary aneurysmal bone cyst

==Treatment==
[[Curettage]] is performed on some patients,<ref name="pmid16170183">{{cite journal |author=Mankin HJ, Hornicek FJ, Ortiz-Cruz E, Villafuerte J, Gebhardt MC |title=Aneurysmal bone cyst: a review of 150 patients |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=23 |issue=27 |pages=6756–62 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16170183 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2005.15.255 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16170183}}</ref> and is sufficient for inactive lesions. The recurrence rate with curettage is significant in active lesions, and marginal resection has been advised. [[Liquid nitrogen]], [[phenol]], [[methyl methacrylate]] are considered for use to kill cells at margins of resected cyst.<ref name=ped />

==Prognosis==
Recurrence rate of solid form of tumour is lower than classic form.<ref name=ped />

==Epidemiology==
It is common in age group of 10-30 years.<ref name=who /> It is second most common tumor of spine and commonest benign tumor of pelvis in [[pediatric]] population.<ref name=ped /> Incidence is slightly more in males than females (1.3:1).<ref name=ddsp />
