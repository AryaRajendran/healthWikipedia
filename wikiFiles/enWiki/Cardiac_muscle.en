'''Cardiac muscle''' (heart muscle) is a type of involuntary [[striated muscle]] found in the walls and histological foundation of the [[heart]], specifically the [[wikt:myocardium|myocardium]]. Cardiac muscle is one of three major types of muscle, the others being [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[smooth muscle]]. These three types of muscle all form in a process known as [[myogenesis]].  The cells that comprise cardiac muscle, called '''cardiomyocytes''' or '''[[myocardiocyte]]s''', only contain one, unique nucleus.<ref>Pollard, Thomas D. and Earnshaw, William. C., "Cell Biology". Philadelphia: Saunders. 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Olivetti G, Cigola E, Maestri R, ''et al.'' |title=Aging, cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic cardiomyopathy do not affect the proportion of mononucleated and multinucleated myocytes in the human heart |journal=J. M```ol. Cell. Cardiol. |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=1463–77 |year=1996 |month=July |pmid=8841934 |doi=10.1006/jmcc.1996.0137 |url=}}</ref>
Coordinated [[muscular contraction|contractions]] of cardiac muscle cells in the heart propel [[blood]] out of the [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] to the blood vessels of the left/body/systemic and right/lungs/pulmonary [[circulatory system]]s. This complex of actions makes up the [[systole (medicine)|systole]] of the heart. 

Cardiac muscle cells, like all tissues in the body, rely on an ample blood supply to deliver oxygen and nutrients and to remove waste products such as [[carbon dioxide]]. The [[coronary arteries]] fulfill this function.

==Metabolism==

Cardiac muscle is adapted to be highly resistant to [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]: it has a large number of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], enabling continuous [[aerobic respiration]] via [[oxidative phosphorylation]], numerous [[myoglobin]]s ([[oxygen]]-storing pigment) and a good blood supply, which provides nutrients and oxygen. The heart is so tuned to aerobic metabolism that it is unable to pump sufficiently in [[ischaemia|ischaemic]] conditions. At [[basal metabolic rate]]s, about 1% of energy is derived from [[anaerobic metabolism]]. This can increase to 10% under moderately [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] conditions, but, under more severe hypoxic conditions, not enough energy can be liberated by [[Lactic acid#Exercise and lactate|lactate production]] to sustain [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] contractions.<ref>Ganong, Review of Medical Physiology, 22nd Edition.Specialized form of muscle that is peculiar to the vertebrate heart.p81</ref>

Under basal aerobic conditions, 60% of energy comes from [[fat]] (free [[fatty acids]] and [[triglycerides]]), 35% from [[carbohydrates]] (primarily as [[glucose]]), and 5% from [[amino acids]] and [[ketone bodies]]. However, these proportions vary widely according to nutritional state. For example, during [[starvation]], lactate can be recycled by the heart. This is very energy efficient, because one [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]] is reduced to NADH and H<sup>+</sup> (equal to 2.5 or 3 ATP) when lactate is oxidized to [[pyruvate]], which can then be burned aerobically in the TCA cycle, liberating much more energy (ca 14 ATP per cycle).

In the condition of [[diabetes]], more fat and less carbohydrate is used due to the reduced induction of [[GLUT4]] glucose transporters to the cell surfaces. However, contraction itself plays a part in bringing GLUT4 transporters to the surface.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lund S, Holman GD, Schmitz O, Pedersen O |title=Contraction stimulates translocation of glucose transporter GLUT4 in skeletal muscle through a mechanism distinct from that of insulin |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=92 |issue=13 |pages=5817–21 |year=1995 |month=June |pmid=7597034 |pmc=41592 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7597034}}</ref> This is true of skeletal muscle as well, but relevant in particular to cardiac muscle due to its continuous contractions.

==Appearance==

===Striation===

Cardiac muscle exhibits cross striations formed by alternating segments of [[myosin|thick]] and [[actin|thin]] [[myofibrils|protein filaments]]. Like skeletal muscle, the primary structural proteins of cardiac muscle are actin and myosin. The actin filaments are thin causing the lighter appearance of the [[sarcomere|I bands]] in striated muscle, while the myosin filament is thicker lending a darker appearance to the alternating [[sarcomere|A bands]] as observed with [[electron microscopy]]. However, in contrast to skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells may be branched instead of linear and longitudinal.

===T-Tubules===
Another histological difference between cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle is that the [[T-tubules]] in the cardiac muscle are larger, broader and run along the Z-Discs.  There are fewer T-tubules in comparison with skeletal muscle.  Additionally, cardiac muscle forms diads instead of the triads formed between the T-tubules and the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] in skeletal muscle. T-tubules play critical role in [[excitation-contraction coupling]] (ECC). Recently, the action potentials of T-tubules were recorded optically by Guixue Bu et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bu G, Adams H, Berbari EJ, Rubart M |title=Uniform action potential repolarization within the sarcolemma of in situ ventricular cardiomyocytes |journal=Biophys. J. |volume=96 |issue=6 |pages=2532–46 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19289075 |pmc=2907679 |doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2008.12.3896 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-3495(09)00313-0}}</ref>

===Intercalated discs===
{{main|intercalated disc}}
Intercalated discs (IDs) are complex adhering structures which connect single cardiac [[myocytes]] to an electrochemical [[syncytium]] (in contrast to the skeletal muscle, which becomes a multicellular syncytium during mammalian embryonic development) and are mainly responsible for force transmission during muscle contraction. Intercalated discs also support the rapid spread of [[action potentials]] and the synchronized contraction of the myocardium. IDs are described to consist of three different types of cell-cell junctions: the actin filament anchoring [[adherens junctions]] ([[fascia adherens]]), the intermediate filament anchoring [[desmosomes]] (macula adherens) and [[gap junctions]]. Gap junctions are responsible for electrochemical and metabolic coupling. They allow action potentials to spread between cardiac cells by permitting the passage of ions between cells, producing depolarization of the heart muscle. However, novel molecular biological and comprehensive studies unequivocally showed that IDs consist for the most part of mixed type adhering junctions named ''[[area composita]]'' (pl. ''areae compositae'') representing an amalgamation of typical desmosomal and ''fascia adhaerens'' proteins (in contrast to various epithelia).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Franke WW, Borrmann CM, Grund C, Pieperhoff S |title=The area composita of adhering junctions connecting heart muscle cells of vertebrates.

Under [[light microscopy]], intercalated discs appear as thin, typically dark-staining lines dividing adjacent cardiac muscle cells. The intercalated discs run perpendicular to the direction of muscle fibers. Under electron microscopy, an intercalated disc's path appears more complex. At low magnification, this may appear as a convoluted electron dense structure overlying the location of the obscured Z-line. At high magnification, the intercalated disc's path appears even more convoluted, with both longitudinal and transverse areas appearing in longitudinal section.<ref>{{BUHistology|22501loa}}</ref>

==Role of calcium in contraction==
In contrast to [[skeletal muscle]], cardiac muscle requires ''extracellular calcium ions'' for contraction to occur. Like skeletal muscle, the initiation and upshoot of the [[action potential]] in ventricular muscle cells is derived from the entry of sodium ions across the [[sarcolemma]] in a regenerative process. However, an inward flux of extracellular calcium ions through [[L-type calcium channel]]s sustains the depolarization of cardiac muscle cells for a longer duration. The reason for the [[calcium]] dependence is due to the mechanism of [[calcium-induced calcium release]] (CICR) from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] that must occur under normal excitation-contraction (EC) coupling to cause contraction. Once the intracellular concentration of calcium increases, calcium ions bind to the protein [[troponin]], which initiate extracellular fluid and intracellular stores, and [[skeletal muscle]], which is only activated by calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

==Regeneration of heart muscle cells==
Until recently, it was commonly believed that cardiac muscle cells could not be regenerated. However, a study reported in the April 3, 2009 issue of ''Science'' contradicts that belief.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bergmann O, Bhardwaj RD, Bernard S, ''et al.'' |title=Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5923 |pages=98–102 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19342590 |pmc=2991140 |doi=10.1126/science.1164680 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19342590}}</ref>  Olaf Bergmann and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in [[Stockholm]] tested samples of heart muscle from people born before 1955 when nuclear bomb testing caused elevated levels of radioactive [[carbon 14]] in the Earth's atmosphere.  They found that samples from people born before 1955 did have elevated carbon 14 in their heart muscle cell DNA, indicating that the cells had divided after the person's birth.  By using DNA samples from many hearts, the researchers estimated that a 20-year-old renews about 1% of heart muscle cells per year and about 45 percent of the heart muscle cells of a 50-year-old were generated after he or she was born.
