'''mHealth''' (also written as '''m-health''' or '''mobile health''') is a term used for the practice of medicine and public health, supported by mobile devices. The term is most commonly used in reference to using mobile communication devices, such as [[mobile phones]], tablet computers and [[PDA]]s, for [[health services]] and information, but also to affect emotional states.<ref name="Cipresso 23–30">{{cite journal |last=Cipresso |first=P. |coauthors=Serino S., Villani D., Repetto C., Selitti L., Albani G., Mauro A., Gaggioli A., Riva G. |title=Is your phone so smart to affect your states?

While mHealth certainly has application for [[industrialized nations]], the field has emerged in recent years as largely an application for [[developing countries]], stemming from the rapid rise of mobile phone penetration in low-income nations. The field, then, largely emerges as a means of providing greater access to larger segments of a population in developing countries, as well as improving the capacity of health systems in such countries to provide quality healthcare.

Within the mHealth space, projects operate with a variety of objectives, including increased access to healthcare and health-related information (particularly for hard-to-reach populations); improved ability to [[diagnose]] and track diseases; timelier, more actionable [[public health]] information; and expanded access to ongoing medical education and training for health workers.<ref name=v/>

According to the analyst firm Berg Insight, around 2.8 million patients worldwide were using a home monitoring service based on equipment with integrated connectivity at the end of 2012. The figure does not include patients that use monitoring devices connected to a PC or mobile phone. It only includes systems that rely on monitors with integrated connectivity or systems that use monitoring hubs with integrated cellular or fixed-line modems. Berg Insight forecasts that the number of home monitoring systems with integrated communication capabilities will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.9 percent between 2011 and 2017 reaching 9.4 million connections globally by the end of the forecast period. The number of these devices that have integrated cellular connectivity increased from 0.73 million in 2011 to about 1.03 million in 2012, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 46.3 percent to 7.10 million in 2017.<ref>mHealth and Home Monitoring by Berg Insight</ref>

Mobile eHealth or mHealth broadly encompasses the use of [[mobile telecommunication]] and multimedia technologies as they are integrated within increasingly mobile and wireless health care delivery systems.The field broadly encompasses the use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies in health care delivery. The term mHealth was coined by Professor Robert Istepanian as use of "emerging mobile communications and network technologies for healthcare".<ref name=mhealthbook>{{cite book

While there are some projects that are considered solely within the field of mHealth, the linkage between mHealth and eHealth is unquestionable. For example, an mHealth project that uses mobile phones to access data on [[HIV/AIDS]] rates would require an eHealth system in order to manage, store, and assess the data. Thus, eHealth projects many times operate as the backbone of mHealth projects.<ref name=v/>

In a similar vein, while not clearly bifurcated by such a definition, eHealth can largely be viewed as technology that supports the functions and delivery of healthcare, while mHealth rests largely on providing healthcare access.<ref name="caroltorgan1"/> Because mHealth is by definition based on mobile technology such as smartphones, healthcare, through information and delivery, can better reach areas, people, and/or healthcare practitioners with previously limited exposure to certain aspects of healthcare.

== Motivation of mHealth ==
Mobile Health is one aspect of eHealth that is pushing the limits of how to acquire, transport, store, process, and secure the raw and processed data to deliver meaningful results. mHealth offers the ability of remote individuals to participate in the health care value matrix, which may not have been possible in the past. Participation does not imply just consumption of health care services. In many cases remote users are valuable contributors to gather data regarding disease and public health concerns such as outdoor pollution, drugs and violence.

The motivation behind the development of the mHealth field arises from two factors. The first factor concerns the myriad constraints felt by healthcare systems of developing nations. These constraints include high [[population growth]], a high [[burden of disease]] prevalence,<ref>''[[#WHO2004GBD|The Global Burden of Disease 2004 Update]]'' 2008</ref> low health care workforce, large numbers of rural inhabitants, and limited financial resources to support healthcare infrastructure and [[health information systems]]. The second factor is the recent rapid rise in mobile phone penetration in developing countries to large segments of the healthcare workforce, as well as the population of a country as a whole.<ref>[http://www.cellular-news.com/story/29824.php Global Mobile Phone Subscribers to Reach 4.5 Billion by 2012]. Cellular-news.com. 4/1/2010</ref> With greater access to mobile phones to all segments of a country, including rural areas, the potential of lowering information and transaction costs in order to deliver healthcare improves.

The combination of these two factors have motivated much discussion of how greater access to mobile phone technology can be leveraged to mitigate the numerous pressures faced by developing countries' healthcare systems. Both factors are discussed here.

Middle income and especially low-income countries face a plethora of constraints in their healthcare systems. These countries face a severe lack of human and physical resources, as well as some of the largest burdens of disease, [[extreme poverty]], and large [[population growth]] rates. Additionally, healthcare access to all reaches of society is generally low in these countries.

According to a [[World health organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) report from June 2011, higher-income countries show more mHealth activity than do lower-income countries (as consistent with eHealth trends in general). Countries in the European Region are currently the most active and those in the African Region the least active. The WHO report findings also included that mHealth is most easily incorporated into processes and services that historically use voice communication through conventional telephone networks. The report [http://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_mhealth_web.pdf] was the result of a mHealth survey module designed by researchers at the Earth Institute's [http://cghed.ei.columbia.edu/ Center for Global Health and Economic Development], Columbia University.

The WHO notes an extreme deficit within the [[Health Human Resources|global healthcare workforce]]. The WHO notes critical healthcare workforce shortages in 57 countries—most of which are characterized as developing countries—and a global deficit of 2.4 million doctors, nurses, and midwives.<ref>World Health Organization, The World Health Report 2006: Working Together for Health. 2006, WHO: Geneva.</ref> The WHO, in a study of the healthcare workforce in 12 countries of Africa, finds an average density of physicians, nurses and midwives per 1000 population of 0.64.<ref>Kinfu, Y., Dal Poz, M., Mercer, H., Evans, D.B., [http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/3/08-051599-table-T3.html The health worker shortage in Africa: are enough physicians and nurses being trained?] ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'', Vol. 87, No. 3, March 2009, 225-230</ref> The density of the same metric is four times as high in the United States, at 2.6.<ref>UNData. [http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=WHO&f=inID%3AHSR02 Statistics Physicians density (per 10 000 population)]. WHO Data</ref>

The burden of disease is additionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries than high-income countries. The burden of disease, measured in [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY), which can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age, free of disease and disability, is about five times higher in Africa than in high-income countries.<ref>''[[#WHO2004GBD|The Global Burden of Disease 2004 Update]]'' 2008,</ref> In addition, low- and middle-income countries are forced to face the burdens of both extreme poverty and the growing incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, an effect of new-found (relative) affluence.<ref name=v/>

Considering poor infrastructure and low human resources, the WHO notes that the healthcare workforce in sub-Saharan Africa would need to be scaled up by as much as 140% to attain international health development targets such as those in the [[Millennium Declaration]].<ref name="autogenerated1">Kinfu, Y., Dal Poz, M., Mercer, H., Evans, D.B., [http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/3/08-051599/en/index.html The health worker shortage in Africa: are enough physicians and nurses being trained?] ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'' Vol. 87, No. 3, March 2009, 225–230</ref>

The WHO, in reference to the healtcare condition in sub-saharan Africa, states:
<blockquote>
The problem is so serious that in many instances there is simply not enough human capacity even to absorb, deploy and efficiently use the substantial additional funds that are considered necessary to improve health in these countries.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
</blockquote>

Mobile technology has made a recent and rapid appearance into low- and middle-income nations.<ref>Economist. "The power of mobile money". ''The Economist'' 14 Sept, 2009.</ref> While, in the mHealth field, mobile technology usually refers to mobile phone technology, the entrance of other technologies into these nations to facilitate healthcare are also discussed here.

==== Health and development ====

The link between health and development can be found in three of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), as set forth by the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000. The MDGs that specifically address health include reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV and AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; and increasing access to safe drinking water.<ref>United Nations, United Nations Millennium Declaration (General Assembly Resolution 55/2). 2000, United Nations: New York.</ref> A progress report published in 2006 indicates that childhood immunization and deliveries by skilled birth attendants are on the rise, while many regions continue to struggle to achieve reductions in the prevalence of the diseases of poverty including malaria, HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis.<ref>United Nations, The Millennium Development Goals Report. 2006, United Nations: New York.</ref>

=== Healthcare and mHealth in developed countries ===

In [[developed countries]] or (more developed countries), Healthcare systems  has different policies and goals in relation to the personal and population health care goals.

In US and EU many patients and consumers use their cell phones and tablets to access health information and look for healthcare services. In parallel the number of mHealth applications grew significantly the last years. 

Doctors, nurses and clinicians use mobile devices to access patient information and other databases and resources.

== Technology and Market ==

Basic [[SMS]] functions and real-time voice communication serve as the backbone and the current most common use of mobile phone technology. The broad range of potential benefits to the health sector that the simple functions of mobile phones can provide should not be understated.<ref>Mechael, P. (2006). ''Exploring Health-related Uses of Mobile Phones: An Egyptian Case Study, Public Health & Policy'' (p. 264). London: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</ref>

The appeal of mobile communication technologies is that they enable communication in motion, allowing individuals to contact each other irrespective of time and place.<ref>Agar, J. (2003). ''Constant Touch: A Global History of the Mobile Phone'' Cambridge: Icon Books Ltd.</ref><ref>Ling, R. (2004). ''The mobile connection: The cell phone's impact on society'' London: Morgan Kaufmann</ref> This is particularly beneficial for work in remote areas where the mobile phone, and now increasingly [[wireless infrastructure]], is able to reach more people, faster. As a result of such technological advances, the capacity for improved access to information and two-way communication becomes more available at the point of need.

=== Mobile Phones ===

[[File:Mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants 1997-2007 ITU.png|thumb|250px|Mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants 1997–2007]]
Mobile phones have made a recent and rapid entrance into many parts of the low- and middle-income world, with the global [[Mobile phone penetration rate]] drastically increasing over the last decade. Improvements in [[telecommunications]] technology infrastructure, reduced costs of mobile handsets, and a general increase in non-food [[expenditure]] have influenced this trend. Low- and middle-income countries are utilizing mobile phones as "leapfrog technology" (see [[leapfrogging]]). That is, mobile phones have allowed many developing countries, even those with relatively poor infrastructure, to bypass 20th century [[fixed-line]] technology and jump to modern mobile technology.<ref>Economist. Leaders: The limits of leapfrogging; Technology and development. ''The Economist'': 2008</ref>

The number of global mobile phone [[subscribers]] in 2007 was estimated at 3.1 billion of an estimated [[global population]] of 6.6 billion (47%).<ref>Global Mobile Phone Subscribers to Reach 4.5 Billion by 2012. Cellular-news.com. 4/1/2010 http://www.cellular-news.com/story/29824.php</ref> These figures are expected to grow to 4.5 billion by 2012, or a 64.7% mobile penetration rate. The greatest growth is expected in [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]]. In many countries, the number of mobile phone subscribers has bypassed the number of fixed-line telephones, this is particularly true in developing countries.<ref>ITU (2003). Mobile overtakes fixed: Implications for policy and regulation. Geneva: International Telecommunications Union</ref> Globally, there were 4.1 billion mobile phones in use in December 2008 . See [[List of countries by number of mobile phones in use]].

While mobile phone penetration rates are on the rise, globally, the growth within countries is not generally evenly distributed. In [[India]], for example, while mobile penetration rates have increased markedly, by far the greatest growth rates are found in [[urban areas]]. Mobile penetration, in September 2008, was 66% in urban areas, while only 9.4% in [[rural areas]]. The all India average was 28.2% at the same time.<ref>Kathuria, R, Uppal M., Mamta (2009). An [[econometric analysis]] of the impact of mobile. Case paper in India: The impact of mobile phones. Vodafone Group Plc. The Policy Paper Series. November 2009</ref> So, while mobile phones may have the potential to provide greater healthcare access to a larger portion of a population, there are certainly within-country equity issues to consider.

Mobile phones are spreading because the cost of mobile technology deployment is dropping and people are, on average, getting wealthier in low- and middle-income nations.<ref>[http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/GEPEXT/EXTGEP2007/0,,menuPK:3016160~pagePK:64167702~piPK:64167676~theSitePK:3016125,00.html Global Economic Prospects 2007: Managing the Next Wave of Globalization]. World Bank report.</ref> Vendors, such as [[Nokia]], are developing cheaper infrastructure technologies (CDMA) and cheaper phones (sub $50–100, such as Sun's Java phone). Non-food consumption expenditure is increasing in many parts of the developing world, as [[disposable income]] rises, causing a rapid increase spending on new technology, such as mobile phones. In India, for example, consumers have become and continue to become wealthier. Consumers are shifting their expenditure from necessity to discretionary. For example, on average, 56% of Indian consumers' consumption went towards food in 1995, compared to 42% in 2005. The number is expected to drop to 34% by 2015. That being said, although total share of consumption has declined, total consumption of food and beverages increased 82% from 1985 to 2005, while per-capita consumption of food and beverages increased 24%. Indian consumers are getting wealthier and they are spending more and more, with a greater ability to spend on new technologies.<ref>McKinsey&Company (2007). The 'bird of gold': the rise of India's consumer market. McKinsey Global Institute</ref>

=== Smartphones ===
More advanced mobile phone technologies are enabling the potential for further healthcare delivery. [[Smartphone]] technologies are now in the hands of a large number of physicians and other healthcare workers in low- and middle-income countries. Although far from ubiquitous, the spread of Smartphone technologies opens up doors for mHealth projects such as technology-based diagnosis support, [[remote diagnostics]] and [[telemedicine]], [[web browsing]], [[GPS]] navigation, access to web-based patient information, post-visit patient surveillance, and decentralized [[health management information system]]s (HMIS).

While uptake of Smartphone technology by the medical field has grown in low- and middle-income countries, it is worth noting that the capabilities of mobile phones in low- and middle-income countries has not reached the sophistication of those in high-income countries. The infrastructure that enables web browsing, GPS navigation, and email through Smartphones is not as well developed in much of the low- and middle-income countries.<ref>Mechael, P. (2006). Exploring Health-related Uses of Mobile Phones: An Egyptian Case Study, Public Health & Policy (p. 264). London: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</ref> Increased availability and efficiency in both voice and data-transfer systems in addition to rapid deployment of wireless infrastructure will likely accelerate the deployment of mobile-enabled health systems and services throughout the world.<ref>Istepanian, R. (2004). Introduction to the Special Section on M-Health: Beyond Seamless Mobility and Global Wireless Health-care Connectivity. IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine, 8(4), 405–413.</ref>

=== Other mHealth Technologies ===

Beyond mobile phones, wireless-enabled [[laptops]] and specialized health-related software applications are currently being developed, tested, and marketed for use in the mHealth field. Many of these technologies, while having some application to low- and middle-income nations, are developing primarily in high-income countries. However, with broad advocacy campaigns for [[free and open source software]] (FOSS), applications are beginning to be tailored for and make inroads in low- and middle-income countries.

Some other mHealth technologies include

*Patient monitoring devices
*Mobile [[telemedicine]]/telecare devices
*[[MP3]] players for [[mLearning]]
*Laptop computers
*[[Microcomputers]]
*Data collection software
*Mobile Operating System Technology

'''Mobile Device Operating System Technology'''

Technologies relates to the [[Operating system|Operating Systems]] that orchestrate mobile device hardware while maintaining confidentiality, integrity and availability are required to build trust. This may foster greater adoption of mHealth Technologies and Services, by exploiting lower cost multi purpose mobile devices such as tablets pcs and smart phones. Devices in this class may include Apple's iPad 1&2 and Motorola's Xoom. Operating systems that control these emerging classes of devices include Google's Android, Apple's iPhone OS, Microsoft's Windows Mobile, Nokia Symbian OS and RIM's BlackBerry OS.

Operating Systems must be agile and evolve to effectively balance and deliver the desired level of service to an application and end user, while managing display real estate, power consumption and security posture. As advances in capabilities such as integrating voice, video and Web 2.0 collaboration tools into mobile devices, significant benefits can be achieved in the delivery of health care services. New sensor technologies <ref>{{cite web | title = New sensor technologies | id = {{citeseerx|10.1.1.141.6348}} }}</ref> such as HD video and audio capabilities, accelerometers, GPS, ambient light detectors, barometers and gyroscopes<ref name="Lane 140–150">{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=Nicholas|coauthors=Miluzzo, Emiliano, Lu, Hong, Peebles, Daniel, Choudhury, Tanzeem, Campbell, Andrew|title=A survey of mobile phone sensing|journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|date=NaN undefined NaN|volume=48|issue=9|pages=140–150|doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5560598}}</ref> can enhance the methods of describing and studying cases, close to the patient or consumer of the health care service. This could include diagnosis, education, treatment and monitoring.

'''Air Quality Sensing Technologies'''

Environmental conditions have a significant impact to public health. Per the World Health Organization, outdoor air pollution accounts for about 1.4% of total mortality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ostro|first=Bart|title=Outdoor air pollution : assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels|year=2004|publisher=World Health Organization, Protection of the Human Environment|location=Geneva|isbn=92-4-159146-3|edition=null}}</ref> Utilizing Participatory sensing technologies in mobile telephone, public health research can exploit the wide penetration of mobile devices to collect air measurements,<ref name="Lane 140–150"/> which can be utilized to assess the impact of pollution. Projects such as the [http://www.urban-atmospheres.net/ParticipatoryUrbanism/index.html Urban Atmospheres] are utilizing embedded technologies in mobile phones to acquire real time conditions from millions of user mobile phones. By aggregating this data, public health policy shall be able to craft initiatives to mitigate risk associated with outdoor air pollution.

[[Data]] has become an especially important aspect of mHealth. Data collection requires both the collection device (mobile phones, computer, or portable device) and the software that houses the information. Data is primarily focused on visualizing static text but can also extend to interactive decision support algorithms, other visual image information, and also communication capabilities through the integration of e-mail and SMS features. Integrating use of [[GIS]] and [[GPS]] with mobile technologies adds a geographical mapping component that is able to "tag" voice and data communication to a particular location or series of locations. These combined capabilities have been used for emergency health services as well as for disease surveillance, health facilities and services mapping, and other health-related data collection.

== mHealth and Health Outcomes ==
The mHealth field operates on the premise that technology integration within the health sector has the great potential to promote a better health communication to achieve healthy lifestyles, improve decision-making by health professionals (and patients) and enhance healthcare quality by improving access to medical and health information and facilitating instantaneous communication in places where this was not previously possible.<ref>Shields, T., A. Chetley, and J. Davis, ICT in the health sector: Summary of the online consultation. 2005, infoDev.</ref><ref>World Health Organization, eHealth Tools and Services: Needs of Member States. 2005, WHO: Geneva.</ref> It follows that the increased use of technology can help reduce health care costs by improving efficiencies in the health care system and promoting prevention through [[behavior change communication]] (BCC). The mHealth field also houses the idea that there exists a powerful potential to advance clinical care and public health services by facilitating health professional practice and communication and reducing [[health disparities]] through the use of mobile technology.

The growth of health-related Apps and the availability of mobile device drives the growth of mHealth.In 2010, only about 4,000 health-related app available and now more than 20,000 health-related apps are available for mobile device. Revenues from remote patient monitoring services that use mobile networks will rise to $1.9 billion globally by 2014, according to Juniper Research’s recent report in 2011.

Efforts are ongoing to explore how a broad range of technologies, and most recently mHealth technologies, can improve such health outcomes as well as generate cost savings within the health systems of low- and middle-income countries. In some ways, the potential of mHealth lies in its ability to offer opportunities for direct voice communication (of particular value in areas of poor [[literacy rates]] and limited local language-enable phones) and information transfer capabilities that previous technologies did not have. Overall, mobile communication technologies are tools that can be leveraged to support existing workflows within the health sector and between the health sector and the general public.<ref>Malhotra K, Gardner S, Rees D. (2005). Evaluation of GPRS Enabled Secure Remote Patient Monitoring System. ASMTA 2005, Riga, Latvia, 41–48.</ref>

Within the mHealth space, projects operate with a variety of objectives, as stated by the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation's report on ''mHealth for Development'':

*increased access to healthcare and health-related information (particularly for hard-to-reach populations)
*improved ability to diagnose and track diseases
*timelier, more actionable public health information
*expanded access to ongoing medical education and training for health workers<ref name=v/>

== Applications in the mHealth Field ==

While others exist, the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation<ref name=v/> report presents seven application categories within the mHealth field.

*Education and awareness
*Helpline
*Diagnostic and treatment support
*Communication and training for healthcare workers
*Disease and epidemic outbreak tracking
*Remote monitoring
*Remote data collection

Each application category as well as specific project within the category will be described.

===Education and awareness===
Education and awareness programs within the mHealth field are largely about the spreading of mass information from source to recipient through short message services (SMS). In education and awareness applications, SMS messages are sent directly to users' phones to offer information about various subjects, including testing and treatment methods, availability of health services, and disease management. SMSs provide an advantage of being relatively unobtrusive, offering patients confidentiality in environments where disease (especially HIV/AIDS) is often taboo. Additionally, SMSs provide an avenue to reach far-reaching areas—such as rural areas—which may have limited access to public health information and education, health clinics, and a deficit of healthcare workers.<ref name=v/>

===Helpline===
Helpline typically consists of a specific phone number that any individual is able to call to gain access to a range of medical services. These include phone consultations, counseling, service complaints, and information on facilities, drugs, equipment, and/or available mobile health clinics<ref name=v/>

===Diagnostic support, treatment support, communication and training for healthcare workers===
Diagnostic and treatment support systems are typically designed to provide healthcare workers in remote areas advice about diagnosis and treatment of patients. While some projects may provide mobile phone applications—such as a step-by-step medical decision tree systems—to help healthcare workers diagnosis, other projects provide direct diagnosis to patients themselves. In such cases, known as [[telemedicine]], patients might take a photograph of a wound or illness and allow a remote physician diagnose to help treat the medical problem. Both diagnosis and treatment support projects attempt to mitigate the cost and time of travel for patients located in remote areas<ref name=v/>

mHealth projects within the communication and training for healthcare workers subset involve connecting healthcare workers to sources of information through their mobile phone. This involves connecting healthcare workers to other healthcare workers, medical institutions, ministries of health, or other houses of medical information. Such projects additionally involve using mobile phones to better organize and target in-person training. Improved communication projects attempt to increase knowledge transfer amongst healthcare workers and improve patient outcomes through such programs as patient referral processes<ref name=v/>

===Disease surveillance, remote data collection, and epidemic outbreak tracking===
Projects within this area operate to utilize mobile phones' ability to collect and transmit data quickly, cheaply, and relatively efficiently. Data concerning the location and levels of specific diseases (such as [[malaria]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis|TB]], [[Avian Flu]]) can help medical systems or ministries of health or other organizations identify outbreaks and better target medical resources to areas of greatest need. Such projects can be particularly useful during emergencies, in order to identify where the greatest medical needs are within a country<ref name=v/>

Policymakers and health providers at the national, district, and community level need accurate data in order to gauge the effectiveness of existing policies and programs and shape new ones. In the developing world, collecting field information is particularly difficult since many segments of the population are rarely able to visit a hospital, even in the case of severe illness. A lack of patient data creates an arduous environment in which policy makes can decide where and how to spend their (sometimes limited) resources. While some software within this area is specific to a particular content or area, other software can be adapted to any data collection purpose.

===Treatment support and medication compliance for patients, including chronic disease management===
Remote monitoring and treatment support allows for greater involvement in the continued care of patients. Recent studies seem to show also the efficacy of inducing positive and negative affective states, using smart phones.<ref name="Cipresso 23–30"/> Within environments of limited resources and beds—and subsequently a 'outpatient' culture—remote monitoring allows healthcare workers to better track patient conditions, medication regimen adherence, and follow-up scheduling. Such projects can operate through either one- or two-way communications systems. Remote monitoring has been used particularly in the area of medication adherence for AIDS and [[diabetes]]<ref name=v/>; technical process evaluations have confirmed the feasibility of deploying dynamically tailored, SMS-based interventions designed to provide ongoing behavioral reinforcement for persons living with HIV. <ref>Furberg RD, Uhrig JD, Bann CM, Lewis MA, Harris JL, Williams P, Coomes C, Martin N, Kuhns L.
