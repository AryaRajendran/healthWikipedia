'''Speech-language pathology''' professionals ('''speech-language pathologists''' (SLPs), or informally '''speech therapists''') specialize in [[communication disorders]] as well as [[dysphagia|swallowing disorders]]. 

The main components of [[speech communication|speech]] production include: [[phonation]], the process of sound production; [[resonance]]; [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], the variation of [[pitch (music)|pitch]]; and [[Human voice|voice]], including [[aeromechanics|aeromechanical]] components of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. The main components of [[language]] include: [[phonology]], the manipulation of sound according to the rules of the language; [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], the  understanding and use of the minimal units of meaning; [[syntax]], the [[grammar]] rules for constructing sentences in language; [[semantics]], the interpretation of meaning from the signs or symbols of communication; and [[pragmatics]], the social aspects of communication.<ref>{{citation | first = Frances K. | last = Block | coauthors = Amie Amiot, Cheryl Deconde Johnson; Gina E.

== National approaches to speech and language pathology ==

Speech-language pathology is known by a variety of names in various countries around the world:
*'''Speech-language pathology''' (SLP) in the United States [http://www.asha.org], Canada [http://www.caslpa.ca], Malta [http://www.aslpmalta.org], Italy [http://www.fli.it], and in the Philippines
*'''Speech and language therapy''' (SLT) in the United Kingdom, Ireland [http://www.iaslt.ie/], and South Africa [http://www.saslha.co.za/]. Within the United Kingdom a Speech and Language Therapy team is sometimes referred to as the "SALT" team, to avoid confusion with Senior Leadership Team. S&LT is preferable however, and closer to the official abbreviation SLT used by RCSLT (Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists) [http://www.rcslt.org/].
*'''Speech pathology''' in Australia [http://www.speechpathologyaustralia.org.au], and the Philippines
*'''Speech-language therapy''' in New Zealand
*'''Speech therapy''' in India [http://www.ishaindia.org.in], Hong Kong [http://www.speechtherapy.org.hk/] and other Asian countries.
*'''Speech and language pathologist''' in the Netherlands, the title for graduates from University who can participate in research.
*'''Speech and language therapist (logopedist)''' are educated to give therapy in the Netherlands.

Prior to 2006, the practice of Speech-Language Pathology in the United States was regulated by the individual states. Since January 2006, the 2005 "Standards and Implementation Procedures for the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology" guidelines as set out by The [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) have determined the qualification requirements to obtain "Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship". First, the individual must obtain an undergraduate degree, which may be in a field related to speech-language-hearing sciences.  Second, the individual must graduate from an accredited master's program in speech language pathology.  Many graduate programs will allow coursework not done in undergraduate years to be completed during graduate study.  Various states have different regulations regarding licensure.  The Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) is granted after the clinical fellowship year (CFY) when the individual provides services under the supervision of an experienced and licensed SLP.  After a Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology is awarded. Continuing education is required for maintenance of the Certificate of Clinical Competence, every three years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/slp_standards.htm |title=2005 SLP Standards |work=2005 Standards and Implementation Procedures for the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech-Language Pathology}}</ref> Post master's graduate study for a Speech-Language Pathologist may consist of academic, research, and clinical practice . A doctoral degree (Ph.D or Speech-Language Pathology Doctorate) is currently optional for clinicians wishing to serve the public.

== The Speech-Language Pathology vocation ==

Speech-Language Pathologists provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for individuals, families, support groups, and providing information for the general public.  Speech services begin with initial screening for communication and swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention and treatment, and provision counseling and other follow up services for these disorders.
* cognitive aspects of communication (e.g., attention, memory, problem solving, executive functions).
* speech (i.e., [[phonation]], [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], fluency, resonance, and [[human voice|voice]] including aeromechanical components of respiration);
* language (i.e., [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and pragmatic/social aspects of communication) including comprehension and expression in oral, written, graphic, and manual modalities; [[language processing]]; preliteracy and language-based literacy skills, phonological awareness.
* swallowing or other upper aerodigestive functions such as infant feeding and aeromechanical events (evaluation of esophageal function is for the purpose of referral to medical professionals);
* voice (i.e. hoarseness (dysphonia), poor vocal volume (hypophonia), abnormal (e.g. rough, breathy, strained) vocal quality). Research has been proven to demonstrate voice therapy to be especially helpful with certain patient populations, such as individuals with Parkinson's Disease, who often develop voice issues as a result of their disease.
* sensory awareness related to communication, swallowing, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

=== Multi-discipline collaboration ===

Speech-Language Pathologists collaborate with other health care professionals often working as part of a multidisciplinary team, providing referrals to [[audiologist]]s and others; providing information to health care professionals (including [[physician|doctor]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, and [[dietitian]]s), [[teacher|educators]], and [[parent]]s as dictated by the individual client's needs.

The treatment for patients with [[cleft lip and palate]] has an obvious interdisciplinary character. The speech therapy outcome is even better when the surgical treatment is performed earlier.<ref name="revistaOMF">

=== Working environments ===

Speech-Language Pathologists work in a variety of clinical and educational settings. SLPs work in public and private [[hospital]]s, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities, [[hospice]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pollens R |title=Role of the speech-language pathologist in palliative hospice care |journal=J Palliat Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=694–702 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15588361 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and home healthcare. SLPs may also work as part of the support structure in the education system, working in both public and private [[school]]s, [[college]]s, and universities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/default.aspx?id=288 |title=Speech and language therapist - NHS Careers |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Some speech-language pathologists also work in community health, providing services at prisons and [[youth detention center|young offenders' institutions]] or providing expert testimony in applicable court cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcslt.org/speech_and_language_therapy/what_is_an_slt |title=What is speech and language therapy? }}</ref>

Subsequent to ASHA's 2005 approval of the delivery of Speech-Language Pathology services via video conference, or telepractice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asha.org/telepractice/ |title=ASHA Telepractice Position Statement |publisher=Asha.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}</ref> SLPs have begun delivering services via this service delivery method.

== Methods of assessment ==
{{details|Speech and language assessment}}

Assessment of speech, language, cognition, and swallowing can consist of informal (non-standard or criterion based) assessments, formal standardized tests, instrumental measures, language sample analyses, and oral motor mechanism exam. Informal assessments rely on a clinician's knowledge and experience to evaluate an individual's abilities across areas of concern. Formal standardized testing is used to measure an individuals' abilities against peers. Instrumental measures (e.g., nasometer)utilizes equipment to measure physiological or anatomical impairments (e.g., Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) or Modified Barium Swallow Study (MBS)).
Oral motor assessments review the strength, co-ordination, range of movement, symmetry and speed of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X and XII.  The Australian National Guidelines for Stroke Management state that the presence or absence of a gag reflex in an oro-motor examination is not sufficient evidence to determine if someone has a swallowing disorder.  

Referrals to Speech and Language Pathologists should be made if there are any concerns regarding slow or limited communication development in children, cognition (limited attention, disorganization etc. following by a Traumatic Brain Injury), difficulty with word-finding, errors in speech sound production, or for [[Augmentative and alternative communication|Augmentative Alternative Communication]] needs.

== Clients and patients requiring speech and language pathology services ==
