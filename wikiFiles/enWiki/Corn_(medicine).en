A '''corn''' (or '''clavus''', plural '''clavi''') is a specially shaped [[callus]] of dead skin that usually occurs on thin or [[glabrous]] (hairless and smooth) skin surfaces, especially on the [[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] surface of toes or fingers. They can sometimes occur on the thicker [[palmar]] or [[plantar]] skin surfaces. Corns form when the pressure point against the skin traces an [[ellipse|elliptical]] or semi-elliptical path during the rubbing motion, the center of which is at the point of pressure, gradually widening. If there is constant stimulation of the tissue producing the corns, even after the corn is surgically removed, the skin may continue to grow as a corn.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Presentations==
The hard part at the center of the corn resembles a [[barley]] hare, that is, a funnel with a broad raised top and a pointed bottom. Because of their shape, corns intensify the pressure at the tip and can cause deep tissue damage and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulceration]].<ref name=Silverberg>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1089594-overview eMedicine > Clavus] By Nanette Silverberg. Updated: Apr 9, 2010</ref> Hard corns are especially problematic for people with insensitive skin due to [[diabetes]] etc.  The scientific name for a corn is ''heloma'' (plural ''helomata''). A hard corn is called a ''heloma durum'', while a soft corn is called a ''heloma molle''.

The location of soft corns tends to differ from that of hard corns. Hard corns occur on dry, flat surfaces of skin. Soft corns (frequently found between adjacent toes) stay moist, keeping the surrounding skin soft. The corn's center is not soft, however, but indurated.

==Diagnosis and workup==
To exclude other [[differential diagnoses]], a [[skin biopsy]] may be taken.<ref name=Silverberg/> Imaging studies can be used in order to detect any underlying bony abnormalities that cause abnormal pressure on the overlying skin.<ref name=Silverberg/> For this purpose, a plain [[radiograph]] usually suffices, but, occasionally, [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] is used.<ref name=Silverberg/>

==Treatment==
[[File:Corn after treatment.jpg|thumb|right|A corn after treatment]]
Treatment of corns include paring of the lesions, which immediately reduces pain.<ref name=Silverberg/> However, if an abnormal pressure source remains, the corn generally returns. If the source of any abnormal pressure is detected, this may be avoided, such as with [[orthotics]] and conservative footwear with extra toe space.<ref name=Silverberg/> If no other treatment is effective, surgery may be performed.<ref name=Silverberg/>
