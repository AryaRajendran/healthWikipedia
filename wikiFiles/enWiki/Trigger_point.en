The trigger point model states that unexplained pain frequently radiates from these points of local tenderness to broader areas, sometimes distant from the trigger point itself. Practitioners claim to have identified reliable [[referred pain]] patterns which associate pain in one location with trigger points elsewhere. There is variation in the methodology for [[diagnosis]] of trigger points and a dearth of theory to explain how they arise and why they produce specific patterns of referred pain.<ref name="variability">

Compression of a trigger point may elicit local tenderness, [[referred pain]], or local twitch response. The local twitch response is not the same as a [[muscle spasm]]. This is because a muscle spasm refers to the entire muscle contracting whereas the local twitch response also refers to the entire muscle but only involves a small twitch, no contraction.

Among [[physician|MD]]s, many specialists are well versed in trigger point diagnosis and therapy. These include [[physiatrist]]s (physicians specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation), family medicine, and orthopedics.  [[Osteopath]]ic as well as chiropractic schools, however, include trigger points in their training.<ref name="McPartland JM, 2004 244–49">{{cite journal |author=McPartland JM, |title=Travell trigger points--molecular and osteopathic perspectives |journal=Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=104 |issue=6 |pages=244–49 |year=2004 |month=June |url=http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/content/full/104/6/244 |pmid=15233331}}</ref>   Other health professionals, such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, acupuncturists, massage therapists and structural integrators are also aware of these ideas and many of them make use of trigger points in their clinical work as well.<ref name="Alvarez DJ, Rockwell PG 2002 653–60">{{cite journal |author=Alvarez DJ, Rockwell PG |title=Trigger points: diagnosis and management |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=653–60 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11871683 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020215/653.html}}</ref><ref name="Dynamic Chiropractic">[http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/09/24/10.html Dynamic Chiropractic]</ref>

==Definition==

The term "trigger point" was coined in 1942 by [[Janet G. Travell|Dr. Janet Travell]] to describe a clinical finding with the following characteristics:

* Pain related to a discrete, irritable point in skeletal muscle or [[fascia]], not caused by acute local [[physical trauma|trauma]], [[inflammation]], [[degeneration (medical)|degeneration]], [[neoplasm]] or [[infection]].
* The painful point can be felt as a nodule or band in the muscle, and a twitch response can be elicited on stimulation of the trigger point.
* [[Palpation]] of the trigger point reproduces the patient's complaint of pain, and the pain radiates in a distribution typical of the specific muscle harboring the trigger point.
* The pain cannot be explained by findings on [[neurological examination]].

Practitioners do not necessarily agree on what constitutes a trigger point.

A 2007 review of diagnostic criteria used in studies of trigger points concluded that
:''there is as yet limited consensus on case definition in respect of MTrP pain syndrome. Further research is needed to test the reliability and validity of diagnostic criteria. Until reliable diagnostic criteria have been established, there is a need for greater transparency in research papers on how a case of MTrP pain syndrome is defined, and claims for effective interventions in treating the condition should be viewed with caution.''<ref name="variability"/>

==Myofascial pain syndrome==
The main innovation of Travell's work was the introduction of the [[myofascial pain syndrome]] concept (''myofascial'' referring to the combination of [[muscle]] and [[fascia]]). This is described as a focal hyperirritability in muscle that can strongly modulate [[central nervous system]] functions.  Travell and followers distinguish this from [[fibromyalgia]], which is characterized by widespread pain and tenderness and is described as a central augmentation of [[nociception]] giving rise to deep tissue tenderness that includes muscles.
Studies estimate that in 75–95 percent of cases, myofascial pain is a primary cause of regional pain. Myofascial pain is associated with muscle tenderness that arises from trigger points, focal points of tenderness, a few millimeters in diameter, found at multiple sites in a muscle and the fascia of muscle tissue. Biopsy tests found that trigger points were hyperirritable and electrically active [[muscle spindle]]s in general muscle tissue.<ref>{{cite journal

==Qualities of trigger points==
Trigger points have a number of qualities. They may be classified as potential, active/latent and also as key/satellites and primary/secondary.

There are a few more than 620 potential trigger points possible in human muscles.  These trigger points, when they become active or latent, show up in the same places in muscles in every person.  That is, trigger point maps can be made that are accurate for everyone.

An '''active trigger point''' is one that actively refers pain either locally or to another location (most trigger points refer pain elsewhere in the body along nerve pathways). A '''latent trigger''' point is one that exists, but does not yet refer pain actively, but may do so when pressure or strain is applied to the myoskeletal structure containing the trigger point. Latent trigger points can influence muscle activation patterns, which can result in poorer muscle coordination and balance. Active and latent trigger points are also known as "Yipe" points, for obvious reasons.

A '''key trigger point''' is one that has a pain referral pattern along a nerve pathway that activates a latent trigger point on the pathway, or creates it. A '''satellite trigger point''' is one which is activated by a key trigger point. Successfully treating the key trigger point will often resolve the satellite, either converting it from being active to latent or completely treating it.

In contrast, a '''primary trigger point''' in many cases will biomechanically activate a '''secondary trigger point''' in another structure. Treating the primary trigger point does not treat the secondary trigger point.

===Potential causes of trigger points===

Activation of trigger points may be caused by a number of factors, including acute or chronic muscle overload, activation by other trigger points (key/satellite, primary/secondary), disease, psychological distress (via systemic [[inflammation]]), [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] imbalances, direct trauma to the region, collision trauma (such as a car crash which stresses many muscles and causes instant trigger points) [[radiculopathy]], infections and health issues such as [[smoking]].

Trigger points form only in muscles.  They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle.  These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles. The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers.  These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region.  This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive (pain) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction (Travell and Simons 1999).
When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures. These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the causative pain factor. Many trigger points have pain patterns that overlap, and some create reciprocal cyclic relationships that need to be treated extensively to remove them.

===Diagnosis of trigger points===
Trigger points are diagnosed by examining signs, symptoms, pain patterns and manual palpation.
A 2009 review of nine studies examining the reliability of trigger point diagnosis found that physical examination could not be recommended as reliable for the diagnosis of trigger points.<ref>{{cite journal

Usually there is a taut band in muscles containing trigger points, and a hard nodule can be felt. Often a twitch response can be felt in the muscle by running your finger perpendicular to the muscle's direction; this twitch response often activates the "all or nothing" response in a muscle that causes it to contract. Pressing on an affected muscle can often refer pain. Clusters of trigger points are not uncommon in some of the larger muscles, such as the gluteus group ([[gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]], [[gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]], and [[gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]). Often there is a heat differential in the local area of a trigger point, and many practitioners can sense that.  In 2007, a paper was presented describing images of trigger points taken by modified MRI.<ref name="pmid18047882">{{cite journal

===Misdiagnosis of pain===
The misdiagnosis of pain is the most important issue taken up by Travell and Simons. Referred pain from trigger points mimics the symptoms of a very long list of common maladies, but physicians, in weighing all the possible causes for a given condition, rarely consider a myofascial source. The study of trigger points has not historically been part of medical education. Travell and Simons hold that most of the common everyday pain is caused by myofascial trigger points and that ignorance of that basic concept could inevitably lead to false diagnoses and the ultimate failure to deal effectively with pain.<ref name="Davies">{{cite book

===Demonstration and identification of myofascial trigger points===
A 2008 review in ''Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation'' of two recent studies concludes they present groundbreaking findings that can reduce some of the controversy surrounding the cause and identification of myofascial trigger points (MTPs).<ref name=PubMed.gov>{{cite journal|last=Myburgh|first=C|coauthors=Larsen AH, Hartvigsen J.|title=A systematic, critical review of manual palpation for identifying myofascial trigger points: evidence and clinical significance|journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil.|year=2008|volume=89|issue=6|pages=1169–76|pmid=18503816|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=2008%20review%20Archives%20of%20Physical%20Medicine%20and%20Rehabilitation%20myofascial%20trigger%20point|accessdate=7/23/2012|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.12.033}}</ref>  The study by Chen on the use of [[magnetic resonance elastography]] (MRE) imaging of the taut band of an MTP in an upper [[trapezius muscle]] may present a convincing demonstration of the cause of MTP symptoms. MRE is a modification of existing [[magnetic resonance imaging]] equipment to image stress produced by adjacent tissues with different degrees of tension. This report presents an MRE image of the taut band that shows the V-shaped signature of the increased tension compared with surrounding tissues.<ref name="pmid18164347">{{cite journal |author=Simons DG |title=New views of myofascial trigger points: etiology and diagnosis |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=157–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18164347 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.016}}</ref> Results were all consistent with the concept that taut bands are detectable and quantifiable with MRE imaging. The findings in the subjects suggest that the stiffness of the taut bands in patients with myofascial pain may be 50% greater than that of the surrounding muscle tissue. The findings suggest that MRE can quantitate asymmetries in muscle tone that could previously only be identified subjectively by examination.<ref name="pmid18047882" />

In the study by Shah and associates, they have shown the feasibility of continuous, in vivo recovery of small molecules from soft tissue without harmful effects. With this technique, they have been able to investigate the biochemical milieu of muscle in subjects with active, latent, or absent myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) and to contrast this with that of the noninvolved muscle.<ref name="pmid18164325">{{cite journal |author=Shah JP, Danoff JV, Desai MJ, ''et al.'' |title=Biochemicals associated with pain and inflammation are elevated in sites near to and remote from active myofascial trigger points |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=16–23 |year=2008 |pmid=18164325 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.10.018}}</ref>

==Treatment==

MTP therapists may use [[myotherapy]] (deep pressure as in [[Bonnie Prudden]]'s approach, [[massage]] or [[tapotement]] as in Dr. Griner's approach), mechanical [[vibration]], pulsed [[ultrasound]], [[electrostimulation]],<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.amjphysmedrehab.com/pt/re/ajpmr/abstract.00002060-199711000-00007.htm |title=The immediate effectiveness of electrical nerve stimulation and electrical muscle stimulation on myofascial trigger points |journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=471–6 |month=November–December |year=1997 |pmid=9431265 |author=Hsueh TC, Cheng PT, Kuan TS, Hong CZ |doi=10.1097/00002060-199711000-00007}}</ref> [[ischemic compression]], injection (see below), [[Dry needling|dry-needling]], "spray-and-stretch" using a cooling (vapocoolant) spray, [[Low level laser therapy|Low Level Laser Therapy]] and [[stretching]] techniques that invoke reciprocal inhibition within the musculoskeletal system. Practitioners use elbows, feet or various tools to direct pressure directly upon the trigger point, to save their hands.

A successful treatment protocol relies on identifying trigger points, resolving them and, if all trigger points have been deactivated, elongating the structures affected along their natural range of motion and length. In the case of muscles, which is where most treatment occurs, this involves stretching the muscle using combinations of passive, active, [[Active Isolated Stretching|active isolated]] (AIS), [[muscle energy technique]]s (MET), and [[PNF stretching|proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation]] (PNF) stretching to be effective. [[Fascia]] surrounding muscles should also be treated, possibly with [[Myofascial Release|myofascial release]], to elongate and resolve strain patterns, otherwise muscles will simply be returned to positions where trigger points are likely to re-develop.

The results of manual therapy are related to the skill level of the therapist. If trigger points are pressed too short a time, they may activate or remain active; if pressed too long or hard, they may be irritated or the muscle may be bruised, resulting in pain in the area treated. This bruising may last for a 1–3 days after treatment, and may feel like, but is not similar to, [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS), the pain felt days after overexerting muscles. Pain is also common after a massage if the practitioner uses pressure on unnoticed latent or active trigger points, or is not skilled in myofascial trigger point therapy.

[[Evidence based medicine]] researchers concluded as of 2001 that ''evidence for the usefulness of trigger points in the diagnosis of [[fibromyalgia]] is thin.''<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band90/b90-2.html |title=Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and treatment |journal=Bandolier |issue=90 |month=August |year=2001 |issn=1353-9906}}</ref> More recently, an association has been made between fibromyalgia [[tender points]] and active trigger points.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Ge HY, Nie H, Madeleine P, Danneskiold-Samsøe B, Graven-Nielsen T, Arendt-Nielsen L| title=Contribution of the local and referred pain from active myofascial trigger points in fibromyalgia syndrome| journal=Pain| date=2009-12-15| volume=147| issue=1–3| pages=233–40| pmid=19819074| doi=10.1016/j.pain.2009.09.019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Brezinschek HP| title=Mechanismen des Muskelschmerzes |trans_title=Mechanisms of muscle pain : significance of trigger points and tender points| language=German| journal=Zeitschrift für Rheumatologie |date=2008 December| volume=67| issue=8| pages=653–4, 656–7| pmid=19015861| doi=10.1007/s00393-008-0353-y}}</ref>

===Injection===
Injections without anesthetics, or dry needling, and injections including saline, [[local anesthetic]]s such as [[procaine hydrochloride]] (Novocain), [[steroids]], and [[botulinum toxin]] provide more immediate relief and can be effective when other methods fail. In regards to injections with anesthetics, a low concentration, short acting local anesthetic such as procaine 0.5% without steroids or [[adrenalin]] is recommended. High concentrations or long acting local anesthetics as well as [[epinephrine]] can cause muscle [[necrosis]], while use of steroids can cause tissue damage. 

Despite the concerns about long acting agents,<ref name="travell"/> a mixture of lidocaine and marcaine is often used.<ref name="lowback">

</ref> A mixture of 1 part 2% [[lidocaine]] with 3 parts 0.5% [[bupivacaine]] (trade name:Marcaine) provides 0.5% lidocaine and 0.375% bupivacaine. This has the advantages of immediate anesthesia with lidocaine during injection to minimize injection pain while providing a longer duration of action with a lowered concentration of bupivacaine.

In 1979, a study by Czech physician Karl Lewit reported that dry needling had the same success rate as anesthetic injections for the treatment of trigger points. He dubbed this the 'needle effect'.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Pain |author=Lewit K |title=The needle effect in the relief of myofascial pain |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=1979 |pages=83–90 |pmid=424236 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90142-8 }}</ref>   

Health insurance companies in the US such as [[Blue Cross]], [[Medica]], and [[HealthPartners]] began covering trigger point injections in 2005.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

===Self-treatment===
There are a number of ways to self-treat trigger points and these methods are described in numerous texts. Underlying any attempts at self-treatment should be a working knowledge of the area to be treated, especially with regard to the musculature, nerves, glands and vessels.{{or|date=February 2013}}

===Risks===
Treatment, whether by self or by a professional, has some inherent dangers.  It may lead to damage of soft tissue and other organs. The trigger points in the upper [[quadratus lumborum]], for instance, are very close to the [[kidney]]s and poorly administered treatment (particularly injections) may lead to kidney damage. Likewise, treating the [[masseter muscle]] may damage the [[salivary glands]] [[wiktionary:superficial|superficial]] to this muscle. Furthermore, some experts believe trigger points may develop as a protective measure against unstable [[joint]]s.{{Citation}}

===Research===
Studies to date on the efficacy of dry needling for MTrPs and pain have been too small to be conclusive.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=European Journal of Pain |author=Tough EA, White AR, Cummings TM, Richards SH, Campbell JL |title=Acupuncture and dry needling in the management of myofascial trigger point pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials |date=2009 Jan |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2008.02.006 |pmid=18395479 }}</ref>

==History==
Trigger points have been a subject of study by a small number of doctors for several decades although this has not become part of mainstream medicine. The existence of tender areas and zones of [[induration]] in muscles has been recognized in medicine for many years and was described as muscular rheumatism or fibrositis in English; German terms included ''myogelose'' and ''myalgie''. However, there was little agreement about what they meant. Important work was carried out by J. H. Kellgren at [[University College Hospital]], London, in the 1930s and, independently, by Michael Gutstein in Berlin and Michael Kelly in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |year=2003 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=8–12 |pmc=152828 |pmid=12638664 |title=Janet G. Travell, MD: A Daughter's Recollection |author=Wilson VP}}</ref> The latter two workers continued to publish into the 1950s and 1960s. Kellgren conducted experiments in which he injected hypertonic saline into healthy volunteers and showed that this gave rise to zones of referred extremity pain. [[Janet G. Travell]]'s work with trigger point and treatment of US [[John F. Kennedy]]'s back pain led to her being asked to be the first female Personal Physician to the President.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bagg JE |title=The President's Physician |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |year=2003 |pmid=12638662 |pmc=152826 }}</ref>

Today, much treatment of trigger points and their pain complexes are handled by myofascial trigger point therapists, [[massage therapist]]s, [[physical therapist]]s, [[osteopathy|osteopathic physicians (DOs)]], [[occupational therapist]]s, [[Myotherapy|myotherapists]], and [[athletic trainer|certified athletic trainers]], as well as some [[naturopathic|naturopaths]], [[chiropractic|chiropractors]], [[dentists]] and [[acupuncture|acupuncturists]], and other hands-on [[somatic]] practitioners who have had experience or training in the field of [[neuromuscular therapy]] (NMT).
