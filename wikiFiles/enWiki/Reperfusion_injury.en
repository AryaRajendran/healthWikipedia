'''Reperfusion injury''' is the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage caused when [[blood]] supply returns to the tissue after a period of [[ischemia]] or lack of oxygen.  The absence of [[oxygen]] and [[nutrient]]s from blood during the ischemic period creates a condition in which the restoration of [[circulatory system|circulation]] results in [[inflammation]] and [[oxidation|oxidative]] damage through the induction of [[oxidative stress]] rather than restoration of normal function.

== Mechanisms ==
The [[inflammatory response]] is partially responsible for the damage of reperfusion injury.  [[White blood cell]]s, carried to the area by the newly returning blood, release a host of [[cytokine|inflammatory factors]] such as [[interleukin]]s as well as [[reactive oxygen species|free radicals]] in response to tissue damage.<ref name="WMClark">{{cite web | last = Clark | first = Wayne M. | title = Reperfusion Injury in Stroke | work = eMedicine | publisher = WebMD   | date = January 5, 2005 | url = http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic602.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-09 }}</ref> The restored blood flow reintroduces oxygen within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that damages cellular [[protein]]s, [[DNA]], and the [[plasma membrane]].  Damage to the cell's membrane may in turn cause the release of more free radicals. Such reactive species may also act indirectly in [[redox signaling]] to turn on [[apoptosis]].  White blood cells may also bind to the [[endothelium]] of small [[capillary|capillaries]], obstructing them and leading to more ischemia.<ref name="WMClark" />

Reperfusion injury plays a part in the [[brain]]'s [[ischemic cascade]], which is involved in [[stroke]] and [[Traumatic brain injury|brain trauma]].  Similar failure processes are involved in brain failure following reversal of [[cardiac arrest]];<ref>{{cite web

Repeated bouts of ischemia and reperfusion injury also are thought to be a factor leading to the formation and failure to [[wound healing|heal]] of [[chronic wound]]s such as [[pressure sore]]s and [[diabetic foot]] [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]].<ref name="TMustoe">{{cite journal | author=Mustoe T. | title=Understanding chronic wounds: a unifying hypothesis on their pathogenesis and implications for therapy | journal=American Journal Of Surgery | volume=187 | issue=5A | year=2004 | pages=65S–70S | pmid=15147994 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9610(03)00306-4}}</ref>  Continuous pressure limits blood supply and causes ischemia, and the inflammation occurs during reperfusion.  As this process is repeated, it eventually damages tissue enough to cause a [[wound]].<ref name="TMustoe" />

In prolonged ischemia (60 minutes or more), [[hypoxanthine]] is formed as breakdown product of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] metabolism. The enzyme ''[[xanthine dehydrogenase]]'' acts in reverse, that is as a ''[[xanthine oxidase]]'' as a result of the higher availability of oxygen. This oxidation results in molecular oxygen being converted into highly reactive [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]].  Xanthine oxidase also produces [[uric acid]],  which may act as both a prooxidant and as a scavenger of reactive species such as peroxynitrite.  Excessive [[nitric oxide]] produced during reperfusion reacts with [[superoxide]] to produce the potent reactive species [[peroxynitrite]].  Such radicals and reactive oxygen species attack cell membrane lipids, proteins, and glycosaminoglycans, causing further damage.  They may also initiate specific biological processes by [[redox signaling]].

Reperfusion can cause [[hyperkalemia]].<ref name="Atlee2007">{{cite book|author=John L. Atlee|title=Complications in anesthesia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qVdr5MVok1YC&pg=PA55|accessdate=25 July 2010|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4160-2215-2|pages=55–}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Main|Reperfusion therapy}}
A study of [[aortic cross-clamping]], a common procedure in [[cardiac surgery]], demonstrated a strong potential benefit with further research ongoing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Therapeutic hypothermia===
An intriguing area of research demonstrates the ability of a reduction in body temperature to limit ischemic injuries. This procedure is called [[therapeutic hypothermia]], and it has been shown by a number of large, high-quality randomised trials to significantly improve survival and reduce brain damage after birth asphyxia in newborn infants, almost doubling the chance of normal survival. For a full review see [[Hypothermia therapy for neonatal encephalopathy]].

However, the therapeutic effect of hypothermia does not confine itself to metabolism and membrane stability. Another school of thought focuses on hypothermia’s ability to prevent the injuries that occur after circulation returns to the brain, or what is termed [[reperfusion]] injuries.  In fact an individual suffering from an ischemic insult continues suffering injuries well after circulation is restored. In rats it has been shown that neurons often die a full 24 hours after blood flow returns.  Some theorize that this delayed reaction derives from the various inflammatory immune responses that occur during reperfusion.<ref name="Newsweek">Adler, Jerry. "Back From the Dead."  Newsweek. July 23, 2007.</ref> These inflammatory responses cause intracranial pressure, pressure which leads to cell injury and in some situations cell death. Hypothermia has been shown to help moderate intracranial pressure and therefore to minimize the harmful effect of a patient’s inflammatory immune responses during reperfusion. Beyond this, reperfusion also increases free radical production. Hypothermia too has been shown to minimize a patient’s production of deadly [[free radicals]] during reperfusion. Many now suspect it is because hypothermia reduces both intracranial pressure and free radical production that hypothermia improves patient outcome following a blockage of blood flow to the brain.<ref>Polderman, Kees H. "Application of therapeutic hypothermia in the ICU."  Intensive Car Med.  (2004) 30:556-575.</ref>

===Hydrogen sulfide treatment===
There are some preliminary studies that seem to indicate that treatment with [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) can have a protective effect against reperfusion injury.<ref>Elrod J.W., J.W. Calvert, M.R. Duranski, D.J. Lefer. "Hydrogen sulfide donor protects against acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury." Circulation 114(18):II172, 2006.</ref>

===Cyclosporine===
In addition to its well-known immunosuppressive capabilities, the one-time administration of cyclosporine at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been found to deliver a 40 percent reduction in infarct size in a small group proof of concept study of human patients with reperfusion injury published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2008.<ref>Piot C., Croiselle P., Staat P.  et al. "Effect of Cyclosporine on Reperfusion Injury in Acute Myocardial Infaction." New England Journal of Medicine 359 (5): 473-481 2008.</ref> 

Reperfusion leads to biochemical imbalances within the cell that lead to cell death and increased infarct size. More specifically, calcium overload and excessive production of reactive oxygen species in the first few minutes after reperfusion set off a cascade of biochemical changes that result in the opening of the so-called mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore in the mitochondrial membrane of cardiac cells.<ref>Javadov S., Karmazyn M. "Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore Opening as an Endpoint to Initiate Cell Death and as a Putative Target for Cardioprotection." Cell Physiol Biochem 20:1-22 2007.</ref> 

The opening of the MPT pore leads to the inrush of water into the mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial disfunction and collapse. Upon collapse, the calcium is then released to overwhelm the next mitochondria in a cascading series of events that cause mitochondrial energy production supporting the cell to be reduced or stopped completely. The cessation of energy production results in cellular death. Protecting mitochondria is a viable cardioprotective strategy.<ref>Hausenloy D. and Yellon D. "Time to take myocardial reperfusion injury seriously." New England Journal of Medicine Editorial comment 359 (5): 518-520 2008.</ref>

Cyclosporine has been confirmed in studies to inhibit the actions of cyclophilin D, a protein which is induced by excessive intracellular calcium flow to interact with other pore components and help open the MPT pore. Inhibiting cyclophilin D has been shown to prevent the opening of the MPT pore and protect the mitochondria and cellular energy production from excessive calcium inflows.<ref>Javadov S., Karmazyn M. "Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore Opening as an Endpoint to Initiate Cell Death and as a Putative Target for Cardioprotection." Cell Physiol Biochem 20:1-22 2007.</ref>   

In 2008, an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine called for more studies to determine if cyclosporine can become a treatment to ameliorate reperfusion injury by protecting mitochondria.<ref>Hausenloy D. and Yellon D. "Time to take myocardial reperfusion injury seriously." New England Journal of Medicine Editorial comment 359 (5): 518-520 2008.</ref> To that end, in 2011 the researchers involved in the original 2008 NEJM study initiated a phase III clinical study of reperfusion injury in 1000 myocardial infarction patients in centers throughout Europe. Results of that study are expected to be announced later in 2014.

Note: This same process of mitochondrial destruction through the opening of the MPT pore is implicated in making traumatic brain injuries much worse.<ref>Sullivan, P., Sebastian, A., Hall, E. "Therapeutic window analysis of the neuroprotective effects of cyclosporine A after traumatic brain injury." Journal of Neurotrauma 2011; Feb;28:311–318.</ref> Cyclosporine is currently in a phase II/III (adaptive) clinical study in Europe to determine its ability to ameliorate neuronal cellular damage in traumatic brain injury.

==Reperfusion protection in obligate hibernators==
[[Hibernation|Obligatory hibernators]] such as the [[ground squirrel]]s show resistance to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in liver, heart, and small intestine during the hibernation season when there is a switch from [[carbohydrate metabolism]] to [[lipid metabolism]] for cellular energy supply.<ref name="lipid cycles">{{cite journal|last=Dark|first=J|title=Annual lipid cycles in hibernators: integration of physiology and behavior.|journal=Annual review of nutrition|year=2005|volume=25|pages=469–97|pmid=16011475|accessdate=11 December 2011|doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.25.050304.092514}}</ref> <ref name="ground squirrels">{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=MT|title=Advances in molecular biology of hibernation in mammals.|journal=BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology|date=2007 May|volume=29|issue=5|pages=431–40|pmid=17450592|accessdate=11 December 2011|doi=10.1002/bies.20560}}</ref> <ref name="squirrel hibernation">{{cite journal|last=Kurtz|first=CC|coauthors=Lindell, SL, Mangino, MJ, Carey, HV|title=Hibernation confers resistance to intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.|journal=American journal of physiology.
