'''Dolly''' (5 July 1996 – 14 February 2003) was a female [[domestic sheep]], and the first [[mammal]] to be [[cloning|cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell|somatic]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], using the process of [[nuclear transfer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=McLaren A |title=Cloning: pathways to a pluripotent future |journal=Science |volume=288 |issue=5472 |pages=1775–80 |year=2000 |pmid=10877698 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5472.1775}}</ref><ref name=Wilmut>{{Cite journal|author=Wilmut I, Schnieke AE, McWhir J, Kind AJ, Campbell KH |title=Viable offspring derived from fetal and adult mammalian cells |journal=Nature |volume=385 |issue=6619 |pages=810–3 |year=1997 |pmid=9039911 | doi=10.1038/385810a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.385..810W}}</ref> She was cloned by [[Ian Wilmut]], [[Keith Campbell (biologist)|Keith Campbell]] and colleagues at the [[Roslin Institute]] and the biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics near [[Edinburgh]] in Scotland.

The cell used as the donor for the cloning of Dolly was taken from a [[mammary gland]], and the production of a healthy clone therefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could recreate a whole individual. On Dolly's name, Wilmut stated "Dolly is derived from a mammary gland cell and we couldn't think of a more impressive pair of glands than [[Dolly Parton]]'s".<ref name="BBC">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/22/newsid_4245000/4245877.stm | work=BBC News | title=1997: Dolly the sheep is cloned | date=22 February 1997}}</ref>

==Birth==
Dolly was born on 5 July 1996 to three mothers (one provided the egg, another the DNA and a third carried the cloned embryo to term).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00148-9}}</ref> She was created using the technique of [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]], where the [[cell nucleus]] from an adult cell is transferred into an unfertilised [[oocyte]] (developing egg cell) that has had its [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] removed. The hybrid cell is then stimulated to divide by an electric shock, and when it develops into a [[blastocyst]] it is implanted in a surrogate mother.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Campbell KH, McWhir J , Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |year=1996 |pmid=8598906 | doi = 10.1038/380064a0|bibcode = 1996Natur.380...64C }}</ref> Dolly was the first clone produced from a cell taken from an adult mammal. The production of Dolly showed that genes in the nucleus of such a mature [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell are still capable of reverting to an embryonic [[Totipotency|totipotent]] state, creating a cell that can then go on to develop into any part of an animal.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Niemann H, Tian XC, King WA, Lee RS |title=Epigenetic reprogramming in embryonic and foetal development upon somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning |journal=Reproduction |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=151–63 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18239046 |doi=10.1530/REP-07-0397}}</ref> Dolly's existence was announced to the public on 22 February 1997.<ref name="BBC"/> It gained much attention in the media.  A commercial with Scottish scientists playing with sheep was aired on TV, and a special report in TIME Magazine featured Dolly the sheep.<ref>{{cite journal| journal= Ethnos: Journal of Anthropology | author= Edwards, Jeanette | title= Why Dolly Matters: Kinship, Culture, and Cloning | date= November 1999}}</ref>  ''Science'' featured Dolly as the breakthrough of the year.  Even though Dolly was not the first animal to be cloned, she gained this attention in the media because she was the first to be cloned from an adult cell.<ref>{{cite journal | author=McKinnell, Robert G., and Di Berardino, Marie A. | title=The Biology of Cloning: History and Rationale| journal=Bioscience | volume=49 | issue=11 | pages=875–885| date=November 1999}}</ref>

==Life==
[[Image:Dolly clone.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[cloning]] process that produced Dolly]]
Dolly lived her entire life at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh. There she was bred with a [[Welsh Mountain sheep|Welsh Mountain ram]] and produced six lambs in total. Her first lamb, named Bonnie, was born in April 1998.<ref name=BBC/> The next year Dolly produced twin lambs Sally and Rosie, and she gave birth to triplets Lucy, Darcy and Cotton in the year after that.<ref>[http://www.roslin.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyFamily.php Dolly's family]{{dead link|date=January 2012}} Roslin Institute, Accessed 21 February 2008 [http://google.com/search?q=cache:FvlkPVYjiIoJ:www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyFamily.php+Dolly%27s+family+Roslin+Institute&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=us&client=firefox-a Cached version]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> In the autumn of 2001, at the age of four, Dolly developed [[arthritis]] and began to walk stiffly, but this was successfully treated with [[anti-inflammatory]] drugs.<ref>[http://www.roslin.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyArthritis.php Dolly's arthritis]{{dead link|date=January 2012}} Roslin Institute, Accessed 21 February 2008 [http://google.com/search?q=cache:Yo2NgUydUxgJ:www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyArthritis.php+%22Dolly%27s+arthritis%22+Roslin+Institute&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us&client=firefox-a Cached version]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

==Death==
On 14 February 2003, Dolly was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanised]] because she had a progressive lung disease and severe arthritis.<ref name=final_illness>[http://www.roslin.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyFinalIilness.php Dolly's final illness]{{dead link|date=January 2012}} Roslin Institute, Accessed 21 February 2008 [http://google.com/search?q=cache:ZZqIBPjFuT0J:www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyFinalIilness.php+%22Dolly%27s+arthritis%22+Roslin+Institute&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=us&client=firefox-a Cached version]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> A [[Finnish Dorset (sheep)|Finn Dorset]] such as Dolly has a life expectancy of around 11 to 12 years, but Dolly lived to be only six years of age.

Some have speculated that a contributing factor to Dolly's death was that she could have been born with a genetic age of six years, the same age as the sheep from which she was cloned.<ref name=age/> One basis for this idea was the finding that Dolly's [[telomeres]] were short, which is typically a result of the [[ageing]] process.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Shiels PG, Kind AJ, Campbell KH, ''et al'' |title=Analysis of telomere length in Dolly, a sheep derived by nuclear transfer |journal=Cloning |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=119–25 |year=1999 |pmid=16218837 |url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/15204559950020003 | doi = 10.1089/15204559950020003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Shiels PG, Kind AJ, Campbell KH, ''et al'' |title=Analysis of telomere lengths in cloned sheep |journal=Nature |volume=399 |issue=6734 |pages=316–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10360570 | doi = 10.1038/20580|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..316H }}</ref> The Roslin Institute have stated that intensive health screening did not reveal any abnormalities in Dolly that could have come from advanced aging.<ref name=age>[http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/public-interest/dolly-the-sheep/a-life-of-dolly/ Was Dolly already 'old' at birth?] Roslin Institute, Accessed 4 April 2010</ref>
