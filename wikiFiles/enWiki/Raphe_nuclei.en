The '''raphe nuclei''' ("raffe", Greek: ραφή = ''seam'') are a moderate-size cluster of [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]]  found in the [[brain stem]]. Their main function is to release [[serotonin]] to the rest of the [[brain]].<ref>{{cite book

== Anatomy ==
The raphe nuclei are traditionally considered to be the medial portion of the [[reticular formation]], and they
appear as a ridge of cells in the center and most medial portion of the [[brain stem]].

In order from [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] to [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]], the raphe nuclei are known as the ''[[nucleus raphe obscurus|nucleus raphes obscurus]]'', the ''[[raphe magnus|nucleus raphes magnus]]'', the ''[[raphe pontis|nucleus raphes pontis]]'', the ''[[raphe pallidus|nucleus raphes pallidus]]'', the ''[[nucleus centralis superior]]'', ''[[nucleus raphe dorsalis|nucleus raphes dorsalis]]'', ''[[nuclei linearis intermedius]]'' and ''[[linearis rostralis]]''.<ref>{{cite web

Some scientists chose to group the nuclei lineares into one nucleus, shrinking the number of raphe to seven, e.g.,
[[NeuroNames]] makes the following ordering:<ref>{{BrainInfo|ancil|190}}</ref>
* Raphe nuclei of [[medulla oblongata]]
** [[Nucleus raphe obscurus|Nucleus raphes obscurus]]
** [[Nucleus raphe magnus|Nucleus raphes magnus]]
** [[Nucleus pallidus|Nucleus raphes pallidus]]

* Raphe nuclei of the [[pontine]] reticular formation
** [[Pontine raphe nucleus|Nucles raphes pontis]]
** [[Inferior central nucleus|Nucleus centralis inferior]]

* Raphe nuclei of the [[midbrain]] reticular formation
** [[Superior central nucleus|Nucleus centralis superior]] (''median raphe nucleus'')
** [[Dorsal raphe nucleus|Nucleus raphes dorsalis]]

== Projections ==
These nuclei interact with almost every pertinent portion of the brain, but only a few of them have specifically independent interaction. These select nuclei are discussed as follows.

Overall, the caudal raphe nuclei, including the nucleus raphes magnus, nucleus raphes pallidus and nucleus raphes obscurus, all project towards the spinal cord and brain stem. The more-rostral nuclei, including the nucleus raphes pontis, nucleus centralis superior (also called median raphe nucleus) and nucleus raphes dorsalis project towards the brain areas of higher function<ref>{{cite web

== Function ==
The raphe nuclei have a vast impact upon the central nervous system.
Many of the neurons in the nuclei (but not the majority) are serotonergic; i.e., contain [[serotonin]], a type of [[monoamine]] neurotransmitter. It is important to note that pharmacology traditionally affects global serotonin levels, while the actions of the raphe nuclei are dependent on the complex interplay between nuclei.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

Projections from the raphe nuclei also terminate in the dorsal horn of spinal gray matter where they regulate the release of [[enkephalins]], which inhibit pain sensation.

The raphe nuclei provide feedback to the [[suprachiasmatic nuclei]] (SCN), thus contributing in circadian rhythms in animals. The SCN transmits to the raphe nuclei via the [[dorsomedial hypothalamus nucleus]] altering serotonin levels for sleep/wake states. The raphe nuclei will then transmit feedback to the SCN about the animal's vigilance and levels of alertness. This reciprocal feedback between the two structures provides an adaptable yet stable basis of circadian rhythms.<ref>{{cite book
