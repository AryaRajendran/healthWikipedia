'''Esomeprazole''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|s|ɵ|ˈ|m|ɛ|p|r|ə|z|oʊ|l}}) is a [[proton pump inhibitor]] (brand name '''Nexium''') which reduces acid secretion through inhibition of the H</sup>+ / K</sup>+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells. By inhibiting the functioning of this transporter, the drug prevents formation of gastric acid. 

It is used in the treatment of [[dyspepsia]], [[peptic ulcer|peptic ulcer disease]] (PUD), [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GORD/GERD) and [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]].  

Esomeprazole is the ''S''-[[enantiomer]] of [[omeprazole]] (brand name Prilosec/Losec).
Generic versions of Esomeprazole are available in several countries of Europe and in emerging markets like India, Peru, Ecuador, Caribbean Islands, Nigeria, Africa, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Myanmar under the brand name Raciper.

==Medical use==
The primary uses of esomeprazole are [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], treatment of [[duodenal ulcers]] caused by H. pylori, preventing of [[gastric ulcers]] in those on chronic [[NSAID]] therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Esomeprazole Magnesium|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/esomeprazole-magnesium.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

===Gastroesophageal reflux disease===
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a condition in which the digestive acid in the stomach comes in contact with the [[esophagus]] (food pipe). The irritation caused by this disorder is known as [[heartburn]]. Long term contact between the acid and esophagus can cause permanent damage to the esophagus. Esomeprazole reduces the production of digestives acids, thus minimizing their effect on the esophagus.

===Duodenal ulcers===
Esomeprazole is combined with the antibiotics [[clarithromycin]] and [[amoxicillin]] (or [[metronidazole]] in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in the 7-14 day eradication triple therapy for ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''. Infection by ''H. pylori'' is the causative factor in the majority of [[Peptic ulcer|peptic and duodenal ulcers]].

===Evidence of efficacy===
AstraZeneca claims that esomeprazole provides improved efficacy, in terms of stomach acid control, over the R enantiomer of omeprazole. Many noted health professionals including Dr. [[Otis Brawley]] (author of "How We Do Harm: A Doctor Breaks Ranks About Being Sick In America",  and currently (as of August 2012) both chief medical officer and executive vice president of the American Cancer Society) have expressed the view that this improvement in efficacy is due to the dose of esomeprazole recommended for therapy rather than any inherent superiority of esomeprazole.  And in his 2003 address to the American Medical Association, Thomas Sully, then director of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services told his audience "You should be embarrassed if you prescribe Nexium because it increases costs with no medical benefits…. The fact is Nexium is Prilosec …it is the same drug. It is a mirror compound."

An alternative rationale suggested for the use of esomeprazole was the reduction in interindividual variability in efficacy. However the clinical advantage of this hypothesis has not thoroughly been tested in large-scale trials.<ref name=Somogyi>{{cite journal

Given the large difference in cost between all other proton pump inhibitors and that of [[omeprazole]], many physicians recommend a trial of over-the-counter products before beginning more extensive therapies and testing.

Although the (S)-isomer is more potent in humans, the (R)-isomer is more potent in the testing of rats, while the enantiomers are equipotent in dogs.<ref>{{cite book

===Interactions===
Esomeprazole is a [[enzyme inhibitor|competitive inhibitor]] of the enzymes [[CYP2C19]] and [[CYP2C9]], and may therefore [[drug interaction|interact]] with drugs that depend on them for [[drug metabolism|metabolism]], such as [[diazepam]] and [[warfarin]]; the concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with esomeprazole.<ref name=Stedman>{{cite journal |author=Stedman CA, Barclay ML |title=Review article: comparison of the pharmacokinetics, acid suppression and efficacy of proton pump inhibitors |journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=963–78 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10930890 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00788.x}}</ref> Conversely, [[Clopidogrel]] (Plavix) is an inactive [[prodrug]] that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form; inhibition of CYP2C19 blocks the activation of clopidogrel, thus reducing its effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lau WC, Gurbel PA |title=The drug–drug interaction between proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel |journal=CMAJ |volume=180 |issue=7 |pages=699–700 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19332744 |pmc=2659824 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.090251}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Norgard NB, Mathews KD, Wall GC |title=Drug-drug interaction between clopidogrel and the proton pump inhibitors |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=1266–74 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19470853 |doi=10.1345/aph.1M051}}</ref>

Drugs that depend on stomach pH for absorption may interact with omeprazole; drugs that depend on an acidic environment (such as [[ketoconazole]] or [[atazanavir]]) will be poorly absorbed, whereas drugs that are broken down in acidic environments (such as [[erythromycin]]) will be absorbed to a greater extent than normal.<ref name=Stedman/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Single 20–40&nbsp;mg oral doses generally give rise to peak plasma esomeprazole concentrations of 0.5-1.0&nbsp;mg/L within 1–4 hours, but after several days of once-daily administration these levels may increase by about 50%. A 30 minute intravenous infusion of a similar dose usually produces peak plasma levels on the order of 1–3&nbsp;mg/L. The drug is rapidly cleared from the body, largely by urinary excretion of pharmacologically-inactive metabolites such as 5-hydroxymethylesomeprazole and 5-carboxyesomeprazole. Esomeprazole and its metabolites are analytically indistinguishable from omeprazole and the corresponding omeprazole metabolites unless chiral techniques are employed.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 388-389.</ref>

==Dosage forms==
[[Image:Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) pills.JPG|thumb|40 mg Nexium brand [[esomeprazole magnesium]] capsules]]
Esomeprazole is available as delayed-release capsules in the United States or as delayed release tablets in Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada (containing [[esomeprazole magnesium]]) in strengths of 20&nbsp;mg and 40&nbsp;mg; and as esomeprazole sodium for [[intravenous]] injection/infusion. Oral esomeprazole preparations are [[enteric coating|enteric-coated]], due to the rapid degradation of the drug in the [[acid]]ic conditions of the [[stomach]]. This is achieved by formulating capsules using the multiple-unit pellet system.

===Multiple unit pellet system===
Esomeprazole capsules are formulated as a "multiple unit pellet system" (MUPS). Essentially, the [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]] consists of extremely small enteric-coated granules (pellets) of the esomeprazole formulation inside an outer shell. When the capsule is immersed in an aqueous solution, as happens when the capsule reaches the stomach, water enters the capsule by [[osmosis]]. The contents swell from water absorption causing the shell to burst, releasing the enteric-coated granules. For most patients, the multiple-unit pellet system is of no advantage over conventional enteric-coated preparations{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Patients for which the formulation is of benefit include those requiring [[nasogastric tube]] feeding and those with difficulty swallowing ([[dysphagia]]){{citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

==Production and manufacture==
The granules are manufactured in a [[fluid bed]] system with small sugar spheres as the starting material. The sugar spheres are sequentially spray-coated with a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] containing esomeprazole, a protective layer to prevent degradation of the drug in manufacturing, an enteric coating and an outer layer to reduce granule aggregation. The granules are mixed with other inactive [[excipient]]s and compressed into tablets. Finally, the tablets are film-coated to improve the stability and appearance of the preparation.

===Economics===
Between the launch of esomeprazole in 2001 and 2005, the drug has netted AstraZeneca about $14.4 billion.<ref>Financial impact information: [http://www.astrazeneca.com/sites/7/imagebank/typeArticleparam511672/astrazeneca-2005-annual-review.pdf 2005, $4.6 billion]; [http://www.astrazeneca.com/sites/7/imagebank/typearticleparam511562/astrazeneca-2004-annual-report.pdf 2004, $3.9 billion]; [http://www.astrazeneca.com/sites/7/imagebank/typearticleparam503063/AstraZeneca%20Annual%20Report%202003.pdf 2003, $3.3 billion]; [http://www2.astrazeneca.com/annualrep2002/pdf/694617_Report_front.pdf 2002, $2 billion]; [http://www2.astrazeneca.com/annualrep2001/pdf/first.pdf 2001, launch and $580 million].</ref>

===Controversy===
{{main|AstraZeneca#Nexium|l1=AstraZeneca's marketing of Nexium}}
There has been some controversy about [[AstraZeneca]]'s behaviour in creating, patenting and marketing of the drug. Esomeprazole's successful predecessor [[omeprazole]] is a mixture of two [[Chirality (chemistry)|mirror-imaged molecules]] (esomeprazole which is the S-enantiomer, and R-omeprazole); critics said that the company was trying to "[[Evergreening|evergreen]]" its omeprazole patent by patenting the pure esomeprazole and aggressively marketing to doctors that it is more effective than the mixture,<ref>{{cite journal

[[Marcia Angell]], former Editor-in-Chief of the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], spoke at [[Harvard Medical School]] to a German magazine on August 16, 2007, and said that AstraZeneca's scientists deceptively doctored their comparative studies such that the difference from omeprazole would look larger, providing a marketing advantage.<ref>{{cite news
