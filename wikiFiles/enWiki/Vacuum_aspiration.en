'''Vacuum''' or '''suction aspiration''' uses aspiration to remove uterine contents through the [[cervix]]. It may be used as a method of induced [[abortion]], a therapeutic procedure used after [[miscarriage]], or a procedure to obtain a sample for endometrial biopsy. The rate of [[infection]] is lower than any other surgical abortion procedure at 0.5%.<ref name="webmd">{{cite web | title=Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion | work=A-Z Health Guide from WebMD | month=October | year=2006 |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp | accessdate=February 18, 2006}}</ref>  Some sources may use the terms ''[[dilation and evacuation]]''<ref name="ebsco">{{cite web | title = Miscarriage | work = EBSCO Publishing Health Library | publisher = Brigham and Women's Hospital | month = January | year = 2007 | url = http://healthgate.partners.org/browsing/browseContent.asp?fileName=11672.xml&title=Miscarriage | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}</ref> or "suction" ''[[dilation and curettage]]''<!--

==History==
Vacuuming as a means of removing the uterine contents, rather than the previous use of a hard metal curette, was pioneered in 1958 by Drs Wu Yuantai and Wu Xianzhen in China,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wu Y and Wu X|title=A report of 300 cases using vacuum aspiration for the termination of pregnancy |journal=Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology |year=1958 |month= |volume= |issue= |pages=447–9 |language=English translation from BMJ |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/data/336/7657/1332-a/DC1/1 |format=PDF}}</ref> but their paper was only translated into English on the fiftieth anniversary of the study that "ultimately led to the technique becoming the world’s commonest and safest obstetric procedure".<ref name="BMJ-recognition">{{cite journal |author=Coombes R |title=Obstetricians seek recognition for Chinese pioneers of safe abortion |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |pages=1332–3 |month=14 June|year=2008 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/336/7657/1332-a |doi=10.1136/bmj.39608.391030.DB |pmc=2427078  |publisher=BMJ |pmid=18556303 |issue=7657}}</ref>

In Canada, the method was pioneered and improved on by [[Henry Morgentaler]], achieving a complication rate of 0.48% and no deaths in over 5,000 cases.<ref name=HM>{{cite journal |author=Morgentaler H H | title=Report on 5641 outpatient abortions by vacuum suction curettage |url=http://pubget.com/paper/4758593/Report_on_5641_outpatient_abortions_by_vacuum_suction_curettage |journal=CMAJ  |volume=109(12) |pages=1202–5|year=1973 |PMID 4758593 }}</ref> He was the first doctor in North America to use the technique, which he trained other doctors to use.<ref name=Guttmacher>{{cite journal |author=Morgentaler H | title=Alan F.

Dorothea Kerslake introduced the method into the United Kingdom in 1967 and published a study in the United States that further spread the technique.<ref name="BMJ-recognition"/><ref name="pmid5338708">{{cite journal |author=Kerslake D, Casey D |title=Abortion induced by means of the uterine aspirator |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=35–45 |year=1967 |month=July |pmid=5338708 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Harvey Karman in the United States refined the technique the early 1970s with the development of the [[Karman cannula]], a soft, flexible cannula that avoided the need for initial cervical dilatation and so reduced the risks of puncturing the uterus.<ref name="BMJ-recognition"/>

==Clinical uses==
Vacuum aspiration may be used as a method of induced abortion, as a therapeutic procedure after miscarriage, to aid in menstrual regulation, and to obtain a sample for endometrial biopsy.<ref name="greenslade">{{cite paper | author = Baird, Traci L. and Susan K.

When used as a miscarriage treatment or an abortion method, vacuum aspiration may be used alone or with [[cervical dilation]] anytime in the first trimester (up to 12 weeks [[gestational age]]). For more advanced pregnancies, vacuum aspiration may be used as one step in a [[dilation and evacuation]] procedure.<ref>Baird (2001), pp. 4-5,14 (sidebars and information box).</ref>  Vacuum aspiration is the procedure used for almost all first-trimester abortions in many countries.<ref name="greenslade" />

==Procedure==
[[File:Vacuum-aspiration.svg|thumb|A diagram of a vacuum aspiration abortion procedure at 8 weeks gestation.<br />'''1:''' Amniotic sac<br />'''2:''' Embryo<br />'''3:''' Uterine lining<br />'''4:''' Speculum<br />'''5:''' Vacurette<br />'''6:''' Attached to a suction pump]]
Vacuum aspiration is an outpatient procedure that generally involves a clinic visit of several hours.<ref>Baird (2001), p. 10 (table).</ref>  The procedure itself typically takes less than 15 minutes.<ref name="webmd" />  [[Suction]] is created with either an electric pump (electric vacuum aspiration or EVA) or a manual pump (manual vacuum aspiration or MVA). Both methods use the same level of suction, and so can be considered equivalent in terms of effectiveness and safety.<ref name="4-6">Baird (2001), pp. 4-6.</ref>

The clinician may first use a [[local anesthetic]] to numb the [[cervix]]. Then, the clinician may use instruments called "dilators" to open the cervix, or sometimes medically induce dilation with drugs. Finally, a sterile [[cannula]] is inserted into the [[uterus]] and attached via tubing to the pump. The pump creates a [[vacuum]] which empties uterine contents.<ref name="webmd" />

After a procedure for abortion or miscarriage treatment, the tissue removed from the uterus is examined for completeness.<ref name="webmd" /> Expected contents include the [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] as well as the [[decidua]], chorionic villi, amniotic fluid, [[amniotic sac|amniotic membrane]] and other tissue.

Post-treatment care includes brief observation in a recovery area and a follow-up appointment approximately two weeks later. These would tend to include tests for infection in case any biological material wasn't properly removed.

==Advantages over dilation and curettage==
[[Dilation and curettage]] (D&C), also known as ''sharp curettage'', was once the standard of care in situations requiring uterine evacuation. However, vacuum aspiration has a number of advantages over D&C and has largely replaced D&C in many settings.<ref>Baird (2001), p. 2.</ref>

Vacuum aspiration may be used earlier in pregnancy than [[dilation and curettage]] (D&C). Manual vacuum aspiration is the only surgical abortion procedure available earlier than the 6th week of pregnancy.<ref name="webmd" />  Vacuum aspiration has lower rates of complications when compared to D&C.<ref name="4-6" />

Vacuum aspiration - especially manual vacuum aspiration - is significantly cheaper than D&C. The equipment needed for vacuum aspiration costs less than a [[curette]] set. Unlike D&C, vacuum aspiration does not require general anesthesia and so can be performed as an outpatient procedure at a clinic rather than in a hospital surgical setting. While D&C is generally provided only by [[physician]]s, vacuum aspiration may be performed by advanced practice clinicians such as physician's assistants and midwives.<ref name="dc">Baird (2001), pp. 5,8-13.</ref>

Manual vacuum aspiration does not require electricity and so can be provided in locations that have unreliable electrical service or none at all. Manual vacuum aspiration also has the advantage of being quiet, without the noise of an electric vacuum pump.<ref name="dc" />

==Complications==
When used for uterine evacuation, vacuum aspiration is 98% effective in removing all uterine contents.<ref name="4-6" />  Retained products of conception require a second aspiration procedure. This is more common when the procedure is performed very early in pregnancy, before 6 weeks gestational age.<ref name="webmd" />

Other complications occur at a rate of less than 1 per 100 procedures and include excessive blood loss, infection, injury to the cervix or uterus,<ref name="4-6" /> including [[uterine perforation|perforation]],  and uterine adhesions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Dalton | first = VK  | coauthors = Saunders NA, Harris LH, Williams JA, Lebovic DI | title = Intrauterine adhesions after manual vacuum aspiration for early pregnancy failure | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | pages = 1823.e1–3 | month = June | year = 2006 | pmid = 16674955 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.11.065 }}</ref>
