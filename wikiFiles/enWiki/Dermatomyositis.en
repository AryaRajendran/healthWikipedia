'''Dermatomyositis''' (DM) is a connective-tissue disease related to [[polymyositis]] (PM) that is characterized by [[inflammation]] of the muscles and the skin.  While DM most frequently affects the skin and muscles, it is a systemic disorder that  may also affect the joints, the esophagus, the lungs, and, less commonly, the heart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/332783-overview|work=Medscape reference|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=12 Oct 2011|title=Dermatomyositis |author=Jeffrey P Callen}}</ref>

== Causes ==
The cause is unknown, but it may result from either a viral infection or an [[autoimmune]] reaction. In the latter case it is a [[systemic autoimmune disease]]. Many people diagnosed with dermatomyositis were previously diagnosed with [[infectious mononucleosis]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]]. Some cases of dermatomyositis actually "overlap" (i.e. co-exist with or are part of a spectrum that includes) other autoimmune diseases such as [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[scleroderma]], or [[vasculitis]]. Because of the link between dermatomyositis and autoimmune disease, doctors and patients suspecting dermatomyositis may find it helpful to run an [[Anti-nuclear antibody|ANA]] - antinuclear antibody - test, which in cases of a [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]]-like nature may be positive (usually from 1:160 to 1:640, with normal ranges at 1:40 and below).{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Several cases of [[polymyositis]] and dermatomyositis were reported as being triggered by the use of various [[statin]] drugs used to control blood [[cholesterol]]. Muscle biopsies of these patients showed [[rhabdomyolysis]], and degeneration and regeneration of muscle tissue.

High blood levels of [[creatine kinase]] (CPK) showed greater than 5 times the normal levels also supporting the [[rhabdomyolysis]] findings{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}. CPK is an enzyme found mainly in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle that tends to rise when inflammation occurs during normal exercise. When these levels rise in excess of the normal level (less than 200), and become more than five times higher, severe cell damage to the muscles, brain, and heart ensue{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}. The higher the CPK, the greater the cellular damage done{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}. Extremely high levels of CPK cause [[rhabdomyolysis]] to these muscles and organs{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}. Without treatment, [[kidney]] damage occurs and death in the more severe cases. Confirmed [[polymyositis]] with the skin signs is known as dermatomyositis.

Some cases of dermatomyositis are a [[paraneoplastic phenomenon]], indicating the presence of [[cancer]].<ref name="pmid16603844">{{cite journal | author=Scheinfeld NS | title=Ulcerative paraneoplastic dermatomyositis secondary to metastatic breast cancer | journal=Skinmed | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=94–6 | year=2006 | pmid=16603844 | url=http://www.lejacq.com/articleDetail.cfm?pid=SKINmed_5;2:94 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-9740.2006.03637.x}}</ref> In cases involving cancer, the cancer is usually pre-existent, with removal of the cancer resulting in remission of the dermatomyositis. The onset of a rash in patients with pre-existing [[myositis]] requires investigation of the [[neoplastic]] possibility.

In his 1988 article, ''Clinical pathologic correlations of Lyme disease by stage'', noted [[Lyme disease]] researcher Dr. Alan Steere observed, "[...] the perivascular [[lymphoid]] infiltrate in clinical [[myositis]] does not differ from that seen in [[polymyositis]] or dermatomyositis. All of these [[histologic]] [[derangements]] suggest [[immunologic]] damage in response to persistence of the [[spirochete]], however few in number."

== Prognosis ==
Before the advent of modern treatments such as [[prednisone]], [[intravenous immunoglobulin]], [[plasmapheresis]], [[chemotherapies]], and other drugs, the prognosis was poor.<ref name=squid57squid>Page 285 in: Thomson and Cotton ''Lecture Notes in Pathology'', Blackwell Scientific. Third Edition</ref> Now there are numerous treatments and immunomodulatory drugs.  Fortunately, over 90% of patients today will do well for many years, with remission being a possibility.  However, it is still important that treatment begin as soon as possible.

== Presentation ==
Dermatomyositis occurs more commonly in female patients. It presents as a proximal symmetrical muscle weakness with [[vasculitis]] affecting the skin, muscles and internal organs. Patients find it hard to raise their arms to comb their hair or walk up the stairs due to the proximal muscle weakness. It can be severe enough to affect the muscles needed for speech and swallowing and is also known to cause respiratory compromise. [[Calcinosis]] can occur in the skin, joints and tissues. Upon investigation, characteristically one would find an elevated ESR and CPK along with typical EMG findings of spontaneous muscle fibrillation and short polyphasic muscle potentials.

[[Image:XRaydermatomyositis.jpg|thumb|right|X-Ray of the knee in a patient with dermatomyositis.]]

[[Gottron lesions]], scaly erythematous eruptions or red patches overlying the knuckles, elbows, and knees are a characteristic feature of Dermatomyositis. Other skin manifestations involve periungual telangiectasias and a heliotropic (purple) rash over the upper eyelids.

[[X-ray]] findings sometimes include dystrophic [[calcification]]s in the muscles, and patients may or may not notice small calcium deposits under the skin.  Many do not have any calcium deposits of any kind.  The rash also may come and go, and may not be dependent on the severity of the muscle involvement at the time.  "Gottron's papules" (pink patches on the [[knuckles]] and other extensor surfaces) and [[priapism]] are associated with this disorder.

== Classification ==
Dermatomyositis is a type of [[autoimmune]] [[connective tissue disease]].<ref name="urlPolymyositis and Dermatomyositis: Autoimmune Disorders of Connective Tissue: Merck Manual Home Edition">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec05/ch068/ch068e.html |title=Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis: Autoimmune Disorders of Connective Tissue: Merck Manual Home Edition |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> It is related to [[polymyositis]] and [[inclusion body myositis]].

There is a form of this disorder that strikes children, known as [[juvenile dermatomyositis]] (JDM). For the most part juvenile dermatomyositis is the same as the adult form, but the relationship with cancer is far lower, or non-existent.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main symptoms include skin [[rash]] and [[symmetric]] [[proximal]] [[muscle weakness]] which may be accompanied by pain. The pain may resemble the type experienced after strenuous exercise.  Some dermatomyositis patients have little pain, while in others (esp. in JDM), the pain may be severe.  It is important to remember that this condition varies from person to person in many ways. Also in many cases muscle may deteriorate and render the patient temporarily [[paralyzed]] unable to walk, run, get out of bed, or even swallow food and liquids.

Skin findings occur in dermatomyositis but not PM and are generally present at diagnosis. ''Gottron's sign'' is an [[erythematous]], scaly eruption occurring in symmetric fashion over the [[Metacarpophalangeal joint|MCP]] and interphalangeal joints (can mimic [[psoriasis]]). The [[Heliotrope (color)|heliotrope]] or "lilac" rash<ref name=Kumar151>Page 151 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= 2007|pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref> is a violaceous eruption on the upper eyelids and in rare cases on the lower eyelids as well, often with itching and swelling (most specific, though uncommon){{Clarify|date=September 2010}}<!-- what is uncommon? the heliotrope rash or the swelling? -->. Shawl (or V-) sign is a diffuse, flat, [[erythematous]] [[lesion]] over the back and shoulders or in a "V" over the posterior neck and back or neck and upper chest, which worsens with UV light. [[Erythroderma]] is not a flat, [[erythematous]] [[lesion]] similar to the shawl sign but located in other areas, such as the [[Cheek|malar]] region and the forehead. [[Periungual]] [[telangiectasias]] and [[erythema]] occur.

Mechanic's hands (also in PM) refers to rough, cracked skin at the tips and [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] aspects of the fingers forming irregular dirty-appearing lines that resemble those seen in a laborer (this is also associated with the [[anti-synthetase syndrome]]). See: [[sclerodactyly]]. [[Psoriaform]] changes in the scalp can occur. [[Centripetal]] [[flagellate]] [[erythema]] comprises [[linear]], [[violaceous]] streaks on the trunk (possibly caused by itching [[pruritic]] skin). [[Calcinosis cutis]] (deposition of [[calcium]] in the skin) is usually seen in juvenile dermatomyositis, not adult dermatomyositis. [[Dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing) is another feature, occurring in as many as 33% of cases.

== Pathology ==

The diagnosis of dermatomyositis can be confirmed by [[muscle biopsy]], [[Electromyography|EMG]],and blood tests. It should be noted, however, that only muscle biopsy is truly diagnostic ([[pathognomonic]]); [[liver enzymes]] and EMG are relatively non-specific. Liver enzymes, specifically [[creatine phosphokinase]] (CPK), are the major tool in assessing the progress of the disease and/or the efficacy of treatment. On the muscle biopsy, there are two classic [[microscopic]] findings of dermatomyositis.  They are:

* A mixed [[B-cell|B-]] and [[T-cell]] perivascular inflammatory infiltrate
* [[Perifascicular]] [[muscle fiber]] [[atrophy]]

Dermatomyositis is associated with [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]], especially [[anti-Jo1]] antibody.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ghirardello | first=A | coauthors=Zampieri S, Tarricone E et al. | title=Clinical implications of autoantibody screening in patients with autoimmune myositis | journal=Autoimmunity | volume=39 | issue=3 | pages=217–221 | month=May | year=2006 | pmid=16769655 | doi=10.1080/08916930600622645 }}</ref>

== Microscopic findings ==

Cross sections of muscle reveal muscle fascicles with small, shrunken polygonal muscle fibers on the periphery of a fascicle surrounding central muscle fibers of normal, uniform size.

Aggregates of mature [[lymphocytes]] with small, dark nuclei and scant cytoplasm are seen surrounding vessels.  Other inflammatory cells are distinctly uncommon.  [[Immunohistochemistry]] can be used to demonstrate that both B- and T-cells are present in approximately equal numbers.

== Mechanism ==
{{See also|List of human leukocyte antigen alleles associated with cutaneous conditions}}
The mechanism is conjectured to be [[Complement system|complement]]-mediated damage of microscopic vessels with muscle atrophy and lymphocytic inflammation secondary to tissue [[ischemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Benveniste | first=O | coauthors=Squier W, Boyer O et al. | title=Pathogenesis of primary inflammatory myopathies | journal=Presse Médicale | volume=33 | issue=20 | pages=1444–1450 | month=November | year=2004 | pmid=15611679 | doi=10.1016/S0755-4982(04)98952-X }}</ref>

== Differential diagnosis ==

Dermatomyositis must be differentiated from other common, [[lymphocyte]] predominant inflammatory myopathies. If present, the characteristic [[perifascicular]] atrophy makes this distinction trivial.

There is some overlap in the microscopic appearances of different inflammatory myopathies, but some helpful differences are often present.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Nirmalananthan | first=N | coauthors=Holton JL, Hanna MG | title=Is it really myositis? A consideration of the differential diagnosis | journal=Current Opinion in Rheumatology | volume=16 | issue=6 | pages=684–691 | month=November | year=2004 | pmid=15577605 | doi=10.1097/01.bor.0000143441.27065.bc }}</ref> The rimmed vacuoles of [[inclusion body myositis]] (IBM) are absent in dermatomyositis. Polymyositis is characterised by diffuse or patchy inflammation of the muscle fascicles, a random pattern of muscle atrophy, and T-cell predominance with T-cells seen invading otherwise viable appearing muscle fibers.{{Ref|Benveniste2004}} [[Pubmed]] reports 15 articles where Dermatomyositis and Lyme Disease are associated.

== Treatment ==
This disease has no known cure. [[Exercise therapy for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|Specialized exercise therapy]] may supplement treatment to enhance quality of life.
