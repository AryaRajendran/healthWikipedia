'''Kaposi sarcoma''' ('''KS''') is a tumor caused by [[Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|Human herpesvirus 8]] (HHV8), also known as [[Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus]] (KSHV).  It was originally described by [[Moritz Kaposi]] ({{Respell|KA|pə-shi}}), a Hungarian dermatologist practicing at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1872.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaposi|first=M |year=1872 |title=Idiopathisches multiples Pigmentsarkom der Haut |journal=Arch.

Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is a systemic disease that can present with cutaneous lesions with or without internal involvement.  Four subtypes have been described: Classic KS, affecting middle aged men of Mediterranean and Jewish descent; African endemic KS; KS in iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients; and AIDS-related KS.  The erythematous to violaceous cutaneous lesions seen in KS have several morphologies: macular, patch, plaque, nodular, and exophytic.  The cutaneous lesions can be solitary, localized or disseminated.  KS can involve the oral cavity, lymph nodes, and viscera. Classic KS tends to be indolent, presenting with erythematous or violaceous patches on the lower extremities.  African endemic KS and AIDS-related KS tend to be more aggressive.  The AIDS-related KS lesions often rapidly progress to plaques and nodules affecting the upper trunk, face, and oral mucosa.  The diagnosis can be made with a tissue biopsy and, if clinically indicated, internal imaging should be done.

Once the diagnosis of KS has been made, treatment is based on the subtype and the presence of localized versus systemic disease.  Localized cutaneous disease can be treated with cryotherapy, intralesional injections of vinblastine, alitretinoin gel, radiotherapy, topical immunotherapy (imiquimod), or surgical excision.  Extensive cutaneous disease and/or internal disease may require IV chemotherapy and immunotherapy.  Discontinuation or reduction of immunosuppressive therapy is recommended when KS arises in the setting of iatrogenic immunosuppression.  However, with AIDS-related KS, [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]], or [[HAART]], has been shown to prevent, or induce regression of, KS.  Some AIDS patients have complete resolution of the lesions and prolonged remission while continuing the therapy. Therefore, HAART should be considered first-line treatment for these patients, though they may require other concomitant treatments.<ref>{{cite doi |10.1056/NEJM200004063421407}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|16077928}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|20222338}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMoa055009}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.jaad.2008.05.001}}</ref>

== Classification ==
HHV-8 is responsible for all varieties of KS. Since Moritz Kaposi first described this malignant neoplasm, the disease has been reported in five separate clinical settings, with different presentations, epidemiology, and prognoses<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{Rp|599}}.  All of these forms are infected with [[Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus|KSHV]] and are different manifestations of the same disease but have differences in clinical aggressiveness, prognosis and treatment.

#[[Classic Kaposi sarcoma]]; as originally described was a relatively [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/indolent indolent] disease affecting elderly men from the [[Mediterranean]] region, or of Eastern European descent.  Countries bordering the Mediterranean basin have higher rates of KSHV/HHV-8 infection than the remainder of Europe <ref>{{cite journal |last=Iscovich |first=J |year=1998 |month=Oct 22|title=Classic Kaposi sarcoma in Jews living in Israel, 1961-1989: a population-based incidence study |journal=AIDS |volume=12 |issue=15 |pages=2067–72 |id= |url=http://www.aidsonline.com/pt/re/aids/abstract.00002030-199815000-00019.htm;jsessionid=Gy0NY0Y2b5lXKwJTGkQv1C1SdhTymxKmhpM4Hkrdvvz3pyXQ9GPV!-1804036389!-949856145!8091!-1 |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1097/00002030-199815000-00019 |pmid=9814876 |last2=Boffetta |first2=P |last3=Winkelmann |first3=R |last4=Brennan |first4=P |last5=Azizi |first5=E }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Fenig |first=E |year=1998 |month=October |title=Classic Kaposi sarcoma: experience at Rabin Medical Center in Israel |journal=Am J Clin Oncol |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=498–500 |id= |url=http://www.amjclinicaloncology.com/pt/re/ajco/abstract.00000421-199810000-00016.htm;jsessionid=Gy0Jys29KWqzWg4RWhQN9vCyvP3tMPn24WG35BQbdLHGlhJc1y7S!-1804036389!-949856145!8091!-1 |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1097/00000421-199810000-00016 |pmid=9781608 |last2=Brenner |first2=B |last3=Rakowsky |first3=E |last4=Lapidoth |first4=M |last5=Katz |first5=A |last6=Sulkes |first6=A }}</ref> 
#Endemic KS, which has two types, [[African cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma]] and [[African lymphadenopathic Kaposi sarcoma]] was described later in young [[African]] people, mainly from [[sub-Saharan Africa]], as a more aggressive disease that infiltrated the skin extensively, especially on the lower limbs. This, it should be noted, is not related to [[HIV]] infection.

#[[Immunosuppression-associated Kaposi sarcoma]] had been described, but only rarely until the advent of [[Immunosuppressive drug#Drugs acting on immunophilins|calcineurin inhibitors]] (such as [[ciclosporin]]es, which are inhibitors of [[T-cell]] function) for [[Organ transplant|transplant]] patients in the 1980s, when its incidence grew rapidly.  The tumor arises either when an HHV 8-infected organ is transplanted into someone who has not been exposed to the virus or when the transplant recipient already harbors pre-existing HHV 8 infection.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Qunibi |first=W | year =1998 |month=Feb 27 |title=Serologic association of human herpesvirus eight with posttransplant Kaposi sarcoma in Saudi Arabia |journal=Transplantation |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=583–5 |id= |url=http://www.transplantjournal.com/pt/re/transplantation/abstract.00007890-199802270-00024.htm;jsessionid=Gy4Gq82dl1t9ppllm80G1PDjkbpmqFFkp2ypLSLnW2DthLg22DcM!220059229!-949856144!8091!-1 |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1097/00007890-199802270-00024 |pmid=9500639 |last2=Al-Furayh |first2=O |last3=Almeshari |first3=K |last4=Lin |first4=SF |last5=Sun |first5=R |last6=Heston |first6=L |last7=Ross |first7=D |last8=Rigsby |first8=M |last9=Miller |first9=G }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Luppi |first=Mario | year=2000 |month=Nov 9 |title=Bone marrow failure associated with human herpesvirus 8 infection after transplantation |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=343 |issue=19 |pages=1378–85 |id= |doi= 10.1056/NEJM200011093431905 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=11070102 |last2= Barozzi |first2= P |last3= Schulz |first3= TF |last4= Setti |first4= G |last5= Staskus |first5= K |last6= Trovato |first6= R |last7= Narni |first7= F |last8= Donelli |first8= A |last9= Maiorana |first9= A }}</ref> 
#[[AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma]] or ''Epidemic KS'' was described during the 1980s as an aggressive disease in [[AIDS]] patients (HIV also causes a defect in T-cell immunity). It is over 300 times more common in AIDS patients than in renal transplant recipients. In this case, HHV 8 is sexually transmitted among people also at risk for sexually transmitted HIV infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Beral V, Peterman TA, Berkelman RL, Jaffe HW |title=Kaposi sarcoma among persons with AIDS: a sexually transmitted infection? |journal=Lancet |volume=335 |issue=8682 |pages=123–8 |year=1990 |month=January |pmid=1967430 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(90)90001-L |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0140-6736(90)90001-L}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
KS [[lesion]]s are nodules or blotches that may be red, purple, brown, or black, and are usually '''papular''' (in other words, palpable or raised).

They are typically found on the skin, but spread elsewhere is common, especially the mouth, [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[respiratory tract]]. Growth can range from very slow to explosively fast, and is associated with significant [[Mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dezube |first=BJ | year=1996 |month=October |title=Clinical presentation and natural history of AIDS--related Kaposi sarcoma |journal=Hematol Oncol Clin North Am |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=1023–9 |pmid=8880194 |doi=10.1016/S0889-8588(05)70382-8 }}</ref>

===Skin===
Commonly affected areas include the [[lower limbs]], back, face, mouth, and [[genitalia]]. The lesions are usually as described above, but may occasionally be [[Rash|plaque]]-like (often on the soles of the feet) or even involved in [[skin breakdown]] with resulting [[fungating lesion]]s.
Associated swelling may be from either local [[inflammation]] or [[lymphoedema]] (obstruction of local [[lymphatic vessels]] by the lesion). Skin lesions may be quite disfiguring for the sufferer, and a cause of much psychosocial pathology.

===Mouth===
[[File:Kaposi’s sarcoma intraoral AIDS 072 lores.jpg|thumb]] 
The mouth is involved in about 30% of cases, and is the initial site in 15% of AIDS-related KS. In the mouth, the [[hard palate]] is most frequently affected, followed by the [[gums]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nichols |first=CM | date=1 November 1993|title=Treating Kaposi lesions in the HIV-infected patient |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=124 |issue=11 |pages=78–84 |id= |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/abstract/124/11/78 |accessdate= 2007-06-11 |quote= |pmid=8227776 |author2=F |author3=H }}</ref> Lesions in the mouth may be easily damaged by chewing and bleed or suffer secondary infection, and even interfere with eating or speaking.

===Gastrointestinal tract===
Involvement can be common in those with transplant-related or AIDS-related KS, and it may occur in the absence of skin involvement. The gastrointestinal lesions may be silent or cause weight loss, pain, nausea/vomiting, [[diarrhea]], bleeding (either vomiting blood or passing it with bowel motions), [[malabsorption]], or [[intestinal obstruction]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Danzig |first=JB | year=1991 |month=June |title=Gastrointestinal malignancy in patients with AIDS |journal=Am J Gastroenterology  |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=715–8 |pmid=2038993 |last2=Brandt |first2=LJ |last3=Reinus |first3=JF |last4=Klein |first4=RS }}</ref>

===Respiratory tract===
Involvement of the airway can present with shortness of breath, [[fever]], [[cough]], [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up blood), or chest pain, or as an incidental finding on [[chest x-ray]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Garay |first=SM | year=1987 |month=January |title=Pulmonary manifestations of Kaposi sarcoma |journal=Chest |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 |id= |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/reprint/91/1/39 |accessdate= 2007-06-11 |quote= |doi=10.1378/chest.91.1.39 |pmid=3792084 |last2=Belenko |first2=M |last3=Fazzini |first3=E |last4=Schinella |first4=R }}</ref> The diagnosis is usually confirmed by [[bronchoscopy]] when the lesions are directly seen, and often biopsied.

==Pathology and diagnosis==
[[Image:Kaposi sarcoma high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a '''Kaposi sarcoma''' showing the characteristic spindle cells, high vascularity and intracellular hyaline globs. [[H&E stain]].]]
Despite its name, in general it is not considered a true [[sarcoma]], which is a tumor arising from [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal tissue]]. KS, in fact, arises as a [[cancer]] of [[lymphatic]] [[endothelium]] and forms vascular channels that fill with blood cells, giving the tumor its characteristic bruise-like appearance.  KSHV proteins are uniformly detected in KS cancer cells.

KS lesions contain tumor [[cell (biology)|cells]] with a characteristic abnormal elongated shape, called ''spindle cells''. The tumor is highly [[Blood vessel|vascular]], containing abnormally dense and irregular blood vessels, which leak red blood cells into the surrounding tissue and give the tumor its dark color. [[Inflammation]] around the tumor may produce swelling and pain.

Although KS may be suspected from the appearance of lesions and the patient's risk factors, definite diagnosis can be made only by [[biopsy]] and microscopic examination, which will show the presence of spindle cells.  Detection of the KSHV protein [[LANA]] in tumor cells confirms the diagnosis.

==Transmission==
In Europe and North America, KSHV is transmitted through saliva.  Thus, kissing is a theoretical risk factor for transmission.  Higher rates of transmission among gay and bisexual men have been attributed to "deep kissing" sexual partners with KSHV.<ref>http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/343/19/1369</ref>  Another alternative theory suggests that use of saliva as a sexual lubricant might be a major mode for transmission.  Prudent advice is to use commercial lubricants when needed and avoid deep kissing with partners with KSHV infection or whose status is unknown.

KSHV is transmissible during organ transplantation
<ref name="bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org">http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/90/7/2826</ref> and to a lesser extent through blood transfusion.<ref>http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/355/13/1331</ref> Testing for the virus before these procedures is likely to effectively limit [[iatrogenic]] transmission.

==Treatment and prevention==

Blood tests to detect antibodies against KSHV have been developed and can be used to determine whether a patient is at risk for transmitting infection to their sexual partner, or whether an organ is infected prior to transplantation.  However, these tests are not available except as research tools, and, thus, there is little screening for persons at risk for becoming infected with KSHV, such as transplant patients.

Kaposi sarcoma is not curable (in the usual sense of the word) but it can often be effectively palliated for many years and this is the aim of treatment.  In KS associated with [[immunodeficiency]] or immunosuppression, treating the cause of the immune system dysfunction can slow or stop the progression of KS. In 40% or more of patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma, the Kaposi lesions will shrink upon first starting highly active antiretroviral therapy ([[HAART]]).  However, in a certain percentage of such patients, Kaposi sarcoma may again grow after a number of years on HAART, especially if HIV is not completely suppressed. Patients with a few local lesions can often be treated with local measures such as radiation therapy or [[cryosurgery]].  In general, surgery is not recommended, as Kaposi sarcoma can appear in wound edges.  In general, more widespread disease, or disease affecting internal organs, is treated with systemic therapy with [[interferon]] alpha, liposomal anthracyclines (such as Doxil) or [[paclitaxel]]. 
 
With the decrease in the death rate among AIDS patients receiving new treatments in the 1990s, the incidence and severity of epidemic KS also decreased. However, the number of patients living with AIDS is increasing substantially in the United States, and it is possible that the number of patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma will again rise as these patients live longer with HIV infection.

==Awareness==
It has been reported that only 6% of men who have sex with men are aware that KS is caused by a virus different from HIV.<ref name="Phillips AM, Jones AG, Osmond DH, Pollack LM, Catania JA, Martin JN 2008"/> Thus, there is little community effort to prevent KSHV infection.  Likewise, no systematic screening of organ donations is in place.  

In AIDS patients, Kaposi sarcoma is considered an [[opportunistic infection]], a disease that is able to gain a foothold in the body because the [[immune system]] has been weakened. With the rise of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]], where KSHV is widespread, KS has become the most frequently reported cancer in some countries. 

Nigerian bandleader [[Fela Kuti]] succumbed to the disease in 1997. Classic Kaposi Sarcoma (CKS) is a variant of Kaposi sarcoma which is found in Jews, Arabs, and other non HIV infected people.<ref>Kumar P. Classic Kaposi sarcoma in Arabs - Widening ethnic involvement. J Can Res Ther [serial online] 2011 [cited 2012 Apr 22];7:92-4. Available from: http://www.cancerjournal.net/text.asp?2011/7/1/92/80456</ref>–

Because of their highly visible nature, external lesions are sometimes the presenting symptom of AIDS. Kaposi sarcoma entered the awareness of the general public with the release of the film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', in which the main character was fired after his employers found out he was HIV-positive due to visible lesions. By the time KS lesions appear, it is likely that the immune system has already been severely weakened.
