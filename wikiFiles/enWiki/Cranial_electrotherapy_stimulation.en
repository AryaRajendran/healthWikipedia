'''Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation''' ('''CES''') is a psychiatric treatment that applies a small, pulsed electric current across a patient's head. Some researchers<ref name=Smith>Smith RB, Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation: Its First Fifty Years</ref> and doctors<ref>"Columbia University Psychiatry Professors Prescribe Fisher Wallace Cranial Stimulator to Over 250 Patients." (24 Feb 2010) PR Newswire. http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/columbia-university-psychiatry-professors-prescribe-fisher-wallace-cranial-stimulator-to-over-250-patients-85189817.html</ref> claim that CES has beneficial effects in conditions such as [[anxiety]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[insomnia]] and [[Stress (biology)|stress]]. However, its effectiveness is still being studied.,<ref name=Klawansky/><ref name=Barrett/> and is thus an experimental<ref name=FDA_CFR/> treatment.

==History==
"[[Electrotherapy]]" has been in use for at least 2000 years, as shown by the clinical literature of the early [[Roman era|Roman]] [[physician]], [[Scribonius Largus]], who wrote in the ''Compositiones Medicae'' of 46 AD that his patients should stand on a live black [[torpedo fish]] for the relief of a variety of medical conditions, including gout and headaches.  [[Claudius Galen]] (131 - 201 AD) also recommended using the shocks from the electrical fish for medical therapies.<ref>Stillings D.

Low intensity electrical stimulation is believed to have originated in the studies of galvanic currents in humans and animals as conducted by [[Giovanni Aldini]], [[Alessandro Volta]] and others in the 18th century.<ref name=Zaghi>Zaghi S, Acar M, Hultgren B, Boggio PS, Fregni F. (2009). Noninvasive brain stimulation with low-intensity electrical currents: putative mechanisms of action for direct and alternating current stimulation. The Neuroscientist</ref> Aldini had experimented with galvanic head current as early as 1794 (upon himself) and reported the successful treatment of patients suffering from melancholia using direct low-intensity currents in 1804.<ref name=Zaghi/>

Modern research into low intensity electrical stimulation of the brain was begun by Leduc and Rouxeau in France (1902).<ref>Leduc S. La narcose electrique. Ztschr. fur Electrother., 1903, XI, 1: 374-381, 403-410.</ref><ref>Leduc S., Rouxeau A.

Pergamon Press</ref> In 1949, the Soviet Union expanded research of CES to include the treatment of [[anxiety]] as well as [[sleeping disorder]]s.<ref>Гиляровский В.А., Ливенцев Н.М., Сегаль Ю.Е., Кириллова З.А.

In the 1960s and 1970s, it was common for physicians and researchers to place electrodes on the eyes, thinking that any other electrode site would not be able to penetrate the [[Human skull|cranium]]. It was later found that placing electrodes on the earlobes was far more convenient, and quite effective.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.4088/JCP.v69n0311|author=Bystritsky, A, Kerwin, L and Feusner, J | title=A pilot study of cranial electrotherapy stimulation for generalized anxiety disorder | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume=69 | pages=412–417 | year=2008|pmid=18348596|issue=3}}</ref>

CES was initially studied for insomnia <ref>Appel, C. P. (1972). Effect of electrosleep: Review of research. Goteborg Psychology Report, 2, 1-24</ref> and called '''electrosleep therapy''';<ref name="doi|10.1300/J184v09n02_02">{{doi|10.1300/J184v09n02_02}}</ref> it is also known as '''Cranial-Electro Stimulation''' <ref>Iwanovsky, A., & Dodge, C. H. (1968). Electrosleep and electroanesthesia–theory and
clinical experience. Foreign Science Bulletin, 4 (2), 1-64</ref> and '''Transcranial Electrotherapy'''.<ref>{{doi|10.1007/s11940-008-0040-y}}</ref>

In 1972,  a specific form of CES was developed by Dr. Margaret Patterson,<ref>Dr. Margaret A. Patterson. Effects of Neuro-Electric Therapy (N.E.T.) In Drug Addiction: Interim Report. Bull Narc. 1976 Oct-Dec;28(4):55-62. PubMed PMID 1087892.</ref><ref>Patterson MA. Electrotherapy: addictions and neuroelectric therapy. Nurs Times. 1979 Nov 29;75(48):2080-3. PubMed PMID 316129.</ref> providing small pulses of electric current across the head to ameliorate the effects of acute and chronic withdrawal from addictive substances. She named her treatment "'''NeuroElectric Therapy (NET)'''".

==Effectiveness==
Soroush Zaghi et al. published an article in the journal The Neuroscientist, finding that CES increases the production of serotonin, GABA, and endorphins.<ref>Soroush Zaghi, Mariana Acar, Brittney  Hultgren, Paulo S. Boggio, and Felipe Fregni. " Noninvasive Brain Stimulation  with Low-Intensity Electrical Currents:  Putative Mechanisms of Action for Direct  and Alternating Current Stimulation." Neuroscientist. 2010 Jun;16(3):285-307</ref> These neurochemical changes explain any positive effects that might be experienced from CES.

A 1995 meta-analysis by Klawansky et al. published in Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease "showed CES to be significantly more effective than sham treatment (p < .05)", but noted that 86% of the studies included in the review were inadequately [[double-blind|blinded]] and the experimenter "knew which patients were receiving CES or sham treatment."<ref name=Klawansky>{{cite journal|author=Sidney Klawansky|url=http://www.jonmd.com/pt/re/jnmd/abstract.00005053-199507000-00010.htm| title=Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials of Cranial Electrostimulation: Efficacy in Treating Selected Psychological and Physiological Conditions | journal=Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease | volume=183 | issue=7 |pages=478–484 |date=July 1995}}</ref> Most studies cited as evidence for the effectiveness of CES failed to report all data necessary for meta-analysis.<ref name=Klawansky/><ref name=Barrett>{{cite web|title=Dubious Claims Made for NutriPax and Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation|author=Stephen Barrett, M.D.|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ces.html|date=January 28, 2008|publisher=QuackWatch}}</ref>

Computer modeling predictions using a highly detailed anatomical model show that CES induces significant currents in cortical, sub-cortical structures like thalamus,insula,and hypothalamus, and brain-stem structures.<ref name=Datta>Datta, A., Dmochowski, J.P.,Guleyupoglu, B.,Bikson, M., Fregni, F.(2012) Cranial electrotherapy stimulation and transcranial pulsed current stimulation:A computer based high-resolution modeling study.Neuroimage.</ref>    

A bibliography by Kirsch (2002) <ref>Kirsch, D. L. (2002). The science behind cranial electrotherapy stimulation. Edmonton, Alberta: Medical Scope Publishing</ref> listed 126 scientific studies of CES involving human subjects and 29 animal studies.<ref name="doi|10.1300/J184v09n02_02"/>  An estimated 145 human studies have been completed, encompassing over 8800 people receiving active CES.<ref>Kirsch, Daniel L., "Science Behind Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation", 2nd edition, 2002</ref>

A study published in Journal of Cognitive Rehabilitation found that 86% of the subjects tested showed improvements in their depression, 86% in state anxiety, and 90% in trait anxiety. An 18 month follow up found 18 of the original 23 subjects available to return for testing. Overall, they performed as well or better than in the original study.<ref>Smith, Ray B, "Cranial electrotherapy stimulation in the treatment of stress related cognitive dysfunction, with an eighteen month follow up." Journal of Cognitive Rehabilitation, 17(6):14-18, 1999.</ref>

A pilot study showed that CES reduced the symptom burden of generalized anxiety disorder, with a decrease in [[Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale]] (HARS) across a 6 week study, but the study had a small sample of participants and no [[control group]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bystritsky, Alexander, Kerwin, Lauren and Feusner, Jamie. | title=A pilot study of cranial electrotherapy stimulation for generalized anxiety disorder. | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume=69 | pages=412–417 | year=2008 url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18348596 | doi=10.4088/JCP.v69n0311 | pmid=18348596}}</ref> 

A meta-analysis of eight randomly controlled trial studies assessing the efficacy of CES on anxiety found that CES improved anxiety significantly as compared with placebo/sham treatment.<ref name=Klawansky/>

A systematic review which assessed 34 controlled trials involving a total of 767 CES patients and 867 control patients reported that in 77% of studies (26 of 34), CES was found to significantly reduce anxiety.<ref>De Felice EA.

==Regulation==
In the United States, CES technology is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as Class III medical devices and must be dispensed by or on the order of a licensed healthcare practitioners, i.e. a  physician, psychiatrist or nurse practitioner; psychologists, physician assistants, and occupational therapists who have an appropriate electrotherapy license may prescribe CES, dependent upon state regulations.<ref name=FDA_CFR>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=882.5800 21CFR882.5800, Part 882 ("Neurological Devices")]</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/3132.html#class_3 FDA medical device classifications]</ref>

As a result of the 1976 Medical Device Amendments, CES was placed in Class III by the FDA. Manufacturers who prove both safety and efficacy may enter the market, with FDA clearance, utilizing the 510(k) process instead of the premarket approval process, at this time.

==Proposed mechanism of action==
The exact mechanism of action of CES remains unclear but it is proposed that CES reduces the stress that underpins many emotional disorders.<ref name=Smith/> The proposed mechanism of action for CES is that the pulses of electric current increase the ability of neural cells to produce serotonin, dopamine DHEA endorphins and other neurotransmitters stabilizing the neurohormonal system.<ref name=Gilula>Gilula MF, Kirsch DL. (2005). Cranial electrotherapy stimulation review: a safer alternative to psychopharmaceuticals in the treatment of depression. ''[[Journal of Neurotherapy]]'', 9(2), 63-77.</ref>

It has been proposed <ref>Gilula, M.F. & Kirsch, D.L.  Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation Review: A Safer Alternative to Psychopharmaceuticals in the Treatment of Depression. Journal of Neurotherapy, Vol. 9(2) 2005. {{doi|10.1300/J184v09n02_02}}</ref>  that during CES, an [[electric current]] is focused upon the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic region]]; during this process, CES [[electrode]]s are placed on the ear at the [[mastoid]], near to the face. Computer modeling suggest that current of similar magnitudes maybe induced in both cortical and sub-cortical regions.<ref name=Datta/> The prediction that CES induced current intensities in the sub-cortical structures are not sufficiently decreased from the cortical structures is potentially clinically meaningful.   

It has been suggested that the current results in an increase of the brain's levels of [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]], and a decrease in its level of [[cortisol]]. After a CES treatment, users are in an "alert, yet relaxed" state, characterized by increased alpha and decreased [[Delta wave|delta]] [[Neural oscillation|brain wave]]s as seen on EEG.<ref>Kennerly, Richard. QEEG analysis of cranial electrotherapy: a pilot study. Journal of Neurotherapy (8)2, 2004.</ref>
