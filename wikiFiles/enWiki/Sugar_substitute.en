A '''sugar substitute''' is a [[food additive]] that duplicates the effect of [[sugar]] in [[taste]], usually with less [[food energy]]. Some sugar substitutes are natural and some are synthetic. Those that are not natural are, in general, called '''artificial sweeteners.'''

An important class of sugar substitutes are known as ''high-intensity sweeteners''. These are compounds with many times the sweetness of [[sucrose]], common table sugar. As a result, much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often [[negligible]]. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds (the "sweetness profile") is sometimes notably different from sucrose, so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most natural sweet sensation.

If the sucrose (or other sugar) that is replaced has contributed to the texture of the product, then a bulking agent is often also needed. This may be seen in [[soft drink]]s that are labeled as "diet" or "light" and contain artificial sweeteners and often have notably different [[mouthfeel]], or in table sugar replacements that mix [[maltodextrin]]s with an intense sweetener to achieve satisfactory texture sensation.

In the United States, six intensely sweet sugar substitutes have been approved for use. They are [[stevia]], [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], [[neotame]], [[acesulfame potassium]], and [[saccharin]]. There is some ongoing controversy over whether artificial sweetener usage poses health risks. The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates artificial sweeteners as food additives.<ref>FDA No Calories... Sweet! [http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2006/406_sweeteners.html fda.gov]</ref> Food additives must be approved by the FDA, which publishes a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list of additives.<ref>{{cite web |title=US FDA Website Guidance Documents |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/grasguid.html#Q1 |publisher=cfsan.fda.gov}}</ref> To date, the FDA has not been presented with scientific information that would support a change in conclusions about the safety of these approved high-intensity sweeteners (with the exception of Stevia, which is exempt under FDA's GRAS policy due to its being a natural substance in wide use well before 1958, and has been approved by FDA). The safe conclusions are based on a detailed review of a large body of information, including hundreds of toxicological and clinical studies.<ref>{{cite web |title=FDA's response to European Aspartame Study |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01369.html |publisher=fda.gov}}</ref>

The majority of sugar substitutes approved for food use are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including [[sorbitol]] and [[xylitol]], which are found in [[berry|berries]], [[fruit]], [[vegetable]]s, and [[mushroom]]s. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic [[hydrogenation]] of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, [[xylose]] is converted to xylitol, [[lactose]] to [[lactitol]], and [[glucose]] to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but are yet to gain official approval for food use.

Some non-sugar sweeteners are ''[[polyol]]s'', also known as "[[sugar alcohol]]s".  These are, in general, less sweet than sucrose but have similar bulk properties and can be used in a wide range of food products. Sometimes the sweetness profile is 'fine-tuned' by mixing with high-intensity sweeteners. As with all food products, the development of a formulation to replace sucrose is a complex proprietary process.

==Reasons for use==
Sugar substitutes are used for a number of reasons, including:

*To assist in [[weight loss]] &ndash; some people choose to limit their food energy intake by replacing high-energy sugar or corn syrup with other sweeteners having little or no [[food energy]]. This allows them to eat the same foods they normally would, while allowing them to lose weight and avoid other problems associated with excessive caloric intake.
*[[Dental care]] &ndash; sugar substitutes are [[tooth-friendly]], as they are not fermented by the [[microflora]] of the dental plaque.  An example of a sweetener that can benefit dental health is [[xylitol]]. Xylitol works to prevent bacteria from adhering to the tooth surface, thus preventing plaque formation and eventually decay.  The carbohydrates and sugars consumed usually adheres to the tooth enamel.  Bacteria can feed upon this food source allowing them to quickly multiply.  As the bacteria feed upon the sugar, they convert it to acid waste that in turn decays the tooth structure. Xylitol cannot be fermented by these bacteria, so the bacteria have difficulty thriving, thus helping to prevent plaque formation.<ref>{{cite web |last=C |year=2010 |title= Unique Sweetener Supports Oral health|url= http://www.vrp.com/xylitol/xylitol-a-sweet-alternative-unique-sweetener-supports-oral-health |publisher=vrp.com}}</ref>
*[[Diabetes mellitus]] &ndash; people with diabetes have difficulty regulating their [[blood sugar]] levels. By limiting their sugar intake with artificial sweeteners, they can enjoy a varied diet while closely controlling their sugar intake. Also, some sugar substitutes do release energy, but are metabolized more slowly, allowing blood sugar levels to remain more stable over time.
*[[Reactive hypoglycemia]] &ndash; individuals with reactive hypoglycemia will produce an excess of insulin after quickly absorbing glucose into the bloodstream. This causes their blood glucose levels to fall below the amount needed for proper body and brain function. As a result, like diabetics, they must avoid intake of [[Glycemic|high-glycemic]] foods like white bread, and often choose artificial sweeteners as an alternative.
*Avoiding processed foods &ndash; individuals may opt to substitute refined white sugar with less-processed sugars, such as fruit juice or maple syrup. (See [[List of unrefined sweeteners]]).
*Cost &ndash; many sugar substitutes are cheaper than sugar.  Alternative sweeteners are often low in cost because of their long shelf-life and high sweetening intensity. This allows alternative sweeteners to be used in products that will not perish after a short period of time.<ref>Coultate, T. (2009). Food: The chemistry of its components.

==Health issues==

===Weight gain and insulin response to artificial sweeteners===
Animal studies have indicated that a sweet taste induces an insulin response in rats.<ref name=Jang2007>{{Cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0706890104}}</ref>  However, the extension of animal model findings to humans is unclear, as human studies of intragastric infusion of [[sucralose]] have shown no insulin response from analogous taste receptors.<ref name=Ma2009>{{Cite doi|10.1152/ajpgi.90708.2008}}</ref>  The release of [[insulin]] causes blood sugar to be stored in tissues (including fat).  In the case of a response to artificial sweeteners, because blood sugar does not increase there can be increased [[hypoglycemia]] or [[hyperinsulinemia]] and increased food intake the next time there is a meal. Rats given sweeteners have steadily increased calorie intake, increased body weight, and increased adiposity (fatness).<ref name="Jang2007" /> Furthermore, the natural responses to eating sugary foods (eating less at the next meal and using some of the extra calories to warm the body after the sugary meal) are gradually lost.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Swithers SE, Davidson TL|title=A role for sweet taste: calorie predictive relations in energy regulation by rats|journal=Behav Neurosci|year=2008|volume=122|issue=1|pages=161–73|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.122.1.161|pmid=18298259}}</ref>

A 2005 study by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio showed that increased weight gain and [[obesity]] were associated with increased use of diet soda in a population-based study. The study did not establish whether increased weight gain leads to increased consumption of diet drinks or whether consumption of diet drinks could have an effect on weight gain.<ref>DeNoon, Daniel J.

Overweight Risk Soars 41% With Each Daily Can of Diet Soft Drink"], WebMD Medical News (2005), accessed 2007-06-25</ref>

==Food industry usage of artificial sweeteners==
The food and beverage industry is increasingly replacing sugar or [[corn syrup]] with artificial sweeteners in a range of products traditionally containing sugar.

According to market analysts [[Mintel]], a total of 3,920 products containing artificial sweeteners were launched in the U.S. between 2000 and 2005. In 2004 alone, 1,649 artificially sweetened products were launched. According to market analysts Freedonia, the [[United States]] artificial sweetener market is set to grow at around 8% per year to $189 million in 2012.<ref>[http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news-by-product/news.asp?id=63947&idCat=88&k=sugar-demand-rising Sugar demand rising at expense of sweeteners, claims sugar industry]</ref>

Aspartame is currently the most popular artificial sweetener in the U.S. food industry, as the price has dropped significantly since the [[Monsanto Company]] patent expired in 1992. However, sucralose may soon replace it, as alternative processes to [[Tate & Lyle]]'s patent seem to be emerging. According to Morgan Stanley, this can mean that the price of sucralose will drop by thirty percent.<ref>[http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news/ng.asp?id=65046 Sucralose breakthrough could smash Tate & Lyle monopoly]</ref>

Alternative sweeteners are highly consumed in America. According to research studies explained by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, in 2003-2004, Americans two years of age and older consumed 585g per day of beverages and 375g per day of foods with caloric sweeteners. More than 66% of Americans consumed these beverages with alternative sweeteners and 82.3% of Americans consumed foods with added caloric sweeteners.  On the other hand, 10.8% of Americans in 2003-2004 consumed non-caloric alternative sweetener flavored beverages and 5.8% consumed non-caloric alternative sweetener flavored foods.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mattes R.D., Popkin B.M. | year = 2009 | title = Nonnutritive sweetener consumption in humans: effects on appetite and food intake and their putative mechanisms | url = | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 89 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 | doi = 10.39451ajcn.2008.26792 }}</ref>

Some commonly consumed foods with alternative sweeteners are diet sodas, cereals, and sugar-free desserts such as ice cream.  Alternative sweeteners are found in many products today due to their low or non-caloric characteristics.  This can be used as a method of advertisement for dieters or those conscious of their sugar intake.  Those with diabetes can greatly benefit from alternative sweeteners that do not affect their blood sugar levels drastically.  This aids in maintaining low insulin use in the body and blood sugar levels.<ref>Mela, D. (ed.). (2005). Food, diet and obesity. Cambridge, England: Woodhead Publishing Limited.</ref> Alternative sweeteners such as xylitol and saccharin have many positive research results that show qualities of dental decay prevention.<ref>Coultate, T.

==Sugar substitutes commonly used in food==

===Aspartame ===
{{Main|Aspartame}}
{{See also|Aspartame controversy}}
Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the [[G.D. Searle]] company (later purchased by Monsanto). He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed that it had a sweet taste. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids [[aspartic acid]] and [[phenylalanine]]. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and can be used as a tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, [[beverage]]s, and [[chewing gum]].  When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids.  This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks.  Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original [[amino acid]]s.  Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.

The safety of aspartame has been studied extensively since its discovery with research that includes animal studies, clinical and epidemiological research, and post-marketing surveillance,<ref name=EFSAExperts>{{cite web | last = EFSA National Experts | title = Report of the meetings on aspartame with national experts | publisher = EFSA |date = May 2010| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/af100423.pdf | accessdate = 22 September 2010}}</ref> with aspartame being one of the most rigorously tested food ingredients to date.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Mitchell | first = Helen | title = Sweeteners and sugar alternatives in food technology | place = Oxford, UK | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2006 | page = 94| isbn = 1-4051-3434-8 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Cyclamate===
{{Main|Cyclamate}}
In the [[United States]], the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) banned the sale of [[cyclamate]] in 1970 after lab tests in rats involving a 10:1 mixture of cyclamate and saccharin indicated that large amounts of cyclamates causes [[urinary bladder|bladder]] [[cancer]], a disease to which [[rat]]s are particularly susceptible. Cyclamates are still used as sweeteners in many parts of the world, including Europe.

===Saccharin===
[[File:Süßstoff Saccharin Zucker-Museum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Saccharin, historical wrapping; [[Sugar Museum (Berlin)]]]]

{{Main|Saccharin}}
Aside from [[sugar of lead]], [[saccharin]] was the first artificial sweetener and was originally synthesized in 1879 by Remsen and Fahlberg. Its sweet taste was discovered by accident. It had been created in an experiment with toluene derivatives. A process for the creation of saccharin from [[phthalic anhydride]] was developed in 1950, and, currently, saccharin is created by this process as well as the original process by which it was discovered. It is 300 to 500 times as sweet as sugar (sucrose) and is often used to improve the taste of toothpastes, dietary foods, and dietary beverages. The bitter aftertaste of saccharin is often minimized by blending it with other sweeteners.

Fear about saccharin increased when a 1960 study showed that high levels of saccharin may cause [[bladder cancer]] in laboratory rats. In 1977, [[Canada]] banned saccharin due to the animal research. In the United States, the FDA considered banning saccharin in 1977, but Congress stepped in and placed a moratorium on such a ban. The moratorium required a warning label and also mandated further study of saccharin safety.

Subsequently, it was discovered that saccharin causes cancer in male rats by a mechanism not found in humans. At high doses, saccharin causes a precipitate to form in rat urine. This precipitate damages the cells lining the bladder (urinary bladder urothelial cytotoxicity) and a [[tumor]] forms when the cells regenerate (regenerative hyperplasia). According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], part of the [[World Health Organization]], "Saccharin and its salts was (sic) downgraded from Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans, to Group 3, not classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans, despite sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity to animals, because it is carcinogenic by a non-DNA-reactive mechanism that is not relevant to humans because of critical interspecies differences in urine composition."

In 2001 the United States repealed the warning label requirement, while the threat of an FDA ban had already been lifted in 1991. Most other countries also permit saccharin, but restrict the levels of use, while other countries have outright banned it.

The EPA has officially removed saccharin and its salts from their list of hazardous constituents and commercial chemical products. In a December 14, 2010, release the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.

===Stevia===
{{Main|Stevia}}
[[File:Stevia-tablets-as-sold-in-Germany-September-2010.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stevia tablets as sold in health food stores in [[Germany]] (EU) in September 2010 (while Stevia is still technically "illegal"). Note the German description reads "Stevia is not a comestible [food] following current [[European Union]] regulations", while the French description simply says "Stevia" (which is legally sold as food in France).]]

Stevia has been widely used as a natural sweetener in South America for centuries and in Japan since 1970.  Due to its unique characteristics of zero [[glycemic index]] and zero calories,<ref>[http://www.steviainfo.com/?page=about steviainfo.com]</ref> it is fast becoming popular in many other countries. In 1987, the FDA issued a ban on stevia because it had not been approved as a food additive.<ref>[http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2008/mar/20080323puls010.asp Sweet on Stevia: Sugar Substitute Gains Fans], ''Columbia Daily Tribune'', 23 March 2008</ref> After being repeatedly provided with a significant amount of scientific data proving that there was no side effect of using stevia as a sweetener from companies such as Cargill and Coca-Cola, the FDA gave a "no objection" approval for [[generally recognized as safe|GRAS]] status in December 2008 to [[Truvia]], a blend of [[rebiana]] and [[erythritol]]<ref>[http://livefitblog.com/2008/10/13/just-tried-new-artificial-sweetener-made-from-stevia-truvia/ New Artificial Sweetener]</ref> (developed by [[Cargill]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]]), as well as [[PureVia]] (developed by [[PepsiCo]] and the Whole Earth Sweetener Company, a subsidiary of [[Merisant]]),<ref>{{cite news

both of which use rebaudioside A derived from the Stevia plant.

===Sucralose===
{{Main|Sucralose}}
[[Sucralose]] is a chlorinated sugar that is about 600 times as sweet as sugar. It is produced from sucrose when three chlorine atoms replace three [[hydroxyl group]]s. It is used in beverages, frozen desserts, chewing gum, baked goods, and other foods. Unlike other artificial sweeteners, it is stable when heated and can therefore be used in baked and fried goods. About 15% of sucralose is absorbed by the body and most of it passes out of the body unchanged.<ref name=Daniel>{{cite journal |author=Daniel JW, Renwick AG, Roberts A, Sims J |title=The metabolic fate of sucralose in rats |journal=[[Food Chem Toxicol]] |year=2000 |volume=38 |issue=S2 |pages=S115–S121 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(00)00034-X}}</ref> The FDA approved sucralose in 1998.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00859.html FDA approves new high-intensity sweetener sucralose]</ref>

Most of the controversy surrounding [[Splenda]], a sucralose sweetener, is focused not on safety, but on its marketing. It has been marketed with the slogan, "Splenda is made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar." Sucralose is prepared from either of two sugars, sucrose or [[raffinose]]. With either base sugar, processing replaces three oxygen-hydrogen groups in the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms.<ref name=livescience>[http://www.livescience.com/health/070515_bad_sugar.html Bitter Battle over Truth in Sweeteners]</ref>

The "Truth About Splenda" website was created in 2005 by The Sugar Association, an organization representing sugar beet and sugar cane farmers in the United States,<ref>[http://www.truthaboutsplenda.com Truth About Splenda], Sugar Association website</ref> to provide its view of sucralose. In December 2004, five separate false-advertising claims were filed by the Sugar Association against Splenda manufacturers Merisant and McNeil Nutritionals for claims made about Splenda related to the slogan, "Made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar". French courts ordered the slogan to no longer be used in France, while in the U.S. the case came to an undisclosed settlement during the trial.<ref name=livescience/>

There are few safety concerns pertaining to sucralose<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19464334 | year = 2009 | last1 = Grotz | first1 = VL | last2 = Munro | first2 = IC | title = An overview of the safety of sucralose | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2009.05.011 | journal = Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP}}</ref> and the way sucralose is [[metabolism|metabolized]] suggests a reduced risk of toxicity. For example, sucralose is extremely insoluble in fat and thus does not accumulate in fatty tissues; sucralose also does not break down and will dechlorinate only under conditions that are not found during regular digestion (i.e. high heat applied to the powder form of the molecule).<ref name=Daniel/>

===Lead acetate (historic)===
{{Main|Lead(II) acetate}}
[[Lead(II) acetate|Lead acetate]] (sometimes called ''sugar of lead'') is an artificial sugar substitute made from [[lead]] that is of historical interest because of its widespread use in the past, such as by [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. The use of lead acetate as a sweetener eventually produced [[lead poisoning]] in any individual ingesting it habitually. Lead acetate was abandoned as a food additive throughout most of the world after the high toxicity of lead compounds became apparent.

===Mogrosides===
More recently, [[mogroside]]s (typically extracted from [[monk fruit]]) have been used in commercial products after the FDA granted some of the compounds [[GRAS]] status in 2010.<ref name="O'Brien-Nabors2011">{{cite book|author=Lyn O'Brien-Nabors|title=Alternative Sweeteners|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=coDPwzFX7rAC&pg=PA226|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-4614-8|pages=226–227}}</ref><ref name="Wilson2011">Rachel Wilson (July 26, 2011), ''[http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/articles/2011/07/new-and-emerging-opportunities-for-plant-derived-sweeteners.aspx New and Emerging Opportunities for Plant-Derived Sweeteners], Natural Products Insider</ref> As of 2011, it is not (yet) a permitted sweetener in the EU, although it is allowed as a natural flavor at concentrations where it does not function as a sweetener.<ref name="Wilson2011"/><ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/chinese-monk-fruit-latest-allnatural-sweetener-to-make-waves-2266598.html Chinese monk fruit latest all-natural sweetener to make waves], [[The Independent]], 12 April 2011</ref> Some of the products incorporating it are [[Nestlé]]'s [[Milo (chocolate bar)|Milo]] in Asia and certain [[Kellogg Company|Kellog]] cereals in the US.<ref name="Adams2012"/> It is also the basis of [[McNeil Nutritionals]]'s tabletop sweetener Nectresse in the US.<ref name="Adams2012"/> As of 2012, the [[New Zealand]] company BioVittoria provides more than 90 percent of the global supply of monk fruit extract; its main manufacturing facility for the product is in [[Guilin]], China.<ref name="Adams2012">Christopher Adams (Aug 28, 2012), [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10829886 US launch sweet news for kiwi supplier], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''</ref>

== List of sugar substitutes and their relative sweetness to sugar ==
The three primary [[chemical compound|compounds]] used as sugar substitutes in the United States are [[saccharin]] (e.g., ''Sweet'N Low''), [[aspartame]] (e.g., ''Equal'','' NutraSweet'') and [[sucralose]] (e.g., ''Splenda'','' Altern''). [[Maltitol]] and [[sorbitol]] are often used, frequently in toothpaste, mouth wash, and in foods such as "no sugar added" ice cream. [[Erythritol]] is gaining momentum as a replacement for these other sugar alcohols in foods as it is much less likely to produce gastrointestinal distress when consumed in large amounts. In many other countries [[xylitol]], [[cyclamate]] and the herbal sweetener [[stevia]] are used extensively.
