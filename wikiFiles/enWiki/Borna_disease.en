'''Borna disease''' is an infectious [[neurological]] syndrome<ref name="pmid17522214">{{cite journal |author=Ackermann A, Staeheli P, Schneider U |title=Adaptation of Borna disease virus to new host species attributed to altered regulation of viral polymerase activity |journal=J.

The causative agent of Borna disease, [[Borna disease virus]] (BDV) is a [[neurotropic]] [[virus]] and is a member of the ''Bornaviridae'' family within the ''[[Mononegavirales]]'' order. 
Although the Borna disease virus is mainly seen as the causative agent of borna disease in [[horse]]s and other animals, recent findings have implicated that borna virus may play a role in some human neurological and psychiatric conditions including [[bipolar disorder]] and depression.

BDV also infects humans and is therefore considered to be a [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] agent. The role of BDV in human illness is controversial and it is yet to be established whether BDV causes any overt disease in humans. However, correlative evidence exists linking BDV infection with neuropsychiatric disorders such as [[bipolar disorder]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/1998-08-31/health/9808_31_depression.virus_1_virus-depression-horses?_s=PM:HEALTH |publisher=CNN Health |author="(Quoted) Liv Bode - Robert Koch Institute, Ron Ferszt - Free University of Berlin" |title=Research suggests virus may play role in depression |date=August 31, 1998}}</ref>

Avian Bornaviruses (ABV), a group of related viruses, have recently been reported, yet not proven, as the cause of [[Proventricular Dilatation Disease, PDD]], a disease of pet parrots. The use of a 'positive' brain cell culture containing ABV to inoculate another psittacine (parrot) bird resulted in the inoculated bird's death and subsequent histopathological diagnosis of PDD (mononuclear infiltrative ganglioneuritis. Interestingly earlier research with purified inoculant of ABV(while did result in the death of parrots) did not reproduce histopathological changes associated with PDD. 

Sadly, there have been several parrots tested positive for ABV without clinical signs of PDD that were prematurely euthanized and revealed no such histopathological tissue changes.  Additionally some parrots with clinical signs of PDD have been tested negative for ABV and have later died within weeks of testing. These parrots that had clinical signs of PDD, that tested negative for ABV, were then subsequently diagnosed with PDD on histopathology.  In summary Avian Bornavirus should not be referred to the cause of Proventricultar Dilation Disease in psittacines, it is of questionable value to test any psittacine bird for ABV, and the only definitive diagnosis of a live parrot for PDD is a crop biopsy with histopathology.  Of great importance is that any parrot tested positive for ABV should be retested 90 days later, and persistently ABV positive parrots should be considered as immunocomprimised. PDD is one yet not the only such disease possibly associated with an immunocomprised state. 

Thankfully, many parrots with signs of PDD have made apparently full recovery with the veterinary use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's), yet should be considered a potential infective source of PDD for other parrots.

== Epidemiology ==

=== Vectors ===

The mode of transmission of BDV is unclear but probably occurs through intranasal exposure to contaminated [[saliva]] or nasal secretions. Following infection, individuals may develop Borna disease, or may remain subclinical, possibly acting as a carrier of the virus.

=== Animals ===

Borna virus appears to have a wide host range, having been detected in [[horse]]s, [[cow|cattle]], [[sheep]], [[dog]]s and [[fox]]es. In 1995, the virus was isolated from [[cat]]s suffering from a "staggering disease" in [[Sweden]]. Since that time, the virus has also been detected in cats in [[Japan]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

Borna virus has been detected in humans, and researchers have presented evidence connecting these infections with [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] disorders.<ref name="pmid12857781"/><ref name="pmid2244211"/><ref name="pmid2069502"/>

Experimental infection of [[rat]]s has been demonstrated to lead to learning impairments and altered social behaviour. The virus appears to be distributed primarily in the [[limbic system]] of the brain, including the [[hippocampus]] and [[entorhinal cortex]]. These areas of the brain are considered to be of importance in [[emotion]].

Originally identified in [[sheep]] and [[horse]]s<ref name="pmid11944803">{{cite journal |author=Dauphin G, Legay V, Pitel PH, Zientara S |title=Borna disease: current knowledge and virus detection in France |journal=Vet.

The name is derived from the town of [[Borna, Leipzig|Borna]] in [[Saxony]], [[Germany]], which suffered an epidemic of the disease in horses in 1885.

Borna disease in sheep and horses arises after a four week incubation period followed by the development of immune-mediated [[meningitis]] and [[encephalomyelitis]]. Clinical manifestations vary but may include excited or depressed behaviour, [[ataxia]], ocular disorders and abnormal posture and movement. Mortality rates are 80-100% in horses and greater than 50% in sheep.

Borna disease in the horse gives rise to signs like:

* Unusual posture, gait and ear positions
* Movement Disturbances (principally [[ataxia]] or excess movement)

== History ==

The first antibodies to Borna virus in humans were discovered in the mid-1980s. Since then, there have been conflicting results from various studies in regards to whether an association exists between the agent and clinical disease. Antibodies to Borna virus, which indicate prior infection, and Borna virus antigen have also been detected in blood donors.

===Psychiatric disease===
There is some evidence that there may be a relationship between Borna virus infection and psychiatric disease.<ref name="pmid12857781">{{cite journal |author=Bode L, Ludwig H |title=Borna disease virus infection, a human mental-health risk |journal=Clin.

Additional evidence for a role of Borna virus in psychiatric disorders comes from reports that the drug [[amantadine]], which is used to treat [[influenza]] infections, has had some success in treating depression and clearing Borna infection.<ref name="pmid11254023">{{cite journal |author=Dietrich DE, Bode L, Spannhuth CW, ''et al.'' |title=Amantadine in depressive patients with Borna disease virus (BDV) infection: an open trial |journal=Bipolar Disord |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=65–70 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=11254023 |doi= 10.1034/j.1399-5618.2000.020110.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1398-5647&date=2000&volume=2&issue=1&spage=65}}</ref> Counter-claims state that Borna virus infections are not cleared by amantadine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The issue is further complicated by the fact that amantadine is also used in the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] and may have direct effects on the [[nervous system]].
