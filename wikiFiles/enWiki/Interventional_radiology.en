'''Interventional radiology''' (abbreviated '''IR''' or '''VIR''' for '''Vascular and Interventional Radiology''', also referred to as Surgical Radiology) is a medical sub-specialty of [[radiology]] which utilizes minimally-invasive image-guided procedures to diagnose and treat diseases in nearly every organ system. The concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose and treat patients using the least invasive techniques currently available in order to minimize risk to the patient and improve health outcomes.

As the inventors of angioplasty and the catheter-delivered stent, interventional radiologists pioneered modern minimally-invasive medicine. Using X-rays, CT, ultrasound, MRI, and other imaging modalities, interventional radiologists obtain images which are then used to direct interventional instruments throughout the body. These procedures are usually performed using needles and narrow tubes called [[catheter]]s, rather than by making large incisions into the body as in traditional surgery. 

Many conditions that once required surgery can now be treated non-surgically by interventional radiologists. By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient, peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery time, as well as shorten hospital stays.<ref>Society of Interventional Radiology -- Global Statement Defining Interventional radiology. http://www.sirweb.org/news/newsPDF/IR_Global_Statement.pdf</ref>

==History==
Interventional radiologists are minimally invasive specialists. The landscape of medicine is constantly changing, and for the past 30 years, interventional radiologists have been responsible for much of the medical innovation and development of the minimally invasive procedures that are commonplace today. Interventional radiologists pioneered modern medicine with the invention of angioplasty and the catheter-delivered stent, which were first used to treat peripheral arterial disease. By using a catheter to open the blocked artery, the procedure allowed an 82-year-old woman, who refused amputation surgery, to keep her gangrene-ravaged left foot. To her surgeon’s disbelief, her pain ceased, she started walking, and three "irreversibly" gangrenous toes spontaneously sloughed. She left the hospital on her feet—both of them. The growth of interventional radiology was fueled by ties between interventionalists such as [[Charles Dotter]] and innovative device manufacturers like Bill Cook. Interventional radiologist [[Charles Dotter]], MD, known as the "Father of Interventional Radiology" for pioneering this technique, was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1978.

Alexander Margulis coined the term "interventional" for these new, minimally invasive techniques. He emphasized that to continue to be on the forefront of innovation, interventional radiologists must possess special training, technical skill, clinical knowledge, ability to care for patients, and closely collaborate with surgeons and internal medicine subspecialists. 

Development of stents began slowly. In 1969, Dotter conceived the idea of expandable
stents with an intra-arterial coil spring. The first stents developed by Dotter and Andrew Craig were made of nitinol. Gianturco introduced his self-expandable Z stent. Hans Wallsten introduced a self-expandable mesh stent, Ernst Strecker a knitted tantalum stent and Julio Palmaz his balloon expandable stent, which was later perfected and introduced to clinical practice. Angioplasty and stenting revolutionized medicine and led the way for the more widely known applications of coronary artery angioplasty and stenting that revolutionized the practice of cardiology. 

Treatment of GI bleeding has a storied tradition. After introduction of selective vasoconstrictive infusions by Baum, Josef Rösch introduced selective arterial [[embolization]] for treatment of uncontrollable bleeding in the early 70s. Anders Lundequist treated [[varices|variceal bleeding]] with the technique of transhepatic variceal embolization in the mid 70s. Interventions in the biliary tract were developed by several pioneers. Interventional Radiologist Joachim Burrhenne invented and perfected the technique of percutaneous removal of retained [[billiary stone]]s. Plinio Rossi and Hall Coons enriched biliary interventions with their work using biliary [[stent]]s. The innovative interventionalists [[Kurt Amplatz]], Willi Castaneda and Dave Hunter pioneered percutaneous uroradiologic interventions. They popularized nephrostomy drainage, percutaneous stone extraction, and urethral stenting.

The field of interventional [[oncology]] was pioneered by IR legends. Bob White pioneered [[embolization]] techniques for pulmonary [[Arteriovenous malformation|AVMs]]. Sid Wallace was one of the first to treat bone and kidney tumors by embolization and treatment of disseminated liver metastases. 

Today many conditions that once required surgery can be treated nonsurgically by interventional radiologists. Through a small nick in the skin, they use tiny catheters and miniature instruments so small they can be run through a person’s network of arteries to treat at the site of illness internally, saving the patient from open invasive surgery. While no treatment is risk free, the risks of interventional procedures are far lower than the risks of open surgery, and are a major advance in medicine for patients.

'''Traditional'''

As in most medical specialties, training varies depending on varying rules and regulations from country to country. In the United States, interventional radiologists are physicians whose education and training traditionally includes completing a college degree, four years of medical school, a year of training in general medicine and/or surgery (internship), a four year diagnostic radiology residency program, and then a one or two year fellowship in vascular & interventional radiology. 

With the evolving need to train more clinically oriented interventionists, two alternative pathways to achieve certification in IR have been established through the leadership of the [[Society of Interventional Radiology]] (SIR): The DIRECT and Clinical pathways.<ref>[http://www.sirweb.org/fellows-residents-students/pathway-options.shtml SIR - Fellow Residents and Students - APDIR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For both pathways, the SIR states that the trainee must become proficient in management of inpatient and outpatient pre-procedure, post-procedure, and follow-up clinical care for all disease processes pertinent to the practice of VIR.

'''DIRECT'''

The DIRECT (Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Enhanced Clinical Training) pathway allows for up to two years of clinical training prior entering the program. Therefore, residents may enter the new pathway from medical school or after two or more years of clinical training in other specialties such as internal medicine or vascular surgery. The core diagnostic training is 27 months in duration, with 21 total months of VIR training for a total of 48 months (four year) duration. The advantage of the DIRECT pathway is that upon successful completion of the program and 12 months of clinical practice, a clinician can achieve both a Diagnostic Radiology board certification and a subspecialty vascular IR certificate. The American Board of Radiology offers a complete list of programs that offer this pathway at: http://theabr.org/ic/ic_other/ic_direct.html. 

'''Clinical'''

An integrated [[Clinical Pathway]] has been created to provide breadth and depth of clinical experience for trainees who desire a primary career focusing on VIR rather than diagnostic radiology. The 6 year program allows for 29 months of Diagnostic Radiology training, 19 months of clinical training (including a medicine or surgery intern year) and research, and 21 months of VIR fellowship training. The Clinical Pathway is offered by institutions such as UVA, Northwestern and Brigham and Women's Hospital. The Clinical Pathway allows for certification in VIR and for board certification in diagnostic radiology. 

'''Dual Certificate'''

A newer Dual Certificate program has just been approved for implementation which is a six year curriculum, similar to the Clinical Pathway, that provides training for Board Certification in both Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology.<ref>http://www.theabr.org/present/ABR%20Update.ppt</ref>

'''Pediatric'''

A handful of programs currently offer interventional radiology [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowships]] that focus on training in the treatment of children.<ref>[http://www.pedrad.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=296 The Society for Pediatric Radiology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Imaging Modalities==
Common interventional imaging modalities include [[fluoroscopy]], [[computed axial tomography|computed tomography]] (CT), [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] (US), and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) including plane Radiograph: 

• [[Fluoroscopy]] and [[computed tomography]] use [[ionizing radiation]] that may be potentially harmful to the patient and the interventional radiologist. However, both methods have the advantages of being fast and geometrically accurate. 

• [[Ultrasound]] is frequently used to guide needles during vascular access and drainage procedures.  Ultrasound offers real-time feedback and is inexpensive.  Ultrasound suffers from limited penetration and difficulty visualizing needles, catheters and guidewires.

• [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] provides superior tissue contrast, at the cost of being expensive and requiring specialized instruments that will not interact with the magnetic fields present in the imaging volume.

==Disorders==
===Vascular===
;:;[[Varicose veins]] 
;:Pooling of blood in the veins from weak valves resulting in enlarged, swollen vessels causing pain and cosmetic complaints. Interventional [[endovenous laser treatment]] or [[sclerotherapy]] may be used to heat the vein from the inside, sealing it closed. Other healthy veins carry blood from the leg to reestablish normal flow.
;:;[[Peripheral artery disease|Peripheral artery disease (PAD)]]
;:Most commonly a result of [[atherosclerosis]], occlusion of normal blood flow in the upper and lower extremities may result in pain, skin [[ulcer]]s, or [[gangrene]]. [[Stent]]ing, [[angioplasty]], and mechanical [[atherectomy]] are available interventional treatments.
;:;[[Deep vein thrombosis|Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)]]
;:The formation of a [[thrombus]], or [[blood clot]], in the deep leg veins which may lead to swelling, discoloration, and pain. DVTs can result [[post-thrombotic syndrome]] and [[pulmonary embolism]]. [[Post-thrombotic syndrome]] is irreversible damage from a long standing DVT in the affected leg veins and valves, leading to chronic pain, swelling, and severe skin [[ulcer]]s. [[Pulmonary embolism]] is a life-threatening condition which occurs when a deep vein thrombus (DVT) breaks off and travels to the lungs, resulting in difficulty breathing. Catheter-directed [[thrombolysis]], [[balloon angioplasty]], or [[stent]]ing may be performed in the affected vein to dissolve the clot and restore normal blood flow.
;:;[[Pulmonary embolism]]
;:A potentially life-threatening occlusion of the arteries supplying the lungs with [[blood clot]]s, manifesting in shortness of breath, fatigue, palpitations, and fainting. Catheter-directed [[thrombolysis]] may be performed for this condition, where a catheter is inserted into the leg, threaded up to the lung, and then used to infuse "clot-busting" drugs into the occlusion.
;:;[[IVC filter|IVC filter placement]]
;:Patients who have a history of, or are at risk for, [[pulmonary embolism]] may receive temporary or permanent [[inferior vena cava|inferior vena cava (IVC)]] filters to prevent the migration of [[blood clot]]s to the lungs, and consequently prevent recurrence of [[pulmonary embolism]].
;:;[[Abdominal aortic aneurysm|Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)]]
;:A weakening and dilatation of the [[abdominal aorta]] wall that can result in abdominal or back pain, and potentially life-threatening bleeding if it ruptures. Interventional treatment of this condition via non-surgical means is [[endovascular aneurysm repair]], using [[angiography]] and [[stent]]ing to occlude the AAA and prevent its continued growth.
;:;[[Thoracic aortic aneurysm|Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA)]] and [[Aortic dissection]]
;:Anuerysms, or dilatations, of the thoracic (chest cavity) aorta may be caused by [[atherosclerosis]], [[syphilis]], trauma, or multiple other conditions. [[Aortic dissection]]s are tears in the thoracic aorta resulting from trauma or weakening of the aortic vessel walls from conditions such as [[hypertension]], [[atherosclerosis]], and congenital conditions such as [[Marfan syndrome]]. Interventional treatments for TAAs and aortic dissections utilize [[stent graft]]s, sometimes in combination with surgery, to prevent blood flow from enlarging the diseased area or rupturing the aorta.
;:;[[Acute limb ischemia]]
;:The sudden disruption of blood flow to an arm or a leg due to arterial occlusion by a blood clot or other debris, potentially treated with catheter-directed [[thrombolysis]] or mechanical [[thrombectomy]].
;:;[[Acute mesenteric ischemia]]
;:A medical emergency resulting from interruption of the blood supply to the abdominal organs due to blockage of the [[mesenteric arteries]] or veins by [[thrombus]], [[embolus]], or [[aortic dissection]]. Treatment varies by etiology of the ischemia, but may include [[thrombolysis]], [[stenting]], or [[angioplasty]].
;:;[[Aneurysm]]s of visceral arteries
;:Dilatation of visceral arteries supplying organs such as the spleen, liver, or gastrointestinal tract can result in pain and life threatening bleeding. [[Stent]]ing, [[embolization]], liquid occlusion, and thrombin injection are the available interventional therapies for these disorders.
;:;[[Arteriovenous malformations|Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)]] 
;:Aberrations in normal vascular anatomy treatable by [[embolization]] which may cause pain, bleeding, heart problems, or cosmetic concerns.

===Oncologic===
Various interventional therapies exist to treat cancers. Tumor type, size, extent of disease, operator experience, and involvement of anatomical structures all factor into deciding which therapy is most appropriate. Some therapies, such as [[transarterial chemoembolization]], block the blood supply to tumors. Other techniques--[[radiofrequency ablation|radiofrequency ablation (RFA)]], [[microwave ablation]], [[cryoablation]], [[Electroporation|irreversible electroporation (IRE)]], and [[high-intensity focused ultrasound|high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)]]-- directly damage the cancerous tissue. All of these treatments are delivered locally, minimizing damage to nearby tissue and avoiding the systemic side-effects of chemotherapy.

;:;[[Liver cancer]]
::[[Hepatocellular carcinoma]], the most common form of liver cancer, begins in liver cells known as [[hepatocytes]]. Other cancers that affect the liver are known as [[metastatic liver disease]] and include [[colon cancer]] and [[neuroendocrine tumors]]. Curative treatment is [[liver resection]] or [[liver transplant]]; however, [[cryoablation]], [[radiofrequency ablation]], [[percutaneous ethanol injection]], [[chemoembolization]], and [[radioembolization]] are options for patients that are poor candidates for resection or transplantation. 
;:;[[Lung cancer]]
;:;[[Kidney Cancer]]
;:;[[Bone Cancer]]
;:;[[Breast Cancer]]
;:;[[Prostate Cancer]]

===Neurologic===
;:;[[Stroke]]
;:A neurological condition occurring when the brain is starved of oxygen and nutrients resulting from the blockage of blood vessels supplying it ([[ischemic stroke]]) or from bleeding ([[hemorrhagic stroke]]). Symptoms include language, motor, sensory, and vision deficits. Interventional neuroradiologists play a critical role in determining the type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) using [[computed tomography|non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]], and then treating the stroke using minimally-invasive treatment, if possible. Strokes caused by [[blood clot]]s can be treated by intra-arterial [[thrombolysis]] or by mechanical [[thrombectomy]]. Strokes caused by bleeding resulting from ruptured [[aneurysm]]s may be treated by [[embolization]], most commonly using tiny metal coils.
;:;[[Carotid artery stenosis]]
;:A narrowing of the carotid artery supplying the brain which can lead to stroke and disability. [[Carotid stenting|Carotid artery stenting (CAS)]] is an alternative to surgical [[carotid endarterectomy|carotid endarterectomy (CEA)]] which may be performed in patients who have symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease but who are poor candidates for open surgery.
;:;[[Multiple Sclerosis]]
;:[[Angioplasty]] of the cervical veins has been suggested as an interventional treatment of [[chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency]] (CCSVI) that, hypothetically, contributes to the pathogenesis of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Imaging studies challenge Zamboni theory of MS|url=http://www.cma.ca/index.php?ci_id=202821&la_id=1|work=Canadian Medical Association|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> This hypothesis is highly controversial <ref name="fda">{{cite web|title=FDA Safety Communication: Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis Patients|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm303318.htm|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|month=May|year=2012}}</ref> and treatment of CCSVI by methods of interventional radiology is encouraged only in context of research.<ref name="nice">

===Spine===
;:;[[Spinal fractures]]
;:[[Vertebroplasty]] and [[kyphoplasty]], the percutaneous injection of biocompatible cement into fractured vertebrae, are two available treatments for vertebral fractures.<ref>[http://www.sirweb.org/patients/vertebroplasty-osteoporosis/ Nonsurgical Treatment for Spinal Fractures From Osteoporosis - SIR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Hepatobiliary===
;:;[[Portal hypertension]]
;:A condition in which the normal flow of blood through the liver is slowed or blocked by scarring ([[cirrhosis]]) or other damage (e.g. [[hepatitis]]). Patients with the condition are at risk of internal bleeding or other life-threatening complications. [[Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt|Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)]] formation is a minimally-invasive treatment to alleviate this impaired blood flow.
;:;Bile Duct Obstruction
;:Patients with [[liver cancer]], [[bile duct cancer]], [[cholecystitis]], [[cholangitis]], or other [[hepatobiliary]] pathology may experience obstruction of [[bile ducts]]. Interventional radiologists commonly perform procedures such as [[percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography|percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTHC or PTC)]] to image these obstructions, and may treat these conditions using percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), wherein catheters or stents are placed through the skin and into the bile ducts to drain the bile for prolonged periods of time or until surgery.

===Women’s Health===
;:;[[Uterine fibroid]]s 
;:[[Uterine fibroid]]s are non-cancerous growths of the muscular portion of the uterus which may cause pain and heavy bleeding. Interventional radiologists are able to perform non-surgical, minimally-invasive treatments of uterine fibroids, called [[uterine fibroid embolization|uterine fibroid embolization (UFE)]], or [[uterine artery embolization|uterine artery embolization (UAE)]], using real-time imaging. In this procedure, the interventional radiologist makes a tiny nick in the skin in the groin and inserts a catheter into the femoral artery. The physician guides the catheter into the uterine arteries that supply blood to the fibroid and then releases tiny particles through the catheter to occlude the blood supply of the tumor, causing it to shrink and die. 
;:Fibroid embolization typically requires a hospital stay of one night. On average, 85-90 percent of women who have had the procedure experience significant or total relief of heavy bleeding, pain and/or bulk-related symptoms. Recurrence of fibroids treated by UFE is very rare.
;:;[[Pelvic congestion syndrome]]
;:A condition caused by pooling of blood in the pelvic veins, possibly resulting in pelvic pain and lower extremity varicose veins. Interventional vein [[embolization]] is possible in some cases, eliminating the need for surgical removal of the ovaries and/or uterus.
;:;[[Infertility]]
;:One cause of female infertility is the blockage or narrowing of the fallopian tubes through which eggs pass from the ovary to the uterus. This cause of infertility may be  diagnosed using selective salpingography and treated by opening the narrowing using a minimally invasive device such as a balloon.

===Kidney===
;:;[[Renal artery stenosis]]
;:A narrowing of the arterial supply of the kidneys which may result in [[high blood pressure|high blood pressure (hypertension)]] or [[renal insufficiency]]. Diagnosis of these conditions is made by measuring the diameter of stenosis, the blood pressure across the area of stenosis, renal vein renin sampling, and [[captopril challenge test]]ing. Stenosis may be treated by [[balloon angioplasty]] or [[stent]]ing.
;:;[[Renal failure]]/[[Dialysis catheter]] placement
;:Patients in renal failure may require the placement of a hemodialysis catheter prior to initiating hemodialysis for renal failure. 
;:;[[Dialysis|Dialysis fistula]]/Arterio-venous graft clot
;:Dialysis fistulae and grafts may become occluded by blood clots, requiring an interventional “declot” procedure in which mechanical or chemical thrombolysis is performed to eliminate the clot.
;:;[[Dialysis|Dialysis fistula]]/Arterio-venous graft failure
;:Dialysis fistulae and grafts may fail to “mature”, resulting in the need to image the fistula and potentially relieve any blockages using [[angioplasty]].
;:;[[Percutaneous nephrostomy|Nephrostomy tube placement]]
;:In conditions where a blockage exists between the kidney and the urethra, such as with [[kidney stone]]s, a tube may be placed into the kidney under imaging guidance to allow the drainage of urine and to prevent kidney damage.

===Other===
;:;[[Gastric varices]]
;:A condition in which blood flow through the vessels around the stomach is slowed or stopped, potentially resulting in bleeding. Interventional treatments include embolzation and balloon-retrograde transverse obliteration (BRTO).
;:;[[Varicocele]]s and [[male infertility]]
;:A dilatation in the veins of the scrotum which can result in pain, swelling, and infertility. It is potentially treated interventionally using [[embolization]] and [[sclerotherapy]].<ref>[http://www.sirweb.org/patients/varicoceles/ Male Infertility and Varicocele Treatment - SIR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
;:;[[Central_venous_catheter|Central venous access]] 
;:Vascular access and management of specialized kinds of vascular access devices (VADs).  Vascular access devices include nontunneled catheters such as [[PICC line]]s, tunneled catheters such as [[Hickman line]]s, and fully implanted devices or [[subcutaneous port]]s.  Access sites include arm/leg veins [[PICC line]]s as well as jugular, subclavian and femoral veins and in some cases the inferior vena cava is directly accessed by translumbar and transhepatic routes.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.sirweb.org/patients/gastrostomy/ Central Lines, Ports and Feeding Tubes - SIR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
