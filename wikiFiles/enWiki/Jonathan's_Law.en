'''Jonathan's Law''', a [[New York]] statute co-sponsored by [[Harvey Weisenberg]] signed into law in May 2007, by governor [[Eliot Spitzer]], entitles parents and [[legal guardian]]s access to all [[child abuse]] investigation files and [[medical history]] records.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/news/local/state/ny-stjohn075202870may07,0,3435531.story?coll=ny-statenews-headlines ''Newsday'' article]</ref><ref>[http://www.state.ny.us/governor/press/0904073.html Governor Spitzer's press release]. Retrieved April 1, 2009.</ref>

The legislative measure is intended to hold residential [[mental health]] facilities accountable by requiring notification of guardians in cases of ill treatment, and requires written reports of ensuing investigations. Jonathan's Law was sponsored by Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]–[[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]]) and State Sen. Thomas Morahan ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]–[[New City, New York|New City]]); Mike and Lisa Carey, the parents of Jonathan Carey, promoted Jonathan's Law.

==Background==
The State of New York's [[Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities]] prevented the family of Jonathan Carey from accessing records relating to their son, who had been diagnosed with [[autism]]. Jonathan attended the private Anderson School in [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] in 2004. The Anderson School specializes in the education of children on the [[autism spectrum]]. Being nonverbal, Jonathan was unable to tell his parents what had happened to him.

==Legal effects==
"Jonathan's Law" is the "popular name" of the amendments to New York [[Mental Hygiene]] Law Article 33.

===Records access===
Gives parents and guardians of developmentally-disabled people who live in government facilities access to records concerning abuse allegations. Records must be produced within three weeks after an investigation is closed.

===Phone notification===
Mandates telephone notification, within 24 hours of an incident, to parents or guardians, followed by a written report within ten days.

===Meetings===
Requires facility directors to meet with parents and/or guardians to discuss reported incidents.

===Fines===
Increases fines for noncompliance to $1,000 per day, and up to $15,000 per violation.

==Privacy concerns==
OMRDD officials cautioned the New York legislature about passing Jonathan's Law without sufficient consideration, citing [[privacy]] concerns, adding that rushing their decision could be detrimental, asserting that [[whistleblower]]s will be less likely to come forward if their accusations become public.

==Perspective of advocates==
According to advocates supporting Jonathan's Law, everyone deserves safety and quality medical care. They have argued that parents of individuals deemed unable to protect themselves must be allowed reasonable access to transparent records, thereby enabling families to ensure quality of care for their loved ones.
