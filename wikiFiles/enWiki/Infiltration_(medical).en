'''Infiltration''' is the [[diffusion]] or [[accumulation]] (in a [[biological tissue|tissue]] or [[cell (biology)|cell]]s) of substances not normal to it or in amounts in [[excess]] of the normal.  The material collected in those tissues or cells is called '''infiltrate'''.

==Classification==
As part of a disease process, infiltration is sometimes used to define the invasion of [[cancer]] cells into the underlying matrix or the blood vessels. Similarly the term may describe the deposition of [[amyloid]] protein. During [[leukocyte extravasation]] [[white blood cell]]s move in response to [[cytokine]] chemicals ([[chemotaxis]]), from within the blood out to infiltrate into the diseased or infected tissues. The presence of [[lymphocyte]]s in tissue in greater than normal numbers is likewise called infiltration.

As part of medical intervention, [[local anaesthetics]] may be injected at more than one point so as to infiltrate an area prior to a surgical procedure. However the term may also apply to unintended [[iatrogenic]] leakage of fluids from phlebotomy or intravenous drug delivery procedures, a process also known as [[extravasation]] or "tissuing".

==Tissuing==
Infiltration, or tissuing, describes leakage of fluids or blood from damaged blood vessels as a result of medical interventions.

===Aetiology===
Infiltration  may be caused by: 
*Puncture of distal vein wall during venipuncture
*Puncture of any portion of the vein wall by mechanical friction from the catheter/needle cannula
*Dislodgement of the catheter/needle cannula from the intima of the vein which may be a result of a poorly secured IV device or inappropriate choice of venous site to puncture.
*Improper cannula size or excessive delivery rate of the fluid

===Signs/Symptoms===
The signs and symptoms of infiltration include: 
* Inflammation at or near the insertion site with swollen taut skin with pain 
* Blanching and coolness of skin around IV site
* Damp or wet dressing
* Slowed or stopped infusion
* No backflow of blood into IV tubing on lowering the solution container.

===Nursing Treatment===
The use of warm compresses to treat infiltration has become controversial. It has been found that cold compresses may be better for some infiltrated infusates.  If the infiltration is recent and the solution was hypertonic or had an increased pH, a cold compress can be applied. A warm compress can be applied if a small amount of non-caustic solution has infiltrated over a long period, or if the solution is isotonic with normal pH. 

It has also been documented that elevation of the infiltrated extremity may be painful for the patient. 

To act in the best interest of the patient, following IV infiltration, consult with the physician for orders regarding compresses and elevation.
