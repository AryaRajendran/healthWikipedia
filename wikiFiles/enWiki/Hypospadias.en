'''Hypospadias''' {{IPAc-en|h|aɪ|p|oʊ|ˈ|s|p|eɪ|d|ɪ|ə|s}}<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypospadias Entry "hypospadias"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref><ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989 as {{IPA|/hɪpəʊ'speɪdɪəs/}}~{{IPA|/haɪpəʊ'speɪdɪəs/}}.</ref> is a [[birth defect]] of the [[urethra]] in the [[male]] that involves an abnormally placed [[urinary meatus]] (the opening, or [[External urethral orifice (male)|male external urethral orifice]]). Instead of opening at the tip of the [[glans penis|glans]] of the [[penis]], a hypospadic urethra opens anywhere along a line (the ''urethral groove'') running from the tip along the underside (ventral aspect) of the shaft to the junction of the penis and [[scrotum]] or [[perineum]]. A distal hypospadias may be suspected even in an [[uncircumcised]] boy from an abnormally formed [[foreskin]] and downward tilt of the glans.

The urethral meatus opens on the underside of the [[glans penis]] in about 50&ndash;75% of cases; these are categorized as ''first degree'' hypospadias.  ''Second degree'' (when the urethra opens on the shaft), and ''third degree'' (when the urethra opens on the [[perineum]]) occur in up to 20 and 30% of cases respectively. The more severe degrees are more likely to be associated with [[chordee]], in which the phallus is incompletely separated from the perineum or is still tethered downwards by connective tissue, or with undescended testes ([[cryptorchidism]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Hypospadie Fisteln.jpg|thumb|Penis with hypospadias (1) and two fistulae (2)]]
Hypospadias is a male birth defect in which the opening of the tube that carries urine from the body (urethra) develops abnormally, usually on the underside of the penis. The opening can occur anywhere from just below the end of the penis to the scrotum. A form of hypospadias in which the genitals are abnormally positioned can also develop in males.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Associated birth defects===
Mild hypospadias most often occurs as an isolated birth defect without detectable abnormality of the remainder of the reproductive or endocrine system. However, a minority of infants, especially those with more severe degrees of hypospadias will have additional structural anomalies of the genitourinary tract. Up to 10% of boys with hypospadias have at least one undescended [[testis]], and a similar number have an [[inguinal hernia]]. An enlarged [[prostatic utricle]] is common when the hypospadias is severe (scrotal or perineal), and can predispose to [[urinary tract infection]]s, pseudo-[[urinary incontinence|incontinence]], or even [[urolithiasis|stone]] formation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Epispadias===
A much rarer and unrelated type of urethral malformation is an '''[[epispadias]]'''. This is not a problem of the urethral groove or meatus, but a failure of midline penile fusion much earlier in embryogenesis. An isolated opening of the dorsal ("top") side of the penis is rare, and most of these children have much more severe defects, involving a small and bifid phallus with [[bladder exstrophy]] or more severely, [[cloacal exstrophy]] involving the entire perineum. The cause of this defect of early embryogenesis is unknown but does not involve androgens.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Causes==
In most cases, the cause of this birth defect is not fully understood. Treatment with hormones such as progesterone during pregnancy may increase the risk of hypospadias.<ref name=Silver /> Certain hormonal fluctuations, such as failure of the fetal testes to produce enough testosterone or the failure of the body to respond to testosterone, increase the risk of hypospadias and other genetic problems. Sometimes hypospadias is inherited.

There may also be an increased risk of hypospadias in infant males born to women of an advanced age or those who used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to conceive. The connection to IVF may be due to the mother's exposure to progesterone, a natural hormone, or to progestin, a synthetic form of progesterone, administered during the IVF process.<ref name=Silver>{{cite journal|last=Silver|first=RI|coauthors=Rodriguez, R; Chang, TS; Gearhart, JP|title=In vitro fertilization is associated with an increased risk of hypospadias.|journal=The Journal of urology|date=1999 Jun|volume=161|issue=6|pages=1954-7|pmid=10332480}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hypospadias: Risk Factors|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hypospadias/DS00884/DSECTION=risk-factors|publisher=The Mayo Clinic}}</ref> 

Prenatal [[testosterone]], converted in the genital skin to [[dihydrotestosterone]], causes migration of skin fibroblasts to fully enclose the urethral groove in fetal males, normally resulting in an enclosed penile urethra by the second trimester of pregnancy. Failure of adequate prenatal [[androgen]] effect is therefore thought to be involved in many cases, making severe hypospadias a very mild form of [[intersex]] (under-[[virilization]] of a genetic male). Since postnatal androgen deficiency can only be demonstrated in a minority of cases, it has been proposed that transient deficiency of testosterone can occur during critical periods of fetal genital development, due to elevation of [[anti-müllerian hormone]] or more subtle degrees of pituitary-gonadal dysfunction. More recently, abnormalities of [[transcription factor]]s have been proposed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In animals, several [[teratogen]]ic [[medication|drugs]] or chemicals can cause hypospadias by interfering with [[androgen]] action in the embryo. Speculation that environmental agents&mdash;[[endocrine disruptor]]s&mdash;might be interfering with human hormone systems has not been proven. The agents that have caused hypospadias in a small number of boys have been maternal use of synthetic [[progestin]]s and [[finasteride]] in the first two trimesters of pregnancy. In 2008, it was suggested that maternal use of [[diethylstilbestrol]], a synthetic [[estrogen]], resulted in a 20-fold increase in prevalence of hypospadias<ref name="lancet">{{cite journal |author=Klip H, Verloop J, van Gool JD, Koster ME, Burger CW, van Leeuwen FE |title=Hypospadias in sons of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero: a cohort study |journal=Lancet |volume=359 |issue=9312 |pages=1102–7 |year=2002 |pmid=11943257 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08152-7 |url=}}</ref> although a follow-up study showed the risk, though present, to be much lesser.<ref name="repro">{{cite journal |author=Brouwers MM, Feitz WF, Roelofs LA, Kiemeney LA, de Gier RP, Roeleveld N |title=Hypospadias: a transgenerational effect of diethylstilbestrol? |journal=Hum. Reprod. |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=666–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16293648 |doi=10.1093/humrep/dei398 |url=}}</ref>

In a minority of cases a postnatal deficiency of, or reduced sensitivity to, [[androgen]]s ([[testosterone]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]]) can be demonstrated. These are often associated with a chordee, and in severe cases a residual perineal urogenital opening and small phallus. This combination of birth defects is referred to as [[pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias]] and is part of the spectrum of [[ambiguous genitalia]]. Treatment with testosterone postnatally does not close the urethra.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Genetic factors are likely involved in at least some cases, as there is about a 7% familial recurrence risk. A 2010 Article<ref>{{cite journal | author=Loes F M van der Zanden et. al. | title=Common variants in DGKK are strongly associated with risk of hypospadias | journal=Nature Genetics |volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=48–50|doi=10.1038/ng.721 | pmid=21113153 | year=2010 |url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.721.html|accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11850610 | title=Clue found to penis birth defect |accessdate=2010-11-29 | work=BBC News | date=2010-11-29}}</ref> found a 2.5 times increase in the condition for boys with a specific genetic defect that was carried on the X (maternally contributed sex) chromosome.

Rare [[iatrogenic]] urethral injuries similar to hypospadias after procedures such as surgery, catheterization, or circumcision have been reported.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Treatment==
[[Image:Hypospadias erection.JPG|thumb|right|100px|An erect penis with hypospadias]]
First degree hypospadias are primarily a cosmetic defect and have little effect on function except for direction of the [[urination|urinary stream]]. If uncorrected, a second or third degree hypospadias can make urination messy, necessitate that it be performed sitting, impair delivery of semen into the vagina (possibly creating problems with [[fertility]]), or interfere with [[erection]]s. In developed countries, most hypospadias are surgically repaired in infancy. Surgical repair of first and second degree hypospadias is nearly always successful in one procedure, usually performed in the first year of life by a [[pediatric urologist]] or a [[plastic surgeon]].

When the hypospadias is third degree, or there are associated birth defects such as [[chordee]] or [[cryptorchidism]], the best management can be a more complicated decision. A [[karyotype]] and [[pediatric endocrinology|endocrine]] evaluation should be performed to detect intersex conditions or hormone deficiencies. If the penis is [[micropenis|small]], [[testosterone]] or [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) injections may be given to enlarge it before surgery.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Surgical repair of severe hypospadias may require multiple procedures and [[mucous membrane|mucosal]] [[skin graft|grafting]]. [[Foreskin|Preputial]] skin is often used for grafting and circumcision should be avoided before repair. In a minority of patients with severe hypospadias surgery produces unsatisfactory results, such as [[scar]]ring, curvature, or formation of urethral [[fistula]]s, [[diverticulum|diverticula]], or strictures. A fistula is an unwanted opening through the skin along the course of the urethra, and can result in urinary leakage or an abnormal stream. A diverticulum is an "outpocketing" of the lining of the urethra which interferes with urinary flow and may result in post-urination leakage. A stricture is a narrowing of the urethra severe enough to obstruct flow. Reduced complication rates even for third degree repair (e.g., fistula rates below 5%) have been reported in recent years from centers with the most experience, and surgical repair is now performed for the vast majority of infants with hypospadias.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Due to the difficulties and lower success rates of surgical repair of the most severe degrees of under [[virilization]], some of these genetically male but severely undervirilized infants have been assigned and raised as girls, with [[intersex surgery|feminizing surgical reconstruction]]. Opinion has shifted against this approach in the last decade because adult sexual function as a female has often been poor, and development of a male [[gender identity]] despite female [[sex assignment]] and [[sex of rearing|rearing]] has occurred in some XY children after reassignment for a more severe type of genital birth defect, [[cloacal exstrophy]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Epidemiology==
Hypospadias are among the most common birth defects of the male genitalia (second to [[cryptorchidism]]), but widely varying incidences have been reported from different countries, from as low as 1 in 4000 to as high as 1 in 125 boys.<ref name=epidemiology>{{cite web|last=Gatti|first=John M|title=Epidemiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1015227-overview#a0199|publisher=Medscape Reference|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref>

The incidence of hypospadias around the world has been increasing in recent decades. In the United States, two surveillance studies reported that the incidence had increased from about 1 in 500 total births (1 in 250 boys) in the 1970s to 1 in 250 total births (1 in 125 boys) in the 1990s.  Although a slight worldwide increase in hypospadias was reported in the 1980s, studies in different countries and regions have yielded conflicting results and some registries have reported decreases. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
