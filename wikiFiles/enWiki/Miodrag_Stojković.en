'''Miodrag Stojković''' ({{lang-sr|Миодраг Стојковић}}) (born on July 5, 1964 in [[Leskovac]], [[Serbia]], then [[Yugoslavia]]) is a [[Serbs|Serbian]] researcher in genetics with the Institute of Human Genetics at [[Newcastle University]]. He holds a PhD from  the [[Ludwig-Maximilians University]] in [[Munich]]. As of January 2006, he is serving as a Deputy Director and Head of Cellular Reprogramming Laboratory, Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe, [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], [[Spain]].

According to the [[TIME]] magazine, Stojković caused a controversy when he tried to create [[human embryos]] by injecting a patient's own DNA into an egg from which the genetic material has been removed. He then hopes to harvest [[stem cells]]&mdash;which can develop into almost any organ&mdash;and coax them to produce insulin in diabetics. The research could lead to cure of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and heart diseases.[http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/040719/gdi/stojkovic.html]

In a German TV show "Menschen bei Maischberger " (ARD;6/6/2006) he claimed that due to stem cell therapy paraplegic patients will be able to walk in the upcoming three years.
