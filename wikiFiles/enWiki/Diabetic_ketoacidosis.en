'''Diabetic ketoacidosis''' ('''DKA''') is a potentially life-threatening complication in patients with [[diabetes mellitus]]. It happens predominantly in those with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], but it can occur in those with [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] under certain circumstances. DKA results from a shortage of [[insulin]]; insulin assists in pulling blood glucose into cells as a source of energy. When the available glucose has been used up, the body switches to burning [[fatty acid]]s and producing acidic [[ketone bodies]] that cause most of the symptoms and complications.<ref name=ADA2009/>

DKA may be the first symptom of previously undiagnosed diabetes, but it may also occur in people known to have diabetes as a result of a variety of causes, such as intercurrent illness or poor compliance with [[insulin therapy]]. [[Vomiting]], [[dehydration]], [[Kussmaul breathing|deep gasping breathing]], [[mental confusion|confusion]] and occasionally [[coma]] are typical symptoms. DKA is diagnosed with [[blood test|blood]] and [[urinalysis|urine tests]]; it is distinguished from other, rarer forms of [[ketoacidosis]] by the presence of high [[blood sugar]] levels. Treatment involves [[intravenous fluid]]s to correct dehydration, insulin to suppress the production of ketone bodies, treatment for any underlying causes such as infections, and close observation to prevent and identify complications.<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=ESPE/>

DKA is a [[medical emergency]], and without treatment it can lead to death. DKA was first described in 1886; until the introduction of insulin therapy in the 1920s it was almost universally fatal.<ref name=Eledrisi/> It now carries a mortality of less than 1% with adequate and timely treatment.<ref name=JBDS/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis usually evolve over the period of about 24 hours. Predominant symptoms are [[nausea]] and vomiting, pronounced thirst, [[polyuria|excessive urine production]] and [[abdominal pain]] that may be severe. Those who measure their glucose levels themselves may notice [[hyperglycemia]] (high blood sugar levels). In severe DKA, breathing becomes labored and of a deep, gasping character (a state referred to as "[[Kussmaul respiration]]").<ref name=Powers2005>{{cite journal |author=Powers AC |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=2152–2180 |chapter=Diabetes mellitus}}</ref> The abdomen may be tender to the point that an [[acute abdomen]] may be suspected, such as [[acute pancreatitis]], [[appendicitis]] or [[gastrointestinal perforation]].<ref name=Powers2005/> [[Coffee ground vomiting]] (vomiting of altered blood) occurs in a minority of patients; this tends to originate from erosion of the [[esophagus]].<ref name=Eledrisi>{{cite journal |author=Eledrisi MS, Alshanti MS, Shah MF, Brolosy B, Jaha N |title=Overview of the diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis |journal=American Journal of Medical Science |volume=331 |issue=5 |pages=243–51 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16702793 |doi=10.1097/00000441-200605000-00002}}</ref> In severe DKA, there may be confusion, lethargy, stupor or even coma (a marked decrease in the [[level of consciousness]]).<ref name=Powers2005/><ref name=JBDS>{{cite web | author=Joint British Diabetes Societies Inpatient Care Group | title=The Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Adults | date=March 2010 | url=http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk/document.php?o=212| publisher=NHS Diabetes | format=PDF | accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref>

On [[physical examination]] there is usually clinical evidence of dehydration, such as a dry mouth and decreased [[skin turgor]]. If the dehydration is profound enough to cause a decrease in the circulating blood volume, [[tachycardia]] (a fast heart rate) and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] may be observed. Often, a "ketotic" odor is present, which is often described as "fruity", often compared to the smell of pear drops whose scent is a ketone. If Kussmaul respiration is present, this is reflected in an increased [[respiratory rate]].<ref name=Powers2005/>

Small children with DKA are relatively prone to [[cerebral edema]] (swelling of the brain tissue), which may cause headache, coma, loss of the [[pupillary light reflex]], and progress to death. It occurs in 0.3–1.0% of children with DKA, and has been described in young adults, but is overall very rare in adults.<ref name=ADA2009>{{cite journal |author=Kitabchi AE, Umpierrez GE, Miles JM, Fisher JN |title=Hyperglycemic crises in adult patients with diabetes |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=1335–43 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19564476 |pmc=2699725 |doi=10.2337/dc09-9032 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/7/1335.full}}</ref><ref name=Powers2005/><ref name=Glaser2006>{{cite journal |author=Glaser N |title=New perspectives on the pathogenesis of cerebral edema complicating diabetic ketoacidosis in children |journal=Pediatric Endocrinology Reviews |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=379–86 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16816806 |doi= |url=}}</ref> It carries a 20–50% mortality.<ref name=Brown2004>{{cite journal |author=Brown TB |title=Cerebral oedema in childhood diabetic ketoacidosis: Is treatment a factor? |journal=Emergency Medical Journal |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=141–4 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14988335 |pmc=1726262 |doi=10.1136/emj.2002.001578 |url=http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/21/2/141}}</ref>

==Cause==
DKA most frequently occurs in those who already have diabetes, but it may also be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness ([[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], [[gastroenteritis]], a [[urinary tract infection]]), [[pregnancy]], inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), [[stroke]] or the use of [[cocaine]]. Young patients with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying [[eating disorder]], or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause [[obesity|weight gain]].<ref name=Powers2005/>

Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur in those previously known to have diabetes mellitus type 2 or in those who on further investigations turn out to have features of type 2 diabetes (e.g. [[obesity]], strong [[family history]]); this is more common in African, African-American and Hispanic people. Their condition is then labeled "ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes".<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=Umpierrez2006>{{cite journal |author=Umpierrez GE, Smiley D, Kitabchi AE |title=Narrative review: ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes mellitus |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=144 |issue=5 |pages=350–7 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16520476 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/144/5/350.pdf}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Diabetic ketoacidosis arises because of a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of [[glucagon]] leads to increased release of glucose by the [[liver]] (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenolysis]] and  also through [[gluconeogenesis]]. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]) along with it in a process known as [[osmotic diuresis]].<ref name=ADA2009/> This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and compensatory thirst and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free [[fatty acid]]s from [[adipose tissue]] ([[lipolysis]]), which are converted, again in the liver, into ketone bodies ([[acetoacetate]] and [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|β-hydroxybutyrate]]). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] and therefore turn the blood acidic ([[metabolic acidosis]]). The body initially [[buffer solution|buffers]] the change with the [[bicarbonate buffering system]], but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis.<ref name=ADA2009/> One such mechanism is [[hyperventilation]] to lower the blood [[carbon dioxide]] levels (a form of compensatory [[respiratory alkalosis]]). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as [[Kussmaul respiration]].<ref name=Powers2005/>

In various situations such as infection, insulin demands rise but are not matched by the failing pancreas. Blood sugars rise, dehydration ensues, and [[insulin resistance|resistance to the normal effects of insulin]] increases further by way of a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]].<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=Eledrisi/>

As a result of the above mechanisms, the average adult DKA patient has a total body water shortage of about 6&nbsp;liters (or 100&nbsp;mL/kg), in addition to substantial shortages in sodium, [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[phosphate]], [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]]. Glucose levels usually exceed 13.8&nbsp;mmol/L or 250&nbsp;mg/dL.<ref name=ADA2006>{{cite journal |author=Kitabchi AE, Umpierrez GE, Murphy MB, Kreisberg RA |title=Hyperglycemic crises in adult patients with diabetes: a consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=2739–48 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17130218 |doi=10.2337/dc06-9916 | url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/12/2739.full}}</ref>

[[File:beta-Hydroxybutyric acid-2D-skeletal.svg|right|thumb|[[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|β-hydroxybutyrate]], despite chemically containing a carboxylic acid instead of a ketone, is the principal "ketone body" in diabetic ketoacidosis.]]
DKA is common in type 1 diabetes as this form of diabetes is associated with an absolute lack of insulin production by the [[islets of Langerhans]]. In type 2 diabetes, insulin production is present but is insufficient to meet the body's requirements as a result of end-organ insulin resistance. Usually, these amounts of insulin are sufficient to suppress ketogenesis. If DKA occurs in someone with type 2 diabetes, their condition is called "ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes".<ref name=Umpierrez2006/> The exact mechanism for this phenomenon is unclear, but there is evidence both of impaired insulin secretion and insulin action.<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=Umpierrez2006/> Once the condition has been treated, insulin production resumes and often the patient may be able to resume diet or tablet treatment as normally recommended in type 2 diabetes.<ref name=ADA2009/>

The clinical state of DKA is associated, in addition to the above, with the release of various [[counterregulatory hormone]]s such as [[glucagon]] and [[adrenaline]] as well as [[cytokine]]s, the latter of which leads to increased markers of [[inflammation]], even in the absence of [[infection]].<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=ESPE>{{cite journal |author=Dunger DB, Sperling MA, Acerini CL, ''et al.'' |title=European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology/Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society consensus statement on diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=e133–40 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14754983 |doi= 10.1542/peds.113.2.e133| url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/113/2/e133}}</ref>

Cerebral edema, which is the most dangerous DKA complication, is probably the result of a number of factors. Some authorities suggest that it is the result from overvigorous fluid replacement, but the complication may develop before treatment has been commenced.<ref name=Glaser2006/><ref name=Brown2004/> It is more likely in those with more severe DKA,<ref name=ESPE/> and in the first episode of DKA.<ref name=Glaser2006/> Likely factors in the development of cerebral edema are dehydration, acidosis and low carbon dioxide levels; in addition, the increased level of inflammation and [[coagulation]] may, together with these factors, lead to decreased blood flow to parts of the brain, which then swells up once fluid replacement has been commenced.<ref name=Glaser2006/> The swelling of brain tissue leads  to raised [[intracranial pressure]] ultimately leading to death.<ref name=ESPE/><ref name=Brown2004/>

==Diagnosis==
===Investigations===
Diabetic ketoacidosis may be diagnosed when the combination of [[hyperglycemia]] (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on [[urinalysis]] and acidosis are demonstrated. [[Arterial blood gas]] measurement is usually performed to demonstrate the acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an [[artery]]. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a [[vein]], as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH.<ref name=JBDS/>

In addition to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure [[urea]] and [[creatinine]] (measures of [[renal function|kidney function]], which may be impaired in DKA as a result of dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection ([[complete blood count]], [[C-reactive protein]]) and [[acute pancreatitis]] ([[amylase]] and [[lipase]]) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, [[chest X-ray|chest radiography]] and urinalysis are usually performed.<ref name=ADA2009/>

If cerebral edema is suspected because of confusion, recurrent vomiting or other symptoms, [[computed tomography]] may be performed to assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as [[stroke]].<ref name=Brown2004/>

===Criteria===
Diabetic ketoacidosis is distinguished from other diabetic emergencies by the presence of large amounts of ketones in blood and urine, and marked metabolic acidosis. [[Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma|Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state]] (HHS, sometimes labeled "hyperosmolar non-ketotic state" or HONK) is much more common in type 2 diabetes and features increased [[plasma osmolarity]] (above 320&nbsp;mosm/kg) due to profound dehydration and concentration of the blood; mild acidosis and ketonemia may occur in this state, but not to the extent observed in DKA. There is a degree of overlap between DKA and HHS, as in DKA the osmolarity may also be increased.<ref name=ADA2009/>

[[Ketoacidosis]] is not always the result of diabetes. It may also result from [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol excess]] and from [[starvation]]; in both states the glucose level is normal or low. [[Metabolic acidosis]] may occur in people with diabetes for other reasons, such as [[poison]]ing with [[ethylene glycol]] or [[paraldehyde]].<ref name=ADA2009/>

The [[American Diabetes Association]] categorizes DKA in adults into one of three stages of severity:<ref name=ADA2009/>
* ''Mild:'' blood pH mildly decreased to between 7.25 and 7.30 (normal 7.35–7.45); serum bicarbonate decreased to 15–18&nbsp;mmol/l (normal above 20); the patient is alert
* ''Moderate:'' pH 7.00–7.25, bicarbonate 10–15, mild drowsiness may be present
* ''Severe:'' pH below 7.00, bicarbonate below 10, stupor or coma may occur

A 2004 statement by the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society (for children) uses slightly different cutoffs, where mild DKA is defined by pH&nbsp;7.20–7.30 (bicarbonate 10–15&nbsp;mmol/l), moderate DKA by pH&nbsp;7.1–7.2 (bicarbonate 5–10) and severe DKA by pH<7.1 (bicarbonate below 5).<ref name=ESPE/>

==Prevention==
Attacks of DKA can be prevented in those known to have diabetes to an extent by adherence to "sick day rules"; these are clear-cut instructions to patients on how to treat themselves when unwell. Instructions include advice on how much extra insulin to take when sugar levels appear uncontrolled, an easily digestible diet rich in salt and carbohydrates, means to suppress fever and treat infection, and recommendations when to call for medical help.<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=JBDS/>

==Management==
The main aims in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis are replacing the lost fluids and electrolytes while suppressing the high blood sugars and ketone production with insulin. Admission to an [[intensive care unit]] or similar high-dependency area or ward for close observation may be necessary.<ref name=JBDS/>

===Fluid replacement===
The amount of fluid depends on the estimated degree of dehydration. If dehydration is so severe as to cause [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] (severely decreased [[blood pressure]] with insufficient blood supply to the body's organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of [[saline (medicine)|saline]] (1&nbsp;liter for adults, 10&nbsp;ml/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume.<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=BSPED>{{cite web | author=Edge J | title=BSPED Recommended DKA Guidelines 2009 | publisher=British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes | date=May 2009 | url=https://www.bsped.org.uk/professional/guidelines/docs/DKAGuideline.pdf | accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> Slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the dehydration is moderate, and again saline is the recommended fluid.<ref name=BSPED/><ref name=NICECG15>{{NICE|15|Diagnosis and management of type 1 diabetes in children, young people and adults |2004}}</ref> Very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral rehydration and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration.<ref name=BSPED/><ref name=NICECG15/>

A special but unusual consideration is [[cardiogenic shock]], where the blood pressure is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the [[central venous pressure]] (which requires the insertion of a [[central venous catheter]] in a large upper body vein), and the administration of [[inotrope|medication that increases the heart pumping action]] and blood pressure.<ref name=ADA2009/>

===Insulin===
Some guidelines recommend a bolus (initial large dose) of insulin of 0.1&nbsp;unit of insulin per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered immediately after the potassium level is known to be higher than 3.3&nbsp;mmol/l; if the level is any lower, administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below).<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=JBDS/> Other guidelines recommend delaying the initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered.<ref name=BSPED/>

In general, insulin is given at 0.1&nbsp;unit/kg per hour to reduce the blood sugars and suppress ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6&nbsp;mmol/l (300&nbsp;mg/dl)<ref name=ADA2009/> but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.<ref name=JBDS/><ref name=BSPED/>

===Potassium===
Potassium levels can fluctuate severely during the treatment of DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. A large part of the shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. [[Hypokalemia]] (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of [[cardiac arrhythmia|dangerous irregularities in the heart rate]]. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended,<ref name=BSPED/> as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3&nbsp;mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3&nbsp;mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.<ref name=ADA2009/>

===Bicarbonate===
The administration of [[sodium bicarbonate]] solution to rapidly improve the acid levels in the blood is controversial. There is little evidence that it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it may improve the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged,<ref name=ESPE/><ref name=JBDS/><ref name=NICECG15/> although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH&nbsp;6.9–7.0).<ref name=ADA2009/>

===Cerebral edema===
Cerebral edema, if associated with coma, often necessitates admission to intensive care, [[artificial ventilation]], and close observation. The administration of fluids is slowed. The ideal treatment of cerebral edema in DKA is not established, but intravenous [[mannitol]] and hypertonic saline (3%) are used—as in some other forms of cerebral edema—in an attempt to reduce the swelling.<ref name=ESPE/>

===Resolution===
Resolution of DKA is defined as general improvement in the symptoms, such as the ability to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids, normalization of blood acidity (pH>7.3), and absence of ketones in blood (<1&nbsp;mmol/l) or urine. Once this has been achieved, insulin may be switched to the usual subcutaneously administrered regimen, one hour after which the intravenous administration can be discontinued.<ref name=JBDS/><ref name=BSPED/>

In patients with suspected ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against [[glutamic acid decarboxylase]] and [[islets of Langerhans|islet cells]] may aid in the decision whether to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes.<ref name=Umpierrez2006/>

==Epidemiology==
Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs in 4.6–8.0 per 1000 people with type 1 diabetes annually.<ref name=ADA2006/> In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually as a result of DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4&nbsp;billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions.<ref name=ADA2009/> The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin.<ref name=ADA2009/> About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silverstein J, Klingensmith G, Copeland K, ''et al.'' |title=Care of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a statement of the American Diabetes Association |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=186–212 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15616254 |doi= 10.2337/diacare.28.1.186| url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/28/1/186.full}}</ref>

==History==
The first full description of diabetic ketoacidosis is attributed to [[Julius Dreschfeld]], a German pathologist working in [[Manchester]], United Kingdom. In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in London, he drew on reports by [[Adolph Kussmaul]] as well as describing the main ketones, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dreschfeld J | title=The Bradshawe Lecture on Diabetic Coma | journal=British Medical Journal | year=1886 | volume=2 | pages=358–63 | pmc=2256374 | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.1338.358 | pmid=20751675 | issue=1338}}</ref> The condition remained almost universally fatal until the [[Insulin#Discovery_and_characterization|discovery of insulin]] in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29%,<ref name=Eledrisi/> and by the 1950s it had become less than 10%.<ref name=Kitabchi2008>{{cite journal|pmid=18270259|year=2008|month=May|author=Kitabchi AE, Umpierrez GE, Fisher JN, Murphy MB, Stentz FB|title=Thirty years of personal experience in hyperglycemic crises: diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1541–52 |pmc=2386681 |doi=10.1210/jc.2007-2577 |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism}}</ref> The entity of cerebral edema due to DKA was described in 1936 by a team of doctors from Philadelphia.<ref name=Brown2004/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Dillon ES, Riggs HE, Dyer WW | title=Cerebral lesions in uncomplicated fatal diabetic acidosis | journal=American Journal of the Medical Sciences | year=1936 | volume=3 | pages=360–365 | doi=10.1097/00000441-193609000-00007 | issue=3}}</ref>

Numerous research studies since the 1950s have focused on the ideal treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis. A significant proportion of these studies have been conducted at the [[University of Tennessee Health Science Center]] and [[Emory University School of Medicine]].<ref name=Kitabchi2008/> Treatment options studied have included high- or low-dose intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular (e.g. the "[[George Alberti|Alberti]] regime") insulin, phosphate supplementation, need for a loading dose of insulin, and appropriateness of using bicarbonate therapy in moderate DKA.<ref name=Kitabchi2008/> Various questions remain unanswered, such as whether bicarbonate administration in severe DKA makes any real difference to the clinical course, and whether an insulin loading dose is needed in adults.<ref name=Kitabchi2008/>

The entity of ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes was first fully described in 1987 after several preceding case reports. It was initially thought to be a form of [[maturity onset diabetes of the young]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198702053160601 |author=Winter WE, Maclaren NK, Riley WJ, Clarke DW, Kappy MS, Spillar RP |title=Maturity-onset diabetes of youth in black Americans |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=316 |issue=6 |pages=285–91 |year=1987 |month=February |pmid=3543673}}</ref> and went through several other descriptive names (such as "idiopathic type 1 diabetes", "Flatbush diabetes", "atypical diabetes" and "type 1.5 diabetes") before the current terminology of "ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes" was adopted.<ref name=ADA2009/><ref name=Umpierrez2006/>
