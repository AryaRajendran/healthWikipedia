An organ of the [[District of Columbia home rule|devolved district government]], Fire & EMS is responsible for providing [[firefighting|fire suppression]], ambulance service and [[hazardous materials]] containment for the [[Capital districts and territories#United_States|federal district]].<ref name="FEMSabout">{{cite web|url=http://fems.dc.gov/fems/cwp/view,a,3,q,525941,femsNav,31536,.asp|title=About FEMS|publisher=DC FEMS|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:DCFireEngine.jpg|thumb|left|A modern day DC fire engine]]
[[File:Engine Company -23.jpg|thumb|right|DCFD Engine Company #23 (Foggy Bottom Firehouse)]]
On January 13, 1803, prior to the formation of a fire fighting company in the city, Washington's  first law regarding fire control was passed; this law instructed that for every building in the city, the building's owner must provide leather buckets for use in fire suppression.<ref name="FEMShistorypage1">{{cite web|url=http://fems.dc.gov/fems/cwp/view,a,3,q,525920,femsNav_GID,1507.asp|title=FEMS History|work=About FEMS|publisher=DC FEMS|pages=1|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref> Owners were required to provide as many buckets as there were stories to the building. The fine for failure to provide the required number of buckets was one dollar per missing bucket.<ref name="FEMShistorypage1" />

To resolve problems stemming from the rivalry between competing private [[volunteer firefighter|volunteer]] companies, an act to organize a paid fire department was approved in 1864<ref name="FEMShistorypage1" /> and implemented on September 23, 1871, with a combination of paid and volunteer staff.<ref name="FEMShistorypage2" /> This very first incarnation of the fire department had seven paid [[firefighters]] and thirteen call men to answer alarms, manning three engines and two ladders. By 1900, the DCFD had grown to 14 engine, 4 ladder and 2 chemical companies.<ref name="FEMShistorypage2" />

Rescuers and firefighters from the DCFD were major participants in the [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots|1968 riots]] following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] Widespread [[civil unrest]], [[looting]] and [[arson]] resulted in the mobilization of the entire force, along with 70 outside companies, to battle over 500 fires and perform 120 rescues during the four days of disorder.<ref name="FEMShistorypage3">{{cite web|url=http://fems.dc.gov/fems/cwp/view,a,3,q,525934,femsNav_GID,1507.asp|title=FEMS History|work=About FEMS|publisher=DC FEMS|pages=3|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref>

==Budget problems==
In January 2010, ''[[The Washington Examiner]]'' reported that, in a major management failure, the agency failed to budget for seniority pay in its fiscal 2010 budget, causing a $2 million shortfall.<ref name="Budget" /> After a hiring freeze left 130 positions unfilled, the department was projected to spend $15.4 million in fiscal 2010 (2.5 times the budgeted amount).<ref name="Budget" /> More than 75 percent of the agency's budget goes to salaries and fringe benefits.<ref name="Budget" />

==''Nerve Center'' episode==
The DC Fire & EMS Department was profiled in episode 5 of [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Nerve Center (TV Series)|Nerve Center]],<ref name="Nerve_Center">{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverychannel.ca/episodeList.aspx?sid=31780|title=Nerve Center}}</ref> which first aired in June 2011. The episode followed the Department's activities on October 30–31, 2010, including providing emergency medical services at the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] and the 35th [[Marine Corps Marathon]].

==Twitter Controversy==
In late August 2011, the department shuttered it's popular Twitter account.<ref>{{cite news|last=Howell|first=Tom Jr.|title=DC Freezes Fire, EMS Twitter Account|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/21/dc-freezes-fire-ems-twitter-account/?page=all|accessdate=2012-01-01|newspaper=Washington Times|date=2011-09-21|author=Howell|author2=Noble}}</ref>   The new communications director, Lon Walls, stated that "Social media is for parties.  We ain't giving parties."  <ref>{{cite web|last=Austermuhle|first=Martin|title=#Silence: Fire and EMS Twitter Feed to be "Filtered"|url=http://dcist.com/2011/09/silence.php|work=DCist|accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>   The department PIO, Pete Piringer, was transferred to another agency.  After pushback from local media, the account returned, without Piringer, though it no longer reports crime-related events, such as response to stabbings or shootings.<ref name="The Atlantic Cities">{{cite web|last=Sommer|first=Mathis|title=Don't Tweet: In D.C., a New War on Public Safety Information|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/politics/2011/10/dc-government-war-on-public-safety-information/297/|work=Atlantic Cities|accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>
