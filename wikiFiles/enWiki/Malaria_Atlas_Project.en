The '''Malaria Atlas Project''', abbreviated as '''MAP''', is a non-profit project primarily funded by the [[Wellcome Trust]], UK.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hay SI, Snow RW | title = The Malaria Atlas Project: Developing Global Maps of Malaria Risk. | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = e473 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030473 | pmid = 17147467 | pmc = 1762059 }}</ref>  MAP is a joint project between the Malaria Public Health & Epidemiology Group, Centre for Geographic Medicine, [[Kenya]] and the Spatial Ecology & Epidemiology Group, [[University of Oxford]], UK, with collaborating nodes in Americas and Asia Pacific Region.

Spatial medical intelligence is central to the effective planning of malaria control and elimination. Forty years have passed since the cartography of malaria worldwide was taken seriously. The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) was founded in 2005 to fill this niche for the malaria control community at a global scale.

The MAP team have assembled a unique spatial database on linked information based on medical intelligence, satellite-derived climate data to constrain the limits of malaria transmission<ref>{{cite journal | author = Guerra CA, Gikandi PW, Tatem AJ, Noor AM, Smith DL, Hay SI, Snow RW | title = The limits and intensity of ''Plasmodium falciparum'' transmission: implications for malaria control and elimination worldwide. | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e38 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050038 | pmid = 18303939 | pmc = 2253602 }}</ref> and the largest ever archive of community-based estimates of parasite prevalence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Guerra CA, Hay SI, Lucioparedes LS, Gikandi P, Tatem AJ, Noor AM, Snow RW | title = Assembling a global database of malaria parasite prevalence for the Malaria Atlas Project. | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 6 | pages = 17 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-6-17 | pmid = 17306022 | pmc = 1805762 }}</ref> These data have been assembled and analysed by a team of geographers, statisticians, epidemiologists, biologists and public health specialists.

The initial focus of MAP has been centred on predicting the [[endemicity]] of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hay SI, Guerra CA, Gething PW, Patil AP, Tatem AJ, Noor AM, Kabaria CW, Manh BH, Elyazar IRF, Brooker SJ, Smith DL, Moyeed RA, Snow RW | title = A world malaria map: ''Plasmodium falciparum'' endemicity in 2007. | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 6 | pages = e1000048 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000048 | pmid = 19323591 | issue = 3 | pmc = 2659708 | editor1-last = Mueller | editor1-first = Ivo }}</ref> the most deadly form of the malaria parasite, due to its global epidemiological significance and its better prospects for elimination and control. Work in 2009 began to map the extent and burden of the relatively neglected ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]''.
