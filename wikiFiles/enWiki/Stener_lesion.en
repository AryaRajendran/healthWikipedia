A '''Stener lesion''' is a type of traumatic injury to the [[thumb]]. It occurs when the [[aponeurosis]] of the [[adductor pollicis muscle]] becomes interposed between the ruptured [[ulnar collateral ligament (thumb)|ulnar collateral ligament]] (UCL) of the thumb and its site of insertion at the base of the [[proximal]] [[Phalanx bones|phalanx]]. No longer in contact with its insertion site, the UCL cannot spontaneously heal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rectenwald|first=Joseph, M.D.|title=eMedicine - Stener Lesion|publisher=eMedicine|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1240710-overview|accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>

==Gamekeeper's thumb: history and mechanism of injury==
{{Main|Gamekeeper's thumb}}
CS Campbell, an orthopedic surgeon, originally coined the term '''[[gamekeeper's thumb]]''' in 1955, after he observed this condition in a number of Scottish [[gamekeeper]]s.<ref>Campbell CS. Gamekeeper's thumb. J Bone Joint Surg Br. Feb 1955;37-B(1):148-9.</ref> The injury appeared to occur as a result of the particular manner in which they killed small animals such as [[rabbit]]s. Specifically, the animals were placed on the ground, and their necks were broken as the gamekeeper exerted downward pressure with the thumb and [[index finger]]s. This maneuver would place a [[valgus]] force upon the [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abducted]] [[metacarpophalangeal joint|metacarpophalangeal]] (MCP) joint. Over time, this would lead to insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb, a condition which Campbell referred to as ''gamekeeper's thumb''.

In 1962, Bertil Stener described a [[lesion]] which he observed to occur in a subset of patients suffering from gamekeeper's thumb. In these patients, the [[distal]] attachment of the UCL was traumatically [[Avulsion injury|avulsed]] from its site of insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. The severed end of the [[ligament]] would become trapped under the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle and therefore be unable to return to its proper [[anatomic position]]. Consequently, the severed ligament would fold on itself and thus be prevented from healing and restoring stability to the MCP joint.<ref>Stener B. Displacement of the ruptured ulnar collateral ligament of the metacarpophalangeal joint. J Bone Joint Surg Am. Nov 1962;44B(4):869-79.</ref>

For a Stener lesion to occur, both the proper and accessory collateral ligaments of the thumb must be completely ruptured. The Stener lesion is present in more than 80% of complete ruptures of the UCL of the thumb.

==Treatment==
The ulnar collateral ligament is an important stabilizer of the thumb. Thumb instability resulting from disruption of the UCL profoundly impairs the overall function of the involved hand. Because of this, it is critical that these injuries receive appropriate attention and treatment.

Most gamekeeper's thumb injuries are treated by simply immobilizing the joint in a thumb [[spica splint]] or a modified wrist splint and allowing the ligament to heal. However, near total or total tears of the UCL may require surgery to achieve a satisfactory repair, especially if accompanied by a Stener lesion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gamekeeper's Thumb|publisher=[[About.com]]|url=http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/handcondiitions/a/gamekeepers.htm|accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>
