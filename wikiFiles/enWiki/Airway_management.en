'''Airway management''' is the medical process of ensuring there is an open pathway between a patient’s [[lung]]s and the outside world, as well as ensuring the lungs are safe from [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]].  Airway management is a primary consideration in [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], [[anaesthesia]], [[emergency medicine]], [[intensive care medicine]] and [[first aid]].

==Cardiopulmonary resuscitation==
{{Main|cardiopulmonary resuscitation}}
Airway management is a high priority for clinical care. This is because if there is no airway, there can be no breathing, hence no oxygenation of blood and therefore circulation (and hence all the other vital body processes) will soon cease. The ‘A’ is for ‘airway’ in the ‘CAB’ (chest compressions-airway-breathing) of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] according to the 2010 American Heart Association and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation CPR guidelines.

==Airway maneuvers==
===Head-tilt chin-lift===
[[Image:Tongue-blocking-airways.png|thumb|The head-tilt chin-lift is the most reliable method of opening the airway.]]'''Head-tilt chin-lift''' — The head-tilt chin-lift is the primary maneuver used in any patient in whom [[cervical spine]] injury is not a concern.  The simplest way of ensuring an open airway in an unconscious patient is to use a head tilt chin lift technique, thereby lifting the tongue from the back of the throat. This is taught on most [[first aid]] courses as the standard way of clearing an airway.

===Jaw-thrust maneuver===
'''Jaw-thrust maneuver''' — The jaw-thrust maneuver is an effective airway technique, particularly in the patient in whom cervical spine injury is a concern.  The jaw thrust is a technique used on patients with a suspected [[spinal injury]] and is used on a [[supine position|supine]] patient.  The practitioner uses their thumbs to physically push the posterior (back) aspects of the mandible upwards - only possible on a patient with a [[Glasgow Coma Scale|GCS]] < 8 (although patients with a GCS higher than this should also be maintaining their own patent airway).  When the mandible is displaced forward, it pulls the tongue forward and prevents it from occluding (blocking) the entrance to the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], helping to ensure a patent (secure) airway.

The [[ILCOR|International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] no longer advocates use of the jaw thrust by lay rescuers,<ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/22_suppl/III-5 Part 2: Adult Basic Life Support - 112 (22 Supplement): III-5 - Circulation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> even for spinal-injured victims, although health care professionals still maintain the technique for specific applications. Instead, lay rescuers are advised to use the same head-tilt for all victims.

===Cervical spine immobilization===
'''Cervical spine immobilization''' — Most airway maneuvers are associated with some movement of the [[cervical spine]] (c-spine).<ref name="pmid9201858">{{cite journal| author=Donaldson WF, Heil BV, Donaldson VP, Silvaggio VJ| title=The effect of airway maneuvers on the unstable C1-C2 segment.

== Invasive airway management ==
[[File:ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway inflated 001.jpg|thumb|ProSeal Laryngeal Mask Airway inflated 001]]

===Tracheal intubation===
{{Main|Tracheal intubation}}
Tracheal intubation, usually simply referred to as '''[[intubation]]''', is the placement of a flexible plastic or rubber [[catheter|tube]] into the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (windpipe) to maintain an open [[airway]] or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients to facilitate [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] of the lungs, including [[mechanical ventilation]], and to prevent the possibility of [[asphyxia]]tion or airway obstruction. The most widely used route is orotracheal, in which an [[tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]] is passed through the mouth and [[larynx|vocal apparatus]] into the trachea.  In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea.

===Cricothyrotomy===
{{Main|Cricothyrotomy}}
[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|200px|alt=In cricothyrotomy, the incision or puncture is made through the cricothyroid membrane in between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage|In cricothyrotomy, the incision or puncture is made through the [[Cricothyroid ligament|cricothyroid membrane]] in between the [[thyroid cartilage]] and the [[cricoid cartilage]]]]

A cricothyrotomy is an incision made through the skin and [[Cricothyroid ligament|cricothyroid membrane]] to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma.<ref name=Mohan2009>{{cite journal|last=Mohan|first=R|last2=Iyer|first2=R|last3=Thaller|first3=S|title=Airway management in patients with facial trauma|journal=Journal of Craniofacial Surgery|volume=20|issue=1|pages=21–3|year=2009|pmid=19164982|doi=10.1097/SCS.0b013e318190327a}}</ref>  A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed as a last resort in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.<ref name=Katos2007>{{cite journal|first=MG|last=Katos|first2=D|last2=Goldenberg|title=Emergency cricothyrotomy|journal=Operative Techniques in Otolaryngology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=110–4|year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.otot.2007.05.002}}</ref>]

==Adjuncts to airway management==
There are a variety of artificial airways which can be used to keep a pathway between the lungs and mouth/nose. The most commonly used in long term or critical care situations is the [[endotracheal tube]], a plastic tube which is inserted through the mouth and into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], often with a cuff which is inflated to seal off the trachea and prevent any vomit being aspirated into the lungs.  In some cases. a [[laryngeal mask airway]] (LMA) is a suitable alternative to an endotracheal tube, and has the advantage of requiring a lower level of training than that of an ET tube.

In the case of a choking patient, [[laryngoscopy]] or even [[bronchoscopy]] may be performed in order to visualise and remove the blockage.

===Oropharyngeal airway===
{{Main|Oropharyngeal airway}}
'''Oropharyngeal airway''' — Oropharyngeal airways (OPA) are plastic curved devices used to hold tissue (such as the tongue) away from the airway to keep it open. An OPA should only be used in a deeply unresponsive patient who is unable to maintain his or her airway. In responsive patients, they can cause vomiting and aspiration.

===Nasopharyngeal airway===
{{Main|Nasopharyngeal airway}}
'''Nasopharyngeal airway''' — The nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) (also known as nasal trumpet) is a soft rubber or plastic hollow tube that is passed through the nose into the posterior pharynx. Patients tolerate NPAs more easily than OPAs, so NPAs can be used when the use of an OPA is difficult, such as when the patient's jaw is clenched or the patient is semiconscious and cannot tolerate an OPA.<ref name="pmid15911941">{{cite journal| author=Roberts K, Whalley H, Bleetman A| title=The nasopharyngeal airway: dispelling myths and establishing the facts. | journal=Emerg Med J | year= 2005 | volume= 22 | issue= 6 | pages= 394–6 | pmid=15911941 | doi=10.1136/emj.2004.021402 | pmc=1726817   }}</ref>

==Removal of vomit and regurgitation==
In the case of a patient who [[vomiting|vomit]]s or has other secretions in the airway, these techniques will not be enough. Suitably trained clinicians may elect to use suction to clean out the airway, although this may not always be possible. A unconscious patient who is regurgitating stomach contents should be turned into the [[recovery position]] when there is no suction equipment available, as this allows (to a certain extent) the drainage of fluids out of the mouth instead of down the trachea.
