'''Liver cancer''' or '''hepatic cancer''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''hēpar'', meaning liver) is a [[cancer]] that originates in the [[liver]]. Liver cancers are malignant tumors that grow on the surface or inside the liver. Liver tumors are discovered on medical imaging equipment (often by accident) or present themselves symptomatically as an abdominal mass, [[abdominal pain]], [[jaundice]], nausea or liver dysfunction.<ref>http://www.liverfoundation.org/education/info/progression/</ref> Liver cancers should not be confused with liver [[metastases]], which are cancers that originate from organs elsewhere in the body and migrate to the liver.

==Classification==
There are many forms of liver cancer, although many cancers found in the liver are metastases from other [[tumor]]s, frequently of the [[GI tract]] (like [[colon cancer]], [[Carcinoid syndrome|carcinoid tumors]] mainly of the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], ''etc''.), but also from [[breast cancer]], [[ovarian cancer]], [[lung cancer]], [[renal cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], ''etc''.

The most frequent liver cancer is [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] (HCC) (also named ''hepatoma'', which is a misnomer because [[adenoma]]s are usually benign). This tumor also has a variant type that consists of both HCC and [[cholangiocarcinoma]] components. The cells of the [[bile duct]] coexist next to the bile ducts that drain the bile produced by the [[hepatocytes]] of the liver. Cancers that arise from the blood vessel cells in the liver are known as [[hemangioendothelioma]]s.  

As well as mixed tumors, rarer forms of liver cancer include:
* [[Mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal]] tissue
* [[Sarcoma]]
*[[Hepatoblastoma]], a rare malignant tumor, primarily developing in children. Most of these tumors form in the right lobe.
*[[Cholangiocarcinoma]] (bile duct cancers), which account for 1 or 2 out of every 10 cases of liver cancer. These cancers start in the small tubes (called bile ducts) that carry bile to the intestine.
*[[Angiosarcoma]] and [[hemangiosarcoma]]: These are rare forms of cancer that start in the blood vessels of the liver. These tumors grow quickly. Often by the time they are found they are too widespread to be removed. Most patients do not live more than a year after [[diagnosis]].
*[[Lymphoma]] of liver: A rare form of lymphoma that usually have diffuse infiltration to liver. It may also form a liver mass in rare occasions.

== Causes ==
Risk factors for adults developing primary liver cancer:
*[[Hepatitis C]] is the primary cause of liver cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=HR|title=Clinical practice. Chronic hepatitis C infection.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=2011 Jun 23|volume=364|issue=25|pages=2429–38|pmid=21696309|doi=10.1056/NEJMcp1006613}}</ref> 
*Chronic [[Hepatitis B]] infection<ref name=AdultNCI>{{cite web|title=General Information About Adult Primary Liver Cancer|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/adult-primary-liver/HealthProfessional|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>  
*[[Cirrhosis]]<ref name=AdultNCI/>
*[[Aflatoxin]] exposure<ref name=AdultNCI/>
*[[Obesity]] has emerged as an important risk factor as it can lead to [[steatohepatitis]]<ref name=AdultNCI/>

Risk factors for children developing primary liver cancer:
* [[Alagille syndrome]] (associated with HCC)<ref name=ChildNCI>{{cite web|title=Childhood Liver Cancer Treatment|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/childliver/HealthProfessional|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>

* [[Familial adenomatous polyposis]] (associated with hepatoblastoma)<ref name=ChildNCI/>
* [[Glycogen storage diseases]] (associated with both HCC and hepatoblastoma)<ref name=ChildNCI/>
* Hepatitis B infection, associated when contracted in the perinatal period (with transmission at birth) (associated with HCC)<ref name=ChildNCI/>
* [[Low birth weight]] (associated with hepatoblastoma)<ref name=ChildNCI/>
* Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with HCC)<ref name=ChildNCI/>
* [[Trisomy 18]], as well as other trisomies (associated with hepatoblastoma)<ref name=ChildNCI/>
* [[Tyrosinemia]] (associated with HCC)<ref name=ChildNCI/>

==Prevention==
Since hepatitis B or C is one of the main causes of liver cancer, prevention of this infection is key to then prevent liver cancer. Thus, childhood [[vaccination]] against [[hepatitis B vaccine|hepatitis B]] may reduce the risk of liver cancer in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://health.google.com/health/ref/Hepatocellular+carcinoma| title=Hepatocellular carcinoma|date=|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> In the case of patients with [[cirrhosis]], alcohol consumption is to be avoided.

==Management==

A [[PET-CT]] scan may be suggested if doctors are considering surgery as a treatment.  It gives more detailed information about the part of the body being scanned.<ref>http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Cancertype/Liversecondary/Causesdiagnosis/Furthertests</ref>
The correct treatment of liver cancer can mean the difference between life and death. Not all patients with cancers in the liver are potentially curable. These are some of the treatments available: [[Surgery]], [[Chemotherapy]], [[Immunotherapy]], [[Photodynamic Therapy]], [[Hyperthermia]], [[Radiation Therapy]] and [[Radiosurgery]].<ref>[http://www.cyberknifecentrelondon.co.uk/print.php?section=3&number= Radiosurgery treatment for liver cancer]</ref>
