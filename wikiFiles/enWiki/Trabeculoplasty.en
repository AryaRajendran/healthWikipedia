'''Trabeculoplasty''' is a treatment for glaucoma [[plastic]] surgery. It is done on a argon laser equipped slit lamp, using a Goldmann gonioscope lens mirror. The laser is directed to the [[trabecula]]r meshwork. Specifically, argon laser is used so that small openings in the eye's trabecular meshwork, from which the [[aqueous humor]] can drain better - this helps reduce intraocular pressure caused by [[Glaucoma#Classification|open-angle glaucoma]].<ref name="webmd">{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/laser-trabeculoplasty-for-glaucoma|title=Laser trabeculoplasty for glaucoma|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>
