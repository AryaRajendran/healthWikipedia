'''Duverney fractures''' are isolated [[pelvic fracture]]s involving only the [[Ilium (bone)|iliac wing]]. They are caused by direct trauma to the iliac wing, and are generally stable fractures as they do not disrupt the [[weight bearing]] pelvic ring.<ref>[http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_iii_1/d/duverney_fracture.aspx ''Duverney fracture''] at [[Medcyclopaedia]].</ref>

The fracture is named after the [[France|French]] surgeon [[Guichard Joseph Duverney|Joseph Guichard Duverney]] who described the injury in his book ''Maladies des Os'' which was published posthumously in 1751.<ref name="amr"/>

== Diagnosis ==
Duverney fractures can usually be seen on pelvic [[Radiography|X-rays]], but CT scans are required to fully delineate the fracture and to look for associated fractures involving the pelvic ring.<ref name="orthopaedia"/>

== Complications ==
Malunion and [[deformity]] of the iliac wing can occur. Injury to the [[internal iliac artery]] can occur, leading to [[hypovolemia|hypovolaemic]] [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. [[Gastrointestinal perforation|Perforation]] of the [[Colon (anatomy)|bowel]] can occur, leading to [[sepsis]].<ref name="orthopaedia"/> Damage to the adjacent nerves of the [[lumbosacral plexus]] has also been described.<ref name="amr">{{cite journal |last=Amr|first=Sherif M.|author= |authorlink= |coauthors=Abdel-Meguid, Kamal MS; Kholeif, Ahmed M

== Management ==
Since fractures that do not involve the weight bearing part of the pelvic ring tend to be stable fractures, they can often be managed without surgery. These fractures tend to be very painful, so walking aids such as [[crutch]]es or [[Walker (mobility)|walking frames]] may be needed until the pain settles.<ref name="orthopaedia"/>

[[Open reduction internal fixation]] is sometimes required to correct deformity,<ref name="tile">{{cite book|title=Fractures of the pelvis and acetabulum|last=Tile|first=Marvin|coauthors=David Helfet, James Kellam|year= 2003|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-3213-0|pages=263–4}}</ref> and surgery may be required if there is damage to blood vessels, nerves or organs, or if the fracture is open.<ref name="orthopaedia">[http://www.orthopaedia.com/display/Main/Iliac+wing+fractures Iliac wing fractures] at Orthopaedia.com</ref>
