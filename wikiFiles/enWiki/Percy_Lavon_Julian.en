'''Percy Lavon Julian''' (April 11, 1899, Montgomery, Al. – April 19, 1975,  Waukegan, Illinois) was a U.S. research [[chemist]] and a pioneer in the [[chemical synthesis]] of medicinal [[medication|drugs]] from plants.<ref name="Stille" /> He was the first to synthesize the natural product [[physostigmine]], and a pioneer in the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones, [[steroids]], [[progesterone]], and [[testosterone]], from [[plant sterols]] such as [[stigmasterol]] and sitosterol. His work would lay the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of [[cortisone]], other [[corticosteroid]]s, and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]s.<ref name="PBS.org" /><ref name="ChemHeritage.org" /><ref name="USDA-a" /><ref name="AOCS" />

He later started his own company to synthesize steroid intermediates from the Mexican [[wild yam]]. His work helped greatly reduce the cost of steroid intermediates to large multinational pharmaceutical companies, helping to significantly expand the use of several important drugs.<ref name="NOVA" /><ref name="JNMA" />

During his lifetime he received more than 130 chemical patents. Julian was one of the first African-Americans to receive a doctorate in [[chemistry]]. He was the first African-American [[chemist]] inducted into the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and the second African-American scientist inducted from any field.<ref name="NOVA" />

== Early life and education ==

Percy Julian was born in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] as the first child of six born to James Sumner Julian and Elizabeth Lena Julian, née Adams. James, like his wife, a graduate of what was to be [[Alabama State University]] was employed as a clerk in the Railway Service of the [[United States Post Office]], and his father was a [[History of slavery in the United States|slave]].<ref name=1930census /><ref name="Time-1975.05.05" /><ref>[[Media:1900 census Julian.jpg|Julian family]] in the [[United States Census, 1900|1900 U.S. Census]]; [[Montgomery, Alabama]]; He lived with his wife's siblings: Mather P. Adams (1884–? ); George Adams (1886–? ); Carrie L. Adams (1891–? ); Ethel M. Adams (1893–? ). James is listed as a mail carrier.</ref> Elizabeth worked as a school teacher. Percy Julian grew up in the time of the racist [[Jim Crow laws]] culture in the United States. Among his childhood memories was finding a [[Lynching|lynched]] man hung from a tree while walking in the woods near his home. While it was generally unheard of for African-Americans at the time to pursue an education beyond the eight grade, Julian's parents steered all of their  children toward higher education.

Julian attended [[DePauw University]] in [[Greencastle, Indiana]]. The college accepted few African-American students. The segregated nature of the town forced social humiliations. Julian was not allowed to live in the college dormitories and first stayed in an off-campus boarding home, which refused to serve him meals.  It took him days before Julian found an establishment where he could eat. He worked firing the furnace, as a waiter, and doing other odd jobs in a fraternity house.  In return, he was allowed to sleep in the attic and eat at the house. Julian graduated from DePauw in 1920 [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and [[valedictorian]].<ref name="DepauwArchive-b" /> By 1930 Julian's father had moved the entire family to [[Greencastle, Indiana]] so that all his children could attend college at DePauw.  The father was still working as a railroad postal clerk.<ref name=1930census>[[1930 US Census]]; [[Greencastle, Indiana]] with [[Media:1930 census Julian.jpg|Julians]]; James owned his own home valued at $3,000.  Percy Julian's siblings were James Sumner Julian II (1903–?) (Honorary Depauw 1970); Mattie Julian Brown (c1905-1992) (Depauw 1926); Elizabeth Julian White (c1907-2007) (Depauw 1928); Irma D. Julian Raybon (1912–1990) (Depauw 1933); and Emerson R. Julian (1917–1978) (Depauw 1938).</ref>

Julian wanted to obtain his doctorate in chemistry, but learned it would be difficult for an African-American. After graduating from DePauw, Julian became a chemistry instructor at [[Fisk University]]. He then received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry and went to [[Harvard University]] in 1923 for his M.S. Worried that white students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's [[teaching assistant]]ship. He was unable to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.

In 1929, while an instructor at Howard University, Julian received a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship to continue his graduate work at the [[University of Vienna]], where he earned his PhD in 1931. He studied under [[Ernst Späth]] and was considered an impressive student. In Europe, he found freedom from the racial prejudices that had nearly stifled him in the States. He freely participated in intellectual social gatherings, went to the opera and found greater acceptance among his peers.<ref>{{cite news |coauthors= |title=Percy L.

Percy Julian was the second African-American to get a masters degree in chemistry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

--> He was the first African-American chemist inducted into the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and the second African-American scientist inducted from any field.

After returning from [[Vienna]], Julian taught at [[Howard University]] for one year, where he met his future wife, Anna Roselle Johnson (PhD in Sociology, 1937, University of Pennsylvania). They married on December 24, 1935 and had two children: Percy Lavon Julian, Jr. (August 31, 1940 – February 24, 2008), who became a prestigious civil rights lawyer in [[Madison, Wisconsin]];<ref name="WashingtonPost-2008.03.26" />
and Faith Roselle Julian (1944– ), who still resides in their Oak Park home and often makes moving speeches about her father and his contributions to science.<ref name="DepauwArchive-b" />

At Howard, Julian got involved in university politics and set off an embarrassing chain of events. After he goaded, at the University President's request, a white chemist named Jacob Shohan into resigning, Shohan retaliated by releasing to the local African-American newspaper the letters Julian had written to him from [[Vienna]]. The letters contained accounts of Julian's sex life, and criticism of individual Howard faculty members. Julian's laboratory assistant, Robert Thompson, also charged he had found his wife and Julian together in a sexual tryst. When Thompson was fired for filing a lawsuit against the University, he also gave the paper racy letters which Julian had written to him from Vienna. Through the summer of 1932, the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American]]'' published all of Julian's letters. Eventually, the scandal, and its accompanying pressure, forced Julian to resign.  He lost his position, and everything he had worked for.<ref name="NOVA" />

After the scandal, Julian's mentor, William Blanchard, threw him a much-needed lifeline at the lowest point in Julian's career.  Blanchard offered Julian a position to teach [[organic chemistry]] at DePauw University in 1932. Julian helped Josef Pikl, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, to come to the United States to work with him at DePauw. In 1935 Julian and Pikl completed the [[total synthesis]] of [[physostigmine]], and confirmed the structural formula assigned to it. [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]] of [[Oxford University]] in the U.K. was the first to publish a synthesis of physostigmine, but Julian noticed that the melting point of Robinson's end product was wrong, indicating that he had not, in fact, created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural physostigmine from the [[calabar bean]].<ref name="NOVA" />

Julian also extracted [[stigmasterol]], which took its name from ''Physostigma venenosum'', the west African [[calabar bean]] that he hoped could serve as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time in 1934, Butenandt, and Fernholz, in Germany,<ref name="Butenandt" /><ref name="Fernholz" /> had shown that stigmasterol, isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to [[progesterone]] by synthetic organic chemistry.

== Private sector work: Glidden ==

After being denied a professorship at DePauw in 1936 for racial reasons, Julian applied for a job at the Institute of Paper Chemistry (IPC) in Wisconsin. However, the Wisconsin city of Appleton where the institute was located, was a [[sundown town]], forbidding African-Americans from staying overnight, stating directly "No Negro should be bed or boarded overnight in Appleton". DuPauw had offered a job to fellow chemist Josef Pikl, but declined to hire Julian, who had superlative qualifications as an organic chemist, apologizing that they were "unaware he was a Negro<!-- DO NOT CHANGE: Quotations in Wikipedia must use the exact wording and punctuation, as per [[WP:Quote]] -->".<ref name="DepauwNews&Media-2009.02.19" />

Julian wrote to the [[Glidden (paints)|Glidden Company]], a supplier of soybean oil products, in part because his wife was suffering [[infertility]], to request a five gallon sample of the oil to use as his starting point for the synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones.<ref name="ChemHeritage.org" /> After receiving the request, W.J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of director of research at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.<ref name="NOVA" />

Julian supervised the assembly of the plant at Glidden when he arrived in 1936. He then designed and supervised construction of the world's first plant for the production of industrial-grade, isolated soy protein from oil-free soybean meal. Isolated [[soy protein]] could replace the more expensive milk casein in industrial applications such as coating and sizing of paper, glue for making Douglas fir plywood, and in the manufacture of water-based paints.

At the start of World War II Glidden sent a sample of Julian's isolated soy protein to National Foam System Inc. (today a unit of [[Kidde|Kidde Fire Fighting]]) of Philadelphia, PA which used it to develop Aer-O-Foam,<ref name="SOSRubber" /><ref name="Time-1943.12.06" /> the U.S. Navy's beloved fire-fighting "bean soup"; and while not exactly the Julian's brainchild, was given the meticulous care in the preparation of the soy protein that made the [[fire fighting foam]] possible. When a [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzate]] of isolated soy protein was fed into a water stream, the mixture was converted into a foam by means of an aerating nozzle. The soy protein foam was used to smother oil and gasoline fires aboard ships and was particularly useful on aircraft carriers. It saved the lives of thousands of sailors.<ref name="Time-1943.12.06" /> Citing this, in 1947 the [[NAACP]] awarded him the [[Spingarn Medal]], its highest honor.

== Steroids ==
[[File:Julian IHS.jpg|thumb|<center>Percy Julian (c.1940–1950).</center>]]

Julian's research at [[Glidden (paints)|Glidden]] changed direction in 1940 when he began work on synthesizing [[progesterone]], [[estrogen]] and  [[testosterone]] from the [[plant sterol]]s, [[stigmasterol]] and [[sitosterol]], isolated from soybean oil by a [[foam]] technique he invented and patented.<ref name="PBS.org" /><ref name="ChemHeritage.org" /><ref>U.S. Patent 2,273,046</ref> At that time clinicians were discovering many uses for the newly discovered  hormones. However, only minute quantities  could be produced from the extraction of hundreds of pounds of spinal cords.

In 1940 Julian was able to produce 100&nbsp;lb of mixed soy [[sterol]]s daily, which had a value of $10,000, in sex hormones.  Julian was soon [[Ozonide|ozonizing]] 100 pounds daily of mixed [[sterol]] [[Bromide|dibromides]].  The result was the female hormone progesterone which was put on the U.S. market in bulk for the first time.The soy stigmasterol was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone, [[progesterone]], and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 was shipped to the buyer in an armored car.<ref name="AOCS" /> Production of other sex hormones soon followed.<ref name="Witkop" />

His work made possible the production of these hormones on a larger (kilogram) industrial scale, with the potential of reducing the cost of treating hormonal deficiencies.  Julian and his co-workers obtained patents for Glidden on key processes for the preparation of progesterone and testosterone from soybean plant sterols.  Product patents held by a former cartel of European pharmaceutical companies prevented a significant reduction in wholesale and retail prices for clinical use of these hormones in the 1940s<ref name="BusinessWeek-1945.12.22" /><ref name="Fortune-1951.05" /><ref name="Gereffi" />

On April 13, 1949, [[rheumatologist]] [[Philip Hench]] at the [[Mayo Clinic]] announced the dramatic effectiveness of [[cortisone]] in treating [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. The cortisone was produced by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] at great expense using a complex 36-step synthesis developed by chemist [[Lewis Sarett]].  It started with [[deoxycholic acid]] from cattle [[bile acid]]s. On September 30, 1949, Julian announced an improvement in the process of producing cortisone.<ref name="Gibbons 1949" /><ref name="CEN 1949" /><ref name="Lehman 1951" /><ref name="Applezweig 1962" /> This eliminated the need to use [[osmium tetroxide]], which was a rare and expensive chemical.<ref name="Gibbons 1949"/>  By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which may have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with  the cheap and readily available [[pregnenolone]] synthesized from the soybean oil sterol, [[stigmasterol]] of the steroid [[cortexolone]] (also known as [[Cortodoxone|Reichstein's Substance S]]), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; <!--Chem Eng. News,27,2936(1949)--> and possibly [[17-hydroxyprogesterone|17α-hydroxyprogesterone]] and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis,<ref name="Gibbons 1949"/><ref name="CEN 1949"/><ref name="Lehman 1951"/><ref name="Applezweig 1962" /><ref name="Nat.AcademyOfSciences-bio" /> but unfortunately they were not.<ref name="Applezweig 1962" />

On April 5, 1952, [[biochemist]] Durey Peterson and [[microbiologist]] Herbert Murray at [[Upjohn]] published the first report of a [[industrial fermentation|fermentation]] process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common [[molds]] of the order [[Mucorales]]). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydroxycortisone ([[cortisol]]).<ref name="Peterson" />

After two years, Glidden abandoned production of cortisone to concentrate on Substance S. Julian developed an excellent multistep process for conversion of [[pregnenolone]]<!--an intermediate in the synthesis of [[progesterone]] from [[stigmasterol]]-->, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols to [[cortexolone]]. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by [[Russell Marker]] after leaving [[Syntex]]). Glidden's cost of production of [[cortexolone]] was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and hydro cortisone.<ref name="Applezweig 1962"/>

In 1953, Glidden decided to leave the steroid business which had been relatively unprofitable over the years despite Julian's innovative work.<ref name="Shurtleff" /> On December 1, 1953, Julian left Glidden after 18 years, giving up a salary of nearly $50,000 a year, to found his own company, Julian Laboratories, Inc., taking over the small, concrete-block building of Suburban Chemical Company in [[Franklin Park, Illinois]].<ref name="ChicagoTribune-1953.12.02" /><ref name="ChicagoTribune-1963.01.06" />

On December 2, 1953, [[Pfizer]]   acquired exclusive licenses of Glidden patents for the synthesis of Substance S. Pfizer had developed a fermentation process for microbial 11β-oxygenation of steroids in a single step that could convert Substance S  directly to 11β-hydrocortisone (cortisol), with Syntex undertaking large-scale production of [[cortexolone]] at very low cost.<ref name="Applezweig 1962" />

== Oak Park and Julian Laboratories ==

Around 1950 Julian moved his family from Chicago to the village of [[Oak Park, Illinois]], where the Julians were the first African-American family.<ref name="DuSableMuseum" />  Although some residents welcomed them into the community, there was also opposition by some. Their home was fire-bombed on [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]], 1950, before they moved in.  After the Julians had moved to Oak Park, the house was attacked with dynamite on June 12, 1951.  The attacks galvanized the community and a community group was formed to support the Julians.<ref name="NewYorkTimes-1950.11.23" /> Julian's son later recounted that during these times, he and his father often kept watch over the family's property by sitting in a tree with a shotgun.<ref name="NOVA" />

In 1953, Julian founded his own research firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought many of his best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of [[progesterone]]. To compete against [[Syntex]], he would have to use the same [[Mexican yam]] as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Nazi European holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.

In July 1956, Julian and executives of two other American companies trying to enter the Mexican steroid intermediates market appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee.  They testified that Syntex was using undue influence to monopolize access to the Mexican yam.<ref name="Gereffi" /><ref name="U.S.SenateWonderDrugs-1957" /> The hearings resulted in Syntex signing a [[consent decree]] with the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]]. While it did not admit to restraining trade, it promised not to do so in the future.<ref name="Gereffi"/> Within five years, large American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] had acquired all six producers of steroid intermediates in Mexico. Four had been Mexican-owned.<ref name="Gereffi" />

Syntex reduced the cost of bulk progesterone as an intermediate more than 250-fold over twelve years, from $80 per gram in 1943 to $0.31 per gram in 1955.<ref name="Gereffi" /><ref name="U.S.SenateWonderDrugs-1957" /> Competition from Upjohn and [[General Mills]], who had together made very substantial improvements in the production of progesterone from stigmasterol, forced the price of Mexican progesterone down to less than $0.15 per gram in 1957.  The price continued to fall, bottoming out at $0.08 per gram in 1968.<ref name="Gereffi" /><ref name="Applezweig 1962" />

In 1958, Upjohn purchased 6,900&nbsp;kg of progesterone from Syntex at $0.135 per gram, 6,201&nbsp;kg of progesterone from [[G. D. Searle & Company|Searle]] (who had acquired Pesa) at $0.143 per gram, 5,150&nbsp;kg of progesterone from Julian Laboratories at $0.14 per gram, and 1,925&nbsp;kg of progesterone from General Mills (who had acquired Protex) at $0.142 per gram.<ref name="AdministeredPrices" />

Despite continually falling bulk prices of steroid intermediates, an oligopoly of large American multinational pharmaceutical companies kept the wholesale prices of corticosteroid drugs fixed and unchanged into the 1960s.  Cortisone was fixed at $5.48 per gram from 1954, [[hydrocortisone]] fixed at $7.99 per gram from 1954, and [[prednisone]] fixed at $35.80 per gram from 1956.<ref name="Gereffi" /><ref name="AdministeredPrices" /> [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] and [[Roussel Uclaf]] concentrated on improving the production of corticosteroids from cattle bile acids.  In 1960 Roussel produced almost one-third of the world's corticosteroids from bile acids.<ref name="Applezweig 1962" />

One year Julian Laboratories chemists found a way to quadruple the yield on a product on which they were barely breaking even.  Julian reduced their price for the product from $4,000 per kg down to $400 per kg.<ref name="NOVA" /> He sold the company in 1961, for $2.3 million dollars.<ref name="CPI-InflationCalc" /> The U.S. and Mexico facilities were purchased by [[GlaxoSmithKline|Smith Kline]] and Julian's chemical plant in Guatemala was purchased by [[Upjohn]].

In 1964, Julian founded Julian Associates and Julian Research Institute, which he managed for the rest of his life.<ref name="DepauwArchive-c" />

== National Academy of Sciences ==

He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1973 in recognition of his scientific achievements.<ref name="NOVA" /> He became the second African-American to be inducted, after [[David Blackwell]].

== Death ==

Julian died of liver cancer on April 19, 1975 in St. Theresa's Hospital in [[Waukegan, Illinois]] and was buried in Elm Lawn Cemetery in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]].<ref name="Time-1975.05.05" /><ref name="NewYorkTimes-1975.04.21" /><ref name="WashingtonPost-1975.04.22" />

In 1952 the Glidden Co., which until then had been producing progesterone and other steroids from stigmasterol, shifted over to Mexican sources through an arrangement with Diosynth and closed down its own production. The Glidden research director, Percy Julian, and his staff had worked out an excellent synthesis for Compound "S" which started from 16-dehydropregnenolone. The latter compound was directly available from diosgenin but would have been of prohibitive cost if prepared from soya sterols. Since Compound "S" differed from cortisone only by the absence of an oxygen at 11, there were high hopes that Compound "S" would succeed where pregnenolone had failed, as a substitute for cortisone. Compound "S" also proved to be an ineffective precursor when fed to patients with arthritic disease; in fact, it aggravated rather than relieved their symptoms.<br/>p. 30:<br/>The Glidden Company also ventured further afield from its soya sterols to exploit some of the researches of Julian, which were designed to improve the conversion of desoxycholic acid to cortisone. After 2 years, Glidden decided to abandon the production of cortisone from bile acid and to concentrate instead on Compound "S," which now loomed as a competitor for progesterone in processes which could convert it via fermentation to cortisone and hydrocortisone.<br/>Since Glidden's cost of production of Compound "S" was still relatively high, the progesterone group won out, and progesterone [from diosgenin] still remains the raw material of choice at Upjohn.}}</ref>
