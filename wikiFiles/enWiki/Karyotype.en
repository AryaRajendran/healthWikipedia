A '''karyotype''' (Greek ''karyon'' = kernel, seed or nucleus) is the number and [[Visual_appearance|appearance]] of [[chromosome]]s in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a [[eukaryotic]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a [[species]], or an individual organism.<ref>Concise Oxford 
Dictionary</ref><ref name="White2">White M.J.D. 1973. ''The chromosomes''. 6th ed, Chapman & Hall, London. p. 28</ref><ref>Stebbins G.L. 1950. ''Variation and evolution in plants''. Chapter XII: The Karyotype. Columbia University Press NY.</ref> 

Karyotypes describe the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a light [[microscope]]. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the [[centromere]]s, banding pattern, any differences between the [[sex chromosome]]s, and any other physical characteristics.<ref>King R.C., Stansfield W.D. and Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford U.P Oxford & NY. p242</ref> The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of [[cytogenetics]].

[[File:NHGRI human male karyotype.png|thumbnail|250px|Karyogram of human male using [[Giemsa]] staining]] 
The study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as ''karyology''. The chromosomes are depicted (by rearranging a microphotograph) in a standard format known as a ''karyogram'' or ''idiogram'': in pairs, ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size.

The basic number of chromosomes in the [[somatic]] cells of an individual or a species is called the ''somatic number'' and is designated ''2n''. Thus, in humans 2n = 46. In the [[germ-line]] (the sex cells) the chromosome number is ''n'' (humans: n = 23).<ref name="White2"/><sup>p28</sup>

So, in normal [[diploid]] organisms, [[autosomal]] chromosomes are present in two copies. There may, or may not, be [[sex chromosomes]]. [[polyploidy|Polyploid]] cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and [[ploidy|haploid]] cells have single copies. 

The study of karyotypes is important for [[cell biology]] and [[genetics]], and the results may be used in [[evolutionary biology]] (''[[systematics|karyosystematics]]''<ref>http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Karyosystematics</ref>)  and [[medicine]]. Karyotypes can be used for many purposes; such as to study [[chromosomal aberration]]s, [[cell biology|cellular]] function, [[taxonomic]] relationships, and to gather information about past [[evolutionary]] events.

== History of karyotype studies ==
Chromosomes         were first observed in plant cells by [[Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli]] in 1842. Their behavior in animal ([[salamander]]) cells was described by [[Walther Flemming]], the discoverer of [[mitosis]], in 1882. The name was coined by another German anatomist, [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|von Waldeyer]] in 1888.

The next stage took place after the development of genetics in the early 20th century, when it was appreciated that  chromosomes (the karyotype) was the carrier of  genes. Levitsky seems to have been the first to define the karyotype as the [[phenotypic]] appearance of the [[somatic]] chromosomes, in contrast to their [[gene|genic]] contents.<ref>Levitsky G.A. 1924. ''The material basis of heredity''. State Publication Office of the Ukraine, Kiev. [in Russian]</ref><ref>Levitsky G.A. 1931. The morphology of chromosomes. ''Bull. Applied Bot. Genet. Plant Breed''. '''27''', 19-174.</ref> The subsequent history of the concept can be followed in the works of Darlington<ref>Darlington C.D. 1939. ''Evolution of genetic systems''. Cambridge University Press. 2nd ed, revised and enlarged, 1958. Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh.</ref> and [[Michael JD White|White]].<ref name="White2"/><ref name="White1">White M.J.D. 1973. ''Animal cytology and evolution''. 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press.</ref>

Investigation into the human karyotype took many years to settle the most basic question: how many chromosomes does a normal [[diploid]] human cell contain?<ref>Kottler M. 1974. From 48 to 46: cytological technique, preconception and the counting of the human chromosomes. ''Bull. Hist. Med''. '''48''', 465-502.</ref> In 1912, [[Hans von Winiwarter]] reported 47 chromosomes in [[spermatogonia]] and 48 in [[oogonia]], concluding an [[XO sex-determination system|XX/XO]] [[sex determination]] mechanism.<ref>von Winiwarter H. 1912. Etudes sur la spermatogenese humaine. ''Arch. biologie'' '''27''', 93, 147–-49.</ref> [[Theophilus Painter|Painter]] in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid  of humans was 46 or 48, at first favouring 46,<ref>Painter T.S. 1922. The spermatogenesis of man. ''Anat. Res.'' '''23''', 129</ref> but revised his opinion from 46 to 48, and he correctly insisted on humans having an [[XY sex-determination system|XX/XY]] system.<ref>Painter T.S. 1923. Studies in mammalian spermatogenesis II. ''J. Expt. Zoology'' '''37''', 291–336</ref> Considering the techniques of the time, these results were remarkable.

[[Image:Chromosome2 merge.png|right | frame | Fusion of ancestral chromosomes left distinctive remnants of telomeres, and a vestigial centromere]]

In textbooks, the number of human chromosomes remained at 48 for over thirty years. New techniques were needed to correct this error. [[Joe Hin Tjio]] working in [[Albert Levan]]'s lab<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/dec/11/guardianobituaries.medicalscience|title=Joe Hin Tjio The man who cracked the chromosome count|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Wright, Pearce|date=11 December 2001}}</ref> was responsible for finding the approach:
# Using cells in [[tissue culture]]
# Pretreating cells in a [[Tonicity#Hypotonicity|hypotonic solution]], which swells them and spreads the chromosomes
# Arresting [[mitosis]] in [[metaphase]] by a solution of [[colchicine]]
# Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane
# Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.

The work took place in 1955, and was published in 1956. The karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes.<ref>Tjio J.H & Levan A. 1956. The chromosome number of man. ''Hereditas'' '''42''', 1-6.</ref><ref name="Hsu">Hsu T.C. 1979. ''Human and mammalian cytogenetics: a historical perspective''. Springer-Verlag, NY.</ref> Rather interestingly, the [[great apes]] have 48 chromosomes. [[Human chromosome 2]] is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes.<ref name="fusion">[http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm Human chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes] Alec MacAndrew; accessed 18 May 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-WAHpC0Ah0 Evidence of common ancestry: human chromosome 2] (video) 2007</ref>

== Observations on karyotypes ==
=== Staining ===
The study of karyotypes is made possible by [[staining]]. Usually, a suitable [[dye]], such as [[Giemsa]],<ref>A preparation which includes the dyes Methylene Blue, Eosin Y and Azure-A,B,C</ref> is applied after [[Cell (biology)|cells]] have been arrested during [[cell division]] by a solution of [[colchicine]]. For humans, [[white blood cells]] are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in [[tissue culture]].<ref name="Gustashaw K.M 1991">Gustashaw K.M. 1991. Chromosome stains. In ''The ACT Cytogenetics Laboratory Manual'' 2nd ed, ed. M.J. Barch. The Association of Cytogenetic Technologists, Raven Press, New York.</ref> Sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing ([[interphase]]) cells. The sex of an unborn [[fetus]] can be determined by observation of interphase cells (see [[Amniocentesis|amniotic centesis]] and [[Barr body]]).

=== Observations ===
Six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared:<ref>Stebbins G.L. 1971. ''Chromosomal evolution in higher plants''. Arnold, London. p85-6</ref>
# Differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes.  Chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family.  For example, the legumes ''[[Lotus tenuis]]'' and ''[[Vicia faba]]'' each have six pairs of chromosomes, yet ''V. faba'' chromosomes are many times larger.  These differences probably reflect different amounts of DNA duplication.
# Differences in the position of [[centromeres]].  These differences probably came about through [[translocations]].
# Differences in relative size of chromosomes.  These differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths.
# Differences in basic number of chromosomes.  These differences could have resulted from successive unequal translocations which removed all the essential genetic material from a chromosome, permitting its loss without penalty to the organism (the dislocation hypothesis) or through fusion.  Humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes.  Human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes, and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes.
# Differences in number and position of satellites.  Satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread.
# Differences in degree and distribution of [[heterochromatin|heterochromatic]] regions.  Heterochromatin stains darker than [[euchromatin]].  Heterochromatin is packed tighter.  Heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive DNA sequences.  Euchromatin is usually under active transcription.

A full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number, type, shape and banding of the chromosomes, as well as other cytogenetic information.

Variation is often found:
# between the sexes,
# between the [[germ-line]] and [[soma (biology)|soma]] (between [[gametes]] and the rest of the body),
# between members of a population ([[polymorphism (biology)|chromosome polymorphism]]),
# in [[allopatric speciation|geographic specialization]], snd
# in [[Mosaic (genetics)|Mosaics]] or otherwise abnormal individuals.<ref name="White1"/>

=== Human karyotype ===
The normal human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of [[Autosome|autosomal]] chromosomes and one pair of [[sex chromosomes]]. Normal karyotypes for [[females]] contain two [[X chromosome]]s and are denoted 46,XX; [[males]] have both an X and a [[Y chromosome]] denoted 46,XY. Any variation from the standard karyotype may lead to developmental abnormalities.

== Diversity and evolution of karyotypes ==
Although the [[DNA replication|replication]] and [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[DNA]] is highly standardized in [[eukaryotes]], the same cannot be said for their karyotypes, which are highly variable. There is variation between species in chromosome number, and in detailed o            rganization, despite their construction from the same [[Chromatin|macromolecules]]. This variation provides the basis for a range of studies in evolutionary [[cell biology|cytology]].

In some cases there is even significant variation within species. In a review, Godfrey and Masters conclude: 
:"In our view, it is unlikely that one process or the other can independently account for the wide range of karyotype structures that are observed... But, used in conjunction with other phylogenetic data, karyotypic fissioning may help to explain dramatic differences in diploid numbers between closely related species, which were previously inexplicable.<ref>Godfrey L.R. and Masters J.C. 2000. Kinetophore reproduction theory may explain rapid chromosome evolution. ''PNAS'' '''97''', 9821&ndash;9823. http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=34032</ref>

Although much is known about karyotypes at the descriptive level, and it is clear that changes in karyotype organization has had effects on the evolutionary course of many species, it is quite unclear what the general significance might be.
:"We have a very poor understanding of the causes of karyotype evolution, despite many careful investigations... the general significance of karyotype evolution is obscure." Maynard Smith.<ref>Maynard Smith J. 1998. ''Evolutionary genetics''. 2nd ed, Oxford. p218-9</ref>

=== Changes during development ===
Instead of the usual gene repression, some organisms go in for large-scale elimination of [[heterochromatin]], or other kinds of visible adjustment to the karyotype.

* Chromosome elimination. In some species, as in many [[Sciaridae|sciarid flies]], entire chromosomes are eliminated during development.<ref>Goday C. and Esteban M.R. 2001. Chromosome elimination in sciarid flies. ''Bioessays'' '''23''': 242–250.</ref>

* Chromatin diminution (founding father: [[Theodor Boveri]]). In this process, found in some [[copepods]] and [[roundworms]] such as ''[[Ascaris suum]]'', portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells. This process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost.<ref>Müller F. Bernard V. & Tobler H. 1996. Chromatin diminution in nematodes. ''Bioessays'' '''18''': 133–138.</ref><ref>Wyngaard G.A. & Gregory T.R. 2001. Temporal control of DNA replication and the adaptive value of chromatin diminution in copepods. ''J. Exp. Zool.'' '''291''': 310–16.</ref> In ''A. suum'', all the somatic cell precursors undergo chromatin diminution.<ref>Gilbert S.F. 2006. ''Developmental biology''. Sinauer Associates, Stamford CT. 8th ed, Chapter 9</ref>

* [[X-inactivation]]. The inactivation of one X chromosome takes place during the early development of mammals (see [[Barr body]] and [[dosage compensation]]). In [[placental mammals]], the inactivation is random as between the two Xs; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her X chromosomes. In [[marsupials]] it is always the paternal X which is inactivated. In human females some 15% of somatic cells escape inactivation.<ref>King R.C., Stansfield W.D. and Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford U.P Oxford & NY.</ref>

=== Number of chromosomes in a set ===
A spectacular example of variability between closely related species is the [[muntjac]], which was investigated by [[Kurt Benirschke]] and his colleague [[Doris Wurster]]. The diploid number of the Chinese muntjac, ''[[Muntiacus reevesi]]'', was found to be 46, all [[telocentric]]. When they looked at the karyotype of the closely related Indian muntjac, ''[[Muntiacus muntjak]]'', they were astonished to find it had female = 6, male = 7 chromosomes.<ref>Wurster D.H. and Benirschke K. 1970. Indian Muntjac, ''Muntiacus muntjak'': a deer with a low diploid number. ''Science'' '''168''', 1364-1366.</ref> 

:"They simply could not believe what they saw... They kept quiet for two or three years because they thought something was wrong with their tissue culture... But when they obtained a couple more specimens they confirmed [their findings]" Hsu p73-4<ref name="Hsu"/>

The number of chromosomes in the karyotype between (relatively) unrelated species is hugely variable. The low record is held by the [[nematode]] ''[[Parascaris univalens]]'', where the [[haploid]] n = 1; and an ant: ''[[Myrmecia pilosula]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Crosland M.W.J. & Crozier, R.H.|year=1986|title=''Myrmecia pilosula'', an ant with only one pair of chromosomes|journal=Science|volume=231|pages=1278|doi=10.1126/science.231.4743.1278|pmid=17839565|issue=4743|bibcode=1986Sci...231.1278C}}</ref> The high record would be somewhere amongst the [[fern]]s, with the Adder's Tongue Fern ''[[Ophioglossum]]'' ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes.<ref>Khandelwal S. 1990.

===Fundamental number===
The fundamental number, ''FN'', of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes.<ref name = "Matthey">{{Cite journal

=== Ploidy ===
[[Ploidy]] is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell.
* [[Polyploidy]], where there are more than two sets of homologous chromosomes in the cells, occurs mainly in plants. It has been of major significance in plant evolution according to [[G. Ledyard Stebbins|Stebbins]].<ref>Stebbins, G.L. 1940. The significance of polyploidy in plant evolution. ''The American Naturalist'' '''74''', 54–66.</ref><ref>Stebbins G.L. 1950.

Arnold, London.</ref> Polyploidy in lower plants ([[fern]]s, [[horsetails]] and [[psilotales]]) is also common, and some species of ferns have reached levels of polyploidy far in excess of the highest levels known in flowering plants.<br />Polyploidy in animals is much less common, but it has been significant in some groups.<ref>Gregory T.R. & Mable B.K. 2005. Polyploidy in animals. In ''The Evolution of the genome'' Gregory T.R. (ed). Elsevier, San Diego. pp427–517</ref><br />Polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single basic number are known as [[euploid]].

* [[Haplo-diploid sex-determination system|Haplo-diploidy]], where one sex is diploid, and the other haploid. It is a common arrangement in the [[Hymenoptera]], and in some other groups.

* [[Endopolyploidy]] occurs  when in adult [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] tissues the cells have ceased to divide by [[mitosis]], but the [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] contain more than the original [[somatic cell|somatic]] number of [[chromosomes]].<ref>White M.J.D. 1973.

* See [[paleopolyploidy|palaeopolyploidy]] for the investigation of ancient karyotype duplications.

=== Aneuploidy ===
[[Aneuploidy]] is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species. This would give rise to a [[chromosome abnormality]] such as an extra chromosome or one or more chromosomes lost. Abnormalities in chromosome number usually cause a defect in development. [[Down syndrome]] and [[Turner syndrome]] are examples of this.

Aneuploidy may also occur within a group of closely related species. Classic examples in plants are the genus ''[[Crepis]]'', where the gametic (= haploid)
numbers form the series x = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; and ''[[Crocus]]'', where every number from x = 3 to x = 15 is represented by at least one species. Evidence of various kinds shows that that trends of evolution have gone in different directions in different groups.<ref>Stebbins, G. Ledley, Jr. 1972. ''Chromosomal evolution in higher plants''. Nelson, London. p18</ref> Closer to home, the [[great apes]] have 24x2 chromosomes whereas humans have 23x2. [[Human chromosome 2]] was formed by a merger of ancestral chromosomes, reducing the number.<ref>Ijdo J.W. et al 1991. Origin of human chromosome 2: an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' '''88''': 9051–55.</ref>

=== Chromosomal polymorphism ===
Some animal species are [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] for chromosome fusions or dissociations.<ref>''Polymorphism'': when two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same interbreeding population of a species. Ford E.B. 1975. ''Ecological genetics'', 4th ed.</ref> When this happens, the chromosome number is variable from one individual to another. Well-researched examples are the ladybird beetle ''[[Chilocorus stigma]]'', some [[mantids]] of the genus ''[[Ameles]]'', the European shrew ''[[Sorex araneus]]''. There is some evidence from the case of the [[mollusc]] ''[[Thais lapillus]]'' (the [[dog whelk]]) on the [[Brittany]] coast, that the two chromosome morphs are [[Adaptation|adapted]] to different habitats.<ref>White M.J.D. 1973. ''The chromosomes''. Chapman & Hall, London. p169</ref>

=== Species trees ===
The detailed study of chromosome banding in insects with [[polytene chromosome]]s can reveal relationships between closely related species: the classic example is the study of chromosome banding in Hawaiian [[Drosophila|drosophilids]] by [[Hampton Carson]].

In about {{convert|6500|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, the [[Hawaiian Islands]] have the most diverse collection of drosophilid flies in the world, living from [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests|rainforests]] to [[Hawaiian tropical high shrublands|subalpine meadows]]. These roughly 800 Hawaiian drosophilid species are usually assigned to two genera, ''[[Drosophila]]'' and ''[[Drosophila|Scaptomyza]]'', in the family [[Drosophilidae]].

The polytene banding of the 'picture wing' group, the best-studied group of Hawaiian drosophilids, enabled Carson to work out the evolutionary tree long before genome analysis was practicable. In a sense, gene arrangements are visible in the banding patterns of each chromosome. Chromosome rearrangements, especially [[Chromosome inversions|inversions]], make it possible to see which species are closely related.

The results are clear. The inversions, when plotted in tree form (and independent of all other information), show a clear "flow" of species from older to newer islands. There are also cases of colonization back to older islands, and skipping of islands, but these are much less frequent. Using [[radiometric dating|K-Ar]] dating, the present islands date from 0.4 million years ago (mya) ([[Mauna Kea]]) to 10mya ([[Necker Island (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands)|Necker]]). The oldest member of the Hawaiian archipelago still above the sea is [[Kure Atoll]], which can be dated to 30 mya. The archipelago itself (produced by the [[Pacific plate]] moving over a [[Hot spot (geology)|hot spot]]) has existed for far longer, at least into the [[Cretaceous]]. Previous islands now beneath the sea ([[guyot]]s) form the [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain|Emperor Seamount Chain]].<ref>Clague D.A. & G.B. Dalrymple. 1987. The Hawaiian-Emperor volcanic chain, Part I. Geologic evolution. In R.W. Decker, T.L. Wright & P.H. Stauffer (eds) ''Volcanism in Hawaii''. U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1350, 5-54.</ref>

All of the native ''Drosophila'' and ''Scaptomyza'' species in Hawai{{okina}}i have apparently descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands, probably 20 million years ago. The subsequent [[adaptive radiation]] was spurred by a lack of [[Competition (biology)|competition]] and a wide variety of [[Vacant niche|niches]]. Although it would be possible for a single [[gravid]] female to colonise an island, it is more likely to have been a group from the same species.<ref>Carson H.L. 1970.

== Depiction of karyotypes ==
=== Types of banding ===
[[Cytogenetics]] employs several techniques to visualize different aspects of chromosomes:<ref name="Gustashaw K.M 1991"/>
* [[G-banding]] is obtained with [[Giemsa]] stain following digestion of chromosomes with [[trypsin]]. It yields a series of lightly and darkly stained bands - the dark regions tend to be heterochromatic, late-replicating and AT rich. The light regions tend to be euchromatic, early-replicating and GC rich. This method will normally produce 300-400 bands in a normal, [[human genome]].
* R-banding is the reverse of G-banding (the R stands for "reverse"). The dark regions are euchromatic (guanine-cytosine rich regions) and the bright regions are heterochromatic (thymine-adenine rich regions).
* C-banding: Giemsa binds to [[constitutive heterochromatin]], so it stains [[centromere]]s.
* Q-banding is a [[fluorescent]] pattern obtained using [[quinacrine]] for staining. The pattern of bands is very similar to that seen in G-banding.
* T-banding: visualize [[telomere]]s.
* Silver staining: [[Silver nitrate]] stains the [[nucleolar organization region]]-associated protein.  This yields a dark region where the silver is deposited, denoting the activity of rRNA genes within the NOR.

=== Classic karyotype cytogenetics ===
[[File:PLoSBiol3.5.Fig7ChromosomesAluFish.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Karyogram from a human female [[lymphocyte]] probed for the [[Alu sequence]] using [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]].]]
In the "classic" (depicted) karyotype, a [[dye]], often [[Giemsa]] ''(G-banding)'', less frequently [[Quinacrine]], is used to stain bands on the chromosomes. Giemsa is specific for the [[phosphate]] groups of [[DNA]]. Quinacrine binds to the [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]-rich regions. Each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern.

Karyotypes are arranged with the short arm of the chromosome on top, and the long arm on the bottom.  Some karyotypes call the short and long arms ''p'' and ''q'', respectively.  In addition, the differently stained regions and sub-regions are given numerical designations from [[proximal]] to [[distal]] on the chromosome arms.  For example, [[Cri du chat]] syndrome involves a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. It is written as 46,XX,5p-. The critical region for this syndrome is deletion of p15.2 (the [[locus (genetics)|locus]] on the chromosome), which is written as 46,XX,del(5)(p15.2).<ref>{{cite book|editor=Lisa G.

=== Spectral karyotype (SKY technique) ===
[[File:Sky spectral karyotype.png|thumbnail|250px|Spectral karyogram of a human female]]
Spectral karyotyping is a molecular [[cytogenetic]] technique used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of [[chromosome]]s in an organism in different colors. [[Fluorescent]]ly labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different [[fluorophore]]s. Because there are a limited number of spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Spectral differences generated by combinatorial labeling are captured and analyzed by using an [[interferometer]] attached to a fluorescence microscope. Image processing software then assigns a [[false color|pseudo color]] to each spectrally different combination, allowing the visualization of the individually colored chromosomes.<ref>E. Schröck, S. du Manoir, T. Veldman, B. Schoell, J. Wienberg, M. A. Ferguson-Smith, Y. Ning, D. H. Ledbetter, I. Bar-Am, D. Soenksen, Y. Garini, T. Ried. Multicolor spectral karyotyping of human chromosomes. ''Science'', 26 July 1996; 273 (5274):494.

This technique is used to identify structural chromosome aberrations in cancer cells and other disease conditions when Giemsa banding or other techniques are not accurate enough.

=== Digital karyotyping ===

''Digital karyotyping'' is a technique used to quantify the DNA copy number on a genomic scale. Short sequences of DNA from specific loci all over the genome are isolated and enumerated.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/202610899v1 Digital karyotyping - Wang et al., 10.1073/pnas.202610899 - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This method is also known as [[Virtual Karyotype|virtual karyotyping]].

== Chromosome abnormalities ==
{{main|Chromosome abnormalities}}
Chromosome abnormalities can be numerical, as in the presence of extra or missing chromosomes, or structural, as in [[derivative chromosome]], [[chromosomal translocation|translocations]], [[chromosomal inversion|inversions]], large-scale deletions or duplications. Numerical abnormalities, also known as [[aneuploidy]], often occur as a result of [[nondisjunction]] during [[meiosis]] in the formation of a [[gamete]]; [[trisomy|trisomies]], in which three copies of a chromosome are present instead of the usual two, are common numerical abnormalities. Structural abnormalities often arise from errors in [[homologous recombination]]. Both types of abnormalities can occur in gametes and therefore will be present in all cells of an affected person's body, or they can occur during [[mitosis]] and give rise to a [[genetic mosaic]] individual who has some normal and some abnormal cells.

Chromosomal abnormalities that lead to disease in humans include

* [[Turner syndrome]] results from a single X chromosome (45, X or 45, X0).
* [[Klinefelter syndrome]], the most common male chromosomal disease, otherwise known as 47, XXY is caused by an extra '''X''' chromosome.
* [[Edwards syndrome]] is caused by [[trisomy]] (three copies) of chromosome 18.
* [[Down syndrome]], a common chromosomal disease, is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21.
* [[Patau syndrome]] is caused by trisomy of chromosome 13.
* Also documented are trisomy 8, trisomy 9 and trisomy 16, although they generally do not survive to birth.

Some disorders arise from loss of just a piece of one chromosome, including

* [[Cri du chat]] (cry of the cat), from a truncated short arm on chromosome 5.  The name comes from the babies' distinctive cry, caused by abnormal formation of the larynx.
* [[1p36 Deletion Syndrome|1p36 Deletion syndrome]], from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1.
* [[Angelman syndrome]] &ndash; 50% of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing; a deletion of the maternal genes, example of [[genomic imprinting|imprinting]] disorder.
* [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] &ndash; 50% of cases have a segment of the long arm of chromosome 15 missing; a deletion of the paternal genes, example of imprinting disorder.

Chromosomal abnormalities can also occur in [[cancer]]ous cells of an otherwise genetically normal individual; one well-documented example is the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], a translocation mutation commonly associated with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] and less often with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].
