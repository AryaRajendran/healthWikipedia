'''Hemolytic anemia''' (or '''haemolytic anaemia''') is a form of [[anemia]] due to [[hemolysis]], the abnormal breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs), either in the [[blood vessel]]s (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular). It has numerous possible causes, ranging from relatively harmless to life-threatening. The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either [[heredity|inherited]] or acquired. Treatment depends on the cause and nature of the breakdown.

Symptoms of hemolytic anemia are similar to other forms of anemia ([[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and [[shortness of breath]]), but in addition, the breakdown of red cells leads to [[jaundice]] and increases the risk of particular long-term complications, such as [[gallstone]]s and [[pulmonary hypertension]].

==Basic features==
Hemolytic anemia involves the following:
# Abnormal and accelerated destruction of red cells and, in some anemias, their precursors 
# Increased breakdown of hemoglobin, which may result in:
## increased [[bilirubin]] level (mainly indirect-reacting) with jaundice
## increased fecal and urinary [[urobilinogen]]
## [[Hemoglobin]]anemia, [[methemalbumin]]emia, [[hemoglobinuria]] and [[hemosiderinuria]] (where there is significant intravascular hemolysis).
# Bone marrow compensatory reaction:
## Erythroid [[hyperplasia]] with accelerated production of red cells, reflected by [[reticulocytosis]], and slight [[macrocytosis]] in peripheral blood
## Expansion of bone marrow in infants and children with severe chronic hemolysis - changes in bone configuration visible on X-ray
# The balance between red cell destruction and marrow compensation determines the severity of anemias.

==Signs and symptoms==
In general, signs of anemia ([[pallor]], fatigue, shortness of breath, and potential for [[heart failure]]) are present. In small children, [[failure to thrive]] may occur in any form of anemia. Certain aspects of the medical history can suggest a cause for hemolysis, such as [[medication|drugs]], consumption of [[fava bean]]s causing a [[glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PD]] response, the presence of [[heart valve prosthesis|prosthetic heart valve]], or other medical illness.

Chronic hemolysis leads to an increased excretion of bilirubin into the [[biliary tract]], which in turn may lead to gallstones. The continuous release of free [[hemoglobin]] has been linked with the development of pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure over the [[pulmonary artery]]); this, in turn, leads to episodes of [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting), [[chest pain]], and progressive breathlessness. Pulmonary hypertension eventually causes right ventricular heart failure, the symptoms of which are [[peripheral edema]] (fluid accumulation in the skin of the legs) and [[ascites]] (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity).

They may be classified according to the means of hemolysis, being either intrinsic in cases where the cause is related to the [[red blood cell]] (RBC) itself, or extrinsic in cases where factors external to the RBC dominate.<ref>Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 2009  By Stephen J. McPhee, Maxine A. Papadakis page 436  http://books.google.com/books?id=zQlH4mXSziYC&pg=PT454&dq=hemoglobin+hemosiderin+hemolysis+bilirubin&ei=Z2P_SuzwA6D2ygT9vOz3Dg#v=onepage&q=hemoglobin%20hemosiderin%20hemolysis%20bilirubin&f=false</ref> Intrinsic effects may include problems with RBC proteins or oxidative stress handling, whereas external factors include immune attack and microvascular angiopathies (RBCs are mechanically damaged in circulation).

===Intrinsic causes===
Hereditary (inherited) hemolytic anemia can be due to : 
* Defects of red blood cell membrane production (as in [[hereditary spherocytosis]] and [[hereditary elliptocytosis]])

* Defects in hemoglobin production (as in [[thalassemia]], [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[congenital dyserythropoietic anemia]])

* Defective red cell metabolism (as in [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] and [[pyruvate kinase deficiency]])

===Extrinsic causes===
Acquired hemolytic anemia may be caused by immune-mediated causes, drugs and other miscellaneous causes.
* Immune-mediated causes could include transient factors as in ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' infection ([[cold agglutinin disease]]) or permanent factors as in [[autoimmune disease]]s like [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] (itself more common in diseases such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[hodgkin disease]] and [[B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia|chronic lymphocytic leukemia]])
* [[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] (PNH), sometimes referred to as Marchiafava-Micheli syndrome, is a rare, acquired, potentially life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by complement-induced intravascular hemolytic anemia
* Any of the causes of [[hypersplenism]] (increased activity of the spleen) such as [[portal hypertension]]
* Acquired hemolytic anemia is also encountered in [[burn]]s and as a result of certain infections.
* [[Lead poisoning]] resulting from the environment causes non-immune hemolytic anemia.
*[[Running|Runners]] can suffer hemolytic anemia due to "[[Mechanical hemolytic anemia|footstrike hemolysis]]", owing to the destruction of red blood cells in feet at foot impact.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Telford RD, Sly GJ, Hahn AG, Cunningham RB, Bryant C, Smith JA |title=Footstrike is the major cause of hemolysis during running |journal=J.

* [[March hemoglobinuria]]

==Pathophysiology==
In a healthy person, a red blood cell survives 90 to 120 days in the circulation, so about 1% of human red blood cells break down each day. The [[spleen]] (part of the [[reticulo-endothelial system]]) is the main organ that removes old and damaged RBCs from the circulation. In healthy individuals, the breakdown and removal of RBCs from the circulation is matched by the production of new RBCs in the [[bone marrow]].

In conditions where the rate of RBC breakdown is increased, the body initially compensates by producing more RBCs; however, breakdown of RBCs can exceed the rate that the body can make RBCs, and so anemia can develop. [[Bilirubin]], a breakdown product of hemoglobin, can accumulate in the blood, causing [[jaundice]], and be excreted in the urine causing the urine to become a dark brown color.

In general, hemolytic anemia occurs as a modification of the RBC life cycle. That is, instead of being collected at the end of its useful life and disposed of normally, the RBC disintegrates in a manner allowing free iron-containing molecules to reach the blood. It is perhaps then helpful to understand the physiology of the RBC and things that can go wrong to cause it to "die" prematurely. With their complete lack of mitochondria, RBCs rely on glycolysis for the materials needed to reduce oxidative damage. Any limitations of glycolysis can result in more susceptibility to oxidative damage and a short or abnormal lifecycle. If the cell is unable to signal to the reticuloendothelial phagocytes by externalizing phosphatidylserine, it is likely to lyse through uncontrolled means.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kolb S, Vranckx R, Huisse MG, Michel JB, Meilhac O |title=The phosphatidylserine receptor mediates phagocytosis by vascular smooth muscle cells |journal=The Journal of Pathology |volume=212 |issue=3 |pages=249–59 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17534843 |doi=10.1002/path.2190}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bosman GJ, Willekens FL, Werre JM |title=Erythrocyte aging: a more than superficial resemblance to apoptosis? |journal=Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry |volume=16 |issue=1–3 |pages=1–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16121027 |doi=10.1159/000087725}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bratosin D, Mazurier J, Tissier JP, ''et al.'' |title=Cellular and molecular mechanisms of senescent erythrocyte phagocytosis by macrophages.

The distinguishing feature of intravascular hemolysis is the release of RBC contents into the blood stream. The metabolism and elimination of these products, largely iron-containing compounds capable of doing damage through [[Fenton reaction]]s, <!--- ( unrelated to wikipedia [[Fenton Communications]]) ---> is an important part of the condition. Several reference texts exist on the elimination pathways, for example.<ref name=hillman1>Hematology in clinical practice: a guide to diagnosis and management By Robert S. Hillman, Kenneth A.

==Diagnosis==
{{expand section|date=March 2010}}

*[[Peripheral blood smear]] microscopy:
**fragments of the red blood cells ("[[schistocyte]]s") can be present
**some red blood cells may appear smaller and rounder than usual ([[spherocyte]]s)
**[[Reticulocyte]]s are present in elevated numbers. This may be overlooked if a special [[staining (biology)|stain]] is not used.
**[[Bite cell]]s may be present due to [[Heinz body]] removal by the spleen in [[G6PD deficiency]]. 
*The level of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood is elevated.  This may lead to jaundice.
*The level of [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) in the blood is elevated
*Haptoglobin levels are decreased
*If the direct [[Coombs test]] is positive, hemolysis is caused by an immune process (e.g. [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]).
*[[Hemosiderin]] in the urine indicates chronic intravascular hemolysis.  There is also urobilinogen in the urine.
* Haemaglobinuria in the morning is suggestive of [[paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria]].

==Treatment==
{{expand section|date=March 2010}}

Definitive therapy depends on the cause:
*Symptomatic treatment can be given by [[blood transfusion]], if there is marked anemia.
*In severe immune-related hemolytic anemia, [[steroid]] therapy is sometimes necessary.
*Sometimes [[splenectomy]] can be helpful where extravascular hemolysis is predominant (i.e. most of the red blood cells are being removed by the spleen).

==Veterinary cases==
Hemolytic anemia may affect non human species as well. It has been found in a number of animal species to result from specific triggers.<ref>Mary Anna Thrall, Dale C. Baker, E. Duane Lassen, ''Veterinary hematology and clinical chemistry'', ISBN 0-7817-6850-0, 2004.</ref>

Some notable cases include hemolytic anemia found in [[black rhino]]s kept in captivity, with the disease affecting 20% of the animals in one instance.<ref>Edward F.
