The '''anterior interosseous artery''' ('''volar interosseous artery''') is an [[artery]] in the forearm. It is a branch of the [[common interosseous artery]].

==Course==
It passes down the [[forearm]] on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Arms|palmar]] surface of the [[interosseous membrane]]. 

It is accompanied by the [[Palmar branch of the median nerve|palmar interosseous branch of the]] [[median nerve]], and overlapped by the contiguous margins of the [[flexor digitorum profundus]] and [[flexor pollicis longus]] muscles, giving off in this situation muscular branches, and the nutrient arteries of the [[radius]] and [[ulna]]. 

At the upper border of the [[pronator quadratus muscle]] it pierces the interosseous membrane and reaches the back of the forearm, where it anastomoses with the [[dorsal interosseous artery]]. 

It then descends, in company with the terminal portion of the [[dorsal interosseous nerve]], to the back of the wrist to join the [[dorsal carpal network]]. 

The anterior interosseous artery gives off a slender branch, the [[arteria mediana]], which accompanies the [[median nerve]], and gives offsets to its substance; this artery is sometimes much enlarged, and runs with the nerve into the palm of the hand. 

Before it pierces the interosseous membrane the anterior interosseous sends a branch downward behind the [[pronator quadratus muscle]] to join the [[palmar carpal network]].
