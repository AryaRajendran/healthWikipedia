==Causes==
A variety of conditions can result in epileptogenesis, including [[neurodegenerative disease]]s, [[traumatic brain injury]], [[stroke]], [[brain tumor]], infections of the [[central nervous system]], and [[status epilepticus]] (a prolonged seizure or a series of seizures occurring in quick succession).<ref name="Herman06"/>

==Latent period==
After a brain injury occurs, there is frequently a "silent" or "latent period" lasting months or years in which seizures do not occur;<ref name="Aroniadou08"/> Canadian neurosurgeon [[Wilder Penfield]] called this time between injury and seizure "a silent period of strange ripening".<ref>

</ref>  It is this process in which hyperexcitable neural networks form that is referred to as epileptogenesis, and it is during this latent period that symptoms of epilepsy first occur.<ref name="Aroniadou08"/>  If researchers come to better understand epileptogenesis, the latent period may provide a chance for healthcare providers to interfere with the development of epilepsy or reduce its severity.<ref name="Aroniadou08"/>

==Pathophysiology==

Changes that occur during epileptogenesis are poorly understood but are thought to include cell death, axonal sprouting, reorganization of neural networks, alterations in the release of neurotransmitters, and [[neurogenesis]].<ref name="Herman06"/>  These changes cause neurons to become hyperexcitable and can lead to spontaneous seizures.<ref name="Herman06"/>

Brain regions that are highly sensitive to insults and can cause epileptogenesis include [[temporal lobe]] structures such as the [[hippocampus]], the [[amygdala]], and the [[piriform cortex]].<ref name="Aroniadou08"/>

===Neural reorganization===
In addition to chemical processes, the physical structure of neurons in the brain may be altered. 
In [[acquired epilepsy]] in both humans and animal models, [[pyramidal neuron]]s are lost, and new [[synapse]]s are formed.<ref name="Armijo02"/>

[[Hyperexcitability]], a characteristic feature of epileptogenesis in which the likelihood that [[neural network]]s will be activated is increased, may be due to loss of inhibitory neurons that would normally balance out the excitability of other neurons, such as [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]]ergic [[interneuron]]s.<ref name="Armijo02"/> Neuronal circuits that are epileptic are known for being hyperexcitable and for lacking the normal balance of glutamatergic neurons (those that usually increase excitation) and GABAergic ones (those that decrease it).<ref name="Aroniadou08"/> In addition, the levels of GABA and the sensitivity of [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]] to the neurotransmitter may decrease, resulting in less inhibition.<ref name="Armijo02"/> 

Another proposed mechanism for epileptogenesis in TBI is that damage to [[white matter]] causes hyperexcitability by effectively undercutting the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref name="Dodson04">

===Receptor activation===
It is believed that activation of [[biochemical receptor]]s on the surfaces of neurons is involved in epileptogenesis; these include the TrkB [[neurotrophin]] receptor and both [[ionotropic glutamate receptor]]s and [[metabotropic glutamate receptor]]s (those that are directly linked to an [[ion channel]] and those that are not, respectively).<ref name="McNamara06"/>  Each of these types of receptor may, when activated, cause an increase in the concentration of [[calcium]] [[ion]]s (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) within the area of the cell on which the receptors are located, and this Ca<sup>2+</sup> can activate enzymes such as [[Src (gene)|Src]] and [[FYN|Fyn]] that may lead to epileptogenesis.<ref name="McNamara06"/>

===Glutamate===
Excessive release of the neurotransmitter [[glutamate]] is widely recognized as an important part of epileptogenesis early after a [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]], including in humans.<ref name="Aroniadou08"/>  Excessive release of glutamate results in [[excitotoxicity]], in which neurons are excessively [[depolarization|depolarized]], intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations increase sharply, and cellular damage or death results.<ref name="Aroniadou08"/>  Excessive glutamatergic activity is also a feature of neuronal circuits after epilepsy has developed, but glutamate does not appear to play an important role in epileptogenesis during the latent period.<ref name="Aroniadou08"/>  Another factor in hyperexcitability may include a decrease in the [[concentration]] of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ''outside'' cells (i.e. in the [[extracellular space]]) and a decrease in the activity of [[ATPase]] in [[glial cell]]s.<ref name="Armijo02"/>

===Blood===
Blood that spills into brain tissue (as may occur in traumatic brain injury or stroke) may play a role in the damage that results in epilepsy, perhaps by depositing [[hemosiderin]] or [[iron]] into the tissue.<ref name="Dodson04"/>  Iron from [[hemoglobin]], a molecule in red blood cells, can lead to the formation of [[free radical]]s that damage [[cell membrane]]s; this process has been linked to epileptogenesis.<ref name="Beghi04">
