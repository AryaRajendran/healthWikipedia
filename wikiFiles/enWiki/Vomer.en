The '''vomer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|oʊ|m|ər}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vomer Entry "vomer"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>) is one of the unpaired facial [[bone]]s of the [[human skull|skull]]. It is located in the midsagittal line, and articulates with the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], the [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]], the left and right [[palatine bone|palatine]] bones, and the left and right [[maxillary bone|maxillary]] bones.

== Biology ==
The [[vomeronasal organ]], also called Jacobson's organ, is a [[chemoreceptor]] organ named for its closeness to the vomer and [[nasal bone]]s, and is particularly developed in animals such as cats (who adopt a characteristic pose called the ''[[Flehmen reaction]]'' or ''flehming'' when making use of it), and is thought to have to do with the perception of certain [[pheromone]]s.

It has been suggested that by alternately thrusting with the tongue against the roof of the mouth while pressing with the fingers between the eyebrows, one can move the vomer, and if repeated for about 20 seconds, the [[paranasal sinuses|sinuses]] will discharge, thus rapidly clearing a stuffy head without the use of drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.menshealth.com/mhlists/diy_health_remedies/Clear_your_stuffed_nose.php |title= Clear Your Stuffed Nose |author= Kate Dailey |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref>

==Anatomical details==
The vomer is situated in the median plane, but its anterior portion is frequently bent to one or other side. 

It is thin, somewhat quadrilateral in shape, and forms the hinder and lower part of the nasal septum; it has two surfaces and four borders. 

The surfaces are marked by small furrows for [[blood vessel]]s, and on each is the [[nasopalatine groove]], which runs obliquely downward and forward, and lodges the nasopalatine nerve and vessels. 

=== Borders ===
The ''superior border'', the thickest, presents a deep furrow, bounded on either side by a horizontal projecting ala of bone; the furrow receives the [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]], while the margins of the alæ articulate with the vaginal processes of the [[medial pterygoid plate]]s of the sphenoid behind, and with the sphenoidal processes of the palatine bones in front. 

The ''inferior border'' articulates with the crest formed by the maxillæ and [[palatine bone]]s. 

The ''anterior border'' is the longest and slopes downward and forward. Its upper half is fused with the [[perpendicular plate of ethmoid bone|perpendicular plate]] of the [[ethmoid]]; its lower half is grooved for the inferior margin of the [[septal cartilage of the nose]]. 

The ''posterior border'' is free, concave, and separates the [[choana]]e. It is thick and bifid above, thin below.

==  Articulations ==
The vomer articulates with six bones: 
* two of the cranium, the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] and [[ethmoid bone|ethmoid]].
* four of the face, the two [[maxilla|maxillae]]; and the two [[palatine bone]]s. 

It also articulates with the [[nasal septum|septal]] [[cartilage]] of the [[human nose|nose]].

== In other animals ==

In [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the vomers are flattened, paired, bones forming the anterior part of the roof of the mouth, just behind the [[premaxilla]]ry bones. In many species, they have teeth, supplementing those in the jaw proper; in some extinct species the teeth on the vomers were actually larger than the primary set. In [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s, the vomers become narrower, due to the presence of the enlarged [[choana]]e (the inner part of the nostrils) on either side, and they may extend further back in the jaw. They are typically small in [[bird]]s, where they form the upper hind part of the beak, again being located between the choanae.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 220–243|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

In [[mammal]]s, the vomers have become narrower still, and are fused into a single, vertically oriented bone. The development of the [[hard palate]] beneath the vomer means that the bone is now located in a nasal chamber, separate from the mouth.<ref name=VB/>
