'''Third-degree AV block''', also known as '''complete heart block''', is a medical condition in which the impulse generated in the [[SA node]] in the [[atrium (heart)|atrium]] does not propagate to the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]].<ref name="urlLesson VI - ECG Conduction Abnormalities">{{cite web |url=http://ecg.utah.edu/lesson/6#Complete |title=ECG Conduction Abnormalities |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref>

Because the impulse is blocked, an accessory pacemaker in the lower chambers will typically activate the ventricles.  This is known as an ''escape rhythm''. Since this accessory pacemaker also activates independently of the impulse generated at the SA node, two independent rhythms can be noted on the [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG).  

* The P waves with a regular P to P interval represents the first rhythm.
* The [[QRS complex]]es with a regular R to R interval represent the second rhythm. The [[PR interval]] will be variable, as the hallmark of complete heart block is no apparent relationship between P waves and QRS complexes.

One of the pathognomonic characteristic of this block is the absolute absence of the opportunity for atrial impulses to enter and capture the ventricles (unlike AV dissociation with functional block) due to the organic nature of block (e.g., [[fibrosis]], [[calcification]], or infiltration of the node). In the presence of complete heart block, [[fusion beat|fusion]] or [[capture beat]]s will never be seen.<ref>Exeer, Nader Ahmad, Cardiovascular diseases, Conduction disturbances 2010, Aliabad University Hospital, Kabul Medical University, Kabul, Afghanistan.{{vn|date=April 2013}}</ref>
Patients with third-degree AV block typically experience [[bradycardia]] (an abnormally low measured heart rate), [[hypotension]], and at times, [[hemodynamic]] instability.  In some cases, exercising may be difficult, as the heart cannot react quickly enough to sudden changes in demand or sustain the higher heart rates required for prolonged activity.

==Cause==
Many conditions can cause third-degree heart block, but the most common cause is [[coronary ischemia]].  Progressive degeneration of the electrical conduction system of the heart can lead to third-degree heart block.  This may be preceded by [[first-degree AV block]], [[second-degree AV block]], [[bundle branch block]], or [[bifascicular block]]. In addition, acute myocardial infarction may present with third-degree AV block.

An ''[[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Superior_and_inferior|inferior]] wall [[myocardial infarction]]'' may cause damage to the AV node, causing third-degree heart block.  In this case, the damage is usually transitory.  Studies have shown that third-degree heart block in the setting of an inferior wall myocardial infarction typically resolves within 2 weeks.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The escape rhythm typically originates in the AV junction, producing a narrow complex escape rhythm.

An ''[[anterior (anatomy)|anterior]] wall myocardial infarction'' may damage the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal_and_distal|distal]] conduction system of the heart, causing third-degree heart block.  This is typically extensive, permanent damage to the conduction system, necessitating a permanent [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] to be placed. The escape rhythm typically originates in the ventricles, producing a wide complex escape rhythm.

Third-degree heart block may also be [[congenital]] and has been linked to the presence of [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]] in the mother. It is thought that maternal [[antibodies]] may cross the [[placenta]] and attack the heart tissue during [[gestation]]. The cause of congenital third-degree heart block in many patients is unknown. Studies suggest that the prevalence of congenital third-degree heart block is between 1 in 15,000 and 1 in 22,000 live births.

Lastly, [[Lyme disease]] can also result in third-degree heart block.

==Treatment==
Third-degree AV block can be treated by use of a dual-chamber [[artificial pacemaker]].  This type of device typically listens for a pulse from the SA node and sends a pulse to the AV node at an appropriate interval, essentially completing the connection between the two nodes.  Pacemakers in this role are usually programmed to enforce a minimum heart rate and to record instances of [[atrial flutter]] and [[atrial fibrillation]], two common secondary conditions that can accompany third-degree AV block.

Treatment may also include medicines to control blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, as well as lifestyle and dietary changes to reduce risk factors associated with [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]].

Treatment in emergency situations ultimately involves electrical pacing.  However the American Heart Association states that giving a trial of atropine while waiting for the pacer to be set up is acceptable. [[Atropine]] is effective for treating early heart blocks (1st degree and 2nd degree type 1) but generally thought to have no effect on 3rd degree blocks. 

The 2005 Joint European Resuscitation and Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines state that atropine is the first line treatment especially if there were any adverse signs, namely: 1) heart rate < 40 bpm, 2) systolic blood pressure < 100&nbsp;mm Hg, 3) signs of heart failure, and 4) ventricular arrhythmias requiring suppression. If these fail to respond to atropine or there is a potential risk of asystole, transvenous pacing is indicated. The risk factors for asystole include 1) previous asystole, 2) complete heart block with wide complexes, and 3) ventricular pause for > 3 seconds. [[Second-degree_AV_block#Type_2_.28Mobitz_II.2FHay.29|Mobitz Type 2 AV block]] is another indication for pacing.
