<!--Para1: Definition, symptoms and diagnosis-->
'''Schizophrenia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|k|ɪ|t|s|ɵ|ˈ|f|r|ɛ|n|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|k|ɪ|t|s|ɵ|ˈ|f|r|iː|n|i|ə}}) is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by a breakdown of [[thought]] processes and by a deficit of typical [[emotion]]al responses.<ref>"Schizophrenia" Concise Medical Dictionary. [[Oxford University Press]], 2010. Oxford Reference Online. [http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Library/AboutTheLibrary.htm Maastricht University Library]. 29 June 2010 [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t60.e9060 prepaid subscription only]</ref> Common symptoms include [[auditory hallucination]]s, [[paranoia|paranoid]] or bizarre [[delusion]]s, or [[thought disorder|disorganized speech and thinking]], and it is accompanied by significant social or occupational dysfunction. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime [[prevalence]] of about 0.3–0.7%.<ref name=Lancet09/> Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient's reported experiences.

<!--Para2:Cause-->
[[Genetics]], early environment, [[neurobiology]], and [[Psychology|psychological]] and social processes appear to be important contributory factors; some recreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms. Current research is focused on the role of neurobiology, although no single isolated organic cause has been found. The many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes. Despite the [[etymology]] of the term from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ''skhizein'' (''σχίζειν'', "to split") and ''phrēn, phren-'' (''φρήν, φρεν-''; "mind"), schizophrenia does not imply a "split personality", or "multiple personality disorder" (which is known these days as [[dissociative identity disorder]])—a condition with which it is often confused in public perception.<ref name=BMJ07/> Rather, the term means a "splitting of mental functions", because of the symptomatic presentation of the illness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baucum|first=Don|title=Psychology|year=2006|publisher=Barron's|location=Hauppauge, N.Y.|isbn=9780764134210|pages=182|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=iCVSdYdA36EC&pg=PA182|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref>

<!--Para3: Treatment-->
The mainstay of treatment is [[antipsychotic]] medication, which primarily suppresses [[dopamine]] (and sometimes [[serotonin]]) [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] activity. [[Psychotherapy]] and vocational and social rehabilitation are also important in treatment. In more serious cases—where there is risk to self and others—[[emergency psychiatry|involuntary hospitalization]] may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.<ref name="BeckerKilian2006">{{vcite journal |author=Becker T, Kilian R|year=2006 |title=Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Supplement |volume=113 |pages=9–16 |pmid=16445476 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x |issue=429}}</ref>

<!--Para4: Impairment/chronicity and Comorbidity-->
The disorder is thought mainly to affect [[cognition]], but it also usually contributes to chronic problems with behavior and emotion. People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional ([[Comorbidity|comorbid]]) conditions, including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s; the lifetime occurrence of [[substance use disorder]] is almost 50%.<ref name="Sim_et_al_2006">{{vcite journal |author=Buckley PF, Miller BJ, Lehrer DS, Castle DJ |title=Psychiatric comorbidities and schizophrenia |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=383–402 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19011234 |pmc=2659306 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbn135}}</ref> Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty, and homelessness are common. The average [[life expectancy]] of people with the disorder is 12 to 15&nbsp;years less than those without, the result of increased physical health problems and a higher [[suicide]] rate (about 5%).<ref name=Lancet09/><ref name=jop>http://jop.sagepub.com/content/24/4_suppl/81.full.pdf+html</ref>

==Symptoms==
A person diagnosed with schizophrenia may experience [[hallucination]]s (most reported are [[Auditory hallucination|hearing voices]]), [[delusion]]s (often bizarre or [[Persecutory delusions|persecutory]] in nature), and [[Thought disorder|disorganized thinking and speech]]. The latter may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to incoherence known as [[Schizophasia|word salad]] in severe cases. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.<ref name=CarsonNursing>Carson VB (2000).

===Schneiderian classification===
In the early 20th century, the psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] listed the forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called ''first-rank symptoms'' or [[Kurt Schneider#First-rank symptoms|Schneider's first-rank symptoms]]. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force; the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind; the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people; and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hallucinated voices.<ref name="SchneiderClinicalPsychopathology">{{vcite book|last1=Schneider |first1=K |authorlink1=Kurt Schneider |title=Clinical Psychopathology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ofzOAAAAMAAJ |edition=5 |year=1959 |publisher=Grune & Stratton |location=New York }}</ref> Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems.<ref name="pmid17562695">{{vcite journal |author=Nordgaard J, Arnfred SM, Handest P, Parnas J |title=The diagnostic status of first-rank symptoms |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=137–54 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17562695 |pmc=2632385 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm044}}</ref>

===Positive and negative symptoms===
Schizophrenia is often described in terms of [[Symptom#Positive and negative symptoms|positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms]].<ref name="Sims_2002">{{vcite book |author=Sims A |title=Symptoms in the mind: an introduction to descriptive psychopathology |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |isbn=0-7020-2627-1 }}</ref> Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and [[tactile]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]], [[visual]], [[olfactory]] and [[gustatory]] hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of [[psychosis]].<ref>Kneisl C. and Trigoboff E.(2009). Contemporary Psychiatric- Mental Health Nursing. 2nd edition. London: Pearson Prentice Ltd. p. 371</ref> Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.<ref name=DSM299/> Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.<ref name=DSM299>American Psychiatric Association. Task Force on DSM-IV. (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR. American Psychiatric Pub. ISBN 978-0-89042-025-6. p. 299</ref>

Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, and respond less well to medication.<ref name=CarsonNursing/> They commonly include flat or [[blunted affect]] and emotion, poverty of speech ([[alogia]]), inability to experience pleasure ([[anhedonia]]), lack of desire to form relationships ([[asociality]]), and lack of motivation ([[avolition]]). Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life, functional disability, and the burden on others than do positive symptoms.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Velligan DI and Alphs LD|title=Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia: The Importance of Identification and Treatment |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=25 |issue=3 |date=March 1, 2008 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/schizophrenia/article/10168/1147581}}</ref> People with prominent negative symptoms often have a history of poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to medication is often limited.<ref name=CarsonNursing/><ref name=AFP10/>

Assuming a hereditary basis, one question from [[evolutionary psychology]] is why genes that increase the likelihood of psychosis evolved, assuming the condition would have been [[maladaptive]] from an evolutionary point of view.

Particular attention has been paid to the function of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that [[phenothiazine]] drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.<ref name="Laruelle_et_al_1996">{{vcite journal |author=Laruelle M, Abi-Dargham A, van Dyck CH, ''et al.'' |title=Single photon emission computerized tomography imaging of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in drug-free schizophrenic subjects |journal=Proc.

The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication ([[atypical antipsychotic]] medication) can be just as effective as older medication ([[typical antipsychotic]] medication), but also affects [[serotonin]] function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect.<ref name="JonesPilowsky2002">{{vcite journal |author=Jones HM, Pilowsky LS |year=2002 |title=Dopamine and antipsychotic drug action revisited |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=181 |pages=271–275 |pmid=12356650 |doi=10.1192/bjp.181.4.271}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Diagnosis of schizophrenia}}
[[File:John Forbes Nash, Jr. by Peter Badge.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]], a U.S. [[mathematician]] and joint winner of the 1994 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize for Economics]], who had schizophrenia. His life has been the subject of the 2001 [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]''.]]

Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', version DSM-IV-TR, or the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], the ICD-10.<ref name=Lancet09/> These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a [[mental health professional]]. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity before a diagnosis is made.<ref name=BMJ07/> As of 2009 there is no objective test.<ref name=Lancet09/>

===Criteria===
The ICD-10 criteria are typically used in European countries, while the DSM-IV-TR criteria are used in the United States and to varying degrees around the world, and are prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian first-rank symptoms. In practice, agreement between the two systems is high.<ref name="Jakobsen_et_al_2005">{{vcite journal |author=Jakobsen KD, Frederiksen JN, Hansen T, ''et al.'' |year=2005 |title=Reliability of clinical ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnoses |journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 | issue=3 |pages=209–12 |pmid=16195122 | doi = 10.1080/08039480510027698}}</ref>

According to the revised fourth edition of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (DSM-IV-TR), to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, three diagnostic criteria must be met:<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" />
# Characteristic symptoms: Two or more of the following, each present for much of the time during a one-month period (or less, if symptoms remitted with treatment).
#* Delusions
#* Hallucinations
#* Disorganized speech, which is a manifestation of [[thought disorder|formal thought disorder]]
#* Grossly disorganized behavior (e.g. dressing inappropriately, crying frequently) or catatonic behavior
#* Negative symptoms: Blunted affect (lack or decline in emotional response), alogia (lack or decline in speech), or avolition (lack or decline in motivation)
#:If the delusions are judged to be bizarre, or hallucinations consist of hearing one voice participating in a running commentary of the patient's actions or of hearing two or more voices conversing with each other, only that symptom is required above. The speech disorganization criterion is only met if it is severe enough to substantially impair communication.
# Social or occupational dysfunction: For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset.
# Significant duration: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months. This six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less, if symptoms remitted with treatment).

If signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of [[schizophreniform disorder]] is applied.<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">{{vcite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=2000 |chapter=Schizophrenia |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/schiz.htm |isbn=0-89042-024-6 |accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as [[brief psychotic disorder]], and various conditions may be classed as [[psychotic disorder not otherwise specified]]. Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of [[mood disorder]] are substantially present (although [[schizoaffective disorder]] could be diagnosed), or if symptoms of [[pervasive developmental disorder]] are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present, or if the symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, such as abuse of a drug or medication.

===Subtypes===
The DSM-IV-TR contains five sub-classifications of schizophrenia, although the developers of [[DSM-5]] are recommending they be dropped from the new classification:<ref>[[American Psychiatric Association]] DSM-5 Work Groups (2010) [http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/SchizophreniaandOtherPsychoticDisorders.aspx Proposed Revisions – Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders]. Retrieved 17 February 2010.</ref><ref name=WHOICD/>
* Paranoid type: Delusions or auditory hallucinations are present, but thought disorder, disorganized behavior, or affective flattening are not. Delusions are persecutory and/or grandiose, but in addition to these, other themes such as jealousy, religiosity, or [[somatization]] may also be present. (DSM code 295.3/ICD code F20.0)
* [[Disorganized schizophrenia|Disorganized type]]: Named ''hebephrenic schizophrenia'' in the ICD. Where thought disorder and flat affect are present together. (DSM code 295.1/ICD code F20.1)
* [[Catatonia|Catatonic type]]: The subject may be almost immobile or exhibit agitated, purposeless movement. Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and [[waxy flexibility]]. (DSM code 295.2/ICD code F20.2)
* Undifferentiated type: Psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met. (DSM code 295.9/ICD code F20.3)
* Residual type: Where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only. (DSM code 295.6/ICD code F20.5)

The ICD-10 defines two additional subtypes:<ref name=WHOICD>{{vcite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders |format=pdf |work=World Health Organization |page=26}}</ref>
* Post-schizophrenic depression: A depressive episode arising in the aftermath of a schizophrenic illness where some low-level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present. (ICD code F20.4)
* [[Simple-type schizophrenia|Simple schizophrenia]]: Insidious and progressive development of prominent negative symptoms with no history of psychotic episodes. (ICD code F20.6)

===Differential===
{{see also|Dual diagnosis}}
Psychotic symptoms may be present in several other mental disorders, including [[bipolar disorder]],<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Pope HG |year=1983 |title=Distinguishing bipolar disorder from schizophrenia in clinical practice: guidelines and case reports |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |volume=34 |pages=322–28 |accessdate= 2008-02-24}}</ref> [[borderline personality disorder]],<ref>{{vcite journal |author=McGlashan TH |title=Testing DSM-III symptom criteria for schizotypal and borderline personality disorders |journal=[[Archives of General Psychiatry]] |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |year=1987 |month=February |pmid=3813809}}</ref> drug intoxication and [[Substance-induced psychosis|drug-induced psychosis]]. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in [[delusional disorder]], and social withdrawal in [[social anxiety disorder]], [[avoidant personality disorder]] and [[schizotypal personality disorder]]. Schizophrenia is comorbid with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by pure chance, although it can be difficult to distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Bottas A |title=Comorbidity: Schizophrenia With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder  |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=April 15, 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1402540 }}</ref> A small number of people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe protracted withdrawal syndrome which can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.<ref name="gabbards">{{Cite book | last1 = Gabbard | first1 = Glen O. | title = Gabbard's Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders, Fourth Edition (Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders) | date = 15 May 2007 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | url=http://books.google.com/?id=-T2aEqfwLW4C&pg=PA209 | isbn = 1-58562-216-8 | pages = 209–211 }}</ref>

A more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms,<ref name="DSM-IV-TR" /> such as [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic disturbance]], [[systemic infection]], [[syphilis]], [[HIV]] infection, [[epilepsy]], and brain lesions. It may be necessary to rule out a [[delirium]], which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating [[level of consciousness]], and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication or possible [[adverse effects]] from [[antipsychotic medication]].

In the early 1970s, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were the subject of a number of controversies which eventually led to the [[operational definition|operational criteria]] used today.

The term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a "split personality". Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities, schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct multiple personalities. The confusion arises in part due to the literal interpretation of Bleuler's term schizophrenia (Bleuler originally associated Schizophrenia with dissociation and included split personality in his category of Schizophrenia<ref>Stotz-Ingenlath G: Epistemological aspects of Eugen Bleuler’s conception of schizophrenia in 1911.

Individuals with severe mental illness including schizophrenia are at a significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Maniglio R |title=Severe mental illness and criminal victimization: a systematic review |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=180–91 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19016668 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2008.01300.x }}</ref> On the other hand, schizophrenia has sometimes been associated with a higher rate of violent acts, although this is primarily due to higher rates of [[Substance abuse|drug use]].<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Fazel S, Gulati G, Linsell L, Geddes JR, Grann M |title=Schizophrenia and violence: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=e1000120 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19668362 |pmc=2718581 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000120 }}</ref> Rates of [[homicide]] linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Large M, Smith G, Nielssen O |title=The relationship between the rate of homicide by those with schizophrenia and the overall homicide rate: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Schizophr.

Media coverage relating to schizophrenia tends to revolve around rare but unusual acts of violence. Furthermore, in a large, representative sample from a 1999 study, 12.8% of Americans believed that individuals with schizophrenia were "very likely" to do something violent against others, and 48.1% said that they were "somewhat likely" to. Over 74% said that people with schizophrenia were either "not very able" or "not able at all" to make decisions concerning their treatment, and 70.2% said the same of money management decisions.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Pescosolido BA, Monahan J, Link BG, Stueve A, Kikuzawa S |title=The public's view of the competence, dangerousness, and need for legal coercion of persons with mental health problems |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=89 |issue=9 |pages=1339–45 |year=1999|month=September |pmid=10474550 |pmc=1508769 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1339}}</ref> The perception of individuals with psychosis as violent has more than doubled in prevalence since the 1950s, according to one meta-analysis.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Phelan JC, Link BG, Stueve A, Pescosolido BA|year=2000 |month=June |title=Public Conceptions of Mental Illness in 1950 and 1996: What Is Mental Illness and Is It to be Feared? |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=188–207 |doi=10.2307/2676305}}</ref>
