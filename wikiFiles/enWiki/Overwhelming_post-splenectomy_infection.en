An '''overwhelming post-splenectomy infection''' ('''OPSI''') is a rare but rapidly fatal [[infection]] occurring in individuals following removal of the [[spleen]]. The infections are typically characterized by either [[meningitis]] or [[sepsis]], and are caused by [[bacterial capsule|encapsulated organisms]] including ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''.<ref name="pmid11253134">{{cite journal |author=Waghorn DJ |title=Overwhelming infection in asplenic patients: current best practice preventive measures are not being followed |journal=Journal of Clinical Pathology |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=214–8 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11253134 |pmc=1731383 |doi= 10.1136/jcp.54.3.214|url=http://jcp.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11253134}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
The [[spleen]] contains many [[macrophage]]s (part of the [[reticuloendothelial system]]), which are immune cells that [[phagocytose]] (eat) and destroy [[bacteria]].  In particular, these macrophages are activated when bacteria are bound by [[IgG]] [[antibodies]] (IgG1 or IgG3) or the [[Complement system|complement]] component C3b.  These types of antibodies and complements are immune substances called [[opsonizer]]s, molecules that bind to the surface of bacteria to facilitate [[phagocytosis]].  

When the spleen is no longer present ([[asplenia]]), IgG and C3b are still bound to bacteria, but they cannot be removed from the [[blood]] circulation due to the loss of the splenic macrophages.  Hence the bacteria are free to cause [[infection]].

Patients without spleens often need [[immunization]]s against [[pathogen]]s that normally require [[opsonization]] and phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen.  These include common human pathogens with [[bacterial capsules]] (''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], [[Salmonella typhi]], [[Neisseria meningitidis]], [[E. coli]], [[Hemophilus influenzae]], [[Streptococcus agalactiae]], [[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'').  Capsules made of [[polysaccharide]]s (sugars) are an evolutionary development by bacteria to evade phagocytosis by macrophages alone, since only [[protein]]s are directly recognized by macrophages in phagocytosis.  So [[humoral]] immunity in forms of IgG and complement proteins is the [[human immune system]]'s response against bacterial capsules.
