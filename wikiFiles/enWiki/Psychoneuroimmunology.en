'''Psychoneuroimmunology''' ('''PNI''') is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}</ref> PNI takes an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[physiology]], [[genetics]],[[pharmacology]], [[molecular biology]], [[psychiatry]], [[behavioral medicine]], [[infectious diseases]], [[endocrinology]], and [[rheumatology]].

The main interests of PNI are the interactions between the [[central nervous system|nervous]] and [[immune]] systems and the relationships between mental processes and [[health]]. PNI studies, among other things, the [[physiology|physiological]] functioning of the neuroimmune system in health and disease; disorders of the neuroimmune system ([[autoimmune diseases]]; [[hypersensitivity|hypersensitivities]]; [[immune deficiency]]); and the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the neuroimmune system [[in vitro]], [[in situ]], and [[in vivo]].

PNI may also be referred to as psychoendoneuroimmunology (PENI).

==History==
Interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine.

[[Claude Bernard]], a French physiologist of the [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]], founded the concept [[milieu interieur]] in the mid-1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state “… there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism (Bernard, 1865)". [[Walter Cannon]], a professor of physiology at [[Harvard University]] coined the commonly used term, [[homeostasis]] in his book The Wisdom of the Body,1932, from the Greek word homoios, meaning similar, and stasis, meaning position. In his work with animals Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as [[anxiety]], [[distress]], or [[rage (emotion)|rage]] was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage, 1915). These studies into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the autonomic nervous system, namely the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses that initiated the recognition of the [[fight or flight response|freeze, fight or flight response]]. His findings were published from time to time in professional journals, then summed up in book form in ''The Mechanical Factors of Digestion'', published in 1911. 

[[Hans Selye]], a student of [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[McGill University]], and a researcher at [[Université de Montréal]], experimented with animals putting them under different physical and mental adverse conditions and noted that under these conditions the body consistently adapted to heal and recover. Several years of experimentation that formed the empiric foundation of Dr. Selye's concept of the [[General Adaptation Syndrome]]. This syndrome consists of an enlargement of the [[adrenal]] gland, atrophy of the [[thymus]], [[spleen]] and other [[lymphoid]] tissue, and gastric [[Peptic ulcer|ulcerations]].

Selye describes three stages of adaptation, including an initial brief alarm reaction, followed by a prolonged period of resistance and a terminal stage of exhaustion and death. This foundational work led to a rich line of research on the biological functioning of [[glucocorticoids]].<ref>Thomas C. Neylan, M.D. "Hans Selye and the Field of Stress Research" J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 10:230, May 1998</ref>

Mid 20th century studies of psychiatric patients reported immune alterations in psychotic patients, including numbers of [[lymphocytes]]<ref>Freeman H, Elmadjian F. The relationship between blood sugar and lymphocyte levels in normal and psychotic subjects. Psychosom Med 1947; 9: 226–33.</ref><ref>Phillips L, Elmadjian F. A Rorschach tension score and the diurnal lymphocyte curve in psychotic subjects. Psychosom Med 1947; 9: 364–71</ref> and poorer [[antibody]] response to pertussis vaccination, compared with nonpsychiatric control subjects.<ref>Vaughan WTJ, Sullivan JC, Elmadjian F. Immunity and schizophrenia. Psychosom Med 1949; 11: 327–33.</ref> In 1964 George F. Solomon, of The [[University of California in Los Angeles]] et all. coined the term "psychoimmunology" and published a landmark paper: "Emotions, immunity, and disease: a speculative theoretical integration."<ref>Solomon GF, Moos RH. Emotions, immunity, and disease: a speculative theoretical integration. Arch Gen
Psychiatry 1964; 11: 657–74</ref>

===Birth of psychoneuroimmunology===
In 1975 [[Robert Ader]] and [[Nicholas Cohen]] at the [[University of Rochester]] advanced PNI with their demonstration of classic conditioning of immune function, and coined the term "psychoneuroimmunology".<ref>R Ader and N Cohen. [http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/abstract/37/4/333 Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression.] Psychosomatic Medicine, Vol 37, Issue 4 333-340</ref><ref>[http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/GEBS/faculty/Robert_Ader.htm Robert Ader]- Robert Ader - Papers on Psychoneuroimmunology.</ref><ref name=roch>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Robert Ader, Founder of Psychoneuroimmunology, Dies |url=http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=3370 |work=[[University of Rochester Medical Center]] |publisher= |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref> Ader was investigating how long conditioned responses (in the sense of [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s conditioning of dogs to drool when they heard a bell ring) might last in laboratory rats. To condition the rats, he used a combination of [[saccharin]]-laced water (the conditioned stimulus) and the drug [[Cytoxan]] which unconditionally induces [[nausea and taste aversion]] and suppression of the immune system. Ader was surprised to discover that after conditioning, just feeding the rats saccharin-laced water was associated with the death of some animals and he proposed that they had been immunosuppressed after receiving the conditioned stimulus.  Ader (a psychologist) and Cohen (an immunologist) directly tested this hypothesis by deliberately immunizing conditioned and unconditioned animals, exposing these and other control groups to the conditioned taste stimulus, and then measuring the amount of antibody produced.  The highly reproducible results revealed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were indeed immuno suppressed.  In other words, a signal via the nervous system (taste) was affecting immune function. This was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system.

In 1981 David Felten, then working at the [[Indiana University]] of Medicine, discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system. The researchers also found nerves in the [[thymus]] and [[spleen]] terminating near clusters of [[lymphocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[mast cell]]s, all of which help control immune function. This discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro-immune interaction occurs.

Ader, Cohen and Felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book ''Psychoneuroimmunology'' in 1981, which laid out the underlying premise that the brain and immune system represent a single, integrated system of defense.

In 1985, research by neuropharmacologist [[Candace Pert]], of the [[National Institutes of Health]] at [[Georgetown University]] revealed that [[neuropeptide]]-specific receptors are present on the cell walls of both the brain and the immune system.<ref>Pert CB, Ruff MR, Weber RJ, Herkenham M. Neuropeptides and their receptors: a psychosomatic network. J Immunol. 1985 Aug;135(2 Suppl):820s-826s</ref><ref>Ruff M, Schiffmann E, Terranova V, Pert CB.Neuropeptides are chemoattractants for human tumor cells and monocytes: a possible mechanism for metastasis. Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1985 Dec;37(3):387-96</ref> The discovery by Pert et al. that neuropeptides and neurotransmitters act directly upon the immune system shows their close association with [[emotions]] and suggests mechanisms through which emotions and immunology are deeply interdependent. Showing that the immune and [[endocrine]] systems are modulated not only by the brain but also by the central nervous system itself has had an impact on the understanding of emotions, as well as of disease.

Contemporary advances in psychiatry, immunology, neurology and other integrated disciplines of medicine has fostered enormous growth for PNI. The mechanisms underlying behaviorally induced alterations of immune function, and immune alterations inducing behavioral changes, are likely to have clinical and therapeutic implications that will not be fully appreciated until more is known about the extent of these interrelationships in normal and pathophysiological states.

==The immune-brain loop==
{{further|Cell signaling networks|Signal transduction}}

PNI research is looking for the exact mechanisms by which specific brainimmunity effects are achieved. Evidence for nervous system–immune system interactions exists at several biological levels.

The immune system and the brain talk to each other through signaling pathways. The brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body. Two major pathways are involved in this cross-talk: the [[Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS). The activation of SNS during an immune response might be aimed to localize the inflammatory response.

The body's primary stress management system is the HPA axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's [[cortisol]] level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases. HPA axis activity and cytokines are intrinsically intertwined: inflammatory cytokines stimulate [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and cortisol secretion, while, in turn, [[glucocorticoids]] suppress the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines.

Molecules called pro-inflammatory cytokines, which include [[interleukin-1]] (IL-1), [[Interleukin-2]] (IL-2), [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6), [[Interleukin-12]] (IL-12), [[Interferon-gamma]] (IFN-Gamma) and [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNF-alpha) can affect brain growth as well as neuronal function. Circulating immune cells such as [[macrophages]], as well as [[glial]] cells ([[microglia]] and [[astrocytes]]) secrete these molecules. Cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders.<ref name = Covelli>Covelli V, Passeri ME, Leogrande D, Jirillo E, Amati L. Drug targets in stress-related disorders.Curr Med Chem. 2005;12(15):1801-9|PMID 16029148</ref>

Cytokines mediate and control [[immune]] and [[inflammation|inflammatory]] responses. Complex interactions exist between cytokines, inflammation and the adaptive responses in maintaining [[homeostasis]]. Like the stress response, the inflammatory reaction is crucial for survival. Systemic inflammatory reaction results in stimulation of four major programs:<ref>Elenkov IJ, Iezzoni DG, Daly A, Harris AG, [[Chrousos GP.]] "Cytokine dysregulation, inflammation and well-being". Neuroimmunomodulation. 2005;12(5):255-69</ref>
* the acute-phase reaction
* [[Sickness behavior]]
* the pain program
* the stress response

These are mediated by the HPA axis and the SNS. Common human diseases such as [[allergy]], autoimmunity, chronic infections and [[sepsis]] are characterized by a dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory and [[T helper]] (Th1) versus (Th2) cytokine balance.

Recent studies show pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] processes take place during [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[mania]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] disease, in addition to autoimmune hypersensitivity and chronic infections.

Chronic secretion of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] [[hormones]], [[glucocorticoids]] (GCs) and [[catecholamines]] (CAs), as a result of disease, may reduce the effect of [[neurotransmitters]], including [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], or other receptors in the brain, thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones. Under stimulation, norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs, and the target immune cells express [[adrenergic receptors|adrenoreceptors]]. Through stimulation of these receptors, locally released norepinephrine, or circulating catecholamines such as [[epinephrine]], affect [[lymphocyte]] traffic, circulation, and proliferation, and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different [[lymphoid]] cells.

Glucocorticoids also inhibit the further secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the [[hypothalamus]] and ACTH from the [[pituitary]] ([[negative feedback]]). Under certain conditions stress hormones may facilitate inflammation through induction of signaling pathways and through activation of the [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]].

These abnormalities and the failure of the adaptive systems to resolve inflammation affect the well-being of the individual, including behavioral parameters, quality of life and sleep, as well as indices of [[metabolic]] and cardiovascular health, developing into a "systemic anti-inflammatory feedback" and/or "hyperactivity" of the local pro-inflammatory factors which may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease.

This systemic or neuro-inflammation and neuroimmune activation have been shown to play a role in the [[etiology]] of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as [[Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], pain, and [[AIDS]]-associated dementia. However, [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s also modulate central nervous system (CNS) function in the absence of overt immunological, physiological, or psychological challenges.<ref>[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-05-054.html Functional Links between the Immune System, Brain Function and Behavior]</ref>

==Psychoneuroimmunological effects==
There is now sufficient data to conclude that immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and/or interventions can lead to actual health changes. Although changes related to [[infectious disease]] and [[wound]] healing have provided the strongest evidence to date, the clinical importance of immunological disregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases. For example, stressors can produce profound health consequences. In one epidemiological study, for example, all-cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor – the death of a spouse.<ref name="Kaprio, J. 1987">Kaprio, J., Koskenvuo, M., and Rita, H.

===Understanding Stress and Immune Function===

[[Stress (medicine)|Stress]] is thought to affect immune function through emotional and/or behavioral manifestations such as [[anxiety]], [[fear]], [[Stress (biology)|tension]], [[anger]] and [[sadness]] and physiological changes such as [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]], and [[sweating]]. Researchers have suggested that these changes are beneficial if they are of limited duration,<ref name="Chrousos, G. P 1992"/> but when stress is chronic, the system is unable to maintain equilibrium or [[homeostasis]].

In one of the earlier PNI studies, which was published in 1960, subjects were led to believe that they had accidentally caused serious injury to a companion through misuse of explosives.<ref>McDonald RD, Yagi K. A note on eosinopenia as an index of psychological stress. Psychosom Med 1960;2 22: 149–50.</ref> Since then decades of research resulted in two large meta-analyses, which showed consistent immune dysregulation in healthy people who are experiencing stress.

In the first meta-analysis by Herbert and Cohen in 1993,<ref>Herbert TB, Cohen S. Stress and immunity in humans: a meta-analytic review. Psychosom Med. 1993;55:364–379.</ref> they examined 38 studies of stressful events and immune function in healthy adults. They included studies of acute laboratory stressors (e.g. a speech task), short-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. medical examinations), and long-term naturalistic stressors (e.g. divorce, bereavement, caregiving, unemployment). They found consistent stress-related increases in numbers of total [[white blood cells]], as well as decreases in the numbers of [[helper T cells]], [[suppressor T cells]], and [[cytotoxic T cells]], [[B cells]], and [[Natural killer]] cells (NK). They also reported stress-related decreases in NK and T cell function, and T cell proliferative responses to [[phytohaemagglutinin]] [PHA] and [[concanavalin A]] [Con A]. These effects were consistent for short-term and long-term naturalistic stressors, but not laboratory stressors.

In the second meta-analysis by Zorrilla et al. in 2001,<ref>Zorrilla, E. P., Luborsky, L., McKay, J. R., Rosenthal, R., Houldin, A., Tax, A., McCorkle, R., Seligman, D. A., & Schmidt, K. (2001). The relationship of depression and stressors to immunological assays: a meta-analytic review. Brain Behavior and Immunity, 15(3), 199-226.</ref> they replicated Herbert and Cohen’s meta-analysis. Using the same study selection procedures, they analyzed 75 studies of stressors and human immunity. Naturalistic stressors were associated with increases in number of circulating [[neutrophils]], decreases in number and percentages of total [[T cells]] and [[helper T cells]], and decreases in percentages of [[Natural killer cell]] (NK) cells and [[cytotoxic T cell]] lymphocytes. They also replicated Herbert and Cohen’s finding of stress-related decreases in NKCC and T cell [[mitogen]] proliferation to [[Phytohaemagglutinin]] (PHA) and [[Concanavalin A]] (Con A).

More recently, there has been increasing interest in the links between interpersonal stressors and immune function. For example, marital conflict, loneliness, caring for a person with a chroic medical condition, and other forms on interpersonal stress dysregulate immune function. <ref name = "Ja_review">{{vcite journal |author=Jaremka, L.M. |title=Synergistic relationships among stress, depression, and troubled relationships: Insights from Psychoneuroimmunology |journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume= |pages= |year=in press|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.22078/full |accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref> 

===Communication between the brain and immune system===
* Stimulation of brain sites alters immunity (stressed animals have altered immune systems).
* Immune cells produce cytokines that act on the CNS.
* Immune cells respond to signals from the CNS.

===Communication between neuroendocrine and immune system===
* Glucocorticoids and catecholamines influence immune cells.<ref>Papanicolaou DA, Wilder RL, Manolagas SC, Chrousos GP. The pathophysiologic roles of interleukin-6 in human disease. Ann Intern Med 1998; 128: 127–37.The Pathophysiologic Roles of Interleukin-6 in Human Disease Annals of Internal Medicine 15 January 1998 | Volume 128 Issue 2 | Pages 127-137</ref>
* Endorphins from [[pituitary]] & [[adrenal medulla]] act on immune system.
* Activity of the immune system is correlated with neurochemical/neuroendocrine activity of brain cells.

===Connections between glucocorticoids and immune system===
* Anti-inflammatory hormones that enhance the organisms response to a stressor.
* Prevent the overreaction of the body's own defense system.
* Regulators of the immune system.
* Affect cell growth, proliferation & differentiation.
* Cause immunosuppression.
* Suppress [[cell adhesion]], [[antigen]] presentation, chemotaxis & cytotoxicity.
* Increase [[apoptosis]].

===Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)===
Release of [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) from the [[hypothalamus]] is influenced by stress.
* CRH is a major regulator of the HPA axis/stress axis.
* CRH Regulates secretion of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH).
* CRH is widely distributed in the brain and periphery
* CRH also regulates the actions of the [[Autonomic nervous system]] ANS and immune system.

Furthermore, stressors that enhance the release of CRH suppress the function of the immune system; conversely, stressors that depress CRH release potentiate immunity.
* Central mediated since peripheral administration of CRH antagonist does not affect immunosuppression.

==Pharmaceutical advances==
{{further|Neuropsychopharmacology}}

[[Glutamate|Glutamate agonists]], cytokine inhibitors, [[TRPV1|vanilloid-receptor agonists]], catecholamine modulators, [[Ion channel|ion-channel blockers]], [[anticonvulsants]], [[GABA|GABA agonists]] (including [[opioids]] and [[cannabinoids]]), [[Cyclooxygenase|COX inhibitors]], [[Acetylcholine|acetylcholine modulators]], [[melatonin]] analogs (such as [[Rozerem|Ramelton]]), [[Adenosine receptor|adenosine receptor antagonists]] and several miscellaneous drugs (including biologics like [[Passiflora edulis]]) are being studied for their psychoneuroimmunological effects.

For example, [[SSRI]]s, [[SNRI]]s and [[tricyclic]] [[antidepressants]] acting on [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] receptors have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory cytokine processes, specifically on the regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-10, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-6 through a psychoneuroimmunological process.<ref name="ReferenceA">Kubera M, Lin AH, Kenis G, Bosmans E, van Bockstaele D, Maes M.

These studies warrant investigation for antidepressants for use in both psychiatric and non-psychiatric illness and that a psychoneuroimmunological approach may be required for optimal [[pharmacotherapy]] in many diseases.<ref>Kulmatycki KM, Jamali F.

"Cytokines: abnormalities in major depression and implications for pharmacological treatment". Hum Psychopharmacol. 2004 Aug;19(6):397-403.</ref>

Extrapolating from the observations that positive emotional experiences boost the immune system, Roberts speculates that intensely positive emotional experiences —sometimes brought about during mystical experiences occasioned by psychedelic medicines—may boost the immune system powerfully. Research on salivary IgA supports this hypothesis, but experimental testing has not been done.<ref>Roberts, Thomas B. (2006).
