'''Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita''' (abbreviated to SED more often than SDC) is a rare disorder of [[bone]] growth that results in [[dwarfism]], characteristic skeletal abnormalities, and occasionally problems with [[Visual perception|vision]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. The name of the condition indicates that it affects the bones of the [[vertebral column|spine]] (spondylo-) and the ends of bones ([[epiphyses]]), and that it is present from birth ([[congenital]]). The signs and symptoms of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita are similar to, but milder than, the related skeletal disorders [[achondrogenesis type 2]] and [[hypochondrogenesis]]. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is a subtype of [[collagenopathy, types II and XI]].

==Presentation==
People with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia are short-statured from birth, with a very short trunk and neck and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. This type of dwarfism is characterized by a normal spinal column length relative to the femur bone. Adult height ranges from 0.9 meters (35&nbsp;inches) to just over 1.4 meters (55&nbsp;inches). Curvature of the spine (kypho[[scoliosis]] and [[lordosis]]) progresses during childhood and can cause problems with breathing. Changes in the spinal bones ([[vertebrae]]) in the [[neck]] may also increase the risk of [[spinal cord]] damage. Other skeletal signs include flattened vertebrae ([[platyspondyly]]), a [[hip]] joint deformity in which the upper leg bones turn inward ([[coxa vara]]), and an inward- and downward-turning foot (called [[clubfoot]]). Decreased joint mobility and arthritis often develop early in life. Medical texts often state a mild and variable change to facial features, including  [[cheekbone]]s close to the nose appearing flattened, although this appears to be unfounded.  Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth, which is called a [[cleft palate]]. Severe nearsightedness (high [[myopia]]) is sometimes present, as are other eye problems that can affect vision such as detached retinas. About one-quarter of people with this condition have [[hearing loss]].

Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the ''[[COL2A1]]'' gene. The protein made by this gene forms type II [[collagen]], a molecule found mostly in [[cartilage]] and in the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the [[vitreous humour|vitreous]]). Type II collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other [[connective tissue]]s. Mutations in the ''COL2A1'' gene interfere with the assembly of type II collagen molecules, which prevents bones from developing properly and causes the signs and symptoms of this condition.

Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder.

==Notable cases==
Actor [[Warwick Davis]]'s dwarfism has been attributed to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita. The condition of late actor [[Michael Dunn (actor)|Michael Dunn]] has been attributed to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, type unspecified. Actress and comedienne Selene Luna may have it as well.
Bill Klein and Jennifer Arnold from the TV series ''[[The Little Couple]]'' both have spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia as well.
