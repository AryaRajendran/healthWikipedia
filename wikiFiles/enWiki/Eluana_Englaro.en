'''Eluana Englaro'''  (25 November 1970 – 9 February 2009) was an [[Italy|Italian]] woman from [[Lecco]], who entered a [[persistent vegetative state]] on 18 January 1992, following a [[car accident]], and subsequently became the focus of a court battle between supporters and opponents of [[euthanasia]]. Shortly after Englaro had been fed with a probe,{{vague|date=November 2011}} her father requested to have her [[feeding tube]] removed and to allow her to die "naturally". The authorities initially refused his request, but this decision was later reversed after seventeen years.

==Trial and ruling==

The case was debated in court and her father's request was denied both in December 1999 by the [[Milan]] [[Court of Appeal]] and in April 2005 by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]]. A request for a new [[trial]] was granted by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] on 16 October 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2007/10/16/italys_right_to_die_case_gets_new_trial/2490/ |title=Italy's 'right to die' case gets new trial |publisher=United Press International |date=2007-10-16}}</ref>

The Milan Court of Appeal declared on 9 July 2008 that Eluana's father and legal guardian Beppino Englaro was allowed to suspend feeding and hydration.<ref>{{It}} {{cite web |url=http://www.corriere.it/Media/Foto/2008/07/09/eluana_low.pdf |title=Sentenza Corte d'Appello su Eluana Englaro |publisher=Corriere}} 2008-07-09</ref>

Some friends of Eluana testified that she had repeatedly stated that it would be better to die than surviving in conditions of complete unconsciousness. About a year before the accident that reduced her in a [[permanent vegetative state]], Eluana was shocked by the news that a dear friend had a motorbike accident. She admitted that she had prayed that the boy could die in peace without any further suffering. Later, she discussed with her parents about this and made them promise that, should something like this happen to her, they would never allow her to survive while remaining unconscious and without free will, totally dependent on the care of others.

Nuns caring for Eluana since 1994 in [[Lecco]] were willing to continue their usual charitable treatment, and they came to the point of asking the woman's father to leave the girl to them and forget her, stating that Mr. Englaro considered his only daughter as "dead", while they considered her "alive" indeed, without saying a word about Eluana's real convictions.
So, Mr. Beppino Englaro decided to move her to another hospital in order to have her feeding suspended according to the will she had expressed. 

Some people split on the Court of appeal's decision, some demonstrated in favour, including [[Radicali Italiani]].

In July 2008, the Italian Parliament brought a jurisdictional conflict before the Final Court of Appeal, stating that the decision was actually changing existing laws. This request was rejected by the Court.

On 13 November 2008 the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] awarded Eluana's father the right to stop his daughter from being fed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7728284.stm |title=Italy man wins life support plea |publisher=BBC News | date=2008-11-13}}</ref> The court's decision met with immediate criticism from the Roman Catholic Church.

===Final days and death===
Beppino Englaro, as he stated in one of his several public appearances, waited until all appeals were concluded before he suspended the feeding of his daughter. On 2 February 2009 she was moved to a private nursing home in [[Udine]], [[Friuli]], and feeding was discontinued.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hrTN5x6KYdl2laMpTTGIeEKMtTxgD9641Q5G1 |title=Italian woman moved to hospital where she can die |agency=Associated Press | date=2009-02-03}}</ref> On 6 February 2009 Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] - after declaring that Eluana looked pretty well and "could even give birth to a son" - issued a decree that would have forced the continuation of the treatment of Eluana, and thrust [[Italy]] into a constitutional crisis when the President of the Republic, [[Giorgio Napolitano]], refused to sign the decree.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/08/englaro-italy-vatican |title=Italy faces constitutional crisis over coma woman |publisher=Guardian |date=2009-02-08 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Day}}</ref> Prime Minister Berlusconi alleged she died at 19:35 (GMT+1) on 9 February 2009. The autopsy in the private nursing house certified the death was caused by the last days' abstention from food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/europe/10italy.html |title=Death Ends Coma Case That Set Off Furor in Italy |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2009-02-09 |first=Rachel |last=Donadio |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref>
The autopsy revealed that the Eluana's brain had been irreparably damaged and compromised, showing what is called [[diffuse axonal injury]]. In addition, her lungs showed signs of degeneration.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

== Opinion and reaction ==

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has been critical of the decision that led to Englaro's biological death. When the final judicial decision was handed down, [[Ennio Antonelli|Ennio Cardinal Antonelli]], president of the [[Pontifical Council for the Family]] objected to the ruling citing Eluana's humanity as cause for her to be treated with dignity and that she is not a 'vegetable'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=14369 |title=Vatican cardinal pleads for life of Italian 'Terri Schiavo' | date=2008-11-18}}</ref> Italian [[premier]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]] even stated that Eluana "''looks fine and healthy''" and "''could even give birth to a son''" despite the young woman being [[Tetraplegia|tetraplegic]] because of injuries sustained in the car accident.

The reaction to Englaro's death was mixed. Rome's mayor, [[Gianni Alemanno]], announced the [[Colosseum]] would be lit all night on 10 February to memorialize "a life that could have and should have been saved."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article5697099.ece |title='Right to die' coma woman Eluana Englaro dies |publisher=timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] said that "mercy delayed is mercy denied" and expressed his regret that Englaro's family had to wait seventeen years to effectuate her wishes. However, the conservative bioethicist [[Wesley J. Smith]] has leveled criticism at the decision to withdraw hydration, stating that the supporters of such a decision portray a false perception that withdrawal of hydration has "benign" consequences for the victim, which he argues is not the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjsmith.com/blog/2009/02/eluana-englaro-dehydration-begins.html |title=Eluana Englaro: Dehydration Begins |publisher=Wesleyjsmith.com |date=2009-02-07 |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref>
