'''Herpes simian B virus''' (''Macacine herpesvirus 1'' (formerly ''Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1'', CHV-1 <ref>[http://cdc.gov/herpesbvirus B Virus] at [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].</ref>), ''Herpesvirus simiae'', B virus) is the endemic [[simplexvirus]] of [[macaque]] monkeys.  B virus is an [[alphaherpesvirus]], which consists of a subset of herpes viruses that travel within hosts using the peripheral nerves.  As such, this [[neurotropic virus]] is not found in the blood.

In the natural host, the [[virus]] exhibits [[pathogenesis]] similar to that of [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV) in humans.  Conversely, when humans are [[zoonotic]]ally infected with B virus, patients can present with severe [[central nervous system]] disease, resulting in permanent neurological dysfunction or death.  Severity of the disease increases for untreated patients, with a [[case fatality rate]] of approximately 80%.  Early diagnosis and subsequent treatment are the linchpins of surviving the infection.

Linked with more than two dozen deaths since its discovery, B virus is the only identified nonhuman primate herpesvirus that displays severe pathogenicity in humans.  The last identified case of human B virus infection occurred in 2008, with the last known fatality occurring in 1997 when researcher [[Yerkes_Research_Center#Beth_Griffin_Death_Controversy|Elizabeth Griffin]] was splashed in the eye at [[Yerkes National Primate Research Center]].<ref>http://www.ergriffinresearch.org/about-elizabeth/</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/14/us/a-drop-of-virus-from-a-monkey-kills-a-researcher-in-6-weeks.html |title=A Drop of Virus From a Monkey Kills a Researcher in 6 Weeks |first=Rick |last=Bragg |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 14, 1997}}</ref> Proper [[personal protective equipment]] is essential when working with macaques, especially those who have tested positive for the virus.  Bites, scratches and exposures to [[mucous membranes]], including the eye, must be cleaned immediately.  Samples from both the macaque and human should be sent for B virus diagnostic testing as recommended by the B Virus Working Group here: [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/BVIRUS.pdf BVIRUS.pdf]

As of 2002, there were 26 documented cases of human B virus infection, 16 of which led to death.  At least 20 of the patients developed some degree of encephalitis.<ref name="wustl_factsheet">[http://dcminfo.wustl.edu/occhealth/factsheet_herpesb.html Herpes-B Fact Sheet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="PMID1313312">{{cite journal

==History==
Herpes B virus was first identified in 1932 following the death of Dr. William Brebner, a young physician who was bitten by a monkey while researching the virus that causes [[poliomyelitis]].  Soon after, Brebner developed localized [[erythema]], followed by [[lymphangitis]], [[lymphadenitis]] and, ultimately, [[transverse myelitis]].  Neurologic tissues obtained during Dr. Brebner’s autopsy revealed the presence of an ultrafilterable agent that appeared similar to HSV.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gay PP, Holden M |title=Isolation of herpesvirus from several cases of epidemic encephalitis |journal=Proc Soc Exp Biol Med |issue=30 |pages=1051–53 |year=1933}}</ref>  This isolate was originally termed “W virus.”

Within a year of Brebner’s death, Dr. [[Albert Sabin]] identified an unfilterable agent from the same tissue,<ref name="Sabin1934">{{cite journal |author=Sabin AB, Wright WM |title=Acute ascending myelitis following a monkey bite, with the isolation of a virus capable of reproducing the disease |journal=J Exp Med |issue=2 |pages=115–36 |year=1934 |pmid=19870235 |volume=59 |pmc=2132353| doi=10.1084/jem.59.2.115 }}</ref> which he later named B virus.  Sabin further described the lethality of B virus by showing that infectivity was independent of the route of inoculation.<ref name="Sabin1934"/>  Additionally, it was observed that B virus induced immunologic responses similar to HSV-1,<ref name="Sabin1934a">{{cite journal |author=Sabin AB |title=Studies on the B virus I: The immunological identity of a virus isolated from a human case of ascending myelitis associated with visceral necrosis |journal=Br J Exp Pathol |issue=15 |pages=248–68 |year=1934}}</ref> as well as shared similarities to HVP-2 and Langur herpesvirus, two other nonhuman primate alphaherpesviruses.<ref name="Sabin1934a"/><ref name="PMID7613729">{{cite journal |author=Eberle R, Hilliard J |title=The simian herpesviruses |journal=Infectious Agents and Disease |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=55–70 |year=1995 |pmid=7613729}}</ref><ref name="Sabin1934b">{{cite journal |author=Sabin AB |title=Studies on the B virus II: Properties of the virus and pathogenesis of the experimental disease in rabbits |journal=Br J Exp Pathol |issue=15 |pages=269–79 |year=1934}}</ref><ref name="Sabin1934c">{{cite journal |author=Sabin AB |title=Studies on the B virus III: The experimental disease in macacus rhesus monkeys |journal=Br J Exp Pathol |issue=15 |pages=321–34 |year=1934}}</ref><ref name="Burnet1939">{{cite journal |author=Burnet FM, Lush D, Jackson AV |title=The properties of herps B and pseudorabies viruses on the choriollantois |journal=Aust J Exp Biol Med Sci |issue=17 |pages=35–52 |year=1939}}</ref><ref name="Burnet1939a">{{cite journal |author=Burnet FM, Lush D, Jackson AV |title=The relationship of herpse and B viruses: immunological and epidemiological considerations |journal=Aust J Exp Biol Med Sci |issue=17 |pages=41–51 |year=1939}}</ref>

By 1959, B virus was identified as the causative agent in 17 human cases, 12 of which resulted in death.<ref name="Breen1958">{{cite journal |author=Breen GE, Lamb SG, Otaki AT |title=Monkey bite encephalomyelitis: report of a case with recovery |journal=Br Med J |issue=5087 |pages=22–3 |year=1958 |pmid=13546633 |volume=2 |pmc=2025841}}</ref><ref name="Hummeler1959">{{cite journal |author=Hummeler K, Davidson WL, Henle W, et al. |title=Encephalomyelitis due to infection with herpesvirus simiae (herpes B virus): a report of two fatal, laboratory acquired cases |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |issue=261 |pages=64–8 |year=1959}}</ref><ref name="Pierce1958">{{cite journal |author=Pierce EC, Pierce JD, Hull RN |title=B virus: its current significance, description and diagnosis of a fatal human infection |journal=Am J Hyg |issue=68 |pages=242–50 |year=1958}}</ref> Approximately 50 cases had been identified by 2002, although only 26 were well documented.  The latest identified case of B virus occurred in 2008, per the National B Virus Resource Center in Atlanta, GA.

Improvements in human cases have been made in the past several decades. Between 1987 to 2004 the rate of mortality has decreased, largely due to the addition of new forms of treatment and improved diagnosis. There have been a total of 5 fatalities related to Herpes B virus in this timeframe.<ref>http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/yellowbook-2012-home.htm Accessed 2/2/2013</ref>

Traveling to an area where Macaques are known carriers of the virus and interacting in close contact in areas such as temples poses a risk for exposure. However, even in endemic areas, human cases are rare. There have been no known cases of Herpes B virus in travelers.<ref>http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/yellowbook-2012-home.htm Accessed 2/2/2013</ref> 

==Virology==
===Viral Genome===
The B virus [[genome]] was fully sequenced in 2003 from an isolate found in a [[rhesus macaque]].<ref name="Perelygina2003">{{cite journal |author=Perelygina L, Zhu L, Zurkuhlen H, et al. |title=Complete sequence and comparative analysis of the genome of herpes b virus (Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1) from a rhesus monkey |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=77 |issue=11 |pages=6167–77 |year=2003 |pmid=12743273 |pmc=155011}}</ref>  Like all herpes viruses, the B virus genome contains double-stranded [[DNA]] and is approximately 157 kbp in length. Two unique regions (UL and US) are flanked by a pair of inverted repeats, two of which are found at the termini, with the other two internally located.  This arrangement, which is identical in nature to HSV, results in four sequence-oriented isomers.  [[Cytosine]] and [[guanine]] nucleotides represent 75% of the sequence.

Sequence analyses suggest that B virus and HSV types 1 and 2 most likely diverged from a common ancestor during the evolution of these pathogens.  Each gene-encoded [[glycoprotein]], including gB, gC, gD, gE and gG, has approximately 50% homology with HSV, with a slightly higher predilection towards HSV-2 over HSV-1.<ref name="Perelygina2003"/>  Additionally, glycoprotein sequences have demonstrated that all cysteine residues are conserved, as are most [[glycosylation]] sites.

==Treatment==
[[Acyclovir]] has prevented progression of the disease in some patients and may be life saving. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent permanent neurological impairment.<ref name="Ostrowski">{{cite journal
