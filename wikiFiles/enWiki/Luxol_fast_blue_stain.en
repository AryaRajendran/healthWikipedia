'''Luxol fast blue stain''', abbreviated '''LFB stain''' or simply '''LFB''', is a commonly used [[staining|stain]] to observe [[myelin]] under [[light microscopy]], created by [[Heinrich Klüver]] and Barrera in 1953.<ref>Kluver, H., and Barrera, E. A method for the combined staining of cells and fibers in the Nervous system. ''J. Nueropath. Exp. Neurol. 12:400-403'', 1953.</ref> LFB is commonly used to detect [[demyelination]] in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), but cannot discern myelination in the [[peripheral nervous system]].<ref name="Oh2002">{{cite book|author=Shin J.

==Procedure==
Luxol fast blue is a copper phthalocyanine dye that is soluble in alcohol and is attracted to bases found in the [[lipoprotein]]s of the [[myelin sheath]].<ref name="Jocelyn">{{cite book|author=Bruce-Gregorios, Jocelyn|title=Histophatologic Techniques|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DCMUb2chHzUC&pg=PA241|accessdate=1 January 2013|publisher=Goodwill Trading Co., Inc.|isbn=978-971-12-0270-5|pages=241–}}</ref><ref name="HumphreyDehner2008">{{cite book|author1=Peter A.

Under the stain, [[myelin]] fibers appear blue, neuropil appears pink, and [[nerve cells]] appear purple. Tissues sections are treated over an extended period of time (usually overnight) and then differentiated with a lithium carbonate solution.<ref name="HumphreyDehner2008" />

==Combination methods==
The combination of LFB with a variety of common staining methods provides the most useful and reliable method for the demonstration of pathological processes in the CNS.<ref name="Oh2002" /> It is often combined with [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]], which is abbreviated ''H-E-LFB'', ''H&E-LFB''.

Other common staining methods include the periodic acid-Schiff, [[Oil Red O]], phosphotungstic acid, and [[Holmes silver nitrate]] method.<ref name="Oh2002" />
