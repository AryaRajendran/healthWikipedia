The first recognized Dengue epidemics occurred almost simultaneously in Asia, Africa, and North America in the 1780s, shortly after the identification and naming of the disease in 1779. A [[pandemic]] began in [[Southeast Asia]] in the 1950s, and by 1975 DHF had become a leading cause of death among children in the region. Epidemic dengue has become more common since the 1980s. By the late 1990s, dengue was the most important mosquito-borne disease affecting humans after malaria, with around 40 million cases of dengue fever and several hundred thousand cases of dengue [[Viral hemorrhagic fever|hemorrhagic fever]] each year.
Significant outbreaks of dengue fever tend to occur every five or six months. The cyclical rise and fall in numbers of dengue cases is thought to be the result of seasonal cycles interacting with a short-lived cross-immunity{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} for all four strains in people who have had dengue. When the cross-immunity wears off the population is more susceptible to transmission whenever the next seasonal peak occurs. Thus over time there remain large numbers of susceptible people in affected populations despite previous outbreaks due to the four different [[serotypes]] of dengue virus and the presence of unexposed individuals from childbirth or immigration.

There is significant evidence, originally suggested by S.B. Halstead in the 1970s, that dengue hemorrhagic fever is more likely to occur in people who have secondary infections by another one of dengue fever's four serotypes. One model to explain this process is known as [[antibody-dependent enhancement]] (ADE), which allows for increased uptake and [[virion]] replication during a secondary infection with a different strain. Through an immunological phenomenon, known as [[original antigenic sin]], the [[immune system]] is not able to adequately respond to the stronger infection, and the secondary infection becomes far more serious.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rothman AL |title=Dengue: defining protective versus pathologic immunity |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=113 |issue=7 |pages=946–51 |year=2004 |pmid=15057297 |doi=10.1172/JCI200421512 |pmc=379334}}</ref>

Reported cases of dengue are an under-representation of all cases when accounting for subclinical cases and cases where the patient did receive medical treatment.

There was a serious outbreak in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in February 2002 affecting around one million people and killing sixteen. On March 20, 2008, the secretary of health of the [[state of Rio de Janeiro]], Sérgio Côrtes, announced that 23,555 cases of dengue, including 30 deaths, had been recorded in the state in less than three months. Côrtes said, "I am treating this as an epidemic because the number of cases is extremely high." Federal Minister of Health, José Gomes Temporão also announced that he was forming a panel to respond to the situation. [[Cesar Maia]], mayor of the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], denied that there was serious cause for concern, saying that the incidence of cases was in fact declining from a peak at the beginning of February.<ref>{{Cite news

In [[Singapore]], there are 4,000–5,000 reported cases of dengue fever or dengue haemorrhagic fever every year. In the year 2004, there were seven deaths from dengue shock syndrome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B7CPT-4KKNNH5-2&_user=130561&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000010878&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=130561&md5=4cc1b9743b4fddf5a0567b16b99bc130 |title=International Journal of Infectious Diseases - Fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever in adults during a dengue epidemic in Singapore |publisher=ScienceDirect.com |date=2004-09-31 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>

Since beginning of 2013, There were 510 cases in the week ending 20 April, the highest weekly number recorded since the major outbreak in 2005.Over 30,000 People's Association volunteers were mobilised in a national campaign to get members of the public to do their part to stamp out dengue. <ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dengue-cases-could-rise-to-1-000-a-week-/656362.html]</ref>

There is an ongoing 2010 outbreak occurring in Puerto Rico with 5382 confirmed infections and 20 deaths. Nearby [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], in the French Caribbean, were very much affected as well: over 40000 clinical cases in each island required medical assistance (the outbreak peaked in August 2010 and was practically over by October).

An outbreak of dengue fever was declared in [[Cairns]], located in the tropical north of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] on 1 December 2008. As of 3 March 2009 there were 503 confirmed cases of dengue fever, in a residential population of 152,137. Outbreaks were subsequently declared the neighbouring cities and towns of [[Townsville]] (outbreak declared 5 January 2009), Port Douglas (6 February 2009), Yarrabah (19 February 2009), Injinoo (24 February 2009), Innisfail (27 February 2009) and [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] (10 March 2009). There have been occurrences of dengue types one, two, three, and four in the region. On March 4, 2009, Queensland Health had confirmed an elderly woman had died from dengue fever in Cairns, in the first fatality since the epidemic began last year. The statement said that although the woman had other health problems, she tested positive for dengue and the disease probably contributed to her death.

An [[2009 Bolivian dengue fever epidemic|epidemic broke out in Bolivia]] in early 2009, in which 18 people have died and 31,000 infected.

In 2009, in [[Argentina]], a dengue outbreak was declared the northern provinces of [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]], [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]], and [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], with over 9673 cases reported as of April 11, 2009 by the Health Ministry.<ref>[http://www.msal.gov.ar/htm/Site/sala_situacion/index.asp ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>  Some travelers from the affected zones have spread the fever as far south as  [[Buenos Aires]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1117118 |title=Refuerzan las medidas para frenar el brote de dengue - 10.04.2009 - lanacion.com |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>  Major efforts to control the epidemic in [[Argentina]] are focused on preventing its [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] (the [[Aedes]] mosquitoes) from reproducing. This is addressed by asking people to dry out all possible water reservoirs from where mosquitoes could proliferate (which is, in other countries, known as "descacharrado"). There have also been information campaigns concerning prevention of the dengue fever; and the government is fumigating with insecticide in order to control the mosquito population.<ref>{{Cite journal

The first cases of dengue fever have recently been reported on the island nation of [[Mauritius]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. One of the South Asian countries still suffering highly from this problem is Sri Lanka.<ref>[http://srilankatourismboard.com/news/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=45:dengue-outbreak-claims-168-lives&catid=1:latest-news Sri Lanka]</ref>

An outbreak occurred in 2002 in [[Easter Island]].<ref name=Canals2012>Canals M, González C, Canals A, Figueroa D (2012) Epidemiological dynamics of dengue on Easter Island. Rev Chilena Infectol 29(4):388-94. doi: 10.1590/S0716-10182012000400004</ref> This outbreak was caused by Dengue serotype 1. Subsequent outbreaks occurred in 2006-2007 and 2008, 2009 and 2011. The male:female ratio in reported cases was approximately 1:1 and the age at infection was 31.38 ± 18.37 in both sexes. The reproductive number R<sub>0</sub> = 3.005 with 95% confidence interval of 1.92-4.61. Overall the pattern was of recurrent epidemics with decreasing magnitude (damped oscillations)- a known phenomenon in models of dengue.
