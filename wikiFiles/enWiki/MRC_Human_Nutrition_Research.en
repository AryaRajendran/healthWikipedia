'''MRC Human Nutrition Research''' is the largest [[research institute]] in the UK for human nutrition, and is based in [[Cambridge]].

==History==
In 1998 MRC Human Nutrition Research (HNR) was formed out of the restructuring of the [[Dunn Human Nutrition Unit]] following the resignation of Professor Roger Whitehead.<ref name=HNR>www.mrc-hnr.cam.ac.uk</ref> The MRC (founded in 1913) had previously had a Human Nutrition Research Unit at the end of the Second World War, founded and directed by [[BS Platt]], which was interested in serious nutritional deficiencies in children, that would cause significantly premature death and therefore HNR was formed in order to continue to progress the Medical Research Councils portfolio of strategic and applied nutrition research.

==Mission==
The mission of HNR is to conduct nutrition research and surveillance to improve the health of the population with a focus on obesity and metabolic risk, musculoskeletal health, intestinal health and nutritional inequalities.<ref name=HNR/>

==Objectives==
HNR currently states that its 4 objectives<ref name=HNR/> are to: 
*Advance knowledge through discovery science, the development of innovative methodologies and the application of specialist expertise in priority areas
*Improve health and economic advantage through the exchange of knowledge and technology to inform nutrition policy and practice
*Provide opportunities for training and to build capacity for nutrition research
*Foster a dialogue with the public on nutrition science and its implications for health

==Structure==
It is [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/644523 based] at Peterhouse Technology Park, in south-east Cambridge, on the [[South Cambridgeshire]]-Cambridge boundary, round the corner from the Fulbourn - Cherry Hinton [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/44579 Tesco] and [[Fulbourn Hospital]]. [[ARM Holdings]] have their [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/609459 headquarters] on the same site, and the Technology Park is also home to [[Acambis]], who make vaccines, and are sited as neighbours to HNR.

It is divided into 3 main research departments and a support department
* Cellular and Molecular Sciences
* Nutritional Physiology & Biomarkers
* Diet and Population Health
* Scientific Operations & Logistics

which house research groups looking at:
* National Nutrition Surveys
* Nutrition & Bone Health
* Nutritional Interventions
* Obesity & Related Metabolic Disorders
* Nutrition Communications and Translation into Policy & Practice
* Nutrition Epidemiology
* Biomineral Research
* Lipid Profiling and Signalling
* Physiological Modelling of Metabolic Risk
* Dietary Assessment

It also has a library which houses an important collection of research documents from a number of formative years in nutrition research.

==Function==
HNR conducts nutrition research and surveillance to improve the health of the population with a focus on obesity and metabolic risk, musculoskeletal health, intestinal health and nutritional inequalities.

===Research===
In November 1999 it discovered that children in the early 1950s, despite [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|food rationing]], had healthier diets than children today. They had a greater intake of calcium, from drinking more milk, and of iron, as they ate more red meat than poultry and iron containing dark green vegetables such as [[broccoli]] and [[kale]]. In the early 1950s, no children would have eaten pasta, but 50% of children in the 1990s did. However children in the 1950s were faced with more incurable illnesses, prevented today by [[Vaccination schedule#United_Kingdom|vaccination]].

In September 2002, it proved a link between [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]] and being overweight. They found that people who had lost 9&nbsp;lb in weight had reduced the chances of having diabetes by 58%.

It participated in the [[National Diet and Nutrition Survey]] and the MRC's [[National Survey of Health and Development]],<ref>[http://www.nshd.mrc.ac.uk NSHD]</ref> which showed insights such as approximately five per cent of the UK's population are vegetarian.
