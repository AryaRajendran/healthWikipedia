A '''rash''' is a change of the [[human skin|skin]] which affects its color, appearance or [[wikt:texture|texture]]. A rash may be localized in one part of the body, or affect all the skin. Rashes may cause the skin to change color, [[itch]], become warm, bumpy, [[chapped]], dry, cracked or [[blister]]ed, swell and may be painful. The causes, and therefore treatments for rashes, vary widely. Diagnosis must take into account such things as the appearance of the rash, other symptoms, what the patient may have been exposed to, occupation, and occurrence in family members. The diagnosis may confirm any number of conditions.

The presence of a rash may aid associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases. For example, the rash in measles is an [[erythema]]tous, [[morbilliform]], [[Maculopapular rash|maculopapular]] rash that begins a few days after the fever starts. It classically starts at the head and spreads downwards.

== Differential diagnosis ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Common causes of rashes include:
* Food [[Allergy]]
* [[Anxiety]].
* [[Allergy|Allergies]], for example to food, dyes, medicines, insect stings, metals such as zinc or nickel; such rashes are often called [[hives]].
* Skin contact with an [[irritation|irritant]]
** [[Fungal infection in animals|Fungal infection]], such as [[ringworm]]
* Reaction to [[vaccine|vaccination]]
* Skin diseases such as [[eczema]] or [[Acne vulgaris|acne]]
* Exposure to [[sun]] ([[sunburn]]) or [[heat]]
* [[Friction]] due to chafing of the skin
* [[Irritation]] such as caused by abrasives impregnated in clothing rubbing the skin. The cloth itself may be abrasive enough for some people
* [[Menstruation]]
* [[Secondary syphilis]]
Uncommon causes:
* [[Autoimmune disorder]]s such as [[psoriasis]]
* [[Lead poisoning]]
* [[Pregnancy]]
* Repeated scratching on a particular spot
* [[Lyme Disease]]
* [[Scarlet fever]]

==Diagnostic approach==
The causes of a rash are extremely broad, which may make the evaluation of a rash extremely difficult. An accurate evaluation by a provider may only be made in the context of a thorough history (What medication is the patient taking? What is the patient's occupation? Where has the patient been?) and complete physical examination.

Points to note in the examination include:
* The appearance: e.g., [[purpura|purpuric]] (typical of [[vasculitis]] and [[meningococcal disease]]), fine and like sandpaper (typical of [[scarlet fever]]); circular lesions with a central depression are typical of [[molluscum contagiosum]] (and in the past, [[small pox]]); plaques with silver scales are typical of [[psoriasis]].
* The distribution: e.g., the rash of [[scarlet fever]] becomes confluent and forms bright red lines in the skin creases of the neck, armpits and groins ([[Pastia's lines]]); the [[vesicle (dermatology)|vesicle]]s of [[chicken pox]] seem to follow the hollows of the body (they are more prominent along the depression of the spine on the back and in the hollows of both shoulder blades); very few rashes affect the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (secondary [[syphilis]], [[rickettsia]] or [[spotted fever]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Boyd MA, Menon P, Graves S, Gordon DL|title=A febrile illness with generalized papular rash involving the palms and soles|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=44|issue=5|pages=704, 755â€“6|year=2007|pmid=17278064|doi=10.1086/511637}} <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AA+febrile+illness+with+generalized+papular+rash+involving+the+palms+and+soles&as_publication=Clin+Infect+Dis&as_ylo=2007&as_yhi=2007&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup></ref> [[guttate psoriasis]], [[hand, foot and mouth disease]], [[keratoderma blenorrhagica]]);
* Symmetry: e.g., [[herpes zoster]] usually only affects one side of the body and does not cross the midline.

==Treatment==
Treatment differs according to what rash a patient has been diagnosed with. Common rashes can be easily remedied using steroid topical creams (such as [[hydrocortisone]]) or non-steroidal treatments. Many of the medications are available over the counter in the United States.

The problem with steroid topical creams i.e. hydrocortisone; is their inability to penetrate the skin through absorption and therefore not be effective in clearing up the affected area, thus rendering the hydrocortisone almost completely ineffective in but almost the most mild of cases.
