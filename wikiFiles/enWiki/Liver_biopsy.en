'''Liver biopsy''' is the [[biopsy]] (removal of a small sample of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]) from the [[liver]]. It is a [[medical test]] that is done to aid [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[liver disease]], to assess the severity of known liver disease, and to monitor the progress of treatment.<ref name=GrantNeuberger>{{cite journal |author=Grant A, Neuberger J |title=Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice |journal=Gut |volume=45 |issue= Suppl 4|pages=IV1–IV11 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10485854 |pmc=1766696 |doi= 10.1136/gut.45.2008.iv1|url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/45/suppl_4/IV1}}</ref>

==History==
The first liver aspirate was performed by the [[Germany|German]] physician [[Paul Ehrlich]] in 1883. Percutaneous liver biopsy was first reported in the 1920s.<ref name=GrantNeuberger/> The transjugular approach was pioneered by radiologist [[Charles Dotter]] in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM197308022890501 |author=Rösch J, Lakin PC, Antonovic R, Dotter CT |title=Transjugular approach to liver biopsy and transhepatic cholangiography |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=289 |issue=5 |pages=227–31 |year=1973 |month=August |pmid=4713761}}</ref>

==Types==
Liver biopsies may be taken [[percutaneous]]ly (via a needle through the [[skin]]), transvenously (through the [[blood vessel]]s) or directly during [[abdominal surgery]]. The sample is examined by [[microscopy|microscope]], and may be processed further by [[immunohistochemistry]], determination of [[iron]] and [[copper]] content, and [[microbiological culture]] if [[tuberculosis]] is suspected<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silva MA, Hegab B, Hyde C, Guo B, Buckels JA, Mirza DF |title=Needle track seeding following biopsy of liver lesions in the diagnosis of hepatocellular cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Gut |volume=57 |issue=11 |pages=1592–6 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18669577 |doi=10.1136/gut.2008.149062 |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/57/11/1592}}</ref>

==Indications==
Liver biopsy is often required for the diagnosis of a liver problem ([[jaundice]], abnormal blood tests) where [[blood test]]s, such as [[hepatitis A]] serology, have not been able to identify a cause. It is also required if hepatitis is possibly the result of [[medication]], but the exact nature of the reaction is unclear. [[Alcoholic liver disease]] and tuberculosis of the liver may be diagnosed through biopsy.<ref name=GrantNeuberger/> Direct biopsy of [[tumor]]s of the liver may aid the diagnosis, although this may be avoided if the source is clear (e.g. [[metastasis|spread]] from previously known [[colorectal cancer]]).<ref name=GrantNeuberger/>

If the diagnosis is already clear, such as chronic [[hepatitis B]] or [[hepatitis C]], liver biopsy is useful to assess the severity of the associated liver damage. The same is true for [[haemochromatosis]] (iron overload), although it is frequently omitted. [[Primary biliary cirrhosis]] and [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] may require biopsy, although other diagnostic modalities have made this less necessary.<ref name=GrantNeuberger/>

Occasionally, liver biopsy is required to monitor the progress of treatment, such as in chronic viral hepatitis.<ref name=GrantNeuberger/>

==Value and limitations==
For the last century liver biopsy has been considered as the gold standard for assessing the stage and the grade of chronic liver disease. Consensus conference statements recommended liver biopsy in the management of almost all patients with hepatitis C and B.

Liver biopsy is generally a safe procedure, but it is invasive. Complications of liver biopsy are rare but potentially lethal.<ref name=Emed>{{EMedicine|article|185230|Diagnostic Liver Biopsy}}</ref> The majority of complications (60%) occur within two hours, and 96% occur within 24 hours following the procedure.<ref name=Emed/> Approximately 2–3% of patients undergoing liver biopsy require hospitalization for the management of an adverse event.<ref name="pmid8416324">{{cite journal|author= Janes and Lindor |title= Outcome of patients hospitalized for complications after outpatient liver biopsy|first2= KD|last2= Lindor|last=Janes|journal= Ann Intern Med |volume=118|issue=2 |pages=96–8 |year=1993|pmid= 8416324}}</ref><ref name="pmid9581674">{{cite journal|author= Pasha |title= Cost-effectiveness of ultrasound-guided liver biopsy|first5= KD|last5= Lindor|first4= ER|last4= Dickson|first3= T|last3= Therneau|first2= S|last2= Gabriel|last=Pash|journal= Hepatology|volume=27|issue=5 |pages=1220–6 |year=1998|pmid= 9581674 |doi=10.1002/hep.510270506|display-authors= 1}}</ref> Thirty percent of patients experience significant pain during the procedure.

It often stops on its own, but if it persists, a blood transfusion may be needed. Surgery or angiography (a procedure in which the bleeding site is identified and treated) may be required if the bleeding is severe or does not stop on its own. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage is the most serious consequence of bleeding. Fatal complications have been reported in up to 0.01–0.3% of biopsied patients.<ref name="pmid7698705" /><ref name="pmid17051446">{{cite journal|author= Strassburg and Manns |title= Approaches to liver biopsy techniques-revisited|first2= MP|last2= Manns|last=Strassburg|journal= Semin Liver Dis |volume=26|issue=4 |pages=318–27 |year=2006|pmid= 17051446 |doi=10.1055/s-2006-951599}}</ref><ref name="pmid8344104">{{cite journal|author= Froehlich |title= Practice and complications of liver biopsy.

Biopsy results show significant variability (up to 40% for fibrosis diagnosis) which can lead to a wrong diagnosis. The result depends on the representativity of the punctured sample.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Regev A |title=Sampling error and intraobserver variation in liver biopsy in patients with chronic HCV infection |journal=Am.

Only 5% of patients at risk of fibrosis have liver biopsy. In 2002, the consensus conferences in France and in the USA raised the possibility of treating patients with chronic hepatitis without liver biopsy.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Consensus conference. Treatment of hepatitis C |journal=Gastroenterol. Clin. Biol. |volume=26 |issue=Spec No 2 |pages=B303–20 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=12180305 |author1=Agence Nationale d'Accréditation et d'Evaluation en Santé (ANAES) }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Recommendations from the National Institutes of Health consensus development conference statement: management of hepatitis C: 2002 |journal=Hepatology |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=1039 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12395309 |doi=10.1002/hep.510360502 |author1=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.> }}</ref> These conferences also underlined the necessity of developing reliable non-invasive tests that might be an alternative to liver biopsy both in hepatitis B and C.

Liver biopsy will likely remain particularly important in the diagnosis of unexplained liver disease. Non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis in alcoholic, nonalcoholic and viral liver diseases are likely to become more widely used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Manning DS, Afdhal NH |title=Diagnosis and quantitation of fibrosis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=134 |issue=6 |pages=1670–81 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18471546 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2008.03.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016-5085(08)00425-3}}</ref>

==Non-invasive alternatives==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2009}}
[[FibroTest]] (FibroSure in the USA) and FibroMax are non-invasive tests using a blood sample and an algorithm. The test results correspond to stages F0-F4 and grades A0-A3 of the METAVIR scoring system.<ref>http://www.oneliver.com/scientific-publications.html</ref> In 2007 FibroTest was validated by French Health Authorities as a first-line diagnosis of liver injury before biopsy. It was recommended to be a better predictor than biopsy staging for hepatitis C complications and death.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poynard T |title=Overview of the diagnostic value of biochemical markers of liver fibrosis (FibroTest, HCV FibroSure) and necrosis (ActiTest) in patients with chronic hepatitis C |journal=Comp Hepatol |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=8 |year=2004 |month= |pmid=15387887 |pmc=522750 |doi=10.1186/1476-5926-3-8 |url=http://www.comparative-hepatology.com/content/3/1/8 |author-separator=, |author2=Imbert-Bismut F |author3=Munteanu M |display-authors=3 |last4=Messous |first4=Djamila |last5=Myers |first5=Robert P |last6=Thabut |first6=Dominique |last7=Ratziu |first7=Vlad |last8=Mercadier |first8=Anne |last9=Benhamou |first9=Yves}}</ref>

FibroScan is a type of [[ultrasound machine]] that uses transient elastography to measure liver stiffness. Its diagnostic performance for fibrosis is similar to that of methods based on serologic markers. Combined use of Fibroscan and Fibrotest could avoid a liver biopsy in most patients with chronic hepatitis C.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Castéra L |title=Prospective comparison of transient elastography, Fibrotest, APRI, and liver biopsy for the assessment of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=343–50 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15685546 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508504020293 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2004.11.018 |author-separator=, |author2=Vergniol J |author3=Foucher J |display-authors=3 |last4=Le Bail |first4=Brigitte |last5=Chanteloup |first5=Elise |last6=Haaser |first6=Maud |last7=Darriet |first7=Monique |last8=Couzigou |first8=Patrice |last9=De Lédinghen |first9=Victor}}</ref>  Other ultrasonic techniques used to characterize liver stiffness include [[Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yoneda M, Suzuki K, Kato S, ''et al.'' |title=Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: US-based acoustic radiation force impulse elastography |journal=Radiology |volume=256 |issue=2 |pages=640–7 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20529989 |doi=10.1148/radiol.10091662 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=20529989}}</ref>

APRI is a quick serum biomarker for fibrosis assessment from Italy. This simple index is made up of routine laboratory tests. The test has not been validated by Health Authorities. 50% of the results are unclassifiable. APRI may be useful for excluding significant fibrosis in hepatitis C.

Hepascore is an Australian blood test combining the following clinical and laboratory variables: age, gender, bilirubin, GGT, hyaluronic acid, alpha 2 macroglobin to create a score. The test has very few validations.
