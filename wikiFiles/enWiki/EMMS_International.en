'''EMMS International''' is a [[non-denominational christian]] [[Non-governmental organization|Non-governmental Organization (NGO)]] that provides medical aid to countries around the world and operates field offices in the UK, Malawi, India, Israel, and Nepal.  Based in Scotland, its vision is “health for today, hope for tomorrow.”<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|title=EMMS International - Vision, mission, and core values {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/about-us/vision-mission-values|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref>

==Introduction==
In 1841, the The [[Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society]] International (EMMS) was founded as the Edinburgh Association for Sending Medical Aid to Foreign Countries.<ref name="EMMS Origins">{{cite web|title=The EMMS International - Origins and Background {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/about-us/origins-and-background|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> In 1843, it was renamed as The Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society.<ref name="EMMS Origins" /> In 2002, the organization split into two charities: the EMMS International and the Nazareth Trust<ref name="EMMS Origins" /> which is related to [[the Nazareth Hospital]] founded by EMMS missionary [[Kaloost Vartan]]. In 2010, the EMMS International supported 35 hospitals, clinics, and health projects.<ref name=autogenerated7 />   It specializes in the funding of construction of facilities, new equipment, staff training, and community health initiatives.<ref name="Cooney Email">{{cite web|last=Cooney|first=Joe|title=Personal Communication|publisher=The EMMS International|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> In Malawi, it supporst eight projects, including four hospitals, one college of nursing, one maternity unit, and two clinics.<ref name="Malawi EMMS" />  In 2011, the overall income of the organization was £818,394 and the expenditures were £945,327.<ref name="Impact Report 2012" /> 
	The values that EMMS International seeks to express are faithfulness, empowerment, encouragement, and accountability.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Its core values are derived from the Presbyterian Christian faith.<ref name=autogenerated3 />  The members of the organization are acting as a response to their religious belief in Jesus Christ and God.  Through prayer and donations, the organization declares that it strives to help and serve others.  This Christian calling is found in the posting of news items and blog posts on the EMMS International website that begin with phrases such as “Praise God” and “Pray.”<ref>{{cite web|title=EMMS International - Blogs {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/blogs|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref>

===Christian values===
	EMMS International’s Christian values are faithfulness, empowerment, encouragement, and accountability.<ref name=autogenerated3 />  It seeks to spread Christianity through medical mission to those in need and works with Christian organizations overseas in India, Nepal, and Malawi. However, it does not provide Christian literature to its overseas partners.<ref name="Cooney Email" />   In order to follow Christianity and keep Jesus Christ in focus, the EMMS asks for constant prayer for guidance and protection.  EMMS International states that “the importance of prayer to a missionary organization should never be under-estimated."<ref name=Prayer>{{cite web|title=EMMS International - Prayer {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/give/prayer|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> EMMS International suggests that members and people concerned with the success of the organisation pray on a daily basis.  There is an official EMMS International prayer that asks for a continued focus on Jesus Christ and the light that He is to the world.<ref name=Prayer />   The EMMS staff has weekly Bible meetings in which staff members read the Bible, pray, and meditate on the Bible.
	Three times per year, EMMS International publishes a new schedule of prayers in a unique prayer booklet.<ref name=Prayer /> This Prayer Focus booklet, gives weekly prayer suggestions or guidance for people who wish to pray for the organization.  The reader is asked to pray for the various staff, organization, and the relief of ailments.  For example, in the September–November 2012 booklet, a person is asked to pray during the week commencing 5 November for “the Lord to send the project Christian nurses and doctors who want to love and care for people with HIV and are willing to commit to serve with Jeevan Sahara Kendra."<ref name="Prayer Focus 2012">{{cite book|last=The EMMS|title=Prayer Focus Sept-Nov 2012|year=2012|publisher=The EMMS International|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|pages=6|url=http://www.emms.org/sites/default/files/Prayer%20Focus%20Sept-Nov12%20%282%29_0.pdf}}</ref>

===Educational Funding===
	EMMS international provides grants for individual student’s electives overseas.  Students can be in the medical, dental, nursing, or therapy fields.<ref name="Student Bursaries">{{cite web|title=Student Bursaries {{!}} The EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/our-work/issues/student-bursaries|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref>  Although these students do not have to be religiously affiliated, they are required to spend their elective time at a Christian mission hospital.<ref name="Student Bursaries" />  Eligibility for the grants requires that students currently be enrolled in a university or college in Scotland, Northern Ireland or a Third World country.<ref name="Student Bursaries" />  The EMMS provides on average £200-300 for this grant.<ref name="Student Bursaries" />  Therefore, it is meant to serve as a supplement rather than as a scholarship.

The EMMS provides funding for staff training in its sponsored sites, but does not dictate exactly what must be taught.<ref name="Cooney Email" /> It leaves the contents and direction of the training up to the site.<ref name="Cooney Email" /> In this way, the site can utilize its local knowledge to focus its training on what is necessary for it to grow in its work.  Thus, the EMMS works to help both the brick-and-mortar construction of sites and the expertise of their workers.

==Scottish Origins==
	The origin of the EMMS can be traced to an American missionary, Dr. Peter Parker, who gave a lecture in Edinburgh that was attended by the EMMS founders.<ref name=Hokkanen>{{cite book|last=Hokkanen|first=Markku|title=Medicine and scottish missionairies in the northern malawi region|year=2007|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=0773453415|pages=103}}</ref>  In his lecture, Parker discussed his role as the first missionary doctor to China commissioned by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and described his involvement in the founding of the Medical Missionary Society in China in 1832.<ref name=Ross>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=A.|title=The scottish missionary doctor|year=1988|publisher=Parthenon Publishing Group|location=The influence of scottish  medicine|pages=91|editor=D.A. Dow}}</ref>  Inspired by Parker’s lecture, the EMMS was founded on November 30, 1841.<ref name="Real Dwight">{{cite book|last=Dwight|first=H.D.|title=Edinburgh Medical Mission Society|year=1904|publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Company|location=The Encyclopedia of Missions: Descriptive, Historical, Biographical, Statistical|pages=219–220|url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924029338187|coauthors=Tupper, H.A. & Bliss, E. M.}}</ref>   Its founders included Dr. John Abercombie who became the first president of the EMMS.<ref name=autogenerated10>{{cite book|last=Hokkanen|first=Markku|title=Medicine and scottish missionairies in the northern malawi region|year=2007|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=0773453415|pages=104}}</ref> The EMMS laid out two primary objectives. One objective was to train physicians to become medical missionaries.  The second objective was to change the churches’ view about medical missionaries and to convince them that these missions were crucial to their work serving God.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> 
	To meet these goals, the EMMS pursued several different approaches to medical missions in the UK as it developed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Last Name|first=First Name|title=Title|year=Year|publisher=Publisher|location=Location|isbn=ISBN|pages=Pages|url=URL}}</ref>   From 1841 to 1851, the EMMS largely funded special lectures on the topic of medical missionaries and how to serve people in need.<ref name="Real Dwight" />  The EMMS recorded these lectures and published them for wide consumption.   The organization also awarded prizes for the best-written essays on medical subjects.<ref name="Real Dwight" />  In 1851, the EMMS began giving pecuniary amounts of aid to students studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh.<ref name=Lowe>{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=J.|title=Medical missions: Their place and power|year=1895|publisher=Fleming H. Revell  Company|pages=206}}</ref> One of the founding directors of the EMMS, Dr. Handyside, established a medical mission dispensary to serve the Irish residing in Edinburgh upon the urging of Rev. P. McMenamy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=J.|title=Medical missions: Their place and power|year=1895|publisher=Fleming H. Revell  Company|pages=205}}</ref> While working with students as a director of the EMMS, Handyside realized that it could be beneficial to have a field location in which students could work with local residents.  To this end, he established the “Cowgate Medical Mission Dispensary” in an old whisky shop in Edinburgh, Scotland on May 15, 1858.<ref name=Lowe />  This dispensary was later transformed into the “Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society’s Training Institution” on November 18, 1861.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=J.|title=Medical missions: Their place and power|year=1895|publisher=Fleming H. Revell  Company|pages=210}}</ref>  The institute was located in one of the worst spots in the city of Edinburgh in order to serve those in dire need.  The institute coupled medical and missionary work into the future medical missionaries’ daily routines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hokkanen|first=Markku|title=Medicine and scottish missionairies in the northern malawi region|year=2007|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=0773453415|pages=104}} The success of the institute led the EMMS to branch out and create dispensaries in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Liverpool, London, and Manchester.{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=J.|title=Medical missions: Their place and power|year=1895|publisher=Fleming H. Revell  Company|pages=215}}</ref> The Livingston Memorial Medical Training Institute took the place of the Cowgate Medical Mission Dispensary on January 25, 1878.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowe|first=J.|title=Medical missions: Their place and power|year=1895|publisher=Fleming H. Revell  Company|pages=224}}</ref>
The EMMS expanded from its UK headquarters to serve people in need in other countries.  Its members went on to found several dispensaries and institutions throughout the world.  The EMMS’s overseas missionary work began in the Middle East and then spread to India and Malawi.  Each missionary operation was spearheaded by a primary doctor upon the urging of the EMMS.  Under the direction of the EMMS, Dr. Kaloot Vartan founded the Nazareth dispensary in 1861.<ref name="EMMS Origins" />  Later, the EMMS started a medical missionary dispensary in Damascus in 1885.<ref name="EMMS Origins" />   A larger hospital was formed under the name Queen Victoria in 1898.<ref name="EMMS Origins" />   In 1861, a colleague of Vartan, Dr. Colin Valentine, founded an Institution in Agra for doctor training.<ref name="EMMS Origins" />   In 1895, a graduate of the Edinburgh University, Dr. Neil MacVicar founded his own branch hospital at the Blantyre Mission in Malawi.<ref name=Ross />

==The EMMS in India==

===History of EMMS in India===
	A Scottish missionary doctor, Dr. Colin Valentine was sponsored by the EMMS to journey to India to provide aid in 1861.<ref name="EMMS Origins" />   There, he was faced with many regulations in place that provided obstacles for medical aid.<ref name="EMMS Origins" />  He helped men and women alike.  Through the Institution in Agra, he fortified the students’ studies that they were taking at the Government School of Agra.<ref name="EMMS Origins" />  Because this was successful, the students were provided with grants from the EMMS so that they could continue their work.  Their training proved to be instrumental in the success of Indian medical missionaries throughout the region. In 1884, the Institution in Agra expanded to provide scholarships to men and women alike who were interested in studying medicine at the institute.<ref name=Valentine>{{cite journal|last=Stinson|first=Mary H.|title=Work of the women physicians of asia|journal=Transactions of the Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania|year=1884|volume=XVI|pages=310|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mGHwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA310&dq=Institution+in+Agra+Dr.+valentine&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6C7NUMzNK6bV0QH0jYCgBw&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=agra&f=false|publisher=Collins}}</ref>

===History of EMMS in Nepal===
Until 1951, Nepal forbid any foreigners from entering its country.<ref name="Yale Nepal">{{cite web|title=Christianity in Nepal exhibit: Yale divinity school library|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/div/Nepal/Nepal2.htm|work=www.library.yale.edu|publisher=Yale divinity school|accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref>  Although visitors were allowed to enter the country, they were forbidden from engaging in Christian religious ceremonies and from converting others.  Their punishment was jail and deportation.<ref name="Yale Nepal" />    However, the government of Nepal invited a group of Christians in 1954 to Nepal in order to build a hospital in Tansen and provide clinics in the Kathmandu Valley.<ref name="Yale Nepal" />   After missionaries were allowed to enter, on March 5, 1954, eight missions located in India created an interdenominational mission to provide aid.<ref name="Yale Nepal" />   This mission was called the United Mission to Nepal.  Scottish missionaries were instrumental in the success of the United Mission to Nepal, given their background in the region, helping Nepali migrants in the Northeastern region of India since the 1800s.<ref name="Yale Nepal" />

Using the special funds portion of the EMMS’s contributions, the ISP also opened a general hospital that served rural villagers.<ref name="Surkhet Manager" />   According to the original plan, this hospital was later taken over by the government’s health system.<ref name="Surkhet Manager" />   

With the EMMS’s financial commitment, the ISP has specialized in pre- and post-natal care for mothers.<ref name="Surkhet Manager" />   According to Alan Barker, the ISP Programme Support manager, there has been an increase in the visits of mothers to health facilities for pre- and post-natal care.<ref name="Surkhet Manager" />   With the ISP available, mothers now give birth more frequently in the health clinic rather than at home without trained help.<ref name="Surkhet Manager" />  The ISP has expanded three rural projects in neighboring villages to serve women who are generally underserved.  In order to reach these locations, the ISP received funds for a 4-wheel drive vehicle to transport field staff to remote locations.<ref name="Surkhet Manager" />   The vehicle also enables the ISP to carry the patients and clients to and from the facilities.

==The EMMS in Malawi==

===History of EMMS in Malawi===
	The EMMS began its mission to Malawi with the passage of one of its students, Neil MacVicar, to set up the Blantyre Mission in 1895.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Ross|first=A.|title=The scottish missionary doctor|year=1988|publisher=Parthenon Publishing Group|location=The influence of scottish  medicine|pages=96|editor=D.A.

In fact, MacVicar wrote, “‘Perhaps the greatest practical development of the Victorian era, the development of modern nursing, without which neither surgery nor medicine could have achieved half their triumphs.’”<ref>{{cite book|last=Rennick|first=Agnes|title=Church and medicine: The role of medical missionaries in malawi 1875- 1914 (Doctoral dissertation)|year=2003|publisher=The University of Stirling|location=The stirling research repository|pages=179|url=https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/3188}}</ref>  Later, the Blantyre missionary wrote, “We notice over and over again how much more readily [Africans] will submit to take choloroform, for instance, if administered by one of the boys [African assistants], and they too can coax patients when all our efforts are of no avail.”<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite book|last=Rennick|first=Agnes|title=Church and medicine: The role of medical missionaries in malawi 1875- 1914 (Doctoral dissertation)|year=2003|publisher=The University of Stirling|location=The stirling research repository|pages=203|url=https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/3188}}</ref>  Nevertheless, these African assistants were not treated with the same respect as Europeans.<ref name=autogenerated5 />    MacVicar acknowledged that “In a civilized country it would be a grave error to encourage men to practice Medicine and Surgery in a fractional kind of way,” but that with such a limited number of doctors, it would be justified in an “uncivilized” country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rennick|first=Agnes|title=Church and medicine: The role of medical missionaries in malawi 1875- 1914 (Doctoral dissertation)|year=2003|publisher=The University of Stirling|location=The stirling research repository|pages=204|url=https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/3188}}</ref>

==Publications and Publicity==
	According to John Wilkinson, “from the beginning, the [EMMS] was very publicity-conscious."<ref name=Coogate>{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=John|title=The Coogate doctors: The history of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society , 1841-1991|year=1991|publisher=The Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|pages=65}}</ref>  In its first year, the EMMS published the “Annual Report,” which documents its history and activities.<ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=John|title=The Coogate doctors: The history of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society , 1841-1991|year=1991|publisher=The Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|pages=66}}</ref>  In order to further enhance the EMMS’s publicity, the EMMS began to produce a quarterly journal called the “Occasional Paper” beginning in January, 1854.<ref name=Coogate />  It was distributed free of charge until October 1961 when it was no longer financially viable.<ref name=Coogate />  In 1865, “The Medical Missionary Journal” was published concerning medical missionary news.<ref name=Coogate />  In 1871, the EMMS began producing the “Quarterly Papers” that cost one pound annually, but was mailed without charge.<ref name=autogenerated8 />  In 1966, the Annual Report and the Quarterly Papers were made into one journal called “The Healing Hand.” <ref name=autogenerated8 /> 
	To supplement its publications, the EMMS also drew the interest of the general public through its monthly prayer and lecture series held at No. 57 George Square and other locations.<ref name=autogenerated8 />  These prayer meetings served to reinforce the Christian values of the society and to provide insight from first-hand experience from those who served abroad.<ref name=Coogate />
	In addition to its formal publications, the EMMS maintains a website and blog to update readers on its accomplishments and to bring more support.<ref name="EMMS home">{{cite web|title=EMMS provides health and education in Malawi, India, Nepal {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS International|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>   The blog posts regularly begin with calls for praise and requests for prayer in the work of the EMMS.<ref name="EMMS Blog home">{{cite web|title=Blogs {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/blogs|work=http://www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS International|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>  The blog quotes Biblical passages, such as Ephesians 6:12, to explain the EMMS’s role as a Christian medical missionary organization .<ref name="EMMS Blog example">{{cite web|last=McDowell|first=Joan|title=Week commencing 8 october {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/news/blog/week-commencing-8-october|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS International|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>  Also, the EMMS produces an electronic booklet called, “Prayer Focus,” that guides the reader through different prayers for the various locations of the EMMS’s work.<ref name="Prayer Focus 2012" />

==Fundraising==
	Since 1992, the EMMS has been fundraising through bike rides in various countries.<ref name="Bike Ride EMMS">{{cite web|title=Ride a bike or do a trek {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/do-something/ride-bike|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS International|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>   The first bike ride that it sponsored took place in Israel with the Norwood Ravenswood Charity.<ref name="Bike Ride EMMS" />  This bike ride took riders from Dan to Beersheba.<ref name="Bike Ride EMMS" />  The EMMS believes that bike rides are one of the most opportune modes of fundraising because the participants can not only see the locations which will benefit from their fundraising, but also will have a “real challenge [to] the mind and body and [have] an unforgettable spiritual experience.”<ref name="Bike Ride EMMS" />  The EMMS believes that supporters will see the value of their contributions by visiting these site locations and seeing the effect of their funding efforts.  The EMMS tells its potential visitors that the bike treks are not a “holiday” and are actually very challenging.<ref name="Bike Ride EMMS" />  In addition to the bike rides, the EMMS suggests that anyone who wishes to donate can join a fundraiser that other organizations lead.  These "open challenges" come from organizations that the EMMS lists on its website that include Classic Tours, Discover Adventure, Travel2Give, and Different Travel.<ref name="Open Challenges EMMS">{{cite web|title=Open challenges {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/do-something/open-challenges|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS International|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>   
The EMMS requires participants to raise a certain number of pounds for each bike ride.  For example, for the 2013 “Cycle Malawi” bike ride, participants must raise at least 2,950 in order to join the trip.<ref name="Cycle Malawi EMMS">{{cite web|title=Cycle Malawi 2013 - "the warm heart of Africa" {{!}} EMMS|url=http://www.emms.org/do-something/ride-bike/next-bike-rides/cycle-malawi-2013-warm-heart-africa|work=www.emms.org|publisher=The EMMS International|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>   To ensure the safety of the riders, the EMMS requires them to get the proper vaccinations and health screenings needed for each region that they will visit.<ref name="Cycle Malawi EMMS" />  
In the past, the EMMS International did not limit its fundraising to only its own organization, but also helped fundraise for the Nazareth Trust until 2009.<ref name="Nazareth Trust Bike">{{cite web|title=Milestone bike ride in support of Nazareth hospital EMMS {{!}} The Nazareth trust|url=http://www.nazarethtrust.org/news/milestone-bike-ride-support-nazareth-hospital-emms|work=www.nazarethtrust.org|publisher=The Nazareth Trust|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>   In 2001 the EMMS split into two organizations: the EMMS International and the Nazareth Trust.<ref name="Nazareth Trust Bike" />  However, the EMMS International continued to support the Nazareth Trust through its bike rides until 2009.<ref name="Nazareth Trust Bike" />  The EMMS raised £340,000 since the split to fund the Nazareth Trust and help in its nurse training operations.<ref name="Nazareth Trust Bike" />
