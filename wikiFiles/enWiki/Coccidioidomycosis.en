''C. immitis'' resides in the [[soil]] in certain parts of the southwestern [[United States]], northern Mexico, and parts of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].<ref>http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/valley-fever/DS00695/DSECTION=all&METHOD=print</ref> It is dormant during long dry spells, then develops as a mold with long filaments that break off into airborne spores when the rains come. The spores, known as [[arthroconidia]], are swept into the air by disruption of the soil, such as during construction, farming, or an earthquake.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.277.11.904 |title=A coccidioidomycosis outbreak following the Northridge, Calif, earthquake |author=Schneider E, Hajjeh RA, Spiegel RA, et al. |journal=JAMA |year=1997 |volume=277 |issue=11 |pages=904–8 |pmid=9062329 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> 

Infection is caused by inhalation of the particles. The disease is not transmitted from person to person. The infection ordinarily resolves leaving the patient with a specific immunity to re-infection.<ref>http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Mycoses/Dimorphic_systemic/Coccidioidomycosis/</ref>''C. immitis'' is a dimorphic saprophytic organism that grows as a [[mycelium]] in the soil and produces a spherule form in the host organism.

==Epidemiology==
It is confined to western hemisphere between 40° N and 40° S. Dry soil, especially in [[Life Zone|Lower Sonaran Life Zone]] is supportive of organism's growth. In harmony with organism's life history, incidence increases with periods of dryness after rainy season.

Besides humans, dogs, and cats, the fungus can be shown to infect most mammals, "even if they do not get sick from it very often. Species in which Valley Fever has been found include:" Livestock such as cattle and horses; llamas; marine mammals, including sea otter; and zoo animals such as monkeys and apes, kangaroos, tigers, etc; and wildlife endemic to geographic area such as cougar, skunk, javelina.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valley Fever Center for Excellence: 	 Valley Fever in Other Animal Species|publisher=University of Arizona|url = http://www.vfce.arizona.edu/ValleyFeverInPets/VFID-other.aspx}}</ref>[[Image:Geographic Distribution of Coccidioidomycosis 02.png|thumb|350px|The geographic distribution of coccidioidomycosis.]]

===Incidence (North America)===
California state prisons, as far back as 1919, have been particularly affected by Coccidioidomycosis. In 2005 and 2006, the [[Pleasant Valley State Prison]] near [[Coalinga]] and [[Avenal State Prison]] near [[Avenal]] on the western side of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] had the highest incidence in 2005, of at least 3,000 per 100,000.<ref>http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1196/annals.1406.011</ref>

Incidence varies widely across the west and southwest. In Arizona, for instance, in 2007, there were 3,450 cases in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], which in 2007 had an estimated population of 3,880,181<ref>[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04/04013.html  U.S. Census Bureau, State & County QuickFacts]</ref> for an incidence of approximately 1 in 1,125.<ref name="azdhs.gov">http://www.azdhs.gov/phs/oids/pdf/countycases2007.pdf</ref> In contrast, though southern New Mexico is considered an endemic region, there were 35 cases in the entire state in 2008, and 23 in 2007,<ref name="azdhs.gov"/> in a region that had an estimated 2008 population of 1,984,356<ref>New Mexico Intercensal Population Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau [http://bber.unm.edu/demo/nm2000s.htm]</ref> for an incidence of approximately 1 in 56,695. 

There was an epidemic in the summer of 2001 in Colorado, away from where the endemic is persistent. A group of archeologists visited [[Dinosaur National Monument]], and eight members of the crew, along with two National Park Service workers were diagnosed with valley fever.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5045a1.htm</ref>

Infection rates vary greatly by county, and although population density is important, so are other factors that have not been proven yet. Greater construction activity may disturb spores in the soil. In addition, the effect of altitude on fungi growth and morphology has not been studied, and altitude can range from sea level to 10,000 feet or higher across California, Arizona, Texas and New Mexico.

In California from 2000 to 2007, there were 16,970 reported cases (5.9 per 100,000 people) and 752 deaths (0.26 per 100,000 people) with the highest incidence in the San Joaquin Valley (44.1 per 100,000).<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5805a1.htm Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 58;5 105-109]</ref>  Following the [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge Earthquake]], there was a sudden increase of cases in the areas affected by the quake, at a pace of over 10 times baseline.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Pathogenesis==
[[File:Life cycle of coccidioides.svg|thumb|Life cycle of coccidioides]] In soil (and also in agar media), ''coccidioides''  exists in filament form. It forms hyphae in horizontal and vertical direction. With time, cells within [[hyphae]] degenerate to form alternating barrel shaped cells ([[arthroconidia]]). Arthroconidia are lightweight and carried by air currents. They can be easily inhaled without the person knowing. On arriving in alveoli, they enlarge in size and internal septations are developed. This structure is called '''spherule'''. Septations develop to form [[endospores]]. Rupture of spherules release these endospores; which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection locally. [[Granulomas|Nodules]] can form in lungs surrounding these spherules. When these rupture, they release their contents into bronchus, forming thin-walled cavities. These cavities can result in symptoms like [[Pleurisy|characteristic chest pain]], [[hemoptysis]] and persistent cough. In immunocompromised individuals, infection spreads [[fungemia|through blood]].

==Presentation==
Symptomatic infection (40% of cases) usually presents as an [[influenza]]-like illness with fever, cough, headaches, [[rash]], [[myalgia]] (muscle pain), [[arthralgia]] (joint pain).<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | pages = 680–83 | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> The rash is maculopapular. [[Erythema nodosum]] on lower extremities, and [[erythema multiforme]] in necklace-like fashion can occur predominantly in women.

Some patients fail to recover and develop chronic pulmonary infection or widespread disseminated infection (affecting [[meninges]], soft tissues, joints, and bone). Severe pulmonary disease may develop in [[HIV]]-infected persons.<ref name=Ampel_2005>{{cite journal | author = Ampel N | title = Coccidioidomycosis in persons infected with HIV type 1 | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 1174–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16163637 | doi = 10.1086/444502}}</ref>

In order of decreasing risk, people of Filipino, African, Native American, Hispanic, and Asian descent are susceptible to the disseminated form of the disease.<ref>http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec14/ch180/ch180f.html</ref> [[Immunocompromised]] individuals are more susceptible to the disease.

== Types ==
Coccidioidomycosis may be divided into the following types:<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|pages=}}</ref>
:* [[Primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis]]
:* [[Disseminated coccidioidomycosis]]
:* [[Primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis]]

==Diagnosis==
The fungal infection can be demonstrated by microscopic detection of diagnostic cells in body fluids, exudates, [[sputum]] and [[biopsy]]-tissue by methods of Papanicolaou or Gomori's methenamine silver staining. These stains can demonstrate spherules and surrounding inflammation.

With specific [[nucleotide]] primers ''C.immitis'' [[DNA]] can be amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]. It can also be detected in culture by morphological identification or by using molecular probes that hybridize with ''C.immitis'' [[RNA]]. ''C. immitis'' and ''C. posadasii'' cannot be distinguished on cytology or by symptoms; but only by DNA PCR. 

An indirect demonstration of fungal infection can be achieved also by serologic analysis detecting fungal [[antigen]] or host [[IgM]] or [[IgG]] [[antibody]] produced against the fungus. The available tests include the tube-precipitin (TP) assays, [[Complement fixation test|complement fixation assays]], and [[ELISA|enzyme immunoassays]]. TP antibody is not found in [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]]. TP antibody is [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] and is used as confirmatory test, while ELISA is [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]] and thus used for [[Screening (medicine)|screening]].

Chest X-Ray usually shows nodules in upper lobes of lung, usually less than 4&nbsp;cm in diameter. They rarely calcify.

If meninges are affected, CSF will show hypoglycorrhachia (abnormally low glucose levels in CSF) , decreased proteins and lymphatic [[pleocytosis]]. Rarely, CSF eosinophilia is present.

The disease is commonly misdiagnosed as [[community acquired pneumonia]] and sometimes as cancer.<ref name=Chen_1993>{{cite journal | author = Chen, Karl T. K. | title = Cytodiagnostic pitfalls in pulmonary coccidioidomycosis | journal = Diagn Cytopathol | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–180 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.1002/dc.2840120220 | pmid = 7774502}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There are no published prospective studies that examine optimal antifungal therapy for coccidioidomycosis. Mild cases often do not require treatment. Oral [[Fluconazole]] and [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[Amphotericin B]] are used in progressive or disseminated disease, or in which patients are immunocompromised. Alternatively, [[itraconazole]] or [[ketoconazole]] may be used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barron MA and Madinger NE |title=Opportunistic Fungal Infections, Part 3: Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, and Emerging Mould Infections|journal=Infections in Medicine |date=November 18, 2008 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/infection/article/1145625/1404367}}</ref> Fluconazole is preferred drug for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. [[Intrathecal]] or [[Ventricular system|intraventricular]] Amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. Itraconazole is used for infection involving bones and joints.

[[Posaconazole]] and [[voriconazole]] have also been used. There is currently no practical preventative measures available for people who live or travel through Valley Fever endemic areas. It is recommended to avoid airborne dust or dirt, though this is not a guaranteed manner of prevention. People in certain occupations may be advised to wear face masks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Risk factors|url=http://www.vfce.arizona.edu/ValleyFeverInPeople/RiskFactors.aspx|publisher=Valley Fever Center for Excellence}}</ref>

==Complications==
Serious complications include severe [[pneumonia]], lung [[granuloma|nodule]]s, and disseminated disease, where the fungus spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of valley fever can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, [[abscess]]es, bone lesions, severe joint pain, heart inflammation, [[urinary tract]] problems, [[meningitis]], and often death.

==Biological warfare==
''C. immitis'' was investigated by the United States during the 1950s and 1960s as a potential biological weapon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Cash strain received the military symbol OC, and original hopes were for its use as an incapacitant. As medical epidemiology later made clear, OC would have lethal effects on several segments of the population, so it was later considered a lethal agent. It was never standardized, and beyond a few field trials, it was never weaponized.  Most military work on OC was on vaccines by the mid-1960s. It is still on the CDC's list of [[select agent]]s however.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/docs/salist.pdf</ref>
