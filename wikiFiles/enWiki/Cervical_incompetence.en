'''Cervical incompetence''' is a medical condition in which a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman's [[cervix]] begins to [[cervical dilation|dilate]] (widen) and [[effacement|efface]] (thin) before her pregnancy has reached term. Internal os opening more than 1 cm is abnormal and cervical length less than 2 cm is considered diagnostic.  Cervical incompetence may cause [[miscarriage]] or [[preterm birth]] during the second and third trimesters.

In a woman with cervical incompetence, dilation and effacement of the cervix may occur without pain or [[uterine contraction]]s. In a normal pregnancy, dilation and effacement occurs in response to uterine contractions. Cervical incompetence occurs because of weakness of the cervix, which is made to open by the growing pressure in the uterus as pregnancy progresses. If the responses are not halted, rupture of the membranes and birth of a premature baby can result.

According to statistics provided by the [[Mayo Clinic]], cervical incompetence is relatively rare in the United States, occurring in only 1–2% of all pregnancies, but it is thought to cause as many as 20—25% of miscarriages in the second trimester.

The condition can be diagnosed with a [[hysterosalpingogram]] or pediatric [[Foley catheter]].

* diagnosis of cervical incompetence in a previous pregnancy,
* previous preterm premature rupture of membranes,
* history of [[conization]] (cervical biopsy),
* [[diethylstilbestrol]] exposure, which can cause anatomical defects, and
* uterine anomalies.

Repeated procedures (such as mechanical dilation, especially during late pregnancy) appear to create a risk.<ref>{{cite web |date= 2012-03-03 |title =Cervical Incompetence – Protocol for Management |url= http://obgyn.unm.edu/MFM/protocols/41.pdf |work= PROTOCOL #41 |publisher= Maternal Fetal Medicine, [[University of New Mexico]]}}</ref>  Additionally, any significant [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to the cervix can weaken the tissues involved.

==Treatment==
Cervical incompetence is not generally treated except when it appears to threaten a pregnancy.  Cervical incompetence can be treated using [[cervical cerclage]], a [[surgical]] technique that reinforces the cervical muscle by placing [[surgical suture|suture]]s above the opening of the cervix to narrow the [[cervical canal]].

Cerclage procedures usually entail closing the cervix through the [[vagina]] with the aid of a [[Speculum (medical)|speculum]]. Another approach involves performing the cerclage through an abdominal incision. Transabdominal cerclage of the cervix makes it possible to place the stitch exactly at the level that is needed. It can be carried out when the cervix is very short, effaced or totally distorted. Cerclages are usually performed between weeks 14 and 16 of the pregnancy. The sutures are removed between weeks 36 and 38 to avoid problems during labor. 
The complications described in the literature have been rare: [[hemorrhage]] from damage to the veins at the time of the procedure; and [[fetal death]] due to uterine vessels occlusion.

No significant differences in pregnancy outcomes  were found in the study<ref>{{cite journal|last=Armarnik|first=S|coauthors=Sheiner, E, Piura, B, Meirovitz, M, Zlotnik, A, Levy, A|title=Obstetric outcome following cervical conization.|journal=Archives of gynecology and obstetrics|date=2011 Apr|volume=283|issue=4|pages=765–9|pmid=21327802}}</ref> where performing cerclage was compared to not having it performed. As cerclage can induce preterm contractions without preventing premature delivery,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zeisler|first=H|coauthors=Joura, EA, Bancher-Todesca, D, Hanzal, E, Gitsch, G|title=Prophylactic cerclage in pregnancy.
