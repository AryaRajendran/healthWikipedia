==Introduction==
'''Agitoxin''' is a [[toxin]] found in the [[venom]] of the scorpion ''[[Deathstalker|Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus]]'' (yellow scorpion). Other [[toxins]] found in this species include [[charybdotoxin]] (CTX). CTX is a close homologue of Agitoxin. <ref>{{cite pmid|1720574}} </ref>

Agitoxin can be purified using [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] techniques. 

'''Primary structure:'''

Three types of agitoxin can be distinguished, each identified as comprising 38 [[amino acid]]s. They are highly homologous, differing only in the identity of the residues at positions 7, 15, 29 and 31.

'''Secondary and tertiary structure:'''

Agitoxin consists of a triple-stranded antiparallel [[Beta sheet|beta-sheet]] in which the C-terminal strand sits in the centre of the sheet, and a single [[alpha-helix]] covering one face of the beta-sheet (see image on the right). The [[cysteine|cysteine side chains]] connect the beta-sheet and the helix via [[disulphide bonds]] to form the core of the molecule. 

The fold of agitoxin is homologous to the previously determined folds of scorpion venom toxins, classified as 'Scorpion short toxins' by [[Pfam]].
This fold, and the location of the disulphide bonds, are a shared element between toxins stemming from arthropods. The structure of agitoxin-2, has been determined by NMR. <ref name="struct"></ref>

==Function==
Agitoxin binds to the [[shaker gene|Shaker]] ''K''<sup>+</sup> channel in ''[[Drosophila]]'' as well as to its mammalian homologue. It blocks this channel by binding with high affinity (''K''<sub>d</sub>&nbsp;< 1&nbsp;[[nanomole|nmol]]/[[liter|L]]) to its external vestibule. 

This high affinity to the ‘Shaker K’ channel is dependent on the residues of Arg <sup>24</sup>, Lys <sup>27</sup>, and Arg <sup>31</sup>. <ref name="struct"></ref> The ability of the agitoxin to block the ‘Shaker K’ channel suggests a docking mechanism whereby the toxin sits on the channel and then prevents its opening through flexible movements of the side chains thereby allowing for various protein-protein complexes to be enacted. <ref>{{cite pmid|12414693}}</ref> AgTx2 has been found to undergo conformational changes when bound to the ‘Shaker K’ channel which suggests the [[induced fit]] model may be present in toxin-channel interaction. This mode of interaction goes along with and explains the flexible side chains. <ref>{{cite pmid|12414963}} </ref> The [[amino acid]] make up of the toxin determines the way each interacts with [[Shaker]] K channels. <ref name="struct"></ref> 

In Agitoxin, for example, the arginine interacts electrostatically with the aspartate of the ‘Shaker K’ channel. <ref name="struct"></ref> The final blocking of the pore in the Shaker K + channel occurs via the side chain of Lys <sup>27</sup>.  <ref>{{cite pmid|12414693}} </ref> Lys <sup> 27</sup> interacts with the Shaker K by plugging the selectivity filter and hydrogen bonding with carbonyls of Tyr <sup>395</sup> of each potassium channel subunit. <ref>{{cite pmid|12833539}} </ref> Important stabilizing hydrogen bonding between various residues on the AgTx2 and the subunits of the channel hold the toxin-channel complex together. Mutations in Arg24Ala, Lys27Met, and Asn30Ala increased the dissociation, or break-down, of the complex, suggesting they all play important roles in holding the toxin on the channel.<ref>{{cite pmid|12833539}} </ref>
