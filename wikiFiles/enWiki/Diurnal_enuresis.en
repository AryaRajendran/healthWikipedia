[[Enuresis]] is defined as involuntary voiding of urine beyond the age of anticipated control.  '''Diurnal enuresis''' is '''daytime wetting''', [[nocturnal enuresis]] is nighttime wetting.  Both of these conditions can occur at the same time, however, many children with [[bedwetting|nighttime wetting]] will not have wetting during the day. Children with daytime wetting may have frequent [[urination]], have [[Urinary urgency|urgent]] urination or dribble after urinating.   
==Statistics==
Daytime wetting is more common in girls than in boys, but [[bedwetting]] is three times as prevalent in boys (i.e., around 75% of sufferers are male).  At the age of 7 approximately 3% of girls and 2% of boys experience functional daytime wetting at least once a week.<ref>"http://www.eric.org.uk/DaytimeWetting/info_daytime_wetting_professionals"</ref>

==Causes for daytime wetting==
Common causes include, but not limited to:
*Incomplete emptying of the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] 
*Irritable [[urinary bladder|bladder]]
*[[Constipation]]
*Stress
*Urinary tract infection
*[[Urinary urgency|Urgency]] (not “making it” to the bathroom in time)
*Anatomic abnormality
*Poor toileting habits
*Small [[urinary bladder|bladder]] capacity
*Medical conditions like overactive bladder disorder 
*Excessive tickling
*[[PANDAS]]

==Managing daytime wetting==
Major changes in the management of daytime wetting came about in the 1990s.  In most current programs, non-invasive treatments incorporate hydration, timed voiding, correction of [[constipation]] and in some cases, computer assisted pelvic floor retraining.  These methods have been extremely successful in correcting daytime wetting. [[urinary bladder|Bladder]] stretching exercises (where the person tries to hold their urine as long as possible) are no longer recommended.  In fact, some urologists actually believe that this can be dangerous because the person could develop the long-term habit of tightening the [[urethral sphincter]] muscle, which can cause [[urinary bladder|bladder]] or [[kidney]] problems.  [[Urinating]] on a regular basis is much preferred.

Ruling out infections can also be a part of the differential.<ref name="pmid10845137">{{cite journal |author=Bernard-Bonnin AC |title=Diurnal enuresis in childhood |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=46 |issue= |pages=1109–15 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=10845137 |pmc=2144882 |doi= |url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10845137}}</ref>
