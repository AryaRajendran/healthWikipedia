'''Carl Ernst Bock''' (February 21, 1809 – February 19, 1874) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physician]] and [[anatomist]].

Born in [[Leipzig]] to anatomist Carl August Bock, he studied at the [[University of Leipzig]], from which he graduated in 1831. During the [[November Uprising]] in [[Poland]], he served as a hospital physician for both the Polish and Russian armies. On returning to Leipzig in 1832 he became a private lecturer, and in 1837 was appointed to preside over [[autopsy|autopsies]] at Leipzig's hospital. In 1839 he was appointed extraordinary professor of pathological anatomy, and in 1850 became head of the university's clinical department.

In addition to his writings on anatomical and surgical matters, in his later years Bock wrote numerous essays and books on public health. These were written in clear and strident language and addressed to a popular audience, roughly in the style of [[Ernst Keil]]'s ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', and so gained him a good deal of public recognition and influence.
