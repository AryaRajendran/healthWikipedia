An '''upper motor neuron lesion''' (also known as '''pyramidal insufficiency''') is a [[lesion]] of the neural pathway above the [[anterior horn of spinal cord|anterior horn cell]] of the spinal cord or [[motor nuclei]] of the [[cranial nerves]]. This is in contrast to a [[lower motor neuron lesion]], which affects nerve fibers traveling from the anterior horn of the [[spinal cord]] to the relevant muscle(s).<ref name="Fix2007">{{cite book|author=James D.

Upper motor neuron lesions occur in conditions affecting motor neurons in the brain or spinal cord such as [[stroke]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[traumatic brain injury]] and [[cerebral palsy]].

== Symptoms ==

Changes in muscle performance can be broadly described as the Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome. These changes vary depending on the site and the extent of the lesion, and may include:

* Muscle weakness. A pattern of weakness in the [[flexors]] ([[lower limbs]]) or [[extensors]] ([[upper limbs]]),<ref>{{GPnotebook|-261423104}}</ref> is known as 'pyramidal weakness'
* Decreased control of active movement, particularly slowness
* [[Spasticity]], a velocity-dependent change in muscle tone
* [[Clasp-knife response]] where initial higher resistance to movement is followed by a lesser resistance
* [[Babinski sign]] is present, where the [[big toe]] is raised (extended) rather than curled downwards (flexed) upon appropriate stimulation of the sole of the foot. The presence of the Babinski sign is an abnormal response in adulthood. Normally, during the plantar reflex, it causes plantar flexion and the adduction of the toes. In Babinski's sign, there is dorsiflexion of the big toe and abduction of the other toes. Physiologically, it is normally present in infants from birth to 12 months. The presence of the babinski sign after 12 months is the sign of a non-specific upper motor neuron lesion.
* increase [[deep tendon reflex]] (DTR)
* [[Pronator drift]] <ref name="urlThe Precise Neurological Exam">{{cite web |url=http://edinfo.med.nyu.edu/courseware/neurosurgery/motor.html |title=The Precise Neurological Exam |work= |accessdate=2009-11-28}}</ref>

==Corticospinal/pyramidal tract==

These are the neural tracts which descend in the spinal cord, in the lateral columns, carrying signals for voluntary movement of skeletal muscle.   These nerve fibers usually originate  in the [[primary motor cortex]], pass via the [[corona radiata]] to gather in the [[internal capsule]] before crossing over to the opposite side ([[decussation]]) in the [[medullary pyramids]] and proceeding down the spinal cord to meet [[lower motor neuron]]s in the [[Anterior horn of spinal cord|anterior horn]].
