'''Child [[human sexuality|sexuality]]''' is concerned with the [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[society|social]] influences upon the sexual development of [[child]]ren, and the range of [[sense|sensational]] [[emotion]]al and consequent [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]], which may occur before or during [[puberty]], but before full [[sexual maturity]] is established.

==History==

[[Human evolution]] of [[social system]]s seems to favor [[nurture kinship]] relations between adults and children, which implies cultures intended to protect children from harm.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding |first=Sarah|last=Blaffer Hrdy |isbn=9780674032996 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University|year=2009}}</ref> Cultures and religions codified these principles into rules in which children learn to control their natural [[Human physiology#System|bodily functions]] by publicly pleasing adults and privately exploring the world and testing the bounds of adult tolerance.<ref>{{cite book |title=Obedience to Authority|author=Stanley Milgram|year=1983|publisher=Harper|isbn=978-0061319839}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stamford Prison Experiment|url=http://www.prisonexp.org/|author=Philip G. Zimbardo|year=1971|accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref>

===Ancient cultures===
{{main|Pederasty}}
Adults are attracted to children in various ways. In some cultures, such as [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]], adults managed in a way that today would be considered [[child abuse]].

In the traditions of [[confucianism]], as in [[humanism]], sexual activity and sexual education are generally less regulated but often considered a private matter, so that discussing it may be 'very bad taste'.<ref>{{cite book|title=Confucius and Socrates: Teaching Wisdom|author=Sanderson Beck |publisher=World Peace Communications|year=2006|isbn=978-0976221081}}</ref> [[Confucius]] is said to have stated: "I have never seen one who loves virtue as much as he loves sex." [[Confucianism#The Analects (Lun Yu)|Confucius in 'Analects']]

===Christianity===
In [[Western Europe]], the predominant religion was [[Catholicism]], which was heavily influenced by [[Gnosticism]], and theologians such as Bishop [[Augustine of Hippo]] considered [[orgasm]] a sin. Later, theologians amplified this idea and in medieval times clerics were urged to interrogate the [[laity]] and if errant, castigate them by a regime of supervised [[penance]] and a diet of bread and [[holy water]] for weeks or months (in the sixth century, the Irish St. Columban issued penitence tables which prescribed 20 days).<ref name=Uta>{{cite book |title=Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven - the Catholic Church and Sexuality|author=Uta Ranke.Heinman|publisher=Penguin Books USA|year=1988|ISBN=0 385 26527 1}}</ref>

Within the wider [[Christianity#Major denominations within Christianity|Christian]] traditions, sex of any sort, except for the deliberate purpose of [[Fertilisation|conception]], was variously said by clerics to cause [[blindness]], [[deafness]] and [[mental confusion]], as well as (in Catholicism) eternal [[damnation]] of the sinner's soul if not fully [[Confession (religion)|'confessed']].<ref name=Uta />

===Islam===
{{main|Gender segregation and Islam}}
In [[Islam]], mixing between men and women is strongly discouraged, especially when in private. Although touching and kissing people beyond one's immediate family is not permissible, some socialization is encouraged so that men and women may come to know each other (Surah [[Al-Hujurat]]) as long as there is no obscenity, touching, secret meetings or flirting.<ref>[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/kotb2.htm Sexuality in Islam]</ref>

===Modern times===
Little is known of child sexuality before the [[Age of Enlightenment]], but it is presumed (considering the number of servants needed to run great households and the simple design of ordinary homes) that many children would have observed sexual activity as a frequent and natural phenomenon.<ref name=FMM>{{cite book |title=The Sexual life of Children|author=Floyd M. Martinson|year=1994|isbn=978-0897893763}}</ref> In the 19th century, with the arrival of industrialization and literacy, sexual repression appears to have become institutionalized and extra-marital activity generally criminalized<ref name=Uta/> to the point where newly married couples experienced difficulty in achieving [[consummation]] of their marriage.<ref name=Uta/>

===Freud===
Until [[Sigmund Freud]] published his ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' in 1905, children were often regarded as [[Asexuality|asexual]], having no sexuality until later development. Freud was one of the first researchers to seriously study child sexuality. While his ideas, such as [[psycho-sexual development]] and the [[Oedipus complex]], have been rejected, acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was a significant change.<ref name="Santrock"/> Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions&nbsp;–  they wonder where babies come from, they notice anatomical differences between males and females, and many engage in [[genital play]] or [[masturbation]]. Child sex play includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.<ref name="Santrock">Santrock, J.W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4''th''ed.).'' New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Sex play with others usually decreases as children go through their elementary school years, yet they still may possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, escalating in puberty (roughly the teenage years) when the main surge in sexual interest occurs.<ref name="Santrock"/>
{{main|Sexual revolution}}

===Contemporary situation===
In the latter part of the 20th century, sexual liberation probably arose within a massive cultural explosion in the United States of America known as [[Age of Aquarius]] following the upheaval of the [[Second World War]], and the vast quantity of audiovisual media distributed worldwide by the new electronic and information technology. Children are apt to gain access and be influenced by material, despite [[censorship]] and [[content-control software]].<ref>{{cite book |title=How Fantasy Becomes Reality: Seeing Through Media Influence|author=Karen Dill|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2009|isbn=978-0195372083}}</ref>

==Child sexualization in Western cultures==
Children can discover the pleasure of genital stimulation naturally at an early age.<ref name=SHP>{{cite book|title=Sexuality Today: The Human Perspective Edn 7|author=Garry Kelly|publisher=McGraw-Hill Tx USA|year=2003|isbn=978-0072558357}}</ref> Boys often lie on their stomachs and girls may sit and rock.<ref name=SHP /> Manual stimulation occurs about the time of [[adolescence]] and [[Non-penetrative sex#Mutual masturbation|mutual masturbation]] or other sexual experimentation between adolescents of similar ages may also occur,<ref name=SHP /> though cultural or religious coercion may inhibit or occult such activity if there is negative [[peer pressure]] or if [[Authority|authority figures]] are likely to disapprove.<ref name=SHP />

Some [[cultural critic]]s in the [[Western world]] have postulated that over recent decades, children have been subject to a premature [[sexualization]], as indicated by a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behavior inappropriate for their age group.<ref>{{cite web

When an adult or older adolescent has a sexual relationship with a child, it is considered to be a form of [[child abuse]] known as [[child sexual abuse]].<ref name=medline2008>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/childsexualabuse.html |title=Child Sexual Abuse |work=Medline Plus|date = 2008-04-02 |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine,}}</ref><ref name="APA Guidelines">{{cite journal |author= |title=Guidelines for psychological evaluations in child protection matters.

===Theories and research===
Research into [[Child_sexual_abuse#The_rise_of_public_concern|youthful sexuality]] has been largely conducted over the 20th century in the Western World and is mostly concerned with suppression for reasons of religion and/or fears about the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].<ref name=HSR>[http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy346K/Frohlich/Lectures/history%20of%20sex.ppt History of sexual research(PDF)]</ref>

====Freud and Kinsey====
[[Sigmund Freud]] in his 1905 work ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' outlined a theory of [[psycho-sexual development]] with five distinct phases: the ''oral stage'' (0&ndash;1.5 years), the ''anal stage'' (1.5&ndash;3.5 years), the ''phallic stage'' (3.5&ndash;6 years) which culminates in the resolution of the [[Oedipus complex]], [[latency stage|latency phase]] (6–12 years of age), and the ''genital'' (or adult) stage.

[[Alfred Kinsey]] in the [[Kinsey Reports]] (1948 and 1953) included research on the physical sexual response of children, including pre-pubescent children (though the main focus of the reports was adults). It has been stated that some of the data in his reports could not have been obtained without observation of or participation in [[child sexual abuse]], or through collaborations with child molesters,<ref>{{cite book|title=Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims: A Practical Guide|last=Salter, Ph.D.|first=Anna C.|year=1988|pages=22–24 |publisher=Sage Publications Inc |isbn= 0-8039-3182-4}}</ref> though this criticism in and of itself neither invalidates nor confirms Kinsey's findings, residing more in [[ad hominem]] territory. In 2000, Swedish researcher Ing-Beth Larsson noted, "It is quite common for references still to cite Alfred Kinsey", due to the scarcity of subsequent large-scale studies of child sexual behavior.<ref name="larsson">Larsson, IngBeth.

English translation (Lambert & Tudball) Article number 2001-123-20.</ref>

===Current methodology of study===
Empirical knowledge about child sexual behavior is not usually gathered by direct interviews of children, partly due to ethical consideration.<ref name="larsson" /> Information about child sexual behavior is gathered by the following methods:

*Observing children being treated for problematic behavior, such as use of force in sex play,<ref name="larsson_cite_gil">Gil & Cavanagh Johnson, 1993, op. cit.; Cavanagh Johnson, T., Feldmeth, J. R.

===Behavior===
As mentioned above, most published sexual research material emanates from the Western World, and a great deal of dramatic audio-visual material which might influence social attitudes to child sexuality are generated either in the United States of America or else for that audience. 'Normative' may therefore relate to [[Western culture]] rather than to the general complexity of human experience.<ref name=HSR />

====Normative and non-normative behaviors====
Although there are variations between individual children, children are generally curious about their bodies and those of others, and explore their bodies through [[Genital play|explorative sex play]].<ref>[http://parentkidsright.com/pt-sexplay.html SEX PLAY: parenting strategies by Dr. Marilyn Heins<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.ces.purdue.edu/providerparent/Health-Safety/WhenChildren'sPlay.htm PPP: Health and Safety || When Children's Play Involves Sexuality || Sex play is normal<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  [[Playing doctor]] is one example of such childhood exploration.   Such games are generally considered to be normal in young children.  Child sexuality is considered fundamentally different from adult sexual behavior, which is more goal-driven.  Among children, genital penetration and oral-genital contact are very uncommon,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friedrich WN, Fisher J, Broughton D, Houston M, Shafran CR |title=Normative sexual behavior in children: a contemporary sample |journal=Pediatrics |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=E9 |year=1998 |pmid=9521975|doi=10.1542/peds.101.4.e9}}</ref> and may be perceived as imitations of adult behaviors.<ref name="larsson_cite_larsson&svedin">Larsson & Svedin, 1999, op. cit.; Larsson & Svedin, publication data unavailable; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit.</ref> Such behaviors are more common among children who have been [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]].<ref name="larsson" />

A 1997 study based on limited variables found no correlation between early childhood (age 6 and under)  peer sexual play and later adjustment.<ref name=Okami>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00224499709551902 | last1 = Okami | first1 = Paul | last2 = Olmstead | first2 = Richard | last3 = Abramson | first3 = Paul R. | year = 1997 | title = Sexual experiences in early childhood: 18-year longitudinal data from the UCLA family lifestyles project - University of California, Los Angeles | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_n4_v34/ai_20536042/pg_1 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 339–347 }}</ref>  The study notes that its results do not demonstrate conclusively that no such correlation exists.<ref name="Okami"/>  The study also does not address the question of consequences of intense sexual experiences or aggressive or unwanted experiences.<ref name=Okami>(Okami, p. 9)</ref>

====Symptomatic behaviors====
Children who have been the victim of [[child sexual abuse]] sometimes display overly [[sexualization|sexualized behavior]],<ref name="larsson_cite_kendall">(Friedrich et al., 1992, 1993, op. cit.; Kendall-Tackett, K. E., Williams, L., Finkelhor, D. (1993). "The impact of sexual abuse on children: A review and synthesis of recent empirical studies". ''Psychological Bulletin'', 113:164 – 180.; Cosentino, C. E, Meyer-Mahlenburg, H., Alpert, J., Weinberg, S., Gaines, R. (1995). "Sexual behavior problems and psychopathology symptoms in sexually abused girls". ''Journal of American Academy Child & Adolescent Psychiatry'', 34, 8:1033–1042.; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit.</ref><ref name="larsson_cite_friedrich2">Friedrich et al. (1992), op. cit.; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit.</ref> which may be defined as expressed behavior that is non-normative for the culture. Typical symptomatic behaviors may include excessive or public [[masturbation]] and coercing, manipulating or tricking other children into non-consensual or unwanted [[sexual activities]], also referred to as "[[child-on-child sexual abuse]]". Sexualized behavior is thought to constitute the best indication that a child has been sexually abused.<ref name="larsson_cite_kendall" />

Children who exhibit sexualized behavior may also have other behavioral problems.<ref name="larsson_cite_friedrich2" /> Other symptoms of child sexual abuse may include manifestations of [[post-traumatic stress]] in younger children; fear, aggression, and nightmares in young school-age children; and depression in older children.<ref name="larsson_cite_kendall" />

====Normative behavior in Early childhood====
From the ages of three to seven, the following behaviors are normal among children:
*Children are curious about where babies come from.<ref name="pike">[http://muextension.missouri.edu/xplor/hesguide/humanrel/gh6002.htm GH6002 Sexuality and Your Child: For Children Ages 3 to 7, MU Extension<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*Children may explore other children's and adults' bodies out of curiosity.<ref name="pike" />
*By age four, children may show significant attachment to the opposite-sex parent.<ref name="pike" />
*Children begin to have a sense of learned modesty and of the differences between private and public behaviors.<ref name="pike" />
*For some children, genital touching increases, especially when they are tired or upset.<ref name="pike" />

====Normative behavior in early school age====
Early school age covers approximately ages five to seven, and masturbation is common at these ages.<ref name="pike" /><ref name="planned_parenthood_ohio" /> Children become more aware of gender differences, and tend to choose same-sex friends and playmates, even disparaging the opposite sex.<ref name="mayoclinic">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sex-education/HQ00547 Sex education: Talking to toddlers and preschoolers about sex - MayoClinic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Children may drop their close attachment to their opposite-sex parent and become more attached to their same-sex parent.<ref name="pike" />

During this time, children, especially girls, show increased awareness of social norms regarding sex, nudity, and privacy.<ref name="Richardson-Schuster">Richardson, Justin, M.D., and Schuster, Mark, M.D., Ph.D. ''[http://www.enotalone.com/article/2479.html Everything You Never Wanted Your Kids to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid They'd Ask)]'', 2003, Three Rivers Press</ref> Children may use sexual terms to test adult reaction.<ref name="pike" /> "Bathroom humor" (jokes and conversation relating to excretory functions), present in earlier stages, continues.<ref name="planned_parenthood_ohio">[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/central-ohio/sexuality-development.htm Planned Parenthood - Sexuality Development<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Normative behavior in middle childhood====<!-- This section is linked from [[List of psychology topics]] -->
"Middle childhood" covers the ages from about six to eleven, depending on the methodology and the behavior being studied, individual development varies considerably.

As this stage progresses, the choices of children picking same-sex friends becomes more marked and extending to disparagement of the opposite sex.<ref>[http://www.secasa.com.au/index.php/workers/50/131 Adolescent and child sexuality<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====Sex play among siblings====
In 1980, a survey of 796 undergraduates, 15 percent of females and 10 percent of males reported some form of sexual experience involving a sibling; most of these fell short of actual intercourse. Approximately one quarter of these experiences were described as abusive or exploitative.<ref>Finkelhor, David. Ph.D. ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/qg7tu631r7503228 Sex Among Siblings: A Survey on Prevalence, Variety and Effects.]'' Archives of Sexual Behavior. Volume 9, Number 3 / June, 1980. p. 171-194.</ref> A 1989 paper reported the results of a questionnaire with responses from 526 undergraduate college students in which 17 percent of the respondents stated that they had preadolescent sexual experiences with a sibling.<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/t188h6334n81313g/ SpringerLink - Journal Article<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Child sexualization in non-Western cultures==
At seven or eight years of age, children of the [[Trobriand Islands]] begin to play erotic games with each other and imitate adult seductive attitudes. About four or five years later, they begin to pursue sexual partners in earnest. They change partners often. Girls are just as assertive and dominant as boys in pursuing or refusing a lover. This is not only allowed but encouraged.<ref name=Weiner>Weiner, Annette B. The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea. United States of America: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 1988.</ref> 

A much earlier study (1915–1920) of Trobriand children reports that these children attempted to imitate adult sexual intercourse by the time they were 10 years old.<ref>Malinowski, B.; H. Ellis (1929). [[The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia]].
