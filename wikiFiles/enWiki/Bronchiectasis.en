'''Bronchiectasis''' is a disease state defined by localized, irreversible dilation of part of the [[bronchial tree]] caused by destruction of the muscle and elastic tissue. It is classified as an '''[[obstructive lung disease]]''', along with [[emphysema]], [[bronchitis]], [[asthma]], and [[cystic fibrosis]]. Involved [[bronchi]] are dilated, inflamed, and easily collapsible, resulting in [[Airway obstruction|airflow obstruction]] and impaired clearance of secretions. Bronchiectasis is associated with a wide range of disorders, but it usually results from bacterial infections, such as infections caused by the ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' or ''[[Klebsiella]]'' species, or ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| last=Hassan | first=Isaac | title=Bronchiectasis | encyclopedia=eMedicine Specialties Encyclopedia | publisher=WebMD | location=Gibraltar | date=8 December 2006 | url=http://www.emedicine.com/radio/topic116.htm | accessdate=2007-06-22 }}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Some people with bronchiectasis may produce frequent green/yellow sputum (patients with bronchiectasis may produce 240ml (8&nbsp;oz)  of sputum daily). However, it is possible to have "dry bronchiectasis" in which there is no sputum production. Sputum production may also occur without coloration. People with bronchiectasis may have [[bad breath]] indicative of active infection. Frequent bronchial infections and breathlessness are two possible indicators of bronchiectasis.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is based on the review of clinical history and characteristic patterns in high-resolution [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] findings. Such patterns include "[[tree-in-bud]]" abnormalities and cysts with definable borders. In one small study, CT findings of bronchiectasis and multiple small nodules were reported to have a [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 80%, [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 87%, and [[accuracy]] of 80% for the detection of bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis may also be diagnosed without CT scan confirmation if clinical history clearly demonstrates frequent respiratory infections as well as confirmation of an underlying problem via [[blood test|blood work]] and [[sputum]] culture samples.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller, JC |title=Pulmonary Mycobacterium Avium-Intracellular Infections in Women  |journal=Radiology Rounds |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages= |year=2006 |pmid= |doi=}}</ref>

Bronchiectasis has both [[congenital]] and [[acquired]] causes, with the latter more frequent.

===Acquired causes===

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ([[AIDS]]) is a leading cause of bronchiectasis, especially in children. AIDS predisposes patients to a variety of pulmonary ailments, such as [[pneumonia]] and other [[opportunistic infections]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sheikh S, Madiraju K, Steiner P, Rao M |title=Bronchiectasis in pediatric AIDS |journal=Chest |volume=112 |issue=5 |pages=1202–7 |year=1997 |pmid=9367458|doi=10.1378/chest.112.5.1202}}</ref>

[[Tuberculosis]] is another major cause. [[Endobronchial tuberculosis]] commonly leads to bronchiectasis, either from bronchial [[stenosis]] or secondary [[traction bronchiectasis|traction]] from fibrosis.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| last=Catanzano | first=Tara | title=Primary Tuberculosis | encyclopedia=eMedicine Specialties Encyclopedia | publisher=WebMD | location=Connecticut | date=5 September 2005 | url=http://www.emedicine.com/radio/topic411.htm | accessdate=2007-06-22 }}</ref>

Bronchiectasis can sometimes be an unusual complication of [[inflammatory bowel disease]], especially [[ulcerative colitis]]. It can occur in [[Crohn's disease]] as well, but does so less frequently. Bronchiectasis in this situation usually stems from various allergic responses to inhaled [[fungus]] [[spores]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ferguson HR, Convery RP |title=An unusual complication of ulcerative colitis |journal=Postgrad. Med. J. |volume=78 |issue= 922|pages=503 |year=2002 |pmid= 12185236|doi=10.1136/pmj.78.922.503 |pmc=1742448}}</ref>  A [[Hiatal hernia]] can cause Bronchiectasis when the stomach acid that is aspirated into the lungs causes tissue damage.

Recent evidence has shown an increased risk of bronchiectasis in patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]] who smoke. One study stated a tenfold increased [[prevalence]] of the disease in this cohort.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kaushik, VV, Hutchinson D, Desmond J, Lynch MP, and Dawson JK |title=Association between bronchiectasis and smoking in patients with rheumatoid arthritis |journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases |volume=63|issue= 8|pages=1001–2 |year=2004 |pmid= 15249329|doi=10.1136/ard.2003.015123 |pmc=1755104}}</ref> Still, it is unclear as to whether or not cigarette smoke is a specific primary cause of bronchiectasis.

Other acquired causes of bronchiectasis involving environmental exposures include respiratory infections, [[Airway obstruction|obstructions]], inhalation and aspiration of [[ammonia]] and other toxic gases, [[pulmonary aspiration]], [[alcoholism]], [[heroin]] (drug use), various [[allergy|allergies]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lamari NM, Martins ALQ, Oliveira JV, Marino LC, Valério N |title=Bronchiectasis and {{sic|clearence|expected=clearance}} physiotherapy: emphasis in postural drainage and percussion|language=Portuguese |journal=Braz.

===Congenital causes===

[[Primary ciliary dyskinesia|Kartagener syndrome]], which affects the mobility of [[cilia]] in the lungs,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Morillas HN, Zariwala M, Knowles MR|title=Genetic Causes of Bronchiectasis: Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia |journal=Respiration |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=252–63 |year=2007 |pmid=17534128 |doi=10.1159/000101783 }}</ref> aids in the development of the disease. Another common genetic cause is [[cystic fibrosis]], in which a small number of patients develop severe localized bronchiectasis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dalrymple-Hay MJ, Lucas J, Connett G, Lea RE|title=Lung resection for the treatment of severe localized bronchiectasis in cystic fibrosis patients |journal=Acta Chir Hung. |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=23–5 |year=1999 |pmid=10439089 |doi=}}</ref> [[Young's syndrome]], which is clinically similar to cystic fibrosis, is thought to significantly contribute to the development of bronchiectasis. This is due to the occurrence of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Sinopulmonary sinopulmonary] infections.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198401053100102 |author=Handelsman DJ, Conway AJ, Boylan LM, & Turtle JR |title=Young's syndrome.

==Prevention==
In order to prevent bronchiectasis, children should be immunized against measles, [[pertussis]] and other acute respiratory infections of childhood.  While [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] has not been found to be a direct cause of bronchiectasis, it is certainly an irritant that all patients should avoid in order to prevent the development of infections (such as [[bronchitis]]) and further complications.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crofton J |title=Diagnosis and Treatment of Bronchiectasis: I. Diagnosis |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=5489 |pages=721–3 contd |year=1966 |pmid=5909486 |pmc=1844268 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.5489.721|url=}}</ref>

Treatments to slow down the progression of this chronic disease include keeping bronchial airways clear and secretions weakened through various forms of [[pneumotherapy]]. Aggressively treating bronchial infections with antibiotics to prevent the destructive cycle of infection, damage to bronchial tubes, and more infection is also standard treatment. Regular vaccination against [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]] and [[pertussis]] are generally advised. A healthy [[body mass index]] and regular doctor visits may have beneficial effects on the prevention of progressing bronchiectasis. The presence of [[hypoxemia]], [[hypercapnia]], [[dyspnea]] level and radiographic extent can greatly affect the mortality rate from this disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Onen ZP, Eris Gulbay B, Sen E, Akkoca Yildiz O, Saryal S, Acican T, Karabiyikoglu G|title=Analysis of the factors related to mortality in patients with bronchiectasis  |journal= Respir Med. |volume=101 |issue=7 |pages=1390–97 |year=2007 |pmid=17374480|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2007.02.002}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Treatment of bronchiectasis includes controlling [[infection]]s and bronchial secretions, relieving airway obstructions, removal of affected portions of lung by surgical removal or artery embolization and preventing [[Complication (medicine)|complication]]s. This includes the prolonged usage of [[antibiotic]]s to prevent detrimental infections,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Evans DJ, Bara AI,Greenstone M |title=Prolonged antibiotics for purulent bronchiectasis in children and adults  |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD001392 |year=2007 |pmid=17443506 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001392.pub2 |editor1-last=Evans |editor1-first=David J}}</ref> as well as eliminating accumulated fluid with [[postural drainage]] and chest [[physiotherapy]]. Surgery may also be used to treat localized bronchiectasis, removing obstructions that could cause progression of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Otgün I, Karnak I, Tanyel FC, Senocak ME, Büyükpamukçu N |title=Surgical treatment of bronchiectasis in children |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1532–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15486899 |doi= 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2004.06.009|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022346804004026}}</ref>

Inhaled [[steroid]] therapy that is consistently adhered to can reduce sputum production and decrease airway constriction over a period of time, and help prevent progression of bronchiectasis. One commonly used therapy is [[beclometasone dipropionate]], which is also used in [[asthma]] treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elborn JS, Johnston B, Allen F, Clarke J, McGarry J, Varghese G. |title=Inhaled steroids in patients with bronchiectasis  |journal=Respir Med |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=121–4 |year=1992 |pmid=1615177|doi=10.1016/S0954-6111(06)80227-1}}</ref> Use of [[Metered-dose inhaler|inhalers]] such as [[Salbutamol|albuterol (salbutamol)]], [[Fluticasone|fluticasone (Flovent/Flixotide)]] and [[Ipratropium|ipratropium (Atrovent)]]  may help reduce likelihood of infection by clearing the airways and decreasing inflammation.<ref>{{cite web | last = Reports | first = Consumer | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ipratropium and Albuterol Inhalation - Drug Review | work = | publisher = Consumer Reports of U.S.| date = 15 March 2007 | url = http://www.consumerreports.org/mg/drug-reports/ipratropium-and-albuterol-inhalation.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2007-06-22}}</ref>

Although not approved for use in any country, [[Mannitol]] dry inhalation powder, under the name Bronchitol, has been granted [[orphan drug]] status by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for use in patients with bronchiectasis and with cystic fibrosis.<ref>{{cite web | last = Waknine | first = Yael | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Orphan Drug Approvals: Bronchitol, Prestara, GTI-2040 | work = | publisher = Medscape today for WebMD | date = 27 July 2005 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/509116 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-06-22}}</ref>

Combination therapies, long acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids such as Symbicort and Advair Diskus are also commonly used inhaled medicines which has in many cases been effective in clearing the airways, reducing sputum and reducing inflammation.

Additionally, the use of ACBT (Active Cycle Breathing Techniques) can be useful in the clearance of sputum.  These techniques encourage relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing, greater expansion (via collateral inflation) of otherwise consolidated areas of the lungs, and help in mucociliary clearance (MCC).  A useful adjunct to these cycles are manual techniques, wherein the healthcare professional uses percussion, vibrations, and shaking, to dislodge sputum from the chest walls, enabling the patient to expectorate more easily.
