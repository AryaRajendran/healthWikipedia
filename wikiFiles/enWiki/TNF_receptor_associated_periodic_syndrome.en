Individuals with TRAPS have episodic symptoms such as recurrent high [[fevers]], [[rash]], [[abdominal pain]], joint/muscle aches and puffy eyes. TRAPS was first described in 1982 in a boy of Scottish-Irish origin. At that time, it was named familial Hibernian fever.<ref name= springerlink/>

The main source of TNF (tumor necrosis factor) is cells in the [[immune system]] called [[macrophage]]s which produce it in response to infection and other stimuli. TNF helps activate other immune cells and plays a major role in initiation of [[inflammation]]. Individuals with TRAPS have a mutation in the [[CD120|tumor necrosis factor receptor-1]] (TNFR1) [[gene]]. The mechanisms by which mutations in TNFR1 lead to the TRAPS [[phenotype]] are still under investigation. Impaired shedding of the TNF receptor is one of the possible defects. Most mutations affect the extracellular domain of the receptor, some also the cleavage site.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Several medications have been studied for the treatment of TRAPS including [[etanercept]], [[infliximab]],<ref>Church LD, Churchman SM, Hawkins PN, McDermott MF.
