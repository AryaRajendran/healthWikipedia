'''Deinstitutionalisation''' (or '''deinstitutionalization''') is the process of replacing long-stay [[psychiatric hospital]]s with less isolated [[community mental health service]]s for those diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] or [[developmental disability]]. Deinstitutionalisation works in two ways: the first focuses on reducing the population size of mental institutions by releasing patients, shortening stays, and reducing both admissions and readmission rates; the second focuses on reforming mental hospitals' institutional processes so as to reduce or eliminate reinforcement of dependency, hopelessness, learned helplessness, and other maladaptive behaviours.<ref name=Stroman>{{cite book|last=Stroman|first=Duane|year=2003|title=The Disability Rights Movement: From Deinstitutionalization to Self-determination|publisher=University Press of America}}</ref>

According to psychiatrist [[Leon Eisenberg]], deinstitutionalisation has been an overall benefit for most psychiatric patients, though many have been left homeless and without care.<ref name=Eisenberg>{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Leon|authorlink=Leon Eisenberg|last2=Guttmacher|first2=Laurence|title=Were we all asleep at the switch?

* A socio-political movement for community mental health services and open hospitals;
* The advent of [[psychotropic drugs]] able to manage [[Psychosis|psychotic]] episodes;
* A ﬁnancial imperative to shift costs from state to federal budgets.<ref name=Eisenberg/>

According to American psychiatrist [[Loren Mosher]], most deinstitutionalization in the USA took place after 1972, as a result of the availability of [[Supplemental Security Income|SSI]], long after the antipsychotic drugs were used universally in state hospitals.<ref name=Mosher>{{cite journal|last=Mosher|first=Loren|authorlink=Loren Mosher|title=Letter Mosher to Goodwin|journal=[[Psychology Today]]|volume= 32|issue=5|year=1999|pages=8|url=http://www.moshersoteria.com/soteriawp/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/psycho.pdf}}</ref>

According to psychiatrist and author [[Thomas Szasz]], deinstitutionalisation is the policy and practice of transferring homeless, involuntarily hospitalised mental patients from state mental hospitals into many different kinds of ''de facto'' psychiatric institutions funded largely by the federal government. These federally subsidised institutions began in the United States and were quickly adopted by most Western governments. The plan was set in motion by the [[Community Mental Health Act]] as a part of John F. Kennedy's legislation {{Clarify|date=February 2012}} and passed by the U.S. Congress in 1963, mandating the appointment of a commission to make recommendations for "combating mental illness in the United States".<ref name=Szasz>{{cite book|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=Coercion as cure: a critical history of psychiatry|year=2007|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|isbn=0-7658-0379-8|pages=34|url=http://books.google.ru/books?id=YqYFBbp0u2wC&pg=PA34}}</ref>  

In many cases the deinstitutionalisation of the mentally ill in the Western world from the 1960s onward has translated into policies of "community release". Individuals who previously would have been in mental institutions are no longer continuously supervised by health care workers. Some experts, such as [[E. Fuller Torrey]], have considered deinstitutionalisation to be a failure,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Torrey|first=E. Fuller|title=Documenting the failure of deinstitutionalization.|journal=Psychiatry|date=2010 Summer|volume=73|issue=2|pages=122–4|pmid=20557222}}</ref> while some consider many aspects of institutionalization to have been worse.

==Origins==
===19th century===
The 19th century saw a large expansion in the number and size of [[lunatic asylum|asylum]]s in Western [[industrialization|industrialised]] countries. Although initially based on principles of [[moral treatment]], they became overstretched, non-therapeutic, isolated in location, and neglectful of patients.<ref name=Wright1997>{{cite journal |author=Wright D |title=Getting out of the asylum: understanding the confinement of the insane in the nineteenth century |journal=Social History of Medicine |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=137–55 |year=1997 |month=April |pmid=11619188 |doi= 10.1093/shm/10.1.137}}</ref>

===20th century===
By the beginning of the 20th century, increasing admissions had resulted in serious overcrowding, causing many problems for psychiatric institutions. Funding was often cut, especially during periods of economic decline and wartime. Asylums became notorious for poor living conditions, lack of hygiene, overcrowding, ill-treatment, and [[Patient abuse|abuse of patients]]; many patients starved to death.<ref name=Fakhourya07>{{cite journal |last1=Fakhourya|first1=W|last2=Priebea|first2=S |title=Deinstitutionalization and reinstitutionalization: major changes in the provision of mental healthcare |journal=Psychiatry |volume=6 |pages=313–316 |month=August |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.mppsy.2007.05.008 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1476179307001085 |issue=8}}</ref>

The first community-based alternatives were suggested and tentatively implemented in the 1920s and 1930s, although asylum numbers continued to increase up to the 1950s. The movement for deinstitutionalisation moved to the forefront in various countries during the 1950s and 1960s with the advent of [[chlorpromazine]] and other antipsychotic drugs.

The prevailing public arguments, time of onset, and pace of reforms varied by country.<ref name=Fakhourya07/> In the United States, [[class action lawsuit]]s and the scrutiny of institutions through [[disability activism]] and [[antipsychiatry]] helped expose poor conditions and treatment. Sociologists and others argued that such institutions maintained or created dependency, passivity, exclusion, and disability, which caused people to remain institutionalised. [[Rosenhan experiment|Rosenhan's experiment]] in 1973 "accelerated the movement to reform mental institutions and to deinstitutionalize as many mental patients as possible."<ref>{{cite book |last = Kornblum | first = William | editor1-last = Mitchell | editor1-first = Erin | editor2-last = Jucha | editor2-first = Robert | editor3-last = Chell | editor3-first = John | title = Sociology in a Changing World | edition = 9th | publisher = Cengage learning | year = 2011 | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=DtKcG6qoY5AC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false | doi = | isbn = 978-1-111-30157-6 | page = 195}}</ref>

A prevailing argument claimed that community services would be cheaper and that new psychiatric medications made it more feasible to release people into the community.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rochefort, D.A. |title=Origins of the "Third psychiatric revolution": the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 |journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–30 |date=Spring 1984 |pmid=6736594 |url=http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6736594 |doi=10.1215/03616878-9-1-1}}</ref> Mental health professionals, public officials, families, advocacy groups, public citizens, and unions held differing views on deinstitutionalisation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scherl|first1=D.J.|last2=Macht|first2=L.B. |title=Deinstitutionalization in the absence of consensus |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=599–604 |year= 1979 |month=September |pmid=223959 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=223959}}</ref>

A key text in the development of deinstitutionalisation was ''[[Asylums (book)|Asylums]]'' by [[Erving Goffman]].<ref name="Mac Suibhne">{{cite journal|last=Mac Suibhne|first=Séamus|title=Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and other Inmates|journal=[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]|year=2009|month=7 October|volume=339|pages=b4109|doi=10.1136/bmj.b4109|url=http://www.bmj.com:8080/content/339/bmj.b4109.extract}}</ref>

==Consequences==
Community services that developed include [[supportive housing]] with full or partial supervision and specialised teams (such as [[assertive community treatment]] and [[early intervention in psychosis|early intervention teams]]). Costs have been reported as generally equivalent to inpatient hospitalisation, even lower in some cases (depending on how well or poorly funded the community alternatives are).<ref name=Fakhourya07/>

Although deinstitutionalisation has been positive for the majority of patients, it also has severe shortcomings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/asylums/special/excerpt.html|title=Deinstitutionalization: A Psychiatric "Titanic"|last=Torrey|first=E. Fuller|year=1997|work=Out of the Shadows: Confronting America's Mental Illness Crisis|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|accessdate=21 October 2011}} excerpted by ''Frontline'' (pbs.org).</ref> Expectations that community care would lead to fuller social integration have not been achieved; many remain without work, have limited social contacts, and often live in sheltered environments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Torrey.E|title=Deinstitutionalization: A Psychiatric "Titanic"|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/asylums/special/excerpt.html}}</ref>

New community services are often uncoordinated and unable to meet complex needs. Services in the community sometimes isolate the mentally ill within a new [[ghetto]], where service users meet each other but have little contact with the rest of the public community. It has been said that instead of "[[community psychiatry]]", reforms established a "psychiatric community".<ref name= Fakhourya07/>

Existing patients are often discharged without sufficient preparation or support. A greater proportion of people with mental disorders become [[homeless]] or go to [[prison]].<ref name=Fakhourya07/> Families can often play a crucial role in the care of those who would typically be placed in long-term treatment centres. However, many mentally ill people are resistant to such help due to the nature of their conditions. The majority of those who would be under continuous care in long-stay psychiatric hospitals are paranoid and delusional to the point that they refuse help, believing they do not need it, which makes it difficult to treat them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Torrey|first=E.

===Violence===
====Victimisation====
Moves to community living and services have led to various concerns and fears, from both the individuals themselves and other members of the community. Over a quarter of individuals accessing community mental health services in a US inner-city area are victims of at least one violent crime in a year, a proportion eleven times higher than the inner-city average. The elevated victim rate holds for every category of crime, including rape/sexual assault, other violent assaults, and personal and property theft. Victimisation rates are similar to those with developmental disabilities.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Teplin|first1=Linda A|last2=McClelland|first2=Gary M|last3=Abram|first3=Karen M|last4=Weiner|first4=Dana A|title=Crime Victimization in Adults With Severe Mental Illness: Comparison With the National Crime Victimization Survey |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=911–21 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16061769 |pmc=1389236 |doi= 10.1001/archpsyc.62.8.911 |url=http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=208861}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Petersilia|first=Joan R |title=Crime Victims With Developmental Disabilities: A Review Essay |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=655–94 |year=2001 |doi=10.1177/009385480102800601 |url= http://cjb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/6/655}}</ref>

====Misconceptions====
Despite perceptions by the public and media that people with mental disorders released into the community are more likely to be dangerous and violent, a large study indicated that they are no more likely to commit violence than others in their neighbourhoods, which were usually economically deprived and high in substance abuse and crime.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Steadman|first1=Henry J|last2=Mulvey|first2=Edward P.|last3=Monahan|first3=John|last4=Robbins|first4=Pamela Clark|last5=Appelbaum|first5=Paul S|last6=Grisso|first6=Thomas|last7=Roth|first7=Loren H|last8=Silver|first8=Eric|title=Violence by people discharged from acute psychiatric inpatient facilities and by others in the same neighborhoods |journal=Archive of General Psychiatry |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=393–401 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9596041 |url=http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=203874 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.55.5.393}}</ref>

Findings on violence committed by those with mental disorders in the community have been inconsistent and related to numerous factors; a higher rate of more serious offences such as homicide have sometimes been found but, despite high-profile homicide cases, the evidence suggests this has not been increased by deinstitutionalisation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sirotich|first=F. |title=Correlates of Crime and Violence among Persons with Mental Disorder: An Evidence-Based Review |journal=Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=171–94 |year=2008 |doi=10.1093/brief-treatment/mhn006 |url=http://triggered.edina.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbtci.stanford.clockss.org%2Fcgi%2Fcontent%2Fabstract%2F8%2F2%2F171}}</ref><ref name=Stuart03>{{cite journal |last=Stuart|first=H. |title=Violence and mental illness: an overview |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=121–4 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=16946914 |pmc= 1525086}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Taylor|first1=P.J.|last2=Gunn|first2=J. |title=Homicides by people with mental illness: Myth and reality |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=174 |issue=1|pages=9–14 |year=1999 |month=January |pmid=10211145 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/174/1/9 |doi=10.1192/bjp.174.1.9}}</ref> The aggression and violence that does occur, in either direction, is usually within family settings rather than between strangers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Solomon|first1=Phyllis L.|last2=Cavanaugh|first2=Mary M.|last3=Gelles|first3=Richard J. |title=Family violence among adults with severe mental illness: a neglected area of research |journal=[[Trauma, Violence, & Abuse]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=40–54 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15574672 |doi=10.1177/1524838004272464 |url=http://tva.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15574672}}</ref>

==Worldwide==
===Asia===
====Hong Kong====
In [[Health in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], a number of residential care services such as [[half-way house]]s, long-stay care homes, supported [[hostel]]s are provided for the discharged patients. In addition, community support services such as rehabilitation day services and mental health care have been launched to facilitate the patients' re-integration into the community.

====Japan====
In [[Health in Japan|Japan]], the number of hospital beds has risen steadily over the last few decades.<ref name=Fakhourya07/>

====New Zealand====
[[New Zealand]] established a [[Truth and reconciliation commission|reconciliation]] initiative in 2005 to address the ongoing [[damages|compensation]] payouts to ex-patients of state-run mental institutions in the 1970s to 1990s. A number of grievances were heard, including: poor reasons for admissions; unsanitary and overcrowded conditions; lack of communication to patients and family members; physical violence and sexual misconduct and abuse; inadequate mechanisms for dealing with complaints; pressures and difficulties for staff, within an [[authoritarian]] hierarchy based on containment; fear and humiliation in the misuse of [[seclusion]]; over-use and abuse of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]], psychiatric medications, and other treatments as punishments, including [[group therapy]], with continued [[adverse effects]]; lack of support on discharge; interrupted lives and lost potential; and continued stigma, prejudice, and emotional distress and trauma.

There were some references to instances of helpful aspects or kindnesses despite the system. Participants were offered counselling to help them deal with their experiences, along with advice on their rights, including access to records and legal redress.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Department of Internal Affairs, New Zealand Government|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/Agency-Confidential-Forum-for-Former-In-Patients-of-Psychiatric-Hospitals-Index|title=Report of the Confidential Forum for Former In-Patients of Psychiatric Hospitals|date=June 2007}}</ref>

Italy was the first country to begin the deinstitutionalisation of mental health care and to develop a community-based psychiatric system.<ref name="Russo">{{cite journal |last1=Russo|first1=Giovanni|last2=Carelli|first2=Francesco|title=Dismantling asylums: The Italian Job |journal=London Journal of Primary Care |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2009 |month=April |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.londonjournalofprimarycare.org.uk/articles/1694370.pdf}}</ref> The Italian system served as a model of effective service and paved the way for deinstitutionalisation of mental patients.<ref name="Russo"/> In 1978, the [[Basaglia Law]] had started [[Italian psychiatric reform]] that resulted in the end of the Italian state mental hospital system in 1998.<ref name="Burti">{{cite journal |author=Burti L. |title=Italian psychiatric reform 20 plus years after |journal=[[Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica]].

===North America===
====United States====
The United States has experienced two waves of deinstitutionalisation. The first wave began in the 1950s and targeted people with mental illness.<ref name=Stroman/> The second wave began roughly 15 years later and focused on individuals who had been diagnosed with a developmental disability (e.g. mental retardation).<ref name=Stroman/> Deinstitutionalisation continues today, though the movements  are growing smaller as fewer people are sent to institutions.

Numerous social forces led to a move for deinstitutionalisation; researchers generally give credit to six main factors: criticisms of public mental hospitals, incorporation of [[mind-altering drugs]] in treatment, support from President Kennedy for federal policy changes, shifts to community-based care, changes in public perception, and individual states' desires to reduce costs from mental hospitals.<ref name=Stroman/>

=====Criticisms of public mental hospitals=====
The public's awareness of conditions in mental institutions began to increase during World War II. Conscientious objectors (COs) of the war were assigned to alternative positions which suffered from manpower shortages.<ref name=Stroman/> Around 2,000 COs were assigned to work in understaffed mental institutions.<ref name=Stroman/> In 1946, an exposé in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] detailed the shortfalls of many mental health facilities.<ref name=Stroman/> This exposé was one of the first featured articles about the quality of mental institutions.<ref name=Stroman/>

Following WWII, articles and exposés about the mental hospital conditions bombarded popular and scholarly magazines and periodicals. The COs from the 1946 ''Life'' exposé formed the National Mental Health Foundation, which raised public support and successfully convinced states to increase funding for mental institutions.<ref name=Stroman/> Five years later, the National Mental Health Foundation merged with the Hygiene and Psychiatric Foundation to form the [[National Association of Mental Health]].

During WWII, it was found that 1 out of 8 men considered for military service was rejected based on a neurological or psychiatric problem.<ref name="Stroman"/> This increased awareness of the prevalence of mental illnesses, and people began to realize the costs associated with admission to mental institutions (i.e. cost of lost productivity and of mental health services).<ref name=Stroman/> 

Since numerous individuals suffering from mental illness had served in the military, many began to believe that more knowledge about mental illness and better services would not only benefit those who served but also national security as a whole.<ref name=Stroman/> Congress passed the [[National Mental Health Act|National Mental Health Act of 1946]], which created the [[National Institute of Mental Health|National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)]]. NIMH was pivotal in funding research for the developing mental health field.<ref name=Stroman/>

=====Pharmacotherapy=====
During the 1950s, new drugs became available and were incorporated into treatment for the mentally ill. The new drugs effectively reduced severe symptoms, allowing the mentally ill to live in environments less stringent than institutions, such as half-way houses, nursing homes, or their own homes. Drug therapy also allowed many mentally ill to obtain employment.<ref name=Stroman/>

=====President Kennedy=====
In 1955, the Joint Commission on Mental Health and Health was authorised to investigate problems related to the mentally ill. President [[John F. Kennedy]] had a special interest in the issue of mental health because his sister, [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], had been [[Rosemary_Kennedy#Lobotomy|lobotomised]] at the age of 23 at the request of her father.<ref name=Stroman/> Shortly after his inauguration, Kennedy appointed a special President's Panel of Mental Retardation.<ref name=Stroman/> The panel included professionals and leaders of the organization. In 1962, the panel published a report with 112 recommendations to better serve the mentally ill.<ref name=Stroman/>

In conjunction with the Joint Commission on Mental Health and Health, the Presidential Panel of Mental Retardation, and Kennedy's influence, two important pieces of legislation were passed in 1963: the Maternal and Child Health and Mental Retardation Planning Amendments, which increased funding for research on the prevention of retardation, and the [[Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act]], which provided funding for community facilities that served people with mental disabilities.<ref name=Stroman/> Both acts furthered the process of deinstitutionalisation.

=====Shift to community-based care=====
In general, professionals, civil rights leaders, and humanitarians saw the shift from institutional confinement to local care as the appropriate approach.<ref name=Stroman/> The deinstitutionalisation movement started off slowly but gained momentum as it adopted philosophies from the [[Civil Rights Movement]].<ref name=Stroman/> During the 1960s, deinstitutionalisation increased dramatically, and the average length of stay within mental institutions decreased by more than half.<ref name=Stroman/> Many patients began to be placed in community care facilities instead of long-term care institutions.<ref name=Stroman/>

=====Changing public opinion=====
Although public opinion of the mentally ill has raised, it is still often stigmatised. As a result, advocacy movements in support of mental health have emerged.<ref name=Stroman/> These movements focus on reducing stigma and discrimination and increasing support groups and awareness. Another notable movement, the [[psychiatric survivors movement|consumer or ex-patient movement]], began as protests in the 1970s, forming groups such as Liberation of Mental Patients, Project Release, Insane Liberation Front, and the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness|National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)]].<ref name=Stroman/> 

Many of the participants consisted of ex-patients of mental institutions who felt the need to challenge the system's treatment of the mentally ill.<ref name=Stroman/> Initially, this movement targeted issues surrounding involuntary commitment, use of electroconvulsive therapy, antipsychotic medication, and coercive psychiatry.<ref name=Stroman/> Many of these advocacy groups were successful in the judiciary system. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] ruled in favour of the Mental Patient's Liberation Front of [[Rogers v. Okin]],<ref name=Stroman/> establishing the right of a patient to refuse treatment. NAMI successfully lobbied to improve mental health services and gain equality of insurance coverage for mental illnesses.<ref name=Stroman/> In 1996, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Mental Health Parity Act]], realizing the mental health movement's goal of equal insurance coverage.

=====Reducing costs=====
As hospitalisation costs increased, both the federal and state governments were motivated to find less expensive alternatives to hospitalisation.<ref name=Stroman/> The 1965 amendments to Social Security shifted about 50% of the mental health care costs from states to the federal government,<ref name=Stroman/> motivating the government{{clarify|date=May 2012}}<!--federal?--> to promote deinstitutionalisation.

The increase in homelessness was seen as related to deinstitutionalisation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scanlon, John |title=Homelessness: Describing the Symptoms, Prescribing a Cure |journal=Backgrounder |id=729 |date=2 October 1989 |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Welfare/bg729.cfm |publisher=Heritage Foundation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=Lillian B.|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=940|title=Sand Castles and Snake Pits: Homelessness, Public Policy, and the Law of Unintended Consequences|newspaper=Dissent|date=Fall 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Michael B.|url=http://mhawestchester.org/advocates/opromise81303.asp|title=Keeping The Promise of Community Mental Health|newspaper=The Journal News|date= 8 August 2003}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> Studies from the late 1980s indicated that one-third to one-half of homeless people had severe psychiatric disorders, often co-occurring with [[substance abuse]].<ref name=McQuistion03>{{cite journal |last1=McQuistion|first1=Hunter L.|last2=Finnerty|first2=Molly|last3=Hirschowitz|first3=Jack|last4=Susser|first4=Ezra S.|title=Challenges for psychiatry in serving homeless people with psychiatric disorders |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=669–76 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12719496 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=54&page=669 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.54.5.669}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Feldman, S. |title=Out of the hospital, onto the streets: the overselling of benevolence |journal=Hastings Center Report |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=5–7 |year=1983 |month=June |pmid=6885404 |doi=10.2307/3561609 |jstor=3561609}}</ref>
