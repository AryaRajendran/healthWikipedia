'''Huntington's disease''' ('''HD''') is a [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] [[genetic disorder]] that affects muscle coordination and leads to [[cognitive]] decline and [[mental disorders|psychiatric problems]]. It typically becomes noticeable in mid-adult life. HD is the most common genetic cause of abnormal involuntary writhing movements called [[chorea]], which is why the disease used to be called '''Huntington's chorea'''.

It is much more common in people of Western European descent than in those of Asian or African ancestry. The disease is caused by an [[Autosome|autosomal]] [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] [[mutation]] in either of an individual's two copies of a [[gene]] called [[Huntingtin]], which means any child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. Physical symptoms of Huntington's disease can begin at any age from infancy to old age, but usually begin between 35 and 44 years of age. Through [[anticipation (genetics)|genetic anticipation]], the disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 6% of cases start before the age of 21 years with an akinetic-rigid syndrome; they progress faster and vary slightly. The variant is classified as '''juvenile''', '''akinetic-rigid''' or '''Westphal variant HD'''.

The ''Huntingtin'' gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called "huntingtin". Expansion of a CAG triplet repeat stretch within the ''Huntingtin'' gene results in a different (mutant) form of the protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. The genetic basis of HD was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort spearheaded by the [[Hereditary Disease Foundation]].

[[Genetic testing]] can be performed at any stage of [[Human development (biology)|development]], even before the onset of symptoms. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results. [[Genetic counseling]] has developed to inform and aid individuals considering genetic testing and has become a model for other [[Dominance (genetics)|genetically dominant]] diseases.

Symptoms of the disease can vary between individuals and even among affected members of the same family, but usually progress predictably. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or cognition. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follows. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent, along with a decline in mental abilities and behavioral and [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] problems. Physical abilities are gradually impeded until coordinated movement becomes very difficult.  Mental abilities generally decline into [[dementia]]. Complications such as [[pneumonia]], [[heart disease]], and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy to around twenty years after symptoms begin. There is no cure for HD, and full-time care is required in the later stages of the disease.  Existing pharmaceutical and non-drug treatments can relieve many of its symptoms.

Research and [[Support group|support]] organizations, first founded in the 1960s and increasing in number, work to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote and facilitate research. Many new research discoveries have been made and understanding of the disease is improving. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the disease, improving [[animal models]] to expedite research, clinical trials of pharmaceuticals to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and studying procedures such as [[Stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] with the goal of repairing damage caused by the disease.

==Genetics==
<!-- Please note that although the disorder is spelt Huntington, the associated gene and protein are correctly spelt Huntingtin -->
All humans have two copies of the [[Huntingtin]] gene (''HTT''), which codes for the [[protein]] [[Huntingtin#Protein|Huntingtin]] (Htt). The gene is also called ''HD'' and ''IT15'', which stands for 'interesting [[transcription (genetics)|transcript]] 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a [[trinucleotide repeat disorder|trinucleotide repeat]], which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHtt). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully [[penetrance|penetrant]]: mutation of either of a person's ''HTT'' genes causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but the length of the repeated section of the gene, and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.<ref name="lancet221">{{cite journal |author=Walker FO |title=Huntington's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |year=2007 |pmid=17240289 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1 |pages=218–28 [221] }}</ref>

===Genetic mutation===
HD is one of several [[trinucleotide repeat disorder]]s which are caused by the length of a repeated section of a gene exceeding a normal range.<ref name="lancet220">{{cite journal |author=Walker FO |title=Huntington's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |year=2007 |pmid=17240289 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1 |pages=218–28 [220] }}</ref> The ''HTT'' gene is located on the [[Locus (genetics)|short arm]] of [[chromosome 4 (human)|chromosome 4]]<ref name="lancet220"/> at 4p16.3. ''HTT'' contains a sequence of three [[DNA base]]s—cytosine-adenine-guanine ([[Codon|CAG]])—repeated multiple times (i.e.&nbsp;... CAGCAGCAG&nbsp;...), known as a trinucleotide repeat.<ref name="lancet220"/> CAG is the 3-letter [[genetic code]] ([[codon]]) for the [[amino acid]] [[glutamine]], so a series of them results in the production of a chain of glutamine known as a [[polyglutamine tract]] (or polyQ tract), and the repeated part of the gene, the ''PolyQ region''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Katsuno M |title=Molecular genetics and biomarkers of polyglutamine diseases |journal=Curr.

Generally, people have fewer than 36 repeated glutamines in the polyQ region which results in production of the [[cytoplasmic]] protein Huntingtin.<ref name="lancet220"/> However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results in the production of a protein which has different characteristics.<ref name="lancet220"/> This altered form, called mHtt (mutant Htt), increases the decay rate of certain types of [[medium spiny neurons|neurons]]. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these type of neurons, and are affected accordingly.<ref name="lancet219"/> Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD.<ref name="lancet220"/> 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-[[penetrance]] form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed.<ref name="lancet222">{{cite journal |author=Walker FO |title=Huntington's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9557 |year=2007 |pmid=17240289 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1 |pages=218–28 [222] }}</ref> With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD.

===Inheritance===
[[File:Autosomal Dominant Pedigree Chart2.svg|thumb|270px|right|alt=Diagram showing a father carrying the gene and an unaffected mother leading to some of their offspring being affected; those affected are also shown with some affected offspring; those unaffected have no affected offspring|Huntington's disease is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] fashion. The probability of each offspring inheriting an affected gene is 50%. Inheritance is independent of gender, and the phenotype does not skip generations.]]

Huntington's disease has [[autosomal dominant]] inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits one copy of the gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant [[allele]]) from an affected parent.<ref name="lancet218"/> Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, those who have a mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.<ref name="basicgenetics">{{cite book | last=Passarge | first=E | title=Color Atlas of Genetics | publisher=Thieme | edition=2nd | year=2001 | page=142 | isbn=0-86577-958-9 }}</ref>

Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are unstable during [[DNA replication|replication]] and this instability increases with the number of repeats present.<ref name="lancet222"/> This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass ([[dynamic mutation]]s) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat.<ref name="lancet220"/> This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an "intermediate" number of repeats (28–35), or "reduced penetrance" (36–40), may pass on a copy of the gene with an increase in the number of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD.<ref name="lancet220"/> Such increases in the number of repeats (and hence earlier [[age of onset]] and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic [[anticipation (genetics)|anticipation]].<ref name="lancet220"/> Instability is greater in [[spermatogenesis]] than [[oogenesis]];<ref name="lancet220"/> maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar repeat length, whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length.<ref name="lancet220"/><ref>{{cite journal| author=Ridley RM, Frith CD, Crow TJ, Conneally PM| title=Anticipation in Huntington's disease is inherited through the male line but may originate in the female| journal=Journal of Medical Genetics| year=1988| volume=25| pages=589–595| url=http://jmg.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/25/9/589| pmid=2972838| doi=10.1136/jmg.25.9.589| issue=9| pmc=1051535}}</ref> It is rare for Huntington's disease to be caused by a [[de novo mutation|new mutation]], where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats.<ref name="pmid16965319">{{cite journal |author=Semaka A, Creighton S, Warby S, Hayden MR |title=Predictive testing for Huntington disease: interpretation and significance of intermediate alleles |journal=Clin.

An additional theory that explains another way cell function may be disrupted by HD proposes that damage to mitochondria in striatal cells (numerous accounts of mitochondrial metabolism deficiency have been found) and the interactions of the altered huntingtin protein with numerous proteins in neurons leads to an increased vulnerability of glutamine, which, in large amounts, has been found to be an [[excitotoxin]].  Excitotoxins may cause damage to numerous cellular structures.

HD affects the whole brain, but certain areas are more vulnerable than others.

The basal ganglia—the part of the brain most prominently affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are part of the cognitive [[executive function|executive system]]<ref name="pmid16496032"/> and the motor circuit.<ref name="pmid10923984"/> The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD.<ref name="pmid10923984">{{cite journal |author=Crossman AR |title=Functional anatomy of movement disorders |journal=J.

===Transcriptional dysregulation===
CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcription factor, is essential for cell function because as a coactivator at a significant number of promoters, it activates the transcription of genes for survival pathways.<ref name="urlNature Clinical Practice Neurology | Mechanisms of Disease: histone modifications in Huntingtons disease | Article"/> Furthermore, the amino acids that form CBP include a strip of 18 glutamines.  Thus, the glutamines on CBP interact directly with the increased numbers of glutamine on the Htt chain and CBP gets pulled away from its typical location next to the nucleus.<ref name="urlAnalysis of Strand Slippage in DNA Polymerase Expansions of CAG/CTG Triplet Repeats Associated with Neurodegenerative Disease — JBC">{{cite web |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/273/9/5204.long |title=Analysis of Strand Slippage in DNA Polymerase Expansions of CAG/CTG Triplet Repeats Associated with Neurodegenerative Disease — JBC |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Specifically, CRB contains an acetyltransferase domain that, in an experiment performed by Steffan and colleagues, showed that a Htt exon 1 with 51 glutamines bound to this domain in CBP.<ref name="urlNature Clinical Practice Neurology | Mechanisms of Disease: histone modifications in Huntingtons disease | Article"/> Autopsied brains of those who had Huntington's disease also have been found to have incredibly reduced amounts of CBP.<ref name="urlAnalysis of Strand Slippage in DNA Polymerase Expansions of CAG/CTG Triplet Repeats Associated with Neurodegenerative Disease — JBC" /> In addition, when CBP is overexpressed, polyglutamine-induced death is diminished, further demonstrating that CBP plays an important role in Huntington's disease and neurons in general.<ref name="urlNature Clinical Practice Neurology | Mechanisms of Disease: histone modifications in Huntingtons disease | Article"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Medical diagnosis]] of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease.<ref name="lancet218"/> Genetic testing can be used to confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or [[embryo]] carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the ''HTT'' gene that causes the disease. [[Genetic counseling]] is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.<ref name="lancet221"/>

A [[physical examination]], sometimes combined with a [[psychological examination]], can determine whether the onset of the disease has begun.<ref name="lancet218"/> Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body are often the reason for seeking medical consultation. If these are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, they suggest a diagnosis of HD. Cognitive or psychiatric symptoms are rarely the first diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further.

===Genetic===
{{See also|Genetic testing}}
Because HD follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, there is a strong motivation for individuals who are at risk of inheriting it to seek a diagnosis. The genetic test for HD consists of a [[Genetic testing|blood test]] which counts the numbers of CAG repeats in each of the ''HTT'' alleles.<ref name="pmid15717026">{{cite journal |author=Myers RH |title=Huntington's Disease Genetics |journal=NeuroRx |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=255–62 |year=2004 |pmid=15717026 |pmc=534940 |doi=10.1602/neurorx.1.2.255 }}</ref> A positive result is not considered a diagnosis, since it may be obtained decades before the symptoms begin. However, a negative test means that the individual does not carry the expanded copy of the gene and will not develop HD.<ref name="lancet220"/>

A [[wiktionary:pre-symptomatic|pre-symptomatic]] test is a life-changing event and a very personal decision.<ref name="lancet220"/> The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions.<ref name="lancet220"/> Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment.<ref name="lancet220"/> A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result.<ref name="lancet221"/> Irrespective of the result, stress levels have been found to be lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result.<ref name="lancet221"/> Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience [[survivor guilt]] with regard to family members who are affected.<ref name="lancet221"/> Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it.<ref name="lancet221"/> [[Genetic counseling]] in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the testing process.<ref name="geneticcounselling">{{cite journal |author=Burson CM, Markey KR |title=Genetic counseling issues in predictive genetic testing for familial adult-onset neurologic diseases |journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=177–86 |year=2001 |pmid=11575847 |doi=10.1053/spen.2001.26451 }}</ref>

===Preimplantation genetic diagnosis===
[[Embryo]]s produced using [[in vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] may be genetically tested for HD using [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4 to 8 cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis — non-disclosure or exclusion testing — allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring ''without'' revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is compared with that of the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schulman JD, Black SH, Handyside A, Nance WE |title=Preimplantation genetic testing for Huntington disease and certain other dominantly inherited disorders |journal=Clinical Genetics |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=57–58 |year=1996 |pmid=8740912 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.1996.tb04327.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Stern HJ, Harton GL, Sisson ME, Jones SL, Fallon LA, Thorsell LP, Gettlinger ME, Black SH, Schulman JD |title=Non-disclosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis for Huntington disease |journal=Prenatal Diagnosis |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=503–507 |year=2002 |pmid=12116316 |doi=10.1002/pd.359}}</ref>

===Prenatal testing===
It is also possible to obtain a [[prenatal diagnosis]] for an embryo or [[fetus]] in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through [[chorionic villus sampling]]. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing is performed on the understanding that if the fetus is found to carry an expanded ''HTT'' gene (or, in exclusion testing, found to be at 'high risk'), the pregnancy will be [[Termination of pregnancy|terminated]].<ref name="pmid15758612">{{cite journal |author=Kuliev A, Verlinsky Y |title=Preimplantation diagnosis: A realistic option for assisted reproduction and genetic practice |journal=Curr.

Although Huntington's has been recognized as a disorder since at least the [[Middle Ages]], the cause has been unknown until fairly recently. Huntington's was given different names throughout this history as understanding of the disease changed. Originally called simply 'chorea' for the jerky dancelike movements associated with the disease, HD has also been called "hereditary chorea" and "chronic progressive chorea".<ref>{{cite book | chapter=Huntington Disease | editor=Karen Bellenir | title= Genetic Disorders Sourcebook | edition=3rd | publisher=Omnigraphics | location=Detroit | year=2004 | pages=159–179 | isbn=0-7808-0742-1}}</ref> The first definite mention of HD was in a letter by [[Charles Oscar Waters]], published in the first edition of [[Robley Dunglison]]'s ''Practice of Medicine'' in 1842.

The first thorough description of the disease was by [[George Huntington]] in 1872. Examining the combined medical history of several generations of a family exhibiting similar symptoms, he realized their conditions must be linked; he presented his detailed and accurate definition of the disease as his first paper. Huntington described the exact pattern of inheritance of autosomal dominant disease years before the rediscovery by scientists of [[Mendelian inheritance]].<blockquote>"Of its hereditary nature. When either or both the parents have shown manifestations of the disease&nbsp;..., one or more of the offspring almost invariably suffer from the disease&nbsp;...

During the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance at the turn of the 20th century, HD was used tentatively as an example of autosomal dominant inheritance.<ref name="OxfordMonographHistory"/> The English biologist [[William Bateson]] used the pedigrees of affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.<ref name="Wexler2008"/> The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers, including [[Smith Ely Jelliffe]], to attempt to trace and connect family members of previous studies.<ref name="OxfordMonographHistory"/> Jelliffe collected information from across [[New York State]] and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in [[New England]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jelliffe SE, Muncey EB, Davenport CB |title=Huntington's Chorea: A Study in Heredity |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=40|issue=12 |page=796 |year=1913|doi= 10.1097/00005053-191312000-00010|url=http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1913/12000/Huntington_s_Chorea__A_Study_in_Heredity.10.aspx }}</ref> Jelliffe's research roused the interest of his college friend, [[Charles Davenport]], who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field study on the [[East Coast of the United States]] of families with HD and to construct their pedigrees.<ref name="davenportmuncey">{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.73.2.195 |author=Davenport CB, Muncey EB |title=Huntington's chorea in relation to heredity and eugenics |journal=American Journal of Insanity|volume=73 |pages=195–222 |year=1916 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/73/2/195 |issue=2}}</ref> Davenport used this information to document the variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD; he claimed that most cases of HD in the USA could be traced back to a handful of individuals.<ref name="davenportmuncey"/> This research was further embellished in 1932 by [[P.

The search for the cause of this condition was enhanced considerably in 1968 when the [[Hereditary Disease Foundation]] (HDF) was created by [[Milton Wexler]], a [[psychoanalyst]] based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] whose wife Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntingdon's disease.<ref name=Wexler2012>Wexler NS (2012) Huntington's Disease: Advocacy driving science. Annu Rev Med 63:1-22</ref> The three brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease. The foundation was involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the [[Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project]] who over a 10 year period worked to locate the responsible gene.

Thanks to the HDF, the ongoing US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project was started in 1979, and reported a major breakthrough in 1983 with the discovery of the approximate location of a causal gene.<ref name="dnamark"/> This was the result of an extensive study focusing on the populations of two isolated Venezuelan villages, Barranquitas and Lagunetas, where there was an unusually high prevalence of the disease.

Modelling the disease in various types of animals, such as the [[transgenic]] mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments. As these animals have faster [[metabolism]]s and much shorter lifespans than humans, results from experiments are received sooner, speeding research. The 1997 discovery that mHtt fragments [[Protein folding|misfold]] led to the discovery of the [[Inclusion bodies|nuclear inclusions]] they cause. These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.<ref name="OxfordMonographHistory"/><ref name=ross-tabrizi />

The condition was formerly called 'Huntington's chorea', but this term has been replaced by 'Huntington's disease', because not all patients develop chorea, and because of the importance of cognitive and behavioral problems.<ref name=huntchorea>{{cite web|title=What is HD?|url=http://www.hda.org.uk/huntingtons/what-is-hd.html|publisher=Huntington's disease association|accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>

Huntington's disease, particularly the application of the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when [[Charles Davenport]] proposed in 1910 that [[compulsory sterilization]] and [[immigration]] control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the [[eugenics]] movement.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davenport CB |title=Huntington's Chorea in Relation to Heredity and Eugenics |journal=Proc.

Although the United Kingdom's insurance companies have agreed that until 2014 they will not use genetic information when writing most insurance policies,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7452909.stm |title= BBC article: Genetic data banned for insurers|accessdate=2008-08-10 |work= |publisher=BBC |date=2008-06-13 }}</ref> Huntington's is explicitly excluded from this agreement.<ref name="Expert backs gene test disclosure">{{cite news|title=Expert backs gene test disclosure|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6731623.stm|publisher=BBC article | date=2007-06-07}}</ref>  As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under [[legal age]] who is not judged to be [[Gillick competence|competent]] is considered unethical in most cases.<ref name="pmid2136787"/><ref name="pmid8950670">{{cite journal |author=Binedell J, Soldan JR, Scourfield J, Harper PS |title=Huntington's disease predictive testing: the case for an assessment approach to requests from adolescents |journal=J.

In 1968, after experiencing HD in his wife's family, Dr. Milton Wexler was inspired to start the [[Hereditary Disease Foundation]] (HDF), with the aim of curing genetic illnesses by coordinating and supporting research.<ref name="HDF-About Us">{{cite web |url=http://www.hdfoundation.org/aboutus.php |title=Hereditary Disease Foundation – About Us|year= 2008|work= |publisher=Hereditary disease foundation|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref> The foundation and Dr. Wexler's daughter, [[Nancy Wexler]], were key parts of the research team in Venezuela which discovered the HD gene.<ref name="HDF-About Us"/>

At roughly the same time as the HDF formed, [[Marjorie Guthrie]] helped to found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease (now the [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]]), after her husband [[Woody Guthrie]] died from complications of HD.<ref name="HDSA-History">{{cite web |url=http://www.hdsa.org/about/hdsa-history.html |title=Huntington's Disease Society of America – History |year=2008|publisher=Huntington's Disease Society of America |accessdate=2009-03-17}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Since then, support and research organizations have formed in many countries around the world and have helped to increase public awareness of HD. A number of these collaborate in umbrella organizations, like the International Huntington Association and the [[European Huntington's Disease Network|European HD network]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huntington-assoc.com/ihapro.htm |title=IHA Profile |accessdate=2009-04-03 |publisher=International Huntington Association |year=2004 }}</ref> Many support organizations hold an annual HD awareness event, some of which have been endorsed by their respective governments.

Many organizations exist to support and inform those affected by HD: see the [[Huntington's disease#External links|External Links]] section below.

==Research directions==
{{See also|Huntington's disease clinical research}}

Research into the mechanism of HD has focused on identifying the functioning of Htt, how mHtt differs or interferes with it, and the brain pathology that the disease produces. Research is conducted using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods, animal models and human volunteers. Animal models are critical for understanding the fundamental mechanisms causing the disease and for supporting the early stages of [[drug development]].<ref name=ross-tabrizi /> Animals with chemically induced brain injury exhibit HD-like symptoms and were initially used, but they did not mimic the progressive features of the disease.<ref name=turner-excitotoxicity>{{cite journal|author=Turner C, Schapira AH |title=Mitochondrial matters of the brain: the role in Huntington's disease|journal=Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes|year=2010|volume=42|issue=3|pages=193–8|doi=10.1007/s10863-010-9290-y|pmid=20480217}}</ref>  The identification of the causative gene has enabled the development of many [[transgenic animal]] models including [[nematode]] worms, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|Drosophila]]'' [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], mice, rats, sheep, pigs and monkeys that express mutant huntingtin and develop progressive [[neurodegeneration]] and HD-like symptoms.<ref name=ross-tabrizi>{{cite journal|author=Ross CA, Tabrizi SJ|title=Huntington's disease: from molecular pathogenesis to clinical treatment|journal=Lancet neurology|date=2011 Jan|volume=10|issue=1|pages=83–98|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(10)70245-3|pmid=21163446}}</ref> 

Three broad approaches are under study to attempt to slow the progression of Huntington's disease: reducing production of the mutant protein, improving cells' ability to survive its diverse harmful effects, and replacing lost neurons.<ref name=munoz-bates-jci>{{cite journal|author=Munoz-Sanjuan I, Bates GP |title=The importance of integrating basic and clinical research toward the development of new therapies for Huntington disease|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|year=2011|volume=121|issue=2|pages=476–483|doi=10.1172/JCI45364|pmid=21285520|pmc=3026740}}</ref>

===Reducing huntingtin production===
[[Gene silencing]] aims to reduce the production of the mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHtt is reduced, symptoms improve.<ref name=munoz-bates-jci /> Safety of gene silencing has now been demonstrated in the large, human-like brains of primates.<ref>{{cite journal|author=McBride JL, Pitzer MR, Boudreau RL et al |title=Preclinical Safety of RNAi-Mediated HTT Suppression in the Rhesus Macaque as a Potential Therapy for Huntington's Disease|journal=Molecular Therapy |date=25 October 2011 |volume=19|issue=12|pages=2152–2162|doi=10.1038/mt.2011.219|pmid=22031240|pmc=3242667}}</ref>

===Improving cell survival===
Among the approaches aimed at improving cell survival in the presence of mutant huntingtin are correction of [[transcriptional regulation]] using [[histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s, modulating [[Protein aggregation|aggregation]] of huntingtin, improving [[metabolism]] and [[Mitochondria|mitochondrial function]] and restoring dysfunction of [[synapses]].<ref name=munoz-bates-jci />

===Neuronal replacement===
[[Stem cell treatments|Stem cell therapy]] is the replacement of damaged neurons by transplantation of [[stem cell]]s into affected regions of the brain. Experiments have yielded mixed results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human [[clinical trial]]s.<ref name="pmid18341412">{{cite journal |author=Clelland CD, Barker RA, Watts C |title=Cell therapy in Huntington disease |journal=Neurosurg Focus |volume=24 |issue=3–4 |page=E9 |year=2008 |pmid=18341412 |doi=10.3171/FOC/2008/24/3-4/E8 }}</ref> Whatever their future therapeutic potential, stem cells are already a valuable tool for studying HD in the laboratory.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cundiff PE, Anderson SA |title=Impact of induced pluripotent stem cells on the study of central nervous system disease|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics & Development|date=31 May 2011|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–361|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2011.01.008|pmid= 21277194}}</ref>

===Clinical trials===
Numerous drugs have been reported to produce benefits in animals, including [[creatine]], [[coenzyme Q10]] and the antibiotic [[minocycline]]. Some of these have then been tested by humans in clinical trials, with more underway, but as yet none has proven effective.<ref name="lancet225"/> In 2010, minocycline was found to be ineffective for humans in a multi-center trial.<ref name="pmid20721920">{{cite journal |author=Schwarz H, Hickey C, Zimmerman C et al|title=A futility study of minocycline in Huntington's disease |journal=Mov.
