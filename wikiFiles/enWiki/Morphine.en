'''Morphine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|ɔr|f|iː|n}}; '''MS Contin''', '''MSIR''', '''Avinza''', '''Kadian''', '''Oramorph''', '''Roxanol''', '''Kapanol''') is a [[Potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[opiate]] [[analgesic]] [[drug]] that is used to relieve severe pain. It was first isolated in 1804 by [[Friedrich Sertürner]], first distributed by him in 1817, and first commercially sold by [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] in 1827, which at the time was a single small chemists' shop. It was more widely used after the invention of the [[hypodermic needle]] in 1857. It took its name from the Greek god of dreams [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]] ({{lang-el|''Μορφεύς''}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=William|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|year=2007|publisher=I. B. Tauris; 1 edition|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=1-84511-002-1}}</ref>

After it was isolated from opium by Sertürner, the traditional way to obtain morphine had been by chemical processing of opium. In India, opium harvested by licensed poppy farmers is dehydrated to uniform levels of hydration at government processing centers, and then sold to pharmaceutical companies, which extract morphine from the opium. However in Turkey and Tasmania morphine is obtained by harvesting and processing the fully mature dry seed pods, with attached stalks, called ''poppy straw''. By not harvesting opium at all, and by obtaining morphine only from the dry poppy straw, and not from opium, and by using a large scale industrial process to do so, at factories located near the poppy farms, opportunities for illicitly diverting opium from the crop, and for illicit production of morphine, and heroin from the opium, are reduced. In Turkey, a water extraction process is used. In Tasmania, a solvent extraction process is used.

Morphine is the most abundant opiate found in [[opium]], the dried [[latex]] extracted by shallowly slicing the unripe seedpods of the ''[[Papaver somniferum]]'' poppy. Morphine was the first [[active principle]] purified from a plant source and is one of at least 50 alkaloids of several different types present in opium, [[poppy straw concentrate]], and other poppy derivatives. Morphine is generally 8 to 14 percent of the dry weight of opium,<ref name=Kapoor>{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=L.|title=Opium Poppy: Botany, Chemistry, and Pharmacology|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|location=United States|isbn=1-56024-923-4|pages=164}}</ref> although specially bred [[cultivar]]s reach 26 percent or produce little morphine at all (under 1 percent, perhaps down to 0.04 percent). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, [[thebaine]] and [[oripavine]], which are used in the manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like [[oxycodone]] and [[etorphine]] and some other types of drugs. ''[[Papaver bracteatum|P. bracteatum]]'' does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic [[phenanthrene]]-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of [[thebaine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vincent|first=PG|coauthors=C. E. Bare, W. A. Gentner|title=Thebaine content of selections of papaver bracteatum Lindl. at different ages|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|year=1977|month=December|volume=66|issue=12|pages=1716–1719|doi=10.1002/jps.2600661215|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jps.2600661215/abstract|accessdate=29 April 2012|pmid=925935}}</ref> Occurrence of morphine in other [[Papaverales]] and [[Papaveraceae]], as well as in some species of [[hops]] and [[mulberry]] trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce [[codeine]], [[thebaine]], and in some cases negligible amounts of [[hydromorphone]], [[dihydromorphine]], [[dihydrocodeine]], tetrahydro-thebaine, and [[hydrocodone]] (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and oripavine). The human body produces [[endorphins]],<ref>Websters Dictionary – http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endorphin</ref> which are [[endogenous]] [[opioid]] [[peptide]]s that function as [[neurotransmitters]] and have similar effects.<ref>Oswald Steward: ''Functional neuroscience'' (2000), page 116.

In clinical medicine, morphine is regarded as the gold standard, or benchmark, of opioid analgesics used to relieve severe or agonizing [[pain]] and [[suffering]]. Like other opioids, such as [[oxycodone]], [[hydromorphone]], and diacetylmorphine ([[heroin]]), morphine acts directly on the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) to relieve [[pain]].

Morphine has a high potential for [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]; [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[psychological]] [[substance dependence|dependence]] develop rapidly, although [[Physical property|physiological]] dependence may take several months to develop. Tolerance to respiratory depression and euphoria develops more rapidly than tolerance to analgesia, and many chronic pain patients are being maintained on a stable dose, for many years.

Morphine is also used in slow release formulations for opiate substitution therapy (OST) in Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovenia, for addicts who cannot tolerate the side effects of using either methadone or [[buprenorphine]], or for addicts who are "not held" by buprenorphine or methadone. It is used for OST in many parts of Europe although on a limited basis.<ref name="NEPOD Report">Richard P.

==Adverse effects==
[[File:MorphineRx.JPG|thumb|A localized reaction to intravenous morphine caused by histamine release in the veins.]]

===Constipation===
Like [[loperamide]] and other opioids, morphine acts on the [[myenteric plexus]] in the intestinal tract, reducing gut motility, causing constipation. The gastrointestinal effects of morphine are mediated primarily by [[mu Opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptors]] in the bowel. By inhibiting gastric emptying and reducing propulsive [[peristalsis]] of the intestine, morphine decreases the rate of intestinal transit. Reduction in gut secretion and increased intestinal fluid absorption also contribute to the constipating effect. Opioids also may act on the gut indirectly through tonic gut spasms after inhibition of [[nitric oxide]] generation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stefano|first=GB|title=Morphine enhances nitric oxide release in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract via the micro(3) opiate receptor subtype: a hormonal role for endogenous morphine|journal=Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology|volume=55|issue=1 Pt 2|pages=279–288|date=March 2004|pmid=15082884|last2=Zhu|first2=W|last3=Cadet|first3=P|last4=Bilfinger|first4=TV|last5=Mantione|first5=K}}</ref> This effect was shown in animals when a nitric oxide precursor, [[L-Arginine]], reversed morphine-induced changes in gut motility.<ref name="Calignano, Moncada and Di Rosa">{{cite journal |author=Calignano A, Moncada S, Di Rosa M |title=Endogenous nitric oxide modulates morphine-induced constipation |journal=Biochem.

===Addiction===
Morphine is a potentially highly [[Substance use disorder|addictive]] substance. It can cause [[Substance dependence|psychological dependence]] and [[physical dependence]] as well as [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]]. In the presence of pain and the other disorders for which morphine is indicated, a combination of psychological and physiological factors tend to prevent true addiction from developing, although physical dependence and tolerance will develop with protracted opioid therapy.

In controlled studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of injected heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opiates, subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent, injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness.<ref name="martin and fraser" /> Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids [[hydromorphone]], [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], and [[pethidine]]/[[meperidine]], former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also much more likely to produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids.<ref name="martin and fraser" /> The choice of heroin and morphine over other opioids by former-drug addicts may also be the result of the fact that heroin (also known as ''morphine diacetate'', ''diamorphine'' or ''di-acetyl-morphine'') is an ester of morphine and a morphine [[prodrug]], essentially meaning that they are identical drugs ''in vivo''. Heroin is converted to morphine before binding to the [[opioid receptor]]s in the brain and spinal cord, where morphine then causes the subjective effects, which is what the addicted individuals are ultimately looking for.<ref>[http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/heroin.html National Institute on Drug Abuse]</ref>

Other studies, such as the [[Rat Park]] experiments, suggest that morphine is less physically addictive than others suggest, and most studies on morphine addiction merely show that "severely distressed animals, like severely distressed people, will relieve their distress [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] if they can."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weissman DE, Haddox JD |title=Opioid pseudoaddiction-an iatrogenic syndrome |journal=Pain |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=363–6 |year=1989 |pmid=2710565 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(89)90097-3}}</ref> In these studies, rats with a morphine "addiction" overcome their addiction themselves when placed in decent living environments with enough space, good food, companionship, areas for exercise, and areas for privacy. More recent research has shown that an [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|enriched environment]] may decrease morphine addiction in mice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xu Z, Hou B, Gao Y, He F, Zhang C |title=Effects of enriched environment on morphine-induced reward in mice |journal=Exp. Neurol. |volume=204 |issue=2 |pages=714–9 |year=2007|pmid=17331503 |doi=10.1016/j.expneurol.2006.12.027}}</ref>

===Tolerance===
Tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine is fairly rapid{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. There are several hypotheses about how tolerance develops, including opioid receptor [[phosphorylation]] (which would change the receptor conformation), functional decoupling of receptors from [[G-proteins]] (leading to receptor desensitization),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Roshanpour M, Ghasemi M, Riazi K, Rafiei-Tabatabaei N, Ghahremani MH, Dehpour AR |title=Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of morphine in mice: blockage by ultra-low dose naltrexone |journal=Epilepsy Res. |volume=83 |issue=2–3 |pages=261–4 |year=2009|pmid=19059761 |doi=10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2008.10.011}}</ref> μ-opioid receptor internalization and/or receptor down-regulation (reducing the number of available receptors for morphine to act on), and upregulation of the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] pathway (a counterregulatory mechanism to opioid effects) (For a review of these processes, see Koch and Hollt.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koch T, Höllt V |title=Role of receptor internalization in opioid tolerance and dependence |journal=Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=199–206 |year=2008|pmid=18076994 |doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.10.003}}</ref>) [[Cholecystokinin|CCK]] might mediate some counter-regulatory pathways responsible for opioid tolerance. CCK-antagonist drugs, specifically [[proglumide]], have been shown to slow the development of tolerance to morphine.

===Withdrawal===
{{See also|Opioid withdrawal}}
Cessation of dosing with morphine creates the prototypical opioid withdrawal syndrome, which, unlike that of [[barbiturates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[alcohol]], or sedative-hypnotics, is not fatal by itself in neurologically healthy patients without heart or lung problems.

Acute morphine along with and other opioid withdrawal proceeds through a number of stages. Other opioids differ in the intensity and length of each, and weak opioids and mixed agonist-antagonists may have acute withdrawal syndromes that do not reach the highest level. As commonly cited{{by whom|date=November 2010}}, they are:
* '''Stage I''': Six to fourteen hours after last dose: Drug craving, anxiety, irritability, perspiration, and mild to moderate [[dysphoria]].
* '''Stage II''': Fourteen to eighteen hours after last dose: Yawning, heavy perspiration, mild depression lacrimation, crying, running nose, [[dysphoria]], also intensification of the above symptoms. "yen sleep" (a waking trance-like state) {{clarify|date=October 2010}}
* '''Stage III''': Sixteen to twenty-four hours after last dose: [[Rhinorrhea]] (runny nose) and increase in other of the above, dilated pupils, piloerection (goose bumps), muscle twitches, hot flashes, cold flashes, aching bones and muscles, loss of appetite and the beginning of intestinal cramping.
* '''Stage IV''': Twenty-four to thirty-six hours after last dose: Increase in all of the above including severe cramping and involuntary leg movements ("kicking the habit"), loose stool, insomnia, elevation of blood pressure, moderate elevation in body temperature, increase in frequency of breathing and tidal volume, [[tachycardia]] (elevated pulse), restlessness, nausea
* '''Stage V''': Thirty-six to seventy-two hours after last dose: Increase in the above, fetal position, vomiting, free and frequent liquid diarrhea, which sometimes can accelerate the time of passage of food from mouth to out of system to an hour or less, weight loss of two to five kilos per 24 hours, increased [[White blood cell|white cell count]] and other blood changes.
* '''Stage VI''': After completion of above: Recovery of appetite ("the chucks"), and normal bowel function, beginning of transition to post-acute and chronic symptoms that are mainly psychological but that may also include increased sensitivity to pain, hypertension, [[colitis]] or other gastrointestinal afflictions related to motility, and problems with weight control in either direction.

The withdrawal symptoms associated with morphine addiction are usually experienced shortly before the time of the next scheduled dose, sometimes within as early as a few hours (usually between 6–12 hours) after the last administration. Early symptoms include watery eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, runny nose, yawning, [[dysphoria]], sweating and in some cases a strong drug craving. Severe headache, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tremors, and even stronger and more intense drug craving appear as the ome progresses. Severe depression and vomiting are very common. During the acute withdrawal period systolic and diastolic blood pressure increase, usually beyond pre-morphine levels, and heart rate increases,<ref name="Chan, Irvine, and White">{{cite journal |author=Chan R, Irvine R, White J |title=Cardiovascular changes during morphine administration and spontaneous withdrawal in the rat |journal=Eur. J. Pharmacol. |volume=368 |issue=1 |pages=25–33 |year=1999 |pmid=10096766 |doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00984-4}}</ref> which have potential to cause a heart attack, blood clot, or stroke.

Chills or cold flashes with goose bumps ("cold turkey") alternating with flushing (hot flashes), kicking movements of the legs ("kicking the habit"<ref>[http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/heroin.html Heroin Information from the National Institute on Drug Abuse]</ref>) and excessive sweating are also characteristic symptoms.<ref>[http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/People/injury/research/job185drugs/morphine.htm Drugs and Human Performance FACT SHEETS – Morphine (and Heroin)]</ref> Severe pains in the bones and muscles of the back and extremities occur, as do muscle spasms. At any point during this process, a suitable narcotic can be administered that will dramatically reverse the withdrawal symptoms. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 96 hours after the last dose and subside after about 8 to 12 days. Sudden withdrawal by heavily dependent users who are in poor health is very rarely fatal. Morphine withdrawal is considered less dangerous than alcohol, barbiturate, or benzodiazepine withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/narcotics.html DEA Briefs & Background, Drugs and Drug Abuse, Drug Descriptions, Narcotics]</ref><ref>{{Cite book

The psychological dependence associated with morphine [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] is complex and protracted. Long after the physical need for morphine has passed, the addict will usually continue to think and talk about the use of morphine (or other drugs) and feel strange or overwhelmed coping with daily activities without being under the influence of morphine. Psychological withdrawal from morphine is a very long and painful process.<ref>[http://opioids.com/morphine/depression.html Morphine withdrawal and depression]</ref> Addicts often suffer severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, amnesia (forgetfulness), low self-esteem, confusion, paranoia, and other psychological disorders. Without intervention, the syndrome will run its course, and most of the overt physical symptoms will disappear within 7 to 10 days including psychological dependence. There is a high probability that relapse will occur after morphine withdrawal when neither the physical environment nor the behavioral motivators that contributed to the abuse have been altered. Testimony to morphine's addictive and reinforcing nature is its relapse rate. Abusers of morphine (and heroin) have one of the highest relapse rates among all drug users, ranging up to 98 per cent in the estimation of some clinicians, neuropharmacologists, mental health/[[AODA]] professionals and other medical experts.<ref>O'Neal, Maryadele J. Merck Index: An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals. Merck. October 18, 2006.</ref>

===Overdose===
A large [[overdose]] can cause [[asphyxia]] and death by respiratory depression if the person does not receive medical attention immediately.<ref name=Duldner>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002502.htm MedlinePlus – Morphine overdose] Update Date: 2/3/2009. Updated by: John E. Duldner, Jr., MD</ref> Overdose treatment includes the administration of [[naloxone]]. The latter completely reverses morphine's effects, but precipitates immediate onset of withdrawal in opiate-addicted subjects. Multiple doses may be needed.<ref name=Duldner/>

The minimum lethal dose is 200&nbsp;mg but in case of hypersensitivity 60&nbsp;mg can bring sudden death. In case of drug addiction, 2–3 g/day can be tolerated.<ref>L. Macchiarelli P. Arbarello G.

==Contraindications==
The following conditions are relative [[contraindication]]s for morphine:
* acute [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depression]]
* [[renal failure]] (due to accumulation of the metabolites morphine-3-glucuronide and [[morphine-6-glucuronide]])
* chemical [[toxicity]] (potentially lethal in low tolerance subjects)

==Pharmacology==
{{Main|Opioid receptor}}

Endogenous opioids include [[endorphin]]s, [[enkephalin]]s, [[dynorphin]]s, and even morphine itself. Morphine appears to mimic endorphins. Endorphins, a contraction of the term endogenous morphines, are responsible for [[analgesia]] (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement.

Morphine is the prototype narcotic drug and is the standard against which all other opioids are tested. It interacts predominantly with the [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] receptor. These μ-binding sites are discretely distributed in the [[human brain]], with high densities in the posterior [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[thalamus]], [[nucleus caudatus]], [[putamen]], and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the [[chemical synapse|terminal axons]] of primary afferents within laminae [[posteromarginal nucleus|I]] and II ([[substantia gelatinosa of Rolando|substantia gelatinosa]]) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the [[trigeminal nerve]].<ref name="rxlist.com">[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/ms_cp.htm MS-Contin (Morphine) clinical pharmacology – prescription drugs and medications at RxList]</ref>

Morphine is a [[phenanthrene]] [[opioid receptor]] [[receptor agonist|agonist]]&nbsp;– its main effect is binding to and activating the [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptors]] in the [[central nervous system]]. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], physical [[Chemical dependency|dependence]], and [[respiratory depression]]. Morphine is a rapid-acting narcotic, and it is known to bind very strongly to the [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] receptors, and for this reason, it often has a higher incidence of euphoria/dysphoria, respiratory depression, sedation, pruritus, tolerance, and physical and psychological dependence when compared to other opioids at equianalgesic doses. Morphine is also a [[kappa opioid receptor|κ-opioid]] and [[delta opioid receptor|δ-opioid]] receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, [[miosis]] (pinpoint pupils) and [[psychotomimetic]] effects. δ-opioid is thought to play a role in analgesia.<ref name="rxlist.com" /> Although morphine does not bind to the [[sigma receptor|σ-receptor]], it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-[[pentazocine]], antagonize morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chien CC, Pasternak GW |title=Sigma antagonists potentiate opioid analgesia in rats |journal=Neurosci. Lett. |volume=190 |issue=2 |pages=137–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7644123 |doi=10.1016/0304-3940(95)11504-P}}</ref> suggesting some interaction between morphine and the σ-opioid receptor.

The effects of morphine can be countered with opioid [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]] such as [[naloxone]] and [[naltrexone]]; the development of tolerance to morphine may be inhibited by [[NMDA]] antagonists such as [[ketamine]] or [[dextromethorphan]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Herman BH, Vocci F, Bridge P |title=The effects of NMDA receptor antagonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors on opioid tolerance and withdrawal. Medication development issues for opiate addiction |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=269–93 |year=1995 |pmid=8747752 |doi=10.1016/0893-133X(95)00140-9}}</ref> The rotation of morphine with chemically dissimilar opioids in the long-term treatment of pain will slow down the growth of tolerance in the longer run, particularly agents known to have significantly incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine such as [[levorphanol]], [[ketobemidone]], [[piritramide]], and [[methadone]] and its derivatives; all of these drugs also have NMDA antagonist properties. It is believed that the strong opioid with the most incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine is either methadone or [[dextromoramide]].

===Gene expression===
Studies have shown that morphine can alter the expression of a number of [[genes]]. A single injection of morphine has been shown to alter the expression of two major groups of genes, for proteins involved in [[mitochondrial]] respiration and for [[cytoskeleton]]-related proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loguinov A, Anderson L, Crosby G, Yukhananov R |title=Gene expression following acute morphine administration |journal=Physiol Genomics |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=169–81 |year=2001 |pmid=11526201}}</ref>

===Effects on the immune system===
Morphine has long been known to act on receptors expressed on cells of the [[central nervous system]] resulting in pain relief and [[analgesia]]. In the 1970s and '80s, evidence suggesting that opiate drug addicts show increased risk of infection (such as increased [[pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]) led scientists to believe that morphine may also affect the [[immune system]]. This possibility increased interest in the effect of chronic morphine use on the immune system.

The first step of determining that morphine may affect the immune system was to establish that the opiate receptors known to be expressed on cells of the central nervous system are also expressed on cells of the immune system. One study successfully showed that [[dendritic cells]], part of the innate immune system, display opiate receptors. Dendritic cells are responsible for producing [[cytokine]]s, which are the tools for communication in the immune system. This same study showed that dendritic cells chronically treated with morphine during their differentiation produce more [[interleukin-12]] (IL-12), a cytokine responsible for promoting the proliferation, growth, and differentiation of T-cells (another cell of the adaptive immune system) and less [[interleukin-10]] (IL-10), a cytokine responsible for promoting a B-cell immune response (B cells produce antibodies to fight off infection).<ref name="messmer 2006">{{cite journal |author=Messmer D, Hatsukari I, Hitosugi N, Schmidt-Wolf IG, Singhal PC |title=Morphine reciprocally regulates IL-10 and IL-12 production by monocyte-derived human dendritic cells and enhances T cell activation |journal=Mol. Med. |volume=12 |issue=11–12 |pages=284–90 |year=2006 |pmid=17380193 |pmc=1829197 |doi=10.2119/2006-00043.Messmer}}</ref>

This regulation of cytokines appear to occur via the [[p38 MAPK pathway|p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent pathway]]. Usually, the p38 within the dendritic cell expresses [[TLR 4]] (toll-like receptor 4), which is activated through the ligand LPS ([[lipopolysaccharide]]). This causes the p38 MAPK to be [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]]. This phosphorylation activates the [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 MAPK]] to begin producing IL-10 and IL-12. When the dendritic cells are chronically exposed to morphine during their differentiation process then treated with LPS, the production of cytokines is different. Once treated with morphine, the p38 MAPK does not produce IL-10, instead favoring production of IL-12. The exact mechanism through which the production of one cytokine is increased in favor over another is not known. Most likely, the morphine causes increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Transcriptional level interactions between IL-10 and IL-12 may further increase the production of IL-12 once IL-10 is not being produced.  This increased production of IL-12 causes increased T-cell immune response.

Further studies on the effects of morphine on the immune system have shown that morphine influences the production of [[neutrophils]] and other [[cytokines]]. Since cytokines are produced as part of the immediate immunological response ([[inflammation]]), it has been suggested that they may also influence pain. In this way, cytokines may be a logical target for analgesic development. Recently, one study has used an animal model (hind-paw incision) to observe the effects of morphine administration on the acute immunological response. Following hind-paw incision, pain thresholds and cytokine production were measured. Normally, cytokine production in and around the wounded area increases in order to fight [[infection]] and control healing (and, possibly, to control pain), but pre-incisional morphine administration (0.1-10.0&nbsp;mg/kg) reduced the number of cytokines found around the wound in a dose-dependent manner. The authors suggest that morphine administration in the acute post-injury period may reduce resistance to infection and may impair the healing of the wound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clark JD, Shi X, Li X, ''et al.'' |title=Morphine reduces local cytokine expression and neutrophil infiltration after incision |journal=Mol Pain |volume=3 |pages=28 |year=2007 |pmid=17908329 |pmc=2096620 |doi=10.1186/1744-8069-3-28}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption and metabolism===
Morphine can be taken orally, [[Sublingual administration|sublingually]], [[Buccal space|bucally]], rectally, [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]], [[intravenous]]ly, [[intrathecal]]ly or [[epidural]]ly and inhaled via a nebulizer. On the streets, it is becoming more common to inhale (“[[Chasing the Dragon]]"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection is the most common method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive [[first-pass metabolism]] (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40–50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20 minutes, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trescot AM, Datta S, Lee M, Hansen H |title=Opioid pharmacology |journal=Pain Physician |volume=11 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=S133–53 |year=2008 |pmid=18443637}}</ref> Morphine is [[metabolised]] primarily in the [[liver]] and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the [[urine]] within 72 hours of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into [[morphine-3-glucuronide]] (M3G) and [[morphine-6-glucuronide]] (M6G)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kilpatrick G.J. and Smith T.W.|title=Morphine-6-glucuronide: actions and mechanisms|journal=Med. Res. Rev.|year=2005|volume=25|issue=5|pages=521–544|pmid=15952175|doi=10.1002/med.20035}}</ref> via [[glucuronidation]] by phase II metabolism enzyme [[UGT2B7|UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7]] (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6–10% is converted to M6G.<ref name="van Dorp" /> Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo opioid receptor binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans.<ref name="van Dorp">{{cite journal|author=van Dorp EL, Romberg R, Sarton E, Bovill JG, Dahan A|title=Morphine-6-glucuronide: morphine's successor for postoperative pain relief?|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1789–1797|pmid=16717327|url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/content/full/102/6/1789|doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000217197.96784.c3|year=2006}}</ref> Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of [[normorphine]], [[codeine]], and [[hydromorphone]]. Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, disease state (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination [[half-life]] of morphine is approximately 120 minutes, though there may be slight differences between men and women. Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine is able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily. [[Diacetylmorphine]], which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.<ref name="Jenkins AJ 2008">Jenkins AJ (2008) Pharmacokinetics of specific drugs.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Morphine and its major metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide, may be quantitated in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Most commercial opiate screening tests based on immunoassays cross-react appreciably with these metabolites. However, chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the morphine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opiate-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of these metabolites in his system. Furthermore, some testing procedures employ a hydrolysis step prior to quantitation that converts the metabolic products to morphine, yielding a result that may be many times larger than with a method that examines each product individually. Interpretation can be confounded by usage of codeine or ingestion of poppy seed foods, either of which leads to the presence of morphine and its conjugated metabolites in a person's biofluids.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1057–1062.</ref>

==Effects on human performance==
Most reviews conclude that opioids produce minimal impairment of human performance on tests of sensory, motor, or attentional abilities. However, recent studies have been able to show some impairments caused by morphine, which is not surprising, given that morphine is a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]]. Morphine has resulted in impaired functioning on critical flicker frequency (a measure of overall CNS arousal) and impaired performance on the Maddox Wing test (a measure of deviation of the visual axes of the eyes). Few studies have investigated the effects of morphine on motor abilities; a high dose of morphine can impair finger tapping and the ability to maintain a low constant level of [[isometric exercise|isometric force]] (i.e. fine motor control is impaired),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kerr B, Hill H, Coda B, ''et al.'' |title=Concentration-related effects of morphine on cognition and motor control in human subjects |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=157–66 |year=1991 |pmid=1755931}}</ref> though no studies have shown a correlation between morphine and gross motor abilities.

In terms of [[cognitive]] abilities, one study has shown that morphine may have a negative impact on [[anterograde amnesia|anterograde]] and [[retrograde amnesia|retrograde memory]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Friswell J, Phillips C, Holding J, Morgan CJ, Brandner B, Curran HV |title=Acute effects of opioids on memory functions of healthy men and women |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=198 |issue=2 |pages=243–50 |year=2008|pmid=18379759 |doi=10.1007/s00213-008-1123-x}}</ref> but these effects are minimal and are transient. Overall, it seems that acute doses of opioids in non-tolerant subjects produce minor effects in some sensory and motor abilities, and perhaps also in [[attention]] and cognition. It is likely that the effects of morphine will be more pronounced in opioid-naive subjects than chronic opioid users.

In chronic opioid users, such as those on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for managing severe, [[chronic pain]], behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One recent study<ref>{{cite journal |author=Galski T, Williams JB, Ehle HT |title=Effects of opioids on driving ability |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=200–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10760625 |doi=10.1016/S0885-3924(99)00158-X}}</ref> analysed COAT patients in order to determine whether they were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this study suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., [[Rey Complex Figure]] Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS-R]] Block Design Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test&nbsp;– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., Planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It is important to note that this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on [[psychomotor]], [[cognitive]], or [[neuropsychological]] functioning.

It is difficult to study the performance effects of morphine without considering why a person is taking morphine. Opioid-naive subjects are volunteers in a pain-free state. However, most chronic-users of morphine use it to manage pain. Pain is a stressor and so it can confound performance results, especially on tests that require a large degree of concentration. Pain is also variable, and will vary over time and from person to person. It is unclear to what extent the stress of pain may cause impairments, and it is also unclear whether morphine is potentiating or attenuating these impairments.

==Chemistry==
[[File:Benzylisoquinoline structure in Morphine.svg|thumb|180px|Chemical structure of morphine. The [[benzylisoquinoline]] backbone is shown in green.]]
[[File:Morphine stereo structure.svg|thumb|180px|Same structure with correct 3D configuration; backbone in blue.]]

Morphine is a [[benzylisoquinoline]] alkaloid with two additional ring closures. It has:
* A rigid [[pentacyclic]] structure consisting of a [[benzene]] ring (A), two partially unsaturated[[cyclohexane]] rings (B and C), a [[piperidine]] ring (D) and a [[tetrahydrofuran]] ring (E). Rings A, B and C are the [[phenanthrene]] ring system. This ring system has little conformational flexibility.
* Two hydroxyl functional groups: a A3-[[phenol]]ic OH (pKa 9.9) and a C6-[[allyl]]ic OH
* An [[ether]] linkage between C4 and C5,
* [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|Unsaturation]] between C7 and C8,
* A basic, 3o-[[amine]] function at position 17,
* 5 centers of [[chirality]] (C5, C6, C9, C13 and C14) with morphine exhibiting a high degree of [[stereoselectivity]] of analgesic action.<ref>[http://www.auburn.edu/~deruija/opioids_morphine.pdf Morphine Structure and Chemistry]</ref>

Most of the licit morphine produced is used to make [[codeine]] by methylation. It is also a precursor for many drugs including [[heroin]] (3,6-diacetylmorphine), [[hydromorphone]] (dihydromorphinone), and [[oxymorphone]] (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone). Replacement of the N-methyl group of morphine with an N-phenylethyl group results in a product that is 18 times more powerful than morphine in its opiate agonist potency. Combining this modification with the replacement of the 6-[[hydroxyl]] with a 6-[[methylene group]] produces a compound some 1,443 times more potent than morphine, stronger than the [[Bentley compounds]] such as [[etorphine]].

The structure-activity relationship of morphine has been extensively studied. As a result of the extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 200 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since the last quarter of the 19th century. These drugs range from 25 percent the strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2 percent of the strength of morphine) to several hundred times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including [[naloxone]] (Narcan), [[naltrexone]] (Trexan), and [[nalorphine]] (Nalline).

Morphine-derived [[agonist–antagonist]] drugs have also been developed. Elements of the morphine structure have been used to create completely synthetic drugs such as the [[morphinan]] family ([[levorphanol]], [[dextromethorphan]] and others) and other groups that have many members with morphine-like qualities. The modification of morphine and the aforementioned synthetics has also given rise to non-narcotic drugs with other uses such as emetics, stimulants, antitussives, anticholinergics, muscle relaxants, local anaesthetics, general anaesthetics, and others.

Most semi-synthetic opioids, both of the morphine and [[codeine]] subgroups, are created by modifying one or more of the following:
* Halogenating or making other modifications at positions 1 and/or 2 on the morphine carbon skeleton.
* The methyl group that makes morphine into codeine can be removed or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine and morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, nicocodeine and nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine, etc.
* Saturating, opening, or other changes to the bond between positions 7 and 8, as well as adding, removing, or modifying functional groups to these positions; saturating, reducing, eliminating, or otherwise modifying the 7-8 bond and attaching a functional group at 14 yields [[hydromorphinol]]; the oxidation of the hydroxyl group to a carbonyl and changing the 7-8 bond to single from double changes codeine into oxycodone.
* Attachment, removal or modification of functional groups to positions 3 and/or 6 (dihydrocodeine and related, hydrocodone, nicomorphine); in the case of moving the methyl functional group from position 3 to 6, codeine becomes [[heterocodeine]], which is 72 times stronger, and therefore six times stronger than morphine
* Attachment of functional groups or other modification at position 14 (oxymorphone, oxycodone, naloxone)
* Modifications at positions 2, 4, 5 or 17, usually along with other changes to the molecule elsewhere on the morphine skeleton. Often this is done with drugs produced by catalytic reduction, hydrogenation, oxidation, or the like, producing strong derivatives of morphine and codeine.

Both morphine and its hydrated form, C<span style="font-size:100%;"><sub>17</sub></span>H<span style="font-size:100%;"><sub>19</sub></span>NO<span style="font-size:100%;"><sub>3</sub></span>H<span style="font-size:100%;"><sub>2</sub></span>O, are sparingly soluble in water. In five liters of water, only one gram of the hydrate will dissolve. For this reason, pharmaceutical companies produce sulfate and hydrochloride salts of the drug, both of which are over 300 times more water-soluble than their parent molecule. Whereas the pH of a saturated morphine hydrate solution is 8.5, the salts are acidic. Since they derive from a strong acid but weak base, they are both at about pH = 5; as a consequence, the morphine salts are mixed with small amounts of [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] to make them suitable for injection.<ref>[http://www.emsb.qc.ca/laurenhill/science/morphine.html Morphine]</ref>

A number of salts of morphine are used, with the most common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance, so it is not used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the [[United Kingdom]] and in [[Canada]], its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other, especially older, opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the [[NSAID]]; multiple [[barbiturate]] salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of [[valerian (herb)|valerian]]. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not to be confused with the current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of [[caffeine]] and [[cocaine]], with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.

Closely related to morphine are the opioids morphine-N-oxide (genomorphine), which is a pharmaceutical that is no longer in common use; and pseudomorphine, an alkaloid that exists in opium, form as degradation products of morphine.

The salts listed by the [[United States Drug Enforcement Administration]] for reporting purposes, in addition to a few others, are as follows:

===Production===
[[File:Alkaloids.png|thumb]]
In the [[opium poppy]] the alkaloids are bound to [[meconic acid]]. The method is to extract from the crushed plant with diluted sulfuric acid, which is a stronger acid than meconic acid, but not so strong to react with alkaloid molecules. The [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] is performed in many steps (one amount of crushed plant is at least six to ten times extracted, so practically every [[alkaloid]] goes into the solution). From the solution obtained at the last extraction step, the alkaloids are precipitated by either ammonium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. The last step is purifying and separating morphine from other opium alkaloids. The somewhat similar Gregory process was developed in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, which begins with stewing the entire plant, in most cases save the roots and leaves, in plain or mildly acidified water, then proceeding through steps of concentration, extraction, and purification of alkaloids.<ref>[[opium]]</ref><ref>[[Opium poppy]]</ref> Other methods of processing poppy straw use steam, one or more of several types of alcohol, or other organic solvents.

The poppy straw methods predominate in Continental Europe and the British Commonwealth, with the latex method in most common use in India. The latex method can involve either vertical or horizontal slicing of the unripe pods with a two-to five-bladed knife with a guard developed specifically for this purpose to the depth of a fraction of a millimetre and scoring of the pods can be done up to five times. An alternative latex method sometimes used in China in the past is to cut off the poppy heads, run a large needle through them, and collect the dried latex 24 to 48 hours later.<ref name="Opium" />

Opium poppy contains at least 50 different alkaloids, but most of them are of very low concentration. Morphine is the principal alkaloid in raw opium and constitutes ~8-19% of [[opium]] by dry weight (depending on growing conditions).<ref name="Jenkins AJ 2008" /> Some purpose-developed strains of poppy now produce opium that is up to 26 percent morphine by weight.<ref name="Poppy Straw Concentrate">[[Poppy Straw Concentrate]]</ref> A rough rule of thumb to determine the morphine content of pulverised dried poppy straw is to divide the percentage expected for the strain or crop via the latex method by eight or an empirically determined factor, which is often in the range of 5 to 15.<ref name="Poppy Straw Concentrate" /> The Norman strain of ''P. Somniferum'', also developed in [[Tasmania]], produces down to 0.04 percent morphine but with much higher amounts of [[thebaine]] and [[oripavine]], which can be used to synthesise semi-synthetic opioids as well as other drugs like stimulants, emetics, opioid antagonists, anticholinergics, and smooth-muscle agents.<ref name="Poppy Straw Concentrate" />

In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Hungary]] supplied nearly 60% of Europe's total medication-purpose morphine production. To this day, poppy farming is legal in Hungary, but poppy farms are limited by law to {{convert|2|acre|m2}}. It is also legal to sell dried poppy in flower shops for use in floral arrangements.

It was announced in 1973 that a team at the National Institutes of Health in the United States had developed a method for total synthesis of morphine, [[codeine]], and thebaine using coal tar as a starting material. A shortage in codeine-hydrocodone class cough suppressants (all of which can be made from morphine in one or more steps, as well as from codeine or thebaine) was the initial reason for the research.

Most morphine produced for pharmaceutical use around the world is actually converted into codeine as the concentration of the latter in both raw opium and poppy straw is much lower than that of morphine; in most countries, the usage of codeine (both as end-product and precursor) is at least equal or greater than that of morphine on a weight basis.

===Extraction and detection===
Morphine can be isolated from whole blood samples by [[solid phase extraction]] (SPE) and detected using [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (LC-MS).

==Biosynthesis==
The morphine is biosynthesized from the tetrahydroisoquinoline [[reticuline]]. It is converted into [[salutaridine]], [[thebaine]], and [[oripavine]]. The involucrated enzymes in this process are the [[salutaridine synthase]], [[salutaridine:NADPH 7-oxidoreductase]] and the [[codeinone reductase]]<ref>Novak ''et al''. "Morphine Synthesis and Biosynthesis – An Update", ''Current Organic Chemistry'' (2000) 4, 343–362. http://brocku.ca/mathematics-science/departments-and-centres/chemistry/faculty/Hudlicky/CurrOrgChem-2000-4-343.pdf</ref>

==History==
An opium-based elixir has been ascribed to [[Alchemy|alchemists]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, but the specific formula was lost during the Ottoman conquest of [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0531-5131(02)00699-4|title=Pain relief and sedation in Roman Byzantine texts: ''Mandragoras officinarum'', ''Hyoscyamos niger'', and ''Atropa belladonna''|year=2002|last1=Ramoutsaki|first1=I|journal=International Congress Series|volume=1242|pages=43|last2=Askitopoulou|first2=Helen|last3=Konsolaki|first3=Eleni}}</ref> Around 1522, [[Paracelsus]] made reference to an opium-based elixir that he called ''laudanum'' from the Latin word ''laudare'', meaning "to praise" He described it as a potent painkiller, but recommended that it be used sparingly. In the late eighteenth century, when the East India Company gained a direct interest in the opium trade through India, another opiate recipe called [[laudanum]] became very popular among physicians and their patients.
[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertuerner.jpg|thumb|150px|Friedrich Sertürner]]
Morphine was discovered as the first active alkaloid extracted from the opium poppy plant in December 1804 in [[Paderborn, Germany]], by [[Friedrich Sertürner]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MtOiLVWBn8cC&pg=PA20|page=20|title=Molecular, clinical and environmental toxicology|author=Andreas Luch|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=3-7643-8335-6}}</ref> The drug was first marketed to the general public by Sertürner and Company in 1817 as an [[analgesic]], and also as a treatment for opium and alcohol addiction. Commercial production began in Darmstadt, Germany in 1827 by the pharmacy that became the pharmaceutical company Merck, with morphine sales being a large part of their early growth.<ref name="Opium">[[Opium]]</ref>

Later it was found that morphine was more addictive than either alcohol or opium, and its extensive use during the [[American Civil War]] allegedly resulted in over 400,000<ref>[http://www.asahq.org/Newsletters/2004/07_04/wrightLecture.html ASA July 2004 Newsletter]</ref> sufferers from the "soldier's disease" of morphine addiction.<ref>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/ledain/nonmed4.htm Canadian Government Commission – Opiate Narcotics]</ref><ref>[http://civilwartalk.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-20838.html Old Soldiers Disease]</ref> This idea has been a subject of controversy, as there have been suggestions that such a disease was in fact a fabrication; the first documented use of the phrase "soldier's disease" was in 1915.<ref>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/soldis.htm Mythical Roots of US Drug Policy – Soldier's Disease and Addicts in the Civil War]</ref><ref>[http://www.amusingfacts.com/facts/Detail/soldiers-disease-morphine.html Soldiers Disease A Historical Hoax?]</ref>

[[Diacetylmorphine]] (better known as [[heroin]]) was synthesized from morphine in 1874 and brought to market by [[Bayer]] in 1898. Heroin is approximately 1.5 to 2 times more potent than morphine weight for weight. Due to the [[lipophilicity|lipid solubility]] of diacetylmorphine, it is able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] faster than morphine, subsequently increasing the reinforcing component of addiction.<ref>[http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/301/2/690.full.pdf Onset of Action and Drug Reinforcement | Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (JPET)]</ref> Using a variety of subjective and objective measures, one study estimated the relative potency of heroin to morphine administered intravenously to post-addicts to be 1.80–2.66&nbsp;mg of morphine sulfate to 1&nbsp;mg of diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin).<ref name="martin and fraser">{{cite journal |author=Martin WR, Fraser HF |title=A comparative study of physiological and subjective effects of heroin and morphine administered intravenously in postaddicts |journal=J.

Morphine became a controlled substance in the [[United States|US]] under the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914, and possession without a prescription in the US is a criminal offense.
Morphine was the most commonly abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of [[dihydromorphine]] (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and [[oxycodone]] (1916) and similar drugs, there were no other drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away ([[pethidine]] was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as [[dihydrocodeine]] (Paracodin), [[ethylmorphine]] (Dionine), and [[benzylmorphine]] (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause [[hydromorphone]], [[oxymorphone]], high-dose oxycodone, or [[methadone]] as well as [[dextromoramide]] in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of [[dihydrocodeine]], poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, [[propoxyphene]], and [[tramadol]].

The structural formula of morphine was determined by 1925 by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]]. At least three methods of total synthesis of morphine from starting materials such as coal tar and petroleum distillates have been patented, the first of which was announced in 1952, by Dr. [[Marshall D. Gates, Jr.]] at the [[University of Rochester]].<ref>[http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=20 University of Rochester Press Releases]</ref> Still, the vast majority of morphine is derived from the opium poppy by either the traditional method of gathering latex from the scored, unripe pods of the poppy, or processes using poppy straw, the dried pods and stems of the plant, the most widespread of which was invented in Hungary in 1925 and announced in 1930 by the chemist János Kábay.

In 2003, there was discovery of endogenous morphine occurring naturally in the human body. Thirty years of speculation were made on this subject because there was a receptor that, it appeared, reacted only to morphine: the mu3 [[Opioid receptor|opiate receptor]] in human tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhu W, Cadet P, Baggerman G, Mantione KJ, Stefano GB |title=Human white blood cells synthesize morphine: CYP2D6 modulation |journal=J. Immunol. |volume=175 |issue=11 |pages=7357–62 |year=2005 |pmid=16301642}}</ref> Human cells that form in reaction to cancerous [[neuroblastoma]] cells have been found to contain trace amounts of endogenous morphine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poeaknapo C, Schmidt J, Brandsch M, Dräger B, Zenk MH |title=Endogenous formation of morphine in human cells |journal=Proc.

==Society and culture==

===Illicit use===
[[File:Morphine DOJ.jpg|thumb|Example of different morphine tablets]]
The euphoria, comprehensive alleviation of distress and therefore all aspects of suffering, promotion of sociability and empathy, "body high", and anxiolysis provided by narcotic drugs including the opioids can cause the use of high doses in the absence of pain for a protracted period, which can impart a morbid craving for the drug in the user. Being the prototype of the entire opioid class of drugs means that morphine has properties that may lend it to misuse. Morphine addiction is the model upon which the current perception of addiction is based.

Animal and human studies and clinical experience back up the contention that morphine is one of the most euphoric of drugs on earth, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as [[dihydromorphine]], [[hydromorphone]] (Dilaudid, Hydal), and [[oxymorphone]] (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents [[dihydrocodeine]], [[hydrocodone]], and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are [[dipropanoylmorphine]], [[diacetyldihydromorphine]], and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like [[nicomorphine]] and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like [[desomorphine]], [[hydromorphinol]], etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.

In general, misuse of morphine entails taking more than prescribed or outside of medical supervision, injecting oral formulations, mixing it with unapproved potentiators such as alcohol, cocaine, and the like, and/or defeating the extended-release mechanism by chewing the tablets or turning into a powder for snorting or preparing injectables. The latter method can be every bit as time-consuming and involved as traditional methods of smoking opium. This and the fact that the liver destroys a large percentage of the drug on the first pass impacts the demand side of the equation for clandestine re-sellers, as many customers are not needle users and may have been disappointed with ingesting the drug orally. As morphine is generally as hard or harder to divert than [[oxycodone]] in a lot of cases, morphine in any form is uncommon on the street, although ampoules and phials of morphine injection, pure pharmaceutical morphine powder, and soluble multi-purpose tablets are very popular where available.

Morphine is also available in a paste that is used in the production of heroin, which can be smoked by itself or turned to a soluble salt and injected; the same goes for the penultimate products of the Kompot (Polish Heroin) and black tar processes. Poppy straw as well as opium can yield morphine of purity levels ranging from poppy tea to near-pharmaceutical-grade morphine by itself or with all of the more than 50 other alkaloids. It also is the active narcotic ingredient in opium and all of its forms, derivatives, and analogues as well as forming from breakdown of heroin and otherwise present in many batches of illicit heroin as the result of incomplete acetylation.

===Slang terms===
Morphine is known on the street and elsewhere as M, sister morphine, Vitamin M, morpho, etc.

MS Contin tablets are known as misties, and the 100&nbsp;mg extended-release tablets as greys and blockbusters. The "[[Speedball (drug)|speedball]]" can use morphine as the narcotic component, which is combined with cocaine, [[amphetamines]], [[methylphenidate]], or similar drugs. "Blue Velvet" is a combination of morphine with the antihistamine [[tripelennamine]] (Pyrabenzamine, PBZ, Pelamine) taken by injection, or less commonly the mixture when swallowed or used as a retention enema; the name is also known to refer to a combination of tripelennamine and dihydrocodeine or codeine tablets or syrups taken by mouth. "Morphia" is an older official term for morphine also used as a slang term. "Driving Miss Emma" is intravenous administration of morphine. Multi-purpose tablets (readily soluble hypodermic tablets that can also be swallowed or dissolved under the tongue or betwixt the cheek and jaw) are known, as are some brands of hydromorphone, as Shake & Bake or Shake & Shoot.

Morphine can be smoked, especially diacetylmorphine (heroin), the most common method being the "Chasing The Dragon" method. To perform a relatively crude acetylation to turn the morphine into heroin and related drugs immediately prior to use is known as AAing (for Acetic Anhydride) or home-bake, and the output of the procedure also known as home-bake or,  Blue Heroin (not to be confused with Blue Magic heroin, or the linctus known as Blue Morphine or Blue Morphone, or the Blue Velvet mixture described above.

==Precursor to other opioids==

===Pharmaceutical===
Morphine is a precursor in the manufacture in a large number of opioids such as [[dihydromorphine]], [[hydromorphone]], [[nicomorphine]], and [[heroin]] as well as [[codeine]], which itself has a large family of semi-synthetic derivatives. Morphine is commonly treated with [[acetic anhydride]] and ignited to yield heroin.<ref>L. F. Small and R. E. Lutz, Chemistry of the Opium Alkaloids, U. S. Government Printing Office: Washington, D. C., 1932, pp. 153–154.</ref>
Throughout Europe there is growing acceptance within the medical community of the use of slow release oral morphine as a substitution treatment alternative to methadone and buprenorphine for patients not able to tolerate the side-effects of buprenorphine and methadone. Slow-release oral morphine has been in widespread use for opiate maintenance therapy in Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia for many years and it is available on a small scale in many other countries including the UK. The long-acting nature of slow-release morphine mimics that of buprenorphine because the sustained blood levels are relatively flat so there is no "high" per se that a patient would feel but rather a sustained feeling of wellness and avoidance of withdrawal symptoms. For patients sensitive to the side-effects that in part may be a result of the unnatural pharmacological actions of buprenorphine and methadone, slow-release oral morphine formulations offer a promising future for use managing opiate addiction.
The pharmacology of heroin and morphine is identical except the two [[acetyl]] groups increase the [[lipophilicity|lipid solubility]] of the heroin molecule, causing heroin to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and enter the [[Human brain|brain]] more rapidly in injection. Once in the brain, these acetyl groups are removed to yield morphine, which causes the subjective effects of heroin. Thus, heroin may be thought of as a more rapidly acting form of morphine.<ref name="Klous 2005">{{cite journal |author=Klous MG, Van den Brink W, Van Ree JM, Beijnen JH |title=Development of pharmaceutical heroin preparations for medical co-prescription to opioid dependent patients |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=283–95 |year=2005 |pmid=15916865 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2005.04.008}}</ref>

===Illicit===
Illicit morphine is rarely produced from codeine found in over-the-counter cough and pain medicines. This demethylation reaction is often performed using pyridine and hydrochloric acid.<ref>H. Rapoport, The Preparation of Morphine-N-Methyl-C14, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 73, 5900 (1951)</ref>

Another source of illicit morphine comes from the extraction of morphine from extended-release morphine products, such as MS-Contin. Morphine can be extracted from these products with simple extraction techniques to yield a morphine solution that can be injected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crews JC, Denson DD |title=Recovery of morphine from a controlled-release preparation. A source of opioid abuse |journal=Cancer |volume=66 |issue=12 |pages=2642–4 |year=1990 |pmid=2249204 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19901215)66:12<2642::AID-CNCR2820661229>3.0.CO;2-B}}</ref> As an alternative, the tablets can be crushed and snorted, injected or swallowed, although this provides much less euphoria but retains some of the extended-release effect, and the extended-release property is why MS-Contin is used in some countries alongside [[methadone]], [[dihydrocodeine]], [[buprenorphine]], [[dihydroetorphine]], [[piritramide]], [[Levacetylmethadol|levo-alpha-acetylmethadol]] ([[LAAM]]), and special 24-hour formulations of [[hydromorphone]] for maintenance and detoxification of those physically dependent on opioids.

Another means of using or misusing morphine is to use chemical reactions to turn it into [[heroin]] or another stronger opioid. Morphine can, using a technique reported in New Zealand (where the initial precursor is codeine) and elsewhere known as home-bake, be turned into what is usually a mixture of morphine, heroin, 3-monoacetylmorphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, and codeine derivatives like acetylcodeine if the process is using morphine made from demethylating codeine.

Since heroin is one of a series of 3,6 diesters of morphine, it is possible to convert morphine to [[nicomorphine]] (Vilan) using nicotinic anhydride, [[dipropanoylmorphine]] with propionic anhydride, dibutanoylmorphine and disalicyloylmorphine with the respective acid anhydrides. Glacial [[acetic acid]] can be used to obtain a mixture high in 6-monoacetylmorphine, [[niacin]] (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) in some form would be precursor to 6-nicotinylmorphine, salicylic acid may yield the salicyoyl analogue of 6-MAM, and so on.

The clandestine conversion of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or other derivatives like [[dihydromorphine]] (Paramorfan), [[desomorphine]] (Permonid), [[metopon]], etc. and codeine to [[hydrocodone]] (Dicodid), [[dihydrocodeine]] (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and large amounts of morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so.

==Access in developing countries==
Although morphine is cheap, people in poorer countries often do not have access to it. According to a 2005 estimate by the [[International Narcotics Control Board]], six countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States) consume 79 percent of the world’s morphine. The less affluent countries, accounting for 80 percent of the world's population, consumed only about 6 percent of the global morphine supply. Some countries import virtually no morphine, and in others the drug is rarely available even for relieving severe pain while dying.

Experts in pain management attribute the under-distribution of morphine to an unwarranted fear of the drug's potential for addiction and abuse. While morphine is clearly addictive, Western doctors believe it is worthwhile to use the drug and then wean the patient off when the treatment is over.<ref>{{cite news |author = Donald G.
