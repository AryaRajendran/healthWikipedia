'''Uterine rupture''' is a potentially catastrophic event during [[childbirth]] by which the integrity of the [[myometrium|myometrial]] wall is breached. In an incomplete rupture the [[peritoneum]] is still intact. With a complete rupture the contents of the uterus may spill into the peritoneal cavity or the [[broad ligament]]. A uterine rupture is a life-threatening event for mother and baby.

A uterine rupture typically occurs during active [[labor (childbirth)|labor]], but may already develop during late pregnancy. 

Uterine [[dehiscence]] is a similar condition, but involves fewer layers, less bleeding, and less risk.<ref name="urlUterine Rupture in Pregnancy: eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/275854-overview |title=Uterine Rupture in Pregnancy: eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref>

==Risk factors and causes==
A uterine scar from a previous [[cesarean section]] is the most common risk factor. (In one review, 52% had previous cesarean scars.)<ref name="pmid20230321">{{cite journal |author=Chibber R, El-Saleh E, Fadhli RA, Jassar WA, Harmi JA |title=Uterine rupture and subsequent pregnancy outcome - how safe is it?

==Presentation==
Symptoms of a rupture may be initially quite subtle. An old cesarean scar may undergo [[dehiscence]], but with further labor, the woman may experience abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Often a deterioration of the fetal heart rate is a leading sign. Intra-abdominal bleeding can lead to [[hypovolemic shock]] and death.

==Treatment==
Emergency exploratory [[laparotomy]] with cesarean delivery accompanied by fluid and [[blood transfusion]] are indicated for the management of uterine rupture. Depending on the nature of the rupture and the condition of the patient, the uterus may be either repaired or removed (cesarean hysterectomy).

==Signs and symptoms==
* [[Abdominal pain]] and tenderness. The pain may not be severe; it may occur suddenly at the peak of a contraction. The woman may describe a feeling that something "gave way" or "ripped."
* [[Chest pain]], pain between the scapulae, or pain on inspiration—Pain occurs because of the irritation of blood below the woman's diphragm
* [[Hypovolemic shock]] caused by hemorrhage—Falling blood pressure, [[tachycardia]], tachypnea, pallor, cool and clammy skin, and anxiety. The fall in blood pressure is often a late sign of hemorrhage
* Signs associated with fetal oxygenation, such as late decelerations, reduced variability, tachycardia, and bradycardia
* Absent fetal heart sounds with a large disruption of the placenta; absent fetal heart activity by ultrasound examination
* Cessation of uterine contractions
* [[Palpitation]] of the fetus outside the uterus (usually occurs only with a large, complete rupture). The fetus is likely to be dead
