'''Fournier gangrene''' is a type of [[necrosis|necrotizing]] [[infection]] or [[gangrene]] usually affecting the [[perineum]].

It was first described by Baurienne in 1764 and is named after a French [[venereology|venereologist]], [[Jean Alfred Fournier]] following five cases he presented in clinical lectures in 1883.

==Cause==
In the majority of cases Fournier gangrene is a mixed infection caused by both [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thwaini A, Khan A, Malik A, Cherian J, Barua J, Shergill I, Mammen K |title=Fournier's gangrene and its emergency management |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=82 |issue=970 |pages=516–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16891442 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2005.042069 |pmc=2585703}}</ref> Death can result from Fournier gangrene.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791735/</ref>

==Treatment==
Fournier gangrene is a urological emergency requiring intravenous antibiotics and [[debridement]] (surgical removal) of necrotic (dead) tissue. In addition to surgery and antibiotics, [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT) may be useful and acts to inhibit the growth of and kill the anaerobic bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zamboni WA, Riseman JA, Kucan JO |title=Management of Fournier's Gangrene and the role of Hyperbaric Oxygen |journal=J. Hyperbaric Med |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=177–186 |year=1990 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4431 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref> Despite such measures, the mortality rate overall is 40%, but 78% if [[sepsis]] is already present at the time of initial hospital admission.<ref name="Yanar2006"/>

The most historically prominent sufferers from this condition may have been [[Herod the Great]], his grandson [[Herod Agrippa]], and possibly the [[Roman emperor]] [[Galerius]]. Puerto Rican [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and pro-independence leader [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]] died from Fournier gangrene in November 1867.

==Epidemiology==
An estimated 750 cases have been reported in the literature,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burch DM, Barreiro TJ, Vanek VW |title=Fournier's gangrene: be alert for this medical emergency |journal=JAAPA |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=44–7 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=18035764 |doi= |url=http://media.haymarketmedia.com/Documents/2/fournier1107_1568.pdf}}</ref> with most patients in their 60s or 70s with other concurrent illnesses.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vaz I |title=Fournier gangrene |journal=Trop Doct |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=203–4 |year=2006 |pmid=17034687 |doi=10.1258/004947506778604724}}</ref> According to another study in 2000, there have been at least 1726 reported cases in the English literature. <ref>{{ cite journal |author=Eke N. |title=Fournier's gangrene: a review of 1726 cases |journal=British Journal of Surgery |volume=87 | issue=6 |pages=718–728 |year=2000 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2168.2000.01497.x}}</ref> However, Fournier gangrene is not a reportable illness, so the number of unreported cases is unclear. A similar infection in women has been occasionally described.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Herzog W |title=[Fournier gangrene--also in females?] |journal=Zentralbl Chir |volume=112 |issue=9 |pages=564–76 |year=1987 |pmid=2956804}}</ref>

In Turkey it was reported that 46% of patients had [[diabetes mellitus]]<ref name="Yanar2006">{{cite journal |author=Yanar H, Taviloglu K, Ertekin C, Guloglu R, Zorba U, Cabioglu N, Baspinar I |title=Fournier's gangrene: risk factors and strategies for management |journal=World J Surg |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=1750–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16927060 |doi=10.1007/s00268-005-0777-3}}</ref> while other studies have identified approximately a third of patients having either diabetes, alcoholism or malnutrition, and 10% having medical immunosuppression (chemotherapy, steroids, or malignancy).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tahmaz L, Erdemir F, Kibar Y, Cosar A, Yalcýn O |title=Fournier's gangrene: report of thirty-three cases and a review of the literature |journal=Int J Urol |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=960–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16882063 |doi=10.1111/j.1442-2042.2006.01448.x}}</ref>
