A [[genus]] of [[trematode]]s, '''''Schistosoma''''',  commonly known as '''blood-flukes''' and '''bilharzia''', includes [[flatworm]]s which are responsible for a highly significant [[parasitic]] [[infection]] of [[humans]] by  causing the disease [[schistosomiasis]], and is considered by the [[World Health Organization]] as the second most socioeconomically devastating [[parasitic]] [[disease]], next only to [[malaria]], with hundreds of millions infected worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs115/en/index.html|publisher=World Health Organization|title=Schistosomiasis Fact Sheet|accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=Schistosomiasis|accessdate=10 August 2011}}</ref>

Adult [[worm|worms]] parasitize [[circulatory system|mesenteric blood vessels]]. They are unique among [[trematodes]] or any other [[platyhelminthes|flatworms]] in that they are [[dioecious]] with distinct [[sexual dimorphism]] between [[male]] and [[female]]. Eggs are passed through [[urine]] or [[feces]] to [[fresh water]], where [[larva]] must pass through an intermediate snail [[Host (biology)|host]], before a different larval stage of the parasite emerges that can infect a new mammalian host by directly penetrating the skin.

== History ==

The eggs of these [[parasitism|parasites]] were first seen by [[Theodor Maximilian Bilharz]], a [[Germany|German]] [[pathologist]] working in [[Egypt]] in 1851 who found the eggs of ''[[Schistosoma haematobium]]'' during the course of a [[post mortem]]. He wrote two letters to his former teacher von Siebold in May and August 1851 describing his findings. Von Siebold wrote a paper (published in 1852) summarizing [[Theodor Maximilian Bilharz|Bilharz's]] findings. [[Theodor Maximilian Bilharz|Bilharz]] wrote a paper in 1856 describing the [[worm|worms]] more fully and he named them ''Distoma haematobium''. Their unusual [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] meant that they could not be comfortably included in ''Distoma''. So in 1856 Meckel von Helmsback created the [[genus]] ''Bilharzia'' for them. In 1858 [[Weinland]] proposed the name ''Schistosoma'' (Greek: 'split body') after the male [[worm|worms]]' morphology. Despite ''Bilharzia'' having precedence the [[genus]] name ''Schistosoma'' was officially adopted by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]]. The term ''Bilharzia'' to describe infection with these [[parasitism|parasites]] is still in use in medical circles.

[[Theodor Maximilian Bilharz|Bilharz]] also described ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'' but this species was redescribed by Louis Westenra Sambon in 1907 at the [[London School of Tropical Medicine]] who named it after his teacher [[Patrick Manson]].

In 1898, all the then known [[species]] were placed in a [[subfamily]] by Stiles and Hassel. This was then elevated to [[family]] status by [[Arthur Looss|Looss]] in 1899. Poche in 1907 corrected a [[grammar|grammatical]] error in the [[family]] name. The [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] was determined by da Silva in 1908.

In 2009, the [[genome]]s of ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'' and ''[[Schistosoma japonicum]]'' were decoded opening the way for new targeted treatments. In particular, the study discovered that the [[genome]] of ''[[Schistosoma mansoni|S. mansoni]]'' contained 11,809 [[genes]] including many which produce [[enzymes]] for breaking down [[proteins]] which enable the [[parasite]] to bore through tissue. Also, ''[[Schistosoma mansoni|S. mansoni]]'' does not have an [[enzyme]] to make certain [[fat]]s so that it must rely on its host to produce these.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Killer parasites' genes decoded  |date=July 16, 2009 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8151199.stm |accessdate=2009-07-16}}</ref>

== Evolution ==
[[File:Schistosoma 20041-300.jpg|thumb|left|Electron micrograph of an adult male ''Schistosoma'' parasite worm. The bar (bottom left) represents a length of 500 μm.]]
The origins of this [[genu]]s remain unclear. For many years it was believed that this [[genus]] had an [[African]] origin but [[DNA sequencing]] suggests that the [[species]] (''S. edwardiense'' and ''S. hippopotami'') that infect the hippo (''[[Hippopotamus amphibius]]'') could be basal. Since hippos were present in both [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] during the [[Cenozoic]] era the [[genus]] might have originated as [[parasitism|parasites]] of hippos.<ref name="Morgana2003">{{cite journal |author=Morgan JA, DeJong RJ, Kazibwe F, Mkoji GM, Loker ES |title=A newly-identified lineage of Schistosoma |journal=Int.

The original hosts for the South East Asian species were probably [[rodent]]s.

The [[sister group]] to ''Schistosoma'' is a [[genus]] of [[elephant]]-infecting schistosomes — ''[[Bivitellobilharzia]]''.
The [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]] and cashmere [[goat]] [[parasite]] ''[[Orientobilharzia turkestanicum]]'' appears to be related to the [[African]] schistosomes.<ref name=Wang2009>{{cite journal |author=Wang CR, Li L, Ni HB, ''et al.'' |title=''Orientobilharzia turkestanicum'' is a member of Schistosoma genus based on phylogenetic analysis using ribosomal DNA sequences |journal=Exp.

Within the '''''haematobium''''' group ''S. bovis'' and ''S. curassoni'' appear to be closely related as do ''S. leiperi'' and ''S. mattheei''.

''S. mansoni'' appears to have evolved in [[East Africa]] 0.43–0.30 million years ago.

''S. incognitum'' and ''S. nasale'' are more closely related to the African species rather than the '''''japonicum''''' group.

''S. sinensium'' appears to have radiated during the [[Pliocene]].

''S. mekongi'' appears to have invaded South East [[Asia]] in the mid-[[Pleistocene]].

Estimated speciation dates for the '''''japonicum''''' group: ~3.8  million years ago for ''S. japonicum''/South East Asian schistosoma and ~2.5 million years ago for ''S. malayensis''/''S. mekongi''.

==Taxonomy==

The [[genus]] ''Schistosoma'' as currently defined is paraphyletic so revisions are likely. Currently twenty one [[species]] are recognised within this [[genus]].

The [[genus]] has been divided into four groups — '''''indicum''''', '''''japonicum''''', '''''haematobium''''' and '''''mansoni'''''. The affinities of the remaining three [[species]] are still being clarified.

Twelve [[species]] are found in [[Africa]]. Eleven of these are divided into two groups — those with a lateral spine on the egg ('''''mansoni''''' group) and those with a terminal spine ('''''haematobium''''' group).

The four '''''mansoni''''' group [[species]] are: ''[[Schistosoma edwardiense|S. edwardiense]]'', ''[[Schistosoma hippotami|S. hippotami]]'', ''[[Schistosoma mansoni|S. mansoni]]'' and ''[[Schistosoma rodhaini|S. rodhaini]]''.

The eight '''''haematobium''''' group [[species]] are: ''[[Schistosoma bovis|S. bovis]]'', ''[[Schistosoma curassoni|S. curassoni]]'', ''[[Schistosoma intercalatum|S. intercalatum]]'', ''[[Schistosoma guineensis|S. guineensis]]'', ''[[Schistosoma haematobium|S. haematobium]]'',  ''[[Schistosoma leiperi|S. leiperi]]'', ''[[Schistosoma margrebowiei|S. margrebowiei]]'' and ''[[Schistosoma matthei|S. matthei]]''.

''S. spindale'' is widely distributed in [[Asia]] but is also found in [[Africa]].

The other [[species]] occur in [[Asia]] and [[India]]

The '''''indicum''''' group has three [[species]]: ''[[Schistosoma indicum|S. indicum]]'', ''[[Schistosoma nasale|S. nasale]]'' and ''[[Schistosoma spindale|S. spindale]]''. This group appears to have evolved during the [[Pleistocene]]. All use pulmonate [[snails]] as hosts.

''S. indicum'' is found in [[India]] and [[Thailand]].

The '''''japonicum''''' group has three [[species]]: ''[[Schistosoma japonicum|S. japonicum]]'', ''[[Schistosoma malayensis|S. malayensis]]'' and ''[[Schistosoma mekongi|S. mekongi]]''.

''[[Schistosoma sinensium|S. sinensium]]'' is a sister [[clade]] to the ''S. japonicum'' group and is found in [[China]].

''[[Schistosoma ovuncatum|S. ovuncatum]]'' forms a [[clade]] with ''[[Schistosoma sinensium|S. sinensium]]'' and is found in northern [[Thailand]]. The definitive host is the rat (''[[Rattus rattus]]'') and the intermediate host is the [[snail]] ''[[Tricula bollingi]]''. This [[species]] is known to use [[snails]] of the [[family]] [[Pomatiopsidae]] as hosts.

''[[Schistosoma incognitum|S. incognitum]]'' appears to be basal in this [[genus]]. It may be more closely related to the [[African]]/[[India]]n [[species]] than to the South East Asian group. This species uses pulmonate snails as hosts.

== Schistosomiasis ==
{{main|schistosomiasis|schistosomicide}}

''Schistosoma'' causes the [[parasitic]] [[disease]] [[schistosomiasis]]. An anti-schistosome drug is a [[schistosomicide]].

=== Species infecting humans ===

Parasitism of humans by ''Schistosoma'' appears to have evolved at least three occasions in both [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].

*'''''[[Schistosoma guineensis|S. guineensis]]''''', a recently described species, is found in [[West Africa]]. Known [[snail]] intermediate hosts include ''[[Bulinus forskalii]].''

*'''''[[Schistosoma haematobium|S. haematobium]]''''', commonly referred to as the ''bladder fluke'', originally found in Africa, the [[Near East]], and the [[Mediterranean]] basin, was introduced into India during World War II.  Freshwater snails of the ''[[Bulinus]]'' genus are an important intermediate host for this parasite. Among final hosts humans are most important. Other final hosts are rarely baboons and monkeys.<ref name=Manson>{{cite book |editor1-last=Manson-Bahr |editor1-first=P.E.C. |editor2-last=Bell |editor2-first=D.R. |title=Manson's Tropical Diseases |publisher=Bailliere Tindall |location=London |year=1987 |isbn=0-7020-1187-8 }}</ref>

*'''''[[Schistosoma intercalatum|S. intercalatum]].''''' The usual final hosts are humans. Other animals can be infected experimentally.<ref name=Manson/>

*'''''[[Schistosoma japonicum|S. japonicum]]''''' whose common name is simply ''blood fluke'' is found widely spread in [[Eastern Asia]] and the southwestern [[Pacific]] region. In [[Taiwan]] this species only affects animals, not humans. Freshwater snails of the ''[[Oncomelania]]'' genus are an important intermediate host for ''S. japonicum.'' Final hosts are humans and other mammals including cats, dogs, goats, horses, pigs, rats and water buffalo.<ref name=Manson/>

*'''''[[Schistosoma malayensis|S. malayensis]]''''' This species appears to be a rare infection in humans and is considered to be a [[zoonosis]]. The natural vertebrate host is von Muller's rat (''[[Rattus muelleri]]''). The snail host(s) are not yet known.

*'''''[[Schistosoma mansoni|S. mansoni]]''''', found in [[Africa]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], [[Suriname]], the lesser [[Antilles]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]. It is also known as ''Manson's blood fluke'' or ''swamp fever''.  Freshwater snails of the ''[[Biomphalaria]]'' genus are an important intermediate host for this trematode. Among final hosts humans are most important. Other final hosts are baboons, rodents and raccoons.<ref name=Manson/>

*'''''[[Schistosoma mekongi|S. mekongi]]''''' is related to ''S. japonicum'' and affects both the superior and inferior mesenteric veins. ''S. mekongi'' differs in that it has smaller eggs, a different intermediate host (''[[Neotricula aperta]]'') and longer prepatent period in the mammalian host. Final hosts are humans and dogs.<ref name=Manson/> The snail ''[[Tricula aperta]]'' can also be experimentally infected with this species.

=== Species infecting animals other than humans ===

''[[Schistosoma indicum]]'', ''[[Schistosoma nasale]]'', ''[[Schistosoma leiperi]]'' are all parasites of [[ruminant]]s.

''[[Schistosoma edwardiense]]'' and ''[[Schistosoma hippopotami]]'' are parasites of the hippo.

==Morphology==
Adult schistosomes share all the fundamental features of the digenea. They have a basic [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]], oral and ventral suckers, a body covering of a [[syncytium|syncytial]] [[integumentary system|tegument]], a blind-ending [[digestive system]] consisting of [[mouth]], [[oesophagus]] and bifurcated [[cecum|caeca]]; the area between the tegument and alimentary canal filled with a loose network of [[germ layer#Mesoderm|mesoderm]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and an excretory or osmoregulatory system based on [[flame cell]]s.  Adult worms tend to be 10–20&nbsp;mm (0.4–0.8&nbsp;in) long and use [[globin]]s from their hosts' [[hemoglobin]] for their own circulatory system.

==Reproduction==
Unlike other trematodes, the schistosomes are [[dioecious]] — i.e., the sexes are separate. The two sexes display a strong degree of [[sexual dimorphism]], and the male is considerably larger than the female. The male surrounds the female and encloses her within his ''gynacophoric canal'' for the entire adult lives of the worms, where they reproduce sexually.
