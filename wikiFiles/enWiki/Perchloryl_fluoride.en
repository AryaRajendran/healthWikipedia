'''Perchloryl fluoride'''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7616946 | title = Perchloryl fluoride | author = Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory | publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology | accessdate = 2009-11-28 }}</ref> is a reactive gas with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|FClO|3}}. It has a characteristic sweet odor<ref name="ledgard2007"/> that resembles gasoline and kerosene. It is toxic and is a powerful [[oxidizing agent|oxidizing]] and [[fluorinating agent]]. It is the [[acid halide|acid fluoride]] of [[perchloric acid]].

In spite of its small enthalpy of formation (Δ''H''<sub>f</sub><sup><s>O</s></sup> = −5.7), it is kinetically stable, decomposing only at 400&nbsp;°C.<ref name="emeleus1976"/>{{rp|380}} It is quite reactive towards reducing agents and anions, however, with the chlorine atom acting as an [[electrophile]].<ref name="emeleus1976"/>{{rp|382}} It reacts explosively with reducing agents such as [[amide]]s, metals, [[hydride]]s, etc.<ref name="ledgard2007">{{cite book | title = The Preparatory Manual of Explosives | author = Jared Ledgard | edition = 3rd | publisher = Lulu.com | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-615-14290-7 | page = 77 }}</ref>

==Synthesis and chemistry==

Perchloryl fluoride is produced primarily by the fluorination of [[perchlorate]]s. [[Antimony pentafluoride]] is a commonly-used fluorinating agent:<ref name="emeleus1976"/>{{rp|372-373}}

:{{chem|ClO|4|-}} + 3 HF + 2 {{chem|SbF|5}} &rarr; {{chem|FClO|3}} + {{chem|H|3|O|+}} + 2 {{chem|SbF|6|-}}

{{chem|FClO|3}} reacts with [[alcohol]]s to produce [[alkyl]] perchlorates, which are extremely shock-sensitive explosives.<ref name="kirsch2004"/> Using [[Friedel-Crafts catalyst]]s, it can be used for introducing the {{chem|–ClO|3}} group into aromatic rings via [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Electrophilic halogenation: reaction pathways involving attack by electrophilic halogens on unsaturated compounds | author = Peter Bernard David De la Mare | publisher = CUP Archive | year = 1976 | isbn = 0-521-29014-7 | page = 63 }}</ref>

==Applications==

Perchloryl fluoride is used in organic chemistry as a mild fluorinating agent.<ref name="emeleus1976"/>{{rp|383}} It was the first industrially-relevant [[electrophile|electrophilic]] fluorinating agent, used since the 1960s for producing fluorinated [[steroid]]s.<ref name="kirsch2004">{{cite book | title = Modern fluoroorganic chemistry: synthesis, reactivity, applications | author = Peer Kirsch | publisher = Wiley-VCH | year = 2004 | isbn = 3-527-30691-9 | page = 74 }}</ref>

Perchloryl fluoride was investigated as a high performance [[liquid rocket fuel]] oxidizer.<ref name="sullivan2001">{{cite book | title = Clinical environmental health and toxic exposures | author1 = John Burke Sullivan | author2 = Gary R. Krieger | edition = 2nd | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-683-08027-X | page = 969 }}</ref> In comparison with [[chlorine pentafluoride]] and [[bromine pentafluoride]], it has significantly lower [[specific impulse]], but does not tend to corrode tanks. It does not require cryogenic storage.

It can also be used in [[Photoelectric flame photometer|flame photometry]] as an excitation source.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1366/000370258774615483}}</ref>

==Safety==

Perchloryl fluoride is toxic, with a [[Threshold Limit Value|TLV]] of 3 [[Parts per million|ppm]]. It is a strong lung- and eye-irritant capable of producing burns on exposed skin. Its [[IDLH]] level is 385 ppm. Symptoms of exposure include dizziness, headaches, [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]], and [[cyanosis]]. Exposure to toxic levels causes severe respiratory tract inflammation and [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name="sullivan2001"/>
