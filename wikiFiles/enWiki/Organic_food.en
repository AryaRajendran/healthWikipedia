'''Organic foods''' are foods that are produced using methods of [[organic farming]] -- that do not involve modern synthetic inputs such as synthetic [[pesticides]] and [[chemical fertilizers]].

==Meaning and origin of the term==
{{Details|Organic farming|on the production of organic food}}
[[File:Organic mixed beans shoots.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Mixed organic [[sprouting|bean sprouts]]]]

For the vast majority of its history, agriculture can be described as having been organic; only during the 20th century was a large supply of new chemicals introduced to the food supply.<ref>[http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/teaching-the-food-system/curriculum/_pdf/History_of_Food-Background.pdf History of food, p. 3]</ref> The organic farming movement arose in the 1940s in response to the [[industrialization]] of [[agriculture]] known as the [[Green Revolution]].<ref name=Drinkwater />

In 1939, [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne|Lord Northbourne]] coined the term ''organic farming'' in his book ''Look to the Land'' (1940), out of his conception of "the farm as organism," to describe a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming—in contrast to what he called ''chemical farming'', which relied on "imported fertility" and "cannot be self-sufficient nor an organic whole."<ref>{{cite journal|author=John, Paull|title=The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture|journal = Elementals: Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania|volume=80|year=2006|pages=14–18|url=http://orgprints.org/10138/01/10138.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> This is different from the scientific use of the term "organic," to refer to [[organic compound|a class of molecules that contain carbon]], especially those involved in the chemistry of life. This class of molecules includes everything likely to be considered edible, and include most pesticides and toxins too, therefore the term "organic" and, especially, the term "inorganic" (sometimes wrongly used as a contrast by the popular press) are both technically inaccurate and completely inappropriate when applied to farming, the production of food, and to foodstuffs themselves.

Early consumers interested in organic food would look for non-chemically treated, non-use of unapproved pesticides, fresh or minimally processed food. They mostly had to buy directly from growers: "Know your farmer, know your food" was the motto.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Personal definitions of what constituted "organic" were developed through firsthand experience: by talking to farmers, seeing farm conditions, and farming activities. Small farms grew vegetables (and raised livestock) using [[organic farming]] practices, with or without certification, and the individual consumer monitored.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}[[File:Community and organic food.jpg|thumbnail| Members of Toronto's karma co-op share food and play music]] Small specialty health food stores and co-operatives were instrumental to bringing organic food to a wider audience.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As demand for organic foods continued to increase, high volume sales through mass outlets such as supermarkets rapidly replaced the direct farmer connection.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Today there is no limit to organic farm sizes and many large corporate farms currently have an organic division. However, for supermarket consumers, food production is not easily observable, and product labeling, like "certified organic", is relied on. Government regulations and third-party inspectors are looked to for assurance.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Legal definition===

{{Main|Organic certification}}

{{See also|List of countries with organic agriculture regulation}}

Organic food production is a heavily regulated industry, distinct from [[Kitchen garden|private gardening]]. Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan and many other countries require producers to obtain [[Organic certification|special certification]] in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these regulations, organic food is food produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by national governments and international organizations. 

In the United States, organic production is a system that is managed in accordance with the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) of 1990 and regulations in Title 7, Part 205 of the Code of Federal Regulations to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop |title=Agricultural Marketing Service - National Organic Program |publisher=Ams.usda.gov |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> If livestock are involved, the livestock must be reared with regular access to pasture and without the routine use of antibiotics or [[Bovine somatotropin|growth hormones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5082653&acct=noprulemaking|title=Access to Pasture Rule for Organic Livestock|publisher=Ams.usda.gov|accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> 

Processed organic food usually contains only organic ingredients. If non-organic ingredients are present, at least a certain percentage of the food's total plant and animal ingredients must be organic (95% in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3004323&acct=nopgeninfo |title=Labeling: Preamble |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> Canada, and Australia).  Foods claiming to be organic must be free of artificial [[food additives]], and are often processed with fewer artificial methods, materials and conditions, such as [[SmartFresh|chemical ripening]], [[food irradiation]], and [[genetically modified]] ingredients. Pesticides are allowed as long as they are not synthetic.<ref>Staff, National Pesticide Information Center [http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/organic.html Organic Pesticide Ingredients]</ref>  However, under US federal organic standards, if pests and weeds are not controllable through management practices, nor via organic pesticides and herbicides, "a substance included on the National List of synthetic substances allowed for use in organic crop production may be applied to prevent, suppress, or control pests, weeds, or diseases."<ref>[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&SID=622a69a51febf44818ad4c8d3535378f&rgn=div8&view=text&node=7:3.1.1.9.32.3.354.7&idno=7 Code of Federal Regulations 7 CRF § 205.206(2e)]</ref>   Several groups have called for organic standards to prohibit [[nanotechnology]] on the basis of the [[precautionary principle]]<ref name="Paull">Paull, J. & Lyons, K.

==Public perception==

There is widespread public belief that organic food is safer, more nutritious, and tastes better than conventional food;  these beliefs have fueled increased demand for organic food despite higher prices.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006/><ref name=Smith-Spangler2012 /><ref name=Dangour2009 /><ref name=Canavari2009>Canavari, M., Asioli, D., Bendini, A., Cantore, N., Gallina Toschi, T., Spiller, A., Obermowe, T., Buchecker, K. and Lohmann, M. (2009). [http://orgprints.org/17208/2/deliverable_1_2_sensory_literature.pdf Summary report on sensory-related socio-economic and sensory science literature about organic food products]</ref>

Psychological effects such as the [[Halo effect|“halo” effect]] which are related to the choice and consumption of organic food and which may be akin to religious experiences in some people are in addition important motivating factors in the purchase of organic food.<ref name="Blair1" /> An example of the halo effect was demonstrated by Schuldt and Schwarz.<ref name="Schuldt">Schuldt, J.P. and Schwarz, N. (2010). [http://journal.sjdm.org/10/10509/jdm10509.html The “organic” path to obesity? Organic claims influence calorie judgments and exercise recommendations]. Judgment and Decision Making 5: 144–150.</ref> Their results showed that university students inferred that organic cookies were lower in calories and could be eaten more often than conventional cookies. This effect was observed even when the nutrition label conveyed an identical calorie content. The effect was more pronounced among participants who were strong supporters of organic production and had strong feelings about environmental issues. The perception that organic food is low-calorie food or health food appears to be common.<ref name=Blair1/><ref name=" Schuldt "> Schuldt, J.P. and Schwarz, N. (2010). The “organic” path to obesity? Organic claims influence calorie judgments and exercise recommendations. Judgment and Decision Making 5: 144–150.</ref>

===Taste===
A 2009 literature review concluded that in the scientific literature examined, “there is broad agreement ...(that) most studies that have compared the taste and [[organoleptic]] quality of organic and conventional foods report no consistent or significant differences between organic and conventional produce. Therefore, claiming that all organic food tastes different from all conventional food would not be correct. However, among the well-designed studies with respect to fruits and vegetables that have found differences, the vast majority favour organic produce.”<ref name=Bourn/><ref name=Canavari2009/>   There is evidence that some organic fruit is drier than conventionally grown fruit; a slightly drier fruit may also have a more intense flavor due to the higher concentration of flavoring substances.<ref name=Blair1/>

A 2000 FAO report noted an unpublished study in which Golden Delicious apples "were found to be firmer and received higher taste scores than conventionally grown apples"<ref name=FAO>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/X4983E.htm#P99_5536 Food Safety and Quality as Affected by Organic Farming], Twenty Second FAO Regional Conference for Europe, 24-28 Jul-2000.</ref>

Some foods, such as bananas, are picked when unripe, then artificially induced to ripen using a chemical (such as [[propylene]] or [[ethylene]]) while in transit, possibly producing a different taste.<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/story/0,9950,1433606,00.html "Banana Wars"], by Joanna Blythman (The Observer, 13-Mar-2005) and [http://www.honduras.com/fhia/banana.htm "Bananas & Plantains"], Honduran Agricultural Research Foundation (FHIA).</ref>  The issue of ethylene use in organic food production is contentious; opponents claiming that its use only benefits large companies, and opens the door to weaker organic standards.<ref>[http://www.organicconsumers.org/SOS/controversy120905.cfm "The organic label just won't stick if feds keep this up"], by Julie Deardorff (''Chicago Tribune'', 9-Dec-2005) and [http://www.producenews.com/storydetail.cfm?ID=5564 "Dole urges organics board to approve ethylene use"], by Joan Murphy (''The Produce News'', 22-Nov-2005).</ref>

==Differences in chemical composition of organically and conventionally grown food==
With respect to chemical differences in the composition of organically grown food compared with conventionally grown food, studies have examined differences in [[nutrients]], [[antinutrients]], and [[pesticide]] residues. These studies generally suffer from [[confounding]] variables, and are difficult to generalize due to differences in the tests that were done, and in the methods of testing, and also because the vagaries of agriculture affect the chemical composition of food; these variables include variations in weather (season to season as well as place to place); crop treatments (fertilizer, pesticide, etc.); soil composition; the cultivar used, and in the case of meat and dairy products, the parallel variables in animal production.<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/>  Treatment of the foodstuffs after initial gathering (whether milk is pasteurized or raw), the length of time between harvest and analysis, as well as conditions of transport and storage, also affect the chemical composition of a given item of food.<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/> Additionally, there is evidence that organic produce is drier than conventionally grown produce; a higher content in any chemical category may be explained higher concentration rather than in absolute amounts.<ref name=Blair1/>

===Nutrients===
A 2012 survey of the scientific literature did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products, and found that results varied from study to study.<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/> Produce studies reported on [[ascorbic acid]] ([[Vitamin C]]) (31 studies), [[beta-carotene]] (a precursor for [[Vitamin A]]) (12 studies), and [[alpha-tocopherol]] (a form of [[Vitamin E]]) (5 studies) content;  milk studies reported on beta-carotene (4 studies) and alpha-tocopherol levels (4 studies).  Few studies examined vitamin content in meats, but these found no difference in beta-carotene in beef, alpha-tocopherol in pork or beef, or vitamin A (retinol) in beef.   The authors analyzed 11 other nutrients reported in studies of produce. Only 2 nutrients were significantly higher in organic than conventional produce: [[Phosphorus#Biological_role|phosphorus]] (median difference, 0.15&nbsp;mg/kg [minimum difference, -18&nbsp;mg/kg; maximum difference, 530&nbsp;mg/kg]) and total [[phenols]] (median difference, 31.6&nbsp;mg/kg [minimum difference, -1700&nbsp;mg/kg; maximum difference, 10,480&nbsp;mg/kg]). The result for phosphorus was statistically homogenous, but removal of 1 study reduced the summary effect size and rendered the effect size statistically insignificant. The finding for total phenols was heterogeneous statistically and became statistically insignificant when two studies not reporting sample size were removed. Too few studies of animal products reported on other nutrients for effect sizes to be calculated.  The few studies of milk that the authors found were all (but for one) of [[raw milk]], and suggest that raw organic milk may contain significantly more beneficial [[omega-3 fatty acids]] (median difference, 0.5 g/100 g [minimum difference, 0.23 g/100 g; maximum difference, 4.5 g/100 g]) and [[vaccenic acid]] than raw conventional milk (median difference, 0.26 g/100 g [minimum difference, 0.11 g/100 g; maximum difference, 3.1 g/100 g]).    

Similarly, organic chicken contained higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than conventional chicken (median difference, 1.99 g/100 g [minimum difference, 0.94 g/100 g; maximum difference, 17.9 g/100 g]). The authors found no difference in the protein or fat content of organic and conventional raw milk.  Minor differences in ascorbic acid, protein concentration and several [[micronutrients]] have been identified between organic and conventional foods.<ref name=Magkos2003>Magkos F et al (2003 [http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09637480120092071 Organic food: nutritious food or food for thought?

A 2003 study found that the total phenolic content was significantly higher in organically grown marionberries, strawberries, and corn compared to their conventionally grown counterparts.<ref>Asami, Danny K. [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/sample.cgi/jafcau/2003/51/i05/html/jf020635c.html "Comparison of the Total Phenolic and Ascorbic Acid Content of Freeze-Dried and Air-Dried Marionberry, Strawberry, and Corn Grown Using Conventional, Organic, and Sustainable Agricultural Practices"].

===Anti-nutrients===
The amount of [[nitrogen]] content in certain vegetables, especially green [[leafy vegetables]] and [[tuber]]s, has been found to be lower when grown organically as compared to conventionally.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 />  When evaluating environmental toxins such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], the USDA has noted that organically raised [[chicken]] may have lower [[arsenic]] levels,<ref name=USDA /> while literature reviews found no significant evidence that levels of arsenic, [[cadmium]] or other heavy metals differed significantly between organic and conventional food products.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /><ref name=Blair1/>

===Pesticide residues===
The 2012 meta-analysis determined that detectable pesticide residues were found in 7% of organic produce samples and 38% of conventional produce samples.  Organic produce had 30% lower risk for contamination with any detectable pesticide residue than conventional produce. This result was statistically heterogeneous, potentially because of the variable level of detection used among these studies.  Only 3 studies reported the prevalence of contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits; all were from the European Union.<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/>

===Bacterial contamination===
The 2012 meta-analysis determined that prevalence of E. coli contamination was not statistically significant (7% in organic produce and 6% in conventional produce). Four of the 5 studies found higher risk for contamination among organic produce.  When the authors removed the 1 study (of lettuce) that found higher contamination among conventional produce, organic produce had a 5% greater risk for contamination than conventional alternatives.  While bacterial contamination is common among both organic and conventional animal products, differences in the prevalence of bacterial contamination between organic and conventional animal products were statistically insignificant.<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/>

==Health and safety==

===Health effects of organic food diet===
With respect to scientific knowledge of health benefits from a diet of organic food, several factors limit our ability to say that there is any health benefit, or detriment, from such a diet.  The 2012 meta-analysis noted that "there have been no long-term studies of health outcomes of populations consuming predominantly organic versus conventionally produced food controlling for socioeconomic factors; such studies would be expensive to conduct."<ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/>  The 2009 meta-analysis noted that "Most of the included articles did not study direct human health outcomes. In 10 of the included studies (83%), a primary outcome was the change in antioxidant activity. Antioxidant status and activity are useful biomarkers but do not directly equate to a health outcome. Of the remaining 2 articles, 1 article recorded proxy-reported measures of atopic manifestations as its primary health outcome, whereas the other article examined the fatty acid composition of breast milk and implied possible health benefits for infants from the consumption of different amounts of conjugated linoleic acids from breast milk."<ref name=Dangour2009 />  In addition, as discussed above, difficulties in accurately and meaningfully measuring chemical differences between organic and conventional food make it difficult to extrapolate health recommendations based solely on chemical analysis. 

As of 2012, the scientific consensus is that while "consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food.... the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Food Standards Agency’s Current Stance|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100331234955/http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/organicfood2.pdf|archivedate=March 31, 2010}}</ref> A 12-month systematic review commissioned by the FSA in 2009 and conducted at the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]] based on 50 years' worth of collected evidence concluded that "there is no good evidence that consumption of organic food is beneficial to health in relation to nutrient content."<ref>Sophie Goodchild for the London Evening Standard.  July 29, 2009 [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23725592-details/article.do Organic food 'no healthier' blow.]</ref>  There is no support in the scientific literature that the lower levels of nitrogen in certain organic vegetables translates to improved health risk.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 />

===Consumer safety===
Claims of improved safety of organic food has largely focused on [[pesticide residue]]s.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 />  These concerns are driven by the facts that "(1) acute, massive exposure to pesticides can cause significant adverse health effects;
(2) food products have occasionally been contaminated with pesticides, which can result in acute toxicity; and (3) most, if not all, commercially purchased food contains trace amounts of agricultural pesticides."<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 />  However, as is frequently noted in the scientific literature: "What does not follow from this, however, is that chronic exposure to the trace amounts of pesticides found in food results in demonstrable toxicity. This possibility is practically impossible to study and quantify;" therefore firm conclusions about the relative safety of organic foods have been hampered by the difficulty in proper [[study design]] and relatively small number of studies directly comparing organic food to conventional food.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /><ref name=Bourn /><ref name=Blair1/><ref name=Canavari2009/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Joseph D.|title=A Review of the Nutrition Claims Made by Proponents of Organic Food|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|date=May 2010|volume=9|issue=3|pages=270–277|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00108.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00108.x/full }}</ref>  

Additionally, the Carcinogenic Potency Project,<ref>[http://potency.berkeley.edu/index.html Carcinogenic Potency Project Official Website]</ref> which is a part of the US EPA's Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database Network,<ref>National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) [http://www.epa.gov/ncct/dsstox/ DSSTox Official Website]</ref> has been systemically testing the carcinogenicity of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, and building a publicly available database of the results<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/html/cpdbfs.htm Publicly available Toxnet database from US NLM]</ref> for the past ~30 years.  Their work attempts to fill in the gaps in our scientific knowledge of the carcinogenicity of all chemicals, both natural and synthetic, as the scientists conducting the Project described in the journal, ''Science'', in 1992: <blockquote>Toxicological examination of synthetic chemicals, without similar examination of chemicals that occur naturally, has resulted in an imbalance in both the data on and the perception of chemical carcinogens. Three points that we have discussed indicate that comparisons should be made with natural as well as synthetic chemicals.<br> 
1) The vast proportion of chemicals that humans are exposed to occur naturally. Nevertheless, the public tends to view chemicals as only synthetic and to think of synthetic chemicals as toxic despite the fact that every natural chemical is also toxic at some dose. The daily average exposure of Americans to burnt material in the diet is ~2000 mg, and exposure to natural pesticides (the chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves) is ~1500 mg. In comparison, the total daily exposure to all synthetic pesticide residues combined is ~0.09 mg. Thus, we estimate that 99.99% of the pesticides humans ingest are natural. Despite this enormously greater exposure to natural chemicals, 79% (378 out of 479) of the chemicals tested for carcinogenicity in both rats and mice are synthetic (that is, do not occur naturally). <br>
2) It has often been wrongly assumed that humans have evolved defenses against the natural chemicals in our diet but not against the synthetic chemicals. However, defenses that animals have evolved are mostly general rather than specific for particular chemicals; moreover, defenses are generally inducible and therefore protect well from low doses of both synthetic and natural chemicals.<br> 
3) Because the toxicology of natural and synthetic chemicals is similar, one expects (and finds) a similar positivity rate for carcinogenicity among synthetic and natural chemicals. The positivity rate among chemicals tested in rats and mice is ~50%. Therefore, because humans are exposed to so many more natural than synthetic chemicals (by weight and by number), humans are exposed to an enormous background of rodent carcinogens, as defined by high-dose tests on rodents. We have shown that even though only a tiny proportion of natural pesticides in plant foods have been tested, the 29 that are rodent carcinogens among the 57 tested, occur in more than 50 common plant foods. It is probable that almost every fruit and vegetable in the supermarket contains natural pesticides that are rodent carcinogens.<ref>Gold, L.S., et al (1992) [http://toxicology.usu.edu/endnote/Rodent-carcinogens-setting-priorities.pdf Rodent carcinogens: Setting priorities]. Science 258: 261-265</ref></blockquote>

While studies have shown via chemical analysis, as discussed above, that organically grown fruits and vegetables have significantly lower pesticide residue levels, the significance of this finding on actual health risk reduction is debatable as both conventional foods and organic foods generally have pesticide levels well below government established guidelines for what is considered safe.<ref name=MagkosSafety2006 /><ref name=Blair1/><ref name=Smith-Spangler2012/> This view has been echoed by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]<ref name=USDA>{{cite web|last=Gold|first=Mary|title=Should I Purchase Organic Foods?|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/faq/BuyOrganicFoodsC.shtml|publisher=USDA|accessdate=5 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref> and the UK [[Food Standards Agency]].<ref name=FSA>{{cite web|title=Organic food|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110605025656/http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/farmingfood/organicfood/|publisher=UK Food Standards Agency|archivedate=11 June 2011}}</ref>  

A study published by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in 1993 determined that for infants and children, the major source of exposure to pesticides is through diet.<ref>National Research Council.
