'''Freckles''' are clusters of concentrated [[melanin]] which are most often visible on people with a fair [[complexion]]. A freckle is also called an "ephelis". Freckles do not have an increased number of melanin producing cells (melanocytes). This is in contrast to [[lentigines]] and [[Mole (skin marking)|moles]].<ref name="Robbins and Cotran">''Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease'' Elsevier. 2005. Page 1232.

Freckles can be found on anyone no matter their genetic background; however, the amount of freckles is [[gene]]tic and is related to the presence of the melanocortin-1 receptor [[melanocortin 1 receptor|MC1R]] gene variant.<ref>{{OMIM|266300|Skin/Hair/Eye Pigmentation, variation in, 2; SHEP2}}</ref> The formation of freckles is triggered by exposure to [[sunlight]]. The exposure to UV-B radiation activates melanocytes to increase melanin production, which can cause freckles to become darker and more visible.

Freckles are predominantly found on the face, although they may appear on any skin exposed to the sun, such as the shoulders. Freckles are rare on [[infant]]s, and more commonly found on [[child]]ren before [[puberty]].
Upon exposure to the sun, freckles will reappear if they have been altered with [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]] or [[laser]]s and not protected from the sun, but do fade with age in some cases. Their intensity can be altered with citric acid.
Freckles are not a skin disorder, but people with freckles generally have a lower concentration of photoprotective melanin and are therefore more susceptible to the harmful effects of UV-radiation. It is suggested that they avoid overexposure and use [[sunscreen]].<ref name="Hanson">{{cite journal |author=Hanson Kerry M.; Gratton Enrico; Bardeen Christopher J. |title=Sunscreen enhancement of UV-induced reactive oxygen species in the skin |doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2006.06.011| journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=1205–12 |year=2006 |pmid=17015167 }}</ref><ref name=Garland>{{cite journal |author=Garland C, Garland F, Gorham E |title=Could sunscreens increase melanoma risk? |url= http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/82/4/614 |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=614–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1546792 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.82.4.614 |pmc=1694089}}</ref>

''Ephelides'' describes a freckle which is flat and light brown or red and fades with reduction of sun exposure.  Ephelides are more common in those with light complexions, although they are found on people with a variety of skin tones. The regular use of sunblock can inhibit their development.

[[Liver spot]]s (also known as sun spots and [[lentigines]]) are freckles that may not fade in the winter. Rather, they form after years of exposure to the sun. Liver spots are more common in older people.
