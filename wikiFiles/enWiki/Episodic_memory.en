'''Episodic memory''' is the [[memory]] of [[autobiographical]] events ([[time]]s, [[location (geography)|places]], associated [[emotion]]s, and other contextual [[knowledge]]) that can be explicitly stated. It is the collection of past personal experiences that occurred at a particular time and place. For example, recalling the celebration of July 4th (if you are American). This allows you to figuratively travel back in time to remember the event which took place at that particular time and place. <ref>Schacter, Daniel L., Gilbert, Daniel T., and Wegner, Daniel M. "Semantic and episodic memory". Psychology; Second Edition. New York: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 240-241. Print.</ref>

[[Semantic memory|Semantic]] and episodic memory together make up the category of [[declarative memory]], which is one of the two major divisions in memory. The counterpart to declarative, or explicit memory, is [[procedural memory]], or [[implicit memory]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tulving E |title=Precis of Elements of Episodic Memory |journal=Behavioural and Brain Sciences |volume=7 |pages=223–68 |year=1984 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0004440X |issue=2}}</ref> The term Episodic Memory was coined by [[Endel Tulving]] in 1972. He was referring to the distinction between knowing and remembering. Knowing is more factual whereas remembering is a feeling that is located in the past.<ref> [http://dx.doi.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.011] from an article in "Current Biology"</ref>

Tulving has seminally defined three key properties of episodic memory recollection. These are: a subjective sense of time (or mental time travel), connection to the self, and autonoetic consciousness. Autonoetic consciousness refers to a special kind of consciousness that accompanies the act of remembering which enables an individual to be aware of the self in a subjective time. Aside from Tulving, others named the important aspects of recollection which includes visual imagery, narrative structure, retrieval of semantic information and the feelings of familiarity.<ref> [http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/13646613/v11i0007/299_demwc] Hassabis D and Maguire EA. 2007. Deconstructing episodic memory with construction. Trends in Cognitive Sciences (Regul Ed ) 11(7):299-306.</ref>

Events that are recorded into episodic memory may trigger episodic learning, i.e. a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event.<ref>Terry, W. S. (2006). ''Learning and Memory: Basic principles, processes, and procedures''. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc.</ref><ref>Baars, B. J. & Gage, N. M. (2007). ''Cognition, Brain, and Consciousness: Introduction to cognitive neuroscience''. London: Elsevier Ltd.</ref> For example, a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is a result of episodic learning.

One of the main components of episodic memory is the process of recollection. Recollection is a process that elicits the retrieval of contextual information pertaining to a specific event or experience that has previously occurred.

== Nine properties of episodic memory == 

There are essentially nine properties of episodic memory which collectively, distinguish it from other types of memory. It is possible for other types of memory to exhibit a few of these properties, however, episodic memory is unique in that it is the only type of memory which takes into account all nine of these properties: <ref>[http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/resolve/00283932/v47i0011/2305_em] Conway M. A. (2009). Episodic Memory. ''Neuropsychologia'', ''47'', 2305-2306</ref>

*1. Contain summary records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing. 
*2. Retain patterns of activation/inhibition over long periods. 
*3. Often represented in the form of (visual) images. 
*4. They always have a perspective (field or observer).
*5. Represent short time slices of experience. 
*6. They are represented on a temporal dimension roughly in order of occurrence. 
*7. They are subject to rapid forgetting. 
*8. They make autobiographical remembering specific. 
*9. They are recollectively experienced when accessed.

==Cognitive neuroscience==
The formation of new episodic memories requires the [[medial temporal lobe]], a structure that includes the [[hippocampus]]. Without the medial temporal lobe, one is able to form new [[procedural memory|procedural memories]] (such as playing the piano) but cannot remember the events during which they happened (See [[Hippocampus#Role in general memory|the hippocampus and memory]]).

The [[prefrontal cortex]] (and in particular the [[left hemisphere]]) is also involved in the formation of new episodic memories (also known as episodic encoding). Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex can learn new information, but tend to do so in a disordered fashion. For example, they might show normal [[Recall (memory)|recognition]] of an object they had seen in the past, but fail to [[recollection|recollect]] when or where it had been viewed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Janowsky JS, Shimamura AP, Squire LR |title=Source memory impairment in patients with frontal lobe lesions |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1043–56 |year=1989 |pmid=2797412 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(89)90184-X}}</ref> Some researchers believe that the prefrontal cortex helps organize information for more efficient storage, drawing upon its role in [[executive function]]. Others believe that the prefrontal cortex underlies [[semantic]] strategies which enhance encoding, such as thinking about the meaning of the study material or rehearsing it in [[working memory]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Gabrieli JD, Poldrack RA, Desmond JE |title=The role of left prefrontal cortex in language and memory |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=906–13 |year= 1998 |month=February |pmid=9448258 |pmc=33815 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9448258 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.906}}</ref>

===The hippocampus's role in memory storage===
Researchers do not agree about how long episodic memories are stored in the [[hippocampus]]. Some researchers believe that episodic memories always rely on the hippocampus. Others believe the hippocampus only stores episodic memories for a short time, after which the memories are [[memory consolidation|consolidated]] to the [[neocortex]]. The latter view is strengthened by recent evidence that [[neurogenesis]] in the adult hippocampus may ease the removal of old memories and increase the efficiency of forming new memories.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deisseroth K, Singla S, Toda H, Monje M, Palmer TD, Malenka RC |title=Excitation-neurogenesis coupling in adult neural stem/progenitor cells |journal=Neuron |volume= 42 |issue=4 |pages=535–52 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15157417 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627304002661 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(04)00266-1}}</ref>

==Relationship to semantic memory==
[[Endel Tulving]] originally described episodic memory as a record of a person’s experience that held temporally dated information and spatio-temporal relations.<ref name="Tulving 1983">{{cite book|last=Tulving|first=Endel|title=Elements of Episodic Memory|year=1983|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref> A feature of episodic memory that Tulving later elaborates on is that it allows an agent to travel back in time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tulving|first=Endel|title=Episodic Memory: From Mind to Brain|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2002|volume=53|pages=1–25|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135114|pmid=11752477}}</ref>  A current situation may cue retrieval of a previous episode, so that context that colors the previous episode is experienced at the immediate moment. The agent is provided with a means of associating previous feelings with current situations. [[Semantic memory]], on the other hand, is a structured record of facts, concepts and skills that we have acquired. Semantic information is derived from accumulated episodic memory. Episodic memory can be thought of as a "map" that ties together items in semantic memory. For example, all encounters with how a "dog" looks and sounds like will make up the semantic representation of that word. All episodic memories concerning your dog will then reference this single semantic representation of "dog" and, likewise, all new experiences with your dog will modify your single semantic representation of your dog.

Together, semantic and episodic memory make up our declarative memory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tulving|first=Endel|coauthors=Schacter, D.L.|title=Priming and Human Memory Systems|journal=Science|date=19|year=1990|month=January|volume=247|series=4940|pages=301–6 | doi= 10.1126/science.2296719|issue=4940|pmid=2296719}}</ref> They each represent different parts of context to form a complete picture. As such, something that affects episodic memory can also affect semantic memory. For example, anterograde amnesia, from damage of the medial temporal lobe, is an impairment of declarative memory that affects both episodic and semantic memory operations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tulving|first=Endel|coauthors=[[Hans Markowitsch|Hans J. Markowitsch]]|title=Episodic and Declarative Memory: role of the hippocampus|journal=Hippocampus|date=7|year=1998|month=December|volume=8|issue=3|pages=198–204|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-1063(1998)8:3<198::AID-HIPO2>3.0.CO;2-G|pmid=9662134}}</ref> Originally, Tulving proposed that episodic and semantic memory were separate systems that competed with each other in retrieval. However, this theory was rejected when Howard and Kahana completed experiments on latent semantic analysis (LSA) that supported the opposite. Instead of an increase in semantic similarity when there was a decrease in the strength of temporal associations, the two worked together so semantic cues on retrieval were strongest when episodic cues were strong as well.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=M.W.|coauthors=Kahana, M.J.|title=When does semantic similarity help episodic retrieval|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|year=2002|volume=46|pages=85–96|doi=10.1006/jmla.2001.2798}}</ref>

==Age differences==
Activation of specific brain areas (mostly the [[hippocampus]]) seems to be different between younger and older people upon episodic memory retrieval.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Maguire EA, Frith CD |title=Aging affects the engagement of the hippocampus during autobiographical memory retrieval |journal=Brain |volume=126 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1511–23 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12805116 |doi=10.1093/brain/awg157 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12805116}}</ref> Older people tend to activate both left and right [[hippocampus]], while younger people activate only the left one. For more information, see [[aging and memory]].

==Relationship to emotion==
The relationship between [[emotion and memory]] is complex, but generally, emotion tends to increase the likelihood that an event will be remembered later and that it will be remembered vividly. [[Flashbulb memory]] is one example of this.

==Pharmacological enhancement==
In healthy adults, longterm visual episodic memory can be enhanced specifically<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grön G, Kirstein M, Thielscher A, Riepe MW, Spitzer M |title=Cholinergic enhancement of episodic memory in healthy young adults |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=182 |issue=1 |pages=170–9 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16021483 |doi= 10.1007/s00213-005-0043-2}}</ref> through administration of the Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor [[Donepezil]], whereas verbal episodic memory can be improved in persons with the val/val genotype of the val158met polymorphism through administration of the CNS penetrant specific [[Catechol-O-methyl transferase|catecholamine-O-methyltransferase]] inhibitor [[Tolcapone]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Apud JA |title=Tolcapone improves cognition and cortical information processing in normal human subjects |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=1011–20 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17063156 |doi= 10.1038/sj.npp.1301227 |author-separator=, |author2=Mattay V |author3=Chen J |display-authors=3 |last4=Kolachana |first4=Bhaskar S |last5=Callicott |first5=Joseph H |last6=Rasetti |first6=Roberta |last7=Alce |first7=Guilna |last8=Iudicello |first8=Jennifer E |last9=Akbar |first9=Natkai}}</ref> Furthermore, episodic memory is enhanced through [[AZD3480]] a selective agonist at the neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor, which is developed by the company Targacept.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dunbar G |title=Effects of TC-1734 (AZD3480), a selective neuronal nicotinic receptor agonist, on cognitive performance and the EEG of young healthy male volunteers |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=191 |issue=4 |pages=919–29 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17225162 |doi=10.1007/s00213-006-0675-x |author-separator=, |author2=Boeijinga PH |author3=Demazières A |display-authors=3 |last4=Cisterni |first4=C. |last5=Kuchibhatla |first5=R. |last6=Wesnes |first6=K. |last7=Luthringer |first7=R.}}</ref> Currently, there are several other products developed by several companies—including new catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitors with fewer side effects—that aim for improving episodic memory.

==In animals==
{{Main|Episodic-like memory}}

Tulving (1983) proposed that to meet the criteria of episodic memory, evidence of conscious recollection must be provided. Demonstrating episodic memory in the absence of language, and thus in non-human animals, is impossible though because there are no agreed upon non-linguistic behavioral indicators of conscious experience (Griffiths et al., 1999).
 
This idea was first challenged by Clayton and Dickinson in their work with the [[Western Scrub Jay]] (Aphelocoma californica). They were able to demonstrate that these birds may possess an episodic-like memory system as they found that they remember where they cached different food types, and discriminately recovered them depending on the perishability of the item and time that elapsed since caching. Thus, scrub-jays appear to remember the "what-where-and-when" of specific past caching events. The authors argued that such performance meets the behavioral criteria for episodic memory, but referred to the ability as "episodic-like" memory because the study did not address the phenomenological aspects of episodic memory.
 
After a study done by the [[University of Edinburgh]] (2006), [[hummingbird]]s were the first animal to demonstrate two of the aspects of episodic memory— the ability to recall where certain flowers were located and how recently they were visited. Other studies have demonstrated this type of memory in different animal species, such as rats, honey bees, and primates. 

To show that animals do encode and retrieve past experiences relies on the circuitry of the medial temporal lobe, a structure including the hippocampus. Animal lesion studies have provided significant findings related to the importance of particular brain structures in episodic-like memory. For example, hippocampal lesions have severely impacted all three components (what, where, and when) in animals, suggesting that the hippocampus is responsible for detecting novel events, stimuli, and places when forming new memories and on retrieving that information later on.
 
Despite similar neural areas and evidence from experiments, some scholars remain cautious about comparisons to human episodic memory (Suddendorf & Busby, 2003). Purported episodic-like memory often seems fixed to a particular domain or could be explained in terms of procedural or semantic memory. The problem may be better tractable by studying episodic memory's adaptive counterpart: the capacity to flexibly imagine future events. However, a recent experiment addressed one of Suddendorf and Busby (2003)'s specific criticisms (the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis, which states that nonhuman animals can only take actions based on immediate needs, as opposed to future needs). Correia and colleagues demonstrated <!--{{Citation needed}} begin-->{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed#Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=noprint Template-Fact }}<!--{{Citation needed}} end--> that Western scrub-jays can selectively cache different types of foods depending on which type of food they will desire at a future time, offering strong evidence against the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis by demonstrating that scrub-jays can flexibly adjust their behavior based on past experience of desiring a particular food.

==Autobiographical memory==
An '''[[autobiographical memory]]''' is a personal representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to memory of a person's history. An individual does not remember exactly everything that has happened in one's past. Memory is constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what we end up recalling from memory. Autobiographical memory is constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical memory is fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical memories is questionable because of memory distortions.

Autobiographical memories can differ for special periods of life. People recall few personal events from the first years of their lives. The loss of these first events is called childhood or [[infantile amnesia]]. People tend to recall many personal events from adolescence and early adulthood. This effect is called the [[reminiscence bump]]. Finally, people recall many personal events from the last few years. This is called the [[recency effect]]. For adolescents and young adults the reminiscence bump and the recency effect coincide.

It is known that autobiographical memories initially are stored as episodic memories, but it is currently unknown if autobiographical memories are the same as episodic memories or if the autobiographical memories become converted to [[semantic memory|semantic memories]] with time.

==Types==
* '''Specific Events'''
** When you first stepped foot in the [[ocean]].
* '''General Events'''
** What it feels like stepping into the ocean in general. This is a memory of what a personal event is generally like. It might be based on the memories of having stepped in the ocean, many times during the years.
*'''Personal Facts'''
** "Who was the [[Prime Minister of Italy]] when I was born?"
* '''Flashbulb Memories'''
** [[Flashbulb memory|Flashbulb memories]] are critical autobiographical memories about a major event. Some flashbulb memories are shared within a social group:
:: "The assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|John Kennedy]]?"
:: "The assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]?"
:: "The [[STS-51-L|Challenger explosion]]?"
:: "The verdict in the [[O.J. Simpson]] [[O.J. Simpson murder case|trial]]?"
:: "When you learned that [[Princess Diana]] had died?"
:: "When you heard about [[9/11]]?"

==Neural network models==

Episodic memories can be stored in [[autoassociative neural network]]s (e.g., a [[Hopfield network]]) if the stored representation includes information on the spatiotemporal context in which an item was studied.
