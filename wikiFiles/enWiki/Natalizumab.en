'''Natalizumab''' is a [[humanized antibody|humanized]] [[monoclonal antibody]] against the [[cell adhesion molecule]] [[integrin|α4-integrin]]. Natalizumab is used in the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. It is co-marketed by [[Biogen Idec]] and [[Élan]] as '''Tysabri''', and was previously named '''Antegren'''. Natalizumab is administered by [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous infusion]] every 28 days.  The drug is believed to work by reducing the ability of [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[Immune system|immune cells]] to attach to and pass through the cell layers lining the [[intestine]]s and [[blood–brain barrier]].  Natalizumab has proven effective in treating the symptoms of both diseases, preventing relapse, vision loss, cognitive decline and significantly improving [[quality of life]] in people with multiple sclerosis, as well as increasing rates of remission and preventing relapse in Crohn's disease.

Natalizumab was approved in 2004 by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). It was subsequently [[list of withdrawn drugs|withdrawn from the market]] by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare neurological condition [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) when administered in combination with [[interferon beta-1a]], another [[immunosuppressive drug]] often used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.  After a review of safety information and no further deaths, the drug was returned to the US market in 2006 under a special prescription program. As of June 2009, ten cases of PML were known. However, twenty-four cases of PML had been reported since its reintroduction by October 2009, showing a sharp rise in the number of fatalities and prompting a review of the chemical for human use by the [[European Medicines Agency]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pr/67119009en.pdf | format = pdf | title = Meeting highlights from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use | accessdate = 2010-08-31  | publisher = [[European Medicines Agency]] | date = 2009-10-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSLT39797520091029 | date = 2009-10-29| accessdate = 2010-08-31  | agency = [[Reuters]] | title = EU agency reports 24th case of Tysabri infection  | last = Hirschler | first = B | coauthors = Cowell D }}</ref><ref name=June2009>{{cite news |title=Biogen reports 10th case of PML brain infection |agency= [[Reuters]] |author=Clarke T; Orlofsky S; Von Ahn L |date=2009-06-29 | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE55S39X20090629 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 }}</ref> By January 2010, 31 cases of PML were attributed to natalizumab.<ref name = Medscape>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/716536 | title = PML Risk Increases With Repeated Natalizumab Infusions: FDA | last = Jeffrey | first = S | date = 2010-02-05 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | publisher = [[Medscape]] }}</ref>  The FDA did not withdraw the drug from the market because its clinical benefits outweigh the risks involved.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/news/20080801/ms-drug-tysabri-tied-to-brain-infection | title = MS Drug Tysabri Tied to Brain Infection | publisher = [[WebMD]] | last = Hitti | first = M | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | date = 2008-08-01 }}</ref> In the [[European Union]], it has been approved for human use only for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and only then as a monotherapy because the initial cases of PML, and later the fatalities, were said by the manufacturers to be linked to the use of previous medicines by the patients.

===Multiple sclerosis===
{{further2|[[Multiple sclerosis]] and [[Treatment of multiple sclerosis]]}}

Natalizumab was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in people with multiple sclerosis. The studies enrolled individuals with MS who experienced at least one clinical relapse during the prior year and had a Kurtzke [[Expanded Disability Status Scale|EDSS]] score between 0 and 5.  In these trials natalizumab was shown to reduce relapses in individuals with MS by 68% vs. [[placebo]], a margin far greater than had been seen for other approved MS therapies.<ref name = Polman>{{cite journal |author=Polman CH, O'Connor PW, Havrdova E, ''et al.'' |title=A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of natalizumab for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis |journal=[[N.

[[Image:AntibodyChains.svg|thumb|200px|Structure of a generic [[antibody]]]]
Natalizumab is a  [[humanized antibody|humanized]] [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] against alpha-4 (α4) [[integrin]], the first drug developed in the class of selective adhesion molecule inhibitors. α4-integrin is required for [[white blood cell]]s to move into [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and natalizumab's [[mechanism of action]] is believed to be the prevention of immune cells from crossing blood vessel walls to reach affected organs.<ref name=Rice2005>{{cite journal |author=Rice GP, Hartung HP, Calabresi PA |title=Anti-alpha4 integrin therapy for multiple sclerosis: mechanisms and rationale |journal=Neurology |volume=64 |issue=8 |pages=1336–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15851719 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000158329.30470.D0}}</ref>

=== In multiple sclerosis ===
The [[Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms|symptom]]-causing [[lesion]]s of MS are believed to be caused when [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] cells such as [[T-lymphocyte]]s pass through the [[blood–brain barrier]] through interaction with receptors on the [[endothelium|endothelial cells]].  Natalizumab appears to reduce the transmission of immune cells into the [[central nervous system]] by interfering with the [[VLA-4|α4β1-integrin receptor molecules]] on the surfaces of cells.  The effect appears to occur on endothelial cells expressing the [[VCAM-1]] gene, and in [[parenchyma]]l cells expressing the [[osteopontin]] gene.  In animals used to model MS and test therapies, repeated administration of natalizumab reduced migration of [[leukocyte]]s into the brain's parenchyma, and also reduced lesioning, though it is uncertain if this is clinically significant for humans.<ref name="Tysabri label">{{cite web |url=http://tysabri.com/en_US/tysb/footer/TYSABRI-pi.pdf |format=PDF|title=Final TYSABRI PI |accessdate=2008-03-13 |work=}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Individuals with MS dosed with natalizumab demonstrated increased [[CD34]]-expressing cells, with research suggesting a peak in expression after 72 hours.<ref name="pmid18235044">{{cite journal |author=Zohren F, Toutzaris D, Klarner V, Hartung HP, Kieseier B, Haas R |title=The monoclonal anti-VLA4 antibody natalizumab mobilizes CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in humans |journal=[[Blood (journal)|Blood]] |volume= 111|issue= 7|pages= 3893–5|year=2008 |pmid=18235044 |doi=10.1182/blood-2007-10-120329 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18235044}}</ref>

=== In Crohn's disease ===
The interaction of the α4β7 integrin and the [[addressin]] (also known as MADCAM1) endothelial cell receptor is believed to contribute to the chronic bowel inflammation that causes Crohn's disease.  Addressin is primarily expressed in the endothelium of [[venules]] in the small intestine and are critical in guiding T-lymphocytes to [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic tissues]] in [[Peyer's patches]].  In CD patients, sites of active inflammation of the bowel in CD patients have increased expression of addressin, suggesting a connection between the inflammation and the receptor.  Natalizumab may block interaction between the α4β7 integrin and addressin at sites of inflammation.  [[Animal model]]s have found higher levels of VCAM-1 expression in mice with [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and the VCAM-1 gene may also play a part in CD but its role is not yet clear.<ref name = "Tysabri label"/>

== Interactions ==
Natalizumab appears to interact with other immune-modulating drugs to increase the risk of [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML), an often-fatal [[opportunistic infection]] caused by the [[JC virus]].  In 2005, two people taking natalizumab in combination with [[interferon beta-1a]] developed PML.  One died, and the other recovered with disabling [[sequela]]e.<ref name = "nejm-pml1">{{cite journal |author=Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK, Tyler KL |title=Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy complicating treatment with natalizumab and interferon beta-1a for multiple sclerosis |journal=N.

== Legal status ==
Natalizumab was originally approved for treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] in 2004, through the FDA's accelerated [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|Fast Track program]], due to the drug's efficacy in one-year [[clinical trial]]s.  In February 2005, four months after its approval, natalizumab was withdrawn voluntarily by the manufacturer after two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
