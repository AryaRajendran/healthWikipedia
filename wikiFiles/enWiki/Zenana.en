'''Zenana''' ({{lang-fa|'''زنانه'''}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|زنانہ}}}}, {{lang-hi|ज़नाना}}).

== Zenana missions ==

The Zenana missions were by women missionaries, who went to Indian women in their own homes with the aim of converting them to [[Christianity]]. The [[Baptist Missionary Society]] inaugurated Zenana missions to India in the early 19th century. The concept was later taken up by other churches such as the Church of England (the Church of England Zenana Missionary Society, London) and extended to other countries such as China.

By the 1880s, the "Zenana missions" added medical work to their ministry to encourage conversions and became Zenana Bible and Medical Mission. This involved recruiting female doctors, both by persuading female doctors in [[Europe]] to come to India and by encouraging Indian women to study medicine in their pursuit of conversion. They also provided schooling for girls, including the principles of the Christian faith. As a result, the Zenana missions helped break down the male bias against colonial medicine in India to a small extent.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ql0QAAAAIAAJ |title=A history of missions in India |author= Richter, Julius }}</ref>

A 11/17/2011 "Men of the Bible" entry from [http://BibleGateway.com BibleGateway] about the apostle Peter mentions Peter's Syrian mission with Antioch as a center, 44-61 AD, during which he was accompanied by his wife, who became the pioneer zenana missionary.

===Church of England ===
The '''Church of England Zenana Mission''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Anglican]] missionary society that was involved in sending workers to countries such as India (19th and 20th centuries) and [[China]] (late [[Qing Dynasty]], beginning in 1884).
