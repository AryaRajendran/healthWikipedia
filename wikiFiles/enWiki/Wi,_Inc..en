'''Wi, Inc.''' (pronounced as an initialism, "double-u i.") is an [[United States of America|American]] [[medical device|medical device development]] [[corporation]] incorporated and headquartered in [[Englewood, CO]]. Wi specializes in [[blood]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] contact in high-volume disposables, [[therapeutic]] and [[assay]] device development. In 2004, Wi was a Gold Winner of the Medical Design Excellence Awards for the LifePort Kidney Transporter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Design Excellence Awards 2004 Winners|url=http://www.canontradeshows.com/expo/awards/awards/index.php?catId=-1&year=2004&view=View

== History ==
Wi, Inc. was founded by David W. Wright in 2001 in [[Englewood, CO|Englewood]], [[Colorado]].

== Facilities ==
Wi, Inc. was first located in a {{convert|2,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building, but in 2005 the company moved. It is now centered in a {{convert|10,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} location, equipped with a {{convert|400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Clean_room#US_FED_STD_209E_Cleanroom_Standards|class 10,000 clean room]], a blood processing lab, a device lab, and a prototype machine shop.

== Products ==
In the areas of [[biologic medical product|biologics]], [[diagnostics]], and [[therapeutics]], Wi championed many products.

=== Biologics ===
In the field of biologics, Wi specializes in assay development, including custom [[ELISA]], [[flow cytometry]], and [[hematology]] and [[coagulation]], and lab capabilities, including [[cell (biology)|cell]] counting, [[spectrophotometry]], and in-house [[phlebotomy]]. In [[microscopy]], Wi utilizes cellular imaging and fluorescence for enhanced evaluations of assays.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microscopy Services|url=http://www.wiinc.net/services_biologics_microscopy.php

=== Diagnostics ===
Wi works with diagnostic processes and services, including membrane sealing and [[laser welding]]. The majority of Wi's products is in the field of diagnostics, with many [[point-of-care testing|point-of-care tests]] and applications such as [[thermal cycling]] and air bubble venting. Wi has worked on many point-of-care tests, including designing and prototyping a disposable card, hardware, and mixing on-card assay, and readying the [[point-of-care testing|Point-of-Care]] [[DNA]]-[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] test for full [[Personal computer|PC]] control and lab use. For a [[CD4]] [[point-of-care testing|Point-of-Care test]], Wi designed and pilot-built the card, did design assay and integration, and worked with the imaging software and hardware interface.

=== Therapeutics ===
Therapeutics make up a large part of Wi's work, ranging from [[extracorporeal]] system design, [[surgical device]] design, and critical component interface. In 2003, Wi worked on the LifePort Kidney Transporter, a therapeutic designed to support out-of-body kidneys for transplants. Wi designed and scaled-up hardware, disposables, and did the [[verification and validation]] of the product, worked for 11 months on the LifePort, and had a successful launch. This device was unique in that it perfused a nutrient solution while maintaining thermal control, thus extending the viability of the organ for up to 72 hours. The device significantly reduces the risk of Delayed Graft Function, even in DCD (donation after cardiac death) organs.<ref>{{cite web|title=LifePort Clinical Evidence|url=http://www.organ-recovery.com/clinical_evidence.php|publisher=Organ Recovery Systems|accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref> Wi, along with [[IDEO]] and Zevex, received a Gold Medical Device Excellence Award in 2004 for the product. Also a Wi therapeutic, the LumaWave is a therapeutic device built around using ultrasonic waves to soothe pain. Wi took the core technology, developing the basic product configuration, from concept to production in seven months. Wi also produced all aspects of the final device, including production ultrasonic welding systems, proprietary flex-circuit over-mold, ergonomic design and several utility patents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Case Studies - LumaWave|url=http://www.wiinc.net/case_studies_lumawave.php|publisher=Wi, Inc.|accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref>
