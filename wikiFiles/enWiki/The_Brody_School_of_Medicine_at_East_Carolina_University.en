It is the fourth-oldest medical school in North Carolina, Brody School of Medicine was first appropriated funds from the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] in 1974.  Under the leadership of former [[List of East Carolina University administration|Chancellor]] [[Leo Warren Jenkins]] the first class of 28 students enrolled in 1977.

BSOM is ranked as a "top medical school" by U.S. News & World Report in primary care, rural medicine and family medicine.

==History==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pitt County Memorial Hospital.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Vidant Medical Center is the main teaching hospital for BSOM]] -->
In time, East Carolina University was authorized to establish a health affairs division as a foundation for a medical program, and then a one-year medical school whose participants completed their medical education at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Finally in 1974, the General Assembly of North Carolina appropriated the funds to establish a four-year medical school at East Carolina University.

The legislature set forth a threefold mission for the ECU School of Medicine: to increase the supply of primary care physicians to serve the state, to improve health status of citizens in eastern North Carolina, and to enhance the access of minority and disadvantaged students to a medical education.

Since 1977, when the first class of 28 students enrolled in the four-year School of Medicine, the institution has grown dramatically in its teaching, research and patient care roles. Today, it is partnered with [[Vidant Health]] and [[Vidant Medical Center]]. In 1999, it was renamed the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, in recognition of the continuous support of the Brody family, former owners of the [[Brody's]] retail chain.

East Carolina University is a pioneer in minimally invasive [[robotic surgery]]. On May 3, 2000 at East Carolina's Brody School of Medicine, Dr. [[Randolph Chitwood]] performed the first robotic heart valve surgery in North America. Using this technology, surgeons at the school have performed more operations on the heart's [[mitral valve]] than any other center in the world by far.  Today the Brody School of Medicine is home to a [[state of the art]] integrated [[cardiovascular disease]] center, The East Carolina Heart Institute at ECU.<ref>The East Carolina Heart Institute at ECU, http://www.ecu.edu/cs-dhs/echi/index.cfm</ref><ref>Departments and Centers at Brody, http://www.ecu.edu/cs-dhs/med/departments.cfm</ref>
