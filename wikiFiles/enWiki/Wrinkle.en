A '''wrinkle''', also known as a rhytide, is a fold, ridge or crease in the [[skin]].  Skin wrinkles typically appear as a result of [[aging]] processes such as [[glycation]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danby|first=FW|title=Nutrition and aging skin: sugar and glycation|journal=Cln Dermatol|year=2010|month=Jul-Aug|volume=28|series=4|pages=409–411|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref>  habitual sleeping positions,<ref>{{cite web|last=American Academy of Dermatology|title=Causes of Aging|url=http://www.skincarephysicians.com/agingskinnet/basicfacts.html|work=AgingSkinNet|publisher=American Academy of Dermatology|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> loss of body mass, or temporarily, as the result of prolonged immersion in [[water]]. Age wrinkling in the skin is promoted by habitual facial expressions, aging, sun damage, smoking, poor hydration, and various other factors.<ref>Anderson, Laurence. 2006.

==Treatments for aging wrinkles==

===Tretinoin===
Although the exact mode of action of [[tretinoin]] is unknown, current evidence suggests that tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Topical retinoids in the treatment of photoaging| year=2005| month=June| pmid=17166212| author=Stefanaki C, Stratigos A, Katsambas A| journal= J Cosmet Dermatol| volume=4| pages=130–4| doi=10.1111/j.1473-2165.2005.40215.x | issue=2}}</ref> Tretinoin is better known by the [[brand name]] Retin-A.

===Glycosaminoglycans===
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are produced by the body to maintain structural integrity in tissues and to maintain fluid balance. Hyaluronic acid is a type of GAG that promotes collagen synthesis, repair, and hydration. GAGs serve as a natural moisturizer and lubricant between epidermal cells to inhibit the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Topical glycosaminoglycans supplements can help to provide temporary restoration of enzyme balance to slow or prevent matrix breakdown and consequent onset of wrinkle formation.<ref>[http://www.kaviskin.com/info/wrinkles.html Wrinkles] ''Skin Conditions'', KAVI.</ref>

===Dermal fillers===
Dermal fillers are injectable products frequently used to correct wrinkles, and other depressions in the skin. They are often a kind of soft tissue designed to enable injection into the skin for purposes of improving the appearance. The most common products are based on [[hyaluronic acid]] and calcium hydroxylapatite.

===Botulinum toxin===
Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin protein produced by the bacterium ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]''. Botox (abotulinumtoxinA) is a specific form of botulinum toxin manufactured by Allergan Inc (U.S.) for both therapeutic as well as cosmetic use. Besides its cosmetic application, Botox is used in the treatment of other conditions including migraine headache and cervical [[dystonia]] (spasmodic [[torticollis]]) (a neuromuscular disorder involving the head and neck).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Brin MF, Lew MF, Adler CH, Comella CL, Factor SA, Jankovic J, O'Brien C, Murray JJ, Wallace JD, Willmer-Hulme A, Koller M | title=Safety and efficacy of NeuroBloc (botulinum toxin type B) in type A-resistant cervical dystonia | journal=Neurology | year=1999 | pages=1431–8 | volume=53 | issue=7 | pmid=10534247 | doi=10.1212/WNL.53.7.1431}}</ref>

Dysport (abotulinumtoxinA), manufactured by Ipsen, received FDA approval and is now used to treat cervical dystonia as well as glabellar lines in adults.  In 2010, another form of botulinum toxin, one free of complexing proteins, became available to Americans. Xeomin received FDA approval for medical indications in 2010 and cosmetic indications in 2011.

Botulinum toxin treats wrinkles by immobilizing the muscles which cause wrinkles.  It is not appropriate for the treatment of all wrinkles - it is indicated for the treatment of glabellar lines (between the eyebrows) in adults.  Any other usage is not approved by the FDA and is considered "off-label" use.

==Sleep wrinkles==
Sleep wrinkles are created and reinforced when the face is compressed against a pillow or bed surface in side or stomach sleeping positions during sleep.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sarifakioglu|first=Nedim|coauthors=Terzioglu, A.,  Ates, L.,  Aslan, G.|title=A New Phenomenon: 'Sleep Lines' on the Face|journal=Scan J Plast Reconstr Surg Hand Surg|year=2004|volume=38|pages=244–247|doi=10.1080/02844310410027257|issue=4}}</ref> They appear in predictable locations due to the underlying [[superficial muscular aponeurotic system|superficial musculoaponeurotic system]] (SMAS), and are usually distinct from wrinkles of facial expression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fulton|first=James E.|coauthors=Gaminchi, F.|title=Sleep Lines|journal=Dermatol Surg|year=1999|volume=25|pages=59–62|doi=10.1046/j.1524-4725.1999.08073.x|pmid=9935097|issue=1}}</ref> As with wrinkles of facial expression, sleep wrinkles can deepen and become permanent over time, unless the habitual sleeping positions which cause the wrinkles are altered.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sarifakioglu|first=Nedim|coauthors=Terzioglu, A.,  Ates, L.,  Aslan, G.|title=A New Phenomenon: 'Sleep Lines' on the Face|journal=Scan J Plast Reconstr Surg Hand Surg|year=2004|volume=38|pages=244–247 [246]|doi=10.1080/02844310410027257|issue=4}}</ref>

==Water-immersion wrinkling==<!-- This section is linked from [[Water aging]] -->
[[Image:Wrinkly fingers.jpg|thumb|right|A wrinkled finger after a warm bath]]
The wrinkles that occur in skin after prolonged exposure to water are sometimes referred to as ''pruney fingers'' or water aging. This is a temporary [[skin]] condition where the skin on the palms of the hand or feet becomes wrinkly. This wrinkling response may have imparted an evolutionary benefit by providing improved traction in wet conditions,<ref>{{cite journal | doi= 10.1159/000328223 | title= Are Wet-Induced Wrinkled Fingers Primate Rain Treads? | author = Mark Changizi, Romann Weber, Ritesh Kotecha, Joseph Palazzo | journal= Brain, Behavior and Evolution |  year= 2011 | pmid= 21701145 | volume=77 | issue=4 | pages=286–90}}</ref> and a better grasp of wet objects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kareklas|first=Kyriacos|coauthors=Nettle, Daniel; Smulders, Tom V|title=Water-induced finger wrinkles improve handling of wet objects|journal=Biol. Lett.|date=January 9, 2013|month=23 April|volume=9|issue=2|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.0999|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/2/20120999|accessdate=28 January 2013|pages=20120999|pmid=23302867}}</ref> 

In the recent past the common explanation was based on water absorption in the [[keratin]]-laden [[epithelial]] skin when immersed in water,<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/homework/s95618.htm Dr Karl's Homework - Skin Wrinkles in Water (26/1/2000)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> causing the skin to expand and resulting in a larger surface area, forcing it to wrinkle. Usually the tips of the fingers and toes are the first to wrinkle because of a thicker layer of keratin and an absence of hairs which secrete the protective oil called [[sebaceous gland#Sebum|sebum]]. 

In 1935, however, Lewis and Pickering were studying patients with [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]] of the [[median nerve]] when they discovered that skin wrinkling did not occur in the areas of the patients' skin normally innervated by the damaged nerve.  This suggested that the nervous system plays an essential role in wrinkling, so the phenomenon could not be entirely explained simply by water absorption. Recent research shows that wrinkling is related to [[vasoconstriction]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi= 10.1002/mus.10323 | title= Water-immersion wrinkeling is due to vasoconstriction|author= Einar P.V. Wilder-Smith, Adeline Chow| journal=Muscle & Nerve| year=2003| pages=307–311| volume=27| issue=3| pmid=12635117}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10286-004-0172-4 | author=Einar P. V. Wilder-Smith| title=Water immersion wrinkling| journal=Clinical Autonomic Research| year=2004| pages=125–131| volume=14| issue=2 | pmid=15095056}}</ref> Water probably initiates the wrinkling process by altering the balance of [[electrolytes]] in the skin as it diffuses into the hands and soles via their many sweat ducts. This could alter the stability of the membranes of the many neurons that synapse on the many blood vessels underneath skin, causing them to fire more rapidly.  Increased neuronal firing causes blood vessels to constrict, decreasing the amount of fluid underneath the skin.  This decrease in fluid would cause a decrease in tension, causing the skin to become wrinkly.<ref>{{cite book | title= Dermatotoxicology|author= H. Zhai, K.P. Whilem H. L. Maibach| year=2007| pages=280–281| issue=7}}</ref>

This insight resulted in bedside tests for nerve damage and vasoconstriction. Wrinkling is often scored with immersion of the hands for 30 minutes in water or [[EMLA]] cream with measurements steps of 5 minutes, and counting the number of visible wrinkles in time. Not all healthy persons have finger wrinkling after immersion, so it would be safe to say that sympathetic function is preserved if finger wrinkling after immersion in water is observed, but if the
fingers emerge smooth it cannot be assumed that there is a lesion to the autonomic supply or to the peripheral nerves of the hand.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Finger wrinkling after immersion in water| author=G Alvarez, J Eurolo, and P Canales;| journal=British Medical Journal | year=1980| pages=586–587 | doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6240.586-a | volume=281 | issue=6240 | pmid=7427379 | pmc=1713922}}</ref>

==Animals with wrinkles==
Examples of wrinkles can be found in various animal species that grow loose, excess skin, particularly when they are young. Several breeds of [[dog]], such as the [[Pug]] and the [[Shar Pei]], have been bred to exaggerate this trait. In dogs bred for [[dog fighting|fighting]], this is the result of selection for loose skin, which confers a protective advantage. Wrinkles are also associated with [[neoteny]], as they are a trait associated with juvenile animals.
