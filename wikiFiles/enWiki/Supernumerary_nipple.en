A '''supernumerary nipple''' (also known as a '''third nipple''', '''triple nipple''', '''accessory nipple''',<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> '''polythelia''' or the related condition: '''[[Accessory breast|polymastia]]''') is an [[supernumerary body part|additional]] [[nipple]] occurring in [[mammal]]s, including [[human]]s. Often mistaken for [[mole (skin marking)|moles]], supernumerary nipples are diagnosed at a rate of 1 in 18 males and 1 in approximately 50 female humans.<ref name="Bolognia"/><ref name="extraRate">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4202466.stm "Cancer hope over breast gene find"], BBC, 1 September 2005; references the rate of extra nipples appearing in humans.</ref>

The nipples appear along the two vertical "[[milk line]]s", which start in the armpit on each side, run down through the typical nipples and end at the groin. They are classified into eight levels of completeness from a simple patch of hair to a milk-bearing [[breast]] in miniature.<ref>Kajava Y.

''Polythelia'' refers to the presence of an additional nipple alone while ''[[Accessory breast|polymastia]]'' denotes the much rarer presence of additional [[mammary gland]]s.

Although usually presenting on the milk line, pseudomamma can appear as far away as the foot.<ref name="Pseudomamma on the foot: An unusual presentation of supernumerary breast tissue">{{cite web |url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/124/case_presentations/pseudomamma/conde.html |title=Pseudomamma on the foot: An unusual presentation of supernumerary breast tissue |accessdate=2007-12-03 |work=}}</ref>

A possible relationship with [[mitral valve prolapse]] has been proposed.<ref name="pmid10980229">{{cite journal |author=Rajaratnam K, Kumar PD, Sahasranam KV |title=Supernumerary nipple as a cutaneous marker of mitral valve prolapse in Asian Indians |journal=Am.

==Folklore==
According to Ainsley Newson of [[Times Online]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] regarded a third nipple a sign of reinforced femininity while in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], an extra nipple was held to be indicative that the woman concerned was a [[witch]]; the nipple being used to suckle the [[devil]]. The same source asserts that [[Anne Boleyn]] (one of the [[wives of Henry VIII]]) also fell victim of such belief.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newson|first=Ainsley|title=Bond villain's nipple triple gives clues to breast cancer treatment|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article561076.ece|work=[[Times Online]]|publisher=[[Times Newspapers]]|accessdate=3 March 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070304030623/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article561076.ece|archivedate=4 March 2007|date=1 September 2005}}</ref>
