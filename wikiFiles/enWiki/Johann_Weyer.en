'''Johann Weyer''' (in Dutch '''Jan/Johan/Johannes Wier,''' in Latin '''Ioannes Wierus''' and '''Piscinarius''') (1515 &ndash; 24 February 1588) was a Dutch [[physician]], [[occultism|occultist]] and [[demonology|demonologist]], disciple and follower of [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]. He was among the first to publish against the persecution of [[witch]]es. His most influential work is ''[[De praestigiis daemonum|De Praestigiis Daemonum et Incantationibus ac Venificiis]]'' (On the Illusions of the Demons and on Spells and Poisons, 1563).

==Biography==
Weyer was born in [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]], a small town in the [[Duchy of Brabant]] in the [[Habsburg Netherlands]]. He attended the Latin schools in [['s-Hertogenbosch]] and [[Leuven]] and when he was about 14 years of age, he became a live-in student of Agrippa, in [[Antwerp]]. Agrippa had to leave Antwerp in 1532 and he and his student then settled in [[Bonn]], under the protection of prince-bishop [[Hermann von Wied]]. After completing a work on demons in 1533, Agrippa died in 1535, during a trip to France. From 1534, Weyer studied [[medicine]] in Paris and later in [[Orléans]] (It appears unlikely that he obtained the title of [[Doctor (title)|Doctor]] through these studies). Subsequently, he practiced as a physician in his native Grave. In 1545, he was appointed town physician of [[Arnhem]]. In this capacity, he was asked for advice on [[witchcraft]] in a 1548  court case involving a [[fortune teller]]. In spite of a [[subsidy]] from [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Arnhem was no longer able to pay Weyer's salary in 1550 and Weyer moved to [[Cleves]], where he became court doctor to duke [[Wilhelm, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|William the Rich]], through mediation by [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Konrad Heresbach]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/pdf/witchcraft.pdf] ''Witchcraft and Medicine'', Jaroslav Nemec, National Institutes of Health, DHEW Pub. No. (NIH) 76-636</ref> Here he published his major works on demons, magic, and witchcraft, in which he applied a sceptical medical view to reported wonders and supposed examples of magic or witchcraft. He retired from his post in 1578 and was succeeded by his son, [[Galenus Weyer]]. After retirement he completed a medical work on a subject unrelated to witchcraft. He died on 24 February 1588 at the age of 73 in [[Tecklenburg]], while visiting somebody who had fallen ill. He was buried in the local churchyard, which is no longer extant.

==Work and critical reception==
Weyer's works include medical and moral works as well as his more famous critiques of magic and witchcraft:
* ''[[De praestigiis daemonum|De Praestigiis Daemonum et Incantationibus ac Venificiis]]'' (On the Illusions of the Demons and on Spells and Poisons), 1563.
* ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'' (The False Kingdom of the Demons), an appendix to ''De Praestigiis Daemonum'', 1577.
* "Medicarum Observationum rararum liber, 1567, (A book of medical observations on rare, hitherto undescribed diseases), translated into German as:
* "Artzney-Buch von etlichen biß anher unbekandten unnd unbeschriebenen Kranckheiten," 1580
* "De lamiis liber item de commentitiis jejuniis," 1577, (A book on witches together with a treatise on false fasting), translated into German as:

* "De ira morbo," 1577. (On the disease of anger), translated into German as:

* "De scorbuto epitome," 1564 (On scurvy)

Two volume set.

"About 40 people at Casale in Western Lombardy smeared the bolts of the town gates with an ointment to spread the plague. Those who touched the gates where infected and many died. The heirs of the dead and diseased had actually paid people at Casale to smear the gates in order to obtain their inheritances more quickly." -From The Deceptions of Demons, 1583

Weyer criticised the [[Malleus Maleficarum]] and the [[witchhunt|witch hunting]] by the [[Christianity|Christian]] and Civil authorities; he is said to have been the first person that used the term "mentally ill" or melancholy to designate those women accused of practicing witchcraft.<ref>[http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/Bai/martin_weyer.htm] "Four Hundred Years Later: An Appreciation of Johann Weyer" John Martin, Maryland, Books at Iowa 59 (November 1993); (c)The University of Iowa</ref> In a time when [[witch trials]] and executions were just beginning to be common, he sought to derogate the law concerning witchcraft prosecution. He claimed that not only were examples of magic largely incredible but that the crime of witchcraft was literally impossible, so that anyone who confessed to the crime was likely to be suffering some mental disturbance (mainly "melancholy," which was at that time a very flexible category with many different symptoms).

Some scholars have said that Weyer intended to mock the concept of the [[hell]]ish hierarchy that previous [[grimoire]]s had established by writing those two books and entitling his catalogue of demons ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'' (The False Kingdom of the Demons).

Nevertheless, while he defended the idea that the [[Devil]]'s power was not as strong as claimed by the orthodox Christian churches in ''De Praestigiis Daemonum'', he defended also the idea that demons ''did'' have power and could appear before people who called upon them, creating illusions; but he commonly referred to magicians and not to witches when speaking about people who could create illusions, saying they were heretics who were using the Devil's power to do it, and when speaking on witches, he used the term ''mentally ill''.<ref>[http://www.lclark.edu/~schoen/weyer.html]"Will the Real Johann Weyer Please Stand Up?" Thomas J. Schoeneman, 2002</ref>

Moreover, Weyer did not only write the catalogue of demons ''Pseudomonarchia Daemonum'', but also gave their description and the conjurations to invoke them in the appropriate hour and in the name of [[God]] and the [[Trinity]], not to create illusions but to oblige them to do the conjurer's will, as well as advice on how to avoid certain perils and tricks if the demon was reluctant to do what he was commanded or a liar. In addition, he wanted to abolish the prosecution of witches, and when speaking on those who invoke demons (which he called ''spirits'') he carefully used the word ''exorcist''.

Weyer never denied the existence of the Devil and a huge number of other demons of high and low order. His work was an inspiration for other occultists and demonologists, including an anonymous author who wrote the ''[[Lemegeton]]'' (The Lesser Key of Solomon). There were many editions of his books (written in [[Latin]]), especially ''Pseudomonarchia Daemonum'', and several adaptations in English, including Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584).

Weyer's appeal for clemency for those accused of the crime of witchcraft was opposed later in the sixteenth century by the Swiss physician [[Thomas Erastus]] and the French legal theorist [[Jean Bodin]].

== Tributes ==
[[File:Wierturm.jpg|thumb|The Wier tower in Tecklenburg]]

The church of Tecklenburg displays a plaque in memory of Weyer and in 1884 the town erected a tower in his honor, the ''Wierturm''. The Dutch [[human rights]] organization for [[health worker]]s is named the [http://www.johannes-wier.nl/index_uk.php?page=19 Johannes Wier Foundation] after him. Alongside his tutor, [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]], he appears as a character in the [[video game]] ''[[Amnesia: The Dark Descent]]''.

==Family==
Johan was the son of Agnes Rhordam and Theodorus (Dirk) Wier, a merchant of [[hops]], coal and slate, who was a [[schepen]] of [[Grave, North Brabant|Grave]] in the 1520s.  Dirk and Agnes Wier came from [[Zeeland]] and were closely acquainted with [[Maximiliaan van Egmond]] and Françoise de Lannoy, the future in-laws of [[William the Silent]]. Johan had two known siblings, Arnold Wier and the [[Mysticism|mystic]] Mathijs Wier (c.1520–c.1560). In [[Arnhem]], he married Judith Wintgens, with whom he had at least five children.<ref>[http://www.weijer.net/genealogie/304.html Genealogy of Johannes Wier]</ref> After Judith's death he married Henriette Holst. Johan's oldest son, Diederik Wier, became a jurist and diplomat, who in 1566-7, while employed by [[Willem IV van den Bergh]], was involved in the "petitions of grievances about the suppression of heresy" by the Dutch nobility to [[Philip II of Spain]], the rejection of which led to the [[Eighty Years' War]].<ref>Martinus Hageman, [http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/19595/1/19595%20_kwadexvag.pdf He kwade exempel van Gelre], Doctoral dissertation, Nijmegen 2005</ref>
