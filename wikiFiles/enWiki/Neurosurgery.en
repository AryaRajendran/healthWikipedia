'''Neurosurgery''' (or '''neurological surgery''') is the medical specialty concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of disorders which affect any portion of the nervous system including the [[Human brain|brain]], [[spinal cord]], [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]], and extra-cranial cerebrovascular system.<ref>http://www.casattexas.com/NEURObody.cfm</ref><ref>http://www.neurosurgerytoday.org/</ref>

==Education and training==

===In the U.S.===
In the United States, a neurosurgeon must generally complete four years of college, four years of medical school, a one year internship (PGY-1) that is usually affiliated with their residency program, and five to seven years of neurosurgery [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] (PGY-2-7).<ref>http://www.abns.org/content/primary_certification_process.asp</ref> Most, but not all, residency programs have some component of basic science or clinical research. Some programs offer an internal [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] during the residency program as well. Neurosurgeons may pursue an additional training in a fellowship, after residency or in some cases, as a senior resident. These fellowships include [[pediatric]] neurosurgery, trauma/neurocritical care, functional and [[stereotactic]] surgery, surgical neuro-[[oncology]], radiosurgery, neurovascular surgery, [[Interventional neuroradiology]], peripheral nerve, spine surgery and skull base surgery.<ref>http://www.aans.org/medical_students/questions.asp</ref> Neurosurgeons can also pursue fellowship training in [[neuropathology]] and rehabilitation. In the U.S., neurosurgery is considered an extremely competitive specialty composed of only 0.6% of all practicing physicians and attracts only the top students of medical schools per year (with a <60% match rate).

===In the UK===
In the UK, students must gain entry into medical school. MBBS qualification ([[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]]) takes 4–6 years depending on the student's route. The newly qualified Doctor must then complete Foundation training lasting two years; this is a paid training program in a hospital or clinical setting covering a range of medical specialties including surgery. Junior doctors then apply to enter the neurological pathway. Unlike other surgical specialties, it currently has its own independent training pathway which takes around eight years (ST1-8); before being able to sit, consult exams with great amounts of experience behind them, and practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=The society of British neurological surgeons|url=http://www.sbns.org.uk/site/1090/default.aspx|accessdate=11/03/2011}}{{Dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Neuroradiology methods are used in modern neurosurgical diagnosis and treatment, including [[X-ray computed tomography|computer assisted imaging computed tomography (CT)]], [[mri|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]], [[Positron emission tomography|positron emission tomography (PET)]], [[Magnetoencephalography|magnetoencephalography (MEG)]], and the [[stereotactic surgery]]. Some neurosurgical procedures involve the use of MRI and functional MRI intraoperatively.

Microsurgery is utilized in many aspects of neurological surgery. Microvascular anastomosis are required when EC-IC surgery is performed. The clipping of aneurysms is performed using a microscope. Minimally invasive spine surgery utilizes these techniques. Procedures such as microdiscectomy, laminectomy, and artificial discs rely on microsurgery.<ref>http://www.neurosurgery.org/cybermuseum/microneurohall/arhoton.html</ref>

Minimally invasive endoscopic surgery is utilized by neurosurgeons. Techniques such as endoscopic endonasal surgery is used for pituitary tumors, [[craniopharyngioma]]s, chordomas, and the repair of cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Ventricular endoscopy is used for [[colloid cyst]]s and neurocysticercosis. Endoscopic techniques can be used to assist in the evaculation of hematomas and trigeminal neuralgia.
Repair of craniofacial disorders and disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid circulation is done by neurosurgeons, and depending on the situation, maxillofacial and plastic surgeons. Conditions such as chiari malformation, craniosynostosis, and syringomyelia are treated. This is called [[cranioplasty]].

Neurosurgeons are involved in Stereotactic Radiosurgery along with Radiation Oncologists for [[tumor]] and [[Arteriovenous malformation|AVM]] treatment. Radiosurgical methods such as [[Gamma knife]], [[Cyberknife]] and [[Novalis Shaped Beam Surgery]] are used.<ref>http://neurosurgery.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=952</ref>

Neurosurgeons have begun to utilize endovascular image guided procedures for the treatment of [[aneurysm]]s, AVMs, carotid stenosis, strokes, and spinal malformations, and vasospasms. Also, nonvascular procedures such as Vertoplasty and Kyphoplasty are used by neurosurgeons. Techniques such as angioplasty, stenting, clot retrieval, embolization, and diagnostic angiography are utilized.<ref>http://www.mir.wustl.edu/neurorad/internal.asp?NavID=74</ref>

==Conditions==
Other conditions treated by neurosurgeons include:

* [[Spinal disc herniation]]
* [[Cervical spinal stenosis]] and [[Lumbar spinal stenosis]]
* [[Hydrocephalus]]
* [[Head trauma]] (brain hemorrhages, skull fractures, etc.)
* [[Spinal cord]] [[Physical trauma|trauma]]
* [[Physical trauma|Traumatic injuries]] of [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]]
* [[Infections]]
* [[Tumor]]s of the spine, [[spinal cord]] and [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]]
* Intracerebral hemorrhage, such as [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], interdepartmental, and intracellular [[hemorrhage]]s
* Some forms of drug-resistant [[epilepsy]]
* Some forms of [[movement disorder]]s (advanced [[Parkinson's disease]], [[chorea]]){{spaced ndash}}this involves the use of specially developed minimally invasive [[stereotaxy|stereotactic]] techniques (functional, stereotactic neurosurgery) such as [[ablative surgery]] and [[deep brain stimulation]] surgery
* Intractable pain of [[cancer]] or [[Physical trauma|trauma]] patients and cranial/peripheral nerve pain
* Some forms of intractable [[psychiatric]] disorders
* Vascular malformations (i.e., [[arteriovenous malformation]]s, venous angiomas, [[cavernous angioma]]s, capillary telangectasias) of the brain and spinal cord
* [[Moyamoya disease]]
