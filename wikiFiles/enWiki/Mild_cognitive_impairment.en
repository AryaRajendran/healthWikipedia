'''Mild cognitive impairment''' (MCI, also known as '''incipient dementia''', or '''isolated memory impairment''') is a brain function [[syndrome]] involving the onset and evolution of cognitive impairments beyond those expected based on the age and education of the individual, but which are not significant enough to interfere with their daily activities.<ref name="pmid10190820">{{cite journal |author=Petersen RC, Smith GE, Waring SC, Ivnik RJ, Tangalos EG, Kokmen E |title=Mild cognitive impairment: clinical characterization and outcome |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=303–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10190820 |doi=10.1001/archneur.56.3.303}}</ref>  It is often found to be a transitional stage between normal aging and [[dementia]].  Although MCI can present with a variety of symptoms, when memory loss is the predominant symptom it is termed "amnestic MCI" and is frequently seen as a [[prodromal]] stage of [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="Grundman">{{cite journal |author=Grundman M, Petersen RC, Ferris SH, ''et al.'' |title=Mild cognitive impairment can be distinguished from Alzheimer disease and normal aging for clinical trials |journal=Arch. Neurol. |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=59–66 |year=2004 |pmid=14732621 |doi=10.1001/archneur.61.1.59}}</ref>  Studies suggest that these individuals tend to progress to probable Alzheimer’s disease at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year.<ref name="Grundman"/>

Additionally, when individuals have impairments in domains other than memory it is classified as nonamnestic single- or multiple-domain MCI and these individuals are believed to be more likely to convert to other dementias (e.g., [[dementia with Lewy bodies]]).<ref name="pmid16894068">{{cite journal |author=Tabert MH, Manly JJ, Liu X, ''et al.'' |title=Neuropsychological prediction of conversion to Alzheimer disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment |journal=Arch.

Causation of the syndrome in and of itself remains unknown, as therefore do prevention and treatment.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of MCI requires considerable clinical judgement,<ref name="Grundman"/> and as such a comprehensive clinical assessment including clinical observation, [[neuroimaging]], [[blood test]]s and [[neuropsychological test]]ing are best in order to rule out an alternate diagnosis. 
MCI is diagnosed when there is:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morris, J C., Storandt, M., Miller, J. P., McKeel, D. W., Price, J. L., Rubin, E.H. & Berg, L.|title=Mild cognitive impairment represents early-stage Alzheimer disease|journal=Archives of Neurology|year=2001|volume=58|issue=3|pages=387–405|doi=10.1001/archneur.58.3.397}}</ref> 
# Evidence of memory impairment
# Preservation of general cognitive and functional abilities
# Absence of diagnosed dementia

== Neuropathology ==
There is evidence suggesting that although amnestic MCI patients may not meet neuropathologic criteria for Alzheimer's disease, patients may be in a transitional stage of evolving Alzheimer's disease; patients in this hypothesized transitional stage demonstrated diffuse [[amyloid]] in the [[neocortex]] and frequent [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s in the medial [[temporal lobe]].<ref name="pmid16682536">{{cite journal |author=Petersen RC, Parisi JE, Dickson DW, ''et al.'' |title=Neuropathologic features of amnestic mild cognitive impairment |journal=Arch.

There is emerging evidence that [[magnetic resonance imaging]] can observe deterioration, including progressive loss of gray matter in the brain, from mild cognitive impairment to full-blown Alzheimer disease.<ref name="pmid17898323">{{cite journal |author=Whitwell JL, Shiung MM, Przybelski SA, ''et al.'' |title=MRI patterns of atrophy associated with progression to AD in amnestic mild cognitive impairment |journal=Neurology |volume=70 |issue=7 |pages=512–20 |year=2008 |pmid=17898323 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000280575.77437.a2 |pmc=2734138}}</ref>  A technique known as [[Pittsburgh compound B|PiB]] [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] imaging is used to clearly show the sites and shapes of [[beta amyloid]] deposits in living subjects using a {{carbon|11}} [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] that binds selectively to such deposits.<ref name="pmid18263627">{{cite journal |author=Jack CR, Lowe VJ, Senjem ML, ''et al.'' |title=11C PiB and structural MRI provide complementary information in imaging of Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=665–80 |year=2008 |pmid=18263627 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm336| url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/131/3/665 | format = pdf |pmc=2730157 }}</ref> Such tools may help greatly in assisting clinical research for therapies.

{{Main|Alzheimer's disease clinical research}}

There is no proven treatment or therapy for mild cognitive impairment. As MCI may represent a [[Prodrome|prodromal]] state to clinical Alzheimer’s disease, treatments proposed for Alzheimer’s disease, such as [[antioxidant]]s and [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|cholinesterase inhibitors]], may be useful. However, several potential treatments are still under investigation.<ref name="Grundman"/>  Two drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease have been assessed for their ability to treat MCI or prevent progression to full Alzheimer's disease.  [[Rivastigmine]] failed to stop or slow progression to Alzheimer's disease or on cognitive function for individuals with mild cognitive impairment,<ref name="pmid17509485">{{cite journal |author=Feldman HH, Ferris S, Winblad B, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of rivastigmine on delay to diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from mild cognitive impairment: the InDDEx study |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=501–12 |year=2007 |pmid=17509485 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70109-6}}</ref>  and [[donepezil]] showed only minor, short-term benefits and was associated with significant [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]].<ref name="pmid16856114">{{cite journal |author=Birks J, Flicker L |editor1-last=Birks |editor1-first=Jacqueline |title=Donepezil for mild cognitive impairment |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=3 |issue= |pages=CD006104 |year=2006 |pmid=16856114 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006104}}</ref>

In a two-year randomized trial of 168 people with MCI given either high-dose vitamins or placebo, vitamins cut the rate of brain shrinkage by up to half. The vitamins were the three B vitamins [[folic acid]], [[vitamin B6]], and [[vitamin B12]], which inhibit production of the [[amino acid]] [[homocysteine]]. High blood levels of homocysteine are associated with increased risk of cognitive decline,<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCaddon,A. et al|title=Homocysteine and cognitive decline in healthy elderly|journal=Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord|year=2001|volume=12|issue=5|pages=309–313|pmid=11455131|url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?typ=pdf&doi=51275}}</ref> dementia, and cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelland, K.|title=B vitamins found to halve aging brain shrinkage|year=2010|publisher=Reuters Health}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ravaglia, G.
