'''Glaucoma''' is an eye disease in which the optic nerve is damaged in a characteristic pattern. This can permanently damage vision in the affected eye(s) and lead to blindness if left untreated. It is normally associated with increased fluid pressure in the eye ([[aqueous humour]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec20/ch233/ch233a.html |title=Merck Manual Home Edition, "Glaucoma" |publisher=Merck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> The term "[[ocular hypertension]]" is used for people with consistently raised [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) without any associated optic nerve damage. Conversely, the term 'normal tension' or 'low tension' glaucoma is used for those with optic nerve damage and associated visual field loss, but normal or low IOP.

The nerve damage involves loss of [[retinal ganglion cell]]s in a characteristic pattern. The many different subtypes of glaucoma can all be considered to be a type of [[optic neuropathy]]. Raised intraocular pressure (above {{convert|21|mmHg|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is the most important and only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. However, some may have high [[Human eye|eye]] pressure for years and never develop damage, while others can develop nerve damage at a relatively low pressure. Untreated glaucoma can lead to permanent damage of the [[optic nerve]] and resultant [[visual field]] loss, which over time can progress to [[blindness]].

Glaucoma can be roughly divided into two main categories, "open-angle" and "closed-angle" (or "angle closure") glaucoma. The angle refers to the area between the iris and cornea, through which fluid must flow to escape via the trabecular meshwork. Closed-angle glaucoma can appear suddenly and is often painful; visual loss can progress quickly, but the discomfort often leads patients to seek medical attention before permanent damage occurs. Open-angle, chronic glaucoma tends to progress at a slower rate and  patients may not notice they have lost vision until the disease has progressed significantly.

Glaucoma has been called the "silent thief of sight" because the loss of vision often occurs gradually over a long period of time, and symptoms only occur when the disease is quite advanced. Once lost, vision cannot normally be recovered, so treatment is aimed at preventing further loss. Worldwide, glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness after [[cataracts]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kingman|first=S|title=Glaucoma is second leading cause of blindness globally.|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=2004 Nov|volume=82|issue=11|pages=887–8|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862004001100019|pmid=15640929|accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/11/en/844.pdf |title=Global data on visual impairment in the year 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> It is also the leading cause of blindness among African Americans.<ref>[http://www.nei.nih.gov/NEWS/statements/marij.asp" National Eye Institute Statement - "Glaucoma and Marijuana use."]</ref> Glaucoma affects one in 200 people aged 50 and younger, and one in 10 over the age of eighty. If the condition is detected early enough, it is possible to arrest the development or slow the progression with medical and surgical means. Screening for glaucoma in the general population is however unsupported by the evidence.

The word "glaucoma" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γλαύκωμα, "opacity of the crystalline lens". (Cataracts and glaucoma were not distinguished until ''circa'' 1705).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=glaucoma |title=Online Etymology Dictionary, "Glaucoma" |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Acute Angle Closure-glaucoma.jpg|right|thumb|Photo showing conjunctival vessels dilated at the corneal edge (ciliary flush, circumcorneal flush) and hazy cornea characteristic of acute angle closure glaucoma]]
The two main types of glaucoma are open-angle glaucoma and closed-angle glaucoma (also called angle closure glaucoma).
Open-angle glaucoma accounts for 90% of glaucoma cases in the United States.  It is painless and does not have acute attacks.  The only signs are gradually progressive [[visual field loss]], and optic nerve changes (increased [[cup-to-disc ratio]] on [[Ophthalmoscopy|fundoscopic examination]]).

Closed-angle glaucoma accounts for less than 10% of glaucoma cases in the United States, but as many as half of glaucoma cases in other nations (particularly Asian countries).  About 10% of patients with closed angles present with acute angle closure crises characterized by sudden ocular pain, seeing halos around lights, red eye, very high intraocular pressure (>30 mmHg), nausea and vomiting, suddenly decreased vision, and a fixed, mid-dilated pupil. It is also associated with an oval pupil in some cases.  Acute angle closure is an emergency.

Of the several causes for glaucoma, ocular hypertension (increased pressure within the eye) is the most important risk factor in  most glaucomas, but in some populations, only 50% of people with primary open-angle glaucoma actually have elevated ocular pressure.<ref name=Sommer1991>{{cite journal |author=Sommer A, Tielsch JM, Katz J, ''et al.'' |title=Relationship between intraocular pressure and primary open angle glaucoma among white and black Americans.

Other factors can cause glaucoma, known as "secondary glaucomas", including prolonged use of [[steroid]]s (steroid-induced glaucoma); conditions that severely restrict blood flow to the eye, such as severe [[diabetic retinopathy]] and central retinal vein occlusion (neovascular glaucoma); [[Blast-related ocular trauma|ocular trauma]] (angle recession glaucoma); and [[uveitis]] (uveitic glaucoma).

==Pathophysiology==
{{More footnotes|section|date=June 2012}}
[[File:Human eye cross-sectional view grayscale.png|thumb|Human eye cross-sectional view]]
The underlying cause of open-angle glaucoma remains unclear.  Several theories exist on its exact etiology.  However, the major risk factor for most glaucomas, and the focus of treatment, is increased  [[intraocular pressure]], i.e. [[ocular hypertension]]. Intraocular pressure is a function of production of liquid [[aqueous humor]] by the [[ciliary processes]] of the eye, and its drainage through the [[trabecular meshwork]].   Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the [[posterior chamber]], bounded posteriorly by the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] and the [[zonules of Zinn]], and anteriorly by the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].  It then flows through the [[pupil]] of the iris into the [[anterior chamber]], bounded  posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the [[cornea]].  From here, the trabecular meshwork drains aqueous humor via [[Schlemm's canal]] into [[Intrascleral plexus|scleral plexuses]]  and general blood circulation.<ref name=Alguire>{{cite book |author=Alguire P |chapter=The Eye Chapter 118 Tonometry>Basic Science|editor=Walker HK, Hall WD, Hurst JW |title=Clinical methods: the history, physical, and laboratory examinations |publisher=Butterworths|location=London |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-409-90077-X |edition=3rd |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201/?partid=222#A3607}}</ref>

In open/wide-angle glaucoma, flow is reduced through the trabecular meshwork, due to the degeneration and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, whose original function is to absorb the aqueous humor. Loss of aqueous humor absorption leads to increased resistance and thus a chronic, painless buildup of pressure in the eye.<ref name=Mozaffarieh2008>{{cite journal |author=Mozaffarieh M, Grieshaber MC, Flammer J |title=Oxygen and blood flow: players in the pathogenesis of glaucoma |journal=Mol Vis. |volume=14 |pages=224–33 |year=2008|pmid=18334938 |pmc=2267728 |url=http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v14/a28/}}</ref> In close/narrow-angle, the iridocorneal angle is completely closed because of forward displacement of the final roll and root of the iris against the cornea, resulting in the inability of the aqueous fluid to flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber and then out of the trabecular network. This accumulation of aqueous humor causes an acute increase of pressure and pain.

The inconsistent relationship of glaucomatous optic neuropathy with ocular hypertension has provoked hypotheses and studies on anatomic structure, eye development, nerve compression trauma, optic nerve blood flow, excitatory neurotransmitter, trophic factor, retinal ganglion cell/axon degeneration, glial support cell, immune system, aging mechanisms of neuron loss, and severing of the nerve fibers at the scleral edge.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hasnain|first=Syed S|title=Scleral edge, not optic disc or retina is the primary site of injury in chronic glaucoma|pmid=16824694|journal=Medical Hypotheses|year=2006|volume=67|pages=1320–1325|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.05.030|issue=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Osborne NN, Wood JP, Chidlow G, Bae JH, Melena J, Nash MS |title=Ganglion cell death in glaucoma: what do we really know? |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=83 |issue=8 |pages=980–6|year=1999 |month=August |pmid=10413706 |pmc=1723166 |url=http://bjo.bmj.com/content/83/8/980.full |doi=10.1136/bjo.83.8.980}}</ref><ref name=Levin2008>{{cite journal |author=Levin LA, Peeples P |title=History of neuroprotection and rationale as a therapy for glaucoma |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=14 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=S11–4 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18284310 |url=http://www.ajmc.com/publications/supplement/2008/2008-02-vol14-n1Suppl/Feb08-2896pS11-S14/ |format=}}</ref><ref name=Varma2008>{{cite journal |author=Varma R, Peeples P, Walt JG, Bramley TJ |title=Disease progression and the need for neuroprotection in glaucoma management |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=14 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=S15–9 |year=2008 |month=February|pmid=18284311 |url=http://www.ajmc.com/publications/supplement/2008/2008-02-vol14-n1Suppl/Feb08-2897pS15-S19/ |format=}}</ref><ref name=Hernandez2008>{{cite journal|author=Hernández M, Urcola JH, Vecino E |title=Retinal ganglion cell neuroprotection in a rat model of glaucoma following brimonidine, latanoprost or combined treatments |journal=Exp Eye Res. |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=798–806 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18394603 |doi=10.1016/j.exer.2008.02.008}}</ref><ref name=Cantor2006>{{cite journal |author=Cantor LB |title=Brimonidine in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension |journal=Ther Clin Risk Manag |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=337–46 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=18360646 |pmc=1936355 |doi=10.2147/tcrm.2006.2.4.337 }}</ref><ref name=Schwartz2007>{{cite journal |author=Schwartz M |title=Modulating the immune system: a vaccine for glaucoma? |journal=Can J Ophthalmol. |volume=42|issue=3 |pages=439–41 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17508041 |doi=10.3129/I07-050 }}</ref><ref name=Morrison2006>{{cite journal |author=Morrison JC|title=INTEGRINS IN THE OPTIC NERVE HEAD: POTENTIAL ROLES IN GLAUCOMATOUS OPTIC NEUROPATHY (AN AMERICAN OPHTHALMOLOGICAL SOCIETY THESIS) |journal=Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc |volume=104 |pages=453–77 |year=2006 |pmid=17471356 |pmc=1809896 }}</ref><ref name=Knox2007>{{cite journal |author=Knox DL, Eagle RC, Green WR |title=Optic nerve hydropic axonal degeneration and blocked retrograde axoplasmic transport: histopathologic features in human high-pressure secondary glaucoma |journal=Arch Ophthalmol. |volume=125 |issue=3 |pages=347–53 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17353405 |doi=10.1001/archopht.125.3.347}}</ref><ref name=Tezel2007>{{cite journal |author=Tezel G, Luo C, Yang X |title=Accelerated Aging in Glaucoma: Immunohistochemical Assessment of Advanced Glycation End Products in the Human Retina and Optic Nerve Head |journal=Invest.

==Diagnosis==
Screening for glaucoma is usually performed as part of a standard [[eye examination]] performed by [[optometrist]]s, [[orthoptist]]s and [[ophthalmologist]]s. Testing for glaucoma should include measurements of the intraocular pressure via [[tonometry]], changes in size or shape of the eye, anterior chamber angle examination or [[gonioscopy]], and examination of the optic nerve to look for any visible damage to it, or change in the [[cup-to-disc ratio]] and also rim appearance and vascular change. A formal [[perimetry|visual field test]] should be performed.  The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as [[optical coherence tomography]], [[scanning laser polarimetry]], and/or [[scanning laser ophthalmoscopy]], also known as Heidelberg retina tomography.<ref name=Pardianto2006/><ref name=Thomas2006>{{cite journal |author=Thomas R, Parikh RS |title=How to assess a patient for glaucoma |journal=Community Eye Health |volume=19 |issue=59 |pages=36–7 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=17491713 |pmc=1705629 }}</ref>

Owing to the sensitivity of all methods of tonometry to corneal thickness, methods such as [[tonometry|Goldmann tonometry]] should be augmented with [[pachymetry]] to measure central corneal thickness (CCT).  A thicker-than-average cornea can result in a pressure reading higher than the 'true' pressure, whereas a thinner-than-average cornea can produce a pressure reading lower than the 'true' pressure.

Because pressure measurement error can be caused by more than just CCT (i.e., corneal hydration, elastic properties, etc.), it is impossible to 'adjust' pressure measurements based only on CCT measurements.  The [[Frequency Doubling Illusion|frequency doubling illusion]] can also be used to detect glaucoma with the use of a frequency doubling technology perimeter.<ref name="Johnson2003">Johnson, Chris A.

Washington, D.C.: The American Psychological Association.</ref>

Examination for glaucoma also could be assessed with more attention given to sex, race, history of drug use, refraction, inheritance and family history.<ref name="Pardianto2006">Pardianto G et al. Some difficulties on Glaucoma. Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2006;3: 49-52.</ref>

==Screening==
The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] as of 2005 states there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for glaucoma.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Screening for Glaucoma: Recommendation Statement|journal=The Annals of Family Medicine|date=1 March 2005|volume=3|issue=2|pages=171–172|doi=10.1370/afm.294}}</ref> There is thus no national screening programs in the US. There is in the UK. Those at risk are advised to have a [[dilated fundus examination|dilated eye examination]] at least once a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nihseniorhealth.gov/glaucoma/toc.html |title=Glaucoma - National Institutes of Health |publisher=Nihseniorhealth.gov|date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref>

==Management==
The modern goals of glaucoma management are to avoid glaucomatous damage and nerve damage, and preserve visual field and total quality of life for patients, with minimal side effects.<ref name=Necker2006>{{cite journal |author=Noecker RJ |title=The management of glaucoma and intraocular hypertension: current approaches and recent advances |journal=Ther Clin Risk Manag |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=193–206 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=18360593 |pmc=1661659 |doi=10.2147/tcrm.2006.2.2.193 }}</ref><ref name=Parikh2007>{{cite journal |author=Parikh RS, Parikh SR, Navin S, Arun E, Thomas R |title=Practical approach to medical management of glaucoma |journal=Indian J Ophthalmol |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=223–30 |date=1 May 2008|pmid=18417824 |url=http://www.ijo.in/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=2008;volume=56;issue=3;spage=223;epage=230;aulast=Parikh |doi=10.4103/0301-4738.40362 |pmc=2636120 }}</ref> This requires appropriate diagnostic techniques and follow-up examinations, and judicious selection of treatments for the individual patient. Although intraocular pressure is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment.

Vascular flow and neurodegenerative theories of glaucomatous optic neuropathy have prompted studies on various neuroprotective therapeutic strategies, including nutritional compounds, some of which may be regarded by clinicians as safe for use now, while others are on trial.

===Balance and postural control===
Because of the important role of the [[visual system]] in balance and maintaining posture in human beings, glaucoma patients should consider themselves at greater risk of falls, and would be advised to take the necessary precautions to help prevent any accidents.  In addition, since the peripheral visual system has such a high contribution to this intrinsic balancing mechanism, the severity of glaucoma and degree of visual field obstruction should also be considered.<ref>Wade M., and Jones, G. (1997) The role of vision and spatial organization in the maintenance of posture. Physical Therapy.  77, 619-628</ref>  Because of the relationship of glaucoma with age, other associated factors affecting balance (i.e. impaired [[proprioception]]) may also be present, further increasing the risk of falls.  Of interesting note, one cohort of open-angle glaucoma patients had their ability to maintain posture measured (via measurements of sway) in binocular (two-eyed) and monocular (one-eyed, using both affected and unaffected eyes) conditions, as well as with their eyes closed.  These patients had increased sway (worse balance) in their one-eyed conditions compared to the two-eyed conditions, and reduced sway (better balance) when using one eye than when their eyes were closed, but there were no significant differences between the two monocular conditions, with the unaffected eye having only slightly (but not significantly) reduced sway than when using their affected eyes. All patients in each condition displayed increased sway compared to their age-matched controls.<ref>Shabana, N, et al.  (2005)  Postural stability in open angle glaucoma.  Clinical and Experimental opthamology.  33, 264-273</ref>

===Medication===
{{Main|Glaucoma medication}}
[[Intraocular pressure]] can be lowered with medication, usually eye drops.  Several different classes of medications are used to treat glaucoma, with several different medications in each class.

Each of these medicines may have local and systemic side effects.  Adherence to medication protocol can be confusing and expensive; if side effects occur, the patient must be willing either to tolerate them, or to communicate with the treating physician to improve the drug regimen.  Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes.<ref name="BMC Ophthalmol">{{cite journal |author=Leffler CT, Amini L |title=Interpretation of uniocular and binocular trials of glaucoma medications: an observational case series |journal=BMC Ophthalmol |volume=7 |issue= |page=17 |year=2007 |pmid=17916260 |pmc=2093925 |doi=10.1186/1471-2415-7-17 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2415/7/17}}</ref>

Poor compliance with medications and follow-up visits is a major reason for vision loss in glaucoma patients.  A 2003 study of patients in an [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]] found half failed to fill their prescriptions the first time, and one-fourth failed to refill their prescriptions a second time.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/ref/health/healthguide/esn-glaucoma-ess.html Health Guide: A New Understanding of Glaucoma], ''New York Times'', July 15, 2009</ref> Patient education and communication must be ongoing to sustain successful treatment plans for this lifelong disease with no early symptoms.

* [[Prostaglandin analogs]], such as [[latanoprost]] (Xalatan), [[bimatoprost]] (Lumigan) and [[travoprost]] (Travatan), increase uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor. Bimatoprost also increases trabecular outflow.
* Topical [[beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists]], such as [[timolol]], [[levobunolol]] (Betagan),  and [[betaxolol]], decrease aqueous humor production by the [[ciliary body]].
* [[Alpha2-adrenergic agonist]]s, such as [[brimonidine]] (Alphagan) and [[apraclonidine]], work by a dual mechanism, decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow.
* Less-selective [[Alpha-adrenergic agonist|alpha agonists]], such as [[epinephrine]], decrease aqueous humor production through vasoconstriction of ciliary body blood vessels, useful only in open-angle glaucoma. Epinephrine's mydriatic effect, however, renders it unsuitable for closed-angle glaucoma due to further narrowing of the uveoscleral outflow (i.e. further closure of trabecular meshwork, which is responsible for absorption of aqueous humor).
* [[Miotic agents]] ([[parasympathomimetic]]s), such as [[pilocarpine]], work by contraction of the [[ciliary muscle]], opening the [[trabecular meshwork]] and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour. [[Echothiophate]], an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used in chronic glaucoma.
* [[Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors]], such as [[dorzolamide]] (Trusopt), [[brinzolamide]] (Azopt), and [[acetazolamide]] (Diamox), lower secretion of aqueous humor by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body.
* [[Physostigmine]] is also used to treat glaucoma.
* [[Marijuana]] was found, in the early 1970s, to reduce pressure in the eyes, though how the cannabinoids in marijuana produce this effect remains unknown.

===Surgery===
[[Image:Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma EDA11.JPG|thumb|Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma makes a new opening in the meshwork, which helps fluid to leave the eye and lowers intraocular pressure.]]
{{Main|Glaucoma surgery}}

Both [[Laser surgery|laser]] and conventional surgeries are performed to treat glaucoma.  Surgery is the primary therapy for those with [[congenital]] glaucoma.<ref>{{OMIM|231300|Glaucoma, Congenital: GLC3 Buphthalmos}}</ref>  Generally, these operations are a temporary solution, as there is not yet a cure for glaucoma.

====Canaloplasty====
Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure using micro[[catheter]] technology. To perform a canaloplasty, an incision is made into the eye to gain access to the [[Schlemm's canal]] in a similar fashion to a viscocanalostomy. A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.

By opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved, although the reason is unclear, since the canal (of Schlemm) does not have any significant fluid resistance in glaucoma or healthy eyes. Long-term results are not available.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shingleton B, Tetz M, Korber N |title=Circumferential viscodilation and tensioning of Schlemm's canal (canaloplasty) with temporal clear corneal phacoemulsification cataract surgery for open-angle glaucoma and visually significant cataract: one-year results |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=433–40 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18299068 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2007.11.029 |url=http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(08)00004-7/abstract}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lewis RA, von Wolff K, Tetz M, ''et al.'' |title=Canaloplasty: circumferential viscodilation and tensioning of Schlemm's canal using a flexible microcatheter for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma in adults: interim clinical study analysis |journal=J Cataract Refract Surg |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=1217–26 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17586378 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2007.03.051 |url=http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(07)00697-9/abstract}}</ref>

====Laser surgery====
Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) may be used to treat open-angle glaucoma. It is a temporary solution, not a cure. A 50-μm argon laser spot is aimed at the trabecular meshwork to stimulate opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an [[argon]] laser trabeculoplasty procedure.

A newer type of laser trabeculoplasty uses a "cold" (nonthermal) laser to stimulate drainage in the trabecular meshwork. This newer procedure, selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), uses a 532-nm, frequency-doubled, Q-switched [[Nd:YAG laser]], which selectively targets [[melanin]] pigment in the trabecular meshwork cells. Studies show SLT is as effective as ALT at lowering eye pressure. In addition, SLT may be repeated three to four times, whereas ALT can usually be repeated only once.

Nd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) may be used in patients susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or [[pigment dispersion syndrome]]. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.

Diode laser cycloablation lowers IOP by reducing aqueous secretion by destroying secretory ciliary epithelium.<ref name = "Pardianto2006"/>

====Trabeculectomy====
The most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma is the [[trabeculectomy]]. Here, a partial thickness flap is made in the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye. Scarring can occur around or over the flap opening, causing it to become less effective or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as [[mitomycin C]] (MMC, 0.5-0.2&nbsp;mg/ml) or [[5-fluorouracil]] (5-FU, 50&nbsp;mg/ml), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as collagen matrix implant<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cillino|first=S|coauthors=Pace F Di, Cillino G, Casuccio A|title=Biodegradable collagen matrix implant vs mitomycin-C as an adjuvant in trabeculectomy: a 24-month, randomized clinical trial|journal=Eye|date=|year=2011|month=Sept|doi=10.1038/eye.2011.219|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21921953|accessdate=3 November 2011|pmid=21921953|volume=25|issue=12|pages=1598–606}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Papaconstantinou|first=Dimitris|coauthors=Georgalas I, Karmiris E, Diagourtas A, Koutsandrea C, Ladas I, Apostolopoulos M, Georgopoulos G|title=Trabeculectomy with ologen versus trabeculectomy for the treatment of glaucoma: a pilot study|journal=Acta Ophthalmol|date=|year=2010|month=Feb|volume=88|issue=1|pages=80–85|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-3768.2009.01753.x/abstract|accessdate=3 November 2011|doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.2009.01753.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosentreter|first=Andre|coauthors=Schild AM, Jordan JF, Krieglstein GK, Dietlein TS|title=A prospective randomised trial of trabeculectomy using mitomycin C vs an ologen implant in open angle glaucoma|journal=Eye|date=|year=2010|month=Sept|volume=24|issue=9|pages=1449–57|accessdate=3 November 2011|pmid=20733558|doi=10.1038/eye.2010.106}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Nilforushan|first=Naveed|coauthors=Yadgari M, Falavarjani KG, Afshar AE|title=Evaluation of subconjunctival Oculusgen* implantation as an adjunct to trabeculectomy|journal=Iranian J Ophthalmol|date=|year=2010|month=|volume=22|issue=2|pages=55–62|url=http://www.irjo.org/article-A-10-11-139-1-en.html|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref> or other biodegradable spacers, to prevent super scarring by randomization and modulation of fibroblast proliferation in addition to the mechanical prevention of wound contraction and adhesion.

====Glaucoma drainage implants====
{{Main|Glaucoma valve}}
Professor Anthony Molteno developed the first glaucoma drainage implant, in [[Cape Town]] in 1966.<ref>http://www.glaucoma.org.nz/memberFiles/Eyelights11-05.pdf</ref> Since then, several different types of implants have followed on from the original, the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants. These are indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery (trabeculectomy). The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye into a chamber called a [[bleb (medicine)|bleb]].

* The first-generation Molteno and other nonvalved implants sometimes require the ligation of the tube until the bleb formed is mildly fibrosed and water-tight.<ref name=VicrylTie>{{cite journal |author=Molteno AC, Polkinghorne PJ, Bowbyes JA |title=The vicryl tie technique for inserting a draining implant in the treatment of secondary glaucoma |journal=Aust N Z J Ophthalmol |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=343–54 |year=1986 |month=November |pmid=3814422 |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.1986.tb00470.x }}
</ref> This is done to reduce postoperative hypotony—sudden drops in postoperative intraocular pressure.
* Valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve, attempt to control postoperative hypotony by using a mechanical valve.

The ongoing scarring over the conjunctival dissipation segment of the shunt may become too thick for the aqueous humor to filter through. This may require preventive measures using antifibrotic medications, such as [[5-fluorouracil]] or [[mitomycin-C]] (during the procedure), or other nonantifibrotic medication methods, such as collagen matrix implant,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosentreter|first=Andre|coauthors=Andre M.

====Veterinary implant====
[[TR BioSurgical]] has commercialized a new implant specifically for veterinary medicine, called TR-ClarifEYE.  The implant consists of a new biomaterial, the STAR BioMaterial, which consists of silicone with a very precise homogenous pore size, a property which reduces [[fibrosis]] and improves tissue integration.  The implant contains no valves and is placed completely within the eye without sutures.  To date, it has demonstrated long-term success (longer than a year) in a pilot study in medically refractory [[dogs]] with advanced glaucoma.<ref name="Roberts2008">Roberts S, Woods C.  Effects of a novel porous implant in refractory glaucomatous [[Dog]]s. ACVO abstract 2008, Boston, MA.</ref>

====Laser-assisted nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy====
The most common surgical approach currently used for the treatment of glaucoma is trabeculectomy, in which the sclera is punctured to alleviate intraocular pressure.

Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) surgery is a similar, but modified, procedure, in which instead of  puncturing the scleral wall, a patch of the sclera is skimmed to a level, upon which, percolation of liquid from the inner eye is achieved and thus alleviating intraocular pressure, without penetrating the eye. NPDS is demonstrated to cause significantly fewer side effects than trabeculectomy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  However, NPDS is performed manually and requires great skill<!-- to achieve a lengthy learning curve-->.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Laser-assisted NPDS is performed with the use of a CO<sub>2</sub> laser system. The laser-based system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved. This self-regulation effect is achieved as the CO<sub>2</sub> laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.

==Research==
*[http://www.nei.nih.gov/neitrials/static/study49.asp The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study] is a large American National Eye Institute-sponsored study designed "to assess the long-range outcomes of sequences of interventions involving trabeculectomy and argon laser trabeculoplasty in eyes that have failed initial medical treatment for glaucoma". It recommends different treatments based on race.
*[http://www.nei.nih.gov/earlyglaucoma/index.asp The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial] is another NEI study which found immediate treatment of people who have early-stage glaucoma can delay progression of the disease.
*[http://www.nei.nih.gov/neitrials/static/study24.asp The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study], also an NEI study, found topical ocular hypotensive medication was effective in delaying or preventing onset of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in individuals with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Although this does not imply all patients with borderline or elevated IOP should receive medication, clinicians should consider initiating treatment for individuals with ocular hypertension who are at moderate or high risk for developing POAG.

(Note: [[fludrocortisone]] is not a natural compound, but a steroid.)

;Cannabis
Studies in the 1970s showed [[marijuana]], when smoked or eaten, effectively lowers intraocular pressure by about 25%, as much as standard medications.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&page=174 Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base (1999)], Institute of Medicine, National Academies Press</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&page=174 |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base (1999), Institute of Medicine, National Academies Press |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref><ref name="AOA">{{cite web |publisher=American Academy of Ophthalmology |url=http://one.aao.org/CE/PracticeGuidelines/Therapy_Content.aspx?cid=9871fa42-cf40-4c1f-b05c-c816d5f93126 |title=Complementary Therapy Assessment: Marijuana in the Treatment of Glaucoma |accessdate=2011-05-04 }}</ref> In an effort to determine whether marijuana, or drugs derived from it, might be effective as a glaucoma treatment, the US [[National Eye Institute]] supported research studies from 1978 to 1984.

In 2003, the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] released a position statement which said, "studies demonstrated that some derivatives of marijuana did result in lowering of IOP when administered orally, intravenously, or by smoking, but not when topically applied to the eye. The duration of the pressure-lowering effect is reported to be in the range of 3 to 4 hours".<ref name="AOA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://one.aao.org/CE/PracticeGuidelines/Therapy_Content.aspx?cid=9871fa42-cf40-4c1f-b05c-c816d5f93126 |title=Complementary Therapy Assessments : American Academy of Ophthalmology |publisher=One.aao.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref>

However, the position paper qualified that statement by stating marijuana was not more effective than prescription medications, and "no scientific evidence has been found that demonstrates increased benefits and/or diminished risks of marijuana use to treat glaucoma compared with the wide variety of pharmaceutical agents now available."

===Primary glaucoma and its variants (H40.1-H40.2)===
Primary glaucoma
*Primary angle closure glaucoma, also known as primary closed-angle glaucoma, narrow-angle glaucoma, pupil-block glaucoma, acute congestive glaucoma
:*Acute angle closure glaucoma
:*Chronic angle closure glaucoma
:*Intermittent angle closure glaucoma
:*Superimposed on chronic open-angle closure glaucoma ("combined mechanism" - uncommon)
*Primary open-angle glaucoma, also known as chronic open-angle glaucoma, chronic simple glaucoma, glaucoma simplex
:*High-tension glaucoma
:*Low-tension glaucoma
Variants of primary glaucoma
*[[Pigmentary glaucoma]]
*Exfoliation glaucoma, also known as pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or glaucoma capsulare

'''Primary angle closure glaucoma''' is caused by contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which in turn obstructs outflow of the aqueous humor from the eye. This contact between iris and trabecular meshwork (TM) may gradually damage the function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively "scars").

These cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow. In some cases, pressure may rapidly build up in the eye, causing pain and redness (symptomatic, or so called "acute" angle closure). In this situation, the vision may become blurred, and halos may be seen around bright lights. Accompanying symptoms may include headache and vomiting.

Diagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms: pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain. However, the majority of cases are asymptomatic. Prior to very severe loss of vision, these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye care professional.

Once any symptoms have been controlled, the first line (and often definitive) treatment is laser iridotomy. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse, and prevent, contact between iris and trabecular meshwork. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.

'''Primary open-angle glaucoma''' is when optic nerve damage results in a progressive loss of the visual field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec09/ch103/ch103b.html |title=Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: Glaucoma: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=Merck.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref>  This is associated with increased pressure in the eye.  Not all people with primary open-angle glaucoma have eye pressure that is elevated beyond normal, but decreasing the eye pressure further has been shown to stop progression even in these cases.

The increased pressure is caused by [[trabecular]] blockage. Because the microscopic passageways are blocked, the pressure builds up in the eye and causes imperceptible very gradual vision loss.  Peripheral vision is affected first, but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated.

Diagnosis is made by looking for cupping of the optic nerve. Prostaglandin agonists work by opening uveoscleral passageways.  Beta blockers, such as timolol, work by decreasing aqueous formation. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing formation of Aqueous humor.  Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists ([[brimonidine]], [[apraclonidine]]) both decrease fluid production (via. inhibition of AC) and increase drainage.

'''Neovascular glaucoma''', an uncommon type of glaucoma, is difficult or nearly impossible to treat, and is often caused by proliferative [[diabetic retinopathy]] (PDR) or [[central retinal vein occlusion]] (CRVO). It may also be triggered by other conditions that result in [[ischemia]] of the [[retina]] or [[ciliary body]]. Individuals with poor blood flow to the eye are highly at risk for this condition.

Neovascular glaucoma results when new, abnormal vessels begin developing in the angle of the eye that begin blocking the drainage. Patients with such condition begin to rapidly lose their eyesight. Sometimes, the disease appears very rapidly, especially after cataract surgery procedures. A new treatment for this disease, as first reported by Kahook and colleagues, involves use of a novel group of medications known as anti-VEGF agents. These injectable medications can lead to a dramatic decrease in new vessel formation and, if injected early enough in the disease process, may lead to normalization of intraocular pressure.

'''Toxic glaucoma''' is open angle glaucoma with an unexplained significant rise of [[intraocular pressure]] following unknown pathogenesis. Intraocular pressure can sometimes reach {{convert|80|mmHg|abbr=on}}. It characteristically manifests as [[ciliary body]] inflammation and massive trabecular o[[edema]] that sometimes extends to [[Schlemm's canal]]. This condition is differentiated from malignant glaucoma by the presence of a deep and clear anterior chamber and a lack of aqueous misdirection. Also, the corneal appearance is not as hazy. A reduction in visual acuity can occur followed neuroretinal breakdown.

Associated factors include inflammation, drugs, trauma and intraocular surgery, including cataract surgery and vitrectomy procedures. Gede Pardianto (2005) reported on four patients who had toxic glaucoma. One of them underwent phaecoemulsification with small particle nucleus drops. Some cases can be resolved with some medication, vitrectomy procedures or trabeculectomy. Valving procedures can give some relief, but further research is required.<ref>Pardianto G, Difficulties on glaucoma in Mimbar Ilmiah Oftalmologi Indonesia.2006;3: 48-9.</ref>

===Absolute glaucoma (H44.5)===
Absolute glaucoma is the end stage of all types of glaucoma. The eye has no vision, absence of [[pupillary light reflex]] and [[pupillary response]], and has a stony appearance. Severe pain is present in the eye. The treatment of absolute glaucoma is a destructive procedure like cyclocryoapplication, cyclophotocoagulation, or injection of 99% alcohol.

==Prognosis==
In open-angle glaucoma, the typical progression from normal vision to complete blindness takes about 25 years without treatment.<ref name=Heijl>{{cite journal|last=Heijl|first=Anders|coauthors=Bengtsson, Boel; Hyman, Leslie; Leske, M.
