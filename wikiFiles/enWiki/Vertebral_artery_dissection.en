'''Vertebral artery dissection''' (abbreviated '''VAD''', often '''vertebral dissection''') is a [[Dissection (medical)|dissection]] (a flap-like tear) of the inner lining of the [[vertebral artery]], which is located in the neck and supplies blood to the [[brain]]. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a [[thrombus|blood clot]], thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent [[stroke]] symptoms such as [[dysarthria|difficulty speaking]], [[ataxia|impaired coordination]] and [[visual loss]]. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/>

Vertebral dissection may occur after [[physical trauma]] to the neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g. [[traffic collision]], direct blow to the neck), [[strangulation]] or [[Spinal manipulation|manipulation]], but may also happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either [[antiplatelet drug]]s such as [[aspirin]] or with [[anticoagulant]]s such as [[heparin]] or [[warfarin]].<ref name=Kim/>

Vertebral artery dissection is less common than [[carotid artery dissection]] (dissection of the large arteries in the front of the neck). The two conditions combined account for 10&ndash;25% of non-hemorrhagic strokes in young and middle-aged people. Over 75% recover completely or with minimal impact on functioning, with the remainder having more severe disability and a very small proportion (about 2%) dying from complications.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=Campos/> It was first described in the 1970s by the Canadian neurologist [[Miller Fisher]].<ref name=Campos/>

== Classification ==
Vertebral artery dissection is one of the two types of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]]. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).<ref name=Kim/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Headache|Head pain]] occurs in 50–75% of all cases of vertebral artery dissection. It tends to be located at the back of the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before.<ref name=Kim/> It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common;<ref name=LancetNeurol/> 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.<ref name=Kim>{{cite journal |author=Kim YK, Schulman S |title=Cervical artery dissection: pathology, epidemiology and management |journal=Thromb. Res. |volume=123 |issue=6 |pages=810–21 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19269682 |doi=10.1016/j.thromres.2009.01.013}}</ref>

Obstruction of blood flow through the affected vessel may lead to dysfunction of part of the brain supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("[[transient ischemic attack]]") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies the part of the brain that lies in the [[Posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]] of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a [[posterior circulation infarct]]. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing ([[lateral medullary syndrome]]); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the [[brainstem]]. Others may experience [[ataxia|unsteadiness or lack of coordination]] due to involvement of the [[cerebellum]], and still others may develop [[visual loss]] ([[Homonymous hemianopsia|on one side of the visual field]]) due to involvement of the [[visual cortex]] in the [[occipital lobe]].<ref name=Kim/> In the event of involvement of the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic tracts]] in the brainstem, a partial [[Horner's syndrome]] may develop; this is the combination of a [[ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelid]], [[miosis|constricted pupil]], and an [[Enophthalmos|apparently sunken eye]] on one side of the face.<ref name=Kim/>

If the dissection of the artery extends to the part of the artery that lies inside the skull, [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] may occur (1% of cases). This arises due to rupture of the artery and accumulation of blood in the [[subarachnoid space]]. It may be characterized by a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/>

13–16% of all people with vertebral or carotid dissection have dissection in another cervical artery. It is therefore possible for the symptoms to occur on both sides, or for symptoms of carotid artery dissection to occur at the same time as those of vertebral artery dissection.<ref name=LancetNeurol>{{cite journal |author=Debette S, Leys D |title=Cervical-artery dissections: predisposing factors, diagnosis, and outcome |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=668–78 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19539238 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70084-5}}</ref> Some give a figure of multiple vessel dissection as high as 30%.<ref name=Campos>{{cite journal |author=Campos-Herrera CR, Scaff M, Yamamoto FI, Conforto AB |title=Spontaneous cervical artery dissection: an update on clinical and diagnostic aspects |journal=Arq Neuropsiquiatr |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=922–7 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19099146 |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2008000600036 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-282X2008000600036&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>

== Causes ==

The causes of vertebral artery dissection can be grouped under two main categories, spontaneous and traumatic.

=== Spontaneous ===

Spontaneous cases are considered to be caused by intrinsic factors that weaken the arterial wall.<ref name=Kim/> Only a very small proportion (1–4%) have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder, such as [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome|Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type 4]] and more rarely [[Marfan's syndrome]].<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/> Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, caused by mutations of the ''COL3A'' gene, leads to defective production of the [[collagen, type III, alpha 1]] protein and causes skin fragility as well as weakness of the walls of arteries and internal organs.<ref name=Callewaert>{{cite journal |author=Callewaert B, Malfait F, Loeys B, De Paepe A |title=Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and Marfan syndrome |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=165–89 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18328988 |doi=10.1016/j.berh.2007.12.005}}</ref> Marfan's syndrome results from mutations in the ''[[FBN1]]'' gene, defective production of the protein fibrillin-1, and a number of physical abnormalities including [[Thoracic aortic aneurysm|aneurysm of the aortic root]].<ref name=Callewaert/>

There have also been reports in other genetic conditions, such as [[osteogenesis imperfecta|osteogenesis imperfecta type 1]], [[polycystic kidney disease|autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease]] and [[pseudoxanthoma elasticum]],<ref name=Kim/> [[Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency|α<sub>1</sub> antitrypsin deficiency]] and [[hereditary hemochromatosis]], but evidence for these associations is weaker.<ref name=LancetNeurol/><ref name=Debette>{{cite journal |author=Debette S, Markus HS |title=The genetics of cervical artery dissection: a systematic review |journal=Stroke |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=e459–66 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19390073 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.534669 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/40/6/e459}}</ref> Genetic studies in other connective tissue-related genes have mostly yielded negative results.<ref name=Kim/> Other abnormalities to the blood vessels, such as [[fibromuscular dysplasia]], have been reported in a proportion of cases.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/> [[Atherosclerosis]] does not appear to increase the risk.<ref name=Kim/>

There have been numerous reports of associated risk factors for vertebral artery dissection; many of these reports suffer from [[Scientific method|methodological]] weaknesses, such as [[selection bias]].<ref name=Rubinstein>{{cite journal |author=Rubinstein SM, Peerdeman SM, van Tulder MW, Riphagen I, Haldeman S |title=A systematic review of the risk factors for cervical artery dissection |journal=Stroke |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=1575–80 |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15933263 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000169919.73219.30 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/7/1575}}</ref> Elevated [[homocysteine]] levels, often due to mutations in the ''[[Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase|MTHFR]]'' gene, appear to increase the risk of vertebral artery dissection.<ref name=Debette/><ref name=Rubinstein/> Presence of an [[aortic aneurysm|aneurysm]] of the [[aortic root]] and a history of [[migraine]] may predispose to vertebral artery dissection.<ref name=Rubinstein/>

=== Traumatic ===

Traumatic vertebral dissection may follow blunt trauma to the neck, such as in a [[traffic collision]], direct blow to the neck, or [[strangulation]].<ref name=Kim/> 1–2% of those with major trauma may have an injury to the carotid or vertebral arteries.<ref name=LancetNeurol/> In many cases of vertebral dissection, people report recent very mild trauma to the neck or sudden neck movements, e.g. in the context of playing sports. Others report a recent infection, particularly [[respiratory tract infection]]s associated with [[cough]]ing. It has been difficult to prove the association with mild trauma and infections statistically.<ref name=Kim/> It is likely that many "spontaneous" cases may in fact have been caused by such relatively minor insults in someone predisposed by other structural problems to the vessels.<ref name=Kim/>

Vertebral artery dissection has also been reported in association with some forms of [[spinal manipulation | neck manipulation]].<ref name=Haynes/> There is significant controversy about the level of risk of stroke from neck manipulation.<ref name=Haynes>{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|year=2012|volume=66|issue=10|pages=940–947|title= Assessing the risk of stroke from neck manipulation: a systematic review|author= Haynes MJ, Vincent K, Fischhoff C, Bremner AP, Lanlo O, Hankey GJ.|doi=|pmid=22994328|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2012.03004.x/full}}</ref> It has been suggested that the relationship is causative,<ref name=Ernst2010/> but this is disputed by proponents of this treatment modality,<ref name=Ernst2010>{{cite journal |author= Ernst E |title= Vascular accidents after neck manipulation: cause or coincidence?| journal= Int J Clin Pract |year=2010 |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=673–7 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02237.x |pmid=20518945}}</ref> who believe that the dissection is probably already present before people seek treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Guzman J, Haldeman S, Carroll LJ, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical practice implications of the bone and joint decade 2000–2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders: from concepts and findings to recommendations |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=32 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=S227–43 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19251069 |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.11.023}}</ref> At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.<ref name=Haynes/>

== Mechanism ==

[[File:Vertebral artery 3D AP relabeled.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of the vertebral arteries from a CT scan, seen from the front. From the bottom, V1 is from the subclavian artery to the foramina, V2 is from the foramina to the second vertebra, V3 is between the foramina until entry into the skull, and V4 is inside the skull embedded in the [[dura mater]]. They merge into the basilar artery, which then divides into the [[posterior cerebral artery]].]]
The vertebral arteries arise from the [[subclavian artery]], and run through the [[transverse foramen]] of the upper six [[Cervical vertebrae|vertebrae of the neck]]. After exiting at the level of the first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the [[skull]] through the [[foramen magnum]]. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the [[basilar artery]], which joins the [[circle of Willis]]. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen at the level of the first and second vertebrae. The vertebral artery supplies a number of vital structures in the [[posterior cranial fossa]], such as the [[brainstem]], the [[cerebellum]] and the [[occipital lobe]]s. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.<ref name=Kim/>

Dissection occurs when blood accumulates in the wall of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the [[tunica intima]] (the inner layer), allowing blood to enter the [[tunica media]], although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the [[vasa vasorum]], the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/> Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in [[collagen]] or [[elastin]] genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated [[inflammation]] of the blood vessels, as measured by [[C-reactive protein|highly sensitive C-reactive protein]] (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.<ref name=Kim/>

Once dissection has occurred, two mechanisms contribute to the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to [[ischemia]] (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence increase the risk of [[thrombosis]] (the formation of blood clots) and [[embolism]] (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.<ref name=Kim/>

Subarachnoid hemorrage due to arterial rupture typically occurs if the dissection extends into the V4 section of the artery. This may be explained by the fact that the arterial wall is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=Campos/><ref name=Santos>{{cite journal |author=Santos-Franco JA, Zenteno M, Lee A |title=Dissecting aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar system.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Angio MR.jpg|thumb|Magnetic resonance angiogram of the neck vessels in a person with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV; it shows a dissection of the left internal carotid artery, dissection of both vertebral arteries in their V1 and V2 segments and a dissection of the middle and distal third of the right subclavian artery. Such striking episodes of dissection are typical for this "vascular" subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.]]
Various diagnostic modalities exist to demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] is [[cerebral angiography]] (with or without [[digital subtraction angiography]]).<ref name=Campos/><ref name=Provenzale>{{cite journal |author=Provenzale JM, Sarikaya B |title=Comparison of test performance characteristics of MRI, MR angiography, and CT angiography in the diagnosis of carotid and vertebral artery dissection: a review of the medical literature |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=193 |issue=4 |pages=1167–74 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19770343 |doi=10.2214/AJR.08.1688 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/193/4/1167}}</ref><ref name=Latchaw>{{cite journal |author=Latchaw RE, Alberts MJ, Lev MH, ''et al.'' |title=Recommendations for imaging of acute ischemic stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association |journal=Stroke |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=3646–78 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19797189 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.192616 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/40/11/3646}}</ref> This involves puncture of a large artery (usually the [[femoral artery]]) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the [[aorta]] towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, [[radiocontrast]] is injected and its downstream flow captured on [[fluoroscopy]] (continuous X-ray imaging).<ref name=Kaufman/> The vessel may appear [[stenosis|stenotic]] (narrowed, 41–75%), occluded (blocked, 18–49%), or as an [[aneurysm]] (area of dilation, 5–13%). The narrowing may be described as "rat's tail" or "string sign".<ref name=Kim/> Cerebral angiography is an [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive procedure]], and it requires large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as [[contrast-induced nephropathy|kidney damage]].<ref name=Kaufman>{{cite journal |author=Kaufmann TJ, Kallmes DF |title=Diagnostic cerebral angiography: archaic and complication-prone or here to stay for another 80 years? |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=190 |issue=6 |pages=1435–7 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18492888 |doi=10.2214/AJR.07.3522 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/190/6/1435}}</ref> Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood in the vessel wall, as opposed to more modern modalities.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/> The only remaining use of angiography is when endovascular treatment is contemplated (see below).<ref name=Kim/>

More modern methods involve [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]] ([[Computed tomography angiography|CT angiography]]) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] ([[Magnetic resonance angiography|MR angiography]]). They use smaller amounts of contrast and are not invasive. CT angiography and MR angiography are more or less equivalent when used to diagnose or exclude vertebral artery dissection.<ref name=Provenzale/> CTA has the advantage of showing certain abnormalities earlier, tends to be available outside office hours, and can be performed rapidly.<ref name=Kim/> When MR angiography is used, the best results are achieved in the ''[[Spin-lattice relaxation time|T<sub>1</sub>]]'' setting<ref name=LancetNeurol/> using a protocol known as "fat suppression".<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/><ref name=Campos/> [[Medical ultrasonography#Doppler sonography|Doppler ultrasound]] is less useful as it provides little information about the part of the artery close to the skull base and in the vertebral foramina, and any abnormality detected on ultrasound would still require confirmation with CT or MRI.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/><ref name=Campos/>

== Treatment ==
Treatment is focused on reducing stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery.<ref name=Campos/> Four treatment modalities have been reported in the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: [[anticoagulation]] (using [[heparin]] and [[warfarin]]) and [[antiplatelet drug]]s (usually [[aspirin]]). More rarely, [[thrombolysis]] (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with [[angioplasty]] and [[stent]]ing. No [[randomized controlled trial]]s have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=Menon>{{cite journal |author=Menon R, Kerry S, Norris JW, Markus HS |title=Treatment of cervical artery dissection: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=79 |issue=10 |pages=1122–7 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18303104 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2007.138800}}</ref> [[Surgery]] is only used in exceptional cases.<ref name=Kim/>

===Anticoagulation and aspirin===
[[File:Regular strength enteric coated aspirin tablets.jpg|right|thumb|Aspirin (tablets pictured) is commonly used after stroke. In vertebral artery dissection it appears as effective as anticoagulation with warfarin.]]
From analysis of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that [[aspirin]] and anticoagulation ([[heparin]] followed by [[warfarin]]) are equally effective in reducing the risk of further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsening obstruction of the affected artery.<ref name=Menon/> Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on [[transcranial doppler]] despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/><ref name=Engelter>{{cite journal |author=Engelter ST, Brandt T, Debette S, ''et al.'' |title=Antiplatelets versus anticoagulation in cervical artery dissection |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=2605–11 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17656656 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.489666 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/38/9/2605}}</ref> Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection.<ref name=Kim/> Some regard 3 months as sufficient.<ref name=Campos/>

Professional guidelines in the UK recommend that patients with VA dissection should be enrolled in a [[clinical trial]] comparing aspirin and anticoagulation if possible.<ref>{{NICE|68|Stroke|2008}}</ref> American guidelines state that the benefit of anticoagulation is not currently established.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adams HP, del Zoppo G, Alberts MJ, ''et al.'' |title=Guidelines for the early management of adults with ischemic stroke |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=1655–711 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17431204 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.181486 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/38/5/1655}}</ref>

===Thrombolysis, stenting and surgery===
Thrombolysis, stenting and surgery are not used as widely as anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs. These treatments are invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be unsafe (e.g. an unacceptable bleeding tendency).<ref name=Kim/><ref name=LancetNeurol/>

Thrombolysis is enzymatic destruction of blood clots. This is achieved by the administration of a drug (such as [[urokinase]] or [[alteplase]]) that activates [[plasmin]], an enzyme that occurs naturally in the body and [[fibrinolysis|digests clots]] when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.<ref name=Menon/>

Stenting involves the catheterization of the affected artery during angiography, and the insertion of a mesh-like tube; this is known as "[[Endovascular surgery|endovascular therapy]]" (inside the blood vessel). This may be performed to allow the blood to flow through a severely narrowed vessel, or to seal off an aneurysm. However, it is unclear whether the technical success of the procedure translates into improved outcomes, as in both cases the problem often resolves spontaneously over time.<ref name=Menon/> Stenting, as well as the insertion of [[Guglielmi Detachable Coil|coils]] by means of angiography, may be performed if there is an aneurysm and/or extension of the dissection into the V4 section of the artery.<ref name=Santos/>

Surgery carries a high risk of complications, and is typically only offered in case of inexorable deterioration or contraindications to any of the other treatments. Various arterial repair procedures have been described.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=Santos/>

== Prognosis ==

Prognosis of spontaneous cervical arterial dissection involves neurological and arterial results. The overall functional prognosis of individuals with stroke due to cervical artery dissection does not appear to vary from that of young people with stroke due to other causes. The rate of survival with good outcome (a [[Modified Rankin Scale|modified Rankin score]] of 0–2) is generally about 75%,<ref name=Kim/><ref name=Campos/> or possibly slightly better (85.7%) if antiplatelet drugs are used.<ref name=Kim/> In studies of anticoagulants and aspirin, the combined mortality with either treatment is 1.8-2.1%.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=Menon/>

After the initial episode, 2% may experience a further episode within the first month. After this, there is a 1% annual risk of recurrence.<ref name=Kim/> Those with high [[hypertension|blood pressure]] and dissections in multiple arteries may have a higher risk of recurrence.<ref name=LancetNeurol/> Further episodes of cervical artery dissection are more common in those who are younger, have a family history of cervical artery dissection, or have a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or fibromuscular dysplasia.<ref name=LancetNeurol/>

== Epidemiology ==

The annual incidence is about 1.1 per 100,000 annually in population studies from the [[United States]] and [[France]]. From 1994 to 2003, the incidence increased threefold; this has been attributed to the more widespread use of modern imaging modalities rather than a true increase.<ref name=Kim/> Similarly, those living in urban areas are more likely to receive appropriate investigations, accounting for increased rates of diagnosis in those dwelling in cities. It is suspected that a proportion of cases in people with mild symptoms remains undiagnosed.<ref name=LancetNeurol/>

There is controversy as to whether VAD is more common in men or in women; an aggregate of all studies shows that it is slightly higher incidence in men (56% versus 44%).<ref name=Kim/> Men are on average 37–44 years old at diagnosis, and women 34–44. While dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries accounts for only 2% of strokes (which are usually caused by [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and other risk factors, and tend to occur in the elderly), they cause 10–25% of strokes in young and middle-aged people.<ref name=Kim/><ref name=Campos/>

Dissecting aneurysms of the vertebral artery constitute 4% of all [[cerebral aneurysm]]s, and are hence a relatively rare but important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage.<ref name=Santos/>

== History ==

Spontaneous vertebral artery dissection was described in the 1970s. Prior to this, there had been isolated case reports about carotid dissection. In 1971, [[Miller Fisher|C. Miller Fisher]], a [[Canadian]] [[neurology|neurologist]] and stroke physician working at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], first noted the "string sign" abnormality in carotid arteries on cerebral angiograms of stroke patients, and subsequently discovered that the same abnormality could occur in the vertebral arteries. He reported the discovery in a paper in 1978.<ref name=Campos/><ref name=MillerFisher1978>{{cite journal |author=Fisher CM, Ojemann RG, Roberson GH |title=Spontaneous dissection of cervico-cerebral arteries |journal=Can J Neurol Sci |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=9–19 |year=1978 |month=February |pmid=647502}}</ref><ref name=MillerFisher2001>{{cite journal |author=Fisher CM |title=A career in cerebrovascular disease: a personal account |journal=Stroke |volume=32 |issue=11 |pages=2719–24 |year=2001 |month=November |pmid=11692045 |doi=10.1161/hs1101.098765 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/32/11/2719}}</ref>
