'''Pleomorphic anaplastic neroblastoma''' (PAN) is a striking aspect of [[neuroblastoma]] first described by Cozzutto and Carbone in 1988.<ref name="Cozzutto">Cozzutto C, Carbone A (1988). Pleomorphic (Anaplastic) neuroblastoma. Arch Pathol Lab Med 112:621-625.</ref> Another case was thereafter reported by Cowan, et al. with cytogenetic and immunohistological analysis in a 28-year-old man.<ref>Cowan J, Dayal Y, Schaitzberg S, Tischler AS (1997). Cytogenetic and immunohistological analysis of an adult anaplastic neuroblastoma. Am J Surg Pathol 21(8):957-963.</ref> The case described by Navarro, et al. showed [[MYCN]] amplification (more than 10 copies) and a 1p36 deletion as measured with [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]] in 13% of cells.<ref>Navarro S, Noguera R, Pellin A, Mejia C, Ruiz A, Llombart-Bosch A (2000). Pleomorphic anaplastic neuroblastoma. Med Pediat Oncol 35:449-502.</ref> Additionally there was a main cell population with a DNA index of 2 indicating a [[tetraploid]] DNA content and a high expression of MIBI (Ki-67), bel 2, p53, and [[P-glycoprotein]], either correlated with rapid progression of disease.

==Histopathology==

Appearance of focal or diffuse presence of [[Pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]] and [[anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells is the hallmark of this neuroblastoma variant.<ref name="Cozzutto" /><ref name="Fletcher">Fletcher CDM (2007). Diagnostic Histopatholoy of tumors. Churchill Livingstone, p. 1774. Rosai (2004).</ref><ref name="Rosai">Rosai and Ackerman's Surgical Pathology. Philadelphia, Mosby, p.1128.</ref> Hyperchromatic and bizarre nuclei in neuroblasts and ganglion cells in undifferentiated or poorly differentiated foci are far too [[pathognomonic]], although anaplastic expressions can be found in differentiating foci alike.<ref name="Cozzutto" /><ref name="Fletcher" /><ref name="Rosai" /> Undifferentiated neuroblasts may show enlarged and vesicular nuclei with thick nuclear membranes and prominent nucleoli, often a clue to forthcoming anaplastic change.

==Controversy==

Whether pleomorphism-anaplasia warrants a worse prognosis has not been fully assessed so far. Chatten argued that increasing anaplasia in stage IV in comparison with stage III found in her cases suggested a trend toward higher stage (and worse prognosis) with anaplasia.<ref>Chatten J (1989). Anaplastic neuroblastomas. Letter to the editor. Arch Pathol Lab Med 113:9-10.</ref> However, within-stage differences were not significant, although cases without anaplasia fared better in each stage than those with. Abramowsky's et al. series of 7 children with anaplastic large cell neuroblastoma showed a better survival than previously reported cases.<ref>Abramowsky CR, Katzenstein HM, Alvarado CS, Shehata BM (2009). Anaplastic large cell neuroblastoma. Pediat Devel Pathol 12(1):1-5.</ref> Joshi, et al. did not find any meaningful difference in clinical outcome between cases with or without anaplasia.<ref>Joshi VV, Cantor AB, Altshuler G, Larkin EW et al.
