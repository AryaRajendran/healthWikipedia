== Kahrizak doctor ==
Pourandarjani was responsible for the medical care of several prisoners believed to have been tortured.  One of his patients was [[Mohsen Ruholamini]], a government scientist's son, arrested following his participation in the post-election protests.  Ruholamini, who was 25 years old, died in prison in July 2009.  The death certificate originally identified Ruholamini's cause of death as multiple blows to the head.  A report given to judicial authorities stated that Ruholamini had died of "physical stress, the effects of being held in bad conditions, multiple blows and severe injuries to the body."<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/09/01/world/main5279285.shtml|title=Iranian Doctor Confirms Prison Abuse Death|work=[[CBS News|CBSNews.com]]|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|date=September 1, 2009}}</ref>

Pourandarjani testified before a parliamentary committee investigating misconduct at the Kahrizak jail.<ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/17/AR2009111701664.html|title=Death of prison doctor draws attention in Iran|last=Erdbrink|first=Thomas|date=November 18, 2009|work=[[washingtonpost.com]]|publisher=The Washington Post Company}}</ref>  This jail was subsequently closed by order of [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]], because of the poor conditions there.  An investigation was conducted by Iranian judicial authorities on misconduct in this prison.  In August, former presidential candidate and cleric [[Mehdi Karroubi]] publicly accused Iranian police of having tortured and raped detainees in this prison.  Subsequently, police raided Karroubi's office, confiscating names, addresses, and testimonies of witnesses. In October, the deputy chief of the national police, Brig. Gen. Ahmad-Reza Radan announced that ten persons were under investigation for misconduct at the Kahrizak facility, characterizing the issue as "minor."<ref name="washingtonpost1"/>

Following his testimony, Pourandarjani was arrested by the police.<ref name="guardian1"/> During his imprisonment, Pourandarjani was interrogated several times by the police force's investigative unit, the martial court, and the Physician General's regulatory council.  He was released on bail, warned to say nothing about what he had seen at Kahrizak, and threatened with further imprisonment and with losing his medical licence.<ref name="times1"/> Following his release, the physician also received threats from unknown persons warning him to keep silent about what he had witnessed at the Kahrizak jail.  Shortly prior to his death, Pourandarjani had told his friends that he feared for his safety.<ref name="tehranbureau"/>

== Death ==
Iranian authorities prohibited Pourandarjani's family from performing an autopsy. Pourandarjani was buried in the northern city of [[Tabriz]], and unusual security measures were in place for his funeral.<ref name="tehranbureau"/> Iran's judiciary is reluctant to investigate Pourandarjani's death.<ref name="washingtonpost1"/>

Pourandarjani was born on June 9, 1983 in Tabriz, Iran.  When he was eleven years old, he was admitted to a school for gifted students, and at the age of 13 he was the winner of a national poetry competition.  In 2001, he began his medical studies in [[Ardabil]].  He later transferred to the medical school at the University of Tabriz, and graduated with distinction in 2008.  Pourandarjani was fluent in English and French as well as Persian.<ref>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/11/the-mysterious-death-of-the-kahrizak-doctor.html</ref>

Pourandarjani was a co-author on a paper entitled "Finasteride induced depression: a prospective study," published in [[BMC Clinical Pharmacology]] in October, 2006.  This paper concluded that finasteride, which is used to treat [[benign prostatic enlargement]] and [[male pattern baldness]], might induce depressive symptoms in patients.  At the time, Pourandarjani was doing research at the Drug Applied Research Center at the [[Tabriz University of Medical Sciences]] in  Tabriz, Iran.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1622749/?tool=pubmed Finasteride induced depression: a prospective study]</ref>
