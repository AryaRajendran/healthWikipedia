'''John Benjamin Murphy''', born '''John Murphy'''<ref name=JBMAASP>{{cite web|url=http://sri.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/13/1/1.pdf|title=John Benjamin Murphy (1857-1916): An American Surgical Phenomenon|accessdate=2008-05-14|date=March 2006|publisher=Sage Publications|work=Surgical Innovation|author=Morgenstern, Leon}}</ref> (December 21, 1857 in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]] &ndash; August 11, 1916 [[Mackinac Island, Michigan]]), was an American [[physician]] and [[abdominal]] [[surgeon]] noted for advocating early surgical intervention in appendicitis [[appendectomy]], and several [[eponym]]s: Murphy’s button,<ref name="fluids">Griffith, B.; Yao, J.(2000) [[American_College_of_Surgeons#Publications|Journal of the American College of Surgeons]] ''[http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=Proctoclysis+in+the+Treatment+of+Peritonitis+(the+Murphy+Drip),+The+Journal+A.M.A.,+April+17,+1909&spell=1 A Centennial History of the Chicago Surgical Society.]'' Volume 191 , Issue 4 , Pages 419 - 434.</ref> [[Murphy drip]],<ref name="fluids"/><ref>[[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (April 17, 1909) ''Proctoclysys in the Treatment of Peritonitis (the Murphy Drip).''</ref> [[Murphy's punch sign|Murphy’s punch]], [[Murphy’s test]], and [[Murphy-Lane bone skid]].  He is best remembered for the eponymous clinical sign that is used in evaluating patients with acute [[cholecystitis]].<ref name=JBM11/>  His career spanned general surgery, [[orthopedics]], [[neurosurgery]], and [[cardiothoracic surgery]], which helped him to gain international prominence in the surgical profession.<ref name=JBM11/> [[Mayo Clinic]] co-founder [[William James Mayo]] called him "the surgical genius of our generation".<ref name=JBM11/>

Over the course of his career he was renowned as a surgeon, a clinician, a teacher, an innovator, and an author.  In addition to general surgical operations, such as appendectomy, cholecystostomy, bowel resection for [[intestinal obstruction]], and [[mastectomy]], he performed and described innovative procedures in [[neurosurgery]], [[orthopedics]], [[gynecology]], [[urology]], [[plastic surgery]], [[thoracic surgery]], and [[vascular surgery]].  He also ventured into techniques such as neurorrhaphy, [[arthroplasty]], [[prostatectomy]], [[nephrectomy]], [[hysterectomy]], [[bone grafting]], and thoracoplasty.<ref name=JBMAASP/>

==Life and death==
Murphy was born in a [[log cabin]] in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]].<ref name=JBMAASP/> His parents, Michael Murphy and Ann Grimes Murphy,<ref name=DJBMNSD/> were [[Irish people|Irish]] [[immigrant]]s who escaped from the [[The Great Hunger|potato famine]] and who later raised him on their own farm.<ref name=JBM11>{{cite web|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1183442|title=John Benjamin Murphy (1857–1916)|accessdate=2008-05-16|date=May 2005|publisher=Clinical Medicine & Research|author=Musana, Kenneth and Steven H. Yale}}</ref>  He was a striking, mercurial figure: tall and strong with a red beard and mustache.<ref>Sarah Regal Riedman, ''Masters of the Scalpel: The Story of Surgery'', p.272, Rand McNally, 1962</ref><ref>''The Journal of the International College of Surgeons'', vol.32, no.1, p.20, July 1959.</ref>

Murphy died of [[heart disease]] in [[Mackinac Island, Michigan]] after having been ill for six months.<ref name=DJBMNSD/>  He was staying at the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] and was attended by his wife and Drs. L. L. MacArthur and James Keefe.<ref name=DJBMNSD/>  After he suffered from [[angina pectoris]] for several years,<ref name=JBMAASP/> his death was attributed to [[aortitis]]. Two days prior to his death he correctly predicted the findings of his own [[autopsy]]: "I think the [[necropsy]] will show [[Atheromatous plaque|plaques]] in my [[aorta]]."<ref name=JBM11/>

==Education and training==
Murphy attended public school in Appleton and graduated from [[Appleton Area School District|Appleton High School]] in 1876.<ref name=JBM11/> He obtained a [[doctorate]] from Rush Medical College in 1879 and entered an eighteen-month [[internship]] at [[Cook County Hospital]].  He then practiced there briefly.<ref name=JBM11/><ref name=JBMwnidotc>{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1981.html|title=John Benjamin Murphy|accessdate=2008-05-15|publisher=Ole Daniel Enersen|work=[[Whonamedit.com]]}}</ref> From 1882&ndash;1884 he performed practical work at universities and hospitals in [[Vienna]], [[Munich]], Berlin and [[Heidelberg]].<ref name=DJBMNSD/>  Most of this time was spent working in Vienna with [[Theodor Billroth]],<ref name=JBMwnidotc/> who introduced [[gastrectomy]] techniques that are still in use today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bioportfolio.com/indepth/Gastrectomy.html|title=Gastrectomy|accessdate=2008-05-30|publisher=BioPortfolio Limited |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080508014457/http://www.bioportfolio.com/indepth/Gastrectomy.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-08}}</ref>

==Academic career==
[[File:John B. Murphy clinic.jpg|thumb|left|Image of Dr. John B. Murphy conducting a clinic at [[Mercy Hospital and Medical Center|Mercy hospital]], showing Dr. Murphy, looking at something he is holding in his hands]]

After his [[sojourn]] in [[Europe]], he returned to Chicago to start a general practice.<ref name=DJBMNSD/>  He was quickly recognized as a leader in abdominal surgery and was appointed lecturer in surgery at [[Rush Medical College]] at the end of 1884.  In 1890 he was elected Professor of Surgery.  In 1892, he was named Professor of Clinical Surgery at the [[University of Illinois College of Medicine|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] (currently University of Illinois College of Medicine).<ref name=DJBMNSD/> By 1899, he had become acclaimed for bone surgery.<ref name=DJBMNSD/>  From 1901&ndash;1905 he held a position at the [[Northwestern University Medical School]].  From 1905&ndash;1908, he worked at Rush Medical College, and from 1908&ndash;1916 he returned to Northwestern University Medical School. Meanwhile, he also taught at the [[Graduate Medical School of Chicago]], and from 1895 until his death in 1916, he was the surgeon-in-chief at the Mercy Hospital.<ref name=JBMwnidotc/> From 1908 on he also held a commission in the Army Reserve Medical Corps.

While at Mercy, he developed a following for his "wet clinics", in which he operated and lectured to an audience. Physicians from around the world attended these sessions. The only method for wider dissemination of these lectures and demonstrations was print publication. A secretary transcribed his words, and they were printed as "The Surgical Clinics of John B. Murphy, M.D., at Mercy Hospital, Chicago". This became 'The Surgical Clinics of Chicago", and, subsequently, the "Surgical Clinics of North America",<ref name=JBM11/> which continue in publication in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://surgical.theclinics.com/|title=Surgical Clinics of North America|accessdate=2008-05-30|publisher=Elsevier, Inc.|work=Surgical Clinics of North America}}</ref>

==Notable experiences==
Early in his career, on May 4, 1886, he was one of the doctors summoned to the scene of the [[Haymarket Affair]] in the [[Near West Side, Chicago|Near West Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of Chicago.  He dressed approximately 30 men while working until 3:30 AM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistory.org/hadc/transcript/volumek/551-600/K551-572.htm|title=Illinois vs. August Spies et al. trial transcript no. 1.: Testimony of John B. Murphy, 1886 July 29.|accessdate=2008-05-15|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]}}</ref> A bomb had been thrown at the Chicago Police officers leading to several deaths and a high profile trial, in which Murphy was called to testify.  The labor unrest leading up to and surrounding the events led to the tradition of [[May Day]] labor rallies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/S/SiteHaymarket.html|title=Site of the Haymarket Tragedy|accessdate=2008-05-30|date=|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division.}}</ref>

After an October 14, 1912 assassination attempt on former [[United States President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Roosevelt was brought to Chicago's Mercy Hospital. When he asked Roosevelt about any fears he might have about his bullet wound he said that Roosevelt responded, "I've hunted long enough, Doctor, to know that you can't kill a Bull Moose with a short gun."<ref name=DJBMNSD/>

==Legacy==
Although his surgical prowess was not questioned, his approach to practice was considered pretentious by a segment of his professional colleagues in the U.S.,<ref name=JBM11/> and his work was more highly regarded by his contemporaries in Europe than in Chicago.<ref name=JBM11/> He was an early advocate of intervention via the removal of the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] in all cases of [[appendicitis]].<ref name=JBM11/><ref name=DJBMNSD/><ref name=JBMwnidotc/>  His thoughts were controversial in a time of conservative management of appendicitis.  Having been met with skepticism after his first presentation of appendectomy, he gathered evidence from 250 cases and presented his opinions again as an authority on the subject.<ref name=JBM11/>

He was known for the following [[eponym]]s: Murphy’s button (a mechanical device used for intestinal [[Surgical anastomosis|anastomosis]]), [[Murphy's punch sign|Murphy’s punch]] (a punch tenderness at the costo-vertebral angle in cases of perinephric [[abscess]]), [[Murphy's sign]] (a sign of inflammation of the [[gallbladder]]), Murphy’s test (a test for deep-seated tenderness and muscular rigidity in cases of perinephric abscess), [[Murphy drip]] for administration of fluids by [[proctoclysis]] in patients with [[peritonitis]], and Murphy-Lane bone skid (a common commercial steel instrument used for [[femoral head]] procedures).<ref name=JBM11/><ref name=JBMwnidotc/>  

Murphy developed his eponymous anastomotic button for a [[surgical suture|suture]]less anastomosis of the [[gallbladder]] to the [[duodenum]] (his preferred treatment for acute [[cholecystitis]]), but it was equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it less than a week after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.<ref name=JBMAASP/>

In 1896, Murphy was the first person to successfully unite a [[femoral artery]] severed by a gunshot wound.<ref name=JBMwnidotc/> In 1898, Murphy was first in the United States to induce artificial immobilization and [[pneumothorax|collapse of the lung]] (pneumothorax) in treatment of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]. He pioneered [[bone graft]]ing techniques and made inroads in the management of [[ankylosis]], especially with [[Reconstructive surgery|reconstruction]].<ref name=JBM11/><ref name=JBMwnidotc/>   He was also considered an innovator for surgical intervention for [[prostate cancer]], performance of end-to-end [[anastomosis]] of hollow [[viscera]].<ref name=JBM11/>

In 1912, he performed what was arguably the first [[biliary tract]] [[endoscopy]].<ref name=JBMAASP/>

He was a founding member of the American College of Surgeons.<ref name=JBMAASP/>

==Honors==
He was knighted with the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]] at the direction of [[Pope Benedict XV]] by Archbishop [[George Mundelein]] on June 16, 1916.<ref name=DJBMNSD>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B0CE0D7153AE633A25751C1A96E9C946796D6CF|title=Dr. John B. Murphy, Noted Surgeon, Dies|accessdate=2008-05-14|date=1916-08-12|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]] | format=PDF}}</ref>  He was awarded [[Laetare Medal]] by the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1902, and a [[Doctor of Science]] by [[University of Sheffield]], England in 1908.<ref name=DJBMNSD/>

Although Murphy's flamboyant demeanour and consequent unpopularity among his colleagues kept him from early membership in several professional associations, he was eventually elected President of both the Chicago Medical Society and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).The American Surgical Association realized their mistake and belatedly granted Murphy membership.<ref name=JBMAASP/>

There is a public elementary school named in his honor the John B. Murphy Public School located at 3539 West Grace Street in the [[Irving Park, Chicago|Irving Park]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] on the northwest side of Chicago, which opened in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.murphy.cps.k12.il.us/about.htm|title=John B.
