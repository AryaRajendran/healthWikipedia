A '''prosector''' is a person with the special task of preparing a [[dissection]] for demonstration, usually in [[medical school]]s or [[hospital]]s. Many important [[anatomist]]s began their careers as prosectors working for lecturers and demonstrators in [[anatomy]] and [[pathology]]. 

The act of prosecting differs from that of dissecting. A prosection is a professionally prepared dissection prepared by a prosector – a person who is well versed in anatomy and who therefore prepares a specimen so that others may study and learn anatomy from it. A dissection is prepared by a student who is dissecting the specimen for the purpose of learning more about the anatomical structures pertaining to that specimen. The term dissection may also be used to describe the act of cutting. Therefore, a prosector dissects to prepare a prosection. 

Prosecting is intricate work where numerous tools are used to produce a desired specimen. Scalpels and scissors allow for sharp dissection where tissue is cut, i.e. the biceps brachii muscle was removed from the specimen by cutting the origin and insertion with a scalpel blade.  Probes and the prosector's own fingers are examples of tools used for blunt dissection where tissue may be separated from surrounding structures without cutting, i.e. the bellies of biceps brachii and coracobrachailis were made clearer by loosening the fascia between the two muscles with a blunt probe.

==Occupational risks==

Generally, the risks to prosectors are low. Cadavers used for teaching purposes are [[embalmed]] before they are encountered by a prosector and students. Embalming fluid usually contains formaldehyde, phenol, dettol and glycerine which disinfect and kill pathogens within the cadaver. With exposure to embalming fluid, tissues and bodily fluids, such as blood, become fixed. Prosectors and students working with embalmed cadavers must always wear protective gloves, however this is more for protection against the harsh chemicals used in embalming such as formaldehyde and dettol which can cause moderate to severe skin irritation. 

Further to the protection that embalming allows against disease, educational institutions take great care in screening the cadavers accepted into their body donation programs. Cadavers are not accepted if they have a medical history of infectious disease such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[AIDs]]/[[HIV]].      

Prosectors for [[autopsy|autopsies]] of [[disease]]d [[cadaver]]s may run a high risk of suffering from health problems when caution is not used as cadavers are not fixed when being dissected for autopsy. At least two diseases are named after prosectors:

* [[Prosector's paronychia]]: a primary inoculation of [[tuberculosis]] of the [[skin]] and [[nail (anatomy)|nails]].
* [[Prosector's wart]], a skin lesion, also caused by contamination with tuberculous material

Contracting [[infections]] caused by contaminated cadavers is a constant danger among prosectors, particularly if a skin puncture accident results from the sharp [[surgical instruments]] used in this kind of work (about 70% of pathology workers report having at least one percutaneous incident). In this case, thin [[surgical glove]]s are not enough to protect. There are many cases of pathologists who died of acute [[septicemia]] (blood poisoning) because of this. Another example, a famous historical case, is that of Dr. [[Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow]], an Austrian physician, pathologist and physiologist, who infected his finger during an autopsy and became dependent on [[morphine]], due to the [[pain]]; and, later, on [[cocaine]], by instigation of his friend, [[Sigmund Freud]].

Presently, [[AIDS]] presents a problem. Although it is difficult to contract it by a single puncture incident (the overall personal risk has been estimated to be 0.11%<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Graaf R, Houweling H, van Zessen G |title=Occupational risk of HIV infection among western health care professionals posted in AIDS endemic areas |journal=AIDS Care |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=441–52 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9828964 }}</ref>), at least one case has been reported <ref>{{cite journal |author=Gańczak M, Boroń-Kaczmarska A, Dziuba I |title=Pathologist and HIV—are safe autopsies possible? |journal=Pol J Pathol |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=143–6 |year=2003 |pmid=14575423 }}</ref> among pathologists.

The continuous respiratory exposure to [[formaldehyde]], used to preserve [[cadaver]]s, is also an occupational risk of prosectors as well as medical students, anatomists and pathologists.  Inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, [[headache]], a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty [[breath]]ing. Formaldehyde is listed as a potential human [[carcinogen]].
