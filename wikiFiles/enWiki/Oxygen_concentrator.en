An '''oxygen concentrator''' is a [[machine|device]] providing [[oxygen therapy]] to a [[patient]] at minimally to substantially higher concentrations than available in ambient air. They are used as a safer, less expensive, and more convenient alternative to tanks of compressed [[oxygen]]. Common models retail at around $800. Leasing arrangements may be available through various medical-supply companies and/or insurance agencies.

Oxygen concentrators are also used to provide an economical source of oxygen in industrial processes.

==How oxygen concentrators work==
{{Further2|[[PSA oxygen generator]]}}
Oxygen concentrators operate on the principle of [[pressure swing adsorption]] of atmospheric [[nitrogen]] onto [[zeolite]] minerals.  At high pressure, nitrogen sticks to the surface of the zeolite.  Because the zeolite is extremely porous, it has a very large surface area and can adsorb large volumes of gas.  At low pressure the nitrogen is released.

An oxygen concentrator has two cylinders filled with zeolite pellets.  Air is compressed to a few times normal atmospheric pressure (typically 20 psi/138 [[kPa]] gauge, or 2.36 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s absolute) and passed through the zeolite bed.  The bed adsorbs the nitrogen, leaving nearly-pure oxygen (plus small amounts of [[argon]], [[COâ‚‚]], [[water vapor]] and other minor atmospheric components) in the output.

The zeolite becomes saturated within a few seconds, at which point the compressed air is fed to the second cylinder while the first is vented to ambient pressure, and the nitrogen escapes.  When the second cylinder is saturated, the compressor switches back to the now-available first, and the cycle repeats.

Older units cycled with a period of about 20 seconds, and supplied up to 5 [[liter]]s per minute of 90+% oxygen.  Since about 1999, units capable of supplying up to 10 lpm have been available.

==Portable oxygen concentrators==
Since the year 2000 a number of companies have produced portable oxygen concentrators. Typically, these devices produce one to five liters per minute of oxygen, and they use some version of pulse flow or "demand flow" to deliver oxygen only when the patient is inhaling. However, there are a few portable oxygen concentrators that produce up to three liters per minute of oxygen continuously such as the Invacare Solo2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://open-aire.com/Solo2_portable_oxygen_concentrator.php |title=Solo2 Specifications |publisher=Open-Aire |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref> or SeQual Eclipse. Also, they can provide pulses of oxygen either to provide higher intermittent flows or to reduce the power consumption. 

These portable concentrators typically plug into an [[electrical outlet]] like the larger, heavier stationary oxygen concentrators.

Portable oxygen concentrators usually can also be plugged into the [[direct current|DC]] outlet of a vehicle, and most of these devices have the ability to run from [[electric batteries]], also, for ambulatory use. 

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) of the [[United States]] has approved the use of portable oxygen concentrators on commercial airlines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/cabin_safety/portable_oxygen/ |title=FAA Approved Portable Oxygen Concentrators |publisher=FAA |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref> However, users of these devices should check in advance as to whether a particular brand or model is permitted on a particular airline. Unlike in commercial airlines, users of aircraft without [[cabin pressurization]] need oxygen concentrators which are able to deliver enough flowrate even at high altitudes, such as OXYFLY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxyfly.com/oxyfly-286.html |title=Continuous Oxygen Supply for non-pressurized Aircraft |publisher=OXYFLY |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>

Usually, "demand" or pulse-flow oxygen concentrators are not used by patients while they sleep. There have been problems with the oxygen concentrators not being able to detect when the sleeping patient is inhaling.  Some larger portable oxygen concentrators are designed to operate in continuous-flow mode in addition to pulse-flow mode. Continuous-flow mode is considered safe for night use when coupled with a [[Continuous Positive Airway Pressure|CPAP]] machine.

==Military uses==
Military [[aircraft]] sometimes use [[molecular sieve]] oxygen concentrators (MSOC) to supply the aircrewmen with oxygen at high altitudes. Otherwise, supplies of liquid oxygen are used.

Oxygen concentrators have also been used by the [[Armed Forces of the United States]] in the conflicts in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] as part of the equipment used by medical and surgical units in the field.

==Safety==
In both clinical and emergency-care situations, oxygen concentrators have the advantage of not being as dangerous as [[gas cylinder|oxygen cylinder]]s, which can, if ruptured or leaking, greatly increase the combustion rate of a fire. As such, oxygen concentrators are particularly advantageous in [[military]] or [[disaster]] situations, where oxygen tanks may be dangerous or infeasible. 

Oxygen concentrators are considered sufficiently foolproof to be leased to individual patients as a prescription item for use in their homes. Typically they are used as an adjunct to [[positive airway pressure|CPAP]] treatment of severe [[sleep apnea]]. There also are other medical uses for oxygen concentrators, including [[emphysema]] and other respiratory diseases.

Used and refurbished units should be purchased through a reputable dealer. Temperamental units are worthless to the medical community since an individual's health frequently relies on the constant extended operation of the unit. However, such units are valuable to metal and glasswork hobbyists. Because oxygen is a "permanent gas" (cannot be liquefied at any pressure at room temperature), it is expensive to obtain in bottled form. Medical oxygen concentrators or specialized industrial oxygen concentrators can be made to operate ''small'' [[oxyacetylene]] cutting and welding torches.<ref>[http://pyronamix.com/page6.html ]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>

==Industrial oxygen concentrators==
Industrial processes may use much higher pressures and flows than medical units. To meet that need, another process, called [[vacuum swing adsorption]] (VSA), has been developed by the [[Air Products & Chemicals|Air Products]] company. This process uses a single low pressure blower and a valve that reverses the flow through the blower so that the regeneration phase occurs under a vacuum. Generators using this process are being marketed to the [[aquaculture]] industry. Industrial oxygen concentrators are often available in a much wider range of capacities than medical concentrators. 

Industrial oxygen concentrators are sometimes referred to as oxygen ''generators'' within the oxygen and ozone industries to distinguish them from medical oxygen ''concentrators''. The distinction is used in an attempt to clarify that industrial oxygen concentrators are not approved [[medical device]]s by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and they are not suitable for use as bedside medical concentrators. However, applying the oxygen generator nomenclature can lead to confusion. The term, oxygen ''generator,'' is a misnomer in that the oxygen is not ''generated'' as it is with a [[chemical oxygen generator]], but rather it is concentrated from the air. 

The use of the oxygen generator terminology can also be a problem in shipping in the wake of the crash of [[ValuJet Flight 592]]. Non-medical oxygen concentrators can be used as a feed gas to a medical oxygen system, such as the oxygen system in a [[hospital]], though governmental approval is required, such as by the FDA, and additional filtering is generally required.
