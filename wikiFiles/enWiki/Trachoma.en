'''Trachoma''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: τράχωμα, ‘roughness’) is an infectious disease caused by the ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' bacterium which produces a characteristic [[Granulation tissue|roughening]] of the inner surface of the eyelids. Also called '''granular conjunctivitis''' and '''Egyptian ophthalmia''', it is the leading cause of infectious [[blindness]] in the world.<ref>[http://gnntdc.sabin.org/about-ntds/factsheets/trachoma The Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases (The Sabin Vaccine Institute) - Trachoma]</ref> Globally, about 40 million people have an active infection and as many as 8 million people are visually impaired as a result of this disease. It belongs to a group of diseases known as [[neglected tropical diseases]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The bacterium has an incubation period of 5 to 12 days, after which the affected individual experiences symptoms of [[conjunctivitis]], or irritation similar to "[[pink eye]]." Blinding endemic trachoma results from multiple episodes of reinfection that maintains the intense inflammation in the conjunctiva. Without reinfection, the inflammation will gradually subside.<ref name=taylor/>

The conjunctival inflammation is called “active trachoma” and usually is seen in children, especially pre-school children. It is characterized by white lumps in the undersurface of the upper eyelid (conjunctival follicles or lymphoid germinal centres) and by non-specific inflammation and thickening often associated with papillae. Follicles may also appear at the junction of the cornea and the sclera (limbal follicles). Active trachoma will often be irritating and have a watery discharge. Bacterial secondary infection may occur and cause a purulent discharge.

The later structural changes of trachoma are referred to as “cicatricial trachoma”. These include scarring in the eyelid (tarsal conjunctiva) that leads to distortion of the eyelid with buckling of the lid (tarsus) so the lashes rub on the eye (trichiasis). These lashes will lead to corneal opacities and scarring and then to blindness. Linear scar present in the [[Sulcus subtarsalis]] is called Arlt's line (named after [[Carl Ferdinand von Arlt]]). In addition, blood vessels and scar tissue can invade the upper cornea (pannus). Resolved limbal follicles may leave small gaps in pannus (Herbert’s Pits).

Most commonly children with active trachoma will not present with any symptoms as the low grade irritation and ocular discharge is just accepted as normal.  However, further symptoms may include:
*Eye [[mucopurulent discharge|discharge]]
*Swollen eyelids
*[[Trichiasis]] (turned-in eyelashes)
*Swelling of [[lymph nodes]] in front of the ears
*Sensitivity to bright lights
*Increased heart rate
*Further ear, nose and throat complications.
The major complication or the most important one is [[corneal ulcer]] occurring due to rubbing by concentrations, or trichiasis with superimposed bacterial infection.

== Cause ==
Trachoma is caused by ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' and it is spread by direct contact with eye, nose, and throat [[secretions]] from affected individuals, or contact with [[Fomite (term)|fomites]]<ref name=Cecil /> (inanimate objects that carry infectious agents), such as towels and/or washcloths, that have had similar contact with these secretions. Flies can also be a route of mechanical transmission.<ref name=Cecil>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Lee|title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1437727883|year=2011|pages=e326-2|edition=24th}}</ref> Untreated, repeated trachoma infections result in [[entropion]]&mdash;a painful form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward, causing the eyelashes to scratch the cornea. Children are the most susceptible to infection due to their tendency to easily get dirty, but the blinding effects or more severe symptoms are often not felt until adulthood.

Blinding endemic trachoma occurs in areas with poor personal and family hygiene. Many factors are indirectly linked to the presence of trachoma including lack of water, absence of latrines or toilets, poverty in general, flies, close proximity to cattle, crowding, and so forth.<ref name=taylor>{{cite book |author=Taylor, Hugh |title=Trachoma: A Blinding Scourge from the Bronze Age to the Twenty-first Century |publisher=Centre for Eye Research Australia |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-9757695-9-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wright HR, Turner A, Taylor HR |title=Trachoma |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9628 |pages=1945–54 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18539226 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60836-3 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(08)60836-3}}</ref>  However, the final common pathway seems to be the presence of dirty faces in children that facilitates the frequent exchange of infected ocular discharge from one child’s face to another.  Most transmission of trachoma occurs within the family.<ref name=taylor/>

==Diagnosis==

===McCallan's classification===
McCallan in 1908 divided the clinical course of trachoma into 4 stages
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage 1 (Incipient trachoma)
! Stage 2 (Established trachoma)
! Stage 3 (Cicatrising trachoma)
! Stage 4 (Healed trachoma)

|-
| Hyperaemia of palpebral conjunctiva
| Appearance of mature follicle & papillae
| Scarring of palpebral conjunctiva
| Disease is cured or is not markable
|-
| Immature follicle
| Progressive corneal pannus
| Scars are easily visible as white bands
| Sequelae to cicatrisation cause symptoms
|}

===WHO classification===
The World Health Organization recommends a simplified grading system for trachoma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thylefors B, Dawson CR, Jones BR, West SK, Taylor HR |title=A simple system for the assessment of trachoma and its complications |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=477–83 |year=1987 |pmid=3500800 |doi= |url= |pmc=2491032}}</ref> The Simplified WHO Grading System is summarized below:

Trachomatous inflammation, follicular (TF) – Five or more follicles of >0.5&nbsp;mm on the upper tarsal conjunctiva

Trachomatous inflammation, intense (TI) – Papillary hypertrophy and inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscuring more than half the deep tarsal vessels

Trachomatous scarring (TS) - Presence of scarring in tarsal conjunctiva.

Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) – At least one ingrown eyelash touching the globe, or evidence of epilation (eyelash removal)

Corneal opacity (CO) – Corneal opacity blurring part of the pupil margin

==Prevention==
Although trachoma was eliminated from much of the developed world in the last century, this disease persists in many parts of the developing world particularly in communities without adequate access to water and sanitation.

===Environmental measures===
Environmental improvement: Modifications in water use, fly control, latrine use, health education, and proximity to domesticated animals have all been proposed to reduce transmission of ''C. trachomatis''. These changes pose numerous challenges for implementation. It seems likely that these environmental changes ultimately impact on the transmission of ocular infection by means of lack of facial cleanliness.<ref name=taylor/> Particular attention is required for environmental factors that limit clean faces.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotic therapy: WHO Guidelines recommend that a region should receive community-based, mass antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of active trachoma among one to nine year-old children is greater than 10 percent.<ref>{{cite web | last = Solomon
 | first = AW

 | doi = 
 | accessdate = }}</ref> Subsequent annual treatment should be administered for three years, at which time the prevalence should be reassessed. Annual treatment should continue until the prevalence drops below five percent. At lower prevalences, antibiotic treatment should be family-based.

==Management==
===Antibiotics===
Antibiotic selection: Azithromycin (single oral dose of 20&nbsp;mg/kg) or topical tetracycline (one percent eye ointment twice a day for six weeks). Azithromycin is preferred because it is used as a single oral dose. Although it is expensive, it is generally used as part of the international donation program organized by Pfizer through the International Trachoma Initiative.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mariotti SP |title=New steps toward eliminating blinding trachoma |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=351 |issue=19 |pages=2004–7 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15525727 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe048205 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=15525727&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref> Azithromycin can be used in children from the age of six months and in pregnancy.<ref name=taylor/>

===Surgery===
Surgery: For individuals with trichiasis, a bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure is warranted to direct the lashes away from the globe.<ref>Reacher M, Foster A, Huber J. “Trichiasis Surgery for Trachoma. The Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation Procedure.” 1993; World Health Organization, Geneva: WHO/PBL/93.29.</ref> Early intervention is beneficial as the rate of recurrence is higher in more advanced disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Burton MJ, Kinteh F, Jallow O, ''et al.'' |title=A randomised controlled trial of azithromycin following surgery for trachomatous trichiasis in the Gambia |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=89 |issue=10|pages=1282–8 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16170117 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2004.062489 |url=http://bjo.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16170117 |pmc=1772881}}</ref>

===Lifestyle measures===
Facial cleanliness: Children with grossly visible nasal discharge, ocular discharge, or flies on their faces are at least twice as likely to have active trachoma as children with clean faces.<ref name=taylor/>
Intensive community-based health education programs to promote face-washing can significantly reduce the prevalence of active trachoma, especially intense trachoma (TI). If somebody is already infected washing one’s face is strongly encouraged, especially a child, in order to prevent re-infection.<ref>[http://mayoclinic.com/health/trachoma/DS00776/DSECTION=prevention Prevention-Trachoma] 18 July 2008-24 March 2009</ref>

National governments in collaboration with numerous non-profit organizations implement trachoma control programs using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy, which includes:

* Surgery to correct advanced stages of the disease;
* Antibiotics to treat active infection, using [[azithromycin]]
* Facial cleanliness to reduce disease transmission;
* Environmental change to increase access to clean water and improved sanitation.

==Prognosis==
If not treated properly with [[oral antibiotics]], the symptoms may escalate and cause blindness, which is the result of [[corneal ulcer|ulceration]] and consequent scarring of the [[cornea]].  [[Surgery]] may also be necessary to fix eyelid deformities.

Without intervention, trachoma keeps families shackled within a cycle of poverty, as the disease and its long-term effects are passed from one generation to the next.

==History==
The disease is one of the earliest known eye afflictions, having been identified in Egypt as early as 15 B.C.<ref name=taylor/>

Its presence was also recorded in ancient China and Mesopotamia. Trachoma became a problem as people moved into crowded settlements or towns where hygiene was poor. It became a particular problem in Europe in the 19th Century. After the Egyptian Campaign (1798–1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1798–1815), trachoma was rampant in the army barracks of Europe and spread to those living in towns as troops returned home. Stringent control measures were introduced and by the early 20th Century, trachoma was essentially controlled in Europe, although cases were reported up until the 1950s.<ref name=taylor/> Today, most victims of trachoma live in underdeveloped and poverty-stricken countries in [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Asia]].

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control says "No national or international surveillance [for trachoma] exists. Blindness due to trachoma has been eliminated from the United States. The last cases were found among Native American populations and in Appalachia, and those in the boxing, wrestling, and sawmill industries (prolonged exposure to combinations of sweat and sawdust often lead to the disease). In the late 19th century and early 20th century, trachoma was the main reason for an immigrant coming through Ellis Island to be deported."<ref name="YEW">Yew, Elizabeth, M.D., [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1805119/pdf/bullnyacadmed00114-0060.pdf "MEDICAL INSPECTION OF IMMIGRANTS AT ELLIS ISLAND, 1891-1924"], ''Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine'', Vol. 56, No. 5, June 1980, [[New York Academy of Medicine]].</ref><ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/trachoma_t.htm Disease Listing, Trachoma, Technical Information | CDC Bacterial, Mycotic Diseases<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>

In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed an act designating funds for the eradication of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Allen SK, Semba RD |title=The trachoma menace in the United States, 1897-1960 |journal=Surv Ophthalmol |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=500–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12431697 |doi= 10.1016/S0039-6257(02)00340-5|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039625702003405}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Leupp |first=Constance D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1914 |month=August |title=Removing The Blinding Curse Of The Mountains: How Dr. McMullen, Of The Public Health Service Is Organizing The War Against Trachoma In The Appalachians |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XLIV |issue=2 |pages=426–430 |id= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=zegeQtMn9JsC&pg=PA426 |accessdate=2009-08-04 |quote= }}</ref> Immigrants who attempted to enter the U.S. through [[Ellis Island]], New York had to be checked for trachoma.<ref name="YEW"/> During this time treatment for the disease was by topical application of copper sulfate.

Savona Ventura, University of Malta, 2003].</ref>

Although by the 1950s, trachoma had virtually disappeared from the industrialized world, thanks to improved sanitation and overall living conditions, it continues to plague the developing world. Epidemiological studies were also conducted in 1956-63 by the Trachoma Control Pilot Project in India under the [[Indian Council of Medical Research|Indian Council for Medical Research.]]<ref>Gupta, UC and Preobragenski, W (1964), Trachoma in India - Endemicity and Epidemiological study, [[Indian Journal of Ophthalmology]], Volume 12, issue 2, pages 39-49.</ref> This potentially blinding disease remains endemic in the poorest regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East and in some parts of Latin America and Australia. Currently, 8 million people are visually impaired as a result of trachoma, and 41 million suffer from active infection.

Of the 54 countries that WHO cited as still having blinding trachoma occurring, Australia is the only developed country. Australian Aboriginal people who live in remote communities with inadequate sanitation are still blinded by this infectious eye disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Hugh R.|title=Trachoma in Australia|journal=Medical Journal of Australia|year=2001|volume=175|pages=371–372|url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2001/175/7/trachoma-australia}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Global Strategy: 2020 INSight===

The [[International Coalition for Trachoma Control]] (ICTC) has produced a strategic plan that lays out the actions to take and the milestones to meet in order to achieve the global elimination of blinding trachoma by the year 2020. The plan is called [[2020 INSight]]

“We can make this disease history, and this document lays out a plan to do so,” said Dr. Paul Emerson, chair of the ICTC and director of The Carter Center’s Trachoma Control Program. “There is an urgent need for action to avoid additional suffering and unnecessary blindness for hundreds of thousands of people.”

The [[International Trachoma Initiative]] (ITI) coordinated the publication of 2020 INSight, which was produced with input from a diverse set of stakeholders. McKinsey & Company, the independent management consulting firm, conducted in-depth interviews with representatives of national governments, international partners, and funders and provided comprehensive analysis to shape this global strategic plan.

===The Global Atlas===

The Trachoma Atlas is an open-access resource on the geographical distribution of trachoma. It features maps that show the prevalence of trachoma. The maps are free to use and download.
