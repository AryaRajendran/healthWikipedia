The '''lacrimal sac'''  is the upper dilated end of the [[nasolacrimal duct]], and is lodged in a deep groove formed by the [[lacrimal bone]] and [[frontal process]] of the [[maxilla]].   It connects the [[lacrimal canaliculi]], which drain tears from the eye's surface, and the [[nasolacrimal duct]], which conveys this fluid into the nasal cavity.

This is mainly for high amounts of tears, in which the lacrimal sac pumps inward and outward driven by the [[orbicularis oculi|orbicularis]] muscle during blinking.

It is oval in form and measures from 12 to 15&nbsp;mm. in length; its upper end is closed and rounded; its lower is continued into the nasolacrimal duct.

Its superficial surface is covered by a fibrous expansion derived from the [[medial palpebral ligament]], and its deep surface is crossed by the lacrimal part of the [[Orbicularis oculi]], which is attached to the crest on the lacrimal bone.

Like the nasolacrimal duct, the sac is lined by [[stratified columnar epithelium]] with mucus-secreting [[goblet cells]], with surrounding connective tissue. The Lacrimal Sac also drains the eye of any debris, bacteria, dirt, etc.

The lacrimal sac can be pictured by ''dacrocystography'', which is injecting [[radiocontrast]] into it and performing [[X-ray imaging]] of it.
