The '''Rolando fracture''' is a [[Bone fracture|comminuted]] [[intra-articular]] [[fracture]] through the base of the first [[metacarpal]] bone (the bone located just [[proximal]] to the [[thumb]]). It was first described in 1910 by Silvio Rolando.<ref>Rolando S. Fracture de la base du premier metacarpien et principalement sur une variete` non encore e`crite. Presse Med 1910;33:303–4 [in French].</ref> This is a fracture consisting of 3 distinct fragments; it is typically T- or Y-shaped.

==Treatment==
There are several proposed methods of treatment. Interestingly the quality of reduction does not correlate with late symptoms and osteoarthritic changes. Despite this fact, the joint surface should be restored as close to its anatomical position as possible.
Some advocate fixation with Kirschner wires, or plate and screw constructions.
Another accepted treatment is an [[external fixator]] accompanied by the tension band wiring technique.<ref>Howard FM. Fractures of the basal joint of the thumb. Clin Orthop. Volume 220, pp. 46-51, July 1987.</ref>

Tension band wiring is a technique in which the bone fragments are transfixed by [[Kirschner wire]]s, which are then also used as an anchor for a loop of flexible wire. As the loop is tightened the bone fragments are compressed together.

==Prognosis==
The Rolando fracture is less common than the [[Bennett's fracture]], and is associated with a worse prognosis.
