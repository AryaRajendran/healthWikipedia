'''Intention tremor''', also known as cerebellar tremor, is a [[dyskinesia|dyskinetic]] disorder characterized by a broad, coarse, and low frequency (below 5&nbsp;Hz) [[tremor]].  The amplitude of an intention tremor increases as an extremity approaches the endpoint of deliberate and visually guided movement (hence the name intention tremor).  An intention tremor is usually perpendicular to the direction of movement.  When experiencing an intention tremor, one often overshoots or undershoots their target, a condition known as [[dysmetria]].<ref name=seeberger>[http://www.thecni.org/reviews/17-fall05-p31-seeberger.pdf] Seeberger, Lauren.

Depending on the location of cerebellar damage, these tremors can be either unilateral or bilateral.<ref name=seeberger />

A variety of causes have been discovered to date, including damage or degradation of the cerebellum due to [[neurodegenerative disease]]s, [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[tumor]], [[stroke]], or toxicity. There is currently no established pharmacological treatment, however, some success has been seen using treatments designed for [[essential tremor]]s.<ref name=seeberger /><ref name=review>{{cite journal |last1=Bhidayasiri |first1=R |title=Differential diagnosis of common tremor syndromes |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=81 |issue=962 |pages=756–62 |year=2005 |pmid=16344298 |pmc=1743400 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2005.032979}}</ref>

==Causes==
Intention tremors are common among individuals with [[multiple sclerosis]]. One common symptom of multiple sclerosis is [[ataxia]]. This is a lack of coordinated muscle movement is caused by cerebellar lesions characteristic of multiple sclerosis. The disease often destroys physical and cognitive function of individuals. Intention tremors can be a first sign of multiple sclerosis, since loss of deteriorated motor function and sensitivity are often one of the first symptoms of cerebellar lesions.<ref name=seeberger /><ref name="cerebellar dysfunction">{{cite journal |last1=Deuschl |first1=G. |last2=Wenzelburger |first2=R |last3=Löffler |first3=K |last4=Raethjen |first4=J |last5=Stolze |first5=H |title=Essential tremor and cerebellar dysfunction Clinical and kinematic analysis of intention tremor |journal=Brain |volume=123 |pages=1568–80 |year=2000 |pmid=10908187 |doi=10.1093/brain/123.8.1568}}</ref>

Intention tremors have a variety of other recorded causes as well. These include a variety of [[neurological]] disorders, such as [[stroke]], [[alcoholism]], [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Wilson's disease]], [[Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease]],  [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] and [[fragile X syndrome]], as well as [[brain tumor]]s, [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypoparathyroidism]], [[insulinoma]], normal aging, and [[traumatic brain injury]].<ref name=seeberger /><ref name=Health>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003192.htm] Hoch, Daniel MD. “Tremor.” Updated 6/15/2010.

have also been shown to cause intention tremor by negatively affecting the cerebellum, brainstem, or thalamus, as discussed in mechanisms.<ref name=Health />

==Mechanism==
[[File:Cerebellum NIH.png|thumb|alt=Cerebellum|The cerebellum is highlighted in purple]]
Intention tremors caused by normal, everyday activities, such as stress, anxiety, fear, anger, caffeine, and fatigue do not seem to result from damage to any part of the brain. These tremors instead seem to be a temporary worsening of a small tremor that is present in every human being. These tremors go away with time.<ref name=Health />

More permanent intention tremors are caused by damage to certain regions of the brain. The most common cause of intention tremors is damage to the [[cerebellum]]. The cerebellum is a part of the brain responsible for motor coordination, posture and balance. It is responsible for fine motor movements. When the cerebellum is damaged, a person has difficulty executing a fine motor movement, such as attempting to touch one's nose with one's finger. One of the most common ways for the cerebellum to become damaged is through the development of cerebellar [[lesion]]s.<ref name="Neuro Book">[http://www.sinauer.com/neuroscience4e/] Purves, Dale et al. ''Neuroscience''. Fourth Edition. 2008. Sinauer Associates, Inc.</ref> The most common site for cerebellar lesions that lead to intention tremors has been reported to be the [[superior cerebellar peduncle]], through which all fibers carrying information to the midbrain pass, and the [[dentate nucleus]], which is also responsible for linking the cerebellum to the rest of the brain.<ref name=review /> Alcohol abuse is one typical cause of this damage to the cerebellum. The alcohol abuse causes degeneration of the anterior [[cerebellar vermis|vermis]] of the cerebellum. This leads to an inability to process fine motor movements in the individual and the development of intention tremors. In Multiple Sclerosis, damage occurs due to [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]] and [[neuron]] death, which again produces cerebellar lesions and an inability for those neurons to transmit signals.<ref name="Neuro Book" /> Because of this tight association with damage to the cerebellum, intention tremors are often referred to as cerebellar tremors.<ref name=seeberger />

Intention tremors can also be caused as a result of damage to the [[brainstem]] or [[thalamus]]. Both of these structures are involved in the transmission of information between the cerebellum and the [[cerebral cortex]], as well as between the cerebellum and the [[spinal cord]], and then on to the [[motor neurons]]. When these become damaged, the relay system between the cerebellum and the [[muscle]] which it is trying to act upon is compromised, resulting in the development of a tremor.<ref name="Neuro Book" />

==Diagnosis==
A working diagnosis is made from a [[neurological examination]] and evaluation.  Parts of a complete examination include a physical examination, [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], patient history, and [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and [[accelerometer|accelerometric]] studies. A diagnosis of solely intention tremor can only be made if the tremor is of low frequency (below 5&nbsp;Hz) and without the presence of any resting tremors.<ref name=seeberger/> Electrophysiological studies can be useful in determining frequency of the tremor, and accelerometric studies quantify tremor amplitude. MRI is used to locate damage to and degradation of the cerebellum that may be causing the intention tremor. Focal lesions such as [[neoplasm]]s, [[tumor]]s, [[bleeding|hemorrhages]], [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]], or other damage may be causing dysfunction of the cerebellum and correspondingly the intention tremor.<ref name=chou>{{cite journal |last=Chou |first1=Kelvin L. |title=Diagnosis and management of the individual with tremor |pmid=15250610 |year=2004 |pages=135–8 |issue=5 |volume=87 |journal=Medicine and health, Rhode Island |url=http://med.brown.edu/neurology/articles/kc13504.pdf}}</ref>

Physical tests are an easy way to determine the severity of the intention tremor and impairment of physical activity.  Common tests that are used to assess intention tremor are the finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests. In a finger-to-nose test, a physician has the individual touch their nose with their finger while monitoring for irregularity in timing and control of the movement. An individual with intention tremors will have coarse side-to-side movements that increase in severity as the finger approaches the nose. Similarly, the heel-to-shin test evaluates intention tremors of the lower extremities. In such a test, the individual places their heel on the top of their opposite knee and is then instructed to slide their heel down their shin to their ankle while being monitored for coarse and irregular side-to-side movement as the heel approaches the ankle.
Important historical elements to the diagnosis of intention tremor are:
# age at onset
# mode of onset (sudden or gradual)
# anatomical affected sites
# rate of progression
# exacerbating and remitting factors
# alcohol abuse
# family history of tremor<ref>{{cite book |author=Walker, H.

# current medications<ref name="Tremor Review" />

Secondary symptoms commonly observed are [[dysarthria]] (a [[speech disorder]] characterized by poor articulation and slurred speech), [[nystagmus]] (rapid involuntary eye movement, especially rolling of the eyes), [[gait]] problems (abnormality in [[walking]]), and postural tremor or titubation (to-and-fro movements of the neck and trunk). A postural tremor may also accompany intention tremors.<ref name=seeberger /><ref name="Tremor Review" />

==Management==
[[File:Tiefe Hirnstimulation - Sonden RoeSchaedel ap.jpg|thumb|left|Tiefe Hirnstimulation - Deep Brain Stimulation]]
It is very difficult to treat an intention tremor. The tremor may disappear for a while after a treatment has been administered, and then return after some time. This situation must be addressed with a different type of treatment.  First, individuals will be asked if they use any of the drugs known to cause tremors. If so, they are asked to stop taking the medication and then evaluated after some time to determine if the medication was related to the onset of the tremor. If the tremor persists, treatment that follows may include drug therapy, lifestyle changes, and more invasive forms of treatment, such as surgery and thalamic [[deep brain stimulation]].<ref name=chou /> 

Intention tremors are notoriously known to be very difficult to treat with [[pharmacotherapy]] and [[drug]]s. Although there is no established pharmacological treatment for an intention tremor, several drugs have been found to have positive effects on intention tremors and are used as treatment by many health professionals. [[Isoniazid]], [[buspirone hydrochloride]], [[glutethimide]], [[carbamazepine]], [[clonazepam]], [[buspirone]], [[topiramate]], [[zofran]], [[propranolol]] and [[primidone]] have all seen moderate results in treating intention tremor and can be prescribed treatments. [[Isoniazid]] inhibits γ-aminobutyric [[acid]]-[[aminotransferase]], which the first step in enzymatic breakdown of [[GABA]], thus increasing GABA, the major inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]] in the central nervous system. This causes a reduction in cerebellar [[ataxia]]s. Another neurotransmitter targeted by drugs that has been found to alleviate intention tremors is [[serotonin]]. The agonist [[buspirone hydrochloride]], which decreases serotonin's function in the central nervous system, has been viewed as an effective treatment of intention tremors.<ref name=seeberger />

There are also alternative treatments available. [[Cannabis]] has offered as an effective treatment for individuals with tremors, but the inclination to find conclusive scientific data on such a treatment has not existed in the medical community.<ref name=cannabis>{{cite journal |last1=Zajicek |first1=John P. |last2=Apostu |first2=Vicentiu I. |title=Role of Cannabinoids in Multiple Sclerosis |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=187–201 |year=2011 |pmid=21323391 |doi=10.2165/11539000-000000000-00000}}</ref> Equally, it is pertinent to remember there has been no research conducted of any kind on the potential benefits of therapeutic [[Cannabis]] treatments, not merely a lack of positive research, something that may well be attributed to [[War on Drugs|political]] or [[The Rhetoric of Drugs|social]] constraints on the exploration of such a therapy. Also, [[physical therapy]] has had great results in reducing tremors, but usually does not cure the tremors. Relaxation techniques, such as [[meditation]], [[yoga]], [[hypnosis]], and [[biofeedback]], are other alternative treatments that have seen some results with tremors. Wearing wrist weights which will weigh down one's hands as they make movements, masking much of the tremor, is a proven home remedy. This is not a true treatment, since wearing the weights does not have any lasting effects when they are not on, however they do help the individual cope with the tremor immediately.<ref name="Tremor Review" />

A more radical treatment that is used in individuals who do not respond to drug therapy, physical therapy, or any other treatment listed above, with moderate to severe intention tremors, would be surgical intervention. [[Deep brain stimulation]] and surgical lesioning of the [[thalamic nuclei]] has been found to be an effective long-term treatment with intention tremors. Deep brain stimulation treats intention tremors but does not help related diseases or disorders such as dyssynergia and [[dysmetria]].<ref name="chronic DBS in MS">{{cite journal |last1=Wishart |first1=H A |title=Chronic deep brain stimulation for the treatment of tremor in multiple sclerosis: review and case reports |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=74 |pages=1392–7 |year=2003 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.74.10.1392}}</ref> Deep brain stimulation involves the implantation of a device called a [[brain pacemaker]], shown in the picture above. This medical device sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain, changing brain activity in a controlled manner. In the case of an intention tremor, the thalamic nuclei is the region of the brain targeted for treatment. This form of treatment causes reversible changes and does not cause any permanent lesions. Since it is reversible, deep brain stimulation is considered fairly safe, and reduction in tremor amplitude is almost guaranteed and sometimes it is even resolved. Some individuals with multiple sclerosis have seen sustained benefits in MS progress.<ref name="thalamic DBS in MS">{{cite journal |last1=Karbowniczek |first1=A |last2=Domitrz |first2=I |title=Thalamic deep brain stimulation for tremor among multiple sclerosis patients |journal=Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=11–17 |year=2011 |pmid=21384288}}</ref> [[Thalamotomy]] is another surgical treatment where lesions of the thalamus nucleus are created to disrupt the tremor circuit. Thalamotomy has been used to treat many different forms of tremors, including tremors that arise from trauma, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and those whose cause it unknown. This is a very invasive, high-risk treatment with many negative effects, such as multiple sclerosis worsening, cognitive dysfunction, worsening of [[dysarthria]], and [[dysphagia]]. Immediate positive effects are seen in individuals treated with a thalamotomy procedure. However, the tremor often comes back after some time, thus it is not a complete treatment. Thalamotomy is currently in clinical trials to determine the validity of the treatment of intention tremors with all its high risks.<ref name=seeberger /><ref name= "thalamic nucleus">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)91175-T |last1=Benabid |first1=AL |last2=Pollak |first2=P |last3=Gervason |first3=C |last4=Hoffmann |first4=D |last5=Gao |first5=DM |last6=Hommel |first6=M |last7=Perret |first7=JE |last8=De Rougemont |first8=J |title=Long-term suppression of tremor by chronic stimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus |journal=Lancet |volume=337 |issue=8738 |pages=403–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1671433}}</ref>

==Research directions==
Current research has focused on finding a pharmacological treatment that is specific for intention tremor. Currently, limited success has been seen in treating intention tremor with drugs effective at treating essential tremor.<ref name="Tremor Review" />  Clinical trials of [[levetiracetam]], typically used to treat [[epilepsy]], and [[pramipexole]], used to treat resting tremor, have recently been completed to establish their effectiveness in treating kinetic tremor.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00430599|The Effect of Levetiracetam (Keppra) on the Treatment of Tremor in Multiple Sclerosis}}</ref><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01100073|Kinetic Tremor in Parkinson's Disease: Its Course Under Pramipexole (Mirapexin®) Treatment and Impact on Quality of Life}}</ref> A clinical trial for [[riluzole]], typically used to treat [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], is currently underway at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] to evaluate its effectiveness of treating cerebellar [[ataxia]] and kinetic tremor.<ref name= riluzole>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01104649|Efficacy of Riluzole in Hereditary Cerebellar Ataxia}}</ref>

==History==
In 1868, French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] first characterized the distinction between MS, with its resulting intention tremor, and the  resting tremor characteristic of [[Parkinson's disease]].  Intention tremor became known as part of [[Charcot triad|Charcot's triad]] which, along with nystagmus and scanning speech, act as strong indications of MS.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1258/jrsm.98.6.289 |first1=Richard W |last1=Orrell |year=2005 |title=Multiple Sclerosis: The History of a Disease |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=289 |pmc=1142241}}</ref>
