==Mechanism of action==
Silver and most silver compounds have an [[oligodynamic effect]] and are toxic for bacteria, algae, and fungi ''[[in vitro]]''. Among the elements that have this effect, silver is the least toxic for humans. The antibacterial action of silver is dependent on the silver ion.<ref name="Lansdown2006"/> The effectiveness of silver compounds as an antiseptic is based on the ability of the biologically active silver ion ({{chem|Ag|+}}) to irreversibly damage key enzyme systems in the cell membranes of pathogens.<ref name="Lansdown2006"/> The antibacterial action of silver has long been known to be enhanced by the presence of an [[electric field]]. Applying an electric current across silver electrodes enhances antibiotic action at the anode, likely due to the release of silver into the bacterial culture.<ref>J. A. Spadaro, T. J. Berger, S. D.

In August 1999, the U.S. FDA banned colloidal silver sellers from claiming any therapeutic or preventive value for the product,<ref name="fda-rule"/> although silver-containing products continue to be promoted as [[dietary supplement]]s in the U.S. under the looser regulatory standards applied to supplements.<ref name="fda-rule"/> The FDA has issued numerous [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]]s to Internet sites that have continued to promote colloidal silver as an antibiotic or for other medical purposes.<ref name="fda-warn1">{{cite web |url= http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm127976.htm|title= Colloidal Silver Not Approved|accessdate=2008-09-22 |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|date=2007-02-12}}</ref><ref name="fda-warn2">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/cyber/2001/Cyber097.pdf|title=FDA Warning Letter|accessdate=2008-09-22|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|date=2001-03-13}}</ref><ref name="fda-warn3">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm253264.htm|title=FDA Warning Letter|accessdate=2013-04-11|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|year=2011}}</ref>Despite the efforts of the FDA, silver products remain widely available on the market today.

In 2002, the [[Australian]] [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA) found there were no legitimate medical uses for colloidal silver and no evidence to support its marketing claims.<ref name="Australia">{{cite web|url=http://www.tga.gov.au/industry/cm-colloidal-silver.htm|title= Regulation of colloidal silver and related products|publisher= Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]|accessdate=2008-09-22|date=2005-11-09}}</ref></blockquote> The U.S. [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM) warns that marketing claims about colloidal silver are scientifically unsupported, that the silver content of marketed supplements varies widely, and that colloidal silver products can have serious side effects such as [[argyria]].<ref name=nccam/>
In 2009, the USFDA issued a "Consumer Advisory" warning about the potential adverse effects of colloidal silver, and said that "...there are no legally marketed prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs containing silver that are taken by mouth."<ref>FDA Consumer Advisory.  2009.

The National Health Services in the UK spent about 25 million pounds on silver-containing dressing in 2006.  Silver-containing dressings represent about 14% of the total dressings used and about 25% of the overall wound dressing costs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Silver dressings--do they work?|pmid=20392779|year=2010|volume=48|issue=4|pages=38–42|doi=10.1136/dtb.2010.02.0014|journal=Drug and therapeutics bulletin}}</ref>
