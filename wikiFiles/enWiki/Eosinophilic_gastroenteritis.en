'''Eosinophilic gastroenteritis''' (EG) is a rare and heterogeneous condition characterized by patchy or diffuse [[eosinophilic]] infiltration of [[gastrointestinal]] (GI) tissue, first described by Kaijser in 1937

== Pathophysiology ==
Peripheral blood [[eosinophilia]] and elevated [[Blood serum|serum]] [[IgE]] are usual but not universal. The damage to the [[gastrointestinal tract]] wall is caused by eosinophilic [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltration]] and [[degranulation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tan A, Kruimel J, Naber T |title=Eosinophilic gastroenteritis treated with non-enteric-coated budesonide tablets |journal=European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=425–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11338074 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200104000-00021}}</ref> 

As a part of [[Immune system|host defense]] mechanism, [[eosinophils]] are normally present in gastrointestinal [[mucosa]], though the finding in deeper [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] is almost always [[pathologic]]
.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blackshaw A, Levison D |title=Eosinophilic infiltrates of the gastrointestinal tract |journal=J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1986 |pmid=2869055 |doi=10.1136/jcp.39.1.1 |pmc=499605}}</ref> 
What triggers such dense infiltration in EG is not clear. It is possible that different [[pathogenesis|pathogenetic]] mechanisms of disease is involved in several subgroups of patients. Food [[allergy]] and variable [[IgE]] response to food substances has been observed in some patients which implies role of [[Hypersensitivity|hypersensitive]] response in pathogenesis. Many patients indeed have history of other [[atopy|atopic]] conditions like [[eczema]], [[asthma]] etc.

Eosinophil recruitment into inflammatory tissue is a complex process, regulated by a number of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[cytokines]]. In EG [[cytokines]] [[Interleukin 3|IL-3]], [[Interleukin 5|IL-5]] and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ([[GM-CSF]]) may be behind the recruitement and activation. They have been observed [[immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] in diseased intestinal wall

In addition [[eotaxin]]{{disambiguation needed|date=January 2012}} has been shown to have an integral role in regulating the [[homing (biology)|homing]] of eosinophils into the [[lamina propria]] of stomach and small intestine

In the allergic subtype of disease, it is thought that food [[allergens]] cross the intestinal mucosa and trigger an inflammatory response that includes [[mast cell]] degranulation and recruitment of eosinophils.<ref name="Mishra" />

== Symptoms and signs ==
EG typically presents with a combination of chronic nonspecific GI symptoms which include [[abdominal]] pain, [[nausea]], vomiting, [[diarrhea]], [[weight loss]], and abdominal distension. Approximately 80% have symptoms for several years;<ref name="Christopher V, Thompson M, Hughes S 2002 498–9"/> a high degree of clinical suspicion is often required to establish the diagnosis, as the disease is extremely rare. It doesn't come all of a sudden but takes about 3-4 years to develop depending upon the age of the patient. Occasionally, the disease may manifest itself as an acute abdomen or bowel obstruction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shweiki E, West J, Klena J, Kelley S, Colley A, Bross R, Tyler W |title=Eosinophilic gastroenteritis presenting as an obstructing cecal mass--a case report and review of the literature |journal=Am.

Failure to thrive and [[anaemia]] may also be present. [[Lower gastrointestinal bleeding]] may imply colonic involvement.
*'''Muscular EG''' (13-70%) present with obstruction of [[gastric outlet]] or small intestine; sometimes as an obstructing [[Cecum|caecal]] mass or [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]].

#the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms,
#[[histology|histological]] demonstration of eosinophilic infiltration in one or more areas of the gastrointestinal tract or presence of high eosinophil count in [[ascitic]] fluid (latter usually indicates subserosal variety),
#no evidence of parasitic or extraintestinal disease.

[[Hypereosinophilia]], the hallmark of allergic response, may be absent in up to 20% of patients, but [[hypoalbuminaemia]] and other abnormalities suggestive of malabsorption may be present.

[[CT scan]] may show nodular and irregular thickening of the folds in the distal stomach and proximal small bowel, but these findings can also be present in other conditions like [[Crohn's disease]] and [[lymphoma]].

The [[endoscopic]] appearance in eosinophilic gastroenteritis is nonspecific; it includes erythematous, friable, nodular, and occasional ulcerative changes.<ref name="chen">{{cite journal |author=Chen M, Chu C, Lin S, Shih S, Wang T |title=Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: clinical experience with 15 patients |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=9 |issue=12 |pages=2813–6 |year=2003 |pmid=14669340}}</ref> 
Sometimes diffuse inflammation results in complete loss of [[Intestinal villus|villi]], involvement of multiple layers, [[submucosa]]l [[oedema]] and [[fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnstone J, Morson B |title=Eosinophilic gastroenteritis |journal=Histopathology |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=335–48 |year=1978 |pmid=363591 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2559.1978.tb01726.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Katz A, Goldman H, Grand R |title=Gastric mucosal biopsy in eosinophilic (allergic) gastroenteritis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=73 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=705–9 |year=1977 |pmid=892374}}</ref>

Definitive diagnosis involves [[histology|histological]] evidence of eosinophilic infiltration in biopsy slides. [[Microscopy]] reveals >20 eosinophils per [[High Power Field|high power field]].<ref name="baig"/><ref name="talley"/> Infiltration is often patchy, can be missed and [[laparoscopy|laparoscopic]] full thickness biopsy may be required.

[[Radionuclide|Radio isotope]] scan using [[Technetium (99mTc) exametazime|technetium (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) exametazime]]-labeled [[leukocyte]] [[single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] may be useful in assessing the extent of disease and response to treatment but has little value in diagnosis, as the scan does not help differentiating EG from other causes of inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee K, Hahm K, Kim Y, Kim J, Cho S, Jie H, Park C, Yim H |title=The usefulness of Tc-99m HMPAO labeled WBC SPECT in eosinophilic gastroenteritis |journal=Clinical nuclear medicine |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=536–41 |year=1997 |pmid=9262899 |doi=10.1097/00003072-199708000-00005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Imai E, Kaminaga T, Kawasugi K, Yokokawa T, Furui S |title=The usefulness of 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime white blood cell scintigraphy in a patient with eosinophilic gastroenteritis |journal=Annals of nuclear medicine |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=601–3 |year=2003 |pmid=14651361 |doi=10.1007/BF03006675}}</ref>

When eosinophilic gastroenteritis is observed in association with eosinophilic infiltration of other organ systems, the diagnosis of [[idiopathic]] [[hypereosinophilic syndrome]] should be considered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Matsushita M, Hajiro K, Morita Y, Takakuwa H, Suzaki T |title=Eosinophilic gastroenteritis involving the entire digestive tract |journal=Am.

== Management ==
Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy with a 90% response rate in some studies. Appropriate duration of steroid treatment is unknown and relapse often necessitates long term treatment. Various steroid sparing agents e.g. [[sodium cromoglycate]] (a stabilizer of mast cell [[cell membrane|membranes]]), [[ketotifen]] (an [[antihistamine]]), and [[montelukast]] (a selective, competitive [[Leukotriene antagonist|leukotriene receptor antagonist]]) have been proposed, centering around an allergic hypothesis, with mixed results.<ref name="Perez-Millan" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Barbie D, Mangi A, Lauwers G |title=Eosinophilic gastroenteritis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus |journal=J.

== Epidemiology ==
Epidemiology may differ between studies, as number of cases are small, with approximately 300 EG cases reported in published literature.

EG can present at any age and across all races, with a slightly higher incidence in males.<ref>{{cite book | last = Guandalini | first = Stefano | title = Essential Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | location = City | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-07-141630-7 }} Page 210.</ref> Earlier studies showed higher incidence in the third to fifth decades of life.<ref name="Zur"/><ref name="klein"/>
