'''Musical ear syndrome''' ('''MES''') describes a condition seen in people who have [[hearing loss]] and subsequently develop [[auditory hallucinations]]. "MES" has also been associated with [[musical hallucinations]], which is a complex form of auditory hallucinations where an individual may experience music or sounds that are heard without an external source.<ref name="Bhatt 2012">{{cite journal |last=Bhatt |first=Y.M. |coauthors=de Carpentier, J.P |title=Musical Hallucination Following Whiplash Injury: Case Report and Literature Review |journal=Journal of Laryngology and Otology |year=2012 |month=June |volume=126 |issue=6 |pages=615–18 |doi=10.1017/S0022215112000242}}</ref> It is comparable to [[Charles Bonnet syndrome]] (visual hallucinations in visually impaired people)<ref>Berrios GE and Brook P (1982) The Charles Bonnet Syndrome and the Problems of Visual Perceptual Disorder in the Elderly.

== History ==
Musical hallucinations and MES have only become widely recognizable in the last few decades of research, but there are indications throughout history that have described symptoms of musical hallucinations. The Romantic composer [[Robert Schumann]] was said to have heard entire symphonies in his head from which he drew as inspiration for his music, but later in his life this phenomenon had diminished to just an A note that played ceaselessly within his head.<ref name="Sacks 2008">{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |title=Musicophelia: Tales of Music and the Brain |year=2008 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York}}</ref> An alternative explanation is that his symptoms were caused by [[syphilis]] or [[mercury poisoning]] used for its treatment. The Russian composer [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] was also recorded as experiencing music hallucinations after some shrapnel was removed from his skull.<ref name="Sacks 2008"/>

== Populations ==
The occurrence of MES has been suggested to be very high among the hearing impaired through '''acquired deafness''' or the ear condition known as [[tinnitus]].<ref name=pmid16608788>{{cite journal |author=Goycoolea M, Mena I, Neubauer S |title=Spontaneous musical auditory perceptions in patients who develop abrupt bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. An uninhibition syndrome? |journal=Acta Otolaryngol |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=368–74 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16608788 |doi=10.1080/00016480500416942 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00016480500416942}}</ref> Though exact causation is uncertain, it has been theorized that the "release phenomenon" is taken into affect. The "release phenomenon" says that individuals with acquired deafness may experience musical hallucinations because the lack of stimulation, which can give room for the brain to interpret internal sounds as being external.<ref name="Aziz 2011">{{cite journal |last=Aziz |first=V.M. |coauthors=Asaad, M. |title=Musical Hallucination in Acquired and Pre-Lingual  Deafness |journal=International Psychogeriatric |year=2011 |month=August |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=1015–17 |doi=10.1017/S104160211000809}}</ref> 

Sufferers typically hear music or singing and the condition is more common in women.{{cn|date=December 2012}} The hallucinatory experiences differ in [[phenomenology (science)|phenomenology]] from that commonly experienced in [[psychotic disorders]] although there may be some overlap. The most important distinction is the realization that the hallucinations are not real. [[Delusion|Delusional beliefs]] associated with the hallucinations may occur, but some degree of insight should be preserved. There should not be any other psychotic symptoms present, especially hallucinations in other modalities. There should be an absence of serious mental illness, although mild cognitive impairment is often associated with MES.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

== Causes ==
It is postulated that by the "[[release phenomenon]]" MES is caused by hypersensitivity in the auditory cortex caused by sensory deprivation, secondary to their hearing loss.<ref name=pmid16608788/> This "hole" in the hearing range is "plugged" by the brain confabulating a piece of information – in this case a piece of music. A similar occurrence is seen with strokes of the visual cortex where a visual field defect occurs and the brain confabulates a piece of visual data to fill the spot. This is described by sufferers as an image in the visual field which is patently nonsensical.

The hallucinations are usually not unpleasant but may cause irritation due to their persistent nature. It is common for sufferers to have a history of [[tinnitus]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Musical hallucinations. A historical and clinical study |author=Berrios GE |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |year=1990 |month=Feb |volume=156 |pages=188–94 |pmid=2180526}}</ref> The condition may be associated with early stages of [[dementia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Investigations such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] or [[CT scanning]] and [[electroencephalogram]]s (EEGs) may be worthwhile, but will rarely show any serious pathology. It is believed that because this kind of phenomenon is usually heterogenous in causation, a wide variety of factors need to be considered, which could give possible explanation for why MES is seen as under diagnosed.<ref name="Zilles 2012">{{cite journal |last=Zilles |first=D. |coauthors=Zerr, I.; Wedekind, D. |title=Successful Treatment of Musical  Hallucinations with the Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Donepezil |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |year=2012 |month=June |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=422–24 |doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e318253a086}}</ref> Some of these factors may include significant trauma to the head or any side-effects from substances such as [[antidepressants]], [[marijuana]], [[alcohol]], [[procaine]], or [[general anesthesia]].<ref name="Kanemura 2010">{{cite journal |last=Kanemura |first=S. |coauthors=Tanimukai, H.; Tsuneto, S. |title=Can 'Steroid Switching' Improve Steroid-Induced Musical Hallucinations in a Patient with Terminal Cancer? |journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine |year=2010 |month=December |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1495–98 |doi=10.1089/jpm.2010.9751}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Given the unknown nature of MES, treatments have been largely dependent on an individual basis. Treatments can vary from being as little as self-reassurance to pharmaceutical medications.<ref name="Bhatt 2012"/>

Medications can be helpful, such as [[antipsychotics]], [[benzodiazepines]] or [[antiepileptics]], but there is very limited evidence for this. Some case studies have found that switching to a [[prednisolone]] steroid after a [[betamethasone]] steroid which caused MES helped alleviate hallucinations or the use of the [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]], [[Donepezil]], have also found that it successfully treated an individual's MES.<ref name="Zilles 2012"/><ref name="Kanemura 2010"/> However, because of the heterogeneous etiology, these methods cannot be applied as general treatment, but should be considered<ref name="Zilles 2012"/>

Other than treatment by medicinal means, individuals have also successfully alleviated musical hallucinations by cochlear implants, listening to different songs via an external source, or by attempting to block them through mental effort, depending on how severe their condition is<ref name="Sacks 2008"/>
