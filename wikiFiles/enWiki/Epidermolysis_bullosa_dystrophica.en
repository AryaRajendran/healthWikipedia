'''Epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica''' or '''Dystrophic EB''' (DEB) is an inherited disease affecting the skin and other organs. "Butterfly children" is the term given to those born with the disease, as their skin is seen to be as delicate and fragile as that of a butterfly.

==Causes==
DEB is caused by genetic defects (or [[mutation]]s) within the [[Collagen, type VII, alpha 1|human COL7A1 gene]] encoding the [[protein]] type VII collagen (collagen VII).<ref name="pmid16971478">{{cite journal |author=Varki R, Sadowski S, Uitto J, Pfendner E |title=Epidermolysis bullosa.

Collagen VII is a very large molecule (780&nbsp;nm) that dimerizes to form a semicircular looping structure: the anchoring fibril. Anchoring fibrils are thought to form a structural link between the epidermal [[basement membrane]] and the fibrillar [[collagen]]s in the upper [[dermis]].

==Presentation and prognosis==
The deficiency in anchoring fibrils impairs the adherence between the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the underlying dermis. The skin of DEB patients is thus highly susceptible to severe [[blister]]ing.

Collagen VII is also associated with the [[epithelium]] of the [[Esophagus|esophageal lining]], and DEB patients may suffer from chronic scarring, webbing, and obstruction of the [[esophagus]]. Affected individuals are often severely malnourished due to trauma to the oral and esophageal mucosa and require feeding tubes for nutrition. They also suffer from iron-deficiency anemia of uncertain origin, which leads to chronic fatigue.  

Open wounds on the skin heal slowly or not at all, often scarring extensively, and are particularly susceptible to infection.  Many individuals bathe in a bleach and water mixture to fight off these infections.

The chronic inflammation leads to errors in the DNA of the affected skin cells, which in turn causes [[squamous cell carcinoma]] (SCC).  The majority of these patients die before the age of 30, either of SCC or complications related to DEB.

==Related conditions==
In the absence of mutations of the [[Collagen, type VII, alpha 1|COL7A1 gene]], an [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] response against type VII collagen can result in an acquired form of epidermolysis bullosa called epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Mihai S, Sitaru C |title=Immunopathology and molecular diagnosis of autoimmune bullous diseases |journal=J.

There exist other types of inherited [[epidermolysis bullosa]], junctional epidermolysis bullosa and epidermolysis bullosa simplex, which are not related to type VII collagen deficiency. These arise from mutations in the genes encoding other proteins of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] or the [[basement membrane]] at the junction between the epidermis and the [[dermis]].<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Fine JD, Eady RA, Bauer EA, ''et al.'' |title=Report of the Third International Consensus Meeting on Diagnosis and Classification of EB |journal=J.
