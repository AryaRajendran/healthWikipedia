As a [[medical term]], '''precocious puberty''' describes [[puberty]] occurring at an unusually early age. In most of these children, the process is normal in every respect except the unusually early age, and simply represents a [[human variability|variation]] of [[Human development (biology)|normal development]]. In a minority of children, the early development is triggered by a disease such as a [[tumor]] or [[brain injury|injury]] of the [[Human brain|brain]]. Even in instances where there is no disease, unusually early puberty can have adverse effects on social behavior and psychological development, can reduce adult [[human height|height]] potential, and may shift some lifelong health risks. Central precocious puberty can be treated by suppressing the [[pituitary]] [[hormone]]s that induce [[sex steroid]] production.

The term is used with several slightly different meanings that are usually apparent from the context. In its broadest sense, and often simplified as '''early puberty''', "precocious puberty" sometimes refers to any physical [[sex steroid|sex hormone]] effect, due to any cause, occurring earlier than the usual age, especially when it is being considered as a medical problem. Stricter definitions of "precocity" may refer only to central puberty starting before a statistically specified age based on percentile in the population (e.g., 2.5 standard deviations below the population mean),<ref name="MeshName|precocious+puberty">{{MeshName|precocious+puberty}}</ref> on expert recommendations of ages at which there is more than a negligible chance of discovering an abnormal cause, or based on opinion as to the age at which early puberty may have adverse effects. A common definition for medical purposes is onset before 8 years in girls or 9 years in boys.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{DorlandsDict|nine/000956207|precocious puberty}}</ref>

== Types and causes ==
'''Pubertas praecox''' is the [[Latin]] term used by physicians in the 19th century. Early [[pubic hair]], [[breast]], or [[genital]] development may result from natural early maturation or from several other conditions.

=== Central ===
If the cause can be traced to the [[hypothalamus]] or [[pituitary]], the cause is considered central.

Causes can include:
* damage to the inhibitory system of the brain (due to [[infection]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or [[irradiation]])
* [[Tuber cinereum hamartoma|hypothalamic hamartoma]] produces pulsatile [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH)
* [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]]
* [[McCune-Albright syndrome]]

Central precocious puberty can be caused by intracranial neoplasm, infection, trauma, hydrocephalus, and [[Angelman syndrome]].<ref>{{cite pmid|15349080}}</ref> Bones can be considered older in individuals with early puberty. Early puberty is marked by growth hormone problems resulting from various brain disorders. Precocious puberty can make a child able to conceive when very young; the youngest mother on record is [[Lina Medina]], who gave birth at the age of 5 years, 7 months and 21 days.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893791,00.html | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | title=Little Mother | date=1957-12-16 | accessdate=2008-01-09 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iJ7D1EHq |archivedate=2009-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = [[Snopes.com]] |url = http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/medina.asp |date = 21 Jul 2004 |title=Youngest Mother |accessdate=January 16, 2009}}</ref>

"Central precocious puberty (CPP) was reported in some patients with suprasellar [[arachnoid cysts]] (SAC), and SCFE ([[slipped capital femoral epiphysis]]) occurs in patients with CPP because of rapid growth and changes of growth hormone secretion."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yamato|first=Fumiko|coauthors=Takaya, Junji; Higashino, Hirohiko; Yamanouchi, Yasuo; Suehara, Hiroshi; Kobayashi, Yohnosuke|title=Slipped capital femoral epiphysis during the treatment of precocious puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonist: aetiological considerations|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|year=2005|month=March|volume=164|issue=3|pages=173–174|doi=10.1007/s00431-004-1578-7|pmid=15592875|accessdate=10 November 2012}}</ref>

If no cause can be identified, it is considered [[idiopathic]] or constitutional.

=== Peripheral ===
Secondary sexual development induced by [[sex steroid]]s from other abnormal sources is referred to as ''peripheral precocious puberty'' or ''precocious pseudopuberty.'' It typically presents as a severe form of disease with children. Symptoms are usually as a sequelae from adrenal insufficiency (because of 21-hydroxylase deficiency or 17 hydroxylase deficiency, the former being more common), which includes but is not limited to: hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, ambiguous genitalia in females, signs of virilization in females. Blood tests will typically reveal high level of [[androgen]]s with low levels of cortisol.

Causes can include:
* Endogenous sources
** [[gonad]]al tumors (such as [[arrhenoblastoma]])
** [[adrenal]] tumors
** [[germ cell tumor]]<ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1440-1754.1993.tb03022.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|15339200}})</ref>
** [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]
** McCune–Albright syndrome
* Exogenous hormones
** [[Environmental exogenous hormones]]
** As treatment for another condition

=== Isosexual and heterosexual ===
Generally, patients with precocious puberty develop [[phenotype|phenotypically]]-appropriate [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s. This is called ''isosexual'' precocity. However, sometimes a patient may develop in the opposite direction. For example, a male may develop breasts and other feminine characteristics, while a female on the other hand may develop a deepened voice and facial hair. This is called ''heterosexual'' precocity. It is very rare in comparison to isosexual precocity, and is usually the result of only unusual circumstances. As an example, children with an incredibly rare genetic condition called [[familial hyperestrogenism]] in which exceptionally high circulating levels of estrogen are present usually develop precocious puberty. Both males and females are hyperfeminized by the syndrome, and hence, the precocity would be classified as ''heterosexual'' in the case of males.

=== Research ===
Many causes of early puberty are somewhat unclear, though girls who have a high-fat diet and are not physically active or are [[Obesity|obese]] are more likely to physically mature earlier.<ref name="Tanner">(Tanner, 1990).</ref><ref name="ncbi">{{cite pmid|11483799}}</ref><ref name="newscientist.com">{{cite web|first=Phil|last=McKenna|title=Childhood obesity brings early puberty for girls|publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''|date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2010-05-22|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11307-childhood-obesity-brings-early-puberty-for-girls.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080419072722/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11307-childhood-obesity-brings-early-puberty-for-girls.html |archivedate = 2008-04-19}}</ref> "Obese girls, defined as at least 10 kilograms (22 pounds) overweight, had an 80% chance of developing breasts before their ninth birthday and starting menstruation before age 12 – the western average for menstruation is about 12.7 years."<ref name=newscientist.com/> Exposure to chemicals that mimic [[estrogen]] (known as [[xenoestrogens]]) is a possible cause of early puberty in girls.

High levels of beta-hCG in serum and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] observed in a 9-year-old boy suggest a pineal gland tumor. The tumor is called a ''chorionic [[gonadotropin]] secreting [[pineal]] tumor''. Radiography and chemotherapy reduced tumor and beta-hCG levels normalized.<ref>{{cite pmid|16767969}}</ref>

In a study using neonatal melatonin on rats, results suggest that elevated melatonin could be responsible for some cases of early puberty.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/0022-4731(87)90194-4}}</ref>

Familial cases of idiopathic central precocious puberty (ICPP) have been reported, leading researchers to believe there are specific genetic modulators of ICPP. Mutations in genes such as [[LIN28]],<ref>Park, S.W., et al., LIN28B polymorphisms are associated with central precocious puberty and early puberty in girls. Korean J Pediatr, 2012. 55(10): p. 388-92.</ref><ref>Ong, K.K., et al., Genetic variation in LIN28B is associated with the timing of puberty.

Pediatr Res, 2012. 71(4 Pt 1): p. 361-7.</ref> have been associated with precocious puberty. The association between LIN28 and puberty timing was validated experimentally in vivo, when it was found that mice with ectopic overexpression of [[LIN28]] show an extended period of pre-pubertal growth and a significant delay in puberty onset.<ref name="pmid    20512147">{{cite journal | author = Zhu H, Shah S, Shyh-Chang N, Shinoda G, Einhorn WS, Viswanathan SR, Takeuchi A, Grasemann C, Rinn JL, Lopez MF, Hirschhorn JN, Palmert MR, Daley GQ. | title = Lin28a transgenic mice manifest size and puberty phenotypes identified in human genetic association studies. | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 626–30 | year = 2010 | month = July | pmid = 20512147 | doi = 10.1038/ng.593 }}</ref> 

Mutations in the kisspeptin (KISS1) and its receptor, KISS1R (also known as GPR54), involved in GnRH secretion and puberty onset, are also thought to be the cause for ICPP <ref>eles, M.G., et al., New genetic factors implicated in human GnRH-dependent precocious puberty: the role of kisspeptin system.

== Clinical and social significance ==
Medical evaluation is sometimes necessary to recognize the few children with serious conditions from the majority who have entered puberty early but are still medically normal. Early sexual development warrants evaluation because it may:
#induce early [[bone maturation]] and reduce eventual adult height;
#indicate the presence of a tumor or other serious problem;
#cause the child, particularly a girl, to become an object of adult sexual interest.<ref name=newscientist.com/><ref name="www.redorbit.com">{{cite news|title=Early-Onset Puberty Puts Girls at Risk of Medical Problems|publisher=redorbit.com|date=2007-09-17|accessdate=2009-12-15|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1067387/earlyonset_puberty_puts_girls_at_risk_of_medical_problems/index.html}}</ref><ref name="Stattin & Magnussion">(Stattin & Magnussion, 1990).</ref><ref name="Caspi">(Caspi et al.1993: Lanza and Collins, 2002)</ref>

=== Diagnostic criteria ===

Studies indicate that breast development in girls and the appearance of pubic hair in girls and boys are starting earlier than in previous generations.<ref name=ncbi/><ref name="adc.bmj.com">{{cite doi|10.1136/adc.2004.057612}}</ref><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Roberts |title=Why puberty now begins at seven|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-05-15|accessdate=2010-05-22|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4530743.stm}}</ref><ref name="The Virginian-Pilot">{{cite news|first=Elizabeth|last=Simpson|title=PUBERTY HITTING GIRLS EARLIER, DOCTORS SAY STUDY REVEALS GIRLS DEVELOPING AT 8 OR 9 RATHER THAN 10 OR 11.|publisher=The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, VA)|date=2001-02-08|accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref><ref name="www.suntimes.com">{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Ritter|title=Parents worried by girls' earlier start of puberty|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|date=2000-08-02|accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref>  As a result, "early puberty" in children, particularly girls, as young as 9 and 10 is no longer considered abnormal, although it may be upsetting to parents<ref name=www.msnbc.msn.com/><ref name=www.suntimes.com/> and can be harmful to children who mature physically at a time when they are immature mentally.<ref name="www.center4research.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.center4research.org/2010/04/girls-to-women/|title=Early Puberty in Girls|author=Diana Zuckerman Ph.D. |publisher=Cornell University Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors |year=2001 |work=The Ribbon |accessdate=14 January 2010 }}</ref>

No age reliably separates normal from abnormal processes in children, but the following age thresholds for evaluation are thought to minimize the risk of missing a significant medical problem:
*Breast development in boys before appearance of pubic hair or [[testicle|testicular]] enlargement.;
*[[Pubic hair]] or genital enlargement ([[gonadarche]]) in boys with onset before 9.5 years;
*Pubic hair ([[pubarche]]) before 8 or breast development ([[thelarche]]) in girls with onset before 7 years;
*[[Menstruation]] ([[menarche]]) in girls before 10 years.

== Treatment ==
One possible treatment is with [[anastrozole]]. [[Histrelin]] acetate (Supprelin LA), Triptorelin or [[Leuprolide]], any GnRH agonists, may also be used. Non-continuous usage of GnRH agonists stimulates the pituitary gland to release [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone]] (FSH) and [[Luteinizing Hormone]] (LH).  However, when used regularly, GnRH agonists cause a decreased release of FSH and LH. Prolonged use has a risk of causing osteoporosis. After stopping GnRH agonists, pubertal changes resume within 3-12 months.
