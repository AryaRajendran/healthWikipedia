'''Collingwood Stockade''' was a penal stockade in modern day [[Carlton North, Victoria]], [[Australia]]. It was built in 1853 and was in use until 1866 when it was converted into an asylum, which then closed in 1873. The stockade no longer exists but the area has several reminders of it, including the Stockade Hotel on [[Nicholson Street, Melbourne|Nicholson Street]] and Lee St Primary School which is built on the site of the old stockade buildings.

==Stockade==
One of four [[stockades]] in the [[Melbourne]] area at the time,<ref name=stockades>The four original stockades in metropolitan Melbourne were [[Pentridge]] (opened in 1850), Richmond (1852), Collingwood (1853) and the 'Marine Stockade' at Williamstown (1853).</ref> Collingwood Stockade opened on the 3 February 1853.<ref name=leemanacles>{{cite web

The buildings initially comprised a main hall with three [[Dormitories#Correctional facilities|dormitories]], although extra wings and [[bluestone]] buildings were added later, and by 1855 it could house 300 prisoners.<ref name="Barrett">Barrett</ref>
The stockade was on {{convert|6|acre}} of grounds bordered by what are now Newry Street to the north, Princes Street to the south, Canning Street to the east and Rathdowne Street to the west. Prisoners could obtain remission of their sentences by working in the bluestone [[quarry]] in what is now Curtain Square, or by attending educational classes and [[Sunday school]].<ref name=leemanacles/>

==Asylum==
Demand for land, public animosity toward the stockade and prison reform led to the stockade's closure. All prisoners were transferred to the new prison at [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge]], and in August 1866 the stockade became an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]], initially for mentally ill prisoners from other jails, and then as a public asylum with both short- and long-term wards. In 1868 Collingwood ceased to admit acute patients who had previously been retained in the gaols. The recently opened country asylums at [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] and [[Beechworth]] had eased the pressure on Collingwood to accommodate those patients, thus Collingwood became an establishment for the accommodation of the mentally retarded.<ref name=prov/> With the opening of the [[Kew Asylum]] in 1872, Collingwood ceased to function as an independent institution, and functioned merely as a ward of Kew.<ref name=leecamisoles>{{cite web

==School==
On the 3rd of June, 1873 the Rev. C. S. Perry suggested that the Collingwood Lunatic Asylum should be secured for State School purposes. This proposal met with approval and on the 16th June 1873 the last of the asylum inmates were transferred to Kew and the Collingwood site was officially made available to the Education Department as of the 17th June.<ref name=leeslate>{{cite web

The school buildings were in a poor state of repair, and the majority were replaced by the existing school buildings in 1878.  In 1879 the school changed its name to Lee Street State School. Only two buildings survived into the twentieth century – the Governors House and Prisoner's mess.  The Prisoner's Mess was one of the earliest buildings of the stockade.  Constructed out of timber and iron, it was used as the school's shelter shed until the 1920s when it was demolished.  The Governors House later became the school principal's residence and was also demolished in 1913 after it had fallen into a state of disrepair.<ref name="Barrett" />  The present day school has a bluestone slab thought to have been part of the Governor's House which reads H.M.S. (Her Majesty's Stockade) T.M.S. (Thomas Malcolm Smith, the first Governor). Also has been seen in the movie "Grave Encounters". This place is haunted says sources and the actors of the movie who never returned from there.
