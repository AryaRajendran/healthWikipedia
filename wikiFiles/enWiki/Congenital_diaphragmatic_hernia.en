'''Congenital diaphragmatic hernia''' (CDH) is a [[congenital malformation]] (birth defect) of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]].  The most common type of CDH is a [[Bochdalek hernia]];  other types include '''Morgagni hernia''', '''diaphragm eventration''' and '''central tendon defects''' of the diaphragm.  Malformation of the diaphragm allows the [[abdomen|abdominal]] organs to push into the proper [[lung]] formation.

CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants, and a major cause of death due to two complications: [[pulmonary hypoplasia]] and [[pulmonary hypertension]].<ref name="pmid19154527">{{cite journal

==Types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia==

===Bochdalek hernia===
{{Main|Bochdalek hernia}}
The Bochdalek hernia, also known as a postero-lateral diaphragmatic hernia, is the most common manifestation of CDH, accounting for more than 95% of cases. In this instance the diaphragm abnormality is characterized by a hole in the postero-lateral corner of the diaphragm which allows passage of the abdominal viscera into the chest cavity.  The majority of Bochdalek hernias (80-85%) occur on the left side of the diaphragm, a large proportion of the remaining cases occur on the right side.

===Morgagni hernia===
This rare anterior defect of the diaphragm is variably referred to as Morgagni, retrosternal, or parasternal hernia. Accounting for approximately 2% of all CDH cases, it is characterized by herniation through the [[foramina of Morgagni]] which are located immediately adjacent to the [[xiphoid process]] of the [[Human sternum|sternum]].  The majority of hernias occur on the right side of the body

===Diaphragm eventration===
The diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic eventration is used when there is abnormal displacement (i.e. elevation) of part or all of an otherwise intact diaphragm into the chest cavity. This rare type of CDH occurs because in the region of eventration the diaphragm is thinner, allowing the abdominal viscera to protrude upwards.

==Pathophysiology==
It involves three major defects.
* A failure of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] to completely close during [[Morphogenesis|development]].
* [[Hernia]]tion of the [[abdomen|abdominal]] contents into the [[chest]]
* [[Pulmonary]] [[hypoplasia]]

==Morbidity and mortality==
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia has a mortality rate of 40-62%,<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/978118-overview</ref> outcomes being more favorable in the absence of other congenital abnormalities.  Individual rates vary greatly dependent upon multiple factors; size of hernia, organs involved, additional birth defects or genetic problems, amount of lung growth, age and size at birth, type of treatments, timing of treatments, complications such as infections and lack of lung function.

==Presentation and diagnosis==

This condition can often be diagnosed before birth and [[fetal intervention]] can sometimes help, depending on the severity of the condition.<ref>{{cite news | title=Deadly hernia corrected in womb - Surgeons have developed an operation to repair a potentially fatal abnormality in babies before they are born. | date=2004-07-26 | publisher=BBC news | accessdate=2006-07-14}} - report of new operation, pioneered at London's [[King's College Hospital]] which reduced death rates in the most at risk by 50%</ref>
Infants born with diaphragmatic hernia experience respiratory failure due to both [[pulmonary hypertension]] and pulmonary hypoplasia. The first condition is a restriction of blood flow through the lungs thought to be caused by defects in the lung. Pulmonary hypoplasia or decreased lung volume is directly related to the abdominal organs presence in the chest cavity which causes the lungs to be severely undersized, especially on the side of the hernia.

Survival rates for infants with this condition vary, but have generally been increasing through advances in neonatal medicine. Work has been done to correlate survival rates to ultrasound measurements of the lung volume as compared to the baby's head circumference. This figure known as the lung to head ratio (LHR).

A small percentage of cases go unrecognized into adulthood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Swain F, Klaus A, Achem S, Hinder R |title=Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia in Adults |journal=Surgical Innovation |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=246–255 |year=2001 |doi=10.1177/155335060100800404}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
First step in management is orogastric tube placement and securing the airway (intubation). The baby will usually be immediately placed on a ventilator.
[[ECMO]] has been used as part of the treatment strategy at some hospitals.<ref name="pmid17706494">{{cite journal |author=Tiruvoipati R, Vinogradova Y, Faulkner G, Sosnowski AW, Firmin RK, Peek GJ |title=Predictors of outcome in patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=1345–50 |year=2007 |pmid=17706494 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.03.031}}</ref><ref name="pmid17637787">{{cite journal |author=Logan JW, Rice HE, Goldberg RN, Cotten CM |title=Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: a systematic review and summary of best-evidence practice strategies |journal=Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=535–49 |year=2007 |pmid=17637787 |doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211794}}</ref> ECMO stands for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and is basically like baby heart-lung bypass (though it can be used for older children as well.) A cannula is inserted into the carotid artery, allowing the blood to exit the body and begin its trek through the ECMO circuit, it is then scrubbed, oxygenated, and passes through a filter before being returned to the body via a second cannula into the babies own circulatory system where it makes its rounds before returning to the ECMO circuit to be oxygenated again. In essence, the ECMO circuit acts as the baby's lungs. Baby's require extra blood volume and hefty doses of blood thinners in order to keep the circuit running without clots forming, which could be potentially fatal. Even though the baby is not using her lungs, an ocillating ventilator maybe still be used to keep some air in the lungs so that they do not fully collapse while not being used. During ECMO the pulmonary artery has a chance to rest, as it were, thus hopefully reducing the presence of pulmonary hypertension, one of the biggest complication of CDH cases. CDH repair can be done while the baby is on ECMO, although the blood thinners increase the risks. Usually surgeons prefer to perform CDH repairs off ECMO. Once the baby is taken off ECMO the carotid artery is sealed and can no longer be used. When repairing the hernia an incision is made in the abdomen. The hernia can sometimes be simply stitched closed but in more complicated cases a patch may be required. A synthetic patch can be used but will usually require replacement later as the child grows. A more natural patch can be created by slicing and folding over a section of abdominal muscle and securing it to the exsiting piece of diaphragm. Any organ displacement is corrected during surgery. Though the heart and lungs will usually move back into position on their own, once displaced organs such as bowel, liver, or stomach, are out of the way. The incision is then closed. Sometimes, the incision site will be left open to allow the body to adjust to newly moved organs and the pressure associated with that, and then closed later once swelling and drainage has decreased.<ref>personal experience and talking with doctors, nurses, and surgeons at Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, UT</ref>

Diaphragm eventration is typically repaired thoracoscopically, by a technique called plication of the diaphragm.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Becmeur F, Talon I, Schaarschmidt K, ''et al.'' |title=Thoracoscopic diaphragmatic eventration repair in children: about 10 cases |journal=J. Pediatr. Surg. |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1712–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16291157 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2005.07.008}}</ref> Plication basically involves a folding of the eventrated diaphragm which is then sutured in order to “take up the slack” of the excess diaphragm tissue.
