'''Evidence-based medicine''' ('''EBM'''), also called '''evidence-based health care''' ('''EBHC''') or '''Evidence-based practice''' ('''EBP''') to broaden its application to allied health care professionals, has been defined as "the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients."<ref name="Sackett96"/><ref name="Timmermans2005">{{cite journal |author=Timmermans S, Mauck A |title=The promises and pitfalls of evidence-based medicine |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–28 |year=2005 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/1/18.long |pmid=15647212 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.18 }}</ref> Trisha Greenhalgh and [[Anna Donald]] define it more specifically as "the use of mathematical estimates of the risk of benefit and harm, derived from high-quality research on population samples, to inform clinical decision-making in the diagnosis, investigation or management of individual patients."<ref>Greenhalgh, Trisha.

Evidence quality can be assessed based on the source type (from [[meta-analyses]] and [[systematic reviews]] of triple-blind randomized [[clinical trials]] with concealment of allocation and no attrition at the top end, down to [[conventional wisdom]] at the bottom), as well as other factors including statistical validity, clinical relevance, currency, and peer-review acceptance. EBM recognizes that many aspects of health care depend on individual factors such as [[quality of life|quality-]] and [[value of life|value-of-life]] judgments, which are only partially subject to quantitative scientific methods. Application of EBM data therefore depends on patient circumstances and preferences, and medical treatment remains subject to input from personal, political, philosophical, ethical, economic, and aesthetic values.

==Background and definition==
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has evolved from clinical [[epidemiology]],<ref name="Doi12">{{harvnb|Doi|2012}}</ref> a discipline promoted by the creation of the ''Journal of Clinical Epidemiology'' in 1988. Clinical epidemiology aims to bridge the gap between clinical practice and [[public health]] using population health sciences to inform clinical practice. Thus, the methodology that underpins EBM applies methods used in the field of epidemiology to the clinical context (i.e. clinical epidemiology). In essence, EBM incorporates this quantitative (as well as qualitative) methodology in the “art” of clinical practice, so as to make the framework for clinical decisions more objective by better reflecting the evidence from research.<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|2001|pp=xi–xiv}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Grobbee|Hoes|2009|pp=3–6}}</ref> By introducing scientific methods{{spaced ndash}}particularly the methods of the [[population science]]s{{spaced ndash}}in clinical [[decision making]], EBM has driven a transformation of clinical practice in medicine.

In 1996 [[David Sackett]] wrote that "Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients."<ref name="Sackett96"/> This definition, put forward by one of the original proponents of evidence-based medicine,<ref name="Guyatt"/> has since been adopted by major organizations, including the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine.<ref name="Cochrane-what">{{cite web|title=Evidence-based health care and systematic reviews|url=http://www.cochrane.org/about-us/evidence-based-health-care|publisher=The Cochrane Collaboration|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="CEBM-what">{{cite web|title=What is EBM?|url=http://www.cebm.net/?o=1014|publisher=CEBM – Centre for Evidence Based Medicine|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>

===Evidence-based health service===
An evidence-based health service tends to generate an increase in the competence of health service decision makers and is the practice of evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level. It strengthens the motivation of any health service decision-maker to use scientific methods when making a decision and details of this approach to health services and public health has been discussed in a book titled ''evidence-based healthcare & public health''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gray, J. A.

===Evidence-based decision making===
The results of population-based research form the foundation of evidence-based medicine. It aims to use the experience of a population of patients reported in the research literature to guide decision making in practice. This practice of evidence-based medicine requires the application of population-based data to the care of an individual patient.<ref name=Doi12/> In the past, we have relied on the experience of physicians or other health care workers to make decisions about therapy. In the current information era, this approach would be suboptimal as health care workers rapidly find themselves unable to cope with the influx of a huge variety of new information, from the irrelevant to the very important. Therefore, evidence-based decision making gradually emerged as a solution to integrate the best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values and expectations as practiced by the individual [[health care provider]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eddy DM |title=Evidence-based medicine: a unified approach |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=9–17 |year=2005 |pmid=15647211 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.1.9 }}</ref> The concepts and ideas attributed to and labeled collectively as EBM/EBHC have now become a part of daily clinical lives, and health care professionals increasingly hear about evidence-based guidelines, care paths, questions and solutions. The controversy has shifted from whether to implement the new concepts to how to do so sensibly and efficiently, while avoiding potential problems associated with a number of misconceptions about what EBM/EBHC is and what it is not.<ref name=Doi12/> The EBM/EBHC-related concepts of hierarchy of evidence, meta-analyses, confidence intervals, study design, and so forth are so widespread, that health care professionals have no choice but to become familiar with EBM/EBHC principles and methodologies.

==Process and progress==
The five steps of EBM in practice were first described in 1992<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cook DJ, Jaeschke R, Guyatt GH |title=Critical appraisal of therapeutic interventions in the intensive care unit: human monoclonal antibody treatment in sepsis.

Using techniques from [[science]], [[engineering]] and [[statistics]], such as the [[systematic review]] of [[medical literature]], [[meta-analysis]], [[risk-benefit analysis]], and [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs), EBM aims for the ideal that [[healthcare]] professionals should make "conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence" in their everyday practice. ''[[Ex cathedra]]'' statements by the "medical [[expert]]" are considered to be the least valid form of evidence. All "experts" are now expected to reference their pronouncements to scientific studies.

The systematic review of published research studies is a major method used for evaluating particular treatments. The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] is one of the best-known, respected examples of systematic reviews. Like other collections of systematic reviews, it requires authors to provide a detailed and repeatable plan of their literature search and evaluations of the evidence.<ref name="Tanjong2009">{{cite journal|last=Tanjong-Ghogomu|first=E|coauthors=Tugwell, P; Welch, V|title=Evidence-based medicine and the Cochrane Collaboration|journal=Bulletin of the NYU hospital for joint diseases|year=2009|volume=67|issue=2|pages=198–205|pmid=19583554|url=http://www.nyuhjdbulletin.org/Permalink.aspx?permalinkId=07a150ec-2275-4bbf-9003-6ea200b62a4f}}</ref> Once all the best evidence is assessed, treatment is categorized as "likely to be beneficial", "likely to be harmful", or "evidence did not support either benefit or harm".

Generally, there are three distinct, but interdependent, areas of evidence-based medicine. The first is to treat individual patients with acute or chronic pathologies with treatments supported in the most scientifically valid medical literature. Thus, medical practitioners would select treatment options for specific cases based on the best research for each patient they treat. The second area is the systematic review of medical literature to evaluate the best studies on specific topics. This process can be human-centered, as in a [[journal club]], or technical, using computer programs and information techniques such as [[data mining]]. Increased use of [[information technology]] turns large volumes of information into practical guides. Finally, evidence-based medicine can be understood as a medical "movement" in which advocates work to popularize the method and usefulness of the practice in the public, patient communities, educational institutions and [[continuing education]] of practicing professionals {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

==Assessing the quality of evidence{{anchor|Qualification of evidence}}==
Evidence-based medicine categorizes different types of clinical evidence and rates or grades them<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/product/ebm_loe.cfm?show=grade |title=EBM: Levels of Evidence |publisher=Essential Evidence Plus |accessdate=2012-02-23}}</ref> according to the strength of their freedom from the various biases that beset medical research. For example, the strongest evidence for therapeutic interventions is provided by systematic review of [[randomized trial|randomized]], [[triple-blind]], [[placebo-controlled studies|placebo-controlled trials]] with allocation concealment and complete follow-up involving a homogeneous patient population and medical condition. In contrast, patient testimonials, case reports, and even expert opinion (however some critics have argued that expert opinion "does not belong in the rankings of the quality of [[empirical evidence]] because it does not represent a form of empirical evidence" and continue that "expert opinion would seem to be a separate, complex type of knowledge that would not fit into hierarchies otherwise limited to empirical evidence alone."<ref name="Tonelli99">{{cite journal |author=Tonelli MR |title=In defense of expert opinion |journal=Acad Med |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1187–92 |year=1999 |month=November |pmid=10587679 }}</ref>) have little value as proof because of the placebo effect, the biases inherent in observation and reporting of cases, difficulties in ascertaining who is an expert and more.

===US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)===
Systems to stratify evidence by quality have been developed, such as this one by the [[US Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] for ranking evidence about the effectiveness of treatments or screening:<ref name="USPrevServTaskForce">{{cite book|author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|title=Guide to clinical preventive services: report of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eQGJHgI_dR8C&pg=PR24 |date=August 1989|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-56806-297-6|pages=24–}}</ref>
* Level I: Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed [[randomized controlled trial]].
* Level II-1: Evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without [[randomization]].
* Level II-2: Evidence obtained from well-designed [[Cohort study|cohort]] or [[case-control]] analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group.
* Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.
* Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.

===UK National Health Service===
The UK [[National Health Service]] uses a similar system with categories labeled A, B, C, and D. The above Levels are only appropriate for treatment or interventions; different types of research are required for assessing diagnostic accuracy or natural history and prognosis, and hence different "levels" are required. For example, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine suggests levels of evidence (LOE) according to the study designs and [[critical appraisal]] of prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and harm studies:<ref name="OxfordCentreLevels">{{cite web |url=http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1025 |publisher=CEBM |title=Levels of Evidence | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5WzDhg0vl | archivedate = 2008-04-10| deadurl=no}}</ref>
* Level A: Consistent [[randomized controlled trial|Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial]], [[cohort study]], all or none (see note below), clinical decision rule validated in different populations.
* Level B: Consistent Retrospective Cohort, Exploratory Cohort, Ecological Study, Outcomes Research, [[case-control study]]; or extrapolations from level A studies.
* Level C: [[Case-series study]] or extrapolations from level B studies.
* Level D: Expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal, or based on [[physiology]], bench research or first principles.

===Categories of recommendations===
In [[guideline (medical)|guidelines]] and other publications, recommendation for a clinical service is classified by the balance of risk versus benefit of the service ''and'' the level of evidence on which this information is based. The [[US Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] uses:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/3rduspstf/ratings.htm |title=Task Force Ratings |accessdate=2007-09-24 }}</ref>
* Level A: Good scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service substantially outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level B: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the benefits of the clinical service outweighs the potential risks. Clinicians should discuss the service with eligible patients.
* Level C: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that there are benefits provided by the clinical service, but the balance between benefits and risks are too close for making general recommendations. Clinicians need not offer it unless there are individual considerations.
* Level D: At least fair scientific evidence suggests that the risks of the clinical service outweighs potential benefits. Clinicians should not routinely offer the service to asymptomatic patients.
* Level I: Scientific evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, such that the risk versus benefit balance cannot be assessed. Clinicians should help patients understand the uncertainty surrounding the clinical service.

===GRADE working group===
A newer system was developed by the [[GRADE working group]] and takes into account more dimensions than just the quality of medical research.<ref name="GRADE">{{cite web |url=http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ |title=GRADE working group |accessdate=2007-09-24 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5EyFmnBjw | archivedate = 2006-04-07| deadurl=no}}</ref> It requires users of GRADE who are performing an assessment of the quality of evidence, usually as part of a [[systematic review]], to consider the impact of different factors on their confidence in the results. Authors of GRADE tables, grade the quality of evidence into four levels, on the basis of their confidence in the observed effect(a numerical value) being close to what the true effect is. The confidence value is based on judgements assigned in five different domains in a structured manner.<ref name="Balshem 2011">{{cite journal |author=Balshem H, Helfand M, Schünemann HJ, ''et al.'' |title=GRADE guidelines: 3. Rating the quality of evidence |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=401–6 |year=2011 |month=April |pmid=21208779 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.07.015 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895-4356(10)00332-X}}</ref> The GRADE working group defines 'quality of evidence' and 'strength of recommendations' based on the quality as two different concepts which are commonly confused with each other.<ref name="Balshem 2011"/>

Systematic reviews may include Randomized Controlled trials that have low risk of bias, or, observational studies that have high risk of bias. In the case of Randomized controlled trials, the quality of evidence is high, but can be downgraded in five different domains.<ref name="GRADE Handbook">{{cite book|title=GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendation|year=2009|url=Available from http://www.cc-ims.net/gradepro|edition=Version 3.2|editor=Schünemann H, Brożek J, Oxman A,}} {{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>
* Risk of bias: Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that bias in included studies have influenced the estimate of effect.
* Imprecision: Is a judgement made on the basis of the chance that the observed estimate of effect could change completely.
* Indirectness: Is a judgement made on the basis of the differences in characteristics of how the study was conducted and how the results are actually going to be applied.
* Inconsistency: Is a judgement made on the basis of the variability of results across the included studies.
* Publication bias: Is a judgement made on the basis of the question whether all the research evidence has been taken to account.
In the case of observational studies, the quality of evidence starts of lower and may be upgraded in three domains in addition to being subject to downgrading.<ref name="GRADE Handbook"/>
* Large effect: This is when methodologically strong studies show that the observed effect is so large that the probability of it changing completely is less likely.
* Plausible confounding would change the effect: This is when despite the presence of a possible confounding factor which is expected to reduce the observed effect, the effect estimate still shows significant effect.
* Dose response gradient: This is when the intervention used becomes more effective with increasing dose. This suggests that a further increase will likely bring about more effect.

Meaning of the levels of Quality of evidence as per GRADE<ref name="Balshem 2011"/>
* High Quality Evidence: The authors are very confident that the estimate that is presented lies very close to the true value. One could interpret it as: there is very low probability of further research completely changing the presented conclusions.
* Moderate Quality Evidence: The authors are confident that the presented estimate lies close to the true value, but it is also possible that it may be substantially different. One could also interpret it as: further research may completely change the conclusions.
* Low Quality Evidence: The authors are not confident in the effect estimate and the true value may be substantially different. One could interpret it as: further research is likely to change the presented conclusions completely.
* Very low quality Evidence: The authors do not have any confidence in the estimate and it is likely that the true value is substantially different from it. One could interpret it as: New research will most probably change the presented conclusions completely.

Guideline panelists may make '''Strong''' or '''Weak recommendations''' on the basis of further criteria. Some of the important criteria are:<ref name="GRADE Handbook"/>
* Balance between desirable and undesirable effects (not considering cost)
* Quality of the evidence
* Values and preferences
* Costs (resource utilization)

Despite the differences between systems, the purposes are the same: to guide users of clinical research information on which studies are likely to be most valid. However, the individual studies still require careful critical appraisal.

==Statistical measures==
Evidence-based medicine attempts to express clinical benefits of tests and treatments using mathematical methods. Tools used by practitioners of evidence-based medicine include:

===Likelihood ratio===
{{main|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}} The [[pre-test odds]] of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the [[post-test odds]]. (Odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, the [more familiar] probability.) This reflects [[Bayes' theorem]]. The differences in likelihood ratio between clinical tests can be used to prioritize clinical tests according to their usefulness in a given clinical situation.

===AUC-ROC===
The area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve (AUC-ROC) reflects the relationship between [[sensitivity and specificity]] for a given test. High-quality tests will have an AUC-ROC approaching 1, and high-quality publications about clinical tests will provide information about the AUC-ROC. Cutoff values for positive and negative tests can influence specificity and sensitivity, but they do not affect AUC-ROC.

===Number needed to treat / harm===
[[Number needed to treat]] or [[Number needed to harm]] are ways of expressing the effectiveness and safety of an intervention in a way that is clinically meaningful. In general, NNT is always computed with respect to two treatments A and B, with A typically a drug and B a placebo (in our example above, A is a 5-year treatment with the hypothetical drug, and B is no treatment). A defined endpoint has to be specified (in our example: the appearance of colon cancer in the 5 year period). If the probabilities pA and pB of this endpoint under treatments A and B, respectively, are known, then the NNT is computed as 1/(pB-pA). The NNT for breast mammography is 285; that is, 285 mammograms need to be performed to diagnose one breast cancer.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} As another example, an NNT of 4 means if 4 patients are treated, only one would respond.

An NNT of 1 is the most effective and means each patient treated responds, e.g., in comparing antibiotics with placebo in the eradication of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''. An NNT of 2 or 3 indicates that a treatment is quite effective (with one patient in 2 or 3 responding to the treatment). An NNT of 20 to 40 can still be considered clinically effective.<ref>{{cite web

==Quality of clinical trials==
Evidence-based medicine attempts to objectively evaluate the quality of clinical research by critically assessing techniques reported by researchers in their publications.
* Trial design considerations. High-quality studies have clearly defined eligibility criteria and have minimal missing data.
* Generalizability considerations. Studies may only be applicable to narrowly defined patient populations and may not be generalizable to other clinical contexts.
* Follow-up. Sufficient time for defined outcomes to occur can influence the study outcomes and the [[statistical power]] of a study to detect differences between a treatment and control arm.
* Power. A mathematical calculation can determine if the number of patients is sufficient to detect a difference between treatment arms. A negative study may reflect a lack of benefit, or simply a lack of sufficient quantities of patients to detect a difference.

==Limitations and criticism==
Although evidence-based medicine is regarded as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of conventional [[conventional medicine|clinical practice]], limitations or criticisms of its use exist,<ref name="Timmermans2005"/> such as:
* EBM produces quantitative research, especially from [[randomized controlled trial]]s (RCTs).

==In psychiatry==

Standard descriptions about mental illnesses, such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], have been criticized as incompletely justified by evidence. In many cases, it is unknown whether a particular "disease" has one, several, or no underlying biological causes, with controversy arising over whether some diseases are merely an artifact of the attempt to construct a unified classification scheme, rather than a "real" disease.<ref name="sobo">{{cite journal |author=Sobo S |title=Pursuing treatments that are not evidence based: how DSM IV clarifies, how it blinds psychiatrists to issues in need of investigation |journal=Med.

While some experts point to statistics in support of the idea that a lack of adoption of research findings results in suboptimal treatment for many patients, others emphasize the importance of the skill of the practitioner and the customization of the treatment to fit individual needs. There is some controversy over whether mental illnesses are too complex for broad population studies to be helpful.<ref name="sobo" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Can Science Make Psychotherapy More Effective?|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=121092295|publisher=Science Friday / National Public Radio|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref>

In 1967, the American physician and mathematician Alvan R. Feinstein published his groundbreaking work ''Clinical Judgment'', which together with [[Archie Cochrane]]’s famous book ''Effectiveness and Efficiency'' (1972) led to an increasing acceptance of clinical epidemiology and controlled studies during the 70s and 80s and paved the way for the institutional development of EBM in the 90s. Cochrane's efforts were recognized by the fact that an international network for efficacy assessment in medicine - the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] – was posthumously named after him. However, Cochrane himself did not live to see the foundation and institutionalization of the EBM movement and Feinstein became later in his life one of its sharpest methodological critics.<ref>{{cite book| author = Heinrich Weßling| title = Theorie der klinischen Evidenz: Versuch einer Kritik der Evidenzbasierten Medizin| date = 2011-04| publisher = LIT Verlag Münster| isbn = 978-3-643-90065-4| pages = 39–50 }}</ref>

The explicit methodologies used to determine "best evidence" were largely established by the [[McMaster University]] research group led by [[David Sackett]] and [[Gordon Guyatt]]. Guyatt later coined the term “evidence-based” in 1990.<ref name = "Howick2011">{{cite book| author = Jeremy H.

All of these were co-founded by [[Anna Donald]], an Australian pioneer in the discipline.

==EBM and ethics of experimental or risky treatments==
Insurance companies in the United States and public insurers in other countries usually wait for drug use approval based on evidence-based guidelines before funding a treatment. Where approval for a drug has been given, and subsequent evidence-based findings indicating that a drug may be less safe than originally anticipated, some insurers in the U.S. have reacted very cautiously and withdrawn funding. For example, an older generic [[statin]] drug had been shown to reduce mortality, but a newer and much more expensive statin drug was found to lower cholesterol more effectively. However, evidence came to light about safety concerns with the new drug which caused some insurers to stop funding it even though marketing approval was not withdrawn.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2004-12-26-crestor-cover_x.htm |title= What do you believe when drug messages conflict? |work= USA Today|accessdate= 2010-05-02| first1=Julie | last1=Appleby | date=2004-12-26}}</ref>

Some people are willing to take their chances to gamble their health on the success of new drugs or old drugs in new situations which may not yet have been fully tested in clinical trials. However insurance companies are reluctant to take on the job of funding such treatments, preferring instead to take the safer route of awaiting the results of clinical testing and leaving the funding of such trials to the manufacturer seeking a license.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/02/12/MNGD0H7AGT1.DTL&hw=stanford&sn=013&sc=110 |title=In fight for life, insurer no help |work= The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Victoria | last=Colliver | date=2006-02-12}}</ref>

Sometimes caution errs in the other direction. [[Kaiser Permanente]] did not change its methods of evaluating whether or not new therapies were too "experimental" to be covered until it was successfully sued twice: once for delaying [[in vitro fertilization]] treatments for two years after the courts determined that scientific evidence of efficacy and safety had reached the "reasonable" stage; and in another case where Kaiser refused to pay for liver transplantation in infants when it had already been shown to be effective in adults, on the basis that use in infants was still "experimental."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sugarman M |title=Permanente Physicians Determine Use of New Technology: Kaiser Permanente's Interregional New Technologies Committee |journal=The Permanente Journal
|volume=5 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2001 |url=http://xnet.kp.org/permanentejournal/winter01/HSnewtec.html }}</ref> Here again, the problem of induction plays a key role in arguments.

==Application of the evidence based model on other public policy matters==
There has been discussion of applying what has been learned from EBM to public policy. In his 1996 inaugural speech as President of the Royal Statistical Society, Adrian Smith held out evidence-based medicine as an exemplar for ''all'' public policy. He proposed that "[[evidence-based policy]]" should be established for education, prisons and policing policy and all areas of government.<ref name="madcows">{{cite journal |author=Smith, A.F.M. |title=Mad cows and ecstasy: chance and choice in an evidence-based society |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A |volume=159 |pages=367–83 |year=1996 |doi=10.2307/2983324 |issue=3}}</ref>
