'''Body dysmorphic disorder''' ('''BDD''', also '''body dysmorphia''', '''dysmorphic syndrome'''; originally '''dysmorphophobia''') is a type of [[mental illness]], a [[somatoform disorder]], wherein the affected person is concerned with [[body image]], manifested as excessive concern about and preoccupation with a perceived defect of their physical features.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1996.tb09817.x |title=A conceptual and quantitative analysis of 178 historical cases of dysmorphophobia |year=1996 |last1=Berrios |first1=G.

The causes of body dysmorphic disorder are different for each person, usually a combination of [[biology|biological]], [[psychological]], and environmental factors.

BDD is linked to a diminished [[quality of life]], can be [[comorbidity|co-morbid]] with [[major depressive disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]] (chronic [[social anxiety]]); features a [[suicidal ideation]] rate of 80 percent, in extreme cases linked with [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], and thus can be  considered a factor in the person's attempting [[suicide]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18697504 |year=2008 |last1=Hunt |first1=TJ |last2=Thienhaus |first2=O |last3=Ellwood |first3=A |title=The mirror lies: Body dysmorphic disorder |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=217–22 |journal=American family physician}}</ref> BDD can be treated with either  [[psychotherapy]] or [[psychiatric medication]], or both; moreover, [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT) and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) are effective treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9810776 |year=1998 |last1=Phillips |first1=KA |title=Body dysmorphic disorder: Clinical aspects and treatment strategies |volume=62 |issue=4 Suppl A |pages=A33–48 |journal=Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hollander |first1=E |last2=Cohen |first2=LJ |last3=Simeon |first3=D |title=Body dysmorphic disorder |journal=Psychiatric Annals |year=1993 |volume=23 |pages=359–64}}</ref> Although originally a mental-illness diagnosis usually applied to women, body dysmorphic disorder occurs equally among men and women, and occasionally in children and older adults.

==Overview==
The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' defines body dysmorphic disorder as a somatoform disorder marked by a preoccupation with an imagined or trivial defect in appearance that causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The individual's symptoms must not be better accounted for by another disorder; for example, [[body weight|weight concern]] in the case of [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref name = DSM>{{cite book | title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition text revision | publisher=American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC | year=2000 | pages=507–510}}</ref> The defect in appearance must be imagined,<ref name = DSM/> which excludes having an actual disfiguring physical defect.<ref name="bowe">{{cite journal|url=http://www.drwhitneybowe.com/articles/BDD%20Acne%20JAAD.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2007.03.030 |title=Body dysmorphic disorder symptoms among patients with acne vulgaris |format=PDF |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology]] |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] |first1=Whitney P. |last1=Bowe |first2=James J. |last2=Leyden |first3=Canice E. |last3=Crerand |first4=David B. |last4=Sarwer |first5=David J. |last5=Margolis |year=2007 |month=August |volume=57 |issue=2 |accessdate=2013-03-14 |archiveurl=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:x3MU2qwyUVMJ:www.drwhitneybowe.com/articles/BDD%2520Acne%2520JAAD.pdf+&hl=en&gl=au&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjHJZyGcHgydw-aXCiWwJDGa9fwRkLpemlH_qSLx7isG8NOFZoPlZZ-t9ipWW2IPnv4eQv9KvFYFk2Kf9-uOEFZJnW473tAxwktGzxpS8bTkfgLOKMlPq8rmDVj2ZHmRcUQhW6B&sig=AHIEtbRHMJFYvUabt6778wqXTnLrNroHhA |archivedate=2008-01-01}}</ref>

The disorder generally is diagnosed in those who are extremely critical of their mirror image, physique or self-image, even though there may be no noticeable disfigurement or defect. The three most common areas of which those suffering from BDD will feel critical have to do with the face: the hair, the skin, and the nose. Outside opinion will typically disagree and may protest that there even is a defect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

People with BDD say that they wish that they could change or improve ''some'' aspect of their physical appearance even though they may generally be of normal or even highly attractive appearance. Body dysmorphic disorder may cause sufferers to believe that they are so unspeakably hideous that they are unable to interact with others or function normally for fear of ridicule and humiliation about their appearance. This can cause those with this disorder to begin to seclude themselves or have trouble in social situations. More extreme cases may cause a person to develop [[love-shyness]], a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] avoidance of all intimate relationships. They can become secretive and reluctant to seek help because they fear that seeking help will force them to confront their insecurity. They may feel too embarrassed and unwilling to accept that others will tell the sufferer that they are suffering from a disorder. The sufferer believes that fixing the "deformity" is the only goal, and that if there is a disorder, it was caused by the deformity. In extreme cases, patients report that they would rather suffer from their symptoms than be 'convinced' into believing that they have no deformity. It has been suggested that fewer men seek help for the disorder than women.<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips |first=Katherine A. |year=1996 |title=The Broken Mirror |page=141 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> 

BDD is often misunderstood as a vanity-driven obsession, whereas it is quite the opposite; people with BDD do not believe themselves to be better looking than others, but instead feel that their perceived "defect" is irrevocably [[ugliness|ugly]] or not good enough. People with BDD may compulsively look at themselves in the mirror or, conversely, cover up and avoid mirrors. They typically think about their appearance often and, in severe cases, may drop all social contact and responsibilities as they become a [[recluse]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A German study has shown that 1–2% of the population meet all the diagnostic criteria of BDD, with a larger percentage showing milder symptoms of the disorder.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Psychological Medicine]] |title=Article unknown |volume=36 |page=877}}{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> Chronic low self-esteem is characteristic of those with BDD, because the assessment of self-value is so closely linked with the perception of one's appearance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

BDD is diagnosed equally in men and women and causes chronic [[social anxiety disorder|social anxiety]] for its sufferers.<ref>[http://www.lipo.com/Health_Articles/Lifestyle_Articles/When_the_mirror_lies_-_Body_dysmorphic_disorder_(dysmorphophobia)_on_the_rise_and_taking_lives ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

Phillips & Menard (2006) found the completed-suicide rate in patients with BDD to be 45 times higher than that of the general [[United States]] population. This rate is more than double that of those with [[clinical depression]] and three times as high as that of those with [[bipolar disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.7.1280 |title=Suicidality in Body Dysmorphic Disorder: A Prospective Study |year=2006 |last1=Phillips |first1=K.

It may be difficult to distinguish BDD from accurate (and justifiably emotionally fraught) self-perception by a perceptive individual who is actually physically disfigured in some way that would be acknowledged by others. This is a societally awkward topic, as we have a tendency today to use inclusive and supportive language in discussing body form. However, it must be acknowledged that humans do judge others' faces and bodies according to standards or spectra of [[physical attractiveness]]; that these judgements are not arbitrary but when studied tend to indicate general preference for such properties as symmetry and proportions close to the population average. There may be a tendency to over-diagnose BDD rather than to acknowledge this "unjust" or unfair aspect of human existence and human relations. It should be pointed out in this regard that the descriptions of the disorder hedge on the question of whether there is possibly actual disfigurement. "''may'' be no noticeable disfigurement" "though they ''may'' generally be of normal or even highly attractive appearance". The use of the term "perceived defect" in the diagnostic definition does not distinguish between an accurately or inaccurately perceived defect, and this may lead to over-diagnosis. In short, "emotional distress caused by rationally perceived body dysmorphia" should be categorized and treated differently than "misperceived or self-exaggerated body dysmorphia".{{cite quote|date=April 2012}}

==Symptoms==
There are many common symptoms and behaviors associated with BDD. Often these symptoms and behaviors are determined by the nature of the BDD sufferer's perceived defect; for example, use of [[cosmetics]] is most common in those with a perceived skin defect. Due to this perception dependency many BDD sufferers will only display a few common symptoms and behaviors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Symptoms===
Common symptoms of BDD include:{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
* Obsessive thoughts about (a) perceived appearance defect(s).
* Obsessive and compulsive behaviors related to (a) perceived appearance defect(s) (see section below).
* [[Major depressive disorder#Symptoms and signs|Major depressive disorder symptoms]].
* [[Delusion|Delusional thoughts and beliefs]] related to (a) perceived appearance defect(s).
* Social and family withdrawal, [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], [[loneliness]] and self-imposed [[social isolation]].
* [[Suicidal ideation]].
* [[Anxiety]]; possible [[panic attack]]s.
* Chronic low [[self-esteem]].
* Feeling [[Self-consciousness|self-conscious]] in social environments; thinking that others notice and mock their perceived defect(s).
* Strong feelings of [[shame]].
* [[Avoidant personality disorder|Avoidant personality]]: avoiding leaving the home or only leaving the home at certain times.
* [[Dependent personality disorder|Dependent personality]]: dependence on others, such as a partner, friend or family.
* Inability to [[employment|work]] or an inability to focus at work due to preoccupation with appearance



* Problems initiating and maintaining relationships (both intimate relationships and friendships).
* [[Alcohol abuse|Alcohol]] and/or [[drug abuse]] (often an attempt to [[Self-medication|self-medicate]]).
* Repetitive behavior (such as constantly (and heavily) applying make-up; regularly checking appearance in mirrors; see section below for more associated behavior).
* Seeing slightly [[hallucination|varying image of self]] upon each instance of observing a mirror or reflective surface.
* Perfectionism (undergoing cosmetic surgery and behaviors such as excessive moisturizing and exercising with the aim to achieve an ideal body type and reduce anxiety).
* Note: any kind of body modification may change one's appearance. There are many types of body modification that do not include surgery/cosmetic surgery. Body modification (or related behavior) may seem compulsive, repetitive, or focused on one or more areas or features that the individual perceives to be defective.

===Compulsive behaviors===
Common compulsive behaviors associated with BDD include:

* Compulsive mirror checking, glancing in reflective doors, windows and other reflective surfaces.
* Alternatively, inability to look at one's own reflection or photographs of oneself; also, removal of mirrors from the home.
* Attempting to camouflage the imagined defect: for example, using [[cosmetic camouflage]], wearing baggy clothing, maintaining specific body posture or wearing [[hat]]s.
* Use of distraction techniques to divert attention away from the person's perceived defect, e.g. wearing extravagant clothing or excessive jewelry.
* Excessive grooming behaviors: [[dermatillomania|skin-picking]], combing hair, [[trichotilimania|plucking eyebrows]], [[shaving]], etc.
* Compulsive skin-touching, especially to measure or feel the perceived defect.
* Immotivated hostility toward people, especially those of the opposite sex (or same sex if [[homosexual]]).
* Seeking reassurance from loved ones.
* Excessive [[dieting]] or [[exercise|exercising]], working on outside appearance.
* Self-harm.
* Comparing appearance/body parts with that/those of others, or obsessive viewing of favorite celebrities or models whom the person suffering from BDD wishes to resemble.
* Compulsive information-seeking: reading books, newspaper articles and websites that relate to the person's perceived defect, e.g. [[alopecia|losing hair]] or [[obesity|being overweight]].
* Obsession with [[plastic surgery]] or [[dermatology|dermatological procedures]], often with little satisfactory results (in the perception of the patient). In extreme cases, patients have attempted to perform plastic surgery on themselves, including [[liposuction]] and various implants, with disastrous results.
* Excessive [[enema]] use (if obesity is the concern).<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips |first=Katherine A. |year=2005 |edition=2 |title=The Broken Mirror |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}{{Page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>

===Common locations of perceived defects===
In research carried out by Dr. Katharine Philips, involving over 500 patients, 
the percentage of patients concerned with the most common locations were as follows;

People with BDD often have more than one area of concern.

===Comorbidity===
There is [[comorbidity]] with other psychological disorders, which often results in misdiagnoses by medical individuals. New research indicates that around 76% of people with BDD will experience [[major depressive disorder]] at some point in their lives,<ref name="Broken Mirror p391">{{cite book|last=Phillips |first=Katherine A. |year=1996 |title=The Broken Mirror |page=391 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=this book does not have a page 391|date=November 2009}} significantly higher than the 10–20% expected in the general population. Nearly 36% of people with BDD will also present with [[agoraphobia]]<ref name="Broken Mirror p391"/> and around 32% are also affected by [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].<ref name="Broken Mirror p391"/>

The most common [[Mental disorder|disorder]]s found in individuals with BDD are [[avoidant personality disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]] and [[dependent personality disorder]], which conforms to the introverted, [[shy]] and [[neuroticism|neurotic]] traits usually found in BDD sufferers.  [[Eating disorder]]s are also sometimes found in people with BDD, as are [[trichotillomania]], [[dermatillomania]], and sub-type disorders [[Olfactory Reference Syndrome]] and [[muscle dysmorphia]].<ref name="Broken Mirror p391"/>

==Causes==
BDD usually develops in [[teenagers]], a time when individuals are most concerned about the way they look to others. However, many patients suffer for years before seeking help. There is no single cause of body dysmorphic disorder; research shows that a number of factors may be involved and that they can occur in combination. BDD can be associated with eating disorders, such as [[compulsive overeating]], [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia]], or it can be more of a phobia, associated instead with [[social anxiety|social phobia]] or [[social anxiety disorder]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Obsessive–compulsive disorder===
BDD can often occur with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) and is regarded as an obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder along with OCD, [[hypochondria]], [[trichotillomania]], [[anorexia nervosa]] etc.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fornaro |first1=Michele |last2=Gabrielli |first2=Filippo |last3=Albano |first3=Claudio |first4=Stefania |last4=Fornaro |first5=Salvatore |last5=Rizzato |first6=Chiara |last6=Mattei |first7=Paola |last7=Solano |first8=Valentina |last8=Vinciguerra |first9=Pantaleo |last9=Fornaro |title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders: a comprehensive survey |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2013-03-14 |url=http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/8/1/13 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-8-13 |volume=8 |issue=13}}</ref> In all these conditions the patient practices unmanageable habitual behaviors that may literally take over their life. A history of, or genetic predisposition to OCD may make people more susceptible to BDD. Other phobias like [[social anxiety disorder]] may also be co-occurring.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Physical===
Skin conditions such as [[acne vulgaris]] are among the most common sources of distress of patients with BDD,<ref name="bowe"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17498840 |title=Body dysmorphic disorder symptoms among patients with acne vulgaris |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology]] |year=2007 |month=August |volume=57 |issue=2 |accessdate=2013-03-14 |last1=Bowe |first1=WP |last2=Leyden |first2=JJ |last3=Crerand |first3=CE |last4=Sarwer |first4=DB |last5=Margolis |first5=DJ |pmid=17498840}}</ref> especially in cases where the condition is severe such as cystic acne on a persons back, chest or face etc. BDD does not necessarily go away even once the acne clears as scarring caused by the acne often becomes the new "defect" in which the person focuses on, as can other skin conditions such as pigmentation or moles. The prevalence of acne in those with BDD has led to a subset of the condition called "Acne Dysmorphia".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/189435-acne-dysmorphia-getting-help/ |title=Acne Dysmorphia Getting Help |publisher=Livestrong.Com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref>

[[Eczema]], [[baldness]], [[dermatosis papulosa nigra]], [[freckles]], [[scarring]], [[skin tone]] and other physical traits such as body size and weight can also factor into the onset of BDD via low self-esteem and negative thinking.

===Psychological===

===Teasing or criticism===
It has been suggested that [[teasing]] or criticism regarding appearance could play a contributory role in the onset of BDD. While it is unlikely that teasing ''causes'' BDD, likewise, extreme levels of childhood abuse, bullying and psychological torture are often rationalized and dismissed as "teasing," sometimes leading to traumatic stress in vulnerable persons.<ref name="Broken Mirror p170-173">{{cite book|last=Phillips |first=Katherine A. |year=1996 |title=The Broken Mirror |pages=170–173 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> Around 60% of people with BDD report frequent or chronic childhood teasing.<ref name="Broken Mirror p170-173"/>

===Parenting style===
Similarly to teasing, [[parenting style]] may contribute to BDD onset; for example, parents who either place excessive emphasis on aesthetic appearance, or disregard it altogether, may act as a trigger in the genetically predisposed.<ref name="Broken Mirror p170-173"/>

===Other life experiences===
Many other life experiences may also act as triggers to BDD onset; for example, neglect, physical and/or sexual trauma, insecurity and rejection.<ref name="Broken Mirror p170-173"/>

===Environmental===

====Media====
It has been theorized that [[Mass media|media]] pressure may contribute to BDD onset; for example, [[glamour model]]s and the implied necessity of aesthetic beauty. However, BDD occurs in all parts of the world, including isolated areas where access to media is limited or (practically) non-existent. Media pressure is therefore an unlikely cause of BDD, although it may act as a trigger in those already genetically predisposed or could worsen existing BDD symptoms.<ref name="Broken Mirror p176-180">{{cite book|last=Phillips |first=Katherine A. |year=1996 |title=The Broken Mirror |pages=176–180 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>

===Personality===
Certain [[personality trait]]s may make someone more susceptible to developing BDD. Personality traits which have been proposed as contributing factors include:
<ref name="Broken Mirror p173-175">{{cite book|last=Phillips |first=Katherine A. |year=1996 |title=The Broken Mirror |pages=173–175 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>

* [[perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionism]]
* [[Introversion]]
* [[Neuroticism]]
* Sensitivity to [[Social rejection|rejection]] or [[criticism]]
* [[Assertiveness|Unassertiveness]]
* [[Avoidant personality disorder|Avoidant personality]]
* [[Schizoid personality disorder|Schizoid personality]]
* [[Shyness]]
* [[Social anxiety|Social phobia]]
* [[Social anxiety disorder]]

Since personality traits among people with BDD vary greatly, it is unlikely that these are the direct ''cause'' of BDD. However, like the aforementioned psychological and environmental factors, they may act as triggers in individuals.<ref name="Broken Mirror p173-175"/>

====Neurobiology====
There is evidence that individuals with BDD have abnormal visual processing when viewing their own face, others' faces, and inanimate objects. However, it is still unclear if these phenomena are the cause or effect of having BDD.<ref name="Feusner et al., 2010">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124119 |last1=Feusner |first1=JD |last2=Moody |first2=T |last3=Hembacher |first3=E |last4=Townsend |first4=J |last5=McKinley |first5=M |last6=Moller |first6=H |last7=Bookheimer |first7=S |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.190 |title=Abnormalities of visual processing and frontostriatal systems in body dysmorphic disorder |pmid=20124119

==Diagnoses==
According to the [[DSM IV]] to be diagnosed with BDD a person must fulfill the following criteria:
* "Preoccupation with an imagined or slight defect in appearance. If a slight physical anomaly is present, the person's concern is markedly excessive."
* "The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
* "The preoccupation is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., dissatisfaction with body shape and size in [[Anorexia Nervosa]])."<ref>{{cite journal|work=American Psychiatric Association |year=1994 |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}</ref>

In most cases, BDD is under-diagnosed. In a study of 17 patients with BDD, BDD was noted in only five patient charts, and none of the patients received an official diagnosis of BDD.<ref name="DoiX">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.63.2.263 |title=Cognitive-behavioral body image therapy for body dysmorphic disorder |year=1995 |last1=Rosen |first1=James C. |last2=Reiter |first2=Jeff |last3=Orosan |first3=Pam |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=263–9 |pmid=7751487}}</ref> This under-diagnosis is due to the disorder only recently being included in DSM IV; therefore, clinician knowledge of the disorder, particularly among [[general practitioner]]s, is not widespread.<ref name="Broken Mirror p39">{{cite book|last=Phillips |first=Katherine A. |year=1996 |title=The Broken Mirror |page=39 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>

Also, BDD is often associated with ''shame and secrecy''; therefore, patients often fail to reveal their appearance concerns for fear of appearing ''vain or superficial''.<ref name="Broken Mirror p39"/> 

BDD is also often misdiagnosed because its symptoms can mimic that of major depressive disorder or social phobia.<ref name="Broken Mirror p47">{{cite book|last=Phillips |first=Katherine A. |year=1996 |title=The Broken Mirror |page=47 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref> and so the cause of the individual's problems remain unresolved.

Many individuals with BDD also do not possess knowledge or insight into the disorder and so regard their problem as one of a physical rather than psychological nature; therefore, individuals suffering from BDD may seek cosmetic treatment rather than mental health treatment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Treatment==
Studies have found that [[cognitive behavior therapy]] (CBT) is effective in the majority of cases. In a study of 54 BDD patients who were randomly assigned to cognitive behavior therapy or no treatment, BDD symptoms decreased significantly in those patients undergoing CBT. BDD was eliminated in 82% of cases at post treatment and 77% at follow-up.<ref name="DoiX" /> 

Since BDD is believed to be linked to low [[serotonin]] levels in the brain, SSRIs ([[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s) and other [[antidepressants]] are commonly prescribed. 74 subjects were enrolled in a [[placebo]]-controlled study group to evaluate the efficiency of [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac); patients were enrolled in a 
12-weeks, double-blind, randomized study. At the end of treatment, 53% of patients responded to fluoxetine (with 18% of patients responding to the placebo).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.59.4.381 |title=A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Fluoxetine in Body Dysmorphic Disorder |year=2002 |last1=Phillips |first1=K. A. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–8 |pmid=11926939 |last2=Albertini |first2=RS |last3=Rasmussen |first3=SA}}</ref>

A combined approach of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and antidepressants is more effective than either alone. The dose of a given antidepressant is usually more effective when it exceeds the maximum recommended doses that are given for [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD) or a major depressive episode.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

If a person becomes aware that they have BDD then it is also possible to overcome the problem with regular positive self-affirmations and to acknowledge that the "defects" they have convinced themselves of are not an issue. Although this is dependent on the environment in which one lives as bullying, harassment and other negative influences would counteract or hinder progress in developing personal self-confidence.

==Prognosis==
Many individuals with BDD have repeatedly sought treatment from [[dermatology|dermatologists]] or [[cosmetic surgery|cosmetic surgeons]] with little satisfaction before finally accepting [[psychiatric]] or [[psychological]] help. Plastic surgery on these patients can lead to manifest [[psychosis]], [[suicide|suicidal tendencies]] or never-ending requests for more surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0095-4543(03)00076-9 |title=Body Dysmorphic Disorder |year=2002 |last1=Phillips |first1=Katharine A. |last2=Dufresne |first2=Raymond G. |journal=Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice |volume=29 |page=99}}</ref><ref>http://www.veale.co.uk/bddrefs.html</ref> Treatment can improve the outcome of the illness for most people. However, some may function reasonably well for a time and then relapse, while others may remain chronically ill. Outcome without therapy has not been researched but it is thought the symptoms persist unless treated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Epidemiology==
Studies show that BDD is common in not only non-clinical settings but clinical settings as well. A study was performed on 200 people with DSM-IV Body Dysmorphic Disorder, being of age 12 or older and being available to be interviewed in person. They were referred by mental health professionals, friends and relatives, non-psychiatric physicians or responded to advertisements. Out of the subjects, 53 were receiving medication, 33 were receiving psychotherapy, and 48 were receiving both medication and psychotherapy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The severity of BDD was assessed using the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] modified for BDD, and symptoms were assessed using a Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination Sheet. Both tests were designed specifically to assess BDD. The results showed that BDD occurs in 0.7–1.1% of community samples and 2–13% of non-clinical samples. 13% of psychiatric inpatients were diagnosed with BDD.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.46.4.317 |title=Demographic Characteristics, Phenomenology, Comorbidity, and Family History in 200 Individuals with Body Dysmorphic Disorder |year=2005 |last1=Phillips |first1=Katharine A. |last2=Menard |first2=William |last3=Fay |first3=Christina |last4=Weisberg |first4=Risa |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=317–25 |pmid=16000674 |pmc=1351257}}</ref> Some of the patients initially diagnosed with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)]] had BDD, as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

53 patients with OCD and 53 patients with BDD were compared on clinical features, comorbidity, family history, and demographic features. Nine of the 62 subjects (14.5%) of those with OCD also had BDD.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v59n1102 |title=A Comparison Study of Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder |year=1998 |last1=Phillips |first1=Katharine A. |last2=Gunderson |first2=Craig G. |last3=Mallya |first3=Gopinath |last4=McElroy |first4=Susan L. |last5=Carter |first5=William |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=59 |issue=11 |pages=568–75 |pmid=9862601}}</ref>

==History==
The disorder was first documented in 1886 by the researcher Morselli, who dubbed the condition "'''dysmorphophobia'''". BDD was recognized by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in 1987 and was recorded and formally recognized as a disorder in 1987 in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III-R]]. It has since been changed from "'''dysmorphophobia'''" to "'''body dysmorphic disorder'''" because the original implies a phobia of people, not a reluctance to interact socially because of poor body image.

In his practice, [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] had a patient who would today be diagnosed with the disorder: [[Russia]]n [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] [[Sergei Pankejeff]] (nicknamed "The Wolf Man" by Freud himself in order to protect Pankejeff's identity), had a preoccupation with his nose to such an extent it greatly limited his functioning. It even came to the point where "The Wolf Man" wouldn't go out in public for fear of being scrutinized by others around him.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
