These glands are found within the outer one third to one half of the external auditory canal, more common along the posterior surface; therefore, the tumor develops within a very specific location.<ref name="Thompson">{{cite journal

== Signs and symptoms ==
Ceruminous adenoma are rare tumors, accounting for less than 1% of all external ear tumors. The patients will present with a mass, perhaps associated pain, and may have changes in hearing (usually a sensorineural or a conductive hearing loss). Some patients have tinnitus. Nerve paralysis is very uncommon.<ref name="Thompson"/>

== Pathology findings ==
[[File:Ear Ceruminous Adenoma H & E LDRT.tif|thumb|[[Hematoxylin and eosin]] stained slides shows a biphasic glandular proliferation with inner apocrine cells and basal myoepithelial cells, separated by fibrous connective tissue stroma.]]
The tumors are usually small, with a mean size of about 1.2&nbsp;cm.<ref name="Thompson"/>
The tumors are separated into three histologic types based on the dominant findings:
* Ceruminous adenoma<ref name="Thompson"/>
* Ceruminous pleomorphic adenoma<ref name="Thompson"/><ref name="Markou">{{cite journal

* Ceruminous syringocystadenoma papilliferum<ref name="Thompson"/>

All of the tumors are unencapsulated, but are usually well defined or circumscribed. The overlying surface epithelium is not involved. The tumor shows a dual or biphasic appearance, with glandular or cystic spaces showing inner luminal secretory cells with abundant granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm subtended by basal, [[myoepithelial cell]]s at the periphery, adjacent to the [[basement membrane]]. The luminal cells will often have decapitation ([[apocrine]]) secretions and will also have yellow-brown, ceroid, [[lipofuscin]]-like (cerumen) pigment granules. There is no pleomorphic, limited [[mitosis|mitoses]], and no [[necrosis]].<ref name="Thompson"/>

[[Immunohistochemistry]] can be performed to confirm the biphasic nature of the tumor. All cells are positive with [[pancytokeratin]] and [[epithelial membrane antigen]]; only the luminal [[cell (biology)|cell]]s are positive with [[Keratin 7|CK7]]; only the basal  cells are positive with [[CK5/6]], [[TP73L|p63]], [[S-100 protein|S100]] protein. [[CD117]] can be positive in either population. The cells are negative with [[chromogranin]], [[synaptophysin]] and [[Keratin 20|CK20]].<ref name="Thompson"/>

== Diagnosis ==
The major diagnosis from which to separate ceruminous adenoma is ceruminous adenocarcinoma, which shows an infiltrative growth, pleomorphism, mitoses, necrosis, and lacks ceroid pigment granules.<ref name="Crain">{{cite journal

==Management==
The tumors are usually removed in small pieces due to the anatomic confines of the area.<ref name="Thompson"/>

== Prognosis ==
Patients treated with complete surgical excision can expect an excellent long term outcome without any problems. Recurrences may be seen in tumors which are incompletely excised.<ref name="Thompson"/>

== Epidemiology ==
While there is a wide age range at clinical presentation (12–85 years), most patients come to clinical attention at 55 years (mean). There is no gender difference.<ref name="Thompson"/>
