== Definition ==
'''Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma''' is a systemic [[neoplasm]] comprising medium-sized cytotoxic [[T-cells]] that show a significant sinusoidal infiltration in the [[liver]], [[spleen]], and [[bone marrow]].<ref name="who1"/>

== Epidemiology ==
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}
This [[lymphoma]] is rare, comprising less than 5% of all cases, and is most common in young adults and adolescents. A distinct male gender preference has been described.<ref name="coo1">{{cite journal |author=Cooke CB, Krenacs L, Stetler-Stevenson M, ''et al.'' |title=Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: a distinct clinicopathologic entity of cytotoxic gamma delta T-cell origin |journal=Blood |volume=88 |issue=11 |pages=4265–74 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8943863 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8943863}}</ref>

== Clinical features ==

=== Etiology ===
The cell of origin for this disease is an immature cytotoxic [[T-cell]] clonally expressing the γδ [[T-cell receptor]]. This disease is seen more often in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients, an association that has led to the hypothesis that long-term immune stimulation in the setting of immunosuppression is the causative agent.

Cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with the immunosuppressant [[azathioprine]]. The majority occurred in patients with [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]]. Adolescents and young adult males were the major cohort of cases. They presented with a very aggressive disease course and, with one exception, died of the lymphoma. The FDA has required changes to the labeling to inform users and clinicians of the issue.<ref>FDA Warning concerning azathioprine and Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm258794.htm</ref>

=== Clinical Presentation ===
The typical [[clinical finding]] in a patient with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is [[hepatosplenomegaly]].<ref name="far1">{{cite journal |author=Farcet JP, Gaulard P, Marolleau JP, ''et al.'' |title=Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma: sinusal/sinusoidal localization of malignant cells expressing the T-cell receptor gamma delta |journal=Blood |volume=75 |issue=11 |pages=2213–9 |year=1990 |month=June |pmid=2140703 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2140703}}</ref>

=== Laboratory Findings ===
The constellation of [[thrombocytopenia]], [[anemia]], and [[leukocytosis]] is common in patients with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.<ref name="coo1"/> The discovery of neoplastic cells in peripheral blood is often a finding late in the clinical course.<ref name="who1"/>

=== Sites of Involvement ===
The [[spleen]] and [[liver]] are always involved, with [[bone marrow]] involvement frequently present. Nodal involvement is exceedingly rare.<ref name="who1">{{cite book |author=Elaine Sarkin Jaffe, Nancy Lee Harris, World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Harald Stein, J.W.

== Morphology ==
The neoplastic cells in this disorder show a monotonous appearance, with a small amount of [[cytoplasm]] and inconspicuous [[nucleoli]].<ref name="coo1"/>

=== Spleen and liver ===
This disease shows a distinct [[sinusoidal]] pattern of infiltration which spares the splenic [[white pulp]] and hepatic [[portal triads]].<ref name="who1"/>

=== Bone marrow ===
While the [[bone marrow]] is commonly involved, the detection of the neoplastic infiltrate may be difficult due to diffuse, interstitial pattern. [[Immunohistochemistry]] can aid in the detection of this [[lymphoma]].<ref name="who1"/>

=== Peripheral blood ===
Cells of a similar morphology observed in solid organs are observed in peripheral [[blood]].<ref name="who1"/>

== Molecular Findings ==

=== Immunophenotype ===
The immunophenotype for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is a post-thymic, immature [[T-cell]].<ref name="who1"/><ref name="coo1"/>

=== Genetic findings ===
Clonal rearrangement of the γ gene of the [[T-cell receptor]] is the hallmark of this disease. A few cases have shown rearrangement of the [[T-cell receptor]] β gene.<ref name="who1"/> [[Isochromosome]] 7q has been observed in all cases described so far, sometimes in conjunction with other [[chromosomal]] abnormalities such as [[trisomy]] 8.<ref name="alo1">{{cite journal |author=Alonsozana EL, Stamberg J, Kumar D, ''et al.'' |title=Isochromosome 7q: the primary cytogenetic abnormality in hepatosplenic gammadelta T cell lymphoma |journal=Leukemia |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=1367–72 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9264394 |doi= 10.1038/sj.leu.2400742|url=}}</ref>

=== Treatment ===
[[CHOP]] frequently induces remission initially, but most patients relapse and die within 2 years. [[Autologus bone marrow transplantion]] is currently being investigated in the treatment of hepatosplenic [[lymphoma]].  Allogeneic bone marrow transplant has been proven to attain remission for over five years and possibly cure hepatosplenic lymphoma.
