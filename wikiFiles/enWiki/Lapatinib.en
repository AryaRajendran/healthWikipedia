The drug lapatinib ditosylate is classified as S/NM (a synthetic compound
showing competitive inhibition of the natural product) that is naturally derived or inspired
substrate (Gordon M. Cragg, Paul G. Grothaus, and David J. Newman, Impact of Natural Products on Developing New Anti-Cancer Agents, Chem. Rev. 2009, 109, 3012–3043)

==Mode of action==
===Biochemistry===
Lapatinib [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] the [[tyrosine kinase]] activity associated with two [[oncogene]]s, [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]] (epidermal growth factor receptor) and [[HER2/neu]] (Human EGFR type 2).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = ER | last2 = Truesdale | first2 = AT | last3 = McDonald | first3 = OB | last4 = Yuan | first4 = D | last5 = Hassell | first5 = A | last6 = Dickerson | first6 = SH | last7 = Ellis | first7 = B | last8 = Pennisi | first8 = C | last9 = Horne | first9 = E | title = A unique structure for epidermal growth factor receptor bound to GW572016 (Lapatinib): relationships among protein conformation, inhibitor off-rate, and receptor activity in tumor cells. | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 64 | issue = 18 | pages = 6652–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15374980  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1168 }}</ref> Over expression of HER2/neu can be responsible for certain types of high-risk breast cancers in women.<ref name="futuredrugs">{{cite journal |author=Higa GM & Abraham J |year=2007 |month=September |title=Lapatinib in the treatment of breast cancer |journal=Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages= 1183–92 |publisher= Future Drugs |pmid=17892419 |doi=10.1586/14737140.7.9.1183 |url=http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14737140.7.9.1183 |format=log in required }}</ref> 
Like [[Sorafenib]], lapatinib is a [[protein kinase inhibitor]] shown to decrease tumor-causing breast [[cancer stem cells]].

Lapatinib inhibits receptor signal processes by binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR/HER2 protein [[kinase]] [[protein domain|domain]], preventing self-[[phosphorylation]] and subsequent activation of the signal mechanism (see [[Receptor tyrosine kinase#Signal transduction]]).<ref name="pmid16418322">{{cite journal |author=Nelson MH, Dolder CR |title=Lapatinib: a novel dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity in solid tumors |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=261–9 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16418322 |doi=10.1345/aph.1G387 }}</ref>

===Clinical application===

====Breast cancer====

Lapatinib is used as a treatment for women's breast cancer in treatment naive, ER+/EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer patients(now often called "triple positive") and in patients who have HER2-positive advanced breast cancer that has progressed after previous treatment with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as [[anthracycline]], [[taxane]]-derived drugs,  or [[trastuzumab]] (Herceptin, [[Genentech]]).

A 2006 GSK-supported randomized clinical trial on female breast cancer previously being treated with those agents (anthracycline, a taxane and trastuzumab) demonstrated that administrating lapatinib in combination with [[capecitabine]] delayed the time of further cancer growth compared to regimens that use capecitabine alone. The study also reported that risk of disease progression was reduced by 51%, and that the combination therapy was not associated with increases in toxic side effects.<ref name="NEJM +">{{cite journal |author=Geyer CE, Forster J, Lindquist D, ''et al.'' |title=Lapatinib plus capecitabine for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=355 |issue=26 |pages=2733–43 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17192538 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa064320 |url=}}</ref>  The outcome of this study resulted in a somewhat complex and rather specific initial [[indication (medicine)|indication]] for lapatinib—use only in [[combination therapy|combination]] with capecitabine for HER2-positive breast cancer in women whose cancer have progressed following previous chemotherapy with anthracycline, taxanes and trastuzumab.

==Adverse effects==
Like many small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lapatinib is regarded as well tolerated. The most common [[adverse effect|side effects]] reported are [[diarrhea]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]] and [[rash]]es.<ref name=futuredrugs /><ref name="pmid15955900">{{cite journal |author=Burris HA, Hurwitz HI, Dees EC, ''et al.'' |title=Phase I safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity study of lapatinib (GW572016), a reversible dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic carcinomas |journal=J.
