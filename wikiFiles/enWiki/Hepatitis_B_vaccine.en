'''Hepatitis B vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] developed for the prevention of [[hepatitis B|hepatitis B virus infection]]. The vaccine contains one of the viral envelope [[proteins]], hepatitis B surface antigen ([[HBsAg]]). It is produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBsAg has been inserted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/recombivax-drug.htm|title=Hepatitis B Vaccine from Merck|accessdate=2010-05-09}}</ref> A course of two to three (2-3) vaccine injections are given,  the second injection at least one month after the first dose and the third injection being administered six months after the first dose. The first and second dose offer complete protection. The final injection (second or third depending on number of vaccines being administered) is to prolong protection against the hepatitis B virus. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hepb.org/hepb/vaccine_information.htm|title=Hepatitis B Vaccine|date=2009-01-31|publisher=Hepatitis B Foundation|location=Doylestown, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-10-22}}</ref> Afterward an immune system [[antibody]] to HBsAg is established in the bloodstream. The antibody is known as ''anti-HBsAg''. This antibody and immune system memory then provide immunity to hepatitis B infection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/index.htm|title=CDC Viral Hepatitis|date=2009-07-24|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=2009-10-22}}</ref> The first vaccine became available in 1981.

A range of vaccines is available in the market. Presently recombinant DNA vaccines are available, which means they are produced by inserting the gene for HBV into common [[baker's yeast]] where it is grown, harvested, and purified. HBV infection cannot occur from receiving hepatitis B vaccine. The common brands available are Recombixax HB (Merck), Engerix-B (GSK), Elovac B (Human Biologicals Institute, a division of Indian Immunologicals Limited), Genevac B (Serum Institute), Shanvac B, etc. These vaccines are given intramuscularly.

==The invention==
The invention of the vaccine began with the realization (by virologist Alfred Prince, in 1968) that the [[Australia antigen]] was part of a virus that caused hepatitis B.<ref name="isbn0-12-782150-3">{{cite book |author=Howard, Colin; Zuckerman, Arie J. |title=Hepatitis viruses of man |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1979 |pages=16–18 |isbn=0-12-782150-3}}</ref> [[Maurice Hilleman]] at [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] used three treatments ([[pepsin]], [[urea]] and [[formaldehyde]]) of blood serum together with rigorous filtration to yield a product that could be used as a safe vaccine. Hilleman hypothesized that he could make an HBV vaccine by injecting patients with hepatitis B surface protein. In theory, this would be very safe, as these excess surface proteins lacked infectious viral DNA. The immune system, recognizing the surface proteins as foreign, would manufacture specially shaped antibodies, custom-made to bind to, and destroy, these proteins. Then, in the future, if the patient were infected with hepatitis B virus, the immune system could promptly deploy protective antibodies, destroying the viruses before they could do any harm.<ref name="PPAA">"World Hepatitis Day: The History of the Hepatitis B Vaccine" [Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona], 26 July 2012, http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/07/26/world-hepatitis-day-the-history-of-the-hepatitis-b-vaccine/</ref>

Hilleman collected blood from gay men and intravenous drug users — groups known to be at risk for HBV infections. This was in the late 1970s, when HIV was yet unknown to medicine. In addition to the sought-after hepatitis B surface proteins, the blood samples likely contained HIV. Hilleman devised a multistep process to purify this blood so that only the hepatitis B surface proteins remained. Every known virus was killed by this process, and Hilleman was confident that the vaccine was safe.<ref name="PPAA">"World Hepatitis Day: The History of the Hepatitis B Vaccine" [Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona], 26 July 2012, http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/07/26/world-hepatitis-day-the-history-of-the-hepatitis-b-vaccine/</ref>

The first large-scale trials for the blood-derived vaccine were performed on gay men, considered to be an at-risk group. Later, Hilleman’s vaccine was falsely blamed for igniting the AIDS epidemic. But, although the purified blood vaccine seemed questionable, it was determined to have indeed been free of HIV. The purification process had destroyed all viruses — including HIV.<ref name="PPAA">"World Hepatitis Day: The History of the Hepatitis B Vaccine" [Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona], 26 July 2012, http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/07/26/world-hepatitis-day-the-history-of-the-hepatitis-b-vaccine/</ref> The vaccine was approved in 1981.

It was withdrawn from the marketplace when [[Pablo DT Valenzuela]], Research Director of [[Chiron Corporation]] succeeded in 1986 in making the antigen in yeast and invented the first recombinant vaccine.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/13/business/biotechnology-spotlight-now-shines-on-chiron.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date= October 13, 1986 |title=Biotechnology Spotlight Now Shines On Chiron |first=Lawrence M. |last=Fisher }}</ref> The recombinant vaccine was developed by inserting the HBV gene that codes for the surface protein into a species of yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This allows the yeast to produce only the noninfectious surface protein, without any danger of introducing actual viral DNA into the final product.<ref name="PPAA">"World Hepatitis Day: The History of the Hepatitis B Vaccine" [Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona], 26 July 2012, http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/07/26/world-hepatitis-day-the-history-of-the-hepatitis-b-vaccine/</ref>  This is the vaccine still in use today.

==Recommended populations==
Babies born to mothers were vaccinated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and injected with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG).<ref name="pmid16371945">{{Cite pmid|16371945}}</ref>

Many countries now routinely vaccinate infants against hepatitis B. In countries with high rates of hepatitis B infection, vaccination of newborns has not only reduced the risk of infection, but has also led to marked reduction in [[liver cancer]]. This was reported in [[Taiwan]] where the implementation of a nationwide hepatitis B vaccination program in 1984 was associated with a decline in the incidence of childhood hepatocellular carcinoma.<ref name=Chang_1997>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJM199706263362602}}</ref> 

In many areas, vaccination against hepatitis B is also required for all health-care and laboratory staff.<ref name="isbn0113225288-c12">{{cite book|author=Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation|title=Immunisation Against Infectious Disease 2006 ("The Green Book")|edition=3rd|chapter=Chapter 12 Immunisation of healthcare and laboratory staff -- Hepatitis B|chapterurl=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthprotection/Immunisation/Greenbook/DH_4097254?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=115800&Rendition=Web|format=PDF|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Edinburgh|year=2006|pages=468|isbn=0-11-322528-8|oclc=|doi=}}</ref>

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] have issued recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis B among patients with [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name="pmid22189894">{{cite journal| author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)| title=Use of hepatitis B vaccination for adults with diabetes mellitus: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). | journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep | year= 2011 | volume= 60 | issue= 50 | pages= 1709–11 | pmid=22189894 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22189894  }} </ref>

==Response to vaccination==
Following the primary course of 3 vaccinations, a blood test may be taken after an interval of 1&ndash;4 months to establish if there has been an adequate response, which is defined as an [[Hepatitis B virus|anti-hepatitis B surface antigen]] (anti-Hbs) antibody level above 100 mIU/ml. Such a full response occurs in about 85-90% of individuals.<ref name="isbn0113225288 " />

An antibody level between 10 and 100 mIU/ml is considered a poor response, and these people should receive a single booster vaccination at this time, but do not need further retesting.<ref name="isbn0113225288 " />

People who fail to respond (anti-Hbs antibody level below 10 mIU/ml) should be tested to exclude current or past Hepatitis B infection, and given a repeat course of 3 vaccinations, followed by further retesting 1&ndash;4 months after the second course. Those who still do not respond to a second course of vaccination may respond to intradermal administration<ref>{{cite pmid|2148433}}</ref> or to a high dose vaccine <ref>{{Cite pmid|7759824}}</ref> or to a double dose of a combined Hepatitis A and B vaccine.<ref>{{Cite pmid|18544037}}</ref> Those who still fail to respond will require hepatitis B [[immunoglobulin]] (HBIG) if later exposed to the hepatitis B virus.<ref name="isbn0113225288" />

Poor responses are mostly associated with being over the age of 40 years, obesity and smoking,<ref name="pmid8254852">{{cite doi|10.1001/jama.270.24.2931}}</ref> and also in alcoholics, especially if with advanced liver disease.<ref name="pmid9316554">{{Cite doi|10.1016/S0002-9343(97)00132-0}}</ref> Patients who are immunosuppressed or on renal dialysis may respond less well and require larger or more frequent doses of vaccine.<ref name="isbn0113225288" /> At least one study suggests that hepatitis B vaccination is less effective in patients with HIV.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1186/1471-2334-6-65}}

Cold or Flu like symptoms can develop after receiving the vaccine, but these are short lived. As with any injection, the muscle can become tender around the injection point for some time afterwards</ref>

==Duration of protection==
It is now believed that the hepatitis B vaccine provides indefinite protection. However, it was previously believed and suggested that the vaccination would only provide effective cover of between five and seven years,<ref>{{Cite pmid|3660859}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1097/01.inf.0000130952.96259.fd}}</ref> but subsequently it has been appreciated that long-term immunity derives from [[immunological memory]] which outlasts the loss of antibody levels and hence subsequent testing and administration of booster doses is not required in successfully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals.<ref name="pmid17291637">{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.01.045}}</ref><ref name="pmid10683019">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(99)07239-6}}</ref> Hence with the passage of time and longer experience, protection has been shown for at least 25 years in those who showed an adequate initial response to the primary course of vaccinations,<ref name="pmid17298912">{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.tmaid.2006.04.004}}</ref> and UK guidelines now suggest that for initial responders who require ongoing protection, such as for healthcare workers, only a single booster is advocated at 5 years.<ref name="isbn0113225288 ">{{cite book|author=Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation|title=Immunisation Against Infectious Disease 2006 ("The Green Book")|edition=3rd edition (Chapter 18 revised 10 October 2007)|chapter=Chapter 18 Hepatitis B|chapterurl=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthprotection/Immunisation/Greenbook/DH_4097254?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=152019&Rendition=Web|format=PDF|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Edinburgh|year=2006|pages=468|isbn=0-11-322528-8}}</ref>

==Safety==
Several studies looked for a significant association between recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) and [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) in adults. Most published scientific studies do not support a causal relationship between hepatitis B vaccination and demyelinating diseases such as MS.<ref name=CDCFAQ>[http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccines/multiplesclerosis_and_hep_b.html FAQs about Hepatitis B Vaccine (Hep B) and Multiple Sclerosis], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]</ref> A 2004 study<ref>{{cite pmid|15365133}}</ref> reported a significant increase in risk within 3 years of vaccination. Some of these studies were criticized for methodological problems. This controversy created public misgivings about HB vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination in children remained low in several countries. A 2007 study found that the vaccination does not seem to increase the risk of a first episode of MS in childhood.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1001/archpedi.161.12.1176}}</ref>

A 2009 study of the hepatitis B vaccine and associated risk of CNS inflammatory [[demyelination]] was conducted.  The hepatitis B vaccine was found to be generally safe, however the Engerix B vaccine appeared to triple the risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination in infant boys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/10/873|title=Hepatitis B vaccine and the risk of CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood|year=2009|publisher=Neurology}}</ref>  There have been numerous reports that the Hepatitis B vaccine is linked to [[Chronic fatigue syndrome|Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]], a syndrome marked by severe fatigue, brain fogs, and muscle pains among other symptoms. <ref>{{cite web|last=Lanctot MD|first=Guylaine|title=Association of American Physicians&Surgeons Report|url=http://vran.org/vaccines/hepatitis/cfs.htm|work=Association of American Physicians&Surgeons Report|publisher=VRAN|accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref> 
The Engerix B vaccine contained [[Thiomersal]], a mercury containing vaccine preservative that is being phased out at the urging of the Public Health Service in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/safetyavailability/vaccinesafety/ucm096228.htm|title=Thiomersal in Vaccines|date=2010-03-31|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining vaccines against [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]] and [[Haemophilus influenzae|''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B]] with the vaccine against hepatitis B. There is not yet sufficient evidence on how effective this pentavalent vaccine is in relation to the individual vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bar-On ES, Goldberg E, Hellmann S, Leibovici L |title=Combined DTP-HBV-HIB vaccine versus separately administered DTP-HBV and HIB vaccines for primary prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae B (HIB) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD005530 |year=2012 |pmid=22513932 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005530.pub3}}</ref>
