'''Hepatitis B''' is an infectious inflammatory illness of the [[liver]] caused by the [[hepatitis B virus]] (HBV) that affects [[hominoidea]], including humans. Originally known as "serum hepatitis",<ref name="pmid8769597">{{Cite doi|10.1001/jama.276.10.841}}</ref> the disease has caused [[epidemic]]s in parts of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], and it is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in [[Hepatitis B in China|China]].<ref name="pmid16941687">{{Cite doi|10.1002/hep.21347}}</ref> About a third of the world population has been infected at one point in their lives,<ref name=WHOfactsheet>{{cite web|title=Hepatitis B|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> including 350&nbsp;million who are [[chronic (medicine)|chronic carriers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ about Hepatitis B|url=http://liver.stanford.edu/Education/faq.html|publisher=Stanford School of Medicine|date=2008-07-10|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref>

The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or [[body fluids]] such as semen and vaginal fluids, while viral DNA has been detected in the saliva, tears, and urine of chronic carriers.

==Signs and symptoms==
Acute infection with {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus is associated with acute viral [[hepatitis]] – an illness that begins with general ill-health, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, body aches, mild fever, and dark urine, and then progresses to development of [[jaundice]]. It has been noted that itchy skin has been an indication as a possible symptom of all hepatitis virus types. The illness lasts for a few weeks and then gradually improves in most affected people. A few people may have more severe liver disease ([[fulminant hepatic failure]]), and may die as a result. The infection may be entirely asymptomatic and may go unrecognized.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Terrault N, Roche B, Samuel D | title = Management of the hepatitis B virus in the liver transplantation setting: a European and an American perspective | journal = Liver Transpl. | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 716–32 | year = 2005 | month = July | pmid = 15973718 | doi = 10.1002/lt.20492 }}</ref>

Chronic infection with {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus either may be asymptomatic or may be associated with a chronic inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis), leading to [[cirrhosis]] over a period of several years. This type of infection dramatically increases the incidence of [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] (liver cancer). Chronic carriers are encouraged to avoid consuming alcohol as it increases their risk for [[cirrhosis]] and liver cancer. {{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} virus has been linked to the development of [[Membranous glomerulonephritis]] (MGN).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gan SI, Devlin SM, Scott-Douglas NW, Burak KW | title = Lamivudine for the treatment of membranous glomerulopathy secondary to chronic hepatitis B infection | journal = Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 625–9 | year = 2005 | month = October | pmid = 16247526 | doi =  }}</ref>

Symptoms outside of the liver are present in 1–10% of HBV-infected people and include [[serum-sickness–like syndrome]], [[acute necrotizing vasculitis]] ([[polyarteritis nodosa]]), [[membranous glomerulonephritis]], and [[papular acrodermatitis of childhood]] ([[Gianotti-Crosti syndrome]]).<ref name="pmid6126007">{{cite journal | author = Dienstag JL | title = Hepatitis B as an immune complex disease | journal = Seminars in Liver Disease | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–57 | year = 1981 | month = February | pmid = 6126007 | doi = 10.1055/s-2008-1063929 }}</ref><ref name="pmid11334492">{{cite journal | author = Trepo C, Guillevin L | title = Polyarteritis nodosa and extrahepatic manifestations of HBV infection: the case against autoimmune intervention in pathogenesis | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 269–74 | year = 2001 | month = May | pmid = 11334492 | doi = 10.1006/jaut.2000.0502 }}</ref> The [[serum-sickness–like syndrome]] occurs in the setting of acute {{nowrap|hepatitis B}}, often preceding the onset of [[jaundice]].<ref name="pmid4996611">{{cite journal | author = Alpert E, Isselbacher KJ, Schur PH | title = The pathogenesis of arthritis associated with viral hepatitis.

===Structure===
[[File:HBV.png|thumb|The structure of hepatitis B virus]]
[[File:HBV Genome.svg|thumb|The genome organisation of HBV. The genes overlap.]]
{{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} virus (HBV) is a member of the [[Hepadnaviridae|Hepadnavirus family]].<ref name=Baron>{{Cite book |author=Zuckerman AJ |chapter=Hepatitis Viruses |title=Baron's Medical Microbiology |editor=Baron S, ''et al.'' |edition=4th |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch |year=1996|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.3738|isbn=0-9631172-1-1 }}</ref> The virus particle, ([[virion]]) consists of an outer [[lipid]] envelope and an [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] [[nucleocapsid]] core composed of [[protein]]. These virions are 42&nbsp;nM in diameter. The nucleocapsid encloses the viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has [[reverse transcriptase]] activity.<ref name="pmid15192795">{{Cite doi|10.1055/s-2004-828672}}</ref> The outer envelope contains embedded proteins that are involved in viral binding of, and entry into, susceptible cells. The virus is one of the smallest enveloped animal viruses, but [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]] forms exist, including filamentous and spherical bodies lacking a core which are referred to as "Dane particles".<ref>{{cite book |author=Harrison T |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=455 |isbn=0-12-375146-2}}</ref> These particles are not infectious and are composed of the lipid and protein that forms part of the surface of the virion, which is called the surface antigen ([[HBsAg]]), and is produced in excess during the life cycle of the virus.<ref name="pmid3014045">{{Cite doi|10.1099/0022-1317-67-7-1215}}</ref>

===Genome===
The [[genome]] of HBV is made of circular [[DNA]], but it is unusual because the DNA is not fully [[Double helix|double-stranded]]. One end of the full length strand is linked to the viral [[DNA polymerase]]. The genome is 3020–3320 [[nucleotides]] long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand).<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.virusres.2007.02.021}}</ref> The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]. The viral DNA is found in the [[Nucleus (biology)|nucleus]] soon after infection of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a [[protein]] [[molecule]] from the (-) sense strand and a short sequence of [[RNA]] from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (-) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start [[codon]] is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by [[Proteolysis|proteolytic]] processing of the pre-core protein. The DNA [[polymerase]] is encoded by gene P. Gene S is the gene that codes for the surface [[antigen]] (HBsAg). The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame "start" (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, [[polypeptide]]s of three different sizes called large, middle, and small (pre-S1 + pre-S2 + S, pre-S2 + S, or S) are produced.<ref name="pmid17206754">{{Cite pmid|17206754}}</ref> The function of the protein coded for by gene X is not fully understood but it is associated with the development of liver cancer.

===Replication===
[[File:HBV replication.png|thumb|Hepatitis B virus replication]]
The life cycle of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus is complex. {{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} is one of a few known [[pararetrovirus]]es: non-[[retrovirus]]es that still use [[reverse transcription]] in their replication process. The virus gains entry into the cell by binding to [[SLC10A1|NTCP]] <ref name="pmid23150796">{{Cite pmid|23150796}}</ref> on the surface and being [[endocytosis|endocytosed]]. Because the virus multiplies via RNA made by a host enzyme, the viral genomic DNA has to be transferred to the cell nucleus by host proteins called chaperones. The partially double stranded viral DNA is then made fully double stranded and transformed into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that serves as a template for transcription of four viral [[mRNA]]s. The largest mRNA, (which is longer than the viral genome), is used to make the new copies of the genome and to make the [[capsid]] core protein and the viral [[DNA polymerase]]. These four viral transcripts undergo additional processing and go on to form progeny virions that are released from the cell or returned to the nucleus and re-cycled to produce even more copies.<ref name="pmid17206754" /><ref name="pmid17206755">{{Cite pmid|17206755}}</ref> The long mRNA is then transported back to the cytoplasm where the virion P protein (the DNA polymerase) synthesizes DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity.

===Serotypes and genotypes===
The virus is divided into four major [[serotype]]s (adr, adw, ayr, ayw) based on antigenic [[epitope]]s presented on its envelope proteins, and into eight genotypes (A-H) according to overall nucleotide sequence variation of the genome. The genotypes have a distinct geographical distribution and are used in tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus. Differences between genotypes affect the disease severity, course and likelihood of complications, and response to treatment and possibly vaccination.<ref name="pmid15752827">{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.10.045}}</ref><ref name="pmid8666521">{{Cite pmid|8666521}}</ref>

Genotypes differ by at least 8% of their sequence and were first reported in 1988 when six were initially described (A-F).<ref name="Norder1994">{{cite journal | author = Norder H, Courouce AM, Magnius LO | title = Complete genomes, phylogenic relatedness and structural proteins of six strains of the hepatitis B virus, four of which represent two new genotypes | journal = Virology | volume = 198 | issue = 2 | pages = 489–503 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8291231 | doi = 10.1006/viro.1994.1060 }}</ref> Two further types have since been described (G and H).<ref name="pmid15779062">{{cite journal | author = Shibayama T, Masuda G, Ajisawa A, Hiruma K, Tsuda F, Nishizawa T, Takahashi M, Okamoto H | title = Characterization of seven genotypes (A to E, G and H) of hepatitis B virus recovered from Japanese patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 | journal = Journal of Medical Virology | volume = 76 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–32 | year = 2005 | month = May | pmid = 15779062 | doi = 10.1002/jmv.20319 }}</ref> Most genotypes are now divided into subgenotypes with distinct properties.<ref name="pmid17206751">{{cite journal | author = Schaefer S | title = Hepatitis B virus taxonomy and hepatitis B virus genotypes | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology : WJG | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–21 | year = 2007 | month = January | pmid = 17206751 | doi =  | url = http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/13/14.asp }}</ref>

==Mechanisms==

===Pathogenesis===
{{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} virus primarily interferes with the functions of the liver by replicating in liver cells, known as [[hepatocytes]]. A functional [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] is [[SLC10A1|NTCP]].<ref name="pmid23150796"/> There is evidence that the receptor in the closely related [[duck hepatitis B virus]] is [[carboxypeptidase D]].<ref name="pmid10482623">{{Cite pmid|10482623}}</ref><ref name="pmid17206752">{{Cite pmid|17206752}}</ref> The virions bind to the host cell via the preS domain of the viral surface antigen and are subsequently internalized by endocytosis. HBV-preS-specific receptors are expressed primarily on hepatocytes; however, viral DNA and proteins have also been detected in extrahepatic sites, suggesting that cellular receptors for HBV may also exist on extrahepatic cells.<ref name="pmid21462295">{{cite journal | author = Coffin CS, Mulrooney-Cousins PM, van Marle G, Roberts JP, Michalak TI, Terrault NA | title = Hepatitis B virus (HBV) quasispecies in hepatic and extrahepatic viral reservoirs in liver transplant recipients on prophylactic therapy | journal = Liver Transpl | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 955–62 | year = 2011 | month = April | pmid = 21462295 | doi = 10.1002/lt.22312 }}</ref>

During HBV infection, the host [[immune response]] causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does not play a significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]](CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral [[cytokine]]s, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes.<ref name="Iannacone 2007">{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.jhep.2007.01.007}}</ref> Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, [[antigen]]-nonspecific [[inflammatory cell]]s can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and [[platelets]] activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.<ref name=Iannacone_2005>{{Cite doi|10.1038/nm1317}}</ref>

===Transmission===
Transmission of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids containing blood. Possible forms of transmission include [[sexual intercourse|sexual contact]],<ref name="pmid22143117">{{cite journal |author=Fairley CK, Read TR |title=Vaccination against sexually transmitted infections |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=66–72 |year=2012 |month=February |pmid=22143117 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834e9aeb}}</ref> [[blood transfusion]]s and transfusion with other human blood products,<ref name="pmid18831300">{{cite journal |author=Buddeberg F, Schimmer BB, Spahn DR |title=Transfusion-transmissible infections and transfusion-related immunomodulation |journal=Best Practice & Research.

Without intervention, a mother who is positive for HBsAg confers a 20% risk of passing the infection to her offspring at the time of birth.

HBV can be transmitted between family members within households, possibly by contact of nonintact skin or mucous membrane with secretions or saliva containing HBV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hepatitis B – the facts: IDEAS –Victorian Government Health Information, Australia|url=http://ideas.health.vic.gov.au/diseases/hepatitis-b.asp|publisher=State of Victoria|date=2009-07-28|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> However, at least 30% of reported {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} among adults cannot be associated with an identifiable risk factor.<ref name="pmid8392167">{{Cite pmid|8392167}}</ref> And Shi ''et al.'' showed that breastfeeding after proper immunoprophylaxis did not contribute to MTCT of HBV.<ref name="pmid21536948">{{Cite pmid|21536948}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=HBV serum markers.png|image2=Chronic HBV v2.png|caption1=Hepatitis B viral antigens and antibodies detectable in the blood following acute infection.|caption2=Hepatitis B viral antigens and antibodies detectable in the blood of a chronically infected person.}}
The tests, called [[assay]]s, for detection of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus infection involve [[blood plasma|serum]] or [[blood test]]s that detect either viral antigens (proteins produced by the virus) or [[antibody|antibodies]] produced by the host. Interpretation of these assays is complex.<ref name="pmid3331068">{{Cite pmid|3331068}}</ref>

The {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen (''HBsAg'') is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. The infectious virion contains an inner "core particle" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} core antigen, or ''HBcAg''. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, [[IgM]] antibodies to the {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} core antigen (''anti-HBc IgM'') may be the only serological evidence of disease.  Therefore most {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} diagnostic panels contain HBsAg and total anti-HBc (both IgM and IgG).<ref name="isbn0-12-375147-0">{{cite book |author=Karayiannis P, Thomas HC |editors= Mahy BWJ, van Regenmortel MHV|title=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=110 |isbn=0-12-375147-0}}</ref>

Shortly after the appearance of the HBsAg, another antigen called {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} e antigen (''HBeAg'') will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity; however, variants of the {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus do not produce the 'e' antigen, so this rule does not always hold true. During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (''anti-HBe'') will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication.

If the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by [[IgG]] antibodies to the {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen and core antigen, (''anti-HBs'' and ''anti HBc IgG'').<ref name=Baron /> The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the [[window period]]. A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs either has cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously.

Individuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} carriers.<ref name="pmid17256718">{{Cite doi|10.1002/hep.21513}}</ref> Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy. Carriers who have seroconverted to HBeAg negative status, in particular those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.<ref name="pmid17935720">{{Cite doi|10.1053/j.gastro.2007.08.039}}</ref>

==Prevention==
{{Main|Hepatitis B vaccine}}
Several [[vaccines]] have been developed for the prevention of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus infection. These rely on the use of one of the viral envelope proteins ({{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen or HBsAg). The vaccine was originally prepared from plasma obtained from people who had long-standing {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} virus infection. However, it is made using a synthetic [[recombinant DNA]] technology that does not contain blood products. One cannot be infected with {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} from this vaccine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hepb.org/professionals/hepatitis_b_vaccine.htm|title=Hepatitis B Vaccine|date=2009-01-31|publisher=Hepatitis B Foundation|location=Doylestown, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref>

The risk of transmission from mother to newborn can be reduced from 20–90% to 5–10% by administering to the newborn {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} vaccine (HBV 1) and {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} immune globulin (HBIG) within 12&nbsp;hours of birth, followed by a second dose of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} vaccine (HBV 2) at 1–2&nbsp;months and a third dose at and no earlier than 6&nbsp;months (24&nbsp;weeks). Since 2% of infants vaccinated will not develop immunity after the first three dose series, infants born to {{nowrap|hepatitis B}}-positive mothers are tested at 9&nbsp;months for {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen (HBsAg) and the antibody to the {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen (anti-HBs). If post-vaccination test results indicate that the child is still susceptible, a second three dose series at (0, 1 and 6 months) is administered. If the child is still susceptible after the second series, a third series is not recommended.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  | title = Hepatitis B virus: a comprehensive strategy for eliminating transmission in the United States through universal childhood vaccination.

Unlike [[hepatitis A]], {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} does not generally spread through water and food. Instead, it is transmitted through body fluids; thus, prevention is the avoidance of such transmission: unprotected sexual contact, blood transfusions, re-use of contaminated needles and syringes, and vertical transmission during child birth. Infants may be vaccinated at birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art17089.html|title=Hepatitis B Prevention – The Body|accessdate=2009-01-30|last=O'Connor|first=John|date=2008-10-03|publisher=Body Health Resources Corporation}}</ref>

Although none of the available drugs can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2008, there are seven medications licensed for treatment of {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} infection in the United States. These include [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] drugs [[lamivudine]] (Epivir), [[adefovir]] (Hepsera), [[tenofovir]] (Viread), [[telbivudine]] (Tyzeka) and [[entecavir]] (Baraclude), and the two [[immune system]] modulators [[Interferon|interferon alpha-2a]] and [[Peginterferon alfa-2a|PEGylated interferon alpha-2a]] (Pegasys). The use of interferon, which requires injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting [[PEGylation|PEGylated]] [[interferon]], which is injected only once weekly.<ref name=" Dienstag"/> However, some individuals are much more likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the [[genotype]] of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the [[viral load]] (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood).<ref name="pmid12000599">{{vcite journal | author = Pramoolsinsup C | title = Management of viral hepatitis B | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume = 17 | issue =Suppl | pages = S125–45 | year = 2002 | month = February | pmid = 12000599 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0815-9319&date=2002&volume=17&issue=&spage=S125 | doi=10.1046/j.1440-1746.17.s1.3.x}}</ref> Response to treatment differs between the genotypes.

==Prognosis==
{{nowrap|Hepatitis B}} virus infection may be either acute (self-limiting) or chronic (long-standing). Persons with self-limiting infection clear the infection spontaneously within weeks to months.

Children are less likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become infected as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bell SJ, Nguyen T | title = The management of hepatitis B | journal = Aust Prescr | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 99–104 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | doi =  | url = http://www.australianprescriber.com/upload/pdf/articles/1035.pdf }}</ref> This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from [[cirrhosis]] or [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].<ref name="Dienstag">{{Cite doi|10.1056/NEJMra0801644}}</ref> Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.<ref name="pmid16176431">{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00393.x}}</ref>

[[Hepatitis D]] (HDV) can occur only with a concomitant {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} infection, because HDV uses the HBV surface antigen to form a [[capsid]].<ref name="pmid16364738">{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.virol.2005.09.033}}</ref> Co-infection with hepatitis D increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.<ref name="pmid1661197">{{Cite pmid|1661197}}</ref> ''[[Polyarteritis nodosa]]'' is more common in people with {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} infection.

After several weeks, and up to eight months later, 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with [[jaundice]] and were diagnosed as suffering from serum hepatitis. Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy. Lurman's paper, now regarded as a classical example of an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] study, proved that contaminated lymph was the source of the outbreak. Later, numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction, in 1909, of [[hypodermic needles]] that were used, and, more importantly, reused, for administering [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]] for the treatment of [[syphilis]]. The virus was not discovered until 1965 when [[Baruch Blumberg]], then working at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), discovered the [[Australia antigen]] (later known to be {{nowrap|hepatitis B}} surface antigen, or HBsAg) in the blood of Australian aboriginal people.<ref name="pmid5930797">{{Cite pmid|5930797}}</ref> Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by MacCallum in 1947,<ref>{{cite journal | author = MacCallum FO | title = Homologous serum hepatitis | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages =  | year = 1947 | pmid =  | doi =  }}</ref> D.S.
