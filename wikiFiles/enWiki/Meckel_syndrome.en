'''Meckel syndrome''' (also known as '''Meckel–Gruber Syndrome''', '''Gruber Syndrome''', '''Dysencephalia Splanchnocystica''') is a rare, [[wiktionary:lethal|lethal]], [[ciliopathy|ciliopathic]], [[genetic disorder]], characterized by [[kidney|renal]] cystic [[dysplasia]], [[central nervous system]] malformations(occipital encephalocele), [[polydactyly]] (post axial)], [[liver|hepatic]] developmental defects, and [[pulmonary hypoplasia]] due to [[oligohydramnios]].

Meckel–Gruber syndrome is named for [[Johann Meckel]] and Georg Gruber.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2055}}</ref><ref>J. F. Meckel.

==Diagnosis==
Dysplastic kidneys are [[prevalence|prevalent]] in 95% to 100% of all identified cases. When this occurs, [[microscopic]] [[cyst]]s develop within the kidney and slowly destroy it, causing it to [[enlarge]] to 10 to 20 times its original size. The level of [[amniotic fluid]] within the womb may be significantly altered or remain normal, and a normal level of fluid should not be criteria for exclusion of diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[Occiput|Occipital]] [[encephalocele]] is present in 60% to 80% of all cases, and [[post-axial]] [[polydactyly]] is present in 55% to 75% of the total number of identified cases. [[Bowing]] or [[shortening]] of the limbs are also common.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Finding at least two of the three features of the classical triad, in the presence of normal [[karyotype]], makes the diagnosis solid. Regular [[ultrasound]]s and pro-active prenatal care can usually detect [[symptom]]s early on in a [[pregnancy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|This condition is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern, meaning two copies of the gene in each cell are altered]]

Meckel–Gruber syndrome (MKS) is an autosomal recessive lethal malformation. Recently, two MKS [[gene]]s, [[MKS1]] and [[MKS3]], have been identified. A study done recently has described the [[Cell (biology)|cellular]], [[Cell (biology)|sub-cellular]] and functional characterization of the novel [[protein]]s, [[MKS1]] and [[meckelin]], encoded by these genes.<ref name=dawe07>{{cite journal | last=Dawe | first=H.R. | coauthors=Smith, U.M., Cullinane, A.R., Gerrelli, D., Cox, P., Badano, J.L., Blair-Reid, S., Sriram, N., Katsanis, N., Attie-Bitach, T., Afford, S.C., Copp, A.J., Kelly, D.A., Gull, K. and Johnson, C.A. | year=2007 | title=The Meckel–Gruber Syndrome proteins MKS1 and meckelin interact and are required for primary cilium formation | journal=Human Molecular Genetics | volume=16 | pages=173–186 | doi=10.1093/hmg/ddl459 | url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/16/2/173?rss=1 | pmid=17185389 | issue=2 }}</ref> The malfunction of this protein production is mainly responsible for this lethal disorder.

=== Relation to other rare genetic disorders ===

Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related, may be, in fact, highly related in the [[genotype|genetypical]] root cause of the widely-varying, [[phenotype|phenotypically]]-observed [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]].  Thus, Meckel–Gruber syndrome is a [[ciliopathy]].  Other known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet–Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney]] and [[polycystic liver disease|liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alstrom syndrome]], and some forms of [[retinopathy|retinal degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal

==Incidence==
While not precisely known, it is estimated that the general rate of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], according to Bergsma,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bergsma |first=D. |year=1979 |chapter=Birth Defects |title=Atlas and Compendium |publisher=Macmillan Press |location=London }}</ref> for Meckel syndrome is 0.02 per 10,000 births. According to another study done six years later, the incidence rate could vary from 0.07 to 0.7 per 10,000 births.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Salonen |first=R. |last2=Norio |first2=R. |last3=Reynolds |year=1984 |first3=James F. |title=The Meckel syndrome: Clinicopathological Findings in 67 Patients |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=18 |pmid=6486167 |issue=4 |pages=671–689 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320180414 }}</ref> 

This syndrome is a [[Finnish heritage disease]].  Its frequency is much higher in [[Finland]], where the incidence is as high as 1.1 per 10,000 births. It is estimated that Meckel syndrome accounts for 5% of all [[neural tube defect]]s there.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nyberg |first=D.
