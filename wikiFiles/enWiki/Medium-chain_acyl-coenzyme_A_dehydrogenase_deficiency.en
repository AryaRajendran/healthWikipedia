'''Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency''', often known as '''MCAD deficiency''' or '''MCADD''' is a disorder of [[fatty acid oxidation]] that impairs the body's ability to break down medium-chain [[fatty acids]] into [[acetyl-CoA]].  The disorder is characterized by [[hypoglycemia]] and sudden death without timely intervention, most often brought on by periods of fasting or vomiting.  Prior to expanded [[newborn screening]], MCADD was an underdiagnosed cause of sudden death in infants. Individuals who have been identified prior to the onset of symptoms have an excellent [[prognosis]].  It is most prevalent in individuals of Northern European Caucasian descent, with an incidence of 1:4000 to 1:17,000 depending on the population.  Treatment of MCADD is mainly preventative, by avoiding fasting and other situations where the body relies on fatty acid oxidation to supply energy.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:BetaOxidationSpiral.tiff|thumb| MCAD is one of the enzymes responsible for dehydrogenation of fatty acids as they cycle through the beta-oxidation spiral.]]
MCADD presents in early childhood with hypoketotic [[hypoglycemia]] and liver dysfunction, often preceded by extended periods of fasting or an infection with vomiting.  Infants who are exclusively [[breastfeeding|breast-fed]] may present in this manner shortly after birth, due to poor feeding.  In some individuals the first manifestation of MCADD may be sudden death following a minor illness.<ref name=saudubray>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Andrew A.M. |last2=Spiekerkoetter |first2=Ute |editor1-first=Jean-Marie |editor1-last=Saudubray |editor2-first=Georges |editor2-last=van den Berghe |editor3-first=John H. |editor3-last=Walter |others= |title=Inborn Metabolic Diseases:  Diagnosis and Treatment |edition=5th |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn= 978-3-642-15719-6 | pages=201â€“216 |chapter=Disorders of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation and Related Metabolic Pathways}}</ref>  A number of individuals with MCADD may remain completely asymptomatic, provided they never encounter a situation that sufficiently stresses their metabolism.<ref name=saudubray /><ref name=genereviews />  With the advent of expanded newborn screening, some mothers have been identified with MCADD after their infants had positive newborn screens for low carnitine levels.<ref name=maternal>{{cite pmid|21354840}}</ref>

The enzyme MCAD is responsible for the dehydrogenation step of fatty acids with chain lengths between 6 and 12 carbons as they undergo [[beta-oxidation]] in the [[mitochondria]].  Fatty acid beta-oxidation provides energy after the body has used up its stores of [[glucose]] and [[glycogen]].  This typically occurs during periods of extended fasting or illness when caloric intake is reduced, and energy needs are increased.  Beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids produces two carbon units,  [[acetyl-CoA]] and the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 enter the electron transport chain and are used to make ATP.  Acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs Cycle and is also used to make ATP via the electron transport chain and substrate level phosphorylation.  When the supply of acetyl-CoA (coming from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids) exceeds the capacity of the Krebs Cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA, the excess acetyl-CoA molecules are converted to ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate) by HMG-CoA synthase in the liver. Ketone bodies can also be used for energy especially by the brain and heart; in fact they become the main sources of energy for those two organs after day three of starvation. <ref name=fao />

==Diagnosis==
Clinically, MCADD or another fatty acid oxidation disorder is suspected in individuals who present with [[lethargy]], [[seizures]], [[coma]] and hypoketotic [[hypoglycemia]], particularly if triggered by a minor illness.  MCADD can also present with acute liver disease and [[hepatomegaly]], which can lead to a misdiagnosis of [[Reye syndrome]].  In some individuals, the only manifestation of MCADD is sudden, unexplained death often preceded by a minor illness that would not usually be fatal.<ref name=genereviews />

[[File:MCADD Acylcarnitine Profile.tif|thumb|Acylcarnitine profile of an individual with MCADD, showing characteristic elevation of octanoylcarnitine (C8).]]In areas with expanded newborn screening using [[tandem mass spectrometry]] (MS/MS), MCADD is usually detected shortly after birth, by the analysis of blood spots collected on filter paper. Acylcarnitine profiles with MS/MS will show a very characteristic pattern of elevated hexanoylcarnitine (C6), octanoylcarnitine (C8), decanoylcarnitine (C10) or decenoylcarnitine (C10:1), with C8 being greater than C6 and C10.  Secondary [[carnitine]] deficiency is sometimes seen with MCADD, and in these cases, acylcarnitine profiles may not be informative.<ref name=genereviews />  Urine organic acid analysis by [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) will show a pattern of dicarboxylic aciduria with low levels of [[ketone]]s. Traces of acylglycine species may also be detected.  Asymptomatic individuals may have normal biochemical lab results. For these individuals, targeted analysis of acylglycine species by GC-MS, specifically hexanoylglycine and suberylglycine can be diagnostic.<ref name=genereviews /><ref name=ags>{{cite pmid|3054550}}</ref>  After biochemical suspicion of MCADD, [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] analysis of ''ACADM'' can be used to confirm the diagnosis.<ref name=acmgalgorithm>{{cite web|title=C8 Elevated + Lesser Elevations of C6 and C10|url=http://www.acmg.net/StaticContent/ACT/Algorithms/Visio-C8.vsd;_C6-C10.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2012-06-09|publisher=American College of Medical Genetics}}</ref>  The analysis of MCAD activity in cultured [[fibroblasts]] can also be used for diagnosis.<ref name=genereviews />

In cases of sudden death where the preceding illness would not usually have been fatal, MCADD is often suspected.   The [[autopsy]] will often show fatty deposits in the liver.  In cases where MCADD is suspected, acylcarnitine analysis of [[bile]] and [[blood]] can be undertaken postmortem for diagnosis.  Where samples are not available, residual blood from newborn screening may be helpful.  Biochemical testing of asymptomatic siblings and parents may also be informative.<ref name=fao>{{cite pmid|11826276}}</ref>  MCADD and other fatty acid oxidation disorders have been recognized in recent years as undiagnosed causes of [[sudden infant death syndrome]].<ref name=nejmsids>{{cite pmid|1635678}}</ref><ref name=faosids>{{cite pmid|10388343}}</ref>

==Genetics==
MCADD is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] manner, meaning an affected individual must inherit a mutated [[allele]] from both of their parents.  ''[[ACADM]]'' is the [[gene]] involved, located at 1p31, with 12 [[exon]]s and coding for a protein of 421 [[amino acid]]s.<ref name=genereviews>{{cite pmid|20301597}}</ref>  There is a common mutation among Northern European Caucasians, 985A>G, which results in a [[lysine]] being replaced by a [[glutamic acid]] at position 304 of the protein.  Other mutations have been identified more commonly since newborn screening has expanded the mutation spectrum.<ref name=genereviews />  The 985A>G common mutation is present in the [[homozygous]] state in 80% of Caucasian individuals who presented clinically with MCADD and in 60% of the population identified by screening.<ref name=saudubray />

An individual's [[genotype]] does not correlate well with their clinical [[phenotype]] for MCADD.  The clinical presentation of an individual with MCADD depends not only on the presence of the mutations in the ''ACADM'' gene, but also on the presence of environmental or physiological stressors that require the body to depend on fatty acid oxidation for energy.  Some mutations, identified through newborn screening programs and associated with higher residual enzyme activity have not been seen in individuals with clinical symptoms of MCADD.  Despite this, treatment with fasting avoidance remains the norm for all those diagnosed with MCADD.<ref name=saudubray />

==Treatment==
As with most other fatty acid oxidation disorders, individuals with MCADD need to avoid fasting for prolonged periods of time.  During illnesses, they require careful management to stave off metabolic decompensation, which can result in death.<ref name=saudubray />  Supplementation of simple carbohydrates or glucose during illness is key to prevent [[catabolism]].<ref name=genereviews />  The duration of fasting for individuals with MCADD varies with age, infants typically require frequent feedings or a slow release source of carbohydrates, such as uncooked [[cornstarch]]. Illnesses and other stresses can significantly reduce the fasting tolerance of affected individuals.<ref name=fasting>{{cite pmid|19255872}}</ref>  Individuals with MCADD should have an "emergency letter" that allows medical staff who are unfamiliar with the patient and the condition to administer correct treatment properly in the event of acute decompensation.  This letter should outline the steps needed to intervene in a crisis and have contact information for specialists familiar with the individual's care.<ref name=genereviews />

==Incidence==
MCADD is most prevalent in individuals of Northern European Caucasian descent.  The incidence in Northern [[Germany]] is 1:4000, currently the highest in the world.  Northern Europe is also the origin of the common mutation in MCADD.  For populations without origins in Northern Europe, the incidence is significantly lower, 1:51,000 in [[Japan]] and 1:700,000 in [[Taiwan]].  The common mutation has not been identified in MCADD cases identified in Asian populations.<ref name=genereviews />
