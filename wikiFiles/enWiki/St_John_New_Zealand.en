==== Ambulance communication centres ====

St John owns and runs the Ambulance Communication Centres in Auckland and Christchurch. The Wellington Ambulance Communication Centre is run in a joint venture with [[Wellington Free Ambulance]]. Dispatchers at the centres have medical knowledge and are trained to despatch and coordinate all land, water and air ambulance services.

=== First aid ===
In addition to ambulance services, St John provide first aid training courses, kits and supplies, [[automated external defibrillator|automated external defibrillators (AEDs)]] and first aid smartphone applications.

St John offers various levels of first aid training ranging from basic training courses for the general public, to courses which help businesses meet the requirements of the Health and Safety in Employment Act, to advanced resuscitation training for health professionals. St John also offers specialised courses such as child, sports, electrical workers, outdoor and maritime first aid training.

St John is registered with the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]](NZQA). The organisation is also a member of the NZ Resuscitation Council (NZRC) and the Association of Emergency Care Training Providers (AECTP). 

Organisations can purchase [[Automated external defibrillator|AEDs]] from St John and learn how to use them. St John also sells first aid kids and supplies for home or business use.

=== Youth programmes ===
[[St John Youth New Zealand|St John Youth]] programmes help young New Zealanders to develop first aid, health care, leadership and life skills. Penguins are aged 6 to 8, Cadets are aged 8 to 18. These programmes are fully funded by donations.

=== Community programmes ===
St John provides health shuttles, [[St John Youth New Zealand|youth programmes]], hospital friends, phone friends and [[Pet therapy|pet outreach therapy]] to help people live independently, get the social connections they need and improve their wellbeing. These services are run primarily by volunteers and are often free of charge.

==== Health Shuttles ====
The Health Shuttle is a free community service that transports people to essential appointments.

==== Caring Caller ====
St John’s free Caring Caller service connects people who need a friend with people who have time to listen and chat.

==== Friends of the Emergency Department/Hospital Friends ====
St John Friends of the Emergency Department (FED) and Hospital Friends volunteers provide comfort and support to hospital patients.

==== St John Safe Kids ====
The St John Safe Kids programme gives children an understanding of emergencies, as well as how and when to call an ambulance.

==== Partnered programmes ====
St John partners with other organisations to provide Healthline (a free 24x7 health advice helpline), Outreach Therapy Pets and PRIME (a programme that uses the skills of specially-trained rural GPs and/or rural nurses to support the St John Ambulance Service during medical emergencies in remote areas).

=== Event medical services ===
St John provides medical services for a number of events of all sizes, from international sports matches to community fairs. In the year ending 30 June 2012, St John attended 8,945 events.

=== St John medical alarms ===
The St John [[Medical alarm|Medical Alarm]] service is designed to help people live independently for longer. The alarm is a pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist. If the person has an accident or feels unwell or at risk they can press the emergency button on the alarm. St John immediately calls the person, speaking through a loudspeaker in the alarm’s base unit. If the person does not answer, an ambulance is dispatched.

== Volunteers ==
St John is a charitable organisation which relies on its volunteer workforce to deliver health services to the New Zealand population. Volunteers outnumber paid employees by around three to one. In 2012, St John 8,591 people volunteered for St John and the organisation had 2,481 paid staff. If the St John volunteer contribution was valued at normal commercial rates it would equate to $30 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=St John Annual Report|year=2012}}</ref> St John volunteers receive specialised training and clinical education.

== Funding ==
[[File:St John ambulance Dunedin.jpg|thumb|right|234px|St John ambulance travelling with lights and siren (Priority 1) in [[Dunedin]].]]<!-- this image is aligned to infobox width - please change if infobox width is changed -->

Contracts with the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]], [[Accident Compensation Corporation|ACC]] and [[District Health Boards (New Zealand)|District Health Boards]] fund just under 80% of the direct operating costs of the St John ambulance service.<ref>{{cite book|title=St John Annual Report|year=2012}}</ref> 

The difference is made up from community and corporate donations, fundraising, revenue from commercial activities (first aid kits, first aid training, medical alarms and defibrillators), as well as income from emergency ambulance part charges.

These activities also fund the delivery of non-ambulance services such as the St John Youth programmes, Friends of the Emergency Department, Hospital Friends, Caring Caller, St John Safe Kids and Outreach Therapy Pets.

=== ASB partnership ===
In 2008, St John and [[ASB Bank]] initiated a partnership. The partnership helps to expand support for St John services and deliver programmes like [[CPR]] training on a wide scale. At the same time, the partnership gives ASB the opportunity to strengthen connections with local communities and give their employees the opportunity to get involved with community services by volunteering for St John.

The partnership was launched with ASB providing the opportunity for 1,000 school children at 10 schools to learn the lifesaving resuscitation skill CPR for free.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local gym staff all heart, says Ken|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/593382|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=Waikato Times|date=22 August 2008}}</ref>

== The Order of St John ==
St John in New Zealand has global links to the international [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]]. [[Her Majesty the Queen]] is Sovereign Head of the Order and the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] is the head or [[Prior]] of St John in New Zealand. 

In 1888, in recognition of its work, [[Queen Victoria]] made the Order of St John a [[Order of chivalry|Royal Order of Chivalry]]. In New Zealand, [[Order (honour)|Royal Honours]] continue to be awarded to members for outstanding contributions and commitment to care for their communities. These Royal Honours are an independent part of the [[New Zealand Honours System]]. Honours are conferred annually at St John [[Investiture|investiture services]].

== History ==
A branch of the [[St. John Ambulance|St John Ambulance]] was first founded in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, in 1885. Further branches quickly spread across the country providing first aid and patient transport and in 1946, due to the efforts of St John in New Zealand during the [[Second World War]], the organisation was elevated to a full [[Priory]], with the Governor-General of New Zealand as the Prior.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Graeme|title=First to Care|year=2009|publisher=Libro International|location=Auckland|isbn=978-1-877514-03-6|pages=30; 147}}</ref> 

During the 1970s and 1980s much restructuring took place in response to changing social and economic conditions, moving away from the traditional militaristic structure and resulting in the current modern organisation.

Today, St John New Zealand is a major health service provider in New Zealand. They provide 90% of the emergency and non-emergency ambulance coverage for the New Zealand population,<ref>{{cite news|title=St John wants cash from Govt doubled|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10470517|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=October 18, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref> emergency care and first aid at public events, support phonelines for the elderly and house-bound, hospital patient transport, public first aid training, health products and a youth programme.
