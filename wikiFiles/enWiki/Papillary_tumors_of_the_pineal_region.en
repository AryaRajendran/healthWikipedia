'''Papillary tumors of the pineal region''' (PTPR) were first described by A. Jouvet et al. in 2003 <ref name="Papillary tumor of the pineal region">Jouvet A et al.,(2003), Papillary tumor of the pineal region. American Journal of Surgical Pathology, 27(4), 505-512.</ref>  and were introduced in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of Central Nervous System (CNS) in 2007.<ref name="WHO" >Jouvet A, Nakazato Y, Scheithauer BW, Paulus W,(2007).

== Characteristics ==

Pineal region tumors are normally composed of a variety of cells including astrocytes, ganglion cells, blood vessels, and pinealocytes, which are the cells of this organ. [[Pinealocytes]] are specialized neurons, which are rich in monoaminergic neurotransmitters, including, [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[melatonin]].<ref name="Oncology" />  Specifically, papillary tumors of this region are made up of [[ependymal cells]] which form [[:wikt:papilla|papilla]]. The papilla is meant to be surface cells. The ependymal cells line the inside of the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] of the brain. These cells have [[proteins]] that make up the characteristics of the tumor. These proteins arise from [[blood vessels]], [[nerve cells]] and [[muscle cells]].<ref name="Interview">Janss, Anna. Personal Interview. 24 Oct. 2011.</ref>

These tumors, papillary tumors in this case, have no known predisposing genetic characteristics, as stated by Dr. Janss when I interviewed her. She said that there is nothing that links the likelihood of getting this tumor type to [[genetics]], meaning nothing is inherited. However, technically speaking, there is genetics involved, just not in the sense of inheritability. The tumor cells may differ in their structure and function, but they all have normal function, which is directed by the [[deoxyribonucleic acid]], or DNA. There are meant to be certain cells in a specific area, for the pineal region these are [[ependymal cells]], and the cells divide into millions. As these cells divide, their genetic material is being copied. In a tumor, there is a collection of [[mutations]] that are typos in the genetic material, which disrupts the function of the normal cell. Therefore, the cells differentiate from what they were meant to be. If the abnormal cells continue to grow, divide, and produce more abnormal cells, the mass of abnormal cells may eventually become a [[tumor]].<ref name="Interview" /><ref name="100 Questions and Answers">Virginia Stark-Vance, M. L. D. (2011). 100 Questions and Answers About Brain Tumors (2 ed.): Jones and Bartlett Publishers.</ref>

Papillary tumors of the pineal region are normally well circumscribed. They are reported to be fairly large ranging between 2.5 to 4.0 centimeters. These tumors sometimes feature a [[cystic]] component.<ref name="Brain Pathology">Federico Roncaroli, B. S. (2007). Papillary Tumor of the Pineal Region and Spindle Cell Oncocytoma of the Pituitary: New Tumor Entities in the 2007 WHO Classification. Brain Pathology, 17, 314-318.</ref>

==Epidemiology==

Papillary tumors of pineal region are extremely rare, constituting 0.4-1% of all [[central nervous system]] tumors.<ref name="Oncology" /> These tumors most commonly occur in adults with the mean age being 31.5. There have been cases reported for people between the ages 5 to 66 years. There is a slight predominance of females who have these tumors.<ref name="Brain Pathology"/><ref name="Poulgrain">Katherine Poulgrain, R. G., Craig Winter, Benjamin Ong, Queenie Lau. (2011). Papillary tumor of the pineal region. Journal of Clinical Neuroscience, 18(8), 1007-1017.</ref>

==Grading==
[[File:PTPR MRI.jpg|thumb|right|MRI of a papillary tumor of the pineal region in an 18-year old boy. Sagittal T1+Gd.]]
Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR) is a recently described [[neoplasm]] that has been formally recognized in the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) “Classification of Tumors of the Nervous System.” <ref name="MR Imaging" />

Because these tumors are so rare, at first there was really no way to grade these tumors. Once they were biopsied, they were defined as either [[malignant]], meaning cancerous, or [[benign]], meaning cancer free. After seeing more and more cases of this tumor, they are now determined to be either Grade II or Grade III, according to the WHO classification.<ref name="Oncology" />
The [[mitotic]] activity varies for these tumors, ranging from 0 to 10 mitoses per 10 high power (x40) fields.<ref name="Brain Pathology"/>

===Grade II===

Grade II tumors are relatively slow growing. They have a slightly abnormal microscopic appearance and can spread into nearby normal tissue. Grade II tumors can also recur as a higher-grade tumor.<ref name="A Primer of Brain Tumors">Anthony Asher, P. B., David Croteau, Jillann Demes, Tom Mikkelsen, Teresa Omert, Nina Paleologos, Jill Barnholtz-Sloan (2004). A Primer of Brain Tumors (2nd ed.). Des Plaines: American Brain Tumor Association.</ref>

===Grade III===

Grade III tumors are [[malignant]]. In these types of tumors the cells are actively reproducing abnormal cells. The cells of the tumor will often grow into nearby normal brain tissue. Grade III tumors tend to recur as higher-grade tumors.<ref name="A Primer of Brain Tumors" />

==Symptoms==

The most common symptom of the papillary tumor is a [[headache]].<ref name="Kern" /><ref name="MR Imaging"/><ref name="Sato">Takashi Sato, P. K., John Buatti, Toshio Moritani. (2009). Papillary tumor of the pineal region: report of a rapidly progressive tumor with possible multicentric origin. Pediatric Radiology(39), 188-190.</ref> Because headaches are so common, most people think nothing of it. This is why [[brain tumors]] are so dangerous. There are not a lot of symptoms that go along with them so people tend to wait a long time before seeking medical help. Most of the time people will go see a doctor when their headaches become consistent and start to never go away. This symptom however occurs secondary to [[hydrocephalus]], which is a result from compression of the [[cerebral aqueduct]]. The [[cerebral aqueduct]] is a narrow channel in the midbrain, which connects the third and fourth [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]. When a tumor blocks the pathway of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], this will cause headaches in the patient.<ref name="Boco">Tibor Boco, S. A., Michael Musacchio, Richard Byrne, Elizabeth Cochran. (2008). Papillary tumor of the pineal region. Neuropathology, 28, 87-92.</ref> Oftentimes when [[hydrocephalus]] occurs, a [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]] is put in place in order to alleviate the pressure.<ref name="Poulgrain" /> In one case study, an endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed as a first line procedure to treat the hydrocephalus and also for diagnostic purposes.<ref name="Tumor in Child" /> 

In some cases, patients have had progressive [[diplopia]], or double vision.<ref name="Boco" /><ref name="Raul">Cardenas R, J. V., Haydel J, Wadhwa R, Fowler M, Scheithauer B, Nanda A. (May 2010). Papillary tumor of pineal region: prolonged control rate after gamma knife radiosurgery - a case report and review of literature. Neurology India, 58(3), 471-476.</ref> Also, although not in all cases, patients sometimes suffer from nausea and vomiting.<ref name="Kern" /><ref name="Poulgrain" />

==Histological and immunohistochemical features ==

The critical diagnosis of this neoplasm is often difficult because of its similarity with other primary or secondary papillary lesions of the pineal region, including parenchymal pineal tumors, papillary ependymoma, papillary meningioma, choroid plexus papilloma, and metastatic papillary carcinoma.<ref name="Brain Pathology"/>

Papillary tumors characteristically show a discrete, compressive border with adjacent pineal gland and brain parenchyma. The [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] tend to be regular, round – to – oval and contain stippled [[chromatin]]. The cytoplasmic and often nuclear expression of [[S100 protein]] is present in nearly all tumor cells, and [[vimentin]] typically stains tumor cell cytoplasm adjacent to vessel walls.<ref name="Brain Pathology"/> The cells of this tumor usually show a columnar to cuboidal cytoplasm with a well-defined [[cytoplasmic membrane]]. Vacuolated, or clear cells are common.<ref name="Oncology" />[[Necrosis]] or cell death is normally observed to some extent in most of these tumors cells.<ref name="Tumor in Child" /><ref name="Brain Pathology"/>

These tumors were tested immunohistochemically with a profile similar to that of a [[choroid plexus tumor]]; however, morphologically the tumors appeared to be less differentiated than a [[choroid plexus papilloma]] and more differentiated than a [[choroid plexus carcinoma]].<ref name="Raul" />

There is normally cytoplasmic staining for a number of cytokeratin’s and the immunohistochemical profile for the papillary tumors are as follows: 
			

Cam5.2 (low molecular weight cytokeratin) -->  +++	
			
AE1/AE3 (pan-cytokeratin) -->   -

CK8/18 ([[cytokeratin]] 8/18) -->  +++

EMA (epithelial membrane antigen) -->  -

GFAP ([[glial fibrillary acidic protein]]) -->  +

[[Synaptophysin]] -->  -

[[Chromogranin]] -->  -

NSE ([[neuron-specific enolase]]) -->  ++

NFP ([[neurofilament protein]]) -->  -

CD56/N-CAM ([[neural cell adhesion molecule]]) -->  ++

[[S100]] -->  ++

[[Transthyretin]] -->  -

[[Vimentin]] -->  +++

[[Desmin]] -->  -	

SMA (smooth muscle actin) -->  +

The intensity of immunoreactivity was scored as follows:  - (absent), + (weak/focal), ++ (moderate), and +++ (strong).<ref name="Poulgrain" />

==Current research==

Because of the rarity of these tumors, there is still a lot of unknown information. There are many case studies that have been reported on patients who have been diagnosed with this specific type of tumor. Most of the above information comes from the findings resulting from case studies.

Since Papillary Tumors of the Pineal Region were first described in 2003, there have been seventy cases published in the English literature.<ref name="Poulgrain" /> Since there is such a small number of cases that have been reported, the treatment guidelines have not been established. A larger number of cases that contain a longer clinical follow-up are needed to optimize the management of patients with this rare disease.<ref name="Kern" /> 

Even though there is a general consensus on the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and the immunohistochemical characteristics that is required for the diagnosis, the histological grading criteria have yet to be fully defined and its biological behavior appears to be variable.<ref name="Poulgrain" /> This specific type of tumor appears to have a high potential for local recurrence with a high tumor bed recurrence rate during the five years after the initial surgery. This suggests the need for a tumor bed boost radiotherapy after surgical resection.<ref name="Tumor in Child" /> 

As stated above, the specific treatment guidelines have not yet been established, however, gross total resection of the tumor has been the only clinical factor associated overall and progression-free survival.<ref name="Poulgrain" /> The value of [[radiotherapy]] as well as [[chemotherapy]] on disease progression will need to be investigated in future trials. With this information, it will provide important insight into long-term management and may further our understanding of the histologic features of this tumor.<ref name="Boco" />
