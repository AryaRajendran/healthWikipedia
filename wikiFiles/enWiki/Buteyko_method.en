The '''Buteyko method''' or '''Buteyko Breathing Technique''' is a form of [[Complementary and alternative medicine|complementary or alternative]] [[physiotherapy|physical therapy]] that proposes the use of breathing exercises as a treatment for [[asthma]] as well as other conditions. The method takes its name from Ukrainian doctor [[Konstantin Buteyko|Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko]] (Ukrainian: Бутейко) (1923 – 2003), who first formulated its principles during the 1950s.  This method is based on the assumption that numerous medical conditions, including asthma, are caused by chronically increased [[respiratory rate]] or deeper breathing ([[hyperventilation]]).  However, this theory is not widely supported in the medical community due to the lack of evidence supporting either the theory behind the method or that it works in practice.  This method purportedly retrains the breathing pattern through chronic repetitive breathing exercises to correct the hyperventilation, which, according to the method's proponents, will therefore treat or cure asthma as well as any other conditions purportedly caused by hyperventilation.  At the core of the Buteyko method is a series of reduced-breathing exercises that focus on nasal-breathing, breath-holding and relaxation.

Research into the use of the Buteyko method has focused almost exclusively on the treatment of asthma, and have had [[methodology|methodological]] problems.  Studies have not found objective measures to support its use such as improvement in [[lung function]], though there are results showing it may improve subjective measures such as [[Asthma#Signs and symptoms|asthma symptoms]] and [[quality of life]].  [[Reviews]] of this medical literature have come to different conclusions about the strength of evidence supporting the Buteyko method, with older literature saying the evidence does not support its use, while more recent and up-to-date reviews and guidelines have found the evidence is enough to consider qualified support.  The literature that supports considering its use note the Buteyko method should be used with traditional therapies (and not in place of mainstream treatment) and is unlikely to affect the underlying cause of asthma.  There is no support for the use of the Buteyko method in other diseases, such as [[diabetes mellitus]] or any of the over 150 diseases supporters of this method claim to treat.

== History ==

The Buteyko method was originally developed in the 1950s by [[physiologist]] Konstantin Buteyko in Russia.<ref name=Bruton2005>{{cite journal |author=Bruton A, Lewith GT |title=The Buteyko breathing technique for asthma: a review |journal=Complement Ther Med |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=41–6 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15907677 |doi=10.1016/j.ctim.2005.01.003 |url=}}</ref> The first official study into the effectiveness of the Buteyko Method on asthma was undertaken in 1968 at the Leningrad Institute of Pulmonology.  The second, held at the First Moscow Institute of Pediatric Diseases in April 1980,  eventually led to the head of the ministry of health to issue an order (No 591) for the implementation of the Buteyko method in the treatment of bronchial asthma.<ref name="BurenkovS">{{cite book | author=Burenkov S | title=Buteyko Method: The experience of implementation in medical practice | chapter=USSR Ministry of Health, Order No 591 | editor=Ed.

The Buteyko method is just one of a number of breathing retraining methods in use for treating lung diseases, including conventional techniques such as [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] led breathing exercises as well alternative medicine techniques like Buteyko such as [[yoga]].<ref name= Bruton2011/>

== Theory ==

The Buteyko method is based on the concept that "hidden" or undiagnosed hyperventilation is the underlying cause of numerous medical conditions, including asthma.  It is known that hyperventilation can lead to low [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the blood (or [[hypocapnea]]), which can subsequently lead to disturbances of the [[acid-base]] balance in the blood and lower tissue [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygen levels]].  Advocates of this method believe that the effects of ''chronic'' hyperventilation would have even wider effects than is commonly accepted.<ref name=Courtney/>  These effects include widespread spasms of the muscle in the airways ([[bronchospasm]]),<ref name=BrutonChest>{{cite journal |author=Bruton A, Holgate ST |title=Hypocapnia and asthma: a mechanism for breathing retraining? |journal=Chest |volume=127 |issue=5 |pages=1808–11 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15888863 |doi=10.1378/chest.127.5.1808 |url=}}</ref> disturbance of cell energy production via the [[Krebs cycle]], as well as disturbance of numerous vital [[homeostatic]] chemical reactions in the body.  The Buteyko method is a purported method of "retraining" the body's breathing pattern to correct for the presumed ''chronic'' hyperventilation and hypocapnea, and thereby treat or cure the body of these medical problems.<ref name=Courtney/>

The Buteyko method is not widely supported in the medical community, in part due to the fact that research has not supported this theory that hyperventilation and hypocapnea causes disease,<ref name=Courtney/> with one review noting that there is no convincing evidence to indicate that trying to change asthmatic's carbon dioxide level is either "desirable or achievable."<ref name=BrutonChest/>  Studies that have looked for evidence to corroborate this theory, such as looking at the carbon dioxide levels in practitioners of Buteyko, have not found this evidence, leading some to propose alternate theoretical pathways for this method to improve symptoms.<ref name=Courtney/>

== Description ==

Although variations exist among teachers of the technique in different countries, the main objective is "normalization" of breathing and the three core principles of Buteyko remain the same: nasal breathing, reduced breathing and relaxation.

=== Nasal breathing ===

The Buteyko method emphasizes the importance of [[nasal breathing]], which protects the airways by humidifying, warming, and cleaning the air entering the lungs.  A majority of asthmatics have problems sleeping at night, and this is thought by Buteyko practitioners to be linked with poor posture or unconscious mouth-breathing. By keeping the nose clear and encouraging nasal breathing during the day, night-time symptoms can also improve.  Strictly nasal breathing during physical exercise is another key element of the Buteyko method.

=== Reduced breathing exercises ===

The core Buteyko exercises involve breath control; consciously reducing either breathing rate or breathing volume. Many teachers refer to Buteyko as 'breathing retraining' and compare the method to learning to ride a bicycle. Once time has been spent practicing, the techniques become instinctive and the exercises are gradually phased out as the condition improves.

Buteyko uses a measurement called the Control Pause (CP), defined as the amount of time that an individual can comfortably hold breath after a normal exhalation. According to Buteyko teachers, with regular Buteyko reduced-breathing practice, asthmatics are expected to find that their CP gradually increases and their pulse rate decreases in parallel decreased asthma symptoms.

=== Relaxation ===

Dealing with asthma attacks is an important factor of Buteyko practice. The first feeling of an asthma attack is unsettling and can result in a short period of rapid breathing. By controlling this initial over-breathing phase, asthmatics can prevent a "vicious circle of over-breathing" from developing and spiraling into an asthma attack.  This means that asthma attacks may be averted simply by breathing less.

== Effectiveness ==

Advocates of the Buteyko method report a wide range of other diseases and symptoms (numbering up to 150), including [[diabetes]], reproductive disorders and psychological disorders, which they believe is aggravated by hyperventilation and hypocapnea, and therefore are treated by use of the Buteyko method.  However, research into the effectiveness of Buteyko have focused almost exclusively on asthma with a small amount of research on [[sleep apnea]].<ref name=Courtney/> Members of the medical community have been skeptical of the efficacy of Buteyko due to the often "exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims" earlier made by Buteyko practitioners.<ref name=Bruton2011/>

There are few high quality studies such as [[randomized controlled trials]] looking at the efficacy of treating asthma with "breathing retraining" methods in general, which include the Buteyko method, [[yoga]] training and other relaxation techniques.<ref name=Holloway>{{cite journal |author=Holloway E, Ram FS |title=Breathing exercises for asthma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD001277 |year=2004 |pmid=14973966 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001277.pub2 |url= |editor1-last=Holloway |editor1-first=Elizabeth A}}</ref> Many of the studies that have evaluated breathing retraining have significant methodological flaws, including small [[sample size]]s,<ref name=Ernst>{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=Breathing techniques--adjunctive treatment modalities for asthma?

The results from these studies have found trends of [[subjectivity|subjective]] improvement in factors such as asthma symptoms and measurement of quality of life with use of the Buteyko method and possible reduced rescue inhaler usage.<ref name=Bruton2011/>  However, these studies have found no improvement in objective measures such as [[peak flow]] and [[FEV1]] which are the typical measures for measuring the severity of asthma, or carbon dioxide level in the blood.<ref name=Holloway /> 

Based on the available evidence, reviews of the literature and expert [[Guideline (medical)|medical guidelines]] have come to conflicting conclusions about the Buteyko method, though most have called for more research, including larger trials involving more patients.  On the one hand, a [[Cochrane review]] found "no reliable conclusions" could be determined based on the limited available evidence,<ref name=Holloway /> and the U.S. [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] asthma guideline concluded "there is insufficient evidence to suggest that breathing techniques provide clinical benefit to patients who have asthma."<ref name=NHLBI>{{cite web|title=Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthgdln.pdf|publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|accessdate=20 January 2011}}</ref>  On the other hand, two more recent reviews have expressed qualified support for considering breathing retraining techniques, which include techniques such as physiotherapist led breathing exercises and yoga breathing in addition to Buteyko.  These reviews noted these techniques should only be used as adjuncts to typical treatment with medications for symptom control, as these techniques are unlikely to affect the underlying processes causing the asthma<ref name=Bruton2011>{{cite journal |author=Bruton A, Thomas M |title=The role of breathing training in asthma management |journal=Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=53–7 |year=2011 |month=February |pmid=21150439 |doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e3283423085 |url=}}</ref> and that the weight of available evidence is not strong enough to come to a definitive conclusion.<ref name=Burgess>{{cite journal |author=Burgess J, Ekanayake B, Lowe A, Dunt D, Thien F, Dharmage SC |title=Systematic review of the effectiveness of breathing retraining in asthma management |journal=Expert Rev Respir Med |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=789–807 |year=2011 |month=December |pmid=22082165 |doi=10.1586/ers.11.69 |url=}}</ref>  The [[British Thoracic Society]] stated the Buteyko method "may be considered to help patients control the symptoms of asthma" while recognizing the lack of data showing an objective improvement in prior studies.<ref name=BTS>British Thoracic Society & Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN).

This result suggests patients who experience [[anxiety]] or who overuse their rescue inhalers in particular may benefit from any breathing techniques as an adjunct to conventional treatments, though cost of using these techniques may be prohibitive.<ref name=GINAGuideline>{{cite web|title=Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention|url=http://www.ginasthma.org/uploads/users/files/GINA_Report2011_May4.pdf|publisher=Global Initiative for Asthma|year=2011|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref>
