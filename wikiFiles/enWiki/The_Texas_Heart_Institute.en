== Research ==

The Stem Cell Center of the Texas Heart Institute was first in the United States to receive FDA approval for an adult stem cell clinical trial to treat patients with advanced heart failure.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In addition, the Texas Heart Institute was one of five centers selected by the National Institutes of Health to study [[stem cell treatments]] for patients with cardiovascular disease. The [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] has provided a $33.7 million to support these centers in a new national consortium called the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network.<ref name="Research">{{cite web|url=http://www.texasheart.org/Research/summary1.cfm|title=Research - Texas Heart Institute|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> 

Physician scientists at the Texas Heart Institute have amassed the world’s greatest experience{{Fact|date=November 2008}} in the development and use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) to sustain the failing circulation in patients with severe [[heart failure]]. More than a dozen different VADs are being studied in clinical trials conducted by the Center for Cardiac Support at the Texas Heart Institute, and more are under development in preclinical studies. A key area of research in the field of VADs is the concept of heart failure “remission,” or the use of a VAD to support a patient’s heart, thus giving the heart time to heal and recover normal function. Over the last three years, seven patients supported long term with a HeartMate II VAD have achieved remission, allowing for the removal of their devices.<ref name="Research"/> Researchers are also working on the development of a small total [[artificial heart]] that would deliver blood by continuous flow rather than pulsation.<ref name="Research"/>

==Educational Programs==
The Texas Heart Institute has a number of educational programs that may be of benefit to physicians and lay persons who are interested in learning more about heart disease.  

The Center for Cardiac Support developed a course to train health care professionals in the use of the various cardiac support technologies. Through lectures, discussions, case presentations, and laboratory exercises, course participants will learn the best treatment options for their patients who require cardiac support.  The course is delivered by staff from the Texas Heart Institute’s Center for Cardiac Support. The staff’s extensive experience in the field and the Texas Heart Institute’s state-of-the-art facilities provide a unique educational opportunity for participants.

Institute physicians and scientists publish approximately 300 scientific manuscripts every year in medical journals that are indexed via PubMed.  [http://www.texasheart.org/Education/THIJournal/index.cfm ''The Texas Heart Institute Journal''], a quarterly medical journal received by 45 000 cardiovascular physicians internationally, can be accessed via PubMed and the PubMed Central website.  [http://www.texasheart.org/Education/Pubs/hwatch.cfm Heart Watch], a quarterly scientific bulletin is available in English and Spanish versions. In addition, a [http://www.texasheart.org/Education/Library/index.cfm Library and Learning Resource Center] is available to THI health professionals and researchers for accessing electronic systems and print publications that contain information about cardiovascular disease.

THI has a variety of [http://www.texasheart.org/Education/Train/postdoc.cfm postdoctoral programs]. Each year, 100 heart specialists improve their knowledge and skills through participation in these programs, which have been instrumental in the training of more than 2600 heart specialists from 44 states and 47 countries. 

[http://www.texasheart.org/Education/CME/index.cfm Continuing Medical Education] provides online programs designed to keep physicians from throughout the world up-to-date with the latest information on the prevention and treatment of heart disease. The website offers physicians, scientists, and health care professionals the opportunity to view and receive free credit for online symposia, cardiology grand rounds, courses in ethics and heart sounds auscultation, and case studies in peripheral vascular disease, electrophysiology, and echocardiography. 

[http://www.texasheart.org/HIC/his.cfm The Heart Information Center] (HIC) is a free, heart-health information resource for patients and the public. The facility, comprising a library of print and multimedia resources and computer workstations with Internet access, is located on the first floor of the Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital–The Denton A. Cooley Building. The HIC also provides assistance to the public via e-mail and telephone inquiries and an extensive website resource offering more than 150 heart-health topics in both English and Spanish. 

[http://www.texasheart.org/HIC/ProjH/index.cfm The Project Heart] website, a resource for teachers, parents, and students, extends the HIC outreach to the virtual classroom. With complete lesson plans for kindergarten through 6th grade, the site provides educators with activities to teach heart anatomy, good nutrition, and a healthy lifestyle. All materials comply with [http://www.tea.state.tx.us/teks/ Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills criteria].

== Location ==
The Texas Heart Institute is located in the Denton A. Cooley Building, adjacent to its clinical partner, St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital, within the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas. The 327,000-square foot, 10-story Cooley Building was designed for four primary purposes—patient care, research, education, and clinical treatment. There are twelve {{convert|650|sqft|m2|adj=on}} operating rooms devoted exclusively to heart procedures and three floors of specialized patient care rooms.<ref name="DAC building">{{cite web|url=http://www.texasheart.org/AboutUs/dac_building.cfm|title=Denton A. Cooley Building - Texas Heart Institute|accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref>

Two floors of the Cooley Building are devoted to the molecular and cellular study (basic scientific research) of cardiovascular disease. One of those floors is used collaboratively by The University of Texas system for cardiovascular research.<ref name="DAC building"/>
A helistop is located on the roof of the building, which increases the efficiency of emergency patient care and the heart transplant program.<ref name="DAC building"/>
