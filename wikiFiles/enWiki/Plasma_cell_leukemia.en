The [[WHO]] criterion for diagnosis of PCL is that plasma cells constitute more than 20% of cells in the peripheral blood with an absolute plasma cell count of more than 2 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. The presentation may be primary, de novo, or secondary, evolving from an existing case of [[multiple myeloma]] as part of the terminal phase of the disease. Approximately 60 to 70% of cases are primary.

==Laboratory findings==
Although there is overlap, the markers of plasma cells from patients with primary PCL is different from those of myeloma patients. PCL plasma cells more frequently express the [[CD20]] antigen than those of multiple myeloma (50% vs. 17%), and they often lack [[CD56]] antigen which is present on the majority of myeloma cells. CD56 is considered important in anchoring plasma cells to bone marrow stroma, and its expression is associated with a poor prognosis. [[CD28]] is more frequently expressed on malignant plasma cells in secondary than in primary PCL, which is consistent with an observation made in myeloma, that is, that acquisition of the CD28 antigen on plasma cells appears to correlate with an increased proliferative rate and disease progression.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The chromosome characteristics or [[karyotype]]s of PCL plasma cells is complex. Using [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] ( [[fish]] ) techniques, losses in the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q) and deletion of one the homologous chromosomes 13 (monosmy 13) exist in more than 80% of PCL patients. Losses on chromosome 16 also occur in approximately 80% of cases. Gains in long arm of chromosome 1 (1q) are present in approximately one-half of the patients determined by FISH, but in all patients by comparative genomic hybridization. Overexpression of the protein PRAD1/cyclin D1, which plays an important role in control of the cell cycle, has also been observed in PCL.  Plasma cell leukemia is more frequent in light-chain (Bence Jones protein) or IgD myeloma. It is seen less frequently in IgA or IgG myeloma (see: [[multiple myeloma]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Clinical course==
The clinical presentation of primary PCL is more aggressive than that of multiple myeloma, and the clinical features found in PCL involves combination of those found in [[acute leukemia]] and those found in [[myeloma]]. PCL patients have a higher presenting tumor burden; higher frequencies of (involvement of organs other than the bone marrow by disease), thrombocytopenia (decreased platelet count), anemia, hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium), and renal impairment; increased levels of serum [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) and β-2 microglobulin  and plasma cell proliferative activity. The incidence of lytic bone lesions is slightly lower than that usually observed in multiple myeloma. PCL is extremely aggressive associated with short survival (median survival of 6–8 months).<ref name=Kim2007/>

==Therapy and prognosis==
Treatment of plasma cell leukemia is by supportive care and systemic chemotherapy. Combination of [[cyclophosphamide]], [[doxorubicin]], [[vincristine]], and [[prednisone]] (or [[dexamethasone]]) can be used. A second combination is the use of cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, and [[thalidomide]] as for myeloma. Another regimen termed VMCP/VBAP uses alternating vincristine, [[melphalan]] (M), cyclophosphamide, prednisone/vincristine, [[carmustine]], doxorubicin, and prednisone polychemotherapy. In general, combination chemotherapy has resulted in median survivals of 18 to 20 months compared to 2 to 6 months when single agent therapy is used.{{cn|date=December 2012}} There are anecdotal reports of excellent responses and 2- to 3-year disease-free survivals after [[autologous stem cell transplantation]]. Autologous transplantation may increase benefit from conventional therapy and high dose melphalan may prolong progression free and overall survival.{{cn|date=December 2012}} 

Although the clinical and laboratory features of primary and secondary PCL are similar, the response to therapy and overall survival in primary and secondary PCL go from poor to worse. Patients with secondary PCL are usually refractory to chemotherapy and have a poor survival compared with duration (median <2 months). 

Novel agents like [[thalidomide]], [[lenalidomide]] and [[bortezomib]] have been recently used, alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics like melphalan or cyclophosphamide.{{cn|date=December 2012}} Two cases had encouraging results with bortezomib.<ref name=Kim2007/><ref name=Chan2009/> Recent studies demonstrate that velcade (bortezomib)- based regimens offer a significant profit in patients suffering from PCL.{{cn|date=December 2012}} More aggressive therapeutic regimens like [[DT-PACE]] or protocols used in [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia|ALL]] offer a significant response rate, but with short remission interval.{{cn|date=December 2012}}
