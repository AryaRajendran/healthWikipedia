==Early years==
Tewhida Ben Sheikh was born in [[Tunis, Tunisia]]. Her early education was at Tunisia's first public school for Muslim girls, which was established by "Tunisian nationalists and liberal French protectorate authorities". While attending this school, Ben Sheikh was taught Arabic, French, the study of the [[Qur'an]], and modern subjects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nashat, Guity, and Judith E.

Tunisia was a French colony at the time. Ben Sheikh came from an elite Tunisian family which was socially conservative, and her widowed mother was reluctant to allow her to go to France after secondary school; however, her secondary school instructors and a physician from the Louis Pasteur Institute of Tunis (Dr. Etienne Burnet), persuaded Ben Sheikh's mother that she showed significant promise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women in World History: Primary Sources|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/p/184.html|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}</ref>
