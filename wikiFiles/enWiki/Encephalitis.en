'''Encephalitis''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἐγκέφαλος ''enképhalos'' “brain”,<ref>{{Internetquelle|hrsg=The University of Chicago Library|titel=Woodhouse's English-Greek Dictionary|url=http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/efts/dicos/woodhouse_test.pl?keyword=^Brain,%20subs. |zugriff=2013-01-10 |sprache=en}}</ref> composed of ἐν “in” and κέφαλος “head”, and the medical suffix ''-itis'' “inflammation”) is an [[Acute (medical)|acute]] [[inflammation]] of the [[Human brain|brain]]. Encephalitis with [[meningitis]] is known as [[meningoencephalitis]]. Symptoms include [[headache]], [[fever]], [[confusion]], [[drowsiness]], and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. More advanced and serious symptoms include [[seizure]]s or [[convulsion]]s, [[tremor]]s, [[hallucination]]s, and [[memory problem]]s.

==Signs and symptoms==
Adult patients with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present irritability, poor appetite and fever.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Neurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused patient. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Cause==
===Viral===
{{main|Viral encephalitis}}

Viral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the [[sequelae]] of a latent infection.  The most common causes of acute viral encephalitis are [[rabies virus]], [[Herpes simplex]], [[poliovirus]], [[measles virus]], and [[JC virus]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Other causes include infection by [[flavivirus]]es such as [[Japanese encephalitis virus]], [[St. Louis encephalitis virus]] or [[West Nile virus]], or by [[Togaviridae]] such as [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] (EEE virus), [[Western equine encephalitis virus]] (WEE virus) or [[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus]] (VEE virus). Henipaviruses; Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV), are also known to cause viral encephalitis.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Bacterial and other===
It can be caused by a [[bacteria]]l infection, such as bacterial [[meningitis]], spreading directly to the brain (primary encephalitis), or may be a complication of a current infectious disease [[syphilis]] (secondary encephalitis). Certain [[parasitic]] or [[protozoa]]l infestations, such as [[toxoplasmosis]], [[malaria]], or [[primary amoebic meningoencephalitis]], can also cause encephalitis in people with [[immune deficiency|compromised]] [[immune system]]s. [[Lyme disease]] and/or Bartonella henselae may also cause encephalitis. [[Cryptococcus neoformans]] is notorious for causing fungal encephalitis in the immunocompromised. [[Streptococci]], [[staphylococci]] and certain [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative bacilli]] cause cerebritis prior to the formation of a brain abscess.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Limbic system encephalitis===
In a large number of cases, called [[limbic encephalitis]], the pathogens responsible for encephalitis attack primarily the [[limbic system]] (a collection of structures at the base of the brain responsible for emotions and many other basic functions).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Autoimmune encephalitis===
It has recently been recognised that there are types of encephalitis resulting from an attack of the brain by the body's immune system. These autoimmune conditions include but are not limited to [[Voltage-gated potassium channel|VGKC]] antibody associated encephalitis, [[Glutamate decarboxylase|Anti-GAD]] antibody associated encephalitis, [[Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis|NDMA]] antibody associated encephalitis, and [[Hashimoto's encephalopathy|Hashimoto's encephalitis]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The majority of patients with autoimmune encephalitis do not harbor a tumor and the etiology of the disease in these patients is less clear, often leading to a delayed diagnosis.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Encephalitis lethargica===
{{main|Encephalitis lethargica}}

[[Encephalitis lethargica]] is an atypical form of encephalitis which caused an [[epidemic]] from 1918 to 1930. Those who survived sank into a semi-conscious state that lasted for decades. Neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] used the Parkinson's drug [[L-DOPA]] to revive those still alive in the late 1960s. 

There have been only a small number of isolated cases in the years since, though in recent years a few patients have shown very similar symptoms. The cause is now thought to be either a bacterial agent or an autoimmune response following infection.

==Diagnosis==
Examination of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] obtained by a [[lumbar puncture]] procedure usually reveals increased amounts of protein and white blood cells with normal glucose, though in a significant percentage of patients, the cerebrospinal fluid may be normal. [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] often is not helpful, as cerebral abscess is uncommon. Cerebral abscess is more common in patients with meningitis  than encephalitis. Bleeding is also uncommon except in patients with [[herpes simplex]] type 1 encephalitis. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] offers better resolution. In patients with herpes simplex encephalitis, electroencephalograph may show sharp waves in one or both of the temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture procedure is performed only after the possibility of prominent brain swelling is excluded by a CT scan examination. Diagnosis is often made with detection of antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid against a specific viral agent (such as herpes simplex virus) or by [[polymerase chain reaction]] that amplifies the [[RNA]] or [[DNA]] of the virus responsible (such as [[varicella zoster virus]]). Serological tests may show high antibody titre against the causative antigen.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Treatment==
Treatment is usually [[symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]]. Reliably tested specific antiviral agents are few in number (e.g. [[acyclovir]] for [[herpes simplex virus]]) and are used with limited success in treatment of viral infection, with the exception of herpes simplex encephalitis. In patients who are very sick, supportive treatment, such as mechanical ventilation, is equally important. Corticosteroids (e.g., [[methylprednisolone]]) are used to reduce brain swelling and inflammation. Sedatives may be needed for irritability or restlessness. For ''Mycoplasma'' infection, [[parenteral]] [[tetracycline]] is given. Encephalitis due to ''Toxoplasma'' is treated by giving a combination of [[pyrimethamine]] and [[sulphadimidine]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Prevention==
Vaccination is available against tick-borne<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ith/vaccines/tbe/en/|title=Tick-borne Encephalitis|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>  & Japanese encephalitis<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/japanese_encephalitis/en/|title=Japanese encephalitis|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>  and should be considered for at-risk individuals.

Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating [[small pox]] vaccination is totally avoidable now as small pox is now eradicated. Contraindication to Pertussis immunisation should be observed in patients with encephalitis. An immunodeficient patient who has had contact with [[chicken pox]] virus should be given [[prophylaxis]] with hyperimmune zoster [[immunoglobulin]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Epidemiology==
The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 population per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 per year.<ref name="Jmor">{{Cite journal | last=Jmor | first=F | coauthors=Emsley HC, Fischer M et al. | title=The incidence of acute encephalitis syndrome in Western industrialised and tropical countries | journal=Virology Journal | volume=5 | issue=134 | month=October | year=2008 | pmid=18973679 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583971/pdf/1743-422X-5-134.pdf | pmc=2583971 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-5-134 | pages=134}}</ref>
