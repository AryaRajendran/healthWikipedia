'''Emergency bleeding control''' describes the steps or actions taken to control [[bleeding]] from a [[patient]] who has suffered a [[traumatic injury]] or who has a medical condition which has led to bleeding. Many bleeding control techniques are taught as part of [[first aid]] throughout the world,<ref> {{citeweb|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000045.htm|title=Bleeding|publisher=MedlinePlus|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> although some more advanced techniques such as [[tourniquets]], are often taught as being reserved for use by [[health professional]]s, or as an absolute last resort, in order to mitigate the risks associated with them, such as potential loss of limbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nasd/docs/d000701-d000800/d000799/d000799.html|last=Cyr|first=Dawna L|coauthors=Johnson, Steven B|title=Basic First Aid|publisher=The University of Maine|date=September 2006|accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610042035/http://www.cdc.gov/nasd/docs/d000701-d000800/d000799/d000799.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-10}}</ref> In order to manage bleeding effectively, it is important to be able to readily identify both types of wounds and types of bleeding.

== Types of wounds ==
{{Main| Wound}}
Wounds are normally described in a variety of ways.  These may deal with a description of wound size (length) and thickness, or also with the plainly visible wound characteristics.  Wounds may be categorized as open or closed, or as either acute or chronic in origin.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.formulary.cht.nhs.uk/pdf,_doc_files_etc/APC/Wound%20Formulary/3_WoundTypes.pdf|title=NHS Formulary website|accessdate=2009-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  The most common descriptors of wounds are these:

* ''Incisions:''  Straight edges to the wound margins, as if sliced with a knife.  These can vary in size, and may be caused by a variety of objects, including a [[scalpel]], a knife, any piece of straight, sharp metal, or a piece of glass.  Tissue is rarely missing from the wound site, and the margins of the wound may be easily matched from one side of the wound to the other for the purposes of closure.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://surgeryonline.wordpress.com/tag/types-of-wound/|title=Surgeryonline website|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>
* ''[[Laceration]]''  Jagged edges to the wound margins, more closely resembling a tear than a slice.  The wounded tissue is random rather than straight in direction, and may have multiple branches.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/injuries_and_poisoning/first_aid/wounds.html|title=Wounds (1) (Merck Manual online)|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>  Most often caused by an object with a broken or [[serrated blade|serrated]] edge, such as a piece of broken glass or metal, but may also be caused by a blow from a blunt object to tissue with bone immediately behind it.
* ''Puncture:''  Sharp object penetrates the tissue, and travels internally, but does not move laterally in any direction from the point of entry.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.woundcare.coloplast.com/EEndCom/Woundcare/Homepage.nsf/(VIEWDOCSBYID)/25DE6C10B6F7800BC1257375003AFB3D?opendocument&unid=25DE6C10B6F7800BC1257375003AFB3D|title=Coloplast website|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>  Such wounds can be misleading, as they may appear quite small on surface examination, but extend quite deeply into the body; even damaging nerves, blood vessels, or internal organs.  They may cause substantial [[internal bleeding]] or secondary injuries, such as a [[Pneumothorax|collapsed lung]], which may not be readily evident during primary assessment.  Occasionally, the object causing the injury will remain in the wound as an impaled object. A stab wound from a knife or other sharp object, or a bullet wound would be examples of this type of injury.  Medical professionals usually refer to this type of wound as [[penetrating trauma]].
* ''Abrasion:''  A scraping or scratching.  Generally quite superficial, and affecting only the surface layers of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://int.hansaplast.com/med-info/wound-care-beautiful-healing/types-of-wounds.html|title=Types of Wounds (Hansaplast.com website)|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>  No internal [[organs]], [[nerves]], or [[blood vessels]] other than [[capillaries]], are affected.  This may be the result of a fall, or of sliding (friction) against rough surfaces.  The ''road rash'' often suffered by falling motorcyclists is an example of this type of wound.
* ''Contusion:''  Simple [[bruising]].  In this type of injury, the capillaries in the epidermis and [[dermis]] are damaged, without breaking the skin.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ccodc.org/downloads/CONTUSIO.pdf|title=Contusions (CCODC website)|accessdate=2009-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Blood oozes out of these vessels into the spaces between cells or [[interstitial space (biology)|interstitial space]], causing [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] and [[ecchymosis|discoloration]].  Blood loss is generally limited, and not of serious consequence.  It may, however, act as a signpost, pointing to more serious injuries.
* ''Avulsion:''  A full thickness laceration-type wound, often semi-circular in shape.  This creates a ''flap'' which, when lifted, exposes the deeper tissues to view, or extrudes them from the wound itself.<ref>{{cite book |author=Benjamin Gulli; Thygerson, Alton L. |title=First aid, CPR, and AED |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Boston |year=2005 |pages=117 |isbn=0-7637-3016-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>  Avulsions often occur in mechanical accidents involving fingers (sometimes referred to as [[degloving]]), and on a more serious note, may affect the [[orbit]] of the [[human eye|eye]] or the [[abdominal cavity]], exposing the internal [[viscera]].  Avulsions are difficult to repair, and no avulsion should ever be considered a minor injury.

==Blood vessels affected==
External bleeding is generally described in terms of the origin of the blood flow by vessel type.  The basic categories of external [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] are:

* ''Arterial bleeding:'' As the name suggests, blood flow originating in an [[artery]].  With this type of bleeding, the blood is typically bright red to yellowish in colour, due to the high degree of [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]].  Blood typically exits the wound in [[blood spurt|spurts]], rather than in a steady flow. The amount of blood loss can be copious, and can occur very rapidly.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/OperationalMedicine/DATA/operationalmed/Manuals/Standard1stAid/chapter3.html|title=U.S. Navy Standard First Aid Manual, Chapter 3 (online)|accessdate=2003-02-03}}</ref>
* ''Venous bleeding:'' This blood is flowing from a damaged [[vein]]. As a result, it will be blackish in colour (due to the lack of oxygen being transported) and will flow in a steady manner. Caution is still indicated; while the blood loss may not be arterial, it can still be quite substantial, and can occur with surprising speed without intervention.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/pa/pa_bleedsev_hhg.htm|title=Severe Bleeding (Univ. Michigan Medical School website)|accessdate=2009-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
* ''Capillary bleeding:'' Capillary bleeding usually occurs in superficial wounds, such as [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]]. The colour of the blood may vary somewhat ([[distal]] portion of circulation with oxygenated and unoxygenated blood mixing), and will generally ooze in small amounts, as opposed to flowing or spurting.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ic.sunysb.edu/Stu/wilee/e-zine-controlbleeding.html|title=Control Bleeding (SUNY website)|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>

==External wound management==
The type of wound ([[incision]], [[laceration]], puncture etc.) will have a major effect on the way a wound is managed, as will the area of the body affected and the presence of any foreign objects in the wound.  The key principles of wound management are:<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.stjohn.org.au/images/stjohn/information/severe%20bleeding%20june07%20v1.pdf|title=Emergency Bleeding Control (St John Ambulance Western Australia website)|accessdate=2009-01-05}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Elevation=== 
Elevation was commonly recommended for the control of haemorrhage, some protocols continue to include it  but recent studies have failed to find any evidence of its effectiveness and it was removed from the PHTLS guidance in 2006. <ref>{{cite book|last=Surgeons|first=Prehospital Trauma Life Support Committee of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians in cooperation with the Committee on Trauma of the American College of|title=PHTLS : Prehospital Trauma Life Support|year=2010|publisher=Mosby Jems/Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=0323065023|edition=7th ed.}}</ref>

===Direct pressure=== 
Placing pressure on the wound will constrict the blood vessels manually, helping to stem any blood flow.  When applying pressure, the type and direction of the wound may have an effect, for instance, a cut lengthways on the hand would be opened up by closing the hand into a fist, whilst a cut across the hand would be sealed by making a fist.   A patient can apply pressure directly to their own wound, if their [[consciousness]] level allows.  Ideally a barrier, such as sterile, low-adherent gauze should be used between the pressure supplier and the wound, to help reduce chances of [[infection]] and help the wound to seal.  Third parties assisting a patient are always advised to use protective [[latex]] or [[nitrile]] [[medical gloves]] to reduce risk of infection or contamination passing either way.  Direct pressure can be used with some foreign objects protruding from a wound, and to achieve this, padding is applied from either side of the object to push in and seal the wound - objects are never removed.

===Pressure points===
[[File:Arterial pressure points.png|thumb|right|150px|The arterial pressure points]]
In situations where direct pressure and elevation are either not possible or proving ineffective, and there is a risk of [[exsanguination]], some training protocols advocate the use of pressure points to constrict the major artery which feeds the point of the bleed.  This is usually performed at a place where a [[pulse]] can be found, such as in the [[femoral artery]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/OperationalMedicine/DATA/operationalmed/Manuals/Standard1stAid/chapter3.html|title=Bleeding (U.S. Navy Standard First Aid Manual online|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>  There are significant risks involved in performing pressure point constriction, including [[necrosis]] of the area below the constriction, and most protocols give a maximum time for constriction (often around 10 minutes).  There is particularly high danger if constricting the [[carotid artery]] in the neck, as the brain is sensitive to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and brain damage can result within minutes of application of pressure. Pressure on the carotid artery can also cause vagal tone induced bradycardia, which can eventually stop the heart. Other dangers in use of a constricting method include [[rhabdomyolysis]], which is a build up of toxins below the pressure point, which if released back into the main bloodstream may cause [[renal failure]]

====''Epistaxis''====
:[[Epistaxis]] or a nosebleed is a special case, where almost all first aid providers train the use of pressure points.  The appropriate point here is on the soft fleshy part of the nose, which should constrict the [[capillaries]] sufficiently to stop bleeding, although obviously, this will not stop bleeding which originates in the [[nasopharynx]] or the [[tear duct]]s

===Tourniquet===
{{main|Emergency tourniquet}}
Another method of achieving constriction of the supplying artery is via the use of a [[tourniquet]] - a tightly tied band which goes around a limb to restrict blood flow.  Tourniquets are routinely used in order to bring [[vein]]s to the surface for [[cannulation]], although their use in emergency medicine is more limited.  The use of the tourniquet is restricted in most countries to professionals such as [[physician]]s and [[paramedic]]s, as this is often considered beyond the reach of [[first aid]] and those acting in good faith as a [[Good Samaritan law|good samaritan]].  A key exception is the military, where many armies carry a tourniquet as part of their personal first aid kit.  

Improvised tourniquets, in addition to creating potential problems for the ongoing medical management of the patient, usually fail to achieve force enough to adequately compress the arteries of the limb.  As a result, they not only fail to stop arterial bleeding, but may actually increase bleeding due to the impaired venous bloodflow.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/102/suppl_1/I-77|title=New Guidelines (AHA Journal Circulation online)|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref> Some argue that tourniquets should never be used in the pre-hospital setting, not even for amputations.

===Clotting agents===
{{main|Hemostatic agent}}
Some protocols call for the use of clotting accelerating agents, which can either by externally applied as a powder, gel or pre-dosed in a dressing, or as an [[intravenous]] injection.
These may be particularly useful in situations where the wound is not clotting, which can be due to external factors, such as size of wound, or medical factors such as [[haemophilia]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.prlog.org/10076809-wound-types-and-advanced-wound-products-market-worldwide-medmarket-diligence-report-s245.html|title=MedMarketDiligence website|accessdate=2008-02-03}}</ref>

[[rFVIIa]] is not, as of 2012, supported by the evidence for most cases of major bleeding.<ref name=7Cochrane2012>{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=E|coauthors=Lin, Y; Stanworth, S; Birchall, J; Doree, C; Hyde, C|title=Recombinant factor VIIa for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in patients without haemophilia.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Mar 14|volume=3|pages=CD005011|pmid=22419303}}</ref> There is a significant risk of arterial thrombosis with its use and thus other than in those with [[factor VII deficiency]] should only be used in clinical trails.<ref name=7Cochrane2012/>

==Internal wound management==
Internal wounds (usually to the [[torso]]) are harder to deal with than external wounds, although they often have an external cause.  The key dangers of internal bleeding include [[hypovolaemic shock]] (leading to [[exsanguination]], causing a [[tamponade]] on the heart or a [[haemothorax]] on the lung.  The [[aortic aneurysm]] is a special case where the [[aorta]], the body's main blood vessel, become ruptured through an inherent weakness.  This is one of the most serious [[medical emergency|medical emergencies]] a patient can face, as the only treatment is rapid surgery, although exertion, raised blood pressure or sudden movements could cause a sudden catastrophic failure.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/heart_and_blood_vessel_disorders/aneurysms_and_aortic_dissection/aneurysms.html|title=Aneurysms (Merck Manual online)|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>

In the event of the bleeding being caused by an external source (trauma, penetrating wound), the patient is usually inclined to the injured side, in order to ensure that the 'good' side can continue to function properly, without interference from the blood inside the body cavity.

The treatment of internal bleeding is beyond the scope of simple first aid, and should be considered by any first aider to be potentially life threatening.  The definitive treatment for internal bleeding is always surgical treatment, and medical advice must be sought urgently for any victim of internal bleeding.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/injuries_and_poisoning/first_aid/internal_bleeding.html|title=Internal Bleeding: First Aid (Merck Manual online)|accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>
