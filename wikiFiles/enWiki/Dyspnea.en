Dyspnea is distinct from [[labored breathing]], which is a common physical presentation of respiratory distress.{{cn|date=February 2012}}

==Differential diagnosis==
{{See|List of causes of shortness of breath}}
While shortness of breath is generally caused by disorders of the [[cardiovascular system|cardiac]] or [[respiratory system]], other systems such as  [[neurological]],<ref name="ch8139" /> [[musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[Hematopoietic system|hematologic]], and psychiatric may be the cause.<ref name=Sarkar2006>{{cite journal |author=Sarkar S, Amelung PJ |title=Evaluation of the dyspneic patient in the office |journal=Prim. Care |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=643–57 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=17088153 |doi=10.1016/j.pop.2006.06.007 |url=}}</ref> [[DiagnosisPro]], an online medical expert system, listed 497 distinct causes in October 2010.<ref>http://en.diagnosispro.com/differential_diagnosis-for/poisoning-specific-agent-dyspnea/25103-154-100.html</ref> The most common cardiovascular causes are [[acute myocardial infarction]] and [[congestive heart failure]] while common pulmonary causes include [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], [[pneumothorax]],pulmonary edema and [[pneumonia]].<ref name=Shiber06/> On a pathophysiological basis the causes can be divided into: (1) an increased awareness of normal breathing such as during an anxiety attack, (2) an increase in the work of breathing and (3) an abnormality in the ventilatory system.<ref name="ch8139">{{cite book | last1 = Frownfelter | first1 = Donna | last2 = Dean | first2 = Elizabeth | title = Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Physical Therapy | chapter = 8 | volume = 4 | editors = Willy E. Hammon III | publisher = Mosby Elsevier | year = 2006 | pages = 139}}</ref>

===Acute coronary syndrome===
[[Acute coronary syndrome]] frequently presents with retrosternal [[chest pain|chest discomfort]] and difficulty catching the breath.<ref name=Shiber06/> It however may atypically present with shortness of breath alone.<ref name=Old2007/> Risk factors include old age, [[smoking]], [[hypertension]], [[hyperlipidemia]], and [[diabetes]].<ref name=Old2007/> An [[electrocardiogram]] and [[cardiac enzymes]] are important both for diagnosis and directing treatment.<ref name=Old2007/> Treatment involves measures to decrease the oxygen requirement of the heart and efforts to increase blood flow.<ref name=Shiber06/>

===Congestive heart failure===
[[Congestive heart failure]] frequently presents with shortness of breath with exertion, [[orthopnea]], and [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]].<ref name=Shiber06/>  It affects between 1-2% of the general United States population and occurs in 10% of those over 65&nbsp;years old.<ref name=Shiber06/><ref name=Old2007/> Risk factors for [[Acute decompensated heart failure|acute decompensation]] include high dietary [[salt]] intake, medication noncompliance, cardiac ischemia, [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmias]], [[renal failure]], pulmonary emboli, [[hypertension]], and infections.<ref name=Old2007/> Treatment efforts are directed towards decreasing lung congestion.<ref name=Shiber06/>

===Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease===
People with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), most commonly [[emphysema]] or [[chronic bronchitis]], frequently have chronic shortness of breath and a chronic productive cough.<ref name=Shiber06/> An [[Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|acute exacerbation]] presents with increased shortness of breath and [[sputum]] production.<ref name=Shiber06/> [[COPD]] is a risk factor for [[pneumothorax]]; thus this condition should be ruled out.<ref name=Shiber06/> In an acute exacerbation treatment is with a combination of [[anticholinergics]], [[beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists]], [[steroids]] and possibly [[positive pressure ventilation]].<ref name=Shiber06/>

===Asthma===
[[Asthma]] is the most common reason for presenting to the emergency with shortness of breath.<ref name=Shiber06/> It is the most common lung disease in both developing and developed countries affecting about 5% of the population.<ref name=Shiber06/> Other symptoms include [[wheezing]], tightness in the chest, and a non productive cough.<ref name=Shiber06/> 
Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for children, however these drugs can reduce the growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/asthma/treatment.html |title=How Is Asthma Treated and Controlled? |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Acute symptoms are treated with short-acting bronchodilators.

===Pneumothorax===
{{Main|Pneumothorax}}
[[Pneumothorax]] presents typically with [[pleuritic chest pain]] of acute onset and shortness of breath not improved with oxygen.<ref name=Shiber06/> Physical findings may include absent breath sounds on one side of the chest, [[jugular venous distension]], and tracheal deviation.<ref name=Shiber06/>

===Pneumonia===
{{Main|Pneumonia}}
The symptoms of [[pneumonia]] are [[fever]], [[productive cough]], shortness of breath, and [[pleuritic chest pain]].<ref name=Shiber06/> Inspiratory [[crackles]] may be heard on exam.<ref name=Shiber06/> A chest x-ray can be useful to differential pneumonia from congestive heart failure.<ref name=Shiber06/> As the cause is usually a bacterial infections [[antibiotics]] are typically used for treatment.<ref name=Shiber06/>

===Pulmonary embolism===
[[Pulmonary embolism]] classically presents with an acute onset of shortness of breath.<ref name=Shiber06/> Other presenting symptoms include [[pleuritic chest pain]], cough, [[hemoptysis]], and [[fever]].<ref name=Shiber06/> Risk factors include [[deep vein thrombosis]], recent surgery, [[cancer]], and previous [[thromboembolism]].<ref name=Shiber06/> It must always be considered in those with acute onset of shortness of breath owing to its high risk of mortality.<ref name=Shiber06/> Diagnosis however may be difficult.<ref name=Shiber06/> Treatment is typically with [[anticoagulants]].<ref name=Shiber06/>

Pulmonary Edema link to COPD, Asthma and Heart failure.

===Anaemia===
[[Anaemia]] caused by low hemoglobin levels is often a cause of dyspnea.  Menstruation, particularly if excessive, can contribute to anaemia and  to consequential dyspnea in women. Headaches are also a symptom of dyspnea in patients suffering from anaemia, some patients report a numb sensation in their head, and others have reported blurred vision caused by hypotension behind the eye due to a lack of oxygen and pressure, these patients have also reported severe head pain many of which lead to permanent brain damage, symptoms of this can be loss of concentration, focus, fatigue, language faculty impairment and memory loss.

==Pathophysiology==
Different physiological pathways may lead to shortness of breath including via [[chemoreceptor]]s, [[mechanoreceptor]]s, and [[lung receptor]]s.<ref name=Old2007>{{cite journal |author=Torres M, Moayedi S |title=Evaluation of the acutely dyspneic elderly patient |journal=Clin. Geriatr. Med. |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=307–25, vi |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17462519 |doi=10.1016/j.cger.2007.01.007 |url=}}</ref>

It is thought that three main components contribute to dyspnea: afferent signals, efferent signals, and central information processing. It is believed the central processing in the brain compares the afferent and efferent signals; and dyspnea results when a "mismatch" occurs between the two: such as when the need for ventilation (afferent signaling) is not being met by physical breathing (efferent signaling).<ref name=Harrisons /> 

Afferent signals are sensory neuronal signals that ascend to the brain. Afferent neurons significant in dyspnea arise from a large number of sources including the [[carotid bodies]], [[medulla oblongata|medulla]], [[lungs]], and [[chest wall]]. Chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and medulla supply information regarding the blood gas levels of O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup>.  In the lungs, [[juxtacapillary (J) receptors]] are sensitive to pulmonary interstitial edema, while stretch receptors signal bronchoconstriction. [[Muscle spindles]] in the chest wall signal the stretch and tension of the respiratory muscles. Thus, poor ventilation leading to [[hypercapnia]], [[Heart_failure#Left-sided_failure|left heart failure]] leading to interstitial edema (impairing gas exchange), [[asthma]] causing bronchoconstriction (limiting airflow) and muscle fatigue leading to ineffective respiratory muscle action could all contribute to a feeling of dyspnea.<ref name=Harrisons />

Efferent signals are the motor neuronal signals descending to the [[muscles of respiration|respiratory muscles]]. The most important respiratory muscle is the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. Other respiratory muscles include the external and internal [[intercostal muscles]], the abdominal muscles and the accessory breathing muscles. 

As the brain receives its plentiful supply of afferent information relating to ventilation, it is able to compare it to the current level of respiration as determined by the efferent signals. If the level of respiration is inappropriate for the body's status then dyspnea might occur. There is also a psychological component to dyspnea, as some people may become aware of their breathing in such circumstances but not experience the distress typical of dyspnea.<ref name=Harrisons />

The initial approach to evaluation begins by assessment of the [[ABC (medicine)|airway, breathing, and circulation]] followed by a [[medical history]] and [[physical examination]].<ref name=Shiber06/> Signs that represent significant severity include [[hypotension]], [[hypoxemia]], tracheal deviation, altered mental status, unstable [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]], [[stridor]], intercostal indrawing, [[cyanosis]], and absent breath sounds.<ref name=Sarkar2006/>

A number of scales may be used to quantify the degree of shortness of breath.<ref name=Rate2007>{{cite journal |author=Saracino A |title=Review of dyspnoea quantification in the emergency department: is a rating scale for breathlessness suitable for use as an admission prediction tool? |journal=Emerg Med Australas |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=394–404 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17919211 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-6723.2007.00999.x |url=}}</ref> It may be subjectively rated on a scale from 1 to 10 with descriptors associated with the number (The Modified Borg Scale).<ref name=Rate2007/> Alternatively a scale such as the MRC Breathlessness Scale might be used - it suggests five different grades of dyspnea based on the circumstances in which it arises.<ref name=Stenton>{{cite journal |author=Stenton C |title=The MRC breathless scale |journal=Occup Med |year=2008 |volume=58 |pages=226–7 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqm162 |pmid=18441368 |issue=3}}</ref>

===Blood tests===
A number of labs may be helpful in determining the cause of shortness of breath. [[D-dimer]] while useful to rule out a pulmonary embolism in those who are at low risk is not of much value if it is positive as it may be positive in a number of conditions that lead to shortness of breath.<ref name=Old2007/> A low level of [[brain natriuretic peptide]] is useful in ruling out congestive heart failure; however, a high level while supportive of the diagnosis could also be due to advanced age, [[renal failure]], acute coronary syndrome, or a large pulmonary embolism.<ref name=Old2007/>

===Imaging===
A [[chest x-ray]] is useful to confirm or rule out a pneumothorax, [[pulmonary edema]], or pneumonia.<ref name=Old2007/> Spiral [[computed tomography]] with intravenous [[radiocontrast]] is the imaging study of choice to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.<ref name=Old2007/>

==Treatment==
In those who are not [[palliative]] the primary treatment of shortness of breath is directed at its underlying cause.<ref name=Z2009/> Extra [[oxygen]] is effective in those with [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]; however, this has no effect in those with normal [[oxygen saturation|blood oxygen saturation]]s, even in those who are palliative.<ref name=Pal2010/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Abernethy AP |title=Effect of palliative oxygen versus medical (room) air in relieving breathlessness in patients with refractory dyspnea: a double-blind randomized controlled trial |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9743 |pages=784–93 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=20816546 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61115-4 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=McDonald CF |author3=Frith PA |display-authors=3 |last4=Clark |first4=Katherine |last5=Herndon |first5=James E |last6=Marcello |first6=Jennifer |last7=Young |first7=Iven H |last8=Bull |first8=Janet |last9=Wilcock |first9=Andrew |pmc=2962424}}</ref>
