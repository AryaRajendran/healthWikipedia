'''Prevention of diabetes mellitus type 2''' can be achieved with both lifestyle changes and medication use; onset of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] can often be delayed through proper nutrition and regular exercise.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Raina Elley C, Kenealy T |title=Lifestyle interventions reduced the long-term risk of diabetes in adults with impaired glucose tolerance |journal=Evid Based Med |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=173 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19043031 |doi=10.1136/ebm.13.6.173 }}</ref>

A 2005 report concluded that "there is evidence that combined diet and exercise, as well as drug therapy (metformin, acarbose), may be effective at preventing progression to diabetes in IGT ([[Impaired glucose tolerance|Impaired Glucose Tolerance]]) subjects".<ref name=pmid16194123>{{cite journal |author=Santaguida PL, Balion C, Hunt D, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose |journal=Evid Rep Technol Assess (Summ) |issue=128 |pages=1–11 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16194123 |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/impglucose/impglucose.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=19 July 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcindex.htm evidence report]</ref>

==Lifestyle==
Increasing physical activity may be helpful in preventing type 2 diabetes, particularly if undertaken soon after a carbohydrate rich meal that increases blood sugar levels.<ref name=pmid17098085>{{Cite journal | author = Lindström J, Ilanne-Parikka P, Peltonen M, ''et al.'' | title = Sustained reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes by lifestyle intervention: follow-up of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study | journal = The Lancet | volume = 368 | issue = 9548 | pages = 1673–9 | year = 2006 | month = November | pmid = 17098085 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69701-8}}</ref><ref name="Knowler">{{cite journal |author=Knowler WC, Barrett-Connor E, Fowler SE, ''et al.'' |title=Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=346 |issue=6 |pages=393–403 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11832527 |pmc=1370926 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa012512}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61457-4}}</ref> The [[American Diabetes Association]] (ADA) recommends maintaining a healthy weight, getting at least 2½ hours of exercise per week (several brisk sustained walks appear sufficient), having a modest fat intake (around 30% of energy supply should come from fat), and eating sufficient fiber (e.g., from whole grains).

Foods with low [[glycemic index]] rich in fiber and other important nutrients are recommended notwithstanding limited evidence.<ref name=ADA_2008>{{cite pmid|18165339}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bantle JP, Wylie-Rosett J, Albright AL, ''et al.'' |title=Nutrition recommendations and interventions for diabetes—2006: a position statement of the American Diabetes Association |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=2140–57 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16936169 |doi=10.2337/dc06-9914}}</ref>

Study group participants whose "physical activity level and dietary, smoking, and alcohol habits were all in the low-risk group had an 82% lower incidence of diabetes".<ref name="Mozaffarian D, Kamineni A, Carnethon M, Djoussé L, Mukamal KJ, Siscovick D 2009 798–807">{{cite journal |author=Mozaffarian D, Kamineni A, Carnethon M, Djoussé L, Mukamal KJ, Siscovic, D |title=Lifestyle risk factors and new-onset diabetes mellitus in older adults: the cardiovascular health study |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=169 |issue=8 |pages=798–807 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19398692 |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2009.21 |pmc=2828342}}</ref> 

Various sources suggest an influence of dietary fat types. Positive effects of unsaturated fats have been asserted on theoretical grounds and observed in animal feeding studies. Hydrogenated fats are universally considered harmful mainly because of well known effect on cardiovascular risk factors.<ref name=Fat2009>{{cite journal |author=Risérus U, [[Walter Willett|Willett WC]], Hu FB |title=Dietary fats and prevention of type 2 diabetes |journal=Progress in Lipid Research |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=44–51 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19032965 |doi=10.1016/j.plipres.2008.10.002 |pmc=2654180}}</ref>  

High levels of dietary trans-palmitoleic acid (a fatty acid naturally occurring in milk and other dairy products) were found strongly correlated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and reduced cardiovascular risk markers.<ref name=Mozaffarian_2010>{{cite pmid|21173413}}</ref> Overall milk consumption may have a beneficial effect.<ref>

There are numerous studies which suggest connections between some aspects of type 2 diabetes with ingestion of certain foods or with some drugs.

Lowering meat intake may help prevent diabetes, as several studies have found lower incidence among [[vegetarians]].<ref name=pmid19386029>{{cite journal |author=Barnard ND, Katcher HI, Jenkins DJ, Cohen J, Turner-McGrievy G |title=Vegetarian and vegan diets in type 2 diabetes management |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=255–63 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19386029 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00198.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|3985239}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

==Medications==
Some studies have shown delayed progression to diabetes in predisposed patients through prophylactic use of [[metformin]],<ref name="Knowler" /> [[rosiglitazone]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerstein HC, Yusuf S, Bosch J, ''et al.'' |title=Effect of rosiglitazone on the frequency of diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose: a randomised controlled trial |journal=Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9541 |pages=1096–105 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16997664 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69420-8}}</ref> or [[valsartan]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kjeldsen SE, Julius S, Mancia G, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of valsartan compared to amlodipine on preventing type 2 diabetes in high-risk hypertensive patients: the VALUE trial |journal=Journal of Hypertension |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=1405–12 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16794491 |doi=10.1097/01.hjh.0000234122.55895.5b}}</ref> 

Lifestyle interventions are however more effective than metformin at preventing diabetes regardless of weightloss.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Knowler WC, Fowler SE, Hamman RF, ''et al.'' |title=10-year follow-up of diabetes incidence and weight loss in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9702 |pages=1677–86 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19878986 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61457-4 |url= |pmc=3135022}}</ref>

Many other medications are well known to modify risk of diabetes 2 although in most cases they are prescribed for reasons unrelated to diabetes 2. In patients on [[hydroxychloroquine]] for [[rheumatoid arthritis]], incidence of diabetes was reduced by 77% though causal mechanisms are unclear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wasko MC, Hubert HB, Lingala VB, ''et al.'' |title=Hydroxychloroquine and risk of diabetes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=2 |pages=187–93 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17622600 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.2.187}}</ref> Dopamine receptor agonists are also known to improve glycemic control, reduce insulin resistance and help controlling body weight.
