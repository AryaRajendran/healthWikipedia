A '''bronchus''' (plural '''bronchi''', adjective '''bronchial''') is a passage of airway in the [[respiratory tract]] that conducts air into the [[lung]]s. The bronchus branches into smaller tubes, which in turn become [[bronchiole]]s.<ref>{{Cite book

No [[gas exchange]] takes place in this part of the lungs.

The [[Vertebrate trachea#In humans|human trachea]] (windpipe) divides into two main '''bronchi''' (also '''mainstem bronchi'''), the left and the right, at the level of the [[sternal angle]] and of the fifth [[thoracic vertebrae|thoracic vertebra]] or up to two vertebrae higher or lower, depending on breathing, at the anatomical point known as the [[carina of trachea|carina]]. The [[right main bronchus]] is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the [[left main bronchus]].<ref name=Brodsky2003>{{cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=JB|last2=Lemmens|first2=JM|title=Left Double-Lumen Tubes: Clinical Experience With 1,170 Patients|journal=Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia|volume=17|issue=3|pages=289â€“98|year=2003|pmid=12827573|pmc=|doi=10.1016/S1053-0770(03)00046-6|url=http://ether.stanford.edu/library/thoracic_anesthesia/One-Lung%20Ventilation/DLT%20Placement.pdf}}</ref> The right main bronchus subdivides into three [[lobar bronchi]], while the left main bronchus divides into two. The lobar bronchi divide into [[tertiary bronchus|tertiary bronchi]], also known as segmentalinic bronchi, each of which supplies a [[bronchopulmonary segment]].  A bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from the rest of the lung by a [[connective tissue]] [[septum]]. This property allows a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments. There are ten segments per lung, but due to anatomic development, several segmental bronchi in the left lung fuse, giving rise to eight.  The segmental bronchi divide into many primary [[bronchiole]]s which divide into [[terminal bronchiole]]s, each of which then gives rise to several [[respiratory bronchiole]]s, which go on to divide into two to 11 [[alveolar duct]]s. There are five or six [[alveolar sac]]s associated with each alveolar duct.  The [[pulmonary alveolus|alveolus]] is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange in the lung.

The [[hyaline cartilage]] forms an incomplete ring in the bronchi, giving them a "D"-shaped appearance in the larger bronchi and as small plates and islands in the smaller bronchi. [[Smooth muscle]] is present continuously around the bronchi.

In the [[mediastinum]], at the level of the fourth [[thoracic vertebra]], the trachea divides into the right and left primary bronchi. The bronchi branch into smaller and smaller passageways until they terminate in tiny air sacs called alveoli.

The [[cartilage]] and [[mucous membrane]] of the primary bronchi are similar to those in the trachea. As the branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of [[hyaline cartilage]] in the walls decreases until it is absent in the bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a transition from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to simple [[cuboidal epithelium]] to simple [[squamous epithelium]].

The [[alveolar ducts]] and [[alveoli]] consist primarily of simple [[squamous epithelium]], which permits rapid diffusion of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the [[capillaries]] occurs across the walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli.

==Role in disease==
[[Bronchitis]] is defined as inflammation of the bronchi.  There are two main types: acute and chronic.  Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections.  [[Chronic bronchitis]] is a form of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure to irritants. [[Asthma]] is [[bronchial hyperresponsiveness|hyperreactivity of the bronchi]] with an inflammatory component, often in response to [[allergen]]s.

While the left mainstem bronchus departs from the trachea at an angle, the right mainstem bronchus is almost a vertical continuation of the trachea.  This anatomy predisposes the right lung to several problems:
*If food, liquids, or foreign bodies are aspirated, they often will lodge in the right mainstem bronchus.  [[Aspiration pneumonia]] may result.
*If the [[endotracheal tube]] used for [[intubation]] is inserted too far, it usually lodges in the right mainstem bronchus. This allows ventilation of the right lung, but leaves the left lung useless.
