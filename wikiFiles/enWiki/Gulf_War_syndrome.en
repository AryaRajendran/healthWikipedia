==Overview==

[[File:DesertStormMap v2.svg|thumb|right|350px|Summary of the [[Operation Desert Storm]] offensive ground campaign, February 24–28, 1991, by nationality.]]

According to an April 2010 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) sponsored study conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), part of the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], 250,000<ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"/> of the 696,842 U.S. servicemen and women in the 1991 Gulf War continue to suffer from chronic multi-symptom illness, popularly known as "Gulf War Illness" or "Gulf War Syndrome."  The IOM found that the chronic multi-symptom illness continues to affect these veterans nearly 20 years after the war, and, "the excess of unexplained medical symptoms reported by deployed [1991] Gulf war veterans cannot be reliably ascribed to any known [[psychiatric disorder]]."<ref name="books.nap.edu">{{cite book | pages = [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12835&page=109 109] | author = Committee on Gulf War and Health: Health Effects of Serving in the Gulf War | title = Gulf War and Health, Volume 8 - Update of Health Effects of Serving in the Gulf War | publisher = [[National Academies Press]] }}</ref>

According to the IOM, "It is clear that a significant portion of the soldiers deployed to the Gulf War have experienced troubling constellations of symptoms that are difficult to categorize," said committee chair Stephen L. Hauser, professor and chair, department of neurology, [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF).  "Unfortunately, symptoms that cannot be easily quantified are sometimes incorrectly dismissed as insignificant and receive inadequate attention and funding by the medical and scientific establishment. Veterans who continue to suffer from these symptoms deserve the very best that modern science and medicine can offer to speed the development of effective treatments, cures, and—we hope—prevention. Our report suggests a path forward to accomplish this goal, and we believe that through a concerted national effort and rigorous scientific input, answers can be found."<ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"/>

Questions still exist regarding why certain veterans showed, and still show, medically unexplained symptoms while others did not, why symptoms are diverse in some and specific in others, and why combat exposure is not consistently linked to having or not having symptoms.  The lack of data on veterans' pre-deployment and immediate post-deployment health status and lack of measurement and monitoring of the various substances to which veterans may have been exposed make it difficult—and in many cases impossible—to reconstruct what happened to service members during their deployments nearly 20 years after the fact, the committee noted.<ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"/>  The report called for a substantial commitment to improve identification and treatment of multisymptom illness in Gulf War veterans focussing on continued monitoring of Gulf War veterans, improved medical care, examination of genetic differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups and studies of environment-gene interactions.<ref name="www8.nationalacademies.org"/>

Birth defects have been suggested as a consequence of Gulf War deployment.  However, a 2006 review of several studies of international coalition veterans' children found no strong or consistent evidence of an increase in birth defects, finding a modest increase in birth rate defects that was within the range of the general population, in addition to being unable to exclude [[recall bias]] as an explanation for the results.<ref name="DoyleReview">{{cite pmid|16687262}}</ref><ref name = GWV_08_p40>{{harvnb|RAC-GWVI Report|2008|p=40 (PDF p. 50)}}</ref>

==Proposed causes==
The [[United States Congress]] mandated the [[National Academies of Science]] [[Institute of Medicine]] to provide nine reports on Gulf War Syndrome since 1998.<ref>[http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/announcement.asp VA Press Release]</ref>  Aside from the many physical and psychological issues involving any war zone deployment, Gulf War veterans were exposed to a unique mix of hazards not previously experienced during wartime. These included [[pyridostigmine bromide]] pills given to protect troops from the effects of nerve agents, depleted uranium munitions, and [[anthrax vaccine|anthrax]] and [[botulinum]] vaccines. The oil and smoke that spewed for months from hundreds of burning oil wells presented another exposure hazard not previously encountered in a warzone. Military personnel also had to cope with swarms of insects, requiring the widespread use of pesticides. High powered microwaves were used to disrupt Iraqi communications and though it is unknown whether this might have contributed to the syndrome, recent research suggests that safety limits for electromagnetic radiation are too lenient.<ref>[http://www.veterans.senate.gov/hearings.cfm?action=release.display&release_id=a22ac85f-bc73-435f-b78b-3b107a51cf87 Gulf War Illnesses], Testimony to the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee by Meryl Nass, MD on September 25, 2007</ref>

United States Veterans Affairs Secretary [[Anthony Principi]]'s panel found that pre-2005 studies suggested the veterans' illnesses are neurological and apparently are linked to exposure to [[neurotoxins]], such as the nerve gas sarin, the anti-nerve gas drug [[pyridostigmine bromide]], and [[pesticide]]s that affect the nervous system. The review committee concluded that  "Research studies conducted since the war have consistently indicated that psychiatric illness, combat experience or other deployment-related stressors do not explain Gulf War veterans illnesses in the large majority of ill veterans," the review committee said.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/docs/Committee_Documents/ReportandRecommendations_ScientificProgressinUnderstandingGWVI_2004.pdf | author = Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses | format = pdf | month=September |year=2004 | title=Scientific Progress in Understanding Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Report and Recommendations | publisher = United States Department of Veterans Affairs | accessdate = 2012-05-09 }}</ref>

===Pyridostigmine bromide nerve gas antidote===

The US military issued [[pyridostigmine bromide]] (PB) pills to protect against exposure to nerve gas agents such as sarin and [[soman]]. PB was used to pretreat nerve agent poisoning; it is not a vaccine however. Taken before exposure to nerve agents, PB was thought to increase the efficacy of nerve agent antidotes. PB had been used since 1955 for patients suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]] with doses up to 1,500&nbsp;mg a day, far in excess of the 90&nbsp;mg given to soldiers, and was considered safe by the FDA at either level for indefinite use and its use to pre-treat nerve agent exposure had recently been approved.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = PBS Frontline | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | date = 1996-12-01 | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/syndrome/analysis/pyribrom.html  | title = Pyridostigmine bromide use in the First Gulf War }}</ref>

Given both the large body of epidemiological data on myasthenia gravis patients and follow up studies done on veterans it was concluded that while it was unlikely that health effects reported today by Gulf War veterans are the result of exposure solely to PB, use of PB was [[Causality|causally associated]] with illness.<ref name=FedReport/>

===Organophosphate pesticides===
The use of [[organophosphate]] [[pesticides]] and [[DEET|insect repellents]] during the first Gulf War is credited with keeping rates of pest-borne diseases low. Pesticide use is one of only two exposures consistently identified by Gulf War epidemiologic studies to be significantly associated with Gulf War illness.<ref>{{cite book | publisher = [[United States Department of Defense]] | author = Office of the Special Assistant to the Undersecretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) for Gulf War Illnesses Medical Readiness and Military Deployments | title = Environmental Exposure Report: Pesticides Final Report | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2003-04-17 }}</ref> Multisymptom illness profiles similar to Gulf War illness have been associated with low-level pesticide exposures in other human populations. In addition, Gulf War studies have identified dose-response effects, indicating that greater pesticide use is more strongly associated with Gulf War illness than more limited use.<ref>{{cite book | last = Krengel | first = M | coauthors = Sullivan K | title = Neuropsychological Functioning in Gulf War Veterans Exposed to Pesticides and Pyridostigmine Bromide | location = Fort Detrick, MD | publisher = U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command | date = 2008-08-01 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA491742 | accessdate = 2012-05-09 }} W81XWH-04-1-0118</ref> Pesticide use during the Gulf War has also been associated with [[neurocognitive]] deficits and [[neuroendocrine]] alterations in Gulf War veterans in clinical studies conducted following the end of the war. The 2008 report concluded that "all available sources of evidence combine to support a consistent and compelling case that pesticide use during the Gulf War is causally associated with Gulf War illness."<ref name=FedReport/>

===Sarin nerve agent===
[[File:Iraq-gwi-map.jpg|left]]

Many of the symptoms of Gulf War syndrome are similar to the symptoms of organophosphate, [[mustard gas]], and [[nerve gas]] poisoning.<ref name=Friis>{{cite book |title=Epidemiology for Public Health Practice |last=Friis |first=Robert H. |coauthors=Thomas A.

Chemical detection units from Czechoslovakia, France, and Britain confirmed chemical agents. French detection units detected chemical agents. Both Czech and French forces reported detections immediately to U.S. forces. U.S. forces detected, confirmed, and reported chemical agents; and U.S. soldiers were awarded medals for detecting chemical agents. The [[Riegle Report]] said that chemical alarms went off 18,000 times during the Gulf War. After the air war started on January 16, 1991, coalition forces were chronically exposed to low but nonlethal levels of chemical and biological agents released primarily by direct Iraqi attack via [[missile]]s, [[rocket]]s, [[artillery]], or aircraft [[munitions]] and by fallout from allied bombings of Iraqi chemical warfare munitions facilities.<ref>{{citation | title = U.S. Chemical and Biological Warfare-Related Dual Use Exports to Iraq and their Possible Impact on the Health Consequences of the Gulf War | date = 1994-02-09 | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | last = Riegle | first = D.

In 1997, the US Government released an unclassified report that stated, ''"The US Intelligence Community (IC) has assessed that Iraq did not use chemical weapons during the Gulf War. However, based on a comprehensive review of intelligence information and relevant information made available by the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), we conclude that chemical warfare (CW) agent was released as a result of US postwar demolition of rockets with chemical warheads at several sites including Khamisiyah"''. Over 125,000 U.S. troops and 9,000 UK troops were exposed to nerve gas and [[mustard gas]] when the Iraqi depot in Khamisiyah was destroyed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/gulf/cia/970409/cia_wp.html | title = Khamisiyah: A Historical Perspective on Related Intelligence | author = Persian Gulf War Illnesses Task Force | date = 1997-04-09 | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | publisher = [[Federation of American Scientists]] }}</ref>

Recent studies have confirmed earlier suspicions that exposure to sarin, in combination with other contaminants such as pesticides and PB were related to reports of veteran illness. Estimates range from 100,000 to 300,000 individuals exposed to nerve agents.<ref name=Golomb08>{{cite journal |author=Golomb BA |title=Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and Gulf War illnesses |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=11 |pages=4295–300 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18332428 |pmc=2393741 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0711986105}}</ref>

While there are suggestions low-level exposure to nerve agents may be responsible for GWS, 2008 RAC report states that "evidence is inconsistent or limited in important ways".<ref name = RAC11/>

===Chronic inflammation===
The 2008 report on ''Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans'' suggested a possible link between GWS and [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], nonspecific [[inflammation]] of the [[central nervous system]] that cause pain, fatigue and memory issues, possibly due to pathologically persistent increases in [[cytokine]]s and suggested further research be conducted on this issue.<ref name=GWVI_08_p262>{{harvnb|RAC-GWVI Report|2008|p=262 (PDF p. 270)}}</ref>

===Ruled out===
Several potential causes of GWS have been ruled out, including "depleted uranium, anthrax vaccine, fuels, solvents, sand and particulates, infectious diseases, and chemical agent resistant coating".<ref name = RAC11>{{harvnb|RAC-GWVI Report|2008|p=1 (PDF p. 11)}}</ref>

====Oil well fires====
During the war, many [[Kuwaiti oil fires|oil wells were set on fire in Kuwait]] by the retreating Iraqi army, and the smoke from those fires was inhaled by large numbers of soldiers, many of whom suffered acute [[pulmonary]] and other chronic effects, including [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]]. However, firefighters who were assigned to the oil well fires and encountered the smoke, but who did not take part in combat, have not had GWI symptoms.<ref>{{harvnb|RAC-GWVI Minutes|2005|pp=148,154,156}}</ref>  The 2008 RAC report states that "evidence [linking oil well fires to GWS] is inconsistent or limited in important ways".<ref name = RAC11/>


====Depleted uranium====
[[File:GWI DU map.gif|thumb|right|350px|Major Gulf War engagements in which DU rounds were used.]]

[[Depleted uranium]] (DU) was widely used in tank [[kinetic energy penetrator]] and [[autocannon]] [[Shell (projectile)|rounds]] for the first time in the Gulf War<ref name=Globalsecurity>{{cite web | title = Depleted Uranium | publisher = GlobalSecurity.org | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/du.htm | date = nd | accessdate = 2012-05-09 }}</ref> and has been suggested as a possible cause of Gulf War syndrome.<ref name = Jiang>{{cite pmid | 16679544 }}</ref>  A 2008 review by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found no association between DU exposure and multisymptom illness, concluding that "exposure to DU munitions is not likely a primary cause of Gulf War illness". However there are suggestions that long-term exposure to high doses of DU may cause other health problems unrelated to GWS.<ref name="FedReport"/>  in the [[Balkans]] war zone where depleted uranium was also used, no GWS-like symptoms or illnesses have been identified, which is seen as evidence of DU munitions' safety.<ref name=Globalsecurity />  While depleted uranium from [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] fragments has been shown to move into [[Central nervous system|neurological tissues]], this has not been linked to any adverse effects, and comparisons between veterans with embedded DU fragments and those without have not found any consistent differences.  A group of veterans with high levels of uranium in their [[urine]] from embedded particles have been monitored for any adverse health effects of these particles dissolving, and no such effects have been identified.<ref name = Friedl>{{cite pmid | 19485101}}</ref>

====Anthrax vaccine====
Iraq had loaded anthrax, [[botulinum|botulinum toxin]], and [[aflatoxin]] into [[scud|missiles]] and artillery shells in preparing for the Gulf War and that these munitions were deployed to four locations in Iraq.<ref>{{cite book | first = AH | last = Cordesman | title = Iraq and the War of Sanctions: Conventional Threats and Weapons of Mass Destruction | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=qFCkQRQApSwC | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | isbn = 978-0-275-96528-0}}</ref>  During Operation Desert Storm, 41% of U.S. combat soldiers and 75% of UK combat soldiers were vaccinated against anthrax.<ref>{{harvnb|RAC-GWVI Minutes|2005|p=73}}</ref>  Reactions included local skin irritation, some lasting for weeks or months.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0192t.pdf | last = Chan | first = KC | date = 2000-10-11 | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | format = pdf | title = GAO-01-92T Anthrax Vaccine: Preliminary Results of GAO's Survey of Guard/Reserve Pilots and Aircrew Members | publisher = [[Government Accountability Office]] }}</ref> While the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the vaccine, it never went through large-scale clinical trials, unlike most other vaccines in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://orig.clarionledger.com/news/0105/16/m11.html | date = 2001-05-16 | title = Expert: Anthrax vaccine not proven| last = Burdeau | first = C | work = [[The Clarion-Ledger]] }}</ref>  While recent studies have demonstrated the vaccine is highly reactogenic,<ref>{{cite journal |author=McNeil MM, Chiang IS, Wheeling JT, Zhang Y |title=Short-term reactogenicity and gender effect of anthrax vaccine: analysis of a 1967–1972 study and review of the 1955–2005 medical literature |journal=Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=259–74 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17245803 |doi=10.1002/pds.1359 }}</ref> there is no clear evidence or epidemiological studies on Gulf War veterans linking the vaccine to Gulf War Syndrome. Combining this with the lack of symptoms from current deployments of individuals who have received the vaccine led the Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses to conclude that the vaccine is not a likely cause of Gulf War illness for most ill veterans.<ref name=FedReport/>

====Combat stress====
Research studies conducted since the war have consistently indicated that psychiatric illness, combat experience or other deployment-related stressors do not explain Gulf War veterans illnesses in the large majority of ill veterans, according to a [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) review committee.

An April 2010 Institute of Medicine review found, "the excess of unexplained medical symptoms reported by deployed [1991] Gulf war veterans cannot be reliably ascribed to any known psychiatric disorder."<ref name="books.nap.edu"/>

==Diagnosis==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Multisymptom illness is more prevalent in Gulf War I veterans than veterans of previous conflicts, but the pattern of comorbidities is similar for actively deployed and nondeployed military personnel.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kelsall | first1 =   H. L.| author-separator =, | last2 = McKenzie | year = 2009 | first2 = DP | last3 = Sim | first3 = MR | last4 = Leder | first4 = K | last5 = Forbes | first5 = AB | last6 = Dwyer | first6 = T | title = Physical, psychological, and functional comorbidities of multisymptom illness in Australian male veterans of the 1991 Gulf War | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 170 | issue = 8| pages = 1048–56 | pmid = 19762370 | doi=10.1093/aje/kwp238}}</ref>

==Epidemiologic research==
Epidemiologic studies have been performed evaluating many suspected [[Etiology (medicine)|etiologic]] factors for Gulf War illness as seen in veteran populations. Below is a summary of epidemiologic studies of veterans displaying multisymptom illness and their exposure to suspect conditions from the 2008 U.S. Veterans Administration report.<ref>{{harvnb|RAC-GWVI Report|2008|pp=220–1}}</ref>

A fuller understanding of immune function in ill Gulf War veterans is needed, particularly in veteran subgroups with different clinical characteristics and exposure histories. It is also important to determine the extent to which identified immune perturbations may be associated with altered neurological and endocrine processes that are associated with immune regulation.<ref name=GWVI_08_p262/> Very limited cancer data have been reported for U.S. Gulf War veterans in general, and no published research on cases occurring after 1999. Because of the extended latency periods associated with most cancers, it is important that cancer information be brought up to date and that cancer rates be assessed in Gulf War veterans on an ongoing basis. In addition, cancer rates should be evaluated in relation to identifiable exposure and location subgroups.<ref>{{harvnb|RAC-GWVI Report|2008|p=45 (PDF p. 55)}}</ref>

Similar syndromes have been seen as an after effect of other conflicts &mdash; for example, '[[shell shock]]' after [[World War I]], and ''[[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD)'' after the [[Vietnam War]]. A review of the medical records of 15,000 [[American Civil War]] soldiers showed that "those who lost at least 5% of their company had a 51% increased risk of later development of cardiac, gastrointestinal, or nervous disease."<ref name="Enserink2001">{{cite doi|10.1126/science.291.5505.812}}</ref>

A November 1996 article in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] found no difference in death rates, hospitalization rates or self-reported symptoms between Persian Gulf veterans and non-Persian Gulf veterans. This article was a compilation of dozens of individual studies involving tens of thousands of veterans. The study did find a statistically significant elevation in the number of traffic accidents suffered by Gulf War veterans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Campion EW |title=Disease and suspicion after the Persian Gulf War |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=335 |issue=20 |pages=1525–7 |year=1996 |month=November |pmid=8890106 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199611143352010}}</ref> An April, 1998 article in Emerging Infectious Diseases similarly found no increased rate of hospitalization and better health overall for veterans of the Persian Gulf War in comparison to those who stayed home.<ref name=pmid_9621191>{{cite journal |author=Knoke JD, Gray GC |title=Hospitalizations for unexplained illnesses among U.S. veterans of the Persian Gulf War |journal=Emerging Infect.

Despite these studies, on November 17, 2008, a congressionally appointed committee called the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, staffed with independent scientists and veterans appointed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, announced that the syndrome is a distinct physical condition. The committee recommended that Congress increase funding for research on Gulf War veterans' health to at least $60 million per year.<ref name = CNN>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/11/17/gulf.war.illness.study/index.html | title = Gulf War illness is real, new federal report says | publisher = [[CNN]] | last = Silverleib | first = A | date = 2008-12-09 | accessdate = 2012-05-09 }}</ref> In January 2006, a study led by Melvin Blanchard and published by the ''[[Journal of Epidemiology]]'', part of the "National Health Survey of Gulf War-Era Veterans and Their Families", stated that veterans deployed in the Persian Gulf War had nearly twice the prevalence of chronic multisymptom illness, a cluster of symptoms similar to a set of conditions often called Gulf War Syndrome.<ref>{{cite web | url =  http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/6377.html | title = Study finds multisymptom condition is more prevalent among Persian Gulf vets | date = 2006-01-20 | last = Purdy | first = MC | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | publisher = [[Washington University in St. Louis]] }}</ref>
