'''Hypocholesterolemia''' is the presence of abnormally low (''hypo-'') levels of [[cholesterol]] in the [[blood]] (''-emia''). Although the presence of ''high'' total cholesterol ([[hypercholesterolemia|''hyper''-cholesterolemia]]) correlates with [[cardiovascular disease]], a defect in the body's production of cholesterol can lead to adverse consequences as well. Cholesterol is an essential component of mammalian cell membranes and is required to establish proper membrane permeability and fluidity. It is not clear if a lower than average cholesterol level is directly harmful; it is often encountered in particular illnesses.

==Classification==
According to the American Heart Association in 1994, only total cholesterol levels below 160&nbsp;mg/dL or 4.1&nbsp;mmol/l are to be classified as "hypocholesterolemia".<ref name=Criqui>Criqui MH. (1994). Very Low Cholesterol and Cholesterol Lowering. Leaflet 71-0059. American Heart Association.</ref> However, this is not agreed on universally and some put the level lower.

==Causes==
Possible causes of low cholesterol are:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
*[[statins]]
*[[hyperthyroidism]], or an overactive thyroid gland
*[[adrenal insufficiency]]
*[[liver disease]]
*[[malabsorption]] (inadequate absorption of nutrients from the [[intestines]]), such as in [[celiac disease]]
*[[malnutrition]]
*[[abetalipoproteinemia]] - a rare genetic disease that causes cholesterol readings below 50&nbsp;mg/dl. It is found mostly in [[Jewish]] populations.
*[[hypobetalipoproteinemia]] - a genetic disease that causes cholesterol readings below 50&nbsp;mg/dl
*[[Manganese deficiency (medicine)|manganese deficiency]]
*[[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]]
*[[Marfan syndrome]]
*[[leukemia]]s and other hematological diseases<ref name="pmid2496554">{{cite journal |author=Marini A, Carulli G, Azzarà A, Grassi B, Ambrogi F |title=Serum cholesterol and triglycerides in hematological malignancies |journal=Acta Haematol. |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=75–9 |year=1989 |pmid=2496554 |doi=10.1159/000205530}}</ref>

==Role in disease==
With the increased use of medication to suppress cholesterol, some have expressed concern that lowering cholesterol levels excessively will itself cause disease.

===Specific disease entities===
Demographic studies suggest that cholesterol levels form an U-shape curve when plotted against mortality; this suggests that low cholesterol is associated with increased mortality, mainly due to [[clinical depression|depression]], [[cancer]], [[cerebral hemorrhage|hemorrhagic stroke]], [[aortic dissection]] and respiratory diseases.<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite journal |author=Jacobs D, Blackburn H, Higgins M, ''et al.'' |title=Report of the Conference on Low Blood Cholesterol: Mortality Associations |journal=Circulation |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=1046–60 |year=1992 |pmid=1355411 |doi=}}</ref> It is possible that whatever causes the low cholesterol level also causes mortality, and that the low cholesterol is simply a marker of poor health.<ref name=Criqui/>

Links with depression have been supported by studies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Suarez EC |title=Relations of trait depression and anxiety to low lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in healthy young adult women |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=273–9 |date=1 May 1999|pmid=10367605 |url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/full/61/3/273 }}</ref> In contrast, no evidence was found for a link with hemorrhagic stroke (although higher cholesterol levels conferred a relative protection), and neither did statin drugs worsen the risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Woo D, Kissela BM, Khoury JC, ''et al.'' |title=Hypercholesterolemia, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage: a case-control study |journal=Stroke |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=1360–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15087556 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000127786.16612.A4 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/35/6/1360}}</ref>

The [[Heart Protection Study]] found no increase in either respiratory disease or neuropsychiatric illness in a large trial population taking a statin drug.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin in 20,536 high-risk individuals: a randomised placebo-controlled trial |journal=Lancet |volume=360 |issue=9326 |pages=7–22 |year=2002 |pmid=12114036|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09327-3 |author1= Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group}}</ref>

===Elderly===
In the elderly, low cholesterol may confer a health risk that may not be offset by the beneficial effects of cholesterol lowering.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schatz IJ, Masaki K, Yano K, Chen R, Rodriguez BL, Curb JD |title=Cholesterol and all-cause mortality in elderly people from the Honolulu Heart Program: a cohort study |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9279 |pages=351–5 |year=2001 |pmid=11502313 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05553-2}}</ref> Similarly, for elderly patients admitted to hospital, low cholesterol may predict short-term mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Onder G, Landi F, Volpato S, ''et al.'' |title=Serum cholesterol levels and in-hospital mortality in the elderly |journal=Am.

===Critical illness===
In the setting of critical illness, low cholesterol levels are predictive of clinical deterioration, and are correlated with altered [[cytokine]] levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gordon BR, Parker TS, Levine DM, ''et al.'' |title=Relationship of hypolipidemia to cytokine concentrations and outcomes in critically ill surgical patients |journal=Crit.
