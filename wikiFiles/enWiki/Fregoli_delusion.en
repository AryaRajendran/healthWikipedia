The '''Fregoli delusion''', or '''the delusion of doubles''', is a rare disorder in which a person holds a [[delusion]]al belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. The syndrome may be related to a brain lesion{{fact|date=December 2012}} and is often of a [[paranoia|paranoid]] nature with the delusional person believing themselves [[persecution|persecuted]] by the person they believe is in disguise.

A person with the Fregoli delusion can also inaccurately{{fact|date=December 2012}} replicate places, objects, and events. This disorder can be explained by "associative nodes." The associative nodes serve as a biological link of information about other people with a particular familiar face (to the patient){{fact|date=December 2012}}. This means that for any face that is similar to a recognizable face to the patient, the patient will recall that face as the person they know.<ref> Tibbetts, Paul.

The Fregoli delusion is classed both as a [[monothematic delusion]], since it only encompasses one delusional topic, and as a [[delusional misidentification syndrome]], a class of delusional beliefs that involves misidentifying people, places, or objects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mojtabai R |title=Fregoli syndrome |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=458–62 |year=1994 |month=September |pmid=7893241 |doi=10.3109/00048679409075874 }}</ref> Like [[Capgras delusion]], psychiatrists believe it is related to a breakdown in normal [[face perception]].

==History of Fregoli syndrome==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:fregoli.jpg|thumb|alt=Fregoli acting in different personas.|Fregoli taking on different personas.]] -->
The condition is named after the Italian actor [[Leopoldo Fregoli]], who was renowned for his ability to make quick changes of appearance during his stage act. 

P. Courbon and G. Fail first reported the condition in a 1927 paper (''Syndrome d'illusion de Frégoli et schizophrénie'').<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ellis HD, Whitley J, Luauté JP |title=Delusional misidentification.

===Delusional misidentification syndromes and Fregoli===
[[Delusional_misidentification_syndrome|Delusional misidentification syndromes]] (DMS) are rooted in the inability to register the identity of something, whether it is an object, event, place or even a person. There are various forms of DMS, such as the [[syndrome of subjective doubles]], [[intermetamorphosis]], [[Capgras syndrome]] and Fregoli syndrome. However, all of these various syndromes have a common denominator: they are all due to malfunctional familiarity processing during information processing. The most common syndromes are Capgras and Fregoli. Capgras syndrome is the delusional belief that a friend, family member, etc., has been replaced by a twin impostor. Fregoli syndrome is the delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who is in disguise. Other commonalities among these syndromes are that they are discriminatory in which object(s) are misidentified. Lastly, [[dopamine]] hyperactivity is evident in all DMSs and thus, all syndromes utilize [[antipsychotic]] medications to help control DMS.

===Coexistence of Capgras and Fregoli===
[[Delusional misidentification syndrome]]s (DMSs) are four types of syndromes: the syndrome of subjective doubles, the syndrome of [[intermetamorphosis]], [[Fregoli syndrome]] and  [[Capgras delusion|Capgras syndrome]]. Of the four, Fregoli syndrome is the least frequent, followed by Capgras. Of more rarity is the coexistence of both Fregoli and Capgras syndromes. Coexistence of DMSs are enhanced when coupled with other mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. [[Depersonalization]] and [[derealization]] symptoms are usually manifested in patients exhibiting two misidentification delusions. However, such symptoms have been witnessed to cease once the coexisting DMSs are fully developed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lykouras L, Typaldou M, Gournellis R, Vaslamatzis G, Christodoulou GN |title=Coexistence of Capgras and Frégoli syndromes in a single patient.

* deficit in [[cognitive flexibility]]
* history of seizure activity
* [[epileptogenic]] activity

==Treatment==
=== Drug treatment options ===

Once it has been positively identified, [[pharmacotherapy]] follows. Antipsychotic drugs are the frontrunners in treatment for Fregoli and other DMSs. In addition to [[antipsychotics]], [[anticonvulsants]] and [[antidepressants]] are also prescribed in some treatment courses. If a Fregoli patient has other psychological disorders, treatment often results in the use of [[trifluperazine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silva JA, Leong GB, Miller AL |title=Delusional misidentification syndromes — Drug treatment options |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=89–102 |year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=McAllister TW, Ferrell RB |title=Evaluation and treatment of psychosis after traumatic brain injury |journal=NeuroRehabilitation |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=357–68 |year=2002 |pmid=12547983 |url=http://iospress.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=1053-8135&volume=17&issue=4&spage=357}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Christodoulou GN |title=Treatment of the "syndrome of doubles" |journal=Acta Psychiatr Belg |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=254–9 |year=1977 |pmid=20738 }}</ref>

==Causes==
===Levodopa treatment===
[[Levodopa]], also known as L-DOPA, is the precursor to several [[catecholamines]], specifically of [[dopamine]], [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. It is clinically used to treat [[Parkinson's disease]] and dopamine-responsive [[dystonia]]. Clinical studies have shown that the use of levodopa can lead to visual hallucinations and delusions. In most patients, delusions were more salient than hallucinations. Over prolonged use of levodopa, the delusions almost occupy all of a patient's attention. In experimental studies, when the concentration of levodopa decreases, the number of reported delusions decreases as well. It has been concluded that delusions related to [[antiparkinsonian]] medications are one of the leading causes of Fregoli syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stewart JT |title=Frégoli syndrome associated with levodopa treatment |journal=Mov. Disord. |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=308–9 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18044770 |doi=10.1002/mds.21843}}</ref>

===Traumatic brain injury===
Injury to the right [[frontal_cortex|frontal]] and left [[temporal_cortex|temporo]]-[[Parietal lobe|parietal]] areas can cause Fregoli syndrome. Research by Feinberg, et al. have shown that significant deficits in executive and memory functions follow shortly after damage in the right frontal or left temporoparietal areas. Tests performed on patients that have suffered from a brain injury revealed that basic attention ability and [[Visual perception|visuomotor]] processing speed are typically normal. However, these patients made many errors when they were called to participate in detailed attention tasks. Selective attention tests involving [[Sound|auditory]] targets were also performed, and brain-injured patients had many errors; this meant that they were deficient in their response regulation and inhibition.

The most profound finding in Feinberg et al.'s paper is that performance tests on the [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]] process of memory was significantly damaged in brain-injured patients. They found, however, that these patients chose incorrect answers that were related [[semantically]] (i.e., chose vegetable instead of fruit). More importantly, tests of visual memory showed that there was a severe inability in visual recollection. Overall, brain-injured patients were severely impaired in many executive functions such as [[self-monitoring]], [[cognitive_flexibility|mental flexibility]], and social reasoning.

Fregoli syndrome is an illusion of positive doubles where there is an over-familiarity with the environment. This over-familiarity may have four causes:
* impaired self monitoring — passive acceptance of inaccurate conclusions
* faulty filtering — tendency to select salient associations rather than a relevant one
* [[mnemonic]] association from routine thoughts
* [[perseveration]] — unable to come up with an alternate hypothesis

Thus, executive dysfunction appears to be necessary to identify one as having Fregoli's syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Feinberg TE, Eaton LA, Roane DM, Giacino JT |title=Multiple Fregoli delusions after traumatic brain injury |journal=Cortex |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=373–87 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10440075 |doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70806-2 }}</ref><ref>Pires-Barata, S., Gois, J. P., & da Silva, M. H. T. (2008). Fregoli's syndrome and traumatic brain injury.</ref>

===Fusiform gyrus===
{{Main|Fusiform gyrus}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: Gryus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An image of the brain and the location of the fusiform gyrus.|Depiction of the brain and the location of the fusiform gyrus (green) close to the visual area (red).]] -->
Current research has shown that lesions in the right [[temporal lobe]] and the [[fusiform gyrus]] may contribute to DMSs. MRIs of patients exemplifying Fregoli symptoms have shown [[parahippocampus|parahippocampal]] and [[hippocampal]] damage in the anterior fusiform gyrus, as well as the middle and inferior of the right temporal gyri. The inferior and medial of the right temporal gyri are the storage locations for long-term memory in retrieving information on visual recognition, specifically of faces; thus, damage to these intricate connections could be one of the leading factors in face misidentification disorders.

Recently, a face-specific area in the fusiform gyrus has been discovered and is close to the anterior fusiform gyrus. MRI studies performed by Hudson, et al. have shown lesions in the [[anterior fusiform gyrus]], which is close to the [[Ventral_fusiform_cortex|face specific area]] (ventral fusiform cortex), may also be associated with Fregoli syndrome and other DMSs. Such damage may cause disruption in long-term visual memory and lead to improper associations of human faces.

On another note, our brains interpret visual scenes in two pathways: one is via the [[Parietal lobe]]-[[:wikt:occipital|occipital]] [[Dorsal_stream|dorsal pathway]] (visual spatial material is analyzed here), and the other is via the [[temporal cortex|temporal]]-occipital [[Ventral_stream|ventral pathway]] (recognizes objects and faces). Thus, lesions in either structures or disruption of delicate connections may produce DMSs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hudson AJ, Grace GM |title=Misidentification syndromes related to face specific area in the fusiform gyrus |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=645–8 |year=2000 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.69.5.645 |pmid=11032619 |pmc=1763428}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Perez-Martinez DA, Porta-Etessam J  |title=Higher visual integration abnormalities, illusions and visual hallucinations |journal=Neurologia |volume= |issue= |pages=34–41 |year=2007}}</ref>

===Abnormal P300===
Delusional misidentification syndrome is thought to occur due to a dissociation between identification and recognition processes. The integration of information for further processing is referred to as [[working memory]] (WM). The [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] (P stands for positive voltage potential and the 300 for the 300-millisecond poststimulus) is an index of WM and is used during a WM test in DMS patients. In comparison to normal patients, DMS patients generally exhibit an attenuated amplitude of P300 at many abductions. These patients also exhibit prolonged latencies of P300 at all abductions. These implications suggest that DMSs are accompanied by abnormal WM, specifically affecting the [[prefrontal cortex]] (both outside and inside).

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tablepic.jpg|thumb|alt=A table of data showing low P300 amplitudes for Fregoli patients.|In the study performed by Papageorgiou, et. al., they found that Fregoli patients have much lower P300 amplitudes than healthy patients. Above is a table of this data]] -->
Past studies have shown correlations between DMS and damages to the right-hemispheric function, which has an array of functions (insight, 3D shapes, art awareness, imagination, left-hand control, music awareness, etc.). In recent years, the P300 auditory component, which forms in response to a detection task that occurs a short time after a stimulus, has acquired a great deal of recognition. The P300 component is an index of mental activity in that its amplitude increases highly with increased stimuli. This P300 component is correlated with updating the working memory to what is expected in the environment. Other findings enhance the belief that defects in the working memory are associated with DMS. Papageorgio et al.'s paper, psychological evidence for altered information processing in delusional misidentification syndromes, hypothesized that electrophysiological brain activity in the working memory and P300 component can help identify the mechanisms of DMS. Thus, they concentrated on P300 released during a working memory test in DMS patients. 

Papageorgio et al. also found that DMS patients had a lower P300 amplitude in the right hemisphere compared to the control group (non-DMS patients). From this result, the researchers implied that shorter P300 amplitudes are highly correlated with [[gray matter]] abnormalities; this finding is consistent with the DMS patients' characteristics and the presence of gray-matter deterioration. DMS patients were also found to have prolonged P300 lag, and their memory performance was lower than the control groups. The researchers were, thus, able to imply that DMS patients have trouble in focusing their resources to a stimulus; this was hypothesized to be caused by the [[neurodegeneration]] of the right hemisphere. Overall, other research studies have also provided evidence in the correlation of DMS and gray-matter degeneration of the right frontal region, which controls attentional resources.  This research is important, because it can help determine the mechanisms of DMS, which can then help conjure a more effective target drug and/or treatment plan for those suffering from DMS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Papageorgiou C, Lykouras L, Ventouras E, Uzunoglu N, Christodoulou GN |title=Abnormal P300 in a case of delusional misidentification with coinciding Capgras and Frégoli symptoms |journal=Prog.

==Current research==
The study of DMS currently remains controversial{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, as they are often coupled with many psychological disorders (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc.). Although there is a plethora of information on DMS, there are still many mysteries of the physiological and anatomical details of DMS. An accurate [[semiological]] analysis of higher visual anomalies and their corresponding topographic sites may help elucidate the aetiology of Fregoli's and other misidentification disorders.
