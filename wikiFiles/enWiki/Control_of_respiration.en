'''Control of ventilation''' refers to the [[physiology|physiological]] mechanisms involved in the control of [[ventilation (physiology)|physiologic ventilation]]. Gas exchange primarily controls the rate of respiration.

The most important function of [[breath]]ing is gas exchange (of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]). Thus the control of respiration is centered primarily on how well this is achieved by the [[lungs]].

There are four main centers in the brain to regulate the respiration:
1. Inspiratory center
2. Expiratory center
3. Pneumotaxic center
4. Apneustic center
The first two centers are present on the medulla oblongata whereas the last two centers on the pons region of brain.
== Ventilatory Pattern ==

The pattern of motor stimuli during breathing can be divided into inspiratory and expiratory phases. Inspiration shows a sudden, ramped increase in motor discharge to the inspiratory muscles (including pharyngeal dilator muscles). Before the end of inspiration, there is a decline in motor discharge. Exhalation is usually silent, except at high [[minute ventilation]] rates.

The mechanism of generation of the ventilatory pattern is not completely understood, but involves the integration of neural signals by respiratory control centers in the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]] and [[pons]]. The nuclei known to be involved are divided into regions known as the following:
* medulla ([[reticular formation]])
** [[ventral respiratory group]] (nucleus retroambigualis, [[nucleus ambigus]], nucleus parambigualis and the [[pre-Bötzinger complex]]). The ventral respiratory group controls voluntary forced exhalation and acts to increase the force of inspiration.
** [[dorsal respiratory group]] ([[nucleus tractus solitarius]]). The dorsal respiratory group controls mostly inspiratory movements and their timing.
* pons
** [[pneumotaxic center]].
*** Coordinates transition between inhalation and exhalation
*** Sends inhibitory impulses to the inspiratory area
*** The pneumotaxic center is involved in fine tuning of respiration rate.
** [[apneustic center]]
*** Coordinates transition between inhalation and exhalation
*** Sends stimulatory impulses to the inspiratory area – activates and prolongs inhalate (long deep breaths)
*** overridden by pneumotaxic control from the apneustic area to end inspiration

There is further integration in the [[Anterior horn of spinal cord|anterior horn]] cells of the [[spinal cord]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Control of ventilatory pattern ==
Ventilation is normally controlled by the [[autonomic nervous system]], with only limited voluntary override.  An exception to this is [[Ondine's curse]], where autonomic control is lost.

== Determinants of ventilatory rate ==

Ventilatory rate (minute volume) is tightly controlled and determined primarily by blood levels of [[carbon dioxide]] as determined by [[metabolic rate]]. Blood levels of [[oxygen]] become important in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. These levels are sensed by [[chemoreceptor]]s in the [[medulla oblongata]] for pH, and the [[carotid body|carotid]] and [[aortic body|aortic]] bodies for oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Afferent neurons from the carotid bodies and aortic bodies are via the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX) and the [[vagus nerve]] (CN X), respectively. 

Levels of CO<sub>2</sub> rise in the blood when the metabolic use of O<sub>2</sub> is increased beyond the capacity of the lungs to expel CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is stored largely in the blood as bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions, by conversion first to carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and then by disassociation of this acid to H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Build-up of CO<sub>2</sub> therefore causes an equivalent build-up of the disassociated hydrogen ion, which, by definition, decreases the pH of  the blood.

During moderate [[exercise]], ventilation increases in proportion to [[metabolism|metabolic]] production of carbon dioxide. During strenuous exercise, ventilation increases more than needed to compensate for carbon dioxide production. Increased glycolysis facilitates release of protons from ATP and metabolites lower [[pH]] and thus increase breathing.

Mechanical stimulation of the lungs can trigger certain reflexes as discovered in animal studies. In humans, these seem to be more important in neonates and ventilated patients, but of little relevance in health. The tone of respiratory muscle is believed to be modulated by [[muscle spindle]]s via a reflex arc involving the spinal cord. 

Drugs can greatly influence the control of respiration. [[Opioids]] and anaesthetic drugs tend to depress ventilation, especially with regards to [[carbon dioxide]] response. Stimulants such as [[amphetamines]] can cause [[hyperventilation]].

[[Pregnancy]] tends to increase ventilation (lowering plasma carbon dioxide tension below normal values). This is due to increased [[progesterone]] levels and results in enhanced gas exchange in the [[placenta]].

Ventilation is temporarily modified by voluntary acts and complex reflexes such as sneezing, straining, burping, coughing and vomiting.

== Feedback control ==
[[sensory receptor|Receptor]]s play important roles in the regulation of respiration; central and peripheral [[chemoreceptor]]s, and [[mechanoreceptor]]s.

* '''[[Central chemoreceptors]]''' of the central nervous system, located on the ventrolateral medullary surface, are sensitive to the [[pH]] of their environment.<ref name="Coates">Coates EL, Li A, Nattie EE. Widespread sites of brain stem ventilatory chemoreceptors. J Appl Physiol. 75(1):5-14, 1984.</ref><ref name="Cordovez">Cordovez JM, Clausen C, Moore LC, Solomon, IC. A mathematical model of pH(i) regulation in central CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreception. Adv Exp Med Biol. 605:306-11, 2008.</ref>

* '''[[Peripheral chemoreceptors]]''' act most importantly to detect variation of the [[oxygen]] in the [[arterial blood]], in addition to detecting arterial carbon dioxide and pH.

* '''[[Mechanoreceptors]]''' are located in the [[airway]]s and [[parenchyma]], and are responsible for a variety of reflex responses.  These include:
** The [[Hering-Breuer reflex]] that terminates inspiration to prevent over inflation of the lungs, and the reflex responses of [[coughing]], [[airway constriction]], and [[hyperventilation]].
** The upper airway receptors are responsible for reflex responses such as, [[sneezing]], coughing, closure of [[glottis]], and [[hiccups]].
** The [[spinal cord]] reflex responses include the activation of additional respiratory muscles as compensation, gasping response, hypoventilation, and an increase in breathing frequency and volume.
** The nasopulmonary and nasothoracic [[reflex]]es regulate the mechanism of breathing through deepening the inhale. Triggered by the flow of the air, the pressure of the air in the [[nose]], and the quality of the air, impulses from the nasal mucosa are transmitted by the trigeminal nerve to the breathing centres in the [[brainstem]], and the generated response is transmitted to the [[bronchus|bronchi]], the [[intercostal muscles]] and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].

In addition to involuntary control of respiration by the respiratory center, respiration can be affected by conditions such as emotional state, via input from the [[limbic system]], or [[temperature]], via the [[hypothalamus]].  Voluntary control of respiration is provided via the [[cerebral cortex]], although chemoreceptor reflex is capable of overriding conscious control.
