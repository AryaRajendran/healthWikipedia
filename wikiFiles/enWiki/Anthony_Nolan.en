'''Anthony Nolan''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Charitable organization|charity]] that focuses on [[leukaemia]] and [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]]. It manages and recruits donors to the Anthony Nolan Register, one of the three [[bone marrow]] registers in the United Kingdom. The other registries are the ''British Bone Marrow Registry'' run by the [[National Blood Service]] and the ''Welsh Bone Marrow Donor Registry'' run by the Welsh Blood Service. It also carries out research to help make bone marrow transplants more effective.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.anthonynolan.org/What-we-do.aspx | title=What we do | publisher=Anthony Nolan | accessdate=2010-07-30 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100715080240/http://www.anthonynolan.org/What-we-do.aspx| archivedate= 15 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The charity is named after Anthony Nolan (born 1971, died 1979), who did not suffer from leukaemia but from [[Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome]], a rare inherited blood disorder.<ref name="Our History">{{ cite web | url=http://www.anthonynolan.org/Who-we-are/Our-history.aspx | title=Our History | publisher= Anthony Nolan | accessdate=2010-07-30 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100715080257/http://www.anthonynolan.org/Who-we-are/Our-history.aspx| archivedate= 15 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It was founded by Anthony's mother Shirley (1942–2002) in 1974 as the "Anthony Nolan Register".<ref name="Our History" /> Initially based at the [[Chelsea and Westminster Hospital|Westminster Children's Hospital]], it moved to [[St Mary Abbot's Hospital]] in 1978 and to its present offices, laboratory and research institute in north London, in the grounds of the Royal Free Hospital.<ref name="Our History" /> The charity was renamed in 2001 to the "Anthony Nolan Trust".<ref name="Our History" /> and again in 2010 to "Anthony Nolan".<ref name="Our History" />

It is a priority for Anthony Nolan to recruit more male donors because men can generally provide greater volumes of blood stem cells than female donors. This helps faster engraftment and the reconstitution of the immune system post-transplant. If there is a choice of donor for a patient in most cases a male donor will be preferred.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.anthonynolan.org/Home/FAQs.aspx | title=FAQs | publisher=Anthony Nolan | accessdate=2010-07-30 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100801020553/http://www.anthonynolan.org/Home/FAQs.aspx| archivedate= 1 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is also the only register in the UK to allow gay men to join, subject to their normal criteria for inclusion.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/campaigns/sign-up-for-sudders/2008/06/02/mark-s-signing-up-for-our-campaign-86081-21008541/ | title=Mark’s signing up for our campaign | author=Katie Campling | publisher=[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]] | date=2008-06-02 | accessdate=2008-06-19 }}</ref>

A student organisation operating in universities throughout the UK known as ''[[Marrow (student organisation)|Marrow]]'' works with Anthony Nolan to raise awareness of the charity and blood cancers within universities and their local communities. It was set up in 1998 at [[Nottingham University]] and is now in 39 universities in the UK and worldwide.

The [[Midland Metro]] has a [[tram]] named after Anthony Nolan.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://archive.cravenherald.co.uk/2004/5/21/100497.html | title=Zahier appeal brings boost to donor register | publisher=[[Telegraph & Argus]] | date=2004-05-21 | accessdate=2008-06-18 }}</ref>

[[Daniel De Gale]] (1987–2008), a leukaemia patient, inspired his mother Beverley and her partner, Orin Lewis, to set up the [[African-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust]] in June 1996. ACLT worked "in partnership with the ... Nolan Trust" to build the number of bone marrow donors, specifically of African, African Caribbean, and mixed parentage on the UK register.<ref name=CG01>Truman, Peter, [http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/3743949.Leukaemia_campaigner_Daniel_De_Gale_dies/ "Leukaemia campaigner Daniel De Gale dies"], ''Croydon Guardian'', 9 October 2008 3:09pm. Retrieved 2011-02-18.</ref>

The Nolan trust organizes several novel campaigns to increase the number of donors joining the registry. For example, the Noal trust organized the Spit and Save a life campaign<ref>{{cite web|title=Spit to save a life|url=http://www.anthonynolan.org/News/Patient-Appeal--Harrow.aspx|publisher=Anthony Nolan|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref>  in 2010 which featured [[Devaanshi Mehta]] (1996-2012), an aplastic anemia patient. During the campaign, donors could join the registry and find out if they could save a life by simply giving a sample of their saliva.
