The '''oculocardiac reflex''', also known as '''Aschner phenomenon''', '''Aschner reflex''', or '''Aschner-Dagnini reflex''', is a decrease in [[pulse rate]] associated with [[traction]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=March 2012}} applied to [[extraocular muscles]] and/or compression of the [[human eyeball|eyeball]]. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the [[trigeminal cranial nerve]] via the [[ciliary ganglion]], and the [[vagus nerve]] of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. Nerve fibres  from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve have also been documented.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lang S, Lanigan D, van der Wal M | title = Trigeminocardiac reflexes: maxillary and mandibular variants of the oculocardiac reflex. | journal = Can J Anaesth | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 757–60 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1914059 | doi = 10.1007/BF03008454}}</ref> These afferents synapse with the [[visceral motor nucleus]] of the vagus nerve, located in the [[reticular formation]] of the brain stem. The efferent portion is carried by the vagus nerve from the [[cardiovascular center]] of the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] to the heart, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the [[sinoatrial node]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Paton J, Boscan P, Pickering A, Nalivaiko E | title = The yin and yang of cardiac autonomic control: vago-sympathetic interactions revisited. | journal = Brain Res Brain Res Rev | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 555–65 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16269319 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2005.02.005}}</ref> This reflex is especially sensitive in [[neonates]] and children, particularly during [[strabismus]] correction surgery.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kim H, Kim S, Kim C, Yum M | title = Prediction of the oculocardiac reflex from pre-operative linear and nonlinear heart rate dynamics in children. | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 55 | issue = 9 | pages = 847–52 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10947746 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2044.2000.01158.x}}</ref> However, this reflex may also occur with adults.

==Treatment/prophylaxis==

The reflex can be blocked by injecting peribulbar or retrobulbar local anesthetics prior to stimulation, or with intravenous injection of an [[anti-muscarinic]] [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]], such as [[atropine]] or glycopyrrolate.  If bradycardia does occur, removal of the stimulus is immediately indicated. This often results in the restoration of normal sinus rhythm of the heart. If not, the use of atropine or glycopyrrolate will usually be successful and permit continuation of the surgical procedure. In extreme cases, such as asystole, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] may be required.
