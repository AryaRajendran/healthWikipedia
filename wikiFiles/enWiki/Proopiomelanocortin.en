'''Pro-opiomelanocortin''' ('''POMC''') is a precursor [[polypeptide]] with 241 [[amino acid]] residues. POMC is synthesized from the 285-amino acid long polypeptide precursor, pre-pro-opiomelanocortin (pre-POMC), by the removal of a 44-amino acid long signal peptide sequence during translation.

The POMC gene is located on chromosome 2p23.3. The POMC gene is expressed in both the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. This gene encodes a 285-amino acid polypeptide hormone precursor that undergoes extensive, tissue-specific, post-translational processing via cleavage by [[subtilisin]]-like enzymes known as [[Proprotein convertase|prohormone convertases]]. The encoded protein is synthesized mainly in [[corticotrope|corticotroph]] cells of the anterior [[pituitary]] where four cleavage sites are used; [[adrenocorticotropic hormone|adrenocorticotrophin]] (ACTH), essential for normal [[steroidogenesis]] and the maintenance of normal adrenal weight, and [[lipotropin|β-lipotropin]] are the major end products. However, there are at least eight potential cleavage sites within the polypeptide precursor and, depending on tissue type and the available convertases, processing may yield as many as ten biologically active peptides involved in diverse cellular functions. Cleavage sites consist of the sequences, Arg-Lys, Lys-Arg or Lys-Lys. Enzymes responsible for processing of POMC peptides include [[prohormone convertase 1]] (PC1), [[prohormone convertase 2]] (PC2), [[carboxypeptidase E]] (CPE), [[peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase|peptidyl α-amidating monooxygenase]] (PAM), [[N-acetyltransferase|''N''-acetyltransferase]] (N-AT), and [[PRCP|prolylcarboxypeptidase]] (PRCP).

The processing of POMC involves glycosylations, acetylations, and extensive proteolytic cleavage at sites shown to contain regions of basic protein sequences. However, the proteases that recognize these cleavage sites are tissue-specific. In some tissues, including the [[hypothalamus]], [[placenta]], and [[epithelium]], all cleavage sites may be used, giving rise to peptides with roles in pain and energy [[homeostasis]], [[melanocyte]] stimulation, and immune modulation. These include several distinct [[melanotropin]]s, [[lipotropin]]s, and [[endorphin]]s that are contained within the adrenocorticotrophin and β-lipotropin peptides.

Mutations in this gene have been associated with early onset [[obesity]], [[adrenal insufficiency]], and [[red hair]] [[pigmentation]]. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: POMC proopiomelanocortin (adrenocorticotropin/ beta-lipotropin/ alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone/ beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone/ beta-endorphin)| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=5443| accessdate = }}</ref><ref name=doi.10.1371/journal.pgen.1002543>{{cite journal|last=Kuehnen|first=Peter|coauthors=Mischke, Mona, Wiegand, Susanna, Sers, Christine, Horsthemke, Bernhard, Lau, Susanne, Keil, Thomas, Lee, Young-Ae, Grueters, Annette, Krude, Heiko, Yeo, Giles S.

== Production ==

It is synthesized by:

* [[Corticotrope]] cells of the [[anterior pituitary]] gland
* [[Melanotrope]] cells of the [[intermediate lobe]] of the [[pituitary]] gland
* 3,148±62 neurons in the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]]<ref>Cowley et al, Leptin activates anorexigenic POMC neurons through a neural network in the arcuate nucleus, Nature. 2001 May 24;411(6836):480-4.</ref>
* Smaller populations of neurons in the [[dorsomedial hypothalamus]] and [[brainstem]]
* [[Melanocytes]] in the skin

== Derivatives ==
{{POMC}}

The large molecule of POMC is the source of several important biologically active substances. POMC can be cleaved enzymatically into the following [[peptides]]:

* [[N-Terminal peptide of proopiomelanocortin|''N''-Terminal Peptide of Proopiomelanocortin]] (NPP, or pro-γ-MSH)
* [[Melanocyte-stimulating hormone|γ-Melanotropin]] (γ-MSH)
* [[Corticotropin]] (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, or ACTH)
* [[Melanocyte-stimulating hormone|α-Melanotropin]] (α-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone, or α-MSH)
* [[Corticotropin-like_intermediate_peptide|Corticotropin-like Intermediate Peptide]] (CLIP)
* [[Lipotropin#Beta-lipotropin|β-Lipotropin]] (β-LPH)
* [[Lipotropin|Lipotropin Gamma]] (γ-LPH)
* [[Melanocyte-stimulating hormone|β-Melanotropin]] (β-MSH)
* [[Beta-endorphin|β-Endorphin]]
* [[Met-Enkephalin|[Met]Enkephalin]]

Although the N-terminal 5 amino acids of [[β-endorphin]] are identical to the sequence of [Met]enkephalin, it is not generally thought that β-endorphin is converted into [Met]enkephalin. Instead, [Met]enkephalin is produced from its own precursor, [[proenkephalin A]].

The production of [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone|β-MSH]] occurs in humans but not in mice or rats due to the absence of the enzymatic processing site in the rodent POMC.

== Function ==

Each of these peptides is packaged in large dense-core [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] that are released from the cells by [[exocytosis]] in response to appropriate stimulation:

* α-MSH produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus has important roles in the regulation of [[appetite]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]], while α-MSH secreted from the intermediate lobe of the pituitary regulates the production of [[melanin]].
* ACTH is a peptide hormone that regulates the secretion of [[glucocorticoids]] from the [[adrenal cortex]].
* [[β-endorphin]] and [Met]enkephalin are endogenous [[opioid peptides]] with widespread actions in the brain.

== Interactions ==

Proopiomelanocortin has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with [[Melanocortin 4 receptor]].<ref name=pmid11101306>{{cite journal |last=Yang |first=Y K |authorlink= |coauthors=Fong T M, Dickinson C J, Mao C, Li J Y, Tota M R, Mosley R, Van Der Ploeg L H, Gantz I |date=December 2000|title=Molecular determinants of ligand binding to the human melanocortin-4 receptor |journal=Biochemistry |volume=39 |issue=48 |pages=14900–11 |publisher= |location = UNITED STATES| issn = 0006-2960| pmid = 11101306 | bibcode = | oclc =| id = | url = | language = | format = | accessdate = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote = |doi=10.1021/bi001684q }}</ref><ref name=pmid9058374>{{cite journal |last=Yang |first=Y K |authorlink= |coauthors=Ollmann M M, Wilson B D, Dickinson C, Yamada T, Barsh G S, Gantz I |date=March 1997|title=Effects of recombinant agouti-signaling protein on melanocortin action |journal=Mol.
