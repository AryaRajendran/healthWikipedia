'''Atypical pneumonia''', also known as '''walking pneumonia''', is an atypical [[pneumonia]] not caused by one of the more traditional pathogens. Its clinical presentation contrasts to that of "typical" pneumonia. A variety of [[microorganism]]s can cause it. When it develops independently from another disease it is called '''primary atypical pneumonia''' (PAP).

The term was introduced in the 1930s<ref name='Walter'>{{cite journal |author=Walter C, McCoy MD |title=Primary atypical pneumonia: A report of 420 cases with one fatality during twenty-seven month at Station Hospital, Camp Rucker, Alabama |journal=Southern Medical Journal |volume=39 |issue=9 |page=696 |year=1946 |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=info:B1yIRrr44H0J:scholar.google.com/&output=viewport}}</ref><ref>{{EMedicine|article|363083|Pneumonia, Atypical Bacterial}}</ref>
and was contrasted with the [[bacterial pneumonia]] caused by ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', at that time the best known and most commonly occurring form of pneumonia. The distinction was historically considered important as it differentiated those more likely to present with "typical" respiratory symptoms and [[lobar pneumonia]] from those more likely to present with "atypical" generalized symptoms (such as [[fever]], [[headache]], and [[myalgia]]) and [[bronchopneumonia]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|360090|Pneumonia, Typical Bacterial}}</ref> 

Distinction between atypical and typical pneumonia, however, is medically insufficient. For the treatment of pneumonia it is important to know the exact causal organism. Moreover, ''S. pneumoniae'' has become a relatively less important cause.

==Terminology==

"Primary atypical pneumonia" is called ''primary'' because it develops independently of other diseases.<br />
"Atypical pneumonia" is ''atypical'' in that it is caused by atypical organisms (other than ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]'').<ref>{{cite journal |author=Memish ZA, Ahmed QA, Arabi YM, Shibl AM, Niederman MS |title=Microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in the Gulf Corporation Council states |journal=Journal of Chemotherapy |volume=19 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=17–23 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=18073166 |url=http://www.jchemother.it/cgi-bin/digisuite.exe/searchresult?range=pubmed&volume=19%20Suppl%201&year=2007&firstpage=17}}</ref>
These atypical organisms include special [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]]. In addition, this form of pneumonia is atypical in presentation with only moderate amounts of sputum, no consolidation, only small increases in white cell counts, and no alveolar exudate.<ref name='ddb'>Diseases Database [http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/result.asp?glngUserChoice=1132&bytRel=2&blnBW=0&strBB=RL&blnClassSort=255 ''Causes of atypical pneumonia'']</ref><ref name=Cunha06/>
At the time that atypical pneumonia was described first, organisms like [[Mycoplasma]], [[Chlamydophila]], and [[Legionella]] still were not recognized as bacteria and instead considered as viruses. Hence "atypical pneumonia" was also called "non-bacterial".<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000084218|Primary atypical pneumonia}}</ref> In literature the term ''atypical pneumonia'' (contrasted with ''bacterial pneumonia'') is still in use, though incorrect.
Meanwhile, many of such organisms are identified as bacteria, albeit unusual types (''Mycoplasma'' is a type of bacteria without a [[cell wall]] and ''Chlamydias'' are intracellular parasites). As the conditions caused by these agents have different courses and respond to different treatments, the identification of the specific causative pathogen is important.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Usually the atypical causes also involve atypical symptoms:

*No responding on common antibiotics as [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]<ref name='bragg'/> and [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactams]] like [[penicillin]].
*No signs and symptoms of lobar consolidation,<ref name="pmid17114771">{{cite journal |author=Gouriet F, Drancourt M, Raoult D |title=Multiplexed serology in atypical bacterial pneumonia |journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. |volume=1078 |pages=530–40 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17114771 |doi=10.1196/annals.1374.104 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0077-8923&date=2006&volume=1078&spage=530}}</ref><ref name="pmid10983928">{{cite journal |author=Hindiyeh M, Carroll KC |title=Laboratory diagnosis of atypical pneumonia |journal=Semin Respir Infect |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=101–13 |year=2000 |month=June |pmid=10983928 |doi= 10.1053/srin.2000.9592|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0882054600000372}}</ref> meaning that the infection is restricted to small areas, rather than involving a whole lobe. As the disease progresses, however, the look can tend to [[lobar pneumonia]].
*Absence of [[leukocytosis]].
*Extrapulmonary symptoms, related to the causing organism.<ref name=Cunha06>{{cite journal |author=Cunha BA |title=The atypical pneumonias: clinical diagnosis and importance |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Infect. |volume=12 |issue=Suppl 3 |pages=12–24 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16669925 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2006.01393.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1198-743X&date=2006&volume=12&issue=&spage=12}}</ref>
*Moderate amount of sputum, or no sputum at all (i.e. non-productive).
*Lack of alveolar exudate.<ref>p714, ''Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease'' 8th edition, Kumar et al, Philadelphia 2010</ref>
*Despite general [[symptom]]s and problems with the [[upper respiratory tract]] (such as high fever, headache, a dry irritating cough followed later by a productive cough with radiographs showing [[Consolidation (medicine)|consolidation]]), there are in general few physical signs. The patient looks better than the symptoms suggest.<ref name='Walter'/><ref name='bragg'/>

==Cause==
The most common causative organisms are (often [[intracellular parasite|intracellular]] living) bacteria:<ref name=Cunha06/>

;''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'': Mild form of pneumonia with relatively mild symptoms.

;''[[Chlamydia psittaci]]'': Causes [[psittacosis]].

;''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'': Causes [[Q fever]].

;''[[Francisella tularensis]]'': Causes [[tularemia]].

;''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'': Causes a severe form of pneumonia with a relatively high mortality rate, known as [[legionellosis]] or Legionnaires' disease.

;''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'':<ref>{{MeshName|MYCOPLASMA+PNEUMONIAE}}</ref> Usually occurs in younger age groups and may be associated with neurological and systemic (e.g. rashes) symptoms.

Atypical pneumonia can also have a fungal, protozoan or viral cause.<ref>[http://www.diseasesdatabase.com/result.asp?glngUserChoice=1132&bytRel=2&blnBW=0&strBB=RL&blnClassSort=255 Diseases Database]</ref><ref name="pmid14653964">{{cite journal |author=Tang YW |title=Molecular diagnostics of atypical pneumonia |journal=Acta Pharmacol.

However, newer techniques aid in the definitive identification of the pathogen, which may lead to more individualized treatment plans.

===Viral===

When comparing the bacterial-caused atypical pneumonias with these caused by real viruses (excluding bacteria that were wrongly considered as viruses), the term "atypical pneumonia" almost always implies a bacterial etiology{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and is contrasted with [[viral pneumonia]]. 

Known viral causes of atypical pneumonia include [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|Respiratory Syncytial Virus]] (RSV), [[Influenza]] A and B, [[Parainfluenza]], [[Adenovirus]], [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_15/en/ |title=Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) — multi-country outbreak |accessdate=2008-12-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081207045343/http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_15/en/| archivedate= 7 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
and [[measles]].<ref name='ddb'/>

== Diagnosis ==

[[Chest radiograph]]s (X-ray photographs) often show a pulmonary infection before physical signs of atypical pneumonia are observable at all.<ref name='bragg'/>
This is called [[occult pneumonia]]. In general, occult pneumonia is rather often present in patients with pneumonia and can also be caused by ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', as the decrease of occult pneumonia after vaccination of children with a pneumococcal vaccine suggests.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murphy CG, van de Pol AC, Harper MB, Bachur RG |title=Clinical predictors of occult pneumonia in the febrile child |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=243–9 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17242382 |doi=10.1197/j.aem.2006.08.022 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1069-6563&date=2007&volume=14&issue=3&spage=243}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rutman MS, Bachur R, Harper MB |title=Radiographic pneumonia in young, highly febrile children with leukocytosis before and after universal conjugate pneumococcal vaccination |journal=Pediatric Emergency Care |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19116501 |doi=10.1097/PEC.0b013e318191dab2}}</ref>

[[Infiltration (medical)|Infiltration]] commonly begins in the perihilar region (where the [[bronchus]] begins) and spreads in a wedge- or fan-shaped fashion toward the periphery of the lung field. The process most often involves the lower lobe, but may affect any lobe or combination of lobes.<ref name='bragg'>{{cite journal |author=Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases, Fort Bragg, North Carolina |title=Primary Atypical Pneumonia |journal=American Journal of Public Health and the Nations Health |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=347–357 |date=April 1944 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.34.4.347 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/34/4/347.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==

Mycoplasma is found more often in younger than in older people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schneeberger PM, Dorigo-Zetsma JW, van der Zee A, van Bon M, van Opstal JL |title=Diagnosis of atypical pathogens in patients hospitalized with community-acquired respiratory infection |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=269–73 |year=2004 |pmid=15198183 |doi=10.1080/00365540410020127}}</ref><ref name='nhlbi'>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, U.S.A.
