'''Carpal tunnel syndrome''' ('''CTS''') is a [[median nerve|median]] [[entrapment neuropathy|entrapment]] [[neuropathy]], that causes [[paresthesia]], [[pain]], numbness, and other symptoms in the distribution of the [[median nerve]] due to its compression at the wrist in the [[carpal tunnel]]. The pathophysiology is not completely understood but can be considered compression of the [[median nerve]] traveling through the [[carpal tunnel]].<ref name="uptodate.com"/> It appears to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.<ref name=McC2012>{{cite journal|last=McCartan|first=B|coauthors=Ashby, E; Taylor, EJ; Haddad, FS|title=Carpal tunnel syndrome.|journal=British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)|date=2012 Apr|volume=73|issue=4|pages=199–202|pmid=22585195}}</ref> Some of the predisposing factors include: [[diabetes]], [[obesity]], pregnancy, [[hypothyroidism]], and heavy manual work or work with vibrating tools.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Untreated Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.JPG|thumb|Untreated carpal tunnel syndrome]] People with CTS experience numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the thumb and fingers, in particular the index, middle fingers, and radial half of the ring fingers, which are innervated by the median nerve. Less-specific symptoms may include [[wrist pain|pain in the wrists]] or hands and loss of grip strength<ref name=Atroshi_1999>{{cite journal |last1=Atroshi |first1=I. |last2=Gummesson |first2=C |last3=Johnsson |first3=R |last4=Ornstein |first4=E |last5=Ranstam |first5=J |last6=Ros�n |first6=I |title=Prevalence of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in a General Population |journal=JAMA |volume=282 |issue=2 |pages=153–158 |year=1999 |pmid=10411196 |doi=10.1001/jama.282.2.153}}</ref> (both of which are more characteristic of painful conditions such as [[arthritis]]).

Some posit that median nerve symptoms can arise from compression at the level of the thoracic outlet or the area where the median nerve passes between the two heads of the pronator teres in the forearm,<ref>{{cite book|last=Netter|first=Frank|title=Atlas of Human Anatomy|year=2011|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-8089-2423-4|pages=412, 417, 435|edition=5th}}</ref> but this is highly debatable.  This line of thinking is an attempt to explain pain and other symptoms not characteristic of carpal tunnel syndrome.<ref name=CTS_2009>{{cite web |title=Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Information Page |date=December 28, 2010 |publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/carpal_tunnel/carpal_tunnel.htm}}</ref>  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common diagnosis with an objective, reliable, verifiable pathophysiology, whereas thoracic outlet syndrome and pronator syndrome are defined by a lack of verifiable pathophysiology and are usually applied in the context of nonspecific upper extremity pain.

Numbness and paresthesias in the median nerve distribution are the hallmark neuropathic symptoms (NS) of carpal tunnel entrapment syndrome. Weakness and [[atrophy]] of the thenar muscles may occur if the condition remains untreated.<ref name=Lazaro_1997>{{cite journal |last1=Lazaro |first1=R |title=Neuropathic symptoms and musculoskeletal pain in carpal tunnel syndrome: Prognostic and therapeutic implications |journal=Surgical Neurology |volume=47 |pages=115–7; discussion 117–9 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0090-3019(95)00457-2 |issue=2}}</ref>

==Causes==
Most cases of CTS are of unknown causes, or [[idiopathic]].<ref name=BOOSternbach_1999>{{cite journal |last1=Sternbach |first1=G |title=The carpal tunnel syndrome |journal=Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=519–23 |year=1999 |pmid=10338251 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(99)00030-X}}</ref> Carpal Tunnel Syndrome can be associated with any condition that causes pressure on the median nerve at the wrist. Some common conditions that can lead to CTS include obesity, oral contraceptives, hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance), and trauma.<ref name=Katz_2002>{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Jeffrey N. |last2=Simmons |first2=Barry P. |title=Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=346 |issue=23 |pages=1807–12 |year=2002 |pmid=12050342 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp013018}}</ref> Carpal tunnel is also a feature of a form of [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome]] type 1 called hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.

Other causes of this condition include intrinsic factors that exert pressure within the tunnel, and extrinsic factors (pressure exerted from outside the tunnel), which include benign tumors such as [[lipomas]], [[ganglion]], and [[vascular malformation]].<ref name=Tiong_2005>{{cite journal |last1=Tiong |first1=W.

===Work related===
The international debate regarding the relationship between CTS and repetitive motion in work is ongoing. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has adopted rules and regulations regarding cumulative trauma disorders. Occupational risk factors of repetitive tasks, force, posture, and vibration have been cited. However, the [[American Society for Surgery of the Hand]] (ASSH) has issued a statement claiming that the current literature does not support a causal relationship between specific work activities and the development of diseases such as CTS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assh.org/Public/HandConditions/Pages/CarpalTunnelSyndrome.aspx |title=Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |publisher=Assh.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05}}</ref>

The relationship between work and CTS is controversial; in many locations, workers diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome are entitled to time off and compensation.<ref name=Derebery_2006>{{cite journal |pages=353–67, viii |doi=10.1016/j.coem.2005.11.014}}</ref> In the USA, carpal tunnel syndrome results in an average of $30,000 in lifetime costs (medical bills and lost time  from work).<ref name=NINDS_2009>{{cite web |author=Office of Communications and Public Liaison |title=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |date=December 18, 2009 |url =http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/carpal_tunnel/detail_carpal_tunnel.htm
}}</ref>

Some speculate that carpal tunnel syndrome is provoked by repetitive movement and manipulating activities and that the exposure can be cumulative. It has also been stated that symptoms are commonly exacerbated by forceful and repetitive use of the hand and wrists in industrial occupations,<ref name=Werner_2006>{{cite journal |last1=Werner |first1=Robert A. |title=Evaluation of Work-Related Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |journal=Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation |volume=16 |page=201 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s10926-006-9026-3 |pmid=16705490 |issue=2}}</ref> but it is unclear as to whether this refers to pain (which may not be due to carpal tunnel syndrome) or the more typical numbness symptoms.<ref name="Graham 2587–2593">{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=B.|title=The Value Added by Electrodiagnostic Testing in the Diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome|journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|date=1 December 2008|volume=90|issue=12|pages=2587–2593|doi=10.2106/JBJS.G.01362|pmid=19047703}}</ref>

A review of available scientific data by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) indicated that job tasks that involve highly repetitive manual acts or specific wrist postures were associated with incidents of CTS, but causation was not established, and the distinction from work-related arm pains that are not carpal tunnel syndrome was not clear. It has been proposed that repetitive use of the arm can affect the [[biomechanics]] of the upper limb or cause damage to tissues. It has also been proposed that postural and spinal assessment along with ergonomic assessments should be included in the overall determination of the condition.  Addressing these factors has been found to improve comfort in some studies.<ref name=Cole_2006>{{cite journal |last1=Cole |first1=Donald C. |last2=Hogg-Johnson |first2=Sheilah |last3=Manno |first3=Michael |last4=Ibrahim |first4=Selahadin |last5=Wells |first5=Richard P. |last6=Ferrier |first6=Sue E. |author7=Worksite Upper Extremity Research Group |title=Reducing musculoskeletal burden through ergonomic program implementation in a large newspaper |journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=98–108 |year=2006 |pmid=16736193 |doi=10.1007/s00420-006-0107-6}}</ref>

Speculation that CTS is work-related is based on claims such as CTS being found mostly in the working adult population, though evidence is lacking for this.  For instance, in one recent representative series of a consecutive experience, most patients were older and not working.<ref>{{cite journal|last=LOZANOCALDERON|first=S|coauthors=PAIVA, A, RING, D|title=Patient Satisfaction After Open Carpal Tunnel Release Correlates With Depression|journal=The Journal of Hand Surgery|date=1 March 2008|volume=33|issue=3|pages=303–307|doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2007.11.025|pmid=18343281}}</ref>  Based on the claimed increased incidence in the workplace, arm use is implicated, but the weight of evidence suggests that this is an inherent, genetic, slowly but inevitably progressive idiopathic peripheral mononeuropathy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=LOZANOCALDERON|first=S|coauthors=ANTHONY, S, RING, D|title=The Quality and Strength of Evidence for Etiology: Example of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome|journal=The Journal of Hand Surgery|date=1 April 2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=525–538|doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2008.01.004|pmid=18406957}}</ref>

===Associated conditions===
A variety of patient factors can lead to CTS, including heredity, size of the carpal tunnel, associated local and systematic diseases, and certain habits.<ref name="uptodate.com">{{cite web |first1=Kevin R. |last1=Scott |first2=Milind J. |last2=Kothari |date=October 5, 2009 |title=Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome |publisher=[[UpToDate]] |url=http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~wx2xecoDuYz0gp}}</ref> Non-traumatic causes generally happen over a period of time, and are not triggered by one certain event. Many of these factors are manifestations of physiologic aging.<ref name=Stevens_1992>{{cite journal |author=Stevens JC, Beard CM, O'Fallon WM, Kurland LT |title=Conditions associated with carpal tunnel syndrome |journal=Mayo Clin Proc|volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=541–548 |year=1992 |pmid=1434881}}</ref>

Examples include:
* Rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases that cause inflammation of the flexor tendons.
* With [[hypothyroidism]], generalized [[myxedema]] causes deposition of [[mucopolysaccharides]] within both the perineurium of the median nerve, as well as the tendons passing through the carpal tunnel.
* During pregnancy women experience CTS due to hormonal changes (high progesterone levels) and water retention (which swells the [[synovium]]), which are common during pregnancy.
* Previous injuries including fractures of the wrist.
* Medical disorders that lead to fluid retention or are associated with inflammation such as: inflammatory arthritis, Colles' fracture, [[amyloidosis]], hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, acromegaly, and use of corticosteroids and estrogens.
* Carpal tunnel syndrome is also associated with repetitive activities of the hand and wrist, in particular with a combination of forceful and repetitive activities<ref name="Katz_2002"/>
* [[Acromegaly]] causes excessive [[growth hormone]]s. This causes the soft tissues and bones around the carpel tunnel to grow and compress the median nerve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treatmentandsymptoms.com/endocrine/acromegaly/ |title=Carpel Tunnel Syndrome in Acromegaly |publisher=Treatmentandsymptoms.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-05}}</ref>
* [[Tumor]]s (usually benign), such as a [[ganglion]] or a [[lipoma]], can protrude into the carpal tunnel, reducing the amount of space. This is exceedingly rare (less than 1%).
* [[Obesity]] also increases the risk of CTS: individuals classified as obese ([[Body mass index|BMI]] > 29) are 2.5 times more likely than slender individuals (BMI < 20) to be diagnosed with CTS.<ref name=Werner_1994>{{cite journal |last1=Werner |first1=Robert A. |last2=Albers |first2=James W. |last3=Franzblau |first3=Alfred |last4=Armstrong |first4=Thomas J. |title=The relationship between body mass index and the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome |journal=Muscle & Nerve |volume=17 |pages=632–6 |year=1994 |doi=10.1002/mus.880170610 |issue=6}}</ref>
* ''Double-crush syndrome'' is a debated hypothesis that compression or irritation of nerve branches contributing to the median nerve in the neck, or anywhere above the wrist, increases sensitivity of the nerve to compression in the wrist. There is little evidence, however, that this syndrome really exists.<ref name=Wilbourn_1997>{{cite journal |author=Wilbourn AJ, Gilliatt RW|title=Double-crush syndrome: a critical analysis |journal=Neurology|volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=21–27 |year=1997 |pmid= 9222165}}</ref>
* Heterozygous mutations in the gene [[SH3TC2]], associated with [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth]], confer susceptibility to [[neuropathy]], including the carpal tunnel syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lupski |first1=James R. |last2=Reid |first2=Jeffrey G. |last3=Gonzaga-Jauregui |first3=Claudia |last4=Rio Deiros |first4=David |last5=Chen |first5=David C.Y. |last6=Nazareth |first6=Lynne |last7=Bainbridge |first7=Matthew |last8=Dinh |first8=Huyen |last9=Jing |first9=Chyn |title=Whole-Genome Sequencing in a Patient with Charcot–Marie–Tooth Neuropathy |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=362 |issue=13 |pages=1181–91 |year=2010 |pmid=20220177 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0908094}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
There is no consensus reference standard for the diagnosis of carpal  tunnel syndrome.  A combination of described symptoms, clinical findings, and [[electrophysiological]] testing is used by a majority of hand surgeons.  Numbness in the distribution of the median nerve, nocturnal symptoms, thenar muscle weakness/atrophy, positive Tinel's sign at the carpal tunnel, and abnormal sensory testing such as two-point discrimination have been standardized as clinical diagnostic criteria by consensus panels of experts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rempel|first=D|coauthors=Evanoff B, Amadio PC, et al|title=Consensus criteria for the classification of carpal tunnel syndrome in epidemiologic studies|journal=Am J Public Health|year=1998|volume=88|issue=10|pages=1447–1451|pmid=9772842|doi=10.2105/AJPH.88.10.1447}}</ref><ref name="Graham consensus">{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=B|coauthors=Regehr G, Naglie G, Wright JG|title=Development and validation of diagnostic criteria for carpal tunnel syndrome|journal=Journal of Hand Surgery|year=2006|volume=31A|issue=6|pages=919–924}}</ref>  A predominance of pain rather than numbness is unlikely to be caused by carpal tunnel syndrome no matter what the result of electrophysiological testing.

Electrodiagnostic testing (electromyography and nerve conduction velocity) can objectively verify the median nerve dysfunction.  If these tests are normal, carpal tunnel syndrome is either absent or very, very mild.

Clinical assessment by history taking and physical examination can support a diagnosis of CTS.

* [[Phalen's maneuver]] is performed by flexing the wrist gently as far as possible, then holding this position and awaiting symptoms.<ref name=Harrison>{{cite book | author = Cush JJ, Lipsky PE | chapter = Approach to articular and musculoskeletal disorders |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = 16th | page= 2035 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-07-140235-7 }}</ref> A positive test is one that results in numbness in the median nerve distribution when holding the wrist in acute flexion position within 60 seconds. The quicker the numbness starts, the more advanced the condition. Phalen's sign is defined as pain and/or paresthesias in the median-innervated fingers with one minute of wrist flexion. Only this test has been shown to correlate with CTS severity when studied prospectively.<ref name="uptodate.com"/>

* [[Tinel's sign]], a classic&nbsp;— though less sensitive - test is a way to detect irritated nerves. Tinel's is performed by lightly tapping the skin over the [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]] to elicit a sensation of tingling or "pins and needles" in the nerve distribution. Tinel's sign (pain and/or paresthesias of the median-innervated fingers with percussion over the median nerve) is less sensitive, but slightly more specific than Phalen's sign.<ref name="uptodate.com"/>

* [[Durkan test]], ''carpal compression test'', or applying firm pressure to the palm over the nerve for up to 30 seconds to elicit symptoms has also been proposed.<ref name=Gonzalez_1997>{{cite journal |last1=Gonzalezdelpino |first1=J |last2=Delgadomartinez |first2=A |last3=Gonzalezgonzalez |first3=I |last4=Lovic |first4=A |title=Value of the carpal compression test in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome |journal=The Journal of Hand Surgery: Journal of the British Society for Surgery of the Hand |volume=22 |pages=38–41 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0266-7681(97)80012-5}}</ref><ref name=Durkan_1991>{{cite journal |last1=Durkan |first1=JA |title=A new diagnostic test for carpal tunnel syndrome |journal=The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=535–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1796937}}</ref>

As a note, a patient with true carpal tunnel syndrome (entrapment of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel) will not have any sensory loss over the thenar eminence (bulge of muscles in the palm of hand and at the base of the thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, branches off of the median nerve and passes over the carpal tunnel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Netter|first=Frank|title=Atlas of Human Anatomy|year=2011|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-8089-2423-4|page=447|edition=5th}}</ref> This feature of the median nerve can help separate carpal tunnel syndrome from thoracic outlet syndrome, or pronator teres syndrome.

Other conditions may also be misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome. Thus, if history and physical examination suggest CTS, patients will sometimes be tested electrodiagnostically with [[Nerve conduction study|nerve conduction studies]] and [[electromyography]]. The goal of electrodiagnostic testing is to compare the speed of conduction in the median nerve with conduction in other nerves supplying the hand.  When the median nerve is compressed, as in CTS, it will conduct more slowly than normal and more slowly than other nerves.  There are many electrodiagnostic tests used to make a diagnosis of CTS, but the most sensitive, specific, and reliable test is the [[Combined Sensory Index]] (also known as [[Robinson index]]).<ref name=Robinson_2007>{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=L |title=Electrodiagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |journal=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America |volume=18 |pages=733–46 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.pmr.2007.07.008 |issue=4}}</ref>  Electrodiagnosis rests upon demonstrating impaired median nerve conduction across the carpal tunnel in context of normal conduction elsewhere. Compression results in damage to the myelin sheath and manifests as delayed latencies and slowed conduction velocities <ref name="uptodate.com"/>  However, normal electrodiagnostic studies do not preclude the presence of carpal tunnel syndrome, as a threshold of nerve injury must be reached before study results become abnormal and cut-off values for abnormality are variable.<ref name="Graham consensus" />  Carpal tunnel syndrome with normal electrodiagnostic tests is very, very mild at worst.

The role of [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] or [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is unclear.<ref name=Wilder-Smith_2006>{{cite journal |last1=Wilder-Smith |first1=Einar P |last2=Seet |first2=Raymond C S |last3=Lim |first3=Erle C H |title=Diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome—clinical criteria and ancillary tests |journal=Nature Clinical Practice Neurology |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=366–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16932587 |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0216}}</ref><ref name=Bland_2005>{{cite journal |last1=Bland |first1=Jeremy DP |title=Carpal tunnel syndrome |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=581–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16155444 |doi=10.1097/01.wco.0000173142.58068.5a}}</ref><ref name=Jarvik_2004>{{cite journal |last1=Jarvik |first1=J |last2=Yuen |first2=E |last3=Kliot |first3=M |title=Diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome: electrodiagnostic and MR imaging evaluation |journal=Neuroimaging Clinics of North America |volume=14 |pages=93–102, viii |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.nic.2004.02.002}}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
There are some who believe that carpal tunnel syndrome is simply a universal label applied to anyone suffering from pain, numbness, swelling, and/or burning in the radial side of the hands and/or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, carpal tunnel syndrome is unlikely to be the source of the symptoms.<ref name="Graham 2587–2593"/>  As a whole, the medical community is not currently embracing or accepting trigger point theories due to lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.

==Pathophysiology==
{{Main|Carpal tunnel}}

The carpal tunnel is an anatomical compartment located at the base of the palm. Nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel that is surrounded on three sides by the carpal bones that form an arch. The median nerve provides feeling or sensation to the thumb, index finger, long finger, and half of the ring finger. At the level of the wrist, the median nerve supplies the muscles at the base of the thumb that allow it to abduct, or move away from the fingers, out of the plane of the palm. The carpal tunnel is located at the middle third of the base of the palm, bounded by the bony prominence of the scaphoid tubercle and trapezium at the base of the thumb, and the hamate hook that can be palpated along the axis of the ring finger. The proximal boundary is the distal wrist skin crease, and the distal boundary is approximated by a line known as [[Kaplan's cardinal line]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=JJ|coauthors=Schiller, JR, Allen, SD, Akelman, E|title=Biomechanical and anatomical consequences of carpal tunnel release.|journal=Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)|date=2003 Oct|year=2003|volume=18|issue=8|pages=685–93|pmid=12957554}}</ref>   This line uses surface landmarks, and is drawn between the apex of the skin fold between the thumb and index finger to the palpated hamate hook.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vella|first=JC|coauthors=Hartigan, BJ, Stern, PJ|title=Kaplan's cardinal line.|journal=The Journal of hand surgery|date=2006 Jul-Aug|year=2006|volume=31|issue=6|pages=912–8|pmid=16843150|doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.03.009}}</ref>
The median nerve can be compressed by a decrease in the size of the canal, an increase in the size of the contents (such as the swelling of lubrication tissue around the flexor tendons), or both.<ref name=Gelberman_1981>{{cite journal |author=RH Gelberman, PT Hergenroeder, AR Hargens, GN Lundborg and WH Akeson |title=The carpal tunnel syndrome.

Compression of the median nerve as it runs deep to the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) causes atrophy of the [[thenar eminence]], weakness of the [[flexor pollicis brevis]], [[opponens pollicis]], [[abductor pollicis brevis]], as well as sensory loss in the digits supplied by the median nerve. The superficial sensory branch of the median nerve, which provides sensation to the base of the palm, branches proximal to the TCL and travels superficial to it.  Thus, this branch spared in carpal tunnel syndrome, and there is no loss of palmar sensation.<ref name=Norvell_2009>{{cite web |first1=Jeffrey G. |last1=Norvell |first2=Mark |last2=Steele |date=September 10, 2009 |title=Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/822792-overview |publisher=[[eMedicine]]}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Suggested healthy habits such as avoiding repetitive stress, work modification through use of [[ergonomic]] equipment ([[wikt:wrist rest|wrist rest]], [[mouse pad]]), taking proper breaks, using keyboard alternatives ([[digital pen]], [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]], and dictation), and employing early treatments such as taking turmeric (anti-inflammatory), [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s, and [[B vitamin]]s have been proposed as methods to help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. The potential role of B-vitamins in preventing or treating carpal tunnel syndrome has not been proven.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spooner|first=GR|coauthors=Desai, HB, Angel, JF, Reeder, BA, Donat, JR|title=Using pyridoxine to treat carpal tunnel syndrome.

There is little or no data to support the concept that activity adjustment prevents carpal tunnel syndrome.<ref name="jhs_lozano-calderon" />

Biological factors such as genetic predisposition and anthropometrics had significantly stronger causal association with carpal tunnel syndrome than occupational/environmental factors such as repetitive hand use and stressful manual work.<ref name="jhs_lozano-calderon">{{cite journal |last=Lozano-Calderón |first=Santiago |coauthors=Shawn Anthony, David Ring |year=2008 |month=April |title=The Quality and Strength of Evidence for Etiology: Example of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |journal=The Journal of Hand Surgery |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=525–538|doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2008.01.004 |pmid=18406957}}</ref> This suggests that carpal tunnel syndrome might not be preventable simply by avoiding certain activities or types of work/activities.

==Treatment==
Generally accepted treatments include: steroids either orally or injected locally, splinting, and surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament.<ref name=Piaz2007>{{cite journal|last=Piazzini|first=DB|coauthors=Aprile, I; Ferrara, PE; Bertolini, C; Tonali, P; Maggi, L; Rabini, A; Piantelli, S; Padua, L|title=A systematic review of conservative treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.|journal=Clinical rehabilitation|date=2007 Apr|volume=21|issue=4|pages=299–314|pmid=17613571}}</ref> There is no or insufficient evidence for ultrasound, yoga, lasers, [[Vitamin B6|B6]], and exercise therapy.<ref name=Piaz2007/>

Early surgery with carpal tunnel release is indicated where there is clinical evidence of median nerve denervation or a person elects to proceed directly to surgical treatment.<ref name=aaos2007/> The treatment should be switched when the current treatment fails to resolve the symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. However, these recommendations have sufficient evidence for carpal tunnel syndrome when found in association with the following conditions: [[diabetes mellitus]], coexistent [[cervical radiculopathy]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[polyneuropathy]], [[pregnancy]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and carpal tunnel syndrome in the workplace.<ref name=aaos2007>{{cite book |month=September |year=2008 |title=Clinical Practice Guideline on the Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |publisher=[[American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons]] |url=http://www.aaos.org/Research/guidelines/CTSTreatmentGuideline.pdf}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}</ref>

===Splints===
[[Image:Carpal tunnel splint.jpg|thumb|A rigid splint can keep the wrist straight]]

The importance of wrist [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]]  and  [[splint (medicine)|splints]] in the carpal tunnel syndrome therapy is known, but many people are unwilling to use braces. In 1993, The American Academy of Neurology recommend a non-invasive treatment for the CTS at the beginning (except for sensitive or motor deficit or grave report at EMG/ENG): a therapy using splints was indicated for light and moderate pathology.<ref name=American_Academy_Neurology_1993>{{cite journal |pmid=16557211}}</ref> Current recommendations generally don't suggest immobilizing braces, but instead activity modification and [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s as initial therapy, followed by more aggressive options or specialist referral if symptoms do not improve.<ref name=Katz_JN_Simmons_BP_2002>{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Jeffrey N. |last2=Simmons |first2=Barry P. |title=Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=346 |issue=23 |pages=1807–1812 |year=2002 |pmid=12050342 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp013018}}</ref><ref name=Harris_1998>{{cite book |editor=Harris JS |title=Occupational Medicine Practice Guidelines: evaluation and management of common health problems and functional recovery in workers |location=Beverly Farms, Mass. |publisher=OEM Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-883595-26-5}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}</ref>

Many health professionals suggest that, for best results, one should wear braces at night and, if possible, during the activity primarily causing stress on the wrists.<ref name=Premoselli_2006>{{cite journal |last1=Premoselli |first1=S |last2=Sioli |first2=P |last3=Grossi |first3=A |last4=Cerri |first4=C |title=Neutral wrist splinting in carpal tunnel syndrome: a 3- and 6-months clinical and neurophysiologic follow-up evaluation of night-only splint therapy |journal=Europa medicophysica |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=121–6 |year=2006 |pmid=16767058}}</ref><ref name=Michlovitz_2004>{{cite journal |last1=Michlovitz |first1=SL |title=Conservative interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome |journal=The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapy |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=589–600 |year=2004 |pmid=15552705}}</ref>

===Corticosteroids===
[[Corticosteroid]] injections can be effective for temporary relief from symptoms while a person develops a longterm strategy that fits their lifestyle.<ref name="pmid17443508">{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Shawn C |last2=Tardif |first2=Gaetan |last3=Ashworth |first3=Nigel L |last4=Marshall |first4=Shawn C |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001554.pub2 |editor1-last=Marshall |editor1-first=Shawn C |chapter=Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome}}</ref> This treatment is not appropriate for extended periods, however.

Release of the transverse carpal ligament is known as "carpal tunnel release" surgery. It is recommended when there is static (constant, not just intermittent) numbness, muscle weakness, or atrophy, and when night-splinting no longer controls intermittent symptoms.<ref name=Hui_2004>{{cite journal |last1=Hui |first1=A.C.F. |last2=Wong |first2=S.M. |last3=Tang |first3=A. |last4=Mok |first4=V. |last5=Hung |first5=L.K. |last6=Wong |first6=K.S. |title=Long-term outcome of carpal tunnel syndrome after conservative treatment |journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=337–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15161116 |doi=10.1111/j.1368-5031.2004.00028.x}}</ref> In general, milder cases can be controlled for months to years, but severe cases are unrelenting symptomatically and are likely to result in surgical treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kouyoumdjian |first1= JA |last2= Morita |first2= MP |last3= Molina |first3= AF |last4= Zanetta |first4= DM |last5= Sato |first5= AK |last6= Rocha |first6= CE |last7= Fasanella |first7= CC |title= Long-term outcomes of symptomatic electrodiagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome |journal= Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria |volume= 61 |issue= 2A |pages= 194–8 |year= 2003 |pmid= 12806496 |doi= 10.1590/S0004-282X2003000200007}}</ref>

===Physiotherapy therapy===
One review of the evidence found good evidence for splinting, ultrasound, nerve gliding exercises, carpal bone mobilization, magnetic therapy, and yoga for people with carpal tunnel syndrome.<ref name=Muller_2004>{{cite journal |last1=Muller |first1=M |last2=Tsui |first2=D |last3=Schnurr |first3=R |last4=Biddulph-Deisroth |first4=L |last5=Hard |first5=J |last6=MacDermid |first6=JC |title=Effectiveness of hand therapy interventions in primary management of carpal tunnel syndrome: a systematic review |journal=Journal of Hand Therapy |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=210–28 |year=2004 |pmid=15162107 |doi=10.1197/j.jht.2004.02.009}}</ref> However, a recent evidence based guideline produced by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons assigned lower grades to most of these treatments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keith|first=M.

Again, some claim that pro-active ways to reduce stress on the wrists, which alleviates wrist pain and strain, involve adopting a more ergonomic work and life environment. For example, some have claimed that switching from a [[QWERTY]] computer keyboard layout to a more optimised ergonomic layout such as [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] was commonly cited as beneficial in early CTS studies{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}, however some [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] of these studies claim that the evidence that they present is limited.<ref name=Lincoln_2000>{{cite journal |last1=Lincoln |first1=A |last2=Vernick |first2=JS |last3=Ogaitis |first3=S |last4=Smith |first4=GS |last5=Mitchell |first5=CS |last6=Agnew |first6=J |title=Interventions for the primary prevention of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=18 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=37–50 |year=2000 |pmid=10793280 |doi=10.1016/S0749-3797(00)00140-9}}</ref><ref name=Verhagen_2006>{{cite journal |last1=Verhagen |first1=Arianne P |last2=Karels |first2=Celinde C |last3=Bierma-Zeinstra |first3=Sita MA |last4=Burdorf |first4=Lex L |last5=Feleus |first5=Anita |last6=Dahaghin |first6=Saede SD |last7=De Vet |first7=Henrica CW |last8=Koes |first8=Bart W |last9=Verhagen |first9=Arianne P |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=3 |pages=CD003471 |year=2006 |pmid=16856010 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003471.pub3 |editor1-last=Verhagen |editor1-first=Arianne P |chapter=Ergonomic and physiotherapeutic interventions for treating work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder in adults}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Most people relieved of their carpal tunnel symptoms with conservative or surgical management find minimal residual or "nerve damage".<ref name=Olson_2001>{{cite journal |last1=Olsen |first1=K.

While outcomes are generally good, certain factors can contribute to poorer results that have little to do with nerves, anatomy, or surgery type. One study showed that mental status parameters or alcohol use yields much poorer overall results of treatment.<ref name=Katz_2001>{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Jeffrey N. |last2=Losina |first2=Elena |last3=Amick |first3=Benjamin C. |last4=Fossel |first4=Anne H. |last5=Bessette |first5=Louis |last6=Keller |first6=Robert B. |title=Predictors of outcomes of carpal tunnel release |journal=Arthritis & Rheumatism |volume=44 |pages=1184–93 |year=2001 |doi=10.1002/1529-0131(200105)44:5<1184::AID-ANR202>3.0.CO;2-A |issue=5}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Carpal tunnel syndrome can affect anyone.  In the U.S., roughly 1 out of 20 people will suffer from the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome.  Caucasians have the highest risk of CTS compared with other races such as non-white South Africans.<ref name="N_Ashworth">{{cite web|last=Ashworth |first=Nigel L. |title=Carpal Tunnel Syndrome |date=December 4, 2008|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/327330-overview |publisher=[[eMedicine]]}}</ref> Women suffer more from CTS than men with a ratio of 3:1 between the ages of 45–60 years. Only 10% of reported cases of CTS are younger than 30 years.<ref name="N_Ashworth"/> Increasing age is a [[risk factor]]. CTS is also common in [[pregnancy]].
