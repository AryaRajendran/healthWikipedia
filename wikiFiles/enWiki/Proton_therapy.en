'''Proton therapy''' is a type of [[particle therapy]] which uses a beam of [[proton]]s to [[irradiation|irradiate]] diseased tissue, most often in the treatment of [[cancer]]. The chief advantage of proton therapy is the ability to more precisely localize the radiation dosage when compared with other types of [[external beam radiotherapy]].

==Description==
[[Image:Comparison of dose profiles for proton v. x-ray radiotherapy.png|thumb|273px|In a typical treatment plan for proton therapy, the Spread Out [[Bragg Peak]] (SOBP, dashed blue line), is the therapeutic radiation distribution. The SOBP is the sum of several individual Bragg peaks (thin blue lines) at staggered depths. The [[Percentage depth dose curve|depth-dose]] plot of an x-ray beam (red line) is provided for comparison. The pink area represents the additional dose delivered by x-ray radiotherapy which can be the source of damage to normal tissues and of secondary cancers, especially of the skin.<ref name=SOBP>Adapted from "Proton beam therapy" W P Levin, H Kooy, J S Loeffler and T F DeLaney British Journal of Cancer (2005) 93, 849–854 [http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v93/n8/abs/6602754a.html]</ref>]]

Proton therapy is a type of external beam radiotherapy using [[ionizing radiation]]. During treatment, a particle accelerator is used to target the [[tumor]] with a beam of protons.<ref name=Jakel>O. Jakel: State of the art in hadron therapy. AIP Conference Proceedings, vol. 958, no.1, 2007, pp. 70-77</ref><ref name=zap>"Zap! You're not dead." ''Economist'', 8 September 2007. '''384''' (8545):13-14</ref> These [[charged particle]]s damage the [[DNA]] of cells, ultimately causing their death or interfering with their ability to proliferate. Cancerous cells are particularly vulnerable to attacks on DNA because of their high rate of [[cell division|division]] and their reduced abilities to repair DNA damage.

Due to their relatively large mass, protons have little lateral side [[scattering|scatter]] in the tissue; the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape and delivers only low-dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. All protons of a given energy have a certain [[range (particle radiation)|range]]; very few protons penetrate beyond that distance.<ref name='OncoLink - Cancer Treatment Information'/> Furthermore, the [[Absorbed dose|dose]] delivered to tissue is maximum just over the last few millimeters of the particle’s range; this maximum is called the [[Bragg peak]].<ref>Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref>

To treat tumors at greater depths, the proton accelerator must produce a beam with higher energy, typically given in eV or [[electron volts]]. Tumors closer to the surface of the body are treated using protons with lower energy. The accelerators used for proton therapy typically produce protons with energies in the range of 70 to 250 MeV ([[SI prefix|mega]] electron Volts: million electron Volts). By adjusting the energy of the protons during application of treatment, the cell damage due to the proton beam is maximized within the tumor itself. Tissues closer to the surface of the body than the tumor receive reduced radiation, and therefore reduced damage. Tissues deeper within the body receive very few protons so that the dosage becomes immeasurably small.<ref name='OncoLink - Cancer Treatment Information'>{{cite news|first=James|last=Metz|coauthors=|title=Differences Between Protons and X-rays|date=2006-07-31|publisher=The Abramson Cancer Center of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]|url=http://www.oncolink.org/treatment/article.cfm?c=9&s=70&id=210|work=|pages=|accessdate=2008-02-04|quote=the beam then stops, resulting in virtually no radiation to the tissue beyond the target- or no "exit dose"}}</ref>

In most treatments, protons of different energies with Bragg peaks at different depths are applied to treat the entire tumor. These Bragg peaks are shown as thin blue lines in the figure to the right. The total radiation dosage of the protons is called the ''Spread-Out Bragg Peak'' (SOBP), shown as a heavy dashed blue line in figure to the right. It is important to understand that, while tissues ''behind'' or ''deeper than'' the tumor receive no radiation from proton therapy, the tissue ''in front of'' or ''shallower than'' the tumor receive radiation dosage based on the SOBP.

==History==
The first suggestion that energetic protons could be an effective treatment method was made by [[Robert R. Wilson]]<ref name=Wilson>"Radiological Use of Fast Protons", R. R. Wilson, Radiology, 47:487-491 (1946)</ref> in a paper published in 1946 while he was involved in the design of the [[Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory]] (HCL).<ref>Richard Wilson, "A Brief History of the Harvard University Cyclotrons", Harvard University Press, 2004, pp 9</ref> The first treatments were performed with [[particle accelerators]] built for physics research, notably [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]] in 1954 and at Uppsala in Sweden in 1957. In 1961, a collaboration began between HCL and the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) to pursue proton therapy. Over the next 41 years, this program refined and expanded these techniques while treating 9,116 patients<ref name=PTCOG>{{cite web|url=http://ptcog.web.psi.ch/|title=PTCOG: Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group|publisher=Ptcog.web.psi.ch|date=|accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> before the Cyclotron was shut down in 2002. The world's first hospital-based proton therapy center was built in 1990 at the [[Loma Linda University Medical Center]] (LLUMC) in [[Loma Linda, California]]. Later, The Northeast Proton Therapy Center at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] was brought online, and the HCL treatment program was transferred to it during 2001 and 2002. By 2010 these facilities were joined by an additional seven regional hospital-based proton therapy centers in the United States alone, and many more worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Particle therapy facilities in operation|url=http://ptcog.web.psi.ch/ptcentres.html|publisher=Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group|accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>

==Application==
The types of treatments for which protons are used can be separated into two broad categories. The first are those for disease sites that favor the delivery of higher doses of radiation, i.e. dose escalation. In some instances dose escalation has been shown to achieve a higher probability of "cure" (i.e. local control) than conventional [[radiotherapy]].<ref name="ReferenceA">R. P. Levy et al,The current status and future directions of heavy charged particle therapy in medicine, ''AIP Journal'', March 2009</ref> These include (but are not limited to) [[uvea]]l [[melanoma]] (ocular tumors), skull base and paraspinal tumors ([[chondrosarcoma]] and [[chordoma]]), and unresectable [[sarcomas]]. In all these cases proton therapy achieves significant improvements in the probability of local control over conventional radiotherapy.<ref>E. B. Hug et al: Proton radiation therapy for chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base, ''J. Neurosurgery'' 91, 432-439 (1999)</ref><ref>E. Gragoudas et al, Evidence-based estimates of outcomes in patients treated for intraocular melenoma", ''Arch. Ophthalmol.''120, 1665-1671 (2002)</ref><ref>J. E. Munzenrider, N. J. Liebsch, Proton radiotherapy for tumors of the skull base, ''Strahnlenther. Onkol.'' 175, 57-63 (1999)</ref>

The second broad class are those treatments where the increased precision of proton therapy is used to reduce unwanted side effects, by limiting the dose to normal tissue. In these cases the tumor dose is the same as that used in conventional therapy, and thus there is no expectation of an increased probability of curing the disease. Instead, the emphasis is on the reduction of the integral dose to normal tissue, and thus a reduction of unwanted effects.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Two prominent examples are [[pediatric]] [[neoplasms]] (such as [[medulloblastoma]]) and [[prostate cancer]]. In the case of pediatric treatments there is convincing clinical data showing the advantage of sparing developing organs by using protons, and the resulting reduction of long term damage to the surviving child.<ref>W. H. St. Clair et al, Advantage of protons compared to conventional X-ray or IMRT in the treatment of a pediatric patient with medulloblastoma, ''Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys.''58, 727-734 (2004)</ref><ref>D.g. Kirsch and N. J. Tarbell, Conformal radiaiton therapy for chilfhood CNS tumors, ''The Oncologist'' 9(4), 442-450 (2004)</ref>

In the case of [[prostate cancer]] the issue is not so clear. Some published studies found a reduction in long term rectal and genitio-urinary damage when treating with protons rather than [[photons]] (also known as [[X-ray]] or [[gamma ray]] therapy). Others showed the difference is small, and limited to cases where the prostate is particularly close to certain anatomical structures.<ref>J. D. Slater et al, Proton therapy for prostate cancer; the initial Loma Linda University experience, ''Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys'' 59, 348-352 (2004)</ref><ref name="L. Zietman 2005">A. L.

Byrne, "A Review of Prostate Motion with Considerations for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer", Medical Dosimerty 30(3) 2005 pp. 155-161</ref>

However, the number of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed each year far exceeds those of the other diseases referred to above, and this has led some, but not all, facilities to devote a majority of their treatments slots to prostate treatments. For example two hospital facilities devote roughly 65%<ref name=MTRO1999>{{Cite book|last=Dyk, Jacob|first=Van|coauthors=|title=The modern technology of radiation oncology: A Compendium for Medical Physicists and Radiation Oncologists|year=1999|publisher=Medical Physics Publishing Corporation|location=p. 826|isbn=0-944838-38-3, 9780944838389|page=1072|url=http://books.google.com/?id=U5JrAAAAMAAJ|quote=Proton Patient Summary - Inception Through December 1998...Prostate...2591 64.3%}}</ref> and 50%<ref name='U.S. News and World Report'>{{cite news|title=The Promise of Proton-Beam Therapy|date=2008-04-16|publisher=[[U.S. News and World Report]]|url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/cancer/2008/04/16/the-promise-of-proton-beam-therapy.html?PageNr=1|work=|pages=|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> of their proton treatment capacity to prostate cancer, while a third devotes only 7.1%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ptcog.web.psi.ch/PTCOG47/presentations/4_Meeting_Thursday/TDelaneyupdate.pdf|title=Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center}}</ref>

Current overall world wide numbers are hard to compile, but one example in the literature shows that in 2003 roughly 26% of proton therapy treatments world wide were for prostate cancer.<ref>J. Sisterson, Ion beam therapy in 2004, ''Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research'' B 241 713-716 (2005)</ref> Proton therapy for [[Eye neoplasm|ocular (eye) tumors]] is a special case since this treatment requires only a comparatively low energy (about 70 MeV). Owing to this low energy requirement, some particle therapy centers only treat ocular tumors.<ref name=PTCOG/> Proton, or more generally, [[hadron]] therapy of tissue close to the eye affords sophisticated methods to assess the alignment of the eye that can vary significantly from other patient position verification approaches in image guided particle therapy.<ref>Boris Peter Selby et al., "Pose estimation of eyes for particle beam treatment of tumors.", Bildverarbeitung für die Medizin (Medical Image Processing); Munich, 2007 pp. 368-373.</ref> Position verification and correction have to ensure that sensitive tissue like the optic nerve is spared from the radiation in order to preserve the patient’s vision.

===X-ray radiotherapy===
[[File:Comparison of dose distributions between IMPT (right) and IMRT (left).jpg|thumb|Irradiation of [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]] by photon (X-ray) therapy (left) and proton therapy (right)]]

The figure at the right of the page shows how beams of x-rays ([[IMRT]]) left frame and beams of protons right frame, of different energies, penetrate human tissue. A tumor with a sizable thickness is covered by the IMPT spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) shown as the red lined distribution in the figure. The SOBP is an overlap of several pristine Bragg peaks (blue lines) at staggered depths.

Megavoltage X-ray therapy may be described as having more "skin sparing potential" than proton therapy: x-ray radiation at the skin and at very small depths is lower than for proton therapy. One study estimates that passively scattered proton fields have a slightly higher entrance dose at the skin (~75%) compared to therapeutic megavoltage (MeV) photon beams (~60%).<ref name="SOBP"/> X-ray radiation dose falls off gradually, causing unnecessary damage to tissue deeper in the body and damaging the skin and surface tissue opposite the beam entrance. The X-ray advantage of reduced damage to skin at the entrance is partially counteracted by damage to skin at the exit point. Since X-ray treatments are usually done with multiple exposures from opposite sides, each section of skin will be exposed to both entering and exiting X-rays. In proton therapy, skin exposure at the entrance point is higher, but tissues on the opposite side of the body than the tumor receive no radiation. Thus, x-ray therapy causes slightly less damage to the skin and surface tissues, and proton therapy causes less damage to deeper tissues in front of and beyond the target.<ref name=zap/>

===Surgery===
The decision to use surgery or proton therapy (or in fact any radiation therapy) is based on the tumor type, stage, and location. In some instances surgery is superior (e.g. cutaneous melanoma), in some instances radiation is superior (e.g. skull base chondrosarcoma), and in some instances they are comparable (e.g. prostate cancer). In some instances, they are used together (e.g. rectal cancer or early stage breast cancer). The benefit of external beam proton radiation lies in the dosimetric difference from external beam x-ray radiation and [[brachytherapy]] in cases where the use of radiation therapy is already indicated, rather than as a direct competition with surgery.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, in the case of prostate cancer, the most common indication for proton beam therapy, no clinical study directly comparing proton therapy to surgery, brachytherapy, or other treatments has shown ''any'' clinical benefit for proton beam therapy. Indeed, the largest study to date showed ''greater'' rectal complications and more erectile dysfunction following proton beam treatment compared to conventional radiation therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheets|first=NC|coauthors=Goldin, GH; Meyer, AM; Wu, Y; Chang, Y; Stürmer, T; Holmes, JA; Reeve, BB; Godley, PA; Carpenter, WR; Chen, RC|title=Intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton therapy, or conformal radiation therapy and morbidity and disease control in localized prostate cancer.|journal=JAMA : the journal of the American Medical Association|date=2012 Apr 18|volume=307|issue=15|pages=1611–20|pmid=22511689}}</ref>

==Side effects and risks==
{{Main|Radiation therapy#Side effects|Adverse effect}}

Proton therapy is a type of external beam radiotherapy, and shares risks and [[side effects]] of other forms of radiation therapy. Proton therapy has been in use for over 40 years, and is a mature treatment technology. However, as with all medical knowledge, understanding of the interaction of radiation (proton, X-ray, etc.) with tumor and normal tissue is still imperfect.<ref>Joel E. Tepper, MD, and A. William Blackstock, MD "Randomized Trials and Technology Assessment" Annals of Internal Medicine 151(8) 2009</ref><ref>Federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality "Technical Brief: Particle Beam Radiation Therapies for Cancer" 2009</ref>

==Costs==
Proton therapy is extraordinarily expensive. A proton facility can cost as much as $100M to $200M to construct, and costs of treatment range up to $50,000 per patient or more, twice as much as contemporary radiation therapy, and up to four times as much as surgery, brachytherapy, and other options. In some clinical situations, proton beam therapy is clearly superior to the alternatives, but such cases are relatively rare. Proton beam treatment is therefore aggressively marketed by some institutions--often using claims that are at best marginal, at worse false--to men with prostate cancer, for whom proton therapy has never been shown superior (or even equivalent) to other, less expensive treatments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cooperberg|first=MR|title=Urological cancer: For localized prostate cancer, does technology equal progress?|journal=Nature reviews. Clinical oncology|date=2012 Jun 5|volume=9|issue=7|pages=371–2|pmid=22665365}}</ref>

==Treatment centers==
As of September 2012, there were 39 particle therapy facilities in the world, representing a total of 106 treatment rooms available to patients on a regular basis. They are located in Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. 28% of the proton therapy facilities are located in the US and 23% are located in Japan and more than 96,537 patients had been treated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hadron Therapy Patient Statistics|url=http://ptcog.web.psi.ch/Archive/Patientstatistics-updateMar2012.pdf|publisher=Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group|accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref>

One hindrance to universal use of the proton in cancer treatment is the size and cost of the cyclotron or [[synchrotron]] equipment necessary. Several industrial teams are working on development of comparatively small accelerator systems to deliver the proton therapy to patients.<ref name=Matthews>J.N.A. Matthews: "Accelerators shrink to meet growing demand for proton therapy", Physics Today, March 2009, p. 22</ref> Among the technologies being investigated are [[Superconducting]] [[synchrocyclotron]]s (also known as FM Cyclotrons), ultra-compact synchrotrons and [[Dielectric wall accelerator]]s<ref name="Matthews"/>
