'''Sociological and cultural aspects''' of '''Tourette syndrome''' (also Tourette's syndrome, Tourette's or TS), include legal, advocacy and health insurance issues, awareness of notable individuals with [[Tourette syndrome]], and treatment of TS in the media and popular culture.

Tourette syndrome  is an [[heredity|inherited]] [[neurological]] disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by the presence of motor and phonic [[tic]]s.<ref name=Behavenet>Behavenet. [http://web.archive.org/web/20050310121149/http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/touretteTR.htm Tourette's disorder].  Retrieved on 10 March 2005.</ref>  Tourette's is a misunderstood and stigmatizing condition, often mentioned in the popular media.  Tourette syndrome was once considered a rare and bizarre [[syndrome]].  It is no longer considered rare, but is often undetected because of the wide range of severity, with most cases classified as mild.<ref name=CommunitySample>Scahill L, Williams S, Schwab-Stone M, Applegate J, Leckman JF. Disruptive behavior problems in a community sample of children with tic disorders. ''Adv Neurol.'' 2006;99:184–90.

==Legal and insurance issues==
There is no reason to believe that persons with Tourette's have diminished capacity in regards to understanding legal issues.  Examples of federal legislation which protects some rights of individuals with TS in the United States include the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA).<ref name=emed/> Legal and other advocacy information regarding the challenges associated with TS can be found on the website of the [[Tourette Syndrome Association]].<ref>[http://www.tsa-usa.org/People/LivingWithTS/LivingTS.htm Living with TS:Adult Challenges]. Tourette Syndrome Association. Retrieved 4 January 2007.</ref>

A review of all cases tried in state and federal courts in the US between 1985 and 2003 (civil rights, criminal, education, family, labor, and social security) found that TS was implicated in only about 150 cases, 21 of which were criminal, over 18 years. The authors concluded that TS "rarely leads to criminal behavior, but patients with TS who have behavioral comorbidities are at risk of being involved with the legal system".<ref>Jankovic J, Kwak C, Frankoff R. Tourette's syndrome and the law. ''J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci.'' 2006 Winter;18(1):86–95. {{DOI|10.1176/appi.neuropsych.18.1.86}} PMID 16525075</ref>

Discussions with adults who have Tourette syndrome reveal that not everyone wants treatment or a "cure", especially if that means they may "lose" something else in the process.  Some believe that there may even be latent advantages associated with the [[Genetics|genetic]] vulnerability.<ref>[[James F. Leckman|Leckman JF]], [[Donald J. Cohen|Cohen DJ]].

ISBN 0-471-16037-7</ref>  Research supports some advantages associated with Tourette syndrome.

A [[Case-control|controlled study]] on a small (13) group of individuals with TS found that cognitive control may be enhanced in young people with Tourette's because the need to suppress tics results in more efficient control of inhibitions.<ref>Mueller SC, Jackson, GM, et al.  Enhanced Cognitive Control in Young People with Tourette's Syndrome.  ''Current Biology''.  2006 Mar 21;16(6):570-3.  {{DOI|10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.064}} PMID 16546080</ref>  A subsequent study confirmed and extended the paradoxical result that individuals with Tourette's exhibit greater levels of cognitive control than age-matched healthy peers.<ref>Jackson GM, Mueller SC, Hambleton K, Hollis CP.

==Notable individuals==
There are many individuals with Tourette's, living and deceased, recognized in their fields, or for whom [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]] tendencies associated with Tourette's may have helped fuel their success.

===Samuel Johnson===
An example of a person who may have used obsessive-compulsive traits to advantage is [[Samuel Johnson|Dr. Samuel Johnson]], lexicographer, who had Tourette syndrome as evidenced by the writings of [[James Boswell]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050210205714/http://www.tsa-usa.org/what_is/johnson.html Samuel Johnson.]  Tourette Syndrome Association. Retrieved 10 February 2005.</ref>  Johnson wrote ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' in 1747, and was a prolific writer, poet, and critic.  The "case of Dr Johnson accords well with current criteria for the Tourette syndrome; he also displayed many of the obsessional-compulsive traits and rituals which are associated with this syndrome".<ref name="Pearce">Pearce JM. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1294650&blobtype=pdf Doctor Samuel Johnson: 'the great convulsionary' a victim of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome] (PDF). ''J R Soc Med''. 1994 Jul;87(7):396–9. PMID 8046726.</ref>

According to Boswell,
<blockquote>...&nbsp;while talking or even musing as he sat in his chair, he commonly held his head to one side towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a whale.<ref name="Hibbert203">[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]] (1971).  ''The Personal History of Samuel Johnson''. New York: Harper & Row. p. 203. ISBN 0-06-011879-2.</ref></blockquote>

There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to act in such a manner at the thresholds of doors, and [[Frances Reynolds]]—younger sister of artist [[Joshua Reynolds]]—said that, "with poor Mrs Williams, a blind lady who lived with him, he would quit her hand, or else whirl her about on the steps as he whirled and twisted about to perform his gesticulations".<ref>Hibbert 1971, p. 202.</ref> When asked by English poet [[Christopher Smart]]'s niece, a young child at the time, why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: "From bad habit."<ref name="Hibbert203"/>

Johnson had a number of tics and other involuntary movements.<ref name="Pearce"/><ref name="Murray">Murray TJ. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1599158&blobtype=pdf Dr Samuel Johnson's Movement Disorder] (PDF).

Retrieved on 10 July 2008.</ref> In 1994, Pearce analysed the details provided by Boswell and others; based on the anecdotal evidence, Pearce compiled a list of movements and tics which Johnson was said to have demonstrated. From that list, he determined it was possible that Johnson had Tourette syndrome.<ref name="Pearce"/>

Pearce was not alone in diagnosing Johnson as having Tourette syndrome; in 1967 McHenry Jr<ref>McHenry LC Jr. Samuel Johnson's tics and gesticulations. ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences'' 1967 April; 22(2):152–68. {{DOI|10.1093/jhmas/XXII.2.152}} PMID 5341871</ref> was the first to diagnose Johnson with the syndrome.<ref> Wiltshire, John (1991). ''Samuel Johnson in the Medical World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 29. ISBN 0-521-38326-9.
</ref> It was not until [[Arthur K. Shapiro]]'s ''Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome'' that the diagnosis was made clear, with Shapiro declaring, "Samuel Johnson&nbsp;... is the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome".<ref>[[Arthur K. Shapiro|Shapiro, Arthur K.]] (1978). ''Gilles de la Tourette syndrome''. New York: Raven Press. p. 361. ISBN 0-89004-057-5.</ref> Murray had come to the same conclusion in a 1979 ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' paper.  Murray based his diagnosis on various accounts of Johnson displaying physical tics, "involuntary vocalisations" and "compulsive behaviour".<ref name="Murray"/>

In a 2007 analysis, Kammer discussed the "documented evidence" of Johnson's tics, saying that Johnson was "known to have suffered from TS".<ref name="Kammer">Kammer T. [http://www.uni-ulm.de/~tkammer/pdf/Kammer_2007_Mozart_preprint.pdf "Mozart in the neurological department—who has the tic?"] (PDF). ''Front Neurol Neurosci.'' 2007;22:184–92. PMID 17495512 {{DOI|10.1159/0000102880}} Retrieved on 10 September 2007</ref> According to neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]], "the case for Samuel Johnson having the syndrome, though [...] circumstantial, is extremely strong and, to my mind, entirely convincing".<ref name="Sacks">Sacks O.

Retrieved 24 July 2008</ref> He continues by generally describing the "enormous spontaneity, antics, and lightning quick wit" that featured prominently in Johnson's life.<ref name="Sacks"/> However, Pearce goes further into Johnson's biography and traces particular moments in Johnson's life which reinforced his diagnosis, concluding:
<blockquote>It is not without interest that periodic boundless mental energy, imaginative outbursts of inventiveness and creativity, are, characteristic of certain Tourette patients. It may be thought that without this illness Dr Johnson's remarkable literary achievements, the great dictionary, his philosophical deliberations and his conversations may never have happened; and Boswell, the author of the greatest of biographies would have been unknown.<ref name="Pearce"/></blockquote>

Other speculative posthumous diagnoses of TS, for example Mozart, are not "...&nbsp;as entirely convincing&nbsp;...&nbsp;[as] the case for Samuel Johnson having TS&nbsp;...".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050407060420/http://www.tsa-usa.org/what_is/Mozart.html  Did Mozart really have TS?] and   [http://web.archive.org/web/20050407083830/http://www.tsa-usa.org/what_is/johnson.html Samuel Johnson.]   [[Tourette Syndrome Association]],  Archived version of 7 April 2005.

While the term "Leck mich am Arsch", when literally translated, conjures up images of sexual practices, the more accurate English meaning of this phrase is simply "Kiss my ass". The additional phrase "... recht fein schön sauber", while colorful, is still only an emphasis: that is to say, "Kiss my ass real good!".  The use of this written language alone is not necessarily indicative of [[coprolalia]], a rare symptom present in a minority of people with TS, and there are cultural explanations for Mozart's use of language.
