'''Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome''' is a medical condition in which patients display the [[medical sign|signs]], [[symptom]]s, and abnormal [[hormone]] levels seen in [[Cushing's syndrome]].  However, pseudo-Cushing's syndrome is not caused by a problem with the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] as Cushing's is; it is an [[idiopathic]] condition.

==Investigations==
*Levels of [[cortisol]] and [[ACTH]] both elevated
*24-hour urinary cortisol levels elevated
*[[Dexamethasone suppression test]]<ref name="pmid17635947">{{cite journal |author=Gatta B, Chabre O, Cortet C, ''et al'' |title=Reevaluation of the combined dexamethasone suppression-corticotropin-releasing hormone test for differentiation of mild cushing's disease from pseudo-Cushing's syndrome |journal=J.

*Loss of diurnal variation in cortisol levels (seen only in true Cushing's Syndrome)
*High [[mean corpuscular volume]] and [[gamma-glutamyl transferase]] may be clues to [[alcoholism]]
* [[Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome]] should be ruled out; PCOS has similar symptoms

==Differential diagnosis==
*Differentiation from Cushing's is difficult, but several tools exist to aid in the diagnosis<ref name="pmid17961030">{{cite journal |author=Gross BA, Mindea SA, Pick AJ, Chandler JP, Batjer HH |title=Diagnostic approach to Cushing disease |journal=Neurosurg Focus |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=E1 |year=2007 |pmid=17961030 |doi=10.3171/foc.2007.23.3.2 |url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/foc.2007.23.3.2?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref>
*Alternative causes of Cushing's should be excluded with imaging of [[lung]]s, [[adrenal gland]]s, and [[pituitary gland]]; these often appear normal in Cushing's
*In the alcoholic patient with pseudo-Cushing's, admission to hospital (and avoidance of alcohol) will result in normal midnight cortisol levels within five days, excluding Cushing's<ref>{{cite journal | author=Newell-Price J, Trainer P, Besser M, Grossman A. | title=The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and pseudo-Cushing's states. | journal=Endocr Rev | volume=19 | issue=5 | pages=647–72 | year=1998 | pmid=9793762 | doi=10.1210/er.19.5.647}}</ref>
*Another cause for Cushing's syndrome is the extremely rare form of cancer (Adrenal Cortisol Carcinoma), when a benign lesion on the adrenal gland (which would cause Cushing's) becomes malignant and starts producing its own cortisol. This produces Cushing's-like symptoms and is fatal. Life expectancy depends on early detection. Ruling out ACC is done with a CT scan of the abdomen, identifying the size and location of adrenal tumors and lesions.<ref>[http://www.cancer.med.umich.edu/cancertreat/endocrine/adrenal-cancer-information.shtml University of Michigan Adrenal Cancer Research Page]</ref>

==Prognosis==
*Blood results and symptoms normalise rapidly on cessation of drinking or remission of depression.
