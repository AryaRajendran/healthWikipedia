'''Lábrea fever''', also known as '''Lábrea's black fever''' and '''Lábrea hepatitis''', is a lethal [[tropical disease|tropical]] [[virus|viral infection]] discovered in the 1950s in the city of [[Lábrea]], in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon basin]], where it occurs mostly in the area south of the [[Amazon River]], in the states of [[Acre]], [[Amazonas State, Brazil|Amazonas]] and [[Rondônia]] 
. The disease has also been diagnosed in [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]]. The similar form in Colombia has been named '''Santa Marta fever'''. 

Its main manifestation is a [[fulminant]] [[hepatitis]] which may kill in less than a week, and which characteristically affects children and young adults, and more males than females. It is accompanied also by an [[encephalitis]] in many cases. The disease is highly lethal: in a study carried out in 1986 at [[Boca do Acre]], also in the Amazon, 39 patients out of 44 died in the [[Acute (medical)|acute]] phase of the disease.<ref name=Bensabath_1987>{{cite journal | author=Bensabath G, Hadler SC, Soares MC, Fields H, Dias LB, Popper H, Maynard JE | title=Hepatitis delta virus infection and Labrea hepatitis.

==Symptoms and signs==
Lábrea fever has a sudden onset, with [[jaundice]] (yellowing of the skin), [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] (lack of appetite), [[hematemesis]] ([[vomiting]] of blood), [[headache]], [[fever]] and severe [[prostration]]. Death occurs by [[acute liver failure]] (ALF). In the last phase, [[neurology|neurological symptoms]] such as agitation, [[delirium]], [[convulsion]]s and hemorrhagic [[coma]] commonly appear.

==Etiology==
Lábrea fever is a [[coinfection]] or [[superinfection]] of [[hepatitis D]] or delta virus and [[hepatitis B]] (HBV).<ref name=Bensabath_1987 /> The infection by delta virus may occur in a patient who already has the HBV, or both viruses may infect at the same time a previously uninfected patient. Delta virus can only multiply in the presence of HBV, therefore [[vaccination]] against HBV prevents infection. Thus, American and Brazilian scientists have determined that the delta virusa, virus, which is a small circular [[RNA virus]], is normally unable to cause illness by itself, due to a defect. When it is combined with HBV, Lábrea hepatitis may ensue. The main discovery of delta virus and HBV association was done by Dr. [[Gilberta Bensabath]], a leading tropical virologist of the [[Instituto Evandro Chagas]], of [[Belém]], state of [[Pará]], and her collaborators.

Infected patients show extensive destruction of [[liver]] tissue, with [[steatosis]] of a particular type (microsteatosis, characterized by small fat droplets inside the cells), and infiltration of large numbers of inflammatory cells called ''morula cells'', comprised mainly by [[macrophage]]s containing delta virus [[antigen]]s. 

In the 1987 Boca do Acre study, scientists did an epidemiological survey and reported delta virus infection in 24% of asymptomatic HBV carriers, 29% of acute nonfulminant hepatitis B cases, 74% of fulminant hepatitis B cases, and 100% of chronic hepatitis B cases. The delta virus seems to be [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in the Amazon region.

==Treatment and prevention==
Treatment is similar to hepatitis B, but due to its high lethality, more aggressive therapeutic approaches are recommended in the acute phase. In absence of a specific [[vaccine]] against delta virus, the vaccine against HBV must be given soon after birth in [[risk group]]s.
