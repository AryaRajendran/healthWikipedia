'''Robert Wayne McCollum, Jr.''' (January 29, 1925 &ndash; September 13, 2010) was an [[United States|American]] [[Virology|virologist]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] who made pioneering studies into the nature and spread of [[polio]], [[hepatitis]] and [[mononucleosis]] while at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], after which he served for nearly a decade as Dean of the [[Dartmouth Medical School]].

==Early life and education==
McCollum was born on January 29, 1925, in [[Waco, Texas]], and earned his undergraduate degree there in 1945 from [[Baylor University]]. He received his medical training at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], graduating in 1948. He did [[internship (medicine)|internships]] at [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[pathology]] and at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center|Vanderbilt University Hospital]] in [[internal medicine]] and completed a [[residency (medicine)|residency]] in internal medicine at [[Yale – New Haven Hospital]] and began his career as a research assistant in [[preventive medicine]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=DMSObit/>

==Medical research==
Working together with Dr. [[Dorothy M. Horstmann]], McCollum isolated [[poliovirus]] in blood samples taken from those afflicted with the disease and from their family members, verifying that the virus was present in the bloodstream before it entered the [[spinal cord]] and caused paralysis. This discovery set the stage for the development of the [[polio vaccine]].<ref name=NYTObit>Hevesi, Dennis. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/education/26mccollum.html "Robert W. McCollum, Dean of Dartmouth Medical School, Dies at 85"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 25, 2010. Accessed September 26, 2010.</ref>

Attending the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], McCollum earned a doctorate in public health in 1958. Back at Yale, McCollum and Dr. [[Saul Krugman]] performed studies at [[Willowbrook State School]] in [[Staten Island]], [[New York]], where they found that a form of hepatitis was spread through blood transfusions and that transmission of serum hepatitis (now known as [[hepatitis B]]) could be blocked using [[gamma globulin]].<ref name=NYTObit/> [[New York Senate|New York State Senator]] [[Samuel Thayer]] had raised ethical issues in the 1960s and had been an outspoken critic of how the Willowbrook studies were conducted and how [[mentally handicapped]] children had been used, but in 1971 stated that he was satisfied that the hepatitis research had been performed properly.<ref>Sullivan, Walter.

Accessed September 16, 2010.</ref> McCollum found increased hepatitis risk in using the blood of paid donors.<ref name=NYTObit/> Other research isolated [[Epstein-Barr virus]] as one of the causes of [[infectious mononucleosis]].<ref name=DMSObit/> McCollum was appointed Chairman of Epidemiology and Public Health in 1969.<ref>Staff.

McCollum was named dean of the Dartmouth Medical School and Professor of Community and Family Medicine in 1982, where funding for research, new endowed faculty positions and [[Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center]] in [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]] were developed during his tenure.<ref name=DMSObit>Corriveau, David.
