'''Herpesviral encephalitis''' is [[encephalitis]] associated with [[herpes simplex virus]].

Herpes simplex [[encephalitis]] (HSE) is a rare, but severe viral infection of the human [[central nervous system]]. It is estimated to affect at least 1 in 500,000 individuals per year.<ref name="pmid16675036">{{cite journal |author=Whitley RJ |title=Herpes simplex encephalitis: adolescents and adults |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=71 |issue=2-3 |pages=141–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16675036 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2006.04.002}}</ref> The majority of cases of herpes encephalitis are caused by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), the same virus that causes cold sores. 57% of American adults are infected with HSV-1,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Xu|first=Fujie|coauthors=Sternburg Maya, Kottiri Benny, McQuilan Geraldine, Lee Francis, Nahmias Andre, Berman Stuart, Markowitz Larui|title=Trends in Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 and Type 2 Seroprevalence in the United States|journal=JAMA|year=2006|volume=296|series=8|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/296/8/964.full|doi=10.1001/jama.296.8.964 | pmid=16926356|issue=8}}</ref>  which is spread through droplets, casual contact, and sometimes sexual contact, though most infected people never have cold sores. About 10% of cases of herpes encephalitis are due to HSV-2, which is typically spread through sexual contact. About 1 in 3 cases of HSE result from primary HSV-1 infection, predominantly occurring in individuals under the age of 18; 2 in 3 cases occur in [[Serostatus|seropositive]] persons, few of whom have history of recurrent orofacial herpes. Approximately 50% of individuals that develop HSE are over 50 years of age.<ref name="pmid11853816">{{cite journal |author=Whitley RJ, Gnann JW |title=Viral encephalitis: familiar infections and emerging pathogens |journal=Lancet |volume=359 |issue=9305 |pages=507–13 |year=2002 |pmid=11853816 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07681-X}}</ref> 

HSE is thought to be caused by the [[Retrograde infection|retrograde transmission]] of virus from a peripheral site on the face following HSV-1 reactivation, along a nerve [[axon]], to the brain.<ref name="pmid16675036"/> The virus lies dormant in the [[ganglion]] of the trigeminal [[cranial nerve]], but the reason for reactivation, and its pathway to gain access to the brain, remains unclear, though changes in the immune system caused by stress clearly play a role in animal models of the disease.  The olfactory nerve may also be involved in HSE,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.281.6252.1392 | author = Dinn J | title = Transolfactory spread of virus in herpes simplex encephalitis. | journal = Br Med J | volume = 281 | issue = 6252 | pages = 1392 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7437807 | pmc = 1715042}}</ref> which may explain its predilection for the [[temporal lobe]]s of the brain, as the olfactory nerve sends branches there.  In horses, a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] is sufficient to allow the virus to cause neurological disease;<ref>{{cite journal|author=van de Walle GR, Goupil R, Wishon C, ''et al.''|title=A single‐nucleotide polymorphism in a herpesvirus DNA polymerase is sufficient to cause lethal neurological disease|journal=J Infect Dis|year=2009|volume=200|issue=1|pages=20&ndash;25|doi=10.1086/599316|pmid=19456260}}</ref> but no similar mechanism has been found in humans.

Most individuals with HSE show a decrease in their level of consciousness and an altered mental state presenting as [[Mental confusion|confusion]], and changes in personality.  Increased numbers of white blood cells can be found in patient's [[cerebrospinal fluid]], without the presence of [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]].  Patients typically have a fever<ref name="pmid16675036"/> and may have seizures.  The electrical activity of the brain changes as the disease progresses, first showing abnormalities in one [[temporal lobe]] of the brain, which spread to the other temporal lobe 7–10 days later.<ref name="pmid16675036"/> Imaging by CT or MRI shows characteristic changes in the temporal lobes (see Figure). Definite diagnosis requires testing of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for presence of the virus. The testing takes several days to perform, and patients with suspected Herpes encephalitis should be treated with acyclovir immediately while waiting for test results.

Herpesviral Encephalitis can be treated with high-dose intravenous [[aciclovir]]. Without treatment, HSE results in rapid death in approximately 70% of cases; survivors suffer severe neurological damage.<ref name="pmid16675036"/>  When treated, HSE is still fatal in one-third of cases, and causes serious long-term neurological damage in over half of survivors. Twenty percent of treated patients recover with minor damage. Only a small population of survivors (2.5%) regain completely normal brain function.<ref name="pmid11853816"/> Earlier treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) improves the chances of a good recovery. Rarely, treated individuals can have relapse of infection weeks to months later. While the herpes virus can be spread, encephalitis itself is not infectious. Other viruses can cause similar symptoms of encephalitis, though usually milder ([[Herpesviridae|human herpes virus-6]], [[varicella zoster virus]], [[Epstein–Barr virus|Epstein-Barr]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[coxsackievirus]], etc.).
