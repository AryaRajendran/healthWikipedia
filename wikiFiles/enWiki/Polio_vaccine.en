Two '''polio [[vaccine]]s''' are used throughout the world to combat [[poliomyelitis]] (or polio). The first was developed by [[Jonas Salk]] and first tested in 1952.

== Development ==
In generic sense, vaccination works by priming the [[immune system]] with an '[[immunogen]]'. Stimulating immune response, via use of an infectious agent, is known as [[immunization]]. The development of immunity to polio efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and [[herd immunity|the wider community]].<ref name=Fine/>

In 1936, Maurice Brodie, a research assistant at [[New York University]], attempted to produce a [[formaldehyde]]-killed polio vaccine from ground-up monkey [[spinal cord]]s. His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself and several of his assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. Many of these children developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio.<ref name = Pearce>{{cite journal |author=Pearce J |title=Salk and Sabin: poliomyelitis immunisation |url= http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/75/11/1552 |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=11 |page=1552 |year=2004 |pmid = 15489385 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.028530 |pmc=1738787}}</ref> Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a vaccine that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.<ref name=Rainsberger>{{cite web | author=Rainsberger M | title=More than a March of Dimes | publisher=The University of Texas at Austin | url=https://www.utexas.edu/features/2005/polio/index.html | date=2005-06-27 <!--  accessdate=2011-05-19 -->}}</ref>

A breakthrough came in 1948 when a research group headed by [[John Enders]] at the [[Children's Hospital Boston]] successfully cultivated the [[poliovirus]] in human tissue in the laboratory.<ref name=Enders>{{cite journal |author=Enders JF, Weller TH, Robbins FC |title=Cultivation of the Lansing Strain of Poliomyelitis Virus in Cultures of Various Human Embryonic Tissues |journal=Science |volume=109 |issue=2822 |pages=85–87 |year=1949 |month=January |pmid=17794160 |doi=10.1126/science.109.2822.85 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17794160}}</ref> This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948 [[Thomas H. Weller]] was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed that there were a few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off chance that the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.

This development greatly facilitated vaccine research and ultimately allowed for the development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, [[Thomas H. Weller]] and [[Frederick C. Robbins]], were recognized in 1954 for their labors with a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref name=Nobel_1954>{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1954 | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1954/ | accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> Other important advances that led to the development of polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus [[serotype]]s (Poliovirus type 1 — PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma-globulin protects against paralytic polio.<ref name=Kew_2005/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hammon W, Coriell L, Wehrle P, Stokes J |title=Evaluation of Red Cross gamma globulin as a prophylactic agent for poliomyelitis.

In 1952 and 1953, the U.S. experienced an outbreak of 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year. Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York under the direction of [[H. R. Cox]]. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born [[virologist]] and [[immunologist]] [[Hilary Koprowski]], who claims to have created the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950. His vaccine, however, being a live attenuated virus taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus injectable vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's attenuated vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use.<ref name = Sanofi/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Weekly Reports for OCTOBER 10, 1947 |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=62 |issue=41 |pages=1467–1498 |year=1947 |month=October |pmid=19316151 |pmc=1995293 |doi= }}</ref> On February 27, 1950, Koprowski's live, attenuated vaccine was tested for the first time on an 8-year-old boy living at [[Letchworth Village]], an institution for the physically and mentally disabled located in New York.

[[File:PittPolioVaccineCoL.jpg|thumb|right|Administration of the polio inoculation, including by [[Jonas Salk|Salk]] himself, in 1957 at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] where he and his team had developed the vaccine]]
The first effective polio vaccine was developed in 1952 by [[Jonas Salk]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], but it would require years of testing. To encourage patience, Salk went on CBS radio to report a successful test on a small group of adults and children on March 26, 1953; two days later the results were published in [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Offit|first=Paul A.|title=The Cutter Incident: How America's First Polio Vaccine Led to the Growing Vaccine Crisis|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|page=38|isbn=0-300-12605-0}}</ref>

The Salk vaccine, or ''inactivated poliovirus vaccine'' (IPV), is based on three wild, [[virulent]] reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey [[kidney]] tissue culture ([[Vero cell]] line), which are then inactivated with [[formalin]].<ref name=Kew_2005/> The injected Salk vaccine confers [[IgG]]-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to [[viremia]] and protects the [[motor neurons]], thus eliminating the risk of [[bulbar polio]] and [[post-polio syndrome]].

Beginning February 23, 1954, the vaccine was tested at Arsenal Elementary School and the [[D. T. Watson Home for Crippled Children|Watson Home for Children]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Shors2008">{{cite book|author=Teri Shors|title=Understanding viruses|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VQeamKFwyvgC&pg=PA294|accessdate=22 February 2011|date=14 March 2008|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2932-5|pages=294–}}</ref> Salk's vaccine was then used in a test called the Francis Field Trial, led by [[Thomas Francis, Jr.|Thomas Francis]]; the largest medical experiment in history.

OPV also provided longer lasting [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] than the Salk vaccine.

In 1961, type 1 and 2 [[monovalent vaccine|monovalent]] oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, and became the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine.<ref name = Pearce/> A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic decline in the number of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.<ref name=Smallman>{{cite book |author=Smallman-Raynor, Matthew |title=Poliomyelitis: A World Geography: Emergence to Eradication |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA  |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-924474-X }}</ref>

OPV is usually provided in vials containing 10-20 doses of vaccine. A single dose of oral polio vaccine (usually two drops) contains 1,000,000 infectious units of Sabin 1 (effective against PV1), 100,000 infectious units of the Sabin 2 strain, and 600,000 infectious units of Sabin 3. The vaccine contains small traces of [[antibiotics]]— [[neomycin]] and [[streptomycin]]—but does not contain [[preservative]]s.<ref name=PAHO>{{cite book |title=Poliomyelitis Eradication: Field Guide |publisher=Pan American Health Organization |location=Washington |year=2006 |isbn=92-75-11607-5 }}</ref> One dose of OPV produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in approximately 50% of recipients.<ref name=PinkPages/> Three doses of live-attenuated OPV produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95% of recipients. OPV produces excellent immunity in the [[intestine]], the primary site of wild poliovirus entry, which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where the virus is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]].<ref name=Peds/> The live virus used in the vaccine is shed in the stool and can be spread to others within a community. IPV produces less [[gastrointestinal]] immunity than does OPV, and primarily acts by preventing the virus from entering the nervous system. In regions without wild poliovirus, inactivated polio vaccine is the vaccine of choice.<ref name=Peds/> In regions with higher incidence of polio, and thus a different relative risk between efficacy and reversion of the vaccine to a virulent form, live vaccine is still used. The live virus also has stringent requirements for transport and storage, which are a problem in some hot or remote areas. As with other live-virus vaccines, immunity initiated by OPV is probably lifelong.<ref name=Robertson_1993/>

<!-- difficult paragraph -->
As the incidence of wild polio diminishes, nations transition from use of the oral vaccine back to the injected vaccine because the direct risk of iatrogenic polio (VAPP) due to OPV outweighs the indirect benefit of immunization via subclinical transmission of OPV. When IPV is used, reversion is not possible but there remains a small risk of clinical infection upon exposure to reverted OPV or wild polio virus. Following the widespread use of polio vaccines in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly in many industrialized countries. The use of OPV was discontinued in the United States in 2000 and in 2004 in the UK, but it continues to be used around the globe.<ref name= PinkPages/><ref name=UK/>
