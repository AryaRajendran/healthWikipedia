'''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies''' include the causes of ADHD, how it is diagnosed, and how it is treated. These controversies surrounding [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) have been the subject of active debate since at least the 1970s.<ref name=Parrillo>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Social Problems |last=Parrillo |first=Vincent  |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE |location= |isbn=978-1-4129-4165-5 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=mRGr_B4Y1CEC&pg=PA63&dq=percent+who+consider+ADHD+controversial |page=63 |authorlink=Vincent N.

According to the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) ADHD has attracted controversy from many people. The criticisms include: how it is diagnosed, negative stereotyping of children, risks of other conditions being misdiagnosed as ADHD and alleged [[hegemonic]] practices of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. Some even question the very existence of ADHD.<ref name=NICE2008/>{{Rp|p.23}} 

The social science perspective challenges the biomedical view on the cause of ADHD symptoms. Symptoms are seen by this perspective as a consequence of normalisation; where it has been constructed in culture/society that it is normal to be focused/well-behaved/patient etc. and therefore abnormal to act differently. <ref>Lock, M & Nguyen, V 2010, An anthropology of biomedicine, Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, UK.</ref>   Ruth Benedict argues that in most modern cultures normal is associated strongly with being good, whereas abnormality usually carries bad connotations.<ref>Benedict, R 1934, ‘Anthropology and the abnormal’, Journal of General Psychology, vol. 10, pp. 59-82. As cited in; Kowal, E 2013, ‘Standardising the body: lecture notes week two’, Anth300016, School of Social and Political Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Melbourne, AU. </ref>
These 'abnormal' symptoms have therefore succumbed to [[medicalization]]; where the tendency for abnormality is labelled as a disease (that requires treatment). Although some argue that the medicalization of what is constructed as socially detrimental behaviours would alleviate patients of responsibility for their actions, others insist that it merely permits health professionals to exert influence over the care and management of such individuals.<ref>Zola, I K 1972, ‘Medicine as an institution of social control’, The Sociological Review, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 487–504, viewed 17/04/2013, <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.1972.tb00220.x/abstract>.</ref> In addition, although medicalization may be liberating for some, it can be oppressive to others. Medicalization of ADHD and its biomedical treatment can lead to iatrogenesis (medical treatment-caused symptoms) and added complications for the individual.<ref>Illitch, I 2011, ‘Medical nemesis: the expropriation of health’, Pantheon Books, NYC, viewed on 19/04/2019, <http://www.desireerover.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/MEDICAL-NEMESIS-Ivan-Illitch.pdf>.</ref> Therefore not only do social science perspectives challenge the validity of the 'disease' but they also highlight the negative social and medical aspects associated with treating the 'symptoms'.

NICE concluded that while it is important to acknowledge the body of academic literature which raises controversies and criticisms surrounding ADHD for the purpose of developing clinical guidelines, it is not possible to offer alternative methods of assessment (i.e. ICD 10 and DSM IV) or therapeutic treatment recommendations. NICE stated that this is because the current therapeutic treatment interventions and methods of diagnosis for ADHD are based on the dominant view of the academic literature.<ref name=NICE2008/>{{Rp|p.133}} NICE further concluded that despite such criticism, ADHD represented a valid clinical condition,<ref name=NICE2008/>{{Rp|p.138}} with genetic, environmental, neurobiological, and demographic factors.<ref name = NICE2008/>{{Rp|p.139}} Although the diagnosis has a high level of support from clinicians and medical authorities,<ref name=NICE2008/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldman LS, Genel M, Bezman RJ, Slanetz PJ |title=Diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents.

The best course of [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder management|ADHD management]] is also a source of debate. [[Stimulant]]s are the most commonly prescribed medication for ADHD, and, according to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], "under medical supervision, stimulant medications are considered safe".<ref name=NIMH >{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/medications.shtml |title=NIMH · ADHD · The Treatment of ADHD |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Safety concerns exist with concerns regarding the higher rates of [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]] as well as increased severity of these disorders in individuals with a history of stimulant use for ADHD in childhood.<ref name=psychotic2006/> The use of stimulant medications for the treatment of ADHD has generated controversy because of undesirable side effects, uncertain long term effects, and social and ethical issues regarding their use and dispensation. Children comprise the majority of ADHD diagnoses, but because they are unable to give [[informed consent]] due to their age, treatment decisions are ultimately determined by their legal guardians on their behalf. Ethical and legal issues also arise from the promotion of stimulants to treat ADHD by groups and individuals who receive money from drug companies.<ref name=Foreman2006/><ref name=Adams2008>{{cite journal |author=Adams G. |title=Harvard medics "concealed drug firm cash" |journal=The Independent |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2008 |month=9 July|pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/harvard-medics-concealed-drug-firm-cash-842792.html | location=London | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>

==Status as a disorder==
The controversy surrounding ADHD involves clinicians, scientists, teachers, policymakers, parents and the media with opinions regarding ADHD ranging from those who do not believe it exists to those who believe that there are genetic and physiological bases for the condition.<ref name=US1999/> While the existence of ADHD is generally accepted, controversy exists over the high rates of diagnosis in children and adolescents, the treatment of individuals with ADHD medically, educationally as well as legally and whether treatment should continue into adulthood.<ref name="Mayes-2008">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Mayes | first1 = R. | last2 = Bagwell | first2 = C. | last3 = Erkulwater | first3 = J. | title = ADHD and the rise in stimulant use among children. | journal = Harv Rev Psychiatry | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 151–66 | month =  | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1080/10673220802167782 | PMID = 18569037 }}</ref><ref name="Sim">{{cite journal |author=Sim MG, Hulse G, Khong E |title=When the child with ADHD grows up |journal=Aust Fam Physician |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=615–8 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15373378 |doi= |url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200408/20040803sim.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> The controversies around ADHD have been on-going at least since the 1970s.<ref name=Parrillo/> In the most accepted authority on clinical diagnoses of psychological behavior, the [[DSM-IV]], ADHD is included as a  genuine disorder while significant controversy surrounds how it is diagnosed and treated.<ref name="Sim" />

Researchers from [[McMaster University]] identified five features of ADHD that contribute to its controversial nature:
# It is a clinical diagnosis for which there are no laboratory or radiological confirmatory tests or specific physical features.
# Diagnostic criteria have changed frequently.
# There is no curative treatment, so long-term therapies are required.
# Therapy often includes stimulant drugs that are thought to have abuse potential.
# The rates of diagnosis and of treatment substantially differ across countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jadad AR |title=The treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: an annotated bibliography and critical appraisal of published systematic reviews and metaanalyses |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=1025–35 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10637682 |doi= |url=https://ww1.cpa-apc.org/French_Site/Publications/Archives/CJP/1999/Dec/jadad.htm |author-separator=, |author2=Booker L |author3=Gauld M |display-authors=3 |last4=Kakuma |first4=R |last5=Boyle |first5=M |last6=Cunningham |first6=CE |last7=Kim |first7=M |last8=Schachar |first8=R}}</ref>

===Skepticism about the diagnosis===
Skepticism about the validity of the diagnosis was in 2002 a minority opinion in the general U.S. population; a survey found that of the 64% who had heard of ADHD, 78% believed it to be a "real disease".<ref>{{cite journal |author=McLeod JD, Fettes DL, Jensen PS, Pescosolido BA, Martin JK |title=Public Knowledge, Beliefs, and Treatment Preferences Concerning Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=626–31 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17463342 |pmc=2365911 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.58.5.626 |url=}}</ref> In the United States, African-American parents state that their friends and family are often unsure about the legitimacy of ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olaniyan O |title=Community perspectives of childhood behavioral problems and ADHD among African American parents |journal=Ambul Pediatr |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=226–31 |year=2007 |pmid=17512883 |doi=10.1016/j.ambp.2007.02.002 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=dosReis S |author3=Garriett V |display-authors=3 |last4=Mychailyszyn |first4=Matthew P. |last5=Anixt |first5=Julia |last6=Rowe |first6=Peter C. |last7=Cheng |first7=Tina L.}}</ref> In 1998 [[Fred Baughman]] stated "ADHD is total, 100% fraud" as a counter claim to [[Russell Barkley|Russell Barkley's]] 1995 comment that "ADHD is real".<ref>{{cite book |author=Cohen, David; Gwynedd Lloyd; Joan Stead |title=Critical new perspectives on AD/HD |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2005 |pages=14 |isbn=0-415-36036-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

In 2002, [[Russell Barkley]], a prominent researcher and author on the subject of ADHD, published ''The International Consensus Statement on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)'', signed by 86 psychiatrists and psychologists, including several of the most widely published and cited researchers in psychiatry, which asserts the existence of ADHD and denies the existence of controversy within the medical community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.russellbarkley.org/images/Consensus%202002.pdf |title=www.russellbarkley.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Two critiques of their statements have since been published in the peer reviewed literature questioning the negative tone they have used to describe researchers with views differing from their own.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jureidini J |title=Does the International Consensus Statement on ADHD leave room for healthy scepticism? |journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=240; author reply 241–2 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12557837 |doi= 10.1007/s00787-002-0267-1|url= |last2=Taylor |first2=D.

In a June 2009 paper, the chair of the [[DSM-IV]] Task Force referred to one of DSM-IV’s unintended consequences as false "epidemics," attributing the sudden increases in the diagnosis of autism, bipolar disorder and ADHD to changes made in the DSM-IV definitions of those disorders.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Frances | first = Allen | date = 26 June 2009 | year = | month = | title = A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences | journal = Psychiatric Times | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = | pmid = | doi = | url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1425378?verify=0A | format = Full text | accessdate = 2009-09-06 | quote = }}</ref>

In 2002, 8% of readers of the [[British Medical Journal]] who answered an online survey listed ADHD as one of the 10 top "non-diseases". The BMJ survey defined non-diseases as meaning "a human process or problem that some have defined as a medical condition but where people may have better outcomes if the problem or process was not defined in that way." They did not deny that non-diseases do entail real problems or suffering.  For example, obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, and menopause all received a greater number of votes on this survey.<ref>http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7334/DC1</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith R |title=In search of "non-disease" |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7342 |pages=883–5 |year=2002 |month=April |pmid=11950739 |pmc=1122831 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.324.7342.883|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11950739}}</ref>

Robins and Guze's<ref>{{cite journal | author = Robins E., Guze S. B. | year = 1970 | title = Establishment of diagnostic validity in psychiatric illness: its application to schizophrenia | url = | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 126 | issue = 7| pages = 983–7 | pmid = 5409569 }}</ref> criteria assert that the validity of any diagnosis must derive from empirical research and that some of this research must examine the neurobiologic causes and correlates of disorders.
The Robins and Guze criteria view the validity of diagnoses as arising from empirical studies demonstrating the following: 1) the diagnosis has well-defined clinical correlates, 2) the diagnosis can be delimited from other diagnoses, 3) the disorder has a characteristic course and outcome, 4) the disorder shows evidence of heritability from family and genetic studies, 5) data from laboratory studies demonstrate other neurobiologic correlates of the disorder, and 6) the disorder shows a characteristic response to treatment.  A 2005 review recognizes the ongoing controversial nature of ADHD among both clinicians and the general public.  It found that it fulfills the Robins and Guze criteria which support the idea that ADHD is a valid diagnostic category.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Faraone SV |title=The scientific foundation for understanding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as a valid psychiatric disorder |journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15756510 |doi=10.1007/s00787-005-0429-z |url=}}</ref>  A 2008 review, however, came to the opposite conclusion and states that: "Evidence for a genetic or neuroanatomic cause of ADHD is insufficient.

===Concerns about methods of diagnosis===
ADHD is controversial in part because most children are diagnosed and treated based on decisions made by their parents and clinicians with teachers being the primary source of diagnostic information.  Only a minority, about 20%, of children who end up with a diagnosis of ADHD show hyperactive behavior in the physician's office.<ref>Meyers p.5</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sleator EK, Ullmann RK |title=Can the physician diagnose hyperactivity in the office? |journal=Pediatrics |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=13–7 |year=1981 |month=January |pmid=7243422 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.continuingedcourses.net/active/courses/course004.php |title=ADHD in Children: Diagnosis and Assessment by Russell A. Barkley, Ph.D. |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The number of people diagnosed with ADHD in the U.S. and UK has grown dramatically over a short period of time.  Critics of the diagnosis, such as Dan P. Hallahan and James M. Kauffman in their book ''Exceptional Learners: Introduction to Special Education'', have argued that this increase is due to the ADHD diagnostic criteria being sufficiently general or vague to allow virtually anybody with persistent unwanted behaviors to be classified as having ADHD of one type or another, and that the symptoms are not supported by sufficient [[empirical]] data.<ref>Hallahn, Dan P.; Kauffman, James M.. ''Exceptional Learners : Introduction to Special Education'' Allyn & Bacon; 10th edition (April 8, 2005) [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0205444210/ ISBN 0-205-44421-0]</ref>

===Over / under diagnosis===
Overdiagnosis typically refers to children who are diagnosed with ADHD but should not be. These instances are termed as “false positives”. However, the “presence of false positives alone does not indicate overdiagnosis”. There may be evidence of overdiagnosis if inaccuracies are shown consistently in the accepted prevalence rates or in the diagnostic process itself.<ref name="Sciutto, M. J. 2007">Sciutto, M. J., & Eisenberg, M. (2007). Evaluating the Evidence For and Against the Overdiagnosis of ADHD. Journal of Attention Disorders, 11(2), 106-113. Retrieved March 5, 2012 from PsychINFO database.</ref> 

There is also evidence of possible differences of race and ethnicity in the prevalence of ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD dramatically varies across cultures despite the fact that the same methodology has been used. Some believe this may be due to different perceptions of what clarifies as disruptive behavior, inattention and hyperactivity.<ref name="Cuffe, S. P. 2005">Cuffe, S. P., Moore, C. G., & McKeown, R. E. (2005). Prevalence and Correlates of ADHD Symptoms in the National Health Interview Survey. Journal of Attention Disorders, 9(2), 	392-401. Retrieved March 6, 2012 from PsychINFO database.</ref>

It is argued that over-diagnosis occurs more in well-off or less heterogeneous communities, whereas under-diagnosis occurs more frequently in poorer and minority communities due to lack of resources and lack of financial access. It is further believed that the “distribution of ADHD diagnosis falls along socioeconomic lines”, according to the amount of wealth within a neighborhood. Therefore, the difficulty of applying national, general guidelines to localized and specific contexts, such as where referral is unavailable, resources are lacking or the patient is uninsured, may assist in the establishment of a misdiagnosis of ADHD.<ref>Morely, C. P. (2010). Disparities in ADHD Assessment, Diagnosis and Treatment. International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine, 40(4), 383-389. Retrieved March 6, 2012 from 	PsychINFO database.</ref> 

Development can also influence perception of relevant ADHD symptoms. ADHD is viewed as a chronic disorder that develops in childhood and continues into adulthood. However, some research shows a decline in the symptoms of ADHD as children grow up and mature into adulthood. As children move into the stage of adolescence, the most common reporters of ADHD symptoms, parents and teachers, tend to focus on behaviors affecting academic performance. Some research has shown that the primary symptoms of ADHD were strong discriminators in parent ratings, but differed for specific age groups. Hyperactivity  was a stronger discriminator of ADHD in children, while inattentiveness was a stronger discriminator in adolescents.<ref name="Harrison, J. R. 2011">Harrison, J. R., Vannest, K. J., & Reynolds, C. R. (2011). Behaviors That Discriminate ADHD in 	Children and Adolescents: Primary Symptoms, Symptoms of Comorbid Conditions or 	Indicators of Functional Impairment? Journal of Attention Disorders, 15(2), 147-160. 	Retrieved March 6, 2012 from PsychINFO database.</ref> 

Issues with comorbidity is another possible explanation in favor of the argument of overdiagnosis. As many as 75% of diagnosed children with ADHD meet criteria for some other psychiatric diagnosis.<ref name="Cuffe, S. P. 2005"/> Among children diagnosed with ADHD, about 25% to 30% have anxiety disorders, 9% to 32% have depression, 45% to 84% have oppositional defiant disorder, and 44% to 55% of adolescents have conduct disorder.<ref name="Harrison, J. R. 2011"/> Learning disorders are found in 20% to 40% of children with ADHD.<ref name="Cuffe, S. P. 2005"/> 

The debate of underdiagnosis has also been discussed, specifically in literature concerning ADHD among adults, girls and underprivileged communities. It is estimated that in the adult population, rates of ADHD are somewhere between 4% and 6%.<ref>Able, S. L., Johnston, J. A., Adler, L. A., & Swindle R. W. (2007). Functional and psychosocial 	impairment in adults with undiagnosed ADHD. Psychological Medicine, 37, 97-107. 	Retrieved March 10, 2012 from PsychINFO database.</ref> However, as little as 11% of these adults with ADHD actually receive assessment, and furthermore, any form of treatment.<ref>Kessler, R.

Retrieved March 10, 2012 from PsychINFO database.</ref>  Between 30% and 70% of children with ADHD report at least one impairing symptom of ADHD in adulthood, and 30% to 50% still meet diagnostic criteria for an ADHD diagnosis.<ref>Manos, M.

Research on gender differences also reveals an argument for underdiagnosis of ADHD among girls. The ratio for male-to-female is 4:1 with 92% of girls with ADHD receiving a primarily inattentive subtype diagnosis.<ref name="Cuffe, S. P. 2005"/> This difference in gender can be explained, for the majority, by the different ways boys and girls express symptoms of this particular disorder.<ref name="Bruchmuller, K. 2012">Bruchmuller, K., Margraf, J., & Schneider S.

Retrieved March 6, 2012 from 	PsychINFO database.</ref> Typically, girls with ADHD exhibit less disruptive behaviors and more internalizing behaviors.<ref name="Sciutto, M. J. 2007"/> Girls tend to show fewer behavioral problems, show fewer aggressive behaviors, are less impulsive, and are less hyperactive than boys diagnosed with ADHD. These patterns of behavior are less likely to disrupt the classroom or home setting, therefore allowing parents and teachers to easily overlook or neglect the presence of a potential problem.<ref name="Bruchmuller, K. 2012"/> 

As stated previously, underdiagnosis is also believed to be seen in more underprivileged communities. These communities tend to be poorer and inhabit more minorities. More than 50% of children with mental health needs do not receive assessment or treatment. Access to mental health services and resources differs on a wide range of factors, such as “gender, age, race or ethnicity and health insurance”. Therefore, children deserving of an ADHD diagnosis may never receive this confirmation and are not identified or represented in prevalence rates.<ref name="Sciutto, M. J. 2007"/>

In 2005 82% of teachers in the United States considered ADHD to be over diagnosed while 3% considered it to be under diagnosed.  In China 19% of teachers considered ADHD to be over diagnosed while 57% considered it to be under diagnosed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Norvilitis JM, Fang P |title=Perceptions of ADHD in China and the United States: a preliminary study |journal=J Atten Disord |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=413–24 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16371664 |doi=10.1177/1087054705281123 |url=}}</ref>

===Changing diagnostic criteria===
For over seventy years in the United States, symptoms of what is now called ADHD have had different labels.<ref name=suffer>{{cite web |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/0/9/2/9/p209292_index.html |title=Suffer the Restless Children: ADHD, Psychostimulants, and the Politics of Pediatric Mental Health |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The fact that the diagnostic criteria and the name used to describe the set of characteristics that make up ADHD have changed over time has led to concerns.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jadad AR |title=The treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: an annotated bibliography and critical appraisal of published systematic reviews and metaanalyses |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=1025–35 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10637682 |doi= |url=https://ww1.cpa-apc.org/French_Site/Publications/Archives/CJP/1999/Dec/jadad.htm |accessdate=2009-05-02 |author-separator=, |author2=Booker L |author3=Gauld M |display-authors=3 |last4=Kakuma |first4=R |last5=Boyle |first5=M |last6=Cunningham |first6=CE |last7=Kim |first7=M |last8=Schachar |first8=R}}</ref>

Suggestions have been made for a potential revision of the DSM-IV to prevent misdiagnosis, specifically for ADHD. A revision would help with deciphering between the common clinical profiles of “pure ADHD” and ADHD with comorbid externalizing behaviors, like conduct disorder and oppositional-defiant disorder, and internalizing behaviors, like anxiety.<ref name="Harrison, J. R. 2011"/>  A reason for this distinction is due to behaviors exhibited by children with ADHD that are actually related to functional impairment caused by symptoms of comorbid disorders.<ref>Klimkeit, E., Graham, C., Lee, P., Morling, M., Russon, D., & Tonge, B.

===Views of ADHD outside North America===
In 2009, the British Psychological Society and the Royal College of Psychiatrists, in collaboration with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), released a set of diagnosis and treatment guidelines for ADHD.<ref name = NICE2008/> These guidelines reviewed studies by Ford et al. that found that 3.6% of boys and 0.85% of girls in Britain qualified for a diagnosis of ADHD using the American DSM-IV guidelines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ford T, Goodman R, Meltzer H |title=The British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey 1999: the prevalence of DSM-IV disorders |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=1203–11 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14560170 |doi=10.1097/01.chi.0000081820.25107.ae |doi_brokendate=2010-01-07}}</ref> The guidelines go on to state that the prevalence drops to 1.5% when using the ICD-10 diagnosis of Hyperkinetic Disorder.

A systematic review of the literature in 2007 found that the worldwide prevalence of ADHD was 5.29%, and that there were no significant differences in prevalence rates between North America and Europe.  The review did find differences between prevalence rates in North America and those in Africa and the Middle East, but cautioned that this may be due to the small number of studies available from those regions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.6.942 |title=The Worldwide Prevalence of ADHD: A Systematic Review and Metaregression Analysis |year=2007 |last1=Polanczyk |first1=G. |last2=De Lima |first2=M.

Norwegian National Broadcasting ([[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]]) broadcast a short television series in early 2005 on the extreme increase in the use of Ritalin and Concerta for children.  Sales were six times higher in 2004 than in 2002.  The series included the announcement of a successful group therapy program for 127 unmedicated children aged four to eight, some with ADHD and some with [[oppositional defiant disorder]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/puls/4710766.html | title= Mister diagnosen AD/HD |accessdate= 2009-05-09 |last= Bergløff |first= Charlotte Berrefjord | coauthors= Tor Risberg, Kjell Herning |date= 2 May 2005 |year= |month= |work= |publisher= Norwegian National Broadcasting |language=  Norwegian |quote= title, translated: [They] Lose the Diagnosis AD/HD}}</ref>

They have testified at Congressional hearings on the use of Ritalin and supported legal challenges such as the [[Ritalin class action lawsuits]].  There is also a movement called [[critical psychiatry]] that often refers to their writings, but in contrast to Scientologists (see below), they are not "anti-psychiatry," but critics of some of its practices and offer alternative models and perspectives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mentalhealth.freeuk.com/what.htm|title=what is critical psychiatry |accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>

===Scientology===
The [[Church of Scientology]], which [[Scientology and psychiatry|opposes]] all forms of psychiatry, has vocally criticized ADHD and its treatments<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fahlén T |title=[Church of Scientology and criticism of ADHD] |language=Swedish |journal=Lakartidningen |volume=99 |issue=12 |pages=1373–4 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11998173 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and played a leading role in the anti-Ritalin campaign in the late 1980s.<ref>http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/summary/269/18/2369</ref> The church states that treatment merely lessens the symptoms rather than addresses the underlying cause,<ref>[http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/ Scientology's war on psychiatry - Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "mental and behavioral problems are largely incorrect diagnoses that cover symptoms and don't handle the real problems, which may be physical or spiritual".<ref>http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,595091823,00.html?pg=3</ref>

===Personality trait===
Some believe that many of the traits of those diagnosed with ADHD are personality traits and are not indicative of a disorder.  These traits may be undesirable in modern society, leading to difficulty functioning in society, and thus have been labeled as a disorder.<ref>http://adhdtexas.com/addptod.htm</ref> Some conservatives see ADHD as being an attack on masculine traits and the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD as an attack on traditional management of behavioral traits such as by discipline as well as intervention of the state into the sanctity of the family and the private citizen.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dr Jennifer Erkulwater; Dr Rick Mayes; Dr Catherine Bagwell |title=Medicating Children: ADHD and Pediatric Mental Health |publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge |year=2009 |pages=146 |isbn=0-674-03163-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Author and media consultant [[Garret LoPorto|Garret John LoPorto]] has written extensively on the link between ADHD and creativity.

==Questions concerning the cause==
The pathophysiology of ADHD is unclear and there are a number of competing theories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uptodate.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=behavior/8293&selectedTitle=4~150&source=search_result |title=Evaluation and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children |accessdate=2008-09-15 |work= |publisher= |date=December 5, 2007}}</ref>

===ADHD as a biological illness===
One of the most controversial issues regarding ADHD is whether it is wholly or even predominantly a biological illness leading to a chemical or structural defect in the brain.  The current predominance of opinion in medicine is that ADHD is a mixture of genetics and the environment however the [[pathophysiology]] is unclear at this time.<ref name=Dopheide2001>{{Cite book| last1 = Dopheide   | first1 = Julie A.| title = American Pharmaceutical Association 148th Annual Meeting| publisher = APhA 2001| date = March 16–20, 2001| contribution = ADHD Part 1: Current Status, Diagnosis, Etiology/Pathophysiology| contribution-url =  http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/418518| accessdate = 2009-04-18}}</ref> [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Pathophysiology|Frequently observed differences]] in the brain between ADHD and non-ADHD patients have been discovered,<ref>[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/brain-matures-a-few-years-late-in-adhd-but-follows-normal-pattern.shtml Brain Matures a Few Years Late in ADHD, But Follows Normal Pattern] NIMH Press Release, November 12, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/gene-predicts-better-outcome-as-cortex-normalizes-in-teens-with-adhd.shtml Gene Predicts Better Outcome as Cortex Normalizes in Teens with ADHD] NIMH Press Release, August 6, 2007</ref><ref name="pmid17113158">{{cite journal |author=Coccaro EF, Hirsch SL, Stein MA |title=Plasma homovanillic acid correlates inversely with history of learning problems in healthy volunteer and personality disordered subjects |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=149 |issue=1–3 |pages=297–302 |year=2007 |pmid=17113158 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2006.05.009}}</ref> but it is uncertain if or how these differences give rise to the [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder#Symptoms|symptoms of ADHD]].

Although ADHD is said to be highly heritable and twin studies suggest genetics are a factor in about 75% of ADHD cases, it has been argued that ADHD is a [[Heterogeneous#Locus_.28Non-allelic.29_Heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] disorder <ref name="Barkley">{{cite web|url=http://www.continuingedcourses.net/active/courses/course003.php|title=Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Nature, Course, Outcomes, and Comorbidity|last=Barkley|first=Russel A.|accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors and thus cannot be modeled accurately using the single gene theory. Authors of a review of ADHD etiology have noted: "Although several genome-wide searches have identified chromosomal regions that are predicted to contain genes that contribute to ADHD susceptibility, to date no single gene with a major contribution to ADHD has been identified."<ref>{{cite journal | author=M.

The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database has a listing for ADHD under autosomal dominant heritable conditions, claiming that multiple genes contribute to the disorder.

===Hunter vs. farmer hypothesis of ADHD===
{{Main|Hunter vs. farmer hypothesis}}

The hunter vs. farmer hypothesis is an idea proposed by author [[Thom Hartmann]] about the origins of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who believes that these conditions may be a result of adaptive behavior of the species, his theory states that those with ADHD retain some of the older hunter characteristics.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hartmann, Thom |title=The Edison gene: ADHD and the gift of the hunter child |publisher=Park Street Press |location=Rochester, Vt |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-89281-128-5 |oclc= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=L0l5EaHppyoC&dq=hunter+vs+farmer+The+Edison+Gene:+ADHD+and+the+Gift+of+the+Hunter+Child |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Concerns about medication==
The [[National Institute of Mental Health]] recommends [[stimulant]]s for the treatment of ADHD, and states that, "under medical supervision, stimulant medications are considered safe".<ref name=NIMH/> A 2007 drug class review found no evidence of any differences in efficacy or side effects in the stimulants commonly prescribed.<ref>McDonagh MS, Peterson K, Dana T, Thakurta S. (2007). Drug Class Review on Pharmacologic Treatments for ADHD. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=adhd.chapter.53 Results] "lack of evidence of a difference between the drugs studied in efficacy or adverse events."</ref> However, the use of stimulant medications for the treatment of ADHD has generated controversy because of undesirable side effects, uncertain long term effects, and social and ethical issues regarding their use and dispensation.

===Frequency of stimulant use===
In the 1990s the United States used 90% of the stimulants produced globally, in the 2000s this has decreased to 80% due to increased use in other areas of the world.<ref name=USE2003>{{cite journal|last=Marwick|first=C.|date=2003-01-11|title=US doctor warns of misuse of prescribed stimulants|journal=BMJ|location=Washington, DC|volume=326|issue=7380|page=67|issn=09598138|doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7380.67|pmc=1125021|pmid=12521954|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/326/7380/67}}</ref> The UK uses one tenth while France and Italy use one twentieth the methylphenidate per capita as the USA.<ref name=USE2003/>

On May 2000, the testimony of DEA Deputy Director Terrance Woodworth has shown that the Ritalin quota increased from 1,768 kg in 1990 to 14,957 kg in 2000.

Stimulants are known as Schedule II controlled substances. The DEA constructed the data of Schedule II drugs from the point of manufacture to the point of distribution to the consumer which revealed the variation in the levels of use of Ritalin and Adderall across the nation. The top five states in 1999 for Ritalin and Adderall usage were: New Hampshire with 5,525g/100,000 population; Vermont with 5,005g, Michigan was 4,848; Iowa 4,638; and Delaware 4,439.

Animal research on the [[neurotoxicity]] of [[amphetamines]] has found contradictory results. For example in rats doses of amphetamines equivalent to those used therapeutically to treat ADHD were suggestive of benefits to the dopamine system. In [[primates]] therapeutic equivalent doses were found to cause reductions in striatal dopamine transporter density.  Humans with ADHD were also found to have increased striatal dopamine transporter density that is reduced by ADHD medications. More research has been recommended into the long-term effects of amphetamines in the treatment of ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Advokat C |title=Update on amphetamine neurotoxicity and its relevance to the treatment of ADHD |journal=J Atten Disord |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=8–16 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17606768 |doi=10.1177/1087054706295605 |url=}}</ref>

===Coercion===
It is often not a child's decision to take medication, especially those under the age of six, a group that is seeing a dramatic increase in the prescription of psychiatric medications.  Some schools have attempted to require treatment with medications before allowing a child to attend school.<ref name=Coercion>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/news/20051116/schools-cant-require-adhd-drugs |title=Schools Can't Require ADHD Drugs |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The United States has passed a bill against this practice.<ref name=Coercion/>  Thus ethical concerns regarding forced treatment or [[coercion]] of minors arise.  Some suspect that children are using stimulants as a [[cognitive enhancer]] at the request of their achievement-oriented parents.<ref name=Nature2008/>

===Non specific nature===
Stimulants are often seen as [[cognitive enhancers]] or ''smart drugs''.  Their effects are non-specific with similar results seen in children and adults with and without ADHD.

===Stimulant misuse===
Stimulants are controlled psychotropic substances. They are classified as Schedule II substances (Schedule II: Potential for abuse; potential for psychological or physical addiction; currently accepted medical use).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/36/21/20|author=Jim Rosack|title=Controversy Erupts Over Ads for ADHD Drugs|volume=36|issue=21|page=20|journal=Psychiatr News |format= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Controversy has surrounded whether methylphenidate is as commonly abused as other stimulants with many{{who|date=October 2010}} proposing that its rate of abuse is much lower than other stimulants. However, the majority of studies assessing its abuse potential scores have determined that it has an abuse potential similar to that of [[cocaine]] and [[d-amphetamine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kollins SH, MacDonald EK, Rush CR |title=Assessing the abuse potential of methylphenidate in nonhuman and human subjects: a review |journal=Pharmacol.

Both children with and without ADHD abuse stimulants, with ADHD individuals being at the highest risk of abusing or diverting their stimulant prescriptions. Between 16 and 29 percent of students who are prescribed stimulants report diverting their prescriptions. Between 5 and 9 percent of grade/primary and high school children and between 5 and 35 percent of college students have used nonprescribed stimulants. Most often their motivation is to concentrate, improve alertness, "get high," or to experiment.<ref name="Wilens TE, Adler LA, Adams J, et al. 2008 21–31">{{cite journal |author=Wilens TE |title=Misuse and diversion of stimulants prescribed for ADHD: a systematic review of the literature |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=21–31 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18174822 |doi=10.1097/chi.0b013e31815a56f1 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Adler LA |author3=Adams J |display-authors=3 |last4=Sgambati |first4=Stephanie |last5=Rotrosen |first5=John |last6=Sawtelle |first6=Robert |last7=Utzinger |first7=Linsey |last8=Fusillo |first8=Steven}}</ref>

==Substance use disorders==
Studies investigating whether stimulant medication can lead to drug abuse later in life found that despite the higher rate of substance abuse among ADHD patients as a whole, stimulant medication use in childhood did not affect or lowered, the risk for substance of abuse in adulthood compared to unmedicated individuals with ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kollins SH |title=ADHD, substance use disorders, and psychostimulant treatment: current literature and treatment guidelines |journal=Journal of Attention Disorders |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=115–25 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18192623 |doi=10.1177/1087054707311654}}</ref>

A 2009 review, and a 2006 study, found that those who had received stimulants during childhood showed the highest number of cocaine abusers in adulthood, twice that of the other groups thus suggesting that stimulant use during childhood was associated with sensitising or predisposing children to cocaine abuse later in life. Smoking tobacco also appeared to increase the risk of cocaine abuse in this population but even after controlling for tobacco exposure cocaine abuse was still significantly higher in adults who had been medicated with stimulants as children. This risk was still present 15 years after stimulant medication exposure.<ref>{{cite web |first=National |last= Institutes of Health |author=Susan Schenk |coauthors=Emily S.

==Financial conflicts of interest==

[[Russell Barkley]], a well known ADHD researcher, admits to taking money from drug companies for speaking and consultancy fees.

==Concerns about the impact of labeling==
[[Russell Barkley]] believes labeling is a double-edged sword; there are many pitfalls to labeling but by using a precise label, services can be accessed. He also believes that labeling can help the individual understand and make an informed decision how best to deal with the disorder using evidence based knowledge.<ref name="autogenerated5">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/interviews/barkley.html PBS - frontline: medicating kids: interviews: russell barkley<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Furthermore studies also show that the education of the siblings and parents has at least a short term impact on the outcome of treatment.<ref name="autogenerated3">Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/JAACAP_ADHD_2007.pdf</ref> Barkley states this about ADHD rights: "... because of various legislation that has been passed to protect them. There are special education laws with the Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, mentioning ADHD as an eligible condition. If you change the label, and again refer to it as just some variation in normal temperament, these people will lose access to these services, and will lose these hard-won protections that keep them from being discriminated against. ..."<ref name="autogenerated5" /> Psychiatrist Harvey Parker, who founded CHADD, states, "we should be celebrating the fact that school districts across the country are beginning to understand and recognize kids with ADHD, and are finding ways of treating them. We should celebrate the fact that the general public doesn't look at ADHD kids as "bad" kids, as brats, but as kids who have a problem that they can  overcome".<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/interviews/parker.html PBS - frontline: medicating kids: interviews: harvey parker<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, children may be ridiculed at school by their peers for using [[psychiatric medications]] including those for ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Santosh PJ, Taylor E |title=Stimulant drugs |journal=European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=9 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=I27–43 |year=2000 |pmid=11140778 |doi=10.1007/s007870070017}}</ref>

In a segment entitled ''Backlash'', [[Fred Baughman]], retired [[neurologist]], and [[Peter Breggin]], founder of the 'International Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology', the two of whom PBS described as "outspoken critics who insist [ADHD] is a fraud perpetrated by the psychiatric and pharmaceutical industries on families anxious to understand their children's behavior,"<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/backlash PBS - frontline: medicating kids: opponents and backlash<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> were interviewed on the legitimacy of the disorder. Russell Barkley and Xavier Castellanos, then head of ADHD research at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), defended the viability of the disorder, although Castellanos stated that little is scientifically understood.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/interviews/castellanos.html PBS - frontline: medicating kids: interviews: xavier castellanos, m.d<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The validity of the work of many of the ADHD "experts" (including Dr. Biederman) has been called into question by Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of The [[New England Journal of Medicine]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nybooks.com/authors/10553 |title= Marcia Angell |accessdate= 2009-07-21 |author= |date=  |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= The New York Review of Books |quote= Marcia Angell is a Senior Lecturer in Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

In 1998, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) released a consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. The statement, while recognizing that stimulant treatment is controversial, supports the validity of the ADHD diagnosis and the efficacy of stimulant treatment. It found controversy only in the lack of sufficient data on long-term use of medications, and in the need for more research in many areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110PDF.pdf |publisher=National Institutes of Health |title=Diagnosis and Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)|journal=NIH Consens Statement |author=(not given)|date=1998 Nov 16-18 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=1–37}}</ref>

[[House of Lords|Baroness]] [[Susan Greenfield]], a leading neuroscientist, wanted a wide-ranging inquiry in the House of Lords into the dramatic increase in the diagnosis of ADHD in the UK and its possible causes.<ref name=pcfadhdcr>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/health/7093944.stm | work=BBC News | title=Peer calls for ADHD care review | date=2007-11-14 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> This followed a BBC Panorama programme in 2007 which highlighted US research (The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD by the University of Buffalo showing treatment results of 600) suggesting drugs are no better than therapy for ADHD in the long-term.<ref name=pcfadhdcr/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7090011.stm |title=Questions over drugs for ADHD | date = 12 November 2007 |publisher=BBC |location=United Kingdom }}</ref> In the UK medication use is increasing dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Other notable individuals have made controversial statements about ADHD.

The [[British Psychological Society]] said in a 1997 report that physicians and psychiatrists should not follow the American example of applying medical labels to such a wide variety of attention-related disorders: "The idea that children who don't attend or who don't sit still in school have a mental disorder is not entertained by most British clinicians."<ref name="Reason R 1999 85–91">{{Cite journal|author=Reason R |title=ADHD: a psychological response to an evolving concept.

However, it states that the diagnosis lack any biological basis and that "[c]ontroversial issues surround changing thresholds applied to the definition of illness as new knowledge and treatments are developed and the extent to which it is acknowledged that clinical thresholds are socially and culturally influenced and determine how an individual's level of functioning within the 'normal cultural environment' is assessed". It further states that "the acceptable thresholds for impairment are partly driven by the contemporary societal view of what is an acceptable level of deviation from the norm."

=== Scientology ===
An article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that  "the uproar over Ritalin was triggered almost single-handedly by the Scientology movement."<ref name="LA Times">{{cite news | first=Joel | last=Sappell | coauthors= Welkos, Robert W. | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062990a,1,6085874,full.story?coll=la-news-comment | title=Suits, Protests Fuel a Campaign Against Psychiatry | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | page=A48:1 | date=1990-06-29 | accessdate=2006-11-29}} Backup copy [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90-6b.html link here]</ref> The [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]], an [[anti-psychiatry]] group formed by Scientologists in 1969, conducted a major campaign against Ritalin in the 1980s and lobbied Congress for an investigation of Ritalin.<ref name="LA Times" /> [[Scientology]] publications identified the "real target of the campaign" as "the psychiatric profession itself" and said that the campaign "brought wide acceptance of the fact that (the commission){{sic}}<!-- formatting as in original Times article --> and the Scientologists are the ones effectively doing something about [...] psychiatric drugging".<ref name="LA Times" /> However, [[Robert Whitaker]] in his book, [[Anatomy of an epidemic]] stated that ever since Eli Lilly used Scientology to their benefit to dismiss concerns regarding Prozac, drug companies have successfully conditioned the public and the media to associate criticisms and controversies surrounding psychotropic drugs to being part of a Scientology conspiracy against their products and psychiatry in general.<ref name="anatomy_of_an_epidemic_a01">{{Cite book | last1 = Whitaker | first1 = Robert H. | title = Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JaWtPwAACAAJ | date = 13 April 2010 | publisher = Crown Publishing Group (NY) | location = USA | isbn = 0-307-45241-7 | quote = The wonder drug aura around Prozac had been restored, and the public and the media had been conditioned to associated criticism of psychiatric drugs with Scientology. | pages = 292–295 }}</ref>

The well-known Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]]'s interview with [[Matt Lauer]] was widely watched by the public. In this interview he spoke about the use of medications for mood disorders and also referred to Ritalin and other medications as being "street drugs".  The sale of stimulants on campuses is not uncommon; they are used by non ADHD students to tackle drudgery.<ref>"Latest Campus High: Illicit use of Prescription Medication, Experts and Students Say" NY Times Page B8 3/24/2000.</ref>

==Imitation of symptoms==
The symptoms of ADHD can be [[malingering|faked]] fairly easily; possible motives include access to stimulant drugs and/or academic resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mouse-man/201007/how-easy-is-it-fake-adhd|title=How easy is it to fake ADHD?|last=Newton|first=Philip M.|date=July 3, 2010|work=Psychology Today|publisher=From Mouse to Man}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/a0018857}}</ref>
