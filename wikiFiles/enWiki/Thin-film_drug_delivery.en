'''Thin-film drug delivery''' uses a '''dissolving film''' or '''oral drug strip''' to administer [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] via absorption in the mouth ([[Cheeks|buccally]] or [[sublingual]]ly) and/or via the small intestines ([[enteric coating|enterically]]).  A film is prepared using [[hydrophilic]] polymers that rapidly dissolves on the tongue or buccal cavity, [[Drug delivery|delivering]] the drug to the [[systemic circulation]] via [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] when contact with [[liquid]] is made.

Thin-film drug delivery has emerged as an advanced alternative to the traditional [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] and liquids often associated with [[prescription drug|prescription]] and [[over-the-counter drug|OTC]] medications.  Similar in size, shape and thickness to a [[postage stamp]], thin-film strips are typically designed for [[Routes of administration|oral administration]], with the user placing the strip on or under{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} the tongue (sublingual) or along the inside of the cheek (buccal). These drug delivery options allow the medication to bypass the first pass metabolism thereby making the medication more bioavailable.<ref>[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/07/buccal-drug-delivery-system/ Buccal Drug Delivery Systems]</ref> As the strip dissolves, the drug can enter the blood stream enterically, buccally or sublingually. Evaluating the systemic [[transmucosal]] drug delivery, the [[buccal mucosa]] is the preferred region as compared to the sublingual mucosa.

Different buccal delivery products have been marketed or are proposed for certain diseases like [[trigeminal neuralgia]], [[Meniere's disease]], [[diabetes]], and [[addiction]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  There are many commercial non-drug product to use thin films like Meltz Super Thin Mints and [[Listerine PocketPak]]s [[breath freshener|breath freshening strips]]. Since then, thin-film products for other breath fresheners, as well as a number of cold, flu, anti-snoring and gastrointestinal medications, have entered the marketplace. There are currently{{When|date=February 2011}} several projects in development that will deliver prescription drugs using the thin-film [[dosage form]].<ref>"Oral Thin Films," in Orally Disintegrating Tablet and Film Technologies, 5th ed. (Technology Catalysts International, Falls Church, VA, 2008)</ref>

Formulation of oral drug strips involves the application of both aesthetic and performance characteristics such as strip-forming polymers, [[plasticizers]], active pharmaceutical ingredient, sweetening agents, [[saliva]] stimulating agent, flavoring agents, coloring agents, stabilizing and thickening agents. From the regulatory perspectives, all [[excipient]]s used in the formulation of oral drug strips should be approved for use in oral pharmaceutical [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] forms.

Undergraduate [[biomedical engineering]] students at [[Johns Hopkins University]] have created a new drug delivery system based on the thin-film technology used by a breath freshener. Laced with a [[vaccine]] against [[rotavirus]], the strips could be used to provide the vaccine to infants in impoverished areas.<ref name="Drug delivery via Dissolving strips">{{cite journal| title=Drug Delivery Via Dissolving Strips.| journal= Drug Discovery & Development| year=2007| volume=10|issue=7|page=10|issn=1524783X}}</ref>

==Oral drug strip development==
===Strip forming polymers===
The polymer employed should be non-toxic, non-irritant and devoid of leachable impurities. It should have good wetting and spreadability property. The polymer should exhibit sufficient peel, shear and tensile strengths. The polymer should be readily available and should not be very expensive. Film obtained should be tough enough so that there won't be any damage while handling or during transportation. Combination of [[microcrystalline]] [[cellulose]] and [[maltodextrin]] has been used to formulate Oral Strips of piroxicam made by hot melt extrusion technique. Pullulan has been the most widely used film former (used in Listerine PocketPak, Benadryl, etc.)

===Plasticizer===
Plasticizer is a vital ingredient of the OS formulation. It helps to improve the flexibility of the strip and reduces the brittleness of the strip. Plasticizer significantly improves the strip properties by reducing the glass transition temperature of the polymer. [[Glycerol]], [[Propylene glycol]], low molecular weight [[polyethylene glycols]], [[phthalate]] derivatives like [[dimethyl]], [[diethyl]] and [[dibutyl phthalate]], [[Citrate]] derivatives such as tributyl, triethyl, acetyl citrate, [[triacetin]] and [[castor oil]] are some of the commonly used plasticizer excipients.

===Active pharmaceutical ingredient===
Since the size of the dosage form has limitation, high-dose molecules are difficult to be incorporated in OS. Generally 5%w/w to 30%w/w of active pharmaceutical ingredients can be incorporated in the OS.<ref name="Oral Strip technology">{{cite journal| last1= Dixit |first1=  R. |last2= Puthli |first2= S.|year= 2009| title=Oral strip technology: Overview and future potential.|journal= Journal of Controlled Release| volume= 139|location= Mumbai,India| issue=2| pages=94–107 |pmid=19559740| doi= 10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.06.014}}</ref>

===Sweeting, flavoring and coloring agent===
An important aspect of thin film drug technology is its taste and color. The sweet taste in formulation is more important in case of [[pediatric]] population. Natural sweeteners as well as artificial sweeteners are used to improve the flavor of the mouth dissolving formulations for the flavors changes from individual to individual. Pigments such as titaniumdioxide is  incorporated for coloring.

===Stabilizing and thickening agents===
The stabilizing and thickening agents are employed to improve the [[viscosity]] and consistency of dispersion or solution of the strip preparation solution or suspension before casting. Drug content uniformity is a requirement for all dosage forms, particularly those containing low dose highly potent drugs. To uniquely meet this requirement, thin film formulations contain uniform dispersions of drug throughout the whole manufacturing process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgdrg/cpg460-600.html |title=FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs, Sec. 460.600 Content Uniformity Testing of Tablets and Capsules |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref>  Since this criterion is essential for the quality of the thin film and final pharmaceutical dosage form, the use of Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) was recommended to follow the manufacturing process.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0255-2701(98)00032-4 | first1=S |last1= Le Person |first2= J.R. |last2=Puiggali |first3= M. |last3=Baron |first4= M. | title=Near infrared drying of pharmaceutical thin films: experimental analysis of internal mass transport |last4= Roques |journal= Chem.

==Advantages==
The design of thin film, often referred to as PharmFilm, as an oral drug delivery technology offers several advantages over other modes of drug delivery, such as ingestible tablets, chewable tablets, orally dissolving tablets, softgels, liquids or inhalants:<ref name="ispub2006">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijpharm/vol4n2/drug.xml | title=Fast Dissolving Drug Delivery Systems: A Brief Overview. |journal=The Internet Journal of Pharmacology |year=2006 | volume= 4 |issue=2 |publisher=Ispub.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-21 | first1= S. |last1= Biradar |first2= S |last2= Bhagavati |first3= I |last3= Kuppasad}}</ref>

*The [[sublingual]] and [[Cheek|buccal]] delivery of a drug via thin film has the potential to improve the onset of action, lower the dosing, and enhance the efficacy and safety profile of the medicament.
**All tablet dosage forms, softgels and liquid formulations primarily enter the blood stream via the gastrointestinal tract, which subjects the drug to degradation from stomach acid, bile, digestive enzymes and other first-pass effects. As a result, such formulations often require higher doses and generally have a delayed onset of action.
**Conversely, buccal and sublingual thin-film drug delivery can avoid these issues and yield quicker onsets of action at lower doses.
*Thin film is more stable, durable and quicker dissolving than other conventional dosage forms.
*Thin film enables improved dosing accuracy relative to liquid formulations since every strip is manufactured to contain a precise amount of the drug.
*Thin film not only ensures more accurate administration of drugs but also can improve compliance due to the intuitive nature of the dosage form and its inherent ease of administration. These properties are especially beneficial for pediatric, geriatric and neurodegenerative disease patients where proper and complete dosing can be difficult.
*Thin film's ability to dissolve rapidly without the need for water provides an alternative to patients with swallowing disorders and to patients suffering from nausea, such as those patients receiving chemotherapy.
*Thin film drug delivery has the potential to allow the development of sensitive drug targets that may otherwise not be possible in tablet or liquid formulations.
*From a commercial perspective thin film drug delivery technology offers an opportunity to extend revenue lifecycles for pharmaceutical companies whose drug patent is expiring and will soon be vulnerable to generic competition.
*Sublingual film delivers a convenient, quick-dissolving therapeutic dose contained within an abuse-deterrent film matrix that cannot be crushed or injected by patients, and rapidly absorbs under the tongue to ensure compliance.
