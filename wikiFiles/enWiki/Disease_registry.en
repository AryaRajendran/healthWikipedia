'''Disease or patient registries''' are collections of secondary data related to patients with a specific diagnosis, condition, or procedure, and they play an important role in [[post marketing surveillance]] of pharmaceuticals.<ref>{{cite journal |author= McNeil JJ, Piccenna L, Ronaldson K, et al. |title= The Value of Patient-Centered Registries in Phase IV Drug Surveillance |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24050/The_Value_of_Patient_Centred_Registries_in_Phase.2.aspx | journal=Pharm Med |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=281–288|year=2010}}</ref> Registries are different from indexes in that they contain more extensive data. 

In its simplest form, a disease registry could consist of a collection of paper cards kept inside "a shoe box" by an individual physician. Most frequently registries vary in sophistication from  simple spreadsheets that only can be accessed by a small group of physicians to very complex databases that are accessed online across multiple institutions.<ref>[http://www.acponline.org/clinical_information/journals_publications/acp_internist/sep05/patient.htm#help ACP Observer, September 2005 - Patient registries: a key step to quality improvement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

They can provide health providers (or even patients) with reminders to check certain tests in order to reach certain quality goals.

==Disease Registries versus Electronic Medical Records==

Registries are less complex and simpler to set up than [[Electronic Medical Records]] that according to a recent survey are only used by 9% of small offices where almost half of the US doctors work.<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMsa0802005 NEJM - Electronic Health Records in Ambulatory Care - A National Survey of Physicians<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

An electronic medical record keeps track of all the patients a doctor follows but a registry only keeps track of a small sub population of patients with a specific condition.

==Types of medical conditions tracked by Disease Registries==

More than 130 million Americans live with chronic diseases and chronic diseases account for 70% of all deaths in the US."The medical care costs of people with chronic diseases account for more than 75% of the nation’s $2 trillion medical care costs." <ref>http://cdc.gov/nccdphp/overview.htm></ref>

Registries target certain conditions because medical expenses are unevenly distributed: most health care expenses are spent treating patients with a few chronic conditions.
<ref>[http://www.ahrq.gov/research/ria19/expriach1.htm The High Concentration of U.S. Health Care Expenditures: Research in Action, Issue 19, Chart 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

For example, the 2002 expenses with [[diabetes]] in the US was $132 billion in 2002, and this was around 12% of the US medical budget. Diabetes accounts for 25% of the Medicare budget.<ref>[http://www.dagc.org/diastatsUS.asp DAGC.ORG - Diabetes Statistics - United States<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Given this - diabetes is one of the conditions targeted by registries. Diabetes is also amenable to this because there is a target population that can be defined according to certain rules and there is evidence that certain tests like retina exams, LDL levels, HgbA1c levels can correlate with quality of care in diabetes.<ref>[http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/26/suppl_1/s33 Standards of Medical Care for Patients With Diabetes Mellitus - 26 (Supplement 1): S33 - Diabetes Care<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Because of the diabetes impact, the New York City created a HbA1C Registry (NYCAR) to help health providers keep track of patients with diabetes.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/diabetes/diabetes-nycar.shtml The NYC Hemoglobin A1C Registry (NYCAR) : Diabetes Prevention and Control Program : NYC DOHMH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Another example of disease registry is the New York State CABG Registry that tracks all cardiac bypass surgery performed in the state of New York <ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/352/21/2174 NEJM - Long-Term Outcomes of Coronary-Artery Bypass Grafting versus Stent Implantation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On a survey of 1040 US physician organizations published in Journal of the American Medical Association,<ref>[http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content-nw/full/289/4/434/TABLEJOC21257T5 JAMA - Casalino et al. 289 (4): 434 Table ABLEJOC21257T5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> diabetes registries are used by 40.3%, asthma registries are used by 31.2% of physician organizations, CHF registries are used by 34.8% and depression registries are used by 15.7%.

Other tests like pap smears are also useful to keep track in registries because there is evidence that when done annually in women of certain ages groups can detect and prevent cervical cancer.<ref>[http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=10713 Cervical cancer screening guideline: October 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Many of measures tracked are based on [[Evidence-based medicine]] and are defined and standardized  by national organizations like the [[NCQA]]

Patient registries are particularly useful for evaluating the safety of orphan drug products as well as the safety of drugs in specific populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author= McNeil JJ, Piccenna L, Ronaldson K, et al. |title= The Value of Patient-Centred Registries in Phase IV Drug Surveillance |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24050/The_Value_of_Patient_Centred_Registries_in_Phase.2.aspx | journal=Pharm Med |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=281–288|year=2010}}</ref>

==Medical Devices Registries==

Countries like Australia, Britain, Norway and Sweden<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcg.com/expertise_impact/publications/PublicationDetails.aspx?id=tcm:12-64828 |title=From Concept to Reality: Putting Value-Based Health Care into Practice in Sweden |author=Stefan Larsson, Peter Lawyer, Martin B. Silverstein |date= November 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-06|publisher=Boston Consulting Group}}</ref> have national patient registries that track patients with artificial joints.
"But the United States lacks such a national database, called a joint registry, that tracks how patients with artificial hips and knees fare. The risk in the United States that a patient will need a replacement procedure because of a flawed product or technique can be double the risk of countries with databases, according to Dr. Henrik Malchau of Massachusetts General Hospital.

"The use of joint registries has proven beneficial abroad. In Australia, regulators use such data to force manufacturers to justify why poorly performing hips or knees should remain available, and products have been withdrawn as a result. In Sweden several years ago, surgeons alerted by their national registry stopped using a badly flawed hip long before their American counterparts did. A few medical organizations here, like Kaiser Permanente, operate their own registries to good effect and the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York has recently set up a registry.
Experts say that the United States wastes billions of dollars annually on medical treatments which may not work. But the financial and human consequences are also large when evidence exists but is not collected." <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/business/29hip.html?ei=5087&em=&en=20c1a469134f79d6&ex=1217476800&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Barry | last=Meier | title=A Call for a Warning System on Artificial Joints | date=2008-07-29}}</ref>

==Cost-Effectiveness of Disease Registries==

The cost-effectiveness of a disease registry is related with the cost-effectiveness of prevention of specific medical conditions. Increasing compliance through a registry with preventive measures like children vaccination or colonoscopy screening can actually be a cost-saving measure.<ref>http://content.nejm.org/cgi/data/358/7/661/DC1/1</ref> "A mammogram every 2 years for women aged 50–69 costs only about $9,000 per year of life saved. This cost compares favorably with other widely used clinical preventive services." <ref>[http://cdc.gov/nccdphp/overview.htm Chronic Disease - Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Disease registries and Pay-for-Performance (P4P)==

Registries can be associated with pay-for-performance (P4P) quality based contracts for individual doctors, groups of doctors or even all doctors in a country. For example the United Kingdom, rewards physicians according to 146 quality measures related with 10 chronic diseases that are tracked electronically.<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/355/4/375 NEJM - Pay-for-Performance Programs in Family Practices in the United Kingdom<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the United States, Medicare also started a 1.5% P4P contract based on health  measures that can be tracked by disease registries.<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri/ Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Technical Aspects of Data Tracking==

The quality of a disease registry is based on the quality of data fed into it and all the processes involved in updating it and keeping its integrity. In every registry there is always a risk of "[[Garbage In, Garbage Out]]". Issues that can affect a registry and its acceptance by a physician group:

* Is the registry only updated centrally or can a physician update or correct it? For example, a physician doesn't want to get reminders from a registry regarding diabetes patients that died, moved to another state or left her/his practice.

* Most frequently, a list of patients with a certain condition (e.g. diabetes) is generated based on certain criteria. In the U.S., [[Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set]] (HEDIS) criteria are set annually by the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] (NCQA). These criteria, in order to avoid paper charts reviews are in most cases based on insurance claims. For example for diabetes, HEDIS selects an eligible population based on '''Age''' (18–75 years), '''continuous enrollment''' with a certain health insurer and certain "'''Events/diagnosis'''" from '''Pharmacy data''' (electronic), Insurance '''Claims data''' (electronic) or from '''medical records'''. Pharmacy data is based on a list of medications prescribed for diabetes <ref>http://www.ncqa.org/portals/0/hedisqm/HEDIS2008/Vol2/NDC/CDC%20Denominator.xls</ref><ref>http://www.ncqa.org/portals/0/hedisqm/HEDIS2008/Vol2/NDC/Table%20CDC-A.doc</ref> Claims data is based on having '''two''' outpatient visits with a doctor or '''one''' inpatient hospital admission or '''one''' Emergency Room visit with the diagnosis of diabetes. Patients are excluded if they have [[polycystic ovaries]] or just [[gestational diabetes]]. Despite the strict criteria it is possible for physicians to have patients on their registries that are not truly diabetic.<ref>[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895435698001619 Elsevier Article Locator<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
