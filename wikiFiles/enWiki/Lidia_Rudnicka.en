==Biography==

===Academic career===

Lidia Rudnicka graduated from Warsaw Medical School (having previously studied in Bonn and Cologne) in 1986. She went on to receive PhD in medical sciences in 1990 and habilitation degree in 1994.  In 2001 Lidia Rudnicka became Full Professor in medical sciences. From 1987 to 1998 she worked as an Assistant Lecturer and Assistant Professor in Department of Dermatology, Warsaw Medical School. Since 2008 Lidia Rudnicka has been professor at the Faculty of Health Sciences in [[Medical University of Warsaw]].<ref name=LRpage />

===Professional career===

Lidia Rudnicka started her professional career in 1986 in Department of Immunopathology of National Institute of Hygiene. In 1987 she became Assistant Lecturer in Department of Dermatology, Warsaw Medical University. The clinic was headed at that time by most prominent Polish dermatologist of the 20th century, professor Stefania Jablonska. The fruitful scientific cooperation with Stefania Jablonska lasted 11 years, until 1998, when Lidia Rudnicka accepted chairmanship of Department of Dermatology, CSK MSWiA. From 1990 to 1993 she worked in American and European institutions: Food an Drug Administration (National Institute of Health; 1990), University of Liège (research laboratory of Department of Dermatology; 1991) and Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia (Department of Dermatology; 1991–1993). Since 2007 professor Rudnicka has been a member of National Examinary Commission for dermatology and venerology exams. Lidia Rudnicka, beside her activity in Dermatology Department of CSK MSWiA, participates in works of Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Polish Academy of Sciences.<ref name=LRpage /><ref name=AAD />

===Scleroderma research===

Lidia Rudnicka's early work was related to the role of  [[Natural Killer Cells]] and [[adhesion molecules]] in [[systemic sclerosis]] ([[scleroderma]]) and showed that activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of scleroderma patients exhibit increased adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, which is an early event, preceding formation of perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and development of skin fibrosis.<ref>Rudnicka, L; Majewski, S; Blaszczyk, M; Skiendzielewska, A; Makiela, B; Skopinska, M; Jablonska, S (1992). "Adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to vascular endothelium in patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)". Arthritis and rheumatism 35 (7): 771–5. {{doi|10.1002/art.1780350710}}. PMID 1622415</ref>

She is the author of the hypothesis linking etiology of systemic sclerosis to a mutation in the [[topoisomerase I]] gene and abnormal topoisomerase I expression. Furthermore, professor Rudnicka believes that presence of anti-topoisomerse I antibodies in sera of patients with scleroderma represents a protective reaction to these abnormalities. 

This hypothesis was partly confirmed by Lidia Rudnicka's and her students' studies.<ref name=LR96>Rudnicka, L; Czuwara, J; Barusińska, A; Nowicka, U; Makieła, B; Jabłonska, S (1996). "Implications for the use of topoisomerase I inhibitors in treatment of patients with systemic sclerosis". Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 803: 318–20. {{doi|10.1111/j.1749-6632.1996.tb26405.x}}. PMID 8993528.</ref><ref name=JCL01>Czuwara-Ladykowska, J; Makiela, B; Smith, EA; Trojanowska, M; Rudnicka, L (2001). "The inhibitory effects of camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, on collagen synthesis in fibroblasts from patients with systemic sclerosis". Arthritis research 3 (5): 311–8. {{doi|10.1186/ar321}}. PMID 11549373.</ref><ref name=naukapage>{{cite web|url=http://nauka-polska.pl/dhtml/raporty/praceBadawcze?rtype=opis&lang=pl&objectId=8942 |title=Nauka Polska |publisher=Nauka-polska.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref><ref name=JC98>Czuwara, J; Nowicka, U ; Uhrynowska, I ; Gaciong, Z; Olszewska, M; Blaszczyk, M; Rudnicka, L (1998). The effect of topoisomerase I inhibitor – campthotecin- on expression of p53 in scleroderma fibroblasts.

(1995) "The effect of camptothecin, an apoptosis-inducing factor, on proliferation and activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with systemic sclerosis". Journal of investigative dermatology Volume: 104, Issue: 4, April, 1995, pp. 652</ref><ref>Nowicka, U; Kurzawski, G; Lubiński, J; Uitto, J; Blaszczyk, M; Rudnicka, L (1998) "cDNA sequence analysis of the active site of topoisomerase I in patients with scleroderma. Expression and activity of the enzyme". Journal of dermatological science Volume: 16, Supplement 1, March, 1998, pp. S26</ref> The study on which Urszula Nowicka's doctoral thesis was based showed a mutation in the 3’ coding region of the topoisomerase gene in 56% of patients with anti-topo I – positive (Scl70-positive) systemic sclerosis.<ref name=naukapage /> It was also indicated that specific antibodies penetrate into the nuclei of fibrobasts and inhibit the activity of topoisomerase I. Moreover, the studies evidenced that topoisomerase I inhibitor, campothecin, down-regulates the expression of type I collagen in [[fibroblasts]] of scleroderma patients and yields immunosuppressive effects.<ref name=LR96 /><ref name=JCL01 /><ref name=JC98 /><ref name=BM95 /> Certain cytokines were shown to increase the activity of topoisomerase I in dermal.<ref>Rudnicka, L; Makiela, B; Majewski, S, Czuwara, J; Nowicka, U; Barusińska, A (1996). "Regulation of topoisomerase I expression and activity in dermal fibroblasts". Journal of investigative dermatology Volume: 106, Issue: 4, April, 1996, pp. 930</ref>

The hypothesis by professor Rudnicka was discussed during medical conferences, but was never confirmed by other researchers. However, the findings related to the role of campothecin and its potential therapeutical use were reaffirmed in the study by Zhang et al. conducted in patients with keloid.<ref>Zhang, Guo-You; Gao, Wei-Yang; Li, Xuan; Yi, Cheng-Gang ; Zheng, Yan; Li, Yang; Xiao, Bo; Ma, Xian-Jie; Yan, Li; Lu, Kai-Hua; Han, Yan; Guo, Shu-Zhong. Effect of Camptothecin on Collagen Synthesis in Fibroblasts From Patients With Keloid. Annals of Plastic Surgery July 2009 - Volume 63 - Issue 1 - pp 94-99</ref>

Another observation by Lidia Rudnicka and her co-workers, which may be potentially beneficial as far as managing systemic sclerosis is concerned, was abnormally high expression of prolactin in peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from patients <ref>Uhrynowska, I; Czuwara, J; Nowicka, U; Gaciong, Z; Olszewska, M; Majewski, S; Jablonska, S; Blaszczyk, M; Rudnicka, L. Peripheral blond mononuclear cells from patients with systemic sclerosis show abnormally high expression of prolactin.</ref>

===Trichology===

A second field of research of professor Lidia Rudnicka is [[trichology]]. She made a significant contribution to development of hair and scalp [[dermoscopy]]. Most known are her and her co-workers’ studies on genetic hair disorders, which showed that it is possible to diagnose genetic hair shaft abnormalities in children without the need of pulling hairs for microscopic evaluation. In 2005, Lidia Rudnicka and Malgorzata Olszewska used videodermatoscopy in assessing disease severity and monitoring impact of dutasteride therapy on hair thickness and hair shaft heterogeneity in androgenic in androgenic alopecia, indicating this method can be used as a research tool to evaluate the effects of therapeutic or cosmetic agents <ref>Olszewska M., Rudnicka L.: Effective treatment of female androgenic alopecia with dutasteride. J Drugs Dermatol 2005, 4, 637-640</ref> The next year, together with Malgorzata Olszewska and their co-workers she introduced the term [[trichoscopy]] for hair, scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes dermoscopy (videodermoscopy).<ref>Rudnicka L, Olszewska, M, Majsterek, M, Czuwara, M, Slowinska M: Presence and future of dermoscopy. Exp Review Dermatol, 2006, 1, 769-772</ref> Their subsequent studies showed this technique can easily replace traditional microscopic evaluation in genetic hair shaft abnormalities such as Netherton syndrome, monilethrix, wooly hair syndrome, pili torti, pili annulati and trichothiodystrophy.<ref>Rakowska, A; Slowinska, M; Czuwara, J; Olszewska, M; Rudnicka, L (2007). "Dermoscopy as a tool for rapid diagnosis of monilethrix". Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD 6 (2): 222–4.

J Drugs Dermatol. 2008, 7, 651-654.</ref> It has also been proved trichoscopy can be useful in diagnosing acquired hair diseases including androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata,  cicatrical alopecia and tinea.<ref name=LR08 /><ref>Slowinska M, Rudnicka L, Schwartz RA, Kowalska-Oledzka E, Rakowska A, Sicinska J, Lukomska M, Olszewska M, Szymanska E.: Comma hairs: a dermatoscopic marker for tinea capitis: a rapid diagnostic method. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008, 59(5 Suppl), 77-79</ref>

Professor Rudnicka and her co-workers were the first to apply in vivo [[confocal laser scanning microscopy]] in hair diagnostics. Their studies showed potential usefulness of this method in evaluation of hair shaft diseases.<ref>Rudnicka, Lidia; Olszewska, Malgorzata; Rakowska, Adriana (2008). "In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy: usefulness for diagnosing hair diseases". Journal of Dermatological Case Reports 2. {{doi|10.3315/jdcr.2008.1017}}</ref>

===Melanoma prevention===

Professor Lidia Rudnicka is the organizer of a Polish nation-wide campaign to promote prevention and early detection of melanoma (with dermoscopy and videodermoscopy). The campaign "Stop-Melanoma", based on highly successful Australian experience, is an ongoing program which started in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.czerniak-stop.pl/ |title=Czerniak - stop.

===Antibiotic therapy of inflammatory skin diseases===

Clinical observations made by professor Rudnicka and her co-workers indicate the rationality of long-term low-dose antibiotic therapy in chronic inflammatory skin diseases: [[SLE]] and [[psoriasis]].<ref>Rudnicka, L; Szymańska, E; Walecka, I; Słowińska, M (2000). "Long-term cefuroxime axetil in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. A report of three cases". Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland) 200 (2): 129–31.
