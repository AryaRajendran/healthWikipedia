'''Hereditary multiple exostoses''' ('''HME''' or '''MHE'''), also known as '''Diaphyseal aclasis''', is a rare medical condition in which multiple bony spurs or lumps (also known as [[exostosis|exostoses]], or [[osteochondroma]]s) develop on the bones of a child.  HME is synonymous with '''Multiple hereditary exostoses''' and '''Multiple osteochondromatosis''', which is the preferred term used by the [[World Health Organization]].

==Pathophysiology==

It is characterized by the growth of cartilage-capped benign [[bone tumour]]s around areas of active bone growth, particularly the [[metaphysis]] of the long bones. Typically five or six exostoses are found in upper and lower limbs.Most common locations are:<ref name=turek>{{cite book|title=Turek's orthopaedics principles and their application|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780781742986|pages=263|edition=6th ed.}}</ref> 
* [[Distal]] [[femur]] (70%)
* [[Proximal]] [[tibia]] (70%)
* [[Humerus]] (50%)
* Proximal [[fibula]] (30%)

HME can lead to the shortening and bowing of bones; affected individuals often have a short stature.  Depending on their location the exostoses can cause the following problems: pain or numbness from nerve compression, vascular compromise, inequality of limb length, irritation of tendon and muscle, [[Madelung's deformity]]<ref name=who>{{cite book|title=WHO Manual of Diagnostic Imaging - Radiography of the Musculoskeletal System|year=2002|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241545550|pages=177, 189}}</ref>  as well as a limited range of motion at the joints upon which they encroach. A person with HME has an increased risk of developing a rare form of bone cancer called [[chondrosarcoma]] as an adult.<ref name=who /> Problems may be had in later life and these could include weak bones and nerve damage. <ref name="pmid14349947">{{cite journal |author=CANNON JF |title=Hereditary multiple exostoses |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=419–25 |year=1954 |pmid=14349947 |doi= |pmc=1716573}}</ref><ref name="pmid3046271">{{cite journal |author=McBride WZ |title=Hereditary multiple exostoses |journal=American Family Physician |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=191–2 |year=1988 |pmid=3046271 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid8027127">{{cite journal |author=Schmale GA, Conrad EU, Raskind WH |title=The natural history of hereditary multiple exostoses |journal=The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

===Genetics===
HME is an [[autosomal dominant]] hereditary disorder. This means that a patient with HME has a 50% chance of transmitting this disorder to his or her children.  Most individuals with HME have a parent who also has the condition, however, approximately 10% -20% of individuals with HME have the condition as a result of a spontaneous mutation and are thus the first person in their family to be affected.

HME has thus far been linked with mutations in three genes.  
* [[EXT1]] which maps to chromosome 8q24.1 <ref name="pmid8317501">{{cite journal |author=Cook A, Raskind W, Blanton SH, Pauli RM, Gregg RG, Francomano CA, Puffenberger E, Conrad EU, Schmale G, Schellenberg G |title=Genetic heterogeneity in families with hereditary multiple exostoses |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=71–9 |year=1993 |pmid=8317501 |doi= |pmc=1682231}}</ref>

* [[EXT3 (gene)|EXT3]] which maps to the short arm of Chromosome 19 (though its exact location has yet to be precisely determined)<ref name="pmid8081357">{{cite journal |author=Le Merrer M, Legeai-Mallet L, Jeannin PM, Horsthemke B, Schinzel A, Plauchu H, Toutain A, Achard F, Munnich A, Maroteaux P |title=A gene for hereditary multiple exostoses maps to chromosome 19p |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=717–22 |year=1994 |pmid=8081357 |doi=10.1093/hmg/3.5.717}}</ref>

Mutations in these genes typically lead to the synthesis of a truncated EXT protein which does not function normally.  It is known that EXT proteins are important enzymes in the synthesis of [[heparan sulfate]]; however the exact mechanism by which altered synthesis of heparan sulfate that could lead to the abnormal bone growth associated with HME is unclear.  It is thought that normal [[chondrocyte]] proliferation and differentiation may be affected, leading to abnormal bone growth.<ref name="pmid12417417">{{cite journal |author=Zak BM, Crawford BE, Esko JD |title=Hereditary multiple exostoses and heparan sulfate polymerization |journal=Biochimica Biophysica et Acta |volume=1573 |issue=3 |pages=346–55 |year=2002 |pmid=12417417 |doi=10.1016/S0304-4165(02)00402-6}}</ref><ref name="pmid15850368">{{cite journal |author=Stieber JR, Dormans JP |title=Manifestations of hereditary multiple exostoses |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=110–20 |year=2005 |pmid=15850368 |doi=}}</ref>Since the HME genes are involved in the synthesis of a glycan ([[heparan sulfate]]), HME may be considered a [[congenital disorder of glycosylation]] according to the new CDG nomenclature suggested in 2009.<ref name="pmid19765534">{{cite journal |author=Jaeken J, Hennet T, Matthijs G, Freeze HH |title=CDG nomenclature: time for a change! |journal=Biochim.

For individuals with HME who are considering starting a family, preimplantation genetic testing and prenatal diagnosis are available to determine if their unborn child has inherited the disease.  HME has a 96% penetrance, which means that if the disease is indeed transmitted to a child, he/she will have a 96% of actually manifesting the disease, and 4% chance of having the disease but never manifesting it.
==Clinical features==
HME can cause pain to people of all ages. To children, this can be especially painful. During exercise, it can cause a significant amount of pain. Exostoses may be visible to naked eye from outside. Multiple deformities, as mentioned above, can be present.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is mostly clinical and radiological. [[Technetium]] skeletal [[Scintigraphy|scintigrams]] are occasionally used to determine number of exostoses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Grainger & Allison's diagnostic radiology : a textbook of medical imaging.|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780443101632|edition=5th ed.}}</ref> 

==Treatment==
Surgical excision is performed when exostoses lead to growth disturbances or lead to disability. Knee [[osteotomy|osteotomies]] are associated with high incidence of [[peroneal nerve]] [[paralysis]].<ref name=turek />

Surgery, physical therapy and pain management are currently the only options available to HME patients, but success varies from patient to patient and many struggle with pain, fatigue and mobility problems throughout their lives.
It is not uncommon for HME patients to undergo numerous surgical procedures throughout their lives to remove painful or deforming exostoses, correct limb length discrepancies or improve range of motion. Usually the treatment can be problematic. The osteochondromas can return in the same places and may be more painful.<ref name="pmid3046271"/><ref>Morrissy R.T. and Weistein S.L. ''Lovell and Winter's pediatric orthopaedics, Volume 1'', 5th ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, 2001; pp.274-275. ISBN 0-7817-2582-8</ref>

==Epidemiology==
HME is estimated to occur in 1 in 10,000,000 people.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 8027127 | volume=76 | issue=7 | title=The natural history of hereditary multiple exostoses | year=1994 | month=July | author=Schmale GA, Conrad EU, Raskind WH | journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am | pages=986–92}}</ref><ref name=turek />

==Possible Connection to Autism==
Some parents of children with MHE have observed [[autism]]-like social problems in their children. To explore those observations more deeply, a 2012 study by the [[Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute]] used a mouse model of MHE to observe cognitive function. The findings indicated that the mutant mice endorsed three autistic characteristics: social impairment, language deficits, and repetitive behavior.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid =22411800  | volume=109 | issue=13 | title=Autism-like socio-communicative deficits and stereotypies in mice lacking heparan sulfate. | year=2012 | month=March | author=Irie F., Badie-Mahdavi H., & Yamaguchi Y. | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. | pages=5052-6}}</ref>

One of the study's authors, Yu Yamaguchi, M.D., Ph.D., expressed his appreciation for parents' involvement in the study. “I can’t emphasize enough how much it helped that the parents of kids with MHE got involved and supported this research," he said. "As parents, they noticed their kids had social problems that gave them challenges at school. School officials and other people didn’t take these observations seriously – they usually just waved off the problems, assuming that the kids’ bone deformities just make them shy. This latest research doesn’t solve any bone issues for MHE patients, but it does help support what the parents always knew – these children need special care.”<ref>{{cite web |url = http://beaker.sanfordburnham.org/2012/03/rare-bone-disorder-autism/ |title = Rare bone disorder reveals new insights into autism |last = Buschman |first = Heather |date = 12 March 2012 |work = Beaker: Sanford-Burnham Science Blog |accessdate= 16 March 2013 }}</ref>
