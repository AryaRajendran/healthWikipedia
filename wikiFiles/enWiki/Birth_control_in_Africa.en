Providing the current level of contraceptive care in the developing world costs $4 billion yearly and saves $5.6 billion in maternal and newborn health service costs.<ref name="Family Planning Summit">{{cite web|title=Family Planning Summit|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/20120627_family_planning_summit/en/index8.html|publisher=Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health}}</ref> The effects of fulfilling the current unmet need for modern contraceptive methods would create a huge impact.
To fully cover all need for modern contraceptive methods would cost $8.1 billion per year.

The contraceptive use indicator called “unmet need” for contraception still remains high in Africa. This inequity is fueled by both a growing population, and a shortage of family planning services.<ref name="Familyplanning"/>  In Africa, 53% of women of reproductive age have an unmet need for modern contraception.<ref name="Familyplanning" />  This phenomenon occurs because of limited access to contraception, cultural and religious opposition, poor quality of available services, gender based barriers, and spousal disapproval.<ref name="Familyplanning" /> In Eastern Africa specifically, the increase in unmet need is associated with socioeconomic variables, the family planning program environment and reproductive behavior models.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharan|first=Mona|coauthors=Saifuddin Ahmed, John May , Agnes Soucat|title=Family Planning Trends in Sub - Saharan Africa: Progress, Prospects, and Lessons Learned|journal=World Bank|year=2009|pages=445–469|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/258643-1271798012256/YAC_chpt_25.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> In the 1980s and even into the 1990s, contraception and [[family planning]] were still associated with fears of eugenic ideology and population control which narrowed the scope of  behavior-change communication and distribution of contraceptive devices.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Global Family Planning Revolution|year=2007|publisher=World Bank|isbn=978-0-8213-6951-7|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPRH/Resources/GlobalFamilyPlanningRevolution.pdf}}</ref> However in current years a new approach of promoting spousal discussion of contraception has been proposed as an effective policy strategy for narrowing the gender gap in partners' fertility intentions in developing countries.<ref name="guttmacher">{{cite web|last=DeRose|first=Laurie|title=Does Discussion of Family Planning Improve Knowledge of Partner's Attitude Toward Contraceptives?|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3008704.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|coauthors=Nii-Amoo DodooAlex C.

== Methods==

[[Birth control]]

In most African countries,a limited choice of contraceptive methods are offered making it difficult for couples to choose the method that best suits their reproductive needs.<ref name="guttmacher_a">{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=John|coauthors=Karen Hardee, Elizabeth Mumford and Sherrine Eid|title=Contraceptive Method Choice in Developing Countries|journal=Guttmacher Institute|year=2002|month=March|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2803202.html}}</ref>  In fact, international program effort scores for 1994 showed that large proportions of people in most developing countries did not have ready access to a variety of contraceptive methods.Many African countries had low access scores on almost every method.<ref name="guttmacher_a" /> In the 1999 ratings for 88 countries, only 65% of countries offered the pill to at least half their population, 54% offered the IUD, 42% offered female sterilization, 26% offered male sterilization and 73% offered the condom.<ref name="guttmacher_a" /> Condom availability increased more sharply in Africa and Asia than any other developing country.<ref name="guttmacher_a" /> This is important because low levels of condom use are cause for concern, particularly in the context of generalized epidemics  found in Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=John|coauthors=Caldwell Pat,|title=Africa: the new family planning frontier,|journal=Studies in Family Planning|year=2003|month=December|volume=33|issue=1|pages=76–86.|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00076.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4465.2002.00076.x/pdf}}</ref>  The share of method mix for injectables rose from 2% to 8%, and climbed from 8% to 26% in Sub-Saharan Africa, while the share for condoms was 5–7%.<ref name="guttmacher_b">{{cite journal|last=Seiber|first=Eric|coauthors=Jane T.

==Effects==

[[File:Contraceptive Use of African Women Age 15-40.png|thumb|Tracking the change in contraception use of African women from 2008-1012]]

With the implementation of contraceptives and family planning, unintended pregnancies would decline by two-thirds, from 80 million to 26 million.<ref name=" guttmacher">{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=Susheela|coauthors=acqueline E.

It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of infertility. Contraception is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts.<ref name="who_a" /> The prevalence of contraceptive use has risen markedly over the decades. The latest [[United Nations]] review, using surveys that cover 85% of the developing world's population, shows that "almost all of the less developed countries with trend data experienced an increase in the level of contraceptive use".<ref name="who_b">{{cite web|title=Low use of contraception among poor women in Africa: an equity issue|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/4/10-083329/en/|publisher=Wolrd Health Organization|author=Creanga, Andreea A|coauthors=Duff Gillespie a, Sabrina Karklins a & Amy O Tsu|pages=258–266|doi=10.2471/BLT.10.083329|year=2011}}</ref> By region, the [[United Nations]] estimate is highest in northern Africa (42%) and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (14%).<ref name="who_b" /> Increasing modern contraceptive method use requires community-wide, multifaceted interventions with the addition of education, life skills, and access to support.

==Society and Culture==

===Public Policy===
The [[United Nations]] created the "Every Woman Every Child initiative" to asses the progress toward meeting women's contraceptive needs and modern family planning services.<ref name=Gutt2012>{{cite journal|coauthors=Susheela Singh and Jacqueline E. Darroch|title=Adding It Up: Costs and Benefits of Contraceptive Services Estimates for 2012|journal=Guttmacher Institute and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), 201|year=2012|month=June|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/AIU-2012-estimates.pdf}}</ref>  These initiatives have set their goals in terms of expected increases in the number of users of modern methods because this is a direct indicator that typically increases in response to interventions.<ref name=Gutt2012/> In previous years, London began the London Summit on Family Planning in an effort to make modern contraceptive services accessible to an added 120 million women in the world's poorest 69 countries by the year 2020.<ref name=Gutt2012/> A goal of this initiative is to reduce the number of women who have an "unmet need" for modern methods. The Summit wants to eradicate discrimination or coercion against girls who seek contraceptives.

Another initiative is the [[Millennium Development Goals]] which was established in 2000 by 193 United Nations member states and 23 international organizations.<ref name=MDG>{{cite web|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|url=http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|publisher=UN Web Services Section, Department of Public Information}}</ref>  There are eight goals aimed at reducing inequality. Of the 8 goals, the fifth is improving maternal health. The maternal mortality ratio in developing regions is still 15 times higher than in the developed regions.<ref name=MDG/> The maternal health initiative  calls for countries to reduce their maternal mortality rate by three quarters by 2015.<ref name=MDG/> Eritrea is one of the four African countries said to be on track to achieve [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=MDG/> This means  attaining a rate of less than 350 deaths per 100,000 births.

===Cultural Attitudes===
In the traditional Northern [[Ghana]] society, payment of bridewealth in cows and sheep signifies the wife's obligation to bear children.This deeply ingrained expectation about a woman’s duty to reproduce creates apprehension in men that their wife or wives may be unfaithful if they used contraception. The possibility that women may act independently is regarded as a threat to the strong patriarchal tradition. Physical abuse and repraisals from the extended family pose substantial threats to women. Violence against women was considered justified by 51% of female and 43% of male respondents if the wife used a contraceptive method without the husband's knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bawah|first=AA|coauthors=Akweongo P, Simmons R, Phillips JF|title=Women's fears and men's anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in northern Ghana.|journal=Studies of Family Planning|date=30|year=1999|month=Mar|volume=1|issue=30|pages=54–66|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.1999.00054.x|pmid=10216896.}}</ref> Women feared that their husband's disapproval of family planning could lead to withholding of affection or sex or even the dreaded divorce.

[[File:African Waist beads.png|thumb|Waist beads worn by African women to communicate sexual desires and matters.]]

In the cities of Nairobi and Bungoma in [[Kenya]], major barriers to contraceptive use included lack of agreement on contraceptive use and on reproductive intentions.There were also gaps in knowledge on contraceptive methods, fears from rumors, misconceptions about specific methods, perceived undesirable effects and availability and poor quality of services in the areas studied. About 33% of wives in Nairobi and 50% in Bungoma desired no more children however husbands desired about four or more children than wives wanted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rutenberg|first=N|coauthors=Watkins SC|title=The buzz outside the clinics: conversations and contraception in Nyanza Province, Kenya.|journal=Stud Fam Plann|year=1997|month=Oct|volume=28|pages=290–307|doi=10.2307/2137860|pmid=9431650.}}</ref> Lack of couple agreement and communication were primary reasons for nonuse. Comparative to Ghana, the husband or man has the role of a decision maker.The husband has a greater desire for more children preferably sons because it predicts a level of economic security for him once he gets older.

In other Sub-Saharan African cultures, spousal discussion of sexual matters is discouraged. Friends of family and in-laws are used between partners in order for them to exchange ideas and issues pertaining to this matter.<ref name="guttmacher_c">{{cite journal|coauthors=Laurie F. DeRose, F. Nii-Amoo Dodoo, Alex C. Ezeh and Tom O. Owuor|title=87 Volume 30, Number 2, June 2004 Does Discussion of Family Planning Improve Knowledge Of Partner's Attitude Toward Contraceptives?|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives,|year=2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=87–93|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3008704.pdf}}</ref> Couples in these cultures may use other forms of communication, such as specific music, wearing specific waist beads, acting a certain way and preparing of favorite meals, to convey unambiguous sex-related messages to each other.<ref name="guttmacher_c" /> In the case of contraception, a man's use of a contraceptive may itself be a  nonverbal indicator of approval.<ref name="guttmacher_c" /> Therefore, discussion may improve knowledge of family planning attitudes only when it is more efficient than, or augments the effectiveness of, other forms of communication.<ref name="guttmacher_c" />
