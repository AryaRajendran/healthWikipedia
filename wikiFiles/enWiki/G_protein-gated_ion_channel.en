'''G protein-gated ion channels''' refer to a family of transmembrane [[ion channel]]s in [[neuron]]s and atrial [[myocyte]]s that are directly gated by [[G protein]]s.

== Overview of mechanisms and function ==

Generally, G protein-gated ion channels are specific [[ion channels]] located in the plasma membrane of cells that are directly activated by a family of associated [[proteins]]. Ion channels allow for the selective movement of certain ions across the plasma membrane in cells. More specifically, in nerve cells, along with ion transporters, they are responsible for maintaining the [[electrochemical gradient]] across the cell.

[[G proteins]] are a family of intracellular proteins capable of mediating signal transduction pathways.  Each G protein is a heterotrimer of three subunits:  α-, β-, and γ- subunits.  The α-subunit (G<sub>α</sub>) typically binds the G protein to a transmembrane receptor protein known as a [[G protein-coupled receptor]], or [[GPCR]].  This receptor protein has a large, extracellular binding domain which will bind its respective [[ligand]]s (e.g. neurotransmitters and hormones).  Once the ligand is bound to its receptor, a conformational change occurs.  This conformational change in the G protein allows G<sub>α</sub> to bind GTP.  This leads to yet another conformational change in the G protein, resulting in the separation of the βγ-complex (G<sub>βγ</sub>) from G<sub>α</sub>.<ref name="Berg"/>  At this point, both G<sub>α</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> are active and able to continue the signal transduction pathway.  Different classes of G protein-coupled receptors have many known functions including the [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] and [[Phosphatidylinositol]] signal transduction pathways.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gilman A.G. | title = G Proteins: Transducers of Receptor-Generated Signals | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | year=1987 | volume=56 | pages=615–649 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.56.070187.003151 | pmid = 3113327}}</ref>  A class known as metabotropic [[glutamate receptor]]s play a large role in indirect ion channel activation by G proteins.  These pathways are activated by second messengers which initiate signal cascades involving various proteins which are important to the cell's response. 

G protein-gated ion channels are associated with a specific type of G protein-coupled receptor.  These ion channels are transmembrane ion channels with selectivity filters and a G protein binding site.  The GPCRs associated with G protein-gated ion channels are not involved in signal transduction pathways.  They only directly activate these ion channels using effector proteins or the G protein subunits themselves (see picture). Unlike most effectors, not all G protein-gated ion channels have their activity mediated by G<sub>α</sub> of their corresponding G proteins. For instance, the opening of inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels is mediated by the binding of G<sub>βγ</sub>.<ref name="pmid11741896">{{cite journal | author = He C, Yan X, Zhang H, Mirshahi T, Jin T, Huang A, Logothetis DE | title = Identification of critical residues controlling G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) channel activity through interactions with the beta gamma subunits of G proteins | journal = J.

G protein-gated ion channels are primarily found in [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[neurons]] and atrial [[myocytes]], and affect the flow of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), and chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) across the [[plasma membrane]].<ref name="distribution"/>

=== Potassium channels ===
{{main|G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel}}

==== Structure ====

Four G protein gated [[Inward-rectifier potassium ion channel|inwardly-rectifying]] potassium ([[G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel|GIRK]]) channel subunits have been identified in mammals: [[KCNJ3|GIRK1]], [[KCNJ6|GIRK2]], [[KCNJ9|GIRK3]], and [[KCNJ5|GIRK4]]. The GIRK subunits come together to form GIRK ion channels. These ion channels, once activated, allow for the flow of potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) from the extracellular space surrounding the cell across the plasma membrane and into the [[cytoplasm]]. Each channel consists of domains which span the plasma membrane, forming the K<sup>+</sup>-selective pore region through which the K<sup>+</sup> ions will flow.<ref name="ionchannel"/> Both the N-and C-terminal ends of the GIRK channels are located within the cytoplasm. These domains interact directly with the βγ-complex of the G protein, leading to activation of the K<sup>+</sup> channel. The GIRK ion channel family is the only group of G protein-gated ion channels which is known to directly interact with G proteins.<ref name="pmid10790155">{{cite journal | author = Yakubovich D, Pastushenko V, Bitler A, Dessauer CW, Dascal N | title = Slow modal gating of single G protein-activated K+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes | journal = J.

In GIRK4, the N-terminal residue is His-64 and the C-terminal residue is Leu-268; in GIRK1 they are His-57 and Leu-262, respectively. Mutations in these domains lead to the channel's desensitivity to the βγ-complex and therefore reduce the activation of the GIRK channel.<ref name="pmid11741896"/>

The four GIRK subunits are 80-90% similar in their pore-forming and transmembrane domains, a feature accountable by the similarities in their structures and sequences.  GIRK2, GIRK3, and GIRK4 share an overall identity of 62% with each other, while GIRK1 only shares 44% identity with the others.<ref name="ionchannel">{{cite journal | author = Jelacic TM, Sims SM, Clapham DE | title = Functional expression and characterization of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels containing GIRK3 | journal = J.

GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK3 show abundant and overlapping distribution in the central nervous system (CNS) while GIRK1 and GIRK4 are found primarily in the heart.<ref name="distribution"/> GIRK1 combines with GIRK2 in the CNS and GIRK4 in the atrium to form heterotetramers; each final heterotetramer contains two GIRK1 subunits and two GIRK2 or GIRK4 subunits.  GIRK2 subunits can also form [[Homotetrameric|homotetramers]] in the brain, while GIRK4 subunits can form homotetramers in the heart.<ref name="pmid10790155"/> GIRK1 subunits have not been shown to be able to form functional homotetramers.  Though GIRK3 subunits are found in the CNS, their role in forming functional ion channels is still unknown.<ref name="distribution"/>

*GIRKs found in the brain

The G protein inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel found in the CNS is a heterotetramer composed of GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits<ref name="distribution"/> and is responsible for maintaining the resting [[membrane potential]] and excitability of the neuron.<ref name="pmid10998041"/> Studies have shown the largest concentrations of the GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits to be in the dendritic areas of neurons in the CNS.<ref name="distribution"/> These areas, which are both extrasynaptic (exterior to a synapse) and perisynaptic (near a synapse), correlate with the large concentration of [[GABAB receptor|GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors]] in the same areas.  Once the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are activated by their ligands, they allow for the dissociation of the G protein into its individual α-subunit and βγ-complex so it can in turn activate the K<sup>+</sup> channels.  The G proteins couple the inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels to the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, mediating a significant part of the GABA postsynpatic inhibition.<ref name="distribution"/> 

Furthermore, GIRKs have been found to play a role in a group of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal [[raphe nucleus]], specifically those associated with the neuropeptide hormone [[orexin]].<ref name="orexin">{{cite book | author =  | authorlink = | editor = Nishino, Seiji and Sakuri, Takeshi | others = | title = The Orexin/Hypocretin System | edition = | language = | publisher = Humana Press | location = Totowa, NJ | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = | quote = | isbn = 1-58829-444-7 | oclc = | doi = | url = http://www.amazon.com/Orexin-Hypocretin-System-Pathophysiology-Contemporary/dp/1588294447#reader_1588294447 | accessdate = }}</ref>  The [[5-HT1A receptor]], a serotonin receptor and type of GPCR, has been shown to be coupled directly with the α-subunit of a G protein, while the βγ-complex activates GIRK without use of a second messenger. The subsequent activation of the GIRK channel mediates hyperpolarization of orexin neurons, which regulate the release of many other neurotransmitters including [[noradrenaline]] and [[acetylcholine]].<ref name="orexin"/>

=== Calcium channels ===
==== Structure ====

In addition to the subset of potassium channels that are directly gated by G proteins, G proteins can also directly gate certain calcium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Although membrane ion channels and protein [[phosphorylation]] are typically indirectly affected by G protein-coupled receptors via effector proteins (such as phospholipase C and [[adenylyl cyclase]]) and [[second messengers]] (such as [[inositol triphosphate]], [[diacylglycerol]] and [[cyclic AMP]]), G proteins can short circuit the second-messenger pathway and gate the ion channels directly.<ref name="symposium">{{cite journal | author = Brown AM, Yatani A, Imoto Y, Kirsch G, Hamm H, Codina J, Mattera R, Birnbaumer L | title = Direct coupling of G proteins to ionic channels | journal = Cold Spring Harb.

Several studies have shown that when opioids are prescribed to treat chronic pain, GIRK channels are activated by certain GPCRs, namely opioid receptors, which leads to the inhibition of nociceptive transmission, thus functioning in pain relief.<ref name="pmid19756153">{{cite journal | author = Nishizawa D, Nagashima M, Katoh R, Satoh Y, Tagami M, Kasai S, Ogai Y, Han W, Hasegawa J, Shimoyama N, Sora I, Hayashida M, Ikeda K | title = Association between KCNJ6 (GIRK2) Gene Polymorphisms and Postoperative Analgesic Requirements after Major Abdominal Surgery | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = e7060 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19756153 | pmc = 2738941 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007060 | url =  | editor1-last = Zanger | editor1-first = Ulrich }}</ref>  Furthermore, studies have shown that G proteins, specifically the [[Gi alpha subunit]], directly activate GIRKs which were found to participate in propagation of morphine-induced analgesia in inflamed spines of mice.<ref name="pmid19940980">{{cite journal | author = González-Rodríguez S, Hidalgo A, Baamonde A, Menéndez L | title = Involvement of G(i/o) proteins and GIRK channels in the potentiation of morphine-induced spinal analgesia in acutely inflamed mice | journal = Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch.
