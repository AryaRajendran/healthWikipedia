'''Influenza A virus subtype H5N1''', also known as "'''bird flu'''", '''A(H5N1)''' or simply '''H5N1''', is a subtype of the [[influenza A virus]] which can cause illness in humans and many other animal species.<ref name=ICTV46.0.1>{{cite web

It is [[enzootic (epidemiology)|enzootic]] in many bird populations, especially in [[Southeast Asia]]. One strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is [[global spread of H5N1|spreading globally]] after first appearing in Asia. It is [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the [[culling]] of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Most references to "bird flu" and H5N1 in the popular media refer to this strain.<ref name=KSLi>{{cite journal

According to the [[FAO]] Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update, H5N1 [[pathogenicity]] is gradually continuing to rise in endemic areas, but the avian influenza disease situation in [[Poultry farming|farmed birds]] is being held in check by vaccination. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008 in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006 and 55 in June 2007. The "global HPAI situation can be said to have improved markedly in the first half of 2008 [but] cases of HPAI are still underestimated and underreported in many countries because of limitations in country [[disease surveillance]] systems".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/ak783e/ak783e00.pdf |title=October 11, 2010 FAO Avian Influenza Disease Emergency Situation Update 70 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>  On October 10, 2011 the WHO announced a total of 566 ''confirmed'' human cases which resulted in the deaths of 332 people since 2003.<ref name="who.int">{{cite web |publisher=Who.int |url= http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_LatestCumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases for Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO, 2003-2011 |accessdate= }}</ref>

A filtered and purified influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed, and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled so, if an avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu, and commonly bird flu.

Research has shown that a highly contagious strain of H5N1, one that might allow airborne transmission between mammals, can be reached in only a few mutations, raising the spectre of a pandemic epidemy in the human population.

==Overview==
HPAI A(H5N1) is considered an avian disease, although there is some evidence of limited human-to-human transmission of the virus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ungchusak K, Auewarakul P, Dowell SF, ''et al.'' |title=Probable person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=352 |issue=4 |pages=333–40 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15668219 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa044021 |url=}}</ref>  A risk factor for contracting the virus is handling of infected poultry, but transmission of the virus from infected birds to humans is inefficient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ortiz JR, Katz MA, Mahmoud MN, ''et al.'' |title=Lack of evidence of avian-to-human transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among poultry workers, [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], 2006 |journal=J Infect Dis |volume=196 |issue=11 |pages=1685–91 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=18008254 |doi=10.1086/522158 |url=}}</ref> Still, around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the current Asian strain of HPAI A(H5N1) have died from it, and H5N1 may [[mutation|mutate]] or [[reassortment|reassort]] into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission.

In general, humans who catch a humanized influenza A virus (a [[human flu]] virus of type A) usually have symptoms that include [[fever]], [[cough]], [[sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle aches]], [[conjunctivitis]], and, in severe cases, breathing problems and [[pneumonia]] that may be fatal. The severity of the infection depends in large part on the state of the infected persons' [[immune system]]s and whether they had been exposed to the strain before (in which case they would be partially immune). No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized H5N1 flu.

The reported [[Transmission and infection of H5N1#Human mortality rate|mortality rate]] of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human is high; [[World Health Organization|WHO]] data indicate 60% of cases classified as H5N1 resulted in death.

Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1) is divided into two [[antigen]]ic clades. "Clade 1 includes human and bird isolates from [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], and [[Cambodia]] and bird isolates from [[Laos]] and [[Malaysia]]. Clade 2 viruses were first identified in bird isolates from [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]] before spreading westward to the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], and [[Africa]]. The clade 2 viruses have been primarily responsible for human H5N1 infections that have occurred during late 2005 and 2006, according to WHO. Genetic analysis has identified six subclades of clade 2, three of which have a distinct geographic distribution and have been implicated in human infections: [http://content.nejm.org/content/vol355/issue21/images/large/03f1.jpeg Map]

Our analysis showed several new findings. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian clades, all of which share common ancestry with the original 1997 Hong Kong strain. Phylogenetic trees built on each of the 8 segments show a consistent picture of 3 lineages, as illustrated by the HA tree shown in Figure 1. Two of the clades contain exclusively Vietnamese isolates; the smaller of these, with 5 isolates, we label V1; the larger clade, with 9 isolates, is V2. The remaining 22 isolates all fall into a third, clearly distinct clade, labeled EMA, which comprises samples from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Trees for the other 7 segments display a similar topology, with clades V1, V2, and EMA clearly separated in each case.

===Terminology===
H5N1 isolates are identified like this actual HPAI A(H5N1) example, '''A/chicken/Nakorn-Patom/Thailand/CU-K2/04(H5N1)''':
*'''A''' stands for the genus of influenza ([[Influenzavirus A|A]], [[Influenzavirus B|B]] or [[Influenzavirus C|C]]).
*'''chicken''' is the animal species the isolate was found in (note: human isolates lack this component term and are thus identified as human isolates by default) 
*'''Nakorn-Patom/Thailand''' is the place this specific virus was isolated
*'''CU-K2''' is the laboratory reference number that identifies it from other influenza viruses isolated at the same place and year
*'''04''' represents the year of isolation 2004
*'''H5''' stands for the fifth of several known types of the protein [[hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]].
*'''N1''' stands for the first of several known types of the protein [[Viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]].
Other examples include: A/duck/Hong Kong/308/78(H5N3), A/avian/NY/01(H5N2), A/chicken/Mexico/31381-3/94(H5N2), and A/[[shoveler]]/Egypt/03(H5N2).<ref name=Payungporn>{{cite journal

As with other avian flu viruses, H5N1 has strains called "highly pathogenic" (HP) and "low-pathogenic" (LP). Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly [[virulence|virulent]], and mortality rates in infected flocks often approach 100%. LPAI viruses have negligible virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses. The current strain of H5N1 responsible for the deaths of birds across the world is an HPAI strain; all other current strains of H5N1, including a North American strain that causes no disease at all in any species, are LPAI strains. All HPAI strains identified to date have involved H5 and H7 subtypes. The distinction concerns pathogenicity in poultry, not humans. Normally, a highly pathogenic avian virus is not highly pathogenic to either humans or nonpoultry birds. This current deadly strain of H5N1 is unusual in being deadly to so many species, including some, like domestic cats, never previously susceptible to any [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Tara |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/the-cat-who-got-swine-flu/ |title=Parker-Pope, Tara.

===Genetic structure and related subtypes===
[[Image:Neuraminidase Ribbon Diagram.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''N'' in H5N1 stands for "[[Viral neuraminidase|Neuraminidase]]", the protein depicted in this ribbon diagram.]]
H5N1 is a subtype of the species ''Influenza A virus'' of the ''[[Influenzavirus A]]'' [[genus]] of the ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]'' family. Like all other influenza A subtypes, the H5N1 subtype is an [[RNA virus]]. It has a segmented [[genome]] of eight negative sense, single-strands of [[RNA]], abbreviated as PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, MP and NS.

HA codes for [[hemagglutinin]], an [[antigen]]ic [[glycoprotein]] found on the surface of the influenza viruses and is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected. NA codes for [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]], an antigenic glycosylated [[enzyme]] found on the surface of the influenza viruses. It facilitates the release of progeny viruses from infected cells.<ref name=Couch>{{cite book| author =Couch, R.| year = 1996| title = Medical Microbiology| chapter =Chapter 58. Orthomyxoviruses Multiplication| chapterurl = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.3069| editor = Baron, S. (ed.)| pages =| publisher = The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston| location = Galveston, Texas| isbn = 0-9631172-1-1}}</ref>
The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) RNA strands specify the structure of proteins that are most medically relevant as targets for antiviral drugs and [[antibody|antibodies]]. HA and NA are also used as the basis for the naming of the different subtypes of influenza A viruses. This is where the ''H'' and ''N'' come from in ''H5N1''.

Influenza A viruses are significant for their potential for disease and death in humans and other animals. Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, in order of the number of known human pandemic deaths that they have caused, include:

*[[H1N1]], which caused the [[1918 flu pandemic]] ("Spanish flu") and currently is causing seasonal [[human flu]] and the [[2009 flu pandemic]] ("[[swine flu]]")
*[[H2N2]], which caused "Asian flu"
*[[H3N2]], which caused "Hong Kong flu" and currently causes seasonal human flu
*[[H5N1]], ("[[Avian influenza|bird flu]]"), which is noted for having a strain (Asian-lineage HPAI H5N1) that kills over half the humans it infects, infecting and killing species that were never known to suffer from influenza viruses before (e.g. cats), being unable to be stopped by culling all involved poultry - some think due to being endemic in wild birds, and causing billions of dollars to be spent in flu pandemic preparation and preventiveness
*[[H7N7]], which has unusual [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] potential and killed one person
*[[H1N2]], which is currently endemic in humans and pigs and causes seasonal human flu
*[[H9N2]], which has infected three people
*[[H7N2]], which has infected two people
*[[H7N3]], which has infected two people
*[[H10N7]], which has infected two people

===Low pathogenic H5N1===
Low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (LPAI H5N1) also called "North American" H5N1 commonly occurs in wild birds. In most cases, it causes minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in birds. It is not known to affect humans at all. The only concern about it is that it is possible for it to be transmitted to poultry and in poultry mutate into a highly pathogenic strain.

"In the past, there was no requirement for reporting or tracking LPAI H5 or H7 detections in wild birds so states and universities tested wild bird samples independently of USDA. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might not be all inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health ([[OIE]]) recently changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. Effective in 2006, all confirmed LPAI H5 and H7 AI subtypes must be reported to the OIE because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Therefore, USDA now tracks these detections in wild birds, backyard flocks, commercial flocks and live bird markets."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?contentidonly=true&contentid=2006/08/0296.xml| publisher=USDA| title=AVIAN INFLUENZA Low Pathogenic H5N1 vs. Highly Pathogenic H5N1 - Latest UPDATE|date=August 17, 2006}}</ref>

===High mutation rate===
Influenza viruses have a relatively high mutation rate that is characteristic of [[RNA virus]]es. The segmentation of its [[genome]] facilitates [[genetic recombination]] by segment [[reassortment]] in hosts infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time.<ref name=Kou/><ref name=WHOinfluenza/> A previously uncontagious strain may then be able to pass between humans, one of several possible paths to a pandemic.

The ability of various influenza strains to show species-selectivity is largely due to variation in the [[hemagglutinin]] genes. Genetic [[mutation]]s in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single [[amino acid]] substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types.<ref name=Gambaryan>{{cite journal

[[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2]] is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]], which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]]. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|H2N2]] did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]].

Both the [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|H2N2]] and [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]] pandemic strains contained [[avian influenza]] virus RNA segments. "While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the 'Spanish flu' in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source".<ref name=Harder>{{cite book| author =Harder, T.

==Prevention==

===Vaccine===
There are several H5N1 [[vaccine]]s for several of the avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date: while vaccines can sometimes provide cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Dr. Daniel Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at [[Georgetown University]] has made this point, "There is no H5N1 [[pandemic]] so there can be no pandemic [[vaccine]]".<ref name=schultz>{{cite news| author=Schultz, J.| url=http://www.upi.com/ConsumerHealthDaily/view.php?StoryID=20051128-054641-9412r| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060427122447/http://www.upi.com/ConsumerHealthDaily/view.php?StoryID=20051128-054641-9412r| archivedate=2006-04-27| title=Bird flu vaccine won't precede pandemic| publisher=United Press International| date=2005-11-28| accessdate=2006-04-18}}</ref> However, "pre-pandemic vaccines" have been created; are being refined and tested; and do have some promise both in furthering research and preparedness for the next pandemic.<ref name=Enserick>{{cite news| author=Enserick, M.| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/309/5737/996b| title=Avian Influenza:'Pandemic Vaccine' Appears to Protect Only at High Doses| publisher=Science| date=2005-08-12| accessdate=2006-04-18| doi=10.1511/2003.2.122}}</ref><ref name=Walker>{{cite news| author=Walker, K.| url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&article=UPI-1-20060127-15211900-bc-us-fluwrap.xml| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060214044724/http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&article=UPI-1-20060127-15211900-bc-us-fluwrap.xml| archivedate=2006-02-14| title= Two H5N1 human vaccine trials to begin| publisher=Science Daily| date=2006-01-27| accessdate=2006-04-18}}</ref><ref name=gao>{{cite journal| author=Gao W, Soloff AC, Lu X, Montecalvo A, Nguyen DC, Matsuoka Y, Robbins PD, Swayne DE, Donis RO, Katz JM, Barratt-Boyes SM, Gambotto A. | title=Protection of Mice and Poultry from Lethal H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus through Adenovirus-Based Immunization | journal=J.

==Epidemiology==
{{Further|Transmission and infection of H5N1|Global spread of H5N1}}
The earliest infections of humans by H5N1 coincided with an [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in nonhumans) of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong's poultry population. This [[panzootic]] (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area) outbreak was stopped by the killing of the entire domestic poultry population within the territory. However, the disease has continued to spread. On December 21, 2009 the WHO announced a total of 447 cases which resulted in the deaths of 263.<ref name="who.int"/>

===Contagiousness===
[[Image:Global spread of H5N1 map.svg|thumb|Highly pathogenic H5N1<div class="references-mid" style="-moz-column-count:1; column-count:1;">

</div>]]

H5N1 is easily transmissible between birds, facilitating a potential [[global spread of H5N1]]. While H5N1 undergoes mutation and reassortment, creating variations which can infect species not previously known to carry the virus, not all of these variant forms can infect humans. H5N1 as an avian virus preferentially binds to a type of [[galactose]] receptors that populate the avian respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs and are virtually absent in humans, occurring only in and around the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], structures deep in the lungs where oxygen is passed to the blood. Therefore, the virus is not easily expelled by coughing and sneezing, the usual route of transmission.<ref name=Shinya /><ref name=Riel>

H5N1 is mainly spread by domestic [[poultry]], both through the movements of infected birds and poultry products and through the use of infected poultry manure as fertilizer or feed. Humans with H5N1 have typically caught it from chickens, which were in turn infected by other poultry or waterfowl. Migrating [[waterfowl]] (wild [[duck]]s, [[geese]] and [[swan]]s) carry H5N1, often without becoming sick.<ref name=FAO>

===Transmission and host range===
[[Image:Influenza A - late passage.jpg|thumb|[[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]] is the virus that causes avian flu: Transmission electron [[micrograph]] of negatively stained virus particles in late passage. (''Source: Dr. Erskine Palmer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Image Library'')]]

Infected birds transmit H5N1 through their [[saliva]], [[mucus|nasal secretions]], [[feces]] and [[blood]]. Other animals may become infected with the virus through direct contact with these bodily fluids or through contact with surfaces contaminated with them. H5N1 remains infectious after over 30 days at 0°C ( 32.0°F) (over one month at freezing temperature) or 6 days at 37°C ( 98.6°F) (one week at human body temperature); at ordinary temperatures it lasts in the environment for weeks. In Arctic temperatures, it does not degrade at all.

Because migratory birds are among the carriers of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to all parts of the world. H5N1 is different from all previously known highly pathogenic avian flu viruses in its ability to be spread by animals other than poultry.

In October 2004, researchers discovered H5N1 is far more dangerous than was previously believed. [[Waterfowl]] were revealed to be directly spreading this highly pathogenic strain to [[chicken]]s, [[crow]]s, [[pigeon]]s, and other birds, and the virus was increasing its ability to infect mammals, as well. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic.

"Since 1997, studies of influenza A (H5N1) indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal gene constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect felids; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability."<ref name=biegel>{{cite journal|author=Beigel JH, Farrar J, Han AM, Hayden FG, Hyer R, de Jong MD, Lochindarat S, Nguyen TK, Nguyen TH, Tran TH, Nicoll A, Touch S, Yuen KY; Writing Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) Consultation on Human Influenza A/H5.|title=Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans|journal=N.

''The New York Times'', in an article on transmission of H5N1 through smuggled birds, reports Wade Hagemeijer of Wetlands International stating, "We believe it is spread by both bird migration and trade, but that trade, particularly illegal trade, is more important".<ref name=rosenthal2>{{cite news| author=Rosenthal, E.| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/15/world/europe/15bird.html?_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin| title=Bird Flu Virus May Be Spread by Smuggling| publisher=The New York Times| date=2006-04-15| accessdate=2006-04-18}}</ref>

On September 27, 2007 researchers reported the H5N1 bird flu virus can also pass through a pregnant woman's placenta to infect the fetus. They also found evidence of what doctors had long suspected — the virus not only affects the lungs, but also passes throughout the body into the gastrointestinal tract, the brain, liver, and blood cells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandemic.org.au/alertDetail.php?id=000100 Pandemic.org.au|title=H5N1 Transmission Update|date=October 1, 2007|publisher=Provax|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>

A novel, [[Contagious disease|highly contagious]] strain of H5N1 was created by Ron Fouchier of the [[Erasmus Medical Center]] in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who first presented his work to the public at an influenza conference in Malta in September 2011.<ref name="eswi">The Fourth ESWI http://www.eswiconference.org Influenza Conference 11–14 September 2011 Malta</ref> Five mutations were introduced into the H5N1 genome, and the virus was then bred by passing it from the noses of infected [[ferret]]s to the noses of uninfected ones, which was repeated 10 times.<ref>{{cite news |title=What Will the Next Influenza Pandemic Look Like? |first=Katherine |last=Harmon |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=next-influenza-pandemic |newspaper=Scientific American |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref> Fouchier described the result as "probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make".<ref>{{cite web |title=Scientists Brace for Media Storm Around Controversial Flu Studies |first=Martin |last=Enserink |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/11/scientists-brace-for-media-storm.html |work=Science |date=2012-01-23 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}</ref>

After Fouchier offered an article describing this work to the leading academic journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the US [[National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity]] (NSABB) reviewed the manuscript together with one submitted to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the [[University of Wisconsin]] describing related work, and recommended against publication. However, after much delay, the NSABB reversed its position and recommended publication of revised versions of the two papers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Breaking News: NSABB Reverses Position on Flu Papers |author=David Malakoff |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/03/breaking-news-nsabb-reverses-pos.html |work=[[Science (journal)|Science<span style="font-style:normal;">Insider</span>]] |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref> However, then the Dutch government declared the results to be a [[strategic good]] and required Fouchier to apply for an export permit. After much controversy surrounding the publishing of his research, Fouchier complied with Dutch government demands to obtain a special permit<ref>{{cite news |title=Bird Flu Scientist has Applied for Permit to Export Research |author=Nell Greenfieldboyce |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/04/24/151292681/bird-flu-scientist-has-applied-for-permit-to-export-research |newspaper=[[NPR]] |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref> for submitting his manuscript, and his research appeared in a special issue of the journal ''Science'' devoted to H5N1.<ref>{{cite news |title=Journal Publishes Details on Contagious Bird Flu Created in Lab |author=Nell Greenfieldboyce |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/06/21/155504336/journal-publishes-details-on-controversial-bird-flu-experiments |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=June 21, 2012 |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=H5N1 |format=Special Issue |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/h5n1/ |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=June 21, 2012 |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1213362}}</ref> The paper concludes it is entirely possible that a natural chain of mutations could lead to an H5N1 virus acquiring the capability of airborne transmission and setting off human pandemic H5N1 influenza.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scientists create bird flu that spreads easily among mammals |author=Eryn Brown |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-h5n1-bird-flu-20120622,0,4539172.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 21, 2012 |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>

In May 2013, it was reported that Chinese scientists had created a highly contagious strain which passed easily between [[guinea pigs]].<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/05/h5n1-h1n1-reassortment/ Chinese Scientists Create New Mutant Bird-Flu Virus], Wired, May 2, 2013</ref>

==Society and culture==
{{Main|Social impact of H5N1}}
H5N1 has had a significant effect on [[human]] [[society]], especially the [[financial]], [[political]], [[social]], and personal responses to both actual and predicted [[death]]s in [[bird]]s, [[human]]s, and other [[animal]]s. Billions of [[U.S. dollar]]s are being raised and spent to research H5N1 and prepare for a potential [[avian influenza]] [[pandemic]]. Over $10 billion have been spent and over 200 million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1.<ref name=Rosenthal /><ref>[http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html State.gov]</ref><ref>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2006/2006-01-18-02.asp Newswire]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12033509/ MSNBC]{{dead link|date=April 2010}} [http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf US AID]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.bmo.com/news/article/0,1257,contentCode-4922_divId-4_langId-1_navCode-112,00.html |title=BMO Financial Group |publisher=.bmo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/pub8198/laurie_garrett_anthony_s_fauci_michael_osterholm_rita_colwell/the_threat_of_global_pandemics.php |title=Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref><ref>[http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-04-28T080147Z_01_HAN5054_RTRUKOC_0_UK-BIRDFLU-VIETNAM.xml Reuters]{{dead link|date=April 2010}} article ''Vietnam to unveil advanced plan to fight bird flu'' published on April 28, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/a13fd43bc74b6209dc90f6d849ffa45b.htm Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Barber |first=Tony |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a9b1d6b2-9c34-11da-8baa-0000779e2340.html#axzz1ej9u6LD8 |title=Italy imposes controls after bird flu discovery |publisher=FT.com |date=2006-02-13 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>

Dr. [[David Nabarro]], Chief Avian Flu Coordinator for the United Nations, and former Chief of Crisis Response for the World Health Organization has described himself as "quite scared" about H5N1's potential impact on humans. Nabarro has been accused of being alarmist before, and on his first day in his role for the United Nations, he proclaimed the avian flu could kill 150 million people. In an interview with the [[International Herald Tribune]], Nabarro compares avian flu to [[AIDS]] in Africa, warning that underestimations led to inappropriate focus for research and intervention.<ref name=worrier>{{cite news| author = Donald G.
