'''Congenital adrenal hyperplasia''' ('''CAH''') refers to any of several [[autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive]] [[disease]]s resulting from [[mutation]]s of [[gene]]s for [[enzyme]]s mediating the biochemical steps of production of [[cortisol]] from [[cholesterol]] by the [[adrenal gland]]s ([[steroidogenesis]]).<ref name="Warrell2005">{{cite book|author=David A.

Most of these conditions involve excessive or deficient production of [[sex steroid]]s and can alter development of [[primary sex characteristic|primary]] or [[secondary sex characteristic]]s in some affected infants, children, or adults.<ref name="MilunskyMilunsky2010">{{cite book|author1=Aubrey Milunsky|author2=Jeff Milunsky|title=Genetic Disorders and the Fetus: Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oKCmA4dOYtMC&pg=PA600|accessdate=14 June 2010|date=29 January 2010|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9087-9|pages=600–}}</ref>

==Associated conditions==
The symptoms of CAH vary depending upon the form of CAH and the sex of the patient. Symptoms can include:

Due to inadequate mineralocorticoids:

* [[vomiting]] due to [[natriuresis|salt-wasting]] leading to [[dehydration]] and death

Due to excess androgens:

* functional and average sized [[penis]] in cases involving extreme [[virilization]] (but no sperm)
* [[ambiguous genitalia]], in some females, such that it can be initially difficult to determine sex
* early [[pubarche|pubic hair]] and rapid growth in childhood
* [[precocious puberty]] or failure of [[puberty]] to occur ([[sexual infantilism]]: absent or [[delayed puberty]])
* [[hirsutism|excessive facial hair]], [[virilization]], and/or [[menstrual cycle|menstrual irregularity]] in adolescence
* [[infertility]] due to [[anovulation]]
* enlarged [[clitoris]] and shallow [[vagina]]<ref>Richard D. McAnulty, M. Michele Burnette (2006) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=KBi9aG0pQAkC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=%22Digit+ratio%22+clitoris&source=bl&ots=SQjuEc1zm0&sig=VAVPJgd4f4wu6ToO9nPpGthPedY&hl=en&ei=hyZYTaLoKpKgtwfDxrnGDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Digit%20ratio%22%20clitoris&f=false Sex and sexuality, Volume 1]'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], p.165</ref>

==Classification==
Cortisol is an adrenal [[steroid hormone]] that is required for normal endocrine function.  Production begins in the second month of fetal life. Poor cortisol production is a hallmark of most forms of CAH. Inefficient cortisol production results in rising levels of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]], which in turn induces overgrowth (''hyperplasia'') and overactivity of the [[steroid]]-producing cells of the adrenal cortex. The defects causing adrenal hyperplasia are ''congenital'' (i.e. present at birth).

[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|right|500px|[[Steroidogenesis]]. The enzymes affected in CAH are represented by one red and four green bars on the top half of the diagram (for example, "21α-hydroxylase" is visible near the top center. "17α-hydroxylase" and "17,20 lyase" are carried out by a single enzyme.) Depending upon which enzyme is unavailable, there is a reduced production of [[androgen]]s (lower left) or [[mineralocorticoid]]s (upper right). This in turn can lead to increased production of other molecules, due to a buildup of precursors.]]

Cortisol deficiency in CAH is usually partial, and not the most serious problem for an affected person. Synthesis of cortisol shares steps with synthesis of [[mineralocorticoid]]s such as [[aldosterone]], [[androgen]]s such as [[testosterone]], and [[estrogen]]s such as [[estradiol]]. The resulting excessive or deficient production of these three classes of hormones produce the most important problems for people with CAH. Specific enzyme inefficiencies are associated with characteristic patterns of over- or underproduction of mineralocorticoids or [[sex steroid]]s.

Since the 1960s most endocrinologists have referred to the forms of CAH by the traditional names in the left column, which generally correspond to the deficient enzyme activity. As exact structures and genes for the enzymes were identified in the 1980s, most of the enzymes were found to be [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s and were renamed to reflect this. In some cases, more than one enzyme was found to participate in a reaction, and in other cases a single enzyme mediated in more than one reaction. There was also variation in different tissues and mammalian species.

In all its forms, [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]] accounts for about 95% of diagnosed cases of CAH. Unless another specific enzyme is mentioned, "CAH" in nearly all contexts refers to [[21-hydroxylase]] deficiency. (The terms  "salt-wasting CAH", and "simple virilizing CAH" usually refer to subtypes of this condition.) CAH due to deficiencies of enzymes other than 21-hydroxylase present many of the same management challenges as 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but some involve [[mineralocorticoid]] excess or [[sex steroid]] deficiency.

== Genetics and Inheritance==
The gene for 21-hydroxylase is found on 6p21.3 as part of the HLA complex.  21-hydroxylase deficiency results in a unique mutation with two highly homologous near-copies in series consisting of an active gene (CYP21A) and an inactive pseudogene (CYP21P).  Mutant alleles result from recombination between the active and pseudo genes (gene conversion). <ref>De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009.</ref>

=== Incidence ===
The incidence varies geographically.  In the United States, congenital adrenal hyperplasia is particularly common in Native Americans and Yupic Eskimos (incidence 1/280).  Among American Caucasians, the incidence is approximately 1/15,000.  <ref>De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009.</ref>

===Penetrance===
Further variability is introduced by the degree of [[enzyme]] inefficiency produced by the specific [[allele]]s each patient has. Some alleles result in more severe degrees of enzyme inefficiency. In general, severe degrees of inefficiency produce changes in the fetus and problems in prenatal or perinatal life. Milder degrees of inefficiency are usually associated with excessive or deficient [[sex steroid|sex hormone]] effects in childhood or adolescence, while the mildest form of CAH interferes with ovulation and [[fertility]] in adults.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Clinical Evaluation ===
Female infants with classic CAH have ambiguous genitalia due to exposure to high concentrations of androgens in utero.  CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in genotypically normal female infants (46XX).  Less severely affected females may present with early pubarche.  Young women may present with symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (oligomenorrhea, polycystic ovaries, hirsutism).

Males with classic CAH generally have no signs of CAH at birth.  Some may present with hyperpigmentation and possible penile enlargement.  Age of diagnosis of males with CAH varies and depends on the severity of aldosterone deficiency.  Boys with salt-wasting disease present early with symptoms of hyponatremia and hypovolemia.  Boys with non-salt-wasting disease present later with signs of virilization. <ref>De Mais, Daniel.  ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. ASCP Press, Chicago, 2009.</ref>

=== Laboratory Studies ===
In classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, laboratory studies will show very high concentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (greater than 242 nmol/L in random blood sample; with the normal being less than 3 nmol/L at 3 days age in a full-term infant).  Salt-wasting patients tend to have higher 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels than non-salt-wasting patients.

False positive results from neonatal screening for CAD may be seen in premature infants.  Many screening programs have specific reference ranges depending of weight and gestational age.

In borderline cases concerning for CAH, a corticotrophin stimulation test may be performed.  

Genetic analysis can be helpful to confirm a diagnosis of CAH but it is not necessary if classic clinical and laboratory findings are present.  

==Treatment==
Treatment of all forms of CAH may include any of:
# supplying enough [[glucocorticoid]] to reduce hyperplasia and overproduction of [[androgen]]s or [[mineralocorticoid]]s
# providing replacement mineralocorticoid and extra salt if the person is deficient
# providing replacement [[testosterone]] or [[estrogen]] at puberty if the person is deficient
# additional treatments to optimize growth by delaying puberty or delaying [[bone maturation]]

All of these management issues are discussed in more detail in [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]].

[[Dexamethasone]] is used as an [[off-label]] early pre-natal treatment for the symptoms of CAH in female fetuses, but it does not treat the underlying congenital disorder. A 2007 Swedish clinical trial found that treatment may cause cognitive and behavioural defects, but the small number of test subjects means the study cannot be considered definitive. Administration of pre-natal dexamethasone has been the subject of controversy over issues of [[informed consent]] and because treatment must predate a clinical diagnosis of CAH in the female fetus.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Elton | first = Catherine | title = A Prenatal Treatment Raises Questions of Medical Ethics | newspaper = ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' | date = 2010-06-18 | url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1996453,00.html?xid=rss-mostpopular | accessdate = 2010-07-05}}</ref> Especially because in utero Dexamethasone may cause metabolic problems that are not evident until later in life.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The treatment has also raised concerns in the [[LGBT]] community following an essay posted to the forum of the [[Hastings Center]], a [[think tank]] devoted to [[bioethics]], which quoted published research that suggested that pre-natal treatment of female fetuses could prevent those fetuses from becoming [[lesbian]]s after birth, may make them more likely to engage in "traditionally" female-identified behaviour and careers, and more interested in bearing and raising children. Citing a known attempt by a man using his knowledge of the [[Birth order#Sexuality|fraternal birth order effect]] to avoid having a [[homosexual]] son by using a [[Surrogacy|surrogate]], the essayists (Professor Alice Dreger of Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, Professor Ellen Feder of American University and attorney Anne Tamar-Mattis) suggest that pre-natal "dex" treatments constitute the first known attempt to use ''[[in utero]]'' protocols to reduce the incidence of homosexuality and [[bisexuality]] in humans.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Dreger | first = Alice | coauthors = Ellen K.

Since CAH is a recessive gene, both the mother and father must be recessive carriers of CAH for a child to have CAH. Due to advances in modern medicine, those couples with the recessive CAH genes have an option to prevent CAH in their offspring through [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD). In PGD, the egg is fertilized outside the women's body in a petri dish (IVF). On the 3rd day, when the embryo has developed from one cell to about 4 to 6 cells, one of those cells is removed from the embryo without harming the embryo.  The embryo continues to grow until day 5 when it is either frozen or implanted into the mother. Meanwhile, the removed cell is analyzed to determine if the embryo has CAH. If the embryo is determined to have CAH, the parents may make a decision as to whether they wish to have it implanted in the mother or not.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dreger|first=Alice|coauthors=Ellen K.

===Screening for CAH in neonates===
Currently, in the United States and over 40 other countries, every child born is screened for CAH at birth. This test will detect elevated levels of 17-hydroxy-progesterone (17-OHP). Detecting high levels of 17-OHP enables early detection of CAH. Newborns detected early enough can be placed on medication and live a relatively normal life.

==History==

===Before 20th century===
An Italian anatomist, [[Luigi De Crecchio]] provided the earliest known description of a case of probable CAH. <blockquote>I propose in this narrative that it is sometimes extremely difficult and even impossible to determine sex during life. In one of the [[anatomy|anatomical]] theaters of the hospital..., there arrived toward the end of January a cadaver which in life was the body of a certain Joseph Marzo... The general physiognomy was decidedly male in all respects. There were no feminine curves to the body. There was a heavy beard. There was some delicacy of structure with muscles that were not very well developed... The distribution of [[pubic hair]] was typical of the male. Perhaps the lower extremities were somewhat delicate, resembling the female, and were covered with hair... The [[penis]] was curved posteriorly and measured 6 cm, or with stretching, 10 cm. The [[glans penis|corona]] was 3 cm long and 8 cm in circumference. There was an ample [[foreskin|prepuce]]. There was a first grade [[hypospadias]]... There were two folds of skin coming from the top of the penis and encircling it on either side. These were somewhat loose and resembled [[labia majora]].</blockquote> De Crecchio then described the internal organs, which included a normal [[vagina]], [[uterus]], [[fallopian tube|tubes]], and [[ovary|ovaries]]. <blockquote>It was of the greatest importance to determine the habits, tendencies, passions, and general character of this individual... I was determined to get as complete a story as possible, determined to get at the base of the facts and to avoid undue exaggeration which was rampant in the conversation of many of the people present at the time of the dissection.</blockquote> He interviewed many people and satisfied himself that Joseph Marzo "conducted himself within the sexual area exclusively as a male, "even to the point of contracting the "[[syphilis|French disease]]" on two occasions. The cause of death was another in a series of episodes of vomiting and diarrhea.<ref name="Bongio">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM196306062682308 |title=The Adrenogenital Syndrome |year=1963 |last1=Bongiovanni |first1=Alfred M. |last2=Root |first2=Allen W. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=268 |issue=23 |pages=1283}}</ref>

This account was translated by Alfred Bongiovanni from De Crecchio (Sopra un caso di apparenzi virili in una donna. ''Morgagni'' 7:154-188, 1865) in 1963 for an article in the New England Journal of Medicine.

===20th and 21st century===
The association of excessive sex steroid effects with diseases of the adrenal cortex have been recognized for over a century. The term ''adrenogenital syndrome'' was applied to both sex-steroid producing tumors and severe forms of CAH for much of the 20th century, before some of the forms of CAH were understood. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which also dates to the first half of the century, has become the preferred term to reduce ambiguity and to emphasize the underlying pathophysiology of the disorders.

Much of our modern understanding and treatment of CAH comes from research conducted at [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]] in [[Baltimore]] in the middle of the 20th century. [[Lawson Wilkins]], "founder" of [[pediatric endocrinology]], worked out the apparently paradoxical pathophysiology: that hyperplasia and overproduction of adrenal androgens resulted from impaired capacity for making cortisol. He reported use of adrenal cortical extracts to treat children with CAH in 1950. Genital reconstructive surgery was also pioneered at Hopkins. After application of [[karyotype|karyotyping]] to CAH and other [[intersex]] disorders in the 1950s, [[John Money]], JL Hampson, and JG Hampson persuaded both the scientific community and the public that sex assignment should not be based on any single biological criterion, and gender identity was largely learned and has no simple relationship with chromosomes or hormones. See [[Intersex]] for a fuller history, including recent controversies over reconstructive surgery.

[[Hydrocortisone]], [[fludrocortisone]], and [[prednisone]] were available by the late 1950s. By 1980 all of the relevant steroids could be measured in blood by reference laboratories for patient care. By 1990 nearly all specific genes and enzymes had been identified.

However, the last decade has seen a number of new developments, discussed more extensively in [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]]:
# debate over the value of [[genital reconstructive surgery]] and changing standards
# debate over [[sex assignment]] of severely virilized XX infants
# new treatments to improve height outcomes
# [[newborn screening]] programs to detect CAH at birth
# increasing attempts to treat CAH before birth
