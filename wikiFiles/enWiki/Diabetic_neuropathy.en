'''Diabetic neuropathies''' are [[neuropathy|neuropathic]] disorders that are associated with [[diabetes mellitus]]. These conditions are thought to result from diabetic [[microvascular disease|microvascular injury]] involving small [[blood vessel]]s that supply nerves ([[vasa nervorum]]) in addition to macrovascular conditions that can culminate in diabetic neuropathy. Relatively common conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include [[Oculomotor nerve palsy|third nerve palsy]]; [[mononeuropathy]]; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic [[amyotrophy]]; a [[pain]]ful polyneuropathy; [[autonomic neuropathy]]; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy.

==Signs and symptoms==
Diabetic neuropathy affects all peripheral nerves including pain fibers, motor neurons and the autonomic nervous system. It therefore can affect all organs and systems, as all are innervated. There are several distinct syndromes based upon the organ systems and members affected, but these are by no means exclusive. A patient can have sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy or any other combination. [[Symptom]]s vary depending on the nerve(s) affected and may include symptoms other than those listed. Symptoms usually develop gradually over years.

Symptoms may include: 
* Numbness and tingling of extremities
* [[Dysesthesia]] (abnormal sensation to a body part)
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Erectile dysfunction]]
* [[Urinary incontinence]] (loss of bladder control)
* Facial, mouth and eyelid drooping
* Vision changes
* [[Dizziness]]
* Muscle weakness
* [[Dysphagia|Difficulty swallowing]]
* [[Speech communication|Speech]] impairment
* [[Fasciculation]] (muscle contractions)
* [[Anorgasmia]]
* Burning or electric pain

==Pathogenesis==
There are four factors thought to be involved in the development of diabetic neuropathy:

===Microvascular disease===
{{main|Microangiopathy}}
Vascular and neural diseases are closely related and intertwined. [[Blood vessel]]s depend on normal nerve function, and nerves depend on adequate [[blood flow]]. The first pathological change in the microvasculature is [[vasoconstriction]]. As the disease progresses, neuronal dysfunction correlates closely with the development of vascular abnormalities, such as capillary basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia, which contribute to diminished [[oxygen tension]] and [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. [[Neuronal ischemia]] is a well-established characteristic of diabetic neuropathy. [[Vasodilator]] agents (e.g., [[ACE inhibitor]]s, α1-antagonists) can lead to substantial improvements in neuronal [[blood flow]], with corresponding improvements in [[Nerve conduction study|nerve conduction velocities]]. Thus, microvascular dysfunction occurs early in diabetes, parallels the progression of neural dysfunction, and may be sufficient to support the severity of structural, functional, and clinical changes observed in diabetic neuropathy.

===Advanced glycated end products===
{{main|Advanced glycation end product}}
Elevated intracellular levels of [[glucose]] cause a non-enzymatic [[covalent bond]]ing with [[protein]]s, which alters their structure and inhibits their function. Some of these glycosylated proteins have been implicated in the pathology of diabetic neuropathy and other long term complications of diabetes.

===Protein kinase C===
{{main|Protein kinase C}}
PKC is implicated in the pathology of diabetic neuropathy. Increased levels of glucose cause an increase in intracellular [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]], which activates PKC. PKC inhibitors in [[animal model]]s will increase [[nerve conduction velocity]] by increasing neuronal blood flow.

===Polyol pathway===
{{main|Polyol pathway}}
Also called the sorbitol/aldose reductase pathway, the polyol pathway may be implicated in diabetic complications that result in microvascular damage to nervous tissue, and also to the retina and kidney.  

Glucose is a highly reactive compound, and it must be metabolized or it will find tissues in the body with which to react. Increased glucose levels, like those seen in diabetes, activates this alternative [[biochemical pathway]], which in turn causes a decrease in [[glutathione]] and an increase in reactive [[oxygen radical]]s. The pathway is dependent on the enzyme [[aldose reductase]]. Inhibitors of this enzyme have demonstrated efficacy in animal models in preventing the development of neuropathy.

While most body cells require the action of insulin for glucose to gain entry into the cell, the cells of the retina, kidney and nervous tissues are not insulin-dependent. Therefore there is a free interchange of glucose from inside to outside of the cell, regardless of the action of insulin, in the eye, kidney and neurons. The cells will use glucose for energy as normal, and any glucose not used for energy will enter the polyol pathway and be converted into sorbitol. Under normal blood glucose levels, this interchange will cause no problems, as aldose reductase has a low affinity for glucose at normal concentrations.

However, in a hyperglycemic state, the affinity of aldose reductase for glucose rises, meaning much higher levels of sorbitol and much lower levels of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]], a compound used up when this pathway is activated. The sorbitol can not cross cell membranes, and when it accumulates, it produces osmotic stresses on cells by drawing water into the cell. Fructose does essentially the same thing, and it is created even further on in the chemical pathway.

The NADPH, used up when the pathway is activated, acts to promote nitric oxide and glutathione production, and its conversion during the pathway leads to reactive oxygen molecules. Glutathione deficiencies can lead to hemolysis caused by oxidative stress, and we already know that nitric oxide is one of the important vasodilators in blood vessels. [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]], which is also used up, is necessary to keep reactive oxygen species from forming and damaging cells.

Furthermore, the high levels of sorbitol are believed to reduce the cellular uptake of another alcohol, myoinositol, decreasing the activity of the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump required for nerve function, further contributing to the neuropathy.

In summary, excessive activation of the polyol pathway leads to increased levels of sorbitol and reactive oxygen molecules and decreased levels of nitric oxide and glutathione, as well as increased osmotic stresses on the cell membrane. Any one of these elements alone can promote cell damage, but here we have several acting together.

===Effects on nerve types===
Different nerves are affected in different ways

====Sensorimotor polyneuropathy====
Longer nerve fibers are affected to a greater degree than shorter ones, because nerve conduction velocity is slowed in proportion to a nerve's length. In this syndrome, decreased sensation and loss of reflexes occurs first in the toes on each foot, then extends upward. It is usually described as glove-stocking distribution of numbness, sensory loss, [[dysesthesia]] and night time pain. The pain can feel like burning, pricking sensation, achy or dull. Pins and needles sensation is common. Loss of [[proprioception]], the sense of where a limb is in space, is affected early. These patients cannot feel when they are stepping on a foreign body, like a splinter, or when they are developing a callous from an ill-fitting shoe. Consequently, they are at risk of developing [[Skin ulcer|ulcers]] and infections on the feet and legs, which can lead to [[amputation]]. Similarly, these patients can get multiple fractures of the knee, ankle or foot, and develop a [[Charcot joint]]. Loss of motor function results in dorsiflexion, [[contracture]]s of the toes, loss of the interosseous muscle function and leads to contraction of the digits, so called [[hammer toe]]s. These contractures occur not only in the foot but also in the hand where the loss of the musculature makes the hand appear gaunt and skeletal. The loss of muscular function is progressive.

====Autonomic neuropathy====
The [[autonomic nervous system]] is composed of nerves serving the [[heart]], [[lungs]], [[blood vessels]], [[bone]], [[adipose tissue]], [[sweat glands]], [[gastrointestinal system]] and [[genitourinary system]]. [[Autonomic neuropathy]] can affect any of these organ systems. The most commonly recognized autonomic dysfunction in diabetics is orthostatic [[hypotension]], or [[fainting]] when standing up. In the case of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, it is due to the failure of the heart and arteries to appropriately adjust heart rate and vascular tone to keep blood continually and fully flowing to the [[brain]].  This symptom is usually accompanied by a loss of [[respiratory sinus arrhythmia]] - the usual change in heart rate seen with normal breathing. These two findings suggest autonomic neuropathy.

GI tract manifestations include [[gastroparesis]], [[nausea]], [[bloating]], and [[diarrhea]]. Because many diabetics take oral medication for their diabetes, absorption of these medicines is greatly affected by the delayed gastric emptying. This can lead to [[hypoglycemia]] when an oral diabetic agent is taken before a meal and does not get absorbed until hours, or sometimes days later, when there is normal or low blood sugar already. Sluggish movement of the [[small intestine]] can cause [[bacteria]]l overgrowth, made worse by the presence of [[hyperglycemia]]. This leads to [[bloating]], gas and [[diarrhea]].

Urinary symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] and retention. Again, because of the retention of [[urine]], [[urinary tract infections]] are frequent. Urinary retention can lead to bladder [[diverticula]], stones, [[reflux nephropathy]].

====Cranial neuropathy====
When [[cranial nerve]]s are affected, neuropathies of the [[oculomotor nerve]] (cranial nerve #3) are most common. The [[oculomotor nerve]] controls all of the muscles that move the [[human eye|eye]] with the exception of the [[lateral rectus muscle|lateral rectus]] and [[superior oblique muscle]]s. It also serves to constrict the [[pupil]] and open the eyelid. The onset of a diabetic third nerve palsy is usually abrupt, beginning with frontal or periorbital pain and then [[diplopia]]. All of the oculomotor muscles innervated by the third nerve may be affected, but those that control pupil size are usually well-preserved early on. This is because the [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] nerve fibers within CNIII that influence pupillary size are found on the periphery of the nerve (in terms of a cross sectional view), which makes them less susceptible to ischemic damage (as they are closer to the vascular supply). The sixth nerve, the [[abducens nerve]], which innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye (moves the eye laterally), is also commonly affected but fourth nerve, the [[trochlear nerve]],  (innervates the superior oblique muscle, which moves the eye downward) involvement is unusual. Mononeuropathies of the thoracic or lumbar [[spinal nerve]]s can occur and lead to painful syndromes that mimic [[myocardial infarction]], [[cholecystitis]] or [[appendicitis]]. Diabetics have a higher incidence of entrapment neuropathies, such as [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].

==Diagnosis==

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is the most likely diagnosis for someone with diabetes who has pain in a leg or foot, although it may also be caused by vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency or osteoarthritis. A recent review in the Journal of the American Medical Association's "Rational Clinical Examination Series" evaluated the usefulness of the clinical examination in diagnosing diabetic peripheral neuropathy.<ref name=Kanji10>{{cite journal |author=Kanji JN, Anglin RE, Hunt DL, Panju A |title=Does this patient with diabetes have large-fiber peripheral neuropathy? |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=15 |pages=1526–32 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20407062 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.428 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=20407062}}</ref>  While the physician typically assesses the appearance of the feet, presence of ulceration, and ankle reflexes, the most useful physical examination findings for large fiber neuropathy are an abnormally decreased vibration perception to a 128-Hz tuning fork (likelihood ratio (LR) range, 16–35) or pressure sensation with a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (LR range, 11–16). Normal results on vibration testing (LR range, 0.33–0.51) or monofilament (LR range, 0.09–0.54) make large fiber peripheral neuropathy from diabetes less likely. Combinations of signs do not perform better than these 2 individual findings.<ref name=Kanji10/>   Nerve conduction tests may show reduced functioning of the peripheral nerves, but seldom correlate with the severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not appropriate as routine tests for the condition.<ref name="King">{{cite journal |author=King SA|title=Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: Effective Management |journal=Consultant|volume=48 |issue=11 |date=October 1, 2008|url=http://www.consultantlive.com/pain/article/10162/1337377}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Despite advances in the understanding of the metabolic causes of neuropathy, treatments aimed at interrupting these pathological processes have been limited. Thus, with the exception of tight glucose control, treatments are for reducing pain and other symptoms.

Options for pain control include [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs), [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). A [[systematic review]] concluded that "[[tricyclic antidepressants]] and traditional [[anticonvulsants]] are better for short term pain relief than newer generation anticonvulsants."<ref name="pmid17562735">{{cite journal |author=Wong MC, Chung JW, Wong TK |title=Effects of treatments for symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy: systematic review |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7610 |pages=87 |year=2007 |pmid=17562735 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39213.565972.AE |pmc=1914460}}</ref>  A combination of these medication (gabapentin + nortriptyline) may also be superior to a single agent.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilron I, Bailey JM, Tu D, Holden RR, Jackson AC, Houlden RL |title=Nortriptyline and gabapentin, alone and in combination for neuropathic pain: a double-blind, randomised controlled crossover trial |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9697 |pages=1252–61 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19796802 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61081-3 }}</ref>

The only three drugs approved by the FDA for diabetic peripheral neuropathy are the antidepressant [[duloxetine]], the anticonvulsant [[pregabalin]], and the long-acting opioid tapentadol ER.<ref>[http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2011/04/08/WNL.0b013e3182166ebe.full.pdf+html Neurology April 11, 2011, ] {{doi|10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182166ebe}} Evidence-based guideline: Treatment of

Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and the American Academy of
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation [Free full text]</ref><ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/200533s001lbl.pdf</ref> Before trying a systemic medication, some doctors recommend treating localized diabetic periperal neuropathy with lidocaine patches.<ref name="King"/>

===Tricyclic antidepressants===
TCAs include [[imipramine]], [[amitriptyline]], [[desipramine]] and [[nortriptyline]]. These drugs are effective at decreasing painful symptoms but suffer from multiple side effects that are dosage dependent. One notable side effect is cardiac toxicity, which can lead to fatal [[arrhythmia]]s. At low dosages used for neuropathy, [[toxicity]] is rare, but if symptoms warrant higher doses, complications are more common. Among the TCAs, amitriptyline is most widely used for this condition, but desipramine and nortriptyline have fewer [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]].

===Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors===
The [[SSNRI]] [[duloxetine]] (Cymbalta) is approved for diabetic neuropathy, while [[venlafaxine]] is also commonly used. By targeting both serotonin and norepinephrine, these drugs target the painful symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, and also treat depression if it exists. On the other hand, [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s are not useful.

===Selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitor===
[[SSRI]]s include [[fluoxetine]], [[paroxetine]], [[sertraline]] and [[citalopram]] and are not recommended to treat painful neuropathy because they have been found to be no more efficacious than placebo in several controlled trials. Side effects are rarely serious, and do not cause any permanent disabilities. They cause sedation and weight gain, which can worsen a diabetic's glycemic control. They can be used at dosages that also relieve the symptoms of [[clinical depression|depression]], a common comorbidity of diabetic neuropathy.

===Antiepileptic drugs===
[[Antiepileptic|AED]]s, especially [[gabapentin]] and the related [[pregabalin]], are emerging as first line treatment for painful neuropathy. Gabapentin compares favorably with amitriptyline in terms of efficacy, and is clearly safer. Its main side effect is sedation, which does not diminish over time and may in fact worsen. It needs to be taken three times a day, and it sometimes causes weight gain, which can worsen glycemic control in diabetics. [[Carbamazepine]] (Tegretol) is effective but not necessarily safe for diabetic neuropathy. Its first metabolite, [[oxcarbazepine]], is both safe and effective in other neuropathic disorders, but has not been studied in diabetic neuropathy. [[Topiramate]] has not been studied in diabetic neuropathy, but has the beneficial side effect of causing mild [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and [[weight loss]], and is anecdotally beneficial.  Clinical studies have differed regarding its effectiveness;<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15365138 | volume=63 | issue=5 | title=Topiramate vs placebo in painful diabetic neuropathy: analgesic and metabolic effects | year=2004 | month=September | author=Raskin P, Donofrio PD, Rosenthal NR, ''et al.'' | journal=Neurology | pages=865–73}}</ref> improved diabetic control may improve this.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17277866 | volume=134 | issue=12 | title=[Intensified insulin therapy plus antineuritic medication is more effective than antineuritics alone in painful diabetic neuropathy] | year=2006 | month=December | author=Bast&iacute;as A MJ, Toro C L, Olmos C P | journal=Rev Med Chil | pages=1507–15}}</ref>

===Classic analgesics===
The above three categories of drugs fall under the heading of "atypical, adjuvant and potentiators" and are often combined with opioids and/or NSAIDs, usually having effects greater than the sum of their parts.  

[[Duloxetine]] + extended release [[morphine]] ± [[naproxen]] ±  [[hydroxyzine]] (esp. with [[oxycodone]]) ± morphine or [[hydromorphone]] immediate release for breakthrough pain is a common recipe in cases where diabetic neuropathy is a complicating factor in a debilitating chronic pain condition — [[amitryptiline]] may be more effective than Duloxetine in some.  Opioids requiring Cytochrome P-450 activation (e.g. [[codeine]], [[dihydrocodeine]]) should perhaps be used with an agent not chemically related to the SSRIs; conversely, they may impact parts of the Liberation, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism & Elimination profile for morphine, hydromorphone, [[oxymorphone]] &c the other way.

===Physical therapy===
[[Physical therapy]] can be an effective and alternative treatment option for patients with [[diabetes]].<ref name=ISPUB>{{cite journal | title = Physiotherapy in the Management of Diabetes Mellitus: Utilty And Benefits | journal = The Internet Journal of Pain, Symptom Control and Palliative Care | year = 2010 | first = Sanjay | last = Kalra | coauthors = Bharti Kalra, Naresh Sharma, Sunita Sharma | volume = 8| id = | url = http://www.ispub.com/journal/the_internet_journal_of_pain_symptom_control_and_palliative_care/volume_8_number_1_23/article/physiotherapy-in-the-management-of-diabetes-mellitus-utility-and-benefits.html#h1-2 | accessdate = 2011-05-03}}</ref> This may help reduce dependency on pain relieving drug therapies.

[[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] (TENS) and [[interferential current]] (IFC) use a painless electric current and the [[physiological]] effects from low frequency electrical stimulation to relieve [[stiffness]], improve mobility, relieve neuropathic pain, reduce [[oedema]], and heal resistant foot [[ulcers]].<ref name=DiabetesVoice>{{cite journal | title = Prevention and Management of Diabetes: The Role of the Physiotherapist | journal = Diabetes Voice | year = 2007 | first = Sanjay | last = Kalra | coauthors = Bharti Kalra, Naresh Sharma | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 12–14| id = | url = http://www.diabetesvoice.org/files/attachments/article_522_en.pdf | accessdate = 2011-05-03}}</ref>

[[Gait training]], posture training, and teaching these patients the basic principles of off-loading can help prevent and/or stabilize foot complications such as foot ulcers.<ref name=DiabetesVoice />  Off-loading techniques can include the use of [[mobility aid]]s (e.g. crutches) or foot splints.<ref name=DiabetesVoice />  Gait re-training would also be beneficial for individuals who have lost limbs, due to diabetic neuropathy, and now wear a [[prosthesis]].<ref name=DiabetesVoice />

Exercise programs, along with [[manual therapy]], will help to prevent muscle contractures, [[spasms]] and [[atrophy]].  These programs may include general muscle stretching to maintain muscle length and a person’s range of motion.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Effects of Warming Up, Massage, and Stretching on Range of Motion and Muscle Strength in the Lower Extremity | journal = The American Journal or Sports Medicine | date = July 1983 | first = Margareta | last = Wiktorsson-Moller | coauthors = Birgitta Oberg, Jan Ekstrand, Jan Gillquist | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 249–252| id = | url = http://ajs.sagepub.com/content/11/4/249.short | accessdate = 2011-05-03 | doi = 10.1177/036354658301100412}}</ref> General muscle strengthening exercises will help to maintain muscle strength and reduce muscle wasting.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Effects of Resisted Exercise on Muscular Strength, Spasticity and Functionality in Chronic Hemiparetic Subjects: A Systematic Review | journal = The Journal of Applied Research | year = 2009 | first = Cristiane | last = Borges | coauthors = Karine Castao, Patricia Souto, Tatiane Zan, Jose Pompeu, Thiago Fukuda | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 147–158| id = | url = http://www.jrnlappliedresearch.com/articles/Vol9Iss4/Fukuda.pdf | accessdate = 2011-05-03}}</ref> Aerobic exercise such as swimming and using a stationary bicycle can help peripheral neuropathy, but activities that place excessive pressure on the feet (e.g. walking long distances, running) may be contraindicated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.livestrong.com/article/342647-importance-of-physical-activity-in-neuropathy/ | title = Importance of Physical Activity in Neuropathy | accessdate = 2011-05-03 | last = Typpo | first = Omaha | date = 2010-12-26 | publisher = Demand Media Inc}}</ref>

===Other treatments===
[[Alpha-lipoic acid|α-lipoic acid]], an [[anti-oxidant]] that is a non-prescription dietary supplement has shown benefit in a [[randomized controlled trial]] that compared once-daily oral doses of 600&nbsp;mg to 1800&nbsp;mg compared to [[placebo]], although nausea occurred in the higher doses.<ref name="pmid17065669">{{cite journal |author=Ziegler D |title=Oral treatment with alpha-lipoic acid improves symptomatic diabetic polyneuropathy: the SYDNEY 2 trial |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=2365–70 |year=2006 |pmid=17065669 |doi=10.2337/dc06-1216 |author-separator=, |author2=Ametov A |author3=Barinov A |display-authors=3 |last4=Dyck |first4=P.

Though not yet commercially available, [[C-peptide]] has shown promising results in treatment of diabetic complications, including neuropathies. Once thought to be a useless by-product of insulin production, it helps to ameliorate and reverse the major symptoms of diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cotter MA, Ekberg K, Wahren J, Cameron NE |title=Effects of proinsulin C-peptide in experimental diabetic neuropathy: vascular actions and modulation by nitric oxide synthase inhibition |journal=Diabetes |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=1812–7 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12829651 |doi= 10.2337/diabetes.52.7.1812|url=}}</ref>

In more recent years, Photo Energy Therapy devices are becoming more widely used to treat neuropathic symptoms. Photo Energy Therapy devices emit near infrared light (NIR Therapy) typically at a wavelength of 880&nbsp;nm. This wavelength is believed to stimulate the release of [[Nitric Oxide]], an [[Endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] into the bloodstream, thus vasodilating the capilaries and venuoles in the microcirculatory system. This increase in circulation has been shown effective in various clinical studies to decrease pain in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rader A, Barry T |title=A proposed mechanism for pain relief following NIR or MIRE therapy |journal=Diabetic Microvascular Complications Today |pages=27–8 |date=Nov/Dec 2006 }}</ref> Photo Energy Therapy devices seem to address the underlying problem of neuropathies, poor [[microcirculation]], which leads to pain and numbness in the extremities,.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2337/diacare.27.1.168 |author=Leonard DR, Farooqi MH, Myers S |title=Restoration of sensation, reduced pain, and improved balance in subjects with diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with monochromatic near-infrared treatment |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=168–72 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14693984 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14693984}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Prendergast JJ, Miranda G, Sanchez M |title=Improvement of sensory impairment in patients with peripheral neuropathy |journal=Endocr Pract |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=24–30 |year=2004 |pmid=15251618 |url=http://aace.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=1530-891X&volume=10&issue=1&spage=24}}</ref>

Conversely, painful symptoms of neuropathy in uncontrolled diabetics tend to subside as the disease and numbness progress.

==Prognosis==
The mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy are poorly understood. At present, treatment alleviates pain and can control some associated symptoms, but the process is generally progressive.

As a complication, there is an increased risk of injury to the feet because of loss of sensation (see [[diabetic foot]]). Small [[infection]]s can progress to [[Skin ulcer|ulceration]] and this may require [[amputation]].

==Epidemiology==
Globally diabetic neuropathy affects approximately 131&nbsp;million people as of 2010 (1.9% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607}}</ref>

Diabetes is the leading known cause of neuropathy in developed countries, and neuropathy is the most common complication and greatest source of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] in diabetes patients. It is estimated that the [[prevalence]] of neuropathy in diabetes patients is approximately 20%. Diabetic neuropathy is implicated in 50–75% of nontraumatic [[amputation]]s.

The main risk factor for diabetic neuropathy is [[hyperglycemia]].  In the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, 1995) study, the annual incidence of neuropathy was 2% per year, but dropped to 0.56% with intensive treatment of Type 1 diabetics. The progression of neuropathy is dependent on the degree of glycemic control in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Duration of diabetes, [[senescence|age]], [[cigarette]] smoking, [[hypertension]], height and [[hyperlipidemia]] are also risk factors for diabetic neuropathy.
