'''Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance''' ('''RISUG'''), formerly referred to as the synthetic [[polymer]] '''[[styrene maleic anhydride]]''' ('''SMA'''), is the development name of a [[male contraceptive]] developed at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur|IIT Kharagpur]] in [[India]] by Dr. [[Sujoy K Guha]]. Phase III clinical trials are underway in India, slowed by insufficient volunteers.<ref name="dailypioneer">{{cite news|last=Jyoti|first=Archana|title=Poor response from male volunteers hits RISUG clinical trial|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/307917/Poor-response-from-male-volunteers-hits-RISUG-clinical-trial.html|accessdate=2011-06-08|newspaper=[[The Pioneer (Indian newspaper){{!}}The Pioneer]]|date=2011-01-03|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zHEacvXH|archivedate=2011-06-08|location=New Delhi}}</ref> It has been patented in India, China, Bangladesh, and the United States.<ref name="dailypioneer" /> In the United States, there are efforts to get FDA approval under the name Vasalgel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gifford|first=Bill|title=The Revolutionary New Birth Control Method for Men|url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/04/ff_vasectomy/all/1|publisher=[[Wired (magazine){{!}}Wired]]|accessdate=2011-06-08|date=2011-04-26}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
RISUG works by an injection into the [[vas deferens]], the vessel through which the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] moves before [[ejaculation]]. RISUG is similar to [[vasectomy]] in that a local anesthetic is administered, an incision is made in the scrotum, and the vas deferens is tugged out with a small pair of forceps. Rather than being cut and cauterized, as it is in a vasectomy, the vas deferens is injected with the polymer gel and pushed back into the scrotum.<ref name="PPAA">{{cite news|title=Expanding Options for Male Contraception|url=http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2011/08/08/expanding-options-for-male-contraception/|accessdate=2012-03-28|newspaper=Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona|date=2011-08-08}}</ref> In a matter of minutes, the [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] coats the walls of the vas with a clear [[gel]] made of 60&nbsp;mg of the [[copolymer]] [[styrene]]/[[maleic anhydride]] (SMA) with 120 [[microlitre|µl]] of the solvent [[dimethyl sulfoxide]].  The copolymer is made by [[irradiation]] of the two [[monomer]]s with a dose of 0.2 to 0.24 [[Rad (unit)|megarad]] for every 40 g of copolymer and a dose rate of 30 to 40 rad/s.<ref>Jha, Pradeep K., Rakhi Jha, B. L. Gupta, and Sujoy K. Guha. "Effect of γ-dose rate and total dose interrelation on the polymeric hydrogel: A novel injectable male contraceptive." Radiation Physics and Chemistry 79, no. 5 (2010): 663-671.</ref> The source of irradiation is [[cobalt-60]] [[gamma radiation]].

The effect the chemical has on sperm is not completely understood.  Originally it was thought that it lowered the [[pH]] of the environment enough to kill the sperm.<ref>http://www.lib.utah.edu/epubs/undergrad/vol6/peterson.html</ref>  More recent research claims that this is not enough to explain the effect.  

One explanation is that the polymer is an [[anhydride]], and [[hydrolization|hydrolizes]] in the presence of water in the spermatic fluid.  Due to the breaking of a cyclic group, the polymer becomes a [[hydride]] and has a positive charge.  This disturbs the negative charge of the sperm membrane on contact.<ref>{{US patent|5488075}}</ref>

Professor SK Guha theorizes that the polymer surface has a negative and positive [[electric charge]] mosaic.  The differential charge from the gel ruptures the sperm's [[cell membrane]] as it passes through the vas, inactivating sperm before they initiate their journey to the [[ovum|egg]].<ref>http://malecontraceptives.org/methods/risug.php</ref>

"Within an hour, the drugs produce an electrical charge that nullifies the electrical charge of the spermatozoa, preventing it from penetrating the ovum," Dr. Guha said.

== Advantages ==

Some of the advantages, according to Dr. Guha, are:

* '''Effectiveness''' - There has been only one unplanned pregnancy among partners of the 250 volunteers who have been injected RISUG{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} — apparently due to an improperly administered injection. Out of the 250 volunteers who have been injected RISUG, 15 received the injection more than 10 years ago.
* '''Convenience''' - There is no interruption before the sexual act.
* '''Cost''' - The shot itself costs less than the syringe used to administer it, and its long term effectiveness would make it theoretically only a four or five time cost, in the entire lifetime of someone who chose to continue to be on it. 
* '''Outpatient Procedure''' - Patients can leave the hospital immediately after an injection and resume their normal sex lives within a week.
* '''Duration of effect''' - According to Dr. Guha, a single 60 [[milligram|mg]] injection can be effective for at least 10 years.
* '''Reduced side effects''' - After testing RISUG on more than 250 volunteers, neither Guha nor other researchers in the field report [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] other than a slight [[scrotal]] swelling in some men immediately following the injection, which goes away after a few weeks,<ref>http://www.newmalecontraception.org/risug.htm</ref> though there are also unconfirmed reports of kidney problems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Also, because sperm can still exit the body unimpeded, patients don’t experience the pressure or granulomas that can result from vasectomy.<ref name="PPAA"/>
* '''Reversibility''' - The contraceptive action appears to be reversible by flushing the vas deferens with another injection of [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] or [[sodium bicarbonate]] solution.  (The sodium bicarbonate solution cannot be used as the solvent in the initial injection since it would neutralize the positive charge effect.)  Although this reversal procedure has been tried only on [[primates]], it has been repeatedly successful.  Unlike in a [[vasectomy]] (see [[Blood-testis barrier]]), the vas deferens is not completely blocked, the body doesn't have to absorb the blocked sperm, and sperm [[antibodies]] are not produced in large numbers, making successful reversal more likely than with a [[vasovasostomy]].

== Potential hazards ==
The thoroughness of [[carcinogenicity]], [[teratogenicity]], and [[toxicity]] testing in clinical trials has been questioned.  In October 2002, [[Indian health ministry|India's Ministry of Health]] aborted the clinical trials due to reports of [[human serum albumin|albumin]] in [[urine]] and scrotal swelling in [[Clinical trial#Phase III|Phase III trial]] participants.<ref>http://infochangeindia.org/population/news/countrys-first-male-contraceptive-aborted.html</ref>  The Indian Council for Medical Research noted that [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] used as a solvent for the injection is known to cause kidney damage.<ref>http://indlaw.com/10D503BFE86F1141C20267C446BF604C</ref>{{dead link|date=April 2013}}  Although the ICMR has reviewed and approved the toxicology data three times, WHO and Indian researchers say that the studies were not done according to recent international standards.  Due to the lack of any evidence for adverse effects, trials were restarted in 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/04/ff_vasectomy/all/1 | work=Wired | first=Bill | last=Gifford | title=The Revolutionary New Birth Control Method for Men | date=2011-04-26}}</ref>
