'''Zuhdi Jasser''', also known as M. Zuhdi Jasser,<ref name="mosque unbecoming"/> and Mohamed Zuhdi Jasser, is a [[medical doctor]] specializing [[internal medicine]] and nuclear [[cardiology]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].<ref name="8 Questions"/> Jasser is a former [[Lieutenant Commander]] in the  [[United States Navy]]<ref name="flying imams"/> where he served as staff internist in the Office of the [[Attending Physician of the United States Congress]].<ref name="anxiety"/> In 2003, with a group of American Muslims Jasser founded the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]] (AIFD) based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].<ref name="8 Questions"/>

He is also a contributor to national and international media, where he has advocated separation of mosque and state and spoken against the ideology of "political Islam" or [[Islamism]].  He has been a frequent guest on [[Fox News Channel]], [[CNN]], [[CBS]], and [[MSNBC]].<ref name="AIFDTV"/> He has also contributed articles to nationally read newspapers like the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'',<ref name="AZ Republic"/> [[The Dallas Morning News]],<ref name="Dallas Morning"/> [[The New York Post]],<ref name="NY Post"/> [[The Wall St. Journal]]<ref name="Wall St."/> and [[The Washington Times]].<ref name="Wash Times"/>

He testified before the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security]] hearings on The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and the Community's
Response” on March 10, 2011.<ref name="Testimony"/> and before the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution]] on June 24, 2011 on HR 963 the "See Something, Say Something Act".<ref name="Judiciary"/> On June 20, 2012 Jasser appeared again before the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security]] to discuss the Muslim Community's response to the committee's hearings on radicalization in the American Muslim community.<ref name="Testimony 2"/> 

In March 2012, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) Appointed Jasser to serve a 2 year term on the [[U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom]].<ref name="USCIRF"/>

==Biography==
Jasser is the son of [[Syrian]]s who immigrated to the United States in the 1960s, due to repression in their homeland.<ref name="meet"/> He was raised in the [[Sunni]] sect of Islam in [[Neenah, Wisconsin]]. His father was a [[cardiologist]], and his mother is a [[pharmacist]].<ref name="meet"/>

He attended the [[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee]], earning his [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in 1988; then attended the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]] on a [[U.S. Navy]] scholarship, receiving his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1992.<ref name="Hudson"/> He served in the Navy for 11 years, receiving the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]] and attaining the rank of [[Lieutenant Commander]] by the time of his honorable discharge in 1999.<ref name="Hudson"/> His tours of duty included staff [[internist]] for the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]],<ref name="anxiety"/> medical department head aboard the [[USS El Paso (LKA-117)|USS El Paso]], and chief resident at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]].<ref name="meet"/><ref name="Hudson"/> He moved to Arizona after his discharge from the Navy, taking over part of his father's medical practice.<ref name="meet"/>

In the wake of the [[attacks of 9/11]], Jasser and a group of American Muslims formed the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]] (AIFD) as "an organization that systematically looked at and engaged political Islam in all of its manifestations as the problem in order to reform our faith and stop terrorism, which was only a symptom."<ref name="8 Questions"/> Jasser has emerged as an expert on the issue of political Islam. James Woolsey former head of the CIA and Seth Liebsohn, author and radio show host describe him as "the kind of man our government should listen to."<ref name="NRO"/> Jasser utilizes his commentating, speaking engagements and media appearances "to press Muslim leaders to aggressively oppose a 'culture of separatism.'"<ref name="anxiety"/>

On March 10, 2011, Jasser appeared as a witness at the first in a series of hearings conducted by the [[U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security]] on "The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and the Community’s Response."<ref name="anxiety"/><ref name="hornets nest"/> Jasser's testimony focused on how the polarization of American views of the Muslim community are an obstacle to reform within the faith stating:

<blockquote>I sit before you a proud, devout, American Muslim whose country is polarized on its perceptions of Muslims and the radicalization that occurs within our communities. One camp refuses to believe any Muslim could be radicalized living in blind multiculturalism, apologetics, and denial, and the other camp believes all devout Muslims and the faith of Islam are radicalized. Between these two polarities is a reasoned, pragmatic approach focused on solutions that recognizes the beauty of one of the world's great religions, while also acknowledging the existence within of a dangerous internal theo-political domestic and global ideology that must be confronted - Islamism. I hope that these hearings are the beginning of a rational national conversation about those solutions.<ref name="Testimony"/></blockquote>

During his testimony, he said that American Muslim organizations had been "circling the wagons" and have too frequently cautioned Muslims against speaking to law enforcement without a lawyer present.<ref name="contrasting views"/> He also said that political Islam was based on the idea that the government should be run under Islamic law, which he said violated the American concept of separation of church and state.<ref name="contrasting views"/>

On June 24, 2011, Jasser appeared before the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution]] to testify in favor of H.R. 963 The "See Something, Say Something" Act.<ref name="Judiciary"/>

Jasser's medical practice is in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and he resides in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], with his wife and three children, who are being raised as Muslims.<ref name="anxiety"/>

==Views on Islam==
Jasser describes himself as a devout Muslim who believes that "America in fact provides the best atmosphere for Muslims to practice our faith."<ref name="must stand up"/> He does not claim to be a formal expert in [[Classical Arabic|Koranic Arabic]], or in [[sharia]] (Islamic jurisprudence),<ref name="which Islam"/> but he "see[s] Islam (consistent with "Ijtihad," the tradition of critical interpretation of Islamic scripture) as applicable in the modern world and subject to logic and reason."<ref name="Rubin"/> After attending Phoenix-area mosques for several years, he became disappointed that politics was being discussed from the mosque pulpits and was especially concerned about sermons that criticized U.S. government policies and portrayed Muslims as victims.<ref name="flying imams"/> Jasser began criticizing American Muslim organizations including: the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR), the [[Islamic Society of North America]], the North American Imams Federation, the Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America, [[Muslim Students' Association]], the [[Muslim Public Affairs Council]], the [[Muslim American Society]], the [[Islamic Circle of North America]], and the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy, because he sees them as Islamist, meaning they support a mixing of Islam and politics.<ref name="flying imams"/> He has been especially critical of CAIR, a Muslim-American civil rights group, which according to Jasser, is focused  on "victimology" and does not adequately condemn the goals of the terrorist groups.<ref name="flying imams"/><ref name="meet"/> A CAIR official has responded, "with these people, nothing we would do would satisfy them"<ref name="meet"/> and going so far as to claim that Zuhdi is "a mere sock puppet for Islam haters."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/296559/if-cair-s-attacking-you-you-must-be-good-mona-charen|last=Charen|first=Mona|title=If CAIR’s Attacking You, You Must Be Good|date=April 20, 2012|accessdate=April 21, 2012|publisher=National Review Online}}</ref>

Jasser has also engaged in [[Interfaith dialog|interfaith activities]], serving on the Board of the Arizona Interfaith Movement;<ref name="Hudson"/> helping to found an Arizona based organization called [[The Children of Abraham]], a Jewish-Muslim dialogue group in 2000,<ref name="Hudson"/> and a chapter of [[Seeds of Peace]] in 2003.<ref name="sow peaceful"/>

Jasser has said that he and his family have helped build a number of small [[mosques]] in different cities using locally-raised funds, and at times encountering, but always overcoming local opposition.<ref name="mosque unbecoming"/><ref name="groundbreaking"/> In 2010, Jasser strongly opposed the building of the [[Park51]] project, a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque two blocks from the [[World Trade Center site]], which is also known as Ground Zero.<ref name="mosque unbecoming"/> He said he was concerned that the funding of the $100 million project might be coming from foreign, Islamist sources,<ref name="mosque unbecoming"/> and also said: "Ground Zero is purely about being American. It can never be about being Muslim."<ref name="mosque unbecoming"/> After President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] defended the constitutional right of Muslims in America to build a mosque and community center on private property, but not the wisdom of its location, Jasser criticized Obama for "engaging in [[Passive–aggressive behavior|passive aggressive meddling]]"<ref name="Obama is wrong"/> and for telling "the more than 70 percent of Americans who oppose the mosque that they were either wrong or confused."<ref name="mirror"/>

Jasser believes acts of [[Islamic terrorism]] are rooted in the ideology of [[political Islam]] or [[Islamism]].<ref name="must stand up"/> He has said that Islamists believe that the "Islamic state and its shar’iah law is superior to our Constitutional republic."<ref name="my fellow"/> He believes the U.S. needs a "coordinated existential strategy" to combat the ideology, and that this has been dangerously lacking, with the result that the number of home-grown terrorists is increasing.<ref name="my fellow"/> He has expressed the opinion that the [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253|2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing]], the [[Fort Hood shooting]] and the [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]] have not prodded the United States into the appropriate action, but rather, have resulted in [[Political correctness|politically correct]] denial by U.S. government authorities, and inaction by most American Muslims.<ref name="my fellow"/><ref name="bomb plot"/> He believes that even the Bush administration took inadequate measures against Islamism in America.<ref name="meet"/> He says the U.S. needs to provide alternatives for Muslim youth and promote reformist groups.<ref name="radical chicago"/> In his television appearances, Jasser has claimed that three to five percent of U.S. Muslims are militant and 30 to 40 percent do not believe in separation of mosque and state.<ref name="meet"/>

==Views on Israel==
Jasser is an outspoken supporter of Israel,<ref name="Jerusalem Post"/> and believes that Muslim organizations and leaders need to be held to a litmus test to see whether they recognize Israel as a state, specifically condemn groups such as [[Hamas]] and [[Al Qaeda]], and governments such as the Saudi and Syrian dictatorships. "If they don't ... then you have to wonder where their allegiances are," said Jasser.<ref name="personal perspective"/>

==American Islamic Forum for Democracy==
{{Further|American Islamic Forum for Democracy}}
Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the non-profit American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values.<ref name="mission"/> Jasser is the group's president and chief spokesperson.<ref name="meet"/> The AIFD supports separation of religion and state, religious pluralism, equality of the sexes, the unconditional recognition of Israel and the creation of an independent [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], "on the current 'occupied territories'."<ref name="mission"/> The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it.<ref name="mission"/>

==Documentaries==
Jasser is a contributor in four documentaries. Jasser was featured in the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] film ''Islam v Islamists: Voices from the Muslim Center'' which PBS banned from the air after pressure from Muslim organizations.<ref name="Silencing Muslims"/>

He was the main narrator in the [[Clarion Fund]] film, ''[[The Third Jihad]]'', which opens with Jasser stating "This is not a film about Islam. It is about the threat of radical Islam. Only a small percentage of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims are radical. This film is about them." Third Jihad's promotional materials state "that radical Islamists driven by a religiously motivated rejection of western values cultures and religion are engaging in a multifaceted strategy to overcome the western world." The film has stirred controversy with the ''New Republic'' stating the producer of the film has ties to the [[Settlement movement (Israel)|Israeli settlement movement]].<ref name="meet"/> Although Jasser has said he does not agree with everything in the film, he supports the overall message.<ref name="meet"/>

Jasser also appeared in the 2010 [[Newt Gingrich]] film, ''America At Risk: The War With No Name'', a production of [[Citizens United]].<ref name="star witness"/> The film's promotional materials state "[w]e are long overdue for a serious global strategy in fighting terrorism and the ideology behind it. We must have the courage to tell the truth and to act on that truth." It has been described as "anti-Obama" by the ''Nation''.<ref name="star witness"/>

Jasser is also featured in the Fox News Channel documentary ''Fox Reporting: A Question of Honor'', which examined the killing of [[Noor Al-Maleki]] in [[Peoria, Arizona]] by her father [[Falah Al-Maleki]] and his subsequent trial.

==Reception==
Jasser has frequently been in conflict with a number of Muslim advocacy organizations, such as the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], [[Islamic Society of North America]],  [[Muslim Public Affairs Council]], and [[Islamic Circle of North America]], claiming that they are Islamist, are focused on "victimology" and do not adequately condemn the goals of terrorist groups.<ref name="flying imams"/><ref name="meet"/> These organizations in turn protested his March 2012 appointment to the "[[U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom]]".<ref>http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/12/11166773-us-rights-appointee-zuhdi-jasser-hits-raw-nerve-for-american-muslims?lite</ref> The editorial board of the "[[The Arizona Republic]]" responded to these protests by describing them as "ad hominem attacks that are made up out of whole cloth, falsely accusing him and Muslim members of his American Islamic Forum for Democracy of being non-practicing Muslims, at best, and Islam-haters at worst." <ref name="AZ Republic Editorial">{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/2012/04/23/20120423editorial0424-jasser-unmoved-by-radical-foes.html#ixzz20CBhtDBl |title=Jasser unmoved by radical foes |date=April 24, 2012 |author=Arizona Republic Editorial Board |accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref> The Republic Editorial Board further stated that "[Jasser's] presence there affirms exactly what his strident opponents fear most -- that there indeed is a diversity of voices, of points of view, among Muslims."<ref name="AZ Republic Editorial"/>

Congressman [[Keith Ellison]], the first Muslim to be elected to the US Congress, has been highly critical of Jasser.  In a debate, Ellison told Jasser, "I think you give people license for bigotry.  I think people who want to engage in nothing less than Muslim-hating really love you a lot because you give them freedom to do that. You say, 'yeah, go get after them'."<ref>http://www.investigativeproject.org/1448/jasser-challenges-congressman-on-reforms-value</ref>

According to the Washington Post, "In some ways, Zuhdi Jasser doesn't match the profile of the typical Muslim American. He's an active Republican who has supported the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, is an advocate for Israel and says his faith harbors "an insidious supremacism."<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/26/AR2011022600330.html</ref>

[[Richard Silverstein]] criticized Jasser's role in the movie ''[[The Third Jihad]]'' and described him as a Muslim [[neoconservative]].<ref>http://www.richardsilverstein.com/tikun_olam/2008/10/02/radical-islam-wants-youand-america/</ref> On the other hand, [[Daniel Pipes]] praised Jasser as truly [[moderate]] and as someone whose activities demonstrate the falsehood of "phony moderates."<ref>{{cite web|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|title=Zuhdi Jasser and "Monitoring Islamist Media"|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2006/05/zuhdi-jasser-and-monitoring-islamist-media|publisher=DanielPipes.org}}</ref>
