==Overview==

As the pandemic progresses, laboratory testing and confirmation may decrease. Confirmed figures for the [[2009 flu pandemic in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], in particular, are only meaningful up to 2 July 2009, when routine testing stopped and presumed cases were treated without laboratory confirmation of diagnosis. Following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), many countries stopped issuing the numbers of the infected population, making this list inaccurate.

==Reporting bias==

Epidemiologists caution that the number of cases reported in the early days of an outbreak can be very inaccurate and deceptive.<ref name = bias>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/health/28docs.html?hpw |title=Sound the alarm? A swine flu bind |author=Altman Lawrence K |date=28 April 2009 |work=New York Times |accessdate=30 April 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090502164910/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/health/28docs.html?hpw| archivedate= 2 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> This can be due to several causes, including selection bias, media bias, and incorrect reporting by governments.

One [[selection bias]] in epidemiology pertains to authorities in different jurisdictions looking at different sets of patient populations. For example, in the early days of the pandemic, doctors in Mexico may have been concentrating on patients in hospitals, rather than the larger vulnerable population, which may in part explain the higher mortality recorded in the country.<ref name = bias/> Conversely, it is implausible that few, if any, have died in Mexico in recent months when Brazil and the United States have accumulated hundreds of additional lab-confirmed deaths in the same period. [[Media bias]] in reporting swine flu cases and deaths may skew incidence maps based on these media reports.  Countries with poor health care systems and poor laboratory facilities may take longer to identify suspected cases, analyse those cases, and report them.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Reuters |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/2687d9562c28b487c30aca4e889c5e93.htm |title=GLOBAL: No A (H1N1) cases – reality or poor lab facilities? |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=9 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090511130411/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/2687d9562c28b487c30aca4e889c5e93.htm| archivedate= 11 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Passive data collection methodologies (waiting for the patient to arrive at a health care facility) are considered inferior to active data collection techniques (performing random [[stratified sampling]]) due to various forms of selection bias.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/yes/4297_MODULE_19.pdf |title=Observational studies and bias in epidemiology |publisher=College board |format=PDF |year=2004 |accessdate=30 April 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090423151327/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/yes/4297_MODULE_19.pdf| archivedate= 23 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and because laboratory facilities to perform swift genetic tests on patient samples are not widely available.<ref name = bias/> {{As of|2009|07}} there are no properly controlled epidemiological studies for the 2009 swine flu outbreak.
