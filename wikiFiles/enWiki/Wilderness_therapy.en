'''Wilderness therapy''' is a subset of [[adventure therapy|adventure-based therapy]]. It is the use of wilderness expeditions for the purpose of therapeutic intervention. There are a range of different types of wilderness therapy programs, with a range of models and approaches.  Some grow out of a survival approach and some out of an [[Outward Bound]] approach.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/q37854l281654302/ |title= Therapeutic wilderness programs: Issues of professionalization in an emerging field |publisher= www.springerlink.com |accessdate= 2009-04-12 }}</ref> Their aim is guiding participants toward self-reliance and self-respect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspeneducation.com/Outdoor-edu.html |title=Outdoor Education for Troubled Teens - Wilderness Therapy Programs |publisher=Aspeneducation.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wildernesstherapyprograms.com/what-is-wilderness-therapy/ |title=What Is Wilderness Therapy? |publisher=Wildernesstherapyprograms.com |date=2008-10-18 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref> The pioneers in the field of wilderness therapy were Larry D.

==Overview==

The New York Asylum and the San Francisco Agnew Asylum played an early role in the development of wilderness therapy, drawing upon the philosophies of [[Kurt Hahn]]. Although the therapy is often used for [[behavior modification]] by the families of young people, the aims and methods of wilderness therapy do not center on behavior modification. Many wilderness therapy programs avoid what they view as manipulations, contrived activities, psychological games, and contrived consequences.<ref name=ANASAZI1990>{{Harvnb|ANASAZI Foundation|1990}} {{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref> Most programs employ no force, confrontation, point or level systems, or other overt behavioral modification techniques or models, but stress assertiveness, open communication between staff and students, and are very group-oriented. There is no one standardized model for the therapy, since many models of wilderness therapy are reflective of different programs, although most usually contain the following principles:  a series of tasks that are increasingly difficult in order to challenge the patients; teamwork activities for working together; the presence of a psychiatrist or therapist as a group leader; and the use of a therapeutic process such as a reflection journal or self-evaluation.

Michael G. Conner of the Mentor Research Institute states that "wilderness therapy programs trace their origins to outdoor survival programs that placed children in a challenging environment where determination, communication and team efforts were outcomes".<ref>{{cite web |last=Conner |first=Michael |url=http://www.wildernesstherapy.org/Wilderness/WildernessVsBoot.htm |title=Wilderness Therapy Programs and Boot Camps: Is there a Difference? |publisher=www.wildernesstherapy.org |accessdate=13 November 2010}}</ref> Alternately some programs are derived from a more ecopsychological perspective, according to the Director of the Wilderness Therapy Program at [[Naropa University]], "through contemplative practice and the experiential outdoor classroom, students gain further self-awareness and the ability to respond to whatever arises in the moment."<ref>{{Harvnb|Piranian|2006}}{{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref> The founders of [[ANASAZI Foundation]] concluded that "we learned that whenever we adopted what we have come to call 'contrived' experiences, the overall impact often diminished for the participants."<ref name=ANASAZI1990 />

==Controversy==
Given the proliferation of such programs, there is a concern about how these programs are run.<ref name=GAO>{{Harvnb|GAO|2007}}</ref>

Some programs which advertise as "wilderness therapy" are actually [[boot camp (correctional)|boot camps]] in a wilderness environment.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wildernesstherapy.org/Wilderness/WildernessVsBoot.htm |title= Wilderness Therapy Programs and Boot Camps: Is there a Difference? |publisher= www.wildernesstherapy.org |accessdate= 2009-04-12 |last= Conner |first= Michael}}</ref> There have been incidents of alleged abuse.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hcn.org/issues/61/1913 |title= The rise and fall of Steve Cartisano |publisher= High Country News |accessdate= 2009-04-12 |date= 1998-06-10 |last= Smith |first= Christopher }}</ref>  These can sometimes be distinguished from other wilderness therapy by such programs promising [[behavior modification]] for troubled teens, but it is hard to tell just from the ads.<ref>{{cite web |year= 2008 |url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/ETD/image/etd2529.pdf |title= Characterization and Comparative Analysis of Adolescents Admitted to Therapeutic Wilderness Programs and More Traditional Treatment Settings |accessdate= 2009-04-12 |last= Jeppson |first= Mayer}}</ref> One of the major differences between boot camps and wilderness therapy is the underlying philosophical assumptions (wilderness therapy being driven by the philosophy of [[experiential education]] and theories of psychology and boot camps being informed by a military model).  Additionally, most wilderness therapy programs have highly trained clinical staff either on the expedition or in active and ongoing consultation with the team.  Boot camps may have no clinically trained staff working in the programs.  Some staff members are from a correctional or military background.

As in any type of treatment program, abusive situations have been reported and accidental deaths have taken place in some of these programs, although compared with similar outdoor adventure activities deaths are extremely rare.  Among the most controversial programs have been those run by [[Steve Cartisano]].<ref>{{Harvnb|High Country News|1996}} {{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Samoan Observor|2000}} {{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref> or former Cartisano associates.
There also exist "wilderness therapy" boot camps located outside the U.S. to avoid U.S. regulations, many of them unlicensed fly by night outfits.  Such unlicensed outfits also exist in some U.S. states where the wilderness therapy industry is poorly regulated.<ref>{{Harvnb|The Oregonian|2000}} {{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Outside magazine|1996}} {{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref>
There is also controversy over whether parents should be allowed make their child attend a wilderness therapy program by force, as is often the case. Apart from the thousands spent on the actual program (around $500/day), some parents pay a [[Teen escort company]] thousands to ensure that their child gets to the program by any means necessary.

October 2007 the [[United States Government Accountability Office]] had a hearing. In relationship with the hearing, they have issued a report about the wilderness therapy industry.<ref name=GAO />

==After the Program==
Many teens in wilderness programs report the experience as being positive, beneficial, and enjoyable. They learn independence, patience, assertiveness, self-reliance, and maturity; although it is unclear how long these changes last.<ref>{{Harvnb|FamilyFirstAid|2004}} {{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref> Outcome studies have been completed<ref>{{Harvnb|OBHRC|2001}} {{Full|date=November 2012}}</ref> that show continued improvement in behavior one year after attending wilderness therapy and new outcome studies are currently underway.

After a wilderness therapy program, students may return home or may be recommended for a [[therapeutic boarding school]], Young Adult Program or an intensive [[residential treatment center]].
