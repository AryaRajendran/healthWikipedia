'''Canavan disease''', also called '''Canavan-Van Bogaert-Bertrand disease''', '''aspartoacylase deficiency''' or '''aminoacylase 2 deficiency''',<ref>{{OMIM|271900}}</ref> is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16647192 |year=2006 |month=June |author=Namboodiri, Am; Peethambaran, A; Mathew, R; Sambhu, Pa; Hershfield, J; Moffett, Jr; Madhavarao, Cn |title=Canavan disease and the role of N-acetylaspartate in myelin synthesis |volume=252 |issue=1–2 |pages=216–23 |doi=10.1016/j.mce.2006.03.016 |journal=Molecular and cellular endocrinology}}</ref> degenerative disorder that causes progressive damage to [[nerve cell]]s in the [[Human brain|brain]]. Canavan disease is also one of the most common degenerative cerebreal diseases of infancy. This disease is one of a group of genetic disorders called [[leukodystrophies]].

Leukodystrophies are characterized by degeneration of [[myelin]] in the [[phospholipid]] layer insulating the [[axon]] of a [[neuron]]. The gene associated with the disorder is located on human [[chromosome 17]].

== History ==
Canavan disease was first described in 1931 by [[Myrtelle Canavan]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Canavan MM |title=Schilder's encephalitis periaxialis diffusa. Report of a case in a child aged sixteen and one-half months |journal=Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry |volume=25 |pages=299–308 |year=1931 }}</ref>

===Greenberg v. Miami Children's Hospital Research Institute===
{{main|Greenberg v. Miami Children's Hospital Research Institute}}
The discovery of the gene for Canavan disease, and subsequent events, generated considerable controversy. In 1987 the Greenbergs, a family with two children affected by Canavan disease, donated tissue samples to Dr Reuben Matalon, a researcher looking for the Canavan gene. He successfully identified the gene in 1993, and developed a test for it that would enable antenatal counselling of couples at risk of having a child with Canavan disease.<ref name=pmid10464621>{{cite pmid|10464621}}</ref> For a while the Canavan Foundation offered free genetic testing with the test. However, in 1997, Dr Matalon's employer, the Miami Children's Hospital, patented the gene and started claiming royalties on the genetic test, forcing the Canavan Foundation to withdraw their testing. A subsequent lawsuit brought by the Canavan Foundation against the Miami Children's Hospital was resolved with a sealed out-of-court settlement.<ref name=pmid20393311>{{cite pmid|20393311}}</ref> The case is sometimes cited in arguments about the appropriateness of patenting genes.

==Prevalence==

Although Canavan disease may occur in any ethnic group, it affects people of [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jewish]] ancestry more frequently.  About 1/40 individuals of [[Eastern Europe]]an ([[Ashkenazi]]) [[Jew]]ish ancestry are carriers.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Canavan disease has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]
Canavan disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance of having an affected child. [[Genetic counseling]] and [[genetic testing]] is recommended for families with two parental carriers.

Canavan disease is caused by a defective ''[[ASPA (gene)|ASPA]]'' gene which is responsible for the production of the [[enzyme]] [[aspartoacylase]]. This enzyme breaks down the concentrated brain molecule [[N-Acetylaspartate|''N''-acetyl aspartate]]. Decreased aspartoacylase activity prevents the normal breakdown of N-acetyl aspartate, and the lack of breakdown somehow interferes with growth of the [[myelin]] sheath of the [[nerve fiber]]s in the brain. The myelin sheath is the [[fat]]ty covering that surrounds [[nerve]] cells and acts as an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], which allows for efficient transmission of nerve impulses.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of Canavan disease, which appear in early [[infant|infancy]] and progress rapidly, may include [[mental retardation]], loss of previously acquired [[motor skill]]s, feeding difficulties, abnormal [[muscle]] tone (i.e., floppiness or stiffness), poor head control, and [[megalocephaly]] (abnormally enlarged head). [[Paralysis]], [[blindness]], or [[seizure]]s may also occur.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for Canavan disease, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, but there is an experimental treatment using [[lithium citrate]]. When a person has Canavan Disease, his or her levels of N-acetyl aspartate are chronically elevated. The lithium citrate has proven that, in a rat genetic model of Canavan Disease, the [[lithium citrate]] significantly decreased the levels of [[N-acetyl aspartate]]. When tested on a human, the subject reversed during a two week wash-out period after withdrawal of lithium. The investigation revealed both decreased N-acetyl aspartate levels in regions of the brain tested and magnetic resonance spectroscopic values that are more characteristic of normal development and myelination. This evidence suggests that a larger controlled trial of lithium may be warranted as supportive therapy for children with Canavan disease.<ref name=pmid20034825>{{cite pmid|20034825}}</ref> 

In addition, there are experimental trials of gene therapy. A healthy gene is cloned to take over for the defective one that causes Canavan disease.<ref name=pmid12162821>{{Cite journal

==Prognosis==
Death usually occurs before age 4, but some children with milder forms of the disease survive into their teens and twenties.

==Current research==
Research involving [[triacetin]] supplementation has shown promise in a rat model.<ref name="pmid20464498">{{cite journal |author=Mathew R, Arun P, Madhavarao CN, Moffett JR, Namboodiri MA
|title=Metabolic acetate therapy improves phenotype in the tremor rat model of Canavan disease. |journal=J. J Inherit Metab Dis. |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=195–210 |year=2010 |pmid=20464498 |format=PDF}}</ref> Triacetin, which can be enzymatically cleaved to form [[acetate]], enters the brain more readily than the negatively charged acetate. The defective enzyme in Canavan disease, aspartoacylase, converts N-acetylaspartate into aspartate and acetate. Mutations in the gene for aspartoacylase prevent the breakdown of N-acetylaspartate, and reduce brain acetate availability during brain development. Acetate supplementation using Triacetin is meant to provide the missing acetate so that brain development can continue normally.

A team of researchers headed by [[Paola Leone]] are currently at the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]], in [[Stratford, New Jersey]].  The brain gene therapy is conducted at [[Cooper University Hospital]]. The procedure involves the insertion of six [[catheter]]s into the brain that deliver a solution containing 600 billion to 900 billion engineered [[virus]] particles. The virus, a modified version of [[Adeno-Associated Virus|AAV]], is designed to replace the aspartoacylase enzyme.<ref name="pmid12162821">{{cite journal |pmid=12162821 |doi=10.1089/104303402760128612 |year=2002 |month=July |author=Janson, C; Mcphee, S; Bilaniuk, L; Haselgrove, J; Testaiuti, M; Freese, A; Wang, Dj; Shera, D; Hurh, P; Rupin, J; Saslow, E; Goldfarb, O; Goldberg, M; Larijani, G; Sharrar, W; Liouterman, L; Camp, A; Kolodny, E; Samulski, J; Leone, P |title=Clinical protocol.
