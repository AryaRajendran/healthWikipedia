There is a "main" tissue, [[parenchyma]], and "sporadic" tissues, [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]. The main tissue is the one that is unique for the specific organ. For example, the main tissue in the [[heart]] is the [[myocardium]], while sporadic tissues include the [[nerve tissue|nerves]], [[blood]] and [[connective tissue|connective]] tissues. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole [[organ system]]s. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to [[animal]]s, but can also be identified in [[plant]]s. In [[unicellular|single-cell]] organisms like [[bacteria]], the [[analogy (biology)|functional analogue]]s of organs are called [[organelle]]s.

A hollow organ is a [[Viscus|visceral]] organ that is a hollow tube or pouch, such as the [[stomach]] or [[intestine]], or that includes a cavity, like the [[heart]] or [[urinary bladder]].<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hollow%20organ Dictionary.com > hollow organ] Citing: Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, 2002</ref>

==Etymology==
The English word "organ" derives from the [[Latin]] ''organum'', meaning instrument, itself from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ''organon'', implement, musical instrument, or organ of the body. The Greek word is related to ''ergon'', work.<ref name = "Barnhart">Barnhart's Concise Dictionary of Etymology</ref>

[[Aristotle]] used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more absract "parts" of an interconnected whole (e.g. his philosophical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the "organon").

The English word "organism" is a [[neologism]] coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb ''to organize''. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842.<ref name = "Barnhart"/> Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system.

== Organ systems ==
{{main|Biological system}}
Two or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a [[biological system]] or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the [[nervous system|nervous]] and [[endocrine system]] both operate via a shared organ, the [[hypothalamus]]. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the [[neuroendocrine system]]. The same is true for the [[musculoskeletal system]] because of the relationship between the [[muscular system|muscular]] and [[skeletal system|skeletal]] systems.

==Plants==

The study of plant organs is referred to as [[plant morphology]], rather than anatomy, as in [[animal]] systems. Organs of [[plant]]s can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are [[root]]s, [[plant stem|stems]], and [[leaf|leaves]]. The reproductive organs are variable. In [[flowering plant]]s, they are represented by the [[flower]], [[seed]] and [[fruit]]. In [[Pinophyta|conifers]], the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a [[conifer cone|cone]]. In other divisions ([[phylum]]s) of plants, the reproductive organs are called [[strobili]], in ''[[Lycopodiophyta]]'', or simply gametophores in [[moss]]es.

The vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as [[photosynthesis]], while the reproductive organs are essential in [[plant sexuality|reproduction]]. However, if there is [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[vegetative reproduction]], the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see [[clonal colony]]).

==Animals==
The organ level of organisation in [[animal]]s can be first detected in [[flatworm]]s and the more advanced [[phyla]]. The less-advanced [[taxon]]s (like ''[[Trichoplax|Placozoa]]'', ''[[Sponge|Porifera]]'' and ''[[Radiata]]'') do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.

=== List of mammalian organ systems ===
There are eleven major organ systems found in mammals.

[[Mammal]]s such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in [[human anatomy]].
* [[Cardiovascular system]]: pumping and channeling [[blood]] to and from the [[body]] and [[lung]]s with [[heart]], [[blood]] and [[blood vessel]]s.
* [[Digestive system]]: [[digestion]] and processing food with [[salivary gland]]s, [[esophagus]], [[stomach]], [[liver]], [[gallbladder]], [[pancreas]], [[intestine]]s, [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], [[rectum]] and [[anus]].
* [[Endocrine system]]: communication within the body using [[hormone]]s made by [[endocrine gland]]s such as the [[hypothalamus]], [[pituitary]] gland, [[pineal body]] or pineal gland, [[thyroid]], [[parathyroid]]s and [[adrenal]]s, i.e., adrenal glands.
* [[Excretory system]]: [[kidney]]s, [[ureter]]s, [[urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[urethra]] involved in fluid balance, [[electrolyte]] balance and excretion of [[urine]].
*[[Immune System]]: structures involved in the transfer of [[lymph]] between [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s and the [[blood stream]], the lymph and the [[lymph node|node]]s and [[lymph vessel|vessels]] that transport it including the [[Immune system]]: defending against [[disease]]-causing agents with [[leukocyte]]s, [[tonsil]]s, [[adenoid]]s, [[thymus]] and [[spleen]].
* [[Integumentary system]]: [[skin]], [[hair]] and [[nail (anatomy)|nails]].
* [[Muscular system]]: movement with [[muscle]]s.
* [[Nervous system]]: collecting, transferring and processing information with [[brain]], [[spinal cord]] and [[nerve]]s.
* [[Reproductive system]]: the [[sex organs]], such as [[ovary|ovarie]]s, [[fallopian tube]]s, [[uterus]], [[vagina]], [[mammary gland]]s, [[testes]], [[vas deferens]], [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[prostate]] and [[penis]].
* [[Respiratory system]]: the organs used for [[breathing]], the [[pharynx]], [[larynx]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[bronchi]], [[lung]]s and [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].
* [[Human skeleton|Skeletal system]]: structural support and protection with [[bone]]s, [[cartilage]], [[ligament]]s and [[tendon]]s.

==Vital organs==
Vital organs are organs of such critical importance that an organism cannot survive for long without them.  In humans, there are five:
* The [[brain]]
* The [[heart]]
* The [[kidneys]]
* The [[liver]]
* The [[lungs]]

==See also==
* [[Cloning]]
* [[Fascia]]
* [[Organ transplant]]
* [[Organelle]]s, analogous sub-[[cell (biology)|cellular]] structures
* Organophthiraptera, new suborder of [[Phthiraptera]]
