'''Medical ethics''' is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of [[medicine]].
As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology.

==History==
{{See also|List of medical ethics cases}}
Historically, [[Western world|Western]] medical ethics may be traced to guidelines on the [[duty]] of physicians in antiquity, such as the [[Hippocratic Oath]], and early [[Christian]] teachings. The first code of medical ethics, ''[[Formula Comitis Archiatrorum]]'', was published in the 5th century, during the reign of the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] king [[Theodoric the Great]]. In the medieval and early modern period, the field is indebted to [[Islamic medicine|Muslim medicine]] such as [[Al-Ruhawi|Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi]] (who wrote the ''Conduct of a Physician'', the first book dedicated to medical ethics) and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi]] (known as Rhazes in the West), [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)|Jewish thinkers]] such as [[Maimonides]], [[Roman Catholic]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the case-oriented analysis ([[casuistry]]) of Catholic [[moral theology]]. These intellectual traditions continue in [[Catholic ethics|Catholic]], [[Islamic ethics#Medical ethics|Islamic]] and [[Jewish medical ethics]].

By the 18th and 19th centuries, medical ethics emerged as a more self-conscious discourse. In England, [[Thomas Percival]], a physician and author, crafted the first modern code of [[medical ethics]]. He drew up a pamphlet with the code in 1794 and wrote an expanded version in 1803, in which he coined the expressions "medical ethics" and "medical jurisprudence".<ref>[http://ethics.iit.edu/perspective/pers19_1fall99_2.html ''Codes of Ethics: Some History'', Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at IIT]</ref> However, there are some who see Percival's guidelines that relate to physician consultations as being excessively protective of the home physician's reputation. Jeffrey Berlant is one such critic who considers Percival's codes of physician consultations as being an early example of the anti-competitive, "guild"-like nature of the physician community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berlant|first=Jeffrey|title=Profession and Monopoly: a study of medicine in the United States and Great Britain|publisher=University of California Press|date=1975|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1081816|isbn=0-520-02734-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Percival|first=Thomas|title=Medical ethics|publisher=John Henry Parker|pages=49–57 esp section 8 pg.52|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yVUEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=medical+ethics|year=1849}}</ref> 

In 1815, the [[Apothecaries Act 1815|Apothecaries Act]] was passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It introduced compulsory apprenticeship and formal qualifications for the apothecaries of the day under the license of the Society of Apothecaries. This was the beginning of regulation of the medical profession in the UK.

In 1847, the [[American Medical Association]] adopted its first [[ethical code|code of ethics]], with this being based in large part upon Percival's work [http://www.uab.edu/reynolds/MajMedFigs/Percival.htm]. While the secularized field borrowed largely from Catholic medical ethics, in the 20th century a distinctively [[Mainline (Protestant)|liberal Protestant]] approach was articulated by thinkers such as [[Joseph Fletcher]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, building upon [[liberal theory]] and [[procedural justice]], much of the discourse of medical ethics went through a dramatic shift and largely reconfigured itself into [[bioethics]].<ref>Walter, Klein eds. ''The Story of Bioethics: From seminal works to contemporary explorations''.</ref>

Well-known medical ethics cases include: 
* [[Acres of Skin|Albert Kligman's dermatology experiments]]
* [[Deep sleep therapy]]
* [[Doctors' Trial]]
* [[Henrietta Lacks]]
* [[Human radiation experiments]] 
* [[Jesse Gelsinger]]
* ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]''
* [[Madhouse: A Tragic Tale of Megalomania and Modern Medicine|Surgical removal of body parts to try to improve mental health]]
* [[Medical Apartheid|Medical Experimentation on Black Americans]]
* [[Milgram experiment]]
* [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission|Radioactive iodine experiments]]
* [[The Monster Study]]
* [[The Plutonium Files|Plutonium injections]]
* [[The Stanford Prison Experiment]]
* [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]]
* [[Willowbrook State School]]
* ''[[Greenberg v. Miami Children's Hospital Research Institute]]''

Since the 1970s, the growing influence of ethics in contemporary medicine can be seen in the increasing use of [[Institutional Review Board]]s to evaluate experiments on human subjects, the establishment of hospital [[ethics committee]]s, the expansion of the role of clinician ethicists, and the integration of ethics into many medical school curricula.<ref name="pmid19737406">{{cite journal |author=Lakhan SE, Hamlat E, McNamee T, Laird C |title=Time for a unified approach to medical ethics |journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine |volume=4 |issue=3 |year=2009 |pmid=19737406 |doi=10.1186/1747-5341-4-13 |pages=13 |pmc=2745426}}</ref>

==Values in medical ethics==
A common framework used in the analysis of medical ethics is the "four principles" approach postulated by [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]] in their textbook ''Principles of biomedical ethics''. It recognizes four basic moral principles, which are to be judged and weighed against each other, with attention given to the scope of their application. The four principles are:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gillon|first=R|title=Medical ethics: four principles plus attention to scope|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1994|volume=309|issue=184|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6948.184|accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> 

* Respect for [[Autonomy#Medicine|autonomy]] - the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. (''Voluntas aegroti suprema lex''.)
* [[Beneficence (ethics)|Beneficence]] - a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (''Salus aegroti suprema lex''.)
* Non-maleficence - "first, do no harm" (''[[primum non nocere]]'').
* [[Justice (ethics)|Justice]] - concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).

Other values which are sometimes discussed include:
* [[Respect for persons]] - the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.
* Truthfulness and [[honesty]] - the concept of [[informed consent]] has increased in importance since the historical events of the [[Doctors' Trial]] of the Nuremberg trials and [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].

Values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts.

When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical [[dilemma]] or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members.  Some argue for example, that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse [[blood transfusions]], considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.

===Autonomy===
The principle of autonomy recognizes the rights of individuals to self-determination. This is rooted in society's respect for individuals' ability to make informed decisions about personal matters. Autonomy has become more important as social values have shifted to define medical quality in terms of outcomes that are important to the patient rather than medical professionals. The increasing importance of autonomy can be seen as a social reaction to a "[[paternalism|paternalistic]]" tradition within healthcare.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Some have questioned whether the backlash against historically excessive paternalism in favor of patient autonomy has inhibited the proper use of [[soft paternalism]] to the detriment of outcomes for some patients.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8264472 Autonomy and paternalism in medicine. [Med J Aust. 1993 Dec 6-20&#93; - PubMed Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Respect for autonomy is the basis for informed consent and [[advance directive]]s.

Autonomy is a general indicator of health. Many diseases are characterised by loss of autonomy, in various manners. This makes autonomy an indicator for both personal well-being, and for the well-being of the profession.
This has implications for the consideration of medical ethics: "is the aim of health care to do good, and benefit from it?"; or "is the aim of health care to do good to others, and have them, and society, benefit from this?". (Ethics - by definition - tries to find a beneficial balance between the activities of the individual and its effects on a collective.)

By considering autonomy as a gauge parameter for (self) health care, the medical and ethical perspective both benefit from the implied reference to health.

Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are often asked to evaluate a patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions at the end of life. Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may not have the capacity to make end-of-life decisions. Therefore, for these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken in consideration of their condition and not followed. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons who lack mental capacity are generally treated according to their best interests. On the other hand, persons who have the mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions have the right to refuse treatment and choose an early death if that is what they truly want. In such cases, psychiatrists and psychologists are typically part of protecting that right.<ref>Ryan CJ. [http://www.searchmedica.com/resource.html?rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychiatrictimes.com%2Fcognitive-impairment%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F10168%2F1583693&q=christopher+j+ryan&c=ps&ss=psychTimesLink&p=Convera&fr=true&ds=0&srid=1 Ethical issues, part 2: ethics, psychiatry, and end-of-life issues]. Psychiatr Times. 2010;27(6):26-27.</ref>

===Beneficence===
The term beneficence refers to actions that promote the well being of others. In the medical context, this means taking actions that serve the best interests of patients. However, uncertainty surrounds the precise definition of which practices do in fact help patients.

[[James Childress]] and [[Tom Beauchamp]] in ''Principle of Biomedical Ethics'' (1978) identify beneficence as one of the core values of health care ethics.  Some scholars, such as [[Edmund D. Pellegrino|Edmund Pellegrino]], argue that beneficence is the ''only'' fundamental principle of medical ethics.  They argue that healing should be the sole purpose of medicine, and that endeavors like [[cosmetic surgery]], [[contraception]] and [[euthanasia]] fall beyond its purview.

===Non-Maleficence===
{{Main|Primum non nocere}}
The concept of non-maleficence is embodied by the phrase, "first, do no harm," or the Latin, ''[[primum non nocere]]''. Many consider that should be the main or primary consideration (hence ''primum''): that it is more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good. This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no (or only acceptable levels of) harm. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, "The treatment was a success, but the patient died." It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; it is also important to ''know'' how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful - he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.

In practice, however, many treatments carry some risk of harm. In some circumstances, e.g. in desperate situations where the outcome without treatment will be grave, risky treatments that stand a high chance of harming the patient will be justified, as the risk of not treating is also very likely to do harm. So the principle of ''non-maleficence'' is not absolute, and  balances against the principle of [[#Beneficence|''beneficence'']] (doing good), as the effects of the two principles together often give rise to a ''double effect'' (further described in next section).

Depending on the cultural consensus conditioning (expressed by its religious, political and legal social system) the legal definition of non-maleficence differs. Violation of non-maleficence is the subject of [[medical malpractice]] litigation. Regulations therefore differ over time, per nation.

===Double effect===
{{Main|Principle of double effect}}
''Double effect'' refers to two types of consequences which may be produced by a single action,<ref>[http://medical.webends.com/kw/Double%20Effect Medical.Webends.com > Double effect] Retrieved September 2010</ref> and in medical ethics it is usually regarded as the combined effect of beneficence and non-maleficence.<ref>Page 424 in:{{cite book |author=Tefferi, Ayalew |title=Primary hematology |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-89603-664-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} [http://books.google.se/books?id=vYqJoUFFM2wC&pg=PA424&lpg]</ref>

A commonly cited example of this phenomenon is the use of morphine or other [[analgesic]] in the dying patient.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/double+effect TheFreeDictionary > double effect] Citing: McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine. 2002</ref> Such use of morphine can have the beneficial effect of easing the pain and suffering of the patient, while simultaneously having the maleficent effect of hastening the death of the patient through suppression of the respiratory system.

===Conflicts between autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence===
Autonomy can come into conflict with beneficence when patients disagree with recommendations that health care professionals believe are in the patient's best interest. When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict in a wide range of manners. Western medicine generally defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to make his own decisions, even in cases where the medical team believes that he is not acting in his own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.

Examples include when a patient does not want a treatment because of, for example, religious or cultural views. In the case of [[euthanasia]], the patient, or relatives of a patient, may want to end the life of the patient. Also, the patient may want an unnecessary treatment, as can be the case in [[hypochondria]] or with [[cosmetic surgery]]; here, the practitioner may be required to balance the desires of the patient for medically unnecessary potential risks against the patient's informed autonomy in the issue. A doctor may want to prefer autonomy because refusal to please the patient's will would harm the [[doctor-patient relationship]].

Individuals' capacity for informed decision making may come into question during resolution of conflicts between autonomy and beneficence. The role of surrogate medical decision makers is an extension of the principle of autonomy.

On the other hand, autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also overlap. For example, a breach of patients' autonomy may cause decreased confidence for medical services in the population and subsequently less willingness to seek help, which in turn may cause inability to perform beneficence.  Beneficence is a task worthy of many to complete due to its difficulty to perform under extreme circumstances that are not correlated directly with individuals seeking euthanasia.

The principles of autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence may also be expanded to include effects on the relatives of patients or even the medical practitioners, the overall population and economic issues when making medical decisions.

====Euthanasia====
{{Main|Euthanasia}}

{{POV-section|date=February 2012}}

There is disagreement among American physicians as to whether the non-maleficence principle excludes the practice of [[euthanasia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} An example of a doctor who did not believe euthanasia should be excluded was Dr. [[Jack Kevorkian]], who was convicted of second-degree homicide in Michigan in 1998 after demonstrating active euthanasia on the TV news show ''60 Minutes''.

In some countries such as the Netherlands, euthanasia is an accepted medical practice.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Legal regulations assign this to the medical profession. In such nations, the aim is to alleviate the suffering of patients from diseases known to be incurable by the methods known in that culture. In that sense, the "Primum no Nocere" is based on the belief that ''the inability of the medical expert to offer help, creates a known great and ongoing suffering in the patient''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Informed consent==
{{Main|Informed consent}}
'''Informed consent''' in ethics usually refers to the idea that a person must be fully informed about and understand the potential benefits and risks of their choice of treatment.  An uninformed person is at risk of mistakenly making a choice not reflective of his or her values or wishes.  It does not specifically mean the process of obtaining consent, nor the specific legal requirements, which vary from place to place, for capacity to consent.  Patients can elect to make their own medical decisions, or can delegate decision-making authority to another party.  If the patient is incapacitated, laws around the world designate different processes for obtaining informed consent, typically by having a person appointed by the patient or their [[next of kin]] make decisions for them.  The value of informed consent is closely related to the values of [[autonomy]] and truth telling.

A correlate to "informed consent" is the concept of [[informed refusal]].

==Confidentiality==
{{Main|Confidentiality}}
'''Confidentiality''' is commonly applied to conversations between doctors and patients.  This concept is commonly known as patient-physician privilege.

Legal protections prevent physicians from revealing their discussions with patients, even under oath in court.

Confidentiality is mandated in [[United States|America]] by [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] laws, specifically the Privacy Rule, and various state laws, some more rigorous than HIPAA. However, numerous exceptions to the rules have been carved out over the years. For example, many states require physicians to report gunshot wounds to the police and impaired drivers to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Confidentiality is also challenged in cases involving the diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in a patient who refuses to reveal the diagnosis to a spouse, and in the termination of a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Many states in the U.S. have laws governing parental notification in underage abortion.<ref>http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/Health/AbortionLaws/tabid/14401/Default.aspx#parent</ref><ref>[http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/aborlaws.htm National Conference of State Legislatures > Abortion Laws > Parental Involvement in Minors' Abortions]</ref>

Traditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice.  More recently, critics like Jacob Appel have argued for a more nuanced approach to the duty that acknowledges the need for flexibility in many cases.<ref>Appel, JM.  Must My Doctor Tell My Partner? Rethinking Confidentiality In the HIV Era, ''Medicine and Health Rhode Island'',  Jun 2006</ref>

Confidentiality is an important issue in [[primary care ethics]], where physicians care for many  patients from the same family and community, and where third parties often request information from the considerable medical database typically gathered in primary health care.

==Criticisms of orthodox medical ethics==
It has been argued that mainstream medical ethics is biased by the assumption of a framework in which individuals are not simply free to contract with one another to provide whatever medical treatment is demanded, subject to the ability to pay. Because a high proportion of medical care is typically provided via the welfare state, and because there are legal restrictions on what treatment may be provided and by whom, an automatic divergence may exist between the wishes of patients and the preferences of medical practitioners and other parties. Tassano<ref>Tassano, Fabian. ''The Power of Life or Death: Medical Coercion and the Euthanasia Debate''. Foreword by Thomas Szasz, MD. London: Duckworth, 1995.  Oxford: Oxford Forum, 1999.</ref> has questioned the idea that Beneficence might in some cases have priority over Autonomy. He argues that violations of Autonomy more often reflect the interests of the state or of the supplier group than those of the patient.

Routine regulatory professional bodies or the courts of law are valid social recourses.

==Importance of communication==
Many so-called "ethical conflicts" in medical ethics are traceable back to a lack of [[communication]].  Communication breakdowns between patients and their healthcare team, between family members, or between members of the medical community, can all lead to disagreements and strong feelings.  These breakdowns should be remedied, and many apparently insurmountable "ethics" problems can be solved with open lines of communication.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Control and resolution==
To ensure that appropriate ethical values are being applied within hospitals, effective [[hospital accreditation]] requires that ethical considerations are taken into account, for example with respect to physician integrity, conflicts of interest, research ethics and [[organ transplantation]] ethics.

===Guidelines===
There are various ethical guidelines. For example, the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] is regarded as authoritative in human research ethics.<ref name=Kimmelman2009>{{cite journal | last = Kimmelman | first =  J. | year = 2009 | title = Helsinki discords: FDA, ethics, and international drug trials | journal = The Lancet | volume = 373 | pages = 13–4 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61936-4 | last2 = Weijer | first2 = C | last3 = Meslin | first3 = E | pmid=19121708 | issue=9657}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, [[General Medical Council]] provides clear overall modern guidance in the form of its  '[http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/index.asp Good Medical Practice]' statement.  Other organisations, such as the [[Medical Protection Society]] and a number of university departments, are often consulted by British doctors regarding issues relating to ethics.

===Ethics committees===
Often, simple communication is not enough to resolve a conflict, and a hospital ethics committee must convene to decide a complex matter.

These bodies are composed primarily of health care professionals, but may also include [[philosopher]]s, lay people, and [[clergy]] - indeed, in many parts of the world their presence is considered mandatory in order to provide balance.

With respect to the expected composition of such bodies in the USA, Europe and Australia, the following applies [http://www.chrcrm.org/main/modules/pageworks/index.php?page=015&id=231].

<blockquote>
U.S. recommendations suggest that Research and Ethical Boards (REBs) should have five or more members, including at least one scientist, one non-scientist and one person not affiliated with the institution. The REB should include people knowledgeable in the law and standards of practice and professional conduct. Special memberships are advocated for handicapped or disabled concerns, if required by the protocol under review.

The European Forum for Good Clinical Practice (EFGCP) suggests that REBs include two practicing physicians who share experience in biomedical research and are independent from the institution where the research is conducted; one lay person; one lawyer; and one paramedical professional, e.g. nurse or pharmacist. They recommend that a quorum include both sexes from a wide age range and reflect the cultural make-up of the local community.

The 1996 Australian Health Ethics Committee recommendations were entitled, "Membership Generally of Institutional Ethics Committees". They suggest a chairperson be preferably someone not employed or otherwise connected with the institution. Members should include a person with knowledge and experience in professional care, counselling or treatment of humans; a minister of religion or equivalent, e.g. Aboriginal elder; a layman; a laywoman; a lawyer and, in the case of a hospital-based ethics committee, a nurse.
</blockquote>

The assignment of philosophers or religious clerics will reflect the importance attached by the [[society]] to the basic values involved. An example from [[Sweden]] with [[Torbjörn Tännsjö]] on a couple of such committees indicates [[secular]] trends gaining influence.

==Medical ethics in an online world==
Increasingly, medical researchers are researching activities in online environments such as discussion boards and bulletin boards, and there is concern that the requirements of informed consent and privacy are not as stringently applied as they should be, although some guidelines do exist.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eysenbach G, Till JE  |title=Ethical issues in qualitative research on internet communities |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |pages=1103–5 |year=2001 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7321.1103 |pmid=11701577 |issue=7321 |pmc=59687 }}</ref>

One issue that has arisen, however, is the disclosure of information.  While researchers wish to quote from the original source in order to argue a point, this can have repercussions. The quotations and other information about the site can be used to identify the site, and researchers have reported cases where members of the site, bloggers and others have used this information as 'clues' in a game in an attempt to identify the site.<ref name="Bruckman A 2002 217–31">{{cite journal |author=Bruckman A|title=Studying the amateur artist: A perspective on disguising data collected in human subjects research on the Internet |journal=Ethics and Information Technology |volume=4 |pages=217–31 |year=2002 |doi=10.1023/A:1021316409277 |issue=3 }}</ref> Some researchers have employed various methods of "heavy disguise,"<ref name="Bruckman A 2002 217–31"/> including discussing a different condition from that under study,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turkle S|title=Constructions and Reconstructions of Self in Virtual Reality |journal=Mind, Culture, and Activity |volume=1 |issue=3 | pages=158–167 |year=1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Turkle S|title=Multiple subjectivity and virtual community at the end of the Freudian century |journal=Sociological Inquiry |volume=67 |issue=1 | pages=72–84 |year=1997 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.1997.tb00430.x}}</ref> or even setting up bogus sites (called 'Maryut sites') to ensure that the researched site is not discovered.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Masters, K. |title=Non-disclosure in Internet-based research: the risks explored through a case study |journal=The Internet Journal of Medical Informatics |volume=5 |issue=2 | year=2010 | url=http://www.ispub.com/journal/the_internet_journal_of_medical_informatics/volume_5_number_2_51/article/non-disclosure-in-internet-based-research-the-risks-explored-through-a-case-study.html}}</ref>

==Cultural concerns==
Culture differences can create difficult medical ethics problems.  Some cultures have spiritual or magical theories about the origins of disease, for example, and reconciling these beliefs with the tenets of Western medicine can be difficult.

===Truth-telling===
Some cultures do not place a great emphasis on informing the patient of the diagnosis, especially when cancer is the diagnosis.  American culture rarely used truth-telling especially in medical cases, up until the 1970s.  In American medicine, the principle of [[informed consent]] now takes precedence over other ethical values, and patients are usually at least asked whether they want to know the diagnosis.

===Online business practices===
The delivery of diagnosis online leads patients to believe that doctors in some parts of the country are at the direct service of drug companies.  Finding diagnosis as convenient as what drug still has patent rights on it.  Physicians and drug companies are found to be competing for top ten search engine ranks to lower costs of selling these drugs with little to no patient involvement.<ref>http://www.prnewsnow.com/Public_Release/Managed_Care_And_HMO/209319.html

</ref>

==Conflicts of interest==
Physicians should not allow a conflict of interest to influence medical judgment.  In some cases, conflicts are hard to avoid, and doctors have a responsibility to avoid entering such situations.  Unfortunately, research has shown that conflicts of interests are very common among both academic physicians<ref name="pmid12533125">{{cite journal |author=Bekelman JE, Li Y, Gross CP |title=Scope and impact of financial conflicts of interest in biomedical research: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=4 |pages=454–65 |year=2003 |pmid=12533125 |doi=10.1001/jama.289.4.454}}</ref> and physicians in practice.<ref name="pmid17374816">{{cite journal |author=Ross JS, Lackner JE, Lurie P, Gross CP, Wolfe S, Krumholz HM |title=Pharmaceutical company payments to physicians: early experiences with disclosure laws in Vermont and Minnesota |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=11 |pages=1216–23 |year=2007 |pmid=17374816 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.11.1216}}</ref> The [http://www.pewtrusts.com/ The Pew Charitable Trusts] has [http://www.pewtrusts.com/news/news_subpage.cfm?content_item_id=3966&content_type_id=7 announced] the [http://www.prescriptionproject.org/ Prescription Project] for "academic medical centers, professional medical societies and public and private payers to end conflicts of interest resulting from the $12 billion spent annually on pharmaceutical marketing".

===Referral===
For example, doctors who receive income from referring patients for medical tests have been shown to refer more patients for medical tests.<ref name="pmid1406882">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199211193272107 |author=Swedlow A, Johnson G, Smithline N, Milstein A |title=Increased costs and rates of use in the California workers' compensation system as a result of self-referral by physicians |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=327 |issue=21 |pages=1502–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1406882}}</ref> This practice is proscribed by the American College of Physicians Ethics Manual.<ref name="pmid9518406 | ">{{cite journal |author= Jordan, M.

[[Fee splitting]] and the payments of commissions to attract referrals of patients is considered unethical and unacceptable in most parts of the world.

===Treatment of family members===
Many doctors treat their family members.  Doctors who do so must be vigilant not to create conflicts of interest or treat inappropriately.<ref name="pmid1922224">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199110313251806 |author=La Puma J, Stocking C, La Voie D, Darling C |title=When physicians treat members of their own families.

===Sexual relationships===
Sexual relationships between doctors and patients can create ethical conflicts, since sexual consent may conflict with the [[fiduciary]] responsibility of the physician. Doctors who enter into sexual relationships with patients face the threats of deregistration and prosecution. In the early 1990s, it was estimated that 2-9% of doctors had violated this rule.<ref name="pmid1441462">{{cite journal |author=Gartrell N, Milliken N, Goodson W, Thiemann S, Lo B |title=Physician-patient sexual contact. Prevalence and problems |journal=West J Med |volume=157 |issue=2 |pages=139–43 |year=1992 |pmid=1441462 |pmc=1011231}}</ref> Sexual relationships between physicians and patients' relatives may also be prohibited in some jurisdictions, although this prohibition is highly controversial.<ref>JM Appel.

==Futility==
{{Further|Futile medical care}}
The concept of medical futility has been an important topic in discussions of medical ethics. What should be done if there is no chance that a patient will survive but the family members insist on advanced care?  Previously, some articles defined futility as the patient having less than a one percent chance of surviving.  Some of these cases wind up in the courts.

Advanced directives include [[living wills]] and durable [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]] for health care.  (''See also [[Do Not Resuscitate]] and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]'')  In many cases, the "expressed wishes" of the patient are documented in these directives, and this provides a framework to guide family members and [[health care]] professionals in the decision making process when the patient is incapacitated.  Undocumented expressed wishes can also help guide decisions in the absence of advanced directives, as in the [[Quinlan case]] in Missouri.

"Substituted judgment" is the concept that a family member can give consent for treatment if the patient is unable (or unwilling) to give consent themselves.  The key question for the decision making surrogate is not, "What would you like to do?", but instead, "What do you think the patient would want in this situation?".

Courts have supported family's arbitrary definitions of futility to include simple biological survival, as in the [[Baby K]] case (in which the courts ordered a child born with only a brain stem instead of a complete brain to be kept on a ventilator based on the religious belief that all life must be preserved).

In some hospitals, medical futility is referred to as "non-beneficial care."

[[Baby Doe Law]] establishes state protection for a disabled child's right to life, ensuring that this right is protected even over the wishes of parents or guardians in cases where they want to withhold treatment.
