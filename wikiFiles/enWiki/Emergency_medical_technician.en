'''Emergency Medical Technician''' ('''EMT''') or '''Ambulance Technician''' are terms used in some countries to denote a [[healthcare]] provider of [[emergency medical services]].<ref name=BLS>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos101.htm |title= Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics|accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics }}</ref> Common terms, pejorative or obsolete in some cases, include '''ambulance driver''', '''ambulance orderly''', '''ambulance attendant''' and '''ambulanceman or woman'''.

The precise meaning of the term varies by jurisdiction, many countries EMTs respond to emergency calls, perform certain medical procedures and transport patients to hospital in accordance with protocols and guidelines established by physician medical directors. They may work in an [[ambulance]] service (paid or voluntary), as a member of [[technical rescue]] teams/squads, or as part of an allied service such as a [[Firefighter|fire]] or [[police]] department.
EMTs are trained to assess a patient's condition, and to perform such emergency medical procedures as are needed to maintain a patent [[airway]] with adequate breathing and cardiovascular [[Circulation (physiology)|circulation]] until the patient can be transferred to an appropriate destination for advanced medical care. Interventions include [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]], [[defibrillation]], controlling severe external [[bleeding]], preventing [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], body immobilization to prevent spinal damage, and splinting of bone fractures. EMT's are trained in BLS, or basic life support.  If the patient requires more advanced care during transport  that is out of the scope of practice of the EMT, a paramedic or RN will assist in transport. A national exam is required for certification following the mandated in- class hours and patient- contact requirements. 

==Paramedics in Canada==
In Canada the scope of practice of Paramedics is described by the National Occupational Competency Profile (NOCP) for Paramedics document developed by the Paramedic Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Occupational Competency Profile| url=http://www.paramedic.ca/Content.aspx?ContentID=4&ContentTypeID=2| accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> Most providers that work in [[ambulances]] will be identified as 'Paramedics'. However, in many cases, the most prevalent level of emergency prehospital care is that which is provided by the Emergency Medical Responder (EMR).  This is a level of practice recognized under the National Occupational Competency Profile, although unlike the next three successive levels of practice, the EMR is not specifically considered a Paramedic, ''per se''.  The high number of EMRs across Canada cannot be ignored as contributing a critical role in the chain of survival, although it is a level of practice that is least comprehensive (clinically speaking), and is also generally not consistent with any medical acts beyond advanced first-aid, with the exception of automated external defibrillation (which is still considered a regulated medical act in most provinces in Canada).

Of considerable relevance to understanding the nature of Canadian Paramedic practice, the reader must appreciate the considerable degree of inter-provincial variation.  Although a national consensus (by way of the National Occupational Competency Profile) identifies certain knowledge, skills, and abilities as being most synonymous with a given level of Paramedic practice, each province retains ultimate authority in legislating the actual administration and delivery of emergency medical services within its own borders.  For this reason, any discussion of ''Paramedic Practice'' in Canada is necessarily broad, and general.  Specific regulatory frameworks and questions related to Paramedic practice can only definitively be answered by consulting relevant provincial legislation, although provincial Paramedic Associations may often offer a simpler overview of this topic when it is restricted to a province-by-province basis.

Regulatory frameworks vary from province to province, and include direct government regulation (such as Ontario's method of credentialing its practitioners with the title of A-EMCA, or Advanced Emergency Medical Care Assistant) to professional self-regulating bodies, such as the Alberta College of Paramedics.  Though the title of Paramedic is a generic description of a category of practitioners, provincial variability in regulatory methods accounts for ongoing differences in actual titles that are ascribed to different levels of practitioners.  For example, the province of [[Alberta]] uses the title "Emergency Medical Technician", or 'EMT' for the Primary Care Paramedic and 'Paramedic' only for those qualified as Advanced Care Paramedics [[Advanced Life Support]] (ALS) providers - but almost all [[Canadian provinces|provinces]] are gradually moving to adopting the new titles, or have at least recognized the NOCP document as a benchmarking document to permit inter-provincial labour mobility of practitioners, regardless of how titles are specifically regulated within their own provincial systems.  In this manner, the confusing myriad of titles and occupational descriptions can at least be discussed using a common language for comparison sake.

=== Primary care paramedics ===<!-- This section is linked from [[PCP]] -->
Primary care paramedics (PCP) are the entry-level of paramedic practice in Canadian provinces. The [[scope of practice]] includes performing [[automated external defibrillator|semi-automated external defibrillation]], interpretation of 4-lead or 12 lead ECG's depending on the area, administration of [[Symptom Relief Medications]] for a variety of emergency medical conditions (these include [[oxygen]], [[epinephrine]], [[glucagon]], [[salbutamol]], [[Aspirin|ASA]] (aspirin) and [[nitroglycerine]]), performing [[trauma immobilization]] (including [[cervical immobilization]]), and other fundamental basic medical care. Primary Care Paramedics may also receive additional training in order to perform certain skills that are normally in the scope of practice of Advanced Care Paramedics. This is regulated both provincially (by statute) and locally (by the medical director), and ordinarily entails an aspect of medical oversight by a specific body or group of physicians.  This is often referred to as [[Medical Control]], or a role played by a base hospital.  For example, in the province of [[Ontario]] many paramedic services allow Primary Care Paramedics to perform 12-lead [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] interpretation, or initiate [[intravenous therapy]] to deliver a few additional medications, such as 50% Dextrose.

===Training===
Paramedic training in Canada is intense, as paramedics are seen as [[health professional]]s and equal in importance to [[nurses]], [[respiratory therapists]], cardiac perfusionists and others.  Nevertheless, the nature of training and how it is regulated, like actual paramedic practice, varies from province to province.  Training varies regionally, for example, the Primary Care Paramedic training may be six months (British Columbia) two to four years (Ontario) in length.

==Ireland==
{{main|PHECC}}
Emergency Medical Technician is a legally defined title in the [[Republic of Ireland]] based on the standard set down by the [[Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council]] (PHECC). Emergency Medical Technician is the entry-level standard of practitioner for employment within the [[HSE National Ambulance Service|ambulance service]]. Currently, EMTs are authorised to work on non-emergency ambulances only as the standard for emergency ([[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]]) calls is a minimum of a two-paramedic crew. EMTs are a vital part of the voluntary and auxiliary services where a practitioner must be on board any ambulance in the process of transporting a patient to hospital.

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Emergency medical personnel in the United Kingdom}}
Emergency Medical Technician is a term that has only recently been introduced into the ambulance service in the [[United Kingdom]]. A number of [[National Health Service]] ambulance services are running EMT conversion courses for staff who were trained by the Institute of Healthcare Development (IHCD) as Ambulance Technicians and Assistant Ambulance Practitioners. Ambulance trusts such as the [[London Ambulance Service]] and the [[North West Ambulance Service]] are in the process of converting existing Ambulance Technicians into new roles as Emergency Medical Technician 1,2,3 or 4 based on their level of experience. IHCD Ambulance Technicians and Assistant Ambulance Practitioners still exist within other UK ambulance services, providing a similar level of care to the EMT with [[Emergency care assistant|Emergency Care Assistants]] employed in some areas as support.
This grade of staff is now being phased out and replaced with lower qualified Emergency care assistants.

=== History ===
EMT program in the United States began as part of the "Alexandria Plan" in the early 70's, in addition to a growing issue with injuries associated with car accidents. Emergency medicine (EM) as a medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the 1960s and 70s, hospital emergency departments were generally staffed by physicians on staff at the hospital on a rotating basis, among them general surgeons, internists, psychiatrists, and dermatologists. Physicians in training (interns and residents), foreign medical graduates and sometimes nurses also staffed the Emergency Department (ED). EM was born as a specialty in order to fill the time commitment required by physicians on staff to work in the increasingly chaotic emergency departments (EDs) of the time. During this period, groups of physicians began to emerge who had left their respective practices in order to devote their work completely to the ED. The first of such groups was headed by Dr. James DeWitt Mills who, along with four associate physicians; Dr. Chalmers A. Loughridge, Dr. William Weaver, Dr. John McDade, and Dr. Steven Bednar at Alexandria Hospital, VA established 24/7 year round emergency care which became known as the "Alexandria Plan". It was not until the establishment of American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the recognition of emergency medicine training programs by the AMA and the AOA, and in 1979 a historical vote by the American Board of Medical Specialties that EM became a recognized medical specialty. The nations first EMT's were from the Alexandria plan working as Emergency Care Technicians serving in the Alexandria Hospital Emergency Room. The training for these technicians was modeled after the established "Physician Assistant" training program and later restructured to meet the basic needs for emergency pre-hospital care. On June 24, 2011, The Alexandria Hospital Celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Alexandria Plan. In attendance were three of the nations first ECTs/EMTs: David Stover, Larry Jackson,and Kenneth Weaver.

=== Certification ===<!-- This section is linked from [[GERMS]] -->
In the [[United States]], EMTs are certified according to their level of training. Individual [[U.S. state|states]] set their own standards of certification (or licensure, in some cases) and all EMT training must meet the minimum requirements as set by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s (NHTSA) standards for curriculum.<ref name=NHTSA_NSC>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem.2a0771e91315babbbf30811060008a0c/?javax.portlet.tpst=4670b93a0b088a006bc1d6b760008a0c_ws_MX&javax.portlet.prp_4670b93a0b088a006bc1d6b760008a0c_viewID=detail_view&itemID=1822abcc80c81010VgnVCM1000002c567798RCRD&overrideViewName=Article |title= National Standard Curriculum|accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher= National Highway Transportation Safety Administration }}</ref> The [[National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians]] (NREMT) is a private organization<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nremt.org/about/Legal_Opinion.asp |title= Legal Opinion: Certification v.

The [[Veteran Emergency Medical Technician Support Act of 2013]], H.R. 235 in the [[113th United States Congress]], would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to direct the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary]] of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services (HHS)]] to establish a demonstration program for states with a shortage of emergency medical technicians to streamline state requirements and procedures to assist [[veteran|veterans]] who completed military EMT training while serving in the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] to meet state EMT certification and [[licensure]] requirements.

=== Levels ===
<!-- Please please please do not add state specific information. There's about 7 different names for paramedics between the states, for example (including one that counts EMT-I/99 as a "EMT-P." This article simply can't contain information about every single level and still have a hope of readability. Instead, there's a list of each levels listed by state linked in the EMT-I section. Please take a look at that to determine if anything about YOUR state needs to be added or changed -->

{{See also|Emergency medical responder levels by U.S. state}}

The NHTSA recognizes four levels of EMTs<ref name=NHTSA_NSC/>:

*[[EMT-B]] (Basic)
*[[EMT-I/85]] (Intermediate)
*[[EMT-I/99]] (Intermediate or Advanced)
*[[Paramedics in the United States|EMT-P]] (Paramedic)

Some states also recognize the Advanced Practice Paramedic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wakegov.com/ems/staff/app.htm |title=Advanced Practice Paramedic |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref> or Critical Care Paramedic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.tn.us/sos/rules/1200/1200-12/1200-12-05.pdf |title=Tennessee Critical Care Paramedic |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref> level as a state-specific licensure above that of the paramedic. In addition, EMTs can seek out specialty certifications such as [[Wilderness emergency medical technician|Wilderness EMT]], Wilderness Paramedic and [[Air medical services|Flight Paramedic]].

==== Transition to new levels ====

In 2009, the NREMT posted information about a transition to a new system of levels for emergency care providers developed by the NHTSA with the National Scope of Practice project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasemso.org/documents/FINALEMSSept2006_PMS314.pdf |title= National EMS Scope of Practice Model|accessdate=2011-09-18 |work= | format= PDF|publisher=NHTSA |month=September | year=2006}}</ref> By 2014, these "new" levels will replace the fragmented system found around the United States. The new classification will include emergency medical responder (replacing first responder), emergency medical technician (replacing EMT-Basic), advanced emergency medical technician (replacing EMT-Intermediate 1985), and paramedic (replacing EMT-Intermediate 1999 and EMT-Paramedic).

==== EMT-B ====

[[Image:DerbySpiralFracture1221.JPG|thumb|left|EMTs tend to a [[spiral fracture]] at a [[roller derby]] bout.]]

[[Emergency medical technician-basic|EMT-Basic]] is the entry level of EMS.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/ems/pub/emtbnsc.pdf |title= Emergency Medical Technician-Basic National Standard Curriculum|accessdate=2008-03-10 |format= PDF|publisher= National Highway Transportation Safety Administration}}</ref>  The procedures and skills allowed at this level are generally non-invasive such as bleeding control, [[positive pressure ventilation]] with a [[bag valve mask]], [[oropharyngeal airway]], [[nasopharyngeal airway]], supplemental oxygen administration, and splinting (including full spinal immobilization). Training requirements and treatment protocols vary from area to area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emsa.ca.gov/legislation/FinalApprovedChapter3242007.pdf|title=EMT-I (1) Regulations |accessdate=2008-03-10 |format=PDF |publisher= California EMSA |pages= 6–7, 11–23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scdhec.gov/health/ems/cskills.pdf|title=SC EMT-Basic Skills |accessdate=2008-03-10 |format=PDF |publisher= South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control }}</ref>

==== Intermediate levels of EMT ====

[[EMT Intermediate|EMT-Intermediate]]s are the levels of training between basic (EMT-B) and [[paramedic]] (EMT-P). There are  two intermediate levels that are tested for by the NREMT, the EMT-I/85 and the EMT-I/99, with the 1999 level being the more advanced of the two. The standard curriculum for EMT-I from 1998 is defined by the NHTSA, but each state may not have implemented or approved this program. Many states have stopped issuing new Intermediate licensure, instead focusing on maintaining the current lists of intermediates they have, and encouraging the Basic to Paramedic program philosophy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/ems/EMT-I/ |title= Emergency Medical Technician-Intermediate: National Standard Curriculum|accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher= National Highway Transportation Safety Administration }}</ref> Outside of the NHTSA framework, [[Emergency medical responder levels by state|some states have instituted their own intermediate EMT]] levels using a variety of names (e.g. Advanced EMT in California<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emsa.ca.gov/personnel/EMT.asp |title=EMT Information |accessdate=2011-09-18 |publisher=California Emergency Medical Services Authority }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> or the levels of Advanced EMT-Intermediate and Advanced EMT-Critical Care in New York<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/ems/educ.htm |title=Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Certification and Education Information |accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=New York State Department of Health }}</ref>).

===== EMT-I/85 =====

EMT-I/85 is a level of training that will typically allow several more invasive procedures than are allowed at the basic level, including IV therapy, the use of multi-lumen airway devices (even endotracheal intubation in some states), and provides for enhanced assessment skills.

===== EMT-I/99 =====

The EMT-I/99 represents a higher level than the EMT-I/85 with an expanded scope of practice, such as cardiac monitoring and the administration of additional pharmaceutical interventions, as well as additional training time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/ems/EMT-I/index.html |title= 1998 Emergency Medical Technician - Intermediate: National Standard Curriculum|accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=National Highway Transportation Safety Administration }}</ref>

==== EMT-P ====

[[Paramedics in the United States|EMT-Paramedics]], who are commonly referred to as simply "paramedics", represents the highest level of EMT, and in general, the highest level of prehospital medical provider, though some areas utilize physicians as providers on [[air ambulance]]s or as a ground provider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://em.morristownresidency.org/Fellowships/EMS%20Fellowship%20Overview.htm |title=EMS Fellowship Overview |accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher= Morristown Memorial Hospital Emergency Medicine Residency}}</ref> Paramedics perform a variety of medical procedures such as fluid resuscitation, pharmaceutical administration, obtaining IV access, cardiac monitoring (continuous and 12-lead), and other advanced procedures and assessments.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ochealthinfo.com/medical/ems/procedures.htm|title= BLS/ALS Procedures|accessdate=2011-09-18 |publisher=Orange County EMS Agency }}</ref>

==== Staffing levels ====

An [[ambulance]] with only EMT-Bs is considered a [[basic life support]] (BLS) unit, an ambulance utilizing EMT-Is is dubbed an intermediate life support (ILS) unit, and an ambulance with [[paramedics]] is dubbed an [[advanced life support]] (ALS) unit. Some states allow ambulance crews to contain a mix of crews levels (i.e. a basic and a paramedic or an intermediate and a paramedic) to staff ambulances and operate at the level of the highest trained provider. There is nothing stopping supplemental crew members to be of a certain certification, though (e.g. if an ALS ambulance is required to have two paramedics, then it is acceptable to have two paramedics and a basic).

=== Education and training ===
EMT training programs for certification vary greatly from course to course, provided that each course at least meets local and national requirements. In the United States, EMT-Bs receive at least 110 hours of classroom training, often reaching or exceeding 120 hours.  EMT-Is generally have 200–400 hours of training, and EMT-Ps are trained for 1,000 hours or more. In addition, a minimum number of continuing education (CE) hours are required to maintain certification. For example, to maintain NREMT certification, EMT-Bs must obtain at least 48 hours of additional education and either complete a 24 hour refresher course or complete an additional 24 hours of CEs that would cover, on an hour by hour basis, the same topics as the refresher course would.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nremt.org/EMTServices/rr_basic_history.asp |title= NREMT "EMT-Basic Recertification|accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071028093612/http://nremt.org/EMTServices/rr_basic_history.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-28}}</ref> Recertification for other levels follows a similar pattern.

EMT training programs vary greatly in calendar length (number of days or months). For example, fast track programs are available for EMT-Bs that are completed in two weeks by holding class for 8 to 12 hours a day for at least two weeks. Other training programs are months long, or up to 2 years for paramedics in an associates degree program. In addition to each level's didactic education, clinical rotations may also be required (especially for levels above EMT-Basic). Similar in a sense to medical school clinical rotations, EMT students are required to spend a required amount of time in an ambulance and on a variety of hospital services (e.g. [[obstetrics]], [[emergency department|emergency medicine]], [[surgery]], [[psychiatry]]) in order to complete a course and become eligible for the certification exam. The number of clinical hours for both time in an ambulance and time in the hour vary depending on local requirements, the level the student is obtaining, and the amount of time it takes the student to show competency.<ref name=NHTSA_NSC/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.link2life.org/pricing.asp#EMTonlyCLASSESFOR19992000 |title=2008 EMT-Basic Course Schedule |accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=Link 2 Life}}

EMT training programs take place at numerous locations, such as universities, community colleges, technical schools, hospitals or EMS academies. Every state in the United States has an EMS lead agency or state office of emergency medical services that regulates and accredits EMT training programs. Most of these offices have web sites to provide information to the public and individuals who are interested in becoming an EMT.

=== Medical direction ===
In the United States, an EMT's actions in the field are governed by state regulations, local regulations, and by the policies of their EMS organization.  The development of these policies are guided by a [[physician]] [[medical director]], often with the advice of a medical advisory committee.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ochealthinfo.com/medical/ems/|title= About us|accessdate=2011-09-18 |publisher= Orange County EMS Agency}}</ref>

In California, for example, each county's Local Emergency Medical Service Agency (LEMSA) issues a list of standard operating procedures or protocols, under the supervision of the [[California Emergency Medical Services Authority]].  These procedures often vary from county to county based on local needs, levels of training and clinical experiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emsa.ca.gov/aboutemsa/mandate.asp |title=EMS Authority's Mandates Summary |accessdate=2008-03-11 |publisher=California Emergency Medical Services Authority }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  New York State has similar procedures, whereas a regional medical-advisory council ("REMAC") determines protocols for one or more counties in a geographical section of the state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/ems/about.htm|title=What is the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services |accessdate=2008-03-11 |publisher= New York State Department of Health }}</ref>

Treatments and procedures administered by paramedics fall under one of two categories, off-line medical orders (standing orders) or on-line medical orders. On-line medical orders refers to procedures that must be explicitly approved by a base hospital physician or registered nurse through voice communication (generally by phone or [[radio]]) and are generally rare or high risk procedures (e.g. [[rapid sequence induction]] or [[cricothyrotomy]]).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ochealthinfo.com/medical/ems/guidelines/|title= Treatment Guidelines|accessdate=2008-03-11 |publisher=Orange County EMS Agency }}</ref> In addition, when multiple levels can perform the same procedure (e.g. AEMT-Critical Care and EMT-Paramedics in New York), a procedure can be both an on-line and a standing order depending on the level of the provider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aarems.org/regionalALS.php|title=AAREMS 2007 Regional ALS Treatment Protocols |accessdate=2011-09-18 |publisher= Adirondack - Appalachian Regional Emergency Medical Services Council}}</ref> Since no set of protocols can cover every patient situation, many systems work with protocols as guidelines and not "cook book" treatment plans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rivcoems.org/downloads/downloads_documents/Protocol102904/7000.pdf|title= Patient Care Policy (ALS)|accessdate=2008-03-11 |format=PDF |publisher= Riverside County Emergency Medical Services Agency| page=1 }}</ref> Finally, systems also have policies in place to handle medical direction when communication failures happen or in disaster situations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ochealthinfo.com/docs/medical/ems/P&P/330.15.pdf |title=Advanced Life Support Treatment In Communication Failure or Without Base Hospital contact |accessdate=2008-03-11 |format= PDF|publisher= Orange County Emergency Medical Services Agency}}</ref>
The NHTSA curriculum is the foundation Standard of Care for EMS providers in the US.

=== Employment ===
EMTs are employed in varied settings<ref name=BLS/> ranging from industrial and entertainment positions<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sixflags.com/magicMountain/jobs/JobListings.aspx |title=Job Openings |accessdate=2008-03-13 |format= |publisher=Six Flags Magic Mountain |unused_data=Risk Management: Emergency Medical Technician/Paramedic quote= }}</ref> to hospital and health care settings, and the prehospital environment. The prehospital environment is loosely divided into non-emergency (e.g. hospital discharges) and emergency ([[9-1-1]] calls) services, but many ambulance services operate both non-emergency and emergency care.

In many places across the United States, it is not uncommon for the primary employer of EMTs (both EMT-Ps and EMT-Bs) to be the [[fire department]], with the fire department providing the primary emergency medical system response.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.santa-ana.ca.us/fire/emergency_medical.asp |title= Emergency Medical Services|accessdate=2008-03-13 |publisher=City of Santa Ana }}</ref> In other locations, such as [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], emergency medical services are provided by a separate, or “third-party”, government agency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonems.com/ |title= Boston EMS|accessdate=2008-03-13 }}</ref> In still other locations, emergency medical services are provided by volunteer agencies. College and university campuses may provide emergency medical responses on their own campus using students.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncemsf.org/resources/links/showlinks.ems?category=999|title= National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation|accessdate=2008-03-13 }}</ref>

In some states of the US, many EMS agencies are run by Independent Non-Profit Volunteer First Aid Squads that are their own corporations set up as separate entities from fire departments.  In this environment, volunteers are hired to fill certain blocks of time to cover emergency calls.  These volunteers have the same state certification as their paid counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njsfac.org/index.shtml|title=NJ State First Aid Council|accessdate=2010-05-21 |publisher=NJ State First Aid Council}}</ref>
