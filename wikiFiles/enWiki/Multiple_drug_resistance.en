'''Multiple drug resistance''' ('''MDR'''), '''multi-drug resistance''' or '''multiresistance''' is a condition enabling disease-causing microrganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites) to resist distinct [[antimicrobials]], first and foremost [[antibiotics]],but also [[antifungal drug]]s, [[antiviral medication]]s, [[antiparasitic drugs]], chemicals of a wide variety<ref>{{MeshName|Drug+Resistance,+Multiple}}</ref> of structure and function targeted at eradicating the organism.  
Recognizing different degrees of MDR, the terms extensively-drug resistant (XDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR)have been introduced. The definitions were published in 2011 in a journal called "Clinical Microbiology and Infection" and are openly accessible <ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03570.x/pdf</ref>This article discusses multi-drug resistance of [[bacteria]], [[fungi]],[[virus]]es and [[parasites]], not that of [[tumor]] cells, which are discussed in the section of [[antineoplastic resistance]].

==Common Multi-Drug-Resistant Organisms (MDROs)==
are usually bacteria:
* [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci]] (VRE)
* Methicillin-Resistant ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' ''aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]])
* [[Beta-lactamase#Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)|Extended-spectrum β-lactamase]] (ESBLs) producing Gram-negative bacteria
* [[Beta-lactamase#KPC (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) (Class A)|''Klebsiella'' ''pneumoniae'' carbapenemase]] (KPC) producing Gram-negatives
* MultiDrug-Resistant gram negative rods (MDR GNR)[[MDRGN bacteria]] such as ''[[Enterobacter]] species'', ''[[E.coli]]'',''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''

A group of gram positive and gram negative bacteria of particular recent importance have been dubbed as the ESKAPE group (Enterococcus faecium,Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)<ref>Boucher, HW, Talbot GH, Bradley JS, Edwards JE, Gilvert D, Rice LB, Schedul M., Spellberg B., Bartlett J.

==Bacterial resistance to antibiotics==
{{main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Various microorganisms have survived for thousands of years by their ability to adapt to [[antimicrobial agent]]s. They do so via [[spontaneous mutation]] or by [[DNA transfer]]. This process enables some bacteria to oppose the action of certain antibiotics, rendering the antibiotics ineffective.<ref name="pmid18193080">{{cite journal | author = Bennett PM | title = Plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance: acquisition and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria | journal = Br. J. Pharmacol. | volume = 153 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = S347–57 | year = 2008 | month = March | pmid = 18193080 | pmc = 2268074 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707607 }}</ref> These microorganisms employ several mechanisms in attaining multi-drug resistance:  
* No longer relying on a glycoprotein [[cell wall]]
* [[Antibiotic_resistance#Mechanisms|Enzymatic deactivation of antibiotics]]
* Decreased cell wall permeability to antibiotics
* Altered target sites of antibiotic
* [[Efflux (microbiology)|Efflux]] mechanisms to remove antibiotics<ref name="pmid19678712">{{cite journal | author = Li XZ, Nikaido H | title = Efflux-mediated drug resistance in bacteria: an update | journal = Drugs | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623 | year = 2009 | month = August | pmid = 19678712 | pmc = 2847397 | doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000 }}</ref>
* Increased [[mutation rate]] as a stress response<ref name="pmid16596883">{{cite journal | author = Stix G | title = An antibiotic resistance fighter | journal = Sci. Am. | volume = 294 | issue = 4 | pages = 80–3 | year = 2006 | month = April | pmid = 16596883 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

Many different bacteria now exhibit multi-drug resistance, including [[staphylococci]], [[enterococci]], [[gonococci]], [[streptococci]], [[salmonella]], as well as numerous other gram negative bacteria and ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Some resistant bacteria are able to transfer copies of [[DNA]] that code for a mechanism of resistance to other nearby species of bacteria, thereby conferring resistance to their neighbors, which then are also able to pass on the resistant gene. This process is called [[horizontal gene transfer]].

==Antifungal resistance==
Yeasts such as ''Candida species'' can become resistant under long term treatment with azole preparations, requiring treatemnt with a different drug class.
[[Scedosporium prolificans]] infections are almost uniformly fatal because of their resistance to multiple antifungal agents.<ref name="pmid12627286">{{cite journal | author = Howden BP, Slavin MA, Schwarer AP, Mijch AM | title = Successful control of disseminated Scedosporium prolificans infection with a combination of voriconazole and terbinafine | journal = Eur.

==Antiviral resistance==
[[HIV]] is the prime example of MDR against antivirals, as it mutates rapidly under monotherapy.
[[Influenza virus]] has become increasingly MDR; first to amantadenes, then to [[neuraminidase inhibitors]] such as [[oseltamivir]], (2008-2009: 98.5% of Influenza A tested resistant), also more commonly in immunoincompetent people 
[[Cytomegalovirus]] can become resistant to [[ganciclovir]] and [[foscarnet]] under treatment, especially in immunosupressed patients.  
[[Herpes simplex virus]] rarely becomes resistant to [[acyclovir]] preparations, mostly in the form of cross-resistance to [[famciclovir]] and [[valacyclovir]], usually in immunosupressed patients.

==Antiparasitic resistance==
The prime example for MDR against antiparasitic drugs is [[malaria]]. ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' has become [[chloroquine]] and [[sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine]] resistant a few decades ago, and as of 2012 [[artemisinin]]-resistant [[Plasmodium falciparum]]  has emerged in western Cambodia and western Thailand. 
''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' can also become resistant to [[artemisinin]], as well as [[atovaquone]] and [[sulfadiazine]], but is not usually MDR <ref>Doliwa C, Escotte-Binet S, Aubert D, Velard F, Schmid A, Geers R, Villena I. Induction of sulfadiazine resistance in vitro in Toxoplasma gondii.Exp Parasitol. 2013 Feb;133(2):131-6.</ref> 
[[Antihelminthic]] resistance is mainly reported in the veterinary literature, for example in connection with the practice of livestock drenching<ref>Laurenson YC, Bishop SC, Forbes AB, Kyriazakis I.Modelling the short- and long-term impacts of drenching frequency and targeted selective treatment on the performance of grazing lambs and the emergence of antihelmintic resistance.Parasitology. 2013 Feb 1:1-12.</ref> and has been recent focus of FDA regulation.

==Preventing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance==
To limit the development of antimicrobial resistance, it has been suggested to:
* Use the appropriate antimicrobial for an infection; e.g. no antibiotics for viral infections
* Identify the causative organism whenever possible
* Select an antimicrobial which targets the specific organism, rather than relying on a broad-spectrum antimicrobial
* Complete an appropriate duration of antimicrobial treatment (not too short and not too long)
* Use the correct dose for eradication; subtherapeutic dosing is associated with resistance, as demonstrated in food animals.

The medical community relies on education of its prescribers, and self-regulation in the form of appeals to voluntary [[antimicrobial stewardship]], which at hospitals may take the form of an antimicrobial stewardship program. It has been argued that depending on the cultural context government can aid in educating the public on the importance of restrictive use of antibiotics for human clinical use, but unlike narcotics, there is no regulation of its use anywhere in the world at this time. Antibiotic use has been restricted or regulated for treating animals raised for human consumption with success, in Denmark for example. 

[[Infection prevention]] is the most efficient strategy of prevention of an infection with a MDR organism within a hospital, because there are few alternatives to antibiotics in the case of a extensively resistant or panresistant infection; if an infection is localized, removal or excision can be attempted (with MDR-TB the lung for example), but in the case of a systemic infection only generic measures like boosting the immune system with immunoglobulins may be possible. The use of[[bacteriophage]]s (viruses which kill bacteria) has no clinical application at the present time.
