'''Chemoprophylaxis''' refers to the administration of a [[medication]] for the purpose of preventing [[disease]] or [[infection]].<ref name="Woolf_et_al2008"/> [[Antibiotics]], for example, may be administered to patients with disorders of [[immune system]] function to prevent bacterial [[infection]]s (particularly [[opportunistic infection]]).<ref name="Golan2008"/> Antibiotics may also be administered to healthy individuals to limit the spread of an [[epidemic]], or to patients who have repeated infections (such as [[urinary tract infection]]s) to prevent recurrence.

In some cases, chemoprophylaxis is initiated to prevent the spread of an existing infection in an individual to a new organ system, as when [[intrathecal]] [[chemotherapy]] is administered in patients with [[malignancy]] to prevent further infection.

The use of chemoprophylaxis is limited primarily by two factors:  risk and financial costs.
*All medications have the potential to cause [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]].  In general, chemoprophylaxis should be initiated only when the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.
*The cost associated with chemoprophylaxis may be prohibitive, particularly when the cost of treatment is high or the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of the target disease is low.  Many forms of chemoprophylaxis are therefore not [[cost-effectiveness|cost-effective]].

==Specific diseases==
Using chemoprophylaxis as a treatment against early signs of [[tuberculosis]] has proven to be effective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In [[familial adenomatous polyposis]] physicians observed polyps regression with [[NSAID]]s for anti-inflammatory therapy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Chemoprophylaxis is also used to treat several different varieties of meningococcal infections for close contact exposure to [[Neisseria meningitidis]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==See also==
* [[Prophylaxis]], a more general term.
* [[Primary prevention]], in which measures are undertaken to prevent the onset of disease in individuals who are susceptible (as when patients receive [[aspirin]] or [[statin]]s to delay the development of [[coronary artery disease]]).
