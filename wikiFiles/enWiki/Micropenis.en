'''Micropenis''' is an unusually small [[penis]]. A common criterion is a dorsal (measured on top) erect [[Human penis size|penile length]] of at least 2.5 [[standard deviation]]s smaller than the [[mean]] [[human penis size]],<ref name="pmid7366061">{{cite journal |author=Lee PA |title=Micropenis.

The term is most often used medically when the rest of the penis, [[scrotum]], and [[perineum]] are without [[Ambiguous genitalia|ambiguity]], such as [[hypospadias]]. Micropenis occurs in about 0.6% of males.<ref name="ScienceDaily04"/>

==Causes==

Of the abnormal conditions associated with micropenis, most are conditions of reduced prenatal [[androgen]] production or effect, such as abnormal testicular development (testicular dysgenesis), [[Klinefelter syndrome]], [[Leydig cell hypoplasia]]), specific defects of [[testosterone]] or dihydrotestosterone synthesis ([[17,20-lyase deficiency]], [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency|5α-reductase deficiency]]), [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]]s, inadequate [[pituitary]] stimulation ([[gonadotropin]] deficiency), and other forms of congenital [[hypogonadism]]. Micropenis can also occur as part of many genetic malformation syndromes that do not involve the sex chromosomes. It is sometimes a sign of congenital [[Growth hormone deficiency|growth-hormone deficiency]] or congenital [[hypopituitarism]]. Several [[homeobox]] genes affect penis and digit size without detectable hormone abnormalities.

In addition, [[in utero]] exposure to some estrogen based [[fertility medication|fertility drugs]] like [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) has been linked to genital abnormalities and/or a smaller than normal penis (microphallus). <ref>{{cite news|last=Center of Disease Control|title=DES Update: Consumers|url=http://www.cdc.gov/des/consumers/about/effects_sons.html}}</ref>

After evaluation to detect any of the conditions described above, micropenis can often be treated in infancy with injections of various [[hormone]]s, such as [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] and [[testosterone]].

Most eight- to fourteen-year-old boys referred for micropenis do not have the micropenis condition. Such concerns are usually explained by one of the following:

# a penis concealed in suprapubic fat (extra fat around the [[mons pubis]]).
# a large body and frame for which a prepubertal penis simply appears too small.
# [[delayed puberty]] with every reason to expect good future growth.

==Treatment==
===Hormone treatment===
[[Image:Men with micropenis.jpg|thumb|Man with micropenis, [[hypogonadism]], and [[gynecomastia]]]]
Growth of the penis both before birth and during childhood and puberty is strongly influenced by [[testosterone]] and, to a lesser degree, [[growth hormone]]; but their value in the treatment of micropenis is mainly limited to conditions of hormone deficiency, such as [[hypopituitarism]] or [[hypogonadism]]. 

Regardless of the cause of micropenis, if it is recognized in infancy, a brief course of testosterone is often prescribed<ref name="pmid15201804">{{cite journal |author=Ishii T, Sasaki G, Hasegawa T, Sato S, Matsuo N, Ogata T |title=Testosterone enanthate therapy is effective and independent of SRD5A2 and AR gene polymorphisms in boys with micropenis |journal=J. Urol. |volume=172 |issue=1 |pages=319–24 |year=2004 |pmid=15201804 |doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000129005.84831.1e}}</ref> (usually no more than 3 months). This usually induces a small amount of growth, confirming the likelihood of further growth at puberty, but rarely achieves normal size. No additional testosterone is given during childhood, to avoid unwanted [[virilization]] and [[bone maturation]]. (There also is some evidence that premature administration of testosterone can lead to reduced penis size in the adult.)<ref name="pmid7609189">{{cite journal |author=McMahon DR, Kramer SA, Husmann DA |title=Micropenis: does early treatment with testosterone do more harm than good? |journal=J. Urol. |volume=154 |issue=2 Pt 2 |pages=825–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7609189|doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(01)67175-1}}</ref>

Testosterone treatment is resumed in adolescence only for boys with hypogonadism. Penile growth is completed at the end of puberty, similarly to the completion of [[Human height|height growth]], and provision of extra testosterone to post-pubertal adults produces little or no further growth.

===Surgery===
Because hormone treatment rarely achieves average size, several surgical techniques similar to [[phalloplasty]] for [[penis enlargement]] have been devised and performed; but they are not generally considered successful enough to be widely adopted and are rarely performed in childhood.

In extreme cases of micropenis, there is barely any shaft, and the glans appears to sit almost on the pubic skin. From the 1960s until the late 1970s, it was common for [[sex reassignment]] and [[History of intersex surgery|surgery]] to be recommended. This was especially likely if evidence suggested that response to additional testosterone and pubertal testosterone would be poor. If parents accepted, the boy would be reassigned and renamed as a girl, and surgery performed to remove the testes and construct an artificial [[vagina]]. This was based on three now questioned assumptions: 
#gender identity and sex differences were solely a matter of social learning rather than biology.
#a male with a penis too small to put into a vagina could not find a satisfactory social and sexual place in society.
#a functionally acceptable vagina could be constructed surgically.

[[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], the center most known for this approach, performed twelve such reassignments from 1960 to 1980, most notably{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} that of [[David Reimer]] (whose penis was destroyed by a circumcision accident), overseen by Dr. [[John Money]]. By the mid 1990s, reassignment was less often offered, and all three premises had been challenged. Former subjects of such surgery, vocal about their dissatisfaction with adult outcome, played a large part in discouraging this practice. Sexual reassignment is rarely performed today for severe micropenis (although the question of raising the boy as a girl is sometimes still discussed.)<ref name="pmid10228285">{{cite journal |author=Calikoglu AS |title=Should boys with micropenis be reared as girls? |journal=J.
