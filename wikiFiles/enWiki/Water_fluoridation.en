'''Water fluoridation''' is the controlled addition of [[fluoride]] to a [[water supply|public water supply]] to reduce [[tooth decay]].<!-- <ref name=FWRG/> --> Fluoridated water has fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride.<ref name=FRWG/>  Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth it creates low levels of fluoride in [[saliva]], which reduces the rate at which [[tooth enamel]] demineralizes and increases the rate at which it [[Remineralisation of teeth|remineralizes]] in the early stages of cavities.<ref name=Pizzo/> Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about ${{inflation|US|0.72|1999|r=2}} per person-year.<ref name=FRWG/>{{inflation-fn|US}} Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits.<ref name=Taricska/> A 1994 [[World Health Organization]] expert committee suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.0&nbsp;mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate.<ref name=WHO-TRS-846/> [[Bottled water]] typically has unknown fluoride levels, and some domestic [[water filter]]s remove some or all fluoride.<ref name=Hobson/>

[[Dental caries]] remain a major [[public health]] concern in most [[industrialized countries]], affecting 60–90% of schoolchildren and the vast majority of adults.<ref name=Petersen-2004/> Water fluoridation prevents cavities in both children and adults,<ref name=Parnell/> with studies estimating an 18–40% reduction in cavities when water fluoridation is used by children who already have access to toothpaste and other sources of fluoride.<ref name=FRWG/> Although water fluoridation can cause [[dental fluorosis]], which can alter the appearance of [[Tooth development|developing teeth]], most of this is mild and usually not considered to be of aesthetic or public-health concern.<ref name=NHMRC/> There is no clear evidence of other [[adverse effect]]s.<ref name=YorkReview2000/> Studies on adverse effects have been mostly of low quality.<ref name=YorkReview2000/> Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources. Drinking water is typically the largest source;<ref name=Fawell/> other methods of [[fluoride therapy]] include fluoridation of toothpaste, salt, and milk.<ref name=Jones-PH/> Water fluoridation, when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk.<ref name=Petersen-2004/> The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] listed water fluoridation as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century;<ref name=Ten-great/> in contrast, most European countries have experienced substantial declines in tooth decay without its use, primarily due to the introduction of fluoride toothpaste in the 1970s.<ref name=Pizzo/> The use of topical fluorides (such as in toothpaste) to prevent caries among people living in both industrialized and developing countries may help supplant the need for fluoridated water.<ref name=Pizzo/> Fluoridation may be more justified in the U.S. because of socioeconomic inequalities in dental health and [[Dentistry|dental care]].<ref name=Burt/>  Public water fluoridation was first practiced in the USA,<ref name=Sellers/> and has been introduced to many other countries to varying degrees<ref name=US-WF-Stats-2006/> with many countries having water that is naturally fluoridated to recommended levels and others, such as in Europe, using fluoridated salts as an alternative source of fluoride.<ref name=extent/>

== Mechanism ==
Fluoride exerts its major effect by interfering with the demineralization mechanism of tooth decay. Tooth decay is an [[infectious disease]], the key feature of which is an increase within [[dental plaque]] of bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus]]''. These produce organic acids when carbohydrates, especially sugar, are eaten.<ref name=Featherstone/> When enough acid is produced so that the [[pH]] goes below 5.5,<ref name=Cury/> the acid dissolves [[carbonate]]d [[hydroxyapatite]], the main component of tooth enamel, in a process known as ''demineralization''. After the sugar is gone, some of the mineral loss can be recovered—or ''[[Remineralisation of teeth|remineralized]]''—from ions dissolved in the saliva. Cavities result when the rate of demineralization exceeds the rate of remineralization, typically in a process that requires many months or years.<ref name=Featherstone/>

[[File:Enamel-fluoride-remineralization.svg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Carbonated hydroxyapatite enamel crystal is demineralized by acid in plaque and becomes partly dissolved crystal. This in turn is remineralized by fluoride in plaque to become fluorapatite-like coating on remineralized crystal|Demineralization and remineralization of dental enamel in the presence of acid and fluoride in saliva and plaque fluid.<ref name=Featherstone/>]]
All fluoridation methods, including water fluoridation, create low levels of fluoride ions in saliva and plaque fluid, thus exerting a [[topical]] or surface effect. A person living in an area with fluoridated water may experience rises of fluoride concentration in saliva to about 0.04&nbsp;mg/L several times during a day.<ref name=Pizzo>{{vcite journal |author=Pizzo G, Piscopo MR, Pizzo I, Giuliana G |title=Community water fluoridation and caries prevention: a critical review |journal=Clin Oral Investig |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |year=2007 |pmid=17333303 |doi=10.1007/s00784-007-0111-6 }}</ref> Technically, this fluoride does not prevent cavities but rather controls the rate at which they develop.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Aoba T, Fejerskov O |title=Dental fluorosis: chemistry and biology |journal=Crit Rev Oral Biol Med |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=155–70 |year=2002 |pmid=12097358 |doi=10.1177/154411130201300206 |url=http://cro.sagepub.com/cgi/content/full/13/2/155 }}</ref> When fluoride ions are present in plaque fluid along with dissolved hydroxyapatite, and the pH is higher than 4.5,<ref name=Cury>{{vcite journal |author=Cury JA, Tenuta LM |title=How to maintain a cariostatic fluoride concentration in the oral environment |journal=Adv Dent Res |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=13–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18694871 |doi=10.1177/154407370802000104 |url=http://adr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/full/20/1/13 }}</ref> a [[fluorapatite]]-like remineralized [[Veneer (dentistry)|veneer]] is formed over the remaining surface of the enamel; this veneer is much more acid-resistant than the original hydroxyapatite, and is formed more quickly than ordinary remineralized enamel would be.<ref name=Featherstone>{{vcite journal |author=Featherstone JD |title=Dental caries: a dynamic disease process |journal=Aust Dent J |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=286–91 |year=2008 |pmid=18782377 |doi=10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00064.x }}</ref> The cavity-prevention effect of fluoride is mostly due to these surface effects, which occur during and after [[tooth eruption]].<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Hellwig E, Lennon AM |title=Systemic versus topical fluoride |journal=Caries Res |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=258–62 |year=2004 |pmid=15153698 |doi=10.1159/000077764 |url=http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ArtikelNr=77764&Ausgabe=230047&ProduktNr=224219&filename=77764.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref> Although some systemic (whole-body) fluoride returns to the saliva via [[blood plasma]], and to unerupted teeth via plasma or crypt fluid, there is little data to determine what percentages of fluoride's anticavity effect comes from these systemic mechanisms.<ref>{{vcite book |editor=Berg JH, Slayton RL, editors |title=Early Childhood Oral Health |author=Tinanoff N |chapter=Uses of fluoride |pages=92–109 |isbn=978-0-8138-2416-1 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 }}</ref> Also, although fluoride affects the physiology of [[dental bacteria]],<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Koo H |title=Strategies to enhance the biological effects of fluoride on dental biofilms |journal=Adv Dent Res |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=17–21 |year=2008 |pmid=18694872 |doi=10.1177/154407370802000105 |url=http://adr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/full/20/1/17 }}</ref> its effect on [[bacterial growth]] does not seem to be relevant to cavity prevention.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Marquis RE, Clock SA, Mota-Meira M |title=Fluoride and organic weak acids as modulators of microbial physiology |journal=FEMS Microbiol Rev |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=493–510 |year=2003 |pmid=12586392 |doi=10.1016/S0168-6445(02)00143-2 }}</ref>

Fluoride's effects depend on the total daily intake of fluoride from all sources.<ref name=Fawell/> About 70–90% of [[ingested]] fluoride is [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorbed]] into the blood, where it distributes throughout the body. In infants 80–90% of absorbed fluoride is retained, with the rest [[excreted]], mostly via [[urine]]; in adults about 60% is retained. About 99% of retained fluoride is stored in bone, teeth, and other calcium-rich areas, where excess quantities can cause fluorosis.<ref name=Hhe/> Drinking water is typically the largest source of fluoride.<ref name=Fawell/> In many industrialized countries swallowed toothpaste is the main source of fluoride exposure in unfluoridated communities.<ref name=Sheiham/> Other sources include dental products other than toothpaste; air pollution from fluoride-containing [[coal]] or from phosphate fertilizers; [[trona]], used to tenderize meat in [[Tanzania]]; and tea leaves, particularly the [[tea brick]]s favored in parts of China. High fluoride levels have been found in other foods, including barley, cassava, corn, rice, taro, yams, and fish protein concentrate. The U.S. [[Institute of Medicine]] has established [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s for fluoride: Adequate Intake values range from 0.01&nbsp;mg/day for infants aged 6&nbsp;months or less, to 4&nbsp;mg/day for men aged 19&nbsp;years and up; and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level is 0.10&nbsp;mg/kg/day for infants and children through age 8&nbsp;years, and 10&nbsp;mg/day thereafter.<ref>{{vcite book |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride |author=Institute of Medicine |year=1997 |publisher=National Academy Press |isbn=0-309-06350-7 |chapter=Fluoride |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5776&page=288 |pages=288–313 }}</ref> A rough estimate is that an adult in a temperate climate consumes 0.6&nbsp;mg/day of fluoride without fluoridation, and 2&nbsp;mg/day with fluoridation. However, these values differ greatly among the world's regions: for example, in [[Sichuan, China]] the average daily fluoride intake is only 0.1&nbsp;mg/day in drinking water but 8.9&nbsp;mg/day in food and 0.7&nbsp;mg/day directly from the air due to the use of high-fluoride soft coal for cooking and drying foodstuffs indoors.<ref name=Fawell/>

Existing [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence]] strongly suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay.

Fluoride's adverse effects depend on total fluoride dosage from all sources.

In rare cases improper implementation of water fluoridation can result in overfluoridation that causes outbreaks of acute [[fluoride poisoning]], with symptoms that include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]].

The effectiveness of [[salt]] fluoridation is about the same as that of water fluoridation, if most salt for human consumption is fluoridated. Fluoridated salt reaches the consumer in salt at home, in meals at school and at large kitchens, and in bread. For example, Jamaica has just one salt producer, but a complex public water supply; it started fluoridating all salt in 1987, achieving a notable decline in cavities. Universal salt fluoridation is also practiced in Colombia and the Swiss [[Canton of Vaud]]; in France and Germany fluoridated salt is widely used in households but unfluoridated salt is also available, giving consumers choice about fluoride. Concentrations of fluoride in salt range from 90 to 350&nbsp;mg/kg, with studies suggesting an optimal concentration of around 250&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name=Jones-PH/>

[[Milk]] fluoridation is practiced by the Borrow Foundation in some parts of Bulgaria, Chile, Peru, Russia, Macedonia, Thailand and the UK.

The relationship between fluoride and teeth has been studied since the early 19th century. By 1850, investigators had established that fluoride occurs with varying concentrations in teeth, bone, and drinking water. By 1900, they had speculated that fluoride would protect against tooth decay, proposed supplementing the diet with fluoride, and observed mottled tooth enamel (now called dental fluorosis) without knowing the cause.<ref>{{vcite book |chapter=Fluorine and dental caries |author=Cox GJ |pages=325–414 |title=A Survey of the Literature of Dental Caries |editor=Toverud G, Finn SB, Cox GJ, Bodecker CF, Shaw JH, editors |publisher=National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council |location=Washington, DC |oclc=14681626 |year=1952 |id=Publication 225 }}</ref>

The history of water fluoridation can be divided into three periods. The first ({{circa|1901–1933}}) was research into the cause of a form of mottled tooth enamel called the Colorado brown stain. The second (c. 1933–1945) focused on the relationship between fluoride concentrations, fluorosis, and tooth decay, and established that moderate levels of fluoride prevent cavities. The third period, from 1945 on, focused on adding fluoride to community water supplies.<ref name=Ripa>{{vcite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1752-7325.1993.tb02666.x |author=Ripa LW |title=A half-century of community water fluoridation in the United States: review and commentary |journal=J Public Health Dent |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=17–44 |year=1993 |pmid=8474047 |url=http://aaphd.org/docs/position%20papers/A%20Half-Century%20of%20Community%20Water1993.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref>

The foundation of water fluoridation in the U.S. was the research of the dentist Frederick McKay. McKay spent thirty years investigating the cause of what was then known as the Colorado brown stain, which produced mottled but also cavity-free teeth; with the help of [[G.V. Black]] and other researchers, he established that the cause was fluoride.<ref>Colorado brown stain:

Fluoridation became an official policy of the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] by 1951, and by 1960 water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S., reaching about 50&nbsp;million people.<ref name=Lennon/> By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.<ref name=US-WF-Stats-2006>{{vcite web |author=Division of Oral Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC |title=Water fluoridation statistics for 2006 |url=http://cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/2006stats.htm |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2008-12-22 }}</ref> In some other countries the pattern was similar. New Zealand, which led the world in per-capita sugar consumption and had the world's worst teeth, began fluoridation in 1953, and by 1968 fluoridation was used by 65% of the population served by a piped water supply.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Akers HF |title=Collaboration, vision and reality: water fluoridation in New Zealand (1952–1968) |journal=N Z Dent J |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=127–33 |year=2008 |pmid=19180863 |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:159563/Akers_NZDJ_Dec_2008.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref> Fluoridation was introduced into Brazil in 1953, was regulated by federal law starting in 1974, and by 2004 was used by 71% of the population.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Buzalaf MA, de Almeida BS, Olympio KPK, da S Cardoso VE, de CS Peres SH |title=Enamel fluorosis prevalence after a 7-year interruption in water fluoridation in Jaú, São Paulo, Brazil |journal=J Public Health Dent |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=205–8 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-7325.2004.tb02754.x |pmid=15562942 }}</ref> In the Republic of Ireland, fluoridation was legislated in 1960, and after a constitutional challenge the two major cities of Dublin and Cork began it in 1964;<ref name=Mullen/> fluoridation became required for all sizeable public water systems and by 1996 reached 66% of the population.<ref name=extent/> In other locations, fluoridation was used and then discontinued: in [[Kuopio]], Finland, fluoridation was used for decades but was discontinued because the school dental service provided significant fluoride programs and the cavity risk was low, and in [[Basel]], Switzerland, it was replaced with fluoridated salt.<ref name=Mullen/>

McKay's work had established that fluorosis occurred before [[tooth eruption]]. Dean and his colleagues assumed that fluoride's protection against cavities was also pre-eruptive, and this incorrect assumption was accepted for years. By 2000, however, the topical effects of fluoride (in both water and toothpaste) were well understood, and it had become known that a constant low level of fluoride in the mouth works best to prevent cavities.<ref name=Burt/>
