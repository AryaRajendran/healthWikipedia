A '''contraction stress test''' (CST) is performed near the end of [[pregnancy]] to determine how well the [[fetus]] will cope with the [[contraction (childbirth)|contractions]] of [[childbirth]]. The aim is to induce contractions and monitor the [[fetus]] to check for [[heart rate]] abnormalities using a [[cardiotocography|cardiotocograph]].

==Principle==
During uterine contractions, fetal oxygenation is worsened. Late decelerations in [[fetal heart rate]] occurring during uterine contractions are associated with increased fetal death rate, [[IUGR|growth retardation]] and neonatal depression.<ref name=danforth>{{cite book|first=editors, Ronald S.

==Procedure==
CST is performed weekly,<ref name=danforth/> as the fetus is assumed to be healthy after a negative test and should remain so for another week.<ref>{{cite book|last=Munden|first=ed.: Julie|title=Professional guide to diagnostic tests|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781582553047|pages=682}}</ref>  This test is done in hospital or clinic setting.<ref name=fischbach/> External fetal monitors are placed. Either nipple stimulation or IV [[pitocin]] (oxytocin) is used to stimulate uterine contractions.

===Nipple Stimulation===
This is a procedure that relies on [[endogenous]] release of [[oxytocin]] following [[nipple]] stimulation, and is conducted by the patient.  The [[nurse]] instructs the patient on the procedure, as follows.  One nipple is massaged gently through clothing until a contraction begins, or for a maximum of 2 minutes. If at least 3 contractions in 10 minutes is not achieved, then the patient rests for 5 minutes and the other nipple is stimulated.<ref name="ACOG">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).

===Oxytocin Challenge Test (OCT)===
If adequate contractions (at least 3 in 10 minutes) cannot be achieved with nipple stimulation, an oxytocin challenge test may be performed. It involves the [[intravenous drip|intravenous]] administration of [[exogenous]] [[oxytocin]] to the pregnant woman. The target is to achieve around three contractions every ten minutes.<ref name="ACOG" /><ref name= "FHM" />

==Results & Efficacy==
The CST is used for its high [[negative predictive value]]. A negative result is highly predictive of fetal wellbeing and tolerance of labor. The test has a poor [[positive predictive value]] with false-positive results in as many as 30% of cases.<ref name="FHM" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lagrew DC|first=Jr|title=The contraction stress test.|journal=Clinical obstetrics and gynecology|date=1995 Mar|volume=38|issue=1|pages=11–25|pmid=7796539|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref> A positive CST indicates high risk of fetal death due to hypoxia<ref name=fischbach/> and is a contraindication to [[childbirth|labor]]. Patient's obstetricians usually consider operative delivery in such situations.<ref name=firstaid>{{cite book|first=Tao Le ...

==Contraindications==
This "stress test" is usually not performed if there are any signs of [[premature birth]], [[placenta praevia]], [[vasa praevia]], [[cervical incompetence]], [[multiple gestation]], previous classic [[caesarian section]].<ref name=danforth/>
Other contraindications include but are not limited to previous uterine incision with scarring, previous [[myomectomy]] entering the uterine cavity, and [[premature rupture of membranes|PROM]]. Any contraindication to labor is contraindication to CST.

==History==
The CST was the first antenatal surveillance test that was developed after the development of the [[cardiotocograph]].<ref name="FHM" />  The oxytocin challenge test was first described in 1972<ref name="pmid4637035">{{cite journal |author=Ray M, Freeman R, Pine S, Hesselgesser R |title=Clinical experience with the oxytocin challenge test |journal=Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=1972 |month=September |pmid=4637035 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and was standardised in 1975 when the parameters of contraction number and frequency were given.  

Historically, a CST was done after a non reactive [[nonstress test|NST]].  Today, a [[Biophysical profile|biophysical profile (BPP)]] is usually performed.
