The name ''Ebolavirus'' is derived from the [[Ebola River]] in  [[Zaire]] (where [[Ebola virus]] was first discovered) and the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[suffix]] ''-virus'' (denoting a viral genus).<ref name=KuhnArch/> The species in this genus are called ebolaviruses.<ref name=KuhnArch/> Currently includes five [[virus]] [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|species]] are recognised: ''[[Bundibugyo ebolavirus]]'', ''[[Reston ebolavirus]]'', ''[[Sudan ebolavirus]]'', ''[[Ta&iuml; Forest ebolavirus]]'' (originally Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus) and ''[[Zaire ebolavirus]]''.<ref name=KuhnArch/>

The ebolaviruses are responsible for [[hemorrhagic fever]].

==Taxonomy notes==

''Ebolavirus'' is pronounced iːˌboʊlə’vɑɪrəs ([[IPA]]) or ee-boh-luh-vahy-ruhs in English phonetic notation.<ref name=KuhnArch/>

According to the rules for taxon naming established by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV), the name ''Ebolavirus'' is always to be [[Capitalization|capitalized]], [[Italic type|italicized]], never abbreviated, and to be preceded by the word "genus". The names of its members (ebolaviruses) are to be written in lower case, are not italicized, and used without [[Article (grammar)|articles]].<ref name=KuhnArch/>

== Genus inclusion criteria ==
A virus of the family ''[[Filoviridae]]'' is a member of the genus ''Ebolavirus'' if<ref name=KuhnArch/>
* its genome has several gene overlaps
* its fourth gene (''GP'') encodes four proteins (sGP, ssGP, Δ-peptide, and GP<sub>1,2</sub>) using cotranscriptional editing to express ssGP and GP<sub>1,2</sub> and [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] cleavage to express sGP and Δ-peptide
* peak infectivity of its virions is associated with particles ≈805&nbsp;nm in length
* its genome differs from that of [[Marburg virus]] by ≥50% and from that of [[Ebola virus]] by <50% at the nucleotide level
* its virions show almost no antigenic cross reactivity with marburgvirions

The genera ''Ebolavirus'' and ''[[Marburgvirus]]'' were originally classified as the species of the now-obsolete ''Filovirus'' genus. In March, 1998, the Vertebrate Virus Subcommittee proposed in the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) to change the ''Filovirus'' genus to the ''Filoviridae'' family with two specific genera: ''Ebola-like viruses'' and ''Marburg-like viruses''. This proposal was implemented in Washington, D.C., as of April, 2001 and in Paris as of July, 2002. In 2000, another proposal was made in Washington, D.C., to change the "-like viruses" to "-virus" resulting in today's ''Ebolavirus'' and ''Marburgvirus''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/01.025.0.02.htm|title=ICTVdB Virus Description – 01.025.0.02.

The five characterised Ebola species are:
 
; Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) : Also known simply as the ''Zaire virus'', ZEBOV has the highest case-fatality rate, up to 90% in some epidemics, with an average case fatality rate of approximately 83% over 27 years. There have been more outbreaks of ''Zaire ebolavirus'' than of any other species. The first outbreak took place on 26 August 1976 in [[Yambuku]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Isaacson, M; Sureau, P; Courteille, G; Pattyn, SR;|title=Clinical Aspects of Ebola Virus Disease at the Ngaliema Hospital, Kinshasa, Zaire, 1976|url=http://www.itg.be/ebola/ebola-12.htm|accessdate=2009-07-08|ref=harv}}</ref> Mabalo Lokela, a 44‑year-old schoolteacher, became the first recorded case. The symptoms resembled [[malaria]], and subsequent patients received [[quinine]]. Transmission has been attributed to reuse of unsterilized needles and close personal contact.
 
; Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) : Like the ''Zaire virus'', SEBOV emerged in 1976; it was at first assumed to be identical with the Zaire species.<ref name=Lancet2011>{{cite pmid|21084112|noedit}}</ref> SEBOV is believed to have broken out first amongst cotton factory workers in Nzara, [[Sudan]], with the first case reported as a worker exposed to a potential natural reservoir. Scientists tested local animals and insects in response to this; however, none tested positive for the virus. The carrier is still unknown. The lack of [[Universal precautions#Additional precautions|barrier nursing]] (or "bedside isolation") facilitated the spread of the disease. The most recent outbreak occurred in May, 2004. Twenty confirmed cases were reported in Yambio County, Sudan, with five deaths resulting. The average fatality rates for SEBOV were 54% in 1976, 68% in 1979, and 53% in 2000 and 2001.
 
; Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) : This virus was discovered during an outbreak of [[simian hemorrhagic fever virus]] (SHFV) in [[Crab-eating Macaque|crab-eating macaques]] from [[Covance|Hazleton Laboratories]] (now Covance) in 1989. Since the initial outbreak in [[Reston, Virginia]], it has since been found in nonhuman primates in Pennsylvania, Texas and [[Siena]], [[Italy]]. In each case, the affected animals had been imported from a facility in the Philippines,<ref name="KnownCasesCDC">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/ebola/ebolatable.htm|title=Known Cases and Outbreaks of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever|accessdate=2008-08-02|author=Special Pathogens Branch CDC|date=2008-01-14|publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> where the virus has also infected pigs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/health/24ebola.html|title=Pig-to-Human Ebola Case Suspected in Philippines|accessdate=2009-01-26|date=2009-01-24|publisher=New York Times | first=Donald G. | last=McNeil Jr}}</ref> Despite its status as a [[Biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|Level‑4]] organism and its apparent [[pathogen]]icity in monkeys, REBOV did not cause disease in exposed human laboratory workers.<ref>{{harvnb|McCormick|Fisher-Hoch|1999|p=300}}</ref>
 
; Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV): Also referred to as ''Tai ebolavirus'' and by the English place name, "Ivory Coast", it was first discovered among [[chimpanzee]]s from the [[Taï National Park|Tai Forest]] in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Africa]], in 1994. [[Necropsies]] showed blood within the heart to be brown; no obvious marks were seen on the organs; and one necropsy displayed lungs filled with blood. Studies of tissues taken from the chimpanzees showed results similar to human cases during the 1976 Ebola outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan. As more dead chimpanzees were discovered, many tested positive for Ebola using molecular techniques. The source of the virus was believed to be the meat of infected western red colobus monkeys (''[[Procolobus badius]]'') upon which the chimpanzees preyed. One of the scientists performing the necropsies on the infected chimpanzees contracted Ebola. She developed symptoms similar to those of [[dengue fever]] approximately a week after the necropsy, and was transported to Switzerland for treatment. She was discharged from hospital after two weeks and had fully recovered six weeks after the infection.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Waterman|first=Tara|title=Ebola Cote D'Ivoire Outbreaks|url=http://virus.stanford.edu/filo/eboci.html|accessdate=2009-05-30|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University}}</ref>
 
; Bundibugyo ebolavirus: On November 24, 2007, the Uganda Ministry of Health confirmed an outbreak of Ebola in the [[Bundibugyo District]]. After confirmation of samples tested by the United States National Reference Laboratories and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], the [[World Health Organization]] confirmed the presence of the new species. On 20 February 2008, the Uganda Ministry officially announced the end of the epidemic in Bundibugyo, with the last infected person discharged on 8 January 2008.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=End of Ebola outbreak in Uganda|publisher=World Health Organization|date=2008-02-20|url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/2007_02_20b/en/index.html}}</ref> An epidemiological study conducted by WHO and Uganda Ministry of Health scientists determined there were 116 confirmed and probable cases the new Ebola species, and that the outbreak had a mortality rate of 34% (39 deaths).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wamala, J; Lukwago, L; Malimbo, M; Nguku, P; Yoti, Z; Musenero, M; Amone, J; Mbabazi, W; Nanyunja, M; Zaramba, S; Opio, A; Lutwama, J; Talisuna, A; Okware, I;|title=Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Associated with Novel Virus Strain, Uganda, 2007–2008 | year = 2010 | journal = Emerging Infectious Disease | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/7/1087.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-24|ref=harv }}</ref>

==Evolution==
Rates of genetic change are one one-hundredth as fast as [[influenza A]] in humans, but on the same magnitude as those of [[hepatitis B]]. [[Molecular clock|Extrapolating backwards]] using these rates indicates Ebolavirus and [[Marburgvirus]] diverged several thousand years ago.<ref>{{cite pmid|9254917|noedit}}</ref> However, [[paleovirus]]es (genomic fossils) of [[filovirus]]es (Filoviridae) found in mammals indicate that the family itself is at least tens of millions of years old.<ref name="Cite pmid| 20569424">{{cite pmid|20569424|noedit}}</ref>
