[[File:Laproscopic Surgery Robot.jpg|thumb|A robotically assisted surgical system used for prostatectomies, cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures]]
'''Robotic surgery''', [[computer-assisted surgery]], and robotically-assisted surgery are terms for technological developments that use robotic systems to aid in [[surgery|surgical procedures]]. Robotically-assisted surgery was developed to overcome the limitations of minimally-invasive surgery and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery. 

In the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of directly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of five methods to control the instruments; either a direct [[Remote manipulator|telemanipulator]] or through computer control.  A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery whilst the [[robotic arm]]s carry out those movements using [[robot end effector|end-effector]]s and [[manipulator]]s to perform the actual surgery on the patient. In computer-controlled systems the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, but can be anywhere in the world, leading to the possibility for [[remote surgery]].  

In the case of enhanced open surgery, autonomous instruments (in familiar configurations) replace traditional steel tools, performing certain actions (such as rib spreading) with much smoother, feedback-controlled motions than could be achieved by a human hand.  The main object of such smart instruments is to reduce or eliminate the tissue trauma traditionally associated with open surgery without requiring more than a few minutes' training on the part of surgeons.  This approach seeks to improve open surgeries, particularly cardio-thoracic, that have so far not benefited from minimally-invasive techniques.

==History==
In 1985 a robot, the [[PUMA 560]], was used to place a needle for a brain biopsy using CT guidance.<ref>Kwoh, Y. S., Hou, J., Jonckheere, E. A. and Hayall, S. A robot with improved absolute positioning accuracy for CT guided stereotactic brain surgery. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Engng, February 1988, 35(2), 153–161.</ref> In 1988, the MROBOT, developed at [[Imperial College London]], was used to perform prostatic surgery by Dr. Senthil Nathan at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, London. The ROBODOC from Integrated Surgical Systems (working closely with [[IBM]]) was introduced in 1992 to mill out precise fittings in the [[femur]] for hip replacement <ref>[http://www.robot.md/publications/robodoc-surgical-robot-sucess-story.pdf|ROBODOC: Surgical Robot Success Story]</ref>. The purpose of the ROBODOC was to replace the previous method of carving out a femur for an implant, the use of a mallet and broach/rasp. Further development of robotic systems was carried out by [[Intuitive Surgical]] with the introduction of the [[da Vinci Surgical System]] and [[Computer Motion]] with the ''AESOP'' and the [[ZEUS robotic surgical system]]. (Intuitive Surgical bought Computer Motion in 2003; ZEUS is no longer being actively marketed.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2005/405_computer.html FDA: Computer-Assisted Surgery: An Update]</ref>)

The da Vinci Surgical System comprises three components: a surgeon’s console, a patient-side robotic cart with 4 arms manipulated by the surgeon (one to control the camera and three to manipulate instruments), and a high-definition 3D vision system. Articulating surgical instruments are mounted on the robotic arms which are introduced into the body through [[cannula]]s. The original telesurgery robotic system that the da Vinci was based on was developed at SRI International in Menlo Park with grant support from DARPA and NASA. Although the telesurgical robot was originally intended to facilitate remotely performed surgery in battlefield and other remote environments, it turned out to be more useful for minimally invasive on-site surgery. The patents for the early prototype were sold to Intuitive Surgical in Mountain View, California.

The da Vinci senses the surgeon’s hand movements and translates them electronically into scaled-down micro-movements to manipulate the tiny proprietary instruments. It also detects and filters out any tremors in the surgeon's hand movements, so that they are not duplicated robotically. The camera used in the system provides a true stereoscopic picture transmitted to a surgeon's console. The da Vinci System is [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] cleared for a variety of surgical procedures including surgery for prostate cancer, hysterectomy and mitral valve repair, and is used in more than 800 hospitals in the Americas and Europe. The da Vinci System was used in 48,000 procedures in 2006 and sells for about $1.2 million.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The new da Vinci HD SI released in April, 2009 currently sells for $1.75 million. The first robotic surgery took place at [[The Ohio State University Medical Center]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] under the direction of Dr. Robert E. Michler, Professor and Chief, Cardiothoracic Surgery.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McConnell|first1=PI|last2=Schneeberger|first2=EW|last3=Michler|first3=RE|year=2003|title=History and development of robotic cardiac surgery|journal=Problems in General Surgery|volume=20|issue=2|pages=20–30|doi=10.1097/01.sgs.0000081182.03671.6e}}</ref>

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
{{procon|date=November 2012}}

Major advances aided by surgical robots have been [[remote surgery]], [[minimally invasive surgery]] and unmanned surgery. Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions, decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. Articulation beyond normal manipulation and three-dimensional magnification helps resulting in improved ergonomics. Due to these techniques there is a reduced duration of hospital stays, blood loss, transfusions, and use of pain medication.<ref name=Estey>{{cite journal|last=Estey|first=EP|year=2009|title=Robotic prostatectomy: The new standard of care or a marketing success?|journal=Canadian Urological Association Journal|volume=3|issue=6|pages=488–90|pmc=2792423|accessdate =25 June 2010|pmid=20019980}}</ref>

The robot normally costs $1,390,000 and while its disposable supply cost is normally $1,500 per procedure, the cost of the procedure is higher.<ref name=kolata/> Additional surgical training is needed to operate the system.<ref name=ORPvsRALRP/> Numerous feasibility studies have been done to determine whether the purchase of such systems are worthwhile. As it stands, opinions differ dramatically. Surgeons report that, although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology, the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must operate on twelve to eighteen patients before they adapt. Moreover during the training phase, minimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery, leading to operating room tie ups and surgical staffs keeping patients under anesthesia for longer periods. Patient surveys indicate they chose the procedure based on expectations of decreased morbidity, improved outcomes, reduced blood loss and less pain.<ref name=Estey/> Higher expectations may explain higher rates of dissatisfaction and regret.<ref name=ORPvsRALRP/>

Advantages of this technique are that the incisions are small and patient recovery is quick. In traditional open-heart surgery, the surgeon makes a ten to twelve-inch incision, then gains access to the heart by splitting the [[sternum]] (breast bone) and spreading open the [[rib cage]]. The patient is then placed on a [[heart-lung machine]] and the heart is stopped for a period of time during the operation. This approach can be associated with postoperative infection and pain, and prolonged time to complete recovery. Because patient recovery after robot-assisted heart surgery is quicker, the hospital stay is shorter. On average patients leave the hospital two to five days earlier than patients who have undergone traditional open-heart surgery and return to work and normal activity 50% more quickly.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Reduced recovery times are not only better for the patient, they also reduce the number of staff needed during surgery, nursing care required after surgery, and, therefore, the overall cost of hospital stays.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Compared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches, robot-assisted surgery gives the surgeon better control over the surgical instruments and a better view of the surgical site. In addition, surgeons no longer have to stand throughout the surgery and do not tire as quickly. Naturally occurring hand tremors are filtered out by the robot’s computer software. Finally, the surgical robot can continuously be used by rotating surgery teams.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gerhardus|first1=D|year=2003|title=Robot-assisted surgery: the future is here|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12908224|journal=Journal of Healthcare Management|volume=48|issue=4|pages=242–251|pmid=12908224}}</ref> 

Critics of the system say there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system and that there's a lack of studies that indicate long-term results are superior to results following traditional laparoscopic surgery.<ref name=kolata>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/health/14robot.html| title=Results Unproven, Robotic Surgery Wins Converts |author=Gina Kolata |work=The New York Times |date=13 February 2010 | accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref> Articles in the newly created ''[[Journal of Robotic Surgery]]'' tend to report on one surgeon’s experience.<ref name=kolata/>

A Medicare study found that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to "minimally invasive" endoscopic procedures with the use of the Da Vinci, shortening length-of-stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times.  But because of the hefty cost of the robotic system it is not clear that it is cost-effective for hospitals and physicians despite any benefits to patients since there is no additional reimbursement paid by the government or insurance companies when the system is used.<ref name=kolata/>

==Applications==

===General surgery===
In early 2000 the field of general surgical interventions with the daVinci device was explored by surgeons at Ohio State University. Reports were published in esophageal and pancreatic surgery for the first time in the world and further data was subsequently published by Horgan and his group at the University of Illinois and then later at the same institution by others.<ref>Melvin WS, Krause KR, Needleman BJ, Ellison EC. “Robotic” Resection of A Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor. Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques 13(1):33–36, 2003.</ref><ref name="Talamini M 1524">Talamini M, Chapman WC, Horgan S, Melvin WS. Evaluation of 211 “Robotic” Surgical Procedures. Surgical Endoscopy, 2003; 17: 1521–1524.</ref> In 2007, the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] medical team, led by [[Prof. Pier Cristoforo Giulianotti]], reported a [[pancreatectomy]] and also the Midwest's first fully robotic [[Pancreaticoduodenectomy|Whipple surgery]]. In April 2008, the same team of surgeons performed the world's first fully minimally invasive [[liver]] resection for [[Living donor liver transplantation|living donor transplantation]], removing 60% of the patient's liver, yet allowing him to leave the hospital just a couple of days after the procedure, in very good condition. Furthermore the patient can also leave with less pain than a usual surgery due to the four puncture holes and not a scar by a surgeon.<ref>Ahmed K; Khan MS; Vats A; Nagpal K; Priest O; Patel V; Vecht JA; Ashrafian H; et al. (Oct 2009). Current status of robotic assisted pelvic surgery and future developments. Int J Surg. 7:431–440 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19735746?dopt=Abstract]</ref>

===Cardiothoracic surgery===
Robot-assisted [[MIDCAB]] and [[TECAB|Endoscopic coronary artery bypass]] (TECAB) operations are being performed with the da Vinci system. [[Mitral valve]] repairs and replacements have been performed. East Carolina University, Greenville (Dr [[W. Randolph Chitwood]]), Saint Joseph's Hospital, Atlanta (Dr [[Douglas A. Murphy]]), and Good Samaritan Hospital, Cincinnati (Dr [[J. Michael Smith]]) have popularized this procedure and proved its durability with multiple publications. Since the first robotic cardiac procedure performed in the USA in 1999, The Ohio State University, Columbus (Dr. [[Robert E. Michler]], Dr. [[Juan Crestanello]], Dr. [[Paul Vesco]]) has performed [[CABG]], [[mitral valve]], [[esophagectomy]], [[lung]] resection, tumor resections, among other robotic assisted procedures and serves as a training site for other surgeons. In 2002, surgeons at the [[Cleveland Clinic]] in Florida (Dr. Douglas Boyd and Kenneth Stahl) reported and published their preliminary experience with minimally invasive "hybrid" procedures. These procedures combined robotic [[revascularization]] and [[coronary stenting]] and further expanded the role of robots in [[coronary bypass]] to patients with disease in multiple vessels. Ongoing research on the outcomes of robotic assisted CABG and hybrid CABG is being done by Dr. [[Robert Poston]].

===Cardiology and electrophysiology===
The [[Stereotaxis]] Magnetic Navigation System (MNS) has been developed to increase precision and safety in ablation procedures for [[arrhythmia]]s and [[atrial fibrillation]] while reducing radiation exposure for the patient and physician, and the system utilizes two [[magnet]]s to remotely steerable catheters. The system allows for automated [[3-D mapping of the heart]] and vasculature, and MNS has also been used in [[interventional cardiology]] for guiding [[stent]]s and leads in PCI and CTO procedures, proven to reduce [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] usage and access tortuous anatomy unreachable by manual navigation. Dr. Andrea Natale has referred to the new Stereotaxis procedures with the magnetic irrigated catheters as "revolutionary."<ref>TCAI Press Release, 3 March 2009: http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/03-03-2009/0004982135&EDATE</ref>

The [[Hansen Medical]] [[Sensei robotic catheter system]] uses a remotely operated system of [[pulley]]s to navigate a steerable sheath for [[catheter]] guidance. It allows precise and more forceful positioning of catheters used for 3-D mapping of the heart and vasculature. The system provides doctors with estimated [[force feedback]] information and feasible manipulation within the left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]] of the heart. The Sensei has been associated with mixed acute success rates compared to manual, commensurate with higher procedural complications, longer procedure times but lower [[fluoroscopy]] dosage to the patient.<ref>Natale et al., Lessons Learned and Techniques Altered Following Early Experience of the Hansen Robotic System During Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation, Poster Session II, HRS 2008</ref><ref>Barnebei et al., Lahey Clinic, presented at HRS 2009: PO04-35 – Robotic versus Manual Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation</ref><ref>R. Liew, L. Richmond, V. Baker, F. Goromonzi, G. Thomas, M. Finlay, M. Dhinoja, M. Earley, S. Sporton, R. Schilling, National Heart Centre – Singapore – Singapore, Barts and the London NHS Trust – London – United Kingdom European Heart Journal ( 2009 ) 30 ( Abstract Supplement ), 910</ref>

At present, three types of heart surgery are being performed on a routine basis using robotic surgery systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kypson|first1=Alan P|last2=Chitwood Jr|first2=W. Randolph|year=2004|title=Robotic Applications in Cardiac Surgery|journal=International Journal of Advanced Robotic Systems|volume=1|issue=2|pages=87–92|arxiv=cs/0412055}}</ref> These three surgery types are:

*Atrial septal defect repair – the repair of a hole between the two upper chambers of the heart,
*Mitral valve repair – the repair of the valve that prevents blood from regurgitating back into the upper heart chambers during contractions of the heart,
*Coronary artery bypass – rerouting of blood supply by bypassing blocked arteries that provide blood to the heart.

As surgical experience and robotic technology develop, it is expected that the applications of robots in cardiovascular surgery will expand.

===Gastrointestinal surgery===
Multiple types of procedures have been performed with either the 'Zeus' or [[Da Vinci Surgical System|da Vinci]] robot systems, including [[bariatric surgery]]. Surgeons at various universities initially published case series demonstrating different techniques and the feasibility of GI surgery using the robotic devices.<ref name="Talamini M 1524"/> Specific procedures have been more fully evaluated, specifically esophageal fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux<ref>Melvin WS, Needleman BJ, Krause KR, Schneider C, Ellison EC. Computer–Enhanced versus Standard Laparoscopic Antireflux Surgery. Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery 6(1): 11–16. 2002</ref> and Heller myotomy for the treatment of achalasia.<ref>Melvin WS, Dundon JM, Talamini MA, Horgan S. Computer Enhanced Robotic Telesurgery Reduces Esophageal Perforation During Heller Myotomy. Surgery. 2005 Oct;138(4):553-8; discussion 558-9.</ref>

Other gastrointestinal procedures including colon resection, pancreatectomy, esophagectomy and robotic approaches to pelvic disease have also been reported.

===Gynecology===
Robotic surgery in [[gynecology]] is one of the fastest growing fields of robotic surgery. This includes the use of the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and gynecologic [[oncology]]. Robotic surgery can be used to treat [[fibroids]], abnormal periods, [[endometriosis]], [[ovarian tumor]]s, [[pelvic prolapse]], and female cancers. Using the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies, myomectomies, and lymph node biopsies. The need for large abdominal incisions is virtually eliminated.

Robot assisted [[hysterectomies]] and [[cancer staging]] are being performed using da Vinci robotic system. The [[University of Tennessee]], [[Memphis]] (Dr. T. Tillmanns, Dr. Saurabh Kumar), [[Northwestern University]] (Dr. Patrick Lowe), Aurora Health Center (Dr. Scott Kamelle), [[West Virginia University]] (Dr. Jay Bringman) and The University of Tennessee, [[Chattanooga]] (Dr. Donald Chamberlain) have extensively studied the use of robotic surgery and found it to improve [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] of patients with [[gynecologic cancer]]s. They have also for the first time reported robotic surgery learning curves for current and new users as a method to assess acquisition of their skills using the device. Dr.'s Joseph Prezzato and Burton Brodsky have utilized this equipment for gynecological procedures in Southeastern Michigan.

===Neurosurgery===
Several systems for [[stereotactic surgery|stereotactic intervention]] are currently on the market. The NeuroMate was the first neurosurgical robot, commercially available in 1997.<ref>http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2005_Groups/04/neurology.html</ref> Originally developed in Grenoble by Alim-Louis_Benabid’s team, it is now owned by [[Renishaw plc|Renishaw]]. With installations in the United States, Europe and Japan, the system has been used in 8000 stereotactic brain surgeries by 2009. IMRIS Inc.'s SYMBIS(TM) Surgical System<ref>{{cite web|title=SYMBIS Homepage on IMRIS Website|url=http://www.imris.com/product/symbis-surgical-system}}</ref> will be the version of [[NeuroArm]], the world’s first [[MRI]]-compatible surgical robot, developed for world-wide commercialization. Medtech's Rosa is being used by several institutions, including the Cleveland Clinic in the U.S, and in Canada at Sherbrooke University and the [[Montreal Neurological Institute|Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital]] in Montreal (MNI/H). Between June 2011 and September 2012, over 150 neurosurgical procedures at the MNI/H have been completed robotized stereotaxy, including in the placement of depth electrodes in the treatment of epilepsy, selective resections, and stereotaxic biopsies.

===Orthopedics===
The [[ROBODOC]] system was released in 1992 by [[Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc.]] which merged into [[CUREXO Technology Corporation]].<ref>[http://www.robodoc.com/about.html ROBODOC history]. Robodoc.com. Retrieved 29 November 2011.</ref> Also, The [[Acrobot Company Ltd.]] sells the "[[Acrobot Sculptor]]", a robot that constrains a [[bone]] cutting tool to a pre-defined volume.<ref>[http://www.acrobot.co.uk/Sculptor.html Acrobot Sculptor]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> Another example is the CASPAR robot produced by U.R.S.-Ortho GmbH & Co. KG, which is used for [[Hip replacement|total hip replacement]], [[Knee replacement|total knee replacement]] and [[anterior cruciate ligament]] reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book|chapter = Chapter 12 – Total knee replacement: robotic assistive technique|first1 = W.|last1 = Siebert|first2 = Sabine|last2 = Mai|first3 = Rudolf|last3 = Kober|first4 = Peter F.|last4 = Heeckt|title = Computer and robotic assisted hip and knee surgery|editor1-first = Anthony M.|editor1-last = DiGioia|editor2-first = Branislav|editor2-last = Jaramaz|editor3-first = Frederic|editor3-last = Picard|editor4-first = Lutz-Peter|editor4-last = Nolte|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|date = 30 December 2004|isbn = 0-19-850943-X|pages = 127–156}}</ref> Also, MAKO Surgical Corp (founded 2004) produces the RIO (Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopedic System) which combines robotics, navigation, and haptics for both partial knee and total hip replacement surgery.<ref>[http://www.makosurgical.com]</ref>

===Pediatrics===
Surgical robotics has been used in many types of pediatric surgical procedures including: [[tracheoesophageal fistula]] repair, [[cholecystectomy]], [[nissen fundoplication]], [[morgagni's hernia]] repair, [[kasai portoenterostomy]], [[congenital diaphragmatic hernia]] repair, and others. On 17 January 2002, surgeons at [[Children's Hospital of Michigan]] in Detroit performed the nation's first advanced computer-assisted robot-enhanced surgical procedure at a children's hospital.

The Center for Robotic Surgery at [[Children's Hospital Boston]] provides a high level of expertise in pediatric robotic surgery. Specially-trained surgeons use a high-tech robot to perform complex and delicate operations through very small surgical openings. The results are less pain, faster recoveries, shorter hospital stays, smaller scars, and happier patients and families.

In 2001, Children's Hospital Boston was the first [[pediatrics|pediatric]] hospital to acquire a surgical robot. Today, surgeons use the technology for many procedures and perform more pediatric robotic operations than any other hospital in the world. Children's Hospital physicians have developed a number of new applications to expand the use of the robot, and train surgeons from around the world on its use.<ref>[http://www.childrenshospital.org/robotics Children's Hospital Center for Robotic Surgery]. Childrenshospital.org. Retrieved 29 November 2011.</ref>

===Radiosurgery===
The [[CyberKnife]] Robotic [[Radiosurgery]] System uses image guidance and computer controlled robotics to treat tumors throughout the body by delivering multiple beams of high-energy radiation to the tumor from virtually any direction. The system uses a German [[KUKA]] KR 240. Mounted on the robot is a compact X-band [[linac]] that produces 6MV X-ray radiation. Mounting the radiation source on the robot allows very fast repositioning of the source, which enables the system to deliver radiation from many different directions without the need to move both the patient and source as required by current gantry configurations.

===Urology===
Robotic surgery in the field of urology has become very popular, especially in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lee | first1 = DI. | title = Robotic prostatectomy: what we have learned and where we are going. | journal = Yonsei Med J | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 177–81 | month = Apr | year = 2009 | doi = 10.3349/ymj.2009.50.2.177 | PMID = 19430547 }}</ref> It has been most extensively applied for excision of prostate cancer because of difficult anatomical access.

In 2000, the first robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed.<ref name=ORPvsRALRP>{{cite journal|author=Finkelstein J|coauthors=Eckersberger E, Sadri H, Taneja SS, Lepor H, Djavan B|year=2010|title=Open Versus Laparoscopic Versus Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy: The European and US Experience|journal=Reviews in Urology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=35–43|pmc=2859140|pmid=20428292}}</ref>

Surgeons at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine]] were the first to offer robotic kidney transplantation to morbidly obese patients- having BMIs ([[body mass index]]es) over 50- and since 2009, have done 13 procedures (100 percent patient and graft survival with no complications). They report fewer complications among this high-risk population (wound infections go from 15 percent in open surgery to 0 percent, pulmonary complications decrease to 0 percent from 9 percent, length of hospitalization is reduced from 8.5 days to 5 days). Most Illinois transplant centers do not take anyone for renal transplant with a BMI of over 40- and so those patients have no other access to kidney transplantation and experience high mortality rates while on dialysis, which becomes their only other available therapy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In March 2011, the President of Slovenia [[Danilo Türk]] underwent robot-assisted prostate cancer treatment at the [[Urology Institute, Innsbruck|Urology Institute]] in [[Innsbruck]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?id=1621924|title=President Has Prostate Tumour Removed|date=31 March 2011|publisher=Slovenian Press Agency}}</ref>

===Vascular surgery===
In September 2010, the first robotic operations with [[Hansen Medical]]'s Mgellan Robotic System at the [[femoral vasculature]] were performed at the [[University Medical Centre Ljubljana]] (UMC Ljubljana), [[Slovenia]]. The research was led by [[Borut Geršak]], the head of the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the centre. Geršak explained that the robot used was the first true robot in the history of robotic surgery, meaning the user interface was not resembling surgical instruments and the robot was not simply imitating the movement of human hands but was guided by pressing buttons, just like one would play a video game. The robot was imported to Slovenia from the United States.<ref name="FV_robo1">{{cite news|url=http://med.over.net/index.php?full=1&id=25545&title=V_UKC_Ljubljana_prvi___na_svetu_uporabili___ilnega_robota_za_posege_na_femoralnem___ilju|title=V UKC Ljubljana prvič na svetu uporabili žilnega robota za posege na femoralnem žilju|language=Slovene|trans_title=The First Use of a Vascular Robot for Procedures on Femoral Vasculature|date=8 November 2010|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref><ref name="FV_robo2">{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/zdravje/1042434634|title=UKC Ljubljana kljub finančnim omejitvam uspešen v razvoju medicine|language=Slovene|trans_title=UMC Ljubljana Successfully Develops Medicine Despite Financial Limitations|date=30 March 2011}}</ref>

==Miniature robotics==
As scientists seek to improve the versatility and utility of robotics in surgery, some are attempting to miniaturize the robots. For example, the [[University of Nebraska Medical Center]] has led a multi-campus effort to provide collaborative research on [[mini-robotics]] among surgeons, engineers and computer scientists.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18925366.400 New Scientist Magazine, January 2006].
