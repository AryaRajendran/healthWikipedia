- This page serves two purposes:
- (1) It is the main page for describing the medical subluxation. As such that section may be enlarged.
- (2) It also provides cross-references to other usages which have their own articles.
- Those sections should not be enlarged. If other examples of usage occur, they can be added in a new section.

== Orthopedics ==

An [[orthopedic]] subluxation of any joint will usually need medical attention to help relocate or reduce the joint. [[Nursemaid's elbow]] is the subluxation of the head of the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] from the [[annular ligament]] (correctly 'anular'). Other joints that are prone to subluxations are the [[shoulder]]s, [[finger]]s, [[patella|kneecaps]], and hips affected by [[hip dysplasia (human)|hip dysplasia]]. A spinal subluxation is relatively rare, but can sometimes impinge on [[spinal nerve]] roots, causing symptoms in the areas served by those roots. In the spine, such a displacement may be caused by a [[fracture]], [[spondylolisthesis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]],<ref>{{cite web

== Ophthalmology ==

An [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] subluxation is called '''[[ectopia lentis]]''', an ocular condition characterized by a displaced or malpositioned [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] within the [[Human eye|eye]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Subluxated lenses are frequently found in those who have had ocular trauma and those with certain systemic disorders, such as [[Marfan syndrome]], [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]], [[Loeys-Dietz syndrome]] and [[homocystinuria]]. Some subluxated lenses may require removal, as in the case of those that float freely or those that have opacified to form [[cataract]]s.

{{Main|Dental subluxation}}

A [[dentistry|dental]] subluxation is a [[dental trauma|traumatic]] injury in which the [[tooth]] has increased mobility but has not been displaced from the [[mandible]] or [[maxilla]]. This is a common condition and one of the most common dental traumatic disorders.<ref name="DentSL">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Levin L |title=Oral and facial trauma among paratroopers in the Israel Defense Forces |journal=Dent Traumatol |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=100–102 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19208020 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00719.x}}</ref> Dental subluxation is a non-dental-urgency condition, i.e., unlikely to result in signiﬁcant morbidity if not seen within 24 hours by a [[dentist]],<ref name="AlDT">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y |title=Algorithm of first-aid management of dental trauma for medics and corpsmen |journal=Dent Traumatol |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=698–701 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19021668 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00649.x}}</ref> and usually treated conservatively; good [[oral hygiene]] with 0.12% [[chlorhexidine gluconate]] [[mouthwash]], a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of [[smoking]] for several days.<ref name="AlDT"/> In [[toothache|painful]] situations, a temporary [[dental splint|splinting]] of the injured teeth may relieve the [[pain]].<ref name="GuideDT">{{cite journal |author= Flores MT, Andersson L, Andreasen JO, et al.
