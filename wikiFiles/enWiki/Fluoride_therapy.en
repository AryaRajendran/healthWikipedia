'''Fluoride therapy''' is the delivery of [[fluoride]] to the [[teeth]] [[topically]] or systemically in order to prevent [[tooth decay]] ([[dental caries]]) which results in cavities. Most commonly, fluoride is applied [[topically]] to the teeth using gels, varnishes, [[toothpaste]]/[[toothpaste|dentifrices]] or [[Mouthwash|mouth rinse]]. Systemic delivery involves fluoride supplementation using water, salt, [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] or drops which are swallowed. Tablets or drops are rarely used where public water supplies are [[water fluoridation|fluoridated]].

== Benefits ==
Fluoridation is widely, but not universally, accepted by dentists and other medical professionals as being useful in preventing tooth decay.<ref name=ADA>{{cite web |title=ADA.org:A-Z Topics: Fluoride and Fluoridation  |url=http://www.ada.org/sections/newsAndEvents/pdfs/fluoridation_facts.pdf |date= |work= |publisher=American Dental Association |accessdate=}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  The U.S. Center for Disease Control lists water fluoridation as one of the "ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century."<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm</ref>  It is therefore understandable that fluoride therapy would be commonly practiced and in many modalities. Many types of fluoride therapies are known, ranging from use of fluoridated toothpaste at-home to professionally administered topical fluorides provided by dental offices,<ref name=ADA/> to publicly sponsored [[fluoridation of water]] or other commonly ingested materials such as salt.  At-home therapies can be further divided into over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription strengths.  The fluoride therapies, whether OTC or PATF, are categorized by application – dentifrices, mouth rinses, gels/foams, varnishes, dietary fluoride supplements, and water fluoridation.

== Mechanism ==
All fluoridation methods provide low concentrations of fluoride ions in saliva, thus exerting a [[topical]] effect on the [[Dental plaque|plaque]] fluid.<ref name=ADA/> Fluoride combats the decay primarily by the formation of [[fluorapatite]] via remineralization of enamel.  The fluoride ions reduce the rate of tooth enamel demineralization and increase the rate of [[Remineralisation of teeth|remineralization]] of the early stages of cavities.<ref name=Pizzo>{{cite journal |author= Pizzo G, Piscopo MR, Pizzo I, Giuliana G |title= Community water fluoridation and caries prevention: a critical review |journal= Clin Oral Investig |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |year=2007 |pmid=17333303 |doi=10.1007/s00784-007-0111-6}}</ref> Fluoride exerts its major effect by this demineralization and remineralization cycle.

=== Water fluoridation ===
{{Main|Water fluoridation}}

Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a [[public water supply]] in order to reduce tooth decay.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Recommendations for using fluoride to prevent and control dental caries in the United States |author= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |journal= MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=50 |issue=RR-14 |pages=1–42 |year=2001 |pmid=11521913 |url=http://cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm}}</ref> Its use in the U.S. began in the 1940s, following studies of children in a region where water is naturally fluoridated.

After it is swallowed, it has minimal effect.

A 2000 [[systematic review]] of water fluoridation's effectiveness found that fluoridation was associated with a decreased proportion of children with cavities (the median of mean decreases was 14.6%, the range −5% to 64%), and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (the median of mean decreases was 2.25 teeth, the range 0.5 to 4.4 teeth). A more comprehensive 2007 review which used the 2000 review for its water fluoridation efficacy conclusions affirmed this result.<ref name=NHMRC/>

=== Toothpaste ===
Most toothpaste today contains between 0.22 percent (1000 [[Parts per million|ppm]]) and 0.312 percent (1450 ppm) fluoride, usually in the form of sodium fluoride or sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP); 100 g of toothpaste containing 0.76 g MFP equates to 0.1 g fluoride.

Prescription strength fluoride toothpaste generally contains 1.1% (5,000 ppm) sodium fluoride toothpaste. This type of toothpaste is used in the same manner as regular toothpaste. It is well established that 1.1% sodium fluoride is safe and effective as a prevention of cavities.<ref name=ADA/> This prescription dental cream is used up to three times daily in place of regular toothpaste.

=== Mouth rinses ===
The most common fluoride compound used in [[Mouthwash|mouth rinse]] is [[sodium fluoride]]. Over-the-counter solutions of  0.05% sodium fluoride (225 ppm fluoride) for daily rinsing are available for use. Fluoride at this concentration is not strong enough for people at high risk for cavities.<ref name=ADA/>

Prescription mouth rinses are more effective for those at high risk for cavities, but are usually contraindicated for children, especially in areas with fluoridated drinking water. However, in areas without fluoridated drinking water, these rinses are sometimes prescribed for children.

=== Gels/foams ===
Gels and foams are used for individuals who are at high risk for caries, orthodontic patients, patients undergoing head and neck radiation, patients with decreased salivary flow, and children whose permanent molars should, but cannot, be sealed.

The gel or foam is applied through the use of a mouth tray, which contains the product. The tray is held in the mouth by biting. Application generally takes about four minutes, and patients should not rinse, eat, smoke, or drink for at least 30 minutes after application.

Some gels are made for home application, and are used in a manner similar to toothpaste. The concentration of fluoride in these gels is much lower than in professional products.

An imprint of a person's teeth can be made by a dentist, who then uses that to make well fitting trays to put over their teeth.  The patient can then use this to hold a fluoride treatment against their teeth overnight.

=== Varnish ===
[[Fluoride varnish]] has practical advantages over gels in ease of application, an unoffensive taste, and use of smaller amounts of fluoride than required for gel applications. Varnish is intended for the same group of patients as the gels and foams. There is also no published evidence yet that indicates that professionally applied fluoride varnish is a risk factor for enamel [[Dental fluorosis|fluorosis]]. The varnish is applied with a brush and sets within seconds.
Topical application of fluoride has shown better result than systemic fluoride application to a greater extent.

=== Slow-release devices ===
Devices that slowly release fluoride can be implanted on the surface of a tooth, typically on the side of a molar where it is not visible and does not interfere with eating. The two main types are copolymer membrane and glass bead. These devices are effective in raising fluoride concentrations and in preventing cavities, but they have problems with retention rates, that is, the devices fall off too often.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Pessan JP, Al-Ibrahim NS, Buzalaf MAR, Toumba KJ |title= Slow-release fluoride devices: a literature review |journal= J Appl Oral Sci |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=238–46 |year=2008 |pmid=19089254 |doi=10.1590/S1678-77572008000400003 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1678-77572008000400003&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>

=== Dietary supplements ===
Dietary fluoride supplements in the form of tablets, lozenges, or liquids (including fluoride-vitamin preparations) are used primarily for children in areas without fluoridated drinking water. The evidence supporting the effectiveness of this treatment for [[primary teeth]] is weak. The supplements prevent cavities in permanent teeth. A significant side effect is mild to moderate [[dental fluorosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ismail AI, Hasson H |title= Fluoride supplements, dental caries and fluorosis: a systematic review |journal= J Am Dent Assoc |volume=139 |issue=11 |pages=1457–68 |year=2008 |pmid=18978383 |doi= |url=http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/139/11/1457}}</ref>

=== Indications for fluoride therapy ===
The individual's risk factors and the reason for treatment will determine which method of fluoride delivery is used. Consult with a dentist before starting any treatment.

*[[Dental caries|White spots]]
*Moderate to high risk patients for developing decay
*Active decay
*[[Orthodontics|Orthodontic treatment]]
*Additional protection if necessary for children in areas without fluoridated drinking water
*To reduce [[tooth sensitivity]]
*Protect root surface
*Decreased salivary flow
*Institutionalized patients

== Health risks ==

===Overdose===
{{main|Fluoride toxicity}}
Consumption of large amounts of fluoride can lead to [[fluoride poisoning]] and death, the lethal dose for most adult humans is estimated at 5 to 10 g (which is equivalent to 32 to 64 mg/kg elemental fluoride/kg body weight).<ref>{{cite book | last = Gosselin | first = RE | coauthors = Smith RP, Hodge HC | authorlink = | title = Clinical toxicology of commercial products | publisher = Williams & Wilkins| location = Baltimore (MD) | year = 1984 | pages =III-185–93| isbn =0-683-03632-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Baselt | first = RC | coauthors = | authorlink = | title = Disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man | publisher = Biomedical Publications| location = Foster City (CA) | year = 2008 | pages =636–40| isbn =978-0-9626523-7-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = IPCS | first =  | coauthors = | authorlink = | title = Environmental health criteria 227 (Fluoride) | publisher = International Programme on Chemical Safety, World Health Organization| location = Geneva | year = 2002 | pages =100| isbn =92-4-157227-2}}</ref> Ingestion of fluoride can produce gastrointestinal discomfort at doses at least 15 to 20 times lower (0.2–0.3&nbsp;mg/kg) than lethal doses.<ref name=Gessner94>{{cite journal | title = Acute fluoride poisoning from a public water system | author = Bradford D.

In 1974 a 3-year old child swallowed 45 milliliters of 2% fluoride solution, estimated to be triple the fatal amount, and then died.  The fluoride was administered during his first visit to the dentist, and the dental office was later found liable for the death.<ref>''New York Times''. (1979).

===Fluorosis===
:''See main article [[Dental fluorosis]].''
Most fluorosis is mild and cosmetic, but the chance of more severe fluorosis increases with exposure. A recent report by National Research Council (NRC) states that severe dental fluorosis can be considered a "toxic effect" which increases the prevalence of caries ([[#NRC2006|106]]), but fluorosis this severe is not expected with the normal use of fluoride therapy.
