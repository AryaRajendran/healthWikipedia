'''Coliform bacteria''' are a commonly used [[bacteria]]l [[indicator bacteria|indicator]] of sanitary quality of foods and water. They are defined as rod-shaped [[Gram-negative]] non-[[endospore|spore forming]] bacteria which can ferment [[lactose]] with the production of acid and gas when incubated at 35-37°C.<ref>American Public Health Association (APHA), ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' (19th ed.), APHA, Washington, DC (1995).</ref> Coliforms can be found in the aquatic environment, in soil and on vegetation; they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of warm-blooded animals. While coliforms themselves are not normally causes of serious illness, they are easy to culture and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present. Fecal pathogens include bacteria, viruses, or protozoa and many multicellular parasites.

Typical genera include:<ref>''The Microbiology of Drinking Water (2002) –  Part 1 - Water Quality and Public Health''; '''Department of the Environment'''</ref>
*''[[Citrobacter]]'',
*''[[Enterobacter]]''
*''[[Hafnia (bacterium)|Hafnia]]''
*''[[Klebsiella]]''
*''[[Serratia]]''
*[[Fecal coliform]]:
**''[[Escherichia]]''

''[[Escherichia coli]]'' ''(E. coli)'', a rod-shaped member of the coliform group, can be distinguished from most other coliforms by its ability to ferment lactose at 44°C in the [[fecal coliform]] test, and by its growth and color reaction on certain types of culture media. When cultured on an EMB (eosin methylene blue) plate, a positive result for ''E. coli'' is metallic green colonies on a dark purple media. Unlike the general coliform group, ''E. coli'' are almost exclusively of fecal origin and their presence is thus an effective confirmation of fecal contamination. Some strains of ''E. coli'' can cause serious illness in humans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/e.coli.html |title=Pathogenic ''E. coli'' |accessdate=2007-11-30 |last=Todar |first=K. |coauthors= |date= |work=Online Textbook of Bacteriology |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison Department of Bacteriology}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=''Escherichia coli''| work=CDC National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases| url=http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/index.html/ | accessdate=2012-10-02}}</ref>
Escherichia coli have an incubation Period of 12-72 hours with the optimal growth temperature being 30°C - 37°C.

'''Symptoms include''':
Bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, vomiting & occasionally fever. Can be fatal in the young, elderly & immune compromised.
