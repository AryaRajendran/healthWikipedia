'''Constipation''' (also known as '''costiveness'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/costiveness |title=Costiveness - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}</ref> or '''dyschezia'''<ref name=Review09/>) refers to [[bowel movement]]s that are infrequent or hard to pass.<ref name=Review09>{{Cite journal|author=Chatoor D, Emmnauel A |title=Constipation and evacuation disorders |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=517–30 |year=2009 |pmid=19647687 |doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2009.05.001 }}</ref> Constipation is a common cause of painful defecation. Severe constipation includes '''obstipation''' (failure to pass stools or gas) and [[fecal impaction]], which can progress to [[bowel obstruction]] and become life-threatening.

Constipation is a [[symptom]] with many causes. These causes are of two types: [[obstructed defecation]] and colonic slow transit (or hypomobility). About 50% of patients evaluated for constipation at tertiary referral hospitals have obstructed defecation.<ref name=pmid16677147>{{cite pmid|16677147}}</ref> This type of constipation has mechanical and functional causes. Causes of colonic slow transit constipation include [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[Endocrine disease|hormonal disorders]] such as [[hypothyroidism]], side effects of medications, and rarely [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] toxicity. Because constipation is a symptom, not a disease, effective treatment of constipation may require first determining the cause. Treatments include changes in dietary habits, [[laxatives]], [[enema]]s, [[biofeedback]], and in particular situations [[surgery]] may be required.

Constipation is common; in the general population [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of constipation varies from 2 to 30%.<ref name=pmid16677147/>

* infrequent bowel movements (typically three times or fewer per week)
* difficulty during defecation (straining during more than 25% of bowel movements or a subjective sensation of hard stools), or
* the sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation.

The Rome III criteria are widely used to diagnose chronic constipation, and are helpful in separating cases of chronic functional constipation from less-serious instances.<ref name=ap01>{{Cite journal|title = Managing constipation in adults |author = Selby, Warwick |coauthors = Corte, Crispin |journal = Australian Prescriber |volume = 33 |issue = 4 |pages = 116–9 |year = 2010 | month =  August |url = http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/4/116/9 |accessdate = 27 August 2010}}</ref>

===Children===
Constipation in children usually occurs at three distinct points in time: after starting formula or processed foods (while an infant), during [[toilet training]] in toddlerhood, and soon after starting school (as in a kindergarten) <ref>Greene, Alan. [http://www.drgreene.com/qa/infant-constipation "Infant constipation"] Retrieved 2010-01-26.</ref>

After birth, most infants pass 4-5 soft liquid bowel movements (BM) a day. [[Breastfeeding|Breast-fed]] infants usually tend to have more BM compared to [[infant formula|formula]]-fed infants. Some breast-fed infants have a BM after each feed, whereas others have only one BM every 2–3 days. Infants who are breast-fed rarely develop constipation.<ref>[http://www.uptodate.com/patients/content/topic.do?topicKey=~HZ_HxVsfKqVTRj Patient information: Constipation in infants and children] Retrieved 2010-01-26.</ref> By the age of two years, a child will usually have 1–2 bowel movements per day and by four years of age, a child will have one bowel movement per day.<ref>[http://www.infant-constipation.net/ Infant Constipation remedies] Retrieved 2010-01-26.</ref>

==Causes==
The causes of constipation can be divided into [[congenital]], primary, and secondary.<ref name=Review09/> The most common cause is primary and not life threatening.<ref name=AGA2000/> In the elderly, causes include: insufficient dietary fiber intake, inadequate fluid intake, decreased [[physical activity]], side effects of medications, [[hypothyroidism]], and obstruction by [[colorectal cancer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Leung FW |title=Etiologic factors of chronic constipation: review of the scientific evidence |journal=Dig. Dis. Sci. |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=313–6 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17219073 |doi=10.1007/s10620-006-9298-7 }}</ref>

Constipation with no known organic cause, i.e. no medical [[explanation]], exhibits [[gender]] differences in [[prevalence]]: females are more often affected than males.<ref name=chang>{{cite journal |author=Chang L, Toner B, Fukudo S, Guthrie E, Locke G, Norton N, Sperber A |title=Gender, age, society, culture, and the patient's perspective in the functional gastrointestinal disorders |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=1435–46 |year=2006 |pmid=16678557 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.09.071}}</ref>

===Primary===
Primary or functional constipation is ongoing symptoms for greater than six months not due to any underlying cause such as medication [[side effects]] or an underlying medical condition.<ref name=Review09/><ref name=AFP05/> It is not associated with abdominal pain thus distinguishing it from [[irritable bowel syndrome]].<ref name=Review09/> It is the most common cause of constipation.<ref name=Review09/>

===Diet===
Constipation can be caused or exacerbated by a low fiber diet, low liquid intake, or dieting.<ref name=walia/><ref name=mccallum/>

===Medication===
Many medications have constipation as a side effect. Some include (but are not limited to); opioids (e.g. common pain killers), [[diuretics]], antidepressants, antihistamines, antispasmodics, anticonvulsants, and aluminum antacids.<ref name=walia/><ref name=ap01 />

===Metabolic and muscular===
Metabolic and endocrine problems which may lead to constipation include: [[hypercalcemia]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[cystic fibrosis]], and
[[celiac disease]].<ref name=walia/><ref name=AGA2000/> Constipation is also common in individuals with muscular and myotonic dystrophy.<ref name=walia/>

===Structural and functional abnormalities===
Constipation has a number of structural (mechanical, morphological, anatomical) causes, including: spinal cord lesions, [[Parkinsons]], [[colon cancer]], [[anal fissure]]s, [[proctitis]], and [[pelvic floor dysfunction]].<ref name=AGA2000/>

Constipation also has functional (neurological) causes, including [[anismus]], [[descending perineum syndrome]], and [[Hirschsprung's disease]].<ref name="pmid16677147"/> In infants, Hirschsprung's disease is the most common medical disorder associated with constipation. Anismus occurs in a small minority of persons with chronic constipation or obstructed defecation.<ref>{{cite pmid|9293931}}</ref>

===Psychological===
Voluntary withholding of the stool is a common cause of constipation.<ref name=walia/> The choice to withhold can be due to factors such as fear of pain, fear of public restrooms, or laziness.<ref name=walia/> When a child holds in the stool a combination of encouragement, [[drink|fluids]], [[dietary fiber|fiber]], and [[laxative]]s may be useful to overcome the problem.<ref>{{cite journal

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is essentially made from the patient's description of the symptoms. Bowel movements that are difficult to pass, very firm, or made up of small hard pellets (like those excreted by rabbits) qualify as constipation, even if they occur every day. Other symptoms related to constipation can include bloating, [[Abdominal distension|distension]], abdominal pain, headaches, a feeling of fatigue and nervous exhaustion, or a sense of incomplete emptying.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/constipation/article.htm "Constipation"] MedicineNet</ref>

Inquiring about dietary habits will often reveal a low intake of [[dietary fiber]], inadequate amounts of fluids, poor ambulation or immobility, or medications that are associated with constipation.<ref name=walia/><ref name=mccallum/>

During [[physical examination]], ''scybala''<ref>Pronounced [síbǝlǝ], “''med.'' hardened masses of feces” (Webster), plur. of [[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] σκύβαλον [skýbalon], “dung, excrement; manure, refuse, offal” (Liddel/Scott). Sing. also found in English (with latinized ending), ''scybalum'', “a lump in the intestines; a hard round mass of inspissated faeces”.</ref> (manually palpable lumps of stool) may be detected on palpation of the abdomen. [[Rectal examination]] gives an impression of the anal sphincter [[muscle tone|tone]] and whether the lower rectum contains any feces or not. Rectal examination also gives information on the consistency of the stool, presence of [[hemorrhoid]]s, admixture of blood and whether any tumors, [[polyp]]s or abnormalities are present. Physical examination may be done manually by the physician, or by using a [[colonoscope]]. [[X-ray]]s of the abdomen, generally only performed if bowel obstruction is suspected, may reveal extensive impacted fecal matter in the colon, and confirm or rule out other causes of similar symptoms.<ref name=walia/><ref name=mccallum/>

Chronic constipation (symptoms present at least three days per month for more than three months) associated with abdominal discomfort is often diagnosed as [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) when no obvious cause is found.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Longstreth GF, Thompson WG, Chey WD, Houghton LA, Mearin F, Spiller RC |title=Functional bowel disorders |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=1480–91 |year=2006 |pmid=16678561 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.11.061}}</ref>

Colonic propagating pressure wave sequences (PSs) are responsible for discrete movements of the bowel contents and are vital for normal defecation. Deficiencies in PS frequency, amplitude and extent of propagation are all implicated in severe defecatory dysfunction (SDD). Mechanisms that can normalise these aberrant motor patterns may help rectify the problem. Recently the novel therapy of [[sacral nerve stimulation]] (SNS) has been utilized for the treatment of severe constipation.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Philip G. |last=Dinning |title= Colonic manometry and sacral nerve stimulation in patients with severe constipation |journal=Pelviperineology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=114–116 |year=2007 | month = September | url = http://www.pelviperineology.com/pelvis/severe_constipation_colonic_manometry_sacral_nerve_stimulation.html }}</ref>

==Criteria==
The Rome II Criteria for constipation require at least two of the following symptoms for 12 weeks or more over the period of a year:<ref name="pmid12074527">{{cite journal |author=Arce DA, Ermocilla CA, Costa H |title=Evaluation of constipation |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=2283–90 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12074527 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0601/p2283.html}}</ref>
*Straining with more than one-fourth of [[defecation]]s
*Hard [[stool]] with more than one-fourth of [[defecation]]s
*Feeling of incomplete evacuation with more than one-fourth of [[defecation]]s
*Sensation of [[anorectal]] obstruction with more than one-fourth of [[defecation]]s
*Manual maneuvers to facilitate more than one-fourth of [[defecation]]s
*Fewer than three [[bowel]] movements per week
*Insufficient criteria for [[irritable bowel syndrome]]

==Prevention==
Constipation is usually easier to prevent than to treat. Following the relief of constipation, maintenance with adequate exercise, fluid intake, and high fiber diet is recommended.<ref name=walia/> Children benefit from scheduled toilet breaks, once early in the morning and 30 minutes after meals.<ref name=walia/><ref name=bharucha>{{Cite journal

}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The main treatment of constipation involves the increased intake of water and fiber (either [[dietary fiber|dietary]] or as supplements).<ref name=AGA2000/> The routine use of laxatives is discouraged, as having bowel movements may come to be dependent upon their use. [[Enemas]] can be used to provide a form of mechanical stimulation. However, enemas are generally useful only for stool in the rectum, not in the intestinal tract.

===Laxatives===
If [[laxatives]] are used, [[milk of magnesia]] is recommended as a first-line agent due to its low cost and safety.<ref name=AGA2000/> Stimulants should only be used if this is not effective.<ref name=AGA2000/> In cases of chronic constipation, [[polyethylene glycol]] appears superior to lactulose.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee-Robichaud|first=H|coauthors=Thomas, K; Morgan, J; Nelson, RL|title=Lactulose versus Polyethylene Glycol for Chronic Constipation.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2010 Jul 7|issue=7|pages=CD007570|pmid=20614462}}</ref> [[Prokinetic agent|prokinetic]]s may be used to improve gastrointestinal motility. A number of new agents have shown positive outcomes in chronic constipation; these include [[prucalopride]],<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Camilleri M, Deiteren A |title=Prucalopride for constipation |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=451–61 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20102308 |doi=10.1517/14656560903567057 }}</ref> and [[lubiprostone]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Barish CF, Drossman D, Johanson JF, Ueno R |title=Efficacy and safety of lubiprostone in patients with chronic constipation |journal=Dig.

===Physical intervention===
Constipation that resists the above measures may require physical intervention such as [[manual disimpaction]] (the physical removal of impacted stool using the hands; see [[Fecal impaction]]).

===Pediatric===
[[Lactulose]] and [[milk of magnesia]] have been compared with [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) in children. All had similar side effects, but PEG was more effective at treating constipation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1471 |title=Is PEG (Polyethylene Glycol) a more effective laxative than Lactulose in the treatment of a child who is constipated? |work = BestBETs |date = 16 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Candy D, Belsey J |title=Macrogol (polyethylene glycol) laxatives in children with functional constipation and faecal impaction: a systematic review |journal=Arch.

==Prognosis==
Complications that can arise from constipation include [[hemorrhoids]], [[anal fissures]], [[rectal prolapse]], and [[fecal impaction]].<ref name=walia/><ref name=mccallum/><ref name=bharucha/><ref name=niddk>National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse. (2007) NIH Publication No. 07–2754. http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/constipation/#treatment, Retrieved 7-18-2010.</ref> Straining to pass stool may lead to [[hemorrhoid]]s. In later stages of constipation, the abdomen may become distended, hard and diffusely tender. Severe cases ("fecal impaction" or ''malignant constipation'') may exhibit symptoms of bowel obstruction ([[vomiting]], very tender abdomen) and [[encopresis]], where soft stool from the small intestine bypasses the mass of impacted fecal matter in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]].

==Epidemiology==
Constipation is the most common digestive complaint in the United States as per survey data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uwgi.org/guidelines/ch_05/CH05TXT.HTM |title=Constipation |author=Shoba Krishnamurthy; Michael Shuffler; Jan Hirschmann }}</ref> Depending on the definition employed, it occurs in 2% to 20% of the population.<ref name=AGA2000>{{Cite journal|author=Locke GR, Pemberton JH, Phillips SF |title=American Gastroenterological Association Medical Position Statement: guidelines on constipation |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=119 |issue=6 |pages=1761–6 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11113098 |doi= 10.1053/gast.2000.20390 }}</ref><ref name=Epi89>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sonnenberg | first1 = A | last2 = Koch | first2 = TR | title=Epidemiology of constipation in the United States |journal=Dis Colon Rectum |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2910654|doi=10.1007/BF02554713}}</ref> It is more common in women, the elderly and children.<ref name=Epi89/> The reasons it occurs more frequently in the elderly is felt to be due to an increasing number of health problems as humans age and decreased physical activity.<ref name=AFP05>{{Cite journal|author=Hsieh C |title=Treatment of constipation in older adults |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=2277–84 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16342852 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1201/p2277.html }}</ref>
