'''Transitional epithelium''' (also known as urothelium) is a type of tissue consisting of multiple layers of [[epithelial]] cells which can contract and expand. These cells, part of the [[epithelium]], are found in the [[urinary bladder]], in the [[ureters]], and in the superior [[urethra]] and gland ducts of the [[prostate]].

==Appearance==
These cells appear to be [[cuboidal]] with a domed apex when the organ or the tube in which they reside is not stretched. When the bladder fills, the tissue actually compresses and the cells become stretched, and they appear to be flat, irregular, and [[squamous]].

==Functions==
The transitional epithelium cells accommodate fluctuation of volume of the liquid in an organ or tube, such as the urinary bladder, and protect against the caustic effects of [[urine]].
Location : urinary bladder, kidneys, ureters, and urethra.

==Surfaces==
The free surface of the tissue (the part that faces outward into the organ or tube) is called the [[apical surface]] or free surface. 

The part that lines the bottom of the tissue is called the [[basement membrane]].
