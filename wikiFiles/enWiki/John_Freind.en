'''John Freind''' (1675 – 26 July 1728), FRS, was an [[England|English]] [[physician]].

==Life==
He was younger brother of [[Robert Freind]] (1667–1751), headmaster of [[Westminster School]], and was born at [[Croughton, Northamptonshire]]. He was under [[Richard Busby]] at [[Westminster School]], and studied at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] under [[Henry Aldrich]]. 

After this he began the study of medicine, and having proved his scientific attainments by various treatises was appointed a lecturer on chemistry at Oxford in 1704. In the following year he accompanied the [[British Army|English army]], under [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough]], into [[Spain]]. Shortly after his return in 1713 from [[Flanders]], where he had accompanied British troops, he took up residence in [[London]], where he soon obtained a reputation as a physician.

In 1716 he became a fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], delivered the [[Goulstonian Lectures]] in 1717, was chosen one of the censors in 1718 and [[Harveian orator]] in 1720. In 1722 he entered the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]] in [[Cornwall]]; but, being suspected of favoring the cause of the exiled Stuarts, he spent half of that year in the [[Tower of London|Tower]]. In 1726 Freind was appointed physician to [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]], an office which he held till his death.

He had purchased the manor of Hitcham in Berkshire and was buried there.

==Works==
While still very young, he produced with [[Peter Foulkes]] an edition of the speeches of [[Aeschines]] and [[Demosthenes]] on the affair of [[Ctesiphon (orator)|Ctesiphon]]. An returning home in 1707, he wrote an account of the expedition to Spain, which attained great popularity. In 1709 he published his ''Prelectiones chimicae'', which he dedicated to [[Sir Isaac Newton]].

During his imprisonment he conceived his major work, ''The History of Physic'', of which the first part appeared in 1725, and the second in the following year. Included in this volume was a paper by Dr. [[Henry Levett]], also written in Latin, addressing the treatment of smallpox. 

A complete edition of his Latin works, with a Latin translation of the ''History of Physic'', edited by [[John Wigan (physician)|John Wigan]], was published in London in 1732.
