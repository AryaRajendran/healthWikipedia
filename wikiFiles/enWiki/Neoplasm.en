'''Neoplasm''' (from [[ancient Greek]]  νεο- ''neo-'', "new" + πλάσμα ''plasma'', "formation", "creation") is an abnormal mass of tissue as a result of '''neoplasia'''. Neoplasia is the abnormal growth or division of cells. Prior to neoplasia, [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s often undergo an abnormal pattern of growth, such as [[metaplasia]] or [[dysplasia]].<ref name = "Abrams">{{cite web |last=Abrams |first=Gerald |title=Neoplasia I |url=http://open.umich.edu/education/med/m1/patientspop-genetics/fall2008/materials |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> However, metaplasia or dysplasia do not always progress to neoplasia. The growth of neoplastic cells exceeds, and is not coordinated with, that of the normal tissues around it. The growth persists in the same excessive manner even after cessation of the stimuli. It usually causes a lump or [[tumor]]. Neoplasms may be [[Benign tumor|benign]], pre-malignant ([[carcinoma in situ]]) or malignant ([[cancer]]).

In modern medicine, the term ''tumor'' means a neoplasm that has formed a lump.  In the past, the term ''tumor'' was used differently.  Some neoplasms do not cause a lump.

==Types==
A neoplasm can be benign, potentially malignant (pre-cancer), or malignant ([[cancer]]).<ref name="titleCancer - Activity 1 - Glossary, page 4 of 5">{{cite web |url=http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih1/cancer/other/glossary/act1-gloss4.htm |title=Cancer - Activity 1 - Glossary, page 4 of 5 |accessdate=2008-01-08 |format= |work=}}</ref>
* [[Benign tumor|Benign neoplasm]]s include [[uterine fibroids]] and [[melanocytic nevus|melanocytic nevi]] (skin moles). They are circumscribed and localized and do not transform into cancer.<ref name = "Abrams" />
* Potentially malignant neoplasms include [[carcinoma in situ]]. They do not invade and destroy but, given enough time, will transform into a cancer.
* Malignant neoplasms are commonly called cancer. They invade and destroy the surrounding tissue,  may form [[metastasis|metastases]] and eventually kill the host.
* Secondary neoplasm refers to any of a class of cancerous tumor that is either a metastatic offshoot of a primary tumor, or an apparently unrelated tumor that increases in frequency following certain cancer treatments such as  [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiotherapy]].

==Difficulty of definition==
Because neoplasia includes very different diseases, it is difficult to find an all-encompassing definition.<ref name="titleWhat is neoplasm">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.webmd.com/terms/neoplasm |title=What is neoplasm? Find the definition for neoplasm at WebMD |accessdate=2008-01-08 |format= |work=}}</ref>  The definition of the British [[oncology|oncologist]] R.A. Willis is widely cited: "A neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the normal tissues, and persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimulus which evoked the change."<ref>Willis RA. ''The Spread of Tumors in the Human Body''. London, Butterworth & Co, 1952</ref> This definition is criticized because some neoplasms, such as nevi, are not progressive.

===Clonality===
Neoplastic tumors often contain more than one type of cell, but their initiation and continued growth is usually dependent on a single population of neoplastic cells. These cells are presumed to be [[clone (cell biology)|clonal]] – that is, they are descended from a single progenitor cell.

Sometimes, the neoplastic cells all carry the same [[mutation|genetic]] or [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] anomaly that becomes evidence for clonality. For lymphoid neoplasms, e.g. [[lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]], clonality is proven by the amplification of a single rearrangement of their [[immunoglobulin]] gene (for [[B cell]] lesions) or [[T-cell receptor]] gene (for [[T cell]] lesions). The demonstration of clonality is now considered to be necessary to identify a lymphoid cell proliferation as neoplastic.<ref name="pmid7990861">{{cite journal |author=Lee ES, Locker J, Nalesnik M, ''et al.'' |title=The association of Epstein-Barr virus with smooth-muscle tumors occurring after organ transplantation |journal=[[N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=332 |issue=1 |pages=19–25 |year=1995 |pmid=7990861 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199501053320104|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=7990861&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref>

It is tempting to define neoplasms as clonal cellular proliferations but the demonstration of clonality is not always possible. Therefore, clonality is not required in the definition of neoplasia.

==Neoplasia vs. tumor==
[[Tumor]] (Latin for ''swelling'', one of the cardinal signs of inflammation) originally meant any form of [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], neoplastic or not. Current English, however, both medical and non-medical, uses ''tumor'' as a  synonym of ''neoplasm''.<ref name="titlePancreas Cancer: Glossary of Terms">{{cite web |url=http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/slides/glossary.html |title=Pancreas Cancer: Glossary of Terms |accessdate=2008-01-08 |format= |work=}}
</ref>

Some neoplasms do not form a tumor. These include [[leukemia]] and most forms of [[carcinoma in situ]].

==Malignant neoplasms==

===Primary causes: DNA damage/deficient DNA repair===
[[File:Diagram Damage to Cancer Wiki 300dpi.svg|thumb|400px|The central role of DNA damage and epigenetic defects in DNA repair genes in malignant neoplasms]]

DNA damage is considered to be the primary underlying cause of malignant neoplasms (cancers).<ref>http://www.scitopics.com/DNA_Damage_and_Cancer.html</ref>  Its central role in progression to cancer is illustrated in the figure in this section, in the box near the top. (The central features of DNA damage, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations and deficient DNA repair in progression to cancer are shown in red.)  DNA damage is very common.  Naturally occurring DNA damages (mostly due to cellular metabolism and the properties of DNA in water at body temperatures) occur at a rate of more than 10,000 new damages, on average, per human cell, per day [see article [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]] ].  Additional DNA damages can arise from exposure to [[Exogeny|exogenous]] agents.  Tobacco smoke causes increased [[Exogeny|exogenous]] DNA damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking.<ref> Cunningham FH, Fiebelkorn S, Johnson M, Meredith C.

Oncogene 2012; 31: 342-351  PMID: 21685942 DOI: 10.1038/onc.2011.241</ref>  Some sources of DNA damage are indicated in the boxes at the top of the figure in this section.

Individuals with a germ line mutation causing deficiency in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]) are at increased risk of [[cancer]].  Some germ line mutations in DNA repair genes cause up to 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations [74]).<ref>Malkin D. (2011). Li-fraumeni syndrome. Genes Cancer 2(4) 475-484. PMID: 21779515</ref>  These germ line mutations are indicated in a box at the left of the figure with an arrow indicating their contribution to DNA repair deficiency.

About 70% of malignant neoplasms have no hereditary component and are called "sporadic cancers".<ref>Lichtenstein P, Holm NV, Verkasalo PK, Iliadou A, Kaprio J, Koskenvuo M, Pukkala E, Skytthe A, Hemminki K. Environmental and heritable factors in the causation of cancer--analyses of cohorts of twins from Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. N Engl J Med 2000;343(2) 78-85. PMID: 10891514</ref> Only a minority of sporadic cancers have a deficiency in DNA repair due to mutation in a DNA repair gene.  However, a majority of sporadic cancers have deficiency in DNA repair due to [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations that reduce or silence DNA repair gene expression.  For example, for 113 sequential colorectal cancers, only four had a [[missense mutation]] in the DNA repair gene [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]], while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration).<ref>Halford S, Rowan A, Sawyer E, Talbot I, Tomlinson I. (2005). O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase in colorectal cancers: detection of mutations, loss of expression, and weak association with G:C>A:T transitions. Gut 54(6):797-802. PMID: 15888787  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15888787</ref>  Five reports present evidence that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.<ref>Shen L, Kondo Y, Rosner GL, Xiao L, Hernandez NS, Vilaythong J, Houlihan PS, Krouse RS, Prasad AR, Einspahr JG, Buckmeier J, Alberts DS, Hamilton SR, Issa JP (2005).

Similarly, out of 119 cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1)<ref>Truninger K, Menigatti M, Luz J, Russell A, Haider R, Gebbers JO, Bannwart F, Yurtsever H, Neuweiler J, Riehle HM, Cattaruzza MS, Heinimann K, Schär P, Jiricny J, Marra G. (2005). Immunohistochemical analysis reveals high frequency of PMS2 defects in colorectal cancer. Gastroenterology 128:1160-1171. PMID: 15887099</ref>.  In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1.<ref>Valeri N, Gasparini P, Fabbri M, Braconi C, Veronese A, Lovat F, Adair B, Vannini I, Fanini F, Bottoni A, Costinean S, Sandhu SK, Nuovo GJ, Alder H, Gafa R, Calore F, Ferracin M, Lanza G, Volinia S, Negrini M, Mcllhatton MA, Amadori D, Fishel R, Croce CM: Modulation of mismatch repair and genomic stability by miR-155. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2010, 107:6982-6987. PMID: 20351277 </ref>

In further examples [tabulated in the article [[Epigenetics]] (see section “DNA repair epigenetics in cancer”)], epigenetic defects were found at frequencies of between 13%-100% for the DNA repair genes [[BRCA1]], [[Werner syndrome ATP-dependent helicase|WRN]], [[FANCB]], [[FANCF]], MGMT, [[MLH1]], [[MSH2]], [[MSH4]], [[ERCC1]], [[ERCC4|XPF]], [[NEIL1]] and [[Ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]].  These epigenetic defects occurred in various cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian, colorectal and head and neck).  Two or three deficiencies in expression of ERCC1, XPF and/or PMS2 occur simultaneously in the majority of the 49 colon cancers evaluated by Facista et al.<ref name=Facista>Facista A, Nguyen H, Lewis C, Prasad AR, Ramsey L, Zaitlin B, Nfonsam V, Krouse RS, Bernstein H, Payne CM, Stern S, Oatman N, Banerjee B, Bernstein C. (2012). Deficient expression of DNA repair enzymes in early progression to sporadic colon cancer. Genome Integr. 3(1):3. doi: 10.1186/2041-9414-3-3. PMID: 22494821 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22494821</ref> Epigenetic alterations causing reduced expression of DNA repair genes is shown in a central box at the third level from the top of the figure in this section, and the consequent DNA repair deficiency is shown at the fourth level.

When expression of DNA repair genes is reduced, DNA damages accumulate in cells at a higher than normal level, and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation and/or epimutation. Mutation rates strongly increase in cells defective in [[DNA mismatch repair]]<ref name=Narayanan>Narayanan L, Fritzell JA, Baker SM, Liskay RM, Glazer PM. (1997).

During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] gene silencing.<ref>O'Hagan HM, Mohammad HP, Baylin SB. (2008) Double strand breaks can initiate gene silencing and SIRT1-dependent onset of DNA methylation in an exogenous promoter CpG island. PLoS Genet. 4(8):e1000155.

DNA damage, homology-directed repair, and DNA methylation. PLoS Genet 3(7):e110. PMID: 17616978</ref> DNA repair deficiencies (level 4 in the figure) cause increased DNA damages (level 5 in the figure) which result in increased somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations (level 6 in the figure).

Field defects, normal appearing tissue with multiple alterations (and discussed in the section below), are common precursors to development of the disordered and improperly proliferating clone of tissue in a malignant neoplasm.  Such field defects (second level from bottom of figure) may have multiple mutations and epigenetic alterations. 

Once a cancer is formed, it usually has [[genome instability]].  This instability is likely due to reduced DNA repair or excessive DNA damage.  Because of such instability, the cancer continues to evolve and to produce sub clones.  For example, a renal cancer, sampled in 9 areas, had 40 ubiquitous mutations (i.e. present in all areas of the cancer), 59 mutations shared by some (but not all areas), and 29 “private” mutations only present in one of the areas of the cancer.<ref>Gerlinger M, Rowan AJ, Horswell S, Larkin J, Endesfelder D, Gronroos E, Martinez P, Matthews N, Stewart A, Tarpey P, Varela I, Phillimore B, Begum S, McDonald NQ, Butler A, Jones D, Raine K, Latimer C, Santos CR, Nohadani M, Eklund AC, Spencer-Dene B, Clark G, Pickering L, Stamp G, Gore M, Szallasi Z, Downward J, Futreal PA, Swanton C.

===Field defects in progression to cancer===

Plus a schematic diagram indicating a likely field defect (a region of tissue that precedes and predisposes to the development of cancer) in this colon segment. The diagram indicates sub-clones and sub-sub-clones that were precursors to the tumors.]]

The term “field cancerization” was first used in 1953 to describe an area or “field” of epithelium that has been preconditioned by (at that time) largely unknown processes so as to predispose it towards development of cancer.<ref>Slaughter DP, Southwick HW, Smejkal W. (1953). Field cancerization in oral stratified squamous epithelium; clinical implications of multicentric origin.  Cancer 6: 963-968.  PMID: 13094644</ref> Since then, the terms “field cancerization” and “field defect” have been used to describe pre-malignant tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise. 

Field defects are important in progression to cancer.<ref>Bernstein C, Bernstein H, Payne CM, Dvorak K, Garewal H. (2008). Field defects in progression to gastrointestinal tract cancers. Cancer Lett 260(1-2):1-10. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2007.11.027. Review.

(2011). Fields and field cancerization: the preneoplastic origins of cancer: asymptomatic hyperplastic fields are precursors of neoplasia, and their progression to tumors can be tracked by saturation density in culture. Bioessays 33: 224-231  PMID: 21254148   DOI: 10.1002/bies.201000067</ref> “The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors in vivo, or on discrete neoplastic foci in vitro.  Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion…<ref>Tsao JL, Yatabe Y, Salovaara R, Järvinen HJ, Mecklin JP, Aaltonen LA, Tavaré S, Shibata D. (2000). Genetic reconstruction of individual colorectal tumor histories. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 97: 1236-1241  PMID: 10655514.</ref>”  Similarly, Vogelstein et al.<ref name=Vogelstein>Vogelstein B, Papadopoulos N, Velculescu VE, Zhou S, Diaz LA Jr, Kinzler KW. (2013). Cancer genome landscapes. Science 339(6127):1546-58. doi: 10.1126/science.1235122. Review. PMID: 23539594</ref> point out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells.  Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.

In the colon, a field defect probably arises by natural selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells at the base of one of the [[Intestinal gland|intestinal crypts]] on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells by natural selection. Thus, a patch of abnormal tissue may arise.  The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps.  Below the photo there is a schematic diagram of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram.  Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer). In the photo, an apparent field defect in this segment of a colon has generated four polyps (labeled with the size of the polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and two of 3mm, and a cancer about 3 cm across in its longest dimension). These neoplasms are also indicated, in the diagram below the photo, by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer).  The cancer in the photo occurred in the cecal area of the colon, where the colon joins the small intestine (labeled) and where the appendix occurs (labeled).  The fat in the photo is external to the outer wall of the colon.  In the segment of colon shown here, the colon was cut open lengthwise to expose the inner surface of the colon and to display the cancer and polyps occurring within the inner epithelial lining of the colon.

If the general process by which sporadic colon cancers arise is the formation of a pre-neoplastic clone that spreads by natural selection, followed by formation of internal sub-clones within the initial clone, and sub-sub-clones inside those, then colon cancers generally should be associated with, and be preceded by, fields of increasing abnormality reflecting the succession of premalignant events. The most extensive region of abnormality (the outermost yellow irregular area in the diagram) would reflect the earliest event in formation of a malignant neoplasm.

In experimental evaluation of specific DNA repair deficiencies in cancers, many specific DNA repair deficiencies were also shown to occur in the field defects surrounding those cancers.  The Table, below, gives examples for which the DNA repair deficiency in a cancer was shown to be caused by an epigenetic alteration, and the somewhat lower frequencies with which the same epigenetically caused DNA repair deficiency was found in the surrounding field defect.

Some of the small polyps in the field defect shown in the photo of the opened colon segment may be relatively benign neoplasms.  Of polyps less than 10mm in size, found during colonoscopy and followed with repeat colonoscopies for 3 years, 25% were unchanged in size, 35% regressed or shrank in size while 40% grew in size.<ref>Hofstad B, Vatn MH, Andersen SN, Huitfeldt HS, Rognum T, Larsen S, Osnes M.

===Genome instability in cancer===

Cancers are known to exhibit [[genome instability]] or a mutator phenotype.<ref>Schmitt MW, Prindle MJ, Loeb LA. (2012). Implications of genetic heterogeneity in cancer. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2012 Sep;1267:110-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06590.x.  PMID: 22954224</ref> The protein-coding DNA within the nucleus is about 1.5% of the total genomic DNA.<ref>International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (2001). "Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome". Nature 409 (6822): 860–921. doi:10.1038/35057062. PMID 11237011.</ref>  Within this protein-coding DNA (called the [[exome]]), an average cancer of the breast or colon can have about 60 to 70 protein altering mutations, of which about 3 or 4 may be “driver” mutations, and the remaining ones may be “passenger” mutations<ref name=Vogelstein /> However, the average number of DNA sequence mutations in the entire genome (including [[Noncoding DNA|non-protein-coding regions]]) within a breast cancer tissue sample is about 20,000.<ref>Yost SE, Smith EN, Schwab RB, Bao L, Jung H, Wang X, Voest E, Pierce JP, Messer K, Parker BA, Harismendy O, Frazer KA. (2012). Identification of high-confidence somatic mutations in whole genome sequence of formalin-fixed breast cancer specimens. Nucleic Acids Res 40(14):e107. PMID: 22492626 </ref> In an average melanoma tissue sample (where melanomas have a higher [[exome]] mutation frequency<ref name=Vogelstein />) the total number of DNA sequence mutations is about 80,000.<ref>Berger MF, Hodis E, Heffernan TP, Deribe YL, Lawrence MS, Protopopov A, Ivanova E, Watson IR, Nickerson E, Ghosh P, Zhang H, Zeid R, Ren X, Cibulskis K, Sivachenko AY, Wagle N, Sucker A, Sougnez C, Onofrio R, Ambrogio L, Auclair D, Fennell T, Carter SL, Drier Y, Stojanov P, Singer MA, Voet D, Jing R, Saksena G, Barretina J, Ramos AH, Pugh TJ, Stransky N, Parkin M, Winckler W, Mahan S, Ardlie K, Baldwin J, Wargo J, Schadendorf D, Meyerson M, Gabriel SB, Golub TR, Wagner SN, Lander ES, Getz G, Chin L, Garraway LA. (2012). Melanoma genome sequencing reveals frequent PREX2 mutations. Nature 485(7399):502-6. doi: 10.1038/nature11071. PMID: 22622578</ref> These high frequencies of mutations in the total nucleotide sequences within cancers suggest that often an early alteration in the field defects giving rise to a cancer (e.g. yellow area in the diagram in this section) is a deficiency in DNA repair.  The large field defects surrounding colon cancers (extending to at about 10 cm on each side of a cancer) were shown by Facista et al.<ref name=Facista /> to frequently have epigenetic defects in 2 or 3 DNA repair proteins ([[ERCC1]], XPF and/or [[PMS2]]) in the entire area of the field defect.  Deficiencies in DNA repair cause increased mutation rates.<ref name=Narayanan /><ref name=Hegan /><ref name=Tutt /> A deficiency in DNA repair, itself, can allow DNA damages to accumulate, and error-prone [[DNA repair|translesion synthesis]] past some of those damages may give rise to mutations.  In addition, faulty repair of these accumulated DNA damages may give rise to epimutations.  These new mutations and/or epimutations may provide a proliferative advantage, generating a field defect.  Although the mutations/epimutations in DNA repair genes do not, themselves, confer a selective advantage, they may be carried along as passengers in cells when the cell acquires an additional mutation/epimutation that does provide a proliferative advantage.
