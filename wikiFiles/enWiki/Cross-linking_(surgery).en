The '''Cross-linking''' (also known as CXL, CCR, CCL, C3-R and KXL) is a parasurgical treatment for [[keratoconus]].

It was first developed in [[Germany]] in 2000 and clinical trials have been in course since the same year; in [[Italy]], clinical trials have been successfully performed since 2002, while in the [[USA]] clinical trials commenced only in 2008. The procedure, with epithelium removed, is approved for use throughout Europe.

== The procedure ==

The cross-linking involves a one-time application of [[riboflavin]] solution to the eye that is activated by illumination with [[UV-A]] light for approximately 30 minutes. The riboflavin causes new bonds to form across adjacent collagen strands in the stromal layer of the [[cornea]], which recovers and preserves some of the cornea's mechanical strength. The corneal epithelial layer is generally removed to increase penetration of the riboflavin into the stroma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Spoerl E, Wollensak G, Dittert DD, Seiler T |title=Thermomechanical behavior of collagen-cross-linked porcine cornea |journal=Ophthalmologica |volume=218 |issue=2 |pages=136–40 |year=2004 |pmid=15004504 |doi=10.1159/000076150}}</ref> 

In some cases, collagen cross-linking may also be combined with other treatments to improve corneal strength or optical refraction.

Increased corneal symmetry allows for more comfortable contact lens wear, often of daily disposable lenses. These newer methods have an important role in limiting deterioration of vision, increasing unaided and uncorrected vision, and strongly reducing the case for [[corneal transplantation]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hersch|first=Peter S.|title=Keratoconus approach is promising|url=http://www.oteurope.com/ophthalmologytimeseurope/Cornea/Keratoconus-approach-is-promising/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/672226?contextCategoryId=33158|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Ophthalmology Times Europe|date=01 June 2010}}</ref>

Patients that are considered for treatment must undergo an extensive clinical workup, including computerized corneal topography, endothelial microscopy, ultrasound pachymetry, b-scan sonography, keratometry and biomicroscopy.
