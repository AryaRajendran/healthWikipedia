'''Dr. Sheila Cassidy''' (born 1937, [[Cranwell]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]) is an [[English people|English]] doctor, known for her work in the [[Hospice care|hospice]] movement, as a writer and as someone who, by publicising her own history as a [[torture]] survivor, drew attention to [[human rights]] abuse in [[Chile]] in the 1970s.

==Early life==
Cassidy grew up in [[Sydney]], and attended the [[Our Lady of Mercy College, Parramatta|Our Lady of Mercy College]] in [[Parramatta]], a suburb of Sydney. She began her medical studies at the [[University of Sydney]] and completed them at [[Oxford University]] in 1963. She wanted to become a [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] but couldn't keep up with the 90-hour week, so she went to practise medicine in Chile during the government of [[Salvador Allende]].

==Torture==
In 1975, Cassidy was caught up in the violence of the [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] regime. She gave medical care to Nelson Gutierrez, a political opponent of the new regime who was being sought by the police.<ref name="times1">{{Cite news|title=Chile holds doctor from Britain|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=6 November 1975|page=1|issue=59546}}</ref> As a result, she was herself arrested on 1 November 1975 by the Chilean [[secret police]], the [[Direcci√≥n de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], and kept in custody without trial.<ref name=times1/> During the early part of her custody, she was severely tortured in the notorious [[Villa Grimaldi]] near [[Santiago, Chile]], in order to force her to disclose information about her patient and her other contacts.<ref name="times2">{{Cite news|title=Mr Callaghan recalls Chile ambassador over electric shock torture of Dr Cassidy|first=Robert|last=Fisk|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=31 December 1975|page=1|issue=59590}}</ref><ref name="times3">{{Cite news|title=Dr Cassidy describes electric shock torture and prison 'sex house'|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=20 January 1976|page=7|issue=59606}}</ref>

On her release from custody and return to the UK, Cassidy's description of her experiences, including her account of her torture on the [[parrilla (torture)|parrilla]] and her imprisonment, did much to bring to the attention of the UK public the widespread human right abuses that were occurring at the time in Chile. Her story appeared in news media and in her book, ''Audacity to Believe''.<ref name="cassidy">Cassidy, Sheila (1977). ''Audacity To Believe'', Collins, London. ISBN 0-00-211858-0.</ref>

==Later life==
After a period of recovery from the physical and psychological effects of her ordeal (during which she briefly became a [[nun]]), Cassidy continued to practise as a doctor. In 1982 she became Medical Director of the new St Luke's [[hospice care|Hospice]] in [[Plymouth]], a position which she held for 15 years. She then went on to set up a [[palliative care]] service for the Plymouth hospitals. 

Cassidy has written a number of books on [[Christian]] subjects and has been involved with a number of charitable organisations such as patronage of [[The Prison Phoenix Trust]]. In her book "Confessions of a Lapsed Catholic" she outlines her reasons that caused her to withdraw her allegiance from the [[Roman Catholic]] Church.

Sheila Cassidy now has a Form named after her in [[St Joseph's Catholic & Anglican High School]], Wrexham.
