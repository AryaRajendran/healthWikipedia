The '''inferior carotid triangle''' (or '''muscular triangle'''), is bounded, in front, by the median line of the neck from the [[hyoid bone]] to the [[Human sternum|sternum]]; behind, by the anterior margin of the [[Sternocleidomastoideus]]; above, by the superior belly of the [[Omohyoideus]]. 

It is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, [[Platysma]], and deep fascia, ramifying in which are some of the branches of the supraclavicular nerves. 

Beneath these superficial structures are the [[Sternohyoideus]] and [[Sternothyreoideus]], which, together with the anterior margin of the [[Sternocleidomastoideus]], conceal the lower part of the [[common carotid artery]]. 

This vessel is enclosed within its sheath, together with the [[internal jugular vein]] and [[vagus nerve]]; the vein lies lateral to the artery on the right side of the neck, but overlaps it below on the left side; the nerve lies between the artery and vein, on a plane posterior to both. 

In front of the sheath are a few descending filaments from the [[ansa cervicalis]]; behind the sheath are the [[inferior thyroid artery]], the [[recurrent nerve]], and the [[sympathetic trunk]]; and on its medial side, the [[esophagus]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], the [[thyroid gland]], and the lower part of the [[larynx]]. 

By cutting into the upper part of this space, and slightly displacing the Sternocleidomastoideus, the common carotid artery may be tied below the Omohyoideus.
