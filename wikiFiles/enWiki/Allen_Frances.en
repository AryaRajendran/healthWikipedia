'''Allen J. Frances, MD''' (born 1942) is an [[United States|American]] [[psychiatrist]] best known for chairing the Task Force that produced the fourth revision of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ([[DSM-IV]]) and for his critique of the current version, [[DSM-5]]. He warns that the expanding boundary of psychiatry is causing a diagnostic inflation that is swallowing up normality and that the over-treatment of the 'worried well' is distracting attention from the core mission of treating the more severely ill.

==Education and career==
Frances was born in [[New York City|New York]], [[New York]] in 1942. He received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[pre-med]] and [[economics]] from [[Columbia College]] in 1963; his [[M.D.]] from [[Downstate Medical Center]] in 1967; completed his psychiatric residency at the [[Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center]] and [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]] in 1971; and received a Certificate in Psychoanalytic Medicine from the [[Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research]] 1978. His early career was spent at [[Cornell University Medical College]] where he rose to the rank of Professor, headed the outpatient department, saw patients, taught, established a brief therapy program, and developed research specialty clinics for schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, and AIDS. Throughout his academic career, Frances was an active investigator and prolific author in a surprisingly wide range of clinical areas including personality disorders, chronic depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, AIDS, and psychotherapy. His book on ''Differential Therapeutics''<ref>{{cite book|last=Frances|first=Allen|title=Differential Therapeutics|year=1984|publisher=Bruner Meisel U|isbn=0876303602|pages=440|url=http://www.amazon.com/Differential-Therapeutics-Psychiatry-Allen-Frances/dp/0876303602}}</ref> tried to bring specificity and evidence to decisions on how best to match patient and treatment. His recognition of therapeutic limits resulted in the 1981 paper ''No Treatment as the Prescription of Choice.''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frances|first=Allen|coauthors=Clarkin,JF|title=No Treatment as the Prescription of Choice.|journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry|year=1981|month=May|volume=38|issue=5|pages=542–545|pmid=7235855|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7235855|accessdate=03/26/2012|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1980.01780300054006}}</ref> Dr Frances was the founding editor of two journals that have become standards: The [http://www.guilford.com/cgi-bin/cartscript_tmp.cgi?page=pr/jnpd.htm&dir=periodicals/per_psych Journal of Personality Disorders] and the [http://journals.lww.com/practicalpsychiatry/pages/default.aspx Journal of Psychiatric Practice]. And in 1991, he became Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at [[Duke University School of Medicine]] where he helped to expand the excellent research, training, and clinical programs that had been initiated by his predecessor as chair, Dr Bernard Carroll.
	 	
==The Diagnostic Manual of Mental Illnesses==
===DSM-IV===
The DSM provides definitions of mental disorders that are widely used to guide clinical practice, research, education, forensics, and eligibility for mental health treatment, school services, and disability benefits. Dr Frances helped to prepare [[DSM III]] (published in 1980), DSM III R (published in 1987); and was Chair of the Task Force that published [[DSM IV]] in 1994. The earlier DSM revisions had relied on expert opinion to create definitions of disorders. The [[DSM IV]] was a more conservative revision requiring that changes be justified by a high threshold of scientific evidence drawn from literature reviews, data reanalyses, and field testing. Of the ninety-four suggestions for new diagnoses, only two were accepted - [[Asperger's]] and [[Bipolar II]] Disorder. The DSM-IV Sourcebook<ref>{{cite book|title=DSM-IV&#174; Sourcebook DSM-IV® Sourcebook|year=1997|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|isbn=978-0-89042-073-7|pages=1085|url=http://www.appi.org/SearchCenter/Pages/SearchDetail.aspx?ItemId=2073}}</ref> documents the rationale and scientific support for all the decisions made. Minor updates in the explanatory text were added in 2000 ([[DSM-IV-TR]]).
	 
Despite its conservative intent and careful methodology, [[DSM-IV]] was not able to prevent diagnostic inflation. Rates of [[Attention Deficit Disorder]] tripled as a result of heavy drug company marketing starting in 1997 - instigated by the introduction of new on-patent drugs and facilitated by the removal of federal prohibitions against direct-to-consumer advertising. Rates of [[Autism]] increased by more than twenty fold largely because the loose diagnosis followed its becoming a prerequisite for extra school services. Rates of [[Bipolar Disorder]] doubled largely because of drug company marketing. And rates of [[Bipolar disorder in children]] increased by forty fold when thought leaders and drug companies convinced practitioners that temperamental kids had [[Bipolar Disorder]] even if they didn't have mood swings - a concept that had been rejected by [[DSM-IV]]. Dr. Frances later felt that [[DSM-IV]] should have fought more vigorously against the risks of diagnostic inflation by tightening diagnostic criteria and providing more specific warnings against over-diagnosis. Frances co-authored ''Am I Okay?: A Layman's Guide to the Psychiatrist's Bible'' with psychiatrist [[Michael First]].<ref name="first2000">Frances A, First MB (2000).

===DSM-5===
The next Revision [[DSM-5]] was initiated with a 2002 book (A Research Agenda for DSM-V<ref>{{cite book|last=Edited by David J. Kupfer, M.D., Michael B. First, M.D., and Darrel A. Regier, M.D., M.P.H.|title=A Research Agenda For DSM V A Research Agenda For DSM V|year=2002|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|isbn=978-0-89042-292-2|pages=336|url=http://www.appi.org/SearchCenter/Pages/SearchDetail.aspx?ItemId=2292}}</ref>) questioning the utility of the atheoretical, descriptive paradigm and suggesting a neuroscience research agenda aiming to develop a pathophysiologically based classification. After a series of symposiums, the Task Force began to work on the manual itself. In June 2008, Dr. Robert Spitzer who chaired the DSM-III and DSM-IIIR revisions had begun to write about the secrecy of the DSM-V Task Force (DSM-V: Open and Transparent?<ref>{{cite news|last=Spitzer|first=Robert|title=DSM-V: Open and Transparent?|url=http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/newsArticle.aspx?articleid=111945|accessdate=03/26/2013|newspaper=Psychiatric News|date=June 18, 2008}}</ref>). Dr. Frances initially declined to join Spitzer's criticism, but after learning about the changes being considered<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenberg|first=Gary|title=Inside the Battle to Define Mental Illness|url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/ff_dsmv/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=03/26/2013}}</ref>, he wrote an article in July 2009 (A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences<ref>{{cite news|last=Frances|first=Allen|title=A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/print/article/10168/1425378?printable=true|accessdate=03/26/2013|newspaper=Psychiatric Times|date=June 26, 2009}}</ref>) expressing multiple concerns including the unsupported paradigm shift, a failure to specify the level of empirical support needed for changes, their lack of openness, their ignoring the negative consequences of their proposals, a failure to meet timelines, and anticipate the coming time pressures. The APA/DSM-V Task Force response (Setting the Record Straight: A Response to Frances Commentary on DSM-V<ref>{{cite news|last=Schatzberg AF, Scully JH, Kupfer DJ, Regier DA|title=Setting the Record Straight: A Response to Frances Commentary on DSM-V|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1425806|accessdate=03/26/2013|newspaper=Psychiatric Times|date=July 1, 2009}}</ref>) dismissed his complaints.
	
In March 2010, Frances began a weekly blog in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', DSM-5 in Distress: The DSM's impact on mental health practice and research<ref>{{cite web|last=Frances|first=Allen|title=DSM5 in Distress: The DSM's impact on mental health practice and research|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=03/26/2013}}</ref>, often cross-posted in the Psychiatric Times<ref>{{cite web|last=Frances|first=Allen|title=Blog|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blog/frances|publisher=Psychiatric Times|accessdate=03/26/2013}}</ref> and the Huffington Post<ref>{{cite web|last=Frances|first=Allen|title=Blog|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-frances/|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=03/26/2013}}</ref>. While many of his blog posts were about the DSM-5 Task Force lowering the threshholds for diagnosing existing disorders ([[Attention Deficit Disorder]], [[Autism]], [[Addictions]], [[Personality Disorders]], [[Bipolar II Disorder]]), he was also disturbed by the addition of new speculative Disorders ([http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201003/dsm5-psychosis-risk-syndrome-far-too-risky Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome], [[Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder]], [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201212/mislabeling-medical-illness-mental-disorder Somatic Symptom Disorder]). He has argued that the diagnosis Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome promoted by advocates of early intervention for psychosis, such as Australian psychiatrist [[Patrick McGorry]],  is risky because of a high rate of inaccuracy, the potential to stigmatize young people given this label, the lack of any effective treatment, and the risk of children and adolescents being given dangerous antipsychotic medication<ref>Frances A. Psychosis risk syndrome--far too risky. Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2011 Oct;45(10):803-4.</ref>. The elimination of the [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201008/good-grief-vs-major-depressive-disorder Bereavement Exclusion] from the diagnosis of [[Major Depressive Disorder]] was another particular concern, threatening to label normal grief as a mental illness. So while the Task Force was focusing on early detection and treatment, Frances cautioned about diagnostic inflation, overmedication, and crossing [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201006/psychiatric-fads-and-overdiagnosis the boundary of normality]. Besides the original complaint that the DSM-5 Task Force was a closed process, Frances pointed out that they were behind schedule and even with a one year postponement, they had to drop a follow-up quality control step. He recommended further postponement and advocated asking an outside body to [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201111/dsm-5-needs-independent-scientific-review review] their work to make suggestions. While the American Psychiatric Association did have an internal review, they rejected his suggestion of an external consultation.

There were widespread threats of [http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/02/dsm-5-boycott-launched/ boycott].
	 	
Frances's writings were joined by a general criticism of the DSM-5 revision, ultimately resulting in a [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dsm5-in-distress/201110/psychologists-start-petition-against-dsm-5 petition] calling for outside review signed by 14,000 and sponsored by 56 mental health organizations. In the course of almost three years of blogging, Frances became a voice for more than just the specifics of the DSM-5 Diagnostic Manual. He spoke out against the overuse of psychiatric medications - particularly in children; a general trend towards global diagnostic inflation - pathologizing normality; the intrusion of the pharmaceutical industry into psychiatric practice; and a premature attempt to move psychiatry to an exclusively biological paradigm without scientific justification. Along the way, he wrote two books: "Saving Normal: An Insider's Revolt Against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life<ref>{{cite book|last=Frances|first=Allen|title=Saving Normal: An Insider's Revolt Against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life|year=2013|publisher=William Morrow|isbn=978-0062229250|pages=336|url=http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Normal-Out---Control-Medicalization/dp/0062229257/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1364609094&sr=8-1&keywords=Saving+Normal%3A+An+Insider%27s+Revolt+Against+Out-of-Control+Psychiatric+Diagnosis%2C+DSM-5%2C+Big+Pharma%2C+and+the+Medicalization+of+Ordinary+Life}}</ref>" and "Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis<ref>{{cite book|last=Frances|first=Allen|title=Essentials of Psychiatric Diagnosis|year=2013|publisher=The Guilford Press|isbn=978-1462510498|url=http://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Psychiatric-Diagnosis-Allen-Frances/dp/1462510493/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1364609402&sr=8-1&keywords=Essentials+of+Psychiatric+Diagnosis}}</ref>" meant to guide clinicians and to help curb unwarranted diagnostic exuberance.
