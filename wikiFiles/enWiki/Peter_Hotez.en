'''Dr. Peter J. Hotez''' is a scientist, pediatrician, and leading advocate and expert in the fields of global health, vaccinology, and [[Neglected Tropical Diseases|neglected tropical disease]] control. He serves as founding dean of the Baylor College of Medicine National School of [[Tropical medicine|Tropical Medicine]], chief of the new Section of [[Tropical medicine|Tropical Medicine]] in the BCM Department of [[Pediatrics]] and holds the Texas Children’s Hospital Endowed Chair in Tropical Pediatrics.<ref>http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7601893.html</ref> He is also President of the [[Sabin Vaccine Institute]], headquartered in Washington, DC; and leads the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. Recently, he was named the Fellow in Disease and Poverty at Baker Institute for Public Policy at the Rice University. 



== Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) Vaccine Research and Development ('the antipoverty vaccines') == 

As President of the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Director of its product development partnership (PDP) Hotez leads an international team of scientists working to develop vaccines to combat [[Hookworm|hookworm infection]], [[schistosomiasis]], and other infectious and neglected diseases, including [[Chagas disease]], [[leishmaniasis]], and [[SARS]].  These diseases are the most common infections of the world’s poorest people.  

Together with Philip K. Russell, Hotez founded the Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative (HHVI) in 1999,<ref>http://www.sabin.org/vaccine-development/vaccines/hookworm</ref> the first initiative of the Sabin Vaccine Institute PDP.  Innovations developed by [http://www.sabin.org/vaccine-development Sabin Vaccine Development]—funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and others—are sometimes referred to as “antipoverty vaccines” because of their impact on both global health and economic development. Antipoverty vaccines against hookworm are now in clinical trials in Brazil, while a new vaccine for schistosomiasis will soon undergo clinical testing.  The vaccines for Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and SARS are at an earlier stage of development, with support from the NIAID, NIH, Carlos Slim Health Institute, Southwest Electric Energy Medical Research Institute, and key individuals. 

The Sabin Vaccine Institute PDP develops new antipoverty vaccines jointly with innovative developing countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, with aspirations to extend these activities to the Middle East and Asia.  Hotez writes extensively about vaccine diplomacy, i.e., the opportunity of using vaccines as instruments of foreign policy and to promote global peace, especially among poor countries seeking nuclear weapons technology.<ref>http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/Vaccines+over+missiles/3265205/story.html</ref>{{dead link|date=August 2012}}.    


== Neglected Tropical Disease Policy and Advocacy == 

In addition to his R&D activities, Prof. Hotez is a leading global health advocate and policymaker in the area of neglected tropical diseases, with an emphasis on providing impoverished populations access to essential and existing medicines for neglected tropical diseases.  His 2005-06 papers in the Public Library of Science (PLOS) co-authored with thought leaders from the UK and WHO helped to consolidate the concept of the ‘NTDs’ and led to the implementation of “rapid impact packages” of essential medicines for the NTDs now reaching hundreds of millions of people in low income countries through support from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and other sources.  These activities helped to promote the establishment of the Global Network for NTDs, which Hotez co-founded in 2006 [[Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases|Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases (“Global Network”)]] with leading experts in the field.  The Global Network, launched at the Clinton Global Initiative and funded by the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], highlights the horrific health and educational effects of neglected tropical diseases and advocates for their control and elimination.  As a result of these activities, and the effort of public-private partnerships and NGOs, today more than 250 million people are receiving essential medicines for neglected tropical diseases.<ref>http://www.neglecteddiseases.gov/about/index.html</ref> 
  
Hotez is also the founding Editor-In-Chief of the ''[[Public Library of Science|Public Library of Science (PLoS) Neglected Tropical Diseases]]'', the first online open access medical journal focused exclusively on neglected tropical diseases.

His papers in PLOS NTDs on the [http://www.ploscollections.org/geopoliticsofntds Geopolitics of NTDs] provide a new framework for incorporating NTDs into U.S. foreign policy and helped to launch the concepts known as ‘vaccine diplomacy’.  More recently, Prof. Hotez is also expanding his efforts to take on NTDs among the poor living in the U.S. and other developed countries.  His 2008 PLOS NTDs paper on “Neglected infections in the United States of America” highlighted the hidden burden of NTDs in the American South while his 2012 op-ed piece in the New York Times, "Tropical Diseases: The New Plague of Poverty", emphasized the especially high burden of NTDs among the poor in Texas.  His work is leading to a new global health framework based on extreme poverty regardless of whether it occurs in low- and middle-income countries or industrialized nations.  Many of these concepts are articulated in his book “Forgotten People, Forgotten Diseases” ASM Press.

== National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine == 

His work among people with NTDs in Texas helped to lead to the establishment of the National School of Tropical Medicine (NSTM) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM).  It is the first school in the United States solely committed to addressing the world's most pressing tropical disease issues.

The vision of the NSTM is to harness the scientific horsepower of the Texas Medical Center and apply it toward solving global health problems affecting the world's poorest people. The NSTM believes that all lives have equal value, and there is an urgent need to address diseases that disproportionately affect the world’s poorest people – otherwise forgotten people with forgotten diseases.

The National School of Tropical Medicine provides training programs to allow a new cadre of health professionals to conduct innovative fundamental, translational and clinical research in the field of tropical medicine. The NSTM also offers clinical training for tropical diseases, providing the opportunity for students and health professionals to gain valuable hands-on experience to complement their research interests, course of study or profession.

In addition, programs to address the global health policy and advocacy of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). These are infectious and parasitic diseases that initiate and perpetuate poverty and suffering, worldwide. Signature programs develop the establishment of diplomas, certificates, workshops and graduate degrees in tropical medicine. NSTM will also launch a variety of basic and biotechnology educational programs to train a new generation of scientists and health professionals.
 


== Biography and Education ==

==Personal==
Hotez has a lifelong passion and interest in tropical diseases, which he said began when he first read the book, Microbe Hunters as a child.  He currently lives in the Montrose area of [[Houston]], [[Texas]] with his wife Ann and two of his four children (Rachel and Daniel).  His oldest son Matthew is a musician in Washington DC and his oldest daughter Emily is working towards her PhD in developmental psychology at City University of New York.
