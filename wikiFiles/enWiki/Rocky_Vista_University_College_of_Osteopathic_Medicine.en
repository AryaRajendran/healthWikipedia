===For-profit status===
RVUCOM is notable for being the first and only modern day [[For-profit education|for-profit]] medical school operating in the United States.  As such, its opening has generated controversy. Critics have raised concerns that a for-profit school will be beholden to investors, and lack credibility. Supporters say that the school will be held to the same academic and accreditation standards as other medical schools.<ref name=news>{{cite web|last=Croasdale|first=Myrle|title=First for-profit med school nears approval|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2007/10/01/prsc1001.htm|publisher=amed news|accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=forbes>{{cite news|last=Whelan|first=David|title=An Uncommon Practice|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0929/060.html|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=24 December 2011|date=29 September 2008}}</ref>
