The '''Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada''', more commonly referred to as the '''Krever Commission''' or '''Krever Inquiry''', was a [[Royal commission]] headed by Mr Justice Horace Krever established by the [[Canadian Government]] in October 1993. It was set up to investigate allegations that the system of [[government]], private, and  [[non-governmental organization]]s responsible for supplying [[blood]] and [[blood products]] to the health care system had allowed contaminated blood to be used.

== Background ==

Since the 1940s, the blood system had largely been the responsibility of the [[Canadian Red Cross|Canadian Red Cross Society]]. This independent charitable body supplied donated blood to hospitals or, if the blood was past its expiry date, gave it to [[Connaught Laboratories]], the major producer of blood products in Canada. Connaught had initially been a non-profit company operated by the [[University of Toronto]]; by the 1980s it had been sold into the private sector.

In the late 1970s a crisis emerged. Thousands of people were being infected with [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis C]]. It became apparent that inadequately screened blood, often coming from high risk populations, was entering the system.

== Recommendations ==
The Krever Report was tabled in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 26 November 1997. The Krever inquiry recommended the creation of [[Héma-Québec]] for Quebec and [[Canadian Blood Services]] for rest of the Canada, two agencies which would operate at arms-length from the federal government. It also made recommendations regarding compensation for persons who had received contaminated blood.
