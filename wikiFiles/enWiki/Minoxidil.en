'''Minoxidil''' is an antihypertensive [[vasodilator]] [[medication]]. It also slows or stops [[baldness|hair loss]] and promotes hair regrowth. Now off-patent, it is available [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] for the treatment of [[androgenic alopecia]]. Minoxidil must be used indefinitely for continued support of existing hair follicles and the maintenance of any experienced hair regrowth. It is marketed under many trade names, including '''Avacor Physician's Formulation''', '''Loniten''' (oral), '''Mintop''', '''Amexidil''', '''Rogaine''', '''Spectral.DNC''', and '''Vanarex'''. [[Kopexil]] is a [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of minoxidil missing the [[piperidine]] substituent.

==History==
Originally, minoxidil was used exclusively as an oral drug (with the trade name 'Loniten') to treat [[arterial hypertension|high blood pressure]]. However, it was discovered to have an interesting side effect: hair growth.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/minoxidil-oral/article.htm MINOXIDIL - ORAL (Loniten) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions | MedicineNet]</ref> Minoxidil may cause increased growth or darkening of fine body hairs, or in some cases, significant hair growth. When the medication is discontinued, the hair loss will return to normal rate within 30 to 60 days.  [[Upjohn|Upjohn Corporation]] produced a [[topical]] solution that contained 2% minoxidil to be used to treat baldness and hair loss, under the brand name Rogaine in the United States and Canada, and Regaine in Europe and the Asia-Pacific.  The patent on minoxidil expired February 11, 1996.  Treatments usually include a 5% concentration solution that is designed for men, and a 2% concentration solution for women. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca10.washburnlaw.edu/cases/2002/12/01-1509.htm|title=Grant v. Pharmacia & Upjohn Co.|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> While the drug is available in the [[United Kingdom]], it cannot be prescribed on the [[National Health Service|NHS]], so patients must either buy it over-the-counter or have a private prescription for it.<ref>Drug Tariff, retrieved 2009/04/11.</ref>

==Mechanism==
The mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood. Minoxidil contains the [[nitric oxide]] chemical ''[[Functional group|moiety]]'' and may act as a nitric oxide agonist. Similarly, minoxidil is a [[potassium channel opener]], causing [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] of cell membranes. Minoxidil is less effective when there is a large area of hair loss. In addition, its effectiveness has largely been demonstrated in younger men who have experienced hair loss for less than 5 years. Minoxidil use is indicated for central ([[Vertex (anatomy)|vertex]]) hair loss only.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scow | first1= DT|last2= Nolte| first2= RS |last3= Shaughnessy| first3= AF |title=Medical treatments for balding in men |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=2189–94 |year=1999 |month=April |pmid=10221304 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/0415/p2189.html }}</ref> Minoxidil is also a [[vasodilator]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-blood-pressure-medication/HI00057 Vasodilators | MayoClinic.com]</ref> Hypothetically, by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, it allows more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the follicle. This may cause follicles in the [[telogen phase]] to shed, which are then replaced by thicker hairs in a new [[anagen phase]].

==Side effects==
Common side effects of minoxidil include burning or irritation of the eye, itching, redness or irritation at the treated area, as well as unwanted hair growth elsewhere on the body. Users should stop treatment and seek medical attention right away if they experience any of the following serious side effects: severe allergic reactions (e.g. rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue), chest pain, dizziness, fainting, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), sudden and unexplained weight gain, or swelling of the hands and feet.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/sfx/rogaine-side-effects.html Rogaine Side Effects | Drugs.com]</ref>

[[Alcohol]] and [[propylene glycol]] present in some topical preparations may dry the scalp, resulting in [[dandruff]] and [[contact dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/407641 | title = Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis | accessdate = 2009-10-09 | publisher = Medscape.com}}</ref>  Some formulations of minoxidil substitute lipid Nanosomes in order to reduce [[contact dermatitis]] from the alcohol and propylene glycol vehicle.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Balakrishnan|first=Prabagar|coauthors=Srinivasan Shanmugam, Wong Seok Lee, et. al|title=Formulation and in vitro assessment of minoxidil Nanosomes for enhanced skin delivery|journal=International Journal of Phermaceutics|date=1|year=2009|month=February|volume=377|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2009.04.020|pmid=19394413|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19394413|accessdate=6/30/2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Padois|first=Karine|coauthors=Celine Cantieni, Valerie Bertholle, et. al|title=Solid lipid nanoparticles suspension versus commercial solutions for dermal delivery of minoxidil|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutics|date=16|year=2011|month=June|volume=416|pages=300–304|doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.06.014|pmid=21704140|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21704140|accessdate=6/30/2012}}</ref> 

Paradoxically, hair loss is a common side effect of minoxidil treatment.<ref>[http://www.rogaine.com/men/faq#question-9 FAQs | Rogaine]</ref> Manufacturers note that minoxidil-induced hair loss is a common side effect and describe the process as "shedding". Although this phenomenon demonstrates that minoxidil is indeed affecting hair follicles, manufacturers offer no guarantee that the new hair loss will be replaced with hair growth. The speculated reason for this shedding is the encouragement of hairs already in the telogen phase to shed early.

Side effects of ''oral'' minoxidil may include swelling of the face and extremities, rapid and irregular heartbeat, lightheadedness, cardiac lesions, and focal [[necrosis]] of the [[papillary muscle]] and subendocardial areas of the left ventricle.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/pro/minoxidil.html | title = Minoxidil Official FDA information, side effects and uses | publisher = Drugs.com}}</ref> There have been cases of allergic reactions to minoxidil or the non-active ingredient [[propylene glycol]], which is found in some topical minoxidil formulations.  [[Pseudoacromegaly]] is an extremely rare side effect reported with large doses of oral minoxidil.<ref>{{cite pmid|12789195}}</ref>

Another side effect of minoxidil is that of dry skin, dark under-eye circles, and skin redness. Studies have shown that minoxidil can cause collagen depletion as it is a lysyl hydroxylase inhibitor, an enzyme which is key in collagen production.<ref>http://www.springerlink.com/content/h002654567280556/</ref>

Minoxidil is highly toxic to [[cat]]s and may cause death with just inadvertent skin contact.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Camille DeClementi | coauthors = Keith L. Bailey, Spencer C. Goldstein, and Michael Scott Orser | title = Suspected toxicosis after topical administration of minoxidil in 2 cats | journal = Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care | year = 2004 | month = December | pages = 287–292 | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2004.04014.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.showcatsonline.com/x/minoxidil.shtml | title = Minoxidil Warning | accessdate = 2007-01-18 | publisher = ShowCatsOnline.com | quote = Very small amounts of Minoxidil can result [in] serious problems or death}}</ref>

==Application==
Minoxidil needs to be applied once or the recommended twice daily, and may  be used indefinitely for continued support of existing hair follicles and the maintenance of any experienced hair regrowth. To achieve maximum effect, the solution should be in contact with the scalp for at least 4 hours before allowing hair to get wet.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/minoxidil/article.htm minoxidil (Rogaine) - drug class, medical uses, medication side effects, and drug interactions by MedicineNet.com]</ref> Minoxidil stimulates hair follicles and growth, but does not reduce [[Dihydrotestosterone|DHT]] or the enzyme responsible for its accumulation around the hair follicle, [[5-alpha reductase]], which is the primary mediator of [[male pattern baldness]] in genetically susceptible individuals.<ref>[http://www.americanhairloss.org/men_hair_loss/causes_of_hair_loss.asp American Hair Loss Association | Men's Hair Loss | Causes of Hair Loss]</ref> Therefore, when treatment is stopped, the [[Dihydrotestosterone|DHT]] has its expected effect of shrinking and ultimately destroying the genetically predisposed hair follicles.
