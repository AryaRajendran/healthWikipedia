[[File:Monosodium glutamate crystals.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Crystalline sodium glutamate]]
'''Glutamic acid''' and its [[ion]]s and [[salt]]s, called '''glutamates''', are [[flavor enhancer|flavor-enhancing compounds]] which provide an [[umami]] (savory) taste to food. Glutamic acid is a natural constituent of many [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] or aged foods, including [[soy sauce]], [[fermented bean paste]], and [[cheese]], and is also a component of [[hydrolyzed protein]] such as [[yeast extract]]. The sodium salt of glutamic acid, [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG), is a widely used additive in the [[food industry]].

==Glutamic acid versus glutamate==
When glutamic acid or one of its salts is dissolved in aqueous [[solution]]s, a [[pH]]-dependent instantaneous [[chemical equilibrium]] of the amino acid's ionized forms, including [[zwitterion]]ic forms, will result. These ions are called ''glutamates''. [[Salt (chemistry)|Salt]]s exist only in a dry and crystallized form. The form ultimately responsible for the taste is the glutamate ion, and the form of glutamic acid at the time of the addition is not important. However, crystalline glutamic acid salts such as monosodium glutamate dissolve much better and faster than crystalline glutamic acid, a property important for use as a flavor enhancer.

==Discovery==
Although they occur naturally in many foods, the flavor contributions made by glutamic acid and other amino acids were only scientifically identified early in the twentieth century. The substance was discovered and identified in the year 1866, by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Leopold Ritthausen. In 1907 Japanese researcher [[Kikunae Ikeda]] of the [[Tokyo Imperial University]] identified brown crystals left behind after the evaporation of a large amount of [[kombu]] broth as glutamic acid. These crystals, when tasted, reproduced the ineffable but undeniable flavor he detected in many foods, most especially in seaweed. Professor Ikeda termed this flavor [[umami]]. He then patented a method of mass-producing a crystalline salt of glutamic acid, monosodium glutamate.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/story/0,,1522368,00.html |title = If MSG is so bad for you, why doesn't everyone in Asia have a headache? | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''| last = Renton | first = Alex | date = 2005-07-10| accessdate= 2008-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.jpo.go.jp/seido_e/rekishi_e/kikunae_ikeda.htm | title = Kikunae Ikeda Sodium Glutamate | date= 2002-10-07 | accessdate = 2008-11-21| publisher = [[Japan Patent Office]]}}</ref>

However, 5% or more of the glutamate may be the <small>D</small>-enantiomer. Nonfermented naturally-occurring foods have lower relative levels of <small>D</small>-glutamate than fermented products.<ref name="D-Glutamate" />

==Taste perception==
Glutamic acid stimulates specific receptors located in [[taste bud]]s such as the [[amino acid]] receptor T1R1/T1R3 or other [[glutamate receptor]]s like the metabotropic receptors ([[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4|mGluR4]] and [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1|mGluR1]]) which induce the taste known as [[umami]], one of the five [[basic tastes]] (the word ''umami'' is a [[loanword]] from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]; it is also referred to as "savory" or "meaty").

==Sources==

===Natural occurrence===

[[Glutamate]] itself is a widespread amino acid. It is found naturally in all living cells, primarily in the bound form as part of [[protein]]s. Only a fraction of the glutamate in foods is in its "free" form, and only free glutamate can enhance the flavor of foods. Part of the flavor-enhancing effect of [[tomato]]es, fermented [[soy]] products, [[yeast extract]]s, certain sharp cheeses, and fermented or [[hydrolyzed protein]] products (such as soy sauce and [[fermented bean paste]]) is due to the presence of free glutamate ions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

====Asia====
Japanese cuisine originally used [[dashi|broth]] made from kombu ([[kelp]]) to bring up the [[umami]] taste in soups. Manufacturers, such as [[Ajinomoto]], use selected strains of ''[[Micrococcus|Micrococcus glutamicus]]'' [[bacteria]] in a nutrient-rich medium.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}<!-- mischaracterization: I think they use a specially modified bacteria for fermentation, but it needs a source in any case --> The bacteria are selected for their ability to excrete glutamic acid, which is then separated from the nutrient medium and processed into its sodium salt, monosodium glutamate.

====Rome====
In the [[Roman Empire]] glutamic acid was found in a sauce called [[garum]], made from fermenting fish in saltwater. It was used so widely that it has been called the "[[ketchup]]" of the ancient Romans.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} The flavor enhancing properties of glutamic acid allowed Romans to reduce the use of expensive salt.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fish Sauce Used to Date Pompeii Eruption|author=Rossella Lorenzi|publisher=Discovery News|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/09/29/pompeii-fish-sauce.html|date=Sept. 29, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Roman Empire Fish Sauce Garum|author=K.

===Hydrolyzed protein===
[[Hydrolyzed protein]]s, or protein hydrolysates, are acid- or enzymatically treated proteins from certain foods. One example is [[yeast extract]]. Hydrolyzed protein contains free amino acids, such as glutamate, at levels of 5% to 20%. Hydrolyzed protein is used in the same manner as monosodium glutamate in many foods, such as canned vegetables, soups, and processed meats.

==Safety as a flavor enhancer==
<span id="Chinese restaurant syndrome"></span>

In April 1968, Robert Ho Man Kwok wrote a letter to the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', coining the term "'''Chinese restaurant syndrome'''". In this letter he claimed:

<blockquote>I have experienced a strange syndrome whenever I have eaten out in a [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]], especially one that served northern Chinese food. The syndrome, which usually begins 15 to 20 minutes after I have eaten the first dish, lasts for about two hours, without hangover effect. The most prominent symptoms are numbness at the back of the neck, gradually radiating to both arms and the back, general weakness and palpitations...<ref>{{cite journal

The [[syndrome]] is often abbreviated as ''CRS'' and also became known under the names "Chinese food syndrome" and "monosodium glutamate symptom complex."

Symptoms attributed to the Chinese restaurant syndrome are rather common and unspecific.

While many people believe that [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) is the cause of these symptoms, an association has never been demonstrated under rigorously controlled conditions, even in studies with people who were convinced that they were sensitive to the compound.<ref name="Tarasoff">

===Timeline===
In 1959, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) classified monosodium glutamate as [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opascogd.html|title=Database of Select Committee on GRAS Substances (SCOGS) Reviews|accessdate=2008-03-22|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref> This action stemmed from the 1958 Food Additives Amendment to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] that required premarket approval for new food additives and led the FDA to promulgate regulations listing substances, such as monosodium glutamate, which have a history of safe use or are otherwise GRAS.

Since 1970, FDA has sponsored extensive reviews on the safety of monosodium glutamate, other glutamates, and hydrolyzed proteins, as part of an ongoing review of safety data on GRAS substances used in processed foods. One such review was by the [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]] (FASEB) Select Committee on GRAS Substances. In 1980, the committee concluded that monosodium glutamate was safe at current levels of use but recommended additional evaluation to determine monosodium glutamate's safety at significantly higher levels of consumption. Additional reports attempted to look at this.

In 1986, FDA's Advisory Committee on [[Hypersensitivity]] to Food Constituents concluded that monosodium glutamate poses no threat to the general public but that reactions of brief duration might occur in some people. Other reports have given the following findings:

* The 1987 Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]] and the [[World Health Organization]] placed monosodium glutamate in the safest category of food ingredients.
* A 1991 report by the [[European Commission|European Community's]] (EC) [[Directorate-General of the Joint Research Centre (European Commission)|Scientific Committee for Foods]] reaffirmed monosodium glutamate's safety and classified its "acceptable daily intake" as "not specified", the most favorable designation for a food ingredient. In addition, the EC Committee said, "Infants, including prematures, have been shown to metabolize glutamate as efficiently as adults and therefore do not display any special susceptibility to elevated oral intakes of glutamate."{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Legislation in effect since 06/01/2013, classifies glutamic acid and glutamates as salt substitutes and seasonings and condiments<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Additives Database|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco_foods/main/index.cfm?event=substance.view&identifier=273|publisher=DG Sanco, Bruxelles|author=European Community}}</ref> with a maximum level of consumption of 10 g/kg expressed as glutamic acid.<ref>{{cite web|title=COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1129/2011|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:354:0034:0050:EN:PDF|publisher=European Community}}</ref>

===Excitotoxicity===
{{Main|Excitotoxicity}}

Because glutamate is absorbed very quickly in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] (unlike glutamic acid-containing proteins in foods), glutamate could spike [[blood plasma]] levels of glutamate.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Stegink LD, Filer LJ Jr, Baker GL | title= Plasma glutamate concentrations in adult subjects ingesting monosodium L-glutamate in consomme | journal= American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | year=1985 | volume=42 |issue=2 | pages=220–225 |pmid=2862786 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Stegink LD, Filer LJ Jr, Baker GL | title=Plasma amino acid concentrations in normal adults ingesting aspartame and monosodium L-glutamate as part of a soup/beverage meal | journal=Metabolism | year=1987 | volume=36 | issue=11 | pages= 1073–1079 | doi=10.1016/0026-0495(87)90028-X| pmid=3670074 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Himwich WA, Petersen IM | title=Ingested sodium glutamate and plasma levels of glutamic acid | journal=Journal of Applied Physiology | year=1954 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages= 196–199 |pmid=13211498 }}</ref> Glutamic acid is in a class of chemicals known as [[excitotoxin]]s, high levels of which have been shown in [[Animal testing|animal studies]] to cause damage to areas of the brain unprotected by the [[blood–brain barrier]] and that a variety of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic diseases]] can arise out of this [[neurotoxicity]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Meldrum B | title=Amino acids as dietary excitotoxins: a contribution to understanding neurodegenerative disorders | journal= Brain research.

At a meeting of the [[Society for Neuroscience]] in 1990, the delegates had a split opinion on the issues related to neurotoxic effects from excitotoxic amino acids found in some additives such as monosodium glutamate.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Barinaga, M | title=Amino acids: How much excitement is too much? | journal= Science | year=1990 | volume=247 | issue=4938 | pages= 20–22 | doi=10.1126/science.2294587 | pmid=2294587 }}</ref>

Some scientists believe that humans and other primates are not as susceptible to excitotoxins as rodents and therefore there is little concern with glutamic acid as a food additive.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Abraham R, Swart J, Golberg L, Coulston F | title=Electron microscopic observations of hypothalami in neonatal rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) after administration of monosodium-L-glutamate | journal= Experimental and molecular pathology | year=1975 | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages= 203–213 | doi=10.1016/0014-4800(75)90018-0 | pmid=810365 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Reynolds WA, Butler V, Lemkey-Johnston N | title=Hypothalamic morphology following ingestion of aspartame or MSG in the neonatal rodent and primate: a preliminary report | journal= Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health | year=1976 | volume=2 | issue=2 | pages= 471–480 |pmid=827619 | doi=10.1080/15287397609529448 }}</ref> While they agree that the combined effects of all food-based excitotoxins should be considered,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Stegink LD, Filer LJ Jr, Baker GL | title=Effect of aspartame plus monosodium L-glutamate ingestion on plasma and erythrocyte amino acid levels in normal adult subjects fed a high protein meal | journal= American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | year=1982 | volume=36 | issue=6 | pages= 1145–1152 | pmid=7148735 }}</ref> their measurements of the blood plasma levels of glutamic acid after ingestion of monosodium glutamate and [[aspartame]] demonstrate that there is not a cause for concern.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Stegink LD, Filer LJ Jr, Baker GL | title=Plasma and erythrocyte amino acid levels in normal adult subjects fed a high protein meal with and without added monosodium glutamate | journal= Journal of Nutrition | year=1982 | volume=112 | issue=10 | pages= 1953–1160 | pmid=7119898}}</ref>Moreover, high blood plasma levels of glutamate are not indicative of increased brain levels; the blood brain barrier is highly effective at preventing glutamate entry into the brain as well as facilitating removal of glutamate from central nervous tissues.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hawkins RA | title=The blood-brain barrier and glutamate. | journal= The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | year=2009 | volume=90 | issue=3 | pages=867S-874S | pmid=19571220}}</ref>

==Regulations==

===European Union===

Following the compulsory EU-food labeling law the use of glutamic acid and its salts has to be declared, and the name or [[E number]] of the salt has to be listed. Glutamic acid and its salts as food additives have the following E numbers: [[glutamic acid]]: E620, [[monosodium glutamate]]: E621, [[monopotassium glutamate]]: E622, [[calcium diglutamate]]: E623, [[monoammonium glutamate]]: E624, and [[magnesium diglutamate]]: E625. In the European Union, these enhancers are not allowed to be added to milk, emulsified fat and oil, pasta, cocoa/chocolate products and fruit juice. The EU did not yet publish an official [[NOAEL]] (no observable adverse effect level) for glutamate, but a 2006 consensus statement of a group of German experts drawing from animal studies was that a daily intake of glutamic acid of 6&nbsp;grams per kilogram of body weight (6&nbsp;g/kg/day) is safe. From human studies, the experts noted that doses as high as 147 g/day produced no adverse effects in males when given for 30 days; in a 70&nbsp;kg male that corresponds to 2.1&nbsp;g per kg of body weight.<ref name=ejcn07>{{cite journal |author=Beyreuther K, Biesalski HK, Fernstrom JD, ''et al.'' |title=Consensus meeting: monosodium glutamate - an update |journal=[[Eur J Clin Nutr]] |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=304–13 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=16957679 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602526}}</ref>

===United States===
In 1959, the Food and Drug Administration classified MSG as a "generally recognized as safe" ([[GRAS]]) food ingredient under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. In 1986, FDA's Advisory Committee on Hypersensitivity to Food Constituents also found that MSG was generally safe, but that short-term reactions may occur in some people. To further investigate this matter, in 1992 the FDA contracted the [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]] (FASEB) to produce a detailed report, which was published in 1995. The FASEB report reaffirmed the safety of MSG when it is consumed at usual levels by the general population, and found no evidence of any connection between MSG and any serious long-term reactions.<ref name=fda03/>

Under 2003 [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] regulations, when monosodium glutamate is added to a food, it must be identified as "monosodium glutamate" in the label's ingredient list. Because glutamate is commonly found in food, primarily from protein sources, the FDA does not require foods and ingredients that contain glutamate as an inherent component to list it on the label. Examples include tomatoes, cheeses, meats, [[hydrolyzed protein]] products such as soy sauce, and [[autolyzed yeast]] extracts. These ingredients are to be declared on the label by their common or usual names.<ref name=fda03>{{cite journal

}}</ref>  The term 'natural flavor' is now used by the food industry when using glutamic acid.  Because of lack of regulation, it is impossible to determine what percentage of 'natural flavor' is actually glutamic acid.

The food additives [[disodium inosinate]] and [[disodium guanylate]] are usually used in synergy with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients, and provide a likely indicator of the addition of glutamate to a product.

As of 2002 the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] Committee on Dietary Reference Intakes had not set a [[NOAEL]] or [[LOAEL]] for glutamate.<ref name=ejcn07/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10490&page=589 |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients) |publisher=Nap.edu |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>

===Australia and New Zealand===
Standard 1.2.4 of the Australia [[New Zealand]] Food Standards Code requires the presence of monosodium glutamate as a food additive to be labeled. The label must bear the food additive class name (e.g. flavor enhancer), followed by either the name of the food additive (e.g. MSG) or its International Numbering System (INS) number (e.g. 621)

===Canada===
The Canada Food Inspection Agency considers claims of "no MSG" or "MSG free" to be misleading and deceptive when other sources of free glutamates are present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch4e.shtml#a4_3_3 |title=Canadian Food Inspection Agency - Chapter 4 - Composition, Quality, Quantity and Origin Claims Sections 4.1-4.6 |publisher=Inspection.gc.ca |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref>
