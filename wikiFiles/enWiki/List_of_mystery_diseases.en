A '''mystery disease''' is a [[disease]] that has not yet been identified. Reasons for lack of identification of [[etiology]] include lack of professional interest, difficult access, and lack of resources, in addition to being unknown to medicine. The following is a list of deadly diseases of which the exact cause is unknown, separated into long-standing and new:
