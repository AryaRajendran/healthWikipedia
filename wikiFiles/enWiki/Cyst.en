A '''cyst''' is a closed sac, having a distinct [[biological membrane|membrane]] and [[cell division|division]] compared to the nearby [[Biological tissue|tissue]]. It may contain [[air]], fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of [[pus]] is called an [[abscess]], not a cyst. Once formed, a cyst could go away on its own or may have to be removed through [[surgery]].

== Types ==
* [[Acne]] cyst – Pseudocysts associated with [[cystic acne]]. Actually an inflammatory nodule with or without an associated epidermoid inclusion cyst.

===Cystic fibrosis===
Despite being described in 1938 as the [[microscopic]] appearance of cysts in the pancreas,<ref name=Anderson1938>{{cite journal | author = Anderson, D.H. | year = 1938 | title = Cyst leiesic fibrosis of the pancreas and its relation to celiac disease | journal = Am J Dis Child | volume = 56 | pages = 344–399}}</ref> [[cystic fibrosis]] is an example of a [[genetic disorder]] whose name is related to fibrosis of the [[cystic duct]] and does not involve actual cysts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Greenholz SK, Krishnadasan B, Marr C, Cannon R |title=Biliary obstruction in infants with cystic fibrosis requiring Kasai portoenterostomy |journal=J.

== Cystic neoplasm ==
Most cysts in the body are [[Benign tumor|benign]] (dysfunctional) tumors, the result of plugged ducts or other natural body outlets for secretions.  However sometimes these masses are considered [[neoplasm]]:
* [[Dermoid cyst]]
* [[Keratocystic odontogenic tumor]]
* [[Calcifying odontogenic cyst]]

==Treatment==
Treatment ranges from simple [[enucleation (surgery)|enucleation]] of the cyst to [[curettage]] to [[Segmental resection|resection]]. There are cysts, e.g. [[buccal bifurcation cyst]] with self-resolation nature, in which close observation only can be employed unless the cyst is [[infection|infected]] and [[symptomatic]].<ref name="BBC">{{cite journal |author= Zadik Y, Yitschaky O, Neuman T, Nitzan DW |title=On the Self-Resolution Nature of the Buccal Bifurcation Cyst |journal=J Oral Maxillofac Surg |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=e15 |year=2011 |month=May |pmid=21571416 |doi=10.1016/j.joms.2011.02.124|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WKF-52VP3D1-6&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F14%2F2011&_rdoc=9&_fmt=high&_orig=browse&_origin=browse&_zone=rslt_list_item&_srch=doc-info(%23toc%236905%239999%23999999999%2399999%23FLA%23display%23Articles)&_cdi=6905&_sort=d&_docanchor=&_ct=207&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=47e40681e02990c1d46b7f818fe30630&searchtype=a}}</ref>

==Related structures==
A [[pseudocyst]] is collection without a distinct membrane.

A [[syrinx (medicine)|syrinx]] in the [[spinal cord]] or [[brainstem]] is sometimes inaccurately referred to as a cyst.
