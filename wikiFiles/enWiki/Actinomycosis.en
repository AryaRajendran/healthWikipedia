'''Actinomycosis''' is an [[infectious disease|infectious]] [[bacteria]]l disease caused by ''[[Actinomyces]]'' species<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000001327|actinomycosis}}</ref> such as ''[[Actinomyces israelii]] ''<ref>{{cite web|title=Actinomycosis|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001625/|work=A.D.A.M Medical Encyclopedia|publisher=pubMed Health|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> or ''[[Actinomyces gerencseriae|A. gerencseriae]]''. It can also be caused by ''[[Propionibacterium propionicus]]'', and the condition is likely to be [[polymicrobial]] aerobic [[anaerobic infection]].<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = Bowden GHW | title = Actinomycosis ''in:'' Baron's Medical Microbiology ''(Baron S ''et al.'', eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | id = [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.1883 (via NCBI Bookshelf)] | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 }}</ref>

==In animals==
{{main|Actinomycosis in animals}}
Actinomycosis occurs rarely in humans but rather frequently in [[cattle]] as a disease called ''lumpy jaw''. This name refers to the large [[abscess]]es that grow on the head and neck of the infected animal. It can also affect swine, horses, and dogs, and less often wild animals and sheep.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The disease is characterized by the formation of painful [[abscess]]es in the [[mouth]], [[lungs]],<ref>Brook I. Actinomycosis: diagnosis and management. South Med J.2008;101:1019-23.</ref><ref name="Mabeza">{{cite journal | last=Mabeza | first=GF | coauthors= Macfarlane J | title=Pulmonary actinomycosis | journal=European Respiratory Journal | volume=21 | issue=3 | pages=545–551 | publisher=ERS Journals Ltd. | date=March 2003 | url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/content/full/21/3/545 | pmid=12662015 | accessdate=2008-07-21 | doi=10.1183/09031936.03.00089103 }}</ref> or [[gastrointestinal tract]].<ref name=Baron/> Actinomycosis abscesses grow larger as the disease progresses, often over months. In severe cases, they may penetrate the surrounding bone and muscle to the skin, where they break open and leak large amounts of [[pus]], which often contains characteristic granules (sulfur granules). The purulent leakage via the [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus cavities]] contains "sulfur granules," not actually sulfur-containing but resembling such particles. These granules contain progeny bacteria. Sometimes there is difficulty in making the correct diagnosis. In addition to microbiological examinations [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and immunological blood analyses may also be helpful.<ref>Böhm I et al.

Actinomycosis is primarily caused by any of several members of the bacterial [[genus]] ''[[Actinomyces]]''. These bacteria are generally [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobes]].<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> In animals, they normally live in the small spaces between the teeth and gums, causing infection only when they can multiply freely in [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxic]] environments. An affected human often has recently had [[Dentistry|dental work]], poor [[oral hygiene]], [[periodontal disease]], [[radiation therapy]], or trauma (broken jaw) causing local tissue damage to the [[oral mucosa]], all of which predispose the person to developing actinomycosis. They are also normal [[commensals]] in the [[caecum]]; thus, abdominal actinomycosis can occur following removal of the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]]. The three most common sites of infection are decayed teeth, the lungs, and the [[intestines]]. It is important to note that actinomycosis does not occur in isolation from other bacteria. This infection depends on other bacteria (gram positive, gram negative, and [[cocci]]) to aid in invasion of tissue.

==Treatment==
''Actinomyces'' bacteria are generally sensitive to [[penicillin]], which is frequently used to treat actinomycosis. In cases of penicillin allergy, [[doxycyclin]] is used.
[[Sulfonamide (medicine)|Sulfonamides]] such as sulfamethoxazole may be used as an alternative regimen at a total daily dosage of 2-4&nbsp;grams.  Response to therapy is slow and may take months.

==Epidemiology==
There is a greater disease incidence in males between the ages of 20 and 60 years than in females.<ref name="fitzp">{{cite book | author=Wolff K, Goldsmith L A, Katz S, Gilchrist B A, Paller A, and Leffell D J | title=Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine, 7th Ed. | publisher=McGraw Hill | year=2007}}</ref> Before antibiotic treatments became available, the incidence in the Netherlands and Germany was 1 per 100,000&nbsp;people/year. Incidence in the U.S. in the 1970s was 1 per 300,000&nbsp;people/year, while in Germany in 1984, it was estimated to be 1 per 40,000&nbsp;people/year.<ref name="fitzp"/> The use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) has increased incidence of genitourinary actinomycosis in females.<!-- too many citations?: ref name="fitzp"/> --> Incidence of oral actinomycosis, which is harder to diagnose, has increased.<ref name="fitzp"/>

==History==
In 1877, [[pathologist]] [[Otto Bollinger]] described the presence of ''Actinomyces bovis'' in cattle, and shortly afterwards, [[James Israel]] discovered ''Actinomyces israelii'' in humans. In 1890, [[Eugen Bostroem]] isolated the causative organism from a culture of grain, grasses, and soil. After Bostroem's discovery there was a general misconception that actinomycosis was a [[mycosis]] that affected individuals who chewed grass or straw.

Violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] died of actinomycosis.
