==Questions to include==
Different sources include different questions to be asked while conducting a PMH, but in general, they include the following: 

* '''General state of health''': e.g. excellent, good, fair, poor. Note any significant change from previous state.
* '''Past [[illnesses]]''': e.g. [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]].
* '''[[Hospital]]izations''': including all [[medical]], [[surgical]], and [[psychiatric]] hospitalizations. Note the date, reason, duration for the hospitalization.
* '''[[Injuries]]''', or [[accidents]]: note the type and date of injury.
* '''[[Surgeries]]''': note the type of procedure, date, hospital, surgeon, and any complications.
* '''Current medications''': note name, dosage, frequency of any medication, including any over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies. Note whether patient is taking the medications according to the prescribed instructions.

==Medicare definitions==
The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]]<ref>http://www.cms.hhs.gov/</ref> has published criteria for what constitutes a reimbursable PMH. A PMH is considered one of three elements of the "Past, Family, and Social History" (abbreviated as PFSH):<ref>[http://www.emrconsultant.com/emr_EMcoding.php Evaluation and Management Coding and Electronic Health Records]</ref> 

* Past medical history: "the patient's past experiences with illnesses, operations, injuries and treatments";
* [[Family history (medicine)|Family history]]: "a review of medical events in the patient's family, including diseases which may be hereditary or place the patient at risk";
* [[Social history (medicine)|Social history]]: "an age-appropriate review of past and current activities".

A '''pertinent''' PFSH consists of at least one of the three components; a '''full''' PFSH consists of two or three components for an established patient, or all three components for a new patient visit.<ref>[http://www.emrconsultant.com/emr_EMcoding.php Evaluation and Management Coding and Electronic Health Records]</ref>
