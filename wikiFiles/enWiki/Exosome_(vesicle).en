In the reticulocyte, as in most mammalian cells, portions of the plasma membrane are regularly internalized as endosomes, with 50 to 180% of the plasma membrane being recycled every hour.<ref>{{cite pmid|21878991}}</ref> In turn, parts of the membranes of some endosomes are subsequently internalized as smaller vesicles. Such endosomes are called [[Endosome#Multivesicular body|multivesicular bodies]] because of their appearance, with many small vesicles, or "intralumenal endosomal vesicles," inside the larger body.

Exosomes contain various molecular constituents of their cell of origin, including proteins and RNA. Although the exosomal protein composition varies with the cell and tissue of origin, most exosomes contain an evolutionary-conserved common set of protein molecules. The RNA molecules in exosomes include [[mRNA]] and [[miRNA]]. One study suggested that miRNAs in exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are predominantly pre- and not mature miRNAs.<ref>{{cite journal

Scientists are actively researching the role that exosomes may play in cell-to-cell signaling, hypothesizing that because exosomes can merge with and release their contents into cells that are distant from their cell of origin, they may influence processes in the recipient cell. For example, RNA that is shuttled from one cell to another, known as "exosomal shuttle RNA," could potentially affect protein production in the recipient cell.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/ncomms1180}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

Currently, there are no proven mechanisms by which microvesicles trigger intercellular communication. Possible mechanisms by which microvesicles trigger intercellular communication are paracrine, fusion and phagocytosis.

==Terminology==
Because of the multidisciplinary research field, detection and isolation difficulties, and different ways of classification,
there is currently no consensus about the nomenclature of cell-derived vesicles including exosomes<ref name=vanderPol2012></ref>. Consequently, exosomes are also referred to as [[microvesicles]], epididimosomes, argosomes, exosome-like vesicles, microparticles, promininosomes, prostasomes, dexosomes, texosomes, dex, tex, archeosomes and oncosomes.<ref>{{cite journal

==Research==
Exosomes from [[red blood cell]]s contain the [[transferrin receptor]] which is absent in mature erythrocytes. [[Dendritic cell]]-derived exosomes express [[MHC I]], [[MHC II]], and costimulatory molecules and have been proven to be able to induce and enhance antigen-specific [[T cell]] responses ''in vivo''. In addition, the first exosome-based [[cancer]] [[vaccination]] platforms are being explored in early [[clinical trials]].<ref>{{cite journal

==Detection==
The isolation and detection of exosomes has proven to be extremely difficult.<ref name=vanderPol2012></ref> On the one hand, due to the complexity of body fluids, physical separation of exosomes from cells and similar sized particles is challenging. On the other hand, since the diameter of exosomes is typically below 100 nm and because they have a low [[refractive index]], exosomes are below the detection range of many currently used techniques. Often, functional as well as antigenic assays are applied to derive useful information from multiple exosomes. Well known examples of assays to detect proteins in total populations of exosomes are [[mass spectroscopy]] and [[Western blot]]. However, a limitation of these methods is that contaminants may be present that affect the information obtained from such assays. Preferably, information is derived from single exosomes. Relevant properties of exosomes to detect include size, density, morphology, composition, and [[zeta potential]].<ref name=vanderPol2010>{{cite journal
