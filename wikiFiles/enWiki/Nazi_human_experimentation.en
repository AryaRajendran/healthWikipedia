'''Nazi human experimentations''' were a series of [[human experimentation|medical experiments]] on large numbers of prisoners, mainly Jews (including Jewish children) from across Europe, but also in some cases [[Roma_(Romani_subgroup)| Roma]], [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs| Soviet POWs]] and disabled non-Jewish Germans, by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German regime]] in its [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] mainly in the early 1940s, during [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. Prisoners were [[coercion|coerced]] into participating; they did not willingly volunteer and there was never [[informed consent]]. Typically, the experiments resulted in death, [[disfigurement]] or permanent [[disability]], and as such are considered as examples of [[medical torture]]. At [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and other camps, under the direction of [[Eduard Wirths|Dr. Eduard Wirths]], selected inmates were subjected to various hazardous experiments which were designed to help German military personnel in combat situations, develop new weapons, aid in the recovery of military personnel that had been injured, and to advance the racial ideology backed by the [[Third Reich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005168 |title=Nazi Medical Experimentation |accessdate=23 March 2008 |work=US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}</ref> [[Aribert Heim|Dr. Aribert Heim]] conducted similar medical experiments at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]. [[Carl Vaernet|Carl Værnet]] is known to have conducted experiments on homosexual prisoners in attempts to [[Conversion therapy|cure]] homosexuality. After the war, these crimes were tried at what became known as the [[Doctors' Trial]], and revulsion at the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the [[Nuremberg Code]] of [[medical ethics]].

==Experiments==
According to the indictments at the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Medical Experiment |work=Jewish Virtual Library |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/medtoc.html |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Doctors Trial: The Medical Case of the Subsequent Nuremberg Proceedings |work=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=http://www.ushmm.org/research/doctors/indiptx.htm |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref> these experiments included the following:

===Experiments on twins===
Experiments on twin children in concentration camps were created to show the similarities and differences in the [[genetics]] of twins, as well as to see if the human body can be unnaturally manipulated. The central leader of the experiments was [[Josef Mengele]], who from 1943 to 1944 performed experiments on nearly 1,500 sets of imprisoned twins at Auschwitz. About 200 individuals survived these studies.<ref>[http://www.longwood.k12.ny.us/lhs/science/mos/twins/mengele.html Josef Mengele and Experimentation on Human Twins at Auschwitz], ''Children of the Flames; Dr. Josef Mengele and the Untold Story of the Twins of Auschwitz'', Lucette Matalon Lagnado and Sheila Cohn Dekel, and ''Mengele: the Complete Story'' by Gerald Posner and John Ware.</ref> The twins were arranged by age and sex and kept in [[barracks]] between experiments, which ranged from injection of different dyes into the eyes of twins to see whether it would change their color to literally sewing twins together in attempts to create [[conjoined twins]].<ref name="WEAK">{{cite book |last=Black |first=Edwin |title=War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qfliJPdl9V4C&pg=PA358&lpg=PA358&dq=mengele+conjoined+sew&source=web&ots=YCXtN_WdTt&sig=jvObL5km02rlette5vbexaDBrFc&hl=en |accessdate=14 April 2008  |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location=United States |isbn=1-56858-258-7}}</ref><ref name=Berenbaum194>{{cite book |author=Berenbaum, Michael |title=The world must know: the history of the Holocaust as told in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1993 |pages=194–5 |isbn=0-316-09134-0 |oclc= }}</ref>

===Bone, muscle, and nerve transplantation experiments===
From about September 1942 to about December 1943 experiments were conducted at the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]], for the benefit of the German Armed Forces, to study [[bone]], [[muscle]], and [[nerve]] [[regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], and bone transplantation from one person to another. {{Reference necessary|text=Sections of bones, muscles, and nerves were removed from the subjects without use of [[anesthesia]].|date=March 2013}} As a result of these operations, many victims suffered intense agony, mutilation, and permanent disability.

===Head injury experiments===
In mid-1942 in [[Baranowicze]], occupied Poland, experiments were conducted in a small building behind the private home occupied by a known Nazi [[SD Security Service]] officer, in which "a young boy of eleven or twelve [was] strapped to a chair so he could not move. Above him was a mechanized hammer that every few seconds came down upon his head." The boy was driven insane from the torture.<ref name=Small>Small, Martin; Vic Shayne.

Another study placed prisoners naked in the open air for several hours with temperatures as low as −6 °C (21 °F). Besides studying the physical effects of cold exposure, the experimenters also assessed different methods of rewarming survivors.<ref name=Bogod>Bogod, David.

The [[freezing]]/hypothermia experiments were conducted for the [[Nazi]] high command to simulate the conditions the armies suffered on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], as the German forces were ill-prepared for the cold weather they encountered. Many experiments were conducted on captured Russian troops; the Nazis wondered whether their genetics gave them superior resistance to cold. The principal locales were [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]]. Dr Sigmund Rascher, an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] doctor based at Dachau, reported directly to [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] and publicised the results of his freezing experiments at the 1942 medical conference entitled "Medical Problems Arising from Sea and Winter".<ref name="NOVA">{{cite web |author=Tyson, Peter |title=Holocaust on Trial: The Experiments |work=NOVA Online |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/holocaust/experiside.html |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref> Approximately 100 people are reported to have died as a result of these experiments.<ref>Neurnberg Military Tribunal, Volume I · [http://www.mazal.org/archive/nmt/01/NMT01-T200.htm Page 200]</ref>

===Malaria experiments===
From about February 1942 to about April 1945, experiments were conducted at the Dachau concentration camp in order to investigate immunization for treatment of [[malaria]]. Healthy inmates were infected by [[mosquitoes]] or by injections of extracts of the [[mucous gland]]s of female mosquitoes. After contracting the disease, the subjects were treated with various drugs to test their relative efficiency. Over 1,000 people were used in these experiments and more than half died as a result.{{cn|date=July 2012}}

===Mustard gas experiments===
At various times between September 1939 and April 1945, many experiments were conducted at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], [[Natzweiler]], and other camps to investigate the most effective treatment of wounds caused by [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]]. Test subjects were deliberately exposed  to mustard gas and other [[vesicant]]s (e.g. [[Lewisite]]) which inflicted severe [[chemical burn]]s. The victims' wounds were then tested to find the most effective treatment for the mustard gas burns.<ref name="trials">{{cite web |title=Introduction to NMT Case 1: U.S.A. v.

===Sulfonamide experiments===
From about July 1942 to about September 1943, experiments to investigate the effectiveness of [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]], a synthetic antimicrobial agent, were conducted at Ravensbrück.<ref name="Schaefer">Schaefer, Naomi. ''[http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/5/schaefer.htm  The Legacy of Nazi Medicine]'', ''The New Atlantis'', Number 5, Spring 2004, pp. 54–60.</ref> Wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with [[bacterium|bacteria]] such as ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' (the causative agent in [[gas gangrene]]) and ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'', the causative agent in [[tetanus]].<ref name=Spitz>{{cite book |last=Spitz |first=Vivien |title=Doctors from Hell: The Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on Humans |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_VH-7oeT4lEC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=sulfonamide+nazi+tetanus&source=web&ots=7OMyTBC1eF&sig=A_3K9WRxdMyS4j7qWAaXpK0m7GE  |year=2005 |publisher=Sentient Publications |isbn=1-59181-032-9 }}</ref> Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels at both ends of the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound. Infection was aggravated by forcing wood shavings and ground glass into the wounds. The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.

===Sea water experiments===
From about July 1944 to about September 1944, experiments were conducted at the Dachau concentration camp to study various methods of making [[sea water]] drinkable. At one point, a group of roughly 90 [[Romani people|Roma]] were deprived of food and given nothing but sea water to drink by [[Hans Eppinger|Dr. Hans Eppinger]], leaving them gravely injured.<ref name="NOVA"/> They were so dehydrated that others observed them licking freshly mopped floors in an attempt to get drinkable water.<ref name="ETHIC">{{cite web |author=Cohen, Baruch C. |title=The Ethics Of Using Medical Data From Nazi Experiments |work=Jewish Law: Articles |url=http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedEx.html |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref>

===Sterilization experiments===
The Law for the Prevention of Genetically Defective Progeny was passed on 14 July 1933, which legalized the involuntary sterilization of persons with diseases claimed to be hereditary: weak-mindedness, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, insanity, blindness, deafness, and physical deformities. The law was used to encourage growth of the Aryan race through the sterilization of persons who fell under the quota of being genetically defective.<ref>Gardella JE. The cost-effectiveness of killing: an overview of Nazi "euthanasia." Medical Sentinel 1999;4:132-5</ref> 1% of citizens between the age of 17 to 24 had been sterilized within 2 years of the law passing. Within 4 years, 300,000 patients had been sterilized.<ref>Dahl M. [Selection and destruction-treatment of "unworthy-to-live" children in the Third Reich and the role of child and adolescent psychiatry], Prax Kinderpsychol Kinderpsychiatr 2001;50:170-91.</ref> From about March 1941 to about January 1945, [[Forced sterilization|sterilization]] experiments were conducted at Auschwitz, Ravensbrück, and other places by [[Carl Clauberg|Dr. Carl Clauberg]].<ref name="trials"/> The purpose of these experiments was to develop a method of sterilization which would be suitable for sterilizing millions of people with a minimum of time and effort. These experiments were conducted by means of [[X-ray]], surgery and various [[medication|drugs]]. Thousands of victims were sterilized. Aside from its experimentation, the Nazi government sterilized around 400,000 individuals as part of its [[compulsory sterilization]] program.<ref>{{cite web |author=Piotrowski, Christa |title=Dark Chapter of American History: U.S. Court Battle Over Forced Sterilization |date=21 July 2000 |work=CommonDreams.org News Center |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/072100-106.htm |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref> Intravenous injections of solutions speculated to contain [[iodine]] and [[silver nitrate]] were successful, but had unwanted side effects such as vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, and cervical cancer.<ref>{{cite news |author=Meric, Vesna |title=Forced to take part in experiments |date=27 January 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4212061.stm  }}</ref> Therefore, [[gamma radiation|radiation]] treatment became the favored choice of sterilization. Specific amounts of exposure to radiation destroyed a person’s ability to produce ova or sperm. The radiation was administered through deception. Prisoners were brought into a room and asked to complete forms, which took two to three minutes. In this time, the radiation treatment was administered and, unknown to the prisoners, they were rendered completely sterile. Many suffered severe [[radiation burns]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Medical Experiments at Auschwitz |work=Jewish Virtual Library |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/aumed.html |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref>

===Experiments with poison===
Somewhere between December 1943 and October 1944, experiments were conducted at [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] to investigate the effect of various poisons. The poisons were secretly administered to experimental subjects in their food. The victims died as a result of the poison or were killed immediately in order to permit [[autopsy|autopsies]]. In September 1944, experimental subjects were shot with poisonous bullets, suffered torture and often died.<ref name="trials"/>

===Incendiary bomb experiments===
From around November 1943 to around January 1944, experiments were conducted at Buchenwald to test the effect of various pharmaceutical preparations on [[phosphorus]] burns. These burns were inflicted on prisoners using phosphorus material extracted from [[incendiary bomb]]s.<ref name="trials"/>

===High altitude experiments===
{{Further2|[[Hubertus Strughold]]}}
In early 1942, prisoners at Dachau concentration camp were used by Sigmund Rascher in experiments to aid German pilots who had to [[ejection seat|eject]] at high altitudes. A [[pressure vessel|low-pressure chamber]] containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to 20,000&nbsp;m (66,000&nbsp;ft). It was rumored that Rascher performed [[vivisection]]s on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment.<ref name=Cockburn>{{cite book |last=Cockburn |first=Alexander |title=Whiteout:The CIA, Drugs, and the Press |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s5qIj_h_PtkC&pg=PA149&dq=%22sigmund+rascher%22+brain&sig=hik0GQjMaPj9LF-YDkYdp0S9Otc  |year=1998 |publisher=Verso |isbn=1-85984-139-2 }}</ref> Of the 200 subjects, 80 died outright, and the others were executed.<ref name="NOVA"/>

==Aftermath==
Many of the subjects died as a result of the experiments conducted by the Nazis, while many others were murdered after the tests were completed to study the effect [[post-mortem examination|post mortem]].<ref name="CHILD">{{cite web |author=Rosenberg, Jennifer |title=Mengele's Children – The Twins of Auschwitz |work=about.com |url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/auschwitz/a/mengeletwins.htm |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref> Those who survived were often left mutilated, suffering permanent disability, weakened bodies, and mental distress.<ref name="NOVA"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Sterilization Experiments |work=Jewish Virtual Library |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/sterilexp.html |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref> On 19 August 1947, the doctors captured by Allied forces were put on trial in ''USA vs. Karl Brandt et al.'', which is commonly known as the [[Doctors' Trial]]. At the trial, several of the doctors argued in their defense that there was no international law regarding medical experimentation.

The issue of [[informed consent]] had previously been controversial in German medicine in 1900, when Dr. [[Albert Neisser]] infected patients (mainly prostitutes) with syphilis without their consent. Despite Neisser's support from most of the academic community, public opinion, led by psychiatrist [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]], was against Neisser. While Neisser went on to be fined by the Royal Disciplinary Court, Moll developed "a legally based, positivistic contract theory of the patient-doctor relationship" that was not adopted into German law.<ref name="BMJ">{{cite web |url=http://www.bmj.com/archive/7070nd1.htm |title=Informed consent in human experimentation before the Nuremberg code|last=Vollman |first=Jochen |coauthors= Rolf Winau| work=BMJ |accessdate=8 April 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080304153538/http://www.bmj.com/archive/7070nd1.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 4 March 2008}}</ref> Eventually, the minister for religious, educational, and medical affairs issued a directive stating that medical interventions other than for diagnosis, healing, and immunization were excluded under all circumstances if "the human subject was a minor or not competent for other reasons" or if the subject had not given his or her "unambiguous consent" after a "proper explanation of the possible negative consequences" of the intervention, though this was not legally binding.<ref name="BMJ"/>

In response, Drs. [[Leo Alexander]] and [[Andrew Conway Ivy]] drafted a ten point memorandum entitled ''Permissible Medical Experiment'' that went on to be known as the [[Nuremberg Code]].<ref name="USHMM">{{cite web |title=The Nuremberg Code |work=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=http://www.ushmm.org/research/doctors/code_expl.htm |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref> The code calls for such standards as voluntary consent of patients, avoidance of unnecessary pain and suffering, and that there must be a belief that the experimentation will not end in death or disability.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations and Ethical Guidelines: Reprinted from ''Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No. 10, Vol. 2, pp. 181–182 |publisher=Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office |year=1949 |work=Office of Human Subjects Research |url=http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/nuremberg.html |accessdate=23 March 2008 }}</ref> The Code was not cited in any of the findings against the defendants and never made it into either German or American [[medical law]].

===Modern ethical issues===
Contemporary knowledge concerning the manner in which the human body reacts to freezing is based almost exclusively on these Nazi experiments. This, together with the recent use of data from Nazi [[biomedical research|research]] into the effects of [[phosgene]] gas, has proven controversial and presents an [[medical ethics|ethical]] dilemma for modern physicians who do not agree with the methods used to obtain this data.<ref name="ETHIC"/> Similarly, controversy has arisen from the use of results of [[biological warfare]] testing done by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s [[Unit 731]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Unit 731: Japan's biological force |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/1796044.stm |accessdate=27 March 2008 | date=1 February 2002}}</ref> However, the results from Unit 731 were kept classified by the United States until the majority of doctors involved were given pardons.<ref>{{cite book |last=Reilly |first=Kevin |coauthors=Stephen Kaufman, Angela Bodino |title=Racism: A Global Reader |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E_xkU5a5Ts0C&pg=PA300&lpg=PA300&dq=unit+731+pardoned&source=web&ots=1NObOgO-EA&sig=qeLLZBRtUpooDLMpwszezMK3KCo&hl=en |accessdate=27 March 2008 |year=2003 |publisher=M.E.
