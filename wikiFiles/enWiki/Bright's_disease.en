'''Bright's disease''' is a historical classification of [[Nephrology|kidney diseases]] that would be described in modern [[medicine]] as [[Acute (medical)|acute]] or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[nephritis]]. The term is no longer used, as diseases are now classified according to their more fully understood [[etiology|causes]].<ref name="pmid4562073">{{cite journal |author=Cameron JS |title=Bright's disease today: the pathogenesis and treatment of glomerulonephritis--I |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=4 |issue=5832 |pages=87–90 contd |year=1972 |month=October |pmid=4562073 |pmc=1786202 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.4.5832.87|url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid4263317">{{cite journal |author=Cameron JS |title=Bright's disease today: the pathogenesis and treatment of glomerulonephritis.

It is typically denoted by the presence of [[serum albumin]] (blood plasma protein) in the [[urine]], and frequently accompanied by [[edema]] and hypertension.

==Symptoms==

These common [[symptom]]s of kidney disease were first described in 1827 by the English physician [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bright | first = R | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Reports of Medical Cases, Selected with a View of Illustrating the Symptoms and Cure of Diseases by a Reference to Morbid Anatomy, vol.

The formation of bilateral [[kidney stones]] often indicates underlying [[chronic kidney disease]].  These stones involve [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] crystal formations such as [[calcium oxalate]].  Excess [[serum calcium]] can result from [[Hypovitaminosis D#Risk_factors|hypovitaminosis D]], or [[vitamin D]] deficiency, that causes the body initially to lose serum calcium to the point where [[parathyroid hormone]] is produced to leach sufficient amounts of [[calcium]] from the [[bone]]s, (resulting in [[Osteoporosis|bone loss]]) to more than make up the difference (shutting down parathyroid hormone production).  [[Oxalic acid]] is found in chocolate, peanuts, certain types of berries, and other foods,<ref>http://www.olympusmicro.com/galleries/abramowitz/pages/oxalicacid1small.html</ref>{{dead link|date=April 2013}} and when combined with calcium will form calcium oxalate crystal [[kidney stones]] that can drive up blood pressure like any other serum salt, block urinary flow within the kidneys, and cause physical kidney damage and pain.  Researchers at [[Rockefeller University]] Hospital are studying [[arteriosclerosis]] in connection with this vitamin D deficiency, calcium plaque build-up, and kidney problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/2008/08/26/40917.aspx|title=Role of vitamin D in kidney disease examined|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=News Medical}}</ref>

The symptoms are usually severe. [[Back pain]], phantom [[testicle pain|testicular pain]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/testicular_disorders/page3.htm|title=Testicular Disorders|publisher=Medicine Net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000458.htm#Symptoms|title=Kidney Stones|publisher=Medline Plus}}</ref> in males, elevated blood pressure, [[vomiting]] and [[fever]] commonly signal an attack. [[Edema]], varying in degree from slight puffiness of the face to an accumulation of [[body fluids|fluid]] sufficient to distend the whole body, and sometimes severely restricted [[breath]]ing, is very common. Urine is reduced in quantity, is of dark, smoky or bloody color, and has higher levels of [[albumin]] ([[albuminuria]]). Under the microscope, [[blood cells|blood corpuscles]] and [[urinary casts]] are found in abundance.

This state of acute [[inflammation]] may severely limit normal daily activities, and if left unchecked, may lead to one of the chronic forms of Bright's disease. In many cases though, the inflammation is reduced, marked by increased urine output and the gradual disappearance of its albumen and other abnormal by-products. A reduction in edema and a rapid recovery of strength usually follows.

==Treatment==
Acute Bright's disease was treated with local depletion (bleeding or blood-letting to reduce blood pressure), warm baths, [[diuretic]]s, and [[laxative]]s.  The disease was diagnosed often in [[diabetic]] patients.  There was no successful treatment for chronic Bright's disease, though dietary modifications were sometimes suggested.  See [[Hay diet]], named after [[William Howard Hay]] MD, who suffered from the illness and supposedly cured himself after accepted medical methods of the early 1900s failed to do so.  The diet involves promoting [[Acid-base homeostasis|alkali and acid balance]] through consuming various foods and beverages, thereby lowering the kidney's involvement with [[Acid-base homeostasis|blood pH balancing.]]  Successful treatment for [[type II diabetes]] would reverse elevated glucose and insulin insensitivity problems throughout the body, especially in nerves and kidneys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/kdd/|title=Kidney Disease of Diabetes|publisher=National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NKUDIC)}}</ref>
