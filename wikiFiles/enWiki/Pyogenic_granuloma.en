==History and terminology==
Pyogenic granuloma was first described in 1897 by two French surgeons, Poncet and Dor, who named this lesion ''botryomycosis hominis''.<ref>Ferry AP, Zimmerman LE. Granuloma pyogenicum of limbus. Arch Ophthalmol 74:229-230, 1965.</ref> 

The name for pyogenic granuloma is misleading because it is not a true [[granuloma]]. In actuality, it is a [[capillary hemangioma]] of [[lobular]] subtype which is the reason they are often quite prone to bleeding.<ref name="joralsci"/>

It is also not truly ''pyogenic'', ("pus producing") as the cause is traumatic and not infectious.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Clinical presentation===
The appearance of pyogenic granuloma is usually a [[color]] ranging from red/pink to purple, and can be smooth or lobulated.  Younger lesions are more likely to be red because of the high number of blood vessels.  Older lesions begin to change into a pink color.  Size ranges from a few millimeters to centimeters.  It can be painful, especially if located in an area of the body where it is constantly disturbed.  Pyogenic granulomas can grow rapidly and will often bleed profusely with little or no trauma.  

It is most likely to occur in children and younger adults, and there is a definite [[gender]] difference with more [[female]]s affected than [[men]].  In [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women, it is most likely to occur in the [[first trimester]] with an increasing incidence up until the seventh month and is often seen on the anterior nasal septum as a source of frequent nose bleeds.  Pyogenic granulomas appear on the gingiva in 75% of cases, more often in the [[maxilla]]ry than [[Human mandible|mandibular]] jaw.  Anterior areas are more often affected than posterior areas.  It can also be found on the [[lip]]s, [[tongue]], and inner [[cheek]].  Poor [[oral hygiene]] or trauma are usually precipitating factors.  

One study has suggested a correlation between pyogenic granuloma and [[Bartonella]] [[seropositivity]].<ref name="pmid11907853">{{cite journal |author=Lee J, Lynde C |title=Pyogenic granuloma: pyogenic again? Association between pyogenic granuloma and Bartonella |journal=J Cutan Med Surg |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=467–70 |year=2001 |pmid=11907853 |doi=10.1007/s10227-001-0022-0}}</ref> However, this association has been questioned by others.<ref name="pmid16310070">{{cite journal |author=Levy I, Rolain JM, Lepidi H, ''et al.'' |title=Is pyogenic granuloma associated with Bartonella infection? |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=1065–6 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16310070 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2005.08.046 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190-9622(05)02699-X}}</ref> The appearance of a pyogenic granulomas [[microscope|microscopically]] has a highly vascular granulation tissue.  [[Inflammation]] is present.  The lesion may have a fibrous character if it is older, and the surface may have [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerations]]. Pyogenic granuloma rarely occurs in the conjunctiva, cornea or connective tissue of the eye following minor local trauma.  Grossly these mass lesions resemble those occurring at more common sites. The relationship of this lesion to the lobular capillary hemangioma of skin and oropharyngeal mucosa commonly referred to as pyogenic granuloma is uncertain.

===Associated conditions===
Due to its overwhelming incidence on the [[gingiva]], the condition is often associated with two other [[disease]]s, though not because they occur together.  Instead, the three are associated with each other because they appear frequently on gingiva - [[peripheral giant cell granuloma]] and [[peripheral ossifying fibroma]]. However, detailed analysis can be used to distinguish these conditions.<ref name="pmid18496485">{{cite journal |author=Salum FG, Yurgel LS, Cherubini K, De Figueiredo MA, Medeiros IC, Nicola FS |title=Pyogenic granuloma, peripheral giant cell granuloma and peripheral ossifying fibroma: retrospective analysis of 138 cases |journal=Minerva Stomatol |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=227–32 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18496485 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

The appearance can be very similar to that of a [[hemangioma]] but unlike hemangiomas they can appear after birth.

==Treatment==
There is usually no treatment if the pyogenic granuloma occurs during pregnancy since the lesion may heal spontaneously.  Recurrent bleeding in either the oral or nasal lesions may necessitate excision and cauterization sooner, however.  If aesthetics are a concern, then treatment may be pursued as well.  Usually, only conservative [[surgery]] may be needed, along with a dental cleaning for oral lesions to remove any [[calculus (dental)|calculus]] or other source of irritation.  For nasal lesions, one should be discouraged from any nose-picking.
