'''Essex Air Ambulance''' is an [[air ambulance]] service serving the county of [[Essex]] and surrounding areas, in the [[East of England]]. It is one of twenty-five [[Air Ambulances in the United Kingdom|air ambulance services in the United Kingdom]].

The charity began fundraising in 1997 and the service began operating in July the following year, and has flown over 11,000 missions since — being deployed two to four times per day. The helicopter is based at Earls Colne Airfield in [[Earls Colne]], near [[Colchester]].<ref name="essexairambulance1">{{cite web|url=http://www.essexairambulance.uk.com/AboutUs/tabid/55/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Essex Air Ambulance |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>

==Service==
Essex Air Ambulance provides helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) during daylight hours to the county of Essex and surrounding areas if required. A significant portion of missions are to [[traffic collision]]s on the busy, congested Essex road network.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/4283607.Helicopter_saviours__Essex_Air_Ambulance/ |title=Helicopter saviours: Essex Air Ambulance (From Gazette) |publisher=Gazette-news.co.uk |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>

The air ambulance costs in the region of £250,000 per month to fund all costs and aircraft operations.

In April 2007 the Essex Air Ambulance charity combined to form the Essex & Hertfordshire Air Ambulance Trust (EHAAT) responsible for both the Essex and [[Hertfordshire]] air ambulance services. The Hertfordshire Air Ambulance was introduced on 5 November 2008, and both services coordinate in the event of a major incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essexairambulance.uk.com/YourHelicopter/History/tabid/75/language/en-GB/Default.aspx |title=History |publisher=Essex Air Ambulance |date= |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> Operational control is from the East of England Ambulance Service Control at [[Broomfield, Essex]], who task the helicopters. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eastanglianairambulance.org.uk/news.asp?id=165&nt=Extended%20flying%20hours%20for%20summer |title=Extended flying hours for summer |publisher=East Anglian Air Ambulance |date= |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>

==Helicopter==
The first two helicopters used by Essex Air Ambulance were [[MBB Bo 105|Bölkow 105s]], from 1998 to 2003. The service was able to upgrade to a [[Eurocopter EC135]] in May 2003, then to a [[MD Helicopters MD Explorer|MD902 Explorer]] on 1 June 2010, the same model used by the Hertfordshire Air Ambulance. The current helicopter is [[Aircraft registration|registered]] ''G-EHAA''.

The MD902 is capable of flying at up to 150 mph, at an altitude of around 1,000ft, and can reach the farthest locations from its base within fifteen minutes and any of Essex's major hospitals within eight. It is usually airborne within two minutes of the emergency call being received.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.essexairambulance.uk.com/YourHelicopter/tabid/56/language/en-GB/Default.aspx | accessdate = 21 August 2012 | title = Your Helicopter | publisher = Essex Air Ambulance}}</ref>

==Crew==
The air ambulance is typically crewed by one of three pilots, one of six paramedics and one of three doctors of at least registrar qualification, enabling vital pre-hospital skills and techniques to be brought to a patient as early as possible. The helicopter can carry up to two patients, one on a stretcher and one sitting.<ref name="essexairambulance1"/>

When the helicopter is unable to operate, perhaps due to adverse weather conditions or essential maintenance, the crew can deploy in a specialist [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle, equipped with much of the same medical equipment as the helicopter.
