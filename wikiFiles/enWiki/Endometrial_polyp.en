==Cause and symptoms==
No definitive cause of endometrial polyps is known, but they appear to be affected by hormone levels and grow in response to circulating [[estrogen]].<ref name="Mayo" /> They often cause no symptoms.<ref name="SDS" /> Where they occur, symptoms include irregular menstrual bleeding, bleeding between menstrual periods, excessively heavy menstrual bleeding ([[menorrhagia]]), and vaginal bleeding after [[menopause]].<ref name="Mayo" /><ref name="GPN">{{cite web

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Nucleated_red_blood_cells_-_endometrial_polyp_-_low_mag.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Micrograph]] of an endometrial polyp. [[H&E stain]].]]
Endometrial polyps can be detected by [[vagina]]l [[Gynecologic ultrasonography|ultrasound]] (sonohysterography), [[hysteroscopy]] and [[dilation and curettage]].<ref name="Mayo" /> Detection by ultrasonography can be difficult, particularly when there is [[endometrial hyperplasia]] (excessive thickening of the endometrium).<ref name="PGU" /> Larger polyps may be missed by curettage.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web

==Treatment==
Polyps can be surgically removed using [[curettage]] with or without hysteroscopy.<ref name="UCSF">{{cite web

  | accessdate =2007-10-20  }}</ref> When curettage is performed without hysteroscopy, polyps may be missed. To reduce this risk, the uterus can be first explored using grasping [[forceps]] at the beginning of the curettage procedure.<ref name="OGDT" /> Hysteroscopy involves visualising the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) and polyp with a camera inserted through the [[cervix]]. If it is a large polyp, it can be cut into sections before each section is removed.<ref name="OGDT" /> If [[cancer]]ous cells are discovered, a [[hysterectomy]] (surgical removal of the uterus) may be performed.<ref name="Mayo" /> A hysterectomy would usually not be considered if cancer has been ruled out.<ref name="OGDT" /> Whichever method is used, polyps are usually treated under [[general anesthetic]].<ref name="BBC" />

==Prognosis and complications==
Endometrial polyps are usually [[Benign tumor|benign]] although some may be [[precancerous]] or [[cancerous]].<ref name="Mayo" /> About 0.5% of endometrial polyps contain [[adenocarcinoma]] cells.<ref>{{cite book

==Risk factors and epidemiology==
Endometrial polyps usually occur in women in their 40s and 50s.<ref name="Mayo" /> Risk factors include [[obesity]], [[high blood pressure]] and a history of [[cervical polyp]]s.<ref name="Mayo" /> Taking [[tamoxifen]] or [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] can also increase the risk of uterine polyps.<ref name="Mayo" /><ref name="Dew">{{cite book
