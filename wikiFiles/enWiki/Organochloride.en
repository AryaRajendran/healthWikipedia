An '''organochloride''', '''organochlorine''', '''chlorocarbon''', '''chlorinated hydrocarbon''', '''chloroalkane''', or '''chlorinated solvent''' is an [[organic compound]] containing at least one [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] atom of [[chlorine]]. Their wide structural variety and divergent chemical properties lead to a broad range of names and applications.  Many derivatives are controversial because of the effects of these compounds on the environment and on human and animal health.

==Physical properties==
Chloride substituents modify the physical properties of organic compounds in several ways. They are typically denser than [[water]] due to the presence of high atomic weight of chlorine. Chloride substituents induce stronger intermolecular interactions than hydrogen substituents.  The effect is illustrated by trends in boiling points: [[methane]] (-161.6 °C), [[methyl chloride]] (-24.2 °C), [[dichloromethane]] (40 °C), [[chloroform]] (61.2 °C), and [[carbon tetrachloride]] (76.72 °C).  The increased intermolecular interactions is attributed to the effects of both van der Waals and polarity.

==Natural occurrence==
Although rare compared to non-halogenated organic compounds, many organochlorine compounds have been isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans.<ref name="Gribble">{{cite journal | title = Naturally Occurring Organohalogen Compounds | author = Gordon W.

==Preparation==
===From chlorine===
Alkanes and arylalkanes may be chlorinated under free radical conditions, with UV light. However, the extent of chlorination is difficult to control. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the [[Friedel-Crafts halogenation]], using chlorine and a [[Lewis acid]] catalyst.

The [[haloform reaction]], using chlorine and [[sodium hydroxide]], is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chloroform was formerly produced thus.

Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds.

===Reaction with hydrogen chloride===
Alkenes react with [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) to give alkyl chlorides.  For example, the industrial production of [[chloroethane]] proceeds by the reaction of [[ethylene]] with HCl:

:H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub> + HCl &rarr; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl

Secondary and tertiary alcohols react with the [[Lucas reagent]] ([[zinc chloride]] in concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]]) to give the corresponding alkyl halide; this reaction a method for classifying alcohols:
:[[File:Lucas test.png|300px]]

===Other chlorinating agents===
In the laboratory, alkyl chlorides are most easily prepared by reacting alcohols with [[thionyl chloride]] (SOCl<sub>2</sub>), [[phosphorus trichloride]] (PCl<sub>3</sub>), or [[phosphorus pentachloride]] (PCl<sub>5</sub>):
:ROH + SOCl<sub>2</sub> &rarr; RCl + SO<sub>2</sub> + HCl
:3 ROH + PCl<sub>3</sub> &rarr; 3 RCl + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>
:ROH + PCl<sub>5</sub> &rarr; RCl + POCl<sub>3</sub> + HCl

In the laboratory, thionyl chloride is especially convenient, because the byproducts are gaseous.

Alternatively, the [[Appel reaction]]:

==Reactions==
Alkyl chlorides are versatile building blocks in organic chemistry. While alkyl bromides and iodides are more reactive, alkyl chlorides tend to be less expensive and more readily available. Alkyl chlorides readily undergo attack by nucleophiles. 

Heating alkyl halides with [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[water]] gives alcohols. Reaction with [[alkoxide]]s or [[aroxide]]s give [[ether]]s in the [[Williamson ether synthesis]]; reaction with [[thiol]]s give [[thioether]]s. Alkyl chlorides readily react with [[amine]]s to give substituted [[amine]]s. Alkyl chlorides are substituted by softer halides such as the [[iodide]] in the [[Finkelstein reaction]]. Reaction with other [[pseudohalide]]s such as [[azide]], [[cyanide]], and [[thiocyanate]] are possible as well. In the presence of a strong base, alkyl chlorides undergo dehydrohalogenation to give [[alkene]]s or [[alkyne]]s.

Alkyl chlorides react with [[magnesium]] to give [[Grignard reagent]]s, transforming an [[electrophilic]] compound into a [[nucleophilic]] compound. The [[Wurtz reaction]] reductively couples two alkyl halides to couple with [[sodium]].

==Applications==
===Vinyl chloride===
The largest application of organochlorine chemistry is the production of [[vinyl chloride]].  The annual production in 1985 was around 13 billion kilograms, almost all of which was converted into [[polyvinylchloride]] (PVC).

===Chloromethanes===
Most low molecular weight chlorinated hydrocarbons such as [[chloroform]], [[dichloromethane]], [[dichloroethene]], and [[trichloroethane]] are useful solvents.  These solvents tend to be relatively [[chemical polarity|non-polar]]; they are therefore immiscible with water and effective in cleaning applications such as [[degreasing]] and [[dry cleaning]].  Several billion kilograms of chlorinated methanes are produced annually, mainly by chlorination of methane:
:CH<sub>4</sub>  +  x Cl<sub>2</sub>  →   CH<sub>4-x</sub>Cl<sub>x</sub>  +  x HCl

The most important is dichloromethane, which is mainly used as a solvent.  Chloromethane is a precursor to [[chlorosilane]]s and [[silicone]]s.  Historically significant, but smaller in scale is chloroform, mainly a precursor to [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (CHClF<sub>2</sub>) and [[tetrafluoroethene]] which is used in the manufacture of Teflon.<ref name=Ullmann>M. Rossberg et al. “Chlorinated Hydrocarbons” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2}}</ref>

===Pesticides===
Many pesticides contain chlorine. Notable examples include [[DDT]], [[dicofol]], [[heptachlor]], [[endosulfan]], [[chlordane]], [[aldrin]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]], [[mirex]], [[kepone]] and [[pentachlorophenol]]. These can be either [[hydrophilic]] or [[hydrophobic]] depending on their molecular structure.  Many of these agents have been banned in various countries, e.g. mirex, aldrin.<ref name=Ullmann2>Robert L. Metcalf “Insect Control” in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry” Wiley-VCH, Wienheim, 2002.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_263}}</ref>

===Insulators===
[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) were once commonly used electrical insulators and heat transfer agents.  Their use has generally been phased out due to health concerns.  PCBs were replaced by polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which bring similar toxicity and bioaccumulation concerns.

==Toxicity==
Some types of organochlorides have significant toxicity to plants or animals, including humans.  Dioxins, produced when organic matter is burned in the presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as [[DDT]], are [[persistent organic pollutant]]s which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (i.e., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species.<ref>{{cite book | title=Introduction to Ecotoxicology | publisher=Blackwell Science | year=1999 | isbn=0-632-03852-7 | page=68 | author=Connell, D. et al.}}</ref> 

When chlorinated solvents, such as [[carbon tetrachloride]], are not disposed of properly, they accumulate in groundwater.  Some highly reactive organochlorides such as [[phosgene]] have even been used as [[chemical warfare agent]]s. 

However, the presence of chlorine in an organic compound does not ensure toxicity.  Some organochlorides are considered safe enough for consumption in foods and medicines.  For example, peas and broad beans contain the natural chlorinated plant hormone [[4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid]] (4-Cl-IAA);<ref>{{cite journal|title=Occurrence of 4-Cl-indoleacetic acid in broad beans and correlation of its levels with seed development|journal=Plant Physiology|year=1984|volume=74|issue=2|pages=320–3 | pmc = 1066676|doi=10.1104/pp.74.2.320|author1=Pless, Tanja|author2=Boettger, Michael|author3=Hedden, Peter|author4=Graebe, Jan|pmid=16663416}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=4-chloroindole-3-acetic and indole-3-acetic acids in Pisum sativum|journal = [[Phytochemistry (journal)|Phytochemistry]]|year=1997|volume=46|issue=4|pages=675–681|doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(97)00229-X|author1=Magnus, Volker|author2=Ozga, Jocelyn A|author3=Reinecke, Dennis M|author4=Pierson, Gerald L|author5=Larue, Thomas A|author6=Cohen, Jerry D|author7=Brenner, Mark L}}</ref> and the sweetener [[sucralose]] (Splenda) is widely used in diet products.  {{As of|2004}}, there were at least 165 organochlorides approved worldwide for use as pharmaceutical drugs, including the natural antibiotic [[vancomycin]], the antihistamine [[loratadine]] (Claritin), the antidepressant [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), the anti-epileptic [[lamotrigine]] (Lamictal), and the inhalation anesthetic [[isoflurane]].<ref>MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR), Elsevier MDL, version 2004.2</ref>

[[Rachel Carson]] brought the issue of DDT pesticide toxicity to public awareness with her  1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]''.  While many countries have phased out the use of some types of organochlorides such as the US ban on DDT, persistent DDT, PCBs, and other organochloride residues continue to be found in humans and mammals across the planet many years after production and use have been limited.  In [[Arctic]] areas, particularly high levels are found in [[marine mammal]]s. These chemicals concentrate in mammals, and are even found in human breast milk. Males typically have far higher levels, as females reduce their concentration by transfer to their offspring through breast feeding.<ref>''Marine Mammal Medicine'', 2001,  Dierauf & Gulland</ref>
