'''The American Physiological Society''' (APS; www.the-aps.org) was founded in 1887 with 28 members. Of them, 21 were graduates of [[medical school]]s, but only 12 had studied in schools that had a professor of [[physiology]]. Today, the APS has 10,500 members, most of whom hold [[doctoral degree]]s in [[medicine]], physiology or other health professions. APS's mission then, as now, is to support [[research]], [[education]], and circulation of information in the physiological sciences.

The American Physiological Society was founded at a time when very few physiological laboratories existed in [[United States|America]] and there were few investigators. The newly established society was one of the earliest national disciplinary societies in the sciences, the first society in the [[biomedical]] sciences, and the first to require its members to publish original research. The stated object of the Society was to promote the advancement of physiology and to facilitate discourse among American [[physiologist]]s. Even in 1887 there was a conscious effort to ensure representation of all areas within physiology, encompassing topics as diverse as [[neurology]], [[psychology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[pathology]] and [[therapeutics]], as well as [[plant physiology]] and [[zoology|animal biology]]. Today there are a variety of membership categories for those at all interest levels and ages.

== Nobel Prizes for Physiology ==
Since it was founded in 1887, the APS has had 82 presidents lead the organization, beginning with founder Henry Bowditch and continuing through its current president, Gary Sieck, [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester, MN]]. During a similar period, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] has recognized scientists in the field of physiology by awarding the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine. The first physiologist to receive the award was the Russian [[Ivan Petrovich Pavlov]], who won the coveted award in 1904 "in recognition of his work on the physiology of [[digestion]], through which knowledge on vital aspects of the subject has been transformed and enlarged."

Americans first won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934. It was for a dazzling cure based on luck and error. [[Harvard University|Harvard]] clinicians [[George R. Minot]] and [[William P. Murphy]] joined [[George Whipple]], a Rochester pathologist and, using the wrong animal model, found a cure for [[pernicious anemia]]. Since then, an additional 29 physiologists, 7 of whom were American physiologists, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on 24 distinct achievements in the field.

== APS Governance ==
The APS is governed by an elected Council consisting of the President, the President-Elect, the immediate Past President, and nine Councillors. Management of the affairs of the Society is the responsibility of a full-time Executive Director, appointed by and responsible to the Council. The Society maintains a staff and offices on the campus of the [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]] (FASEB) in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. The Society conducts its operations based on a Constitution and Bylaws, as given in the Society's Operational Guide. As a [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]] scientific organization, the Society holds tax-exempt status. The organization is managed by Executive Director Martin Frank, PhD., a physiologist by training.

== APS History & Activity ==
The first regular meeting of the APS at which papers and demonstrations were presented was held in [[Washington, DC]], in September 1888 in conjunction with the newly formed Congress of American Physicians and Surgeons.

The first 25 years of the APSâ€™s existence were dedicated to the organized effort to advance [[teaching]] and research via mutual cooperation. These efforts resulted in a comprehensive [[textbook]] of physiology, authored by 10 members of the APS, as well as the first publication of the [[American Journal of Physiology]] in 1898.

Over the next 25 years, physiology became an established profession. Full-time physiologists were at last considered important members of the faculty of medical schools and [[biology]] departments, and both teaching and research became standard and traditional occupations for physiologists.

Throughout the mid-1900s, there was remarkable expansion within the field of physiology, and especially in research. Research topics expanded along with new types of affordable equipment and research results were expected of every teacher and [[graduate student]].

Since the 1960s, there has been increasingly deep specialization in research and teaching. For example, instead of being recognized as a physiologist, an individual was recognized as a [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiologist]] or vascular physiologist.

The Society has many awards, including the Horace W. Davenport Distinguished Lecturer,<ref>http://www.med.unc.edu/www/news/2008/october/unc-researcher-honored-by-american-physiological-society</ref> the Walter B. Cannon Award,<ref>http://louisville.edu/medschool/dean/news/bolli-receives-high-honor-from-the-american-physiological-society</ref> and Arthur C. Guyton Award.<ref>http://www.utsa.edu/today/2010/05/kellysuter.html</ref>

== APS Peer-Reviewed Journals & Publications ==
The American Physiological Society publishes both journals and books as a nonprofit [[publisher]]. The APS publications are among the most respected and frequently cited in the world.

There are 14 scholarly, [[peer-reviewed journal]]s covering specialized aspects of physiology. Eleven of the journals are published monthly. All told, APS publishes some 3,800 original peer-reviewed articles annually, totaling approximately 40,000 pages per year.

Each of these journals is published both online and in print unless noted otherwise. The articles published in these journals also appear in scientific web [[blog]]s, on other websites, and in the media nationally.

== APS Sections ==
Members can affiliate with one of twelve disciplinary sections composed of members that share a common interest. The sections are Cardiovascular, Cell and Molecular Physiology, Central Nervous System, Comparative and Evolutionary Physiology, [[Endocrinology]] and Metabolism, Environmental and Exercise Physiology, Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology, Neural Control and Autonomic Regulation, Renal Physiology, [[Respiration (physiology)|Respiration]], Teaching of Physiology and Water and [[Electrolyte]] Homeostasis. Each member is asked to designate one primary, and two secondary section affiliations. Sections have their own internal governance.

== APS Membership ==
The APS has a variety of membership categories to accommodate all interest levels. Regular membership is for individuals conducting original research in physiology. Affiliate membership is for individuals interested in physiology but without the evidence of scholarly work. Graduate Student membership is for any student engaged in physiological work that will culminate in a doctoral degree. Undergraduate Student membership is for individuals working toward an [[undergraduate degree]] that will eventually lead to work in physiology or a related field.

== APS Committees ==
The American Physiological Society provides its membership with opportunities to be involved with the Society through service on its various [[committee]]s. The Committees are: Animal Care and Experimentation, Awards, Career Opportunities in Physiology, Chapter Advisory Committee, Committee on Committees, Communications, Conferences, Daggs Award, Education, Finance, International Physiology, Joint Program, Physiologists in Industry, Membership, Perkins Memorial Fellowship, Porter Physiology Development, Public Affairs, Publications, Section Advisory, Senior Physiologists, Trainee Advisory, and Women in Physiology.

== APS Meetings ==
The American Physiological Society sponsors a number of [[scientific meeting]]s each year. Experimental Biology, the APS annual meeting, is conducted jointly with other FASEB member societies. In addition to its annual meeting, specialized APS Conferences are held throughout the year and focus on designated areas of physiological research. The spring annual meeting, Experimental Biology, is convened jointly with other biomedical societies. This multi-society interdisciplinary, biomedical, and scientific meeting features plenary and award [[lecture]]s, symposia, oral and poster sessions, a placement center, and an exhibit of scientific equipment, supplies, and publications.<ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/64014.php</ref>
