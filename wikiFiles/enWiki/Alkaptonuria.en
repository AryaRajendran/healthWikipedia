'''Alkaptonuria''' ('''black urine disease''' or '''alcaptonuria''') is a rare inherited genetic disorder of [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]] metabolism. This is an autosomal [[dominance relationship|recessive condition]] that is due to a defect in the [[enzyme]] [[homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase]] ({{EC number|1.13.11.5}}), which participates in [[Tyrosine#Degradation|the degradation of]] tyrosine. As a result, [[homogentisic acid]] and its oxide, called [[alkapton]], accumulate in the blood and are excreted in urine in large amounts (hence ''-uria''). Excessive homogentisic acid causes damage to [[cartilage]] ([[ochronosis]], leading to [[osteoarthritis]]) and [[heart valve]]s as well as precipitating as [[kidney stone]]s. Treatment with [[nitisinone]], which suppresses homogentisic acid production, is being studied.<ref name=Phornphutkul>{{cite journal |author=Phornphutkul C, Introne WJ, Perry MB, ''et al.'' |title=Natural history of alkaptonuria |journal=New England Journal Medicine |volume=347 |issue=26 |pages=2111–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12501223 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa021736| url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/347/26/2111}}</ref> Alkaptonuria is more common in [[Slovakia]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] than in other countries.<ref name=Zatkova>{{cite journal |author=Zatková A, de Bernabé DB, Poláková H, ''et al.'' |title=High Frequency of Alkaptonuria in Slovakia: Evidence for the Appearance of Multiple Mutations in HGO Involving Different Mutational Hot Spots |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=1333–9 |year=2000 |pmid=11017803 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9297(07)62964-4 |pmc=1288576}}</ref><ref name=Milch1960>{{cite journal |author=Milch RA |title=Studies of Alcaptonuria: Inheritance of 47 Cases in Eight Highly Inter-related Dominican Kindreds |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=76–85 |year=1960 |pmid=17948450 |pmc=1932065}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Alkaptonuria is often [[asymptomatic]], but the [[sclera]] of the eyes may be pigmented (often only at a later age),<ref name=Phornphutkul/> and the skin may be darkened in sun-exposed areas and around [[sweat gland]]s; sweat may be coloured brown. Urine may turn brown or even inky black if collected and left exposed to open air, especially when left standing for a period of time.  [[Kidney stone]]s and stone formation in the [[prostate]] (in men) are common and may occur in more than a quarter of cases.<ref name=Phornphutkul/>

The main symptoms of alkaptonuria are due to the accumulation of homogentisic acid in tissues. In the [[joint]]s this leads to cartilage damage, specifically in the [[Vertebral column|spine]], leading to [[low back pain]] at a young age in most cases.  Cartilage damage may also occur in the hip and shoulder. [[Joint replacement]] surgery (hip and shoulder) is often necessary at a relatively young age.<ref name=Phornphutkul/>

[[Valvular heart disease]], mainly calcification and regurgitation of the [[aortic valve|aortic]] and [[mitral valve]]s, may occur, and in severe and progressive cases [[valve replacement]] may be necessary. [[Coronary artery disease]] may be accelerated in alkaptonuria.<ref name=Phornphutkul/>

A distinctive characteristic of alkaptonuria is that ear wax exposed to air turns red or black (depending on diet) after several hours because of the accumulation of homogentisic acid.<ref name="pmid79943">{{cite journal |author=Srsen S |title=Dark pigmentation of ear cerumen in alkaptonuria |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8089 |pages=577 |year=1978 |pmid=79943 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(78)92912-4}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of alkaptonuria needs to be suspected before diagnostic testing can be performed using [[paper chromatography]] and [[thin layer chromatography]]. Both blood plasma and urine can be used for diagnosis. In healthy subjects, [[homogentisic acid]] is absent in both blood plasma and urine. In alkaptonuria, plasma levels are 6.6 micrograms/ml on average, and urine levels are on average 3.12&nbsp;mmol/mmol of [[creatinine]].<ref name=Phornphutkul/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Homogentisic acid]] is a natural intermediary of the metabolism of [[tyrosine]], an [[amino acid]]. [[Liver|Hepatic]] [[homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase]] (coded by the ''HGD'' gene) metabolises homogentisic acid into [[4-Maleylacetoacetate|4-maleylacetoacetate]]. Alkaptonuria arises in people who have inherited two abnormal ''HGD'' genes: one from each parent. Numerous different ''HGD'' mutations have been identified.<ref name=Phornphutkul/>

In a patient who underwent a [[liver transplant]] for an unrelated problem, alkaptonuria resolved and joint disease stabilised after the transplant, confirming that the liver is the main site of homogentisic acid production in alkaptonuria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kobak AC, Oder G, Kobak S, Argin M, Inal V |title=Ochronotic arthropathy: disappearance of alkaptonuria after liver transplantation for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis |journal=Journal of Clinical Rheumatology |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=323–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16371803 |doi=10.1097/01.rhu.0000191157.25894.55}}</ref>

==Treatment==
No treatment modality has been unequivocally demonstrated to reduce the complications of alkaptonuria. Commonly recommended treatments include large doses of [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C)and dietary restriction of [[phenylalanine]] and tyrosine. Dietary restriction may be effective in children, but benefits in adults have not been demonstrated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Haas V, Carbasius Weber EC, de Klerk JB, ''et al.'' |title=The success of dietary protein restriction in alkaptonuria patients is age-dependent |journal=Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=791–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9870204 |doi=10.1023/A:1005410416482}}</ref>

The herbicide [[nitisinone]] inhibits [[4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase|4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase]], the enzyme that generates homogentisic acid from [[4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid|4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid]]. This reduces homogentisic acid. The main side-effect is irritation of the [[cornea]], and there is a concern that it will cause the symptoms of [[Type III tyrosinemia|hereditary tyrosinaemia type III]] because of the possible accumulation of tyrosine or other intermediaries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Suwannarat P, O'Brien K, Perry MB, ''et al.'' |title=Use of nitisinone in patients with alkaptonuria |journal=Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=719–28 |year=2005 |pmid=15931605 |doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2004.12.017}}</ref> Further studies are being conducted.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00107783}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
In Slovakia the disease occurs in 1:19,000 people. In other ethnic groups, the normal prevalence is between 1:100,000 and 1:250,000.<ref name=Zatkova/> It is reported frequently in the [[Dominican Republic]], but exact prevalence there is not known.<ref name=Milch1960/>

==History==
Alkaptonuria was one of the four diseases described by Sir [[Archibald Edward Garrod]], as being the result of the accumulation of intermediates due to metabolic deficiencies. He linked [[ochronosis]] with the accumulation of alkaptans in 1902,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Garrod AE|year=1902|title=The incidence of alkaptonuria: a study in clinical individuality|journal=Lancet|volume=2|pages=1616−1620|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)41972-6|issue=4137}} Reproduced in {{cite journal | author=Garrod AE| title=The incidence of alkaptonuria: a study in chemical individuality. 1902 classical article|journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | volume=75 | pages=221–31 |year=2002| pmid=12784973 | issue=4 | pmc=2588790}}</ref> and his views on the subject, including its mode of heritance, were summarised in a 1908 Croonian lecture at the [[Royal College of Physicians]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Garrod AE|year=1908|title=The Croonian lectures on inborn errors of metabolism: lecture II: alkaptonuria|journal=Lancet|volume=2|issue=3|pages=73–79|pmid=20992918}}</ref> The defect was narrowed down to homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency in a study published in 1958.<ref>{{cite journal |author=La Du BN, Zannoni VG, Laster L, Seegmiller JE |title=The nature of the defect in tyrosine metabolism in alcaptonuria |journal= Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=230 |issue=1 |pages=251–60 |date=1 January 1958|pmid=13502394 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/230/1/251|format=PDF }}</ref> The genetic basis was elucidated in 1996, when HGD mutations were demonstrated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fernández-Cañón JM, Granadino B, Beltrán-Valero de Bernabé D, ''et al.'' |title=The molecular basis of alkaptonuria |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=19–24 |year=1996 |pmid=8782815 |doi=10.1038/ng0996-19}}</ref>

A 1977 study showed that an ochronotic Egyptian [[mummy]] had probably suffered from alkaptonuria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stenn FF, Milgram JW, Lee SL, Weigand RJ, Veis A |title=Biochemical identification of homogentisic acid pigment in an ochronotic egyptian mummy |journal=Science |volume=197 |issue=4303 |pages=566–8 |year=1977 |pmid=327549 |doi= 10.1126/science.327549}}</ref>

In 2003, [[The AKU Society]] was founded to support patients diagnosed with the disease.<ref>{{cite web|title=AKU Society|url=http://www.akusociety.org/}}</ref>
