A '''recovery approach''' to [[mental disorder]] or [[substance dependence]] (and/or from being [[labeling theory|labeled]] in those terms) emphasizes and supports a person's potential for recovery. Recovery is generally seen in this approach as a personal [[quest|journey]] rather than a set outcome, and one that may involve developing [[hope]], a secure base and sense of self, supportive [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[empowerment]], [[social inclusion]], coping skills, and [[value (personal and cultural)|meaning]]. Other names for the concept are recovery model or recovery-oriented practice.

Originating from the 12-Step Program of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and the [[civil rights movement]], the use of the concept in [[mental health]] emerged as [[deinstitutionalization]] resulted in more individuals living in the community. It gained impetus as a [[social movement]] due to a perceived failure by services or wider society to adequately support [[social inclusion]], and by studies demonstrating that many can recover. A recovery approach has now been explicitly adopted as the guiding principle of the mental health or substance dependency policies of a number of countries and states. In many cases practical steps are being taken to base services on a recovery model, although a range of obstacles, concerns and criticisms have been raised both by service providers and by recipients of services. A number of standardized measures have been developed to assess aspects of recovery, although there is some variation between professionalized models and those originating in the [[psychiatric survivors movement]].

==History==
In [[medicine|general medicine]] and [[psychiatry]], recovery has long been used to refer to the end of a particular experience or episode of [[illness]]. The broader concept of "recovery" as a general philosophy and model was first popularized in regard to recovery from [[substance abuse]]/[[drug addiction]], for example within [[twelve-step program]]s.

Application of recovery models to psychiatric disorders is comparatively recent. By consensus the main impetus for the development came from the within the [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement]], a grassroots self-help and advocacy initiative, particularly within the [[United States]] during the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref name="USsurgeon">Office of the Surgeon General and various United States Government agencies (1999) [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter2/sec10.html Mental Health: A report of the Surgeon General. Section 10: Overview of Recovery]</ref> The professional literature, starting with the [[psychiatric rehabilitation]] movement in particular, began to incorporate the concept from the early 1990s in the United States, followed by New Zealand and more recently across nearly all countries within the "[[First World]]".<ref name="RecoveryEmergent">{{cite journal |author=Ramon S, Healy B, Renouf N |title=Recovery from mental illness as an emergent concept and practice in Australia and the UK |journal=Int J Soc Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=108–22 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17472085 |url=http://isp.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17472085 |doi=10.1177/0020764006075018}}</ref> Similar approaches developed around the same time, without necessarily using the term recovery, in Italy, the Netherlands and the UK. 

Developments were fueled by a number of long term outcome studies of people with "major mental illnesses" in populations from virtually every continent, including landmark cross-national studies by the [[World Health Organization]] from the 1970s and 1990s, showing unexpectedly high rates of complete or partial recovery, with exact statistics varying by region and the criteria used. The cumulative impact of personal stories or [[testimony]] of recovery has also been a powerful force behind the development of recovery approaches and policies. A key issue became how service consumers could maintain the ownership and authenticity of recovery concepts while also supporting them in professional policy and practice.<ref name="Deegan88">{{cite journal | author = Deegan PE | year = 1988 | title = Recovery: The lived experience of rehabilitation | url = http://www.bu.edu/cpr/repository/articles/pdf/deegan1998.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal | volume = 11 | issue = | page = 4 }}</ref>

Increasingly, recovery became both a subject of mental health services research and a term emblematic of many of the goals of the Consumer/Survivor/Ex-Patient Movement. The concept of recovery was often defined and applied differently by consumers/survivors and professionals. Specific policy and clinical strategies were developed to implement recovery principles although key questions remained.<ref name="USsurgeon"/><ref>[http://www.5countymh.org/Docs/JacobsonCurtis%202-5-99%20fin.pdf Jacobson, N. and Curtis, L. (2000)] Recovery as Policy in Mental Health Services: Strategies Emerging from the States. ''Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal'', Spring</ref>

==Elements of recovery==
It has been emphasized that each individual's journey to recovery is a deeply personal process, as well as being related to an individual's community and society.<ref name= "InclusionRecovery">Repper, J. & Perkins, R. (2006) ''Social Inclusion and Recovery: A Model for Mental Health Practice.'' Bailliere Tindall, UK. ISBN 0-7020-2601-8</ref> A number of features or signs of recovery have been proposed as often core elements, however:

===Hope===
Finding and nurturing hope has been described as a key to recovery. It is said to include not just [[optimism]] but a sustainable belief in oneself and a willingness to persevere through uncertainty and setbacks. Hope may start at a certain turning point, or emerge gradually as a small and fragile feeling, and may fluctuate with [[wikt:despair|despair]]. It is said to involve trusting, and risking [[disappointment]], [[failure]] and further [[pain|hurt]].<ref name="InclusionRecovery"/>

===Secure base===
Appropriate [[house|housing]], a sufficient [[income]], freedom from [[violence]], and adequate access to [[health care]] have also been proposed.<ref name="OntarioRecovery"/> It has been suggested that home is where recovery may begin. Housing services, if required, need to flexibly involve people and to build on individuals' personal visions and strengths, instead of "placing" and potentially "[[Deinstitutionalization|re-institutionalizing]]" people.<ref>Lori Ashcraft, PhD, William A. Anthony, PhD, and Chris Martin, MA (2008) "[http://www.behavioral.net/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=64D490AC6A7D4FE1AEB453627F1A4A32&id=ED588DA6B5944933954A46075CF8E4A6&tier=4 Home is where recovery begins: Why do we assume that having a home is a reward for recovery—and not part of it?] Behavioral Healthcare, May</ref>

===Self===
Recovery of a durable sense of self (if it had been lost or taken away) has been proposed as an important element. A research review suggested that people sometimes achieve this by "positive withdrawal"—regulating social involvement and negotiating public space in order to only move towards others in a way that feels safe yet meaningful; and nurturing personal psychological space that allows room for developing understanding and a broad sense of self, interests, [[spirituality]], etc. It was suggested that the process is usually greatly facilitated by experiences of interpersonal [[acceptance]], mutuality, and a sense of social belonging; and is often challenging in the face of the typical barrage of overt and covert negative messages that come from the broader social context.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sells DJ, Stayner DA, Davidson L |title=Recovering the self in schizophrenia: an integrative review of qualitative studies |journal=Psychiatr Q |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=87–97 |year=2004 |pmid=14992305 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0033-2720&volume=75&page=87 |doi=10.1023/B:PSAQ.0000007563.17236.97}}</ref>

===Supportive relationships===
A common aspect of recovery is said to be the presence of others who believe in the person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While [[mental health professional]]s can offer a particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships with [[friends]], [[family]] and the [[community]] are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance..<ref name="Friendships">Hack Thyself (2012) [http://hackthyself.net Recovery Is Impossible Without Friends]</ref> Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those who share the same values and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocal]] relationships and mutual support networks can be of more value to [[self-esteem]] and recovery.<ref name="InclusionRecovery"/>

===Empowerment and Inclusion===
[[Empowerment]] and [[self-determination]] are said to be important to recovery, including having [[self-control]]. This can mean developing the [[confidence]] for independent [[assertive]] [[decision making]] and help-seeking. Achieving social inclusion may require support and may require challenging [[social stigma|stigma]] and [[prejudice]] about mental distress/disorder/difference. It may also require recovering unpracticed [[social skill]]s or making up for gaps in work history.<ref name="InclusionRecovery"/>

===Coping strategies===
The development of personal [[coping (psychology)|coping strategies]] (including [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] or [[self-help]]) is said to be an important element. This can involve making use of [[medication]] or [[psychotherapy]] if the consumer is [[informed consent|fully informed]] and [[active listening|listened]] to, including about [[adverse effect]]s and about which methods fit with the consumer's life and their journey of recovery. Developing coping and [[problem solving]] skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which may or may not be seen as [[symptom]]s of mental disorder) may require a person becoming their own [[expert]], in order to identify key [[stress (biology)|stress]] points and possible crisis points, and to understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping.<ref name="InclusionRecovery"/>

Being able to move on can mean having to cope with feelings of [[grief|loss]], which may include despair and [[anger]]. When an individual is ready, this can mean a process of grieving. It may require accepting past [[suffering]] and lost opportunities or lost [[time]].<ref name="InclusionRecovery"/>

===Meaning===
Developing a sense of meaning and overall purpose is said to be important for sustaining the recovery process. This may involve recovering or developing a social or work role. It may also involve renewing, finding or developing a guiding [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[politics]] or [[culture]].<ref name="InclusionRecovery"/> From a [[postmodern]] perspective, this can be seen as developing a narrative.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }}</ref>

==Concepts of recovery==
===Varied definitions===
What constitutes 'recovery', or a recovery model, is a matter of ongoing debate both in theory and in practice. In general, professionalized clinical models tend to focus on improvement in particular symptoms and functions, and on the role of treatments, while consumer/survivor models tend to put more emphasis on [[peer support]], empowerment and real-world personal experience.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bellack AS |title=Scientific and consumer models of recovery in schizophrenia: concordance, contrasts, and implications |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=432–42 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16461575 |pmc=2632241 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj044 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16461575}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Recovering from Illness or Recovering your Life?

Gill, Nora M. Barrett, Kevin K. Hull,Melissa M. Roberts (2002) ''Psychiatric Rehabilitation''</ref> Similarly, recovery may be viewed in terms of a [[social model of disability]] rather than a [[medical model of disability]], and there may be differences in the acceptance of diagnostic "labels" and treatments.<ref name="InclusionRecovery"/> 

A review of research suggested that writers on recovery are rarely explicit about which of the various concepts they are employing. The reviewers classified the approaches they found in to broadly "rehabilitation" perspectives, which they defined as being focused on life and meaning within the context of enduring disability, and "clinical" perspectives which focused on observable remission of symptoms and restoration of functioning.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Concepts of recovery: competing or complementary? |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=664–7 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16639093 |doi= 10.1097/01.yco.0000184418.29082.0e |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewprogram/4828_pnt |author=Davidson L, Lawless MS, Leary F}}</ref> From a [[psychiatric rehabilitation]] perspective, a number of additional qualities of the recovery process have been suggested, including that it: can occur without professional intervention, but requires people who believe in and stand by the person in recovery; does not depend on believing certain theories about the cause of conditions; can be said to occur even if symptoms later re-occur, but does change the frequency and duration of symptoms; requires recovery from the consequences of a psychiatric condition as well as the condition itself; is not [[linear]] but does tend to take place as a series of small steps; does not mean the person was never really psychiatrically disabled; focuses on wellness not illness, and on consumer choice.<ref>Anthony, W.A., Cohen, M., Farkas, M, & Gagne, C. (2002). Psychiatric Rehabilitation. 2nd edition. Boston: Boston University Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation. ISBN 1-878512-11-0</ref> 

A consensus statement on mental health recovery from US agencies, that involved some consumer input, defined recovery as a journey of healing and transformation enabling a person with a mental health problem to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice while striving to achieve his or her full potential. Ten fundamental components were elucidated, all assuming that the person continues to be a "consumer" or to have a "mental disability".<ref>US Dept of Health and Human Services and SAMHSA Center for Mental Health Services (2004) [http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/sma05-4129/ National Consensus Statement on Mental Health Recovery]</ref> Conferences have been held on the importance of the "elusive" concept from the perspectives of consumers and psychiatrists.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Recovery Movement Gains Influence In Mental Health Programs |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=10 |date=January 3, 2003 |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/38/1/10}}</ref>

One approach to recovery known as the [[Tidal Model]] focuses on the continuous process of change inherent in all people, conveying the meaning of experiences through water [[metaphor]]s. [[Crisis]] is seen as involving opportunity; [[creativity]] is valued; and different domains are explored such as sense of security, personal [[narrative]] and relationships. Initially developed by [[psychiatric and mental health nursing|mental health nurses]] along with service users, Tidal is a particular model that has been specifically researched. Based on a discrete set of values (the Ten Commitments), it emphasizes the importance of each person's own voice, resourcefulness and wisdom. Since 1999, projects based on the Tidal Model have been established in several countries.

For many, recovery has a political as well as personal implication—where to recover is to: find meaning; challenge prejudice (including diagnostic "labels" in some cases); perhaps to be a "bad" non-compliant patient and refuse to accept the indoctrination of the system; to reclaim a chosen life and place within society; and to validate the self.<ref>Chamberlin, J. [http://www.power2u.org/articles/recovery/confessions.html Confessions of a non-compliant patient] National Empowerment Center</ref> Recovery can thus be viewed as one manifestation of empowerment. Such an empowerment model may emphasize that conditions are not necessarily permanent; that other people have recovered who can be role models and share experiences; and that "symptoms" can be understood as expressions of distress related to emotions and other people. One such model from the US [[National Empowerment Center]] proposes a number of principles of how people recover and seeks to identify the characteristics of people in recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fisher, D. |title=Empowerment Model of Recovery From Severe Mental Illness |journal=Medscape Psychiatry & Mental Health |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=2005 |url=http://www.power2u.org/articles/recovery/expert_interview.html}}</ref> 

In general, recovery may be seen as more of a philosophy or attitude than a specific model, requiring fundamentally that "we regain personal power and a valued place in our communities. Sometimes we need services to support us to get there".<ref name="NZvision">Doug Banks, Jim Burdett, Vicki Burnett, Deb Christensen, Susie Crooks, Elva Edwards, Stewart Fenton, Seulata Fui, Maria Glanville, Sonja Goldsack, Alex Handiside, Chris Hansen, Anne Helm, Iwa Natana, Mary O'Hagan, Lina Samu, Ana Sokratov, Te Wera Te Kotua, John Tovey, Debra Wells and Ranui Wilson (2004) [http://www.mhc.govt.nz/documents/0000/0000/0097/MCH_OUR_LIVES_FINAL_B_.PDF Our Lives in 2014: A recovery vision from people with experience of mental illness] Published with the assistance of the New Zealand Mental Health Commission.</ref>

===Recovery from substance dependence===
Particular kinds of recovery models have been adopted in [[drug rehabilitation]] services. While interventions in this area have tended to focus on [[harm reduction]], particularly through [[Opioid replacement therapy|substitute prescribing]] (or alternatively requiring total abstinence) recovery approaches have emphasised the need to simultaneously address the whole of people's lives, and to encourage aspirations while promoting equal access and opportunities within society. From the perspective of services the work may include helping people with "developing the skills to prevent relapse into further illegal drug taking, rebuilding broken relationships or forging new ones, actively engaging in meaningful activities and taking steps to build a home and provide for themselves and their families. Milestones could be as simple as gaining weight, re-establishing relationships with friends, or building self-esteem. What is key is that recovery is sustained."<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/05/22161610/5 The Road to Recovery: A New Approach to Tackling Scotland's Drug Problem] by the Scottish Government, May 29, 2008</ref>

===Concerns===
Some concerns have been raised about a recovery approach in theory and in practice. These include suggestions that it: is an old concept; only happens to very few people; represents an irresponsible fad; happens only as a result of active treatment; implies a cure; can only be implemented with new resources; adds to the burden of already stretched providers; is neither reimbursable nor evidence based; devalues the role of professional intervention; and increases providers' exposure to risk and liability.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davidson L, O'Connell M, Tondora J, Styron T, Kangas K |title=The top ten concerns about recovery encountered in mental health system transformation |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=640–5 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16675756 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.57.5.640 |url=http://www.psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/5/640}}</ref> 

Other criticisms focused on practical implementation by service providers include that: the recovery model can be manipulated by officials to serve various political and financial interests including withdrawing services and pushing people out before they're ready; that it is becoming a new [[orthodoxy]] or bandwagon that neglects the empowerment aspects and structural problems of societies and primarily represents a [[middle class]] experience; that it hides the continued dominance of a medical model; and that it potentially increases social exclusion and marginalizes those who don't fit into a recovery narrative.<ref name="George2008">George, C.

There have been specific tensions between recovery models and "evidence-based practice" models in the transformation of US mental health services based on the recommendations of the [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Daly, R. |title=Tensions Complicate Efforts to Transform MH Systems |journal=Psychiatr News |volume=42 |issue=13 |pages=14 |date=July 6, 2007 |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/42/13/14}}</ref> The Commission's emphasis on recovery has been interpreted by some critics as saying that everyone can fully recover through sheer will power and therefore as giving false hope and implicitly blaming those who may be unable to recover.<ref>Torrey (2003) [http://www.psychlaws.org/PressRoom/stmtNewFreedomCommissionfailssickest.htm Treatment Advocacy Center Statement] Newswire. Retrieved on Aug 12 2008</ref> However, the critics have themselves been charged with undermining consumer rights and failing to recognize that the model is intended to support a person in their personal journey rather than expecting a given outcome, and that it relates to social and political support and empowerment as well as the individual.<ref name="McLean2003part2">McLean, A.

Various stages of resistance to recovery approaches have been identified amongst staff in traditional services, starting with "Our people [first of all, they aren't 'your people'] are much sicker than yours. They won't be able to recover" and ending in "Our doctors will never agree to this". However, ways to harness the energy of this perceived resistance and use it to move forward have been proposed.<ref>Lori Ashcraft, William A. Anthony (2008) [http://www.behavioral.net/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=64D490AC6A7D4FE1AEB453627F1A4A32&tier=4&id=7FBB70760ECD4C31ABAB3334B28B30B3 Addressing Resistance to Recovery:Strategies for working with staff resistant to change] Behavioral Healthcare: Tools for Transformation, March</ref> In addition, staff training materials have been developed by various organisations, for example by the National Empowerment Center.<ref>Ahern L, Fisher D.

Some positives and negatives of recovery models were highlighted in a study of a [[community mental health service]] for people diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. It was concluded that while the approach may be a useful corrective to the usual style of [[Case management (mental health)|case management]] - at least when genuinely chosen and shaped by each unique individual on the ground - serious social, institutional and personal difficulties made it essential that there be sufficient ongoing effective support with [[stress (biological)|stress]] management and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] in daily life. Cultural biases and uncertainties were also noted in the 'North American' model of recovery in practice, reflecting views about the sorts of contributions and lifestyles that should be considered valuable or acceptable.<ref>Neely Laurenzo Myers [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068598/?tool=pubmed Culture, Stress and Recovery from Schizophrenia: Lessons from the Field for Global Mental Health] Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry. 2010 September; 34(3): 500–528.</ref>

===Assessment===
A number of standardized questionnaires and assessments have been developed to try to assess aspects of an individual's recovery journey. These include the Milestones of Recovery (MOR) Scale, Recovery Enhancing Environment (REE) measure, Recovery Measurement Tool (RMT), Recovery Oriented System Indicators (ROSI) Measure,<ref>Website of the National Association of State Mental Health Directors [http://www.nasmhpd.org/spec_e-report_fall04measures.cfm Tools In Development: Measuring Recovery at the Individual, Program, and System Levels]</ref> Stages of Recovery Instrument (STORI),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andresen R, Caputi P, Oades L |title=Stages of recovery instrument: development of a measure of recovery from serious mental illness |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=40 |issue=11–12 |pages=972–80 |year=2006 |pmid=17054565 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1614.2006.01921.x |url= http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1614.2006.01921.x}}</ref> and numerous related instruments.<ref>Theodora Campbell-Orde, M.P.A., Judi Chamberlin, Jenneth Carpenter, M.S.W., & H.

The data-collection systems and terminology used by services and funders are said to be typically incompatible with recovery frameworks, so methods of adapting them have been developed.<ref>Lori Ashcraft, William A. Anthony (2007) [http://www.behavioral.net/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=64D490AC6A7D4FE1AEB453627F1A4A32&tier=4&id=64B71A73E917458AB8E40C683719BE0F Data Collection With Recovery In Mind: Involve service users as much as possible] Behavioral Healthcare: Tools for Transformation, September</ref> It has also been argued that the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (and to some extent any system of categorical [[classification of mental disorders]]) uses definitions and terminology that are inconsistent with a recovery model, leading to suggestions that the next version, the DSM-V, requires: greater sensitivity to cultural issues and gender; to recognize the need for others to change as well as just those singled out for a diagnosis of disorder; and to adopt a dimensional approach to assessment that better captures individuality and does not erroneously imply excess psychopathology or chronicity.<ref>Michael T.

==National policies and implementation==
===United States and Canada===
The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health has proposed to transform the mental health system in the US by shifting the [[paradigm]] of care from traditional medical psychiatric treatment toward the concept of recovery, and the [[American Psychiatric Association]] has endorsed a recovery model from a psychiatric services perspective.<ref>President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) [http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov/reports/FinalReport/FullReport.htm Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sharfstein, S. |title=Recovery Model Will Strengthen Psychiatrist-Patient Relationship |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=40 |issue=20 |pages=3 |year=2005 |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/40/20/3}}</ref> 

The [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] reports developing national and state initiatives to empower consumers and support recovery, with specific committees planning to launch nationwide pro-recovery, anti-stigma education campaigns; develop and synthesize recovery policies; train consumers in carrying out evaluations of mental health systems; and help further the development of peer-run services.<ref>US Dept of Health and Human Sciences [http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/NMH05-0193/default.asp Consumer-Directed Transformation to a Recovery-Based Mental Health System]</ref> Mental Health service directors and planners are providing guidance to help state services implement recovery approaches.<ref>NASMHPD/NTAC (2004) [http://www.nasmhpd.org/spec_e-report_fall04intro.cfm Implementing Recovery-based Care: Tangible Guidance for SMHAs]</ref>

Some US states, such as [[California]] (see the [[California Mental Health Services Act]]), [[Wisconsin]] and [[Ohio]], already report redesigning their mental health systems to stress recovery model values like hope, healing, empowerment, social connectedness, human rights, and recovery-oriented services.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jacobson N, Greenley D |title=What is recovery?
