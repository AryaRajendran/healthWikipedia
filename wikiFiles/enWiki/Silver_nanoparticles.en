'''Silver nanoparticles''' are [[nanoparticles]] of [[silver]], i.e. silver particles of between 1&nbsp;nm and 100&nbsp;nm in size. While frequently described as being 'silver' some are composed of a large percentage of silver oxide due to their large ratio of surface-to-bulk silver atoms.

==Synthesis==

There are many different synthetic routes to silver nanoparticles. They can be divided into three broad categories: [[physical vapor deposition]], [[ion implantation]], or wet chemistry.<ref>{{cite journal|author=H.Lu ''et al.''|title=Seed-mediated Plasmon-driven Regrowth of Silver Nanodecahedrons (NDs) |journal=Plasmonics|volume=7|issue=1|pages=167–173 |year=2011|doi=10.1007/s11468-011-9290-8|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/swzeng/AgNPs.pdf }}</ref>

===Ion implantation===

Although it may seem counter-intuitive, ion implantation has been used to create silver nanoparticles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stepanov|first1=A. L.|last2=Popok|first2=V. N.|last3=Hole|first3=D. E.|journal=Glass Physics and Chemistry|volume=28|issue=2|pages=90|year=2002|doi=10.1023/A:1015377530708}}</ref> This process has been shown to produce silver particles embedded in glass, polyurethane, silicone, polyethylene, and polymethylmethacrylate. The particles grow in the substrate with the bombardment of ions. The existence of nanoparticles is proven with optical absorbance, though the exact nature of the particles created with this method is not known.

===Wet chemistry===

There are several wet chemical methods for creating silver nanoparticles. Typically, they involve the reduction of a silver salt such as [[silver nitrate]] with a reducing agent like [[sodium borohydride]] in the presence of  colloidal stabilizer. Sodium borohydride has been used with [[polyvinyl alcohol]], poly(vinylpyrrolidone), bovine serum albumin (BSA), citrate and cellulose as stabilizing agents. In the case of BSA, the sulfur-, oxygen- and nitrogen-bearing groups mitigate the high surface energy of the nanoparticles during the reduction. The hydroxyl groups on the cellulose are reported to help stabilize the particles. Polydopamine coated magnetic-bacterial cellulose contains multifunctional groups, which acts as a reducing agent for in situ preparation of reusable antibacterial Ag-nanocomposites.<ref>Magnetic antimicrobial nanocomposite based on bacterial cellulose and silver nanoparticles Manthiriyappan Sureshkumar, Dessy Yovita Siswanto and Cheng-Kang Lee,  J. Mater. Chem., 2010, 20, 6948-6955.http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2010/JM/c0jm00565g</ref> Citrate and cellulose have been used to create silver nanoparticles independent of a reducing agent as well. An additional novel wet chemistry method used to create silver nanoparticles took advantage of ß-D-glucose as a reducing sugar and a starch as the stabilizer and also cellulose molecular chain is applied to employ the reducing and stabilizing features of cellulose to synthesize nano silver.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Montazer|first=Majid|coauthors=Farbod Alimohammadi, Ali Shamei, Mohammad Karim Rahimi|title=In situ synthesis of nano silver on cotton using Tollens’ reagent|journal=Carbohydrate Polymers|year=2012|month=Jan|volume=87|pages=1706– 1712|doi=10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.09.079}}</ref>

==Uses==
{{See also|Medical uses of silver}}

Over the last decades silver nanoparticles have found applications in [[catalysis]], [[optics]], [[electronics]] and other areas due to their unique size-dependent optical, electrical and
magnetic properties. Currently most of the applications of silver nanoparticles are in antibacterial/antifungal agents in biotechnology and bioengineering,
textile engineering, [[water treatment]], and silver-based consumer products.

There is also an effort to incorporate silver nanoparticles into a wide range of medical devices, including but not limited to 
*[[bone cement]],
*surgical instruments,
*surgical masks,
*wound dressings.

[[Samsung]] has created and marketed a material called [[Silver Nano]], that includes silver nanoparticles on the surfaces of household appliances.<ref>[http://www.appliancemagazine.com/news.php?article=9434&zone=0&first=1 Samsung's Silver Nano Washer Ads Reportedly Exaggerated], Nov 21, 2005</ref>

Silver nanoparticles have been used as the cathode in a [[silver-oxide battery]].

==Health concerns==

Exposure to silver nanoparticles has been associated with "inflammatory, oxidative, genotoxic, and cytotoxic consequences"; the silver particulates primarily accumulate in the liver.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnston HJ, Hutchison G, Christensen FM, Peters S, Hankin S, Stone V |title=A review of the in vivo and in vitro toxicity of silver and gold particulates: particle attributes and biological mechanisms responsible for the observed toxicity |journal=Crit.

*Argyria and staining: Ingested silver or silver compounds, including colloidal silver, can cause a condition called [[argyria]], a discoloration of the skin and organs.In 2006, there was a case study of a 17-year-old man, who sustained burns to 30% of his body, and experienced a temporary bluish-grey hue after several days of treatment with Acticoat, a brand of wound dressing containg silver nanoparticles.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Trop, Marji, Michael Novak, Siegfried Rodl, Bengt Hellbom, Wolfgang Kroell, and Walter Goeseeler|title=Silver-coated dressing acticaot caused raised liver enzymes and argyris-like symptoms in burn patient|journal=The Journal of Trauma, Injury, Infection and Critical Care|volume=60|year= 2006|issue=3|pages=648–652|doi=10.1097/01.ta.0000208126.22089.b6}}</ref> Argyria is the deposition of silver in deep tissues, a condition that cannot happen on a temporary basis, raising the question of whether the cause of the man’s discoloration was argyria or even a result of the silver treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Parkes, A. |title=Silver-coated dressing Acticoat|journal=Journal of Trauma-Injury Infection & Critical Care|volume=61|issue=1|year=2006|pages=239–40|doi=10.1097/01.ta.0000224131.40276.14}}</ref> Silver dressings are known to cause a “transient discoloration” that dissipates in 2–14 days, but not a permanent discoloration.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

*Silzone heart valve: [[St. Jude Medical]] released a mechanical heart valve with a silver coated sewing cuff (coated using ion beam-assisted deposition) in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0003-4975(00)02363-8|last1=Horstkotte|first1=D|last2=Bergemann|first2=R|title=Thrombogenicity of the St. Jude medical prosthesis with and without silzone-coated sewing cuffs|journal=The Annals of thoracic surgery|volume=71|issue=3|pages=1065|year=2001|pmid=11269440}}</ref> The valve was designed to reduce the instances of [[endocarditis]]. The valve was approved for sale in Canada, Europe, the United States, and most other markets around the world. In a post-commercialization study, researchers showed that the valve prevented tissue ingrowth, created paravalvular leakage, valve loosening, and in the worst cases explantation. After 3 years on the market and 36,000 implants, St. Jude discontinued and voluntarily recalled the valve.
