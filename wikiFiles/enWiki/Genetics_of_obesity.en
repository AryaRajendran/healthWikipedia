Like many other medical conditions, [[obesity]] is the result of an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphism]]s in various [[gene]]s controlling [[appetite]] and [[metabolism]] predispose to obesity under certain dietary conditions.  The percentage of obesity that can be attributed to genetics varies widely, depending on the population examined, from 6% to 85%.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yang W, Kelly T, He J |title=Genetic epidemiology of obesity |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=29 |issue= |pages=49–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17566051 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxm004}}</ref> As of 2006, more than 41 sites on the human genome have been linked to the development of obesity when a favorable environment is present.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poirier P, Giles TD, Bray GA, ''et al.'' |title=Obesity and cardiovascular disease: pathophysiology, evaluation, and effect of weight loss |journal=Arterioscler.

Some studies have focused upon inheritance patterns without focusing upon specific genes. One study found that 80% of the offspring of two obese parents were obese, in contrast to less than 10% of the offspring of two parents who were of normal weight.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kolata,Gina |title=Rethinking thin: The new science of weight loss - and the myths and realities of dieting |publisher=Picador |location= |year=2007 |pages=122 |isbn=0-312-42785-9}}</ref>

The [[thrifty gene hypothesis]] postulates that due to dietary scarcity during human evolution people are prone to obesity. Their ability to take advantage of rare periods of abundance by storing energy as fat would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves would be more likely survive [[famine]]. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chakravarthy MV, Booth FW |title=Eating, exercise, and "thrifty" genotypes: Connecting the dots toward an evolutionary understanding of modern chronic diseases |journal=J.

Numerous studies of laboratory rodents provide strong evidence that genetics plays an important role in obesity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Theodore_Garland, Jr.|Garland T, Jr]], Schutz H, Chappell MA, Keeney BK, Meek TH, Copes LE, Acosta W, Drenowatz, C, Maciel RC, van Dijk G, Kotz CM, Eisenmann JC|title=The biological control of voluntary exercise, spontaneous physical activity and daily energy expenditure in relation to obesity: human and rodent perspectives |journal=J.

==Genetic syndromes==
Obesity is also a major feature in several syndromes, such as [[Prader-Willi syndrome]], [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[Cohen syndrome]], [[Ayazi syndrome]], and [[MOMO syndrome]]. (The term "non-syndromic obesity" is sometimes used to exclude these conditions.)<ref name="pmid19506576">{{cite journal |author=Walley AJ, Asher JE, Froguel P |title=The genetic contribution to non-syndromic human obesity |journal=Nat.
