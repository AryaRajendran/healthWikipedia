==Early life and medical training==
Born in [[Poland]] shortly after the end of [[World War II]], Hiss was 10 years old when he arrived in Israel. He later undertook his medical training there, and in [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]].<ref name=Myre>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/24/world/israeli-pathologist-faces-grisly-task-after-the-bombings.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/V/Violence&pagewanted=all|title=Israeli Pathologist Faces Grisly Task After the Bombings|author=Greg Myre|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=February 24, 2004|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>

==Career==
Hiss became the director and chief pathologist at Abu Kabir in 1988. As director of the Institute, Hiss was involved with high profile cases. Hiss performed the autopsy on [[Yitzhak Rabin]] after his 1995 assassination; his report was challenged in March 1999 by a group of Israeli academics.<ref>[[Israel National News]], 26 September 2005, [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/90518 Infamous Chief Pathologist to Once Again Evade Punishment]</ref> In May 2003, he confirmed the identification of the body that washed ashore the beaches of Tel Aviv to be that of Omar Sharif, the accomplice of Asif Hanif, who carried out the [[Mike's Place suicide bombing]] the month previous.<ref name=Guardian1>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/may/20/israel|title=Mystery of the last hours of failed suicide bomber found dead in sea|author1=Chris McGreal|author2=Jeevan Vasagar|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 20, 2003 | location=London | first=Chris | last=McGreal}}</ref> Hiss told [[Haaretz]] that Sharif's DNA was matched to samples provided by two British detectives and the cause of death was determined to be drowning.<ref name=Haaretz1>{{cite web|title=British bomber's body identified|author=Haaretz Staff|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=294817&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=May 19, 2003|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref> He also performed the autopsy on [[Rachel Corrie]].

A piece featuring Hiss that appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in February 2004 noted Hiss played a "unique role" in the response network that Israel had to developed to deal with the more than 100 suicide bombings it had experienced over the three years previous. All the dead from such attacks are brought to the Forensic Institute, and Hiss had been present to attend to, "the dismembered victims and shattered victims," in all but one attack.<ref name=Myre/> The same article mentions the controversy surrounding Hiss as follows: <blockquote>"While the forensic center is praised for its work after bombings, Dr. Hiss has been involved in controversies related to other cases, including allegations that the institute removed organs from corpses without permission from the families. The issue is enormously sensitive because of [[Judaism]]'s emphasis on burying the whole body. Government inquiries have not resulted in any charges against Dr. Hiss. But in December the Israeli attorney general recommended disciplinary action. The issue is still under consideration, and no sanctions have been imposed so far."<ref name=Myre/></blockquote>

In January 2006, following the carrying out of an autopsy that was ordered by the Israeli courts for a Haredi woman found murdered in her apartment, a riot by dozens of [[Haredim]] took place inside the institute where Hiss worked. According to Dr. Benny Davidson, the manager of the institute, "Even in the institute's darkest days, there wasn't an event this big. They wrecked the entire hall, broke expensive equipment, and destroyed (institute director) Yehuda Hiss' room. The public reaction to the articles on the pathological institute was an abandonment of Hiss."<ref name=Ynet1>{{cite web|title=Haredim ransack Forensics Institute|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3208824,00.html|author=Ynet reporters|date=January 31, 2006|accessdate=2009-10-01|publisher=[[YNET]]}}</ref>

== Allegations of organ harvesting ==
According to Rebecca Dube in the ''[[The Forward|Forward]]'', allegations that Hiss and his lab were taking organs from corpses without permission and using them for research or selling them to medical schools have a long history and were substantiated by the Israeli government.<ref name=Dube/> The allegations first appeared in 1998, after Alistair Sinclair, a Scottish tourist apprehended on suspicion of dealing drugs, died in a holding cell at [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], apparently having hanged himself.<ref name=Dube/><ref name=Rosenblum/> After an autopsy overseen by Hiss, the body was returned to his family; a second autopsy performed by pathologists at the [[University of Glasgow]] found that the heart and a small bone at the base of his tongue were missing.<ref name=Dube/> [[Jonathan Rosenblum]] reported that the missing bone from his neck was considered necessary to confirming that he had hanged himself as stated, and that the Sinclair family believed his heart had been used for transplant.<ref name=Rosenblum/> The scandal was publicized by media in Israel and Scotland after the family sued.<ref name=Dube/>

Rosenblum, writing in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' in October 2000 regarding a case in which Hiss' testimony played a crucial role, also discussed how Hiss has long been a source of controversy. He related that a 12-page investigative report in November 1999 by the local [[Tel Aviv]] newspaper [[Ha'ir]] stated that medical students at Abu Kabir under Hiss' direction were allowed to practice on bodies sent there for autopsy, and body parts were transferred for transplant use without permission from the families concerned.<ref name=Rosenblum/> In January 2001, an investigative report in [[Yediot Aharonot]] claimed the institute headed by Hiss had been involved in "organ sales" of body parts to universities and medical schools for research and training, citing evidence including the "price listings" for body parts.<ref name=Judy>{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7279.128/d|author=Judy Siegel-Itzkovich|location=Jerusalem|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abridged/322/7279/128/d|journal=BMJ|date=January 20, 2001|volume=322|issue=128|version=Abridged|title=News roundup: "Sale of organs" to be investigated}}</ref>

Israel's [[Israeli Health Ministry|Ministry of Health]] convened a committee to investigate the claims which found that Hiss had been involved for years in the sale of illegally removed body parts to medical schools.<ref name=Dube/><ref name=Judy/> Rebecca Dube in the [[The Forward|Forward]] writes that Hiss was never charged with any crime, but was forced to step down from running the state morgue in 2004. According to Dube, "the final straw, apparently, was when the body of a youth killed in a road accident was gnawed upon by a rat in Hiss's lab."<ref name=Dube/> Every body that ended up in Hiss' morgue, whether Israeli or Palestinian, was fair game for organ harvesting.<ref name=Dube>{{Cite web|title=Illicit Body-Part Sales Present Widespread Problem|author=Rebecca Dube|publisher=[[The Forward|Forward]]|date=August 26, 2009, issue of September 04, 2009|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/112915/|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>

Hiss ceased being the director of the institute in 2005 when allegations of a trade in organs resurfaced.<ref name=Cook/> After Hiss admitted to having removed parts from 125 bodies without authorization, and following a [[plea bargain]] with the State of Israel, Israel's attorney-general, decided not to press criminal charges.<ref name=Cook/> Hiss was given only a reprimand and continued to hold his position as chief pathologist at Abu Kabir and eventually regained his position as director.<ref name=Cook>{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/963/op2.htm|title=But did it happen?|author=[[Jonathan Cook]]|publisher=[[Al-Ahram]]|date=September 3–9, 2009; Issue No. 963}}</ref><ref name="health.gov.il"/>
