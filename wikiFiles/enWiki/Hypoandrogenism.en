'''Hypoandrogenism''', or '''androgen deficiency''', is a [[medical condition]] characterized by an insufficient amount of [[androgen]]ic activity in the body.

==Causes==
Hypoandrogenism is caused primarily by either dysfunction, failure, or absence of the [[gonad]]s (''[[hypergonadotropic hypogonadism|hypergonadotropic]]'') or impairment of the [[hypothalamus]] or [[pituitary gland]] (''[[hypogonadotropic hypogonadism|hypogonadotropic]]''), which in turn can be caused by a multitude of different stimuli, including [[genetic condition]]s (e.g., [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]]/[[gonadotropin]] insensitivity and [[disorders of steroidogenesis|enzymatic defects of steroidogenesis]]), [[tumor]]s, [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[surgery]], [[autoimmunity]], [[radiation therapy|radiation]], [[infection]]s, [[toxin]]s, [[drug]]s, and many others. Alternatively, it may be the result of conditions such as [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] or [[hyperestrogenism]]. More simply, [[old age]] may also be a factor in the development of hypoandrogenism, as androgen levels decline with age.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs of hypoandrogenism in both sexes may include lowered levels of androgens such as [[testosterone]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]], abnormally high or low levels of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and/or [[luteinizing hormone]], and heightened or lowered levels of [[estrogen]]s such as [[estradiol]].

Symptoms of the condition in males consist of loss of [[libido]], [[impotence]], [[infertility]], shrinkage of the [[testicle]]s, [[penis]], and [[prostate]], diminished [[virilization|masculinization]] (e.g., decreased [[facial hair|facial]] and [[body hair]] growth), low [[muscle]] mass, [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[hot flash]]es, [[insomnia]], [[headache]]s, and [[osteoporosis]]. In addition, symptoms of [[hyperestrogenism]], such as [[gynecomastia]] and [[feminization (biology)|feminization]], may be concurrently present in males. In females, hypoandrogenism generally presents predominantly as psychological symptoms such as loss of libido, lowered [[mood (psychology)|mood]], blunted [[motivation]], [[blunted affect|flat affect]], reduced [[energy]], but may also present with other symptoms such as decreased [[pubic hair]] growth, [[vasocongestion|vaginal vasocongestion]] (which can result in [[cramp]]s), [[vasomotor symptom]]s (e.g., hot flashes and [[palpitation]]s), insomnia, headaches, and reduced [[bone density|bone]] and [[muscle]] mass.<ref name="pmid16821229">{{cite journal | author = Jakiel G, Baran A | title = [Androgen deficiency in women] | language = Polish | journal = Endokrynologia Polska | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 1016–20 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16821229 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid12007907">{{cite journal | author = Bachmann GA | title = The hypoandrogenic woman: pathophysiologic overview | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 77 Suppl 4 | issue = | pages = S72–6 | year = 2002 | month = April | pmid = 12007907 | doi = | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028202030030}}</ref><ref name="Bremner2003">{{cite book | author = William J.

==Treatments==
Treatment may consist of [[hormone replacement therapy]] with [[androgen]]s in either sex. Alternatively, [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH)/[[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist|GnRH agonist]]s or [[gonadotropin]]s may be given (in the case of ''hypogonadotropic'' hypoandrogenism).
