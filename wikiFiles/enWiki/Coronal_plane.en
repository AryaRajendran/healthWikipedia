A '''coronal plane''' (also known as the '''frontal plane''') is any vertical plane that divides the body into [[ventral]] and [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] (belly and back) sections.

It is one of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Planes|planes]] of the body used to describe the location of body parts in relation to each other.

==Examples==
For a human, the mid-coronal plane would transect a standing body into two halves (front and back, or anterior and posterior) in an imaginary line that cuts through both shoulders.

==Terminology==
The term is derived from Latin corona (“‘garland, crown’”), from Ancient Greek κορώνη (korōnē), “‘garland, wreath’”).

==Larger perspective==
The ''coronal plane'' is an example of a [[Anatomical terms of location#General usage|longitudinal plane]], because it is perpendicular to the transverse plane.
