==Background==
Noerine Kaleeba specialised in [[orthopaedics]], physiotherapy and community rehabilitation at [[Makerere University]] in [[Kampala]], and the [[Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic & District Hospital]] in [[Oswestry]], [[England]]. She has worked as a physiotherapist at [[Mulago Hospital]], and was the principal of Mulago School of Physiotherapy until 1987.

In 1987, Kaleeba and 15 other colleagues, most of whom have died of AIDS, set up a support group which became the organization, "The AIDS Support Organization" (TASO), to provide care, support and counselling, and to mobilize communities and neighbourhood care for people with [[HIV/AIDS]] and their families. Based on the concept of "positive living", TASO was one of the very first community responses to [[AIDS in Africa]] and is today one of the leading examples in AIDS care and support and community education for prevention in resource-limited settings. Kaleeba worked as the Executive Director of TASO Uganda for eight years until 1995 when she retired, and was elected Patron of the TASO movement, a role she still plays. Kaleeba currently works as a programme development adviser, Africa, for the "Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS" (UNAIDS), and has been based at their secretariat in [[Geneva]] since January 1996.

Kaleeba has been awarded several international awards in recognition of her national and global anti-AIDS efforts, including The [[Belgian]] International King Baudouin Prize for Development, awarded to TASO in 1995, and [[Doctor of Humane Letters]], Honorius Causa, in 2000. She has served on various national and international bodies, including the [[World Health Organization]] Global Commission on HIV/AIDS, the [[Global AIDS Policy Coalition]] and the [[Uganda AIDS Commission]]. She has been a trustee of international NGO boards such as [[Maristopes International]], [[Noah's Ark (Sweden)]], and is currently Vice-Chair of [[ActionAid]].

Her book, "We Miss You All: AIDS In The Family" is a touching account of how HIV/AIDS came into her life, and how she came to be on the front lines fighting the disease.
