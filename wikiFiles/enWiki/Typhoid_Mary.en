}}'''Mary Mallon''' (September 23, 1869&nbsp;– November 11, 1938), better known as '''Typhoid Mary''', was the first person in the United States identified as an [[asymptomatic carrier]] of the pathogen associated with [[typhoid fever]]. She was presumed to have infected some 51 people, three of whom died, over the course of her career as a cook.<ref name = NYT>{{cite news |title='Typhoid Mary' Dies Of A Stroke At 69.

== Asymptomatic carrier ==
Individuals can develop typhoid fever after ingesting food or water contaminated during handling by a human carrier. The human carrier may be a healthy person who has survived a previous episode of typhoid fever yet who continues to shed the associated bacteria, ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'', in [[feces]] and [[urine]]. Washing hands with soap before touching or preparing food, washing dishes and utensils with soap and water, and only eating cooked food are all ways to reduce the risk of typhoid infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kznhealth.gov.za/typhoid1.htm |title=Hygiene helps you prevent Typhoid fever |publisher=Kznhealth.gov.za |date= |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>

== Days as a cook ==
Mary Mallon was born in 1869 in [[Cookstown]], [[County Tyrone]], Ireland (now [[Northern Ireland]]). She emigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1884. From 1900 to 1907 she worked as a cook in the New York City area.

In 1900, Mary worked in [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck, New York]], where, within two weeks of her employment, the residents developed typhoid fever. She moved to [[Manhattan]] in 1901, and members of the family for whom she worked developed fevers and [[diarrhea]] and the laundress died. Mallon then went to work for a lawyer until seven of the eight household members developed typhoid.<ref name = "The Straight Dope">Dex and McCaff, [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1816/who-was-typhoid-mary "Who was Typhoid Mary?"] The Straight Dope, Aug 14, 2000</ref>

In 1906, she took a position in [[Oyster Bay, Long Island]], where, within two weeks, ten of eleven family members were hospitalized with typhoid. She changed employment again, and similar occurrences happened in three more households.

In Oyster Bay, she worked as a cook for a wealthy New York banker, Charles Henry Warren, and his family. When the Warrens rented a house in Oyster Bay for the summer of 1906, Mallon came along. From August 27 to September 3, six of the eleven people in the house came down with typhoid fever. Typhoid fever in Oyster Bay at that time was "unusual", according to three doctors who practiced medicine there.

Mary was subsequently hired by other families, and outbreaks followed her.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/>

=== Investigation ===

In the winter of 1906, one of the families hired typhoid researcher [[George Soper]] to investigate. Soper published the results of his investigation on June 15, 1907 in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association''; he believed soft clams might be the source of the outbreak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-history-hs702a,0,6698943.story|title=Historical Snapshots|date=2009-04-12|work=Dinner with Typhoid Mary|publisher=Newsday}}</ref> He then wrote:

<blockquote>
"It was found that the family changed cooks on August 4. This was about three weeks before the typhoid epidemic broke out. She remained in the family only a short time, leaving about three weeks after the outbreak occurred. The cook was described as an Irish woman about 40 years of age, tall, heavy, single. She seemed to be in perfect health."
</blockquote>

Soper discovered that the common element in the outbreaks was an unmarried, heavyset Irish cook, about forty years old.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> No one knew her whereabouts.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> After each case she left and gave no forwarding address.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> Dr. Soper traced her to an active outbreak in a Park Avenue penthouse—two servants were hospitalized and the daughter of the family died.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/>

When Soper approached Mallon about her possible role spreading typhoid, she adamantly rejected his request for urine and stool samples. Soper left and later published the report in June 1907, in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Soper|first = George A.|title = The work of a chronic typhoid germ distributor|journal = [[J Am Med Assoc]]|volume = 48|pages = 2019–22|date = June 15, 1907}}</ref> Since Mary refused to give urine and stool samples, Soper decided to compile a five-year history of Mary's employment. Soper found that out of eight families that took in Mary as a cook, seven families claimed to have gotten typhoid fever.<ref name=Satin>{{cite book|last=Satin|first=Morton|title=Death in the Pot|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=New York|page=169}}</ref> On his next contact with her, he brought a doctor with him but was turned away again. During a later encounter when Mary was hospitalised, he told her that he would write a book about her and give her all the royalties.  She angrily rejected his proposal and locked herself in the bathroom until he left.

=== First quarantine (1907–1910) ===
[[Image:Mary Mallon in hospital.jpg|thumb|Mary Mallon (foreground) in a hospital bed during her first quarantine.]]
The New York City Health Department sent Dr. [[Sara Josephine Baker]] to talk to Mary. Baker stated "by that time she was convinced that the law was only persecuting her when she had done nothing wrong."<ref name = About.com>{{cite web | url = http://history1900s.about.com/library/weekly/aa062900b.htm | title = Typhoid Mary | author = Rosenberg, Jennifer | work = About.com | accessdate =June 6, 2007 }}</ref>
A few days later, Baker arrived at Mary's workplace with several police officers who took her into custody.

Mary got so much attention from the media that in 1908, in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' she was referred to as "typhoid Mary" and later on in a textbook that defined typhoid fever, Mary was referred to as "Typhoid Mary" with the capital "T" in "Typhoid."<ref name=Satin>{{cite book|last=Satin|first=Morton|title=Death in the Pot|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=New York|page=171}}</ref>
Under questioning, Mary said she rarely washed her hands when cooking and felt there was no need.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> Cultures of Mary's urine and stools, taken forcibly with the help of prison matrons, revealed that her gallbladder was teeming with typhoid salmonella.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> She refused to have her gallbladder extracted or to give up her occupation as cook, maintaining stubbornly that she did not carry any disease.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/>

The New York City health inspector determined her to be a carrier. Under sections 1169 and 1170 of the Greater New York Charter, Mallon was held in isolation for three years at a clinic located on [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]].<ref name="The Straight Dope"/>

Eventually, the New York State Commissioner of Health, Eugene H. Porter, M.D., decided that disease carriers would no longer be held in isolation. Mallon could be freed if she agreed to abandon working as a cook and to take reasonable steps to prevent transmitting typhoid to others. On February 19, 1910, Mallon agreed that she "[was] prepared to change her occupation (that of a cook), and would give assurance by affidavit that she would upon her release take such hygienic precautions as would protect those with whom she came in contact, from infection". She was released from quarantine and returned to the mainland.<ref name="isbe"/>

==== Release and name-change ====
Upon release, Mallon was given a job as a [[laundress]], which paid lower wages. Mallon changed her name to ''Mary Brown'', and returned to her previous occupation as a cook. For the next five years, she was employed in a number of kitchens, and wherever she worked, there were outbreaks of typhoid. However, she changed jobs frequently, and Dr. Soper was unable to catch her.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/>

In 1915, a serious epidemic of typhoid erupted among the staff of New York's [[Sloane Hospital for Women]], with twenty five cases and two deaths. City health authorities investigated, learning that an Irish-American woman matching Mallon's description had suddenly disappeared from the kitchen help. The police tracked her to an estate on Long Island.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/><ref name="isbe">{{cite web | url=http://www.isbe.net/career/pdf/fcs_guide.pdf | title=Food Science Curriculum | format=PDF | publisher=Illinois State Board of Education | page=118 | accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref>

=== Second quarantine (1915–1938) ===
[[Public health|Public-health]] authorities again found and arrested Mallon, returning her to [[quarantine]] on [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]] on March 27, 1915.<ref name="isbe"/> Mallon was confined there for the remainder of her life. She became something of a minor celebrity, and was interviewed by journalists, who were forbidden to accept even a glass of water from her.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> Later, she was allowed to work as a technician in the island's laboratory.

== Death ==
[[File:Typhoid carrier polluting food - a poster.jpg|thumb|250px|A historical poster warning against acting like Typhoid Mary]]

Mallon spent the rest of her life in quarantine. Six years before her death, she was paralyzed by a stroke. On November 11, 1938, aged 69, she died of [[pneumonia]].<ref name = NYT/><ref name = About.com/> An [[autopsy]] found evidence of live typhoid bacteria in her [[gallbladder]].<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> Her body was cremated, and the ashes were buried at [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery]] in [[the Bronx]].

== Legacy ==
Exactly how many people were infected or killed by her is not known.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> She refused to cooperate with health authorities, withheld information about her past, and used different pseudonyms when she changed cities.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/> Three deaths have been definitively attributed to her, with estimates running as high as 50.<ref name="The Straight Dope"/>

Mallon was the first healthy typhoid carrier to be identified by medical science, and there was no policy providing guidelines for handling the situation. Some difficulties surrounding her case stemmed from Mallon's vehement denial of her possible role, as she refused to acknowledge any connection between her working as a cook and the typhoid cases.  Mallon maintained that she was perfectly healthy, had never had typhoid fever, and could not be the source. Public-health authorities determined that permanent quarantine was the only way to prevent Mallon from causing significant future typhoid outbreaks.

Other healthy typhoid carriers identified in the first quarter of the 20th century include Tony Labella, an Italian immigrant, presumed to have caused over 100 cases (with five deaths); an Adirondack guide dubbed ''Typhoid John'', presumed to have infected 36 people (with two deaths); and Alphonse Cotils, a restaurateur and bakery owner.<ref>20/Feb/2007 [http://cythereabast.wordpress.com/2007/02/20/the-board-of-healths-exile-of-mary-mallon-was-it-justifiable "The Board of Health’s Exile of Mary Mallon: Was it Justifiable?"]</ref>

Today, ''Typhoid Mary'' is a generic term for anyone who, knowingly or not, spreads something undesirable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typhoid+mary?s=t |title=Dictionary Reference Website: Typhoid Mary |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-29}}</ref>
