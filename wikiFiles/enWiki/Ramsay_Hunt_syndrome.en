At least three separate neurological syndromes carry the name of '''Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS)''', their only connection being that they were all first described by [[James Ramsay Hunt]] (1872–1937):
* [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I]], also called ''Ramsay Hunt cerebellar syndrome'', is a rare form of cerebellar degeneration which involves [[myoclonus|myoclonic]] epilepsy, progressive [[ataxia]], [[tremor]], and a [[dementia|dementing]] process.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ramsayhunt.org/epon.shtml | title = Ramsay Hunt Syndrome | accessdate = 2011-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyssynergia/dyssynergia.htm | title = National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | date = February 14, 2011}}</ref>

* [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II]] is the reactivation syndrome of herpes zoster in the [[geniculate ganglion]]. It has variable presentation which may include a lower motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve, [[deafness]], [[vertigo]], and pain.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hunt JR | title= On herpetic inflammations of the geniculate ganglion: a new syndrome and its complications| journal= J Nerv Ment Dis| year= 1907| pages= 73–96| volume= 34 | doi= 10.1097/00005053-190702000-00001 | issue=2}}</ref><ref name="pmid11459884">{{cite journal |author=Sweeney CJ, Gilden DH |title=Ramsay Hunt syndrome |journal=J.

* Ramsay Hunt syndrome type III is a less commonly referenced condition, an occupationally induced [[neuropathy]] of the [[deep palmar branch]] of the [[ulnar nerve]]. It is also called ''[[Hunt's disease]]'' or ''[[Artisan's palsy]]''.<ref>http://www.ramsayhunt.org/epon.shtml Ramsay Hunt Syndrome</ref>
