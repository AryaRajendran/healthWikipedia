The term '''spinal nerve''' generally refers to a mixed spinal [[nerve]], which carries motor, sensory, and autonomic signals between the spinal cord and the body. Humans have 31 left-right pairs of spinal nerves, each roughly corresponding to a segment of the [[vertebral column]]: 8 cervical spinal nerve pairs (C1-C8), 12 thoracic pairs (T1-T12), 5 lumbar pairs (L1-L5), 5 sacral pairs (S1-S5), and 1 coccygeal pair. The spinal nerves are part of the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS).

==Anatomy==
Each spinal nerve is formed by the combination of nerve fibers from the [[Posterior root of spinal nerve|dorsal]] and [[Anterior root of spinal nerve|ventral]] roots of the [[spinal cord]]. The dorsal roots carry [[afferent nerve|afferent]] [[sensory neuron|sensory]] [[axons]], while the ventral roots carry [[efferent nerve|efferent]] [[motoneuron|motor]] axons. The spinal nerve emerges from the spinal column through an opening ([[intervertebral foramen]]) between adjacent vertebrae. This is true for all spinal nerves except for the first spinal nerve pair, which emerges between the [[occipital bone]] and the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] (the first vertebra). Thus the cervical nerves are numbered by the vertebra below, except C8, which exists below C7 and above T1. The thoracic, lumbar, and sacral nerves are then numbered by the vertebra above. In the case of a lumbarized S1 vertebra (aka L6) or a sacralized L5 vertebra, the nerves are typically still counted to L5 and the next nerve is S1.

Outside the vertebral column, the nerve divides into branches. The [[dorsal ramus]] contains nerves that serve the dorsal portions of the trunk carrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and somatic sensory information to and from the skin and
muscles of the back ([[epaxial muscles]]). The [[ventral ramus]] contains nerves that serve the remaining ventral parts of the trunk and the upper and lower limbs ([[hypaxial muscles]]) carrying visceral motor, somatic motor, and sensory information to and from the ventrolateral
body surface, structures in the body wall, and the limbs. The [[Meningeal branches of spinal nerve|meningeal branches (recurrent meningeal or sinuvertebral nerves)]] branch from the spinal nerve and re-enter the intervertebral foramen to serve the ligaments, dura, blood vessels, intervertebral discs, facet joints, and periosteum of the vertebrae. The [[rami communicantes]] contain autonomic nerves that serve visceral functions carrying visceral motor and sensory information to and from the visceral organs.

Some ventral rami merge with adjacent ventral rami to form a [[nerve plexus]], a network of interconnecting nerves. Nerves emerging from a plexus contain fibers from various spinal nerves, which are now carried together to some target location. Major plexuses include the [[cervical plexus|cervical]], [[brachial plexus|brachial]], [[lumbar plexus|lumbar]], and [[sacral plexus|sacral]] plexuses.

==Clinical significance==
The muscles that one particular spinal root supplies are that nerve's [[myotome]], and the [[dermatome (anatomy)|dermatomes]] are the areas of sensory innervation on the skin for each spinal nerve. Lesions of one or more nerve roots result in typical patterns of neurologic defects ([[muscle weakness]], abnormal sensation, changes in reflexes) that allow localization of the causeating lesion.
