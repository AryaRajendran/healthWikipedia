'''Bone marrow examination''' refers to the [[pathology|pathologic]] analysis of samples of [[bone marrow]] obtained by '''bone marrow biopsy''' (often called a [[trephine]] biopsy) and '''bone marrow aspiration'''.   Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including [[leukemia]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[lymphoma]], [[anemia]], and [[pancytopenia]].  The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the [[blood]], including [[platelet]]s, [[red blood cell]]s and [[white blood cell]]s. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by [[phlebotomy]]), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on [[hematopoiesis]]; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.

==Components of the procedure==

Bone marrow samples can be obtained by '''aspiration''' and '''trephine biopsy'''.  Sometimes, a bone marrow examination will include both an aspirate and a biopsy.  The aspirate yields semi-liquid bone marrow, which can be examined by a [[pathologist]] under a [[light microscope]] and analyzed by [[flow cytometry]], [[cytogenetics|chromosome analysis]], or [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). Frequently, a trephine biopsy is also obtained, which yields a narrow, cylindrically shaped solid piece of bone marrow, 2mm wide and 2&nbsp;cm long (80 μL), which is examined microscopically (sometimes with the aid of [[immunohistochemistry]]) for cellularity and infiltrative processes. An aspiration, using a 20 mL syringe, yields approximately 300 μL of bone marrow.<ref name=emedicine/> A volume greater than 300 μL is not recommended, since it may dilute the sample with peripheral blood.<ref name=emedicine>[http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2971.htm eMedicine Specialties &gt;  Hematology &gt; Diagnostic Procedures &gt; Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy] Article Last Updated: April 7, 2008</ref>

Aspiration does not always represent all cells since some such as [[lymphoma]] stick to the [[Cancellous bone|trabecula]], and would thus be missed by a simple aspiration.

==Site of procedure==

Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy are usually performed on the back of the hipbone, or posterior [[iliac crest]]. However, an ''aspirate'' can also be obtained from the [[Human sternum|sternum]] (breastbone). A ''trephine biopsy'' should never be performed on the sternum, due to the risk of injury to [[blood vessel]]s, [[lung]]s or the [[heart]].

==How the test is performed==

A bone marrow biopsy may be done in a health care provider's office or in a hospital. [[Informed consent]] for the procedure is typically required. The patient is asked to lie on his or her abdomen ([[prone]] position) or on his/her side (lateral [[decubitus]] position). The skin is cleansed, and a [[local anesthetic]] such as [[lidocaine]] or [[procaine]] is injected to numb the area. Patients may also be pretreated with [[analgesic]]s and/or [[anxiolytic|anti-anxiety medications]], although this is not a routine practice.

Typically, the aspirate is performed first. An aspirate needle is inserted through the skin using manual pressure and force until it abuts the [[bone]]. Then, with a twisting motion of clinician's hand and wrist, the needle is advanced through the [[cortical bone|bony cortex]] (the hard outer layer of the bone) and into the marrow cavity. Once the needle is in the marrow cavity, a syringe is attached and used to aspirate ("suck out") liquid bone marrow. A twisting motion is performed during the aspiration to avoid excess content of blood in the sample, which might be the case if an excessively large sample from one single point is taken.

Subsequently, the biopsy is performed if indicated.  A different, larger [[trephine]] needle is inserted and anchored in the bony cortex. The needle is then advanced with a twisting motion and rotated to obtain a solid piece of bone marrow. This piece is then removed along with the needle. The entire procedure, once preparation is complete, typically takes 10–15 minutes.

If several samples are taken, the needle is removed between the samples to avoid blood coagulation.

In 2010, a power system was offered for sale.  Previously, needles were forced through the bone manually, which required significant upper-body strength and effort by the person performing the procedure.  The power system, made of a specially designed needle and a powered driver similar to a [[power drill]], produced comparable or better core sample quality in tests.<ref>Lichtman,, Marshall A. , et al. 6th Edition Williams Manual of Hematology.

==After the procedure==

After the procedure is complete, the patient is typically asked to lie flat for 5–10 minutes to provide pressure over the procedure site. After that, assuming no bleeding is observed, the patient can get up and go about their normal activities. [[Paracetamol]] (aka acetaminophen) or other simple analgesics can be used to ease soreness, which is common for 2–3 days after the procedure. Any worsening pain, redness, fever, bleeding or swelling may suggest a complication. Patients are also advised to avoid washing the procedure site for at least 24 hours after the procedure is completed.

==Contraindications==

There are few [[contraindications]] to bone marrow examination. The only absolute reason to avoid performing a bone marrow examination is the presence of a severe bleeding disorder which may lead to serious bleeding after the procedure. If there is a skin or soft tissue infection over the hip, a different site should be chosen for bone marrow examination. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy can be safely performed even in the setting of extreme [[thrombocytopenia]] (low [[platelet]] count).

==Complications==

While mild soreness lasting 12–24 hours is common after a bone marrow examination, serious [[complication (medicine)|complications]] are extremely rare. In a large review, an estimated 55,000 bone marrow examinations were performed, with 26 [[serious adverse event]]s (0.05%), including one fatality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bain BJ |title=Bone marrow biopsy morbidity and mortality |journal=Br.
