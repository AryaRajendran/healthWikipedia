The '''upper extremity''', '''proximal extremity''' or '''superior epiphysis of the femur''' is the part of the [[femur]] closes to the [[pelvic bone]] and the [[Torso|trunk]]. It contains the following structures:
* [[Femur head]] including the [[Fovea of head of femur|fovea]] 
* [[Femur neck]]
* [[Greater trochanter]]
* [[Lesser trochanter]]
* [[Intertrochanteric line]]
* [[Intertrochanteric crest]]
* [[Trochanteric fossa]]
* [[Linea quadrata]]
* [[Quadrate tubercle]]

The [[femur head|head of femur]], which [[joint (anatomy)|articulates]] with the [[acetabulum]] of the [[pelvic bone]], composes two-thirds of a [[sphere]]. It has a small grove, or [[Fovea of head of femur|foeva]], connected trough the [[Ligament of head of femur|round ligament]] to the sides of the [[acetabular notch]]. The head of the femur is connected to the [[shaft of femur|shaft]] through the [[neck of femur|neck]] or ''collum''. The neck is 4-5 cm. long and the diameter is smallest front to back and compressed at its middle. The collum forms an angle with the shaft in about 130 degrees. This angle is highly variant. In the [[infant]] it is about 150 degrees and in [[old age]] reduced to 120 degrees in average. An abnormal increase in the angle is known as [[coxa valga]] and an abnormal reduction is called [[coxa vara]]. Both the head and neck of the femur is vastly embedded in the [[Muscles of the hip|hip musculature]] and can not be directly [[Palpation|palpated]]. In skinny people with the thigh laterally rotated the head of the femur can be felt deep as an resistance [[profound]] (deep) for the [[femoral artery]].<ref name=Bojsen>{{cite book |last=Bojsen-Møller |first=Finn  |last2=Simonsen |first2=Erik B. |last3=Tranum-Jensen |first3=Jørgen| year=2001 |title=Bevægeapparatets anatomi |edition=12th |language=Danish |trans_title=Anatomy of the Locomotive Apparatus | isbn =978-87-628-0307-7|pages=239-241 |accessdate=December 06, 2012}}</ref>

In the trassition area between the head and neck is quite rough due to attachement of muscles and the [[capsule of hip joint|hip joint capsule]]. Here the two [[Human trochanter|trochanter]]s, [[greater trochanter|greater]] and [[lesser trochanter]], is found. The greater trochanter is almost box-shaped and is the most [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] prominent of the femur. The highest point of the greater trochanter is located higher than the collum and reaches the mid point of the [[hip joint]]. The greater trochanter can easily be felt. The [[trochanteric fossa]] is a deep depression bounded posteriorly by the intertrochanteric crest on medial surface of the greater trochanter. Anterior and superior to the trochanteric fossa is a shallower depression known as the Unnamed Fossa. The Unnamed Fossa is the insertion point of the Superior Gemellus, Obturator Internus and Inferior Gemellus, which all act as lateral rotaters of the thigh. 
The lesser trochanter is a cone-shaped extension of the lowest part of the femur neck. The two trochanters are joined by the [[intertrochanteric crest]] on the back side and by the [[intertrochanteric line]] on the front.<ref name=Bojsen/>

A slight ridge is sometimes seen commencing about the middle of the intertrochanteric crest, and reaching vertically downward for about 5 cm. along the back part of the body: it is called the [[linea quadrata]] (or quadrate line).

About the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds on the intertrochanteric crest is the [[quadrate tubercle]] located. The size of the tubercle varies and it is not alway located on the intertrochanteric crest and that also adjecent areas can be part of the quadrate tubercel, such as the posterior surfare of the greater trochanter or the neck of the femur. In a small anatomical study is was shown that the [[Epiphyseal plate|epiphysial line]] passes directly trough the quadrate tubercle. <ref name="pmid17104699">{{cite journal |author=Sunderland S |title=The Quadrate Tubercle of the Femur |journal=J.
