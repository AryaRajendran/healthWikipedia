'''Photosensitivity''' is the amount to which an object reacts upon receiving [[photon]]s, especially [[visible light]]. 

==Interpretation in medicine==
=== Human medicine ===
{{main|Photosensitivity in humans}}
{{see also|phototoxicity}}
Sensitivity of the [[skin]] to a light source can take various forms. People with particular skin types are more sensitive to [[sunburn]]. Particular medications make the skin more sensitive to sunlight; these include most of the [[tetracycline antibiotics]], heart drugs [[amiodarone]], and [[sulfonamides]]. Particular conditions lead to increased light sensitivity. Patients with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] experience skin symptoms after sunlight exposure; some types of [[porphyria]] are aggravated by sunlight. A rare hereditary condition [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] (a defect in DNA repair) is thought to increase the risk of UV-light-exposure-related cancer by increasing photosensitivity.

=== Veterinary medicine ===
{{main|Photosensitivity in animals}}
Photosensitivity is a well-known condition in different animals species including [[sheep]], [[bovine]], [[horse]]. Its economic importance derives from the numerous animals involved in the same time.

Photosensitizations are classified as primary if an ingested plant contains a photosensitive substance, like [[hypericin]] in [[St John's wort]] poisoning in sheep, or [[buckwheat|buckwheat plants]] (green or dried) in horses.<ref>[http://www.understanding-horse-nutrition.com/buckwheat.html Understanding Horse Nutrition.Com on buckwheat]</ref>

In '''hepatogenous photosensitization''', the photosensitzing substance is [[phylloerythrin]], a normal end-product of [[chlorophyll]] metabolism.&nbsp;<ref>{{cite book | coauthors = D.C. Blood, J.A.

==Electronics==
Certain electronic devices, such as [[photodiodes]] and [[charge-coupled device]]s, are designed to be sensitive to light. They are constructed to take advantage of the  [[photoelectric effect]], the emission of electrons from matter upon the absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. When light (one form of electromagnetic radiation) impinges on the active surface of such a device, [[electrical current]] flowing through or [[electrical charge]] stored in the device will increase or decrease in proportion to the intensity and [[wavelength]] of the light, although there is an upper limit to the amount of electrons released vs the increased intensity of the light, this comes out of quantum mechanics. This trait allows the device to perform regulating and sensing functions of many kinds. For example, a [[photoresistor]] [[electrical network|circuit]] may sense ambient light to turn on a street lamp at dusk. [[Digital cameras]] use an array of photodiodes whose extreme sensitivity to light allows them to convert incoming photons into varying electrical charges with great accuracy. The varying charges are then encoded in a [[binary file]] which can be stored and later viewed on a computer screen or other medium.

==Interpretation in chemistry==
Chemicals that are photosensitive may undergo [[chemical reaction]]s when exposed to light. These chemicals, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] and many prescription drugs, are stored in tinted or opaque containers until they are needed to prevent photodegradation. Devices that are photosensitive include the human [[retina]] and [[photographic film]]; their photosensitive materials undergo a chemical reaction when struck by light.  

Typical substances that are photosensitive are [[alkali]] [[salts]] and [[silver halide]]s.
