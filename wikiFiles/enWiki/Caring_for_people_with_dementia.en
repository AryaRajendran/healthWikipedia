As [[demographics|populations age]], '''caring for people with dementia''' has become more common. [[Elderly care|Elderly]]  [[Caregiver|caregiving]]  may consist of formal care and informal care. Formal care involves the services of community and medical partners, while informal care involves the support of family members and friends, oftentimes from spouses and adult children. In most mild to medium cases of [[dementia]] the [[primary care]]giver is a family member, usually a spouse or adult child.  Over time more and more [[professional]] care in the form of [[nursing]] and other supportive care may be required, whether [[home care|at home]] or in a [[long term care]] facility.

==Family carers==
The role of family [[carers|caregiver]]s has also become more prominent, as care in the familiar surroundings of home may delay onset of some symptoms and postpone or eliminate the need for more professional and costly levels of care. Home-based care may entail tremendous economic, emotional costs as well.  Family caregivers often give up time from work and forego pay in order to spend an average of 47&nbsp;hours per week with an affected loved one, who frequently cannot be left alone.  In a survey of patients with [[long term care insurance]], the direct and indirect costs of caring for an [[Alzheimer's disease]] patient averaged $77,500 per year in the [[United States]].<ref name="metlife">{{cite journal | title=The MetLife Study of Alzheimer’s Disease: The Caregiving Experience | author=MetLife Mature Market Institute | month=August | year=2006 | url=http://www.metlife.com/WPSAssets/14050063731156260663V1FAlzheimerCaregivingExperience.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-12}}</ref>  Caregivers are themselves subject to increased incidence of depression, anxiety, and, in some cases, physical health issues.<ref name="pmid8557205">

===Stressors===
Schulz et al. concluded in a [[United States|US]] study that "the transition to institutional care is particularly difficult for spouses, almost half of whom visit the patient daily and continue to provide help with physical care during their visits. Clinical interventions that better prepare the caregiver for a placement transition and treat their depression and anxiety following placement may be of great benefit to these individuals."<ref name="pmid15328328">

<!-- This is a rather confusingly described study - hiding for now until it is better written
  A [[Finland|Finnish]] study by Leinonen et al. (2001) found that "among the general psychogeriatric patient groups, the caregiving spouses of demented patients with noncognitive psychiatric symptoms are the most burdened group. However, spouses of depressive patients are as much burdened as those of demented patients with mild to moderate memory impairment."<ref name="pmid11333426">
