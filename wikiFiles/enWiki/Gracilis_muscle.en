The '''gracilis''' (Latin for "slender") is the most superficial muscle on the [[Lateral and medial|medial]] side of the [[thigh]]. It is thin and flattened, broad above, narrow and tapering below.

==Origin and insertion==
It arises by a thin [[aponeurosis]] from the anterior margins of the lower half of the [[pubic symphysis|symphysis pubis]] and the upper half of the [[pubic arch]].

The muscle's fibers run vertically downward, ending in a rounded tendon. This tendon passes behind the [[medial condyle of femur|medial condyle]] of the [[femur]], curves around the [[medial condyle of tibia|medial condyle of the tibia]] where it becomes flattened, and inserts into the upper part of the medial surface of the body of the [[tibia]], below the condyle. For this reason, the muscle is a lower limb [[adductor]]. At its insertion the tendon is situated immediately above that of the [[semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] muscle, and its upper edge is overlapped by the tendon of the [[sartorius muscle]], which it joins to form the [[pes anserinus]]. The pes anserinus is separated from the [[medial collateral ligament]] of the [[knee|knee-joint]] by a [[Bursa (anatomy)|bursa]].

A few of the fibers of the lower part of the tendon are prolonged into the deep fascia of the leg.

==Action==
The muscle adducts and [[hip flexors|flexes]] the hip as above, and also aids in flexion of the knee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/hamstrings_times_two |title=Hamstrings Times Two, muscles synergistic to the hamstrings |publisher=T-nation.com |date=2006-03-03 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}</ref>

==Relations==
By its inner or superficial surface gracilis is in relation with the [[fascia lata]], and below with the [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]] and internal [[saphenous nerve]]; the internal [[saphenous vein]] crosses it lying superficially to the fascia lata.

By its outer or deep surface with the [[adductor longus]], [[adductor brevis|brevis]], and [[adductor magnus|magnus]], and the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, from which it is separated by a synovial bursa common to the tendons of the gracilis and [[semitendinosus]].<ref>Wilson, Erasmus (1851) [http://books.google.com/books?id=t2M1AV1aYWQC&pg=PA261 ''The anatomist's vade mecum: a system of human anatomy''], p 261</ref>

==Microsurgery==
The gracilis muscle is commonly used as a [[Free flap|flap]] in [[microsurgery]]. According to the classification of Mathes and Nahai, it presents a type II blood supply, allowing it to be transferred on its artery derived from the medial circumflex femoral artery. This artery enters the muscle about 10&nbsp;cm from the pubic symphysis. At this point (or 1&nbsp;cm proximal) the nerve also enters.

Gracilis muscle is widely used in reconstructive surgery, either as a pedicled flap or as a free microsurgical flap. Both pedicled and free flaps can be muscular or musculocutaneos (the so- called "composite flaps"). As a pedicled flap, gracilis muscle can be used in perineal and vaginal reconstruction, after oncological surgery, in the treatment of recurrent anovaginal and rectovaginal fistulas as well in the coverage of the neurovascular bundle after vascular surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pelviperineology.org/coloproctology/gracilis_muscle_clinical_role.html |title=Gracilis muscles clinical role. Computed Tomography (CT) angiography |publisher=Pelviperineology.org |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}</ref>

As a functioning pedicled flap, the gracilis muscle can be transferred for the treatment of anal incontinence. This technique called graciloplasty was described in the 1950s by Pickrell and was revolutionized in the late 1980s by the introduction of chronic muscle electro-stimulation. The gracilis microsurgical free flap is commonly used in the reconstruction of upper and lower limbs, in breast reconstruction and – as a free functioning flap – to restore forearm function or in dynamic reconstruction of facial paralysis.[http://www.pelviperineology.org/coloproctology/gracilis_muscle_clinical_role.html Gracilis Muscles Clinical Role]

===Transplantation sites===
The muscle may be split to reduce bulk for [[facial reanimation]], as well as to repair hand muscles. It can be used to fashion an [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external anal sphincter]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Keith|title=Essential Clinical Anatomy, 3rd ed|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2007}}{{pn|date=October 2011}}</ref>
