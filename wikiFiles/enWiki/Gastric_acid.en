'''Gastric acid''' is a digestive fluid, formed in the [[stomach]].  It has a [[pH]] of 1.5 to 3.5 and is composed of [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) (around 0.5%, or 5000 [[parts per million]]) as high as 0.1 M,<ref>http://www.acidbase.org/index.php?show=sb&action=explode&id=31&sid=42</ref> and large quantities of [[potassium chloride]] (KCl) and [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl).  The acid plays a key role in digestion of [[proteins]], by activating [[digestive enzymes]], and making ingested proteins unravel so that digestive enzymes break down the long chains of [[amino acids]].

Gastric acid is produced by cells lining the stomach, which are coupled to systems to increase acid production when needed.  Other cells in the stomach produce [[bicarbonate]], a base, to [[Buffering agent|buffer]] the fluid, ensuring that it does not become too acidic.  These cells also produce [[mucus]], which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach. Cells in the beginning of the small intestine, or [[duodenum]], further produce large amounts of bicarbonate to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract. 

The presence of gastric acid in the stomach and its function in digestion was first characterized by [[United States Army]] surgeon [[William Beaumont]] around 1830. Beaumont was able to study the stomach action of fur trapper [[Alexis St. Martin]] due to the latter's gastric [[fistula]].

==Physiology==

Gastric acid is produced by [[parietal cell]]s (also called oxyntic cells) in the stomach. Its secretion is a complex and relatively energetically expensive process. Parietal cells contain an extensive secretory network (called [[Canaliculus (parietal cell)|canaliculi]]) from which the gastric acid is secreted into the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the stomach.  These cells are part of [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[fundic glands]] in the [[gastric mucosa]]. The [[pH]] of gastric acid is 1.35 to 3.5 <ref>{{cite book |author=Marieb EN, Hoehn K |title=Human anatomy & physiology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-8053-9591-1}}</ref> in the human stomach lumen, the acidity being maintained by the [[proton pump]] [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase]]. The parietal cell releases [[bicarbonate]] into the blood stream in the process, which causes a temporary rise of pH in the blood, known as [[alkaline tide]].

The resulting highly acidic environment in the stomach lumen causes [[protein]]s from food to lose their characteristic folded structure (or [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]]). This exposes the protein's [[peptide bond]]s. The [[chief cell]]s of the stomach secrete enzymes for protein breakdown (inactive [[pepsinogen]] and [[rennin]]). [[Hydrochloric acid]] activates pepsinogen into the [[enzyme]] [[pepsin]], which then helps digestion by breaking the bonds linking [[amino acid]]s, a process known as [[proteolysis]]. In addition, many [[microorganism]]s have their growth inhibited by such an acidic environment, which is helpful to prevent [[infection]].

===Secretion===
Gastric acid secretion happens in several steps. Chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted separately from the cytoplasm of parietal cells and mixed in the canaliculi. Gastric acid is then secreted into the lumen of the oxyntic gland and gradually reaches the main stomach lumen.  The exact manner in which the secreted acid reaches the stomach lumen is controversial, as acid must first cross the relatively pH neutral gastric mucus layer.

Chloride and sodium ions are secreted actively from the [[cytoplasm]] of the parietal cell into the lumen of the canaliculus. This creates a [[Transmembrane potential difference|negative potential]] of -40 m[[volt|V]] to -70 mV across the parietal cell membrane that causes potassium ions and a small number of sodium ions to [[diffusion|diffuse]] from the cytoplasm into the parietal cell canaliculi.

The enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]] catalyses the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to form [[carbonic acid]]. This acid immediately dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate ions. The hydrogen ions leave the cell through [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase]] [[antiporter]] pumps.

At the same time sodium ions are actively reabsorbed. This means that the majority of secreted K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions return to the cytoplasm. In the canaliculus, secreted hydrogen and chloride ions mix and are secreted into the lumen of the oxyntic gland.

The highest concentration that gastric acid reaches in the stomach is 160 [[Molarity|mM]] in the canaliculi. This is about 3 million times that of [[artery|arterial]] [[blood]], but almost exactly [[Isotonicity|isotonic]] with other bodily fluids. The lowest pH of the secreted acid is 0.8,<ref>{{Cite book| edition = 11| publisher = Elsevier Saunders| isbn = 0-7216-0240-1| page = 797| last = Guyton| first = Arthur C.| coauthors = John E. Hall| title = Textbook of Medical Physiology| location = Philadelphia| year = 2006}}</ref> but the acid is diluted in the stomach lumen to a pH between 1 and 3.

There are three phases in the secretion of gastric acid:

# The basal phase: A small amount of acid is always being secreted into the stomach. The three following phases increase the secretion rate in order to digest a meal. 
# The cephalic phase: Thirty percent of the total gastric acid secretions to be produced is stimulated by anticipation of eating and the smell or taste of food. This signalling occurs from higher centres in the brain through the [[Vagus Nerve]]. It activates [[parietal cells]] to release acid and [[ECL cells]] to release [[histamine]]. The Vagus nerve also releases [[Gastrin Releasing Peptide]] onto [[G cells]]. Finally, it also inhibits [[somatostatin]] release from [[D cells]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Lecture, "Function of the Stomach and Small Intestine"  Deakin University School of Medicine - October 15, 2012</ref>
# The gastric phase: About fifty percent of the total acid for a meal is secreted in this phase. Acid secretion is stimulated by distension of the stomach and by [[amino acids]] present in the food.
# The intestinal phase: The remaining 10% of acid is secreted when [[chyme]] enters the small intestine, and is stimulated by small intestine distension and by [[amino acids]]. The duodenal cells release [[entero-oxyntin]] which acts on parietal cells without affecting gastrin.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
There is also a small continuous basal secretion of gastric acid between meals of usually less than 10 mEq/hour.<ref name=agabegi2nd192>Page 192 in: {{cite book |author=Elizabeth D Agabegi; Agabegi, Steven S. |title=Step-Up to Medicine (Step-Up Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7153-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Regulation of secretion===
[[Image:Determinants of Gastric Acid Secretion.svg|thumb|760px|center|Diagram depicting the major determinants of gastric acid secretion, with inclusion of drug targets for peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).]]{{-}}
Gastric acid production is regulated by both the [[autonomic nervous system]] and several [[hormone]]s. The [[parasympathetic nervous system]], via the [[vagus nerve]], and the hormone [[gastrin]] stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone [[histamine]] from [[enterochromaffine-like cell]]s (ECL). [[Vasoactive intestinal peptide]], [[cholecystokinin]], and [[secretin]] all inhibit production.

The production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and [[negative feedback]] mechanisms. Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, [[G cell]]s, [[D cell (biology)|D cell]]s and enterochromaffine-like cells. Besides this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly.

Nerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory [[neurotransmitter]]s: [[acetylcholine]] and [[gastrin-releasing peptide]]. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells. Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine.

The release of histamine is the most important positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach. Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by [[somatostatin]].

===Neutralization===
In the [[duodenum]], gastric acid is [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] by [[sodium bicarbonate]]. This also blocks gastric enzymes that have their optima in the acid range of [[pH]]. The secretion of sodium bicarbonate from the [[pancreas]] is stimulated by [[secretin]]. This [[polypeptide]] hormone gets activated and secreted from so-called [[S cell]]s in the mucosa of the duodenum and [[jejunum]] when the pH in duodenum falls below 4.5 to 5.0. The neutralization is described by the equation:

:: HCl + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> → NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>

The [[carbonic acid]] rapidly equilibrates with [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]] through catalysis by carbonic anhydrase enzymes bound to the gut epithelial lining,<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2506730</ref> leading to a net release of carbon dioxide gas within the lumen associated with neutralisation. In the absorptive upper intestine, such as the duodenum, both the dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid will tend to equilibrate with the blood, leading to most of the gas produced on neutralisation being exhaled through the lungs.

== Role in disease ==
In [[hypochlorhydria]] and [[achlorhydria]], there is low or no gastric acid in the stomach, potentially leading to problems as the [[disinfectant]] properties of the gastric lumen are decreased.  In such conditions, there is greater risk of infections of the [[digestive tract]] (such as infection with ''[[Vibrio]]'' or ''[[Helicobacter]]'' bacteria).

In [[Zollinger–Ellison syndrome]] and [[hypercalcemia]], there are increased [[gastrin]] levels, leading to excess gastric acid production, which can cause [[gastric ulcer]]s.

In diseases featuring excess vomiting, patients develop [[chlorine|hypochloremic]] [[metabolic alkalosis]] (decreased blood acidity by [[hydrogen|H]]<sup>+</sup> and [[chlorine]] depletion).

== Pharmacology ==

The proton pump enzyme is the target of [[proton pump inhibitor]]s, used to increase gastric pH (and hence decrease stomach acidity) in diseases that feature excess acid. [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> antagonists]]  indirectly decrease gastric acid production. [[Antacid]]s neutralize existing acid.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
The role of gastric acid in [[digestion]] was established in the 1820s and 1830s by [[William Beaumont]] on [[Alexis St. Martin]], who, as a result of an accident, had a [[fistula]] (hole) in his stomach, which allowed Beaumont to observe the process of digestion and to extract gastric acid, verifying that acid played a crucial role in digestion.<ref>{{cite book | last =  Harré | first =  R. | title = Great Scientific Experiments | publisher = Phaidon (Oxford) | year = 1981 | pages = 39&ndash;47 | isbn = 0-7148-2096-2 | authorlink = Rom Harré }}</ref>
