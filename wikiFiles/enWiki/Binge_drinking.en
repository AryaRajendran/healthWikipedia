'''Binge drinking''' or '''heavy episodic drinking''' is the modern epithet for drinking alcoholic [[Drinks|beverages]] with the primary intention of becoming intoxicated by heavy consumption of alcohol over a short period of time.<ref name="Renaud-2001"/> It is a kind of purposeful drinking style that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with [[social drinking]] since it is often done in groups. The degree of intoxication, however, varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice. A binge on alcohol can occur over hours or last up to several days. Due to the [[long-term effects of alcohol]] misuse, binge drinking is considered to be a major [[public health issue]].<ref name="Mathurin-2009"/>

Binge drinking is associated with a profound social harm, economic costs as well as increased disease burden. Binge drinking is more common in males, during adolescence and young adulthood. Most binge drinkers are not familiar with the risks associated with binge drinking. Heavy regular binge drinking is associated with adverse effects on [[neurologic]], [[cardiac]], [[gastrointestinal]], [[hematologic]], [[immune]], [[musculoskeletal]] organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced [[psychiatric disorder]]s.<ref name="Standridge-2004">{{Cite journal | last1 = Standridge | first1 = JB. | last2 = Zylstra | first2 = RG. | last3 = Adams | first3 = SM. | title = Alcohol consumption: an overview of benefits and risks. | journal = South Med J | volume = 97 | issue = 7 | pages = 664–72 | month = Jul | year = 2004 | doi =  10.1097/00007611-200407000-00012| pmid = 15301124 }}</ref><ref name="Kuntsche-2004">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kuntsche | first1 = E. | last2 = Rehm | first2 = J. | last3 = Gmel | first3 = G. | title = Characteristics of binge drinkers in Europe. | journal = Soc Sci Med | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–27 | month = Jul | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.10.009 | pmid = 15087148 }}</ref> A US-based review of the literature found that up to one third of adolescents binge drink, with six percent reaching the threshold of having an alcohol-related [[substance use disorder]].<ref name="Clark-2002">{{Cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = DB. | last2 = Bukstein | first2 = O. | last3 = Cornelius | first3 = J. | title = Alcohol use disorders in adolescents: epidemiology, diagnosis, psychosocial interventions, and pharmacological treatment. | journal = Paediatr Drugs | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 493–502 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12126453 }}</ref> Approximately one in 25 women binge drink during pregnancy, which can lead to [[fetal alcohol syndrome]] and [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorders]].<ref name="Floyd-2005"/> Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents, violent behavior as well as suicide. The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including [[alcoholism]]. A large number of adolescents who binge drink also consume other psychotropic substances.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

Binge drinking has the propensity to result in brain damage faster as well as more severely than chronic 'non stop' drinking (alcoholism), due to the [[neurotoxic]] effects of the repeated rebound withdrawal effects. The tolerance that occurs during chronic ('non-stop') drinking delays alcohol-related brain damage compared to binge drinking which induces immediate and repeated insults to the brain. The neurotoxic insults to the brain are due to very large amounts of [[glutamate]] being released on a repeated basis which over-stimulates the brain after each binge finishes, resulting in [[excitotoxicity]].<ref name="pmid19155229"/> The developing adolescent brain is thought to be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 4 or 5 drinks once or twice per month.<ref name="tdmcibd"/>

In the [[United Kingdom]], binge drinking is defined as drinking more than twice the daily limit, that is, drinking eight units or more for men or six units or more for women (roughly equivalent to five or four American standard drinks, respectively).<ref name="Stephens-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Stephens | first1 = DN. | last2 = Duka | first2 = T. | title = Review.

Other, less common definitions are based on [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC). For example, the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) recently redefined the term "binge drinking" as any time one reaches a peak BAC of 0.08% or higher as opposed to some (arguably) arbitrary number of drinks in an evening.<ref name="cdc.gov">"Quick Stats: Binge Drinking." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. April 2008.[http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/quickstats/binge_drinking.htm].</ref> Whatever the numerical definition used, heavy drinking or rapid consumption over a short period of time with the intention of becoming intoxicated is often implied when the term is used colloquially, since one can remain relatively sober if the four or five drinks are spread out widely over the course of a long evening on a reasonably full stomach.<ref name=BMA>[http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/Hubhotpbingedrinking Binge drinking]</ref>

In the [[United States]], sometimes the term "extreme drinking" or "industrial-strength bingeing" is used to describe a more severe form of (single-evening) binge drinking; it is often defined as ten or more standard American drinks on a single occasion (sometimes as eight drinks for women).<ref>Hitti, M. (2006, 5 24). 'Extreme Drinking,' Alcohol Abuse Common Among College Students.

Males who drink more than 35 units of alcohol per week report being physically hurt as a result of alcohol, and 15 percent report physically hurting others as a result of their drinking. Almost 16 percent of binge drinkers report being taken advantage of sexually, and 8 percent report taking advantage of another person sexually as a result of alcohol within a 1 year period. Heavy drinkers cause approximately 183,000 rapes and sexual assaults, 197,000 robberies, 661,000 aggravated assaults, and 1.7 million simple assaults each year.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Science of Drinking: How Alcohol Affects Your Body and Mind|last= Dasgupta|first=Amitava|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|year=2011}}</ref> Binge drinking has been associated with high odds of divorce, spousal abuse, and poor job performance.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Prospective Study of Risk Drinking: At risk for what?|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|last=Dawson|first= Deborah|date= May 1, 2008}}</ref> Binge drinking can cause adverse effects on the body including effects on blood [[homeostasis]] and its [[circadian]] variation, [[cardiac rhythm]], [[ischaemic heart disease]], [[blood pressure]], [[white blood cell]] activity, female [[reproductive hormone]] levels as well as adverse effects on the fetus.

Other risk factors which influence the development of [[alcohol abuse]] or [[alcoholism]] include social and genetic factors. Several researchers have found that starting drinking before the age of 15 is associated with a fourfold increased risk for developing alcoholism compared to people who delay drinking until age 20 or later. It has been estimated by some that if the age at which people started drinking could be delayed to age 20, there would be a 50 percent reduction in the number of cases of alcohol use disorder.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/> However, it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship, or a function of confounding familial (and other) factors associated with both age at first drink and propensity for alcoholism.<ref name="Schwandt-2010">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.alcohol.2009.09.034 | last = Schwandt | first = M.L. |coauthors= S.G.

Being associated with certain groups, especially in the [[college]] setting influences young adults and their decision to engage in binge drinking. Students exposed or involved in the [[Greek system]] are more prone to heavy drinking as well as college athletes, where alcohol prevention efforts are practiced but not always holding the desired result of reducing the number of binge drinkers attending colleges and universities.<ref>Marczinski, 2009, pg.37</ref> In addition to identifying these groups, it is understood that student drinkers choose to engage in this behavior as a means of fitting in with what is considered a [[social norm]]. Students are confronted with social pressures involving binge drinking and if ignored, risk being isolated from others.<ref name="Tan, 2005">Tan, 2005</ref> This reality examines the psychological workings associated with continued binge drinking at colleges and universities across the United States. Along with drinking being portrayed as an individual’s choice, drinking in the college setting can also be portrayed as a collaborative choice, involving many students. Annual rankings of America’s top [[party schools]] are an unsuspecting factor that contributes to continued binge drinking among campuses. Students are proud of their university’s drinking reputation, fueled by competition to outdrink rival schools. A sense of identity is brought to each university holding this label and gives further insight as to why continued alcohol consumption thrives around hundreds of universities.<ref name="Tan, 2005"/> 

The main cause of death among adolescents as a result of binge drinking is road traffic accidents; a third of all fatal road traffic accidents among 15- to 20-year-olds are associated with drinking alcohol. Cyclists and pedestrians are likely to have less spatial awareness and concentration while travelling after binge drinking and additionally adolescents who binge drink more commonly drive drunk or are the passenger of a drunk driver. It has been found that 50 percent of all head injuries in adolescents in the USA are associated with alcohol consumption. Violence and suicide combine to become the third-most-common cause of death associated with binge drinking among adolescents. The suicide risk in adolescents is more than 4 times higher among binge drinkers than non-binge drinking adolescents.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

Earlier sexual activity, increased changing of sexual partners, higher rate of unwanted (teenage) pregnancy, higher rate of sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and alcohol-related damage to the fetus during pregnancy is associated with binge drinking. Female binge drinkers are three times more likely to be victims of sexual assault; 50 percent of adolescent girls reporting sexual assault were under the influence of alcohol or another psychotropic substance at the time.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

Adolescents who regularly participated in binge drinking for several years show a smaller [[hippocampus]] brain region, particularly those who began drinking in early adolescence. Heavy binge drinking is associated with neurocognitive deficits of frontal lobe processing and impaired working memory as well as delayed auditory and verbal memory deficits. Animal studies suggest that the [[neurodegenerative]] effects of alcohol abuse during adolescence can be permanent.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/> Research in humans, which utilised sophisticated brain scanning technology suggests that in adolescent teenagers, drinking more than 4 or 5 drinks once or twice a month results in subtle damage to the teenagers developing brain tissue, particularly the white matter.<ref name="tdmcibd">{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122765890 |title=Teen Drinking May Cause Irreversible Brain Damage |author=Michelle Trudeau |date=January 25, 2010 |publisher=National Public Radio |location=USA }}</ref>  However, this research is primarily cross-sectional and done with fairly small sample sizes, making causality less certain.

===Central nervous system===
{{See also|Alcohol withdrawal syndrome#Kindling|Kindling (substance withdrawal)}}
Heavy binge drinkers tend to have delayed auditory and verbal memory and deficits in executive planning function and episodic memory, which are similar to deficits seen in [[Korsakoff's syndrome]]. Impairments in spatial working memory and pattern recognition tasks also have been found in heavy binge drinkers. Impulse control is also impaired in binge drinkers, especially female binge drinkers. Additionally, immediate and delayed recall of verbal and visual information is impaired; conversely, semantic organizational ability is better in binge drinkers compared to non-binge drinkers. Studies in adolescents have shown that regular binge drinking may cause long-lasting cognitive impairments, though the threshold needed to produce significant effects remains unclear. Cognitive impairment in adults is also unclear, as one study found no association between binge drinking and cognitive impairment.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/> Binge drinking is believed to increase impulsivity due to altered functioning of [[prefrontal]]–subcortical and [[orbitofrontal]] circuits. Binge drinking and alcoholics who have undergone multiple detoxifications is associated with an inability to interpret [[facial expression]]s properly; this is believed to be due to kindling of the [[amygdala]] with resultant distortion of neurotransmission. Adolescents, females and young adults are most sensitive to the neuropsychological effects of binge drinking. Adolescence, particularly early adolescence, is a developmental stage which is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic and neurocognitive adverse effects of binge drinking due to it being a time of significant brain development.<ref name="Stephens-2008"/>

Binge drinking regimes are associated with causing an imbalance between [[inhibitory]] and [[excitatory]] [[amino acids]] and changes in [[monoamines]] release in the central nervous system, which increases neurotoxicity and may result in cogitive impairments, psychological problems and in long-term heavy binge drinkers may cause irreversible brain damage in both adolescents and adults.<ref name="Ward-"/><ref name="Crews-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Crews | first1 = FT. | last2 = Boettiger | first2 = CA. | title = Impulsivity, frontal lobes and risk for addiction | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–47 | month = Sep | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2009.04.018 | pmid = 19410598 | pmc = 2730661 }}</ref>

While several rat studies indicate that alcohol is more toxic during adolescence than adulthood, some researchers believe that it remains unclear whether this is also the case in humans. Though heavy binge drinking adolescent humans show impaired brain activity during memory tests and underdeveloped brain structures compared to adolescents who did not binge drink, they argue that these findings are similar to adult alcoholics who did not abuse alcohol during adolescence.<ref name="Choose Responsibility">http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/alcohol_adolescents_and_adults_c/ Alcohol, Adolescents, and Adults--Choose Responsibility, Accessed 06-30-2010</ref> Extrapolation from animal studies to humans is notoriously difficult,<ref>http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/21st_Century/perel/perel-commentary.php Bracken MB.

===Pregnancy===
Binge drinking is a more important factor rather than average alcohol intake, with regard to the severity of alcohol induced damage to the fetus.

The recovery rate is high, with most fatalities due to [[Bacteremia|septic blood poisoning]]. A person is more likely to urinate while passed out before the bladder ruptures, as alcohol relaxes the muscles that normally control their bladder.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2213866,00.html "If you thought a hangover was bad ...]: A new report says binge drinking has increased to such an extent that cases of 'exploding bladders' are on the rise in the UK." report of article in the [[British Medical Journal]] (BMJ) by Lucy Atkins in [[The Guardian]] November 20, 2007</ref>

===Acute hazards===
The most common risk of consuming massive quantities of alcohol in a short period of time is a dangerously high blood alcohol level. The result is called [[alcohol poisoning]] (overdose), which can be fatal. Choking on (or inhalation of) vomit is also a potential cause of death, as are injuries from falls, fights, motor vehicle and bicycle accidents. Another common risk is a [[blackout (alcohol-related amnesia)]], which can cause shame, guilt, embarrassment, harm to personal relationships, injury or death, and is also associated with the loss of personal belongings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Donal|title=The Alcohol Blackout - Walking, Talking, Unconscious, and Lethal|year=2004|publisher=Mnemosyne Press|isbn=978-0974794303|pages=221}}</ref>

==Cause==
Culture as well as peer pressure play an important role in driving binge drinking.<ref name="Standridge-2004"/> In adults, binge drinking is more common in people who have never been married, score a grade B or less in education, and is also higher in adults who are not religious.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/> 

The reasons for binge drinking by children and adolescents in Europe include:<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

*It's really fun (76%)
*I feel more sociable (65%)
*I feel happy/relaxed (51% each)
*I forget my problems (41%)

Other causes include feeling more grown-up and fitting in with peers and to increase the chance of sexual encounters. Some also drink to alleviate stress or anxiety.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

Risk factors for binge drinking among adolescents include: low socioeconomic status, large amount of disposable (pocket) money, sensation/novelty seeking, low self-control, delinquency and having delinquent friends. Other risk factors include: using alcohol as a coping strategy for emotional problems (more common in adolescent girls), excessive drinking among peers, poor relationship with parents, alcohol abuse by parents.  Genetic conditions combined with a background of negative environmental factors increase the harmful use of alcohol.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/> Additionally the risk-taking behavior associated with adolescence promotes binge drinking.<ref name="Bowden-2001"/>

==Pathophysiology==
Binge drinking has the propensity to result in brain damage faster as well as more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism), due to the neurotoxic effects of the repeated rebound withdrawal effects. During the repeated alcohol free stages associated with binge drinking, a larger amount of glutamate is released than occurs during withdrawal from chronic alcohol abuse; additionally this extreme release of glutamate happens on a repeated basis in binge drinkers leading to [[excitotoxicity]]. The tolerance that occurs during chronic ('non-stop') drinking delays alcohol-related brain damage compared to binge drinking which induced immediate and repeated insults to the brain.<ref name="pmid19155229">{{cite journal |author=Ward RJ, Lallemand F, de Witte P |title=Biochemical and neurotransmitter changes implicated in alcohol-induced brain damage in chronic or 'binge drinking' alcohol abuse |journal=Alcohol Alcohol. |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=128–35 |year=2009 |pmid=19155229 |doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn100 |url=}}</ref>

Impairments in impulse control in binge drinkers, which is more prominent in female binge drinkers, is due to dysfunction of the [[frontal lobe]]. The findings in humans have been largely concordant with animal studies. Such animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in [[corticolimbic]] brain regions areas which are involved in learning and spatial memory, such as the [[olfactory bulb]], [[piriform cortex]], [[perirhinal cortex]], [[entorhinal cortex]], and the hippocampal [[dentate gyrus]]. A study in rats found that a heavy 2 day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the [[entorhinal cortex]] with resultant learning deficits. While brain damage from binge drinking is known to occur as a result of binge drinking patterns, it is unclear how long drinking sessions last and how regular binge drinking is done to cause brain damage in humans. One study found that humans who drank at least 100 drinks (male) or 80 drinks (female) per month (concentrated to 21 occasions or less per month) throughout a 3 year period had impaired decision making skills compared to non-binge drinkers. Repeated acute withdrawal from alcohol which occurs in heavy binge drinkers has been shown in several studies to be associated with cognitive deficits as a result of neural [[Kindling (substance withdrawal)|kindling]]; neural kindling due to repeated withdrawals is believed to be the mechanism of cognitive damage in both binge drinkers and alcoholics. Neuronal kindling also leads to each subsequent acute withdrawal episode being more severe than previous [[withdrawal]] episodes.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/>

[[Blackout (alcohol-related amnesia)|Blackouts]], a form of amnesia which occurs in binge drinkers may be due to suppressed [[hippocampus]] function with rebound NMDA (glutamate) activity combined with excessive glucocorticoid release induced by the stress of repeated intoxication followed by acute withdrawal/abstinence is the proposed mechanism of neural kindling leading to neurotoxicity of structures involved in learning and memory within the brain of binge drinkers.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/> Frontal lobe processing may become impaired as a result of binge drinking with resultant neurocognitive deficits and impaired working memory.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/>

Alcohol suppresses brain function during intoxication; but upon withdrawal [[rebound effects]] occur in the glutamate/NMDA system and with excess glutamate activity [[glucocorticoid]] release; due to the repeated intoxication, followed by acute withdrawal a neurotoxic effect develops which damages the central nervous system, leading to persisting impairments in verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities as well as impairment of spatial orientation. Due to developmental processes occurring during adolescence including [[myelinization]] and restructuring of the synapses, adolescents are thought to be more vulnerable to the [[neurotoxic]] effects of alcohol.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

Age and genetic factors influence the risk of developing alcohol-related [[neurotoxicity]].<ref name="Bowden-2001">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bowden | first1 = SC. | last2 = Crews | first2 = FT. | last3 = Bates | first3 = ME. | last4 = Fals-Stewart | first4 = W. | last5 = Ambrose | first5 = ML. | title = Neurotoxicity and neurocognitive impairments with alcohol and drug-use disorders: potential roles in addiction and recovery | journal = Alcohol Clin Exp Res | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 317–21 | month = Feb | year = 2001 | pmid = 11236849 | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2001.tb02215.x }}</ref> Adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), is a critical and delicate developmental stage for specialised [[neuronal]] and [[Synapse|synaptic]] systems mature.

According to one review of the literature, if the developmental stage of adolescence is similar to the developmental stage of the fetus with regard to sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, and if long-lasting or permanent damage to the brain occurs similar to what animal studies suggest, then this represents a major public health issue due to the high levels of alcohol use by adolescents.<ref name="Ehlers-2010">{{Cite journal | last1 = Ehlers | first1 = CL. | last2 = Criado | first2 = JR. | title = Adolescent ethanol exposure: does it produce long-lasting electrophysiological effects? | journal = Alcohol | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–37 | month = Feb | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.alcohol.2009.09.033 | pmid = 20113872 | pmc = 2818286 }}</ref> Indeed, alcohol can affect the remodeling and functional changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions that occurs during adolescence (''see [[Long-term_effects_of_alcohol#Adolescent_brain_development|this related article]]'').

==Diagnosis==
For the purpose of identifying an alcohol use disorder when assessing binge drinking, using a time frame of the past 6 months eliminates false negatives. For example it has been found that using a narrow 2 week window for assessment of binge drinking habits leads to 30 percent of heavy regular binge drinkers wrongly being classed as not having an alcohol use disorder.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/>  However, the same researchers also note that recall bias is somewhat enhanced when longer timeframes are used.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/>

===Reduction===
Research now shows ways to reduce the intentions of people to binge drink or engage in dangerous driving. A key article by Martin, Lee, Weeks and Kaya (2013) suggests that understanding consumer personality and how people view others is important. People were shown ads talking of the harmful effects of binge drinking. People who valued close friends as a sense of who they are were less likely to want to binge drink after seeing an ad featuring them and a close friend. People who were loners or who did not see close friends important to their sense of who they were reacted better to ads featuring an individual. A similar pattern was shown for ads showing a person driving at dangerous speeds. This suggests ads showing potential harm to citizens from binge drinking or dangerous driving are less effective than ads highlighting a person’s close friends. <ref>Martin, Brett A.

==Treatment==
Due to the risks especially in adolescents, of cognitive impairments and possible irreversible brain damage associated with binge drinking, urgent action has been recommended.<ref name="Ward-"/> There is some evidence that interventions by employers such as, health and life-style checks, psychosocial skills training and peer referral, can reduce the level of binge drinking.<ref name="Webb-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Webb | first1 = G. | last2 = Shakeshaft | first2 = A. | last3 = Sanson-Fisher | first3 = R. | last4 = Havard | first4 = A. | title = A systematic review of work-place interventions for alcohol-related problems | journal = Addiction | volume = 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 365–77 | month = Mar | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02472.x | pmid = 19207344 }}</ref> In the US brief motivational interventions have shown some benefit in reducing future binge drinking.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

Evaluation of personal pattern of drinking and associated risks and an emphasis on personal responsibility in a non-condescending manner is recommended during the intervention; discussing and informing/educating the adolescent of possible negative short and [[long-term effects of alcohol|long-term consequences of drinking]] is recommended. The setting of goals and rules to achieve those goals is also recommended during intervention with problem binge drinking adolescents.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

Increasing public information and awareness regarding the risks of binge drinking, conducting interviews in emergency departments of young people suspected of harmful drinking patterns and trying to persuade them to accept individual counseling in youth addiction counseling services are effective strategies for reducing the harm of binge drinking. Encouraging recreational training activities such as adventurous training activities such as climbing or driving can be an alternative "natural buzzes" to alcohol misuse. Additionally the provision of educational content about the risks of binge drinking and a risk assessment are beneficial during intervention with young binge drinkers and a referral in the case of an alcohol use disorder for specialised help.<ref name="Stolle-2009"/>

==Epidemiology==
{{Main|Epidemiology of binge drinking}}
Binge drinking is more common in men than it is in women. Among students in the US, approximately 50 percent of men and 39 percent of women binge drink. Racial differences exist among binge drinking with Hispanics followed by white people having the highest level of binge drinking. It is a common pattern among [[American Indian alcoholism|Native Americans]].<ref name=PSL>{{cite book|title=A Poison Stronger than Love: The Destruction of an Ojibwa Community|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300033257|author=Anestasia M.

[[File:Stonehenge trouble on stones.jpg|thumb|Binge drinking can prompt police action for [[public intoxication]] and [[disturbing the peace]].]]
Individuals of African descent have a lower level of binge drinking followed by those of Asian descent. In the case of Asians their low level of binge drinking may be due to the presence of the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH2, Chromosome 12) in many (but by no means the vast majority) that results in poor metabolism of alcohol which leads to severe adverse effects such as facial flushing.<ref name="Courtney-2009"/>
Men are more likely to binge drink (up to 81 percent of alcohol binges are done by men) than women and men are also more likely to develop alcohol dependence than women. People who are homozygous for the ALDH2 gene are less likely to binge drink due to severe adverse effects which occur even with moderate amounts of alcohol consumption.

==Society and culture==
Binge drinking costs the UK economy approximately £20 billion a year; 17 million working days are estimated to be lost due to hangovers and drink-related illness each year. The cost of binge drinking to employers  is estimated to be £6.4 billion and the cost per year of alcohol harm is estimated to cost the National Health Service £2.7 billion.<ref name="Ward-"/> Urgent action has been recommended to understand the binge drinking culture and its aetiology and pathogenesis and urgent action has been called for to educate people with regard to the dangers of binge drinking.<ref name="Ward-"/>

[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] released a study in October 2011 that showed that in the United States, binge drinking costs society $223-billion a year, which amounts to $2 per drink. These costs include health care costs for alcohol-related issues, including liver cirrhosis, loss of work productivity, property damage due to drunk driving, and expenditures related to criminal acts.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/Features/AlcoholConsumption/ CDC Says Binge Drinking Costs US $223 Billion]</ref>
