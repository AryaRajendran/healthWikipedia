In medicine, a '''fistula''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|s|t|j|ʊ|l|ə}};<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fistula Entry "fistula"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref> pl. ''fistulas'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|s|t|j|ʊ|l|ə|z}}), or ''fistulae'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|s|t|j|ʊ|l|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ|s|t|j|ʊ|l|ai}})) is an abnormal connection or passageway between two [[epithelium]]-lined organs or vessels that normally do not connect.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000040590|fistula}}</ref> It is generally a disease condition, but a fistula may be surgically created for therapeutic reasons.

==Types==

Various types of fistulas include:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Types
!Name
!Definition
|-
|Blind
|with only one open end
|-
|Complete
|with both external and internal openings
|-
|Incomplete
|a fistula with an external skin opening, which does not connect to any internal organ
|}

Although most fistulas are in forms of a tube, some can also have multiple branches.

==Causes==

Various causes of fistula are:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Causes
!Category
!Elaboration
|-
|Diseases
|Inflammatory bowel disease in the form of [[Crohn's disease]], but not [[ulcerative colitis]], are the leading causes of anorectal, enteroenteral, and enterocutaneous fistulas. A person with severe stage-3 [[hidradenitis suppurativa]] will also develop fistulas.
|-
|Medical treatment
|Complications from gallbladder surgery can lead to biliary fistula.  Radiation therapy can lead to vesicovaginal fistula. An arteriovenous fistula can be deliberately created, as described below in ''therapeutic use''.
|-
|Trauma
|Head trauma can lead to [[perilymph fistula]]s, whereas trauma to other parts of the body can cause arteriovenous fistulas. Obstructed labor can lead to vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulas. An [[obstetric fistula]] develops when blood supply to the tissues of the vagina and the bladder (and/or rectum) is cut off during prolonged obstructed labor. The tissues die and a hole forms through which urine and/or feces pass uncontrollably.  [[vesicovaginal fistula|Vesicovaginal]] and [[rectovaginal fistula]]s may also be caused by rape, in particular gang rape, and rape with foreign objects, as evidenced by the abnormally high number of women in conflict areas who have suffered fistulae.<ref>[http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2005/congo.asp Stephanie Nolen, "Not Women Anymore…" Ms. Magazine, Spring 2005]</ref><ref>[http://www.unfpa.org/news/news.cfm?ID=816 UNFPA: United Nations Population Fund. Press Release, 22 June 2006. "More Funding Needed to Help Victims of Sexual Violence"]</ref> In 2003, thousands of women in eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] presented themselves for treatment of traumatic fistula caused by systematic, violent gang rape that occurred during the country's five years of war. So many cases have been reported that the destruction of the vagina is considered a war injury and recorded by doctors as a crime of combat.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14059-2003Oct24 Emily Wax, Washington Post Foreign Service.

== Treatment ==

Treatment for fistulae varies depending on the cause and extent of the fistula, but often involves surgical intervention combined with [[antibiotic]] therapy.  

Typically the first step in treating a fistula is an examination by a doctor to determine the extent and "path" that the fistula takes through the tissue. 

In some cases the fistula is temporarily covered, for example a fistula caused by [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]] is often treated with a [[palatal obturator]] to delay the need for surgery to a more appropriate age.

Surgery is often required to assure adequate drainage of the fistula (so that [[pus]] may escape without forming an [[abscess]]).  Various surgical procedures are commonly used, most commonly [[fistulotomy]], placement of a [[Seton stitch|seton]] (a cord that is passed through the path of the fistula to keep it open for draining), or an endorectal flap procedure (where healthy tissue is pulled over the internal side of the fistula to keep feces or other material from reinfecting the channel). Treatment involves filling the fistula with fibrin glue; also plugging it with plugs made of porcine small intestine submucosa have also been explored in recent years, with variable success. Surgery for anorectal fistulae is not without side effects, including recurrence, reinfection, and incontinence.

It is important to note that surgical treatment of a fistula without diagnosis or management of the underlying condition, if any, is not recommended.  For example, surgical treatment of fistulae in [[Crohn's disease]] can be effective, but if the Crohn's disease itself is not treated, the rate of recurrence of fistula is very high (well above 50%).

== Therapeutic use ==

In [[end stage renal failure]] patients, a [[cimino fistula]] is often deliberately created in the arm by means of a short day surgery in order to permit easier withdrawal of blood for [[hemodialysis]].

As a radical treatment for [[portal hypertension]], surgical creation of a portacaval fistula produces an anastomosis between the [[hepatic portal vein]] and the [[inferior vena cava]] across the omental foramen (of Winslow).  This spares the portal venous system from high pressure which can cause esophageal varices, [[caput medusa]]e, and hemorrhoids.
