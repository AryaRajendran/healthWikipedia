The '''Schilling test''' is a medical investigation used for patients with [[vitamin B12|vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]] deficiency.<ref name="pmid6470805">{{cite journal |author=Zuckier LS, Chervu LR |title=Schilling evaluation of pernicious anemia: current status |journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=1032–9 |year=1984 |month=September |pmid=6470805 |doi= |url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6470805}}</ref> The purpose of the test is to determine whether the patient has [[pernicious anemia]]. 

It is named for [[Robert F. Schilling]].<ref name="urlSchilling+test - Definition from Merriam-Websters Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://medical.merriam-webster.com/medical/schilling%20test |title=Schilling+test - Definition from Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref>

==Process==
The Schilling test has multiple stages.<ref name="urlMedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Schilling test">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003572.htm |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Schilling test |work= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> As noted below, it can be done at any time after vitamin B{{ssub|12}} supplementation and body store replacement, and some clinicians recommend that in severe deficiency cases, at least several weeks of vitamin repletion be done before the test (more than one B{{ssub|12}} shot, and also oral folic acid), in order to insure that impaired absorption of B{{ssub|12}} (with or without intrinsic factor) is not occurring, due to damage to the intestinal mucosa from the conditions of malabsorption arising from B{{ssub|12}} and folate deficiency themselves.

===Stage 1: oral vitamin B{{ssub|12}} plus intramuscular vitamin B{{ssub|12}} ===
In the first part of the test, the patient is given [[Radioisotopic labelling|radiolabeled]] vitamin B{{ssub|12}} to drink or eat. The most commonly used radiolabels are <sup>57</sup>[[cobalt|Co]] and <sup>58</sup>Co. An [[intramuscular]] injection of unlabeled vitamin B{{ssub|12}} is given an hour later. This is not enough to replete or saturate body stores of B{{ssub|12}} (this requires about 10 B{{ssub|12}} injections over some length of time). The purpose of the single injection is to temporarily saturate B{{ssub|12}} receptors in the liver with enough normal vitamin B{{ssub|12}} to prevent radioactive vitamin B{{ssub|12}} binding in body tissues (especially in the liver), so that if absorbed from the G.I. tract, it will pass into the urine. The patient's urine is then collected over the next 24 hours to assess the absorption.

Normally, the ingested radiolabeled vitamin B{{ssub|12}} will be absorbed into the body. Since the body already has liver receptors for [[transcobalamin]]/vitamin B{{ssub|12}} saturated by the injection, much of the ingested vitamin B{{ssub|12}} will be [[excretion|excreted]] in the urine.

* A normal result shows '''at least 10%''' of the radiolabeled vitamin B{{ssub|12}} in the urine over the first 24 hours.
* In patients with pernicious anemia or with deficiency due to impaired absorption, '''less than 10%''' of the radiolabeled vitamin B{{ssub|12}} is detected.

The normal test will result in a higher amount of the radiolabeled cobalamin in the urine because it will have been absorbed by the intestinal epithelium, but passed into the urine because all hepatic B12 receptors were occupied. An abnormal result will cause less of the labeled cobalamin to appear in the urine because it will remain in the intestine and be passed into the feces.

===Stage 2: vitamin B{{ssub|12}} and intrinsic factor ===
If an abnormality is found, i.e. the B12 in the urine is only present in low levels, the test is repeated, this time with additional oral [[intrinsic factor]]. 

* If this second urine collection is normal, this shows a lack of intrinsic factor production, or [[pernicious anemia]].
* A low result on the second test implies abnormal [[intestine|intestinal]] absorption ([[malabsorption]]), which could be caused by [[coeliac disease]], [[bile|biliary]] disease, [[Whipple's disease]], fish tapeworm infestation ([[Diphyllobothrium]] latum), or [[liver]] disease. Malabsorption of B{{ssub|12}} can be caused by intestinal dysfunction from a low vitamin level in-and-of-itself (see below), causing test result confusion if repletion has not been done for some days previously.

===Stage 3: vitamin B{{ssub|12}} and antibiotics ===
This stage is useful for identifying patients with [[bacterial overgrowth syndrome]].

===Stage 4: vitamin B{{ssub|12}} and pancreatic enzymes ===
This stage, in which [[pancreatic enzymes]] are administered, can be useful in identifying patients with [[pancreatitis]].

===Combined stage 1 and stage 2===
In some versions of the Schilling's test, B{{ssub|12}} can be given both with and without intrinsic factor at the same time, using different cobalt radioisotopes <sup>57</sup>Co and <sup>58</sup>Co, which have different radiation signatures, in order to differentiate the two forms of B{{ssub|12}}. This allows for only a single radioactive urine collection.<ref name="pmid7658228">{{cite journal |author=Krynyckyi BR, Zuckier LS |title=Accuracy of measurement of dual-isotope Schilling test urine samples:  a multicenter study [corrected] |journal=J. Nucl. Med. |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=1659–65 |year=1995 |month=September |pmid=7658228 |doi= |url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7658228}}</ref>

==Complications==
Note that the B{{ssub|12}} shot which begins the Schilling's test is enough to go a considerable way toward treating B{{ssub|12}} deficiency, so the test is also a partial ''treatment'' for B{{ssub|12}} deficiency. Also, the classic Schilling test can be performed at any time, even after full B{{ssub|12}} repletion and correction of the anemia, and it will still show if the cause of the B{{ssub|12}} deficiency was intrinsic-factor related. In fact, some clinicians have suggested that folate and B{{ssub|12}} replacement for several weeks be normally performed ''before'' a Schilling's test is done, since folate and B{{ssub|12}} deficiencies are both known to interfere with intestinal cell function, and thus cause malabsorption of B{{ssub|12}} on their own, even if intrinsic factor is being made. This state would then tend to cause a false-positive test for both simple B{{ssub|12}} and intrinsic factor-related B{{ssub|12}} malabsorption. Several weeks of vitamin replacement are necessary, before epithelial damage to the G.I. tract from B{{ssub|12}} deficiency is corrected.

Many labs have stopped performing the Schilling's test, due to lack of production of the cobalt radioisotopes and labeled-B{{ssub|12}} test substances. Also, injection replacement of B{{ssub|12}} has become relatively inexpensive, and can be self-administered by patients, as well as megadose oral B{{ssub|12}}. Since these are the same treatments which would be administered for most causes of B{{ssub|12}} malabsorption even if the exact cause were identified, the diagnostic test may be omitted without damage to the patient (so long as follow-up treatment and occasional serum B{{ssub|12}} testing is not allowed to lapse). 

It is possible for use of other radiopharmaceuticals to interfere with interpretation of the test.<ref name="pmid8970521">{{cite journal |author=Zuckier LS, Stabin M, Krynyckyi BR, Zanzonico P, Binkert B |title=Effect of prior radiopharmaceutical administration on Schilling test performance: analysis and recommendations |journal=J.
