The '''American College of Pediatricians''' ('''ACPeds''') is a [[social conservatism in the United States|socially conservative]] association of pediatricians and other healthcare professionals in the United States. The College was founded in 2002 by a group of pediatricians including Joseph Zanga, a past president of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP), as a protest against the AAP's support for [[LGBT adoption|adoption by gay couples]].<ref name="Pinto"/><ref name="Kranish">{{cite news|first = Michael|last = Kranish|title = Beliefs drive research agenda of new think tanks|url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2005/07/31/beliefs_drive_research_agenda_of_new_think_tanks/|work=Boston Globe|date = July 31, 2005|accessdate =October 21, 2007}}</ref> The ACPeds website reports members in 47 states of the United States and five other countries,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acpeds.org/About-Us.html | title = About Us | publisher = American College of Pediatricians}} (self-published)</ref> but does not disclose the total member count.

Zanga has described ACP as a group "with Judeo-Christian, traditional values that is open to pediatric medical professionals of all religions who hold true to the group's core beliefs: that life begins at conception; and that the traditional family unit, headed by a different-sex couple, poses far fewer risk factors in the adoption and raising of children."<ref name=catexch>{{cite web | url = http://catholicexchange.com/2003/07/30/90378/ | title = Pro-Life Pediatric Group Stands Contrary to Established American Academy of Pediatrics | publisher = Catholic Exchange |date=July 30, 2003 }}</ref> The organization's view on parenting is at odds with the position of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical and child welfare authorities, which hold that [[sexual orientation]] has no correlation with the ability to be a good parent and to raise healthy and well-adjusted children.<ref name="brief">{{cite web | url = http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/briefs/march09/34618SocialWorkers.pdf |date=February 16, 2009 | format = PDF | title = Brief of Amici Curiae | author = [[National Association of Social Workers]] | publisher = [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]]}}</ref><ref name="aap-position">{{cite journal |title=Coparent or second-parent adoption by same-sex parents |journal=Pediatrics |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=339&ndash;40 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11826219 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11826219 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Policy Statement—AAP publications retired and reaffirmed |journal=Pediatrics |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=845 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19651598 |doi=10.1542/peds.2009-1415 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19651598 }}</ref> A number of prominent researchers have complained that ACPeds mischaracterized or misused their work to advance its agenda.<ref name="Pinto"/><ref name="collins-statement">{{Cite web | url=http://www.nih.gov/about/director/04152010_statement_ACP.htm | title= Response to the American College of Pediatricians | date=April 16, 2010 | accessdate=July 20, 2011 | first = Francis | last = Collins | authorlink = Francis Collins | publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110727115017/http://www.nih.gov/about/director/04152010_statement_ACP.htm| archivedate= July 27, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

== Positions ==

The positions taken by the American College of Pediatricians are socially conservative. The organization advocates:<ref>{{cite web |title = Position Statements  | publisher = American College of Pediatricians | url = http://acpeds.org/Position-Statements-Where-We-Stand.html | accessdate =November 17, 2010 }} (self-published)</ref>

* Discouraging the adoption of children by same-sex couples or single parents;
* Limiting children's exposure to electronic media, particularly in relation to explicit violent and sexual content;
* Parental choice as to when and whether a child receives the [[HPV vaccine]]. ACPeds opposes legislation requiring HPV vaccination;
* Opposition to [[Legal history of cannabis in the United States|marijuana legalization]];
* Support for selective parental use of [[corporal punishment]] in child discipline;
* Opposition to abortion;
* Support for [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-based sex education]] rather than comprehensive sex education

The American College of Pediatricians argues that mainstream health organizations have taken public positions based on their own social and political views, rather than the available science.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://acpeds.org/?CONTEXT=art&cat=10002&art=150&BISKIT=1384444439 |title = A Brief History of the American College of Pediatricians | publisher = American College of Pediatricians}} (self-published)</ref>

== Reactions ==
[[Frank Rich]], writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', described ACPeds as a "political organization peddling homophobic junk-science."<ref name="nyt-rich">{{cite news | first = Frank | last = Rich | authorlink = Frank Rich |work=New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/opinion/16rich.html | title = A Heaven-Sent Rent Boy | date = May 15, 2010 | accessdate =July 20, 2011}}</ref> In an [[amicus brief]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]] described ACPeds as a "small and marginal group" which was "out of step with the research-based position of the AAP and other medical and child welfare authorities."<ref name="brief"/> [[PFLAG]] identifies the American College of Pediatricians as an anti-equality organization, describing the group as a "small splinter group of medical professionals who do not support the mainstream view of the American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) that homosexuality is a normal aspect of human diversity."<ref>{{cite web|title=Anti-Equality Organizations|publisher=[[PFLAG]]|url=http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=504|accessdate=November 17, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101229090937/http://community.pflag.org/Page.aspx?pid=504| archivedate= December 29, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Gary Remafedi, a pediatrician at the [[University of Minnesota]], found his research being cited by ACPeds to argue that schools should deny support to gay teenagers. Remafedi complained that ACPeds had fundamentally mischaracterized his work, saying: "It's obvious that they didn't even read my research. I mean, they spelled my name wrong every time they cited it." Remafedi complained to ACPeds that his work was being misrepresented, but the organization refused to correct or retract its assertions, leading Remafedi to state that ACPeds had "deliberately distorted my research for malicious purposes."<ref name="Pinto"/>

Responding to claims by ACPeds that same-sex attraction could be "cured", [[Francis Collins]], geneticist and director of the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]], denounced ACPeds' use of his work, noting it was "disturbing" to see ACPeds use his scientific work in a "misleading and incorrect" way by taking work from one of his books out of context to "support an ideology that can cause unnecessary anguish and encouraged prejudice" against school children.<ref name="collins-statement"/>

[[Warren Throckmorton]], a therapist who specializes in sexual orientation issues, similarly complained that his research had been misused, saying of ACPeds: "They say they're impartial and not motivated by political or religious concerns, but if you look at who they're affiliated with and how they're using the research, that's just obviously not true."<ref name="Pinto"/>

== ''Facts About Youth'' ==
In response to the publication by AAP of ''Just the Facts'', a handbook on teen sexual orientation aimed at a school audience, ACPeds published its own ''Facts About Youth'' in March 2010,<ref name=Pinto>{{cite news|last=Pinto|first=Nick|title=University of Minnesota professor's research hijacked |url=http://www.citypages.com/2010-05-26/news/university-of-minnesota-professor-s-research-hijacked/|accessdate=November 17, 2010|newspaper=Minneapolis City Pages|date=May 26, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101117131203/http://www.citypages.com/2010-05-26/news/university-of-minnesota-professor-s-research-hijacked/| archivedate= November 17, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> accompanied by a web site.<ref>[http://factsaboutyouth.com/ ''Facts About Youth''] (ACPeds site)</ref> ''Facts About Youth'', along with a cover letter,<ref>[http://factsaboutyouth.com/posts/attention-school-superintendents/ "Attention: School Superintendents"] (ACPeds site)</ref> was mailed to 14,800 school superintendents on behalf of Tom Benton, president of ACPeds.  ''Facts About Youth'' was challenged as not acknowledging the scientific and medical evidence regarding sexual orientation, sexual identity, sexual health, or effective health education by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth |url=http://www.aap.org/featured/sexualorientation.htm |publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|accessdate=December 14, 2010|date=April 13, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101119095249/http://aap.org/featured/sexualorientation.htm| archivedate= November 19, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The ACPeds letter to the superintendents primarily addressed same-sex attraction, and recommended that “well-intentioned but misinformed school personnel” who encourage students to “come out as gay” and affirm them as such may lead the students into “harmful homosexual behaviors that they otherwise would not pursue.”  The ACPeds letter to the superintendents also stated that [[gender identity disorder]] will typically disappear by puberty “if the behavior is not reinforced.”<ref>
