The '''posterior cruciate ligament''' (or PCL) is one of the four major [[ligament]]s of the [[knee]]. It connects the [[posterior intercondylar area]] of the [[tibia]] to the [[Medial condyle of femur|medial condyle]] of the [[femur]]. This configuration allows the PCL to resist forces pushing the tibia posteriorly relative to the femur. 

In the [[quadruped]] [[Stifle joint|stifle]] (analogous to the human knee), based on its [[Anatomical terms of location#Sources of confusion|anatomical position]], it is referred to as the '''caudal cruciate ligament'''.<ref name="caudal">{{cite encyclopedia |editor = Blood, Douglas C.; Studdert, Virginia P.; Gay, Clive C. (2007). |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/caudal+(posterior)+cruciate+ligament |title =Cruciate |encyclopedia =Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |isbn=978-0-7020-2788-8 |edition=3rd}}</ref>

The PCL is an intracapsular ligament along with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) because it lies deep within the knee joint. They are both isolated from the fluid-filled synovial cavity, with the synovial membrane wrapped around them. The PCL gets its name by attaching to the posterior portion of the tibia.<ref>Saladin, K. S. 2010. Anatomy & Physiology: 5th edition. McGraw-Hill</ref>

==Epidemiology Injuries to the Posterior Cruciate Ligament==

===Percentage of Posterior cruciate ligaments to other knee injuries===
According to<ref>Majewski et al.</ref> the posterior cruciate ligament injuries only account for 1.5 percent of all knee injuries (figure 2). If it is a single injury to the posterior cruciate ligament that requires surgery only accounted for 1.1 percent compared to all other cruciate surgeries but when there was multiple injuries to the [[knee]] the posterior cruciate ligament accounted for 1.2 percent of injuries.

===National statistics of Posterior cruciate ligament===
In 2010 national statistics was done by <ref>[[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]</ref> for posterior cruciate ligaments injuries. They found that 463 patients were discharge for having some type of [[PCL]] injury. The 18-44 year old age group was found to have the highest injuries reported (figure 1). One reason why this age group consists of the majority of injuries to the [[PCL]] is because people are still very active in sports at this age. Men were also reported having more injuries to the [[PCL]](figure 3).

===Recommendation for surgery to the posterior cruciate ligament===
A grade III PLC injury with more than 10mm posterior translation when the posterior drawer examination is performed may be treated surgically. Patients that do not improve stability during physical therapy or develop an increase in pain will be recommended for surgery.<ref>(Mariani teal., 2002)</ref>==Injury==

The posterior [[drawer test]] is one of the tests used by doctors and physiotherapists to detect injury to the PCL.  

Surgery to repair the Posterior Cruciate ligament is controversial due to its placement and technical difficulty.<ref>{{cite web

The function of the PCL is to prevent the femur from sliding off the anterior edge of the tibia and to prevent the tibia from displacing posterior to the femur. Common causes of PCL injuries are direct blows to the flexed knee, such as the knee hitting the dashboard in a car accident or falling hard on the knee, both instances displacing the tibia posterior to the femur.<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001075.htm</ref>

An additional test of posterior cruciate ligament injury is the ''posterior sag test'', where, in contrast to the drawer test, no active force is applied. Rather, the person lies supine with the leg held by another person so that the hip is flexed to 90 degrees and the knee 90 degrees.<ref>[http://at.uwa.edu/Special%20Tests/SpecialTests/LowerBody/Post%20Sag.htm Posterior Sag Test] From The University of West Alabama, Athletic Training & Sports Medicine Center. Retrieved Feb 2011</ref> The main parameter in this test is ''step-off'', which is the shortest distance from the femur to a hypothetical line that [[tangent]]s the surface of the tibia from the [[tibial tuberosity]] and upwards. Normally, the ''step-off'' is approximately 1&nbsp;cm, but is decreased (Grade I) or even absent (Grade II) or inverse (Grade III) in injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament.<ref>[http://books.google.se/books?id=W6z8508TSfAC&pg=PA719 Page 719] in: {{cite book |author=Cole, Brian; Miller, Mark J. |title=Textbook of arthroscopy |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-0013-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Patients who are suspected to have a posterior cruciate ligament injury should always be evaluated for other knee injuries that often occur in combination with an PCL injuries. These include cartilage/[[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] injuries, bone bruises, ACL tears, fractures, [[posterolateral injuries]] and collateral ligament injuries.

===How Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injury Occurs===
[[File:PCL Flexion and Hyperflexion.png|thumb|In this medial view of the flexed knee, the lateral femoral condyle has been removed to reveal the structure of the PCL. Because the anterolateral bundle is stretched and the posteromedial bundle relaxed during flexion, excessive flexion in the form of hyperflexion causes tensile stress, shown in red, on the anterolateral bundle of the PCL that leads to PCL injury.]]

====Related Anatomy of the PCL====
To understand how Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) injury can occur, one must consider the anatomical and physiological properties of the PCL. The PCL is located within the [[knee]] joint where it stabilizes the articulating bones, particularly the [[femur]] and the [[tibia]], during movement. It originates from the lateral edge of the medial [[femoral condyle]] and the roof of the [[Intercondylar fossa of femur|intercondyle notch]] <ref name="Amis-2006">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Amis | first1 = AA. | last2 = Gupte | first2 = CM. | last3 = Bull | first3 = AM. | last4 = Edwards | first4 = A. | title = Anatomy of the posterior cruciate ligament and the meniscofemoral ligaments. | journal = Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–63 | month = Mar | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1007/s00167-005-0686-x | PMID = 16228178 }}</ref> then stretches, at a posterior and lateral angle, toward the posterior of the tibia just below its articular surface.<ref name="Girgis-">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Girgis | first1 = FG. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = JL. | last3 = Monajem | first3 = A. | title = The cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.

====Related Physiological Features of the PCL====
Although each PCL is a unified unit, they are described as separate anterolateral and posteromedial sections based off where each section's attachment site and function.<ref name="Malone-2006">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Malone | first1 = AA. | last2 = Dowd | first2 = GS. | last3 = Saifuddin | first3 = A. | title = Injuries of the posterior cruciate ligament and posterolateral corner of the knee. | journal = Injury | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 485–501 | month = Jun | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.injury.2005.08.003 | PMID = 16360655 }}</ref> During knee joint movement, the PCL rotates <ref name="Voos-2012"/><ref name="DeFrate-2004">{{Cite journal  | last1 = DeFrate | first1 = LE. | last2 = Gill | first2 = TJ. | last3 = Li | first3 = G. | title = In vivo function of the posterior cruciate ligament during weightbearing knee flexion. | journal = Am J Sports Med | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 1923–8 | month = Dec | year = 2004 | doi =  | PMID = 15572322 }}</ref> such that the anterolateral section stretches in [[knee flexion]] but not in [[Extension (kinesiology)|knee extension]] and the posteromedial bundle stretches in extension rather than flexion.<ref name="Chandrasekaran-2012"/><ref name="Race-1994">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Race | first1 = A. | last2 = Amis | first2 = AA. | title = The mechanical properties of the two bundles of the human posterior cruciate ligament. | journal = J Biomech | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–24 | month = Jan | year = 1994 | doi =  | PMID = 8106532 }}</ref>

==Prevention: Posterior Cruciate Ligament==

===Knee Injury===
Knee injuries are very common among athletes as well as regular active people and can always be prevented. [[Ligament]] tears account for more than forty percent of knee injuries and the [[posterolateral knee injuries|posterior cruciate ligament]] is considered one of the less common injuries.<ref>Rigby, J. M., & Porter, K. M. (2010). Posterior cruciate ligament injuries. Trauma, 12(3), 175-181</ref> Although it is less common, there are still important measures that can be taken in order to prevent this type of knee injury. Maintaining proper exercise and sport technique is crucial for injury prevention, which include not exceeding the body or not going over the proper [[range of motion]] of the knee, properly warming up and cooling down<ref>Sancheti, P., Razi, M., Ramanathan, E., & Yung, P. (2010). Injuries around the knee – Symposium. British Journal Of Sports Medicine</ref>

===Quadriceps and Hamstring Ratio===
Another important aspect of maintaining an injury free knee is having strong [[quadriceps]] and hamstring muscles because they help stabilize the knee. A low hamstring to quadriceps ratio is associated with knee injury and should be about eighty percent.<ref>Daneshjoo, A., Mokhtar, A., Rahnama, N., & Yusof, A. (2012). The Effects of Injury Preventive Warm-Up Programs on Knee Strength Ratio in Young Male Professional Soccer Players. Plos ONE, 7(12), 1-7.</ref> Some exercises to strengthen the quadriceps and hamstring muscles include leg curls, leg lifts, prone knee flexion with resistance band and knee extensions. Some stretches to help prevent [[injury]] to the posterior cruciate ligament include stretching of the [[hamstring muscles]] by extending the legs, toes pointing up, leaning forward until the stretch is felt and holding for a few seconds. 
[[File:Prone Knee Flexion.JPG|thumb|Exercises that strengthen the knee joints and the hamstrings include prone knee flexion. Where the knee flexes all the way back to the rear end, hold for about 10 seconds, then slowly lower to original position and repeat.]]

===Exercises and Stretches===
In addition, balancing exercises have also been adopted because it has been proven that people with poor balance have more knee injuries than those with good balance. Wobble boards and Bosu balls are very common pieces of equipment used to balance and help prevent knee injuries as long as they are being used with trained personnel.<ref>Hrysomallis, C. (2007). Relationship Between Balance Ability, Training and Sports Injury Risk. Sports Medicine, 37(6), 547-557</ref> Another possible preventive measure is wearing knee straps to help stabilize the knee and protect it from injury, especially during demanding sports such as football.<ref>Altonen, S., Karjalainen, H., Heinonen, A., Parkhari, J., & Kujala, U. M. (2007). Prevention of Sports Injuries. Archives Of Internal Medicine, 167(15), 1585-1592.</ref>

==Treatment==
It is possible for the PCL to heal on its own. Surgery is usually required in complete tears of the ligament. Surgery usually takes place after a few weeks, in order to allow swelling to decrease and regular motion to return to the knee. A procedure called ligament reconstruction is used to replace the torn PCL with a new ligament, which is usually a graft taken from the hamstring or Achilles tendon from a host cadaver.  An arthroscope allows a complete evaluation of the entire knee joint, including the knee cap (patella), the cartilage surfaces, the meniscus, the ligaments (ACL & PCL), and the joint lining. Then, the new ligament is attached to the bone of the thigh and lower leg with screws to hold it in place.<ref>http://www.orthspec.com/pdfs/PCL-injuries.pdf</ref>

==Posterior Cruciate Ligament Rehabilitation==

===Grades of Injury===
[[File:Gray348-2.png|thumb|The Posterior cruciate ligament is located within the knee]]
The Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is located within the knee. [[Ligaments]] are sturdy bands of tissues that connect bones. Similar to the [[anterior cruciate ligament]], the PCL connects the [[femur]] to the [[tibia]]. There are four different grades of classification in which medical doctor’s classify a PCL injury: Grade I, the PCL has a slight tear. Grade II, the PCL ligament is minimally torn and becomes loose. Grade III, the PCL is torn completely and the knee can now be categorized as unstable. Grade IV, the ligament is damaged along with another [[ligament]] housed in the knee (i.e ACL). With these grades of PCL injuries, there are different treatments available for such injuries.

===Rehabilitation Options===
It is possible for the PCL to heal on its own without surgery when it is in Grades I and II. PCL injuries that are diagnosed in these categories can have their recovery times reduced by performing certain rehabilitative exercises. Fernandez and Pugh(2012) found that following a PCL grade II diagnosis, a [[multimodal]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2013}} treatment that spanned over the course of 8 weeks consisting of [[chiropractic]] lumbopelvic manipulation, [[physiotherapy]], and implementing an exercise program that emphasized in [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|eccentric]] muscle contraction ([[lunge (exercise)|lunge]]s, 1-leg squats , and trunk stabilization)  which proved to be an effective way to recover from the PCL injury.<ref>Fernandez, M. , Pugh, D. (2012) Multimodal and interdisciplinary management of an isolated partial tear of the posterior cruciate ligament: a case report. Journal of Chiropractic Medicine. 11(2), 84-93.</ref> For Grades III and IV, operative surgery is recommended or is usually needed. [[Grafts]] is the method when addressing PCL injuries that are in need of operative surgery. With grafts, there are different methods such as the tibial inlay or tunnel method.<ref>Wind, W. M., Bergfeld, J. A., & Parker, R. D. (2004). Evaluation and treatment of posterior cruciate ligament injuries: Revisited. American Journal of Sports Medicine, 32(7), 1765-1775.
