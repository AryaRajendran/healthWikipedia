A '''parasitic twin''' (also known as an '''asymmetrical''' or '''unequal conjoined twin''') is the result of the processes that produce [[vanishing twin]]s and [[conjoined twins]], and may represent a continuum between the two.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Parasitic twins occur when a twin embryo begins developing [[in utero]], but the pair does not fully separate, and one embryo maintains dominant development at the expense of the other. Unlike conjoined twins, one ceases development during [[gestation]] and is [[vestigial]] to a mostly fully formed, otherwise healthy individual twin. The undeveloped twin is defined as [[parasite|parasitic]], rather than conjoined, because it is incompletely formed or wholly dependent on the body functions of the complete fetus.
The independent twin is called the '''autosite'''. 

==Variants==
* Conjoined-parasitic twins joined at the head are described as '''craniopagus''' or '''cephalopagus''', and '''occipitalis''' if joined in the [[occipital lobe|occipital]] region or '''parietalis''' if joined in the [[parietal lobe|parietal]] region.
*'''[[Craniopagus parasiticus]]''' is a general term for a parasitic head attached to the head of a more fully developed fetus or infant.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Aquino DB, Timmons C, Burns D, Lowichik A | title=Craniopagus parasiticus: a case illustrating its relationship to craniopagus conjoined twinning | journal=Pediatric Pathology and Laboratory Medicine | year=1997 | pages=939â€“44 | volume=17 | issue=6  | pmid=9353833 | doi=10.1080/107710497174381}}</ref>
* [[Fetus in fetu]] sometimes is interpreted as a special case of parasitic twin, but may be a distinct entity.
* The [[Twin reversed arterial perfusion]], or TRAP sequence, results in an ''acardiac twin'', a parasitic twin that fails to develop a head, arms and a [[heart]].  The parasitic twin, little more than a [[torso]] with or without legs, receives its blood supply from the host twin by means of an umbilical cord-like structure, much like a [[fetus in fetu]], except the acardiac twin is outside the host twin's body. The blood received by the parastitic twin has already been used by normal fetus, and as such is already de-oxygenated, leaving little developmental nutrients for the acardiac twin. Because it is pumping blood for both itself and its acardiac twin, this causes extreme stress on the normal fetus's heart. Many TRAP pregnancies result in heart failure for the healthy twin. On 12 December 2008 a Brisbane mother watched this occur during ultrasound. She reported that "their heart just slowed and stopped. There was no jerking or movement from the babies. They just slowed and stopped" {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. This twinning condition usually occurs very early in pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Acardiac Twin or TRAP Sequence |publisher=University of California, San Francisco |date=2007-04-26 |url=http://fetus.ucsfmedicalcenter.org/twin/learn_more_trap.asp |accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> A rare variant of the acardiac fetus is the acardius acormus where the head is well-developed but the heart and the rest of the body are rudimentary. While it is thought that the classical TRAP/Acardius sequence is due to a retrograde flow from the umbilical arteries of the pump twin  to the iliac arteries of the acardiac twin resulting in preferential caudal perfusion,  acardius acormus is thought to be a result of an early embryopathy. <ref> Abi Nader Khalil, Whitten Sara Melissa, Filippi Elisa, Scott Rose-Mary, Jauniaux Eric.
