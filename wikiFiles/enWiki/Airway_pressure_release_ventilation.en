'''Airway pressure release ventilation''' ('''APRV''') is a [[pressure control]] [[mode of mechanical ventilation]] that utilizes an [[inverse ratio ventilation]] strategy.  APRV is an applied [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) that at a set timed interval releases the applied pressure.  Though the name BiVent is commonly referred to, it is discouraged from use, as it is not the appropriate semi-standard nomenclature.

== History ==
Airway pressure release ventilation was described initially by Stock and Downs in 1987<ref name="pmid3568710">{{cite journal| author=Downs JB, Stock MC| title=Airway pressure release ventilation: a new concept in ventilatory support. | journal=Crit Care Med | year= 1987 | volume= 15 | issue= 5 | pages= 459–61 | pmid=3568710 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref name="pmid3552443">{{cite journal| author=Stock MC, Downs JB, Frolicher DA| title=Airway pressure release ventilation. | journal=Crit Care Med | year= 1987 | volume= 15 | issue= 5 | pages= 462–6 | pmid=3552443 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref> as a [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) with an intermittent release phase.  APRV begins at a pressure higher than the baseline pressure and follows with a deflation to accomplish tidal ventilation.<ref>Frawley PM, Habashi NM (2001) Airway pressure release ventilation: theory and practice. AACN Clin Issues 12:234-246</ref>  Fundamentally APRV is a time-cycled alternant between two levels of positive airway pressure, with the main time on the high level and a brief expiratory release to facilitate ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = [[Dietrich Henzler]] | title = What on earth is APRV? | journal = [[Critical care (London, England)]] | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 115 | year = 2011 | month =  | doi = 10.1186/cc9419 | pmid = 21345265 | pmc=3222047}}</ref>

==Inverse ratio ventilation==
This is a type of [[inverse ratio ventilation]].<ref>Kaplan LJ. Bailey H. Formosa V. “Airway pressure release ventilation increases cardiac performance in patients with acute lung injury/adult respiratory distress syndrome” Critical Care (London). 5(4):221-6, 2001 Aug.</ref>  The exhalation time (T<sub>low</sub>) is shortened to usually less than one second to maintain alveoli inflation.  Fundamentally this is a continuous pressure with a brief release.  APRV currently the most efficient conventional mode for lung protective ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = [[Adrian A.

==Settings and measurements==
[[File:Airway pressure release ventilation figure 2007.jpg|thumb|Pressure-time curve for APRV. 'P high' is the high CPAP, 'P low' is the low CPAP, 'T high' is the duration of 'P high,' and 'T low' is the release period or the duration of 'P low.' Spontaneous breathing appears on the top of 'P high.'<ref name="pmid19727373"/>]]
Settings are sometimes brand specific and the term for the individual settings may differ, however generally the settings listed here are a fundamental explanation of the purpose of the settings within the APRV mode.
*'''P<sub>high</sub>''' — This is the inspiratory pressure (just like in pressure control).
*'''T<sub>high</sub>''' — This value is the number of seconds during the inhalation phase.
*'''T<sub>peep</sub>''' — Also known as the T<sub>low</sub>, this is the time allotted for expiration.
*'''FiO<sub>2</sub>''' — The fractional O2 percentage that is being added to the delivered air.

=== Mean airway pressure ===
[[Mean airway pressure]] on APRV is calculated by this formula<ref name="pmid19727373"/>:
:::<math>\frac{(P_{high} * T_{high})\, + (P_{low} * T_{low})} {T_{high} + T_{low}}</math>

==Perceptions and receptions==
Different perceptions of this mode may exist around the globe. While 'APRV' is common to users in [[North America]], a very similar mode, biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP), was introduced in Europe.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = [[M. Baum]], [[H. Benzer]], [[C. Putensen]], [[W. Koller]] & [[G. Putz]] | title = &#91;Biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP)--a new form of augmented ventilation&#93; | journal = [[Der Anaesthesist]] | volume = 38 | issue = 9 | pages = 452–458 | year = 1989 | month = September | pmid = 2686487 }}</ref>  The term APRV has also been used in American journals where, from the ventilation characteristics, BIPAP would have been the appropriate terminology.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = [[C. Putensen]], [[S. Zech]], [[H. Wrigge]], [[J. Zinserling]], [[F. Stuber]], [[T. Von Spiegel]] & [[N. Mutz]]

Other names (BILEVEL, DUOPAP, BIVENT) have been created for legal reasons. Although similar in modality, these terms describe how a mode is intended to inflate the lung, rather than defining the characteristics of synchronization or the way spontaneous breathing efforts are supported.<ref name="pmid10194172"/><ref name="pmid11506110">{{cite journal| author=Wrigge H, Zinserling J, Hering R, Schwalfenberg N, Stüber F, von Spiegel T et al.| title=Cardiorespiratory effects of automatic tube compensation during airway pressure release ventilation in patients with acute lung injury. | journal=Anesthesiology | year= 2001 | volume= 95 | issue= 2 | pages= 382–9 | pmid=11506110 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref>

== Other terms ==
APRV is used by many brands and models of mechanical ventilators under different names.  Most names are copyrighted as trademarks and do not represent [[nomenclature of mechanical ventilation]] but may be referred to clinically by the brand name.

Some of these names include:
* BiVent - (Servo-i ventilator by Maquet)
* BiLevel
* DuoPAP
