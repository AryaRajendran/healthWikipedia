A '''VIPoma''' (also known as '''Verner Morrison syndrome''', after the physicians who first described it)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Verner JV, Morrison AB |title=Islet cell tumor and a syndrome of refractory watery diarrhea and hypokalemia |journal=Am J Med |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=374–80 |year=1958 |month=Sep |pmid=13571250 |doi= 10.1016/0002-9343(58)90075-5|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0002-9343(58)90075-5}}</ref> is a rare (1 per 10,000,000 per year) [[endocrine]] [[tumor]],<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000116307|VIPoma}}</ref> usually (about 90%) originating from non-β [[islet cell]] of the [[pancreas]], that produce [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]] (VIP). It may be associated with [[multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1]].

The massive amounts of VIP in turn cause profound and chronic '''w'''atery '''d'''[[diarrhea|iarrhea]] and resultant  [[dehydration]], '''h'''[[hypokalemia|ypokalemia]], '''a'''[[achlorhydria|chlorhydria]] (hence '''WDHA-syndrome''', or '''pancreatic cholera syndrome'''), acidosis, [[vasodilation]] ([[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] and [[hypotension]]), [[hypercalcemia]] and [[hyperglycemia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mansour JC, Chen H |title=Pancreatic endocrine tumors |journal=J Surg Res |volume=120 |issue=1 |pages=139–61 |year=2004 |month=Jul |pmid=15172200 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2003.12.007 |url=}}</ref>

==Symptoms and signs==
The major clinical features are prolonged watery [[diarrhea]] (fasting stool volume > 750 to 1000 mL/day) and symptoms of [[hypokalemia]] and [[dehydration]].
Half of the patients have relatively constant [[diarrhea]] while the rest have alternating periods of severe and moderate [[diarrhea]].
One third have diarrhea < 1yr before diagnosis, but in 25%, diarrhea is present for 5 yr or more before diagnosis.
[[Lethargy]], muscle weakness, [[nausea]], vomiting and crampy abdominal pain are frequent symptoms.
[[Hypokalemia]] and impaired [[glucose]] tolerance occur in < 50% of patients. [[Achlorhydria]] is also a feature.
During attacks of diarrhea, flushing similar to the [[carcinoid syndrome]] occur rarely.

==Diagnosis==
Besides the clinical picture, [[fasting]] VIP [[blood plasma|plasma]] dosage may confirm the diagnosis, and [[CT scan]] and [[somatostatin]] receptor [[scintigraphy]] are used to localise the [[tumor]], which is usually [[metastasis|metastatic]] at presentation.

Tests include:
* Blood chemistry tests (basic or comprehensive metabolic panel)
* CT scan of the abdomen
* MRI of the abdomen
* Stool examination for cause of diarrhea and electrolyte levels
* Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) level in the blood

==Treatment==
The first goal of treatment is to correct dehydration. Fluids are often given through a vein (intravenous fluids) to replace fluids lost in diarrhea.

The next goal is to slow the diarrhea. Some medications can help control diarrhea. [[Octreotide]], which is a human-made form of the natural hormone somatostatin, blocks the action of VIP.

The best chance for a cure is surgery to remove the tumor. If the tumor has not spread to other organs, surgery can often cure the condition.

Some People seem to respond to a combination chemo called Capecitabine  and Temozolomide but there is no report that it totally cured people from vipoma.

== Outlook (prognosis) ==

Surgery can usually cure VIPomas. However, in one-third to one-half of patients, the tumor has spread by the time of diagnosis and cannot be cured.
