In [[gastroenterology]], a '''sessile serrated adenoma''' (abbreviated '''SSA'''), also known as '''sessile serrated polyp''' (abbreviated '''SSP'''), is a [[premalignant]] flat (or sessile) lesions of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], predominantly seen in the [[cecum]] and [[ascending colon]].

SSAs are thought to lead to [[colorectal cancer]] through the (alternate)  ''serrated pathway''.<ref name=pmid18314605>{{cite journal |author=Rüschoff J, Aust D, Hartmann A |title=[Colorectal serrated adenoma: diagnostic criteria and clinical implications] |language=German |journal=Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol |volume=91 |issue= |pages=119–25 |year=2007 |pmid=18314605 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mäkinen MJ |title=Colorectal serrated adenocarcinoma |journal=Histopathology |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=131–50 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17204027 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2559.2006.02548.x |url=}}</ref>  This differs from most colorectal cancer, which arises from mutations starting with inactivation of the [[APC (gene)|APC gene]].

Multiple SSAs may be part of the ''serrated polyposis syndrome''.<ref name=pmid21660283>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rosty | first1 = C. | last2 = Parry | first2 = S. | last3 = Young | first3 = JP. | title = Serrated polyposis: an enigmatic model of colorectal cancer predisposition. | journal = Patholog Res Int | volume = 2011 | issue =  | pages = 157073 | month =  | year = 2011 | doi = 10.4061/2011/157073 | PMID = 21660283 | url =http://www.hindawi.com/journals/pri/2011/157073/ }}</ref>

==Symptoms==
SSAs, generally, are asymptomatic. They are typically identified on a [[colonoscopy]], by a [[gastroenterologist]], and excised for a definitive diagnosis and treatment.  

==Diagnosis==
SSAs are diagnosed by their microscopic appearance; [[histomorphologic]]ally, they are characterized by (1) basal dilation of the crypts, (2) basal crypt serration, (3) crypts that run horizontal to the basement membrane (horizontal crypts), and (4) crypt branching.  The most common of these features is basal dilation of the crypts.

Unlike traditional colonic [[adenoma]]s (e.g. tubular adenoma, [[villous adenoma]]), they do not (typically) have [[nucleus (cell)|nuclear]] changes (nuclear [[hyperchromatism]], nuclear crowding, elliptical/cigar-shaped nuclei).

==Treatment==
Complete removal of a SSA is considered curative. 

Several SSAs confer a higher risk of subsequently finding [[colorectal carcinoma|colorectal cancer]] and warrant more frequently screening.  The screening guidelines are the same, as for other [[colon (anatomy)|colonic]] [[tubular adenoma|adenoma]]s.  The screening interval is dependent on (1) the number of adenomas, (2) their size and, (3) whether high-grade microscopic features are present.<ref name=pmid17167138>{{cite journal |author=Levine JS, Ahnen DJ |title=Clinical practice.
