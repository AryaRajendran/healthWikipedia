'''Eudemus''' ({{lang-el|Εὔδημος}}) was the name of several [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physicians]], whom it is difficult to distinguish with certainty:

* A druggist, who apparently lived in the 4th or 3rd century BC. He is said by [[Theophrastus]],<ref>Theophrastus, ''Hist. Plant.'' ix. 17. 2</ref> to have been eminent in his trade, and to have professed to be able to take [[hellebore]] without being purged. 
* A celebrated anatomist, who lived probably about the 3rd century BC, as [[Galen]] calls him a contemporary of [[Herophilus]] and [[Erasistratus]].<ref>Galen, ''Comment, in Hippocr. Aphor.'' vi. 1, vol. xviii. pt. 1. p. 7</ref> He appears to have given particular attention to the anatomy and physiology of the [[nervous system]].<ref>Galen, ''de Locis. Affect.'' iii. 14, vol. viii. p. 212.</ref> He considered the [[metacarpus]] and [[metatarsus]] each to consist of five bones,<ref>Galen, ''de Usu Part.'' iii. 8, vol. iii. p. 203</ref> on which point Galen differed from him, but modern anatomists agree with him. He, however, fell into the error of supposing the [[acromion]] to be a distinct and separate bone.<ref>Rufus of Ephesus, ''de Appell. Part. Corp. Hum.'' p. 29.</ref>
* A physician at [[Rome]], who was the paramour of [[Livilla]], the wife of [[Drusus Caesar]], the son of the emperor [[Tiberius]], and who joined her and [[Sejanus]] in their plot for poisoning her husband, 23 AD.<ref>Pliny, ''H. N.'' xxix. 8; Tacitus, ''Ann.'' iv. 3.</ref> He was afterwards put to the [[torture]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Ann.'' iv. 11.</ref> He is supposed to be the same person who is said by [[Caelius Aurelianus]]<ref>Caelius Aurelianus, ''de Morb. Acut.'' ii. 38, p. 171</ref> to have been one of the followers of [[Themison of Laodicea|Themison]], and whose medical observations on hydrophobia and some other diseases are quoted by him. He appears to be the same physician who is mentioned by Galen<ref>Galen, ''de Meth. Med.'' i. 7. vol. x. p. 53</ref> among several others as belonging to the [[Methodic school]].
* A contemporary and personal acquaintance of Galen, in the latter part of the 2nd century.<ref>Galen, ''de Meth. Med.'' vi. 6. vol. x. p. 454.</ref>
* The name is also mentioned several times by Galen,<ref>Galen, ''de Compos. Medic, sec. Locos'', ix. 5, vol. xiii. p. 291, ''de Antid.'' ii. 14, vol. xiv. p. 185</ref> [[Athenaeus]],<ref>Athenaeus, ix. pp. 369, 371</ref> and by other writers.
