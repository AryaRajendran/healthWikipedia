'''Essential tremor''' ('''ET''') is a [[progressive disease|progressive]] [[neurological disorder]] of which the most recognizable feature is a tremor of the [[arm]]s or hands that is apparent during voluntary movements such as eating and writing.<ref>Benito-Leon J, Louis ED. Clinical update: Diagnosis and treatment of essential tremor. The Lancet 2007;369:1152-1153.</ref> This type of tremor is often referred to as "kinetic tremor." The tremor may also occur in the head (neck), jaw and voice as well as other body regions, with the general pattern being that the tremor begins in the arms and then spreads to these other regions in selected patients. Women are more likely to develop the head tremor than are men.<ref>Hubble JP, Busenbark KL, Pahwa R, Lyons K, Koller WC. Clinical expression of essential tremor: Effects of gender and age.

Correlates of functional disability in essential tremor. Mov Disord 2001;16:914-920.</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Essential tremor generally presents as a rhythmic tremor (4–12 [[Hertz|Hz]]) that is present only when the affected [[muscle]] is exerting effort (in other words, it is not present at rest). Any sort of physical or mental [[stress (medicine)|stress]] will tend to make the tremor worse, often creating the false impression that the tremor is of [[psychosomatic]] origin. 

Tremor intensity can worsen in response to fatigue, strong emotions, [[low blood sugar]], cold, [[caffeine]], [[lithium salt]]s, some [[antidepressant]]s or other factors.  It is typical for the tremor to worsen in "performance" situations, such as when writing a cheque for payment at a store or giving a presentation.

ET-related tremors do not occur during sleep, but patients sometimes complain of an especially coarse tremor upon awakening that becomes noticeably less coarse within the first few minutes of wakefulness. 

In mild cases, ET can manifest as the inability to stop the tongue or hands from shaking, the ability to sing only in vibrato, and difficulty to do small precise tasks such as threading a needle. Even simple tasks like cutting in a straight line or using a ruler can range from difficult to impossible, depending on the severity of the condition. In disabling cases, ET can interfere with a person's ability to perform tasks of daily living, including feeding, dressing, and activities of personal hygiene.

People with ET can sometimes have problems with word finding and can't articulate themselves effectively even with preparation. A person with ET may become shy, withdrawn, pessimistic, anxious and also have difficulties concentrating. It is common for those with ET to be embarrassed by the condition even though it is out of their control. 

ET is generally progressive in most cases (sometimes rapidly, sometimes very slowly), and can be disabling in severe cases.<ref>Critchley M. Observations on essential (heredofamilial) tremor. Brain. 1949;72:113-139.</ref><ref>Busenbark KL, Nash J, Nash S, Hubble JP, Koller WC. Is essential tremor benign? Neurology. December 1991;41(12):1982-1983.</ref><ref>Louis ED, Ford B, Barnes LF. Clinical subtypes of essential tremor. Arch Neurol 2000;57:1194-1198.</ref>

==Cause==
The underlying etiology is not clear but many cases seem to be familial.<ref>Deng H, Le W, Jankovic J. Genetics of essential tremor. Brain. June 2007;130(Pt 6):1456-1464.</ref> It has been estimated that approximately one-half of the cases are due to a genetic mutation and the pattern of inheritance is most consistent with autosomal dominant transmission. No genes have been identified yet but genetic linkage has been established with several chromosomal regions.<ref>Higgins JJ, Pho LT, Nee LE. A gene (ETM) for essential tremor maps to chromosome 2p22-p25. Mov Disord. 1997;12:859-864</ref><ref>Gulcher JR, Jonsson P, Kong A et al. Mapping of a familial essential tremor gene, FET1, to chromosome 3q13. Nature Genetics 1997;17:84-87.</ref> A number of environmental factors, including toxins, are also under active investigation and these may play a role in disease etiology.<ref>Louis ED. Etiology of essential tremor: Should we be searching for environmental causes? Mov Disord 2001;16:822-829.</ref> In terms of pathophysiology, clinical, physiological and imaging studies point to an involvement of the cerebellum and/or cerebellothalamocortical circuits.<ref>Louis ED, Vonsattel JP. The emerging neuropathology of essential tremor. Mov Disord 2007;23:174 - 182.</ref> Recent postmortem studies have demonstrated the presence of degenerative changes in the ET brain, with these changes including [[Purkinje cell]] axonal swellings and Purkinje cell loss in the majority of cases and brainstem [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]] in the remainder. These studies suggest that the disease is both heterogeneous and degenerative. In other words, ET might be a family of degenerative diseases rather than a single disease.<ref>Louis ED, Faust PL, Vonsattel JPG, Honig LS, Rajput A, Robinson CA, Rajput A, Pahwa R, Lyons KE, Ross W, Borden S, Moskowitz CB, Lawton A, Hernandez N. Neuropathological changes in essential tremor: 33 cases compared with 21 controls. Brain 2007;130:3297-3307.</ref><ref>Shill HA, Adler CH, Sabbagh MN, Connor DJ, Caviness JN, Hentz JG, Beach TG: Pathologic findings in prospectively ascertained essential tremor subjects. Neurology 2008;70:1452-1455.</ref>

However, emerging research based on brain autopsies of 50 deceased ET patients (as of December 2009), showed clear degenerative and pathological abnormalities, including "messy" neurofilaments which can impede nerve impulses. Research by Dr. Elan Louis and colleagues revealed that 80% of autopsied brains also exhibited changes within the cerebellum particularly to neurons that produce [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. Further analysis showed elevated levels of two neurotoxins, [[lead]] and [[harmane]], a heterocyclic amine. Heterocyclic amines (HCA) are chemicals found in some foods. Harmane has been detected in coffee and cigarettes (see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21776263), but is especially prevalent in meats that have been barbecued or exposed to high heat.

Another research<ref>{{cite journal|last=Louis|first=Elan D.|coauthors=Keating, Garrett A., Bogen, Kenneth T., Rios, Eileen, Pellegrino, Kathryn M., Factor-Litvak, Pam|title=Dietary Epidemiology of Essential Tremor: Meat Consumption and Meat Cooking Practices|journal=Neuroepidemiology|date=1 January 2008|volume=30|issue=3|pages=161–166|doi=10.1159/000122333|url=http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:130000|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> indicates there is a strong link between essential tremor in males and the amount of meat consumed, but the exact mechanism is yet unknown.

Changes in the cerebelleum could also be mediated by alcohol consumption. [[Purkinje cell]]s are especially susceptible to ethanol excitotoxicity.<ref name="pmid20721919">{{cite pmid| 20721919}}</ref> The impairment could lead to the abnormal cerebellar circuitry seen in essential tremor and suggests that alcohol may also work as an exacerbating agent in the pathology of this disease.

Chronic ethanol consumption results in a loss of Purkinje cell [[synapse]]s. However, these synapses are regained following a period of recovery that includes gradual weaning off of ethanol. Continued consumption of ethanol inhibits the recovery of synapses.<ref>{{cite pmid| 9105510}}</ref> This impairment of Purkinje synapses is a component of cerebellar degradation that could underlie essential tremor.<ref name="pmid20721919"/>

Chronic alcohol abuse has also been linked to other movement disorders such as [[myoclonus]], [[ataxia]], and [[dyskinesia]].<ref name="pmid20721919"/>

==Diagnosis==
Usually the diagnosis is established on clinical grounds. Tremors can start at any age, from [[childbirth|birth]] through advanced ages (senile tremor).<ref>Louis ED, Dure L, Pullman S. Essential tremor in childhood. Mov Disord 2001;16:921-923.</ref><ref>Bain PG, Findley LJ, Thompson PD, et al. A study of hereditary essential tremor. Brain. August 1994;117 ( Pt 4):805-824.</ref> Any voluntary muscle in the body may be affected, although the tremor is most commonly seen in the [[hands]] and [[arm]]s and slightly less commonly in the [[neck]] (causing the patient's head to shake), [[tongue]], and legs. A resting tremor of the hands is sometimes present.<ref>Cohen O, Pullman S, Jurewicz E, Watner D, Louis ED. Rest tremor in essential tremor patients: Prevalence, clinical correlates, and electrophysiological characteristics. Arch Neurol 2003;60:405-410.</ref><ref>Rajput AH, Rozdilsky B, Ang L, Rajput A. Significance of Parkinsonian manifestations in essential tremor. Can J Neurol Sci 1993;20:114-117.</ref> Tremor occurring in the legs might be diagnosable as Orthostatic Tremor. 

ET does sometimes occur in combination with other neurological disorders such as [[dystonia]]. In addition, there may be a link between ET and [[Parkinson's disease]], with one study showing ET patients having an approximately 4 times greater likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Minen M, Louis ED|title=Emergence of Parkinson’s disease in essential tremor: A study of the clinical correlates in 53 patients|journal=Mov Disord|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1602–1605|year=2008|pmid=18618664|pmc=2683412|doi=10.1002/mds.22161}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1353-8020(02)00057-3|author=Yahr MD, Orosz D, Purohit DP.|title=Co-occurrence of essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease: a clinical study of a large kindred with autopsy findings.|journal=Parkinsonism Relat Disord|year=2003|volume=9|issue=4|pages=225–231|pmid=12618058}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal
|author=Benito-Leon J, Louis ED, Permejo-Pareja F.|title=Risk of incident Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism in essential tremor: a population-based study.|journal=J Neurology Neurosurgery Psychiatry|year=2009|month=April|volume=80|issue=4|pages=423–5|pmid=19289477|doi=10.1136/jnnp.2008.147223}}</ref>  Essential tremor also tends to co-occur with Orthostatic Tremor.

==Treatment==
There is no recognised cure for essential tremor. Many of the treatments available are to lower the severity of the condition. These may include:

===Medication===
The two most recommended medications are: the [[beta-blocker]]s [[propranolol]] and the [[antiepileptic]] [[primidone]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zesiewicz|first=TA|coauthors=Elble, RJ, Louis, ED, Gronseth, GS, Ondo, WG, Dewey RB, Jr, Okun, MS, Sullivan, KL, Weiner, WJ|title=Evidence-based guideline update: treatment of essential tremor: report of the Quality Standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.|journal=Neurology|date=2011-11-08|volume=77|issue=19|pages=1752–5|pmid=22013182|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e318236f0fd}}</ref>

Self-medication with small amounts of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] has been shown to give short term relief from tremor,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lou JS, Jankovic J |title=Essential tremor: clinical correlates in 350 patients |journal=Neurology |volume=41 |issue=2 ( Pt 1) |pages=234–8 |year=1991 |month=February |pmid=1992367 |doi= |url=}}</ref> although this form of self-medication is not recommended due to an increased risk of alcohol dependence or abuse.<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000762.htm</ref> However other alcohol groups such as 1-octanol are being researched to provide relief from essential tremor without providing the intoxication or toxicity that ethanol does.<ref>http://neurology.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2004/923/1</ref>

[[Gabapentin]] may be helpful in the treatment of essential tremor.<ref>http://www.uwo.ca/cns/ebn/PDFCATs/move-tremor-gabapentin-therapy.pdf</ref>

A trial of the benzodiazepine-anticonvulsant [[Clonazepam]] (Klonopin, Rivotril) was found not to be an effective treatment;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thompson C, Lang A, Parkes JD, Marsden CD |title=A double-blind trial of clonazepam in benign essential tremor |journal=Clin Neuropharmacol |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=83–8 |year=1984 |pmid=6367975 |doi= 10.1097/00002826-198403000-00004|url=}}</ref> however, it is still recommended in some cases.<ref>http://www.aafp.org/afp/20051101/practice.html</ref>

[[Topiramate]] has also been cited as a possible pharmaceutical treatment.

===Other===

[[Memantine]] is a drug that is currently being researched for its potential ameliorative effects on essential tremor. Memantine is not as potent as ethanol at decreasing tremor intensity or locomotion. However, memantine exhibits neuroprotective effects. Memantine treatment results in a significantly higher reduction in [[caspase-3]] positive neurons.<ref name="pmid21640732">{{cite pmid| 21640732 }}</ref> 

[[Surgery|Surgical]] treatments (which are generally reserved for the most severe cases) include [[thalamotomy]] and [[deep brain stimulation]].<ref>Zesiewcz TA, Elble R, Louis ED, Hauser RA, Sullivan KL, Dewey RB, Ondo WG, Gronseth GS, Weiner WJ. Practice parameter: Therapies for essential tremor. Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology. Neurology 2005;64:2008-2020.</ref><ref>Schuurman PR, Bosch DA, Bossuyt PM, et al. A comparison of continuous thalamic stimulation and thalamotomy for suppression of severe tremor. N Engl J Med. February 17, 2000;342(7):461-468.</ref><ref>Rana A.Q. An Introduction to Essential Tremor.iUniverse, Bloomington, IN 2010.</ref> 

Minor cases of ET can be treated with physical therapy and development of the muscles in the sections of the body that are severe in their shaking.

Mild cases of ET which are not affecting activities of daily life may not require any  treatment. Use of wrist weights and avoiding triggers such as caffeine may be helpful.

===Support groups===
The International Essential Tremor Foundation (IETF) provides information, services and support to individuals and families affected by essential tremor (ET).<ref>[http://www.essentialtremor.org/ International Essential Tremor Foundation]</ref> The organization encourages and promotes research in an effort to determine the causes, treatment and ultimately the cure for ET. The IETF is a worldwide organization dedicated to meeting the needs of those whose daily lives are challenged by ET. IETF, an international non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that derives its support entirely from its membership and the general public, was founded in 1988 and is guided by a board of directors and a medical advisory council. The organization's membership consists of patients, physicians, educators, parents, relatives and volunteers who provide education, community services and funding to help support tremor research.

The National Tremor Foundation (NTF), founded in 1992, is a British friendly organisation based in Essex, England, an affiliate of the International Tremor Foundation, which was founded in 1988.<ref>[http://www.tremor.org.uk/ National Tremor Foundation]</ref> The organisation's primary work is production of a quarterly informational newsletter. The NTF also maintains a list of ITF medical advisors, and facilitates the formation of self-help groups. NTF was granted charitable status in 1994.

==Research==

===Harmaline-induced tremor===
[[Harmaline]] is a widely used model of essential tremor (ET) in rodents.<ref name="pmid17366267">{{cite pmid| 17366267 }}</ref> [[Harmaline]] is thought to act primarily on neurons in the [[inferior olivary nucleus|inferior olive]](IO). Olivocerebellar neurons exhibit rhythmic excitatory action when [[harmaline]] is applied locally.<ref name="pmid17366267"/> Additionally, when harmaline is administered to [[lesion]]ed IOs, little to no tremors are observed, reinforcing harmalines’ specificity for inferior olive connections.<ref name="pmid2542888">{{cite pmid| 2542888 }}</ref> The treatment of harmaline results in higher levels of [[caspase-3]] immunoreactivity in Purkinje, granule and inferior olive cells, suggestive of harmaline-mediated [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid21640732"/> [[Harmaline]] also increases the concentration of [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] in cerebellar nuclei which disrupts normal [[N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid|NMDA]]-mediated down-regulation of glutamate release.<ref name="pimd18445025">{{cite pmid| 18445025}}</ref> Together, these interferences likely give rise to essential-tremor like behavior that is likely a result of diseregulation of glutamatergic circuitry within the [[cerebellum]].<ref name="pimd18445025"/>

====Ethanol mechanisms====
[[Ethanol]] is effective at decreasing tremor intensity and locomotion.<ref name="pmid21640732"/> Ethanol-mediated effects are not observed on tremor frequency and peak location.<ref name="pmid21640732"/> Additionally, ethanol is able to reduce [[caspase-3]] induced apoptosis though not without an increased loss of [[neuron]]s in the [[cerebellum]] and olivary nucleus.<ref name="pmid21640732"/> Ethanol has been shown to decrease levels of glutamate in the cerebellar nuclei which had been pre-treated with [[harmaline]].<ref name="pimd18445025"/> Furthermore, ethanol directly reduces hyperactivity of the [[climbing fiber]]-Purknije cell synapse by acting on glutamatergic receptors.<ref>{{cite pmid| 16481422}}</ref> Ethanol may reduce tremor by dampening the overexcitation of [[glutamate receptor|glutamatergic]] pathways involving deep cerebellar nuclei which may also reduce levels of [[caspase-3]] induced [[apoptosis]].

====Octanol mechanism====
Different alcohols exert similar ameliorative effects on [[harmaline]]-induced tremors, though to different degrees. Different [[isomer]]s of [[octanol]] vary in efficacy when it comes to antagonizing harmaline-mediated tremors. These effects are likely mediated in the inferior olive, specifically at low-threshold calcium channels (LTCC) which have been shown to modulate the rhythmic firing of cells in this area.<ref>{{cite pmid| 7310722 }}</ref> [[Octanol]], specifically by binding to LTCCs of IOs, behaves in an antagonistic fashion on the spike discharges from Purkinje cells. The most potent isomers: (+)2-octanol, (-)2-octanol and 4-octanol, followed by 4-octanol, and lastly, 1-octanol.<ref name="pmid2542888"/> Both the magnitude and duration of the tremor are dependent on the octanol isomer. Differences in solubility does not appear to account for the disparity between isomers.<ref name="pmid2542888"/>
The first clinical trial of 1-Octanol in essential tremor was first conducted by Bushara etal and published in 2002, 2004. This showed the safety of 1-octanol and its efficacy in reducing tremor in patients diagnosed with essential tremor.<ref>Bushara KO, Goldstein SR, Grimes GJ, Jr., Burstein AH, Hallett M. Pilot trial of 1-octanol in essential tremor. Neurology 2004;62(1):122-124</ref><ref>{{cite pmid| 14718713 }}</ref>

===Genetically-induced tremor===
Genetic animal models of essential tremor utilize [[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] α1 -/- mice because of the major role [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] plays in inhibiting motor activity. Moreover, GABAA receptor α1 -/- mice produce essential-like tremors and motor impairment as seen in ET patients.<ref name="pmid15765150">{{cite pmid| 15765150}}</ref>

====Ethanol mechanisms====
Alcohol is implicated as a therapeutic agent for [[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] α1 -/- mice because of its interaction with Purkinje cells which mediate their actions via [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] transmission.<ref name="pmid17366267"/> [[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] α1 -/- mice respond positively to ethanol treatment. Ethanol reduces tremor activity in [[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] α1 -/- mice in a dose dependent manner. An optimum dose of 2.5 g/kg of ethanol completely suppresses tremors in [[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] α1 -/- mice.<ref name="pmid15765150"/> Purkinje cells in these knockout mice also exhibit a lack of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in response to both exogenous and endogenous [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]]. The loss of GABAergic inhibition in purkinje cells likely underlies the pathological tremors observed.<ref name="pmid15765150"/> These ameliorative effects are thought to involve inhibition of glutamatergic transmission, though the numerous targets of ethanol make it difficult to determine the exact underlying mechanism.<ref name="pmid15765150"/>
