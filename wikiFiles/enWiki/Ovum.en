An '''ovum''' (plural '''ova''', from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:en:ovum#Latin|ovum]]'' meaning [[egg (biology)|egg]] or [[egg (biology)|egg cell]]) is a [[haploid]] [[female]] reproductive cell or [[gamete]]. Both [[animal]]s and [[embryophyte]]s have ova. The term '''ovule''' is used for the young ovum of an animal, as well as the plant structure that carries the female [[gametophyte]] and egg cell and develops into a seed after [[fertilization]]. In [[Non-vascular plant|lower plants]] and [[algae]], the ovum is also often called '''oosphere'''.

==Ova production==
In higher animals, ova are produced by female [[gonad]]s (sexual glands) called [[ovary|ovaries]] and all of them are present at birth in [[mammal]]s and mature via [[oogenesis]].

===Human and mammal ova===
[[File:Sperm-egg.jpg|right|thumb|Ovum and sperm fusing together]]
[[File:Acrosome reaction diagram en.svg|thumb|The process of fertilizing an ovum (Top to bottom)]]
In the [[viviparous]] animals (which include [[human]]s and all other [[Eutheria|placental mammal]]s), the ovum is fertilized inside the female body.

The human ova grow from primitive germ cells that are embedded in the substance of the [[ovary|ovaries]]. Each of them divides repeatedly to give rise to several smaller cells, the [[oogonia]]. The oogonia then develop via [[meiosis]] into the ova, the primary [[oocytes]], and the [[polar bodies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/anatomy/the_ovum.html |title=The Ovum in Gray's Anatomy |work= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}.</ref>

Once the ovum has been fertilized, it begins to divide over the course of a few hours or days, becoming a [[morula]]. The morula enters the [[uterine cavity]] where it is immersed in the secretions of the uterine glands, ultimately forming a [[blastocyst]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Regan, Carmen L.|chapter=Pregnancy|editor=Worell, Judith|title=Encyclopedia of Women and Gender: Sex Similarities and Differences and the Impact of Society on Gender, Volume 1|publisher=Academic Press|year=2001|isbn=9780122272455|page=859|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7SXhBdqejgYC&pg=PA859}}</ref>

The ovum is one of the largest [[biological cell|cells]] in the human body, typically visible to the naked eye without the aid of a [[microscope]] or other magnification device. The human ovum measures approximately 0.12&nbsp;mm in diameter.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=ca51dWOR8nIC&pg=RA5-PA8-IA2&dq=ovum+120+micrometers&hl=en&ei=sXtjTI6_D4OC8gbZ6rCeCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=120%20micrometers&f=false Search result of "120 micrometers" in ''Level O Biology'' - Google books]</ref>

===Protist and plant ova===
{{see also|Gametophyte}}
In [[protist]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]] and many plants, such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, and [[gymnosperm]]s, ova are produced inside [[Archegonium|archegonia]]. Since the archegonium is a haploid structure, egg cells are produced via [[mitosis]]. The typical bryophyte archegonium consists of a long neck with a wider base containing the egg cell. Upon maturation, the neck opens to allow [[sperm cells]] to swim into the archegonium and fertilize the egg. The resulting zygote then gives rise to an embryo, which will grow out of the archegonium as a young [[sporophyte]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In the [[flowering plant]]s, the female gametophyte, which usually gives rise to the archegonium, has been reduced to just eight cells referred to as the [[embryo sac]] inside the [[ovule]]. The gametophyte cell closest to the [[micropyle]] opening of the embryo sac develops into the egg cell. Upon [[pollination]], a pollen tube delivers sperm into the embryo sac and one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo inside the ovule. The ovule in turn develops into a [[seed]] and in many cases the [[Ovary (plants)|plant ovary]] develops into a [[fruit]] to facilitate the [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] of the seeds. Upon [[germination]], the embryo grows into a [[seedling]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Ooplasm==
Ooplasm (also: o√∂plasm) is the [[yolk]] of the ovum, a cell substance at its center, which contains its [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], named the [[germinal vesicle]], and the [[nucleolus]], called the [[germinal spot]].<ref name=ooplasm>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/anatomy/the_ovum.html |title=The Ovum
 |work=Gray's Anatomy |accessdate=2010-10-18}}</ref>

The ooplasm consists of the [[cytoplasm]] of the ordinary animal cell with its [[spongioplasm]] and [[hyaloplasm]], often called the ''formative yolk''; and the ''nutritive yolk'' or ''deutoplasm'', made of rounded granules of fatty and [[albumin]]oid substances imbedded in the cytoplasm.<ref name=ooplasm>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/anatomy/the_ovum.html |title=The Ovum
 |work=Gray's Anatomy |accessdate=2010-10-17}}</ref>

[[Mammal]]ian ova contain only a tiny amount of the nutritive yolk, for nourishing the [[embryo]] in the early stages of its development only. In contrast, bird eggs contain enough to supply the chick with nutriment throughout the whole period of incubation.<ref name="ooplasm"/>

==Ova development in oviparous animals==
In the [[oviparous]] animals (all [[bird]]s, most [[fish]]es, [[amphibia]]ns and [[reptile]]s) the ova develop protective layers and pass through the [[oviduct]] to the outside of the body. They are fertilized by male sperm either inside the female body (as in birds), or outside (as in many fishes). After fertilization, an embryo develops, nourished by nutrients contained in the egg. It then hatches from the egg, outside the mother's body. See [[egg (biology)]] for a discussion of eggs of oviparous animals.

The egg cell's [[cytoplasm]] and [[mitochondria]] (and [[chloroplast]]s in plants) are the sole means the egg is able to reproduce by mitosis and eventually form a [[blastocyst]] after fertilization.

==Ovoviviparity==
There is an intermediate form, the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] animals: the embryo develops within and is nourished by an egg as in the oviparous case, but then it hatches inside the mother's body shortly before birth, or just after the egg leaves the mother's body. Some fish, reptiles and many [[invertebrate]]s use this technique.
