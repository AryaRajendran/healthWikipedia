Dandruff is a common scalp disorder affecting almost half of the population at the post-pubertal age and of any gender and ethnicity. It often causes itching. It has been well established that [[keratinocytes]] play a key role in the expression and generation of immunological reactions during dandruff formation. The severity of dandruff may fluctuate with season as it often worsens in winter.<ref name="Ranganathan"/> Most cases of dandruff can be easily treated with specialized [[Dandruff shampoo|shampoos]]. There is, however, no true cure.

Those affected by dandruff find that it can cause social or self-esteem problems, indicating treatment for both psychological and physiological reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/jidsp/journal/v12/n2/abs/5650048a.html |title=A Practical Guide to Scalp Disorders |publisher=''Journal of Investigative Dermatology Symposium Proceedings'' |date=2007-12 |accessdate=2009-02-06}}</ref>

== Causes ==
As the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] layer continually replaces itself, cells are pushed outward where they eventually die and flake off.  For most individuals, these flakes of skin are too small to be visible.  However, certain conditions cause cell turnover to be unusually rapid, especially in the scalp. For people with dandruff, skin cells may mature and be shed in 2–7 days, as opposed to around a month in people without dandruff.  The result is that dead skin cells are shed in large, oily clumps, which appear as white or grayish patches on the scalp, skin and clothes.

Dandruff has been shown to be the result of three required factors:<ref>{{cite journal |author=DeAngelis YM, Gemmer CM, Kaczvinsky JR, Kenneally DC, Schwartz JR, Dawson TL |title=Three etiologic facets of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis: Malassezia fungi, sebaceous lipids, and individual sensitivity |journal=J.

# Individual susceptibility

Older literature cites the [[fungus]] ''[[Malassezia furfur]]'' (previously known as ''Pityrosporum ovale'') as the cause of dandruff.  While this species does occur naturally on the skin surface of both healthy people and those with dandruff, in 2007 it was discovered that the responsible agent is a scalp specific fungus, ''[[Malassezia]] globosa'',<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7080434.stm | work=BBC News | title=Genetic code of dandruff cracked | date=2007-11-06 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> that metabolizes [[triglycerides]] present in sebum by the expression of lipase, resulting in a lipid byproduct [[oleic acid]] (OA). During dandruff, the levels of ''Malassezia'' increase by 1.5 to 2 times its normal level.<ref name="Ranganathan"/> Penetration by OA of the top layer of the epidermis, the [[stratum corneum]], results in an inflammatory response in susceptible persons which disturbs [[homeostasis]] and results in erratic cleavage of stratum corneum cells.<ref name="deangelis"/>

Dandruff can also be a manifestation of an allergic reaction to chemicals in hair gels, sprays, and shampoos, hair oils, or sometimes even dandruff medications like [[ketoconazole]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

There is some evidence that excessive [[perspiration]] and climate have significant roles in the pathogenesis of dandruff.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

== Composition ==
Dandruff scale is a cluster of corneocytes, which have retained a large degree of cohesion with one another and detach as such from the surface of the stratum corneum. The size and abundance of scales are heterogeneous from one site to another and over time. [[Parakeratosis|Parakeratotic]] cells often make up part of dandruff. Their numbers are related to the severity of the clinical manifestations, which may also be influenced by seborrhea.<ref name="Ranganathan"/>

== Treatment ==
Shampoos use a combination of ingredients to control dandruff. The pathogenesis of dandruff involves hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, resulting in deregulation of keratinization. The corneocytes clump together, manifesting as large flakes of skin. Essentially, keratolytic agents such as salicylic acid and sulphur loosen the attachments between the corneocytes and allow them to get swiped off.

=== Regulators of keratinization ===
[[Zinc pyrithione]] (ZPT) heals the scalp by normalizing the epithelial keratinization or sebum production or both. Some studies have shown a significant reduction in the number of yeasts after use of ZPT, which is an antifungal and antibacterial agent.<ref>Markes R, Pearse A. The effect of a shampoo containing zinc phrithione in the control of dandruff. ''J Dermatol'' 1985;112:415-22.</ref> A study by Warner ''et al.''<ref>Warner RR, Schwartz JR, Boissy Y, Dawson TL Jr. Dandruff has an altered stratum corneum ultrastructure that is improved with zinc phrithione shampoo. ''J Am Acad Dermatol'' 2001;45:897-903.</ref> demonstrates a dramatic reduction of structural abnormalities found in dandruff with the use of ZPT; the population abundance of Malassezia decreases, parakeratosis gets eliminated and corneocytes lipid inclusions are diminished.<ref name="Ranganathan"/>

=== Steroids ===
The parakeratotic properties of topical corticosteroids depend on the structure of the agent, the vehicle and the skin onto which it is used. Corticosteroids work via their anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects.<ref>Sawleshwakar SN, Salgonkar V, Obrai C. Multi centre, open-label, non-comparative study of a combination of polytar and zinc pyrithione shampoo in the management of dandruff. ''Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol'' 2004;7:25-8.</ref>

=== Selenium sulfide ===
It is believed that [[selenium sulfide]] controls dandruff via its anti ''[[Malassezia]]'' effect rather than by its antiproliferative effect, although it has an effect in reducing cell turnover. It has anti-[[seborrheic]] properties as well as cytostatic effect on cells of the epidermal and follicular [[epithelium]]. The excessive oiliness after use of this agent has been reported in many patients as adverse drug effect.<ref name="Ranganathan" />

=== Coal Tar ===
[[Coal tar]] is a [[keratoplastic]] causing the skin to shed dead cells from the top layer and slow skin cell growth.<ref>WebMD: ''Anti-Dandruff (coal tar)'' [http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-151769-Anti-Dandruff+coal+tar+Top.aspx?drugid=151769&drugname=Anti-Dandruff+(coal+tar)+Top]</ref>

=== Imidazole antifungal agents ===
Imidazole topical antifungals such as ketoconazole act by blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, the primary sterol derivative of the fungal cell membrane. Changes in membrane permeability caused by ergosterol depletion are incompatible with fungal growth and survival.<ref>Shuster S. The etiology of dandruff and the mode of action of therapeutic agents. ''Br J Dermatol'' 1984;3:235-42.</ref>

Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum, antimycotic agent that is active against both Candida and M. furfur. Of all the imidazoles, ketoconazole has become the leading contender among treatment options because of its effectiveness in treating seborrheic dermatitis as well.<ref name="Ranganathan"/>

=== Hydroxypyridones ===
In contrast to the imidazole antifungals, the hydroxypyridones do not affect sterol biosynthesis; instead they interfere with the active transport of essential macromolecule precursor, cell membrane integrity and the respiratory process of cells. Ciclopirox is widely used as an anti-dandruff agent in most preparations.<ref>Milani M, Antonio Di Molfetta S, Gramazio R, Fiorella C, Frisario C, Fuzio E, Efficacy of betamethasone valerate 0.1% thermophobic foam in seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. An open label, multicentre prospective trial on 180 patients. ''Curr Med Res Opin'' 2003;19:342-5.</ref>

=== Neem ===
[[Neem]] has anti-fungal properties that can be effective in treating dandruff.<ref>E-International Scientific Research Journal: Antifungal Properties of Neem (Azardirachta 
Indica) Leaves Extract to treat Hair Dandruff [http://www.eisrjc.com/documents/Antifungal_Properties_Of_Neem_1325930110.pdf]</ref>

=== Black Pepper ===
Black pepper contains the dandruff fighting minerals zinc and selenium. In Indian traditional Ayurveda, powdered black pepper has been used to treat dandruff.

=== Egg oil ===

== Seborrhoeic dermatitis ==
{{Main|Seborrhoeic dermatitis}}
Specific diagnosis and treatment of dandruff may be difficult as its spectrum blurs with those of seborrhoeic dermatitis and some other scaly.  In seborrhoeic dermatitis redness and itching frequently occurs around the folds of the nose and eyebrow areas, not just the scalp.  Dry, thick, well-defined lesions consisting of large, silvery scales may be traced to the less common affliction of the scalp [[psoriasis]].

Inflammation and extension of scaling outside the scalp exclude the diagnosis of dandruff from seborrhoeic dermatitis.<ref name="pmid16382662"/> However, many reports suggest a clear link between the two clinical entities - the mildest form of the clinical presentation of seborrhoeic dermatitis as dandruff, where the inflammation is minimal and remain subclinical.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pierard-Franchimont C, Hermanns JF, Degreef H, Pierard GE |title=Revisiting dandruff |journal=Int J Cosmet Sci |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=311–318 |year=2006 |pmid=18489295 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00326.x}}</ref><ref>Pierard-Franchimont C, Hermanns JF, Degreef H, Pierard GE. From axioms to new insights into dandruff. ''Dermatology'' 2000;200:93-8.</ref>

Seasonal changes, stress, and immuno-suppression seem to affect seborrheic dermatitis.<ref name="Ranganathan"/>
