The '''endometrium''' is the inner [[mucous membrane]] of the [[mammalian]] [[uterus]].

==Function==
The endometrium is the innermost glandular layer and functions as a lining for the uterus, preventing adhesions between the opposed walls of the [[myometrium]], thereby maintaining the [[wikt:patency|patency]] of the [[uterine]] cavity. During the [[menstrual cycle]] or [[estrous cycle]], the endometrium grows to a thick, blood vessel-rich, glandular tissue layer. This represents an optimal environment for the [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of a [[blastocyst]] upon its arrival in the uterus. The endometrium is central, echogenic (detectable using ultrasound scanners), and has an average thickness of 6.7&nbsp;mm.

During  [[pregnancy]], the glands and [[blood vessel]]s in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the [[placenta]], which supplies [[oxygen]] and nutrition to the [[embryo]] and [[foetus]].

==Cycle==
The endometrial lining undergoes cyclic regeneration. Humans and the [[great apes]] display the [[menstrual cycle]], whereas most other mammals are subject to an [[estrous cycle]].  In both cases, the endometrium initially proliferates under the influence of [[estrogen]]. However, once [[ovulation]] occurs, in addition to estrogen, the ovary will also start to produce [[progesterone]].  This changes the proliferative pattern of the endometrium to a secretory lining. Eventually, the secretory lining provides a hospitable environment for one or more blastocysts. If a blastocyst implants, then the lining remains as ''[[decidua]]''. The decidua becomes part of the placenta; it provides support and protection for the gestation.

If there is inadequate stimulation of the lining, due to lack of hormones, the endometrium remains thin and inactive. In humans, this will result in [[amenorrhea]], or the absence of a menstrual period. After [[menopause]], the lining is often described as being atrophic.  In contrast, endometrium that is chronically exposed to estrogens, but not to progesterone, may become [[hyperplastic]]. Long-term use of [[oral contraceptives]] with highly potent progestins can also induce endometrial [[atrophy]].<ref>Effects of hormone therapy on the endometrium, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8426860</ref><ref>William's Gynecology, McGraw 2008, Chapter 8, Abnormal Uterine Bleeding</ref>

In humans, the cycle of building and shedding the endometrial lining lasts an average of 28 days. The endometrium develops at different rates in different mammals. Its formation is sometimes affected by seasons, climate, stress, and other factors. The endometrium itself produces certain [[hormone]]s at different points along the cycle. This affects other portions of the [[reproductive system]].

==Histology==

The endometrium consists of a single layer of [[columnar epithelium]] resting on the [[Stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]], a layer of [[connective tissue]] that varies in thickness according to [[hormonal]] influences. Simple tubular uterine [[glands]] reach from the endometrial surface through to the base of the stroma, which also carries a rich blood supply of [[spiral artery|spiral arteries]]. In a woman of reproductive age, two layers of endometrium can be distinguished. These two layers occur only in endometrium lining the cavity of the uterus, not in the lining of the Fallopian tubes:<ref>Blue Histology - Female Reproductive System.

* The ''functional layer'' is adjacent to the uterine cavity. This layer is built up after the end of menstruation during the first part of the previous [[menstrual cycle]]. Proliferation is induced by [[estrogen]] (follicular phase of menstrual cycle), and later changes in this layer are engendered by  progestrone from the [[corpus luteum]] (luteal phase). It is adapted to provide an optimum environment for the implantation and growth of the [[embryo]]. This layer is completely shed during [[menstruation]].
* The ''basal layer'', adjacent to the [[myometrium]] and below the functional layer, is not shed at any time during the menstrual cycle, and from it the functional layer develops.
In the absence of progesterone, the arteries supplying blood to the functional layer constrict, so that cells in that layer become [[ischaemic]] and die, leading to [[menstruation]].

It is possible to identify the phase of the menstrual cycle by observing histological differences at each phase:

{| class="wikitable"
! Phase !! Days !! Thickness !! Epithelium
 |-
 | Menstrual phase || 1–4 || Thin || Absent
 |-
 | [[Follicular phase|Proliferative phase]] || 4–14 || Intermediate || Columnar
 |-
 | [[Secretory phase]] || 15–28 || Thick || Columnar. Also visible are [[helicine branches of uterine artery]]

[[Chorionic tissue]] can result in marked endometrial changes, known as an [[Arias-Stella reaction]], that have an appearance similar to [[cancer]].<ref name=pmid11756756>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arias-Stella | first1 = J. | title = The Arias-Stella reaction: facts and fancies four decades after. | journal = Adv Anat Pathol | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 | month = Jan | year = 2002 | doi =  | PMID = 11756756 }}</ref>  Historically, this change was diagnosed as [[endometrial cancer]] and it is important only in so far as it should not be misdiagnosed as cancer.

==Pathological conditions ==
[[Adenomyosis]] is the growth of the endometrium into the muscle layer of the uterus (the [[myometrium]]).

[[Endometriosis]] is the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus.

[[Endometrial cancer]] is the most common [[cancer]] of the human female genital tract.

[[Asherman's syndrome]], also known as intrauterine [[adhesions]] occurs when the basal layer of the endometrium is damaged by instrumentation (e.g., [[Dilation and curettage|D&C]]) or infection (e.g., endometrial [[tuberculosis]]) resulting in endometrial sclerosis and adhesion formation partially or completely obliterating the uterine cavity.

''Thin endometrium'' may be defined as an endometrial thickness of less than 8&nbsp;mm. It usually occurs after [[menopause]]. Treatments that can improve endometrial thickness include [[Vitamin E]], [[L-arginine]] and [[sildenafil citrate]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Takasaki A, Tamura H, Miwa I, Taketani T, Shimamura K, Sugino N |title=Endometrial growth and uterine blood flow: a pilot study for improving endometrial thickness in the patients with a thin endometrium |journal=Fertil.

[[Gene expression profiling]] using [[cDNA microarray]] can be used for the diagnosis of endometrial disorders.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.01.130}}</ref>
