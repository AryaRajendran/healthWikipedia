'''Implantable collamer lens''' or '''ICL''', called by its manufacturer '''[http://www.visianinfo.com Visian ICL]''', is a soft, flexible gel-lens used in [[refractive surgery|refractive surgeries]] for the permanent correction of [[myopia]] (nearsightedness), made of a collagen copolymer material, named by combining "collagen" and "polymer".<ref>[http://visianinfo.com/about-visian-icl/collamer-advanced-lens-material/ VisianICL: Collamer: Advanced Lens Material]</ref> The ICL procedure is a popular alternative to [[LASIK]] and [[PRK]] since it requires no removal of the corneal tissue and reportedly produces better visual results.<ref name="ICL implantation hits 300,000 mark">{{cite news|first=Staff Reports|title=ICL implantation hits 300,000 mark|url=http://www.modernmedicine.com/modernmedicine/ModernMedicine+Now/ICL-implantation-hits-300000-mark/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/771230?contextCategoryId=40212|accessdate=June 25, 2012|newspaper=Modern Medicine|date=May 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=pmid12792475>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00003226-200305000-00009 |title=Comparison of Implantable Contact Lens and Laser Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis for Moderate to High Myopia |year=2003 |last1=Sanders |first1=Donald R. |last2=Vukich |first2=John A. |journal=Cornea |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=324–31 |pmid=12792475}}</ref>

The ICL procedure is a type of [[refractive surgery]] performed by an [[ophthalmologists]] in which the ICL is surgically implanted inside the eye, where it resides permanently. The ICL requires no maintenance after the procedure and functions very similarly to [[contact lenses]] in improving [[visual acuity]].<ref name="pmid12792475"/> For most patients, ICL provides permanent freedom from [[eyeglasses]] or [[contact lenses]].

==History==

[[File:Strampelli Barrequer.jpg|thumb|right|Fathers of the phakic intraocular lens. Choyce, Strampelli, and Barraquer]]
In 1953, Italian surgeon [[:it:Benedetto Strampelli|Benedetto Strampelli]] became the first to successfully implant a phakic IOL in the anterior chamber of the eye for the correction of myopia.<ref>{{cite web|title=1950-1960|url=http://www.rayner.com/history/1950-1960|work=Rayner IOL History|publisher=Rayner|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref> That first pIOL was manufactured by the [[Rayner (company)|Rayner]] company of Brighton, East Sussex, England from [[Perspex CQ]] [[Polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) made by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Birth of the IOL|url=http://www.rayner.com/history/1949|work=Rayner|publisher=Rayner|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>  The acrylic plastic material was chosen because Harold Ridley noticed that it was inert, after seeing RAF (Royal Air Force) pilots of World War II with pieces of shattered canopies in their eyes (this acrylic resin is known by several trade names including [[Lucite]] and [[Plexiglas]]). In 1959, Dr. [http://www.barraquer.com/ Joachin Barracher] reported the results of 239 implantations. However, the complications in these clinical trials necessitated explantation for many cases due to problems such as chronic loss of corneal endothelial cells, iris retraction and atrophy, peripheral anterior synechiae and pupil ovalization.<ref name=pmid21029908>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2010.08.014 |title=Phakic intraocular lenses |year=2010 |last1=Güell |first1=Jose Luis |last2=Morral |first2=Merce |last3=Kook |first3=Daniel |last4=Kohnen |first4=Thomas |journal=Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1976}}</ref> By the 1980s, many PMMA [[PIOLs|angle-supported]] anterior chamber pIOLs were phased out of the market because of unacceptable complication rates and replaced with foldable models. Relevant designs include the ZB<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1911508 |year=1991 |last1=Mimouni |first1=F |last2=Colin |first2=J |last3=Koffi |first3=V |last4=Bonnet |first4=P |title=Damage to the corneal endothelium from anterior chamber intraocular lenses in phakic myopic eyes |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=277–81 |journal=Refractive & corneal surgery}}</ref> and the ZB5M<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9641419 |year=1998 |last1=Baikoff |first1=G |last2=Arne |first2=JL |last3=Bokobza |first3=Y |last4=Colin |first4=J |last5=George |first5=JL |last6=Lagoutte |first6=F |last7=Lesure |first7=P |last8=Montard |first8=M |last9=Saragoussi |first9=JJ |title=Angle-fixated anterior chamber phakic intraocular lens for myopia of -7 to -19 diopters |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=282–93 |journal=Journal of refractive surgery}}</ref>  by the [[Domilens Corporation]] and the NuVita MA 20<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3572772 |year=1987 |last1=Apple |first1=DJ |last2=Brems |first2=RN |last3=Park |first3=RB |last4=Norman |first4=DK |last5=Hansen |first5=SO |last6=Tetz |first6=MR |last7=Richards |first7=SC |last8=Letchinger |first8=SD |title=Anterior chamber lenses. Part I: Complications and pathology and a review of designs |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=157–74 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref>  by [[Bausch and Lomb]]. Foldable models allow for the insertion of the pIOL through a smaller incision, thus reducing the probability of surgically induced astigmatism. Complications arising from anterior chamber angle-supported pIOLs has led to movement toward the posterior chamber. The rationale was based on the theory that there would be a greater distance between the pIOL and the corneal endothelium. This location would also theoretically reduce the incidence of halos and glare as margins of the pupil would cover the border of the optical zones.<ref name=pmid21029908/> In 1986, Fyodorov designed the first posterior chamber pIOL in the "collar-button" or "mushroom" configuration and manufactured the pIOL from silicone.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fyodorov |first1=SN |first2=VK |last2=Zuyev |first3=BM |last3=Aznabayev |title=Intraocular correction of high myopia with negative posterior chamber lens |journal=Oftalmokhirurgiia |year=1991 |volume=3 |pages=57–8}}</ref>  The most widely used posterior chamber pIOL is the [[Visian ICL]] V4, an implantable collamer lens manufactured by [[Staar Surgical Companies]]. The implantable collamer lenses, formerly known as Implantable Contact Lenses, were approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2005. The FDA requested that the term ''Implantable Contact Lenses'' be changed to avoid confusion with corneal contact lenses. By the 21st century, approximately 300,000 ICLs have been implanted in the United States.<ref name="ICL implantation hits 300,000 mark"/>

==Comparison to LASIK==

Another type of refractive surgery is [[LASIK]] or Lasik (laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) which changes the shape of the cornea permanently in order to improve visual acuity. The difference between LASIK and the ICL is the area of the eye that is changed in the surgery. LASIK operates on the cornea and the ICL inserts a lens in the posterior chamber of the eye which maintains the structure of the [[cornea]]. The ICL can be removed and replaced if vision changes substantially after the procedure.<ref name=pmid17598571>{{cite journal |pmid=17598571 |year=2007 |last1=Sanders |first1=DR |title=Matched population comparison of the Visian Implantable Collamer Lens and standard LASIK for myopia of -3.00 to -7.88 diopters |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=537–53 |journal=Journal of refractive surgery}}</ref> Also many cases of [[Keratoconus]] have been reported with Lasik, which is not possible with ICL. Similar types of phakic IOLs are available, such as ones made of the same type of plastic that has been used to make intraocular lenses for cataract surgery.<ref name=pmid21029908/> 

Insertion of an ICL for the treatment of high myopia is the most commonly performed eye [[surgical procedure]].<ref name=pmid15350323>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ophtha.2004.03.026 |title=United States Food and Drug Administration clinical trial of the Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) for moderate to high myopia |year=2004 |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=111 |issue=9 |pages=1683–92 |pmid=15350323 |last1=Sanders |first1=DR |last2=Doney |first2=K |last3=Poco |first3=M |author4=ICL in Treatment of Myopia Study Group}}</ref> The procedure is performed under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The flexibility of the ICL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the soft silicone tip of the micro incision injector through a very small incision (2.2mm) thus avoiding the need for stitches, and this procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist.Following the procedure, most people have immediate use of their eyes. The full recovery period is typically 1–2 days with minimal discomfort and most patients are able to go to work the next day. After surgery, the common advice is to avoid driving home and to visit the attending ophthalmologists regularly for several months so as to monitor the implants.

ICL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as the development of small cloudy areas of opacities on the crystalline lens which could occur if the lens is touched during the surgery,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18581781 |year=2008 |last1=Sanders |first1=DR |title=Anterior subcapsular opacities and cataracts 5 years after surgery in the visian implantable collamer lens FDA trial |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=566–70 |journal=Journal of refractive surgery}}</ref> increased rate of endothelial cell loss from the back surface of the cornea,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2003.09.047 |title=Corneal endothelial assessment after ICL implantation |year=2004 |last1=Edelhauser |first1=Henry F |last2=Sanders |first2=Donald R |last3=Azar |first3=Ramzy |last4=Lamielle |first4=Helene |last5=In Treatment Of Myopia Study Group |journal=Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=576}}</ref> and increased pressure inside of the eye. To minimize pressure in the eye post-op, drops are usually applied to the eye, or the creation of an additional peripheral iridotomy may be necessary to improve fluid flow. Additionally, short irritations include conjuntiva irritation, corneal swelling, infections, non-reactive pupil, and irritation of the iris.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0161-6420(03)00826-1 |title=Postoperative inflammation after implantation of the implantable contact lens |year=2003 |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=110 |issue=12 |pages=2335–41 |pmid=14644715 |last1=Sanders |first1=DR |author2=ICL in Treatment of Myopia Study Group}}</ref>  Usually these irritations are transient in nature. Despite these risk, a systematic review of studies has determined that the procedure is safer than conventional laser eye treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007679.pub3 |chapter=Excimer laser refractive surgery versus phakic intraocular lenses for the correction of moderate to high myopia |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2012 |last1=Barsam |first1=Allon |last2=Allan |first2=Bruce DS |editor1-last=Barsam |editor1-first=Allon |pmid=22258972 |volume=1 |pages=CD007679 |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)}}</ref>

== Definition of phakic, aphakic and pseudophakic IOLs == <!--Phakic redirects here-->
* ''Phakia'' is the presence of the natural crystalline lens. ICLs are lenses that are surgically placed in front of the natural crystalline lens. Thus the ICL and the natural lens work in conjunction for vision.
* [[Aphakia]] is the absence of the natural crystalline lens, either from natural causes or from removal.
* ''Pseudophakia'' is the substitution of the natural crystalline lens with a synthetic lens. Pseudophakic IOLs are used when cataracts have developed in the eye and the natural lens must be replaced with IOLs.

The root of these words comes from the Greek word ''phakos'' 'lens'.<ref name=yanoff>{{cite book |first1=Myron |last1=Yanoff |first2=Jay S. |last2=Duker |title=Ophthalmology |year=2009|publisher=Mosby Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-04332-8 |edition=3rd}}{{page needed|date=June 2012}}</ref>

==Design and materials used for implantable collamer lens==
ICLs consists of a small biocompatible [[intraocular lens]] (IOL), also known as a posterior chamber [[phakic intraocular lens]] (PIOLs), with distinct footplates, called [[haptics]], to hold the lens in place within the [[cilliary sulcus]] inside the eye and the anterior vault designed to minimize contact with the eye’s crystalline lens. ICLs are made of a flexible material proprietary hydrophilic porcine collagen (<0.1%) hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) termed Collamer for short.<ref name=pmid21029908/> This material attracts the natural deposition of a layer of fibronectin on the ICL surface that inhibits aqueous protein binding and makes the ICL invisible to the immune system.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9610441 |year=1998 |last1=Rosen |first1=E |last2=Gore |first2=C |title=Staar Collamer posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens to correct myopia and hyperopia |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=596–606 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref>  The Visian ICL V4 is a rectangular single-piece pIOL 7.5 to 8.0mm wide, available in 4 lengths. The optic diameter is between 4.65 to 5.5&nbsp;mm in myopic ICLs. The Visian ICL V4 was developed to address the issue of vaulting. A higher vault provides greater space between the ICL and crystalline lens to prevent contact between the two lenses and also allows for fluid change of nutrients. ICLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses used to correct moderate to high [[myopia]] from between -3 to -20 [[diopters]] for patients between the ages of 21-45.<ref name=pmid17598571/>

== Surgical procedure ==
[[File:Visian ICl Unfolding.jpg|thumb|left|Visian ICL Unfolding from Microinjector]]
Insertion of an ICL for the treatment of high myopia is the most commonly performed eye [[surgical procedure]].<ref name=pmid15350323/> The procedure is performed under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The flexibility of the ICL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the soft silicone tip of the micro incision injector through a very small incision (2.2mm) thus avoiding the need for stitches. Once injected, the ICL unfolds in the eye and the haptics are gently pushed under the iris with a blunt spatula. A peripheral [[iridectomy]] is performed to prevent pupillary block and finally the wound is hydrated. 
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Microinjector with ICL unfolding from the tip.jpg|thumb|right|Microinjector with ICL unfolding from the tip]] -->

This procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist.<ref name=pmid12792475/> 

Prior to the surgery, the ICL must be loaded into the microinjector cartridge. The lenses are  checked under an operating microscope to ensure correct anterior-posterior orientation before they are loaded into the injector with the dome side of the lens facing up to avoid damage to the haptic legs.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9641421 |year=1998 |last1=Davidorf |first1=JM |last2=Zaldivar |first2=R |last3=Oscherow |first3=S |title=Posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens for hyperopia of +4 to +11 diopters |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=306–11 |journal=Journal of refractive surgery}}</ref> 

Following the procedure, most people have immediate use of their eyes. The full recovery period is typically 1–2 days with minimal discomfort and most people are able to go to work the next day. After surgery, the common advice is to avoid driving home and to visit the attending ophthalmologists regularly for several months so as to monitor the implants.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Visian ICL|url=http://visianinfo.com/cwc/_premium/good_candidate.php?siteid=|work=The Visian ICL Candidate|publisher=Staar Surgical Companies|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

:*Are not good candidates for LASIK because they have thin corneas<ref name="FAQs" />

=== Contraindicators ===
A person is not a good candidate for phakic lenses if they:<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |title=Are phakic lenses for you? |url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/PhakicIntraocularLenses/ucm059238.htm |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref>
*Are under the age of 21. There are no FDA approved phakic lenses for persons under the age of 21.
*Have refractive instability. If the prescription of contacts or glasses continues to change yearly, this is an indication of refractive instability. Patients who are younger than 21 years of age, or whose hormones are fluctuating such as women who are pregnant or breastfeading, are more likely to have refractive instability and should discuss the possible additional risks with their doctor.
*Have a disease or are on medications that may affect wound healing. Certain conditions, such as autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), immunodeficiency states (e.g., HIV) and diabetes, and some medications (e.g., retinoic acid and steroids) may prevent proper healing after intraocular surgery.
*Have a high risk of eye trauma. A blow to the head or a hit in the eye may cause the eye to be susceptible to rupture.
*Have large pupils. If one's pupil dilates in low lighting conditions to a size that is larger than the size of the lens, one has a higher risk of experiencing visual disturbances after surgery that may affect one's ability to function comfortably or normally under such conditions (e.g., while driving at night).
*Have glaucoma
*Had eye injury or previous eye surgery.
*Have the need for visual correction outside the range for which the phakic lens has been approved.
*Are over the age of 45 years old. ICLs have not been studied in patients over the age of 45.
