{{main|Psychosurgery|Lobotomy}}
'''Johann Gottlieb Burckhardt''' (24 December 1836 - 6 February 1907) was a Swiss [[psychiatrist]] and the medical director of small mental hospital in the Swiss [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Neuchâtel]]. He is commonly regarded as having performed the first modern [[psychosurgery|psychosurgical]] operation. Born in [[Basel]], Switzerland, he trained as doctor at the Universities of [[University of Basel|Basel]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], receiving his medical doctorate in 1860. In the same year he took up a teaching post in the University of Basel and established a private practice in his hometown. He married in 1863 but the following year he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and gave up his practice and relocated to a region south of the Pyrennes in search of a cure. By 1866 he had made a full recovery and returned to Basel with the intention of devoting himself to the study of nervous diseases and their treatment. In 1875 he attained a post at the Waldau University Psychiatric Clinic in Bern and from 1876 he lectured on mental diseases at the [[University of Bern]]. Beginning in this period, he published widely on his psychiatric and neurological research findings in the medical press developing the thesis that mental illnesses had their origins in specific regions of the brain.

In 1882 he was appointed the medical director of a small, modern and privately run psychiatric clinic at Marin in the Swiss Canton of Neuchâtel where he was provided with a laboratory to continue his research. In 1888 he pioneered modern psychosurgery when he excised various brain regions from six psychiatric patients under his care. Aimed at relieving symptoms rather than effecting a cure, the theoretical basis of the procedure rested on his belief that psychiatric illnesses were the result of specific brain lesions. He reported the results at a Berlin medical conference in 1889 but the reception of his medical peers was decidedly negative and he was ridiculed. Burckhardt subsequently discontinued his research activities. Following the death of his wife in 1896 Burckhardt returned to Basel where he established a sanatorium in 1900. He died seven years later from pneumonia.

In 1866 Burckhardt returned to Basel and resolved to study the diseases of the [[nervous system]] and their treatment with the new [[electrotherapy|electrotherapies]].{{sfn|Stone|2001|p=80|ps=}} His interest in this field had been fostered by [[Karl Ewald Hasse]], a noted physician and friend of the Burckhardt family.{{sfn|Stone|2001|p=80|ps=}} In 1873 he was elected to the presidency of the Basel Medical Society.{{sfn|Stone|2001|p=80|ps=}} Two years later, in 1875, he received a post as a physician to the Waldau Psychiatric University Clinic in Berne;{{#tag:ref|There is confusion in the secondary sources as to whether Burckhardt took up this post in 1873 or 1875.

===Psychosurgery, 1888&ndash;1891===
[[File:Trepan.jpg|thumb|Nineteenth-century [[trephination]] set similar to that employed by Burckhardt]]

In December 1888 Burckhardt, who had little experience of surgery, performed what are commonly regarded as the first series of modern psychosurgical operations.{{#tag:ref|Multiple sources credit Burckhardt with having performed the first psychosurgical procedure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gross|Schäfer|2011|pp=1–8}}; {{Harvnb|Heller|Amar|Liu|Apuzzo|2006|p=727}}; {{Harvnb|Joanette|Stemmer|Assal|Whitaker|1993|pp=572, 575}}; {{Harvnb|Kotowicz|2008|p=486}}; {{Harvnb|Manjila|Rengachary|Xavier|Parker|2008|p=1}}; {{Harvnb|Noll|2007|p=326}}; {{Harvnb|Reevy|Ozer|Ito|2010|p=485}}; {{Harvnb|Steck|2010|pp=85–9}}; {{Harvnb|Stone|2001|pp=79–92}}; {{Harvnb|Suchy|2011|p=37}}; {{Harvnb|Mareke|Fangerau|2010|p=138}}; {{Harvnb|Ford|Henderson|2006|p=219}}; {{Harvnb|Green|Astradsson|Stacey|Aziz|2010|p=208}}; {{Harvnb|Sakas|Panourias|Singounas|Simpson|2007|p=366}}; {{Harvnb|Whitaker|Stemmer|Joanette|1996|p=276}}; {{Harvnb|Wepfer|2009|pp=137–50}}</ref> However, Kotowicz notes a difference, irregularly observed, among medical historians and medical practitioners in their location of the origin of psychosurgery. The latter group, he contends, tend to favour beginning the narrative with Burckhardt whilst the former group favour starting with Moniz.{{sfn|Kotowicz|2005|pp=78&ndash;9|ps=}}. In the context of early psychosurgery, Berrios unusually also refers to the operations performed in 1889 by a surgeon, Harrison Cripps, at the behest of the British psychiatrist Thomas Claye Shaw in which fluid was drawn from the brain of a patient diagnosed with [[General paresis of the insane|general paralysis of the insane]]. While the purpose of the operation was aimed towards the alleviation of mental symptoms attendant on the condition the procedure did not aim to interfere directly with brain tissue and therefore it has been excluded from most conventional accounts of psychosurgery.{{sfn|Berrios|1991|pp=181&ndash;5|ps=}}|group=n}} He operated on six patients under his care, two women and four men aged between 26 and 51 whose condition was deemed to be intractable.<ref>{{harvnb|Whitaker|Stemmer|Joanette|1996|p=276}}; {{harvnb|Berrios|1997|p=69}}</ref>  Their diagnoses were, variously, one of chronic [[mania]], one of primary [[dementia]] and four of ''primäre Verrücktheit'' (primary paranoid psychosis).{{#tag:ref|Otherwise known as "[[paranoia]]" or "primary insanity".{{sfn|Shorter|1990|pp=30&ndash;31|ps=}}. As a diagnostic category the Berlin psychiatrist Wilhelm Sander was responsible for its reintroduction in the late 1860s and [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] for its popularisation as ''originäre Paranoia'' in the early 1890s. Krafft-Ebing's disease concept referred to a mental illness that was hereditary in nature, began to manifest at puberty and developed into psychosis with delusional and hallucinatory features.{{sfn|Berrios|1997|p=69|ps=}}|group=n}} This latter diagnosis was, according to the clinician-historian German E. Berrios, "a clinical category that (anachronistically) should be considered as tantamount to schizophrenia".{{sfn|Berrios|1997|p=69|ps=}} Burckhardt's case notes recorded that the patients all exhibited serious [[psychiatric symptoms]] such as [[auditory hallucinations]], [[paranoid delusions]], aggression, excitement and violence. The operations excised regions of the [[cerebral cortex]], specifically removing sections of the frontal, temporal, and tempoparietal lobes. The results were not overly encouraging as one patient died five days after the operation after experiencing epileptic convulsions, one improved but later committed [[suicide]], another two showed no change, and the last two patients became "quieter". Complications consequent to the procedure included [[epilepsy]] (in two patients), motor weakness, "word deafness" and sensory [[aphasia]]. Only two patients are recorded as having no complications.<ref>{{harvnb|Berrios|1997|pp=69–70}}; {{harvnb|Manjila|Rengachary|Xavier|Parker|2008|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Stone|2001|pp=79–80}}; {{harvnb|Kotowicz|2005|pp=77–101}}</ref>

The theoretical basis of Burckhardt's action rested on three propositions. The first was that mental illness had a physical basis and that disordered minds were merely a reflection of disordered brains. Next, the [[associationist]] viewpoint of nerve functioning which conceived the nervous system as operating according to the following threefold division of labor: an input (or sensory or [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]]) system, a connecting system which processed information and an output (or [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] or motor) system. The final assumption of Buckhardt's was that the brain was modular which meant that each mental module or mental faculty could be linked to a specific location in the brain. In accordance with such a viewpoint, Buckhardt postulated that [[lesions]] in specific areas of the brain might impact behavior in a specific manner. In other words, he thought that by cutting the connecting system, or second association state of brain's system of communication troubling symptoms might be alleviated without compromising either the nervous system's input or output systems. The procedure was aimed at relieving symptoms, not at curing a given mental disease.{{sfn|Berrios|1997|pp=68, 77|ps=}} Thus, he wrote in 1891:
<blockquote>[I]f excitation and impulsive behaviour are due to the fact that from the sensory surfaces excitations abnormal in quality, quantity and intensity do arise, and do act on the motor surfaces, then an improvement could be obtained by creating an obstacle between the two surfaces. The extirpation of the motor or the sensory zone would expose us to the risk of grave functional disturbances and to technical difficulties. It would be more advantageous to practice the excision of a strip of cortex behind and on both sides of the motor zone creating thus a kind of ditch in the temporal lobe.<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Berrios|1997|pp=68&ndash;69}}</ref></blockquote>

Burckhardt attended the Berlin Medical Conference of 1889, which was also attended by such heavyweight psychiatrists as [[Victor Horsley]], [[Valentin Magnan]] and [[Emil Kraepelin]], and presented a paper on his brain operations. While his findings were subsequently widely reported in the psychiatric literature, the reviews were unremittingly negative and there was much ill ease generated by the surgical procedures he had performed.<ref>{{harvnb|Berrios|1997|p=69|}}; {{harvnb|Stone|2001|p=225}}; {{harvnb|Manjila|Rengachary|Xavier|Parker|2008|p=2}}</ref> He also published the results of the procedure in 1891 in the periodical ''Allgemeine Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie und psychischgerichtliche Medicin'' in an article entitled 'Uber Rindenexcisionen, als Beitrag zur operativen Therapie der Psychosen' ('Concerning cortical excision, as a contribution to the surgical treatment of psychosis').{{sfn|Whitaker|Stemmer|Joanette|1996|p=276|ps=}} This paper was his last significant medical publication.{{sfn|Berrios|1997|p=68|ps=}} Kraepelin, writing in 1893, was scathing of Burckhardt's attempts, and stated that "he [Burckhardt] suggested that restless patients could be pacified by scratching away the cerebral cortex."{{sfn|Manjila|Rengachary|Xavier|Parker|2008|p=3}} While Giuseppe Seppilli, an Italian professor of [[neuropsychiatry]], remarked in 1891 that Burckhardt's view of the brain as modular did not "fit in well with the view held by most [experts] that the psychoses reflect a diffuse pathology of the cerebral cortex and [ran counter to] the conception of the psyche as a unitary entity".{{sfn|Berrios|1997|p=69|ps=}}

Burckhardt wrote in 1891 that "Doctors are different by nature. One kind adheres to the old principle: first, do no harm ([[primum non nocere]]); the other one says: it is better to do something than do nothing (melius anceps remedium quam nullum). I certainly belong to the second category".{{sfn|Manjila|Rengachary|Xavier|Parker|2008|p=4|ps=}} The French psychiatrist Armand Semelaigne responded that "an absence of treatment was better than a bad treatment".{{sfn|Berrios|1997|pp=70&ndash;1|ps=}} After the publication of his impressive 81 page monograph on the subject in 1891, Burckhardt ended his research and practice of psychosurgery due to the ridicule he received from his colleagues over the methods he had employed.{{sfn|Stone|2001|p=88|ps=}}

Commenting on his monograph in 1891 the British psychiatrist William Ireland concluded:
<blockquote>Dr. Burckhardt has a firm faith in the view that the mind is made up of a number of faculties, holding their seats in distinct portions of the brain. Where excess or irregularity of function occurs he seeks to check it by ablation of a portion of the irritated centres. He defends himself from the criticisms which are sure to be directed against his bold treatment by showing the desperate character of the prognosis of the patients upon whom the operations were performed ...<ref>{{harvnb|Berrios|1997|p=71}}</ref></blockquote>

Ireland doubted that any English psychiatrist would have the "hardihood" to follow the path taken by Burckhardt.{{sfn|Berrios|1997|p=71|ps=}}

===Later career and death, 1891&ndash;1907===

Following the death of his wife and one of his sons, Burckhardt left his position at the Préfargier in 1896 and returned to Basel with the intention of setting up a [[sanatorium]].<ref name="Joanette1996a">{{harvnb|Whitaker|Stemmer|Joanette|1996|p=276}}; {{harvnb|Berrios|1997|p=68}}</ref> This plan came to fruition in 1900 when the Sonnenhalde Clinic was opened in [[Riehen]] near Basel.<ref name="Joanette1996a" /> Burckhardt served as the clinic's Medical Director from 1900 until 1904 and he remained a physician at the facility until his death from pneumonia on 6 February 1907.<ref name="Joanette1996a" /> He was a marginal figure within the professional community of his psychiatric peers, attending few medical symposia and conferences in his discipline.{{sfn|Berrios|1997|p=68|ps=}} However, he is often seen as a precursor to the Portuguese [[neurologist]], [[Egas Moniz]], who performed the first [[leucotomy]], later known as lobotomy, in 1936.<ref>{{Harvnb|Müller|1960|pp=726–30}}; {{Harvnb|Akert|1996|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Tierney|2000|pp=22–36}}</ref>
