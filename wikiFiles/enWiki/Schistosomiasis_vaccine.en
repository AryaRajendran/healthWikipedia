A '''Schistosomiasis vaccine''' is a vaccine against [[Schistosomiasis]] (also known as '''bilharzia''', '''bilharziosis''' or '''snail fever'''), a [[parasitic disease]] caused by several species of [[Trematoda|fluke]] of the genus ''[[Schistosoma]]''. No effective vaccine for the disease exists yet.  Schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people worldwide, mainly in rural agricultural and peri-urban areas of [[developing countries]], and approximately 10% suffer severe health complications from the infection.<ref name="McManus & Loukas"/> While chemotherepeutic drugs, such as [[praziquantel]], [[oxamniquine]] and [[metrifonate]], are currently considered safe and effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis, reinfection occurs frequently following drug treatment, thus a vaccine is sought to provide long-term treatment.<ref name="pmid18577363">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2008.05.023 |title=Recent advances in vaccine research against schistosomiasis in Brazil |year=2008 |last1=Oliveira |first1=Sergio C. |last2=Fonseca |first2=Cristina T. |last3=Cardoso |first3=Fernanda C. |last4=Farias |first4=Leonardo P. |last5=Leite |first5=Luciana C.C. |journal=Acta Tropica |volume=108 |issue=2–3 |pages=256–62 |pmid=18577363}}</ref><ref name="McManus & Loukas">{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/CMR.00046-07 |title=Current Status of Vaccines for Schistosomiasis |year=2008 |last1=McManus |first1=D.

At present Sm-p80 (calpain) is the sole schistosome vaccine candidate that has been tested for its prophylactic and antifecundity efficacy in different vaccine formulations and approaches (e.g., DNA alone, recombinant protein and prime boost) in two very different experimental animal models (mouse and baboon) of infection and disease. Sm-p80-based vaccine formulation(s) have four effects: Reduction in adult worm numbers; Reduction in egg production (complete elimination of egg induced pathology both in baboons and mice); Protection against acute schistosomiasis; Therapeutic effect on adult worms. This vaccine is now now ready for human clinical trials.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/infdis/jir545 |title=Preclinical Prophylactic Efficacy Testing of Sm-p80-Based Vaccine in a Nonhuman Primate Model of Schistosoma mansoni Infection and Immunoglobulin G and E Responses to Sm-p80 in Human Serum Samples from an Area Where Schistosomiasis is Endemic |year=2011 |last1=Ahmad |first1=G. |last2=Zhang |first2=W. |last3=Torben |first3=W. |last4=Ahrorov |first4=A. |last5=Damian |first5=R.

Schistosomiasis has been considered a "[[Neglected diseases|neglected disease]]" that disproportionately affects poorer localities and has received little attention from [[pharmaceutical companies]]. Support for current research efforts to develop hookworm vaccines has come from the Schistosomiasis Vaccine Initiative, a program of the [[Sabin Vaccine Institute]] in collaboration with [[George Washington University]], the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]], the [[Chinese Institute of Parasitic Diseases]], the [[Queensland Institute of Medical Research]], and the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]].<ref name=SabinSVI>[http://sabin.org/vaccine-development/vaccines/schisto Schistosomiasis Overview], Sabin Vaccine Institute</ref>
