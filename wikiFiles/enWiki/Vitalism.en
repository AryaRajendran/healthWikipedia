'''Vitalism''' is the doctrine, often advocated in the past but now rejected by mainstream science,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=AvqYl4sdwaYC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=vitalism+disrepute&source=bl&ots=x-jaFJjSBb&sig=zE_jwxQsD8eWR1v6_Q5Nph459x4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vWcDUM6rKrOF0QHlsJDdBw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=vitalism%20disrepute&f=false A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier - Elizabeth Ann Williams - Google Books]</ref> that "living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things".<ref>[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm BECHTEL, WILLIAM and ROBERT C. RICHARDSON (1998). Vitalism. In E. Craig (Ed.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: Routledge. Vitalism]</ref> Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the "vital spark", "energy" or "[[élan vital]]", which some equate with the [[soul (spirit)|soul]].

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: most [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. In the Western tradition founded by [[Hippocrates]], these vital forces were associated with the [[four temperaments]] and [[The four humours|humour]]s; Eastern traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of [[qi]] (or [[prana]]).

The [[Milesian school]] of ancient Greek philosophy proposed natural explanations (physics theories) [[deductive argument|deduced]] from [[materialism]] and [[mechanism]]. However, by the time of [[Lucretius]], the purely mechanist account was supplemented, (for example, by the [[clinamen]] of [[Epicurus]]), and in stoic physics, the warm, wet [[biogenesis|biogenetic]] breath of life, [[pneuma]], would assume the role of [[logos]]... interpenetrating and organizing both the animal psyche, and all matter in the cosmos. [[Galen]] believed the lungs draw pneuma from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.<ref>Charles Birch, John B. Cobb, ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, p. 75</ref> 

{{quote|Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine Artisan, contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic [[Weltanschauungen]], of which [[atomism]] was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent... This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from [[Epicurus]]... while the [[Stoics]] adopted a divine teleology... The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R.

In Europe, stoic pneuma influenced medieval physics, helping to shape later [[aether theories]] and in the 17th century, modern science responded to [[Issac Newton|Newton]]'s [[action at a distance]] and  the mechanism of [[Cartesian dualism]] with vitalist theories: whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called "organic" matter is permanently altered, by cooking, for example. [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], one of the early 19th century fathers of modern chemistry, argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions.<ref>''Andrew Ede (2007), The Rise and Decline of Colloid Science in North America, 1900–1935: The Neglected Dimension'', p. 23</ref> Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components. However, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] synthesised [[urea]] from inorganic components in 1828.<ref>[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&ProduktNr=223979&Ausgabe=225203&ArtikelNr=13463&filename=13463.pdf Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea]</ref> However, contemporary accounts do not support the common belief that vitalism died when Wöhler made urea. This ''Wöhler Myth'', as historian of science Peter J. Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, "ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'".<ref>[http://www.bioethicsjournal.com/past/cheng.html ''The Real Death of Vitalism: Implications of the Wöhler Myth]''</ref><ref>[http://www.joachimschummer.net/papers/2003_NatureChemistry_SHPS.pdf cited by Schummer J, op cit]</ref><ref>n 1845, [[Adolph Kolbe]] succeeded in making acetic acid from inorganic compounds, and in the 1850s, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] repeated this feat for numerous organic compounds. In retrospect, Wöhler's work was the beginning of the end of Berzelius's vitalist hypothesis, but only in retrospect, as Ramberg had shown.</ref>  Further discoveries continued to obviate the need for a special "vital force".

Vitalism is no longer philosophically and scientifically viable, most often used as a [[pejorative]] [[epithet]].<ref>"Other writers (eg, Peterfreund, 1971) simply use the term vitalism as a pejorative label." in Galatzer-Levy, RM (1976) Psychic Energy, A Historical Perspective ''Ann Psychoanal'' 4:41–61 [http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=aop.004.0041a]</ref> [[Ernst Mayr]], co-founder of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] and a critic of vitalism, wrote:
{{quote|It would be ahistorical to ridicule vitalists. When one reads the writings of one of the leading vitalists like Driesch one is forced to agree with him that many of the basic problems of biology simply cannot be solved by a philosophy as that of Descartes, in which the organism is simply considered a machine... The logic of the critique of the vitalists was impeccable.<ref>Mayr E (2002) ''The Walter Arndt Lecture: The Autonomy of Biology'', adapted for the internet, on [http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm]</ref>}}
{{quote|Vitalism has become so disreputable a belief in the last fifty years that no biologist alive today would want to be classified as a vitalist. Still, the remnants of vitalist thinking can be found in the work of [[Alistair Hardy]], [[Sewall Wright]], and [[Charles Birch]], who seem to believe in some sort of nonmaterial principle in organisms.<ref>Ernst Mayr ''Toward a new philosophy of biology: observations of an evolutionist'' 1988, p. 13</ref>}}

In fact, science continued to investigate the possibility of vital properties. [[Louis Pasteur]], shortly after his famous rebuttal of [[spontaneous generation]], performed several experiments that he felt supported the vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur "fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena." In 1858, Pasteur showed that fermentation only occurs when living cells are present and, that fermentation only occurs in the absence of oxygen; he was thus led to describe fermentation as "life without air". Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, [[Liebig]], [[Moritz Traube|Traube]] and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, he concluded that fermentation was a "vital action".<ref name="Becthel_Richardson"/>

Other vitalists include English anatomist [[Francis Glisson]] (1597–1677) and the Italian doctor [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).<ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76">Charles Birch, John B. Cobb, ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, pp. 76–78</ref> [[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]] (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenetic]] descriptive [[embryology]], that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. In his ''[[Theoria Generationis]]'' (1759), he endeavored to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a "vis essentialis", an organizing, formative force, and declared "All believers in epigenesis are Vitalists." [[Carl Reichenbach]] later developed the theory of [[Odic force]], a form of life-energy that permeates living things.

[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] established [[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] as the model of thought in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of ''Über den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgeschäfte''. Blumenbach cut up freshwater polyps and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a "formative drive" (''Bildungstrieb'') in living matter. But he pointed out that this name, "like names applied to every other kind of vital power, of itself, explains nothing: it serves merely to designate a peculiar power formed by the combination of the mechanical principle with that which is susceptible of modification". In the early 18th century, the physicians [[Marie François Xavier Bichat]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] recognized a "living principle" in addition to mechanics.<ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"/>

Between 1833 and 1844, [[Johannes Peter Müller]] wrote a book on [[physiology]] called ''Handbuch der Physiologie'', which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed Müller's commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a soul makes each organism an indivisible whole. He also claimed the behavior of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account.<ref>http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pdfgen/essays/enc22.pdf</ref>

[[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws.<ref name="DevBio">[http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&id=110 Developmental Biology 8e Online: A Selective History of Induction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His main argument was that when one cuts up a embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult. Driesch's reputation as an experimental biologist deteriorated as a result of his vitalistic theories.<ref name="DevBio"/>

Other vitalists included [[Johannes Reinke]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]]. Reinke used the word ''neovitalism'' to describe his work, he claimed that it would be eventually verified through experimentation and wanted an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke was an influence for [[Carl Jung]].<ref>Jung's Concept of Die Dominanten (The Dominants) [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Ph96bNuZ6aIJ:www.cgjungpage.org/index2.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26do_pdf%3D1%26id%3D529+Eduard+von+Rindfleisch+vitalism&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgnxQiSm3VAoJXgRzw-usVfvT5bielXE2LrICCDuBI1lYLGTFSNFt8yF5rNyZiqw1e_T0QDsBCo2gSkJR2EJnsiA57aFBRVkMY2B5JYITAs-xX9hgd4hYq8957TOc9LXly53JyE&sig=AHIEtbQ_5nCXW1DEFc3nLpIs1QTfE7K8dw Online]</ref>

[[John Scott Haldane]] adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an [[idealist]] philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that [[teleology]] was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book ''Mechanism, life and personality'' in 1913.<ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168">Peter J. Bowler, Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, pp. 168–169</ref> Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: "we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity", "every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience".<ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168"/> The work of Haldane was an influence on [[organicism]].

Haldane also stated that a purely mechanist interpretation can not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained:

{{quote|We must find a different theoretical basis of biology, based on the observation that all the phenomena concerned tend towards being so coordinated that they express what is normal for an adult organism.|<ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95"/>}}

By 1931, "Biologists have almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."<ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95">Mark A. Bedau, Carol E. Cleland, ''The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy and Science'', 2010, p. 95</ref>

=== Relationship to emergentism ===

Some aspects of contemporary science make reference to [[emergence|emergent process]]es; those in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schultz | first1 = SG | title = A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal = The American journal of physiology | volume = 274 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = C13–23 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9458708 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = SF | last2 = Sarkar | first2 = S | title = Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 219 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10974666 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999<::AID-DVDY1036>3.0.CO;2-A }}</ref> This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are also important for the behavior of the system.

Whether [[emergence|emergent system properties]] should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.<ref>see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? ''Semiotica'' 134: 653–693 [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/2001d.robumwelt.pdf]</ref> According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):

{{quote|On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and cross-disciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems.|<ref name="Emmeche 1997">Emmeche C (1997) Explaining Emergence: towards an ontology of levels. ''Journal for General Philosophy of Science'' [http://alf.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html available online]</ref>}}

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[élan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an intellectual tranquilizer or verbal sedative—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Mesmerism ==

A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was "[[animal magnetism]]", in the theories of [[Franz Anton Mesmer]] (1734–1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magnétisme animal''' can be misleading for three reasons:
* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to, at that time, as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.
* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.
* Mesmer chose the word "''animal''", for its root meaning (from Latin ''animus'' = "breath") specifically to identify his force/power as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans '''and''' animals.

Mesmer's ideas became so influential that King [[Louis XVI]] of France appointed two commissions to investigate [[mesmerism]]; one was led by [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the other, led by [[Benjamin Franklin]], included [[Jean Sylvain Bailly|Bailly]] and [[Lavoisier]]. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and [[trance]]s. In Franklin's garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been "mesmerized"; he hugged each in turn to receive the "vital fluid", but fainted at the foot of a 'wrong' one. At Lavoisier's house, four normal cups of water were held before a "sensitive" woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that "the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Best | first1 = M | last2 = Neuhauser | first2 = D | last3 = Slavin | first3 = L | title = Evaluating Mesmerism, Paris, 1784: the controversy over the blinded placebo controlled trials has not stopped | url = http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/12/3/232 | journal = Quality & safety in health care | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 232–3 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12792017 | pmc = 1743715 | doi=10.1136/qhc.12.3.232}}</ref> It is sometimes claimed<ref name="Becthel_Richardson">[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/~bill/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm Vitalism.] Bechtel W, Richardson RC (1998).

== Complementary and alternative medicine ==

The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ([[NCCAM]]) classifies [[Complementary and alternative medicine|CAM]] therapies into five categories or domains:<ref name="titleComplementary and Alternative Medicine - U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual |accessdate=2008-03-31 |work=}}</ref>
* alternative medical [[system]]s, or complete systems of therapy and practice;
* [[bodymind|mind-body]] interventions, or techniques designed to facilitate the mind's effect on bodily functions and symptoms;
* biologically based systems, including [[herbalism]];
* manipulative and body-based methods, such as chiropractic and massage therapy; and
* [[energy therapy]].

The therapies that continue to be most intimately associated with vitalism are bioenergetic medicines, in the category of energy therapies. This field may be further divided into [[bioelectromagnetic]] medicines (BEM) and [[biofield]] therapies (BT). Compared with bioenergetic medicines, biofield therapies have a stronger identity with vitalism. Examples of biofield therapies include [[therapeutic touch]], [[Reiki]], external [[qi]], [[chakra]] healing and SHEN therapy.<ref name="Rubik">Rubik, ''Bioenergetic Medicines'', American Medical Student Association Foundation, viewed 28 November 2006, [http://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc]</ref> Biofield therapies are medical treatments in which the "[[subtle energy]]" field of a patient is manipulated by a biofield practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic (EM) energy that is produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a "complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body...."<ref name="Rubik"/>

The founder of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: "...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body." As practised by some homeopaths today, homeopathy simply rests on the premise of treating sick persons with extremely diluted agents that – in undiluted doses – are deemed to produce similar symptoms in a healthy individual. Nevertheless, it remains equally true that the view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.

== Critical opinions ==

Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as [[begging the question]] by inventing a name. [[Molière]] had famously parodied this fallacy in ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its [[soporific]] power."<ref>'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]</ref> [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its "aquosity".<ref>[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/PMG/PBofL.html The Physical Basis of Life], ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 1869</ref> His grandson [[Julian Huxley]] in 1926 compared "vital force" or ''élan vital'' to explaining a railroad locomotive's operation by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive force").
