'''Ethosuximide''' is a [[succinimide]] [[anticonvulsant]], used mainly in [[absence seizure]]s.

==Uses==
===Approved===
It is approved for [[absence seizures]].{{ref|approved_use}}  Ethosuximide is considered the first choice drug for treating absence seizures in part because it lacks the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of the alternative anti-absence drug, [[valproic acid]].{{ref|approved_use}}

===Unapproved===
It was reported to have been used for [[intermittent explosive disorder]] in 1980 by Drs Andrulonis, Donnelly, Glueck, Stroebel, and Szabek.{{ref|Andrulonis_et_al_1980}}

===Dosage===
Therapeutic drug concentrations are individualized according to response and tolerance. Common Serum Therapeutic Range: 40-100&nbsp;µg/mL.  Potentially Toxic Serum Concentration: >100&nbsp;µg/mL.

==Availability==

Ethosuximide is marketed under the trade names '''Emeside''' and '''Zarontin'''. However, both capsule preparations were discontinued from production, leaving only generic preparations available. Emeside capsules were discontinued by their manufacturer, [[Laboratories for Applied Biology]], in 2005.<ref name=pharmjethosux>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmj.com/Editorial/20051029/news/p539ethosuximide.html |title=Concern over ethosuximide capsule discontinuation |journal=Pharm J |date=2005 Oct 29 |volume=275 |page=539 |accessdate=2008-08-31}} (paywalled archive)</ref> Similarly, Zarontin capsules were discontinued by [[Pfizer]] in 2007.<ref name=epiwatchethosux>{{cite web|url=http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/news/drugwatch/ethosuximide|title= Zarontin capsules discontinued|accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> Syrup preparations of both brands remained available.

==Mechanism of action==
There is some controversy over the exact mechanism by which ethosuximide prevents absence seizures. While the view that ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support following its proposal, attempts to replicate the initial finding were inconsistent.

In March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince showed that ethosuximide and [[dimethadione]], both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] [[electric current|current]]s in [[T-type calcium channel|T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel]]s in freshly removed [[thalamus|thalamic]] [[neuron]]s.{{ref|Coulter1989-1}} In June of that same year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be [[voltage]]-dependent, using acutely neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that [[valproic acid]], which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that.{{ref|Coulter1989-2}} The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the [[proconvulsant]] ones did not.{{ref|Coulter1990}} The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in [[dorsal root]] [[ganglion|ganglia]] at [[concentration]]s ranging from 7 [[micromole|µmol]]/[[litre|L]] to 1&nbsp;mmol/L.{{ref|Kostyuk}}

That same year, however, Herrington and Lingle found no such effect at concentrations of up to 2.5&nbsp;mmol/L.{{ref|Herrington-Lingle}} The year after, a study conducted on human [[neocortex|neocortical]] cells removed during surgery for intractable epilepsy, the first to use human tissue, found that ethosuximide had no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents at the concentrations typically needed for a therapeutic effect.{{ref|sayer1993}}

In 1998, Slobodan M. Todorovic and Christopher J. Lingle of Washington University reported a 100% block of T-type current in dorsal root ganglia at 23.7 ± 0.5&nbsp;mmol/L, far higher than Kostyuk reported.{{ref|Todorovic_Lingle}} That same year, Leresche et al. reported that ethosuximide had no effect on T-type currents, but did decrease noninactivating [[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] current by 60% and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents by 39.1 ± 6.4% in rat and cat thalamocortical cells. It was concluded that the decrease in Na<sup>+</sup> current is responsible for the anti-absence properties.{{ref|Leresche_et_al_1998}}

In the introduction of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels.{{ref|Gomora_et_al_2001}} Using cloned α1G, α1H, and α1I T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 12 ± 2&nbsp;mmol/L and that of ''N''-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of [[mesuximide]]) is 1.95 ± 0.19&nbsp;mmol/L for α1G, 1.82 ± 0.16&nbsp;mmol/L for α1I, and 3.0 ± 0.3&nbsp;mmol/L for α1H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.
<!--==Metabolism==
Ethosuximide is primarily metabolized by [[CYP3A4]] into, and by [[CYP2E1]] into.-->

==Adverse effects==
===Central nervous system===
====Common====
* drowsiness
* mental confusion
* [[insomnia]]
* [[headache]]
* [[ataxia]]

====Rare====
* [[paranoia|paranoid]] [[psychosis]]
* increased libido
* exacerbation of [[clinical depression|depression]]

===Gastrointestinal===
* [[dyspepsia]]
* [[vomiting]]
* [[nausea]]
* cramps
* [[constipation]]
* [[diarrhea]]
* stomach pain
* loss of appetite
* weight loss
* [[hyperplasia|gingival hyperplasia]]
* swelling of tongue

===Genitourinary===
* microscopic [[hematuria]]
* vaginal bleeding

===Hematopoietic===
''The following can occur with or without bone marrow loss:''
* [[pancytopenia]]
* [[agranulocytosis]]
* [[leukopenia]]
* [[eosinophilia]]

===Integumentary===
* [[urticaria]]
* [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]
* [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]
* [[hirsutism]]
* [[itch|pruritic]] [[lupus erythematosus|erythematous rash]]es

===Ocular===
* [[myopia]]

==Complications==
* abnormal [[liver|liver function]]

==Drug interactions==
[[valproic acid|Valproate]]s can either decrease or increase the levels of ethosuximide; However, combinations of [[valproic acid|valproate]]s and ethosuximide had a greater [[Protective_index|Protective Index]] than either drug alone.{{ref|combo}}

It may elevate serum [[phenytoin]] levels.

==Chemistry==
Ethosuximide, 3-ethyl-3-methypyrrolidine-2,5-dione is synthesized from methylethylketone and cyanoacetic ester, which undergo a [[Knoevenagel condensation]]. Then [[hydrogen cyanide]] is added. After acidic hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the synthesized dinitrile, 2-methyl-2-ethylsuccinic acid is formed. Reacting this product with ammonia gives the diammonium salt, and heterocyclization into ethosuximide takes place during subsequent heating.
