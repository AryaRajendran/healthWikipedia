A [[bed bug]] can individually and collectively cause a number of health effects including skin rashes, psychological effects and allergic symptoms.<ref name=GP2009/> Bed bug bites or cimicosis may lead to a range of skin manifestations from no visible effects to prominent blisters.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|446}} Diagnosis involves both finding bed bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms.<ref name=GP2009/>  Treatment involves the elimination of the insect but is otherwise [[symptomatic]].<ref name=GP2009/>

[[File:Bedbugb2.JPG|thumb|Bedbug bites]]
===Skin===

Symptoms may not appear until some days after the bites have occurred.<ref name=GP2009/> Reactions often become more brisk after multiple bites due to possible sensitization to the salivary proteins of the bed bug.<ref name=JAMA2009/> The skin reaction usually occurs in the area of the bite which is most commonly the arms, shoulders and legs as they are more frequently exposed at night.<ref name=GP2009/> Numerous bites may lead to an [[erythematous rash]] or [[urticaria]].<ref name=GP2009/>

===Psychological===
Serious infestations and chronic attacks can cause anxiety, stress, and [[insomnia]].<ref name=GP2009/> Development of refractory [[delusional parasitosis]] is possible, as a person develops an overwhelming obsession with bed bugs.<ref name="injury">{{cite web |author=Susan C. Jones |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/pdf/2105.pdf |title=Extension Fact Sheet "Bed Bugs, Injury" |date=January 2004 |publisher=[[Ohio State University]]}}</ref>

===Other===
A number of other symptoms may occur from either the bite of the bed bugs or from their exposure. [[Anaphylaxis]] from the injection of serum and other nonspecific proteins has been rarely documented.<ref name=GP2009/><ref>{{Cite journal |last = Bircher | first = Andreas J |title = Systemic Immediate Allergic Reactions to Arthropod Stings and Bites |journal = Dermatology |volume = 210 |issue = 2 | pages = 119–127 |publisher = Blackwell Publishing |pmid = 15724094|year = 2005 |doi = 10.1159/000082567 }}</ref> Due to each bite taking a tiny amount of [[blood]], chronic or severe infestation may lead to [[anemia]].<ref name=GP2009/> [[Bacterial]] skin infection may occur due to skin break down from scratching.<ref name=GP2009/><ref name="UCIPM">{{cite web |publisher = UC IPM Online (Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program, UC Davis) |title = How to Manage Pests Pests of Homes, Structures, People, and Pets |url = http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7454.html |accessdate = 26 June2010 }}</ref>

==Cause==
{{Main|Bed bug}}
[[Image:Bed bug, Cimex lectularius.jpg|thumb|An adult bed bug ([[Cimex lectularius]]) with the typical flattened oval shape.]]
Bed bug bites are caused by [[bed bugs]] primarily of two species ''[[Cimex lectularius]]'' (the common bed bug) and ''Cimex hemipterus''.<ref name=JAMA2009/>  [[Infestation]] is rarely due to a lack of [[hygiene]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hildreth CJ, Burke AE, Glass RM |title=JAMA patient page. Bed bugs |journal=JAMA |volume=301 |issue=13 |pages=1398 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19336718 |doi=10.1001/jama.301.13.1398 |url=}}</ref>  These insects feed exclusively on blood and may survive a year without eating.<ref name=JAMA2009/> They are attracted by body warmth and [[carbon dioxide]].<ref name=Kolb2009/> Transfer to new places is usually in the personal effects of the human they feed upon.<ref name=JAMA2009/>

==Diagnosis==
A definitive diagnosis of health effects due to bed bugs requires a search for and finding of the insect in the sleeping environment as symptoms are not sufficiently [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]].<ref name=GP2009/> Other possible conditions with which these conditions can be confused include: [[scabies]], [[allergic reactions]], [[mosquito bites]], [[spider bites]], [[chicken pox]] and bacterial skin infections.<ref name=GP2009/> Bed bugs classically form a line of bites colloquially referred to as "breakfast, lunch, and dinner" and rarely feed in the armpit or behind the knee which may help differentiate it from other biting insects.<ref name=Kolb2009/> If the number in a house is large a pungent sweet odor may be described.<ref name=Kolb2009/>

==Treatment==
{{See also|Bed bug control techniques}}
Treatment requires keeping the person from being repeatedly bitten and possible symptomatic use of [[antihistamines]] and [[corticosteroids]] (either [[topically]] or systemically).<ref name=GP2009/> There however is no evidence that medications improve outcomes and symptoms usually resolve without treatment in 1–2 weeks.<ref name=JAMA2009/><ref name=Kolb2009/>

Avoiding repeated bites can be difficult, since it usually requires [[Bed bug control techniques|eradicating bed bugs]] from a home or workplace; eradication frequently requires a combination of [[pesticide]] and non pesticide approaches.<ref name=JAMA2009/> Pesticides that have historically been found to be effective include: [[pyrethroid]]s, [[dichlorvos]] and [[malathion]].<ref name=Kolb2009/> Resistance to pesticides has increased significantly over time and there are concerns of [[Health effects of pesticides|negative health effects]] from their usage.<ref name=JAMA2009/>  Mechanical approaches such as vacuuming up the insects and heat treating or wrapping mattresses have been recommended.<ref name=JAMA2009/>

==Epidemiology==
{{Main|Epidemiology of bed bugs}}
[[Bed bugs]] occur around the world.<ref name=Heu09>pmid 19362691</ref> Rates of infestations in [[developed countries]] while decreasing from the 1930s to the 1980s have increased dramatically since the 1980s.<ref name="JAMA2009"/><ref name="Kolb2009"/><ref name=Heu09/> Previous to this they were common in the [[developing world]] but rare in the developed world.<ref name=Kolb2009/> The increase in the developed world may have been caused by increased international travel, resistance to [[insecticides]], and the use of new pest-control methods that do not affect bed bugs.<ref name="Romero_et_al"/><ref name="owen">{{cite web |last = Owen | first = James |title = Bloodthirsty Bedbugs Stage Comeback in U.S., Europe |work = National Geographic News |publisher = National Geographic |date = 13 May 2004 |url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/05/0513_040513_bedbugs.html |accessdate = 31 May 2010 }}</ref> The fall in bed bug populations after the 1930s in the developed world is believed to be partly due to the usage of [[DDT]] to kill [[cockroaches]].<ref name=Nurse09>{{cite journal |author=Krause-Parello CA, Sciscione P |title=Bedbugs: an equal opportunist and cosmopolitan creature |journal=J Sch Nurs |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=126–32 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19233933 |doi=10.1177/1059840509331438 |url=}}</ref> The invention of the [[vacuum cleaner]] and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role.<ref name=Nurse09/> Others believe it might simply be the cyclical nature of the organism.<ref>[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98426/E91435.pdf] p.131</ref>
A study published in the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America reported these conclusions after the study evaluated using Gaseous Chlorine Dioxide Cl02. "The results of this study are encouraging and demonstrate that ClO2 may be useful for eradication of bedbugs" Because Chlorine Dioxide is a true gas at room temperatures, this study has shown another method to eradicate the bedbug, their larvae, and their eggs.

In the 18th century, [[turpentine]] was used in combination with [[henna]] (''Lawsonia inermis'') flowers and alcohol, as an insecticide that also reputedly killed bed bug eggs.<ref>Rictor Norton, Early Eighteenth-Century Newspaper Reports: A Sourcebook, "Getting Rid of Bed-Bugs", 18 November 2001, updated 30 November 2001 <http://grubstreet.rictornorton.co.uk/bedbugs.htm></ref>

Other items that were believed to kill bed bugs in the early 19th century include "infused oil of ''[[Melolontha]] vulgaris''" (presumably a kind of [[cockchafer]]), [[fly agaric]] (''Amanita muscaria''), [[Actaea]] spp. (e.g. black cohosh), [[tobacco]], "heated oil of [[Terebinth]]ina" (i.e. true [[turpentine]]), wild mint (''[[Mentha arvensis]]''), narrow-leaved pepperwort (''[[Lepidium ruderale]]''), ''[[Myrica]]'' spp. (e.g. bayberry), Robert Geranium (''[[Geranium robertianum]]''), [[Cimicifuga|bugbane]] (''Cimicifuga'' spp.), "herb and seeds of ''[[Cannabis]]''", "Opulus" berries (possibly a kind of [[maple]], or [[Viburnum opulus|European cranberrybush]]), [[masked hunter]] bugs (''Reduvius personatus''), "and many others."<ref>

The use of [[black pepper]] to repel bed bugs is attested in [[George Orwell]]'s 1933 non-fiction book ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]''.

Dusts have been used to ward off insects from grain storage for centuries, including "plant ash, lime, dolomite, certain types of soil, and [[diatomaceous earth]] (DE) or Kieselguhr".<ref name=hillde/> Of these, diatomaceous earth in particular has seen a revival as a non-toxic (when in amorphous form) residual pesticide for bed bug abatement.

Basket-work panels were put around beds and shaken out in the morning, in the UK and in France in the 19th century. Scattering leaves of plants with microscopic hooked hairs around a bed at night, then sweeping them up in the morning and burning them, was a technique reportedly used in Southern Rhodesia and in the Balkans.<ref name=Boase2001>{{Cite journal |title = Bedbugs – back from the brink |year = 2001 | pages = 159–162 | volume = 12 | issue = 4 |last = Boase | first = C. |journal = Pesticide Outlook |url = http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=b106301b |doi = 10.1039/b106301b | accessdate = 2010-05-27 |postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The rise in infestations has been hard to track because bed bugs are not an easily identifiable problem.
