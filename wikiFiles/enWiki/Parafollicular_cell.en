'''Parafollicular cells''' (also called '''C cells''') are [[neuroendocrine cell]]s in the [[thyroid]] with primary function to secrete [[calcitonin]]. They are located adjacent to the thyroid follicles and reside in the connective tissue. These cells are large and have a pale stain compared with the [[follicular cell]]s or colloid. In [[teleost]] and avian species these cells occupy a structure outside of the thyroid gland named the [[ultimobranchial body]].

Parafollicular cells themselves are derived from [[neural crest]] cells. Embryologically, they associate with the ultimobranchial body, which itself is a ventral derivative of the fourth (or fifth) [[pharyngeal pouch]]. In a series of experiments, Nicole LeDouarin transplanted neural crest cells from [[quail]], with unique and easily identified nuclei, into non-quail neural crest. She subsequently demonstrated the presence of cells with quail nuclei populating the ultimobranchial body and concluded that C cells migrate during embryologic development from the neural crest.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Le Douarin|first=N|coauthors=Fontaine, J; Le Lièvre, C|title=New studies on the neural crest origin of the avian ultimobranchial glandular cells--interspecific combinations and cytochemical characterization of C cells based on the uptake of biogenic amine precursors.|journal=Histochemistry|date=1974 Mar 13|volume=38|issue=4|pages=297-305|pmid=4135055}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Barasch|first=J|coauthors=Gershon, MD; Nunez, EA; Tamir, H; al-Awqati, Q|title=Thyrotropin induces the acidification of the secretory granules of parafollicular cells by increasing the chloride conductance of the granular membrane.|journal=The Journal of cell biology|date=1988 Dec|volume=107|issue=6 Pt 1|pages=2137-47|pmid=2461947|url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/107/6/2137.full.pdf}}</ref> 

They are not numerous in the thyroid and are typically situated basally in the epithelium, without direct contact with the follicular lumen.  They are always situated within the [[basement membrane]], which surrounds the entire follicle.

Parafollicular cell are also known to secrete in smaller quantities several neuroendocrine peptides such as [[serotonin]], [[somatostatin]] or [[CGRP]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zabel|first=M|title=Ultrastructural localization of calcitonin, somatostatin and serotonin in parafollicular cells of rat thyroid.|journal=The Histochemical journal|date=1984 Dec|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1265-72|pmid=6152264}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Barasch|first=JM|coauthors=Mackey, H; Tamir, H; Nunez, EA; Gershon, MD|title=Induction of a neural phenotype in a serotonergic endocrine cell derived from the neural crest.|journal=The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience|date=1987 Sep|volume=7|issue=9|pages=2874-83|pmid=3305802|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/7/9/2874.full.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bernd|first=P|coauthors=Gershon, MD; Nunez, EA; Tamir, H|title=Separation of dissociated thyroid follicular and parafollicular cells: association of serotonin binding protein with parafollicular cells.|journal=The Journal of cell biology|date=1981 Mar|volume=88|issue=3|pages=499-508|pmid=7217200|url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/88/3/499.full.pdf}}</ref>  They may also have a [[paracrine]] role in regulating thyroid hormones production, as they express TRH.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gkonos|first=PJ|coauthors=Tavianini, MA; Liu, CC; Roos, BA|title=Thyrotropin-releasing hormone gene expression in normal thyroid parafollicular cells.|journal=Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)|date=1989 Dec|volume=3|issue=12|pages=2101-9|pmid=2516877}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Morillo-Bernal|first=Jesús|coauthors=Fernández-Santos, José M.; Utrilla, José C.; de Miguel, Manuel; García-Marín, Rocío; Martín-Lacave, Inés|title=Functional expression of the thyrotropin receptor in C cells: new insights into their involvement in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis|journal=Journal of Anatomy|date=1 August 2009|volume=215|issue=2|pages=150–158|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01095.x|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2740962/}}</ref>  

When parafollicular cells become cancerous, they lead to [[medullary_thyroid_cancer|medullary carcinoma]] of the thyroid.
