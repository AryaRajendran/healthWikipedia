As the shoulder is the most complex and unstable joint in the body, it can get injured easily.  Many surgeries have been developed to repair the muscles, connective tissue or damaged joints that can arise from traumatic or overuse injuries to the shoulder.

==List of Shoulder Surgeries (by attempted repair)==

=== Dislocated Shoulder ===
See [http://www.orthop.washington.edu/?q=patient-care/articles/sports/shoulder-scope.html]

* Arthroscopic Repairs
** repair of the [[Glenoid labrum]] (anterior or posterior)
* Rehabilitation
** The recovery depends upon many factors, such as where the tear was located, how severe it was and how good the surgical repair was. It is believed that it takes at least four to six weeks for the labrum to re-attach itself to the scapula bone (shoulder blade), and probably another four to six weeks to get strong. The labrum is a ring of cartilage on the rim of a shallow socket in the scapula into which the head of the upper arm bone normally fits and rotates.  Once the labrum has healed to the rim of the shoulder blade, it should see stress very gradually so that it can gather strength. It is important not to re-injure it while it is healing. How much motion and strengthening of the arm is allowed after surgery also depends upon many factors, and it is up to the surgeon to let you know your limitations and how fast to progress. Because of the variability in the injury and the type of repair done, it is difficult to predict how soon someone can to return to activities and to sports after the repair. The type of sport also is important, since contact sports have a greater chance of injuring the labrum repair. However, a vast majority of patients have full function of the shoulder after labrum repair, and most patients can return to their previous level of sports with no or few restrictions.

** repair of the [[capsular ligament]]s  ([[Bankart repair]])
** repair of the [[Biceps brachii muscle|biceps]] long head anchor or [[SLAP tear|SLAP lesion]] <!-- for dislocations? -->
** tightening of the shoulder capsule ([[capsulorrhaphy]] or capsular shift)
* Open Repairs (for dislocations with fractures, etc.)

=== Separated shoulder ===

* [[Weaver-Dunn procedure]]
* Weaver-Dunn with various additional fixations ([[sutures]], suture anchors, tendon [[autograft]]) to replace the [[coracoclavicular ligament]]s.  Note: various methods have been utilized to anchor the clavicle in place while the surgery heals.  This includes
** Dacron graft/loop
** Bosworth screw
** Kirschner wires
** Hook plate [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11822073&dopt=Abstract]
* Anatomic Repair, or any repair using tendon [[allograft]] without sacrificing the [[coracoacromial ligament]].
* Arthroscopic Weaver-Dunn
* Transfer of conjoined tendon and distal end of [[coracoid process]] to the clavicle

===Sternoclavicular Separation ===

===Tendonitis, bursitis, and impingement syndrome===

*Tendon Repair <!-- ?? -->
*Mumford Procedure/[[Acromioplasty]]

===Rotator cuff tear===

* Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair

===Fracture===

*Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF)
<!-- is open reduction external fixation possible? or that generally closed reduction?  in any case, if anything is externally fixated when it comes to shoulder fractures?-->

===Arthritis of the shoulder (glenohumeral joint)===
Shoulder replacement
*Total [[shoulder replacement]]
*[[Hemiarthroplasty]] (half a replacement)
*Reverse Shoulder Implant (for arthritis with large rotator cuff tear)

===Arthritis or Osteolysis of the AC (acromioclavicular) joint===

* Mumford Procedure (Open or Arthroscopic)
