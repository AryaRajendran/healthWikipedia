'''Prehistoric medicine''' is any use of [[medicine]] from before the [[invention]] of [[writing]]. As the timing of the invention of writing varies per [[culture]] and region, the term "prehistoric medicine" encompasses a wide range of time periods and dates.<ref name='OCR'>{{cite book |title= Medicine Through Time|last= Kelly|first= Nigel |coauthors= Bob Rees, Paul Shuter|year= 2003|publisher= [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] |isbn= 978-0-435-30841-4 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=1qiFEQ1tAHQC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=prehistoric+medicine}}</ref> 

The study of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] medicine relies heavily on [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[body|human remains]], and on [[anthropology]]. Previously [[uncontacted peoples]] and certain [[indigenous peoples]] who live in a traditional way have been the subject of anthropological studies in order to gain insight into both contemporary and ancient practices.<ref name=WHO>{{cite web | title = Traditional Medicine | url = http://www.wpro.who.int/health_topics/traditional_medicine/ | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | accessdate = 2009-02-18}}</ref>

== Disease and mortality ==
Different diseases and ailments were common in prehistory than are prevalent today; there is evidence that many people suffered from [[osteoarthritis]], probably caused by the lifting of heavy objects which would have been a daily and necessary task in their societies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The transport of, for example, [[latte stone]]s, though this practice only started after 800 A.D, during the neolithic era: involving hyper extension and torque of the lower back, while dragging the stones, may have contributed to the development of micro fractures in the spine and subsequent [[spondylolysis]].  Things such as cuts, bruises, and breakages of bone, without antiseptics, proper facilities, or knowledge of germs, would become very serious if infected.<ref>{{cite web | title = The History of Medicine, Pre-history | url = http://www.britishempire.co.uk/boniface/humanities/history/year10/prehistoric.htm | publisher = St. Boniface's College | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=December 2011}}
There is also evidence of [[rickets]] bone deformity and bone wastage ([[Osteomalacia]]),<ref name='Short journey'>{{cite web | title = Babylon to Birmingham, A short journey through medicine to the end of the 18th Century | url = http://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/article_01_01.stm | publisher = Revolutionary Players | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref> which is caused by a lack of [[Vitamin D]].

The life expectancy in prehistoric times was low, 25&ndash;40 years,<ref>SHP: Medicine & Health Through Time</ref> with men living longer than women; archaeological evidence of women and babies found together suggests that many women would have died in childbirth, perhaps accounting for the lower life expectancy in women than men.  Another possible explanation for the shorter life spans of prehistoric humans may be malnutrition; men, as hunters, generally received better food than their female counterparts, who would subsequently have been less resistant to disease.<ref>{{cite web | title = Prehistoric Medicine | url = http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/6303/1/Prehistoric-Medicine.html | publisher = Health Guidance | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref>

== Treatments for disease ==

An idea can be obtained by looking at the climate of the respective society and which species continue to grow there today<ref>{{cite book |author= Compiled by Robin Lock|title= Plants of the Humid Tropics Biome|year=2002 |publisher=Eden Project books |pages=128 }}</ref> and through anthropological studies of existing indigenous peoples.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Moerman | first = Daniel E. | encyclopedia=Native American Medicinal Plants: an ethnobotanical dictionary|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|place=Portland, OR / London |isbn=0-88192-987-5|isnb13=9780881929874}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Native American Herbal Remedies | url = http://www.powersource.com/cherokee/herbal.html | publisher = Cherokee Messenger | year = 1996 | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref> 
Unlike the ancient civilisations which could source plant materials internationally, prehistoric societies would have been restricted to localised areas, though [[nomadic]] tribes may have had a greater variety of plant materials at their disposal than more stationary societies.   

The effects of different plant materials could have been found through trial and error.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/shp/ancient/prehistoriccivilisationrev2.shtml BBC - GCSE Bitesize, Prehistoric Civilisation] 'They have done this through a process of trial and error and natural selection..'</ref>  Dispensal and gathering of plant materials was handled by women, who cared for the health of their family.<ref>[http://www.healthy.net/asp/templates/article.asp?PageType=Article&ID=901 Outline/Overview of the History of Herbalism] 'In.. herbalism, women prepared food and healing potions--women generally practiced herbalism on a day to day basis, as well as took care of the ills of other members of the family or tribal unit' Source: ibid</ref> Plant materials were an important cure for diseases throughout history.<ref name='HistoryWorld'>[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa52 Primitive Medicine]</ref> As they would not have been able to record the effects of different herbs, knowledge of them would have been passed down orally through the generations, or lost.
   
There has been suggestion that the ''[[Piptoporus betulinus]]'', which are commonly found in alpine environments, could have been used as a basic laxative by prehistoric peoples living in those areas (Northern Europe), since it is known to bring on short bouts of diarrhoea when ingested,<ref name='Iceman'>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DD173AF93BA35751C1A96E958260 Lessons in Iceman's Prehistoric Medicine Kit]</ref> and was found among the possessions of a mummified man.

===The use of earth and clays===
Earths and [[clays]] may have provided prehistoric peoples with some of their first medicines. This is related to [[geophagy]], which is extremely widespread among animals in the wild as well as among domesticated animals. In particular, geophagy is widespread among contemporary non-human primates.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Krishnamani R, Mahaney WC | year = 2000 | title = Geophagy among primates: Adaptive significance and ecological consequences | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 899–915 }}</ref> Also, early humans could have learned about the use of various [[healing clay]]s by observing animal behaviour. Such clay is used both internally and externally, such as for treating wounds, and after surgery (see below).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Geophagy, and the external use of clay are both still quite widespread among aboriginal peoples around the world, as well as among pre-industrial populations.

=== Surgery ===
''[[Trepanning]]'' (sometimes ''trephining'') was a basic [[surgical operation]] carried out, predominantly by medicine men, in prehistoric societies across the world,<ref name='Neuro' /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00006123-199907000-00033 |author=Piek J, Lidke G, Terberger T, von Smekal U, Gaab MR |title=Stone age skull surgery in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: a systematic study |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=147–51; discussion 151 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10414577 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0148-396X&volume=45&issue=1&spage=147}} A small but informative text</ref> although evidence shows a concentration of the practice in [[Peru]].<ref name="HistoryWorld"/><ref name='Neuro'>{{cite web | title = Pre-Columbian Trephination | url = http://www.neurosurgery.org/cybermuseum/pre20th/treph/trephination.html Trepanning | publisher = Cyber Museum of Neurosurgery | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref><ref>[http://www.uic.edu/classes/osci/osci590/6_2Trephination.htm Trephination, An Ancient Surgery] 'In Peruvian practice there is considerable evidence that many of the operations were performed for the naturalistic purpose of removing a bone fragment..' '..and trephination undertaken as a supernatural curative procedure by shamans (sancoyoc) with little technical ability as surgeons.'</ref> Several theories question the reasoning behind trepanning; it could have been used to cure certain conditions such as [[headache]]s and [[epilepsy]].<ref>[http://www.brain-surgery.com/history.html History of Brain Surgery]</ref><ref>[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=OslEvol.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=2&division=div2 Evolution of Modern Medicine] See the section on Trephining, from Lucas-Championnière</ref> These might have been considered effects of an evil spirit trapped within a person. Despite it being medically inappropriate in the vast majority of cases, and very dangerous procedure to carry out<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A471287 h2g2 - Trepanation] 'The disadvantages of drilling holes in the head include possible damage to the cerebral membrane or complete, and unexpected, lobotomy. Death is also a high risk.'</ref> there is evidence of bone tissue surrounding the surgical hole partially grown back, therefore survival of the procedure did occur.<ref name='HistoryWorld' /> 

The plate of skull bone, sometimes as large as 5 [[Centimetre|cm]] (2 [[Inch|in]]) in diameter, would have been kept with the person until their death, serving as a charm or in some spiritual or religious capacity; burial of this bone plate was thought to return the body to its full state for the [[afterlife]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Trepanning is amongst few surgical operations to be carried out in prehistoric times;{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} other surgery was rarely undertaken; medicine men had neither the training or the specialised equipment required to do surgery on the internal body. The procedure would have taken around 60 minutes in a single session, and if done in several sessions, it could have taken up to 12 days to complete.

Many prehistoric peoples,{{Which|date=December 2011}} where applicable (geographically and technologically), were able to set broken or [[fractured]] bones using clay materials. An injured area was covered in clay, which then set hard so that the bone could heal properly without interference.<ref>Heinemann: Medicine Through Time</ref> Also, primarily in the [[Americas]], the pincers of certain ant species were used to close up wounds from infection; the ant was held above the wound until it bit, where its head would be removed allowing the pincers to remain and hold closed the wound.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gudger|first=E. W.|year=1925|title=Stitching Wounds With the Mandibles of Ants and Beetles|journal=J. Amer. Med. Assoc.|volume=84|pages=1861–4}}</ref>

=== Magic and medicine men ===

{{Main|Medicine man|Shamanism}}

''[[Medicine man|Medicine men]]'' (also witch-doctors, shamans) maintained the health of their tribe by gathering and distributing herbs, performing minor surgical procedures,<ref>[http://www.encounter.co.za/cgi-bin/magazine/ds.cgi?id=7 Mysteries of Africa - Article on Medicine Men] Stories of Medicine Men in Africa</ref> providing medical advice, and [[Magic (paranormal)|supernatural treatments]] such as charms, spells, and [[amulet]]s to ward off evil spirits.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Btx3M5t6lDEC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=prehistoric+medicine&source=web&ots=lfOpUn5wTm&sig=V2PByon7RGZ5X1ZmZn_LggPqlfY&hl=en#PPA13,M1A Short History of Medicine by Erwin Heinz Ackerknecht]</ref> In [[Apache]] society, as would likely have been the case in many others, the medicine men initiate a ceremony over the patient, which is attended by family and friends. It consists of magic formulas, prayers, and drumming. The medicine man then, from patients' recalling of their past and possible offenses against their religion or tribal rules, reveals the nature of the disease and how to treat it. 

They were believed by the tribe to be able to contact spirits or gods and use their supernatural powers to cure the patient, and, in the process, remove evil spirits. If neither this method nor trepanning worked, the spirit was considered too powerful to be driven out of the person.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Medicine men would likely have been central figures in the tribal system, because of their medical knowledge and because they could seemingly contact the gods. Their religious and medical training were, necessarily, [[Oral tradition|passed down orally]].<ref>[http://www.bri.net.au/medicine.html Healing Secrets of Aboriginal Bush Medicine] 'Trained from an early age by their elders and initiated into the deepest of tribal secrets...'</ref>

== Dentistry ==
Archaeologists in [[Mehrgarh]] in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] province in the present day [[Pakistan]] discovered that the people of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] from the early [[Harappa]]n periods (c. 3300 BC) had knowledge of medicine and [[dentistry]]. The [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]] who carried out the examinations, Professor Andrea Cucina from the [[University of Missouri]], made the discovery when he was cleaning the teeth from one of the men. Later research in the same area found evidence of teeth having been drilled, dating back 9,000 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4882968.stm | work=BBC News | title=Stone age man used dentist drill | date=2006-04-06 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

== The problem of evidence ==
The definition of "prehistoric" dictates that there is no written evidence which can be used for investigation into this period of history. Historians must use other sources such as [[Body|human remains]] and anthropological studies of societies living under similar conditions. A variety of problems arise when the aforementioned sources are used.

Human remains from this period are rare and many have undoubtedly been destroyed by burial rituals or made useless by damage.<ref>[http://www.kented.org.uk/ngfl/subjects/history/medhist/page9_pkent.html The History of Health - Prehistoric Kent] 'It is a matter of luck because only some skeletons survive'</ref><ref>[[Ötzi the Iceman#Body|Wikipedia's Ötzi the Iceman Article]] '..three or four of his right ribs had been squashed when he had been lying face down after death, or where the ice had crushed his body.'</ref> The most informative archaeological evidence are [[mummies]], remains which have been preserved by either freezing or in [[peat bog]]s;<ref>[http://www.mydigiguide.com/dgx/wbl.dll?a=6&h=49&PID=23519 Mystery of the Mummies, Five Documentary]</ref><ref>Megabites: Mummies, and the Secrets of Ancient Egypt</ref> no evidence exists to suggest that prehistoric people mummified the dead for religious reasons, as [[Ancient Egypt]]ians did. These bodies can provide scientists with subjects' (at the time of death): weight, illnesses, height, diet, age, and bone conditions,<ref>[[Mummy Juanita#Identity|Wikipedia's Article on the Mummy Juanita]]</ref> which grant vital indications of how developed prehistoric medicine was. 

Not technically classed as 'written evidence', prehistoric people left many kinds of paintings, using paints made of minerals such as lime, clay & charcoal and brushes made from feathers, animal fur or twigs, on the walls caves. Although many of these paintings are thought to have a spiritual or religious purpose,<ref>Parragon, World History Encyclopedia</ref> there have been some, such as a man with antlers (thought to be a medicine man), which have revealed some part of prehistoric medicine. Many cave paintings of human hands have shown missing fingers (none have been shown without thumbs), which suggests that these were cut off for sacrificial or practical purposes, as is the case among the [[Pygmies]] and [[Khoikhoi]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Janssens PA |title=MEDICAL VIEWS ON PREHISTORIC REPRESENTATIONS OF HUMAN HANDS |journal=Med Hist |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=318–22 |year=1957 |month=October |pmid=13476920 |pmc=1034309 }} Pages 318–21 are of particular interest in this subject</ref>

The writings of certain cultures (such as the Romans) can be used as evidence in discovering how their contemporary prehistoric cultures practiced medicine. People who live a similar nomadic existence today have been used as a source of evidence too, but obviously there are distinct differences in the environments in which nomadic people lived; prehistoric people who once lived in [[Great Britain|Britain]] for example, cannot be effectively compared to aboriginal peoples in [[Australia]], because of the geographical differences.<ref>[http://www.educationforum.co.uk/prehistoricmedicine.htm Medicine in Prehistoric Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
