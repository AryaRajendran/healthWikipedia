The '''Yale School of Medicine''' at [[Yale University]] is a [[private school|private]] [[medical school]] located in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States|U.S.]] It was founded in 1810 as The Medical Institution of Yale College, and formally opened its doors in 1813.

The primary teaching hospital for the school is [[Yale-New Haven Hospital]].  The school is home to the [[Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library]], one of the largest modern medical libraries, also known for its historical collections.  The faculty includes 62 [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] members, 40 [[Institute of Medicine]] investigators, and 16 [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] investigators.<ref name="Facts and Figures">{{cite web|title=Facts and Figures|url=http://facts.med.yale.edu/index.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref> 
[[U.S. News and World Report]] currently ranks the Yale School of Medicine 7th in the country for research, and 74th in primary care.<ref>http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/school-of-medicine-04016</ref> Entrance is highly selective; for the class of 2016, the school received 4,103 applications to fill its class of 100 students. The average GPA for admitted students was a 3.8, with an average MCAT of 36.3.<ref>http://facts.med.yale.edu/education/index.aspx</ref>

== Education==
The School of Medicine offers the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) [[Academic degree|degree]] and a Master of Medical Science (M.M.Sc.) degree through the [[Yale Physician Associate Program]] for prospective [[physician assistant]]s. [[Public health]] degrees are administered through the [[Yale School of Public Health]]. 

There are also joint degree programs with other disciplines at Yale, including the M.D/[[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) in conjunction with [[Yale Law School]]; the M.D./[[Master of Business Administration]] (M.B.A.) in conjunction with the [[Yale School of Management]]; the M.D./[[Master of Public Health]] (M.P.H.) in conjunction with the [[Yale School of Public Health]]; [[science]] or [[engineering]] in conjunction with the [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (M.D./[[Ph.D.]]); and the M.D./[[Master of Divinity]] (M.Div) in conjunction with [[Yale Divinity School]]. Students pursuing a tuition-free fifth year of research are eligible for the [[Master of Health Science]] degree. 

The M.D. program is notable for its assessment of student achievement. In particular, the school employs the so-called "Yale System" established by Dean Winternitz in the 1920s, wherein first- and second-year students are not [[Grade (education)|graded]] or [[Academic rank|ranked]] among their classmates. In addition, course [[examination]]s are anonymous, and are intended only for students' self-evaluation. Student performance is thus based on [[seminar]] participation, qualifying examinations (if a student fails, it is his or her responsibility to meet with a professor and arrange for an alternative assessment - passing grades are not released), clinical clerkship evaluations, and the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE). Prior to [[graduation]], students are required to submit a [[Dissertation|thesis]] based on [[original research]]. A hallmark of the Yale System is the unusual flexibility that it provides; with this flexibility comes great responsibility for the student to take an active role in directing his or her education according to individual interests.

Other key features of the Yale System include:
*commentary-based feedback from small group leaders
*an integrated Molecules to Systems course that includes Biochemistry, Physiology, and Cell Biology and the corresponding small group conferences (Biochemistry Conference, Physiology Case Conference, Histology Lab)
*early clinical exposure through the two-year Pre-Clinical Clerkship (PCC) course, in which students (in groups of 4) are assigned a physician mentor with whom they will learn the History and Physical Examination
*a surgery-based Human Anatomy course that focuses on teaching the principles of anatomy through case-based dissections involving surgical procedures rather than rote memorization
*a comprehensive student teaching program (Students Helping Students) in which second-year students review key concepts during optional evening sessions several times each week
*the opportunity to take electives that include advanced cell biology and neuroscience, global health, translational research, or any topic being taught through graduate or undergraduate programs at the University

More graduates of the Yale School of Medicine enter medical scholarship (including Ph.D. degrees in Medicine) as professors of medicine than those graduates of other medical schools.

==History==
[[File:Original Yale School of Medicine building Grove Street New Haven Connecticut.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Original building of Yale School of Medicine. Housed in what was formerly a hotel built by [[James Hillhouse]] at the corner of Grove and Prospect Streets. Originally leased by Yale, the building was later purchased with funds from the [[Connecticut State Legislature]].]]
In 18th century United States, credentials were not needed to practice medicine. Prior to the founding of the medical school, Yale graduates would train through an apprenticeship in order to become physicians.  Yale president [[Ezra Stiles]] conceived the idea of training physicians at Yale and ultimately, his successor [[Timothy Dwight IV]] helped to found the medical school.  The school was chartered in 1810 and opened in New Haven in 1813.  [[Nathan Smith (physician)|Nathan Smith]] (medicine and surgery) and [[Benjamin Silliman]] (pharmacology) were the first faculty members. Silliman was a professor of chemistry and taught at both Yale College and the Medical School.  The other two founding faculty were Jonathan Knight, anatomy, physiology and surgery and [[Eli Ives]], pediatrics.<ref name="founding">[http://info.med.yale.edu/library/exhibits/yalemed1/medinstyalecoll.html Founding of the Medical Institution at Yale College]</ref>

One of Yale's earliest medical graduates was Dr. Asaph Leavitt Bissell of [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], who graduated in 1815, a member of the school's second graduating class. Following his graduation, Dr. Bissell moved to [[Suffield, Connecticut]], a tobacco-farming community where his parents came from, and where he practiced as a country physician for the rest of his life.<ref>[http://info.med.yale.edu/library/news/exhibits/yalemed1/medinstyalecoll.html Medicine at Yale, 1701&ndash;1901, Founding of the Medical Institution of Yale College, Cushing/Whitney Medical Library, med.yale.edu]</ref> The saddlebags that Dr. Bissell carried in his practice, packed with paper packets and glass bottles, are today in the school's Medical Historical Library.<ref>[http://yalemedicine.yale.edu/ym_ws98/gallery/gallery_01.html When House Calls Were Horse Calls, John Curtis, Yale Medicine, Winter/Spring 1998]</ref>

The original building (at Grove and Prospect) later became Sheffield Hall, part of the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] (razed in 1931).  In 1860, the school moved to Medical Hall on York Street, near Chapel (this building was razed in 1957). In 1925, the school moved to its current campus, neighboring the hospital.  This campus includes the Sterling Hall of Medicine, Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine (1991, designed by [[Cesar Pelli]]), Anlyan Center (2003, designed by Payette and [[Venturi Scott Brown]]) and the Amistad Building (2007, designed by Herbert Newman).
