'''Epiglottitis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the [[epiglottis]] &mdash; the flap at the base of the [[tongue]] that keeps food from going into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (windpipe). Due to its place in the [[airway]], swelling of this structure can interfere with [[breath]]ing, and constitutes a [[medical emergency]]. Infection can cause the epiglottis to obstruct or completely close off the windpipe.

With the advent of the [[Hib vaccine]], the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of epiglottitis has decreased,<ref name="pmid7872480">{{cite journal |author=Keyser JS, Derkay CS |title=Haemophilus influenzae type B epiglottitis after immunization with HbOC conjugate vaccine |journal=Am J Otolaryngol |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=436–43 |year=1994 |pmid=7872480 |doi= 10.1016/0196-0709(94)90085-X|url=}}</ref> but the condition has not been eliminated.<ref name="pmid12663101">{{cite journal |author=McEwan J, Giridharan W, Clarke RW, Shears P |title=Paediatric acute epiglottitis: not a disappearing entity |journal=Int.

==Cause==
Epiglottitis involves [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] of the epiglottis, most often caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B, although some cases are attributable to ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]''.

==Signs and symptoms==
Epiglottitis commonly affects children, and it is associated with [[fever]], [[dysphagia|difficulty in swallowing]], drooling, hoarseness of voice, and typically stridor. Stridor is a sign of upper airways obstruction and is a surgical emergency. The child often appears acutely ill, anxious, and has very quiet shallow breathing with the head held forward, insisting on sitting up in bed. The early symptoms are insidious but rapidly progressive, and swelling of the throat may lead to [[cyanosis]] and [[asphyxiation]].{{citation needed|date=May 2007}} 

Epiglottitis is an airway emergency and intubation is required initially. Since the introduction of the ''[[Hemophilus influenzae]]'' (Hib) vaccination in many Western countries, childhood incidence has decreased while adult incidence has remained the same; the disease is thus becoming ''relatively'' more common in adults than children.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/763612-overview | title = Adult Epiglottitis | accessdate = 2010-12-30 | last = Bowman | first = Jeffrey | work = eMedicine | publisher = MedScape | quote = From 1996-2005, with the introduction of widespread H influenzae type b vaccination, an incidence of only 0.02 cases per 100,000 per year was seen. During this period, the incidence of acute epiglottitis in adults remained constant, at 1.9 cases per 100,000 per year.}}</ref> Modern cases in adults are most typically seen among abusers of [[crack cocaine]], and have a subacute presentation.

==Diagnosis==
[[Diagnosis]] is confirmed by direct inspection using [[laryngoscope|laryngoscopy]], although this may provoke airway [[spasm]]. If epiglottitis is suspected, attempts to visualise the epiglottis using a [[tongue depressor]] are strongly discouraged for this reason; therefore, diagnosis is made on basis of [[Laryngoscopy#Fiberoptic laryngoscopes|direct fibreoptic laryngoscopy]] carried out in controlled environment like an operating room. Imaging is rarely useful, and treatment should not be delayed for this test to be carried out.<ref name="gpnotebook.co.uk">http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=1980104722&linkID=14395&cook=yes</ref>

The epiglottis and [[arytenoids]] are cherry-red and swollen. The most likely [[Differential diagnosis|differential diagnostic]] candidates are [[croup]], [[peritonsillar abscess]], and [[retropharyngeal abscess]].

On [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] [[C-spine]] [[X-ray]], the [[thumbprint sign]] (or "thumb sign") describes a swollen, enlarged epiglottis;<ref>Jaffe JE. Acute Epiglottits. eMedicine.com. Available at: [http://www.emedicine.com/Radio/topic263.htm http://www.emedicine.com/Radio/topic263.htm]. Accessed on: December 21, 2010.</ref> usually with dilated [[hypopharynx]] and normal subglottic structures.

On CT imaging, the "halloween sign" describe a normal thickness epiglottis. It can safely excluded the acute epiglottitis. Furthermore, CT imaging can help to diagnose other conditions such as peritonsillar abscess or retropharyngeal abscess which had similar clinical features.<ref>Four cases of acute epiglottitis with a peritonsillar abscess.

==Management==
Epiglottitis may require urgent [[tracheal intubation]] to protect the airway, though this is not always the case. In some cases, epiglottitis requires the use of antibiotics while the patient benefits from a breathing tube.  In more serious cases, tracheal intubation is necessary. In such cases, immediate intubation is not advised, because the inflamed epiglottis is very sensitive and the care provider may irritate the epiglottis with the laryngoscope, causing the epiglottis to close off completely and forcing the use of a surgical airway opening ([[cricothyrotomy]]). Most children can be managed by keeping lights low and the child calm and in a position of comfort. Intubation may still become necessary if the child begins to rapidly [[decompensation|decompensate]] and show signs of impending [[respiratory arrest]] (decreased work of breathing with abnormal skin signs). If the patient's [[stridor]] becomes quieter, obstruction is likely to follow, and thus intubation should be expedited even further.<ref name="gpnotebook.co.uk"/>

In addition, patients should be given [[antibiotic]]s, such as second- or third-generation [[cephalosporin]]s, either alone or in combination with [[penicillin]] or [[ampicillin]] for [[streptococcus|streptococcal]] coverage. If allergy to [[Beta-lactam antibiotic|penicillins]] is present, [[Co-trimoxazole]] or [[clindamycin]] is an alternative. In household contacts of any unvaccinated child infected with H. influenzae, [[rifampicin]] is used as prophylaxis.

==Complications==
Some patients may develop [[pneumonia]], [[lymphadenopathy]], or [[septic arthritis]].

==Notable deaths==
[[George Washington]] is one historical figure thought to have died of epiglottitis. <ref>Peter Henriques, ''He Died as He Lived: The Death of George Washington'' (Mount Vernon, VA: Mount Vernon Ladies Association, 2000), 27-36.</ref>
