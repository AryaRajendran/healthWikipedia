'''Radiography''' is the use of [[X-ray]]s to view a non-uniformly composed material (i.e. of varying density and composition) such as the human body. A heterogeneous beam of X-rays is produced by an [[X-ray generator]] and is projected toward an object. The density and composition of each area determines how much of the ray is absorbed. The X-rays that pass through are captured behind the object by a detector (either [[photographic film]] or a [[X-ray detector|digital detector]]). The detector gives a 2D representation of of all the structures superimposed on each other.

In [[tomography]], the X-ray source and detector move to blur out structures not in the [[focal plane]]. [[Computed tomography]] (CT scanning), unlike plain-film tomography, generates 3D representations used computer-assisted reconstruction.

Applications of radiography include [[medical radiography]] and [[industrial radiography]]: if the object being examined is living, whether human or animal, it is regarded as medical;{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=What about plants?}} all other radiography is regarded as industrial radiographic work.

On November 8, 1895, German physics professor [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]] discovered the X-ray and noted that, while it could pass through human tissue, it could not pass through bone or metal.<ref name=ndt-history>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Radiography/Introduction/history.htm|accessdate=27 April 2013|title=History of Radiography|work=NDT Resource Center|publisher=Iowa State University}}</ref> Röntgen referred to the radiation as "X", to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. He received the first [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his discovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/karlsson/|title=The Nobel Prizes in Physics 1901–2000|last=Karlsson|first=Erik B.|date=9 February 2000|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=24 November 2011|location=Stockholm}}</ref>

There are conflicting accounts of his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers:<ref>{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Peters|year=1995|title=W.

Röntgen discovered X-rays' medical use when he made a picture of his wife's hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. The photograph of his wife's hand was the first ever photograph of a human body part using X-rays. When she saw the picture, she said, "I have seen my death."
<ref name=pbs />

The first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by [[John Hall-Edwards]] in [[Birmingham|Birmingham, England]] on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meggitt|first=Geoff|title=Taming the Rays: a history of radiation and protection|year=2008|publisher=lulu.com|isbn=1409246671|page=3 }}</ref> On 14 February 1896, Hall-Edwards also became the first to use X-rays in a surgical operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/xray|title=Major John Hall-Edwards|accessdate=2012-05-17|publisher=Birmingham City Council }}</ref>

The United States saw its medical X-ray made obtained using a [[discharge tube]] of Pulyui's design. In January 1896, on reading of Röntgen's discovery, Frank Austin of [[Dartmouth College]] tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the Pulyui tube produced X-rays. This was a result of Pulyui's inclusion of an oblique "target" of [[mica]], used for holding samples of [[fluorescent]] material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896 Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Gilman had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture, to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on [[Photographic plate|gelatin photographic plates]] obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in Röntgen's work.<ref name = PKS>{{cite journal |last = Spiegel |first = Peter K. |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = The first clinical X-ray made in America—100 years |journal = American Journal of Roentgenology |volume = 164 |issue = 1 |pages = 241–243 |publisher = American Roentgen Ray Society |location = Leesburg, VA |year = 1995 |url = http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/164/1/241.pdf |doi =10.2214/ajr.164.1.7998549 |accessdate = |pmid = 7998549 |issn = 1546-3141}}</ref>

X-rays were put to diagnostic use very early, before the dangers of ionizing radiation were discovered. Indeed, [[Marie Curie]] pushed for radiography to be used to treat wounded soldiers in World War I. Initially, many kinds of staff conducted radiography in hospitals, including physicists, photographers, doctors, nurses, and engineers. The medical speciality of radiology grew up over many years around the new technology. When new diagnostic tests were developed, it was natural for the [[radiologic technologist|radiographers]] to be trained in and to adopt this new technology. Radiographers now often do [[fluoroscopy]], [[computed tomography]], [[mammography]], [[ultrasound]], [[nuclear medicine]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] as well. Although a nonspecialist dictionary might define radiography quite narrowly as "taking X-ray images", this has long been only part of the work of "X-ray departments", radiographers, and radiologists. Initially, radiographs were known as roentgenograms,<ref>Ritchey, B; Orban, B: "The Crests of the Interdental Alveolar Septa," ''J Perio'' April 1953</ref> while''skiagrapher'' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] words for "shadow" and "writer") was used until about 1918 to mean ''radiographer''.

===Sources===
A number of sources of [[X-ray]] [[photon]]s have been used; these include [[X-ray generator]]s, [[betatron]]s, and [[Linear particle accelerator|linear accelerators]] (linacs). For [[gamma ray]]s, [[radioactive]] sources such as [[Iridium-192|<sup>192</sup>Ir]], [[Cobalt-60|<sup>60</sup>Co]] or [[Caesium-137|<sup>137</sup>Cs]] are used.

===Detectors===
A range of detectors including [[photographic film]], [[scintillator]] and [[semiconductor]] [[diode]] arrays have been used to collect images.

==Theory of X-ray attenuation==
X-ray photons used for medical purposes are formed by an event involving an electron, while gamma ray photons are formed from an interaction with the nucleus of an atom.<ref>Radiation Detection and Measurement 3rd Edition,
Glenn F. Knoll : Chapter 1, Page 1: John Wiley & Sons; 3rd Edition (26 January 21615461651: ISBN 0-471-07338-5</ref> In general, medical radiography is done using X-rays formed in an [[X-ray tube]]. Nuclear medicine typically involves gamma rays.

The types of [[electromagnetic radiation]] of most interest to radiography are X-ray and [[gamma radiation]]. This radiation is much more [[energy|energetic]] than the more familiar types such as [[radio waves]] and [[visible light]]. It is this relatively high energy which makes gamma rays useful in radiography but potentially hazardous to living organisms.
[[File:Darwinius radiographs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Radiographs of the ''[[Darwinius masillae|Darwinius]]'' fossil [[Ida (fossil)|Ida]].]]

The radiation is produced by X-ray tubes, high energy X-ray equipment or natural [[radioactive]] elements, such as [[radium]] and [[radon]], and artificially produced radioactive [[isotopes]] of elements, such as [[Cobalt#Isotopes|cobalt-60]] and [[Iridium#Isotopes|iridium-192]]. Electromagnetic radiation consists of [[oscillation|oscillating]] [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, but is generally depicted as a single [[sinusoidal]] wave. While in the past [[radium]] and [[radon]] have both been used for radiography, they have fallen out of use as they are radiotoxic [[alpha radiation]] emitters which are expensive; iridium-192 and cobalt-60 are far better photon sources. For further details see [[commonly used gamma emitting isotopes]].

Gamma rays are indirectly [[ionizing radiation]]. A gamma ray passes through [[matter]] until it undergoes an interaction with an [[atom]]ic particle, usually an [[electron]]. During this interaction, energy is transferred from the gamma ray to the electron, which is a directly ionizing particle. As a result of this energy transfer, the electron is liberated from the atom and proceeds to ionize matter by colliding with other electrons along its path. Other times, the passing gamma ray interferes with the orbit of the electron, and slows it, releasing energy but not becoming dislodged. The atom is not ionised, and the gamma ray continues on, although at a lower energy. This energy released is usually heat or another, weaker photon, and causes biological harm as a radiation burn. The chain reaction caused by the initial dose of radiation can continue after exposure, much like a [[sunburn]] continues to damage skin even after one is out of direct sunlight.

For the range of energies commonly used in radiography, the interaction between gamma rays and electrons occurs in two ways. One effect takes place where all the gamma ray's energy is transmitted to an entire atom. The gamma ray no longer exists and an electron emerges from the atom with [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] (motion in relation to force) energy almost equal to the gamma energy. This effect is predominant at low gamma energies and is known as the [[photoelectric effect]]. The other major effect occurs when a gamma ray interacts with an atomic electron, freeing it from the atom and imparting to it only a fraction of the gamma ray's kinetic energy. A secondary gamma ray with less energy (hence lower frequency) also emerges from the interaction. This effect predominates at higher gamma energies and is known as the [[Compton effect]].

In both of these effects the emergent electrons lose their kinetic energy by ionizing surrounding atoms. The density of [[ion]]s so generated is a measure of the energy delivered to the material by the gamma rays.

The most common means of measuring the variations in a beam of radiation is by observing its effect on a photographic film. This effect is the same as that of light, and the more intense the radiation is, the more it darkens, or [[Exposure (photography)|exposes]], the film. Other methods are in use, such as the ionizing effect measured electronically, its ability to discharge an electrostatically charged plate or to cause certain chemicals to [[florescence|fluoresce]] as in [[fluoroscopy]].
