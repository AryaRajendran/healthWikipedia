'''Breast cancer screening''' is the [[medical screening]] of [[asymptomatic]], apparently healthy women for [[breast cancer]] in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis. The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes.  A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.

A clinical or self [[breast exam]] involves feeling the breast for [[breast lump|lumps]] or other abnormalities.  Medical evidence, however, does not support its use in women with a typical risk for breast cancer.<ref name="Cochrane03"/>  

The use of [[mammography]] in [[universal screening]] for breast cancer is controversial for not reducing all-cause mortality and for causing harms through unnecessary treatments and medical procedures. Many national organizations recommend it for most older women. If [[screening mammography]] (as opposed to diagnostic mammography, which is used in a woman with symptoms that suggest breast cancer) is chosen for women at normal risk for breast cancer, it should only be done every two years in women between the ages of 50 and 74.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/USpstf/uspsbrca.htm |title=Breast Cancer: Screening |work=United States Preventive Services Task Force |accessdate=}}</ref> Several tools are available to help target breast cancer screening to older women with longer life expectancies.<ref>Schonberg M. [http://www.consultantlive.com/geriatrics/content/article/10162/1563530 Breast cancer screening: at what age to stop?] ''Consultant.'' 2010;50(May):196-205.</ref> Similar imaging studies can be performed with [[magnetic resonance imaging]].

Earlier, more aggressive, and more frequent screening is recommended for women at particularly high risk of developing breast cancer, such as those with a confirmed [[BRCA mutation|''BRCA'' mutation]], those who have previously had breast cancer, and those with a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer.

Abnormal findings on screening are further investigated by surgically removing a piece of the suspicious lumps ([[biopsy]]) to examine them under the microscope. [[Ultrasound]] may be used to guide the biopsy needle during the procedure. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] is used to guide treatment, but is not an established screening method for healthy women.

==Breast exam==

{{Main|Breast self-examination}}

Breast examination (either clinical breast exams (CBE) by a health care provider or by self exams) were once widely recommended.  They however are not supported by evidence and may, like mammography and other screening methods that produce false positive results,  contribute to harm.  The use of screening in women without symptoms and at low risk is thus controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Saslow D, Hannan J, Osuch J, ''et al.'' |title=Clinical breast examination: practical recommendations for optimizing performance and reporting |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=327–44 |year=2004 |pmid=15537576 |doi= 10.3322/canjclin.54.6.327|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.54.6.327/full}}</ref>

A 2003 [[Cochrane review]] found screening by breast self-examination or by clinical exam is not associated with lower death rates among women who report performing breast self-examination and does, like other breast cancer screening methods, increase harms, in terms of increased numbers of benign lesions identified and an increased number of biopsies performed.  They conclude  "screening by breast self-examination or physical examination cannot be recommended." <ref name=Cochrane03>{{cite journal |author=Kösters JP, Gøtzsche PC |title=Regular self-examination or clinical examination for early detection of breast cancer |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD003373 |year=2003 |pmid=12804462 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003373 |url= |editor1-last=Kösters |editor1-first=Jan Peter}}</ref>

==Mammography==
{{Main|Mammography}}
[[Mammography]] is a common screening method, since it is relatively fast and widely available in developed countries. Mammography is a type of [[radiography]] used on the breasts. It is typically used for two purposes: to aid in the diagnosis of a woman who is experiencing symptoms (called ''diagnostic mammography''), and for [[medical screening]] of apparently healthy women (called ''screening mammography''). 

Mammography is not very useful in finding breast tumors in dense breast tissue characteristic of women under 40 years. In women over 50 without dense breasts, breast cancers detected by screening mammography are usually smaller and less aggressive than those detected by patients or doctors as a breast lump. This is because the most aggressive breast cancers are found in dense breast tissue, which mammograms perform poorly on.  

The presumption was that by detecting the cancer in an earlier stage, women will be more likely to be cured by treatment. This assertion however has been challenged by recent reviews which have found the significance of these net benefits to be lacking for women at average risk of dying from breast cancer.

===Mechanism===
[[Image:Mammo breast cancer.jpg|thumb|right|Normal (left) versus cancerous (right) mammography image.]]

Screening mammography is usually recommended to women who are most likely to develop breast cancer.  In general, this means women with a personal or family history of breast cancer, and most older women, but not [[frailty syndrome|frail elderly]] women, who are unlikely to benefit from treatment.

Women who agree to be screened have their breasts X-rayed on a specialized X-ray machine.  This exposes the woman's breasts to a small amount of [[ionizing radiation]], which has a very small, but non-zero, chance of causing cancer.  

The X-ray image, called a ''radiograph'', is sent to a physician who specializes in interpreting these images, called a ''[[radiologist]]''.  The image may be on plain [[photographic film]] or [[digital mammography]] on a computer screen; despite the much higher cost of the digital systems, the two methods are generally considered equally effective.  The equipment may use a [[computer-aided diagnosis]] (CAD) system.

There is considerable variation in interpreting the images; the same image may be declared normal by one radiologist and suspicious by another.  It can be helpful to compare the images to any previously taken images, as changes over time may be significant.

If a suspicious signs are identified in the image, then the woman is usually recalled for a second mammogram, sometimes after waiting six months to see whether the spot is growing, or a [[biopsy]] of the breast.<ref>{{cite journal

===Effectiveness===
On balance, screening mammography in older women noticeably increases medical treatment and saves a small number of lives.  Usually, it has no effect on the outcome of the cancer.  Screening targeted towards women with above-average risk produces more benefit than screening of women at normal or low risk for breast cancer.

Firstly, some argue that its effect on the reduction of breast cancer mortality is overestimated. According to a clinical study conducted in Norway in 2010, screening mammography helped reduce the rate of death of breast cancer by about 2.4 deaths per 100,000 person-years among women between the ages of 50 and 69 years in the screening group compared with the non-screening group, which is accounted for only about a third of the total reduction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kalager M, Zelen M, Langmark F, Adami HO |title=Effect of screening mammography on breast-cancer mortality in Norway |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=363 |issue=13 |pages=1203–10 |year=2010 |month=September |pmid=20860502 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1000727 |url=}}</ref>    The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] review found a 15% reduction in mortality, but the absolute reduction in breast cancer mortality was 0.05%. Furthermore,a study published on the ''Preventive Medicine'' indicated that the magnitude of such effect might be overestimated in actual communities compared with the result predicted in randomized controlled trials due to factors such as increased self-selection rate among women concerned and increased effectiveness of adjuvant therapies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harris R, Yeatts J, Kinsinger L |title=Breast cancer screening for women ages 50 to 69 years a systematic review of observational evidence |journal=Prev Med |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=108–14 |year=2011 |month=September |pmid=21820465 |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2011.07.004 |url=}}</ref> Secondly, due to the harm from false positive screening and increased mortality from treatment complications, they could not conclude whether screening did more harm than good.<ref name=CD001877>{{cite journal |author=Gøtzsche PC, Nielsen M |title=Screening for breast cancer with mammography |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=1 |pages=CD001877 |year=2011 |pmid=21249649 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001877.pub4}}</ref> The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews updated research to state that advances in diagnosis and treatment might make mammography screening less effective today.

A 2011 [[Cochrane review]] estimated that mammography in women between 50 and 75 years old results in a [[relative risk reduction]] of death from breast cancer of 15% or an [[absolute risk reduction]] of 0.05% (however when analysis just the least biased trials there was no change in either overall mortality or breast cancer related mortality). Those who have mammograms however end up with increased surgeries, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other potentially procedures resulting from the over-detection of harmless lumps.  Many women will experience important psychological distress for many months because of false positive findings.  Half of suspicious findings will not become dangerous or will disappear over time. Consequently, the value of routine mammography in women at low or average risk is controversial.<ref name="CD001877"/> With unnecessary treatment of ten women for every one woman whose life was prolonged, the authors concluded that routine mammography may do more harm than good.<ref name="CD001877"/>  The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews updated research to state that advances in diagnosis and treatment make mammography screening less effective today.  They state screening is “no longer effective.”  They conclude that “it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet.<ref name="urlwww.cochrane.dk"/> The review also concluded that "half or more" of cancers detected with mammography would have disappeared spontaneously without treatment.  They found that most of the earliest cell changes found by mammography screening (carcinoma in situ) should be left alone because they would not have progressed into invasive cancer.<ref name="urlwww.cochrane.dk"/>

If 1,000 women in their 50s are screened every year for ten years, the following outcomes are considered typical in the developed world:<ref>{{cite book

* One woman's life will be extended due to earlier detection of breast cancer.
* 2–10 women will be [[overdiagnosed]] and needlessly treated for a cancer that would have stopped growing on its own or otherwise caused no harm during the woman's lifetime.
* 5–15 women will be treated for breast cancer, with the same outcome as if they had been detected after symptoms appeared.
* 250–500 will be incorrectly told they might have breast cancer ([[false positive]]).
* 125–250 will undergo [[breast biopsy]].

The outcomes are worse for women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, as they are far less likely to have a life-threatening breast cancer, and more likely to have dense breasts that make interpreting the mammogram more difficult.  Among women in their 60s, who have a somewhat higher rate of breast cancer, the proportion of positive outcomes to harms are better:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nelson HD, Tyne K, Naik A, Bougatsos C, Chan BK, Humphrey L |title=Screening for breast cancer: an update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |journal=Ann.

* For women in their 40s:  2,000 women [[number needed to treat|would need to be screened]] every year for 10 years to prevent one death from breast cancer.  1,000 of these women would experience false results and 250 healthy women would undergo unnecessary biopsies.
* For women in their 50s:  1,339 women would need to be screened for every year for 10 years to prevent one death from breast cancer.  Half of these women would experience false positives and one quarter would undergo unnecessary biopsies.
* For women in their 60s:  377 women would need to be screened for every year for 10 years to prevent one death from breast cancer.  Half of these women would experience false positives and one quarter would undergo unnecessary biopsies.

Mammography is not generally considered as an effective screening technique for women at average or low risk of developing cancer who are less than 50 years old.  For normal-risk women 40 to 49 years of age, the risks of mammography outweigh the benefits,<ref name="pmid17404354">{{cite journal |author=Armstrong K, Moye E, Williams S, Berlin JA, Reynolds EE |title=Screening mammography in women 40 to 49 years of age: a systematic review for the American College of Physicians |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=146 |issue=7 |pages=516–26 |year=2007 |pmid=17404354 |doi=}}</ref> and the US Preventive Services Task Force says that the evidence in favor of routine screening of women under the age of 50 is "weak".<ref name="pmid19920272" /> Part of the difficulty in interpreting mammograms in younger women stems from breast density. Radiographically, a dense breast has a preponderance of glandular tissue, and younger age or [[estrogen]] [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] contribute to mammographic breast density. After menopause, the breast glandular tissue gradually is replaced by fatty tissue, making mammographic interpretation much more accurate.

===Recommendations===
Different countries and organizations make different recommendations about screening mammography. The most important differences are the age at which it should begin and how frequently it should be performed in women at typical risk for developing breast cancer. 

In the UK, all women are invited for screening once every three years beginning at age 50. 

As of 2009 the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends that women over the age of 50 receive mammography once every two years.<ref name="pmid19920272">{{cite journal |author= |title=Screening for breast cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=151 |issue=10 |pages=716–26, W–236 |year=2009 |month=November |pmid=19920272 |doi=10.1059/0003-4819-151-10-200911170-00008 |url= |author1= US Preventive Services Task Force}}</ref>  The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews updated research to state that advances in diagnosis and treatment make mammography screening less effective today.  They state screening is "no longer effective."  They conclude that "it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend" for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet.<ref name="urlwww.cochrane.dk"/>

Some other organizations recommend mammograms begin as early as age 40 in normal-risk women, and take place more frequently, up to once each year.

Women at higher risk may benefit from earlier or more frequent screening. Women with one or more first-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter) with premenopausal breast cancer often begin screening at an earlier age, perhaps at an age 10 years younger than the age when the relative was diagnosed with breast cancer.

===Breast density===
Breast density is the density of tissue composition of the breasts.  Breasts are made up of breast tissue, connective tissue, and adipose (fat) tissue.  The amount of each type of tissue varies from woman to woman.  Breast and connective tissues are denser than adipose tissue on a mammogram, so a woman with more breast tissue is said to have greater breast density.  Breast density is assessed by mammography and expressed as a percentage of the mammogram occupied by radiologically dense tissue (percent mammographic density, or PMD).<ref>http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/13/6/223[''Mammographic density and breast cancer risk: current understanding and future prospects'']</ref> About half of middle-aged women have dense breasts, and breasts generally become less dense as they age.  Higher breast density is associated with higher breast cancer risk in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. 

Breast cancers are difficult to detect through mammograms in women with high breast density because most cancers and dense breast tissues have a similar appearance on a mammogram.  As a result, higher breast density is associated with a higher rate of false negatives (missed cancers).<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Nehmat Houssami,Karla Kerlikowske  |title = The Impact of Breast Density on Breast Cancer Risk and Breast Screening | journal = Current Breast Cancer Reports | volume = 4 | pages = 161–168 | date = June 2012 }}</ref>

===Health programs===
In 2005, about 68% of all U.S. women age 40–64 had a mammogram in the past two years (75% of women with private [[health insurance#Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]], 56% of women with [[Medicaid]] insurance, 38% of currently uninsured women, and 33% of women uninsured for more than 12 months).<ref name="Ward 2008">{{cite journal

The Australian national breast screening program, BreastScreen Australia, was commenced in the early 1990s and invites women aged 50–69 to screening every 2 years. No routine clinical examination is performed, and the cost of screening is free to the point of diagnosis.

The Singapore national breast screening program, BreastScreen Singapore, is the only publicly funded national breast screening program in Asia, and enrolls women aged 50–64 for screening every two years. Like the Australian system, no clinical examination is performed routinely. Unlike most national screening systems, however, clients have to pay half of the cost of the screening mammogram; this is in line with the Singapore health system's core principle of co-payment for all health services.

===Criticisms===
Most women significantly overestimate both their own risk of dying from breast cancer and the effect screening mammography could have on it.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news

| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref>  Some researchers worry that if women correctly understood that screening programs offer a small, but statistically significant benefit, more women would refuse to participate.<ref name=BBC />

The contribution of mammography to the early diagnosis of cancer is controversial, and for those found with benign lesions, mammography can create a high psychological and financial cost.  Most women participating in mammography screening programs accept the risk of false positive recall, and the majority do not find it very distressing.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Many patients find the recall very frightening, and are intensely relieved to discover that it was a false positive, as about 90% of women do.<ref>Welch, 2011.  pp. 177–178.</ref>

A major effect of routine breast screening is to greatly increase the rate of early breast cancer detection, in particular for non-invasive [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS), sometimes called "pre-breast cancer", which is almost never forms a lump and which generally cannot be detected except through mammography. While this ability to detect such very early breast malignancies is at the heart of claims that screening mammography can improve survival from breast cancer, it is also controversial. This is because a very large proportion of such cases will not progress to kill the patient, and thus mammography cannot be genuinely claimed to have saved any lives in such cases; in fact, it would lead to increased sickness and unnecessary surgery for such patients.

Consequently, finding and treating many cases of DCIS represents [[overdiagnosis]] and [[overtreatment]].  Treatment is given to all women with DCIS because it is currently impossible to predict which patients with DCIS will have an indolent, non-fatal course, and which few will inevitably progress to invasive cancer and premature death if left untreated. Consequently, all patients with DCIS are treated in much the same way, with at least wide local excision, and sometimes mastectomy if the DCIS is very extensive. The cure rate for DCIS if treated appropriately is extremely high, partly because the majority of DCIS cases were harmless in the first place. 

The phenomenon of finding pre-invasive malignancy or nonmalignant benign disease is commonplace in all forms of cancer screening, including [[pap smear]]s for cervical cancer, [[fecal occult blood]] testing for colon cancer, and [[prostate-specific antigen]] testing for prostate cancer. All of these tests have the potential to detect asymptomatic cancers, and all of them have a high rate of false positives and lead to invasive procedures that are unlikely to benefit the patient.

==Molecular breast imaging==

Molecular breast imaging is a nuclear medicine technique that is currently under study. It shows promising results for imaging people with dense breast tissue and may have accuracies comparable to MRI.<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=M|coauthors=Rhodes, D, Hruska, C|title=Molecular breast imaging.|journal=Expert review of anticancer therapy|date=2009 Aug|volume=9|issue=8|pages=1073–80|pmid=19671027|doi=10.1586/era.09.75|pmc=2748346}}</ref> MBI is claimed to be cheaper than MRI.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://newsblog.mayoclinic.org/2008/09/03/breast-cancer-molecular-breast-imaging-mammography/ |title=Molecular Breast Imaging More Effective than Mammography at Detecting Cancer in High-Risk Women with Dense Breasts |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Ultrasonography==
[[Medical ultrasonography]] is a diagnostic aid to mammography. Adding ultrasonography testing for women with dense breast tissue increases the detection of breast cancer, but also increases false positives.<ref name="pmid18477782">{{cite journal| author=Berg WA, Blume JD, Cormack JB, Mendelson EB, Lehrer D, Böhm-Vélez M et al.| title=Combined screening with ultrasound and mammography vs mammography alone in women at elevated risk of breast cancer. | journal=JAMA | year= 2008 | volume= 299 | issue= 18 | pages= 2151–63 | pmid=18477782 | doi=10.1001/jama.299.18.2151 | pmc=2718688   }}  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=18697289 Review in: J Fam Pract. 2008 Aug;57(8):508]</ref><ref name="pmid22474203">{{cite journal| author=Berg WA, Zhang Z, Lehrer D, Jong RA, Pisano ED, Barr RG et al.| title=Detection of breast cancer with addition of annual screening ultrasound or a single screening MRI to mammography in women with elevated breast cancer risk. | journal=JAMA | year= 2012 | volume= 307 | issue= 13 | pages= 1394–404 | pmid=22474203 | doi=10.1001/jama.2012.388 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22474203  }}</ref>

==Magnetic resonance imaging==
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) has been shown to detect cancers not visible on mammograms. The chief strength of breast MRI is its very high [[negative predictive value]].<!-- sorry, I haven't figured out references yet. getting to this. --> A negative MRI can rule out the presence of cancer to a high degree of certainty, making it an excellent tool for screening in patients at high genetic risk or radiographically dense breasts, and for pre-treatment staging where the extent of disease is difficult to determine on mammography and ultrasound. MRI can diagnose benign proliferative change, fibroadenomas, and other common benign findings at a glance, often eliminating the need for costly and unnecessary biopsies or surgical procedures. The spatial and temporal resolution of breast MRI has increased markedly in recent years, making it possible to detect or rule out the presence of small ''in situ'' cancers, including [[ductal carcinoma in situ]].

However, breast MRI has long been regarded to have disadvantages. For example, although it is 27–36% more sensitive, it has been claimed to be less specific than mammography.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hrung J, Sonnad S, Schwartz J, Langlotz C | title = Accuracy of MR imaging in the work-up of suspicious breast lesions: a diagnostic meta-analysis | journal = Acad Radiol | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 387–97 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10410164 | doi = 10.1016/S1076-6332(99)80189-5}}</ref> As a result, MRI studies may have more [[Type I and type II errors|false positives]] (up to 30%), which may have undesirable financial and psychological costs. It is also a relatively expensive procedure, and one which requires the intravenous injection of [[gadolinium]], which has been implicated in a rare reaction called [[nephrogenic systemic fibrosis]]. Although NSF is extremely uncommon, patients with a history of renal disease may not be able to undergo breast MRI. Further, an MRI may not be used for screening patients with a pacemaker or breast reconstruction patients with a tissue expander due to the presence of metal.

Proposed indications for using MRI for screening include:<ref>{{cite journal | author = Morrow M | title = Magnetic resonance imaging in breast cancer: one step forward, two steps back? | journal = JAMA | volume = 292 | issue = 22 | pages = 2779–80 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15585740 | doi = 10.1001/jama.292.22.2779}}</ref>
*Strong family history of breast cancer
*Patients with BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 oncogene mutations
*Evaluation of women with breast implants
*History of previous lumpectomy or breast biopsy surgeries
*Axillary metastasis with an unknown primary tumor
*Very dense or scarred breast tissue

In addition, breast MRI may be helpful for screening in women who have had breast augmentation procedures involving intramammary injections of various foreign substances that may mask the appearances of breast cancer on mammography and/or ultrasound. These substances include [[silicone oil]] and  [[polyacrylamide gel]].

==BRCA testing==
[[Genetic testing]] does not detect cancers, but may reveal a propensity to develop cancer.  Women who are known to have a higher risk of developing breast cancer usually undertake more aggressive screening programs.

A [[clinical practice guideline]] by the [[US Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends against routine referral for [[genetic counseling]] or routine testing for [[BRCA mutation]]s, on fair evidence that the harms outweigh the benefits.<ref name='USPSTF Ratings'>{{cite paper
