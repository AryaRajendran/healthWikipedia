'''Nausea''' ([[Latin]] ''nausea'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ναυσία}} - ''nausia'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dnausi%2Fa ναυσία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> "ναυτία" - ''nautia'', [[motion sickness]]", "feeling sick," "queasy" or "wamble"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dnauti%2Fa ναυτία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33156 |title=Wamble definition  |work= MedTerms Medical Dictionary |accessdate=}}</ref>) is a sensation of unease and discomfort in the upper [[stomach]] with an involuntary urge to [[vomiting|vomit]].<ref name=AFP/> It often, but not always, precedes vomiting. A person can suffer nausea without vomiting. (Greek ναῦς - ''naus'', "ship"; ναυσία started as meaning "[[seasickness]]".)

Nausea is a [[non-specific symptom]], which means that it has many possible causes.  Some common causes of nausea are [[motion sickness]], [[dizziness]], [[migraine]], [[fainting]], [[gastroenteritis]] (stomach infection) or [[food poisoning]]. Side effects of many medications including cancer chemotherapy, [[nauseant]]s or [[morning sickness]] in early pregnancy. Nausea may also be caused by [[anxiety]], [[disgust]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name=S1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stress-symptoms/SR00008_D |title=Stress symptoms: Effects on your body, feelings and behavior|work= Mayo Clinic }}</ref><ref name=S2>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45852/ |title=Diagnostic Criteria: Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Anxiety|work= PubMed }}</ref><ref name=S3>{{Cite web|url=http://en.diagnosispro.com/disease_information-for/clinical-manifestations-stress-emotional-physical/19955-104.html |title=Disease Information for Stress/Emotional/Physical: Clinical Manifestations |work=}}</ref>

Medications taken to prevent nausea are called [[antiemetic]]s and include [[diphenhydramine]], [[metoclopramide]] and [[ondansetron]].

==Differential diagnosis==
There are many causes of nausea.  One organization listed 700 in 2009.<ref name=Diff>{{Cite web|url=http://en.diagnosispro.com/differential_diagnosis-for/nausea/37707-154.html |title=Differential Diagnosis for Nausea |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  [[Gastroenteritis|Gastrointestinal infections]] (37%) and [[food poisoning]] are the two most common causes.<ref name=AFP>{{Cite journal|author=Metz A, Hebbard G |title=Nausea and vomiting in adults--a diagnostic approach |journal=Aust Fam Physician |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=688–92 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17885699 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name=AFPHelena07/>  While side effects from medications (3%) and pregnancy are also relatively frequent.<ref name=AFP/><ref name=AFPHelena07/> In 10% of people the cause remains unknown.<ref name=AFPHelena07/>

===Food poisoning===
[[Food poisoning]] usually causes an abrupt onset of nausea and vomiting one to six hours after ingestion of contaminated food and lasts for one to two days.<ref name=USA07>{{Cite journal|author=Scorza K, Williams A, Phillips JD, Shaw J |title=Evaluation of nausea and vomiting |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=76–84 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17668843 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  It is due to toxins produced by [[bacteria]] in food.<ref name=USA07/>

===Medications===
Many medications can potentially cause nausea.<ref name=USA07/>  Some of the most frequently associated include cancer and system [[chemotherapy]] regimens and [[general anaesthesia|general anaesthetic agents]].

===Pregnancy===
Nausea or "[[morning sickness]]" is common during early [[pregnancy]] but may occasionally continue into the second and third trimesters. In the first trimester nearly 80% of women have some degree of nausea.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Koch KL, Frissora CL |title=Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy |journal=Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=201–34, vi |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12635417 |doi= 10.1016/S0889-8553(02)00070-5|url=}}</ref>  Pregnancy should therefore be considered as a possible cause of nausea in any women of child bearing age.<ref name=USA07/>  While usually it is mild and self-limiting severe cases known as [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] may require treatment.<ref name=preg07>{{Cite journal|author=Sheehan P |title=Hyperemesis gravidarum--assessment and management |journal=Aust Fam Physician |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=698–701 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17885701 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Disequilibrium===
A number of conditions involving balance such as [[motion sickness]] and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] can lead to nausea and vomiting.

===Stress and depression===
Nausea may be caused by [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

===Potentially serious===
While most causes of nausea are not serious, some serious causes do occur.  These include: [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[brain tumor]], surgical problems, [[heart attack]],<ref>O’Connor RE, Brady W, Brooks SC, Diercks D, Egan J, Ghaemmaghami C, Menon V, O’Neil BJ, Travers AH, Yannopoulos D.

==Diagnostic approach==
Often no investigations are needed, however basic lab tests may be appropriate.<ref name=AFP/>  If a bowel obstruction is possible, abdominal x-rays may be useful.<ref name=AFP/>

==Treatment==
If dehydration is present due to loss of fluids from severe vomiting and/or accompanying [[diarrhea]], [[rehydration]] with oral electrolyte solutions is preferred.<ref name=AFP/>  If this is not effective or possible, intravenous rehydration may be required.<ref name=AFP/>

===Medications===
{{Main|Antiemetic}}
[[Dimenhydrinate]] (Gravol) is an inexpensive and effective medication for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kranke P, Morin AM, Roewer N, Eberhart LH |title=Dimenhydrinate for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Acta Anaesthesiol Scand |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=238–44 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11939912 |doi= 10.1034/j.1399-6576.2002.t01-1-460303.x|url=}}</ref>  [[Meclozine]] is another [[antihistamine]] [[antiemetic]]. In certain people, [[cannabinoids]] may be effective in reducing chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Tramèr MR, Carroll D, Campbell FA, Reynolds DJ, Moore RA, McQuay HJ |title=Cannabinoids for control of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting: quantitative systematic review |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7303 |pages=16–21 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11440936 |pmc=34325 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.323.7303.16|url=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.drugpolicy.org/marijuana/medical/challenges/litigators/medical/conditions/nausea.cfm | title = Medicinal Uses of Marijuana: Nausea, Emesis and Appetite Stimulation | accessdate = 2007-08-02 | year = 2001 | author = Drug Policy Alliance}}</ref>  [[Ondansetron]] (Zofran) is effective for nausea and vomiting.<ref name=USA07/>  [[Pyridoxine]] or [[metoclopramide]] are the first line treatments for pregnancy related nausea and vomiting.<ref name=preg07/>

==Prognosis==
While short-term nausea and vomiting are generally harmless, they may sometimes indicate a more serious condition. When associated with prolonged vomiting, it may lead to [[dehydration]] and/or dangerous [[electrolyte]] imbalances. Repeated intentional vomiting, characteristic of [[bulimia]], can cause [[stomach acid]] to wear away at the [[tooth enamel|enamel]] in teeth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/bulimia-nervosa/bulimia-nervosa-topic-overview|title=Bulimia Nervosa-Topic Overview|work=WebMD|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref>
