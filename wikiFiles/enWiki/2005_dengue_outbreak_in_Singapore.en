In the '''2005 dengue outbreak in Singapore''', a significant rise in the number of [[dengue fever]] cases was reported in [[Singapore]], becoming the country's worst health crisis since the 2003 [[SARS]] epidemic. In October 2005, there were signs that the dengue fever outbreak had peaked, as the number of weekly cases had declined and the outbreak of this [[infectious disease]] declined by the end of 2005.

In 2005, there were a total of 13,984 dengue fever cases and 19 people died. The outbreak peaked in the months of September and October, when it caused hospitals to cancel some elective surgery due to the need to allocate more beds for dengue patients.

Dengue fever is transmitted to humans by the [[mosquito]] ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''. The virus can cause fever, severe headache, joint and muscular pains, vomiting, [[diarrhea]] and rashes. There is no commercially ready [[vaccine]] for dengue.

Singapore's health-care system is helping to maintain a low fatality rate at 0.1% (2005), which is lower than [[Southeast Asia]]'s regional average of 0.8% in 2004, according to the [[World Health Organization]].

The [[National Environment Agency]] said that the dengue fever problem may be worsening because of higher temperatures and changes in viral strains. The mean temperature has risen to 28.2 °C (82.8 °F) from 27.8 °C in 2003.

In the second week of September, more than 100 new cases were reported daily and many were admitted to public hospitals.

[[Minster of Health (Singapore)|Health Minister]] [[Khaw Boon Wan]] said that one of the concerns is that more Singaporeans are infected with Dengue Type 3, which is a new strain of the dengue virus.

Some experts, such as Dr [[Paul Reitner]], Professor of [[Entomology]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[France]], suggested that Singapore's success in suppressing the dengue has partly contributed to this year sudden increase in dengue cases. The population born over the last two decades has a low [[herd immunity]] and therefore more susceptible to the virus. [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/171227/1/.html]

==Inter-ministerial and inter-agency committees==
[[File:Dengue hotspot.png|thumb|right|300px|Dengue hotspots: geographical distribution of dengue cases.]]
[[File:Mosquito larva.jpg|thumb|right|A mosquito larva]]

In September, an inter-ministerial committee headed by [[Minister for the Environment and Water Resources]], [[Yaacob Ibrahim]], was formed to tackle the dengue outbreak. [[Yaacob Ibrahim]] will deliver a ministerial statement on the issue in the [[Parliament of Singapore|parliament]] on September 19.
[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/167418/1/.html]

An inter-agency Dengue Coordination Committee and a community-centred Dengue Watch Committee have also been established. [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/167707/1/.html] The Dengue Coordination Committee involves the permanent secretaries of the Environment, Health, and National Development ministries, and Chief Executive Officers of key government statutory boards, and it aims to ensure that the various policy initiatives by the various ministries are well-coordinated. [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) would make sure that bus-stops, [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] stations, construction sites are free of mosquito breeding. [[Singapore Land Authority]] (SLA) were also stepping up their checks on vacant state land and properties, while the [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) and town councils are stepping up the cleaning of common areas.

The Dengue Watch Committee is chaired by [[Khoo Tsai Kee]] who is the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment and Water Resources. He will coordinate with the five mayors in Singapore to reach out to the 84 advisers and the town councils, to oversee dengue prevention measures at the community level.

A panel of experts had also been set up to advise the government on anti-dengue measures.  The panel is chaired by Dr [[Chee Yam Cheng]], Clinical Professor and Assistant Chief Executive Officer of [[National Healthcare Group]].

==Preventive measures==
[[File:Mosquito larvae.jpg|thumb|200px|Larvae in stagnant water]]

{{Singapore in 2005}}

Singapore launched a number of measures to contain the dengue outbreak, including public awareness campaigns and regular [[fogging]] with [[insecticide]]s. 4,200 volunteers, 970 environmental control officers hired by construction sites, 350 so-called ''"mozzie busters"'' made up of girl guides and scouts, have participated in the preventive efforts.

The [[Ministry of Health (Singapore)|Ministry of Health]] stepped up its monitoring of common mosquito breeding sites and launched an online map listing "hotspots" for the insects. Residents who allow [[mosquito]]es to breed in their homes can be fined between S$100 to S$200, and heavier penalties may be issued for construction sites found with standing water. The number of officers conducting such checks have tripled since the start of the year to 360, and may increase to 510 by December.

The [[National Environment Agency]] has allocated an additional S$7.5 million on top of its existing S$2.5 million budget to clear drains of [[stagnant water]] where mosquitoes breed.  [[Singapore Land Authority]] has also stepped up its checks on vacant state properties.

On 10 September, [[National Environment Agency]] started collecting blood samples from residents of [[Sims Avenue]], a dengue hotspot, to help track the infection. The residents were asked to provide voluntarily 5 millilitres of blood sample and a swab of [[saliva]] for the study. The samples were to be analysed for [[antibodies]] against dengue infection in the last 2 months.

The [[National Parks Board]] (NParks) is considering removing broad-leafed plants which may breed mosquitoes. These plants like [[palm tree]]s or any plants with [[axil]]s capable of trapping water, are potential breeding sites. Holes in tree trunks is also a concern, and NParks workers have been filling these holes with sands. NParks has engaged 16 pest companies to stop mosquito breeding in the parks it manages. Due to the dengue threat, some schools are cancelling excursions to the parks.

===Community response===

[[Minster of Health (Singapore)|Health Minister]] [[Khaw Boon Wan]] urged the public to help in the fight against the disease. As households are common breeding grounds for [[mosquito]]s and are less accessible for fogging, residents can help by checking for stagnant water in their households and neighbourhood and ensuring no blockage of drains. Due to the short life cycle of ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' [[mosquito]]s (7 to 10 days), frequent checks are necessary to eradicate dengue. These checks only take several minutes and could potentially save lives.

Dr Kevin Palmer, [[World Health Organization]]'s regional adviser for mosquito-borne diseases, said that it is important for ordinary residents to play their part. He added that fogging alone was not effective as winds could blow the insecticide away. [http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4136,94306,00.html] [[Yaacob Ibrahim]] also said that fogging only kills adult mosquitoes, but not the [[larva]] and therefore less effective compared to removing breeding sites. [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/167709/1/.html]

Singapore residents are also arming themselves with anti-mosquito products including [[insecticide]]s, [[Insect repellent|repellents]] and electronic mosquito traps. For repellents, experts are recommending those with an active ingredients, such as [[DEET]] which provide more effective and lasting protection.

Some residents are buying a potted plant called [[Citronella]] and placing it at their home. The perennial grass plant, imported from [[Cameron Highlands]], gives off a strong lemon-like fragrance which repels mosquitoes.

To prevent the spread of the virus, those who are already infected with dengue are encouraged to use mosquito repellents, wear long-sleeved clothing and sleep under mosquito nets to prevent mosquitoes from biting them again and spreading the virus to others.

===Weekend blitz===

====First blitz, 17–18 September====
On the weekend of 17–18 September, more than 700 officers and volunteers launched a house-to-house campaign to remove breeding sites at four neighbourhoods, in what Minister [[Mah Bow Tan]] described as ''"sort of a carpet-combing exercise"''. The four neighbourhoods involved in the weekend blitz are [[Ang Mo Kio]], [[Yishun]], [[Hougang]] and [[Marsiling]], which are among the worst affected regions.

In this ''"search-and-destroy"'' operation, mosquito-fighting ''"commandos"'' combed the streets, checked the drains, looked at the bins and the roof structures at all estates to seek and destroy breeding sites. They found 172 mosquito-breeding sites, mainly flower pot trays, water containers, litters and tree holes.

====Second blitz, 24–25 September====
In the following weekend, five more areas were added to the weekend blitz, namely [[Toa Payoh]]/[[Bishan]], [[Tampines]], [[Choa Chu Kang]], [[Bedok]] and [[Boon Lay]]/[[Jurong]], and more than 200 breeding sites were found.

====Third blitz, 1–2 October====
More than one thousand volunteers were involved in this third blitz to cover areas including [[Kallang]], [[West Coast, Singapore|West Coast]] and [[Jurong East]]. 187 breeding sites were found and removed.[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/171134/1/.html]

==Treatment==
In September, Singapore experienced a drastic rise of dengue cases. In the first week alone, 547 new cases were reported and many required hospital care. As the treatment lasts about 10 days, many hospitals across Singapore are experiencing shortage of hospitals beds. To cope with the strain, hospitals are postponing non-emergency operations to accommodate the dengue patients.

General practitioners and polyclinics are on high alert to check for cases of dengue and are ordering more patients to have their blood tested for suspected dengue. The test, which takes fifteen minutes, is based on [[platelet]] count;
dengue sufferers have 100,000 or lower platelet count as compared to 140,000 to 400,000 of a healthy person. If a suspected dengue is diagnosed, the patient will be referred to a hospital for more accurate testing.

==Dengue diagnostic kits==
In July 2005, a Singapore life science start-up company [[Veredus Laboratories]] launched a DNA- and RNA-based diagnostic kits for dengue, [[avian influenza]] and [[malaria]]. The kit is based on technologies licensed from [[A*STAR]] and the [[National University of Singapore]]. [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/160329/1/.html]

Another Singapore company [[Attogenix Biosystems]] has also developed a biochip called [[AttoChip]] which has successfully undergone an independent clinical trial conducted by [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]] and is 98 percent accurate. The AttoChip identifies genes, viruses and bacteria-causing
diseases from a blood sample. It can detect the presence of the dengue virus within two to three days of the onset of the virus. [http://www.tec.gov.sg/dengue_today.html][http://www.dso.org.sg/home/newsevents/newsevents_media_showpage.aspx?id=24]

==Natural Cure==
The juice of the humble papaya leaf has been seen to arrest the destruction of platelets that has been the cause for so many deaths this dengue season. Ayurveda researchers have found that enzymes in the papaya leaf can fight a host of viral infections, not just dengue, and can help regenerate platelets and white blood cells.[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-12/kolkata/33788187_1_platelet-dengue-patients-papaya]
