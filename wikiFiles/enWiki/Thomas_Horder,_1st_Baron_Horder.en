'''Thomas Jeeves Horder, 1st Baron Horder''', [[Royal Victoria Order|GCVO]] (7 January 1871 – 13 August 1955) was an English physician recognized as a leading clinician and diagnostician of his day. 

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Thomas Jeeves Horder was born on 7 January 1871, the son of draper Albert Horder, in [[Shaftesbury]], [[Dorset]]. Jeeves was his mother's maiden name. He was educated privately, and at the [[University of London]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London.

===Career===
Horder began his career at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] and, when still quite young, successfully made a difficult diagnosis on [[King Edward VII]] which made his reputation. His patients were to include every British monarch except [[Edward VIII]] from Edward VII to [[Elizabeth II]]. They also included two prime ministers, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Bonar Law]] and labour leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]].

He was involved in many official committees including advising the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] during [[World War II]]. After the war he opposed many of [[Aneurin Bevan]]'s plans for a national health service and may have helped get some of those less palatable to the medical profession modified.

He also held the positions of Deputy Lieutenant County of Hampshire; [[Physician to the Queen|Extra Physician to the Queen]] (formerly Extra Physician to King George VI); and Consulting Physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital (1912–1936). He was created Baron Horder on 23 January 1933.

Horder served as president of the [[Cremation Society of Great Britain]] from 1940 to his death in 1955.

===Marriage and children===
In 1902 Horder married Geraldine Rose Doggett (died 1954), of Newnham Manor, Hertfordshire. Their son was the publisher [[Thomas Mervyn Horder, 2nd Baron Horder]] (died 1997).

===Death and afterward===
He lived for many years at [[Steep]] near [[Petersfield, Hampshire]] where he died on 13 August 1955.
