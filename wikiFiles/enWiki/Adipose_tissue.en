{{see also|fat}}
In biology, '''adipose tissue''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|d|ɨ|ˌ|p|oʊ|s}}) or '''body fat''' or just '''fat''' is loose [[connective tissue]] composed mostly of [[adipocyte]]s. In addition to adipocytes, adipose tissue contains the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and variety of immune cells (i.e. [[adipose tissue macrophages]] (ATMs)). Adipose tissue is derived from preadipocytes. Its main role is to store [[energy]] in the form of [[lipid]]s, although it also cushions and [[Thermal insulation|insulates]] the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major [[endocrine]] organ,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kershaw EE, Flier JS |title=Adipose tissue as an endocrine organ |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=2548–56 |year=2004 |pmid=15181022 |doi=10.1210/jc.2004-0395}}</ref> as it produces [[hormone]]s such as [[leptin]], [[estrogen]], [[resistin]], and the [[cytokine]] [[TNF-alpha|TNFα]]. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. [[Obesity]] or being [[overweight]] in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight, but on the amount of body fat—to be specific, adipose tissue{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. The two types of adipose tissue are [[white adipose tissue]] (WAT) and [[brown adipose tissue]] (BAT).  The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the [[adipose gene]]. Adipose tissue, more specifically brown adipose tissue, was first identified by the Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gessner]] in 1551.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18719573|year=2008|last1=Cannon|first1=B|last2=Nedergaard|first2=J|title=Developmental biology: Neither fat nor flesh|volume=454|issue=7207|pages=947–8|doi=10.1038/454947a|journal=Nature}}</ref>

==Anatomical features==
===Humans===
In humans, adipose tissue is located beneath the [[human skin|skin]] ([[subcutaneous fat]]), around internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s ([[visceral fat]]), in bone marrow ([[yellow bone marrow]]) and in breast tissue.  Adipose tissue is found in specific locations, which are referred to as adipose depots. Apart from adipocytes, which comprise the highest percentage of cells within adipose tissue, other cell types are present collectively termed stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells. SVF includes preadipocytes, [[fibroblast]]s, adipose tissue [[macrophage]]s, and [[endothelial cell]]s. Adipose tissue contains many small [[blood vessel]]s. In the [[integumentary system]], which includes the skin, it accumulates in the deepest level, the [[subcutaneous]] layer, providing insulation from heat and cold.  Around organs, it provides protective padding. However, its main function is to be a reserve of lipids, which can be burned to meet the energy needs of the body and to protect it from excess glucose by storing triglycerides produced by the liver from sugars, although some evidence suggests that most lipids synthesized from carbohydrates occurs in the adipose tissue itself.<ref name="livervsadipose">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9174472\],Hepatic and whole-body fat synthesis in humans during carbohydrate overfeeding.</ref> Adipose depots in different parts of the body have different biochemical profiles. Under normal conditions, it provides feedback for hunger and diet to the brain.

===Mice===
[[File:Fatmouse.jpg|right|thumb|The [[obesity|obese]] [[mouse]] on the left has large stores of adipose tissue. For comparison, a mouse with a normal amount of adipose tissue is shown on the right.]]

[[mouse|Mice]] have eight major adipose depots, four of which are within the [[abdominal cavity]]. The paired gonadal depots are attached to the [[uterus]] and [[ovary|ovaries]] in females and the [[epididymis]] and [[testes]] in males; the paired retroperitoneal depots are found along the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] wall of the abdomen, surrounding the kidney, and, when massive, extend into the pelvis.  The mesenteric depot forms a glue-like web that supports the [[intestine]]s, and the omental depot, which originates near the [[stomach]] and [[spleen]], and, when massive, extends into the ventral abdomen.  Both the mesenteric and omental depots incorporate much [[lymphoid tissue]] as lymph nodes and [[milky spot]]s, respectively.  The two superficial depots are the paired inguinal depots, which are found anterior to the upper segment of the hind limbs (underneath the skin) and the subscapular depots, paired medial mixtures of brown adipose tissue adjacent to regions of white adipose tissue, which are found under the [[skin]] between the dorsal crests of the scapulae.  The layer of brown adipose tissue in this depot is often covered by a "frosting" of white adipose tissue; sometimes these two types of fat (brown and white) are hard to distinguish.  The inguinal depots enclose the inguinal group of lymph nodes.  Minor depots include the [[pericardium|pericardial]], which surrounds the heart, and the paired popliteal depots, between the major [[muscle]]s behind the knees, each containing one large [[lymph node]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Pond | first = Caroline M. | authorlink = Caroline M.

===Obesity===
In a severely [[obese]] [[person]], excess adipose tissue hanging downward from the abdomen is referred to as a [[panniculus]] (or [[pannus]]). A panniculus complicates surgery of the morbidly obese. It may remain as a literal "apron of skin" if a severely obese person quickly loses large amounts of fat (a common result of [[gastric bypass surgery]]).  This condition cannot be effectively corrected through diet and exercise alone, as the panniculus consists of adipocytes and other supporting cell types shrunken to their minimum volume and diameter.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Reconstructive surgery is one method of treatment.

=== Obesity and cancer ===
According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer and based on epidemiological studies, obese or overweight people are at increased risk of developing several cancer types such as adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, colon cancer, breast cancer (in postmenopausal women), endometrial cancer and kidney cancer.<ref>Calle EE, Kaaks R.

===Abdominal fat===

{{See also|Abdominal obesity}}
Visceral fat or abdominal fat<ref>[http://lowfatcooking.about.com/od/healthandfitness/a/bodyfat.htm Fat on the Inside: Looking Thin is Not Enough], By Fiona Haynes, About.com</ref> also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat, is located inside the [[abdominal cavity]], packed between the organs (stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, etc.).  Visceral fat is different from [[subcutaneous fat]] underneath the [[skin]], and [[intramuscular fat]] interspersed in [[skeletal muscle]]s. Fat in the lower body, as in thighs and buttocks, is subcutaneous and is not consistently spaced tissue, whereas fat in the [[abdomen]] is mostly visceral and semi-fluid.<ref>[https://www.health.harvard.edu/fhg/updates/Abdominal-fat-and-what-to-do-about-it.shtml Abdominal fat and what to do about it], President & Fellows of Harvard College</ref> Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots, including [[mesenteric]], [[epididymal]] [[white adipose tissue]] (EWAT), and [[perirenal fat|perirenal]] depots. Visceral fat is considered adipose tissue whereas subcutaneous fat is not considered as such.

===Epicardial fat===
[[Epicardial]] adipose tissue (EAT) is a particular form of visceral fat deposited around the heart and found to be a metabolically active organ that generates various bioactive molecules, which might significantly affect cardiac function.<ref name="pmid14581396">{{cite journal |author=Mazurek T, Zhang L, Zalewski A, ''et al.'' |title=Human epicardial adipose tissue is a source of inflammatory mediators |journal=Circulation |volume=108 |issue=20 |pages=2460–6 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14581396 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000099542.57313.C5 |url=}}</ref> Marked component differences have been observed in comparing EAT with subcutaneous fat, suggesting a depot specific impact of stored fatty acids on adipocyte function and metabolism.<ref name="pmid19422139">{{cite journal |author=Pezeshkian M, Noori M, Najjarpour-Jabbari H, ''et al.'' |title=Fatty acid composition of epicardial and subcutaneous human adipose tissue |journal=Metab Syndr Relat Disord |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=125–31 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19422139 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Subcutaneous fat===
[[File:Excess abdominal fat.jpg|thumb|right|Subcutaneous fat on an overweight teenage boy's abdomen.]]
Most of the remaining nonvisceral fat is found just below the skin in a region called the hypodermis.<ref name="K Hoehn 2008">E Marieb and K Hoehn. Anatomy and Physiology, 3rd Edition. Benjamin Cummings 2008.

Like all other fat organs, subcutaneous fat is an active part of the endocrine system, secreting the hormones [[leptin]] and [[resistin]].<ref name="K Hoehn 2008"/>

The relationship between the subcutaneous adipose layer and total body fat in a person is often modelled by using regression equations. The most popular of these equations was formed by Durnin and Wormersley, who rigorously tested many types of skinfold, and, as a result, created two formulae to calculate the body density of both men and women. These equations present an inverse correlation between skinfolds and body density – as the sum of skinfolds increases, the body density decreases.<ref name=Brodie>{{Cite doi|10.1016/S0899-9007(97)00474-7}}</ref>

Factors such as sex, age, population size or other variables may make the equations invalid and unusable, and, {{As of|2012|lc=y}}, Durnin and Wormersley's equations remain only estimates of a person's true level of fatness. New formulae are still being created.<ref name=Brodie/>

=== Ectopic fat ===
Ectopic fat is fat, that is stored in relatively high amounts around the organs of the [[Abdominal cavity]], but is not visceral fat.

==Physiology==
[[Free fatty acid]]s are liberated from [[lipoprotein]]s by [[lipoprotein lipase]] (LPL) and enter the adipocyte, where they are reassembled into [[triglyceride]]s by [[ester]]ifying it onto [[glycerol]]. Human fat tissue contains about 87% lipids.

There is a constant flux of FFA (Free Fatty Acids) entering and leaving adipose tissue. The net direction of this flux is controlled by insulin and leptin - if insulin is elevated there is a net inward flux of FFA and only when insulin is low can FFA leave adipose tissue. Insulin secretion is stimulated by high blood sugar which results from consuming carbohydrates.

In humans, lipolysis (hydrolysis of triglycerides into free fatty acids) is controlled through the balanced control of lipolytic B-adrenergic receptors and a2A-adrenergic receptor-mediated antilipolysis.

Fat cells have an important [[physiology|physiological]] role in maintaining triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, as well as determining [[insulin resistance]]. [[Abdomen|Abdominal]] fat has a different [[metabolism|metabolic]] profile&mdash;being more prone to induce insulin resistance. This explains to a large degree why [[central obesity]] is a marker of impaired glucose tolerance and is an independent risk factor for [[cardiovascular disease]] (even in the absence of [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[hypertension]]).<ref>Dhaliwal SS, Welborn TA. (May 2009) "Central obesity and multivariable cardiovascular risk as assessed by the Framingham prediction scores" ''Am J Cardiol.'' (American Journal of Cardiology) 103(10): pp. 1403-1407</ref> Studies of female monkeys at [[Wake Forest University]] (2009) discovered individuals suffering from higher [[Stress (biological)|stress]] have higher levels of visceral fat in their bodies. This suggests a possible cause-and-effect link between the two, wherein stress promotes the accumulation of visceral fat, which in turn causes hormonal and metabolic changes that contribute to heart disease and other health problems.<ref name="Time2009">{{cite web

Recent advances in biotechnology have allowed for the harvesting of [[adult stem cell]]s from adipose tissue, allowing stimulation of tissue regrowth using a patient's own cells.  In addition, adipose-derived stem cells from both human and animals reportedly can be efficiently reprogrammed into [[induced pluripotent stem cells]] without the need for feeder cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid= 20133714|year= 2010|last1= Sugii|first1= S|last2= Kida|first2= Y|last3= Kawamura|first3= T|last4= Suzuki|first4= J|last5= Vassena|first5= R|last6= Yin|first6= YQ|last7= Lutz|first7= MK|last8= Berggren|first8= WT|last9= Izpisúa Belmonte|first9= JC|title= Human and mouse adipose-derived cells support feeder-independent induction of pluripotent stem cells|volume= 107|issue= 8|pages= 3558–63|doi= 10.1073/pnas.0910172106|pmc= 2840462|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}}</ref> The use of a patient's own cells reduces the chance of tissue rejection and avoids ethical issues associated with the use of human [[embryonic stem cell]]s.

Adipose tissue is the greatest [[peripheral]] source of [[aromatase]] in both males and females, contributing to the production of [[estradiol]].

[[Adipose derived hormones]] include:
* [[Adiponectin]]
* [[Resistin]]
* [[Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1]] (PAI-1)
* [[TNF-alpha|TNFα]]
* [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]]
* [[Leptin]]
* [[Estradiol]] (E2)

Adipose tissues also secrete a type of [[cytokine]]s (cell-to-cell signalling proteins) called [[adipokine]]s (adipocytokines), which play a role in obesity-associated complications.

===Brown fat===
{{Main|Brown adipose tissue}}
A specialized form of adipose tissue in humans, most rodents and small mammals, and some [[hibernating]] animals, is brown fat or [[brown adipose tissue]]. It is located mainly around the neck and large blood vessels of the [[thorax]]. This specialized tissue can generate heat by "uncoupling" the [[respiratory chain]] of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] within [[mitochondria]]. The process of uncoupling means, when protons transit down the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, the energy from this process is released as heat rather than being used to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. This thermogenic process may be vital in neonates exposed to cold, which then require this thermogenesis to keep warm, as they are unable to [[shivering|shiver]], or take other actions to keep themselves warm.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2199286 |year=1990 |last1=Himms-Hagen |first1=J |title=Brown adipose tissue thermogenesis: Interdisciplinary studies |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=2890–8 |journal=FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology}}</ref>

Attempts to simulate this process [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] have so far been unsuccessful (even lethal<ref name="pmid15487646">{{cite journal |pmid=15487646 |year=2004 |last1=McFee |first1=RB |last2=Caraccio |first2=TR |last3=McGuigan |first3=MA |last4=Reynolds |first4=SA |last5=Bellanger |first5=P |title=Dying to be thin: A dinitrophenol related fatality |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=251–4 |journal=Veterinary and human toxicology}}</ref><ref name="pmid16803658">{{cite journal |pmid=16803658 |year=2006 |last1=Miranda |first1=EJ |last2=McIntyre |first2=IM |last3=Parker |first3=DR |last4=Gary |first4=RD |last5=Logan |first5=BK |title=Two deaths attributed to the use of 2,4-dinitrophenol |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=219–22 |journal=Journal of analytical toxicology}}</ref>).  Techniques to manipulate the differentiation of "brown fat" could become a mechanism for [[weight loss]] therapy in the future, encouraging the growth of tissue with this specialized metabolism without inducing it in other organs.

Until recently, brown adipose tissue was thought to be primarily limited to [[infant]]s in humans, but new evidence has now overturned that belief. Metabolically active tissue with temperature responses similar to brown adipose was first reported in the neck and trunk of some human adults in 2007,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00691.2006 |title=Unexpected evidence for active brown adipose tissue in adult humans |year=2007 |last1=Nedergaard |first1=J. |last2=Bengtsson |first2=T. |last3=Cannon |first3=B. |journal=AJP: Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=293 |issue=2 |pages=E444 |pmid=17473055}}</ref> and the presence of brown adipose in human adults was later verified histologically in the same anatomical regions.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19357407 |year=2009 |last1=Virtanen |first1=KA |last2=Lidell |first2=ME |last3=Orava |first3=J |last4=Heglind |first4=M |last5=Westergren |first5=R |last6=Niemi |first6=T |last7=Taittonen |first7=M |last8=Laine |first8=J |last9=Savisto |first9=NJ |title=Functional brown adipose tissue in healthy adults |volume=360 |issue=15 |pages=1518–25 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0808949 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19357405 |year=2009 |last1=Van Marken Lichtenbelt |first1=WD |last2=Vanhommerig |first2=JW |last3=Smulders |first3=NM |last4=Drossaerts |first4=JM |last5=Kemerink |first5=GJ |last6=Bouvy |first6=ND |last7=Schrauwen |first7=P |last8=Teule |first8=GJ |title=Cold-activated brown adipose tissue in healthy men |volume=360 |issue=15 |pages=1500–8 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0808718 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=19357406 |year=2009 |last1=Cypess |first1=AM |last2=Lehman |first2=S |last3=Williams |first3=G |last4=Tal |first4=I |last5=Rodman |first5=D |last6=Goldfine |first6=AB |last7=Kuo |first7=FC |last8=Palmer |first8=EL |last9=Tseng |first9=YH |title=Identification and importance of brown adipose tissue in adult humans |volume=360 |issue=15 |pages=1509–17 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0810780 |pmc=2859951 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine}}</ref>

===Genetics===
The [[thrifty gene hypothesis]] (also called the famine hypothesis) states that in some populations the body would be more efficient at retaining fat in times of plenty, thereby endowing greater resistance to starvation in times of food scarcity. This hypothesis has been discredited by physical anthropologists, physiologists, and the [[James V. Neel|original proponent of the idea]] himself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Speakerman |first1=John R. |chapter=Genetics of Obesity: Five Fundamental Problems with the Famine Hypothesis |title=Adipose Tissue and Adipokines in Health and Disease |year=2007}}</ref>

When leptin levels drop, the body interprets this as loss of energy, and hunger increases. Mice lacking this protein eat until they are four times their normal size.

Leptin, however, plays a different role in diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. Because adipocytes produce leptin, leptin levels are elevated in the obese. However, hunger remains, and, when leptin levels drop due to weight loss, hunger increases. The drop of leptin is better viewed as a starvation signal than the rise of leptin as a [[satiety]] signal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |last2=Ravussin |chapter=Role of the Adipocyte in Metabolism and Endocrine Function |title=Endocrinology |year=2006}}{{pn|date=May 2012}}</ref> However, elevated leptin in obesity is known as [[Leptin#Leptin_resistance_and_obesity|leptin resistance]].

Several [[mutation]]s of genes involving the [[melanocortin]]s (used in brain signaling associated with appetite) and their [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] have also been identified as causing obesity in a larger portion of the population than leptin mutations.<ref>Farooqi IS, O'Rahilly S.

In 2007, researchers isolated the [[WDTC1|''adipose'' gene]], which those researchers hypothesize serves to keep animals lean during times of plenty.  In that study, increased adipose gene activity was associated with slimmer animals.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=17767906|year=2007|last1=Suh|first1=JM|last2=Zeve|first2=D|last3=McKay|first3=R|last4=Seo|first4=J|last5=Salo|first5=Z|last6=Li|first6=R|last7=Wang|first7=M|last8=Graff|first8=JM|title=Adipose is a conserved dosage-sensitive antiobesity gene|volume=6|issue=3|pages=195–207|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.08.001|pmc=2587167|journal=Cell metabolism}}</ref> Although its discoverers dubbed this gene the ''adipose'' gene, it is not a gene responsible for creating adipose tissue.

==Body fat meter==
{{See also|Bioelectrical impedance analysis}}
A '''body fat meter''' is a widely available tool used to measure the percentage of fat in the human body. Different meters use various methods to determine the [[Body fat percentage|body fat to weight ratio]]. They tend to under-read body fat percentage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.choice.com.au/Reviews-and-Tests/Food-and-Health/Diet-and-exercise/Weight-loss/Body-fat-scales-review-and-compare.aspx|title=Body fat scales review and compare|date=10 January 2010|accessdate=11 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100117183041/http://www.choice.com.au/Reviews-and-Tests/Food-and-Health/Diet-and-exercise/Weight-loss/Body-fat-scales-review-and-compare.aspx| archivedate= 17 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In contrast with clinical tools, one relatively inexpensive type of body fat meter uses the principle of [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]] (BIA) to determine an individual's body fat percentage. To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, [[electric current]] through the body and measures the [[Ohm|resistance]], then uses information on the person's weight, height, age, and sex, to calculate an approximate value for the person's body fat percentage. The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. The result can fluctuate several percentage points depending on what has been eaten and how much water has been drunk before the analysis.
