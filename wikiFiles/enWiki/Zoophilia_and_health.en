[[Zoophilia|Sexual contact with animals]] is associated with several significant health risks. Areas of possible concern are infection, physical injury and allergic reaction.

==Zoonoses acquired via sexual contact==
Infections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called [[Zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the semen, vaginal fluids, urine, saliva, feces and blood of animals. This means that sexual activity with animals is sometimes a high risk activity. It is advisable for practitioners of [[bestiality]] to assess their relative risk, since risk varies for each species involved, for each disease mentioned below (and others not mentioned), and for each region in the world. Some of the more common zoonoses are listed at the [[National Agricultural Safety Database]] (NASD) and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC).<ref name="nasd">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/NASD/docs/d000701-d000800/d000752/d000752.html|title= Zoonoses - Animals Can Make You Sick|accessdate=2006-12-09|year=2006|author=Kenneth Rosenman |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061020022612/http://www.cdc.gov/NASD/docs/d000701-d000800/d000752/d000752.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-20}}</ref><ref name="cdcsick">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasiticpathways/animals.htm|title=Diseases spread from animals to people|accessdate=2006-12-09|year=2006}}</ref>

===Brucellosis===
{{main|Brucellosis}}
[[Brucellosis]] in humans is a potentially life-threatening multisystem disease that can be extremely difficult to treat.<ref name="germanbc">{{cite journal  |author=Schoenemann J, Lutticken R, Scheibner E. |title=[Brucella canis infection in man] |journal=Dtsch Med Wochenschr. |year=1986 |volume=111 |issue=1 |pmid=3940831 |pages=20–2  |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1068393}}</ref> There are several varieties of Brucellosis, all caused by [[bacteria]] of the genus ''Brucella'', the most notable being ''B. abortus'' and ''B. melitensis'' which affect larger species of domestic animals, and ''B. canis'' which infects [[dog]]s and other [[canid]]s. All are widely spread around the world. The most severe infections are thought to be associated with ''B. melitensis'' which primarily infects [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[camel]]s in the [[Mediterranean]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], parts of [[Africa]] and some [[southern Europe]]an countries. Humans can catch ''B. canis'' through contact with the body fluids of infected dogs, especially semen, urine and vaginal fluids. Dogs can be infected with Brucellosis without showing any signs or symptoms, and infection can only be diagnosed with specific blood tests.<ref name="cdctests">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/brucellosis_g.htm#mydog|title=Canine Brucellosis|accessdate=2006-12-09|year=2006 }}</ref> The typical symptoms of the type of brucellosis contracted from dogs are: [[fever]] that comes and goes, [[loss of appetite]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], weakness, malaise, sore joints, low [[back pain]], [[Vertebral column|spine]] pain, headache, depression, abdominal pain, [[constipation]], [[diarrhoea]], [[vomiting]], weakness, dizziness, unsteadiness of [[gait]], and urinary retention.<ref name="emed-bruc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic248.htm|title=Brucellosis|accessdate=2006-12-06|publisher=eMedicine|year=2006|author=Wafa Al-Nassir }}</ref> Heart and lung complications can occur.<ref name="pmid10836605">{{cite journal |author=Piampiano P, McLeary M, Young LW, Janner D |title=Brucellosis: unusual presentations in two adolescent boys |journal=Pediatric radiology |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=355–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10836605 |doi=10.1007/s002470050760}}</ref> Infected people exhibit only some of these symptoms. Other forms of brucellosis can be more severe.

With approximately 500,000 zoonotic infections a year worldwide (source:CDC), brucellosis places a large burden on humanity. Brucellosis has been reduced to rare disease status in [[North America]] (excluding [[Mexico]]) and northern [[Europe]] through vaccination and eradication programs, but it remains rife throughout the rest of the world. In most countries up to 10% of dogs carry this bacterium, and even up to 42.7% in some provinces of [[China]],<ref name="chinabruc">{{cite journal  |author=Shang DQ |title=[Investigation of B. canis infection in China] |journal=Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi |year=1989 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pmid=2661007 |pages=24–9}}</ref> representing a major threat to the health of veterinarians and people who handle the blood or semen of infected animals.

Studies have shown that in the United States human brucellosis is underdiagnosed and underreported. The reporting rate in some states, ie, California, has been as low as 10%.}}</ref> Most other countries have much higher rates, with high risk areas including the [[Mediterranean Basin]] (Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, North Africa), [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]] (including Mexico), Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.

===Emerging zoonoses===
New diseases that can jump from animals to humans are called ''emerging zoonoses''. The emerging zoonosis situation changes constantly, in an upward trend.<ref name="zoorise">{{Cite web |url=http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jul04/040701d.asp|title=Emerging zoonoses on the rise|accessdate=2006-12-09|year=2004 }}</ref> An example from the equine species is the rare [[Hendra virus]], originally passed from [[flying fox]]es to horses.  The implications for zoophilic sexual contact of each emerging disease should be carefully assessed by practitioners.

=== Zoophilia and human sexually transmitted diseases===
====HIV / AIDS====
[[HIV]] (the "[[AIDS]]" virus) was originally a zoonosis acquired from [[primates]] (notably monkeys) in Africa,<ref name="hivv">{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0612_030612_hivvirusjump.html|title=HIV Originated With Monkeys, Not Chimps, Study Finds|accessdate=2007-07-25|publisher=National Geographic News|year=2003|author=Stefan Lovgren }}</ref> probably via hunting and eating but possibly via animal bite.<ref name="hivsrc">{{cite journal  |author=Gurtler L. |title=[SIV as a source of HIV. On the origin of human immunodeficiency viruses from non-human primates] |journal=Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz |year=2004 |volume=47 |issue=7 |pmid=15254823 |pages=680–4 |doi=10.1007/s00103-004-0862-z}}</ref> It only lives in primates (humans, apes and monkeys) and is not believed to survive long in other species or away from the human body and fluids.<ref>From [http://www.phru.co.za/hivsa/pdf/support_pack/13.pdf educational material] published by the Perinatal HIV Research Unit (phru) and [http://www.hivsa.com/hivsa/ HIVSA], a UK based charity supporting HIV/AIDS awareness and training in Africa: "''Resilient:'' Within the human body, HIV is a strong virus and can live and grow under almost any conditions ... ''Dependent:'' HIV depends on the environment in the human body (the temperature of the blood and other factors) to survive. ''Volatile:'' Outside of the human body, HIV is very weak and can survive for a short period only: between three seconds and one minute. If a scab forms over an open wound or if the blood is contained within a needle capsule, however, then the virus within that blood may be protected and enabled to live slightly longer." (ie, the presence of blood or fluids allows longer survival.)</ref> 

====Other STDs====
Human [[sexually transmitted disease]]s ("STDs") are not carried or transmitted by animals. 

However, many human pathogens can survive in animal fluids for a limited time, and therefore STDs may theoretically be transmitted by an animal that has multiple consecutive human sexual partners in a short enough time frame to allow pathogen survival.

==Bites and other physical injury==
Humans may be at substantial physical risk and seriously harmed by sexual activity with animals.  Larger animals may have the strength and defensive attributes (e.g. teeth, hooves, horns, claws) to injure a human, either in rejecting physical or sexual contact, or during sexual arousal.

===Bites===
Many animals [[bite]] as part of sexual excitement and foreplay. Animals carry numerous bacteria in their mouths capable of causing disease after a bite. The most common risk after an animal bite is simple infection (infection risk approximately 15-20% in the USA,<ref name="healthatoz_bite" >{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/common/standard/transform.jsp?requestURI=/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/animal_bite_infections.jsp|title=Animal bite infections|accessdate=2006-12-07|publisher=healthatoz|year=2006 }}</ref> may be higher elsewhere), and for dogs and other large animals injury from the force of the bite.<ref name="healthatoz_bite" /> Bacterial bite infections are usually fully curable,<ref name="healthatoz_bite" />
although dog bites may cause ''[[Pasteurella]]'' and ''[[Capnocytophaga canimorsus]]'' infections,<ref name="pasteur">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/medical_notes/5270588.stm|title=Pasteurellosis |accessdate=2006-12-06|publisher=BBC News| date=2006-08-21}}</ref><ref name="cap">{{cite journal  |author=D J Brenner, D G Hollis, G R Fanning, and R E Weaver |title=Capnocytophaga canimorsus sp. nov. (formerly CDC group DF-2), a cause of septicemia following dog bite, and C. cynodegmi sp. nov., a cause of localized wound infection following dog bite |journal=J Clin Microbiol. |date=1 February 1989|volume=27 |issue=2 |pmc=267282 |pages=231–5 |pmid=2915017 }}</ref> which may have severe consequences.

===Other injury===
The sexual organs of other species may not safely conform to the human anatomy. For example, the penis of a [[Canine reproduction#Copulation|sexually aroused dog]] has [[bulbus glandis|a broad bulb at the base]] which can cause injury if forcibly pulled from a woman's vagina, and [[equine]]s can thrust suddenly and "flare" inside a human orifice.<ref>[[Bodil Joensen]] commented in a 1980s [http://fakepix.com/story/bodil-interview.html interview] that "I was afraid to let other women do the same with the [stallion] as I. It requires a special technique. When they cum, their glans swells up, and it can split your vagina. I have had some stitches once I didn't pull it out in time"</ref> 

In 2005, [[Kenneth Pinyan]], a resident of [[Enumclaw]], [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] died from internal injury after being [[anal sex|anally penetrated]] by a stallion. In 2002, a 62-year-old farmer in [[Bulgaria]] was treated for a torn [[rectum]] after sex with a boar (male [[pig]]).<ref name="pig2">{{cite journal  |author=Kirov GK, Losanoff JE, Kjossev KT |title=Zoophilia: a rare cause of traumatic injury to the rectum |journal=Injury |year=2002 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pmid=12091035 |pages=367–8 |doi=10.1016/S0020-1383(01)00189-9}}</ref> In 1976, a 46-year-old [[France|French]] farmer underwent surgery for [[peritonitis]] after sex with a boar.<ref name="pig1">{{cite journal  |author=Blondel PH |title=[Digestive perforation of unusual origin. 2 cases] |journal=Nouv Presse Med. |year=1976 |volume=5 |issue=14 |pmid=1083973 |pages=915–6}}</ref>

==Allergic reactions==
{{main|Allergy}}
Sensitization and allergic reactions to animal saliva and semen may occur, ranging from mild irritation to [[anaphylaxis]].<ref name="saliva">{{cite journal  |author=Vanto T |title=Immediate sensitivity of asthmatic children to dog allergens |journal=Klin Padiatr |year=1985 |volume=197 |issue=4 |pmid=4046495 |pages=363–5  |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1034004}}</ref><ref name="anaphylaxis">{{cite journal  |author=Holden TE, Sherline DM. |title=Bestiality, with sensitization and anaphylactic reaction |journal=Obstet Gynecol. |year=1973 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pmid=4737141 |pages=138–40}}</ref> Although dried skin flakes, known as ''dander'', are the most commonly cited allergen,<ref>Dog hair, or [[fur]] is often cited as an allergen in respect of dogs. In fact the fur itself is not a significant allergen; rather it is the ''dander'', or other allergens such as [[pollen]] on the fur, which are normally responsible. [http://www.acaai.org/public/advice/pets.htm]</ref> dog saliva is a more potent allergen than dander.<ref name="saliva" /> An estimated 10% of people are allergic to animals in general, rising to 20-30% amongst [[asthma]] sufferers;<ref name="acaai">{{Cite web|url=http://www.acaai.org/public/advice/pets.htm|title=Advice from Your Allergist...Pet Allergy|accessdate=2006-12-06|publisher=American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology|year=2006 }}</ref> the percentage of people allergic to animal ''secretions'' in particular is currently unknown. Repeated exposure to secretions after sensitization has already occurred may subsequently provoke an [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]], which can be life-threatening, and should be avoided.
