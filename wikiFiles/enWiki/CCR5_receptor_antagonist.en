'''CCR5 receptor antagonists''' are a class of [[small molecule]]s that [[receptor antagonist|antagonize]] the [[CCR5 receptor]]. The [[C-C motif chemokine]] receptor CCR5 is involved in the process by which [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[AIDS]], enters cells.  Hence antagonists of this receptor are [[entry inhibitor]]s and have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of HIV infections.

The life cycle of the HIV presents potential targets for drug therapy, one of them being the viral entry pathway.  The C-C motif chemokine receptors CCR5 and [[CXCR4]] are the main [[chemokine]] receptors involved in the HIV entry process. These receptors belong to the seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor ([[GPCR]]) family and are predominantly expressed on human [[T-cells]], [[dendritic cells]] and [[macrophages]], [[Langerhans cells]].<ref name=Lederman_2006>{{cite journal |author=Lederman MM, Penn-Nicholson A, Cho M, Mosier D |title=Biology of CCR5 and its role in HIV infection and treatment |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=7 |pages=815–26 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16905787 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.7.815}}</ref>  They play an important role as [[co-receptors]] that HIV type 1 (HIV-1) uses to attach to cells before viral fusion and entry into host cells.<ref name=Lederman_2006/> HIV isolates can be divided into R5 and X4 strains.

== History ==
Since the discovery of HIV in the 1980s, remarkable progress has been made in the development of novel [[antiviral drug]]s.<ref name= "Clercq _2007"/> The trigger for the discovery of the CCR5 [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] was the observation that a small percentage of high-risk populations showed either resistance or delayed development of the disease. This population was found to have a [[mutation]] (CCR5-Δ32) in the gene that codes for the CCR5 receptor which results in almost complete resistance against HIV-1 infection and scientists then discovered the key role of the [[membrane receptor|cell surface receptors]] CCR5 and [[CXCR4]] in successful viral fusion and infection.<ref name= "Lalezari _2007">{{Cite journal | last = Lalezari | first = J. | author-link = | last2 = Goodrich | first2 = J.| last3 = DeJesus | first3 = E. | last4 = Lampiris | first4 = H. | last5 = Gulick | first5 = R. | last6 = Saag | first6 = M. | last7 = Ridgway| first7 = C. | last8 = McHale | first8 = M. | last9 = Van Der Ryst | first9 = E. | title = Efficacy and Safety of Maraviroc plus Optimized Background Therapy In Viremic, ART-Experienced Patients Infected With CCR5-Tropic HIV‑1, 24-week results of a Phase 2b/3 study in the U.

==Drug development==
As mentioned, the CCR5 receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and before the discovery of CCR5’s role in HIV infection many pharmaceutical companies had already built a substantial collection of compounds that target GPCRs.  Some of these compounds provided an excellent starting point for CCR5 antagonists but then needed further optimization to gain better potency, [[pharmacokinetic]] properties and better CCR5 selectivity.  One of the biggest problems was the affinity for the [[hERG]] ion channel, as inhibition of hERG can lead to [[QT interval]] prolongation. Abnormality in the interval can increase the risk of developing [[ventricular arrhythmias]].<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/><ref name= "Fermini _2003">{{cite journal |author=Fermini B, Fossa AA |title=The impact of drug-induced QT interval prolongation on drug discovery and development |journal=Nature Reviews.

===Aplaviroc===
[[File:2efnifostsaman.png|thumb|350px|right|'''Figure 2''' Molecular structure of aplaviroc and its lead compound]]
[[File:BrynjaSolmundsdottir.PNG|thumb|350px|right|'''Figure 3''' Molecular structure of vicriviroc and its lead compounds]]
[[Aplaviroc]] is originated from a class of spirodiketopiperazine derivatives. Figure 2 shows the molecular structure of the lead compound and the final compound aplaviroc. The lead compound showed good potency in blocking CCR5 in a number of R5 HIV strains and against multi-drug resistant strains.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/> The problem with this compound was not its CCR5 selectivity but the oral bioavailability.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/><ref name= "Maeda _2004">{{cite journal |author=Maeda K, Nakata H, Koh Y, ''et al.'' |title=Spirodiketopiperazine-Based CCR5 Inhibitor Which Preserves CC-Chemokine/CCR5 Interactions and Exerts Potent Activity against R5 Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 In Vitro |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=78 |issue=16 |pages=8654–62 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15280474 |pmc=479103 |doi=10.1128/JVI.78.16.8654-8662.2004}}</ref> This led to further development of the molecule and the result was a compound named aplaviroc.  Unfortunately despite the promising preclinical and early clinical results some severe liver toxicity was observed in the treatment of naive and treatment-experienced patients that led to the discontinuation in further development of aplaviroc.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/>

===Vicriviroc===
Schering-Plough identified an [[active compound]] during screening.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/> Figure 3 shows the molecular structure of  the lead compound, intermediate compound and the final compound [[vicriviroc]]. The lead compound  contained a [[piperazine]] scaffold and was a potent [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]] (M2) antagonist with modest CCR5 activity.  The changes that were made on the left hand side of the lead compound and the addition of a methyl group on the piperazine group ((S)-methylpiperazine) resulted in the intermediate compound that had good affinity for CCR5 receptors but very little affinity for muscarinic activity, however, the compound did show affinity for the hERG ion channel.<ref name= "Tagat _2001a">{{cite journal |author=Tagat JR, McCombie SW, Steensma RW, ''et al.'' |title=Piperazine-based CCR5 antagonists as HIV-1 inhibitors.

The phase II study was discontinued since there was a viral breakthrough in the vicriviroc group compared to the [[control group]].  These results suggested that vicriviroc was not effective in the treatment of treatment-naive patients compared to current treatments.  Another phase II clinical study was performed in treatment-experienced patients. The results were that vicriviroc did have strong antiviral activity but five instances of [[cancer]] among the participants were reported, however, the study was continued since there was lack of causal association of the [[malignancies]] and vicriviroc.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/> In late 2009 vicriviroc was assigned in phase III studies in treatment-experienced patients, and in phase II studies in treatment for naive patients.<ref name= "Schering-Plough _2009">{{cite press release |title=Schering-Plough Reports Long-Term Vicriviroc Data From Phase II Open-Label Extension Study in Treatment-Experienced HIV-Infected Patients |publisher=[[Schering-Plough]] |date=14 September 2009 |url=http://www.natap.org/2009/ICCAC/ICCAC_20.htm |accessdate=8 November 2009}}</ref>

===Maraviroc===
Pfizer turned to [[high-throughput screening]] in their search for a good starting point for a small molecule CCR5 antagonist.  Their screening resulted in a compound that presented weak affinity and no antiviral activity but represented a good starting point for further optimization.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/> Compounds 1-9 in table 1 show the development of [[maraviroc]] in few steps.  The chemical structure of the starting molecule is presented as compound 1.  Their first focus was to minimize [[CYP2D6]] activity of the molecule and to reduce its [[lipophilicity]].  They replaced the [[imidazopyridine]] with [[benzimidazole]] and the benzhydril group was swapped out for a [[benzamide]].  The outcome was compound 2.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/> That compound showed good binding potency and the start of an antiviral activity.  Further SAR ([[structure-activity relationship]])  optimization of the amide region and identifying the [[enantiomer]]ic preference led to the cyclobutyl amide structure in compound 3.  However, the problem with the CYP2D6 activity of the compound was still unacceptable so they had to perform further SAR optimization that determined that the [3.2.1]-azabicycloamine (topane) could replace the aminopiperidine moiety.  This change in the chemical structure led to compound 4.  Compound 4 had no CYP2D6 activity while preserving excellent binding affinity and antiviral activity.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/><ref name= "Wood _2005">{{cite journal |author=Wood A, Armour D |title=The discovery of the CCR5 receptor antagonist, UK-427,857, a new agent for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS |journal=Progress in Medicinal Chemistry |volume=43 |issue= |pages=239–71 |year=2005 |pmid=15850827 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6468(05)43007-6 |series=Progress in Medicinal Chemistry |isbn=978-0-444-51572-8}}</ref>  Although compound 4 showed promising results it demonstrated 99% inhibition on the [[hERG]] ion channel.  That inhibition was unacceptable since it can lead to [[QT interval|QTc interval]] prolongation.  The research team then did a few modifications to see which part of the molecule played a role in the hERG affinity.  Compound 5 shows an analogue that they synthesized which contained an oxygen bridgehead in the [[tropane]] ring; however, that reconstruction did not have an effect on the hERG affinity.<ref name= "Price _2006">{{cite journal |author=Price DA, Armour D, de Groot M, ''et al.'' |title=Overcoming HERG affinity in the discovery of the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc |journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=4633–7 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16782336 |doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2006.06.012}}</ref>  They then focused on the polar surface area in the molecule to dial out the hERG affinity.  These efforts resulted in compound 6. That compound preserved desired antiviral activity and was selective against the hERG inhibition but the problem was its bioavailability.  Reduction in the lipophilicity, by replacing the benzimidazol group with a substituted triazole group gave compound 7.  Compound 7 had shown a significant reduction in lipophilicity and maintained the antiviral activity but again, with the introduction of a cyclobutyl group the compound showed hERG inhibition.  Changing the ring size in compound 7 from a cyclobutyl unit to a cyclopentyl unit in compound 8 led to a significant increase in antiviral activity and loss of hERG affinity.  Further development led to discovery of a 4,4’-difluorocyclohexylamide also known as maraviroc.  Maraviroc preserved excellent antiviral activity, whilst demonstrating no significant hERG binding affinity. The lack of hERG binding affinity was predicted to be because of the large size of the cyclohexyl group and the high [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the fluoro substituents.<ref name= "Pulley _2007"/><ref name= "Wood _2005"/><ref name= "Price _2006"/> In August 2007 the FDA approved the first CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc discovered and developed by Pfizer.<ref name= "Lalezari _2007"/><ref name=Flexner_2007/>

==Pharmacophore==
[[File:Farmacofórit.png|thumb|240px|right|'''Figure 4''' Predictive pharmacophore model for piperidine- and piperazine-based CCR5 antagonists]]
The predictive [[pharmacophore]] model was developed for a large series of [[piperidine]]- and [[piperazine]]-based CCR5 antagonists by Schering-Plough Research Institute.  Their hypothesis consisted of mostly five features, two hydrogen bond acceptors, marked C and D in figure 4 and three hydrophobic groups, A, B and E in figure 4. Part B usually has a basic nitrogen group.    The model was validated using diverse set of six CCR5 antagonists from five different pharmaceutical companies.  The best model correctly predicted these compounds as being highly active.  It is possible to use the model as a tool in virtual screening for new small molecular CCR5 antagonists and also to predict biological activities of compounds prior to undertaking their costly synthesis.<ref name= "Debnath _2003">{{cite journal |author=Debnath AK |title=Generation of predictive pharmacophore models for CCR5 antagonists: study with piperidine- and piperazine-based compounds as a new class of HIV-1 entry inhibitors |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=46 |issue=21 |pages=4501–15 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14521412 |doi=10.1021/jm030265z}}</ref>

==Binding==
CCR5 is a member of G-protein-coupled, seven transmembrane segment receptors.  The structure of the receptor comprises seven-helix bundle in the transmembrane region, these regions are labeled I-VII in figure 5 and 6.  The CCR5 antagonists are predicted to bind to a putative binding pocket which is buried inside the transmembrane domain, enclosed by the seven transmembrane helices.  The binding pocket is very hydrophobic with multiple aromatic residues lining the pocket.  The key residues are [[tryptophan]] 86 and 248 (Trp86, Trp248), [[tyrosine]] 108 and 251 (Tyr108, Tyr251), [[phenylalanine]] 109 (phe109), [[threonine]] 195 (Thr195), [[isoleucine]] 198 (Ile198), [[glutamic acid]] 283 (Glu283).   CCR5 antagonists are very different in shape and [[electrostatic]] potential although they all share the same binding pocket.   The interesting thing about the binding of these molecules is that they exhibit significantly different binding modes, although they all establish an extensive interaction network with CCR5.<ref name= "Maeda _2006">{{cite journal |author=Maeda K, Das D, Ogata-Aoki H, ''et al.'' |title=Structural and molecular interactions of CCR5 inhibitors with CCR5 |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=281 |issue=18 |pages=12688–98 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16476734 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M512688200}}</ref><ref name= "Kondru _2007">{{cite journal |author=Kondru R, Zhang J, Ji C, ''et al.'' |title=Molecular interactions of CCR5 with major classes of small-molecule anti-HIV CCR5 antagonists |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=789–800 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18096812 |doi=10.1124/mol.107.042101}}</ref><ref name= "Wang _2008">{{cite journal |author=Wang T, Duan Y |title=Binding Modes of CCR5-targetting HIV Entry Inhibitors: Partial and Full Antagonists |journal=Journal of Molecular Graphics & Modelling |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=1287–95 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18249144 |pmc=2701198 |doi=10.1016/j.jmgm.2007.12.003}}</ref>

=== Aplaviroc ===
[[File:Brynja14.png|thumb|350px|right|'''Figure 5''' Putative binding of aplaviroc to the CCR5 receptor]]
[[File:Brynja4.PNG|thumb|350px|right|'''Figure 6''' Putative binding of maraviroc to the CCR5 receptor]]
The putative binding mode for aplaviroc is shown in figure 5. The key saltbridge interaction between aplaviroc and Glu283 is predicted to be quite weak  compared to other CCR5 antagonists.  The hydroxyl group on aplaviroc forms a strong hydrogen bond to the polar residue Thr195.  This H-bond interaction is the strongest with aplaviroc compared to other CCR5 antagonists.  The cyclohexyl group in the aplaviroc  structure is predicted to interact with the receptor in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile198, Thr15 and Phe109 and is thought to show quite strong hydrophobic interactions.  The researchers predict that the t-butyl group of aplaviroc is buried within the helical bundle through strong hydrophobic interaction with multiple aromatic residues of the CCR5 receptor.<ref name= "Kondru _2007"/>

=== Maraviroc ===
The putative binding mode for maraviroc is shown in figure 6. The strongest interaction is estimated to be between maraviroc and glutamic acid (Glu283) through a strong salt-bridge interaction.  The interaction between tryptophan (Trp86) and maraviroc involves T-shaped π-π [[stacking]] while the interaction with phenylalanine (Phe109) is predicted to be hydrophopic.  Tyrosine (Tyr108) is thought to interact with the phenyl group on maraviroc through a parallel displaced interaction.  The interaction between maraviroc and isoleucine (Ile198) is predicted to be mostly hydrophobic in nature and the interaction between maraviroc and tyrosine (Tyr251) is very limited.<ref name= "Kondru _2007"/>

=== Aplaviroc ===
Aplaviroc has a unique feature of preserving two of the natural chemokine protein ligands binding to CCR5 and subsequent activation, whereas maraviroc and the other antagonists almost fully block chemokine-CCR5 interactions.  This kind of interference is so far considered to be safe, and individuals that naturally lack CCR5 do not show any obvious health problems.  However, to limit the toxicity and side effects of CCR5 antagonists it would be ideal to be able to preserve the chemokine receptor function.  Consequently, it should be of interest to design inhibitors that specifically disrupt CCR5-gp120 binding but do not affect the CCR5 chemokine activation.<ref name= "Wang _2008"/>

[[File:Vonandiseinasta.png|thumb|250px|right|'''Figure 7''' Molecular structure of compound A]]
Development of new CCR5 antagonists continues, both for their antiviral effects and also for potential utility in a variety of [[autoimmune]] indications.  Researchers at [[Ono]] have discovered a novel series of potent CCR5 small molecule antagonists.  Lead optimization was pursued by balancing opposing trends of metabolic stability and potency.  Combination of the spiropiperidine template with pharmacophore elements from both aplaviroc, and Schering’s CCR5 antagonist program, led to the initial lead compound in this series. Further development of that lead compound led to the discovery of compound A in figure 7 - A compound that possesses a good selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties.<ref name= "Rotstein _2009">{{cite journal |author=Rotstein DM, Gabriel SD, Makra F, ''et al.'' |title=Spiropiperidine CCR5 antagonists |journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters |volume=19 |issue=18 |pages=5401–6 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19674898 |doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.07.122}}</ref>

The CCR5 antagonist INCB009471 has [[nanomolar]] activity against HIV-1 in vitro. This compound demonstrated potent and prolonged antiviral activity against R5-tropic HIV-1 when given 200&nbsp;mg once daily dose for 14 days. These findings supported further clinical development of INCB009471 and they have since progressed to phase IIb clinical trials. As of 2009 the study of this compound is inactive and no further studies are planned at this time.<ref name= "Kuritzkes _2009">{{cite journal |author=Kuritzkes DR |title=HIV-1 Entry Inhbitors: An Overview |journal=Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=82–7 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19339945 |doi=10.1097/COH.0b013e328322402e |pmc=2753507}}</ref>
