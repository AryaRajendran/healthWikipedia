The '''New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM)''' was founded in 1847 by a group of leading [[New York City]] [[metropolitan area]] [[physicians]] as a voice for the medical profession in medical practice and [[public health]] reform. The Academy quickly established the [[Metropolitan Board of Health]], the first modern municipal public health authority in the [[United States]].

The Academy moved to its current location in 1926: 1216 [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]], near [[Central Park]] in [[Manhattan]]. In recent years the Academy has  functioned as an effective advocate in public health reform, as well as a major center for [[health education]]. The Academy Library, on premises, is one of the three largest medical collections in the United States and is open to general public. It is very extensive, including original writings by [[Sigmund Freud]] and a prototype of [[George Washington]]'s [[dentures]], constructed from actual [[teeth]] that were donated.

In 1939, the Academy prepared [[Mayor of New York|Mayor]] [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s [[LaGuardia Commission]] report, that when released in 1944 infuriated [[Harry Anslinger]] and his campaign against [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].

Today, the Academy has over three-thousand [[Fellow]]s, that include doctors, [[nurses]], [[health care]] administrators, and [[allied health|professionals]] in all fields dedicated to maintaining and improving health.
