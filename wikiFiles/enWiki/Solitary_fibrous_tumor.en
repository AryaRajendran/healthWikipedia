'''Solitary fibrous tumor''' (SFT) is a rare [[mesenchymal]] [[tumor]] originating in the [[pleura]]<ref name='who2004'>Travis WD, Brambilla E, Muller-Hermelink HK, Harris CC (Eds.): World Health Organization Classification of Tumours. Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart. IARC Press: Lyon 2004.</ref> or at virtually any site in the soft tissue. Approximately 78% to 88% of SFT's are [[benign]] and 12% to 22% are [[malignant]].<ref name='RobinsonLA1'>Robinson LA. Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura. Cancer Control 2006;13:264-9.</ref>

SFT was first mentioned in the scientific literature by Wagner.<ref name='WagnerE1'>Wagner E. Das tuberkelahnliche lymphadenom (der cytogene oder reticulirte tuberkel). Arch Heilk (Leipig). 1870;11:497.></ref> The first discussion of its clinical and pathological properties was by Klemperer and Rabin.<ref name="RobinsonLA1"/><ref name='dePerrotFischer'>de Perrot M, Fischer S, Brundler MA, et al. Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura. Ann Thorac Surg. 2002;74:285-293.</ref>

Over the years this entity acquired a number of synonyms, including localized fibrous tumor, benign mesothelioma, localized
fibrous mesothelioma, submesothelial fibroma, and pleural fibroma. The use of names that include ‘mesothelioma’ for this tumor is discouraged because of potential confusion with diffuse malignant mesothelioma, a much more serious disease.<ref name="who2004"/>

About 80% of SFT's originate in the visceral pleura, while 20% arise from parietal pleura.<ref name='BrisellyMark'>Briselli M, Mark EJ, Dickersin GR. Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura: eight new cases and review of 360 cases in the literature. Cancer 1981;47:2678-89.</ref> Although they are often very large tumors (up to 40&nbsp;cm. in diameter), over half are [[asymptomatic]] at diagnosis.<ref name="BrisellyMark"/> While some researchers have proposed that a SFT occupying at least 40% of the affected [[hemithorax]] be considered a "giant solitary fibrous tumor",<ref name='PinedoRobles'>Pinedo-Onofre JA, Robles-Pérez E, Peña-Mirabal ES, Hernández-Carrillo JA, Téllez-Becerra JL. [Giant solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura.] Cir Cir 2010;78:31-43. [Article in Spanish].</ref> no such "giant" variant has yet been recognized within the most widely used pleural tumor classification scheme.<ref name="who2004"/>

==Treatment and prognosis==

The treatment of choice for both benign and malignant SFT is complete ''en bloc'' surgical [[Segmental resection|resection]].

Prognosis in benign SFT's is excellent. About 8% will recur after first resection, with the recurrence usually cured after additional surgery.<ref name="RobinsonLA1"/>

The prognosis in malignant SFT's is much more guarded. Approximately 63% of patients will have a recurrence of their tumor, of which more than half will succumb to disease progression within 2 years.<ref name="RobinsonLA1"/> Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in malignant SFT remains controversial.<ref name="RobinsonLA1"/>
