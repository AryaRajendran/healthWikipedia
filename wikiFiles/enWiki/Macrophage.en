'''Macrophages''' ({{lang-el|big eaters}}, from ''makros'' "large" + ''phagein'' "eat"; abbr. '''MΦ''') are [[Cell (biology)|cells]] produced by the differentiation of [[monocyte]]s in tissues. Macrophages were discovered by [[Ilya Mechnikov]], a Russian bacteriologist, in 1884.<ref>{{cite book |author=Semyon Zalkind |title=Ilya Mechnikov: His Life and Work |publisher=Honolulu, Hawaii: University Press of the Pacific | year=2001 | isbn=0-89875-622-7 |pages=78, 210}}</ref> Human macrophages are about {{convert|21|um}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krombach, F., Münzing, S., Allmeling, A.

Macrophages function in both non-specific defense ([[innate immunity]]) as well as help initiate specific defense mechanisms ([[adaptive immunity]]) of vertebrate animals. Their role is to [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]], or engulf and then digest, cellular debris and [[pathogen]]s,  either as stationary or as mobile cells.  They also stimulate [[lymphocyte]]s and other immune cells to respond to pathogens. They are specialized ''phagocytic'' cells that attack foreign substances, infectious [[microbes]] and cancer cells through destruction and ingestion.
Macrophages can be identified by specific expression of a number of proteins including [[CD14]], [[CD40 (protein)|CD40]], [[CD11b]], [[CD64 (biology)|CD64]], [[F4/80]] (mice)/[[EMR1]] (human), [[lysozyme]] M, [[Macrophage-1 antigen|MAC-1]]/MAC-3 and [[CD68]] by [[flow cytometry]] or [[immunohistochemical staining]].<ref name="pmid16213494">{{cite journal |author=Khazen, W., M'bika, J.

==Life cycle==
When a [[monocyte]] enters damaged tissue through the [[endothelium]] of a [[blood vessel]], a process known as the [[leukocyte extravasation]], it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage. Monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through [[chemotaxis]], triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells, pathogens and [[cytokines]] released by macrophages already at the site. At some sites such as the testis, macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation.
Unlike short-lived [[neutrophil]]s, macrophages survive longer in the body up to a maximum of several months.

=== Phagocytosis ===
{{Main|Phagocytosis}}
Macrophages are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris. This role is important in chronic inflammation, as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s, which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age (see [[CD31]] for a description of this process).

The removal of dying cells is, to a greater extent, handled by ''fixed macrophages'', which will stay at strategic locations such as the lungs, liver, neural tissue, bone, spleen and connective tissue, ingesting foreign materials such as pathogens and recruiting additional macrophages if needed.

When a macrophage ingests a pathogen, the pathogen becomes trapped in a phagosome, which then fuses with a [[lysosome]]. Within the phagolysosome, [[enzymes]] and toxic peroxides digest the pathogen. However, some bacteria, such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', have become resistant to these methods of digestion. Macrophages can digest more than 100 bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds.

===Role in adaptive immunity===
Macrophages are versatile cells that play many roles. As scavengers, they rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris. Along with [[dendritic cells]], they are foremost among the cells that "present" antigen, a crucial role in initiating an immune response. As secretory cells, monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ([[monokine]]s) including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as [[interleukin-1]]. At the same time, they carry receptors for [[lymphokine]]s that allow them to be "activated" into single-minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells.

After digesting a pathogen, a macrophage will present the [[antigen]] (a molecule, most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen, used by the immune system for identification) of the pathogen to the corresponding [[helper T cell]]. The presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] class II molecule, indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen, despite having antigens on its surface.

Eventually, the antigen presentation results in the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] that attach to the antigens of pathogens, making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose. In some cases, pathogens are very resistant to adhesion by the macrophages.

The antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages (in the context of [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] class II) in a lymph node stimulates [[T helper cell|TH1]] (type 1 helper T cells) to proliferate (mainly due to [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]] secretion from the macrophage). When a B-cell in the lymph node recognizes the same unprocessed surface antigen on the bacterium with its surface bound antibody, the antigen is endocytosed and processed. The processed antigen is then presented in MHCII on the surface of the B-cell. T cells that express the T cell receptor which recognizes the antigen-MHCII complex (with co-stimulatory factors- [[CD40]] and [[CD40L]]) cause the B-cell to produce antibodies that help [[opsonisation]] of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by [[phagocytes]].

Macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with [[fungus]] or [[parasite]]s. Once a T cell has recognized its particular antigen on the surface of an aberrant cell, the T cell becomes an activated effector cell, producing chemical mediators known as [[lymphokine]]s that stimulate macrophages into a more aggressive form.

Currently, it is a major opinion that there are several activated forms of macrophages.<ref name= PMC2724991>{{cite journal |author=David M. Mosser and Justin P. Edwards |date=December 2008|title= Exploring the full spectrum of macrophage activation |journal= Nature Reviews Immunology|volume=8 |issue= 12|pages=958–969 |id= |url=http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v8/n12/full/nri2448.html |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.1038/nri2448 |pmid=19029990 |pmc=2724991}}</ref> In spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages, historically they have been classfied into two main groups designated M1 and M2. M1 macrophages, or classically activated macrophages, are immune effector cells that are aggressive against microbes and can engulf and digest affected cells much more readily, and they also produce many lymphokines.<ref name= New>{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 1988|title= The human immune system: The lymphocyte story |journal= New Scientist|volume= |issue=1605 |pages=1 |id= |url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/hiv/mg11716050.100 |accessdate= 2007-09-13 |quote= }}</ref> M1 macrophages are activated by [[Lipopolysaccharide|LPS]] and [[Interferon-gamma|IFN-gamma]], and secrete high levels of [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]] and low levels of [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]]. As more ways to activate macrophages become apparent, the M2 designation is becoming a catch-all to describe other types, including those that function in wound healing and tissue repair, and those that turn off immune system activation by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines like [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]]. M2, or alternatively activated macrophages, are activated by [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]] and produce high levels of IL-10 and low levels of IL-12. Tumor-associated macrophages are thought to be M2 macrophages.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galdiero|title=Tumor associated macrophages and neutrophils in tumor progression|journal=J Cell Phys|year=2012|pmid=23065796|doi=10.1002/jcp.24260|first1=MR|last2=Garlanda|first2=C|last3=Jaillon|first3=S|last4=Marone|first4=G|last5=Mantovani|first5=A|pages=n/a}}</ref>

===Role in muscle regeneration===

The first step to understanding the importance of [[macrophages]] in muscle repair, growth, and regeneration is that there are two “waves” of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use – subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle.  The initial wave is a phagocytic population that comes along during periods of increased muscle use that are sufficient to cause muscle membrane lysis and membrane inflammation, which can enter and degrade the contents of injured muscle fibers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krippendorf BB, Riley DA |title=Distinguishing unloading-versus reloading-induced changes in rat soleus muscle |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=16 |pages=99–108 |date=January 1993|doi=10.1002/mus.880160116 |pmid=8423838 |last1=Krippendorf |first1=BB |last2=Riley |first2=DA |issue=1}}</ref><ref name="St Pierre BA, JG Tidball 1994 290–297">{{cite journal |author=St Pierre BA, JG Tidball |title=Differential response of macrophage subpopulations to soleus muscle reloading following rat hindlimb suspension |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=77 |issue=1|pages=290–297 |year=1994 |pmid=7961247}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tidball JG, Berchenko E, Frenette J |title=Macrophage invasion does not contribute to muscle membrane injury during inflammation |journal=Journal of Leukocyte Biology |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=492–498 |year=1999 |pmid=10204578}}</ref>  These early-invading, phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading.<ref name="Schiaffino S, Partridge T 2008 380">{{cite book |author= Schiaffino S, Partridge T |title=Skeletal Muscle Repair and Regeneration |series=Advances in Muscle Research |volume=3 |pages=380 |year=2008)}}</ref>  Their concentration rapidly declines after 48 hours.<ref name="St Pierre BA, JG Tidball 1994 290–297"/> The second group is the non-phagocytic types that are distributed near regenerative fibers.  These peak between two and four days and remain elevated for several days during the hopeful muscle rebuilding.<ref name="St Pierre BA, JG Tidball 1994 290–297"/>  The first subpopulation has no direct benefit to repairing muscle, while the second non-phagocytic group does.

It is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation, differentiation, growth, repair, and regeneration of muscle, but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown.<ref name="Schiaffino S, Partridge T 2008 380"/> It is known that macrophages' involvement in promoting tissue repair is not muscle specific; they accumulate in numerous tissues during the healing process phase following injury.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brechot et al. |title=Modulation of Macrophage Activation State Protects Tissue from Necrosis during Critical Limb Ischemia in Thrombospondin-1-Deficient Mice |journal=PLoS ONE |year=2008|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003950 |editor1-last=Cao |editor1-first=Yihai |last2=Gomez |first2=Elisa |last3=Bignon |first3=Marine |last4=Khallou-Laschet |first4=Jamila |last5=Dussiot |first5=Michael |last6=Cazes |first6=Aurélie |last7=Alanio-Bréchot |first7=Cécile |last8=Durand |first8=Mélanie |last9=Philippe |first9=Josette |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=e3950 |pmid=19079608 |pmc=2597179}}</ref>

A study conducted in 2006 showcased macrophage influences on muscle repair of soleus muscle on mice.<ref name="Tidball JG, Wehling-Henricks M 2007 327–336">{{cite journal |author=Tidball JG, Wehling-Henricks M |title=Macrophages promote muscle membrane repair and muscle fibre growth and regeneration during modified muscle loading in mice in vivo |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=578 |pages=327–336 |year=2007 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2006.118265 |pmid=17038433 |issue=Pt 1 |pmc=2075127}}</ref>

The first procedural step was to make sure macrophages are present in the muscle after onset of muscle injury, and then decrease their presence to see what effects were had on the muscle.  By using [[anti-F4/80]] to bind to macrophages and render them useless, it was seen that when the second wave of macrophages were depleted, there were many more lesions in the muscle cell membrane between the second and fourth day – showing muscle damage when repairing is supposed to occur.  After testing for membrane lesions in both the total amount of muscle fibers present, it was noticed that most of the damage occurred in muscle cells that did not have the second subpopulation of macrophages present.  Macrophages depletion prevents muscle membrane repair.

When examining muscle regeneration, a significant reduction was found in the amount of [[myonuclei]].  Depletion of macrophages was found to cause, between the second and fourth day of repair, much less muscle regeneration compared to muscle with macrophage population.<ref name="Tidball JG, Wehling-Henricks M 2007 327–336"/> Macrophages promote muscle regeneration between the second and fourth day.

To determine the influence of macrophages in muscle growth, muscle cross-sectional area in macrophage-depleted muscle area was measured against two muscle sets: muscle that was injured and had macrophage presence and muscle that was not injured and had macrophage presence.  The macrophage-depleted muscle showed less growth after four days, and injured muscle with macrophages nearly grew back to the level of uninjured muscle.<ref name="Tidball JG, Wehling-Henricks M 2007 327–336"/>  Macrophage depletion reduces muscle growth during a growth period.

The study attempted to examine the appearances of [[Pax7]] and [[MyoD]], but data was not consistent with previous findings.

==Tissue macrophages==

[[Image:macrophage.png|thumb|250px|Macrophage]]

A majority of macrophages are stationed at strategic points where microbial invasion or accumulation of dust is likely to occur. Each type of macrophage, determined by its location, has a specific name:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Name of cell''' || '''Location'''
 |-
 | [[Dust cell]]s/Alveolar macrophages|| [[Pulmonary alveolus]] of [[lungs]]
 |-
 | [[Adipose tissue macrophages]] || [[Adipose tissue]]
 |-
 | [[Histiocytes]]   || [[Connective tissue]]
 |-
 | [[Kupffer cell]]s  || [[Liver]]
 |-
 | [[Microglia]]  || [[Neural tissue]]
 |-
 | [[Epithelioid cell|Epithelioid]] cells  || [[Granulomas]]
 |-
 | [[Osteoclasts]]  || [[Bone]]
 |-
 | [[Hofbauer cell]]  || [[Placenta]]
 |-
 | [[Sinusoid (blood vessel)|Sinusoidal]] lining cells || [[Spleen]]
 |-
 | [[Giant cell]]s || [[Connective tissue]]
 |-
 | [[Peritoneal macrophages]]   || [[Peritoneal cavity]]
|}

Investigations concerning Kupffer cells are hampered because in humans, Kupffer cells are only accessible for immunohistochemical analysis from biopsies or autopsies. From rats and mice, they are difficult to isolate, and after purification, only approximately 5 million cells can be obtained from one mouse.

Macrophages can express [[paracrine]] functions within organs that are specific to the function of that organ.  In the testis for example, macrophages have been shown to be able to interact with [[Leydig cells]] by secreting 25-hydroxycholesterol, an oxysterol that can be converted to testosterone by neighbouring Leydig cells.<ref>http://www.andrologyjournal.org/cgi/reprint/19/4/394</ref>  Also, testicular macrophages may participate in creating an immune privileged environment in the testis, and in mediating infertility during inflammation of the testis.

==Disease==

Due to their role in phagocytosis, macrophages are involved in many diseases of the immune system. For example, they participate in the formation of [[granuloma]]s, inflammatory lesions that may be caused by a large number of diseases. Some disorders, mostly rare, of ineffective phagocytosis and macrophage function have been described, for example.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== As a host for intracellular pathogens ===
In their role as a phagocytic immune cell macrophages are responsible for engulfing pathogens to destroy them. Some pathogens subvert this process and instead live inside the macrophage. This provides an environment in which the pathogen is hidden from the immune system and allows it to replicate.

Diseases with this type of behaviour include [[tuberculosis]] (caused by ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'') and [[leishmaniasis]] (caused by ''[[Leishmania]]'' species).

==== Tuberculosis ====
Once engulfed by a macrophage, the causative agent of [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'',<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn=0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> avoids cellular defenses and uses the cell to replicate.

==== Leishmaniasis ====
Upon phagocytosis by a macrophage, the ''[[Leishmania]]'' parasite finds itself in a phagocytic vacuole. Under normal circumstances, this phagocytic vacuole would develop into a lysosome and its contents would be digested. ''Leishmania'' alter this process and avoid being destroyed; instead, they make a home inside the vacuole.

==== Chikungunya ====
Infection of macrophages in joints is associated with local inflammation during and after the acute phase of ''[[Chikungunya]]'' (caused by ''[[CHIKV or Chikungunya Virus]]''). <ref name="CHIKV persistence in human body">{{cite web |url=http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0001446# |title=Chikungunya Disease: Infection-Associated Markers from the Acute to the Chronic Phase of Arbovirus-Induced Arthralgia |work= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>

=== Heart disease ===
Macrophages are the predominant cells involved in creating the progressive plaque lesions of [[atherosclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lucas AD, Greaves DR |title=Atherosclerosis: role of chemokines and macrophages |journal=Expert Rev Mol Med |volume=3 |issue=25 |pages=1–18 |date=November 2001|pmid=14585150 |doi=10.1017/S1462399401003696 |url=}}</ref>

=== HIV infection ===
Macrophages also play a role in [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) infection. Like [[T cells]], macrophages can be infected with HIV, and even become a reservoir of ongoing virus replication throughout the body. HIV can enter the macrophage through binding of gp120 to CD4 and second membrane receptor, CCR5 (a chemokine receptor). Both circulating monocytes and macrophages serve as a reservoir for the virus.<ref>Sebastiaan Bol, Viviana Cobos-Jiménez, Neeltje Kootstra and Angélique van ’t Wout, Future Virology, February 2011,Dr.Andy Pozo Vol. 6, No. 2, Pages 187–208. http://www.futuremedicine.com/toc/fvl/6/2</ref>

=== Cancer ===
Macrophages contribute to tumor growth and progression. Attracted to oxygen-starved ([[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]]) and necrotic tumor cells they promote [[chronic inflammation]]. Inflammatory compounds such as [[Tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF)-alpha released by the macrophages activate the gene switch [[NF-κB|nuclear factor-kappa B]]. NF-κB then enters the nucleus of a tumor cell and turns on production of proteins that stop [[apoptosis]] and promote cell proliferation and inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gary Stix |title=A Malignant Flame |journal=Scientific American |volume= 297|issue= |pages=46–9 |month=July |year=2007 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-malignant-flame |bibcode=2007SciAm.297a..60S |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0707-60}}</ref> Moreover macrophages serve as a source for many pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-1 and IL-6<ref>Lin EY, Li JF, Gnatovskiy L, Deng Y, Zhu L, Grzesik DA, et al. Macrophages regulate the angiogenic switch in a mouse model of breast cancer. Cancer Res 2006; 66:11238-46.</ref> contributing further to the tumor growth. Macrophages have been shown to infiltrate a number of tumors. Their number correlates with poor prognosis in certain cancers including cancers of breast, cervix, bladder and brain.<ref>Bingle L, Brown NJ, Lewis CE.

J Pathol 2002; 196:254-65.</ref> Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are thought to acquire an M2 phenotype, contributing to tumor growth and progression.

===Obesity===
Increased number of pro-inflammatory macrophages within obese adipose tissue contributes to obesity complications including insulin resistance and diabetes type 2.<ref>Weisberg SP, McCann D, Desai M, Rosenbaum M, Leibel RL, Ferrante AW. Obesity is associated with macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue. Journal of Clinical Investigation 2003; 112:1796-808.</ref>
