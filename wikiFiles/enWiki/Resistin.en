'''Resistin''' also known as '''adipose tissue-specific secretory factor''' (ADSF) or '''C/EBP-epsilon-regulated myeloid-specific secreted cysteine-rich protein''' (XCP1) is a [[cysteine]]-rich [[adipose-derived hormones|adipose-derived]] [[peptide hormone]] that in humans is encoded by the ''RETN'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid12050208">{{cite journal | author = Wang H, Chu WS, Hemphill C, Elbein SC | title = Human resistin gene: molecular scanning and evaluation of association with insulin sensitivity and type 2 diabetes in Caucasians | journal = J.

In [[primates]], pigs, and dogs, resistin is secreted by [[immune]] and [[epithelial]] cells, while, in rodents, it is secreted by [[adipose tissue]]. The length of the resistin [[peptide|pre-peptide]] in human is 108 [[amino acid]] residues and in the mouse and rat it is 114 aa; the [[molecular weight]] is ~12.5 [[kDa]].  Resistin is a [[cytokine]] whose physiologic role has been the subject of much controversy regarding its involvement with [[obesity]] and type II diabetes mellitus ([[diabetes mellitus type 2|T2DM]]).<ref name="pmid17952831">{{cite journal | author = Lazar MA | title = Resistin- and Obesity-associated metabolic diseases | journal = Horm.

Resistin has been shown to cause "high levels of 'bad' [[cholesterol]] (low-density lipoprotein or LDL), increasing the risk of heart disease  [...]  resistin increases the production of LDL in human liver cells and also degrades LDL receptors in the [[liver]].  As a result, the liver is less able to clear 'bad' cholesterol from the body. Resistin accelerates the accumulation of LDL in [[arteries]], increasing the risk of heart disease.  [...] resistin adversely impacts the effects of [[statins]], the main cholesterol-reducing drug used in the treatment and prevention of [[cardiovascular]] disease."<ref name=Canadian scientists discover cause of high cholesterol>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencecodex.com/canadian_scientists_discover_cause_of_high_cholesterol-101029 |title=Canadian scientists discover cause of high cholesterol}} </ref>

Resistin was found to be produced and released from adipose tissue to serve [[endocrine]] functions likely involved in [[insulin resistance]].

This article discusses the current research proposing to link resistin to inflammation and energy homeostasis, including its alleged role in insulin resistance in obese subjects.

== Inflammation ==

Inflammation is the first [[innate immune response]] to [[infection]] or [[irritation]] resulting from [[leukocyte]] ([[neutrophils]], [[mast cells]], etc.) accumulation and their secretion of inflammatory, [[biogenic]] chemicals such as [[histamine]], [[prostaglandin]], and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]].  As cited, it has recently been found that resistin also participates in the inflammatory response.<ref name="p11">{{cite journal | author = Holcomb IN, Kabakoff RC, Chan B, Baker TW, Gurney A, Henzel W, Nelson C, Lowman HB, Wright BD, Skelton NJ, Frantz GD, Tumas DB, Peale FV Jr, Shelton DL, Hébert CC | title = FIZZ1, a novel cysteine-rich secreted protein associated with pulmonary inflammation, defines a new gene family | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 19 | issue = 15 | pages = 4046–55 | year = 2000 | month = August | pmid = 10921885 | pmc = 306596 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/19.15.4046 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="p13">{{cite journal | author = Kusminski CM, da Silva NF, Creely SJ, Fisher FM, Harte AL, Baker AR, Kumar S, McTernan PG | title = The in vitro effects of resistin on the innate immune signaling pathway in isolated human subcutaneous adipocytes | journal = J.

In further support of its inflammatory profile, resistin has been shown to increase transcriptional events, leading to an increased expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including (but not limited to) [[interleukin-1]] (IL-1), [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor-α ([[TNF-α]]) in an [[NF-κB]]-mediated fashion.<ref name="p22">{{cite journal | author = Milan G, Granzotto M, Scarda A, Calcagno A, Pagano C, Federspil G, Vettor R | title = Resistin and adiponectin expression in visceral fat of obese rats: effect of weight loss | journal = Obes.

In accordance, it is expected that, if resistin does indeed serve as a link between obesity and T2DM while at the same time contributing to the inflammatory response, then we should also observe proportional increases in [[chronic inflammation]] in association with obesity and insulin resistance.

Much of what is [[hypothesized]] about a resistin role in energy [[metabolism]] and T2DM can be derived from studies showing strong correlations between resistin and obesity.

The idea that resistin links [[obesity]] to T2DM is now under even more scrutiny, as recent investigations have confirmed a rather vast expression of resistin in many tissues, rather than those only characteristic of obesity, such as adipocytes. 

With nearly as many [[scientists]] against this [[theory]] as those whom support it, the likelihood that resistin will ever be viewed as the key node linking [[obesity]] to T2DM in the near future is very low. The very extent to which these two views oppose each other raises questions about the [[synchrony]] of [[methodology]] used in these respective groups, which resulted in polar opposite results. It is unsurprising, however, that a “[[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]” linking T2DM to [[obesity]] via resistin-mediated pathways would not go unchallenged in a highly [[competitive]] scientific world.  Nevertheless, we can conclude that among this giant [[debate]] lies sufficient [[evidence]] to support the idea that resistin does have some incompletely-defined role in [[energy balance (biology)|energy homeostasis]] while also demonstrating properties that help to incite [[Inflammation|inflammatory responses]] to sites of [[infection]].

Crystal structures of resistin reveal an unusual composition of several subunits that are held together by non-covalent interactions that make up its structure.<ref name="pmid15155948"/> Each protein subunit comprises a carboxy-terminal disulfide-rich beta-sandwich "head" domain and an amino-terminal alpha-helical "tail" segment. The alpha-helical segments associate to form three-stranded coiled coils, and surface-exposed interchain disulfide linkages mediate the formation of tail-to-tail hexamers. The globular domain from resistin contains five disulfide bonds (Cys35-Cys88, Cys47-Cys87, Cys56-Cys73, Cys58-Cys75, and Cys62-Cys77).  This suggests that the disulfide pattern with be conserved.  

The interchain disulfide bonds of resistin and RELMß are novel in that they are highly solvent when exposed, ranging from 84.6% to 89.5%.  An average solvent exposure for all disulfide bonds of 9.9%, and of 16.7% for 1,209 interchain disulfide bonds.  Therefore, the most highly uncovered disulfide bonds found for intact proteins are resistin’s disulfides in high-resolution.

The crystal structure shows a multimeric assembly consisting of hexamer-forming disulfide bonds. A Cys6Ser resistin mutant was substantially more potent at the low concentration and had a greater effect than the wild-type resistin at the high concentration.  This result suggests that processing of the intertrimer disulfide bonds may reflect a mandatory step toward activation. The results also suggest that both the Cys6Ser-mutant and wild-type resistin target mainly the liver.<ref name="pmid15155948"/>
