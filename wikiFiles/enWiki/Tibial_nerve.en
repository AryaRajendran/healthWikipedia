The '''tibial nerve''' is a branch of the [[sciatic nerve]].  The tibial nerve passes through the [[popliteal fossa]] to pass below the arch of soleus. 

In the popliteal fossa the nerve gives off branches to [[gastrocnemius]], [[popliteus]], [[soleus]] and [[plantaris]] muscles, an articular branch to the knee joint, and a cutaneous branch that will become the [[sural nerve]]. The sural nerve is joined by fibres from the [[common fibular nerve]] and runs down the calf to supply the lateral side of the foot. 

Below the soleus muscle the nerve lies close to the [[tibia]] and supplies the [[tibialis posterior]], the [[flexor digitorum longus]] and the [[flexor hallucis longus]]. The nerve passes into the foot running posterior to the [[medial malleolus]]. Here it is bound down by the [[Flexor retinaculum of foot|flexor retinaculum]] in company with the [[posterior tibial artery]]. 

==Branches==
In the foot, the nerve divides into medial and lateral plantar branches. 

===Medial plantar nerve ===
The [[medial plantar nerve]] supplies: the [[abductor hallucis]], the [[flexor digitorum brevis]], the [[flexor hallucis brevis]] and the first [[Lumbricals of the foot|lumbrical]]. Cutaneous distribution of the medial plantar nerve is to the medial sole and medial three and one half toes, including the nail beds on the dorsum (like the median nerve in the hand). Mnemonic LAFF muscles (pronounced "laugh") L-first Lumbrical, A- Abductor Hallucis, F- Flexor digitorum brevis, F- flexor hallucis brevis

===Lateral plantar nerve===
The [[lateral plantar nerve]] supplies [[quadratus plantae]], [[Flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor digiti minimi]], [[adductor hallucis]], the [[interossei]], three [[Lumbricals of the foot|lumbrical]]s. and [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor digiti minimi]]. [[Cutaneous innervation]] is to the lateral sole and lateral one and one half toes (like the [[ulnar nerve]]).
