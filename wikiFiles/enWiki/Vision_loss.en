'''Vision loss''' or '''visual loss''' is the absence of [[Visual perception|vision]] where it existed before, which can happen either [[Acute (medical)|acutely]] (i.e. abruptly) or [[chronic (medicine)|chronically]] (i.e. over a long period of time).

==Ranges of vision loss==
Various scales have been developed to describe the extent of vision and vision loss based on [[visual acuity]].<ref name="ICO">International Council of Ophthalmology. [http://www.icoph.org/pdf/visualstandardsreport.pdf "International Standards: Visual Standards â€” Aspects and Ranges of Vision Loss with Emphasis on Popular Surveys."] April 2002.</ref> Early editions of the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD]] described a simple distinction between "legally sighted" and "legally blind".<ref name="ICO"/> The ICD-9 released in 1979  introduced the smallest continuous scale which consisted of three tiers: normal vision, [[low vision]], and [[blindness]].<ref>World Health Organization. ''International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9)'', World Health Organization, Geneva, 1977.</ref>

==Acute visual loss==
''Acute visual loss'' may be dramatic in presentation.
It may be caused by media opacities, [[retina]]l disease, [[optic nerve]] disease, [[#Visual pathway disorder|visual pathway disorder]]s, or [[#Functional disorder|functional disorder]]s, or it may be in fact an acute discovery of chronic visual loss.

===Media opacity===
Opacities of the clear refractive media of the [[human eye|eye]] such as the [[cornea]], anterior chamber, [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and [[vitreous humor]] may cause acute visual loss as manifested by blurry vision or reduced [[visual acuity]].
While [[pupillary reflex]]es may be affected, these conditions generally do not cause a [[relative afferent pupillary defect]].

Causes of media opacity include [[corneal edema]], [[hyphema]], [[cataract]] and [[vitreous hemorrhage]].

===Retinal disease===
Retinal diseases may cause sudden visual loss.
Because the retina is being affected, there is usually a concomitant relative afferent pupillary defect.
Conditions that affect or destroy the retina include [[retinal detachment]]; [[macula]]r disease (''e.g.'', [[macular degeneration]]); and [[retinal vascular occlusion]]s, the most important of which is central retinal artery occlusion.
Current research (2013) has raised the possibility of complete regeneration of the retina. (see [[Retinal regeneration]])

===Optic nerve disease===
Diseases which affect the optic nerve may cause acute visual loss.
[[Sign (medicine)|Sign]]s include an abnormal pupillary reflex, with an afferent pupillary defect when the optic nerve disease is unilateral. It can also be caused by [[strobe light]].

The [[optic nerve]] can be affected by many diseases including [[optic neuritis]], [[retrobulbar neuritis]], [[papillitis]], [[papilledema]], [[glaucoma]], [[ischemic optic neuropathy]], and [[giant cell arteritis]].

===Hypoxia===
The eye is very sensitive to restriction of its supply of oxygen.  A dimming of vision (a ''brownout'' or ''[[Greyout (medical)|greyout]]'') accompanied by loss of peripheral perception may result from low blood pressure, [[Shock (medical)|shock]], [[g-LOC]] (an aviation related problem) or simply standing up suddenly, especially if sick or otherwise infirm.  Vision usually returns readily once the conditions restricting blood flow are lifted.

===Visual pathway disorder===
Visual pathway disorders are any problems that may impede the [[visual pathway]].
Rarely, acute visual loss is caused by [[homonymous hemianopia]] and, more rarely, [[cortical blindness]].

Also traumatic causes can lead to Acute Vision Loss.

===Functional disorder===
The term '''functional disorder''' is now used where [[Hysteria|hysterical]] and [[malingering]] were historically used.
This shift recognizes the inherent inability of the physician to identify the subjective experience of a patient (and thus whether that patient can truly see or not).
