The '''soul patch''' (also known as a mouche<ref>"mouche, ''n''." ''OED Online''. June 2003. Oxford University Press. accessed 11 Oct 2010 - "a small patch of beard shaped and allowed to grow under the lower lip"</ref>) is a small patch of [[facial hair]] just below the lower lip and above the chin. It came to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was a style of [[facial hair]] common among [[African American]] men, most notably jazzmen. It became popular with [[beatnik]]s, [[artists]], and those who frequented the jazz scene and moved in literary and artistic circles. Jazz [[trumpeter]]s in particular preferred the [[goatee]] for the comfort it provided when using a trumpet [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]].<ref>Maggin, Donald L.: ''Dizzy: The Life and Times of John Birks Gillespie''.

The soul patch has become a common facial fashion among young men.
