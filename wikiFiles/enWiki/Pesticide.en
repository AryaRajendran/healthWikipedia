'''Pesticides''' are substances meant for preventing, destroying or mitigating any [[pest (animal)|pest]].<ref>US Environmental (July 24, 2007), [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/index.htm What is a pesticide?] epa.gov. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.</ref> 
They are a class of [[biocide]]. The most common use of pesticides is as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general protect plants from damaging influences such as weeds, diseases or insects. This use of pesticides is so common that the term ''pesticide'' is often treated as synonymous with ''plant protection product'', although it is in fact a broader term, as pesticides are also used for non-agricultural purposes. 

A pesticide is generally a [[chemical]] or biological agent (such as a [[virus]], [[bacterium]], [[antimicrobial]] or [[disinfectant]]) that through its effect deters, incapacitates, kills or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include [[insect]]s, plant [[pathogen]]s, weeds, [[mollusca|mollusks]], [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[fish]], nematodes ([[roundworm]]s), and [[microbe]]s that destroy property, cause nuisance, spread disease or are [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] for disease. Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other animals. According to the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]], 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent [[organic chemicals]] are pesticides.<ref>http://www.pops.int/documents/guidance/beg_guide.pdf</ref><ref name="Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B 2010 103–10">{{cite journal |author=Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B |title=Pesticides and health risks |journal=J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=103–10 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20409108 |doi=10.1111/j.1552-6909.2009.01092.x |url=}}</ref>

==Definition==
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) has defined ''pesticide'' as:
:''any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage,  transport or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances which may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids or other pests in or on their bodies.  The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit. Also used as substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.''<ref name=code />

Pesticides can be classified by target [[organism]] (e.g. [[herbicides]], [[insecticides]], [[fungicides]], [[rodenticides]], and [[pediculicides]]<ref name="Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B 2010 103–10"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chromatography-online.org/directory/analtcat-24/page.html |title=www.chromatography-online.org |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> - see table), chemical structure (e.g. organic, inorganic, synthetic, or [[biopesticide|biological (biopesticide)]],<ref name=Council1997/> although the distinction can sometimes blur), and physical state (e.g. [[fumigation|gaseous (fumigant)]]).<ref name=Council1997/> [[Biopesticide]]s include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides.<ref>EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/types.htm Types of Pesticides]. Last updated on Thursday, January 29th, 2009.</ref> Plant-derived pesticides, or "botanicals", have been developing quickly. These include the [[pyrethrum|pyrethroid]]s, [[rotenone|rotenoid]]s, [[nicotine|nicotinoid]]s, and a fourth group that includes [[strychnine]] and [[scilliroside]].<ref name=Kamrin1997>Kamrin MA. (1997). ''Pesticide Profiles: toxicity, environmental impact, and fate.'' CRC Press.</ref>{{Rp|15}}

Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include [[organochlorine]]s, [[organophosphate]]s, and [[carbamate]]s. [[Organochlorine]] hydrocarbons (e.g. [[DDT]]) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate.<ref name=Kamrin1997/>{{Rp|239-240}} [[Organophosphate]] and [[carbamate]]s largely replaced [[organochlorine]]s. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]], allowing [[acetylcholine]] to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.<ref name=Kamrin1997/>{{Rp|136-137}} Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include pheoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. [[2,4-D]]), triazines (e.g. [[atrazine]]), ureas (e.g. [[diuron]]), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g. [[alachlor]]). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broadleaved weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system.<ref name=Kamrin1997/>{{Rp|300}} Triazines interfere with photosynthesis.<ref name=Kamrin1997/>{{Rp|335}} Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including [[glyphosate]].

Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method. Most pesticides work by [[poison]]ing pests.<ref>Cornell University.  [http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/facts-slides-self/core-tutorial/module04/index.html Toxicity of pesticides]. Pesticide fact sheets and tutorial, module 4. Pesticide Safety Education Program.   Retrieved on 2007-10-10.</ref> A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant. With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the [[xylem]]) and outward. Increased efficiency may be a result. Systemic insecticides, which poison [[pollen]] and [[nectar]] in the [[flower]]s, may kill [[bees]] and other needed [[pollinator]]s. 

In 2009, the development of a new class of fungicides called paldoxins was announced. These work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called phytoalexins, which fungi then detoxify using enzymes. The paldoxins inhibit the fungi's detoxification enzymes. They are believed to be safer and greener.<ref>EurekAlert. (2009). [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/acs-np030909.php New 'green' pesticides are first to exploit plant defenses in battle of the fungi].</ref>

==Types==
Pesticides are often referred to according to the type of pest they control. Pesticides can also be considered as either biodegradable pesticides, which will be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds, or persistent pesticides, which may take months or years before they are broken down: it was the persistence of DDT, for example, which led to its accumulation in the food chain and its killing of birds of prey at the top of the food chain. Another way to think about pesticides is to consider those that are chemical pesticides or are derived from a common source or production method.<ref name=US-EPA>{{cite web|title=Types of Pesticides|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/types.htm|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref> 

Some examples of chemically-related pesticides are:

===Organophosphate pesticides===


These pesticides affect the nervous system by disrupting the enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Most organophosphates are insecticides. They were developed during the early 19th century, but their effects on insects, which are similar to their effects on humans, were discovered in 1932. Some are very poisonous (they were used in World War II as nerve agents). However, they usually are not persistent in the environment.

===Carbamate pesticides===


Carbamate pesticides affect the nervous system by disrupting an enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. The enzyme effects are usually reversible. There are several subgroups within the carbamates.

===Organochlorine insecticides===


They were commonly used in the past, but many have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects and their persistence (e.g. DDT and chlordane).

===Pyrethroid pesticides===


They were developed as a synthetic version of the naturally occurring pesticide pyrethrin, which is found in chrysanthemums. They have been modified to increase their stability in the environment. Some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system.

===Biopesticides===

Biopesticides are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals. For example, canola oil and baking soda have pesticidal applications and are considered biopesticides. At the end of 2001, there were approximately 195 registered biopesticide active ingredients and 780 products. Biopesticides fall into three major classes:

*Microbial pesticides consist of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium, fungus, virus or protozoan) as the active ingredient. Microbial pesticides can control many different kinds of pests, although each separate active ingredient is relatively specific for its target pest[s]. For example, there are fungi that control certain weeds, and other fungi that kill specific insects.

The most widely used microbial pesticides are subspecies and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt. Each strain of this bacterium produces a different mix of proteins, and specifically kills one or a few related species of insect larvae. While some Bt's control moth larvae found on plants, other Bt's are specific for larvae of flies and mosquitoes. The target insect species are determined by whether the particular Bt produces a protein that can bind to a larval gut receptor, thereby causing the insect larvae to starve

*Plant-Incorporated-Protectants (PIPs) are pesticidal substances that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant. For example, scientists can take the gene for the Bt pesticidal protein, and introduce the gene into the plant's own genetic material. Then the plant, instead of the Bt bacterium, manufactures the substance that destroys the pest. The protein and its genetic material, but not the plant itself, are regulated by EPA.

*Biochemical pesticides are naturally occurring substances that control pests by non-toxic mechanisms. Conventional pesticides, by contrast, are generally synthetic materials that directly kill or inactivate the pest. Biochemical pesticides include substances, such as insect sex pheromones, that interfere with mating, as well as various scented plant extracts that attract insect pests to traps. Because it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a substance meets the criteria for classification as a biochemical pesticide, EPA has established a special committee to make such decisions.

The term pesticide also include these substances:

'''Defoliants''' : Cause leaves or other foliage to drop from a plant, usually to facilitate harvest.<br />
'''Desiccants''' : Promote drying of living tissues, such as unwanted plant tops.<br />
'''Insect growth regulators''' : Disrupt the molting, maturity from pupal stage to adult, or other life processes of insects.<br /> 
'''Plant growth regulators''' : Substances (excluding fertilizers or other plant nutrients) that alter the expected growth, flowering, or reproduction rate of plants.

Pesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful.<ref name="purdue">[http://www.btny.purdue.edu/Pubs/PPP/PPP-70.pdf The benefits of pesticides: A story worth telling]. Purdue.edu. Retrieved on September 15, 2007.</ref> For example, they are used to kill [[mosquitoes]] that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like [[West Nile virus]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]]. They can also kill [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s or [[ant]]s that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by [[parasitism|parasites]] such as [[flea]]s.<ref name="purdue"/> Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by [[mold]]y food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush. They can also kill invasive [[weed]]s that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control [[algae]] and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant.<ref name="VCE">Helfrich, LA, Weigmann, DL, Hipkins, P, and Stinson, ER (June 1996), [http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/waterquality/420-013/420-013.html#L4 Pesticides and aquatic animals: A guide to reducing impacts on aquatic systems].

Retrieved on 2007-10-14.</ref> Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mould can damage structures such as houses.<ref name="purdue"/> Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage [[rodents]] and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.

[[DDT]], sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochloride that has been used  to fight [[malaria]] since the 1950s. Recent policy statements by the [[World Health Organization]] have given stronger support to this approach.<ref name="who mal">World Health Organization (September 15, 2006), [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/ WHO gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria].

Symptoms include nervous excitement, tremors, convulsions or death.  Scientists estimate that DDT and other chemicals in the organophosphate class of pesticides have saved 7 million human lives since 1945 by preventing the transmission of diseases such as [[malaria]], [[bubonic plague]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and [[typhus]].<ref name="sustaining"/> However, DDT use is not always effective, as [[Pesticide resistance|resistance to DDT]] was identified in Africa as early as 1955, and by 1972 nineteen species of mosquito worldwide were resistant to DDT.<ref>[http://magazine.panna.org/summer2006/inDepthDDT.html PANNA: PAN Magazine: In Depth: DDT & Malaria<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A study for the [[World Health Organization]] in 2000 from Vietnam established that non-DDT malaria controls were significantly more effective than DDT use.<ref>http://www.afronets.org/files/malaria.pdf</ref> The ecological effect of DDT on organisms is an example of [[bioaccumulation]].

Even consuming organic food, these chemicals can have a negative health impact. Though the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the amount of each pesticide that may be present on a food item, there exists no limit to the number of different chemicals that can be used. This leads to a possibly even more dangerous effect known as a "chemical cocktail". The chemicals may form one of many dangerous interactions and have an unmeasured synergistic effect.<ref>University of Arizona. 2006. Pesticide Versus Organically Grown Food.

Pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide  ([[pesticide resistance]]), necessitating a new pesticide. Alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance, although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem.

Since chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides [[Fat-soluble|dissolve in fats]] and are not excreted, organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely. [[Biomagnification|Biological magnification]] is the process whereby these chlorinated hydrocarbons (pesticides) are more concentrated at each level of the food chain. Among marine animals, pesticide concentrations are higher in carnivorous fishes, and even more so in the fish-eating birds and mammals at the top of the [[ecological pyramid]].<ref name="Castro">Castro, Peter, and Michael E.Huber. Marine Biology. 8th. New York: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc., 2010. Print.</ref> [[Global distillation]] is the process whereby pesticides are transported from warmer to colder regions of the Earth, particularly the Poles and mountain tops.  Pesticides which evaporate into the atmosphere at relatively high temperature can be carried considerable distances (thousands of kilometers) by the wind to an area of lower temperature, where they condense and are carried back to the ground in rain or snow.<ref name="Quinn">L.

Human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the United States is estimated at $9.6 billion:<ref name="Pimental">Pimentel, David. "Environmental and Economic Costs of the Application of Pesticides Primarily in the United States." Environment, Development and Sustainability 7 (2005): 229-252., [http://www.beyondpesticides.org/documents/pimentel.pesticides.2005update.pdf]. Retrieved on February 25, 2011.</ref>{{elucidate|date=February 2013}}

Additional costs include the registration process and the cost of purchasing pesticides. The registration process can take several years to complete (there are 70 different types of field test) and can cost $50–70 million for a single pesticide.<ref name="Pimental" /> Annually the United States spends $10 billion on pesticides.<ref name="Pimental" />

==Benefits==
There are two levels of benefits for pesticide use, primary and secondary. Primary benefits are direct gains from the use of pesticides and secondary benefits are effects that are more long-term.<ref name="Cooper" />

===Primary benefits===

''1. Controlling pests and plant disease vectors''
*Improved crop/livestock yields
*Improved crop/livestock quality
*Invasive species controlled
''2. Controlling human/livestock disease vectors and nuisance organisms''
*Human lives saved and suffering reduced
*Animal lives saved and suffering reduced
*Diseases contained geographically
''3. Controlling organisms that harm other human activities and structures''
*Drivers view unobstructed
*Tree/brush/leaf hazards prevented
*Wooden structures protected <ref name="Cooper" />

===Secondary benefits===
''1. Community benefits''
*Farm and agribusiness revenues
*Nutrition and health improved
*Food safety and security
''2. National benefits''
*Workforce productivity increased
*Increased export revenues
*National agriculture economy
''3. Global benefits''
*Assured safe and diverse food supply
*Less greenhouse gas
*Reduced civil unrest <ref name="Cooper" />

===Monetary===
Every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved.<ref name="Pimental1992">Pimentel, David, H. Acquay, M. Biltonen, P. Rice, and M. Silva. "Environmental and Economic Costs of Pesticide Use." BioScience 42.10 (1992): 750-60., [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1311994]. Retrieved on February 25, 2011.</ref> This means based on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, that there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds. Generally speaking, farmers benefit from having an increase crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year. Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year round.<ref name="Cooper">Cooper, Jerry and Hans Dobson. "The benefits of pesticides to mankind and the environment." Crop Protection 26 (2007): 1337-1348., [http://www.croplifefoundation.org/Documents/Research%20Briefs/PesticideBenefitsResearchPaper.pdf] Retrieved on February 25, 2011.</ref> The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria.<ref name="Cooper" /> The use of pesticides creates a large job market, which provides jobs for all of the people who work within the industry.

==Alternatives==
Alternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of [[biological pest control]]s (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), [[genetic engineering]], and methods of interfering with insect breeding.<ref name="sustaining"/>  Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.<ref name="nematodes">[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2619736 R. McSorley and R. N. Gallaher, "Effect of Yard Waste Compost on Nematode Densities and Maize Yield", ''J Nematology'', Vol. 2, No. 4S, pp. 655–660, Dec. 1996.]</ref> These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides. In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.

Cultivation practices include [[polyculture]] (growing multiple types of plants), [[crop rotation]], planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of [[trap crop]]s that attract pests away from the real crop.<ref name="sustaining"/> In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.<ref name="sustaining"/>

Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use. These organisms can include natural [[predator]]s or [[parasite]]s of the pests.<ref name="sustaining"/> [[Biological pesticides]] based on [[entomopathogenic fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es cause disease in the pest species can also be used.<ref name="sustaining"/>

Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by [[Sterile insect technique|sterilizing males]] of the target species and releasing them, so that they [[mating|mate]] with females but do not produce offspring.<ref name="sustaining"/> This technique was first used on the [[Cochliomyia hominivorax|screwworm fly]] in 1958 and has since been used with the [[medfly]], the [[tsetse fly]],<ref>(July 2007), [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/B/Biocontrols.html The biological control of pests]. Retrieved on September 17, 2007.</ref> and the [[gypsy moth]].<ref>[http://history.nasa.gov/SP-401/ch17.htm SP-401 Skylab, Classroom in Space: Part III - Science Demonstrations, Chapter 17: Life Sciences]. History.nasa.gov. Retrieved on September 17, 2007.</ref> However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.<ref name="sustaining"/>

Another alternative to pesticides is the thermal treatment of soil through steam. [[Soil steam sterilization|Soil steaming]] kills pest and increases soil health.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In India, traditional pest control methods include using [[Panchakavya]], the "mixture of five products." The method has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity due in part to use by the organic farming community.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Push pull strategy===
{{main|Push–pull technology}}

The term "push-pull" was established in 1987 as an approach for [[integrated pest management]] (IPM).  This strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects. "Push" means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected.  "Pull" means that certain stimuli (semiochemical stimuli, pheromones, food additives, visual stimuli, genetically altered plants, etc.) are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed <ref name="annualreviews.org.silk.library.umass.edu">http://www.annualreviews.org.silk.library.umass.edu:2048/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ento.52.110405.091407?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed</ref>  There are numerous different components involved in order to implement a Push-Pull Strategy in IPM.

Many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world.  The most successful push-pull strategy was developed in Africa for subsistence farming.  Another successful case study was performed on the control of ''Helicoverpa'' in cotton crops in Australia.  In Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of ''Sitona lineatus'' in bean fields.<ref name="annualreviews.org.silk.library.umass.edu"/>

Some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method.  Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable.  Furthermore, because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of IPM operational and registration costs are higher.<ref name="test">{{cite web|url = http://h2oc.com/pdfs/Occurrence.pdf|title = Arsenic in Drinking Water: 3. Occurrence in U.S. Waters|accessdate = 2010-05-15}}</ref>

===Effectiveness===

Some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals. For example, [[Sweden]] has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops.<ref name="sustaining"/> In Indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase.<ref name="sustaining"/>  A study of [[Maize]] fields in northern Florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic [[nematodes]] and increasing crop yield, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212%; the observed effects were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study.<ref name="nematodes" />

However, pesticide resistance is increasing. In the 1940s, U.S. farmers lost only 7% of their crops to pests.  Since the 1980s, loss has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used.  Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945.<ref>http://www.panna.org/issues/pesticides-101-primer#2</ref>

==Regulation==

===International===

In Europe, recent EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are [[carcinogenic]], [[mutagenic]] or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are persistent, [[bioaccumulative]] and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB). {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Measures were approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/066-45937-012-01-03-911-20090112IPR45936-12-01-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm Pesticide Legislation Approved] last retrieved 13 January 2009</ref> 

Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides and products on which they were used are traded across international borders. To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries.<ref name="regWillson"/> The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002.<ref>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, [http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/Code/PM_Code.htm Programmes: International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides]. Retrieved on 2007-10-25.</ref> The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.<ref name=code>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2002),  [http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/Code/Download/code.pdf  International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides]. Retrieved on 2007-10-25.</ref>

Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the [[United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade]] and the [[Codex Alimentarius|United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission]] {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.  The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.<ref name ="reynoldsjd">Reynolds, JD (1997), [http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/Vol131/REYN.HTMl International pesticide trade: Is there any hope for the effective regulation of controlled substances?] ''Florida State University Journal of Land Use & Environmental Law'', Volume 131. Retrieved on 2007-10-16.</ref> Both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis.<ref name ="reynoldsjd"/>  

Pesticide safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from [[pesticide misuse]], but do not eliminate all misuse. Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use.<ref name="VCE"/>  [[Integrated pest management]], the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Bangladesh]], the U.S., [[Australia]], and [[Mexico]].<ref name="sustaining"/> IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an [[ecosystem]], so that natural balances are not upset.<ref name="Daly">Daly H, Doyen JT, and Purcell AH III (1998), ''Introduction to insect biology and diversity'', 2nd edition.

In addition, applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides.

Pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pest's life cycle, which can be environmentally more friendly.<ref name="potatonema">''Science Daily'', (October 11, 2001), [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/10/011010074556.htm Environmentally-friendly pesticide to combat potato cyst nematodes].

== History ==
Since before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops. The first known pesticide was elemental [[sulfur]] dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The [[Rig Veda]], which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control.<ref>Rao GVR, Rupela OP, Rao VR and Reddy YVR (2007) [http://dspace.icrisat.ac.in/dspace/bitstream/10731/391/1/Role%20of%20biopesticides..prospects.pdf "Role of biopesticides in crop protection: present status and future prospects"] ''Indian Journal of Plant Protection'', '''35''' (1): 1–9.</ref> By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as [[arsenic]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[lead]] were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, [[nicotine]] [[sulfate]] was extracted from [[tobacco]] leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, [[pyrethrum]], which is derived from [[chrysanthemum]]s, and [[rotenone]], which is derived from the roots of tropical [[vegetable]]s.<ref name=Miller2002>Miller, GT (2002). ''Living in the Environment'' (12th Ed.). Belmont: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning. ISBN 0-534-37697-5</ref> Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant.<ref name=Pinpointing>Ritter SR.

''C&E News''.</ref>   [[Paul Hermann Müller|Paul Müller]] discovered that [[DDT]] was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, [[pyrethrin]] compounds have become the dominant insecticide.<ref name=Pinpointing/> Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".<ref name=Pinpointing/>

The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910;<ref>Goldman, L.R. (2007). "Managing pesticide chronic health risks: U.S. policies."

In the 1960s, it was discovered that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to [[biodiversity]]. [[Rachel Carson]] wrote the best-selling book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' about [[biological magnification]]. The agricultural use of DDT is now banned under the [[Stockholm Convention]] on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent [[malaria]] and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes.<ref>Lobe, J (Sept 16, 2006), [http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0916-05.htm "WHO urges DDT for malaria control Strategies,"] Inter Press Service, cited from Commondreams.org.
