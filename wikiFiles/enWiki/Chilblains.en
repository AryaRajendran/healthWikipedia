'''Chilblains''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|tʃ|ɪ|l|b|l|eɪ|n|z}}; also known as '''pernio''' and '''perniosis''')<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}</ref>
is a medical condition that is often confused with [[frostbite]] and [[trench foot]]. Chilblains are a tissue injury that occurs when a predisposed individual is exposed to cold and humidity. The cold exposure damages [[capillary beds]] in the [[skin]], which in turn can cause [[redness]], [[itching]], [[blisters]], and [[inflammation]].<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coldstress/ Cold Stress: Chilblains]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Retrieved January 6, 2009.</ref> Chilblains  are often [[idiopathic]] in origin but can be manifestations of serious medical conditions that need to be investigated. Chilblains can be prevented by keeping the feet and hands warm in cold weather.  A history of chilblains is suggestive of a [[connective tissue disease]].  Rarely, chilblains in infants, together with severe neurologic disease and unexplained fevers, can be seen in [[Aicardi–Goutières syndrome]], a rare inherited condition.

== Signs and symptoms ==

* [[Nifedipine]] may be used in more severe or recurrent cases.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rustin |first1=M.H.A. |last2=Newton |first2=Julia A. |last3=Smith |first3=N.P. |last4=Dowd |first4=Pauline M. |title=The treatment of chilblains with nifedipine: the results of a pilot study, a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study and a long-term open trial |journal=British Journal of Dermatology |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=267–75 |year=2006 |pmid=2647123 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1989.tb07792.x}}</ref> Its [[vasodilation]] helps reduce pain, facilitate healing and prevent recurrences.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1=T.
