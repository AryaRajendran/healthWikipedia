However, PTA duration may be linked to the likelihood that psychiatric and behavioral problems will occur as consequences of TBI.<ref name=Silver05/>

Classification systems for determining the severity of TBI may use duration of PTA alone or with other factors such as [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (GCS) score and duration of [[loss of consciousness]] (LOC) to divide TBI into categories of mild, moderate, and severe.  One common system using all three factors and one using PTA alone are shown in the tables at right. Duration of PTA usually correlates well with GCS and usually lasts about four times longer than unconsciousness.<ref name=Howieson04>{{cite book |author=Hannay HJ, Howieson DB, Loring DW, Fischer JS, Lezak MD |editor= Lezak MD, Howieson DB, Loring DW|chapter=Neuropathology for neuropsychologists|title=Neuropsychological Assessment |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004 |pages=160 |isbn=0-19-511121-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

PTA is considered a hallmark of [[concussion]],<ref name=Rees03/> and is used as a measure of predicting its severity, for example in [[concussion grading scales]]. It may be more reliable for determining severity of concussion than GCS because the latter may not be sensitive enough; concussion sufferers often quickly regain a GCS score of 15.<ref name=vanderNaalt/>

Longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual symptoms from concussion.<ref name=Masferrer>

==Assessment==
Duration of PTA may be difficult to gauge accurately; it may be overestimated (for example, if the patient is asleep or under the influence of drugs or alcohol for part of the time) or underestimated (for example, if some memories come back before continuous memory is regained).<ref name=vanderNaalt/>  The [http://www.utmb.edu/psychology/Adultrehab/GOAT.htm Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test] (GOAT) exists to determine how oriented a patient is and how much material they are able to recall.<ref name=Silver05>

The GOAT is the most widely used standardized scale for the prospective assessment of PTA. The test is made up of 10 items that assess orientation and recollection of the events before and after the injury. It can be used to assess the duration of PTA; this particular GOAT assessment has been found to strongly predict functional outcome as measured by the [[Glasgow Outcome Scale]], return to productivity, psychosocial function and distress.<ref>Baird, A., Papadopoulou, K., Greenwood, R., Cipolotti, L.
