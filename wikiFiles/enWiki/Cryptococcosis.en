'''Cryptococcosis''', or '''cryptococcal disease''', is a potentially fatal [[fungal disease]]. It is caused by one of two species; ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' and ''[[Cryptococcus gattii]]''. These were all previously thought to be subspecies of ''C. neoformans'', but have now been identified as distinct species.

Cryptococcosis is believed to be acquired by [[inhalation]] of the infectious propagule from the environment. Although the exact nature of the infectious [[propagule]] is unknown, the leading hypothesis is the [[basidiospore]] created through sexual or asexual reproduction.

== Cause ==
 
Cryptococcosis is a defining opportunistic infection for [[AIDS]]. Other conditions which pose an increased risk include certain [[lymphoma]]s (e.g. [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]), [[sarcoidosis]], liver [[cirrhosis]] and patients on long-term [[corticosteroid]] therapy.

Distribution is worldwide in soil.<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=Meningitis: cryptococcal: Overview |date=September 2010 |work=Medical Reference: Encyclopedia |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center |url=http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/000642.htm}}</ref> The prevalence of cryptococcosis has been increasing over the past 20 years for many reasons, including the increase in incidence of AIDS and the expanded use of immunosuppressive drugs. 

In humans, ''C. neoformans'' causes three types of infections:
* Wound or [[cutaneous]] cryptococcosis
* [[Pulmonary]] cryptococcosis, and
* Cryptococcal [[meningitis]].
Cryptococcal meningitis (infection of the [[meninges]], the tissue covering the brain) is believed to result from dissemination of the fungus from either an observed or unappreciated pulmonary infection. Often there is also silent dissemination throughout the brain when meningitis is present. ''Cryptococcus gattii'' causes infections in immunocompetent people (those having a functioning [[immune system]]), but ''C. neoformans v. grubii'', and ''v. neoformans'' usually only cause clinically evident infections in persons who have some form of defect in their immune systems (immunocompromised persons).  People who have defects in their [[cell-mediated immunity]], for example, people with [[AIDS]], are especially susceptible to disseminated cryptococcosis. Cryptococcosis is often fatal, even if treated. The 10-week survival averages near 70% with optimal therapy.

Although the most common presentation of cryptococcosis is of ''C. neoformans'' infection in an immunocompromised person (such as persons living with AIDS), the ''C. gattii'' is being increasingly recognised as a pathogen in presumptively immunocompetent hosts, especially in Canada and Australia. This may be due to rare exposure and high pathogenicity, or to unrecognised isolated defects in immunity, specific for this organism.

== Diagnosis ==

Dependent on the infectious syndrome, symptoms include fever, fatigue, chest pain, dry cough, swelling of abdomen, headache, blurred vision and confusion.<ref name="Barron">{{cite journal |author=Barron MA and Madinger NE |title=Opportunistic Fungal Infections, Part 3: Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, and Emerging Mould Infections |journal=Infections in Medicine|date=November 18, 2008 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/infection/article/1145625/1404367?pageNumber=1}}</ref>  

Detection of cryptococcal [[antigen]] (capsular material) by [[Microbiological culture|culture]] of [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]], [[sputum]] and [[urine]] provides definitive diagnosis.<ref name=Rhein />  Blood cultures may be positive in heavy infections. [[India ink]] of the CSF is a traditional microscopic method of diagnosis, although the sensitivity is poor in early infection, and may miss up to >=20% of patients with culture-positive cryptococcal meningitis.

Cryptococcosis can rarely occur in the immunocompetent person without [[HIV]], when it usually goes undiagnosed. Less than 250 cases in all are reported in the medical literature, the majority diagnosed [[postmortem]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|215354|Cryptococcosis}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Treatment options in non-AIDS patients who have reduced immune-system function is not well studied. [[Intravenous]] [[Amphotericin B]] combined with [[Wiktionary:oral|oral]] [[flucytosine]] may be effective. Every attempt should be made to reduce the amount of immunosuppressive medication until the infection is resolved.

Persons living with AIDS often have a greater burden of disease and higher mortality (30-70% at 10-weeks), but recommended therapy is with [[Amphotericin B]] (0.7-1.0 mg/kg/day) and flucytosine. Where flucytosine (5FC) is not available, [[fluconazole]] 800-1200mg/day should be used adjunctively with amphotericin.<ref name="WHO Recs">{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Rapid advice: Diagnosis, prevention and management of cryptococcal disease in HIV-infected adults, adolescents and children|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/cryptococcal_disease2011/en/|accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> [[Amphotericin]]-based induction therapy has much greater microbiologic activity than [[fluconazole]] monotherapy with 30% better survival at 10-weeks.<ref name="Rhein">{{cite journal|last=Rhein|first=J|coauthors=Boulware DR,|title=Prognosis and management of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with HIV infection|journal=Neurobehavioral HIV Medicine|year=2012|volume=4|pages=45|doi=10.2147/NBHIV.S24748|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/NBHIV.S24748}}</ref><ref name=Rajasingham>{{cite journal|last=Rajasingham|first=Radha|coauthors=Rolfes, M.A.; Birkenkamp, K.E.; Meya, D.B.; Boulware, D.R.|title=Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment Strategies in Resource-Limited Settings: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2012|volume=9|issue=9|pages=e1001316|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001316|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1001316|accessdate=26 September 2012|editor1-last=Farrar|editor1-first=Jeremy|pmid=23055838|pmc=3463510}}</ref>  Based on a systematic review of existing data, the most cost-effective induction treatment in resource-limited settings appears to be one week of amphotericin B 1mg/kg/day coupled with high dose [[fluconazole]] 1200mg/day.<ref name=Rajasingham />    After initial treatment as above, oral [[fluconazole]] can be used.<ref name="WHO Recs" />   The decision on when to start treatment for HIV is not yet settled, although one small, under-powered trial (when restricting to a "per protocol analysis") suggested that delaying the start of treatment for several weeks may be beneficial in avoiding deaths from [[Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome]] (IRIS).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Early versus delayed initiation of antiretroviral therapy for concurrent HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis in sub-saharan Africa|author=Makadzange AT, Ndhlovu CE, Takarinda K, Reid M, Kurangwa M, Gona P, Hakim JG|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=2010|volume=50|issue=11|pages=1532&ndash;8|doi=10.1086/652652}}|pmid= 20415574}</ref> A larger multisite trial, the [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01075152 Cryptococcal Optimal ART Timing (COAT) Trial], will be completed in spring 2013.

=== IRIS in immunocompetent hosts ===

The [[immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome]] (IRIS) has been described in immunocompetent hosts who have meningitis caused by ''C. gattii'' and ''C. grubii''. Several weeks or even months into appropriate treatment, there is a sudden onset deterioration with worsening meningitis symptoms and progression or development of new neurological symptoms.  IRIS is however much more common in immunocompromised hosts.

Magnetic resonance imaging shows increase in the size of brain lesions, and CSF abnormalities (white cell count, protein, glucose) increase. CSF culture is sterile, and there is no increase in CSF cryptococcal antigen titre. 

The increasing inflammation can cause brain injury or be fatal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lane M, McBride J, Archer J |title=Steroid responsive late deterioration in Cryptococcus neoformans variety gattii meningitis |journal=Neurology |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=713–4 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15326249 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15326249 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000134677.29120.62}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Einsiedel L, Gordon DL, Dyer JR |title=Paradoxical inflammatory reaction during treatment of Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii meningitis in an HIV-seronegative woman |journal=Clin.

The mechanism behind IRIS in cryptococcal meningitis is primarily immunologic. With reversal of immunosuppression, there is paradoxical increased inflammation as the recovering immune system recognises the fungus. In severe IRIS cases, treatment with systemic corticosteroids has been utilized.

==In other animals==
Cryptococcosis is also seen in cats and occasionally dogs. It is the most common deep fungal disease in cats, usually leading to chronic infection of the nose and sinuses, and skin ulcers. Cats may develop a bump over the bridge of the nose from local tissue inflammation. It can be associated with [[FeLV]] infection in cats. Cryptococcosis is most common in dogs and cats but cattle, sheep, goats, horses, wild animals and birds can also be infected. Soil, fowl manure and pigeon droppings are among the sources of infection.<ref>[http://www.cathealth.com/FungalINFXdeep.htm Deep fungal infections]</ref><ref>[http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2003&PID=6653&O=Generic Malik (2003), "Feline Cryptococcosis"]</ref>
