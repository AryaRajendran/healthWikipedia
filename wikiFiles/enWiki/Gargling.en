'''Gargling''' is the act in which one bubbles a liquid in one's mouth. It usually requires that the head be tilted back, allowing a mouthful of liquid to sit in the upper throat. The head can be tilted by extending either the neck or the back, depending on what is comfortable for the gargler. Air is then expelled from the [[lung]]s, causing the liquid to bubble and undulate throughout the throat and [[mouth]] region.

As gargling can be done repetitively with the same liquid for greater periods than a person's lung capacity allows, one temporarily tilts the head forward to be able to breathe in again easily, as the liquid travels to the front of the mouth. Breathing in can be done through the mouth for people with [[nasal congestion]]; this requires a lesser amount of liquid so that it does not spill out when the mouth is opened for inhaling.

It is a common method of cleansing the [[throat]], when gargling warm water and salt, if one has a [[sore throat]] due to upper-respiratory [[virus]], [[infection]] or other cause.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cold-remedies 12 Home Remedies for the Cold: Nasal Spray, Steam, & More<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Gargling is practiced in [[Japan]] for perceived prevention of viral infection.  A 2005 study found that gargling either with simple water or a providone/iodine solution was effective in preventing [[upper respiratory infection]] and decreasing the severity of symptoms if contracted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Satomura|first=Kazunari|coauthors=Tetsuhisa Kitamura, MS, Takashi Kawamura, MD, Takuro Shimbo, MD, Motoi Watanabe, MS, Mitsuhiro Kamei, MD, Yoshihisa Takano, MD, Akiko Tamakoshi, MD, Great Cold Investigators-I|title=Prevention of upper respiratory tract infections by gargling: a randomized trial|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|date=November 2005|year=2005|month=November|volume=29|issue=4|pages=302â€“307|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2005.06.013|accessdate=7 February 2013|issn=0749-3797|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16242593|pmid=16242593}}</ref> A later study found that the same procedure did not prevent [[influenza]]-like illnesses.<ref>http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/internalmedicine/46/18/1623/_pdf</ref> Other sources attribute the benefit to a simple placebo effect.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20091215zg.html To gargle or not to gargle?] [[Japan Times]], 15th December 2009</ref> One commonly used way is with [[tisane]]s, or [[tea]]. 

According to modern western [[etiquette]], gargling is a fairly impolite activity during a social occasion or mealtime. It is typically performed in a [[bathroom]] at a sink so the refused liquid may be disposed of properly.
