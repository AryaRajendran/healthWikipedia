'''Winterbottom's sign''' is seen in the early phase of [[African trypanosomiasis]], a [[disease]] caused by the parasites ''[[Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma brucei gambiense]]'' which is more commonly known as African sleeping sickness. Dr Anthony Martinelli describes Winterbottom's sign as the swelling of [[lymph node]]s ([[lymphadenopathy]]) along the back of the neck, in the [[posterior cervical]] chain of lymph nodes, as trypanosomes travel in the [[lymphatic system|lymphatic fluid]] and cause [[inflammation]]. 

It may be suggestive of cerebral infection.<ref name="pmid1942213">{{cite journal |author=Ormerod WE |title=Hypothesis: the significance of Winterbottom's sign |journal=J Trop Med Hyg |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=338â€“40 |year=1991 |month=October |pmid=1942213 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Eponym==
The term Winterbottom's sign derives from descriptions of the posterior cervical lymphadenopathy associated with African trypanosomiasis made by [[Thomas Masterman Winterbottom|Dr. Thomas Masterman Winterbottom]] (1766-1859) in 1803.<ref>Winterbottom TM. An account of the native Africans in the neighbourhood of Sierra Leone. London: C. Whittingham; 1803. </ref>  Contrary to some beliefs, Winterbottom was not a slave trader using the sign to weed out the ill, rather, he was an abolitionist physician who traveled to newly created colony of [[Sierra Leone]], home to freed American slaves. While working in Sierra Leone, he is credited with extensively documenting the unique tropical diseases of the region and working to improve public health.<ref>http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/acrossuk/worknat/full/Projects/winterbottom/index.html</ref><ref>Cox F.
