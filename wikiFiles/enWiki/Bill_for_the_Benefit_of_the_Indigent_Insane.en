The '''Bill for the Benefit of the Indigent Insane''' (also called the '''Land-Grant Bill For Indigent Insane Persons''', formally the bill "Making a grant of public lands to the several States for the benefit of indigent insane persons") was proposed legislation that would have established asylums for the [[indigent]] [[insane]], and also blind, deaf, and dumb, via federal land grants to the states.

[[File:Franklin Pierce - 1.jpg|thumb|The bill was vetoed by president [[Franklin Pierce]].]]
The bill was the signature initiative of activist [[Dorothea Dix]], and passed both houses of congress in 1854, but was vetoed May 3, 1854 by president [[Franklin Pierce]], the first of his [[List of United States presidential vetoes#Franklin Pierce|nine vetoes]]. Pierce argued that the federal government should not commit itself to [[social welfare]], which he believed was properly the responsibility of the states.<ref name="Tiffany 1890">Tiffany, Francis. (1890). ''The Life of Dorothea Lynde Dix''. Boston: The Riverside Press. pp. 180.</ref>

The main provision of the bill was to set aside {{convert|12225000|acre|km2|0|abbr=on}} of Federal land ({{convert|10000000|acre|km2|0|abbr=on}} for the benefit of the insane and the remainder for the "blind, deaf, and dumb", with proceeds from its sale distributed to the states to build and maintain asylums.

The initial request, on June 23, 1848, had been for five million acres (20,000&nbsp;kmÂ²), which was subsequently expanded.

== Context and legacy ==
The bill was part of the first wave of public mental health in the United States, which saw the establishment of asylums.

The bill is seen as a landmark in social welfare legislation in the United States, Pierce's veto establishing federal non-participation in social welfare for over 70 years, until the emergency legislation and [[New Deal]] of the 1930s, in the context of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{Harv|Manning|1962}}</ref> Compare instead the county institution of the [[poor farm]].

No further federal legislation on mental health occurred for over 90 years, until in 1946, the [[National Mental Health Act]] was passed, establishing federal mental health policy.
