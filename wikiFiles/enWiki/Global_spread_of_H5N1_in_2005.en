{{main|Global spread of H5N1|}}

The '''global spread of (highly pathogenic) H5N1''' in [[bird]]s is considered a significant [[Influenza pandemic|pandemic]] threat.

While prior [[H5N1]] strains have been known, they were significantly different from the current H5N1 strain on a genetic level, making the global spread of this new strain unprecedented. The current H5N1 strain is a [[Mutation|fast-mutating]], highly [[pathogen]]ic [[avian influenza]] virus (HPAI) found in multiple bird species. It is both epizootic (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area). Unless otherwise indicated, "H5N1" in this article refers to the recent highly pathogenic strain of H5N1.

In January 2005 an outbreak of avian influenza affected thirty three out of sixty four cities and provinces in [[Vietnam]], leading to the forced killing of nearly 1.2 million poultry. Up to 140 million birds are believed to have died or been killed because of the outbreak. In April 2005 an unprecedented die-off began of over 6,000 migratory birds at [[Qinghai Lake]] in central [[People's Republic of China|China]] over three months. This strain of H5N1 is the same strain as is spread west by migratory birds over at least the next ten months. In August 2005 H5N1 spread to [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Russia]]. On September 29, 2005, [[David Nabarro]], the newly appointed Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, warned the world that an outbreak of avian influenza could kill 5 to 150 million people. David Nabarro later stated that as the virus had spread to migratory birds, an outbreak could start in [[Africa]] or the [[Middle East]]. Later in 2005 H5N1 spread to [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], [[Croatia]] and [[Kuwait]].

== March ==
* [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]] have seen several isolated cases where human-to-human transmission of the virus has been suspected in care-givers of H5N1 patients, including a mother of a girl who died from H5N1 and two nurses.

== April ==
* "The Ministry of Health in Vietnam has provided WHO with official confirmation of an additional eight human cases of H5N1 avian influenza. Two of the cases were recently detected, between 2 and 8 April, in Hung Yen and Ha Tay Provinces, respectively. Both patients are alive. The other six cases are thought to have been detected prior to 2 April. WHO is seeking further details from the authorities on this six cases." <ref>{{cite journal

* There is an unprecedented die-off of over 6,000 migratory birds at [[Qinghai Lake]] in central [[People's Republic of China|China]] during April, May and June. This strain of [[H5N1]] is the same strain as is spread west by migratory birds over at least the next ten months. "The RNA sequence of the Qinghai virus reveals that three of its eight genes are almost identical to those of a virus isolated from a chicken in Shantou in 2003. The other five genes resemble those of viruses found in southern China earlier in 2005, which belong to the "Z genotype" virus circulating across east Asia." <ref>{{cite journal

* "Since January 2004, when human cases of H5N1 avian influenza were first reported in the current outbreak, 97 cases and 53 deaths have been reported in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. Vietnam, with 76 cases and 37 deaths, has been the most severely affected country, followed by Thailand, with 17 cases and 12 deaths, and Cambodia, with 4 cases and 4 deaths." <ref>{{cite journal

* "[T]esting of clinical specimens by international experts working in Vietnam provided further suggestive evidence of more widespread infection with the virus, raising the possibility of community-acquired infection" but "the detection of H5N1 in clinical specimens is technically challenging and prone to errors" so team members and supplies from "institutes in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America having extensive experience in the testing of avian influenza viruses in human clinical specimens" investigated and concluded that "no laboratory evidence suggesting that human infections are occurring with greater frequency or that the virus is spreading readily among humans." <ref>{{cite journal

Sichuan Province, where infections with ''Streptococcus suis'' have been detected in pigs in a concurrent outbreak, has one of the largest pig populations in China. The outbreak in humans has some unusual features and is being closely followed by the WHO.<ref>{{cite web

* The EU Health Commissioner [[Markos Kyprianou]] confirmed that tests on the dead [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]] found on farms in [[Kiziksa]], [[Turkey]], showed that they had died from the H5N1 strain. Even before the test results were available, some 5,000 birds and poultry have been culled in the area. It is believed that the disease had spread from migratory birds that land at the [[Manyas]] bird sanctuary (a few miles from the infected farm) on their way to Africa.

* [[People's Republic of China|China]] announced a fresh outbreak of bird flu, saying 2,600 birds have died from the disease in [[Inner Mongolia]]. The deaths, at a farm near the region's capital of Hohhot, were due to the H5N1 strain, the Xinhua news agency said.
