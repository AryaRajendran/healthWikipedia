'''Ganser syndrome''' is a rare [[dissociative disorder]] previously classified as a [[factitious disorder]]. It is characterized by [[nonsensical]] or wrong answers to questions or doing things incorrectly, other dissociative symptoms such as [[fugue state|fugue]], [[amnesia]] or [[conversion disorder]], often with visual [[pseudohallucination]]s and a decreased [[state of consciousness]]. It is also sometimes called '''nonsense syndrome''', '''balderdash syndrome''', '''syndrome of approximate answers''', '''pseudodementia''', '''hysterical pseudodementia''' or '''prison psychosis'''. This last name, prison psychosis, is sometimes used because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it may represent an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials.

Ganser is an extremely rare variation of [[dissociative disorder]]. It is a reaction to extreme stress and the patient thereby suffers from approximation or giving absurd answers to simple questions. The syndrome can sometimes be diagnosed as merely malingering, but it is more often defined as dissociative disorder.

Symptoms include a clouding of consciousness, [[conversion disorder|somatic conversion]] symptoms, confusion, stress, loss of personal identity, [[echolalia]], and [[echopraxia]]. The psychological symptoms generally resemble the patient's sense of mental illness rather than any recognized category. Individuals also give approximate answers to simple questions. For example, "How many legs are on a cat?", to which the subject may respond '3?'.

The syndrome may occur in persons with other mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[depressive disorder]]s, [[Substance intoxication|toxic]] states, [[paresis]], [[alcohol abuse|alcohol use disorders]] and [[factitious disorders]]. [[EEG]] data does not suggest any specific organic cause.<ref name="pmid3522461">{{cite journal |author=Cocores JA, Schlesinger LB, Gold MS |title=A review of the EEG literature on Ganser's syndrome |journal=International journal of psychiatry in medicine |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=59–65 |year=1986 |pmid=3522461 |doi=10.2190/NAQ6-T7PJ-KA0W-JLFG}}</ref>

==Overview==
The original description by [[Sigbert Josef Maria Ganser]] in 1898 pointed out their hysterical twilight state. They may also describe [[hallucination]]s which are usually more [[wikt:florid|florid]] than those in [[schizophrenia]]. They may also have disorders of sensation similar to those in [[conversion disorder]]. They may be inattentive or drowsy.<ref> AJ Giannini,HR Black. Psychiatric, Psychogenic and Somatopsychic Disorders Handbook. Garden City,NY. Medical Examination Puclishing Co. Pg. 136. ISBN 0-87488-596-5. </ref>

Some workers believe there is a genuine [[psychosis]] underlying this, others believe it is a [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociative disorder]], while still others believe it is the result of [[malingering]]. Over the years, opinions have seemed to move from the last view more towards the first.{{Fact|date=November 2010}}

Ganser syndrome is currently classified under dissociative disorders, to which it moved in the DSM IV from the factitious disorders.

==Diagnosis==
According to the DSM-IV-TR, which classifies Ganser syndrome as a dissociative disorder, it is "the giving of approximate answers to questions (e.g. '2 plus 2 equals 5' when not associated with dissociative amnesia or dissociative fugue)."<ref name=APA>American Psychiatric Association. ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.'' 4th ed. Text rev. Washington, DC. American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref>

Diagnosing Ganser syndrome is very challenging, not only because some measure of dishonesty is involved but also because it is very rare. 

Usually when giving wrong answers, they are only slightly off, showing that the individual understood the question. For instance, when asked how many legs a horse has they might say, "five." Also, although subjects appear confused in their answers, in other respects they appear to understand their surroundings.

== Treatment ==

Hospitalization may be necessary during the acute phase of symptoms, and psychiatric care if the patient is a danger to self or others.  A neurological consult is advised to rule out any organic cause.

== Prevalence ==

The disorder is extraordinarily rare. While individuals of all backgrounds have been reported with the disorder, there is a higher inclination towards males (75% or more). The average age of those with Ganser syndrome is 32 and it stretches from ages 15–62 years old. It has been reported in children.<ref name="pmid9000788">{{cite journal |author=Miller P, Bramble D, Buxton N |title=Case study: Ganser syndrome in children and adolescents |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=112–5 |year=1997 |pmid=9000788 |doi=10.1097/00004583-199701000-00024}}</ref>

The disorder is apparently most common in men and prisoners although prevalence data and familial patterns are not established.<ref name="pmid15800152">{{cite journal |author=Brugha T, Singleton N, Meltzer H, ''et al.'' |title=Psychosis in the community and in prisons: a report from the British National Survey of psychiatric morbidity |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=4 |pages=774–80 |year=2005 |pmid=15800152 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.4.774}}</ref>
