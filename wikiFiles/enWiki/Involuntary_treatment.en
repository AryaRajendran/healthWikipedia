{{For|treatment in hospital wards|involuntary commitment}}

'''Involuntary treatment''' (also referred to by proponents as '''assisted treatment''' and by critics as '''forced drugging''') refers to medical treatment undertaken without a person's [[consent]]. In almost all circumstances, involuntary treatment refers to [[psychiatric]] treatment administered despite an individual's objections. These are typically individuals who have been diagnosed with a mental illness and are deemed by a court to be a danger to themselves or others.

==United States==
In 1975, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'' that involuntary hospitalization and/or treatment violates an individual's [[civil rights]]. The individual must be exhibiting behavior that is a danger to themselves or others and a court order must be received for more than a short (E.g. 72 hour) detention. The treatment must take place in the least restrictive setting possible. This ruling has severely limited involuntary treatment and hospitalization in the United States. The statutes vary somewhat from state to state.

In 1979, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] established in ''[[Rogers v. Okin]]'' that a competent patient committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] has the right to refuse treatment in non-emergency situations. The case of ''[[Rennie v. Klein]]'' established that an involuntarily committed individual has a constitutional right to refuse psychotropic medication without a court order. ''[[Rogers v. Okin]]'' established the patient's right to make treatment decisions.

Additional U.S. Supreme Court decisions have added more restraints to involuntary commitment and treatment. ''[[Foucha v. Louisiana]]'' established the unconstitutionality of the continued commitment of an insanity acquittee who was not suffering from a mental illness. In ''[[Jackson v. Indiana]]'' the court ruled that a person [[adjudicative competence|adjudicated incompetent]] could not be indefinitely committed. In ''[[Perry v. Louisiana]]'' the court struck down the forcible medication of a prisoner for the purposes of rendering him competent to be executed. In ''[[Riggins v. Nevada]]'' the court ruled that a defendant had the right to refuse psychiatric medication while he was on trial, given to mitigate his psychiatric symptoms. ''[[Sell v. United States]]'' imposed stringent limits on the right of a lower court to order the forcible administration of antipsychotic medication to a criminal defendant who had been determined to be incompetent to stand trial for the sole purpose of making them competent and able to be tried. In ''[[Washington v. Harper]]'' the Supreme Court upheld the involuntary medication of [[correctional facility]] inmates only under certain conditions as determined by established policy and procedures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/legal/l1990/Harper.htm |title=Washington et al., Petitioners v. Walter Harper |accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

==Justifications and criticisms==
Justification for involuntary treatment is often attempted by emphasizing the potential for severe consequences that may result from lack of treatment, such as [[homelessness]], victimization, [[suicide]], [[violence]]. However, critics argue that psychiatric treatment can also have severe consequences such as misdiagnosis [http://www.psychologytoday.com/htdocs/prod/PTOArticle/PTO-20030624-000001.asp]{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}, psychiatric assault{{clarify|date=May 2012}} and disabling drug side effects.

Involuntary treatment is generally undertaken at the behest of family members. Supporters of involuntary treatment include mainstream organizations such as the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] (NAMI) and the [[American Psychiatric Association]]. Involuntary treatment's biggest supporter in the United States is the [[Treatment Advocacy Center]].

Civil and human rights activists, [[Anti-psychiatry]] groups, and members of the [[psychiatric survivors movement]], vigorously oppose involuntary treatment on [[human rights]] grounds.  Also, critics oppose involuntary treatment because of the significant potential for [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]], ranging from mild to severe structural [[brain damage]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Konopaske GT, Dorph-Petersen KA, Pierri JN, Wu Q, Sampson AR, Lewis DA |title=Effect of chronic exposure to antipsychotic medication on cell numbers in the parietal cortex of macaque monkeys |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1216–23 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17063154 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1301233 |url=http://psychrights.org/Research/Digest/NLPs/MonkeysonNeuroleptics.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bonelli RM |author1-link=Raphael M.

Critics, such as the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]], have denounced the strong [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[socioeconomic]] [[biases]] in forced treatment orders.<ref>[[New York Lawyers for the Public Interest]], Inc., "Implementatation of Kendra's Law is Severely Biased" (April 7, 2005) [http://nylpi.org/pub/Kendras_Law_04-07-05.pdf http://nylpi.org/pub/Kendras_Law_04-07-05.pdf] (PDF)</ref><ref>[http://www.nyclu.org/aot_program_tstmny_040805.html NYCLU Testimony On Extending Kendra's Law]</ref>

The [[Church of Scientology]] is also aggressively opposed to involuntary treatment. In the [[United States]] case law rulings have almost eliminated the legal right to involuntarily treat a patient or incarcerated inmate in non-emergency situations{{dubious|date=December 2012}}, starting in 1975 with ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'', ''[[Rennie v. Klein]]'' in 1978 and ''[[Rogers v. Okin]]'' in 1979, to name a few.

==Mental health law==
All but four states in the U.S. allow for some form of involuntary treatment for mental illness for short periods of time under emergency conditions, although criteria vary.[http://www.psychlaws.org/LegalResources/Index.htm#statutes] Since the late 1990s, a growing number of states have adopted ''Assisted Outpatient Commitment (AOC)'' laws.[http://www.psychlaws.org/GeneralResources/fact13.htm]  

Under "assisted" [[outpatient commitment]], people committed involuntarily can live outside the [[psychiatric hospital]], sometimes under strict conditions including reporting to mandatory psychiatric appointments, taking psychiatric drugs in the presence of a nursing team, and proving medication blood levels. Forty-two states presently allow for outpatient commitment.[http://www.psychlaws.org/LegalResources/statechart.htm]

==Effects of involuntary medication==
In a review of the literature on involuntary hospital admission, it was found that as many as 48% of respondents did not agree with their treatment.,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Katsakou C, Priebe S |title=Outcomes of involuntary hospital admission—a review |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=114 |issue=4 |pages=232–41 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16968360 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2006.00823.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0001-690X&date=2006&volume=114&issue=4&spage=232}}</ref> though a small majority of people retrospectively agreed that involuntary medication had been in their best interest, with little or no consideration given to those who disagreed with their treatment. Anecdotal reports from opponents of involuntary medication, indicating that involuntary treatment has widespread, devastating, and lasting effects, are downplayed by studies cited by supporters, including TAC.<ref>http://www.psychlaws.org/BriefingPapers/BP2.htm</ref>  However, other studies cast doubt on the efficacy of involuntary treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kisely S, Campbell LA, Preston N |title=Compulsory community and involuntary outpatient treatment for people with severe mental disorders |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD004408 |year=2005 |pmid=16034930 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004408.pub2 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004408.pub2}}</ref>
