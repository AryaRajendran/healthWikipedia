A '''spectrum''' as it applies to [[mental disorder]] is a range of linked conditions, sometimes also extending to include singular symptoms and [[trait theory|traits]]. The different elements of a spectrum either have a similar appearance or are thought to be caused by the same underlying mechanism. In either case, a spectrum approach is taken because there appears to be "not a unitary disorder but rather a [[syndrome]] composed of subgroups". The spectrum may represent a range of severity, comprising relatively "severe" [[mental disorders]] through to relatively "mild and nonclinical [[Cognitive deficit|deficits]]".<ref name=Maser>{{Cite journal|author=Maser JD, Akiskal HS |title=Spectrum concepts in major mental disorders |journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=xi–xiii |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12462854 |doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(02)00034-5}}</ref>

In some cases, a spectrum approach joins together conditions that were previously considered separately. A notable example of this trend is the [[autism spectrum]], where conditions on this spectrum may now all be referred to as autism spectrum disorders. In other cases, what was treated as a single disorder comes to be seen (or seen once again) as comprising a range of types, a notable example being the [[bipolar spectrum]]. A spectrum approach may also expand the type or the severity of issues which are included, which may lessen the gap with other diagnoses or with what is considered 'normal'. Proponents of this approach argue that it is in line with evidence of gradations in the type or severity of symptoms in the general population, and helps reduce the [[Social stigma|stigma]] associated with a diagnosis. Critics, however, argue that it can take attention and resources away from the most serious conditions associated with the most [[disability]], or on the other hand could unduly [[medicalize]] problems which are simply challenges people face in life.

==Origin==
[[File:Spectrum-sRGB.svg|thumb|right|The visible color spectrum]]
The term [[spectrum]] was originally used in physics to indicate an apparent [[Quality (philosophy)|qualitative]] distinction arising from a [[quantity|quantitative]] continuum (i.e. a series of distinct [[colors]] experienced when a beam of [[White#Light|white light]] is dispersed by a prism according to [[wavelength]]). Newton first used the word spectrum (Latin for "appearance" or "apparition") in print in 1671, in describing his experiments in [[optics]]. The term was first used by [[analogy]] in [[psychiatry]] with a slightly different connotation, to identify a group of conditions that is qualitatively distinct in appearance but believed to be related from an underlying pathogenic point of view.<ref name=Maser/>

It has been noted that for clinicians trained after the publication of DSM-III (1980), the spectrum concept in psychiatry may be relatively new, but that it has a long and distinguished history that dates back to [[Emil Kraepelin]] and beyond.<ref name=Maser/> A dimensional concept was proposed by [[Ernst Kretschmer]] in 1921 for schizophrenia ([[schizothymic]]&nbsp;– [[schizoid]]&nbsp;– [[schizophrenic]]) and for [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] disorders ([[cyclothymic]] temperament&nbsp;– [[cycloid]] '[[psychopathy]]'&nbsp;– [[manic-depressive disorder]]), as well as by [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1922. The term "spectrum" was first used in psychiatry in 1968 in regard to a postulated schizophrenia spectrum, at that time meaning a linking together of what were then called "[[schizoid]] personalities", in people diagnosed with schizophrenia and their genetic relatives ([[Seymour S. Kety]] et al., 1968).<ref name=bipolarspectrum>{{Cite journal|author=Angst J |title=The bipolar spectrum |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=190 |pages= 189–91 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17329735 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.030957}}</ref>

For different investigators, the hypothetical common pathogenic (disease-causing) link has been of a different nature.<ref name=Maser/>

==Related concepts==

A spectrum approach generally overlays or extends a ''categorical'' approach, which today is most associated with the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) and [[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD). In these diagnostic guides, disorders are considered present if there is a certain combination and number of symptoms. Gradations of present versus absent are not allowed, although there may subtypes of severity within a category. The categories are also [[polythetic]], because a constellation of symptoms is laid out and different patterns of them can qualify for the same diagnosis. These categories are aid to be important for practical purposes such as providing specific labels to facilitate payments for [[mental health professionals]]. They have been described as clearly worded, with observable criteria, and therefore an advance over some previous models for research purposes.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Enhancing research and treatment of mental disorders with dimensional concepts: toward DSM-V and ICD-11 | author=Robert F. Krueger and Serena Bezdjian | journal=World Psychiatry | year=2009 | month=February | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=3–6. | pmc=2652894 | pmid=19293948}}</ref>

A spectrum approach sometimes starts with the nuclear, classic DSM diagnostic criteria for a disorder (or may join together several disorders), and then include an additional broad range of issues such as temperaments or traits, lifestyle, behavioral patterns, and personality characteristics.<ref name=Maser/>

[[File:Broken Rainbow Light Trails.jpg|thumb|right|'Broken rainbow' artwork showing lines and colors]]

In addition, the term '[[spectrum]]' may be used interchangeably with ''[[continuum (theory)|continuum]]'', although the latter goes further in suggesting a direct straight line with no significant discontinuities. Under some continuum models, there are no set types or categories at all, only different dimensions along which everyone varies (hence a ''dimensional'' approach).

An example is personality subdivided into the [[Big Five personality traits]], where everyone can be assigned a score along each of the five dimensions. This is by contrast to theories of '[[personality types]]', where some have a certain type and some do not. Similarly, in the [[classification of mental disorders]], a dimensional approach, which is being considered for the DSM-V, would involve everyone having a score on personality trait measures. A categorical approach would only look for the presence or absence of certain clusters of symptoms, perhaps with some cut-off points for severity for some symptoms only, and as a result diagnose some people with [[personality disorder]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Widiger TA |title=Dimensional models of personality disorder |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=79–83 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=18235857 |pmc=2219904}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Esterberg ML, Compton MT |title=The psychosis continuum and categorical versus dimensional diagnostic approaches |journal=Current Psychiatry Reports |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=179–84 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19470278 |doi=10.1007/s11920-009-0028-7}}</ref>

A spectrum approach, by comparison, suggests that although there is a common underlying link, which could be continuous, particular sets of individuals present with particular patterns of symptoms (i.e. [[syndrome]] or subtype), reminiscent of the [[visible spectrum]] of distinct colors after refraction of light by a prism.<ref name=Maser/>

It has been argued that within the data used to develop the DSM system there is a large literature leading to the conclusion that a spectrum classification provides a better perspective on [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenology]] (appearance and experience) of [[psychopathology]] (mental difficulties) than a categorical classification system. However, the term has a varied history, meaning one thing when referring to a schizophrenia spectrum and another when referring to bipolar or obsessive–compulsive disorder spectrum, for example.<ref name=Maser/>

==Types of spectrum==
The widely-used ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]'' and ''[[International Classification of Diseases|ICD]]'' ([[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|Chapter 5]]) manuals are generally limited to categorical diagnoses. However, some categories include a range of subtypes which vary from the main diagnosis in clinical presentation or typical severity. Some categories could be considered subsyndromal (not meeting criteria for the full diagnosis) subtypes. In addition, many of the categories include a '[[Not otherwise specified#Not Otherwise Specified|Not Otherwise Specified]]' subtype, where enough symptoms are present but not in the main recognized pattern; in some categories this is the most common diagnosis.

Spectrum concepts used in research or clinical practice include the following.<ref name=Maser/>

A spectrum approach joins these together, and may additionally include specific clinical variables and outcomes, which initial research suggested may not be particularly well captured by the different diagnostic categories except at the extremes.

===Mood===

A [[mood disorder]] ([[affective]]) spectrum<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Benazzi F |title=The continuum/spectrum concept of mood disorders: is mixed depression the basic link? |journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience |volume=256 |issue=8 |pages=512–5 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=16960654 |doi=10.1007/s00406-006-0672-4}}</ref> or [[bipolar spectrum]]<ref name=bipolarspectrum/> or [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] spectrum.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Angst J, Merikangas K |title=The depressive spectrum: diagnostic classification and course |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=45 |issue=1-2 |pages=31–9; discussion 39–40 |year=1997 |month=August |pmid=9268773 |doi= 10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00057-8}}</ref> These approaches have expanded out in different directions. On the one hand, work on [[major depressive disorder]] has identified a spectrum of subcategories and subthreshold symptoms which are prevalent, recurrent and associated with treatment needs. People are found to move between the subtypes and the main diagnostic type over time, suggesting a spectrum. This spectrum can include already recognised categories of [[minor depressive disorder]], '[[melancholic depression]]' and various kinds of [[atypical depression]].

Going in another direction, numerous links and overlaps have been found between major depressive disorder and bipolar syndromes, including [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed states]] (simultaneous depression and [[mania]] or [[hypomania]]). Hypomanic ('below manic') and more rarely manic signs and symptoms have been found in a significant number of cases of major depressive disorder, suggesting not a categorical distinction but a dimension of frequency which is higher in bipolar II and higher again in bipolar I.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=45–54 |date=May 2006|pmid=16488021 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 }}</ref> In addition, numerous subtypes of bipolar have been proposed beyond the types already in the DSM (which includes a milder form called [[cyclothymia]]). These extra subgroups have been defined in terms of more detailed gradations of mood severity, or the rapidity of cycling, or the extent or nature of psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, due to shared characteristics between some types of Bipolar disorder and [[Borderline Personality Disorder]], some researchers have suggested they may both lie on a spectrum of affective disorders, although others see more links to post-trauma syndromes.<ref>Berrocal C, Ruiz Moreno MA, Rando MA, Benvenuti A, Cassano GB.

===Substance use===

A spectrum of [[recreational drug use|drug use]], [[drug abuse]] and [[substance dependence]]. One spectrum of this type, adopted by the Health Officers Council of [[British Columbia]] in 2005, does not employ loaded terms and distinctions such as "use" vs. "abuse", but explicitly recognizes a spectrum ranging from potentially beneficial to [[Substance dependence|chronic dependence]] (also known as addiction). The model includes the role not just of the individual but of society, culture and availability of substances. In concert with the identified spectrum of drug use, a spectrum of policy approaches was identified which depended partly on whether the drug in question was available in a legal, for-profit commercial economy, or at the other of the spectrum only in a criminal/prohibition, black-market economy.<ref>[http://www.cfdp.ca/bchoc.pdf A Public Health Approach to Drug Control in Canada (2005)]</ref> In addition, a standardized questionnaire has been developed in psychiatry based on a spectrum concept of substance use.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Sbrana A, Bizzarri JV, Rucci P, ''et al.'' |title=The spectrum of substance use in mood and anxiety disorders |journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages= 6–13 |year=2005 |pmid=15714188 |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2004.07.017}}</ref>

==Broad spectrum approach==
Various [[hierarchy|higher-level]] types of spectrum have also been proposed, that subsume conditions into fewer but broader overarching groups.<ref name=Maser/>

One psychological model based on [[factor analysis]], originating from developmental studies but also applied to adults, posits that many disorders fall on either an "[[internalizing]]" spectrum (characterized by [[negative affectivity]]; subdivides into a "distress" subspectrum and a "fear" subspectrum) or an "externalizing" spectrum (characterized by negativity affectivity plus disinhibition). These spectra are hypothetically linked to underlying variation in some of the [[Big five personality traits]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Krueger RF, Markon KE |title=Understanding Psychopathology: Melding Behavior Genetics, Personality, and Quantitative Psychology to Develop an Empirically Based Model |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=113–117 |year=2006 |pmid=18392116 |pmc=2288576 |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2006.00418.x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Markon KE, Krueger RF |title=Categorical and continuous models of liability to externalizing disorders: a direct comparison in NESARC |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=1352–9 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16330723 |pmc=2242348 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.12.1352}}</ref> Another theoretical model proposes that the dimensions of [[fear]] and [[anger]], defined in a broad sense, underlie a broad spectrum of mood, behavioral and personality disorders. In this model, different combinations of excessive or deficient fear and anger correspond to different neuropsychological [[temperament]] types hypothesized to underlie the spectrum of disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lara DR, Pinto O, Akiskal K, Akiskal HS |title=Toward an integrative model of the spectrum of mood, behavioral and personality disorders based on fear and anger traits: I.

Similar approaches refer to the overall 'architecture' or 'meta-structure', particularly in relation to the development of the DSM or ICD systems. Five proposed meta-structure groupings were recently proposed in this way, based on views and evidence relating to risk factors and clinical presention. The clusters of disorder that emerged were described as neurocognitive (identified mainly by neural substrate abnormalities), neurodevelopmental (identified mainly by early and continuing cognitive deficits), psychosis (identified mainly by clinical features and biomarkers for information processing deficits), emotional (identified mainly by being preceded by a temperament of negative emotionality), and externalizing (identified mainly be being preceded by disinhibition).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?iid=6586004 | title=Thematic section: A proposal for a meta-structure for DSM-V and ICD-11)&nbsp;– 2009 | work=Psychological Medicine Volume 39&nbsp;– Issue 12 | year=2009 | accessdate=January 3, 2012 | author=Various}}</ref> However, the analysis was not necessarily able to validate one arrangement over others. From a psychological point of view, it has been suggested that the underlying phenomena are too complex, inter-related and continuous&nbsp;– with too poorly understood a biological or environmental basis&nbsp;– to expect that everything can be mapped into a set of categories for all purposes. In this context the overall system of classification is to some extent arbitrary, and could be thought of as a user inferface which may need to satisfy different purposes.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/pro-41-6-457.pdf | title=Toward ICD-11: Improving the Clinical Utility of WHO’s International Classification of Mental Disorders | author=Reed, G.M. | journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | year=2010 | volume=41 | issue=5 | pages=462 | doi = 10.1037/a0021701 }}</ref>
