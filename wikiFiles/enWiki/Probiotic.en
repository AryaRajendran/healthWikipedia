'''Probiotics''' are live [[microorganisms]] that may confer a health benefit on the host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schlundt|first=Jorgen|title=Health and Nutritional Properties of Probiotics in Food including Powder Milk with Live Lactic Acid Bacteria|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/fs_management/en/probiotics.pdf|work=Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Evaluation of Health and Nutritional Properties of Probiotics in Food Including Powder Milk with Live Lactic Acid Bacteria|publisher=FAO / WHO|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> In the past, there were other definitions of probiotics. The first use of the word “Probiotic” as microorganisms that have effects on other microorganism was accredited to  Lilly and Stilwell (1965),<ref>{ Lilly, D. M., & Stilwell .H. (1965).

Again, the term was used in 1971 by Sperti <ref>{Sperti, G. (1971). Probiotics. AVI Publishing Co. Inc., West Point, Connecticut}</ref> to describe tissue extracts which stimulated microbial growth. The word was later described by Parker in 1974 <ref>{Parker, R. (1974). Probiotics, the other half of the antibiotic story, 29, 4–8 }</ref> who advanced the meaning of the term by adding the word  organisms to the definition, thereby describing probiotics as “Organisms and substances that have a beneficial effect on the host animal by contributing to its intestinal microbial balance”. Later, the definition was greatly improved by Fuller in 1989,<ref>{Fuller, R. (1989). Probiotics in man and animals. The Journal of applied bacteriology, 66(5), 365–378}</ref> whose explanation was very close to the definition used today. Fuller in 1989 described probiotics as "live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance".  He stressed two important facts of probiotics:  the viable nature of probiotics and the capacity to help with intestinal balance.

[[Lactic acid bacteria]] (LAB) and [[bifidobacteria]] are the most common types of [[microbes]] used as probiotics, but certain [[yeasts]] and [[bacilli]] may also be used. Probiotics are commonly consumed as part of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] foods with specially added active live cultures, such as in [[yogurt]], [[soy yogurt]], or as [[dietary supplement]]s. Probiotics are also delivered in [[Fecal bacteriotherapy|fecal transplants]], in which stool from a healthy donor is delivered like a suppository to an infected patient.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/science/studies-of-human-microbiome-yield-new-insights.html Tending the Body’s Microbial Garden] By CARL ZIMMER, New York Times, June 18, 2012</ref>

When a person takes [[antibiotics]], both the harmful bacteria and the beneficial bacteria are killed. A reduction of beneficial bacteria can lead to digestive problems, such as diarrhea, yeast infections and urinary tract infections. The possibility that supplemental probiotics affect such digestive issues is unknown, and remains under study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/tc/probiotics-topic-overview |title=Probiotics & Probiotic Supplements - WebMD: Uses and Safety |publisher=WebMD |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

==History==
The original observation of the positive role played by certain bacteria was first introduced by Russian scientist and [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Élie Metchnikoff]], who in the beginning of the 20th century suggested that it would be possible to modify the [[gut flora]] and to replace harmful microbes with useful microbes.<ref name="Metchnikoff"/> Metchnikoff, at that time a professor at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]], proposed the hypothesis that the [[aging]] process results from the activity of [[Putrefaction|putrefactive]] ([[proteolytic]]) [[microbe]]s producing toxic substances in the [[large bowel]]. Proteolytic bacteria such as [[clostridia]], which are part of the normal gut flora, produce toxic substances including [[phenols]], [[Indole|indols]] and [[ammonia]] from the [[digestion]] of [[proteins]]. According to Metchnikoff these compounds were responsible for what he called "intestinal [[Autointoxication|auto-intoxication]]", which caused the physical changes associated with old age.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

It was at that time known that [[Fermented milk|milk fermented]] with lactic-acid bacteria inhibits the growth of proteolytic bacteria because of the low [[pH]] produced by the fermentation of [[lactose]]. Metchnikoff had also observed that certain rural populations in Europe, for example in [[Bulgaria]] and the Russian steppes who lived largely on milk fermented by lactic-acid bacteria were exceptionally long lived. Based on these facts, Metchnikoff proposed that consumption of fermented milk would "seed" the [[intestine]] with harmless lactic-acid bacteria and decrease the intestinal [[pH]] and that this would suppress the growth of proteolytic bacteria. Metchnikoff himself introduced in his diet [[sour milk]] fermented with the bacteria he called "Bulgarian Bacillus" and found his health benefited. Friends in Paris soon followed his example and physicians began prescribing the sour milk diet for their patients.<ref name="Vaughan">{{cite journal |author=Vaughan RB |title=The romantic rationalist: A study of Elie Metchnikoff |journal=Medical History |volume=9 |issue= 3|pages=201–15 |year=1965 |month=July |pmid=14321564 |pmc=1033501 |doi=10.1017/S0025727300030702}}</ref>

''[[Bifidobacteria]]'' were first isolated from a breast-fed infant by Henry Tissier who also worked at the Pasteur Institute. The isolated bacterium named Bacillus bifidus communis<ref name="Tissier">Tissier, H. 1900. Recherchers sur la flora intestinale normale et pathologique du nourisson. Thesis, University of Paris, Paris, France.</ref> was later renamed to the genus ''Bifidobacterium''. Tissier found that bifidobacteria are dominant in the [[gut flora]] of [[Breastfeeding|breast-fed]] babies and he observed clinical benefits from treating diarrhea in infants with bifidobacteria. The claimed effect was bifidobacterial displacement of proteolytic bacteria causing the disease.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

During an outbreak of [[shigellosis]] in 1917, German professor Alfred Nissle isolated a strain of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' from the feces of a soldier who was not affected by the disease.<ref name="Nissle1918">{{cite journal |author=Die antagonistische Behandlung chronischer Darmstörungen mit Colibakterien |journal=Med Klin |volume=2 |pages=29–30 |year=1918}}</ref> Methods of treating infectious diseases were needed at that time when [[antibiotics]] were not yet available, and Nissle used the ''Escherichia coli'' Nissle 1917 strain in acute gastrointestinal infectious [[salmonellosis]] and [[shigellosis]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1920, Rettger demonstrated that Metchnikoff's "Bulgarian Bacillus", later called ''[[Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus]]'', could not live in the human intestine,<ref name="Cheplin">{{cite journal |author=Cheplin HA, Rettger LF |title=Studies on the Transformation of the Intestinal Flora, with Special Reference to the Implantation of Bacillus Acidophilus: II.

Metchnikoff's theory was disputable (at this stage), and people doubted his theory of longevity.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

After Metchnikoff's death in 1916, the centre of activity moved to the United States. It was reasoned that bacteria originating from the gut were more likely to produce the desired effect in the gut, and in 1935 certain strains of ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'' were found to be very active when implanted in the human digestive tract.<ref name="Rettger">Rettger, L.F., W.N.

The term "probiotics" was first introduced in 1953 by [[Werner Kollath]] (see Hamilton-Miller et al. 2003).  Contrasting antibiotics, probiotics were defined as microbially derived factors that stimulate the growth of other microorganisms. In 1989, Roy Fuller suggested a definition of probiotics that has been widely used: "''A live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance''".<ref name="Fuller">{{cite journal |author=Fuller R |title=Probiotics in man and animals |journal=The Journal of Applied Bacteriology |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=365–78 |year=1989 |month=May |pmid=2666378 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.1989.tb05105.x}}{{Primary source-inline|date=December 2011}}</ref> Fuller's definition emphasizes the requirement of viability for probiotics and introduces the aspect of a beneficial effect on the host.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the following decades, intestinal lactic acid bacterial species with alleged health beneficial properties have been introduced as probiotics, including ''[[Lactobacillus rhamnosus]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus casei]]'', and ''[[Lactobacillus johnsonii]]''.<ref name="Tannock">{{cite journal |author=Tannock GW |title=Probiotics: time for a dose of realism |journal=Current Issues in Intestinal Microbiology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=33–42 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14503687}}</ref>

==Preliminary research and potential effects==
Experiments into the potential health effects of supplemental probiotics include the molecular biology and genomics of ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' in immune function, cancer, and antibiotic-associated [[diarrhea]], travellers' diarrhea, pediatric diarrhea, [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].<ref name= LjunghWadstrom>{{cite book |editor=Ljungh A, Wadstrom T |year=2009 |title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-41-7 |isbn-status= May be invalid - please double check}}{{page needed|date=December 2011}}</ref> Testing of a probiotic usually applies to a specific strain under study.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilliland SE, Walker DK |title=Factors to consider when selecting a culture of Lactobacillus acidophilus as a dietary adjunct to produce a hypocholesterolemic effect in humans |journal=Journal of Dairy Science |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=905–11 |year=1990 |month=April |pmid=2111831 |doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(90)78747-4}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2011}}</ref>

In the overview below, only preliminary evidence exists for the health claims stated. Few of the strains have been sufficiently developed in basic and clinical research to warrant application for health claim status to a regulatory agency such as the Food and Drug Administration or European Food Safety Authority, but so far no single health effect has been proven to warrant a health claim<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nutraingredients.com/Regulation/EFSA-slams-door-on-probiotic-health-claims-again-Prunes-pass?utm_source=copyright&utm_medium=OnSite&utm_campaign=copyright |title=EFSA slams door on probiotic health claims (again); Prunes pass |publisher=Nutraingredients.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>

;Antibiotic-associated diarrhea 
[[Antibiotic-associated diarrhea]] (AAD) results from an imbalance in the [[gut flora|colonic microbiota]] caused by [[antibiotic]] therapy. Microbiota alteration changes [[carbohydrate metabolism]] with decreased [[short-chain fatty acid]] absorption and an osmotic diarrhea as a result. Another consequence of antibiotic therapy leading to diarrhea is overgrowth of potentially [[pathogenic]] organisms such as ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17595306 |title=Probiotics for Clostridium difficile-associ...

A further meta-analysis indicated that probiotics may inhibit ''C. difficile'' associated diarrhea (CDAD) without increasing the incidence of clinically significant side effects.<ref>Johnston BC, Ma SSY, Goldenberg JZ, Thorlund K, Vandvik PO, Loeb M, and Guyatt GH (2012).  “Probiotics for the Prevention of Clostridium difficile–Associated Diarrhea: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,” Ann Intern Med. 157: 878-888.</ref>  The calculated, weighted relative risk reduction was 0.34 (-34%), representing 20 randomized controlled trials (RTC) and 3818 patients, showing a significant reduction in the risk for contracting CDAD with the use of probiotics.  Although not sufficient as [[scientific proof]], this meta-analysis found 18 out of 20 RTC’s demonstrated results that favor the use of probiotics.  Of the two that did not concur, the authors found that study designs had risk for bias.  One of these two studies used probiotic doses three time higher than most recommended doses.  The other study found only one incidence of CDAD in both the control and treatment groups, and thus did not have a significant population to evaluate.  While 3 of the 18 remaining studies also had increased risk of bias, 15 were of moderate to robust quality. overallproviding moderate evidence for use of probiotics in lowering risk of ''C. difficile'' associated diarrhea.

===Colon cancer===
In laboratory investigations, some strains of LAB (''[[Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus]]'') have demonstrated anti-mutagenic effects thought to be due to their ability to bind with [[heterocyclic amine]]s, which are [[carcinogenic]] substances formed in cooked meat.<ref name="Wollowski">{{cite journal |author=Wollowski I, Rechkemmer G, Pool-Zobel BL |title=Protective role of probiotics and prebiotics in colon cancer |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=73 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=451S–455S |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11157356 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11157356}}</ref> Animal studies have demonstrated that some LAB have evidence for acting against colon cancer in rodents, though human data are inconclusive.<ref name="Brady">{{cite journal |author=Brady LJ, Gallaher DD, Busta FF |title=The role of probiotic cultures in the prevention of colon cancer |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=130 |issue=2S Suppl |pages=410S–414S |year=2000 |month=February |pmid=10721916 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10721916}}</ref> Some human trials hypothesize that the strains tested may exert anti-[[carcinogenic]] effects by decreasing the activity of an enzyme called [[β-glucuronidase]]<ref name="Brady"/> (which can generate carcinogens in the digestive system). Lower rates of colon cancer among higher consumers of fermented dairy products have been observed in one population study, but confirmation of such an effect does not exist.<ref name="Sanders"/>

===Cholesterol===
Animal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of some strains of LAB at being able to lower serum [[cholesterol]] levels, presumably by breaking down [[bile]] in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], thus inhibiting its reabsorption (which enters the blood as cholesterol).<ref name="Sanders"/>

A meta-analysis that included five double blind trials examining the short term (2-8weeks) effects of a yogurt with probiotic strains on serum cholesterol levels found a minor change of 8.5&nbsp;mg/dL (0.22&nbsp;mmol/L) (~4% decrease) in total cholesterol concentration, and a decrease of 7.7&nbsp;mg/dL (0.2&nbsp;mmol/L) (~5% decrease) in serum LDL concentration.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Agerholm-Larsen|first=L|coauthors=Bell ML, Grunwald GK, Astrup A.|title=The effect of a probiotic milk product on plasma cholesterol: a meta-analysis of short term intervention studies|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2002|volume=54|pages=856–860|pmid=11114681|issue=11|doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601104}}</ref>

A slightly longer study evaluating the effect of a yogurt with probiotic strains on twenty-nine subjects over six months found no statistically significant differences in total serum cholesterol or LDL values.  However, the study did note a significant increase in serum HDL from, 50&nbsp;mg/dL (1.28&nbsp;mmol/L) to 62&nbsp;mg/dL (1.6&nbsp;mmol/L) following treatment.  This corresponds to a possible improvement of LDL/HDL ratio.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kiessling|first=G|coauthors=Schneider J, Jahreis G|title=Long term consumption of fermented dairy products over 6 months increases HDL cholesterol|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2002|volume=56|pages=843–849|doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601399|pmid=12209372|issue=9}}</ref>

Studies specifically on hyper-lipidemic subjects are still needed.

===Blood pressure===
Although not a confirmed effect, some studies have indicated that consumption of milk fermented with various strains of LAB may result in modest reductions in [[blood pressure]], an effect possibly related to the [[ACE inhibitor]]-like [[peptides]] produced during fermentation.<ref name="Sanders"/>

===Immune function and infections===

== Factors affecting viability in foods ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}

Some factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, may influence the survival of probiotics in food, and so have to be considered in all stages of probiotic food manufacturing.

* physiological state of the added probiotic in the food
* physicochemical conditions of food processing
* physical conditions of product storage, like temperature
* chemical composition of the product, such as content of nutrients, oxygen or pH
* interactions with other product components, that can be inhibitory or protective

=== Physiological state ===
The physiological state of bacteria when prepared and remaining in a product itself are important factors for survival of the probiotics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Dryness in a food product keeps the bacteria in a relatively quiescent state during storage, while a wet product  establishes potentially active metabolism. Temperature affects shelf life of the bacteria, with low temperature providing conditions for possible long term survival.

Bacteria can respond to stressful environments by the induction of various stress tolerance mechanisms. One of them is the induction of stress proteins by exposure of the cells to sublethal stresses so they can condition probiotics to better tolerate environmental stresses in food production, storage, and gastrointestinal transit.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Different probiotic strains have their own intrinsic tolerances to environmental conditions,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} including how the culture is prepared, and some cross-protection can be observed, providing protection against other stresses by the exposure to only one stress.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Stress responses can be explored to make probiotic strains more resilient and likely to survive in food matrices, with significant industrial importance.

=== Temperature ===

The temperature at which probiotic organisms grow is an important factor in food applications where fermentation is required, is also a critical factor influencing probiotic survival during manufacture and storage. As it is told above, the lower the temperature the more stable probiotic viability in the food product will be. During processing, temperatures over 45–50°C (113-131°F) will be detrimental to probiotic survival, this means that the higher the temperature, the shorter the time period of exposure required to severely decrease the numbers of viable bacteria, ranging from hours or minutes at 45–55°C (113-131°F) to seconds at higher temperatures. Therefore it is obvious that probiotics should be added downstream of heating/cooking/pasteurization processes in food manufacture to avoid the high temperatures. Elevated temperature also has a detrimental effect on stability during the product process of shipping and storage. Again, the cooler a product can be maintained, the better probiotic survival will be, like in vegetative probiotic cells in liquid products, where refrigerated storage is usually essential. If the product is dried, the bacteria will be in a quiescent state, so acceptable probiotic viability can be maintained in dry products stored at ambient temperatures for 12 months or more. Producing and maintaining low water activities in the foods is the key to maintaining probiotic viability during nonrefrigerated storage because there is a remarkable interaction between temperature and water activity.

=== pH ===

Some bacteria like Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria can tolerate lower pH levels because they produce organic acid and products from carbohydrate metabolism. Indeed, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that in gastric transit where the cells are exposed to low pH values and with a time of exposure relatively short, some probiotic organisms can survive. In fermented milks and yogurts with pH values between 3.7 and 4.3. lactobacilli are able to grow and survive, while Bifidobacteria tend to be less acid tolerant, with most species surviving poorly in fermented products at pH levels below 4.6. B. animales subsp. lactis is most commonly used in acidic foods because is more acid tolerant than human intestinal species, and B. thermoacidophilum, is even more tolerant to low pH (and heat), but has not yet been characterized thoroughly for probiotic traits and is not used commercially.

Regarding to fruit juices (pH 3.5–4.5) commercially successful products have been produced, such as Gefilus (Valio Ltd, Finland), which contains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The viability at low pH can be improved with carriers such as dietary fibers. Survival of lactobacilli in low pHs has also been enhanced in the presence of metabolizable sugars, that allow cell membrane proton pumps to operate and prevent lowering of intracellular pH. This can improve survival during gastric transit, but may not be applicable to improving probiotic survival over the time stages of shelf-storage.

=== Water activity ===

For quiescent probiotic bacteria, water activity is a crucial determinant of survival in food products during storage. The higher moisture levels and water activity, the lower survival of probiotics. There is a substantial interaction between water activity and temperature with respect to their impact on the survival of quiescent probiotics. As the storage temperature is increased, the detrimental impact of moisture is magnified. Here, the osmotic stresses appear to play a role, with the presence of smaller molecules resulting in poorer bacterial survival, although the exact cell death mechanisms have not been elucidated yet.

There may be technological limitations to reducing water activity to low levels for improving survival. These include the energy costs of drying, adverse impacts on the taste of foods and difficulties in wetting and dispersing powders. Moisture barrier packaging may be applied to prevent the development of moisture from the environment during storage. Maintaining probiotic viability in moderate water activity foods (0.4–0.7) is a great challenge and solutions such as microencapsulation or incorporation of probiotics into fat phases of products can provide improved survival.

=== Oxygen ===

Both bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are considered strict anaerobes and oxygen can be detrimental to its growth and survival. However, the degree of oxygen sensitivity varies considerably between different species and strains, for example, lactobacilli, which are mostly microaerophilic, are more tolerant of oxygen than bifidobacteria, to the point where oxygen levels are not an important consideration in maintaining the survival of lactobacilli. Most probiotic bifidobacteria do not grow well in the presence of oxygen, although, many bifidobacteria have enzymatic mechanisms to limit the oxygen toxicity.

For oxygen sensitive strains, some strategies can be used to prevent oxygen toxicity in food products. Antioxidant ingredients have been shown to improve probiotic survival, as well as the use of oxygen barrier or modified-atmosphere packaging. Therefor, it is advisable to minimize processes that are highly aerating, particularly when using bifidobacteria.

=== Toxicity of ingredients ===

Interactions between probiotics and other ingredients could happen and those interactions can be protective, neutral, or detrimental to probiotic stability. Obviously, the inclusion of antimicrobial preservatives can inhibit probiotic survival and elevated levels of ingredients such as salt, organic acids, and nitrates can inhibit probiotics during storage, while starter cultures can sometimes inhibit the growth of probiotics during fermentation through the production of specific bacteriocins.

=== Growth factors, protective, and synergistic ingredients ===

Probiotic lactobacilli and, in particular, bifidobacteria are only weakly proteolytic and grow relatively slowly or poorly in milk. The growth of bifidobacteria can be improved by the presence of suitable companion cultures, which can aid in protein hydrolysis and through the production of growth factors. Some growth substrates such as carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and growth factors or antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins can be added to improve growth. Finally, the food matrix itself can be protective like in the cheese, where the anaerobic environment, high fat content and buffering capacity of the matrix helps to protect the probiotic cells both in the product and during intestinal transit.

=== Freeze–thawing ===

The damages made to cell membranes by freezing probiotics is detrimental to survival, and also can make the cells more vulnerable to environmental stresses. To prevent or at least mitigate cell injury, protectants are usually added to cultures to be frozen or dried. Once frozen, probiotics can survive well over long shelf lives in products such as frozen yogurts and ice-cream. Using alternative methods of freezing, such as slow-cooling rates or pre-freezing stress, can significantly improve cell survival. Repeated freeze–thawing cycles are highly detrimental to cell survival and should be avoided.

=== Shear forces ===

Probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are Gram-positive bacteria with thick cell walls that are able to tolerate the shear forces generated in most standard food production processes such as high-speed blending or homogenization, that may result in cell disruption and losses in viability.<ref>"Incorporating Probiotics into Food". pg. 60-67.

Some experts are skeptical on the efficacy of many strains and believe not all subjects will benefit from the use of probiotics.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bee|first=Peta|title=Probiotics, not so friendly after all?|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article1788597.ece|accessdate=18 June 2010|newspaper=The Times|date=November 10, 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

==Strains==
Live probiotic [[Microbiological culture|cultures]] are available in fermented dairy products and probiotic fortified foods. However, tablets, capsules, powders and sachets containing the bacteria in [[freeze dried]] form are also available.

In the table below, only preliminary evidence exists for the health claims stated. Few of the strains presented have been sufficiently developed in basic and clinical research to warrant application for health claim status to a regulatory agency such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]] or [[European Food Safety Authority]], but so far no claims have been approved.

==EFSA scientific review of probiotics==
The [[European Food Safety Authority]] has so far rejected 260 claims<ref>[http://www.nutraingredients.com/Regulation/EFSA-calls-for-characterisation-work-as-probiotic-resubmissions-loom EFSA calls for characterisation work as probiotic resubmissions loom<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> on probiotics in Europe due to insufficient research and thus inconclusive proof. This includes:
* ''Lactobacillus paracasei'' LMG P 22043 does not decrease potentially pathogenic gastro-intestinal microorganisms or reduce gastro-intestinal discomfort.
* ''Lactobacillus johnsonii'' BFE 6128 . Immunity and skin claims all too general for consideration.
* ''Lactobacillus fermentum'' ME-3 not shown to decrease potentially pathogenic gastro-intestinal microorganisms.
* ''Lactobacillus plantarum'' BFE 1685. Immunity claim deemed too general.
* ''Bifidobacterium longum'' BB536 does not improve bowel regularity; does not resist cedar pollen allergens; does not decrease pathogens.
* ''Bifidobacterium animalis'' ssp. ''lactis'' Bb-12 does not help maintain normal LDL-blood cholesterol; does not decrease pathogens or boost immunity.
* ''Lactobacillus plantarum'' 299v does not reduce flatulence and bloating or protect DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage.
* ''Lactobacillus rhamnosus'' LB21 NCIMB 40564 does not help maintain individual intestinal microbiota in subjects receiving antibiotic treatment.<ref name=esra>{{Wayback |title=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/ndaclaims/ndaclaims13.htm |date=20100819224624 |title="General function" health claims under Article 13}}</ref>

== Multi-probiotic ==
Preliminary research is evaluating the potential [[physiology|physiological]] effects of multiple probiotic strains, as opposed to a single strain.<ref name="pmid15454313">{{cite journal |author=Timmerman HM, Koning CJ, Mulder L, Rombouts FM, Beynen AC |title=Monostrain, multistrain and multispecies probiotics—A comparison of functionality and efficacy |journal=Int.
