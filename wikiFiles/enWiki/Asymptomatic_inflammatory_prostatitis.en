'''Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis''' is a symptomless condition of the [[prostate]] gland.<ref name="urlProstatitis: Benign Prostate Disease: Merck Manual Professional">{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec17/ch240/ch240c.html |title=Prostatitis: Benign Prostate Disease: Merck Manual Professional |work= |accessdate=2010-04-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100428071924/http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec17/ch240/ch240c.html| archivedate= 28 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It should be distinguished from other forms of prostatitis such as [[chronic bacterial prostatitis]], [[Acute prostatitis|acute bacterial prostatitis]] and [[chronic pelvic pain syndrome]] (CPPS).

==Signs and symptoms==
These patients have no history of genitourinary pain complaints, but [[leukocytosis]] is noted, usually during evaluation for other conditions.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is through tests of semen, expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or prostate tissue that reveal inflammation in the absence of symptoms.<ref name="pmid16280832">{{cite journal |author=Clemens JQ, Meenan RT, O'Keeffe Rosetti MC, Gao SY, Calhoun EA |title=Incidence and clinical characteristics of National Institutes of Health type III prostatitis in the community |journal=J. Urol. |volume=174 |issue=6 |pages=2319–22 |year=2005 |pmid=16280832 |doi=10.1097/01.ju.0000182152.28519.e7}}</ref>

==Treatment==
No treatment required. It is standard practice for men with infertility and category IV prostatitis to be given a trial of antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatories however evidence for efficacy are weak.<ref name="pmid10582781">{{cite journal |author=Weidner W, Krause W, Ludwig M |title=Relevance of male accessory gland infection for subsequent fertility with special focus on prostatitis |journal=Hum. Reprod.

The results of these tests were significantly different in prostate cancer and category IV prostatitis in one study.<ref name="pmid15548444">{{cite journal |author=Stancik I, Lüftenegger W, Klimpfinger M, Müller MM, Hoeltl W |title=Effect of NIH-IV prostatitis on free and free-to-total PSA |journal=Eur.
