'''Diabetic foot ulcer''' is a major [[complication of diabetes mellitus]], and probably the major component of the [[diabetic foot]]. It occurs in 15% of all patients with diabetes and precedes 84% of all lower leg [[amputations]].<ref name="Harold">{{Cite DOI|10.1172/JCI32169|noedit}}</ref> Major increase in mortality among diabetic patients, observed over the past 20 years is considered to be due to the development of macro and micro vascular complications, including failure of the [[wound healing]] process. Wound healing is a ‘make-up’ phenomenon for the portion of tissue that gets destroyed in any open or closed injury to the skin. Being a natural phenomenon, wound healing is usually taken care of by the body’s innate mechanism of action that works reliably most of the time. Key feature of wound healing is stepwise repair of lost [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) that forms largest component of dermal skin layer.<ref name="Iakovos">Iakovos N Nomikos et al, Protective and Damaging Aspects of Healing: A Review, ''Wounds'' 2006; 18 (7)  177-185.[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/541978]</ref> Therefore controlled and accurate rebuilding becomes essential to avoid under or over healing that may lead to various abnormalities.  But in some cases, certain disorders or physiological insult disturbs wound healing process that otherwise goes very smoothly in an orderly manner. [[Diabetes mellitus]] is one such metabolic disorder that impedes normal steps of wound healing process. Many histopathological studies show prolonged inflammatory phase in diabetic wounds, which causes delay in the formation of mature [[granulation tissue]] and a parallel reduction in [[wound]] [[tensile strength]].<ref name="McLennan">McLennan S et al, Molecular aspects of wound healing, Primary intention(2006).14(1) 8-13 [http://www.awma.com.au/journal/library/1401_01.pdf]</ref>

Non-healing chronic diabetic ulcers are often treated with [[extracellular matrix]] replacement therapy. So far, it is a common trend in diabetic foot care domain to use advanced moist wound therapy, bio-engineered tissue or skin substitute, [[growth factors]] and [[negative pressure wound therapy]].<ref name="Blume">{{Cite pmid|18162494|noedit}}</ref> No therapy is completely perfect as each type suffers from its own disadvantages.
Moist wound therapy is known to promote [[fibroblast]] and [[keratinocyte]] proliferation and migration, collagen synthesis, early [[angiogenesis]] and wound contraction. At present, there are various categories of moist dressings available such as [[adhesive]] backing film, [[silicone]] coated foam, hydrogels, hydrocolloids etc. Unfortunately, all moist dressings cause fluid retention; most of them require secondary dressing and hence are not the best choice for exudative wounds.<ref name="Sharman">{{cite journal | author = Sharman Debbie | year = 2003 | title = Moist wound healing: a review of evidence, application and outcome | url = | journal = The Diabetic Foot | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 112–120 }}</ref> To address the physiological deficiencies underlying diabetic ulcer, various [[tissue engineering]] technologies have come up with cellular as well as acellular skin replacement products. New therapies in development are also promising, such as platelet rich fibrin wound patch therapy, which is often simpler and proving effective in chronic diabetic foot ulcers. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Jørgensen|first=Bo|coauthors=Tonny Karlsmark, Hanne Vogensen, Lone Haase and Rasmus Lundquist|title=A Pilot Study of Leucopatch, an Autologous, Additive-Free, Platelet-Rich Fibrin for the Treatment of Recalcitrant Chronic Wounds to Determine Safety|journal=The International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds|date=18|year=2011|month=October}}</ref> 

==Prevention==
Steps to prevent diabetic foot ulcers include frequent [[chiropody]] review, good foot hygiene, [[diabetic sock]]s<ref>http://managingdiabetes.co.uk/articles/diabeticsocks.php</ref><ref>http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetic-socks.html</ref> and [[diabetic shoe|shoe]]s, as well as avoiding injury.

== Risk factors ==
Risk factors implicated in the development of diabetic foot ulcers are [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[peripheral vascular disease]], cigarette smoking, poor glycemic control, previous foot ulcerations or amputations, diabetic nephropathy, and [[ischemia]] of small and large blood vessels.<ref name="Examination">{{Cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=G|title=The diabetic foot examination: A positive step in the prevention of diabetic foot ulcers and amputation|journal= Osteopathic Family Physician  |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=73-78 |year=2013 |month=March-April|pmid= |doi =10.1016/j.osfp.2012.08.002}}</ref><ref name="Wu">{{Cite pmid|17583176|noedit}}</ref> Diabetic patients often suffer from diabetic neuropathy due to several metabolic and neurovascular factors. [[Peripheral neuropathy]] causes loss of pain or feeling in the toes, feet, legs and arms due to distal nerve damage and low blood flow. [[Blister]]s and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|sores]] appear on numb areas of the feet and legs such as metatarso-phalangeal joints, heel region and as a result pressure or injury goes unnoticed and eventually become portal of entry for [[bacteria]] and [[infection]].

== Pathophysiology ==
=== Extracellular matrix ===
[[Extra cellular matrix]] (or "ECM") is the external structural framework that cells attach to in multicellular organisms. The [[dermis]] lies below the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], and these two layers are collectively known as the [[skin]]. Dermal skin is primarily a combination of fibroblasts growing in this matrix. The specific species of ECM of [[connective tissue]]s often differ chemically, but collagen generally forms the bulk of the structure. 

Through the interaction of cell with its [[extracellular matrix]] (transmitted through the anchoring molecules classed as [[integrins]]) there forms a continuous association between cell interior, [[cell membrane]] and extracellular matrix components that help drive various cellular events in a regulated fashion.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hay Elizabeth | title = Cell biology of extracellular matrix second edition | publisher = Plenum press | year = 1991 | pages = 1–5 | location = New York | isbn = 0-306-40785-X }}</ref> [[Wound healing]] is a localized event involving the reaction of cells to the damage sustained. 

The cells break down damaged [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] and replace it, generally increasing in number to react to the harm. The process is activated, though perhaps not exclusively, by cells responding to fragments of damaged ECM, and the repairs are made by reassembling the matrix by cells growing on and through it. Because of this [[extracellular matrix]] is often considered as a 'conductor of the wound healing symphony'.<ref name="Sweitzer">{{Cite pmid|16554422|noedit}}</ref> In the Inflammatory phase, [[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]] recruit and activate [[fibroblasts]] which in subsequent granulation phase migrate into the wound, laying down new [[collagen]] of the subtypes I and III. 

In the initial events of wound healing, [[collagen III]] predominates in the granulation tissue which later on in remodeling phase gets replaced by collagen I giving additional [[tensile strength]] to the healing tissue.<ref name="Schultz">Schultz GS, Ludwig G, Wysocki A.

Fibronectin is the major glycoprotein secreted by fibroblasts during initial synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. It serves important functions, being a chemo-attractant for macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. 

Basement membrane that separates epidermis from the dermal layer and endothelial basement membrane mainly contain collagen IV that forms a sheet and binds to other extra cellular matrix molecules like laminin and proteoglycans. In addition to collagen IV, epidermal and endothelial basement membrane also contain laminin, perlecan and nidogen.<ref name="Sussman"/><ref name="Thomas"/> Hyaluronic acid, a pure [[glycosaminoglycan]] component is found in high amounts in damaged or growing tissues. It stimulates [[cytokine]] production by [[macrophages]] and thus promotes [[angiogenesis]]. In normal skin [[chondroitin sulfate]] [[proteoglycan]] is mainly found in the [[basement membrane]] but in healing wounds they are up regulated throughout the [[granulation tissue]] especially during second week of wound repair, when they provide a temporary matrix with highly hydrative capacity.<ref name="Miriam">{{cite pmid|9804349|noedit}}</ref> Binding of [[growth factors]] is clearly an important role of [[perlecan]] in [[wound healing]] and [[angiogenesis]]. Poor wound healing in diabetes mellitus may be related to [[perlecan]] expression.

===Altered metabolism===
[[Diabetes mellitus]] is a metabolic disorder and hence the defects observed in diabetic wound healing are thought to be the result of altered protein and lipid metabolism and thereby abnormal [[granulation tissue]] formation.<ref name="Tweedie">Janet Close-Tweedie , "Daibetic foot wounds and wound healing: a review, ''The Diabetic Foot'' 2002; 68</ref> Increased glucose levels in the body end up in uncontrolled covalent bonding of [[aldose]] sugars to a protein or lipid without any normal [[glycosylation]] enzymes.<ref name="Goldin">{{cite pmid|16894049|noedit}}</ref> These stable products then accumulate over the surface of cell membranes, structural proteins and circulating proteins. These products are called [[advanced glycation endproducts]] (AGEs) or Amadori products. Formation of AGEs occurs on [[extracellular matrix]] proteins with slow turnover rate.

;Impaired NO synthesis
[[Nitric oxide]] is known as an important stimulator of cell proliferation, maturation and [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]]. Thus, [[nitric oxide]] increases [[fibroblast]] proliferation and thereby collagen production in wound healing. Also, L-[[arginine]] and [[nitric oxide]] are required for proper cross linking of collagen fibers, via proline, to minimize scarring and maximize the tensile strength of healed tissue.<ref name="Kei">{{cite pmid|16171977|noedit}}</ref> Endothelial cell specific [[nitric oxide synthase]] (EcNOS) is activated by the pulsatile flow of blood through vessels. Nitric oxide produced by EcNOS, maintains the diameter of blood vessels and proper blood flow to tissues. In addition to this, nitric oxide also regulates [[angiogenesis]], which plays a major role in [[wound healing]].<ref name="Dan">{{cite pmid| 15162796|noedit}}</ref> Thus, diabetic patients exhibit reduced ability to generate [[nitric oxide]] from L-[[arginine]]. Reasons that have been postulated in the literature include accumulation of [[nitric oxide synthase]] inhibitor due to high glucose associated kidney dysfunction and reduced production of [[nitric oxide synthase]] due to [[ketoacidosis]] observed in diabetic patients and pH dependent nature of [[nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name="Goldin"/><ref name="Linden">{{cite pmid|18256374|noedit}}</ref>

;Structural and functional changes in fibroblasts
Diabetic ulcer [[fibroblasts]] show various morphological differences compared to fibroblasts from age matched controls. Diabetic ulcer fibroblasts are usually large and widely spread in the culture flask compared to the spindle shaped morphology of the fibroblasts in age-matched controls. They often show dilated [[endoplasmic reticulum]], numerous vesicular bodies and lack of microtubular structure in [[transmission electron microscopy]] study. Therefore, interpretation of these observations would be that in spite of high protein production and protein turnover in diabetic ulcer fibroblasts, vesicles containing secretory proteins could not travel along the [[microtubules]] to release the products outside.<ref name="fibroblasts">{{cite pmid|10195396|noedit}}</ref><ref name="Rowe">{{cite pmid|849809|noedit}}</ref> Fibroblasts from diabetic ulcer exhibit proliferative impairment that probably contributes to a decreased production of [[extracellular matrix]] proteins and delayed wound contraction and impaired wound healing.<ref name="fibroblasts"/> 

;Increased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activity
In order for a wound to heal, [[extracellular matrix]] not only needs to be laid down but also must be able to undergo degradation and remodeling to form a mature tissue with appropriate [[tensile strength]].<ref name="Ravanti">{{cite pmid|10998429|noedit}}</ref> Proteases, namely [[matrix metalloproteinases]] are known to degrade almost all the [[extracellular matrix]] components. They are known to be involved in [[fibroblast]] and [[keratinocyte]] migration, tissue re-organization, inflammation and remodeling of the wounded tissue.<ref name="McLennan"/><ref name="Ravanti"/> Due to persistently high concentrations of pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]] in diabetic ulcers, MMP activity is known to increase by 30 fold when compared to acute [[wound healing]].<ref name="Vaalamo">{{cite pmid| 10414498|noedit}}</ref> MMP-2 and MMP-9 show sustained overexpression in chronic non-healing diabetic ulcers.<ref name="McLennan"/><ref name="Wysocki">{{cite pmid| 8392530|noedit}}</ref> Balance in the MMP activity is usually achieved by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). Rather than absolute concentrations of either two, it is the ratio of MMP and TIMP that maintains the proteolytic balance and this ratio is found to be disturbed in diabetic ulcer.<ref name="Lobman">{{Cite doi|10.1007/s00125-002-0868-8|noedit}}</ref><ref name="Muller">{{cite pmid|18387077|noedit}}</ref> In spite of these findings, the exact mechanism responsible for increased MMP activity in diabetes is not known yet.

Most MMP genes have TGF-β inhibitory element in their promoter regions and thus TGF–β regulates the expression of both MMP and their inhibitor TIMP.<ref name="Susan">{{cite pmid|10997695|noedit}}</ref>
In addition to the importance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, all phases of wound healing are controlled by a wide variety of different [[growth factors]] and [[cytokines]]. To mention precisely, growth factors promote switching of early inflammatory phase to the [[granulation tissue]] formation. Decrease in growth factors responsible for tissue repair such as TGF-β is documented in diabetic wounds. Thus, reduced levels of TGFβ in diabetes cases lower down the effect of inhibitory regulatory effect on MMP genes and thus cause MMPs to over express.<ref name="Harold"/><ref name="Bennet">{{cite pmid|8392302|noedit}}</ref><ref name="Galkowska">{{cite pmid|17014667|noedit}}</ref>

===Biomechanics===
{{Technical|date=July 2012}}
Complications in the Diabetic foot and foot-ankle complex are wider and more destructive than expected, and may compromise structure and function of several systems: vascular, nervous, somatosensory, musculoskeletal. Thus, a deeper comprehension of the alteration of gait and foot biomechanics in the Diabetic foot is of great interest, and may play a role in the design and onset of preventive as well as therapeutic actions. 

Briefly, we can summarise the effect of diabetes on the main structures of the foot-ankle complex as:
* effects on skin: skin – and the soft tissues immediately underneath the skin - undergo greater compression and shear loading than usual, thus explaining the onset of tissue damage so deeply correlated to traumatic ulceration processes. Besides this, skin of the Diabetic foot suffers from loss of [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic nervous]] control and consequently reduced hydration, making it less elastic and thus more vulnerable to the action of increased mechanical stress;
* effects on tendons and ligaments:  protein [[glycosylation]] and the resulting collagen abnormalities lead to greater transversal section – i.e. thickening - of tendons and ligaments and a greater coefficient of elasticity. Particularly impacted by this process are Plantar Fascia and Achilles Tendon. Both causes lead to an increased stiffness of those structures;
* effects on cartilage: similar to what happens to tendons and ligaments, cartilage changes its composition mainly due to the modification of collagen fibers; this increases its stiffness and decreases the range of motion of all joints in the foot and ankle;
* effects on muscles: Diabetes mellitus causes severe damage to nerve conduction, thus causing a worsening in the management of the related muscle fibers. As a consequence, both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the foot-ankle complex are damaged in structure (reduction of muscle volume) and function (reduction of muscle strength);
* effects on peripheral sensory system: impaired nerve conduction has a dramatic effect on the peripheral sensory system, since it leads to loss of protective sensation under the sole of the foot. This exposes the Diabetic foot to thermal or mechanical trauma, and to the late detection of infection processes or tissue breakdown;
* effects on foot morphology (deformities): due to most of the above alterations, a significant imbalance of peripheral musculature and soft tissue occur in the foot which seriously alters its morphology and determines the onset of foot deformities. Most common deformities of the Diabetic foot are represented by a high longitudinal arch (rigid cavus foot), hammer toes and hallux valgus. A completely different morphologic degeneration is represented by the Charcot foot, whose analysis is not part of this discussion.<ref>Vileikyte L, Rubin RR, Peyrot M, Gonzalez JS, Boulton AJ, Ulbrecht JS, Cavanagh PR.

== Treatment ==
Foot ulcers in diabetes require multidisciplinary assessment, usually by diabetes specialists and [[surgeon]]s. Treatment consists of appropriate bandages, [[antibiotic]]s (against [[staphylococcus]], [[streptococcus]] and [[anaerobe]] strains), [[debridement]], arterial revascularisation and platelet-rich [[fibrin]] therapies.

== Classification ==
Identification of diabetic foot in medical databases, such as commercial claims and prescription data, is complicated by the lack of a specific ICD-9 code for diabetic foot and variation in coding practices.  The following codes indicate ulcer of the lower limb or foot:
