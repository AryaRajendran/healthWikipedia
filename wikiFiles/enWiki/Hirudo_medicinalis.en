'''Medicinal leeches''' are any of several [[species]] of [[leeches]], but most commonly '''''Hirudo medicinalis''''', the '''European medicinal leech'''.

Other ''[[Hirudo]]'' species sometimes used as medicinal leeches include (but are not limited to) ''[[Hirudo orientalis]]'', ''[[Hirudo troctina]]'', and ''[[Hirudo verbana]]''. The Mexican medical leech is ''[[Hirudinaria manillensis]]'', and the North American medical leech is ''[[Macrobdella decora]]''.

==Morphology==
The general [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of medicinal leeches follows that of most other leeches. Fully mature adults can be up to 20&nbsp;cm in length, and are green, brown, or greenish-brown with a darker tone on the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side and a lighter [[ventral]] side. The dorsal side also has a thin red stripe. These organisms have two suckers, one at each end, called the [[anterior]] and [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] suckers. The posterior is used mainly for leverage, whereas the anterior sucker, consisting of the [[jaw]] and [[teeth]], is where the feeding takes place. Medicinal leeches have three jaws (tripartite) that look like little saws, and on them are about 100 sharp teeth used to incise the host. The incision leaves a mark that is an inverted Y inside of a circle. After piercing the skin and injecting [[anticoagulant]]s ([[hirudin]]) and [[anaesthetic]]s, they suck out [[blood]]. Large adults can consume up to ten times their body weight in a single meal, with 5-15 ml being the average volume taken.<ref name=wells>{{Cite journal|author=Wells MD, Manktelow RT, Boyd JB, Bowen V |title=The medical leech: an old treatment revisited |journal=Microsurgery |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=183–6 |year=1993 |pmid=8479316}}</ref> These leeches can live for up to a year between feeding.

Medicinal leeches are [[hermaphrodite]]s that reproduce by [[sex]]ual mating, laying eggs in clutches of up to 50 near (but not under) water, and in shaded, humid places.

==Range and ecology==
[[File:HirudoMedicinalisHabitat.jpg|thumb|left|Typical habitat with a large population of ''Hirudo medicinalis'', in Germany]]
Their range extends over almost the whole of [[Europe]] and into [[Asia]] as far as [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. The preferred habitat for this species is muddy freshwater pools and ditches with plentiful weed growth in temperate climates.

[[Over-exploitation]] by [[leech collector]]s in the 19th century has left only scattered populations, and reduction in natural habitat though drainage has also contributed to their decline. Another factor has been the replacement of [[horse]]s in [[farming]] (horses were medicinal leeches' preferred food source) and provision of artificial water supplies for [[cattle]]. As a result, this species is now considered [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[IUCN]], and European medicinal leeches are legally protected through nearly all of their natural range. They are particularly sparsely distributed in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], and in the UK there may be as few as 20 remaining isolated populations (all widely scattered). The largest (at [[Lydd]]) is estimated to contain several thousand individuals; 12 of these areas have been designated [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]]. There are small, transplanted populations in several countries outside their natural range, including the [[USA]].

==Medicinal use==

===Beneficial Secretions===
Medicinal leeches have been found to secrete saliva containing about 60 different proteins.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baskova|first=I.P.|coauthors=Zavalova, Basanova, Moshkovskii, Zgoda|title=Protein Profiling of the Medicinal Leech Salivary Gland Secretion by Proteomic Analytical Methods|journal=Biochemistry|year=2004|month=Nov.|volume=69|issue=7|pages=770–775|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> These achieve a wide variety of goals useful to the leech as it feeds, helping to keep the blood in liquid form and increasing blood flow in the affected area. Several of these secreted proteins serve as [[anticoagulant]]s (such as [[hirudin]]), [[Platelet_aggregation#Adhesion_and_aggregation|platelet aggregation]] inhibitors (most notably [[apyrase]], [[collagenase]], and calin), [[Vasodilation|vasodilators]], and [[Protease|proteinase]] inhibitors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biology|url=http://leeches-medicinalis.com/the-leeches/biology/|work=Sangues Medicinales|publisher=Ricarimpex|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref>  It is also thought that the saliva contains an [[anesthetic]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mory|first=Robert N.|coauthors=Mindell, David; Bloom, David A.|title=The Leech and the Physician: Biology, Etymology, and Medical Practice with Hirudinea medicinalis|journal=World Journal of Surgery|date=1 July 2000|volume=24|issue=7|pages=878–883|doi=10.1007/s002680010141|url=http://download.springer.com.proxy3.library.jhu.edu/static/pdf/500/art%253A10.1007%252Fs002680010141.pdf?auth66=1355370667_91c999018ef87b09a77ed1566349e480&ext=.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> as leech bites are generally not painful.

===In the past===
[[File:LeechJarBedfordMuseum.JPG|thumb|Earthenware jar for holding medicinal leeches]]
The first description of leech therapy, classified as [[bloodletting|blood letting]], was found in the text of Sushruta samhita (dating 800 B.C.) written by [[Sushruta]], who was also considered the father of plastic surgery. He described about 6 types of leeches (poisonous and non-poisonous). Diseases where leech therapy was indicated were skin diseases, sciatica, and musculoskeletal pains.  

In medieval and early modern medicine, the medicinal leech (''Hirudo medicinalis'' and its congeners ''Hirudo verbana'', ''Hirudo troctina'', and ''Hirudo orientalis'') was used to remove blood from a patient as part of a process to "balance" the "[[Humorism|humors]]" that, according to [[Galen]], must be kept in balance for the human body to function properly. (The four humors of ancient medical philosophy were blood, [[phlegm]], [[black bile]], and [[yellow bile]].) Any sickness that caused the subject's skin to become red (e.g. [[fever]] and inflammation), so the theory went, must have arisen from too much blood in the body. Similarly, any person whose behavior was strident and "sanguine" was thought to be suffering from an excess of blood. Leeches were often gathered by leech collectors and were eventually farmed in large numbers.

A recorded use of leeches in medicine was also found during 200 B.C. by the Greek physician [[Nicander]] in [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]].<ref name="wells"/> Medical use of leeches was discussed by [[Avicenna]] in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1020s), and by [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif al-Baghdadi]] in the 12th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The use of leeches began to become less widespread towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=wells/>

===Today===
Medicinal leeches are now making a comeback in [[microsurgery]]. They provide an effective means to reduce blood [[coagulation]], to relieve venous pressure from pooling blood (venous insufficiency), and in [[reconstructive surgery]] to stimulate circulation in reattachment operations for organs with critical blood flow, such as eyelids, fingers, and ears.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Abdelgabar AM, Bhowmick BK |title=The return of the leech |journal=Int.

Because of the minuscule amounts of [[hirudin]] present in leeches, it is impractical to harvest the substance for widespread medical use. Hirudin (and related substances) are synthesised using [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] techniques. Devices called "mechanical leeches" that dispense heparin and perform the same function as medicinal leeches have been developed, but they are not yet commercially available.<ref>Salleh, Anna.
