'''Slone's Disease''' is another name for a specific form of [[Hereditary Pancreatitis]]. It is a rare [[heredity|inherited]] condition characterized by recurrent episodes of acute [[pancreatitis]] attacks. In about half of these cases the problem progresses to chronic pancreatitis, which is severe scarring of the [[pancreas]]. Laboratory tests performed during an attack usually detect high blood levels of [[amylase]] and [[lipase]], which are [[enzyme]]s released from the pancreas. 

The first attack typically occurs within the first two decades of life, but can begin at any age. In the [[United States]], the majority of Slones patients have a lineage which can be traced back to [[Appalachia]]. It is estimated that at least 1,000 individuals are newly diagnosed with hereditary pancreatitis each year. As genetic testing increases, these numbers may escalate.

==Symptoms of Hereditary Pancreatitis==

Patients with hereditary pancreatitis may have chronic [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[malnutrition]], or [[diabetes]]. 

==Living with Slone's Disease==

One patient in western [[Kentucky]] was diagnosed with pancreatitis at 6 weeks of age. She continued to have severe episodes of pancreatitis throughout her childhood. In 1990 at the age of 5, she had a [[Peustow procedure]] performed at the [[Mayo Clinic]] by Dr. [[Christopher Moir]]. Despite repeated procedures, she continues to have episodes of [[pancreatitis]].
