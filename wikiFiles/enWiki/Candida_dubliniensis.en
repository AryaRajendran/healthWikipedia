'''''Candida dubliniensis''''' is a [[fungus|fungal]] opportunistic pathogen originally isolated from [[AIDS]] patients. It is also occasionally isolated from [[immunocompetent]] individuals. It is a [[Phenotypic switching|dimorphic]] [[yeast]] of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', very closely related to ''[[Candida albicans]]'' but forming a distinct [[phylogenetic]] cluster in [[DNA fingerprinting]]. It is most commonly isolated from oral cavities, <ref>{{cite journal | author=Gilfillan GD, Sullivan DJ, Haynes K, Parkinson T, Coleman DC, Gow NAR | title=''Candida dubliniensis'': Phylogeny and putative virulence factors| journal=Microbiology | volume=144 | issue=4 | year=1998 | pages=829–838 | doi=10.1099/00221287-144-4-829 | pmid=9579058}}</ref> and is also occasionally found in other anatomical sites.

==Prevalence and epidemiology==
''Candida dubliniensis'' is cosmopolitan (found around the world), and has been described as a separate species in 1995.<ref name=sullivan>{{cite journal | author=Sullivan DJ, Westerneng TJ, Haynes KA, Bennett DE, Coleman DC | title=''Candida dubliniensis'' sp. nov.: phenotypic and molecular characterization of a novel species associated with oral candidosis in HIV-infected individuals | journal=Microbiol. | year=1995 | volume=141 | pages=1507–1521 | doi=10.1099/13500872-141-7-1507 | issue=7 }}</ref> Retrospective studies have shown that previously it had been commonly identified as ''Candida albicans'', with which ''C. dubliniensis'' is closely related and shares a number of characteristics.

One test for distinguishing ''C. dubliniensis'' from ''C. albicans'', is laboratory culture of the organism at 42°C. Most ''C. albicans'' strains grow at this temperature,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kamiyama A, Niimi M, Tokunaga M,. Nakayama H | title= Adansonian study of ''Candida albicans'': intraspecific homogeneity excepting ''C. stellatoidea'' strains | journal=J Med Vet Mycol | year=1989 |volume=27 | pages=229–241 | doi=10.1080/02681218980000311 | pmid=2677300 | issue=4}}</ref> whereas most ''C. dubliniensis'' isolates do not.<ref name=sullivan/> There are also significant differences in the conditions that lead to the formation of [[chlamydospore]]s between ''C. albicans'' and ''C. dubliniensis'', although they are otherwise phenotypically very similar.<ref name=sullivan/> 

A European study of 2,589 isolates, that had originally been identified as ''C. albicans'', revealed that 52 of them (2.0%) were ''C. dubliniensis''. Most of these isolates were from oral or faecal specimens from HIV-positive patients, though one vaginal and two oral isolates were from healthy individuals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Another study in the [[United States]] surveyed 1,251 yeasts previously identified as ''C. albicans'', and identified 15 isolates (1.2%) as ''C. dubliniensis''. Most of these isolates were from immunocompromised individuals, such as [[AIDS]], [[chemotherapy]], or [[organ transplant]] patients.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The majority of ''C. dubliniensis'' strains were recovered from respiratory, [[urine]] and [[human feces|stool]] specimens.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center also conducted several studies, both retrospective and prospective. In 974 germ-tube positive yeasts, 22 isolates (2.3%) from 16 patients were ''C. dubliniesis''. All individuals were immunologically compromised with either malignancy or AIDS, and the isolates came from a variety of different sites. ''C. dubliniensis'' was also isolated from the mouths of 18% of patients with [[diabetes]] and who use [[insulin]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Willis AM, Coulter WA, Sullivan DJ, Coleman DC, Hayes JR, Bell PM, Lamey PJ | year=2000 | title=Isolation of ''C. dubliniensis'' from insulin-using diabetes mellitus patients | journal=J Oral Path & Med. | volume=29 | issue=2 | pages=86–90 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0714.2000.290206.x }}</ref>

==Antifungal susceptibility==
In one study, all 20 ''C. dubliniensis'' isolates tested were susceptible to [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]] and [[amphotericin B]].<ref name=Moran>{{cite journal | author=Moran GP, Sullivan DJ, Henman MC, McCreary CE, Harrington BJ, Shanley DB, Coleman DC | title=Antifungal drug susceptibilities of oral ''Candida dubliniensis'' isolates from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and non-HIV-infected subjects and generation of stable fluconazole-resistant derivatives in vitro | journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.| year=1997 | month=March| volume=41 | issue=3 | pages=617–23 | pmid=9056003 | pmc=163761}} </ref> 

===Fluconazole===
Many isolates of ''C. dubliniensis'' are sensitive to [[fluconazole]]. In one study, 16 of 20 isolates were sensitive to [[fluconazole]], while four were resistant.<ref name=Moran/> It has been hypothesized that ''C. dubliniensis'' has the ability to rapidly develop resistance to fluconazole, especially in patients who are on long-term therapy.<ref name=Moran/> 

Stable fluconazole resistance could be induced ''[[in vitro]]'' by subjecting sensitive strains to increasing concentrations of this antifungal. This resistance is mediated by a multidrug transporter that can be mobilized rapidly in vitro, on exposure to fluconazole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Cases in America have also shown the emergence of fluconazole-resistant ''C. dubliniensis''. Three isolates were discovered in [[Texas]], two of which were resistant (MIC, 64 µg/mL), and one had dose-dependent susceptibility (MIC, 16 µg/mL). Among ''C. dubliniensis'' isolates in HIV+ patients in [[Maryland]], most isolates were highly susceptible to fluconazole. A study of 71 isolates in [[Ireland]], showed that both the fluconazole-resistant and susceptible strains were susceptible to itraconazole, amphotericin B, and 5-[[fluorocytosine]] (microdilution). They were also susceptible to experimental [[triazole]]s and [[voriconazole]] and [[echinocandin]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
