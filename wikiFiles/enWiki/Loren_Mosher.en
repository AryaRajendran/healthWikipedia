Loren Mosher founded the [[Soteria]] experience, on the principle that treating psychosis in the acute phase is possible without using restraint methods.<ref name=Toresini>{{cite journal|last=Toresini|first=Lorenzo|title=Soteria – no restraint system in Italy|journal=Neurologia Croatica|year=2007|volume=56|issue=Suppl 5|pages=120–121|url=http://www.pula-cong.com/CMS/0156/Rep/Documents07/AL/03Toresini.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref>

He was dismissed from the National Institute of Mental Health,<ref name="Bernstein"/> and later resigned from the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in 1998, for controversially disagreeing with prevailing [[psychiatry|psychiatric practice]] and the influence of [[pharmaceutical companies]].

== Biography ==
Loren Mosher was born on the 3rd of September 1933 in [[Monterey]], [[California]], to the married couple of a teacher and boat builder.<ref name="Redler"/> He earned his [[undergraduate degree]] from [[Stanford University]] and his [[medical degree]] from [[Harvard University]],<ref name="Aderhold">{{cite journal |author=Aderhold V., Burti L., Ciompi L., Estroff S., Oaks D., Warner R. |title=Loren Mosher: In Memoriam |journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=vi–vii |year=2004 |month= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/30/4.pdf}}</ref> starting work at NIMH in 1964.<ref name="Bernstein"/> He undertook research training at the [[Tavistock Clinic]] in London from 1966 to 1967 and developed an interest in alternative treatments for schizophrenia.<ref name="Lenzer"/>

Before conceiving Soteria, Mosher supervised a ward in a psychiatric hospital at [[Yale University]] as its assistant professor, prescribed neuroleptics and was not “against” them. But by 1968, the year Mosher received the position of director of the Center for Schizophrenia Studies at the NIMH, he got convinced that benefits of neuroleptics were overhyped.<ref name="Whitaker">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Whitaker|title=Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill|location=Philadelphia|year=2002|pages=220-26|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mDqxay6-51oC&pg=PA220|isbn=9780465020140|publisher=Basic Books}}</ref> 

The house, known as [[Soteria]], was opened in an area of [[San Jose, California]], in April 1971.<ref name="Bentall"/>{{rp|22}} Mosher believed that the violent and controlling atmosphere of psychiatric hospitals and the over-use of drugs hindered recovery. Despite its success (it achieved superior results than the standard medical treatment with drugs<ref name=Calton2008>{{cite journal |author=Calton T, Ferriter M, Huband N, Spandler H |title=A systematic review of the Soteria paradigm for the treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia |journal=[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]] |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=181–92 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=17573357 |pmc=2632384 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm047 |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/1/181}}</ref>
), the Soteria Project closed in 1983 when, according to Loren Mosher and [[Robert Whitaker (author)|Robert Whitaker]] further funding was denied because of the politics of psychiatry that was increasingly controlled by the influence of pharmaceutical companies.<ref name=video>[http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/401 Video] of [[Robert Whitaker (author)|Robert Whitaker]] and Loren Mosher discussing the evidence for the Soteria model.</ref>

Mosher is said to have had a far more nuanced view of the use of [[drugs]] than has been generally thought, and did not reject drugs altogether but insisted they be used as a last resort and in far lower doses than usual in the United States.<ref name="Lenzer"/>

After dismissal from NIMH, he taught psychiatry at the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] and became head of the public mental health system in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]].<ref name="Bernstein"/> He started a crisis house in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], McAuliffe House, based on Soteria principles.<ref name="Bernstein"/>

During the Ritalin phenomenon of the 1990s, he was often featured as a dissenting view in scores of articles. He was the founder and first editor in chief of ''[[Schizophrenia Bulletin]]''.<ref name="Lenzer"/>

Mosher edited or co-authored some books, including ''Community Mental Health: A Practical Guide'', and published more than 100 reviews and articles.<ref name="Redler"/><ref name="Google Scholar Citations">[http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DrY7ObYAAAAJ&hl=en List of works on Google Scholar Citations]</ref> He held professorships and ran mental health programmes on both the US coasts.<ref name="Redler"/> Mosher also headed his own consulting company, Soteria Associates, providing research, forensic and mental health consultation<ref name="Redler"/> and cooperated for years with numerous advocacy groups, including the psychiatric survivor group [[MindFreedom International]].<ref name="Lenzer"/> He wrote a preface to [[Peter Lehmann (author)|Peter Lehmann’s]] book ''Coming off Psychiatric Drugs'' (2004).<ref>In Peter Lehmann (Ed.) (2004). ‘Coming off psychiatric drugs: Successful withdrawal from neuroleptics, antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine and tranquilizers’ (pp. 15-17). Berlin / Eugene / Shrewsbury: Peter Lehmann Publishing. ISBN 978-0-9545428-0-1 (UK), ISBN 978-0-9788399-0-1 (USA)</ref>

Dr. Mosher moved to San Diego from Washington in 1996. He became clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Diego medical school. 

He was married to, and later divorced, Irene Carleton Mosher.

At the time of his death he was in Berlin for experimental cancer treatment.

Survivors included his wife, Judy Schreiber, three children from the first marriage, a granddaughter, and two brothers.
