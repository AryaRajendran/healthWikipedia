'''Minor physical anomalies''' ('''MPA'''s) are relatively minor (typically painless and, in themselves, harmless) congenital physical abnormalities consisting of features such as [[low-seated ears]], [[single transverse palmar crease]], [[telecanthus]], [[micrognathism]] and [[furrowed tongue]].{{cn|date=February 2012}} While MPAs may have a genetic basis, they might also be caused by factors in the fetal environment: [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], bleeding, or [[infection]].{{cn|date=February 2012}} MPAs have been linked to disorders of [[pregnancy]]{{cn|date=February 2012}} and are thought by some to be a marker for insults to the fetal neural development towards the end of the first trimester{{cn|date=February 2012}}. Thus, in the neurodevelopmental literature, they are seen as indirect indications of inferferences with [[brain development]].{{cn|date=February 2012}} In studies of children and adolescents with conduct problems, such markers have been linked to some extent to [[impulsivity]] and [[aggressiveness]].{{cn|date=February 2012}}

MPAs have been studied in [[autism]], [[down syndrome]], and in [[schizophrenia]]. A 2008 [[meta-analysis]] found that MPAs are significantly increased in the autistic population.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Mol Psychiatry |date=2008 |volume= 15|issue= 3|pages= 300–7|title= Minor physical anomalies in autism: a meta-analysis |author= Ozgen HM, Hop JW, Hox JJ, Beemer FA, van Engeland H |doi=10.1038/mp.2008.75 |pmid=18626481}}</ref> A 1998 study found that 60% of its schizophrenic sample and 38% of their siblings had 6 or more minor physical anomalies (especially in the [[craniofacial]] area), while only 5% of the control group showed that many.<ref>Ismail, B I, Cantor-Graso, E, and McNeil, T P (1998).

Some Minor Physical Anomalies related to [[schizophrenia]] have a hypoxic contribution to their formation.{{cn|date=February 2012}}

These anomalies are thought to reflect changes in the brain as both are derived{{clarify|date=February 2012}} from the [[ectoderm]].{{cn|date=February 2012}}

Several minor physical anomalies are attributable in part by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].{{cn|date=February 2012}} The most often cited minor physical anomaly: high arched palate, is described in articles as a microform of a [[cleft palate]], <ref>Baher Ismail, Elizabeth Cantor-Graae, Thomas F McNeil."Minor physical anomalies in schizophrenic patients and their siblings" The American Journal of Psychiatry. Washington: Dec 1998. Vol. 155, Iss. 12; pg. 1695. Cleft palates are partly attributable to hypoxia: Guillermo Millicovsky, Malcolm C. Johnston, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 78, No. 9, [Part 2: Biological Sciences] (Sep., 1981), pp. 5722-5723 </ref> The vaulted palate caused by nasal obstruction and consequent mouth breathing, without the lateralising effect of the tongue can produce [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] at night.{{cn|date=February 2012}}

Other malformations are reported only sporadically. Capillary Malformation is induced by RASA1 mutation and can be changed by hypoxia:<ref>Rob Helton, Jiankun Cui, John R. Scheel, Julie A. Ellison, Chris Ames, Claire Gibson, Barbara Blouw, Ling Ouyang, Ioannis Dragatsis, Scott Zeitlin, Randall S. Johnson, Stuart A. Lipton, and Carrolee Barlow , April 20 2005, Brain-Specific knock- out of Hypoxia inducible factor -1alpha, reduces&nbsp;— rather than increases hypoxix-ischemic damage, The Journal of Neuroscience, pp 4099-4107, http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/16/4099/TBL2.</ref>  A study in the American Journal of Psychiatry by Trixler et al.: <ref>Mátyás Trixler, M.D., Ph.D., Tamás Tényi, M.D., Györgyi Csábi, M.D.,Gizella Szabó, M.D., and Károly Méhes, M.D., Ph.D., Sc.D,; 1997 Informative Morphogenetic Variants in Patients With Schizophrenia, and Alcohol-Dependent Patients: Beyond the Waldrop Scale, 154:691–693 . http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/154/5/691.pdf</ref> found hemangiomas to be highly significant in schizophrenia. [[Exotropia]] is reported as having low correlation and high significance as well.<ref>See Toyota et al., (2004) Vol 13(5) "Association between schizophrenia with ocular misalignment and polyalanine length variation in PMX2B"; Human Molecular Genetics; p551; (http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/5/551 as of 13-12-07).</ref>  It can be caused by perinatal hypoxia.<ref>R.
