The '''[[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] dilator muscle''' ('''pupil dilator muscle''', '''pupillary dilator''', '''radial muscle of iris''', '''radiating fibers'''), is a [[smooth muscle]]<ref>[http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/7/12/3813.pdf jneurosci.org Muscarinic and Nicotinic Synaptic Activation of the Developing..]</ref> of the [[human eye|eye]], running radially in the iris and therefore fit as a dilator. The pupillary dilator consists of a spokelike arrangement of modified contractile cells called myoepithelial cells.  These cells are stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system.<ref name="saladin">{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth|title=Anatomy and Physiology|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|pages=616–617}}</ref>  When stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system, the cells contract, widening the pupil and allowing for more light to pass through the eye.  Pupillary dilation occurs in two situations: when light intensity changes and when we shift our gaze between distant and nearby objects.<ref name="saladin" />  The pupillary dilator acts as an antagonist to the pupillary constrictor which narrows the pupil and admits less light to the eye. It has its origin from the anterior epithelium.<ref>"eye, human." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.</ref>  It is innervated by the sympathetic system, which acts by releasing [[noradrenaline]], which acts on [[α1-receptors]].<ref name=Rang163>{{cite book |author=Rang, H. P. |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-443-07145-4 |oclc= |doi=}} Page 163</ref> Thus, when presented with a threatening stimuli that activates the [[fight-or-flight]] response, this innervation contracts the muscle and dilates the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], thus temporarily letting more light reach the [[retina]]. The pupillary dilator acts as an antagonist to the pupillary constrictor which narrows the pupil and admits less light to the eye. 

The dilator muscle is innervated more specifically by postganglionic sympathetic nerves arising from the superior cervical ganglion as the [[Sympathetic root of ciliary ganglion]]. They will follow both short ciliary and long ciliary nerves to reach the dilator muscle.
