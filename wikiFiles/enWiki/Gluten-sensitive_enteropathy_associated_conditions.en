'''Gluten-sensitive enteropathy''' (GSE) has key symptoms typically restricted to the bowel and associated tissues, however there are a wide variety of associated conditions.  These include bowel disorders ([[diarrhoea]], [[constipation]], irritable bowel), [[eosinophilic gastroenteritis]] and increase with [[coeliac disease]] (CD) severity. With some early onset and a large percentage of late onset disease, other disorders appear prior to the celiac diagnosis <ref name="pmid630212">{{cite journal | author = Cooper BT, Holmes GK, Cooke WT | title = Coeliac disease and immunological disorders | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 6112 | pages = 537–539 | year = 1978 | pmid = 630212 | doi =10.1136/bmj.1.6112.537 | pmc = 1603223 }}</ref> or allergic-like responses (IgE or IgA, IgG) markedly increased in GSE.  Many of these disorders persist on a strict [[gluten-free diet|gluten-free]] (GF) diet, and are thus independent of coeliac disease after triggering. For example, autoimmune [[thyroiditis]] is a common finding with GSE. 

However, GSEs' association with disease is not limited to common autoimmune diseases.  Coeliac disease has been found at increased frequency on followup to many autoimmune diseases, some rare. Complex causes of autoimmune diseases often demonstrates only weak association with celiac disease. The frequency of GSE is typically around 0.3 to 1% and lifelong risk of this form of [[gluten sensitivity]] increases in age, possibly as high as 2% for people over 60 years of age.<ref name="pmid18467196">{{cite journal |author=Vilppula A |title=Undetected coeliac disease in the elderly A biopsy-proven population-based study |journal=Dig Liver Dis |volume= 40|issue= 10|pages= 809–813|year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18467196 |doi=10.1016/j.dld.2008.03.013 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Collin P |author3=Mäki M |display-authors=3 |last4=Valve |first4=R. |last5=Luostarinen |first5=M. |last6=Krekelä |first6=I. |last7=Patrikainen |first7=H. |last8=Kaukinen |first8=K. |last9=Luostarinen |first9=L.}}</ref> This coincides with the period in life when late-onset autoimmune diseases also rise in frequency.

===Diabetes===
'''Type 1 (Juvenile onset)'''. The incidence of juvenile [[diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 Diabetes]] (T1D) is about 1:500 in the U.S. population, and is the result of autoimmune damage to the [[Islets of Langerhans]] cells in the pancreas. The level of adult onset T1D plus ambiguous T1D/T2D is unknown. It is unclear how large a role ''Triticeae'' has in T1D which also shows strong linkage to DQ2.5 and DQ8.

===Gastroesophageal reflux disease===
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the indirect result of many factors and some autoimmune diseases like [[schleroderma]]. GSE can cause inflammation and [[delayed gastric emptying]], which can persist through most of the sleeping hours causing GERD. GSE is associated with an increase of food allergies, in some patients this can cause diarrhea, but in others constipation. In some patients, food allergies and GERD are an apparent symptom of GSE, but these allergies and GERD often persist on a GF diet. While GERD associated with GSE can be treated with acid blockers, it is most effectively treated with proper eating habits and elimination diet. The more powerful

===Peripheral neuropathies===
[[Peripheral neuropathy|Peripheral neuropathies]] are greatly increased in people who have GSE. In clinical CD there is on obvious reason; avitaminosis and the inability to adsorb essential fatty acids and vitamins can lead to nervous system problems, including sensitivity of the peripheral nervous system. In addition to these problems there are a number or rare autoimmune conditions, secondary autoimmunities, such as fibromyalgia that are more frequent in GSE than in the normal population. Gulliane-Barre syndrome is associated with peripheral neuropathies, and it has been found that [[anti-ganglioside antibodies|anti-ganglioside autoantibodies]] take part in the binding to axons and schwann cells.

===Visual and auditory disturbances===
According to recent studies, calcifications of channels seen in dementia can also occur in specific brain areas such as the visual complex in the occipital lobe. Such calcium channel blockages can cause visual problems or partial field hallucinations (Paroxysmal visual manifestations).<ref name="pmid15489401">{{cite journal | author = Pfaender M, D'Souza WJ, Trost N, Litewka L, Paine M, Cook M | title = Visual disturbances representing occipital lobe epilepsy in patients with cerebral calcifications and coeliac disease: a case series | journal = J.

===Depression===
[[Depression (physiology)|Depression]] in GSE has several causes; in the more severe CD, depression can be the result of lower vitamin adsorption<ref name="pmid6369511"/> and essential fatty acid adsorption (see section on autism).

===Anxiety===
[[Anxiety]] is a common feature of GSE; treatment on a gluten-free diet is effective at reducing anxiety, some aspect of which may be due to maladsorption phenomena and cytokine activity (i.e. constant stress).<ref name="pmid11346203"/>

===Chronic fatigue===
Chronic fatigue associated with GSE is a systemic disorder, however there are neurological components that are especially manifest in blood deficiencies like avitaminosis, amineralosis and anemia.
