After graduating from Duke, Meriwether took his internship at the [[Penn State Milton S.

In 1976 Meriwether, as Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Health, was appointed Director of the [[United States Public Health Service]]'s National Influenza Immunization Program (NIIP). The NIIP sought to immunize over 200 million people against [[swine influenza]] within six months. This program faced much opposition as many doctors, pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies refused to take responsibility for mishaps.

Meriwether began competitive running in 1970 while working at the Baltimore Cancer Research Center. In order to train Meriwether would scale a fence at the nearby [[Johns Hopkins University]] athletics track and would run at night in the dark.<ref name="courant1">{{cite news|url=http://www.courant.com/sports/bal-te.faces27,0,912962,full.story|title=Faces in the Crowd|last=Klingaman|first=Mike|date=November 26, 2005|publisher=[[Hartford Courant]]|accessdate=March 9, 2009}}</ref>  Due to his relative inexperience and unique attire, Meriwether drew the attention of the news media; appearing on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] magazine posing in his running gear,<ref name="si1"/> and also featured in [[Time magazine]].<ref name="time1"/> 

Meriwether made his mark as a runner at the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]] in June 1971 when he won the [[100 yard dash]].<ref name="si1">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084609/index.htm|title=Champion Of The Armchair Athletes|last=Boyle|first=Robert H.|date=February 22, 1971|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref> His appearance at the event was unusual for a number of reasons. He was unattached to any educational institution and he was wearing a [[Scrubs (clothing)|hospital shirt]], gold and white [[suspenders]] and [[Swimsuit|swimming trunks]]. The most remarkable element of the day was the time he recorded for the [[100 yard dash]]. In recording a nine second 100 yard he became the second runner to run the distance in nine seconds flat, the other being [[John Carlos]], however Meriwether's time did not count as a record as the run was [[100 metres#Climatic conditions|wind assisted]].<ref name="si3">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1084486/index.htm|title=hey, I Can Beat Those Guys|last=Treadwell|first=Sandy|date=January 18, 1971|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}</ref><ref name="time1"/><ref name="dailynews1"/><ref name="aden1">{{cite book|last=Aden|first=Roger|title=Popular Stories and Promised Lands |publisher=University of Alabama Press|year=1999|pages=204|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>

After another injury prevented his chances of being selected for the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]], he retired from regular competition to concentrate on medicine.<ref name="si2">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009660/index.htm|title=Sprinter Delano Meriwether|last=Noden|first=Merrill|date=March 24, 1997|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}</ref>
