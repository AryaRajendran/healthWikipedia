'''Tinnitus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|n|ɪ|t|ə|s}}; from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:en:tinnitus#Latin|tinnītus]]'' meaning "[[ringing (medicine)|ringing]]" is the perception of sound within the human ear not including the perception of sound outside the ear.

Tinnitus is not a disease, but a condition that can result from a wide range of underlying causes: neurological damage ([[multiple sclerosis]]), [[ear infection]]s, [[oxidative stress]],<ref>{{Cite pmid|18229788}}</ref> foreign objects in the ear, nasal allergies that prevent (or induce) fluid drain, wax build-up, and exposure to loud sounds. Withdrawal from [[benzodiazepine]]s may cause tinnitus as well. In-ear earphones, whose sound enters directly into the ear canal without any opportunity to be deflected or absorbed elsewhere, are a common cause of tinnitus when volume is set beyond moderate levels.

Tinnitus may be an accompaniment of [[sensorineural hearing loss]] or congenital hearing loss, or it may be observed as a [[side effect]] of certain medications ([[ototoxicity|ototoxic]] tinnitus). However, the most common cause is [[noise-induced hearing loss]].

As tinnitus is usually a subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to measure using objective tests, such as by comparison with noise of known frequency and intensity, as in an [[Audiometry|audiometric test]]. The condition is often rated clinically on a simple scale from "slight" to "catastrophic" according to the practical difficulties it imposes, such as interference with sleep, quiet activities, and normal daily activities.<ref name="otohns-1030">{{cite web|url=http://www.otohns.net/default.asp?id=1030|title=Guidelines for the Grading of Tinnitus Severity|accessdate=2009-12-31

Tinnitus is common: about 20% of people between 55 and 65 years old report symptoms on a general health questionnaire, and 11.8% on more detailed tinnitus-specific questionnaires.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Demeester K, van Wieringen A, Hendrickx JJ, Topsakal V, Fransen E, Van Laer L, De Ridder D, Van Camp G, Van de Heyning P.|year=2007|title=Prevalence of tinnitus and audiometric shape|publisher=B-ENT. 3 Suppl 7:37-49.

==Characteristics==
Tinnitus can be perceived in one or both ears or in the head. It is usually described as a ringing noise, but in some patients, it takes the form of a high-pitched whining, electric buzzing, hissing, humming, tinging or whistling sound, or as ticking, clicking, roaring, "crickets" or "tree frogs" or "locusts ([[cicada]]s)", tunes, songs, beeping, sizzling, sounds that slightly resemble human voices or even a pure steady tone like that heard during a hearing test, and in some cases, pressure changes from the interior ear.<ref name="rnid-about">{{cite web|url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/information_resources/tinnitus/about_tinnitus/what_is_tinnitus/ |title=Information and resources: Tinnitus: About tinnitus: What is tinnitus |publisher=RNID.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> It has also been described as a "whooshing" sound because of acute muscle spasms, as of wind or waves.<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003043|Ear noises or buzzing}}</ref> Tinnitus can be intermittent, or it can be continuous, in which case it can be the cause of great distress.

The sound perceived may range from a quiet background noise to one that can be heard even over loud external sounds. Heller and Bergman (1953) conducted a study of 100 tinnitus-free university students placed in an [[anechoic chamber]] and found 93% reported hearing a buzzing, pulsing or whistling sound. The specific type of tinnitus called pulsatile tinnitus is characterized by one hearing the sounds of one's own pulse or muscle contractions, which is typically a result of sounds that have been created from the movement of muscles near to one's ear, changes within the canal of one's ear or issues related to blood flow of the neck or face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ringing-in-the-ears-tinnitus-topic-overview |title=Tinnitus (Ringing in the Ears) Causes, Symptoms, Treatments |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref> Cohort studies have demonstrated damage to hearing (among other [[noise health effects|health effects]]) from unnatural levels of noise exposure is very widespread in industrialized countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Holgers KM, Pettersson B|title=Noise exposure and subjective hearing symptoms among school children in Sweden|journal=Noise & Health|volume=7|issue=27|pages=27–37|year=2005|pmid=16105247|doi=10.4103/1463-1741.31635|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=1463-1741&volume=7&issue=27&spage=27&aulast=Holgers}}</ref>

As with all diagnostics, other potential sources of the sounds normally associated with tinnitus should be ruled out. For instance, two recognized sources of very-high-pitched sounds might be electromagnetic fields common in modern wiring and various sound signal transmissions. A common and often misdiagnosed condition that mimics tinnitus is Radio Frequency (RF) hearing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15340808 |title=Auditory response to pulsed radiofrequency energy |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> in which subjects have been tested and found to hear high-pitched transmission frequencies that sound similar to tinnitus.

==Causes==

===Objective tinnitus===
In some cases, a clinician can perceive an actual sound (''e.g.'', a [[bruit]]) emanating from the patient's ears. This is called '''objective tinnitus'''. Objective tinnitus can arise from muscle spasms that cause clicks or crackling around the middle ear.<ref name="entnet-hearing">{{cite web|url=http://www.entnet.org/HealthInformation/tinnitus.cfm |title=ENT Health Information > Hearing > Tinnitus |publisher=Entnet.org |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> Some people experience a sound that beats in time with the pulse (pulsatile tinnitus, or vascular tinnitus).<ref name="rnid-290661">{{cite web|url=http://www.rnid.org.uk/information_resources/factsheets/tinnitus/factsheets_leaflets/?ciid=290661 |title=Information and resources: Our factsheets and leaflets: Tinnitus: Factsheets and leaflets |publisher=RNID.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> Pulsatile tinnitus is usually objective in nature, resulting from altered blood flow or increased blood turbulence near the ear (such as from [[atherosclerosis]] or venous hum,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Chandler JR|title=Diagnosis and cure of venous hum tinnitus|journal=Laryngoscope|volume=93|issue=7|pages=892–5|year=1983|pmid=6865626|doi=10.1288/00005537-198307000-00009}}</ref>) but it can also arise as a subjective phenomenon from an increased awareness of blood flow in the ear.<ref name="rnid-290661"/> Rarely, pulsatile tinnitus may be a symptom of potentially life-threatening conditions such as [[carotid artery]] [[aneurysm]]<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Moonis G, Hwang CJ, Ahmed T, Weigele JB, Hurst RW|title=Otologic manifestations of petrous carotid aneurysms|journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. |volume=26|issue=6|pages=1324–7|year=2005|pmid=15956490|doi=|url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15956490}}</ref> or [[carotid artery dissection]].<ref name="Carotid Artery Dissection">{{closed access}} {{Cite journal|first1=Magdy |last1=Selim |first2=Louis R. |last2=Caplan |title=Carotid Artery Dissection |journal=Current Treatment Options in Cardiovascular Medicine |issn=1092-8464 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=249–25 3|year=2004 |pmid=15096317 |doi=10.1007/s11936-996-0020-z|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p071820246186700/ |accessdate=1 November 2012}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Pulsatile tinnitus may also indicate [[vasculitis]], or more specifically, [[giant cell arteritis]].

===Subjective tinnitus===
Subjective tinnitus can have many possible causes, but most commonly results from otologic disorders&nbsp;– the same conditions that cause hearing loss. The most common cause is [[noise-induced hearing loss]], resulting from exposure to excessive or loud noises. Tinnitus, along with sudden onset hearing loss, may have no obvious external cause. [[Ototoxicity|Ototoxic]] drugs can cause subjective tinnitus either secondary to hearing loss or without hearing loss and may increase the damage done by exposure to loud noise, even at doses that are not in themselves ototoxic.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Brown RD, Penny JE, Henley CM, ''et al.''|title=Ototoxic drugs and noise|journal=Ciba Found Symp.|volume=85|pages=151–71|year=1981|pmid=7035098}}</ref>

Subjective tinnitus is also a side effect of some medications, such as [[aspirin]], and may also result from an abnormally low level of [[serotonin]] activity. It is also a classical side effect of [[quinidine]], a Class IA anti-arrhythmic. Over 260 medications have been reported to cause tinnitus as a side effect.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stas Bekman: stas (at) stason.org |url=http://stason.org/TULARC/health/body/tinnitus-ringing-ears/6-What-are-some-ototoxic-drugs.html |title=6) What are some ototoxic drugs? |publisher=Stason.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> In many cases, however, no underlying physical cause can be identified.

Tinnitus can also occur due to the discontinuation of therapeutic doses of [[benzodiazepine]]s. It can sometimes be a protracted symptom of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and may persist for many months.<ref name="clinical_manual_of_emergency_psychiatry">{{Cite book|last1=Riba|first1=Michelle B.|last2=Ravindranath|first2=Divy|title=Clinical manual of emergency psychiatry|url=http://books.google.com/?id=l8veL1bDoF8C&pg=PA197|date=12 April 2010|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing Inc|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58562-295-5|page=197}}</ref><ref name="seizures">{{Cite book|last1=Delanty|first1=Norman|title=Seizures: medical causes and management|url=http://books.google.com/?id=u2B3SdfE8-gC&pg=RA1-PA187|date=27 November 2001|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-0-89603-827-1|page=187}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
One of the possible mechanisms relies on [[otoacoustic emissions]]. The [[inner ear]] contains thousands of minute inner hair cells with stereocilia which vibrate in response to sound waves, and outer hair cells which convert neural signals into tension on the vibrating basement membrane. The sensing cells are connected with the vibratory cells through a neural feedback loop, whose gain is regulated by the brain. This loop is normally adjusted just below onset of self-oscillation, which gives the ear spectacular sensitivity and selectivity. If something changes, it is easy for the delicate adjustment to cross the barrier of oscillation, and tinnitus results. Exposure to excessive sound kills hair cells, and studies have shown as hair cells are lost, different neurons are activated, activating auditory parts of the brain and giving the perception of sound.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Another possible mechanism underlying tinnitus is damage to the receptor cells. Although receptor cells can be regenerated from the adjacent supporting [[Deiters cell]]s after injury in birds, reptiles, and amphibians, in mammals it is believed they can be produced only during [[embryogenesis]]. Although mammalian Deiters cells reproduce and position themselves appropriately for regeneration, they have not been observed to [[transdifferentiation|transdifferentiate]] into receptor cells except in tissue culture experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Yamasoba T, Kondo K|title=Supporting cell proliferation after hair cell injury in mature guinea pig cochlea in vivo|journal=Cell Tissue Res.|volume=325|issue=1|pages=23–31|year=2006|pmid=16525832|doi=10.1007/s00441-006-0157-9|url=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=White PM, Doetzlhofer A, Lee YS, Groves AK, Segil N|title=Mammalian cochlear supporting cells can divide and trans-differentiate into hair cells|journal=Nature|volume=441|issue=7096|pages=984–7|year=2006|pmid=16791196|doi=10.1038/nature04849}}</ref> Therefore, if these hairs become damaged, through prolonged exposure to excessive sound levels, for instance, then deafness to certain frequencies results. In tinnitus, they may relay information that an externally audible sound is present at a certain frequency when it is not.

The mechanisms of subjective tinnitus are often obscure. While it is not surprising that direct trauma to the inner ear can cause tinnitus, other apparent causes (e.g., [[temporomandibular joint disorder]] (TMJD or TMD) and dental disorders) are difficult to explain. Research has proposed there are two distinct categories of subjective tinnitus: '''otic''' tinnitus, caused by disorders of the inner ear or the acoustic nerve, and '''somatic''' tinnitus, caused by disorders outside the ear and nerve, but still within the head or neck. It is further hypothesized somatic tinnitus may be due to "central crosstalk" within the brain, as certain head and neck nerves enter the brain near regions known to be involved in hearing.<ref>Engmann, Birk: Ohrgeräusche (Tinnitus): Ein lebenslanges Schicksal? PTA-Forum. Supplement Pharmazeutische Zeitung. 1997 July</ref>

Studies by researchers at the [[University of Western Australia]] suggest tinnitus is caused by increased neural activity in the auditory brainstem where the brain processes sounds, causing some auditory nerve cells to become overexcited. The basis of this theory is most people with tinnitus also have [[hearing loss]],<ref name="Nicolas-Puel"/> and the frequencies they cannot hear are similar to the subjective frequencies of their tinnitus.<ref name="König"/> Models of hearing loss and the brain support the idea a [[homeostatic]] response of central [[dorsal cochlear nucleus]] neurons could result in them being hyperactive in a compensation process to the loss of hearing input.<ref name="Schaette"/> This, in turn, is related to changes in the genes involved in regulating the activity of those nerve cells. This proposed mechanism suggests possible treatments for the condition, involving the normalization or suppression of overactive neural activity through electrical or chemical means.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7959785.stm|title=Tinnitus cure 'is a step closer' |accessdate=2009-03-27 |date=2009-03-25 |publisher=BBC News (news.bbc.co.uk)}}</ref>

While most discussions of tinnitus tend to emphasize physical mechanisms, there is strong evidence that the level of an individual's awareness of her or his tinnitus can be stress-related, and so should be addressed by improving the state of the nervous system generally, using gradual, unobtrusive, long-term treatments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralumun.com/healthtinn.htm|title=Cause of Tinnitus|publisher=Paralumun.com|date=|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref>

Since some tinnitus mimics electronic sounds, some recent research is focusing on electronics, the prolonged use of cell phones,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100719205636.htm|title=Prolonged Mobile Phone Use May Be Linked to Tinnitus|publisher=Science Daily|date=2010-07-19}}</ref> and other modern electronic devices as possible causes.

==Diagnosis==
The basis of quantitatively measuring tinnitus relies on the brain’s tendency to select out only the loudest sounds heard. Based on this tendency, the amplitude of a patient's tinnitus can be measured by playing sample sounds of known amplitude and asking the patient which he hears. The volume of the tinnitus will always be equal to or less than that of the sample noises heard by the patient. This method works very well to gauge objective tinnitus (see above.) For example: if a patient has a pulsatile [[paraganglioma]] in his ear, he will not be able to hear the blood flow through the tumor when the sample noise is 5 decibels louder than the noise produced by the blood. As sound amplitude is gradually decreased, the tinnitus will become audible, and the level at which it does so provides an estimate of the amplitude of the objective tinnitus.

Objective tinnitus, however, is quite uncommon. Often patients with pulsatile tumors will report other coexistent sounds, distinct from the pulsatile noise, that will persist even after their tumor has been removed. This is generally subjective tinnitus, which, unlike the objective form, cannot be tested by comparative methods.

If the attention of a subject is focused on a sample noise, he can often detect it at levels below 5 decibels, which would indicate her tinnitus would be almost impossible to hear {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Conversely, if the same test subject is told to focus only on the tinnitus, he will report hearing the sound even when test noises exceed 70 decibels, making the tinnitus louder than a ringing phone. This quantification method suggests subjective tinnitus relates only to what the patient is attempting to hear {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Whilst it is tempting to assume patients actively complaining about tinnitus have simply become obsessed with the noise, this is only partially true. The noises are often present in both quiet and noisy environments, and can become quite intrusive to their daily lives. The problem is involuntary; generally, complaining patients simply cannot override or ignore their tinnitus.

Subjective tinnitus may not always be correlated with ear malfunction or hearing loss. Even people with near-perfect hearing may still complain of it.

===Measuring tinnitus with auditory evoked response===
Tinnitus is the description of a noise inside a person’s head in the absence of auditory stimulation. The noise can be described in many different ways, but the most common description of the tinnitus is a pure tone sound. Tinnitus affects one third of adults at some time in their lives, whereas ten to fifteen percent are disturbed enough to seek medical evaluation<ref>{{cite journal|author=Heller AJ|title=Classification and epidemiology of tinnitus|journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America|volume=36|issue=2|year=2003|pages=239–248|id=|pmid=12856294|doi=10.1016/S0030-6665(02)00160-3}}</ref> About two million Americans are so seriously disturbed by tinnitus that they cannot function on a day-to-day basis. (American Tinnitus Association, 2010).

Tinnitus can be classified as either subjective or objective. Objective tinnitus can be detected by other people and is usually caused by [[myoclonus]] or a vascular condition. Subjective tinnitus can only heard by the affected person and is caused by [[otology]], neurology, infection, or drugs.<ref name="WMClark">{{cite journal|author=Chan Y|title=Tinnitus: etiology, classification, characteristics, and treatment|journal=Discovery Medicine|volume=8|issue=42|year=2009|pages=133–136|url=http://www.discoverymedicine.com/Yvonne-Chan/2009/10/10/tinnitus-etiology-classification-characteristics-and-treatment/|id=|pmid=19833060}}</ref> A frequent cause of subjective tinnitus is noise exposure which damages hair cells in the inner ear causing tinnitus. Tinnitus can be associated with many emotions. It is best illustrated by Jastreboff’s Neurophysiological model.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pawel J. Jastreboff, Ph.D., Sc.D., M.B.A.|title=Tinnitus &amp; Hyperacusis Center|publisher=[[Emory University]]|url=http://www.tinnitus-pjj.com/|accessdate=2011-11-16}}</ref>

The “Edge Effect” theory has been described by many researchers throughout the literature when discussing tinnitus. As hair cells are lost or damaged, afferent neurons generate auditory sensations at frequencies near the impaired region. This theory possibly explains why tinnitus can be associated with a reflection of hearing loss and why tinnitus can be persistent.

Some researchers believe that [[spontaneous otoacoustic emissions]] (SOAEs) may be associated with tinnitus. Processes in the cochlea can cause self oscillation that is perceived as tinnitus, but most studies found that the two phenomena are not related. The evaluation of SOAEs and tinnitus was based on pitch matching and researchers concluded that not enough evidence could be seen to make the conclusion. When the researchers used two specific criteria to evaluate the results, researchers found SOAEs and tinnitus to be related in 2.42% of subjects.

In 2010, Qasem compared the differences in outer hair cell function in normal hearing patients with and without tinnitus. [[Distortion product otoacoustic emission|Distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs)]] were measured and results showed significant differences between groups at all DPOAE frequencies tested. Researchers concluded that decreased DPOAE amplitude can be seen in tinnitus patients due to the association between tinnitus and reduced outer hair cell movement. This study illustrates that the outer hair cells are related to tinnitus.

''Moller'' studied the effects of tinnitus in relation to compound action potentials (CAP) in 1992. Researchers recorded compound action potential components N1 and N2 and found that the latencies of the responses in the tinnitus patients were similar to patients with no tinnitus. This study concludes that tinnitus effects can not be observed in CAP.
The effects of tinnitus on auditory brainstem response (ABR) measures have also been evaluated by many researchers. Auditory pathway plays a role in the emotional and physiological response to tinnitus. Research has shown abnormal ABR results (interwave latency delays) in patients with tinnitus. In 2008, Kehrle used ABR testing to evaluate the auditory nerve and brainstem function of tinnitus patients with normal hearing. Results showed delayed wave latencies and interpeak latencies between the tinnitus and non tinnitus patients. Researchers concluded that latency prolongations of wave I and lengthening of III-V IPL found in this study confirmed the findings in previous research. Maurizi in 1985 used ABRs to evaluate the auditory pathway in patients with tinnitus and concluded that patients with tinnitus had abnormal ABR recordings. Peripheral tinnitus was reduced with residual inhibition and recordings returned to normal. However, this method is not valid for all tinnitus patients due to the many different causes of tinnitus. Gerken in 2001 evaluated the influence of tinnitus on auditory evoked potentials. Results showed delayed ABR wave VII latencies in the tinnitus group and about half of the tinnitus patients had MLR amplitudes that were significantly greater than the control group mean. Researchers concluded the latency differences for wave VII only adds more diversity to research findings and should be included in future research. Large MLR waves seen in the tinnitus group may be caused by unknown smaller factors not accounted for in the study.

Tinnitus and auditory evoked cortical potentials have also been studied. It is important to evaluate the primary auditory cortex in relation to Jastrebroff’s model. “ALRs reflect stimulus properties as well as attention and the psychological state of the subjects, both of which are presumed to contribute to tinnitus” -Kadner (2002). Low and colleagues in 2008 concluded that ALRs can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of therapies used to alleviate tinnitus.

Tinnitus has also been studied in relation to event related potentials. In 1991, Shiraishi and colleagues found that the contingent negative variation (CNV) amplitude was significantly enlarged in tinnitus patients. They also found no effect on the latency and amplitude of the N100 and P300 responses. Attias in 1993, found that the amplitudes of N1, P2, and P3 were reduced, P3 latencies delayed, and N1 and N2 had delayed latencies to non-target stimuli.

In 2008, Delb conducted a study that evaluated tinnitus patients with high and low tinnitus related distress and how they differ in respect to focus levels on the tinnitus. Researchers concluded that patients with different levels of distress have differences in their ability to shift attention.

Elbert in 2004 studied the relation between tinnitus and mismatched negativity (MMN). Researchers recorded MMN potentials at stimulus levels at the edge frequency of the patient’s tinnitus and found differences in the recordings. This finding can be applied to tinnitus treatments to monitor progress and show effectiveness.

Tinnitus and long latency auditory evoked potentials (LLAEPs) have also been researched quite frequently. Alterations of LLAEPs have been seen in individuals with tinnitus and indicate problems in the auditory pathway in the cortex which can be concluded by increased latency values. In 2010, Santos Filha measured LLAEP potentials of tinnitus patients with a history of noise exposure. Researchers concluded that LLAEP shifts occur more often in individuals with tinnitus when compared to the control group.

In conclusion, tinnitus can be evaluated with most auditory evoked potentials; however results may be inconsistent. Results must be compared to age and hearing matched control subjects to be reliable. This inconsistently reported may be due to many reasons: differences in the origin of the tinnitus, ABR recording methods, and selection criteria of control groups. Since research shows conflicting evidence, more research on the relationship between tinnitus and auditory evoked potentials should be carried out before these measurements are used clinically.

==Prevention==
Tinnitus and hearing loss can be permanent conditions. If a ringing in the ears is audible following lengthy exposure to a source of loud noise, such as a music concert or an industrial workplace, it means lasting damage may have already occurred.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Prolonged exposure to [[Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure and sound pressure levels|sound or noise levels]] as low as 70 [[decibel|dB]] can result in damage to hearing (see [[noise health effects]]). For musicians and [[DJ]]s, special musicians' [[Earplug#Musicians' or 'Hi-Fi' earplugs|earplugs]] play an important role in preventing tinnitus; they can lower the volume of the music without distorting the sound and can prevent tinnitus from developing in later years. For anyone using loud electrical appliances, such as hair dryers or vacuum cleaners, or who work in noisy environments such as building sites, where [[earmuffs]] are impractical, earplugs are also helpful in reducing noise exposure. This is also the case when riding motorcycles, mopeds etc. When operating lawn mowers, hammer drills, grinders, and similar, earmuffs may be more appropriate for hearing protection.

It is also important to check medications for potential [[ototoxicity]]. Ototoxicity of multiple medicines can have a cumulative effect, and can greatly increase the damage done by noise. If ototoxic medications must be administered, close attention by the physician to prescription details, such as dose and dosage interval, can reduce the damage done.<ref name="Garcia et al">{{Closed access}} {{cite journal |last1=García |first1=V.

The typical course of tinnitus involves habituation over time; however, research shows that those seeking treatment tend to display less habituation function than controls.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kropp P, Hartmann M, Barchmann D, Meyer W, Darabaneanu S, Ambrosch P, Gerber, WD|title=Cortical habituation deficit in tinnitus sufferers: Contingent Negative Variation as an indicator of duration of the disease|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|volume=37|issue=3|pages=187–193|year=2012}}</ref> 

Recent psychological research on tinnitus focuses on the Tinnitus Distress Reaction (TDR) to account for differences in tinnitus severity.<ref name="Henry JA, Dennis KC, Schechter MA 2005 1204–1235">{{Cite journal|author=Henry JA, Dennis KC, Schechter MA|title=General review of tinnitus: Prevalence, mechanisms, effects, and management|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|volume=48|pages=1204–1235|year=2005}}</ref> Studies have demonstrated that tinnitus annoyance is more strongly associated with psychological symptoms than acoustic characteristics.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Andersson G|title=Psychological aspects of tinnitus and the application of cognitive-behavioural therapy|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=22|pages=977–9|year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Baguley DM|title=Mechanisms of tinnitus|journal=British Medical Bulletin|volume=63|pages=195–212|year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Henry JA, Meikele MB|title=Pulsed versus continuous tones for evaluating the loudness of tinnitus|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|volume=10|pages=261–272|year=1999}}</ref> Several robust psychological findings have demonstrated comorbidity of psychological complaints of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and concentration difficulties with increased tinnitus severity.<ref name="Henry JA, Dennis KC, Schechter MA 2005 1204–1235"/><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Andersson G|title=Psychological aspects of tinnitus and the application of cognitive-behavioural therapy|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=22|pages=977–979|year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Davies A, Rafie EA|title=Epidemiology of Tinnitus|journal=In R.

Several personality characteristics, such as neuroticism, anxiety sensitivity, and catastrophic thinking predispose increased TDR and maladaptive coping skills.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Henry JA, Wilson P|title=Psychological management of tinnitus|journal=In R.S.

These findings suggest that at the initial perception of tinnitus, conditioning links tinnitus with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time.  This enhances activity in the limbic system and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing tinnitus awareness and annoyance.<ref name="TRT"/>

Misinterpretation of symptoms as threatening and debilitating triggers avoidance and safety behaviours, including sound and social avoidance, which maintain symptoms. This self-perpetuating pattern impairs daily functioning, leading to greater isolation and increased symptom awareness, impedes concentration and prevents engagement in activities that challenge maladaptive beliefs, resulting in a vicious cycle that further decreases cognitive ability to manage symptoms.

Assessment of psychological processes related to tinnitus involves measurement of tinnitus severity and distress (i.e. nature and extent of tinnitus-related problems), measured subjectively by validated self-report tinnitus questionnaires.<ref name="Henry JA, Dennis KC, Schechter MA 2005 1204–1235"/> However, wide variability, inconsistencies and lack of consensus regarding assessment methodology is evidenced in the literature, limiting comparison of treatment effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Landgrebe M, Azevedo A, Baguley D, Bauer C, Cacace A, Coelho C et al.|title=Methodological aspects of clinical trials in tinnitus: A proposal for international standard|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|volume=73|pages=112–121|year=2012}}</ref> Developed to guide diagnosis or classify severity, most tinnitus questionnaires have also been shown to be treatment-sensitive outcome measures.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Martinez-Devesa P, Perera R, Theodoulou M, Waddell A|title=Cognitive behavioural therapy for tinnitus|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Review|volume=CD006371|year=2010}}</ref> The recently developed [[Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)]] is the only measure specifically developed to detect treatment-induced changes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Meikle MB, Henry JA, Griest SE, Stewart BJ, Abrams HB, McArdle R, et al.|title=The tinnitus functional index: Development of a new clinical measure for chronic, intrusive tinnitus|journal=Ear & Hearing|volume=33|pages=153–176|year=2012}}</ref>

In the treatment of tinnitus-related distress, studies have focused on the efficacy of [[cognitive-behavioural therapy]] (CBT), relaxation training, and [[mindfulness]]-based interventions. Two systematic reviews, using stringent inclusion criteria, and meta-analyses have been conducted on studies undertaken between 1995 and 2010.<ref name="Hesser H, Weise C, Zetterquist Westin V, Andersson G 2011 545–553">{{Cite journal|author=Hesser H, Weise C, Zetterquist Westin V, Andersson G|title=A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of cognitive–behavioral therapy for tinnitus distress|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|pages=545–553|year=2011}}</ref><ref name="Hoare D, Kowalkowski V, Knag S, Hall D 2011 15555–15564">{{Cite journal|author=Hoare D, Kowalkowski V, Knag S, Hall D|title=Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management.|journal=The Laryngoscope|volume=1211|pages=15555–15564|year=2011}}</ref> Only cognitive-behavioural studies are numerous enough to perform meta-analysis. Face-to-face therapist-delivered treatments with individual or group formats demonstrate greatest main effects in improving tinnitus-related distress, anxiety and depression. Internet-based CBT interventions provide mixed results, with some studies showing no improvements to anxiety and depression as well as higher attrition rates and smaller main effects than face-to-face treatments.<ref name="Hoare D, Kowalkowski V, Knag S, Hall D 2011 15555–15564"/>

Subsequent randomised controlled trials provide burgeoning support for mindfulness-based interventions. Single session psychoeducation reduces tinnitus-related negative emotions and ruminations, and effects are maintained with mindfulness, but not relaxation training.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Philippot P, Nef F, Clauw L, Romree M, Segal Z|title=A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for treating tinnitus|journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy|volume=19|pages=411–419|year=2012}}</ref> No significant differences in treatment effectiveness were found when eight-week, manualised, Internet-based CBT and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) were compared. Both treatments yielded significant improvements in tinnitus-related stress and impact, as well as in anxiety and depression.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hesser H, Gustafsson T, Lunden C, Henrikson O, Fattahi K, Johnsson E, Westin VZ, Carlingbring P, Maki-Torrko E, Kaldo V|title=A randomized controlled trial of Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy in the treatment of tinnitus|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=80|issue=4|pages=649–661|year=2012}}</ref>
 
Importantly, evidence suggests that CBT may not improve some wider impacts of tinnitus (e.g. social impacts) when these are assessed.<ref name="Hoare D, Kowalkowski V, Knag S, Hall D 2011 15555–15564"/> Manualised treatments, without individual attention to client problems, likely limit the foci and impact of intervention. This underscores the importance of comprehensive individualised biopsychosocial assessments, a multi-disciplinarian approach<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Baguley DM, Davies E, Hazell JWP|title=A vision for tinnitus research|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=42|pages=2–3|year=2003}}</ref> and responsive treatment plans.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Andersson G, Kaldo V|title=Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy for tinnitus|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=60|pages=171–178|year=2004}}</ref>
 
A number of tinnitus-specific CBT treatments have been developed<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Henry J, Zaugg T, Myers P, Kendall C|title=Chapter 9 - Level 5 Individualized Support|journal=Progressive Tinnitus Management Clinical Handbook for Audiologists|url=http://www.ncrar.research.va.gov/Education/Documents/TinnitusDocuments/Index.asp.year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kaldo V, Levin S, Widarsson J, Buhrman M, Larsen H, Andersson G|title=Internet versus group cognitive-behavioral treatment of distress associated with tinnitus: a randomized controlled trial|journal=Behavior Therapy|volume=39|pages=348–359|year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zenner H, Vonthein R, Zenner B, Leuchtweis R, Plontke S, Torka W, Pogge S, Birbaumer N|title=Standardized tinnitus-specific individual cognitive-behavioral therapy: A controlled outcome study with 286 tinnitus patients.|journal=Hearing Research|volume=298|pages=117–125|year=2013}}</ref> with varying degrees of focus on cognitive and behavioural elements.

Components common to most of them include psycho-education, cognitive restructuring, management of avoidance, relaxation training, use of positive or calming imagery, sleep hygiene, sound enrichment and coping strategies.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of tinnitus depends on the type and severity of the cause. For tinnitus due to acute acoustic trauma, approximately 35% of cases report subsiding tinnitus at three months after the trauma, with approximately 10% of these cases being the degree of complete disappearance of the tinnitus, as studied among young men having acquired tinnitus from gunshots.<ref>{{cite pmid|11318462}}</ref>
