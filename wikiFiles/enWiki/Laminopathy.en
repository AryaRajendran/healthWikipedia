'''Laminopathies''' are a group of rare [[genetic disorder]]s caused by [[mutation]]s in genes encoding proteins of the [[nuclear lamina]]. They are included in the more generic term ''nuclear envelopathies'' that was coined in 2000 for diseases associated with defects of the [[nuclear envelope]].<ref name=Nagano>{{cite journal|author= Nagano A, Arahata K | title = Nuclear envelope proteins and associated diseases | journal = Curr. Opin. Neurol. | year = 2000 | volume = 13 |pages=533–9 | pmid = 11073359 | doi = 10.1097/00019052-200010000-00005|issue= 5}}</ref> Since the first reports of laminopathies in the late 1990s, increased research efforts have started to uncover the vital role of nuclear envelope proteins in cell and tissue integrity in animals.

==Symptoms==
Laminopathies and other nuclear envelopathies have a large variety of clinical symptoms including skeletal and/or cardiac [[muscular dystrophy]], [[lipodystrophy]] and [[diabetes]], [[dysplasia]], dermo- or [[neuropathy]], [[leukodystrophy]], and [[progeria]] (premature aging). Most of these symptoms develop after birth, typically during childhood or adolescence. Some laminopathies however may lead to an early death, and mutations of lamin B (LMNB1 gene) may be lethal before or at birth.<ref name=Vergnes>{{cite journal|author= Vergnes L, Peterfy M, Bergo MO, Young SG, Reue K | title = Lamin B1 is required for mouse development and nuclear integrity | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | year = 2004 | volume = 101 |pages=10428–33 | pmid = 15232008 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0401424101|issue= 28|pmc= 478588}}</ref>

==Genetics==
Patients with classical laminopathy have mutations in the gene coding for [[lamin]] A/C ([[LMNA]] gene).

More recently, mutations in [[lamin B]] (LMNB2 gene) or genetic defects leading to changes in lamin B abundance were identified as cause for laminopathies.

Mutations implicated in other nuclear envelopathies were found in genes coding for lamin-binding proteins such as [[lamin B receptor]] (LBR gene), [[emerin]] (EMD gene) and [[LEM domain-containing protein 3]] (LEMD3 gene) and prelamin-processing enzymes such as the [[zinc metalloproteinase STE24]] (ZMPSTE24 gene).

Mutations causing laminopathies include [[Recessive gene|recessive]] as well as [[Dominant gene|dominant]] [[allele]]s with rare ''de novo'' mutations creating dominant alleles that do not allow their carriers to reproduce before death.

The nuclear envelopathy with the highest frequency in human populations is [[Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy]] caused by an [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] mutation in the EMD gene coding for emerin and affecting an estimated 1 in 100,000 people.

==Molecular action==
Lamins are [[intermediate filament]] proteins that form the [[nuclear lamina]] scaffold underneath the [[nuclear envelope]] in animal cells. They are attached to the nuclear envelope membrane via farnesyl anchors and interaction with [[inner nuclear membrane proteins]] such as lamin B receptor and emerin. The nuclear lamina appears to be an adaptation to mobility in animals as sessile organisms such as [[plant]]s or [[Fungus|fungi]] do not have lamins<ref name=Mans>{{cite journal|author= Mans BJ, Anantharaman V, Aravind L, Koonin EV | title = Comparative genomics, evolution and origins of the nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complex | journal = Cell Cycle | year = 2004 | volume = 3 |pages=1612–37 | pmid = 15611647|issue= 12}}</ref> and the symptoms of many laminopathies include [[muscle]] defects. Mutations in these genes might lead to defects in filament assembly and/or attachment to the nuclear envelope and thus jeopardize nuclear envelope stability in physically stressed tissues such as [[muscle fiber]]s, [[bone]], [[skin]] and [[connective tissue]].<ref name=Houben>{{cite journal|author= Houben F, Ramaekers FC, Snoeckx LH, Broers JL | title = Role of nuclear lamina-cytoskeleton interactions in the maintenance of cellular strength | journal = Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1773 |issue=5 |pages=675–86 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17050008 |doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.09.018 }}</ref>

[[Messenger RNA]] produced from the LMNA gene undergoes [[alternative splicing]] and is [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into lamins A and C. Lamin A undergoes [[Prenylation|farnesylation]] to attach a membrane anchor to the protein. This version of the protein is also referred to as prelamin A. Farnesylated prelamin A is further [[Posttranslational modification|processed]] into mature lamin A by a [[metalloproteinase]] removing the last 15 [[amino acid]]s and its farnesylated [[cysteine]]. This allows lamin A to dissociate from the nuclear envelope membrane and fulfill nuclear functions. Mutations causing laminopathies interfere with these processes on different levels.

===Nonsense and missense mutations===
[[Missense mutation]]s in the lamin A/C rod and tail domains are the cause for a wide array of genetic disorders, suggesting that lamin A/C protein contains distinct functional domains that are essential for the maintenance and integrity of different cell lineages. Interaction between lamin A and the nuclear envelope protein emerin appears to be crucial in muscle cells, with certain mutations in lamin mimicking mutations in emerin and causing [[Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy]]. Different mutations lead to dominant-negative and recessive alleles. Mutations in the lamin rod domain leading to mislocalization of both lamin A and emerin occur in patients with [[autosomal dominant]] forms of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy.

Most lamin B mutations appear to be lethal with mutations in lamin B1 causing death at birth in mice.<ref name=Vergnes/> In 2006, lamin B2 missense mutations were identified in patients with acquired partial lipodystrophy.<ref name=Hegele/>

===Splicing defects===
Mutations causing [[progeria]] are defective in [[Splicing (genetics)|splicing]] LMNA mRNA, therefore producing abnormal lamin A protein, also known as ''progerin''. The mutations activate a cryptic splice site within [[exon]] 11 of the gene, thereby causing the deletion of the processing site on prelamin A.<ref name=Eriksson/> This results in an accumulation of progerin that is unable to mature into lamin A, leading to misshapen nuclei. Missplicing also leads to the complete or partial loss of exon 11 and results in a truncated prelamin A protein in the neonatal lethal [[tight skin contracture syndrome]].<ref name=Navarro/>

===Processing defects===
Since the metalloproteinase STE24 is required to process prelamin A into mature lamin A, mutations in this gene abolishing [[protease]] activity cause defects similar to laminopathies caused by prelamin A with truncated processing sites. Symptoms in patients with ZMPSTE24 mutation range from mandibuloacral dysplasia, progeroid appearance, and generalized lipodystrophy to infant-lethal restrictive dermopathy.

===Gene dosage effects===
In the case of [[autosomal dominant]] leukodystrophy, the disease is associated with a duplication of the lamin B gene LMNB1. The exact [[Gene dosage|dosage]] of lamin B in cells appears to be crucial for nuclear integrity as increased expression of lamin B causes a degenerative phenotype in [[Drosophila|fruit flies]] and leads to abnormal nuclear morphology.<ref name=Padiath/>

===Autoimmune antibodies===
Antibodies against lamin B have been implicated in [[autoimmune disease]]s and are possibly involved in [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name=Padiath/>

==Treatment and drug development==
Currently, there is no cure for laminopathies and treatment is largely symptomatic and supportive. [[Physical therapy]] and/or corrective [[orthopedic surgery]] may be helpful for patients with muscular dystrophies. Cardiac problems that occur with some laminopathies may require a [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]. Treatment for neuropathies may include medication for [[seizure]]s and [[spasticity]].

The recent progress in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of toxic progerin formation in laminopathies leading to premature aging has opened up the potential for the development of targeted treatment. The farnesylation of prelamin A and its pathological form progerin is carried out by the enzyme [[farnesyl transferase]]. [[Farnesyl transferase inhibitors]] (FTIs) can be used effectively to reduce symptoms in two mouse model systems for progeria and to revert the abnormal nuclear morphology in progeroid cell cultures. Two oral FTIs, [[lonafarnib]] and [[tipifarnib]], are already in use as anti-tumor medication in humans and may become avenues of treatment for children suffering from laminopathic progeria. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphate drugs used in the treatment of [[osteoporosis]] reduce [[Farnesyl pyrophosphate|farnesyldiphosphate]] production and thus prelamin A farnesylation. Testing of these drugs may prove them to be useful in treating progeria as well. The use of [[antisense]] [[oligonucleotide]]s to inhibit progerin synthesis in affected cells is another avenue of current research into the development of anti-progerin drugs.<ref name=Rusinol>{{cite journal|author= Rusinal AE, Sinensky MS | title = Farnesylated lamins, progeroid syndromes and farnesyl transferase inhibitors | journal = J.
