'''Epidermolysis bullosa''' ('''EB''') is an inherited [[connective tissue disease]] causing [[blisters]] in the [[skin]] and mucosal membranes, with an incidence of 1/50,000. Its severity ranges from mild to lethal. 

The human [[skin]] consist of two layers: an outermost layer called the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and a layer underneath called the [[dermis]]. In individuals with healthy skin, there are protein anchors between these two layers that prevent them from moving independently from one another (shearing). In people born with EB, the two skin layers lack the protein anchors that hold them together, resulting in extremely fragile skin—even only minor mechanical friction (like rubbing or pressure) or trauma will separate the layers of the skin and form blisters and painful sores. Sufferers of EB have compared the sores with third-degree burns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/observer/issues/2004Fall/nonfic/Caroline.html |title=Caroline |accessdate=2008-07-22 |author=Mary E. O'Brien, M.D. |publisher=The Columbia Observer }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Furthermore, as a complication of the chronic skin damage, people suffering from EB have an increased risk of malignancies (cancers) of the skin.  

The condition was brought to public attention in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] through the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off'', chronicling the life and death of [[Jonny Kennedy]], an English man with EB.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-boy-whose-skin-fell-off/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1| title = Series 1 - The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off| accessdate = 2009-02-28| year = 2004| publisher = [[Channel 4]]}}</ref>  In the United States, the same could be said of the HBO documentary [[My Flesh and Blood (film)|My Flesh and Blood]] from 2003.

== Epidemiology ==

An estimated 50 in 1 million live births are diagnosed with EB, and 9 in 1 million sufferers are in the general population. Of these cases, approximately 92% are epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), 5% are dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), 1% are junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), and 2% are unclassified. Carrier frequency ranges from 1 in 333 for JEB, to 1 in 450 for DEB; the carrier frequency for EBS is presumed to be much higher than JEB or DEB.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The disorder occurs in every racial and ethnic group throughout the world and affects both sexes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic124.htm |title=Epidermolysis Bullosa |accessdate=2008-07-22 |author=M Peter Marinkovich, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Dermatology and Program in Epithelial Biology, Stanford University Medical Center |coauthors=Jean Paul Ortonne, MD, Chair, Department of Dermatology, Professor, Hospital L'Archet, Nice University, France; Michael J Wells, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Dermatology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center; Van Perry, MD, Assistant Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Dermatology, University of Texas Health Science Center; Joel M Gelfand, MD, MSCE, Medical Director, Clinical Studies Unit, Assistant Professor, Department of Dermatology, Associate Scholar, Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania; William D James, MD, Paul R Gross Professor of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Vice-Chair, Program Director, Department of Dermatology, University of Pennsylvania Health System |date=December 3, 2007 |work=Bullous Diseases |publisher=emedicine.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v116/n3/full/5601019a.html |title=Epidermolysis Bullosa Carrier Frequencies in the US Population |accessdate=2008-07-22 |author=Ellen Pfendner, Jouni Uitto and Jo-David Fine |date=2000-11-07 |work=Journal of Investigative Dermatology |publisher=nature.com}}</ref>

Current clinical research at the University of Minnesota has included a bone marrow transplant to a 2-year-old child who is one of 2 brothers with EB. The procedure was successful, strongly suggesting that a cure may have been found. A second transplant has also been performed on the child's older brother, and a third transplant is scheduled for a California baby. The clinical trial will ultimately include transplants to 30 subjects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/19471139.html |title=Long-shot stem-cell treatment gives two brothers a future |accessdate=2008-07-22 |author=Josephine Marcotty |date=2008-07-03 |publisher=[[Star Tribune]]}}</ref> However, the severe immunosuppression that bone marrow transplantation requires causes a significant risk of serious infections in patients with large scale blisters and skin erosions. Indeed, at least four patients have died in the course of either preparation for or institution of bone marrow transplantation for epidermolysis bullosa, out of only a small group of patients treated so far.

Recent research has focused on changing the mixture of [[keratin]]s produced in the skin. There are 54 known keratin genes—of which 28 belong to the type I [[intermediate filament]] genes and 26 to type II—which work as [[heterodimer]]s. Many of these genes share substantial structural and functional similarity, but they are specialized to cell type and/or conditions under which they are normally produced. If the balance of production could be shifted away from the mutated, dysfunctional keratin gene toward an intact keratin gene, symptoms could be reduced. For example, [[sulforaphane]], a compound found in [[broccoli]], was found to reduce blistering in a mouse model to the point where affected pups could not be identified visually, when injected into pregnant mice (5 µmol/day = 0.9&nbsp;mg) and applied topically to newborns (1 µmol/day = 0.2&nbsp;mg in [[jojoba oil]]).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0706486104|title=Reprogramming of keratin biosynthesis by sulforaphane restores skin integrity in epidermolysis bullosa simplex|author=Michael Kerns ''et al.''|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.|date=2007-09-04|volume=104|issue=36|pages=14460–14465|pmid=17724334|pmc=1964870}}</ref>
