'''Partial ileal bypass surgery''' is a [[surgery|surgical procedure]] which involves shortening the [[ileum]] to shorten the total [[small intestine|small intestinal]] length.<ref name="pmid2396883">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000658-199009000-00010 |author=Buchwald H, Stoller DK, Campos CT, Matts JP, Varco RL |title=Partial ileal bypass for hypercholesterolemia. 20- to 26-year follow-up of the first 57 consecutive cases |journal=Ann.

First introduced in 1962 by Professor Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buchwald H |title=Lowering of cholesterol absorption and blood levels by ileal exclusion.

The trial ran between 1975 and 1983 and included 838 men who had survived a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. This trial initially failed to show any benefit on mortality, but in 1998 follow-up results indicated that in addition to its known benefit on cholesterol levels and disease events it had also decreased mortality in the treatment group.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buchwald H, Varco RL, Boen JR, ''et al.'' |title=Effective lipid modification by partial ileal bypass reduced long-term coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity: five-year posttrial follow-up report from the POSCH.

Ileal bypass surgery was mainly performed prior to the introduction of effective oral medication for the most common hypercholesterolemias.<ref name=Durrington>{{cite journal |author=Durrington P |title=Dyslipidaemia |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9385 |pages=717–31 |year=2003 |pmid=12957096 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1}}</ref> It is occasionally used in the surgical treatment of [[obesity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buchwald H, Avidor Y, Braunwald E, ''et al.'' |title=Bariatric surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=292 |issue=14 |pages=1724–37 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15479938 |doi=10.1001/jama.292.14.1724 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/292/14/1724}}</ref>

As with any ileal resection, a possible complication is mild [[steatorrhea]] due to a reduced uptake of bile acids by the ileum.
