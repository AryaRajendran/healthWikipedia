'''Euphorbiaceae''', the '''Spurge family''' are a large family of [[flowering plant]]s with 300 genera and around 7,500 species. Most are [[herb]]s, but some, especially in the [[tropics]], are also [[shrub]]s or [[tree]]s. Some are [[succulent]] and resemble [[cactus|cacti]].

This family occurs mainly in the tropics, with the majority of the species in the [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indo-Malayan]] region and tropical [[Americas|America]] a good second. There is a large variety in tropical Africa, but it is not as abundant or varied as in these two other tropical regions. However, ''Euphorbia'' also has many [[species]] in non-tropical areas such as the [[Mediterranean Basin]], the [[Middle East]], [[South Africa]], and southern [[USA]].

The [[Leaf|leaves]] are alternate, seldom opposite, with [[stipule]]s. They are mainly simple, but where compound, are always [[palmate]], never [[pinnate]]. Stipules may be reduced to [[trichome#Plant trichomes|hair]]s, glands, or [[spine (botany)|spine]]s, or in succulent species are sometimes absent.

The radially symmetrical [[flower]]s are unisexual, with the male and the female flowers usually occurring on the same plant. As can be expected from such a large family, there is a wide variety in the structure of the flowers. They can be [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]] or [[Plant sexuality|dioecious]]. The [[stamen]]s (the male organs) can number from 1 to 10 (or even more). The female flowers are [[hypogynous]], that is, with a superior [[ovary (plants)|ovary]].

The genera in tribe [[Euphorbieae]], subtribe [[Euphorbiinae]] (''[[Euphorbia]]'' and close relatives) show a highly specialized form of [[pseudanthium]] ("false flower" made up of several true flowers) called a '''[[cyathium]]'''. This is usually a small cup-like [[Involucral bract|involucre]] consisting of fused together bracts and peripheral nectary glands, surrounding a ring of male flowers, each a single [[stamen]]. In the middle of the cyathium stands a female flower: a single [[Carpel|pistil]] with branched stigmas. This whole arrangement resembles a single flower.

The [[fruit]] is usually a [[schizocarp]], sometimes a [[drupe]]. A typical schizocarp is the '''regma''', a capsular fruit with three or more cells, each of which splits open at maturity into separate parts and then breaks away explosively, scattering the small seeds.

The family contains a large variety of [[phytotoxin]]s (toxic substances produced by plants), mainly [[Terpene|diterpene]] [[ester]]s, [[alkaloid]]s,  [[glycoside]]s, and [[ricin]]-type [[toxin]]s.

A milky [[latex]] is a characteristic of the subfamilies [[Euphorbioideae]] and [[Crotonoideae]].  This latex is [[poison]]ous in the Euphorbioideae, but innocuous in the Crotonoideae {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. '''White mangrove''' (''[[Excoecaria]] agallocha''), or '''Blind-Your-Eye Mangrove''' latex causes blistering on contact and temporary blindness if it contacts the eyes.  Other common names are '''Milky Mangrove''', '''Buta Buta''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]), '''Gewa''' ([[Bengali Language|Bangladesh]]). The latex of [[spurge]] was used as a [[laxative]].

Recent molecular studies have shown that the enigmatic family [[Rafflesiaceae]], which was only recently recognized to belong to order [[Malpighiales]], is derived from within Euphorbiaceae (Davis et al. 2007).

== Uses ==
A number of plants of the Spurge family are of considerable economic importance. Prominent plants include [[Cassava]] (''Manihot esculenta''), [[Castor oil plant]] (''Ricinus communis''), Barbados nut (''[[Jatropha curcas]]''), and the [[Para rubber tree]] (''Hevea brasiliensis'').
Many are grown as [[ornamental plant]]s, such as Poinsettia (''[[Euphorbia pulcherrima]]'').  Leafy spurge (''[[Euphorbia esula]]'') and [[Chinese tallow]] (''Triadica sebifera'') are [[Invasive species|invasive]] weeds in North America.
In medicine, some species of Euphorbiaceae proved effective against genital [[herpes]] (HSV-2).<ref>LA Betancur-Galvis; GE Morales; JE Forero & J Roldan (2002), "[http://www.bioline.org.br/abstract?id=oc02103 Cytotoxic and Antiviral Activities of Colombian Medicinal Plant Extracts of the Euphorbia genus]", ''Mem√≥rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz'', Vol. 97, No. 4, 2002, pp. 541-546.

== Vulnerability ==
Some species, despite their medicinal benefits, are facing the risk of becoming extinct. These species include the ''Euphorbia'' species ''[[Euphorbia appariciana|E.&nbsp;appariciana]]'', ''[[Euphorbia attastoma|E.&nbsp;attastoma]]'', ''[[Euphorbia crossadenia|E.&nbsp;crossadenia]]'' and ''[[Euphorbia gymnoclada|E.&nbsp;gymnoclada]]''.<ref>[http://names.cria.org.br/index?lang=en&genus=Euphorbia&search_cria=true&search_others=true Names.cria.org.br]</ref>
