'''Vesicovaginal fistula''' (VVF) is a subtype of female urogenital [[fistula]] (UGF). 

==Presentation==
VVF is an abnormal fistulous tract extending between the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and the [[vagina]] that allows the continuous involuntary discharge of [[urine]] into the vaginal vault. 

In addition to the medical [[sequelae]] from these fistulas, they often have a profound effect on the patient's emotional well-being. 

==Causes==
It is often caused by childbirth (in which case it is known as an [[obstetric fistula]]), when a prolonged labor presses the unborn child tightly against the pelvis, cutting off blood flow to the vesicovaginal wall.  The affected tissue may [[necrosis|necrotize]] (die), leaving a hole.

Vaginal fistulas can also result from violent rape. This injury has become common in some war zones, where rape is used as a weapon against female civilians. As a result, some health centers in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo have begun to specialize in the surgical repair of vaginal fistulas.

It can also be associated with [[hysterectomy]],<ref name="pmid17962130">{{cite journal |author=Kochakarn W, Pummangura W |title=A new dimension in vesicovaginal fistula management: an 8-year experience at Ramathibodi hospital |journal=Asian J Surg |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=267â€“71 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17962130 |doi= 10.1016/S1015-9584(08)60037-8|url=http://ajws.elsevier.com/ajws_pubmed/pubmed_switch.asp?journal_issn=1015-9584&art_pub_year=2007&%20art_pub_month=10&art_pub_vol=30&art_sp=267}}</ref> and [[cone biopsy]].
