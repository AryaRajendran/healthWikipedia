'''Lordosis'''  is the inward curvature of a portion of the [[lumbar]] and [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]] [[vertebral column]].<ref>Medical Terminology Systems: A Body Systems Approach, 2005</ref> Two segments of the vertebral column, namely cervical and lumbar, are ''normally'' lordotic, that is, they are set in a curve that has its convexity [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|anteriorly]] (the front) and concavity [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|posteriorly]] (behind), in the context of human anatomy. When referring to the anatomy of other mammals, the direction of the curve is termed ''ventral.''  Curvature in the opposite direction, that is, apex posteriorly (humans) or dorsally (mammals) is termed [[kyphosis]]. Excessive or hyperlordosis is commonly referred to as '''swayback''' or '''saddle back''', a term that originates from the similar condition that arises in some horses.

A major factor of lordosis is '''anterior pelvic tilt''', when the pelvis tips forward when resting on top of the femurs.

==Cause==
A consequence of the normal lordotic curvatures of the vertebral column, (also known as ''secondary curvatures'') is that there are differences in thickness between the anterior and posterior part of the [[intervertebral disc]]. Lordosis may also increase at puberty sometimes not becoming evident until the early or mid-20s.  Imbalances in muscle strength and length are also a cause, such as weak [[hamstring]]s, or tight [[hip flexors]] (psoas).

Excessive lordotic curvature is also called '''hyperlordosis''', '''hollow back''', '''saddle back''', and '''swayback'''. Common causes of excessive lordosis include tight [[Human back|low back]] muscles, excessive [[visceral fat]], and pregnancy.  Although lordosis gives an impression of a stronger back, incongruently it can lead to moderate to severe [[lower back]] pain. [[Rickets]], a [[vitamin D]] deficiency in children, can cause [[lumbar]] lordosis.

==Diagnosis==
Measurement and diagnosis of lumbar lordosis can be difficult.  Obliteration of vertebral end-plate landmarks by interbody fusion may make the traditional measurement of segmental lumbar lordosis more difficult. Because the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels are most commonly involved in fusion procedures, or arthrodesis, and contribute to normal lumbar lordosis, it is helpful to identify a reproducible and accurate means of measuring segmental lordosis at these levels.<ref>Thomas C.

==Treatment==
Lordosis of the lower back may be treated by strengthening the hip extensors on the back of the thighs, and by stretching the hip flexors on the front of the thighs.

Too much importance has been attributed to the abdominal muscles in maintaining a neutral spine position{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. They may help by pushing the internal organs against the spine hence alleviating the lumbar curvature but they can't rotate the pelvis backward while in a standing position. Also the lumbar erector spinae is not able to rotate the pelvis forward while standing, hence its strengthening is not to be avoided during lordosis treatment.

Only the muscles on the front and on the back of the thighs can rotate the pelvis forward or backward while in a standing position because they can discharge the force on the ground through the legs and feet. Abdominal muscles and erector spinae can't discharge force on an anchor point while standing, unless one is holding his hands somewhere, hence their function will be to flex or extend the torso, not the hip{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.
Back hyper-extensions on a [[Roman chair]] or inflatable ball will strengthen all the posterior chain and will treat lordosis. So too will stiff legged deadlifts and supine hip lifts and any other similar movement strengthening the posterior chain ''without involving the hip flexors'' in the front of the thighs. Abdominal exercises could be avoided altogether if they stimulate too much the psoas and the other hip flexors.

Strengthening of the hip extensors, which are on the back of the thighs, and optionally stretching of the hip flexors, which are on the front of the thighs, will be enough to treat a lordosis in quite a short time. Anti-inflammatory pain relievers may be taken as directed for short-term relief.  Physical therapy effectively treats 70% of back pain cases due to [[scoliosis]], kyphosis, lordosis, and bad posture.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Hypo-lordosis is more common than hyper-lordosis.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Hypo-lordosis can be corrected non-surgically through rehabilitation exercises.  Many different techniques exist to accomplish this correction. These exercises, if done correctly, may reduce symptoms in those with the typical presentation in 3-6 months. This type of treatment is typically provided by a chiropractor, though some physical therapists offer it as well.<ref>Harrison DD, et al. Spine 2004; 29:2485-2492.</ref>

Controversy regarding the degree to which manipulative therapy can help a patient still exists.  If therapeutic measures reduce symptoms, but not the measurable degree of lordotic curvature, this could be viewed as a successful outcome of treatment, though based solely on subjective data.  The presence of measurable abnormality does not automatically equate with a level of reported symptoms.<ref>Harrison DD, et al. J Manipulative Physiol Ther 1994;17(7):454-464</ref>

==In animals==

{{Seealso|Back (horse)}}
Lordosis is also seen in animals, in particular [[horse]]s and other [[equus (genus)|equines]].  Usually called "swayback," soft back, or low back, it is an undesirable [[equine conformation|conformation]] trait. Swayback is caused in part from a loss of muscle tone in both the back and abdominal muscles, plus a weakening and stretching of the ligaments. As in humans, it may be influenced by bearing young; it is sometimes seen in a [[broodmare]] that has had multiple foals.  However, it is also common in older horses whose age leads to loss of muscle tone and stretched ligaments. It also occurs due to overuse or injury to the muscles and ligaments from excess work or loads, or from premature [[working animal|work]] placed upon an immature animal. Equines with too long a [[back (horse)|back]] are more prone to the condition than those with a short back, but as a longer back is also linked to smoother [[horse gait|gaits]], the trait is sometimes encouraged by [[selective breeding]].  It has been found to have a hereditary basis in the [[American Saddlebred]] breed, transmitted via a [[Dominance relationship|recessive mode]] of inheritance. Research into the genetics underlying the condition has several values beyond just the Saddlebred breed as it may "serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species."<ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=17422 Oke, Stacey. "Genetics of Swayback in Saddlebred Horses Examined"  ''The Horse'' online edition, December 20, 2010. Accessed December 21, 2010]</ref><!--cite covers heretidary piece-->

==Other==
[[Lordosis behavior]] refers to the position that some mammalian females (including cats, mice, and rats) display when they are ready to mate ("in heat"). The term is also used to describe mounting behavior in mammalian males.

In [[radiology]], a lordotic view is an X-ray taken of a patient leaning backwards.<ref>http://www.wikiradiography.com/page/Lordotic+Chest+Technique</ref>

Lordosis in the [[human vertebral column|human spine]] makes it easier for humans to bring the bulk of their mass over the [[pelvis]]. This allows for a much more efficient [[walking]] gait than that of non-human [[primates]], whose inflexible spines cause them to resort to an inefficient forward leaning "bent-knee, bent-waist" gait. As such, lordosis in the human spine is considered one of the primary physiological adaptations of the human skeleton that allows for human gait to be as energetically efficient as it is. <ref>http://www.algoless.com/pdf/human_gait.pdf</ref>
