The '''2009 flu pandemic in South America''' was part of a global [[epidemic]] in 2009 of a new strain of [[influenza A virus subtype H1N1]], causing what has been commonly called [[swine influenza|swine flu]]. As of June 9, 2009, the virus had afflicted at least 2,000 [[human|people]] in [[South America]], with at least 4 confirmed [[death]]s.  On 3 May 2009, the first case of the flu in South America was confirmed in a [[Colombia]]n man who recently travelled from [[Mexico]] -- since then, it has spread throughout the continent.  By far, the most affected country has been [[Chile]], with more than 12,000 confirmed cases, 104 deaths, and the highest per capita incidence in the world.

The [[World Health Organization]] warned about the arrival of the [[winter]] in the [[southern hemisphere]], where there are seasonal peaks of flu, that could increase the number of infections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/1218316/05/09/OMS-pide-seguir-atentos-a-gripe-porcina-y-alerta-de-llegada-a-hemisferio-sur.html|title=OMS pide seguir atentos a gripe porcina y alerta de llegada a hemisferio sur|date=2009-05-05|work=El Economista|language=Spanish| accessdate= 7 July 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090601075832/http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/1218316/05/09/OMS-pide-seguir-atentos-a-gripe-porcina-y-alerta-de-llegada-a-hemisferio-sur.html| archivedate= 1 June 2009| deadurl= no}}</ref>
