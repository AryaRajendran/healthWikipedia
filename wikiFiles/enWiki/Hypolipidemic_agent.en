'''Hypolipidemic agents''', or '''antihyperlipidemic agents''', are a diverse group of [[pharmacology|pharmaceuticals]] that are used in the treatment of [[hyperlipidemia]]s. They are called '''lipid-lowering drugs''' (LLD) or agents.

== Classes of hypolipidemic drugs ==

There are several classes of hypolipidemic drugs. They may differ in both their impact on the [[cholesterol]] profile and adverse effects. For example, some may lower the "bad cholesterol" [[low density lipoprotein]] (LDL) more so than others, while others may preferentially increase [[high density lipoprotein]] (HDL), "the good cholesterol". Clinically, the choice of an agent will depend on the patient's [[cholesterol|cholesterol profile]], [http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp?usertype=prof cardiovascular risk], and the [[Liver function test|liver]] and [[Creatinine clearance|kidney]] functions of the patient, evaluated against the balancing of risks and benefits of the medications. In the United States, this is guided by the [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] guideline from the [[National Cholesterol Education Program]] (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII).

===Established===
* [[statin]]s are particularly well-suited for lowering LDL, the cholesterol with the strongest links to vascular diseases. In studies using standard doses, statins have been found to lower LDL-C by 18% to 55%, depending on the specific statin being used. There is a risk of severe muscle damage ([[myopathy]] & [[rhabdomyolysis]]) with statins.
* [[fibrate]]s are indicated for [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. Fibrates typically lower triglycerides by 20% to 50%. Level of the good cholesterol HDL is also increased. Fibrates may decrease LDL, though generally to a lesser degree than statins. Similar to statins, there is a risk of severe muscle damage ([[myopathy]] & [[rhabdomyolysis]]) with fibrates.
* [[niacin]], like fibrates, is also well-suited for lowering triglycerides by 20–50%. It may also lower LDL by 5–25% and increase HDL by 15–35%. Niacin may cause [[hyperglycemia]], and may also cause [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]. The niacin derivative [[acipimox]] is also associated with a modest decrease in LDL.
* [[bile acid sequestrant]]s (resins) are particularly effective for lowering LDL-C by sequestering the cholesterol-containing bile acids released into the intestine and preventing their reabsorption from the intestine. It decreases LDL by 15–30% and raises HDL by 3–5%. It has little effect on triglycerides but can cause a slight increase. Bile acid sequestrants may cause gastrointestinal problems, and may also reduce the absorption of other drugs and vitamins from the gut.
* [[ezetimibe]] (Zetia) is a selective inhibitor of dietary cholesterol absorption.
* [[lomitapide]] (Juxtapid) is a [[microsomal triglyceride transfer protein]] (MTP) inhibitor.
* [[phytosterol]]s may be found naturally in plants. Similar to ezetimibe, phytosterols reduce the absorption of cholesterol in the gut. Hence, they are most effective when consumed with meals. However, the precise mechanism of action of phytosterols differs from ezetimibe.
* [[orlistat]] (Xenical): Its primary function is to prevent the absorption of about 30% of fats from the human diet; thereby reducing caloric intake (a drug designed to treat [[obesity]]) is by inhibiting [[Pancreatic lipase]]- an enzyme that breaks down [[triglycerides]] in the intestine.

===Investigational===
Investigational classes of hypolipidemic agents:
* [[CETP inhibitors]] (cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors) are still under development. It is expected that these drugs will mainly increase HDL while lowering LDL;
* [[Squalene synthase inhibitor]];
* [[ApoA-1 Milano]];
* [[AGI-1067]];
* [[Mipomersen]] (completed 4 phase III trials — approved by the FDA in January 2013 for the treatment of homozygous [[familial hypercholesterolemia]].<ref>Pollack, Andrew (29 January 2013) [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/business/fda-approves-genetic-drug-to-treat-rare-disease.html F.D.A.
