'''Gray baby syndrome''' (also termed '''Gray''' or '''Grey syndrome''') is a rare but serious side effect that occurs in newborn infants (especially premature babies) following the intravenous administration of the antimicrobial [[chloramphenicol]].<ref name=McIntyre_2004>{{cite journal | author = McIntyre J, Choonara I | title = Drug toxicity in the neonate. | journal = Biol Neonate | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–21 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15249753 | doi = 10.1159/000079656}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Two pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to play a role in the development of gray baby syndrome after  exposure to the anti-microbial drug chloramphenicol.  This condition is due to a lack of glucuronidation reactions occurring in the baby, thus leading to an accumulation of toxic chloramphenicol metabolites. :<ref>{{cite book |title= Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics |last= Brunton |first= Laurence L.

# The [[UDP-glucuronyl transferase]] enzyme system of infants, especially premature infants, is immature and incapable of metabolizing the excessive drug load.
# Insufficient renal excretion of the unconjugated drug.

==Clinical features==
Toxic levels of [[chloramphenicol]] after 2–9 days result in:
* Vomiting
* Ashen gray color of the skin
* Limp body tone
* [[Hypotension]] (low blood pressure)
* [[Cyanosis]] blue discolouration of lips and skin.
* [[Hypothermia]]
* [[Cardiogenic shock|Cardiovascular collapse]]

==Treatment==
[[Chloramphenicol]] therapy is discontinued immediately; [[exchange transfusion]] may be required to remove the drug. Sometimes, phenobarbital (UGT induction) is used.

==Prevention==
The condition can be prevented by using chloramphenicol at the recommended doses and monitoring blood levels,<!--
