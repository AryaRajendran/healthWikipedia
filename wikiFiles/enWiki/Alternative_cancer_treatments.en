[[File:Orgone Energy Accumulator (right-angle, open).JPG|thumb |upright|This [[orgone accumulator]] is one of many disproven or fraudulent alternative cancer treatments that have been promoted during the last century.]]
'''Alternative cancer treatments''' describes [[Alternative medicine|alternative and complementary treatments]] for cancer that have not been approved by the government agencies responsible for the [[regulation of therapeutic goods]].  They include diet and exercise, chemicals, herbs, devices, and manual procedures. The treatments may be untested or unsupported by [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]], either because no proper testing has been conducted, or because testing did not demonstrate [[statistically significant]] efficacy.  Concerns have been raised about the safety of some of them. 

Alternative cancer treatments are typically contrasted with [[experimental cancer treatment]]s, which are treatments for which experimental testing is currently underway.  All currently approved [[chemotherapeutic]] cancer treatments were considered experimental cancer treatments before their safety and efficacy testing was completed. 

Such therapies can be categorized broadly into three groups: alternative treatments offered as a substitute to standard medical treatment; alternative treatments as an addition to standard treatment; and treatments proposed in the past that have been found in clinical trials to be useless and/or unsafe.  Some of these obsolete or disproven treatments continue to be promoted, sold, and used.

Since the 1940s, medical science has [[history of cancer chemotherapy|developed chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], [[adjuvant therapy]] and the newer [[targeted therapies]], as well as refining [[oncosurgery|surgical techniques]] for removing cancer.  Before the development of these modern, [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based treatments]], 90% of cancer patients died within five years.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2268104/ |title=Who's a Survivor? |author= Schattner,  Elaine |journal=Slate Magazine |date=5 October 2010}}</ref>  With modern mainstream treatments, only 34% of cancer patients die within five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html#survival |title=Cancer of All Sites - SEER Stat Fact Sheets |accessdate=6 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100926191037/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/all.html| archivedate= 26 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  However, while mainstream forms of cancer treatment generally prolong life or permanently cure cancer, most treatments also have side effects ranging from unpleasant to fatal, such as pain, blood clots, fatigue, and infection,<ref name=Complications>{{cite web|last=McMillen|first=Matt|title=8 Common Surgery Complications|url=http://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/common-surgery-complications|work=WebMD Feature|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=3/31/13}}</ref> These side effects and the lack of a guarantee that treatment will be successful create appeal for alternative treatments for cancer, which purport to cause fewer side effects or to increase survival rates.

Alternative cancer treatments have typically not undergone properly conducted, well-designed clinical trials, or the results have not been published due to [[publication bias]] (a refusal to publish results showing a treatment does not work).  Among those that have been published, the methodology is often poor.  A 2006 systematic review of 214 articles covering 198 clinical trials of alternative cancer treatments concluded that almost none conducted [[dose-ranging]] studies, which are necessary to ensure that the patients are being given a useful amount of the treatment.<ref name=Vickers2006>{{cite journal |author=Vickers AJ, Kuo J, Cassileth BR |title=Unconventional anticancer agents: a systematic review of clinical trials |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=136–40 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16382123 |pmc=1472241 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2005.03.8406}}</ref>  These kinds of treatments appear and vanish frequently, and have throughout history.<ref name=Cassileth1996/>

== Complementary versus alternative treatments ==

Complementary and alternative cancer treatments are often grouped together, but this grouping is controversial.<ref name=Cassileth1996/> Definitions vary, but generally speaking, the same methods that are called "complementary" when given alongside mainstream treatments are "alternative" when they are not.<ref name="whccamp.hhs.gov">{{cite web |title=White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy |url=http://whccamp.hhs.gov/fr2.html |chapter=Overview of CAM in the United States: Recent History, Current Status, And Prospects for the Future |date=March 2002}}</ref> Thus it is not the specific treatment, per se, that is actually "complementary" or "alternative", but the context in which it is used.  Complementary therapies receive more support within the mainstream medical community than alternative treatments.

Complementary treatments are used in conjunction with [[evidence-based medicine|proven]] mainstream treatments. They tend to be pleasant for the patient, not involve substances with any pharmacological effects, inexpensive, and intended to treat side effects rather than to kill cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wesa KM, Cassileth BR |title=Is there a role for complementary therapy in the management of leukemia? |journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=1241–9 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19761428 |pmc=2792198 |doi=10.1586/era.09.100 }}</ref>  [[Medical massage]] and [[self-hypnosis]] to treat pain are examples of complementary treatments.  

Alternative treatments, by contrast, are used in place of mainstream treatments. The most popular alternative cancer therapies are various, generally strict diets, including the [[macrobiotic]] diet.  Other therapies include [[mind-body intervention]]s, [[bioelectromagnetic]]s, [[nutritional supplement]]s, and [[herbology|herbs]]<ref name=Cassileth1996/> ([[Anticancer plants]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cragg J M, Newman D J| title = Plants as a source of anticancer agents | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology| year = 2005 |  PMID = 16009521 | url = http://www.uesc.br/cursos/pos_graduacao/mestrado/animal/bibliografias/roueda/artigo3.pdf | volume =  | pages = 72–79}}</ref>). The popularity and prevalence of different treatments varies widely by region.<ref name=Cassileth2001>{{cite journal |author=Cassileth BR, Schraub S, Robinson E, Vickers A |title=Alternative medicine use worldwide: the International Union Against Cancer survey |journal=Cancer |volume=91 |issue=7 |pages=1390–3 |year=2001 |month=April |pmid=11283941 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(20010401)91:7<1390::AID-CNCR1143>3.0.CO;2-C}}</ref>

Due to the poor quality of most studies of complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of cancer pain, it is not possible to recommend these therapies for the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis, supportive psychotherapy and cognitive therapy; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some cancer patients. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.<ref name = Induru>{{vcite journal |author=Induru RR, Lagman RL |title=Managing cancer pain: frequently asked questions |journal=Cleve Clin J Med |volume=78 |issue=7 |pages=449–64 |year=2011 |month=July |pmid=21724928 |doi=10.3949/ccjm.78a.10054 |url=http://www.ccjm.org/content/78/7/449.long }}</ref>

==People who choose alternative treatments==
People who choose alternative treatments tend to believe that evidence-based medicine is ineffective, while still believing that their own health could be improved.<ref name="pmid8071452">{{cite journal |author=Furnham A, Forey J |title=The attitudes, behaviors and beliefs of patients of conventional vs. complementary (alternative) medicine |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=458–69 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=8071452 |doi=10.1002/1097-4679(199405)50:3<458::AID-JCLP2270500318>3.0.CO;2-V }}</ref>  They are impressed by [[physiological]] and other scientific-sounding information, prefer a healthcare model that promises to treat the patient as an integrated, whole person, and are [[loyalty|loyal]] to their alternative healthcare providers.<ref name="pmid8071452" />

Cancer patients who choose complementary or alternative treatments in addition to conventional treatments believe themselves less likely to die than patients who choose only conventional treatments.<ref name="pmid16504038">{{cite journal |author=Helyer LK, Chin S, Chui BK, ''et al.'' |title=The use of complementary and alternative medicines among patients with locally advanced breast cancer--a descriptive study |journal=BMC Cancer |volume=6|pages=39 |year=2006 |pmid=16504038 |pmc=1475605 |doi=10.1186/1471-2407-6-39 |url=}}</ref>  They feel a greater sense of control over their destinies, and report less anxiety and depression.<ref name="pmid16504038" />

However, patients who use alternative treatments have a poorer survival time, even after controlling for type and stage of disease.<ref name=Vickers />  The reason that patients using alternative treatments die sooner may be because patients who accurately perceive that they are likely to survive do not attempt unproven remedies, and patients who accurately perceive that they are unlikely to survive are attracted to unproven remedies.<ref name=Vickers />  Among patients who believe their condition to be untreatable by evidence-based medicine, "desperation drives them into the hands of anyone with a promise and a smile."<ref>{{cite book |author=Olson, James Stuart |title=Bathsheba's breast: women, cancer & history |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 |pages=146 |isbn=0-8018-6936-6 }}</ref>  [[Con artist]]s have long exploited fear, ignorance, and desperation to strip dying people of their money, comfort, and dignity.

About half the practitioners who dispense complementary or alternative treatments are physicians, although they tend to be generalists rather than [[oncologist]]s. As many as 60% of physicians have referred their patients to a complementary or alternative practitioner for some purpose.<ref name=Cassileth1996>{{cite journal |author=Cassileth BR |title=Alternative and Complementary Cancer Treatments |journal=The Oncologist |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=173–179 |year=1996 |pmid=10387984 |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10387984}}</ref>

==Examples of alternative treatment==
None of the cancer treatments on this list have substantial evidence for their effectiveness in treating cancer. Some have shown some benefits as complementary therapy, to reduce pain. Very few suppliers of alternative medicines have undertaken scientifically controlled [[clinical trials]] for their products, although occasional preliminary testing, or testing as adjuvant therapy, has been performed.  For this reason, alternative therapies generally rely on testimonial or [[anecdotal evidence]]. In the United States, FDA regulations forbid the makers of unproven products from claiming efficacy against cancer.

==Alternative theories of cancer==
Some alternative cancer treatments are based on unproven or disproven theories of how cancer begins or is sustained in the body.  Some common concepts are:

* '''Mind-body connection''':  This idea says that cancer forms because of, or can be controlled through, the person's mental and emotional state.  Treatments based on this idea are [[mind–body intervention]]s.  Proponents say that cancer forms because the person is unhappy or stressed, or that a positive attitude can cure cancer after it has formed.  A typical claim is that stress, anger, fear, or sadness depresses the immune system, whereas that love, forgiveness, confidence, and happiness cause the immune system to improve, and that this improved immune system will destroy the cancer.  This belief that generally boosting the immune system's activity will kill the cancer cells is not supported by any scientific research.<ref name=Thyphronitis>{{cite journal

* '''Toxin theory of cancer''':  In this idea, the body's metabolic processes are overwhelmed by normal, everyday byproducts.  These byproducts, called "toxins", are said to build up in the cells and cause cancer and other diseases through a process sometimes called ''[[wikt:autointoxication|autointoxication]]'' or ''autotoxemia''.  Treatments following this approach are usually aimed at [[detoxification]] or [[body cleansing]], such as [[enema]]s.
* '''Low activity by the immune system''':  This claim asserts that if only the body's [[immune system]] were strong enough, it would kill the "invading" or "foreign" cancer.  Unfortunately, most cancer cells retain normal cell characteristics, making them appear to the immune system to be a normal part of the body.  Cancerous tumors also actively induce [[immune tolerance]], which prevents the immune system from attacking them.<ref name=Thyphronitis />  These treatments often focus on substance said to increase the immune system's activity.
* '''Supposed situations within the body''':  In this idea, the body is incapable of coping with transient or local differences.  For example, proponents will say that a transient lack of oxygen in a small area of the body causes cancer, or that clothing prevents normal circulation and thereby causes cancer.
* '''Hypothetical microorganisms''':  While infections are a significant cause of certain kinds of cancer (e.g., [[Hepatitis B]] can cause [[liver cancer]], and some [[human papillomavirus]]es cause [[cervical cancer]]), these stories usually assert that the harmless bacteria and fungi normally present in or on the body cause cancer, or that organisms only detectable by the proponent cause cancer.

==Regulatory action==
Government agencies around the world routinely investigate purported alternative cancer treatments in an effort to protect their citizens from fraud and abuse.

In 2008, the [[United States Federal Trade Commission]] acted against companies that made unsupported claims that their products, some of which included highly toxic chemicals, could cure cancer.<ref>{{cite press release
