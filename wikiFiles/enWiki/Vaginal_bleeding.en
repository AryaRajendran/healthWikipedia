'''Vaginal bleeding''' refers to bleeding through the [[vagina]], including bleeding from the vaginal wall itself as well as (and more commonly) bleeding from another location of the [[female reproductive system]]. Generally, it is either a physiologic response during the non-conceptional [[menstrual cycle]] or caused by hormonal or organic problems of the [[reproductive system]]. Vaginal bleeding may occur at any age, but always needs investigation when encountered in female children or postmenopausal women. Vaginal bleeding during [[pregnancy]] may indicate a possible pregnancy complication that needs to be medically addressed. 

Blood loss ''per vaginam'' ([[Latin]]: through the [[vagina]]) (PV) typically arises from the lining of the uterus ([[endometrium]]), but may arise from [[uterus|uterine]] or [[cervix|cervical]] lesions, the [[vagina]], and rarely from the [[Fallopian tube]]. During [[pregnancy]] it is usually but not always related to the pregnancy itself. Rarely, the blood may actually arise from the [[urinary tract]] ([[hematuria]]), although the vast majority of women can identify the difference. It can also be a sign of vaginal cancer.

== Differential diagnosis ==
=== Bleeding in children ===
Bleeding before the expected time of [[menarche]] could be a sign of [[precocious puberty]]. Other possible causes include the presence of a [[foreign body]] in the vagina, [[molestation]], vaginal infection ([[vaginitis]]), and rarely, a tumor.

=== Premenopausal women ===
* [[Menstruation]]. Exceptionally heavy bleeding during periods is termed ''[[menorrhagia]]'' or ''hypermenorrhea'', while light bleeding is called ''hypomenorrhea''.
* [[Breakthrough bleeding]] in women on [[combined oral contraceptive]]s
*''Withdrawal bleeding'' which can occur upon discontinuation of hormonal stimulation. Withdrawal bleeding is generally regarded as a normal physiological response.<ref name=Farlex-withdrawal-bleeding>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/withdrawal+bleeding Farlex Medical Dictionary > Withdrawal Bleeding], in turn citing Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition</ref>

* If bleeding occurs between periods, this is not necessarily pathological, but it is termed ''intermenstrual bleeding''. If no period can be identified due to the unpredictable bleeding, [[metrorrhagia]] is used.
* [[Dysfunctional uterine bleeding]] is a common cause of menorrhagia and irregular bleeding. It is due to a hormonal imbalance, and symptoms can be managed by use of [[hormonal contraception]] (although hormonal contraception does not treat the underlying cause of the imbalance). If it is due to [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], weight loss may help, and infertility may respond to [[clomifene citrate]].
* [[Uterine fibroid]]s (leiomyoma) are benign [[tumor]]s of the [[uterus]].
* [[Cervical cancer]] may occur at premenopausal age, and often presents with "contact bleeding" (e.g. after sexual intercourse)
* [[Uterine cancer]] will lead to irregular and often prolonged bleeding.
* In recently [[pregnant]] women who have been delivered of a baby or who have had a miscarriage, vaginal bleeding may be a sign of [[endometritis]] or [[retained products of conception]].

=== Pregnant women ===
Vaginal bleeding occurs during 15-25% of first trimester [[Pregnancy|pregnancies]].<ref name=Preg09>{{cite journal|last=Snell|first=BJ|title=Assessment and management of bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy.|journal=Journal of midwifery & women's health|date=2009 Nov-Dec|volume=54|issue=6|pages=483â€“91|pmid=19879521|doi=10.1016/j.jmwh.2009.08.007}}</ref> Of these, half go on to [[miscarriage|miscarry]] and half bring the fetus to term.<ref name=Preg09/> There are a number of causes including rupture of a small vein on the outer rim of the [[placenta]]. It can also herald a [[miscarriage]] or [[ectopic pregnancy]], which is why urgent [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] is required to separate the two causes. Bleeding in early pregnancy may be a sign of a [[threatened miscarriage|threatened]] or [[incomplete miscarriage|incomplete]] miscarriage.

In the second or third trimester a [[placenta previa]] (a placenta partially or completely overlying the cervix) may bleed quite severely. [[Placental abruption]] is often associated with uterine bleeding as well as uterine pain.

=== Postmenopausal women ===
All vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal women should be medically assessed. The [[differential diagnosis]] is:{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}
* 30% unopposed estrogen
* 30% atrophic endometritis / vaginitis
* 15% [[endometrial cancer]]
* 10% endometrial polyps or cervical polyps
* 5% endometrial hyperplasia
* 10% other

== Diagnostic approach ==
The diagnosis can often be made on the basis of the bleeding history, physical examination, and other medical tests as appropriate. Typically a [[pregnancy test]] and additional hormonal tests, a [[Pap smear]], a [[transvaginal ultrasound]] are needed. If bleeding was excessive or prolonged, a CBC may be useful to check for [[anemia]]. Abnormal endometrium may have to be investigated by a [[hysteroscopy]] with a [[biopsy]] or a [[dilation and curettage]].

The treatment will be directed at the cause. Hormonal bleeding problems during the reproductive years, if bothersome to the woman, are frequently managed by use of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s.

== Complications ==
Severe acute bleeding, such as caused by ectopic pregnancy and post-partum hemorrhage, leads to [[hypovolemia]] (the depletion of blood from the circulation), progressing to [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. This is a [[medical emergency]] and requires hospital attendance and [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]], usually followed by [[blood transfusion]]. Once the circulating volume has been restored, investigations are performed to identify the source of bleeding and address it. Uncontrolled life-threatening bleeding may require [[Uterine artery embolization]] (occlusion of the blood vessels supplying the uterus), [[laparotomy]] (surgical opening of the abdomen), occasionally leading to [[hysterectomy]] (removal of the uterus) as a last resort.

A possible complication from protracted vaginal blood loss is [[iron deficiency anemia]], which can develop insidiously. Eliminating the cause will resolve the anemia, although some women require [[iron]] supplements or [[blood transfusion]]s to improve the anemia.
