'''Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis''' ('''MBL''') is a condition that resembles [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL) but does not meet the critera for CLL, and does not require treatment. However, CLL requiring treatment develops at the rate of 1.1% per year.<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/359/6/575 Rawstron, N Engl J Med 359:575]</ref><ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/578801 Monoclonal B-Cell Lymphocytosis Progresses to Leukemia in Some Patients], Roxanne Nelson, Medscape Medical News, Aug. 7, 2008</ref>

The definition of CLL includes >5000 CLL-phenotype [[B-cell]] [[lymphocytes]] per cubic millimeter. Patients with <5000 lymphocytes per mm³ and no symptoms of CLL are diagnosed with MBL. 

The term [[Clone (B-cell biology)|monoclonal]] means that all the B cells are derived from a single cell. 

==Causes==
Little is yet known about the causes of MBL, but as it is a ''[[forme fruste]]'' of CLL the etiologies of these two conditions would be closely related. Genetic changes that can be found in CLL have also been found in MBL, and relatives of people with CLL have a much higher chance of having MBL (13% of first-degree relatives in one study).<ref name="pmid18021084">{{cite journal |author=Marti G, Abbasi F, Raveche E, Rawstron AC, Ghia P, Aurran T, Caporaso N, Shim YK, Vogt RF |title=Overview of monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis |journal=Br.

One concern about MBL is related to [[blood transfusion]]s. MBL was found in 0.14% of blood donors in one study. It is unknown whether blood transfusion can transmit MBL.<ref name="pmid17961190"/>

==Laboratory diagnosis==
Using [[flow cytometry]], monoclonal cells with [[cell surface marker]]s similar to those in CLL can be detected in some healthy adults, who do not meet the criteria for CLL (i.e., >5000 CLL-type lymphocytes per mm³).<ref name="pmid18216293">{{cite journal |author=Hallek M, Cheson BD, Catovsky D, ''et al.'' |title=Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a report from the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia updating the National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 guidelines |journal=Blood |volume=111 |issue=12 |pages=5446–56 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18216293 |pmc=2972576 |doi=10.1182/blood-2007-06-093906 |url=}}</ref> If the diagnosis of CLL is based on the B cell count rather than the [[total lymphocyte count]] (which includes both B and [[T cells]]), many patients formerly diagnosed with Rai Stage 0 CLL would instead be classified as having MBL.<ref name="pmid19213686"/>
Molecular techniques can detect monoclonal B cell levels as low as 3-5 B cells/microliter (comparable to the amount of [[Peripheral blood stem cell|stem cells in peripheral blood]]).<ref name="pmid18021084"/>
The term "monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis" was proposed by a consensus committee in 2005 to indicate a monoclonal B cell population in a person with less than 5000 B lymphocytes per [[milliliter]] (or 5.0 x 10<sup>9</sup> B lymphocytes/L), no [[Lymphadenopathy|enlarged lymph nodes]] or [[hepatosplenomegaly|enlarged liver and/or spleen]] or other indications of a lymphoproliferative disorder.<ref name="pmid16042682">{{cite journal |author=Marti GE, Rawstron AC, Ghia P, ''et al.'' |title=Diagnostic criteria for monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis |journal=Br.

==Epidemiology and prognosis==
MBL has been found in less than 1% of [[asymptomatic]] adults under age 40, and in around 5% of adults older than 60.<ref name="pmid16042682"/> Exact numbers depend on the population studied and the sensitivity of the diagnostic technique.<ref name="pmid17961190">{{cite journal |author=Rachel JM, Zucker ML, Fox CM, Plapp FV, Menitove JE, Abbasi F, Marti GE |title=Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in blood donors |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=139 |issue=5 |pages=832–6 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17961190 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06870.x |url=}}</ref>
Like CLL, it appears to be more common in males.<ref name="pmid17961190"/>
It is also a common finding among older adults with unexplained [[lymphocytosis]].<ref name="pmid18687638">{{cite journal |author=Rawstron AC, Bennett FL, O'Connor SJ, Kwok M, Fenton JA, Plummer M, de Tute R, Owen RG, Richards SJ, Jack AS, Hillmen P |title=Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=6 |pages=575–83 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18687638 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa075290 |url=}}</ref>

Recent studies suggest that CLL is very often preceded by MBL,<ref name="pmid19213679">{{cite journal |author=Landgren O, Albitar M, Ma W, ''et al.'' |title=B-Cell Clones as Early Markers for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=360 |issue=7 |pages=659–667 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19213679 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa0806122|url=}}</ref>
and that MBL progresses to CLL requiring treatment at a rate of around 1-2% per year.<ref name="pmid16042682"/> Advancing age and high initial B cell count predispose to progression from MBL to CLL; however, only a small fraction of people with MBL die because of CLL.<ref name="pmid18687638"/>

Thus, MBL could be regarded as a [[premalignant condition]] from which some cases progress to CLL (much similar to the progression of some cases of [[monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance]] to [[multiple myeloma]]).<ref name="pmid19213686">{{cite journal |author=Vogt RF, Kyle RA |title=The Secret Lives of Monoclonal B Cells |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=360 |issue=7 |pages=722–72 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19213686 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMe0810453|url=}}</ref>

No treatment is required, but follow-up might be able to detect new diagnoses of CLL. However, this might lead to increased costs, repeated investigations, unnecessary anxiety about [[cancer]] and [[health insurance]] concerns, while there is no means to prevent progression to CLL.<ref name="pmid16042682"/>
