[[Copper]] is an essential [[trace element]] that is vital to the health of all living things (humans, plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]]). In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.

Daily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of lifes.

Copper deficiency and toxicity can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives. 

Researchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.

==Essentiality==

Copper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health. It is also required for the normal functioning of [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] (oxygen-requiring) [[microorganisms]]. 

Copper is incorporated into a variety of [[proteins]] and [[metalloenzyme]]s which perform essential metabolic functions; the micronutrient is necessary for the proper growth, development, and maintenance of bone, [[connective tissue]], brain, heart, and many other body organs. Copper is involved in the formation of [[red blood cells]], the absorption and utilization of iron, the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] and [[glucose]], and the synthesis and release of life-sustaining [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]]. These enzymes in turn produce cellular energy and regulate nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport. 

Copper stimulates the [[immune system]] to fight [[infections]], to repair injured tissues, and to promote healing. Copper also helps to neutralize "[[free-radical]]s", which can cause severe damage to cells.

Copper's essentiality was first discovered in 1928, when it was demonstrated that rats fed a copper-deficient milk diet were unable to produce sufficient red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hart E. B., Steenbock H., Waddell J. | year = 1928 | title = Iron nutrition. VII: Copper is a supplement to iron for hemoglobin building in the rat | url = | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 797–812 }}</ref> The [[anemia]] was corrected by the addition of copper-containing ash from vegetable or animal sources.

As an essential trace element, daily dietary requirements for copper have been recommended by a number of governmental health agencies around the world.

===Fetuses, infants, and children===
Copper is essential for the normal growth and development of human [[fetuses]], [[infant]]s, and [[child]]ren.<ref name="Ralph">Ralph, A., and McArdle, H. J. 2001. Copper metabolism and requirements in the pregnant mother, her fetus, and children. New York: International Copper Association</ref> The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its [[liver]] during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants. 

Infants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>Dr. George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref> 

Severe deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]]. 

Since copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat anemia or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.

When newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4–6 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.

Cow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion. 

Most well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.

===Homeostasis===
Copper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex homeostatic processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels. If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals. 

Many aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name="SternBonnie_b">{{cite journal | author = Stern Bonnie R.

The transport and metabolism of copper in living organisms is currently the subject of much active research. Copper transport at the cellular level involves the movement of extracellular copper across the [[cell membrane]] and into the cell by specialized transporters.<ref name="SternBonnie_a">Stern, Bonnie R., Essentiality and Toxicity In Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update And Regulatory Considerations'', 2010 Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health,'' Part A, 73:114–127</ref> In the bloodstream, copper is carried throughout the body by [[albumin]], [[ceruloplasmin]], and other proteins. The majority of blood copper (or serum copper) is bound to ceruloplasmin. The proportion of ceruloplasmin-bound copper can range from 70-95% and differs between individuals, depending, for example, on hormonal cycle, season, and copper status. Intracellular copper is routed to sites of synthesis of copper-requiring [[enzymes]] and to [[organelles]] by specialized proteins called metallochaperones.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Camakaris J., Voskoboinik I., Mercer J.

Copper is imported into cells through the cell wall by the [[plasma membrane]] transport protein known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma ceruloplasmin or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the [[trans-Golgi network]] to the proteins [[dopamine beta-monooxygenase]], [[peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase]], [[lysyl oxidase]], and [[tyrosinase]], depending on the cell type. [[CCS (gene)|CCS]] is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the [[cytoplasm]] and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to [[mitochondria]] to [[cytochrome c oxidase]] via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include [[metallothionein]] and [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Much , Science U.S., Technology , Stern Bonnie R. | year = 2010 | title = Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, update and regulatory considerations | url = | journal = Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health |series= Part A | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 114–127 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Stern B.R.

===Absorption===
In mammals, copper is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine, although there appear to be differences among species with respect to the site of maximal absorption.<ref>Stern, B.R. et. al, 2007, Copper And Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, And Strategies for Modeling Dose-Response Relationships, ''Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health,'' Part B, 10:157–222</ref> Copper is absorbed from the stomach and [[duodenum]] in rats <ref>{{cite journal | author = Van Campen D.

Some forms of copper are not soluble in stomach acids and cannot be absorbed from the stomach or small intestine. Also, some foods may contain indigestible fiber that binds with copper. High intakes of [[zinc]] can significantly decrease copper absorption. Extreme intakes of [[Vitamin C]] or [[iron]] can also affect copper absorption, reminding us of the fact that micronutrients need to be consumed as a balanced mixture. This is one reason why extreme intakes of any one single micronutrient are not advised.<ref>See http://copperinfo.com/health/goodhealth.html</ref> Individuals with chronic digestive problems may be unable to absorb sufficient amounts of copper, even though the foods they eat are copper-rich.

==Daily dietary copper requirements==
Various national and international organizations concerned with nutrition and health have standards for copper intake at levels judged to be adequate for maintaining good health. These standards, or dietary reference values, are periodically changed and updated as new scientific data become available. The standards sometimes differ among regions and organizations.

===Adults===
The [[World Health Organization]] recommends a minimal acceptable intake of approximately 1.3&nbsp;mg/day.<ref>WHO/FAO/IAEA, (1996), Trace Elements in Human Nutrition and Health. World Health Organization, Geneva)</ref> These values are considered to be adequate and safe for most of the general population. In North America, the recommended intake of copper for healthy adult men and women is 900 micrograms/day (0.9&nbsp;mg/day).<ref name="nlm">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002419.htm</ref><ref name="Instituteof">Institute of Medicine (IOM), Food and Nutrition Board, (2002) Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum</ref><ref>Food and Nutrition Boarde, Institute of Medicine, The National Academies, Dietary reference intakes: vitamin A, vitamin K, arsenic, boron, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, vanadium, and zinc. 'J Am Diet Assoc.' 2001 Mar, 101(3) 294-301.</ref> Health benefits above the recommended adequate intake of 0.9 - 1.3&nbsp;mg/day have not been established.

In North America, a maximum tolerable intake has been established at 10&nbsp;mg/day. This is the highest level of copper intake that is not likely to pose a health risk to most adults in the general population. However, this daily intake level is not recommended by any authority.

===Adolescents, children, and infants===
The World Health Organization has not developed minimum daily intakes for these age groups. In North America, safe and acceptable daily intakes have been estimated from adult data and are as follows: 340 micrograms/day (0.34&nbsp;mg/day) for children of 1–3 years; 440 micrograms/day (0.44&nbsp;mg/day) for 4–8 years; 700 micrograms/day (0.7&nbsp;mg/day) for 9–13 years; and 890 micrograms/day (0.89&nbsp;mg/day) for 14–18 years.<ref name="nlm" /><ref name="Instituteof" /><ref>Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, The National Academies, Dietary reference intakes: vitamin A, vitamin K, arsenic, boron, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, vanadium, and zinc. 'J Am Diet Assoc.' 2001 Mar, 101(3) 294-301.</ref> 

In North America, tolerable intakes for these age groups (i.e., intakes not likely to pose a health risk for most children in the general population, but for which no additional health benefits are known) are: 1&nbsp;mg/day for children of 1–3 years; 3&nbsp;mg/day for 4–8 years; 5&nbsp;mg/day for 9–13 years; and 8&nbsp;mg/day for 14–18 years. 

Full-term and premature infants are more sensitive to copper deficiency than adults. Since the fetus accumulates copper during the last 3 months of pregnancy, infants that are born prematurely have not had sufficient time to store adequate reserves of copper in their livers and therefore require more copper at birth than full-term infants.

For full-term infants, the North American recommended safe and adequate intake is approximately 0.2&nbsp;mg/day. For premature babies, it is considerably higher: 1&nbsp;mg/day. The World Health Organization has recommended similar minimum adequate intakes and advises that premature infants be given formula supplemented with extra copper to prevent the development of copper deficiency.<ref name="copperinfo">http://copperinfo.com/health/goodhealth.html</ref>

===Pregnant women and mothers who breastfeed===
Nature has devised a way for the [[fetus]] to get copper from the mother via the [[placenta]] and for infants to get copper via breast milk. For these reasons, pregnancy and nursing increase the body's need for copper. The recommended oral intake in pregnant and nursing women is slightly higher than for non-pregnant, non-nursing healthy women (approximately 1&nbsp;mg/day for pregnant women and 1.3&nbsp;mg/day for nursing mothers aged 14–50 years).<ref name="copperinfo" />

The best source of copper and other essential micronutrients during the first year of life is [[human milk]]. If a full-term infant is not nursed, fortified [[baby formula]] is highly recommended. Cow's milk, however, contains very low amounts of bioavailable copper and should be supplemented with copper during the first year of life.

==Dietary sources==
Copper is an essential trace mineral that cannot be formed by the human body. It must be ingested from dietary sources. 

Foods contribute virtually all of the copper consumed by humans.<ref>Georgopoulos, P. G., Roy, A., Yvonne-Lioy, M. J., Opiekun, R. E., and Lioy, P. J. 2001. Environmental copper: Its dynamics and human exposure issues. ''J. Toxicol. Environ. Health'' B 4:341–394</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sadhra S. S., Wheatley A. D., Cross H.

Environmental Health Criteria 200. Geneva: IPCS, WHO</ref> The best dietary sources include [[seafood]] (especially [[shellfish]]), [[organ meat]]s (e.g., liver), [[whole grain]]s, [[legumes]] (e.g., [[bean]]s and [[lentil]]s) and [[chocolate]]. Nuts, including [[peanut]]s and [[pecan]]s, are especially rich in copper, as are grains such as [[wheat]] and [[rye]], and several fruits including [[lemon]]s and [[raisin]]s. Other food sources that contain copper include [[cereal]]s, [[potato]]es, [[pea]]s, [[red meat]], [[mushroom]]s, some dark green leafy vegetables (such as [[kale]]), and fruits ([[coconut]]s, [[papaya]] and [[apple]]s). [[Tea]], [[rice]] and [[chicken]] are relatively low in copper, but can provide a reasonable amount of copper when they are consumed in significant amounts. 

Eating a balanced diet with a range of foods from different food groups is the best way to avoid copper deficiency. In both developed and developing countries, adults, young children, and adolescents who consume diets of grain, [[millet]], [[tuber]], or rice along with legumes (beans) or small amounts of fish or meat, some fruits and vegetables, and some vegetable oil are likely to obtain adequate copper if their total food consumption is adequate in calories. In developed countries where consumption of red meat is high, copper intake is also likely to be adequate. 

As a natural element in the earth's crust, copper exists in most of the world's surface water and groundwater, although the actual concentration of copper in natural waters varies geographically. Drinking water can comprise 20-25% of dietary copper.<ref name="Stern">Stern, B. R. 2007. U-shaped dose-response curve for risk assessment of essential trace elements: Copper as a case study. San Francisco: John Wiley and Sons</ref>

In many regions of the world, copper tubing that conveys drinking water can be a source of dietary copper. Copper tube can leach a small amount of copper, particularly in its first year or two of service. Afterwards, a protective surface usually forms on the inside of copper tubes that retards leaching.

===Supplementation===
Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[copper carbonate|carbonate]].

Supplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].

Many popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control. Supplements (and copper plumbing) are thought by some to be a [http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijad/2011/537528/ possible cause] of the current epidemic of Alzheimer's disease.

==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==
{{main|Copper deficiency}}

If insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name="copperinfo_a">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion. These symptoms abate when the high copper food source is no longer ingested. 

In 1996, the International Program on Chemical Safety, a World Health Organization-associated agency, stated "there is greater risk of health effects from deficiency of copper intake than from excess copper intake." This conclusion was confirmed in recent multi-route exposure surveys.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Georgopoulos P. G., Wang S. W., Georgopoulos I. G., Yonone-Lioy M. J., Lioy P.

The health conditions of non-genetic copper deficiency and copper excess are described below.

===Copper deficiency===
A number of nutrition surveys have indicated that the diets of approximately 25% of [[adolescent]]s, adults, and people over 65, do not meet the recommended daily nutrient intake for copper.<ref name="SternBonnie" /> These studies also suggest that long-term acquired copper deficiency is under-diagnosed and is much more common than suspected.

Acquired copper deficiency has recently been implicated in adult-onset progressive myeloneuropathy <ref>{{cite journal | author = Spinazzi M, De Lazzari F, Tavolato B, Angelini C, Manara R, Armani M | year = 2007 | title = Myelo-optico-neuropathy in copper deficiency occurring after partial gastrectomy.

A marginal (i.e., 'mild') copper deficiency, believed to be more widespread than previously thought, can impair human health in subtle ways.<ref name="Stern" /> Those affected suffer from lowered resistance to infection, general fatigue, impaired neurological function, and elevated risk for coronary heart disease and osteoporosis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Klevay L.

Populations susceptible to copper deficiency include those with genetic defects for [[Menkes disease]], low-birth-weight infants, infants fed cow's milk instead of breast milk or fortified formula, pregnant and lactating mothers, patients receiving [[total parenteral nutrition]], individuals with "malabsorption syndrome" (impaired dietary absorption), [[diabetic]]s, individuals with chronic diseases that result in low food intake, such as alcoholics, and persons with eating disorders. The elderly and [[sportsperson|athlete]]s may also be at higher risk for copper deficiency due to special needs that increase the daily requirements.<ref name="Wapnir1998" /> [[Vegetarian]]s may have decreased copper intake due to the consumption of plant foods in which copper bioavailability is low.<ref name="Lee1984" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Lonnerdal B | year = 1996 | title = Bioavailability of copper | url = | journal = Am.

Copper deficiencies in these populations may result in anemia, bone abnormalities, impaired growth, weight gain, frequent infections (colds, flu, pneumonia), poor motor coordination, and low energy.

===Copper excess===
{{Main|Copper toxicity}} 
Copper excess is a subject of much current research. Distinctions have emerged from studies that copper excess factors are different in normal populations versus those with increased susceptibility to adverse effects and those with rare genetic diseases.<ref name="InternationalProgramme" /><ref name="Stern" /> This has led to statements from health organizations that could be confusing to the uninformed. For example, according to a U.S. Institute of Medicine report,<ref>U.S. Institute of Medicine. 2001. Dietary reference intakes for vitamin A, vitamin K, arsenic, boron, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, vanadium and zinc. Food and Nutrition Board. Washington, DC: National Academy Press</ref> the intake levels of copper for a significant percentage of the population are lower than recommended levels. On the other hand, the U.S. [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]<ref>U.S. National Research Council. 2000. Copper in drinking water. Committee on Copper in Drinking Water, Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology, Commission of Life Sciences. Washington, DC: National Academy Press</ref> concluded in its report Copper in Drinking Water that there is concern for copper toxicity in susceptible populations and recommended that additional research be conducted to identify and characterize copper-sensitive populations.

Excess copper intake causes stomach upset, [[nausea]], and diarrhea and can lead to tissue injury and disease. 

The [[oxidation potential]] of copper may be responsible for some of its toxicity in excess ingestion cases. At high concentrations copper is known to produce [[oxidative damage]] to biological systems, including [[peroxidation]] of [[lipids]] or other [[macromolecules]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bremner I | year = 1998 | title = Manifestations of copper excess | url = | journal = Am.

However, it is not yet known whether this accumulation is a cause or a consequence of the disease.

Research has been ongoing over the past two decades to determine whether copper is a causative or a preventive agent of Alzheimer's disease, and whether copper accumulates due to a metal [[homeostasis]] disturbance that develops in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. For example, as a possible causative agent or an expression of a metal [[homeostasis]] disturbance, studies indicate that copper may play a role in increasing the growth of protein clumps in Alzheimer's disease brains,<ref>Copper link to Alzheimer's disease, New Scientist, August 12, 2003, http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4045-copper-link-to-alzheimers-disease.html</ref> possibly by damaging a molecule that removes the toxic buildup of [[amyloid beta]] (Aβ) in the brain.<ref>Copper damages protein that defends against Alzheimer's, Science Daily, November 8, 2007, http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071107074329.htm</ref> On the other hand, studies also demonstrate potential beneficial roles of copper in treating rather than causing Alzheimer's disease.<ref>Protective role for copper in Alzheimer's disease, Science News, October 13, 2009, http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091008133457.htm</ref> For example, copper has been shown to 1) promote the non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), thereby lowering [[amyloid beta]] (Aβ) production in cell culture systems<ref>The amyloid fibrillar form of Aβ is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_precursor_protein</ref> 2) increase lifetime and decrease soluble amyloid production in APP [[transgenic mice]], and 3) lower Aβ levels in [[cerebral spinal fluid]] in Alzheimer's disease patients.<ref>Kaden, Daniela et al., accepted for publication in 2011, A copper connection in Alzheimer Disease?, International Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</ref>

Furthermore, long-term copper treatment (oral intake of 8&nbsp;mg copper (Cu-(II)-orotate-dihydrate)) was excluded as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in a noted clinical trial on humans<ref>Kessler, H., T. A. Bayer, D. Bach, T. Schneider-Axmann, T. Supprian, W. Herrmann, M. Haber, G. Multhaup, P. Falkai, and F. G. Pajonk. 2008.

J Neural Transm, 2008. 115(12)  p. 1651-9.</ref> More research is needed to understand metal homeostasis disturbances in Alzheimer's disease patients and how to address these disturbances therapeutically. Since this experiment used Cu-(II)-orotate-dihydrate, it does not relate to the effects of [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22673823 cupric oxide] in supplements.

===Copper toxicity from excess exposures===
In humans, the liver is the primary organ of copper-induced toxicity. Other target organs include bone and the central nervous and immune systems.<ref name="InternationalProgramme" /> Excess copper intake also induces toxicity indirectly by interacting with other nutrients. For example, excess copper intake produces anemia by interfering with iron transport and/or metabolism.<ref name="Ralph" /><ref name="InternationalProgramme" /> 

The identification of genetic disorders of copper metabolism leading to severe copper toxicity (i.e., [[Wilson disease]]) has spurred research into the molecular genetics and biology of copper homeostasis (for further information, refer to the following section on copper genetic diseases). Much attention has focused on the potential consequences of copper toxicity in normal and potentially susceptible populations. Potentially susceptible subpopulations include [[hemodialysis]] patients and individuals with chronic liver disease. Recently, concern was expressed about the potential sensitivity to liver disease of individuals who are [[heterozygote]] carriers of Wilson disease genetic defects (i.e., those having one normal and one mutated Wilson copper ATPase gene) but who do not have the disease (which requires defects in both relevant genes).<ref>Brewer, G. J. 2000. Editorial. J. Trace Elem. Exp. Med. 13:249–254</ref> However, to date, no data are available that either support or refute this hypothesis.

===Acute exposures===
In case reports of humans intentionally or accidentally ingesting high concentrations of copper salts (doses usually not known but reported to be 20–70&nbsp;grams of copper), a progression of symptoms was observed including abdominal pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea, [[tachycardia]], respiratory difficulty, [[hemolytic anemia]], [[hematuria]], massive gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and kidney failure, and death.

Episodes of acute gastrointestinal upset following single or repeated ingestion of drinking water containing elevated levels of copper (generally above 3–6&nbsp;mg/L) are characterized by nausea, vomiting, and stomach irritation. These symptoms resolve when copper in the drinking water source is reduced.

Three experimental studies were conducted that demonstrate a threshold for acute gastrointestinal upset of approximately 4–5&nbsp;mg/L in healthy adults, although it is not clear from these findings whether symptoms are due to acutely irritant effects of copper and/or to metallic, bitter, salty taste.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Araya M., McGoldrick M.

Dermal exposure has not been associated with systemic toxicity but anecdotal reports of allergic responses may be a sensitization to nickel and cross-reaction with copper or a skin irritation from copper.<ref name="InternationalProgramme" /> Workers exposed to high air levels of copper (resulting in an estimated intake of 200&nbsp;mg Cu/d) developed signs suggesting copper toxicity (e.g., elevated serum copper levels, hepatomegaly). However, other co-occurring exposures to pesticidal agents or in mining and smelting may contribute to these effects.<ref name="InternationalProgramme" /> Effects of copper inhalation are being thoroughly investigated by an industry-sponsored program on workplace air and worker safety. This multi-year research effort is expected to be finalized in 2011.

===Measurements of elevated copper status===
Although a number of indicators are useful in diagnosing copper deficiency, there are no reliable biomarkers of copper excess resulting from dietary intake. The most reliable indicator of excess copper status is liver copper concentration. However, measurement of this endpoint in humans is intrusive and not generally conducted except in cases of suspected copper poisoning. Increased serum copper or ceruolplasmin levels are not reliably associated with copper toxicity as elevations in concentrations can be induced by inflammation, infection, disease, malignancies, pregnancy, and other biological stressors. Levels of copper-containing enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and diaminase oxidase, vary not only in response to copper state but also in response to a variety of other physiological and biochemical factors and therefore are inconsistent markers of excess copper status.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Milne D. B. | year = 1998 | title = Copper intake and assessment of copper status | url = | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr | volume = 67 | issue = 5 Suppl| pages = 1041S–1045S | pmid = 9587149 }}</ref>

A new candidate biomarker for copper excess as well as deficiency has emerged in recent years. This potential marker is a chaperone protein, which delivers copper to the antioxidant protein SOD1 (copper, zinc superoxide dismutase). It is called "copper chaperone for SOD1" (CCS), and excellent animal data supports its use as a marker in accessible cells (e.g., [[erythrocyte]]s) for copper deficiency as well as excess. CCS is currently being tested as a [[biomarker]] in humans.

==Hereditary copper metabolic diseases==
Several rare genetic diseases ([[Wilson disease]], [[Menkes disease]], [[idiopathic]] copper toxicosis, [[Indian childhood cirrhosis]]) are associated with the improper utilization of copper in the body.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/goodhealth.hereditary.html</ref> All of these diseases involve [[mutations]] of [[genes]] containing the [[genetic code]]s for the production of specific proteins involved in the absorption and distribution of copper. When these proteins are dysfunctional, copper either builds up in the liver or the body fails to absorb copper. 

These diseases are inherited and cannot be acquired. Adjusting copper levels in the diet or drinking water will not cure these conditions (although therapies are available to manage symptoms of genetic copper excess disease). 

The study of genetic copper metabolism diseases and their associated proteins are enabling scientists to understand how human bodies use copper and why it is important as an essential micronutrient. 

The diseases arise from defects in two similar copper pumps, the Menkes and the Wilson Cu-ATPases.<ref>Stern, Bonnie R. et al., 2007, Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, And Strategies For Modeling Dose-Response Relationships, Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B, 10:157–222</ref> The Menkes ATPase is expressed in tissues like skin-building fibroblasts, kidneys, placenta, brain, gut and vascular system, while the Wilson ATPase is expressed mainly in the liver, but also in mammary glands and possibly in other specialized tissues.<ref name="InternationalProgramme" /> This knowledge is leading scientists towards possible cures for genetic copper diseases.<ref name="copperinfo_a" />

===Menkes disease===
[[Menkes disease]], a genetic condition of copper deficiency, was first described by Dr. John Menkes in 1962. It is a rare X-linked disorder that affects approximately 1/200,000 live births, primarily boys.<ref name="SternBonnie_b" /> Livers of Menkes disease patients cannot absorb essential copper needed for patients to survive. Death usually occurs in early childhood: most affected individuals die before the age of 10 years, although several patients have survived into their teens and early 20s.<ref name="Kaler1998">{{cite journal | author = Kaler S. G. | year = 1998 | title = Metabolic and molecular bases of Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome | url = | journal = Pediatr. Dev. Pathol | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 85–98 | doi = 10.1007/s100249900011 | pmid = 10463276 }}</ref>

The protein produced by the Menkes gene is responsible for transporting copper across the [[gastrointestinal tract]] (GIT) [[mucosa]] and the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name="SternBonnie_a" /><ref name="Kaler1998" /> Mutational defects in the gene encoding the copper ATPase cause copper to remain trapped in the lining of the small intestine. Hence, copper cannot be pumped out of the intestinal cells and into the blood for transport to the liver and consequently to rest of the body.<ref name="Kaler1998" /><ref name="Kaler1996">{{cite journal | author = Kaler S. G. | year = 1996 | title = Menkes disease mutations and response to early copper histidine treatment | url = | journal = Nat. Genet | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 21–22 | doi = 10.1038/ng0596-21 | pmid = 8673098 }}</ref> The disease therefore resembles a severe nutritional copper deficiency despite adequate ingestion of copper.

Symptoms of the disease include coarse, brittle, depigmented hair and other neonatal problems, including the inability to control body temperature, mental retardation, skeletal defects, and abnormal connective tissue growth.

Menkes patients exhibit severe neurological abnormalities, apparently due to the lack of several copper-dependent enzymes required for brain development,<ref name="Stern" /><ref>Kaler, S. G. 1994. Menkes disease. Adv. Pediatr. 41:263–304</ref> including reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity.<ref name="Kaler1998" /> The brittle, kinky hypopigmented hair of steely appearance is due to a deficiency in an unidentified cuproenzyme. Reduced [[lysyl oxidase]] activity results in defective [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] polymerization and corresponding connective-tissue abnormalities including [[aortic aneurism]]s, loose skin, and fragile bones. 

With early diagnosis and treatment consisting of daily injections of copper [[histidine]] [[intraperitoneal]]ly and [[intrathecal]]ly to the central nervous system, some of the severe neurological problems may be avoided and survival prolonged. However, Menkes disease patients retain abnormal bone and connective-tissue disorders and show mild to severe mental retardation.<ref name="Kaler1996" /> Even with early diagnosis and treatment, Menkes disease is usually fatal.

Ongoing research into Menkes disease is leading to a greater understanding of copper homeostasis,<ref name="Llanos2002">{{cite journal | author = Llanos R. M., Mercer J. F. | year = 2002 | title = The molecular basis of copper homeostasis and copper-related disorders | url = | journal = DNA Cell Biol. | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 259–270 | doi = 10.1089/104454902753759681 | pmid = 12042066 }}</ref> the biochemical mechanisms involved in the disease, and possible ways to treat it.<ref name="copperinfo_b">http://copperinfo.com/health/goodhealth.genetic.html</ref> Investigations into the transport of copper across the blood/brain barrier, which are based on studies of genetically altered mice, are designed to help researchers understand the root cause of copper deficiency in Menkes disease. The genetic makeup of "[[transgenic mice]]" is altered in ways that help researchers garner new perspectives about copper deficiency. The research to date has been valuable: genes can be 'turned off' gradually to explore varying degrees of deficiency.

Researchers have also demonstrated in test tubes that damaged [[DNA]] in the cells of a Menkes patient can be repaired. In time, the procedures needed to repair damaged genes in the human body may be found.

===Wilson's disease===
[[Wilson's disease]] is a rare [[autosomal]] ([[chromosome 13]]) recessive genetic disorder of copper transport that causes an excess of copper to build up in the liver.<ref name="Llanos2002" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Mercer J. F. | year = 2001 | title = The molecular basis of copper-transport diseases | url = | journal = Trends Mol.

H., Sternlieb I. | year = 1996 | title = Wilson disease and idiopathic copper toxicosis | url = | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 63 | issue = 5| pages = 842S–845S | pmid = 8615372 }}</ref> The disease is now treatable.

Wilson's disease is produced by mutational defects of a protein that transports copper from the liver to the bile for excretion.<ref name="Llanos2002" /> The disease involves poor incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin and impaired biliary copper excretion and is usually induced by mutations impairing the function of the Wilson copper ATPase. These genetic mutations produce copper toxicosis due to excess copper accumulation, predominantly in the liver and brain and, to a lesser extent, in kidneys, eyes, and other organs. 

The disease, which affects about 1/30,000 infants of both genders,<ref name="InternationalProgramme" /> may become clinically evident at any time from infancy through early adulthood. The age of onset of Wilson's disease ranges from 3 to 50 years of age. Initial symptoms include [[hepatic]], neurologic, or psychiatric disorders and, rarely, [[renal]], skeletal, or [[endocrine]] symptomatology. The disease progresses with deepening [[jaundice]] and the development of [[encephalopathy]], severe clotting abnormalities, occasionally associated with [[intravascular coagulation]], and terminal renal insufficiency. A peculiar type of tremor in the upper extremities, slowness of movement, and changes in temperament become apparent. [[Kayser-Fleischer rings]], a rusty brown discoloration at the outer rims of the iris due to copper deposition noted in 90% of patients, become evident as copper begins to accumulate and affect the nervous system.<ref>Ferenci, P., Caca, K., Loudianos, G., Mieli-Vergani, G., Tanner, S., Sternlieb, I., Schilsky, M., Cox, D., and Berr, F. 2003. Diagnosis and phenotypic classification of Wilson's disease. Liver 23:139–142</ref>

Almost always, death occurs if the disease is untreated.<ref name="Stern" /> Fortunately, identification of the mutations in the Wilson ATPase gene underlying most cases of Wilson's disease has made DNA testing for diagnosis possible.

If diagnosed and treated early enough, patients with Wilson's disease may live long and productive lives.<ref name="copperinfo_b" /> Wilson's disease is managed by copper chelation therapy with [[D-penicillamine]] (which picks up and binds copper and enables patients to excrete excess copper accumulated in the liver), therapy with zinc sulfate or zinc acetate, and restrictive dietary metal intake, such as the elimination of chocolate, oysters, and mushrooms.<ref name="Stern" /> Zinc therapy is now the treatment of choice. Zinc produces a mucosal block by inducing metallothionein, which binds copper in mucosal cells until they slough off and are eliminated in the feces.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brewer G. J., Dick R. D., Johnson V. D., Brunberg J. A., Kluin K. J., Fink J. K. | year = 1998 | title = Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc: XV. Long-term follow-up studies | url = | journal = J. Lab. Clin. Med. | volume = 132 | issue = | pages = 264–278 }}</ref> and it competes with copper for absorption in the intestine by DMT1 (Divalent Metal transporter 1). More recently, experimental treatments with [[tetrathiomolybdate]] showed promising results. Tetrathiomolybdate appears to be an excellent form of initial treatment in patients who have neurologic symptoms. In contrast to penicillamine therapy, initial treatment with tetrathiomolybdate rarely allows further, often irreversible, neurologic deterioration.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brewer G.

Over 100 different genetic defects leading to Wilson's disease have been described and are available on the Internet at [http://www.uofa-medical-genetics.org/wilson/index.php]. Some of the mutations have geographic clustering.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Garcia-Villarreal L., Daniels S., Shaw S.

Many Wilson's patients carry different mutations on each [[chromosome 13]] (i.e., they are
[[compound heterozygotes]]).<ref name="Stern" /> Even in individuals who are homozygous for a mutation, onset and severity of the disease may vary.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Duc H.

Disease severity may also be a function of environmental factors, including the amount of copper in the diet or variability in the function of other proteins that influence copper homeostasis. 

It has been suggested that heterozygote carriers of the Wilson's disease gene mutation may be potentially more susceptible to elevated copper intake than the general population.<ref>National Research Council. 2000. Copper in drinking water, ed. Committee on Copper in Drinking Water. Washington, DC: National Academy Press</ref> A heterozygotic frequency of 1/90 people has been estimated in the overall population.<ref name="InternationalProgramme" /> However, there is no evidence to support this speculation.<ref>Stern, B.R., 2010, Essentiality and toxicity in copper health risk assessment: Overview, update and regulatory considerations, ''Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health,'' Part A, 73:114–127</ref> Further, a review of the data on single-allelic autosomal recessive diseases in humans does not suggest that heterozygote carriers are likely to be adversely affected by their altered genetic status.

===Other copper-related hereditary syndromes===
Other diseases in which abnormalities in copper metabolism appear to be involved include [[Indian childhood cirrhosis]] (ICC), endemic Tyrolean copper toxicosis (ETIC), and [[idiopathic]] copper toxicosis (ICT), also known as non-Indian childhood cirrhosis. ICT is a genetic disease recognized in the early twentieth century primarily in the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrolean]] region of [[Austria]] and in the [[Pune]] region of [[India]].<ref name="Stern" />

ICC, ICT, and ETIC are infancy syndromes that are similar in their apparent [[etiology]] and presentation.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wijmenga C., Muller T., Murli I. S., Brunt T., Feichtinger H., Schonitzer D., Houwen R. H., Muller W., Sandkuijl L. A.

In cases of ICC, the elevated copper intake is due to heating and/or storing milk in copper or brass vessels. ICT cases, on the other hand, are due to elevated copper concentrations in water supplies.<ref name="InternationalProgramme" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Muller T., Muller W., Feichtinger H. | year = 1998 | title = Idiopathic copper toxicosis | url = | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 67 | issue = 5 Suppl| pages = 1082S–1086S | pmid = 9587156 }}</ref> Although exposures to elevated concentrations of copper are commonly found in both diseases, some cases appear to develop in children who are exclusively breastfed or who receive only low levels of copper in water supplies.<ref name="Muller">{{cite journal | author = Muller T., Muller W., Feichtinger H. | year = 1998 | title = Idiopathic copper toxicosis | url = | journal = Am. J. Clin.

This hypothesis was supported by the frequency of occurrence of parental [[consanguinity]] in most of these cases, which is absent in areas with elevated copper in drinking water and in which these syndromes do not occur.<ref name="Muller" />

ICT appears to be vanishing as a result of greater genetic diversity within the affected populations in conjunction with educational programs to ensure that tinned cooking utensils are used instead of copper pots and pans being directly exposed to cooked foods. The preponderance of cases of early childhood cirrhosis identified in [[Germany]] over a period of 10 years were not associated with either external sources of copper or with elevated hepatic metal concentrations<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dieter H.

==Contraception with copper IUDs==
''Main articles: [[IUD with copper]] and [[Paragard]]''

A copper [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) is a type of [[long-acting reversible contraception]] that is considered to be one of the most effective forms of birth control.<ref name=Winner2012>{{Cite journal

It is also considered the most effective non-hormonal contraceptive device.
The copper IUD's primary mechanism of action is to prevent fertilization. Active substances released from the IUD, together with products derived from the inflammatory reaction present in the luminal fluids of the genital tract, are toxic for spermatozoa and oocytes, preventing the encounter of healthy gametes and the formation of viable embryos.

==Plant and animal health==
In addition to being an essential nutrient for humans, copper is vital for the health of animals and plants and plays an important role in [[agriculture]].<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/plant.html</ref>

===Plant health===
Copper concentrations in soil are not uniform around the world. In many areas, soils have insufficient levels of copper. Soils that are naturally deficient in copper often require copper supplements before agricultural crops, such as cereals, can be grown.

Copper deficiencies in soil can lead to crop failure. Copper deficiency is a major issue in global food production, resulting in losses in yield and reduced quality of output. Nitrogen fertilizers can worsen copper deficiency in agricultural soils. 

The world's two most important food crops, [[rice]] and [[wheat]], are highly susceptible to copper deficiency. So are several other important foods, including [[citrus]], [[oats]], [[spinach]] and [[carrot]]s. On the other hand, some foods including [[coconut]]s, [[soybean]]s and [[asparagus]], are not particularly sensitive to copper-deficient soils.

The most effective strategy to counter copper deficiency is to supplement the soil with copper, usually in the form of copper sulfate. [[Sewage sludge]] is also used in some areas to replenish agricultural land with organics and trace metals, including copper.

===Animal health===
In livestock, [[cattle]] and [[sheep]] commonly show indications when they are copper deficient. [[Swayback]], a sheep disease associated with copper deficiency, imposes enormous costs on farmers worldwide, particularly in [[Europe]], [[North America]], and many tropical countries. For [[pig]]s, copper has been shown to be an outstanding growth promoter.
