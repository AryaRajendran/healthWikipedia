A '''stroke''', or '''cerebrovascular accident''' ('''CVA'''), is the rapid loss of [[brain]] function due to disturbance in the [[blood supply]] to the brain. This can be due to [[ischemia]] (lack of blood flow) caused by blockage ([[thrombosis]], [[arterial embolism]]), or a [[internal bleeding|hemorrhage]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sims NR, Muyderman H |title=Mitochondria, oxidative metabolism and cell death in stroke |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume= 1802|issue= 1|pages= 80–91|year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19751827 |doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.09.003}}</ref> As a result, the affected area of the brain cannot function, which might result in an [[hemiplegia|inability to move]] one or more limbs on one side of the body, inability to [[receptive aphasia|understand]] or [[expressive aphasia|formulate]] speech, or an [[Homonymous hemianopsia|inability to see]] one side of the visual field.<ref name=Donnan>{{cite journal |author=Donnan GA, Fisher M, Macleod M, Davis SM |title=Stroke |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9624 |pages=1612–23 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18468545 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60694-7}}</ref>

A stroke is a [[medical emergency]] and can cause permanent [[neurological disorder|neurological damage]] and death. [[Risk factor]]s for stroke include [[old age]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], previous stroke or [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA), [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], [[tobacco smoking]] and [[atrial fibrillation]].<ref name=Donnan/> High blood pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor of stroke.<ref name=Donnan/> It is the second leading cause of death worldwide.<ref name=Mathers2009/> 

An ischemic stroke is occasionally treated in a hospital with [[thrombolysis]] (also known as a "clot buster"), and some hemorrhagic strokes benefit from [[neurosurgery]]. Treatment to recover any lost function is termed [[stroke rehabilitation]], ideally in a [[stroke unit]] and involving health professions such as [[speech and language therapy]], [[physical therapy]] and [[occupational therapy]]. Prevention of recurrence may involve the administration of [[antiplatelet]] drugs such as [[aspirin]] and [[dipyridamole]], control and reduction of high blood pressure, and the use of [[statin]]s. Selected patients may benefit from [[carotid endarterectomy]] and the use of [[anticoagulant]]s.<ref name=Donnan/>

==Classification==
[[File:MCA-Stroke-Brain-Human-2.JPG|thumb|A slice of brain from the autopsy of a person who suffered an acute [[middle cerebral artery|middle cerebral artery (MCA)]] stroke]]
Strokes can be classified into two major categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/preventing_stroke.htm|title=Brain Basics: Preventing Stroke|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref> Ischemic strokes are those that are caused by interruption of the blood supply, while hemorrhagic strokes are the ones which result from rupture of a [[blood vessel]] or an abnormal vascular structure. About 87% of strokes are caused by ischemia, and the remainder by hemorrhage. Some hemorrhages develop inside areas of ischemia ("hemorrhagic transformation"). It is unknown how many hemorrhages actually start as ischemic stroke.<ref name=Donnan/>

===Ischemic===
{{Main|Cerebral infarction|Brain ischemia}}

In an ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen:

# Thrombosis (obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot forming locally)
# Embolism (obstruction due to an embolus from elsewhere in the body, see below),<ref name=Donnan/>
# Systemic hypoperfusion (general decrease in blood supply, e.g., in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]])<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shuaib A, Hachinski VC |title=Mechanisms and management of stroke in the elderly |journal=CMAJ |volume=145 |issue=5 |pages=433–43 |year=1991 |month=September |pmid=1878825 |pmc=1335826}}</ref>

Stroke without an obvious explanation is termed "cryptogenic" (of unknown origin); this constitutes 30-40% of all ischemic strokes.<ref name=Donnan/><ref name=Guercini>{{cite journal |author=Guercini F, Acciarresi M, Agnelli G, Paciaroni M |title=Cryptogenic stroke: time to determine aetiology |journal=Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=549–54 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18208534 |doi=10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.02903.x}}</ref>

There are various classification systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as [[total anterior circulation infarct]] (TACI), [[partial anterior circulation infarct]] (PACI), [[lacunar infarct]] (LACI) or [[posterior circulation infarct]] (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bamford J, Sandercock P, Dennis M, Burn J, Warlow C |title=Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction |journal=Lancet |volume=337 |issue=8756 |pages=1521–6 |year=1991 |month=June |pmid=1675378 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)93206-O}} Later publications distinguish between "syndrome" and "infarct", based on evidence from imaging. "Syndrome" may be replaced by "hemorrhage" if imaging demonstrates a bleed.

===Hemorrhagic===
{{Main|Intracranial hemorrhage|intracerebral hemorrhage}}
[[File:Parachemableedwithedema.png|thumb|An intraparenchymal bleed (bottom arrow) with surrounding edema (top arrow)]]
Intracranial hemorrhage is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the skull vault. A distinction is made between [[intra-axial hemorrhage]] (blood inside the brain) and [[extra-axial hemorrhage]] (blood inside the skull but outside the brain). Intra-axial hemorrhage is due to [[intraparenchymal hemorrhage]] or [[intraventricular hemorrhage]] (blood in the ventricular system). The main types of extra-axial hemorrhage are [[epidural hematoma]] (bleeding between the [[dura mater]] and the skull), [[subdural hematoma]] (in the [[subdural space]]) and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (between the [[arachnoid mater]] and [[pia mater]]). Most of the hemorrhagic stroke syndromes have specific symptoms (e.g., [[headache]], previous [[head injury]]).

==Signs and symptoms==
Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms.  For example, in intracranial hemorrhage, the affected area may compress other structures. Most forms of stroke are not associated with [[headache]], apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage.

===Early recognition===
Various systems have been proposed to increase recognition of stroke. Different findings are able to predict the presence or absence of stroke to different degrees. Sudden-onset face weakness, arm drift (i.e., if a person, when asked to raise both arms, involuntarily lets one arm drift downward) and abnormal speech are the findings most likely to lead to the correct identification of a case of stroke increasing the likelihood by 5.5 when at least one of these is present).  Similarly, when all three of these are absent, the likelihood of stroke is significantly decreased (– [[likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing|likelihood ratio]] of 0.39).<ref name="pmid15900010">{{cite journal |author=Goldstein LB, Simel DL |title=Is this patient having a stroke? |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=19 |pages=2391–402 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15900010 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.19.2391}}</ref> While these findings are not perfect for diagnosing stroke, the fact that they can be evaluated relatively rapidly and easily make them very valuable in the acute setting.

Proposed systems include [[FAST (stroke)|FAST]] (face, arm, speech, and time),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harbison J, Massey A, Barnett L, Hodge D, Ford GA |title=Rapid ambulance protocol for acute stroke |journal=Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9168 |pages=1935 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10371574 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)00966-6}}</ref> as advocated by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)]] and the [[Stroke Association]], the American Stroke Association, the National Stroke Association (US), the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kidwell CS, Saver JL, Schubert GB, Eckstein M, Starkman S |title=Design and retrospective analysis of the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) |journal=Prehospital Emergency Care |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=267–73 |year=1998 |pmid=9799012 |doi=10.1080/10903129808958878}}</ref> and the [[Cincinnati Stroke Scale|Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale]] (CPSS).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kothari RU, Pancioli A, Liu T, Brott T, Broderick J |title=Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale: reproducibility and validity |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=373–8 |year=1999 |month=April |pmid=10092713 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(99)70299-4}}</ref> Use of these scales is recommended by professional guidelines.<ref name=NICECG68>{{NICE|68|Stroke|2008}}</ref>

For people referred to the [[emergency room]], early recognition of stroke is deemed important as this can expedite diagnostic tests and treatments. A scoring system called ROSIER (recognition of stroke in the emergency room) is recommended for this purpose; it is based on features from the medical history and physical examination.<ref name=NICECG68/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Nor AM |title=The Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale: development and validation of a stroke recognition instrument |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=727–34 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16239179 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70201-5 |author-separator=, |author2=Davis J |author3=Sen B |display-authors=3 |last4=Shipsey |first4=Dean |last5=Louw |first5=Stephen J |last6=Dyker |first6=Alexander G |last7=Davis |first7=Michelle |last8=Ford |first8=Gary A}}</ref>

===Subtypes===
If the area of the brain affected contains one of the three prominent [[Neural pathway|central nervous system pathways]]—the [[spinothalamic tract]], [[corticospinal tract]], and [[dorsal column]] ([[medial lemniscus]]), symptoms may include:
* [[hemiplegia]] and [[central facial palsy|muscle weakness of the face]]
* numbness
* reduction in sensory or vibratory sensation
* initial [[flaccidity]] (hypotonicity), replaced by [[spasticity]] (hypertonicity), [[hyperreflexia]], and obligatory synergies.<ref name=OSul07_719>{{cite book | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Susan.B | title = Physical Rehabilitation | chapter = Stroke | volume = 5 | editors = O'Sullivan, S.B., and Schmitz, T.J. | publisher = F.A. Davis Company | year = 2007 | location = Philadelphia | page = 719 |ref=harv}}</ref>

In most cases, the symptoms affect only one side of the body ([[unilateral]]).  Depending on the part of the brain affected,  the defect in the brain is ''usually'' on the opposite side of the body.  However, since these pathways also travel in the [[spinal cord]] and any lesion there can also produce these symptoms, the presence of any one of these symptoms does not necessarily indicate a stroke.

In addition to the above CNS pathways, the ''[[brainstem]]'' gives rise to most of the twelve [[cranial nerves]]. A stroke affecting the brain stem and brain therefore can produce symptoms relating to deficits in these cranial nerves:
* altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision (total or partial)
* drooping of eyelid ([[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]) and weakness of [[Extraocular muscles|ocular muscles]]
* decreased reflexes: gag, swallow, pupil reactivity to light
* decreased sensation and muscle weakness of the face
* [[Balance disorder|balance problems]] and [[nystagmus]]
* altered breathing and heart rate
* weakness in [[sternocleidomastoid muscle]] with inability to turn head to one side
* weakness in tongue (inability to protrude and/or move from side to side)

If the ''[[cerebral cortex]]'' is involved, the CNS pathways can again be affected, but also can produce the following symptoms:
* [[aphasia]] (difficulty with verbal expression, auditory comprehension, reading and/or writing  [[Broca's area|Broca's]] or [[Wernicke's area]] typically involved)
* [[dysarthria]] (motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury)
* [[apraxia]] (altered voluntary movements)
* [[visual field]] defect
* memory deficits (involvement of [[temporal lobe]])
* [[hemineglect]] (involvement of [[parietal lobe]])
* disorganized thinking, confusion, [[hypersexual]] gestures (with involvement of frontal lobe)
* [[anosognosia|lack of insight]] of his or her, usually stroke-related, disability

If the ''[[cerebellum]]'' is involved, the patient may have the following:
* altered walking [[Gait (human)|gait]]
* altered movement coordination
* [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and or disequilibrium

===Associated symptoms===
[[Unconsciousness|Loss of consciousness]], headache, and vomiting usually occurs more often in hemorrhagic stroke than in thrombosis because of the increased intracranial pressure from the leaking blood compressing the brain.

If symptoms are maximal at onset, the cause is more likely to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage or an embolic stroke.

==Causes==

===Thrombotic stroke===
In thrombotic stroke a thrombus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/18120.htm|publisher= U.S. National Library of Medicine |work=MedlinePlus |title=Thrombus}}</ref> (blood clot) usually forms around [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower. A thrombus itself (even if non-occluding) can lead to an embolic stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off, at which point it is called an "embolus." Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke:
* ''Large vessel disease'' involves the common and [[internal carotid artery|internal carotids]], [[vertebral artery|vertebral]], and the [[Circle of Willis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strokecenter.org/professionals/brain-anatomy/blood-vessels-of-the-brain/|publisher=The Internet Stroke Center|title=Circle of Willis}}</ref> Diseases that may form [[thrombi]] in the large vessels include (in descending incidence): atherosclerosis, [[vasoconstriction]] (tightening of the artery), [[Aortic dissection|aortic]], [[carotid artery dissection|carotid]] or [[vertebral artery dissection]], various inflammatory diseases of the blood vessel wall ([[Takayasu arteritis]], [[giant cell arteritis]], [[vasculitis]]), noninflammatory vasculopathy, [[Moyamoya disease]] and [[fibromuscular dysplasia]].
* ''Small vessel disease'' involves the smaller arteries inside the brain: branches of the [[circle of Willis]], middle cerebral artery, stem, and arteries arising from the distal vertebral and [[basilar artery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/aneurysm/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=[[National Health Service|NHS]] Choices |title=Brain anaurysm - Introduction}}</ref> Diseases that may form thrombi in the small vessels include (in descending incidence): [[lipohyalinosis]] (build-up of fatty hyaline matter in the blood vessel as a result of high blood pressure and aging) and [[fibrinoid degeneration]] (stroke involving these vessels are known as [[lacunar infarcts]]) and microatheroma (small atherosclerotic plaques).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=CM|title=The arterial lesions underlying lacunes|journal=Acta Neuropathologica|date=1968-12-18|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–15|pmid=5708546|doi=10.1007/BF00685305}}</ref>

[[Sickle-cell disease|Sickle-cell anemia]], which can cause [[blood cell]]s to clump up and block blood vessels, can also lead to stroke. A stroke is the second leading killer of people under 20 who suffer from sickle-cell anemia.<ref name="NINDS1999"/>

===Embolic stroke===
An embolic stroke refers to the blockage of an artery by an [[arterial embolism|arterial embolus]], a travelling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating from elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, but it can also be a number of other substances including [[fat]] (e.g., from [[bone marrow]] in a [[Bone fracture|broken bone]]), air, [[cancer]] cells or clumps of [[bacteria]] (usually from infectious [[endocarditis]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Because an embolus arises from elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily. Thus, the source of the embolus must be identified. Because the embolic blockage is sudden in onset, symptoms usually are maximal at start. Also, symptoms may be transient as the embolus is partially resorbed and moves to a different location or dissipates altogether.

Emboli most commonly arise from the [[heart]] (especially in [[atrial fibrillation]]) but may originate from elsewhere in the arterial tree. In [[paradoxical embolism]], a [[deep vein thrombosis]] embolises through an [[atrial septal defect|atrial]] or [[ventricular septal defect]] in the heart into the brain.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Cardiac causes can be distinguished between high and low-risk:<ref name="ay">{{cite journal |author=Ay H, Furie KL, Singhal A, Smith WS, Sorensen AG, Koroshetz WJ |title=An evidence-based causative classification system for acute ischemic stroke |journal=Annals of Neurology |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=688–97 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16240340 |doi=10.1002/ana.20617}}</ref>
* High risk: atrial fibrillation and [[paroxysmal atrial fibrillation]], [[Rheumatic fever|rheumatic disease]] of the [[mitral valve|mitral]] or [[aortic valve]] disease, [[artificial heart valve]]s, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, [[sick sinus syndrome]], sustained [[atrial flutter]], recent myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction together with [[ejection fraction]] <28 percent, symptomatic [[congestive heart failure]] with ejection fraction <30 percent, [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], [[Libman-Sacks endocarditis]], [[Marantic endocarditis]], [[infective endocarditis]], [[papillary fibroelastoma]], [[atrial myxoma|left atrial myxoma]] and [[coronary artery bypass graft]] (CABG) surgery.
* Low risk/potential: calcification of the annulus (ring) of the mitral valve, patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal aneurysm, atrial septal aneurysm ''with'' patent foramen ovale, left ventricular aneurysm without thrombus, isolated left atrial "smoke" on [[echocardiography]] (no [[mitral stenosis]] or atrial fibrillation), complex atheroma in the [[ascending aorta]] or proximal arch.

===Systemic hypoperfusion===
Systemic hypoperfusion is the reduction of blood flow to all parts of the body. It is most commonly due to [[heart failure]] from [[cardiac arrest]] or arrhythmias, or from reduced [[cardiac output]] as a result of [[myocardial infarction]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[pericardial effusion]], or bleeding.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxemia]] (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the hypoperfusion. Because the reduction in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially "watershed" areas - border zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A [[watershed stroke]] refers to the condition when blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur.

===Venous thrombosis===
[[Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis]] leads to stroke due to locally increased venous pressure, which exceeds the pressure generated by the arteries. Infarcts are more likely to undergo hemorrhagic transformation (leaking of blood into the damaged area) than other types of ischemic stroke.<ref name=Stam2005/>

===Intracerebral hemorrhage===
It generally occurs in small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/jhypertension/Abstract/1996/10003/Hypertension_and_stroke.5.aspx|title=Hypertension}}</ref> intracranial vascular malformations (including [[cavernous angioma]]s or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s), cerebral [[amyloid angiopathy]], or infarcts into which secondary haemorrhage has occurred.<ref name=Donnan/> Other potential causes are trauma, [[Haemophilia|bleeding disorders]], [[amyloid angiopathy]], [[Recreational drug use|illicit drug use]] (e.g., amphetamines or [[cocaine]]). The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the [[ventricular system]], [[cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] or the pial surface. A third of intracerebral bleed is into the brain's ventricles. ICH has a [[mortality rate]] of 44 percent after 30 days, higher than ischemic stroke or [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (which technically may also be classified as a type of stroke<ref name=Donnan/>).

===Silent stroke===
A [[silent stroke]] is a stroke that does not have any outward symptoms, and the patients are typically unaware they have suffered a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, a silent stroke still causes damage to the brain, and places the patient at increased risk for both [[transient ischemic attack]] and major stroke in the future. Conversely, those who have suffered a major stroke are also at risk of having silent strokes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miwa K |title=Silent cerebral infarction is associated with incident stroke and TIA independent of carotid intima-media thickness |journal=Intern.

Since blood vessels in the brain are now occluded, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts into using [[anaerobic metabolism]] within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Unfortunately, this kind of metabolism produces less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but releases a by-product called [[lactic acid]]. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal acid-base balance in the brain. The ischemia area is referred to as the "ischemic [[penumbra (medicine)|penumbra]]".<ref>Brunner and Suddarth's Textbook on Medical-Surgical Nursing, 11th Edition</ref>

Then, as oxygen or glucose becomes depleted in ischemic brain tissue, the production of [[high energy phosphate]] compounds such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fails, leading to failure of energy-dependent processes (such as ion pumping) necessary for tissue cell survival. This sets off a series of interrelated events that result in cellular injury and death. A major cause of neuronal injury is release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The concentration of glutamate outside the cells of the nervous system is normally kept low by so-called uptake carriers, which are powered by the concentration gradients of ions (mainly Na<sup>+</sup>) across the cell membrane. However, stroke cuts off the supply of oxygen and glucose which powers the ion pumps maintaining these gradients. As a result the transmembrane ion gradients run down, and glutamate transporters reverse their direction, releasing glutamate into the extracellular space. Glutamate acts on receptors in nerve cells (especially NMDA receptors), producing an influx of calcium which activates enzymes that digest the cells' proteins, lipids and nuclear material. Calcium influx can also lead to the failure of [[mitochondria]], which can lead further toward energy depletion and may trigger cell death due to apoptosis.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Ischemia also induces production of [[Radical (chemistry)|oxygen free radicals]] and other [[reactive oxygen species]]. These react with and damage a number of cellular and extracellular elements. Damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium is particularly important. In fact, many antioxidant neuroprotectants such as [[uric acid]] and [[NXY-059]] work at the level of the endothelium and not in the brain ''per se''. Free radicals also directly initiate elements of the apoptosis cascade by means of [[redox signaling]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

These processes are the same for any type of ischemic tissue and are referred to collectively as the ''ischemic cascade''. However, brain tissue is especially vulnerable to ischemia since it has little respiratory reserve and is completely dependent on [[aerobic metabolism]], unlike most other organs.

In addition to injurious effects on brain cells, ischemia and infarction can result in loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels, partly through the release of matrix metalloproteases, which are zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that break down collagen, [[Hyaluronan|hyaluronic acid]], and other elements of [[connective tissue]]. Other proteases also contribute to this process. The loss of vascular structural integrity results in a breakdown of the protective [[blood brain barrier]] that contributes to [[cerebral edema]], which can cause secondary progression of the brain injury.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Hemorrhagic===
Hemorrhagic strokes result in tissue injury by causing compression of tissue from an expanding hematoma or hematomas. This can distort and injure tissue. In addition, the pressure may lead to a loss of blood supply to affected tissue with resulting infarction, and the blood released by brain hemorrhage appears to have direct toxic effects on brain tissue and vasculature.<ref name="NINDS1999"/><ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20713126] Wang J.: Preclinical and clinical research on inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage</ref> Inflammation contributes to the secondary brain injury after hemorrhage.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:StrokeMCA.png|thumb|A CT showing early signs of a middle cerebral artery stroke with loss of definition of the gyri and grey white boundary]]
Stroke is diagnosed through several techniques: a neurological examination (such as the [[NIHSS]]), CT scans (most often without contrast enhancements) or [[MRI scan]]s, [[Doppler ultrasound]], and [[arteriography]]. The diagnosis of stroke itself is clinical, with assistance from the imaging techniques. Imaging techniques also assist in determining the subtypes and cause of stroke. There is yet no commonly used [[blood test]] for the stroke diagnosis itself, though blood tests may be of help in finding out the likely cause of stroke.<ref name="hill2005">{{cite journal |author=Hill MD |title=Diagnostic biomarkers for stroke: a stroke neurologist's perspective |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=2001–2 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16244286 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2005.056382}}</ref>

=== Definition ===
The traditional definition of stroke, devised by the [[World Health Organization]] in the 1970s,<ref>{{cite book |author=World Health Organisation |title=Cerebrovascular Disorders (Offset Publications) |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year= 1978|pages= |isbn=92-4-170043-2 |oclc= 4757533|doi=}}</ref> is a "neurological deficit of cerebrovascular cause that persists beyond 24 hours or is interrupted by death within 24 hours". This definition was supposed to reflect the reversibility of tissue damage and was devised for the purpose, with the time frame of 24 hours being chosen arbitrarily. The 24-hour limit divides stroke from [[transient ischemic attack]], which is a related syndrome of stroke symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours.<ref name=Donnan/> With the availability of treatments that, when given early, can reduce stroke severity, many now prefer alternative concepts, such as brain attack and acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome (modeled after [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[acute coronary syndrome]], respectively), that reflect the urgency of stroke symptoms and the need to act swiftly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kidwell CS, Warach S |title=Acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome: diagnostic criteria |journal=Stroke |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=2995–8 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14605325|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000098902.69855.A9}}</ref>

===Physical examination===
A [[physical examination]], including taking a [[medical history]] of the symptoms and a neurological status, helps giving an evaluation of the location and severity of a stroke. It can give a standard score on e.g., the [[NIH stroke scale]].

===Imaging===
For diagnosing ischemic stroke in the emergency setting:<ref name="pmid17258669">{{cite journal |author=Chalela JA |title=Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography in emergency assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke: a prospective comparison |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9558 |pages=293–8 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17258669 |pmc=1859855 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60151-2 |author-separator=, |author2=Kidwell CS |author3=Nentwich LM |display-authors=3 |last4=Luby |first4=Marie |last5=Butman |first5=John A |last6=Demchuk |first6=Andrew M |last7=Hill |first7=Michael D |last8=Patronas |first8=Nicholas |last9=Latour |first9=Lawrence}}</ref>

For the assessment of stable stroke, nuclear medicine scans SPECT and PET/CT may be helpful. SPECT documents cerebral blood flow and PET with FDG isotope the metabolic activity of the neurons.

===Underlying cause===
[[File:Left MCA Stroke.png|thumb|12-lead ECG of a patient with a stroke, showing large deeply inverted [[T wave|T-waves]]. Various ECG changes may occur in people with strokes and other brain disorders.]]
When a stroke has been diagnosed, various other studies may be performed to determine the underlying cause. With the current treatment and diagnosis options available, it is of particular importance to determine whether there is a peripheral source of emboli. Test selection may vary, since the cause of stroke varies with age, [[comorbidity]] and the clinical presentation. Commonly used techniques include:
* an [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound/doppler study]] of the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]] (to detect [[carotid stenosis]]) or dissection of the precerebral arteries;
* an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) and [[echocardiogram]] (to identify [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]] and resultant clots in the heart which may spread to the brain vessels through the bloodstream);
* a [[Holter monitor]] study to identify intermittent arrhythmias;
* an [[angiogram]] of the cerebral vasculature (if a bleed is thought to have originated from an [[aneurysm]] or [[arteriovenous malformation]]);
* blood tests to determine hypercholesterolemia, [[bleeding diathesis]] and some rarer causes such as [[homocysteinuria]].

====Anticoagulation drugs====
Oral anticoagulants such as [[warfarin]] have been the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several studies have shown that aspirin and antiplatelet drugs are highly effective in [[secondary prevention]] after a stroke or transient ischemic attack.<ref name="AP01" /> Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150&nbsp;mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown.<ref name="pmid10371234">{{cite journal |author=Johnson ES, Lanes SF, Wentworth CE, Satterfield MH, Abebe BL, Dicker LW |title=A metaregression analysis of the dose-response effect of aspirin on stroke |journal=Arch.

===Secondary prevention===

Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined according to the [[CHADS Score|CHADS/CHADS2 system]]. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent [[warfarin]] while [[dabigatran]] is a new alternative which does not require [[prothrombin time]] monitoring.

If studies show carotid stenosis, and the patient has residual function in the affected side, carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after stroke.

==Management==

===Ischemic stroke===
Definitive therapy is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down ([[thrombolysis]]), or by removing it mechanically ([[thrombectomy]]). The more rapidly blood flow is restored to the brain, the fewer brain cells die.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Saver JL |title=Time is brain - quantified |journal=Stroke |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=263–6 |year=2006 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/01.STR.0000196957.55928.abv1 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000196957.55928.ab |pmid=16339467}}</ref>

Tight control of blood sugars in the first few hours does not improve outcomes and may cause harm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bellolio|first=MF|coauthors=Gilmore, RM, Stead, LG|title=Insulin for glycaemic control in acute ischaemic stroke|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2011-09-07|volume=9|pages=CD005346|pmid=21901697|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005346.pub3|editor1-last=Bellolio|editor1-first=M Fernanda|issue=9}}</ref> High blood pressure is also not typically lowered as this has not been found to be helpful.

====Thrombolysis====
Thrombolysis with [[tissue plasminogen activator|recombinant tissue plasminogen activator]] (rtPA) in acute ischemic stroke, when given before three hours of symptom onset increases the risk of death in the short term but in the long term improves the rate of independence and late mortality; the increase in long term mortality is not significant.<ref name=Lancet2012>{{cite journal|last=Wardlaw|first=JM|coauthors=Murray V, Berge E, Del Zoppo G, Sandercock P, Lindley RL, Cohen G|title=Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischaemic stroke: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Lancet|date=2012 May 23|volume=Online first|pmid=22632907|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60738-7}}</ref> When broken down by time to treatment it increases the chance of being alive and living independently by 9% in those treated within three hours, however the benefit for those treated between three and six hours is not significant.<ref name=Lancet2012/> These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated.<ref name=Lancet2012/> There is no realiable way to determine who will have an intracranial hemorrhage post treatment versus who will not.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whiteley|first=WN|coauthors=Slot, KB; Fernandes, P; Sandercock, P; Wardlaw, J|title=Risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 55 studies.|journal=Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation|date=2012 Nov|volume=43|issue=11|pages=2904–9|pmid=22996959}}</ref>

Its use is endorsed by the [[American Heart Association]] and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms as long as there are not other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators<ref>{{cite journal |author= The National Institute Of Neurological Disorders And Stroke Rt-Pa Stroke Study Group,|title=Tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke.

====Hemicraniectomy====
Large territory strokes can cause significant edema of the brain with secondary brain injury in surrounding tissue. This phenomenon is mainly encountered in strokes of the middle cerebral artery territory, and is also called "malignant cerebral infaction" because it carries a dismal prognosis. Relief of the pressure may be attempted with medication, but some require [[hemicraniectomy]], the temporary surgical removal of the skull on one side of the head. This decreases the risk of death, although some more people survive with disability who would otherwise have died.<ref name="pmid21190097">{{cite journal |author=Simard JM, Sahuquillo J, Sheth KN, Kahle KT, Walcott BP |title=Managing malignant cerebral infarction |journal=Curr Treat Options Neurol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=217–29 |year=2011 |month=April |pmid=21190097 |pmc=3243953 |doi=10.1007/s11940-010-0110-9}}</ref>

===Hemorrhagic stroke===
People with [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] require [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] evaluation to detect and treat the cause of the bleeding, although many may not need surgery. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics, key in treating ischemic stroke, can make bleeding worse. People are monitored for changes in the level of consciousness, and their blood pressure, blood sugar, and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Stroke unit===
Ideally, people who have had a stroke are admitted to a "stroke unit", a ward or dedicated area in hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment. It has been shown that people admitted to a stroke unit have a higher chance of surviving than those admitted elsewhere in hospital, even if they are being cared for by doctors without experience in stroke.<ref name=Donnan/>

When an acute stroke is suspected by history and physical examination, the goal of early assessment is to determine the cause. Treatment varies according to the underlying cause of the stroke, thromboembolic (ischemic) or hemorrhagic.

===Rehabilitation===
[[Stroke rehabilitation]] is the process by which those with disabling strokes undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. It also aims to help the survivor understand and adapt to difficulties, prevent secondary complications and educate family members to play a supporting role.

A rehabilitation team is usually multidisciplinary as it involves staff with different skills working together to help the person. These include nursing staff, [[physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapists]], [[speech and language therapists]], [[orthotists]] and usually a [[physician]] trained in [[rehabilitation medicine]]. Some teams may also include [[psychologists]], [[social work]]ers, and [[pharmacist]]s since at least one third of the people manifest [[post stroke depression]]. Validated instruments such as the [[Barthel scale]] may be used to assess the likelihood of a stroke patient being able to manage at home with or without support subsequent to discharge from hospital.

Good [[nursing care]] is fundamental in maintaining [[Skin|skin care]], feeding, hydration, positioning, and monitoring [[vital signs]] such as temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Stroke rehabilitation begins almost immediately.

For most people with stroke, [[physical therapy]] (PT), [[occupational therapy]] (OT) and [[speech-language pathology]] (SLP) are the cornerstones of the rehabilitation process. Often, [[assistive technology]] such as [[wheelchairs]], walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved by the use of [[ankle foot orthoses]].<ref>http://www.stroke.scot.nhs.uk/docs/UseOfAnkle-FootOrthosesFollowingStroke.pdf</ref> PT and OT have overlapping areas of expertise, however PT focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and re-learning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with patients to improve awareness and use of the [[hemiplegic]] side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and patient’s goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote [[motor learning]] involves [[constraint-induced movement therapy]]. Through continuous practice the patient relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Sullivan|2007|pp=471, 484, 737, 740}}</ref> OT is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the [[Activities of daily living]] (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. [[Speech and language therapy]] is appropriate for patients with the speech production disorders: dysarthria and apraxia of speech, aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments and/or dysphagia (problems with swallowing).

Patients may have particular problems, such as [[dysphagia]], which can cause swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause [[aspiration pneumonia]]. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogastric tube]] may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy]] (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely.

Treatment of spasticity related to stroke often involves early mobilisations, commonly performed by a physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through various positioning.<ref name=OSul07_719>{{harvnb|O'Sullivan|2007|p=719}}</ref> Gaining initial improvements in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb.<ref name=OSul07_719/> After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb with the use of splints or other tools to stabilize the joint.<ref name=OSul07_719/> Cold in the form of ice wraps or ice packs have been proven to briefly reduce spasticity by temporarily dampening neural firing rates.<ref name=OSul07_719/> Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success.<ref name=OSul07_719/>

[[Stroke rehabilitation]] should be started as quickly as possible and can last anywhere from a few days to over a year. Most return of function is seen in the first few months, and then improvement falls off with the "window" considered officially by [[U.S. state]] rehabilitation units and others to be closed after six months, with little chance of further improvement. However, patients have been known to continue to improve for years, regaining and strengthening abilities like writing, walking, running, and talking. Daily rehabilitation exercises should continue to be part of the stroke patient's routine. Complete recovery is unusual but not impossible and most patients will improve to some extent: proper diet and exercise are known to help the brain to recover.

Some current and future therapy methods include the use of [[virtual reality]] and video games for rehabilitation. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating patients to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not.<ref name=Lange>{{cite journal|last=B. Lange, S. Flynn & A.

Other novel non-invasive rehabilitation methods are currently being developed to augment physical therapy to improve motor function of stroke patients, such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) and [[transcranial direct-current stimulation]] (tDCS)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fregni|first=F|coauthors=Pascual-Leone A|title=Technology Insight: noninvasive brain stimulation in neurology—perspectives on the therapeutic potential of rTMS and tDCS|journal=Nature Clinical Practice Neurology|year=2007|volume=3|issue=7|pages=383–393|doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0530|pmid=17611487}}</ref> and [[robotic therapies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Balasubramanian|first=S|coauthors=Klein J, Burdet E.|title=Robot-assisted rehabilitation of hand function|journal=Curr Opin Neurol.|volume=23|issue=6|pages=661–70|doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e32833e99a4|pmid=20852421|year=2010}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Disability affects 75% of stroke survivors enough to decrease their employability.<!--

Stroke can affect peoples physically, mentally, emotionally, or a combination of the three. The results of stroke vary widely depending on size and location of the lesion.<!--

Dysfunctions correspond to areas in the brain that have been damaged.

Some of the physical disabilities that can result from stroke include muscle weakness, numbness, [[pressure sore]]s, [[pneumonia]], [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], [[apraxia]] (inability to perform learned movements), difficulties carrying out daily activities, appetite loss, [[aphasia|speech loss]], [[vision loss]], and [[pain]]. If the stroke is severe enough, or in a certain location such as parts of the brainstem, [[coma]] or death can result.

Emotional problems resulting from stroke can result from direct damage to emotional centers in the brain or from frustration and difficulty adapting to new limitations. Post-stroke emotional difficulties include [[anxiety]], [[panic attack]]s, [[flat affect]] (failure to express emotions), [[mania]], [[apathy]], and [[psychosis]].

30 to 50% of stroke survivors suffer post stroke depression, which is characterized by lethargy, irritability, [[Sleep disorder|sleep disturbances]], lowered [[Self-esteem|self esteem]], and withdrawal.<!--

[[Clinical depression|Depression]] can reduce motivation and worsen outcome, but can be treated with [[antidepressant]]s.

[[Emotional lability]], another consequence of stroke, causes the patient to switch quickly between emotional highs and lows and to express emotions inappropriately, for instance with an excess of laughing or crying with little or no provocation. While these expressions of emotion usually correspond to the patient's actual emotions, a more severe form of emotional lability causes patients to laugh and cry pathologically, without regard to context or emotion.<!--
 --><ref name="Coffey2000"/>
Some patients show the opposite of what they feel, for example crying when they are happy.<!--

Emotional lability occurs in about 20% of stroke patients.

Cognitive deficits resulting from stroke include perceptual disorders, [[Aphasia]], [[dementia]], and problems with attention and memory. A stroke sufferer may be unaware of his or her own disabilities, a condition called [[anosognosia]]. In a condition called [[hemispatial neglect]], a patient is unable to attend to anything on the side of space opposite to the damaged hemisphere.

Up to 10% of people following a stroke develop [[seizure]]s, most commonly in the week subsequent to the event; the severity of the stroke increases the likelihood of a seizure.<ref name=Reith1997>{{cite journal |author=Reith J, Jørgensen HS, Nakayama H, Raaschou HO, Olsen TS |title=Seizures in acute stroke: predictors and prognostic significance.

[[File:Hippocrates.jpg|thumb|[[Hippocrates]] first described the sudden paralysis that is often associated with stroke.]]

The word ''stroke'' was used as a synonym for apoplectic [[seizure]] as early as 1599,<ref>R. Barnhart, ed. ''The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology'' (1995)</ref> and is a fairly literal translation of the Greek term.

In 1658, in his ''Apoplexia'', [[Johann Jakob Wepfer|Johann Jacob Wepfer]] (1620–1695) identified the cause of [[hemorrhagic]] stroke when he suggested that people who had [[died]] of apoplexy had bleeding in their brains.<!--
 --><ref name="Stroke1996-Thompson"/><!--
 --><ref name="NINDS1999"/>
Wepfer also identified the main [[arteries]] supplying the brain, the [[vertebral]] and [[carotid]] arteries, and identified the cause of [[ischemic]] stroke [also known as [[cerebral infarction]]] when he suggested that [[apoplexy]] might be caused by a blockage to those vessels.<!--
 --><ref name="NINDS1999"/>

[[Rudolf Virchow]] first described the mechanism of [[thromboembolism]] as a major factor.<ref name="pmid4914683">{{cite journal |author=Schiller F |title=Concepts of stroke before and after Virchow |journal=Med Hist |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=115–31 |year=1970 |month=April |pmid=4914683 |pmc=1034034}}</ref>

==Research==

===Angioplasty and stenting===
[[Angioplasty]] and [[stent]]ing have begun to be looked at as possible viable options in treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Intra-cranial stenting in symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, the rate of technical success (reduction to stenosis of <50%) ranged from 90-98%, and the rate of major peri-procedural complications ranged from 4-10%.  The rates of restenosis and/or stroke following the treatment were also favorable.<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |author=Derdeyn CP, Chimowitz MI|title=Angioplasty and Stenting for Atherosclerotic Intracranial Stenosis: Rationale for a Randomized Clinical Trial|journal=Neuroimaging Clin.

===Neuroprotection===
Brain tissue survival can be improved to some extent if one or more of these processes is inhibited. Drugs that scavenge [[reactive oxygen species]], inhibit [[apoptosis]], or inhibit excitatory neurotransmitters, for example, have been shown experimentally to reduce tissue injury caused by ischemia. Agents that work in this way are referred to as being ''neuroprotective''. Until recently, human [[clinical trial]]s with neuroprotective agents have failed, with the probable exception of deep [[barbiturate coma]]. However, more recently [[NXY-059]], the disulfonyl derivative of the radical-scavengin phenylbutylnitrone, is reported to be neuroprotective in stroke.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lees KR |title=NXY-059 for acute ischemic stroke |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=6 |pages=588–600 |year=2006|month=February |pmid=16467546 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052980 |author-separator=, |author2=Zivin JA |author3=Ashwood T|display-authors=3 |last4=Davalos |first4=Antonio |last5=Davis |first5=Stephen M. |last6=Diener |first6=Hans-Christoph|last7=Grotta |first7=James |last8=Lyden |first8=Patrick |last9=Shuaib |first9=Ashfaq}}</ref> This agent appears to work at the level of the blood vessel lining or endothelium. Unfortunately, after producing favorable results in one large-scale clinical trial, a second trial failed to show favorable results.<ref name="NINDS1999"/> Benefit of NXY-059 is questionable.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koziol|first=JA|coauthors=Feng, AC|title=On the analysis and interpretation of outcome measures in stroke clinical trials: lessons from the SAINT I study of NXY-059 for acute ischemic stroke.|journal=Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation|date=2006 Oct|volume=37|issue=10|pages=2644–7|pmid=16946150|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000241106.81293.2b}}</ref>
