Recognizing the efforts of [[Rotary International]], who contributed about $12&nbsp;million to the cause, the government of Pakistan issued a postage stamp on the hundredth anniversary of that organization in December 2000.

In March 2001 about 27&nbsp;million children were vaccinated across the country, in the hope that Pakistan could be virus-free by the end of that year.<ref name="March 2001 campaign">{{cite journal|title=Pakistani Rotarians help immunize 27&nbsp;million children in NIDs|journal=The Rotarian|year=2001|month=May|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=qTIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&dq=Pakistan+polio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QKjDT_6uAomWOtnWyNwJ&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Pakistan%20polio&f=false|accessdate=28 May 2012|editor1-first=Cary|editor1-last=Silver|page=54|publisher=Rotarian International|id=ISBN: S5LQ-BE8-DD3Q}}</ref>

==Factors affecting eradication==
After the [[September 11 attacks]], a myth arose in Pakistan that the United States was using immunization campaigns to sterilize the local population. Health officials tried to dispel this story, but their efforts, in the opinion of Heidi Larson, writing in ''The Guardian'', were marred by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), when it conducted a fake [[Hepatitis B]] immunization campaign in [[Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad compound|Bin Laden's residence]] in [[Bilal Town]] at [[Abbottabad]] with the help of Dr. [[Shakil Afridi]].<ref name="Heidi Larson"/> The intention of the campaign was to confirm [[Osama bin Laden]]'s presence in the city by obtaining [[DNA]] samples from children suspected of being his.<ref name="BBC20111006">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15206639|title=Bin Laden death: 'CIA doctor' accused of treason|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> In a letter written to CIA director [[Leon Panetta]], the InterAction Alliance, a union of about 200 US-based Non-Government Organizations, deplored the actions of the CIA in using a vaccination campaign as a cover.<ref name="Dawn: NGO assail CIA">{{cite news|author=Imran Ali Teepu|title=American NGOs assail CIA over fake polio drive|url=http://dawn.com/2012/03/02/american-ngos-assail-cia-over-fake-polio-drive/|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=2 March 2012}}</ref> The effect of the fake vaccination campaign in reducing polio program cooperation became evident when the world's highest number of polio cases (198)<ref name="WHO rejects rumours"/><ref name="Orla Guerin">{{cite news|title='Emergency plan' to eradicate polio launched|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18186393|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2012|author=Orla Guerin}}</ref> were reported in Pakistan in 2011.<ref name="Saeed Shah">{{cite news|title=CIA tactics to trap Bin Laden linked with polio crisis, say aid groups|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/02/aid-groups-cia-osama-bin-laden-polio-crisis/print|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 March 2012|author=Saeed Shah}}</ref>

===Views of the WHO special envoy===
In a 2012 interview with Pakistani newspaper [[Dawn (newspaper)|''Dawn'']], Dr. Hussain A. Gezari, WHO’s special envoy on global polio eradication and primary healthcare, gave his views on obstacles to eradication. He said the biggest hurdle in making Pakistan polio-free was holding district health officials properly accountable—in national eradication campaigns officials had hired their own relatives, even young children.  "How do you expect a seven-year-old thumb-sucking kid to implement a polio campaign of the government," said Dr Gezari.  He added that, in spite of this, "the first national campaign was initiated by your government in 1994 and that year Pakistan reported 25,000 polio cases, and the number was just 198 last year, which clearly shows that the programme is working."<ref name="WHO rejects rumours"/>
