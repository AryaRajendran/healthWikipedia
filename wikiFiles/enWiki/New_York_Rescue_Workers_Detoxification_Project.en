The '''New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project''' was founded in [[New York City]] in 2003 with the purpose of treating rescue workers for toxins inhaled from the smoke of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name = "NYP">{{cite news | first = John | last = DeSio | title = The Rundown on Scientology’s Purification Rundown: What Scientologists aren't telling you about their detox program (and how much it’s costing you)| work = [[New York Press]] | date = May 31, 2007}}</ref> It has two clinics; Downtown Medical on Fulton Street, two blocks from the site of the [[World Trade Center]] and another at Williston Park, [[Long Island]].<ref name="slate" /><ref name="odonnell" /><ref name="whitely">{{cite news|title=Tom Cruise Opens Rescue Workers Detox Clinic|last=Whitely|first=Margaret|date=June 18, 2004|work=The Illustrated News (online edition)|publisher=Anton Newspapers}}</ref> The project's co-founder and top fundraiser is the actor and Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]].<ref name="NYP" /> It uses the [[Purification Rundown]], a "detoxification" program invented by [[L.

==Background==

===Scientologists criticise EPA===
Tom Cruise explained his motivation for setting up the project in a Scientology promotional video that leaked onto the internet in January 2008.<ref name="bostonglobe">{{cite news|work=Boston Globe| date=January 18, 2008 |title=Tom Cruise's 9/11 clean-up|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2008/01/18/tom_cruises_911_clean_up/ |accessdate=February 3, 2009}}</ref> The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] had stated after the World Trade Center attack that the air was safe to breathe. The video narration contradicted this, saying, "The devastation had spread an unprecedented combination of toxins through the air — and it was lethal."<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Post|date=January 18, 2008|title=Tom in Ground Zero tantrum}}</ref> Cruise is seen dismissing the EPA's all-clear:<ref name="bostonglobe" />
{{quote|"Of course, as a Scientologist, you go, that's a lie. Outright lie. Liar. Fine. Finally you say, dammit, just go there and do it. Put it there, let's go, here's the money, let's go. Let's just get one person treated. I can't sleep another night."}}

In an appearance on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Cruise said that he founded the project out of concern that 9/11 survivors would suffer [[leukemia]], [[parkinsonism]], [[multiple sclerosis]] or [[cancer]] as a result of toxins in their fatty tissue. He advocated Hubbard's "research" as the only way to deal with these problems, claiming, "Doctors do not know how to diagnose chemical exposures [...] You go to a doctor and now he's going to put you on more and more drugs, steroids and things that are ineffective."<ref>{{cite episode |title=Interview With Tom Cruise|series=Larry King Live |serieslink=Larry_King_Live |network=[[CNN]]|airdate=November 28, 2003}}</ref>

==="Detoxification" in Scientology===
{{Main|Purification Rundown}}
The "detoxification" program was created by [[L.

The project's clients were required to attend this programme three hours each day, for between twenty-one and forty days.<ref name="gittrich" /> This was promoted as a way to treat memory loss, [[respiratory disease|respiration problems]], fatigue and other problems suffered by the Ground Zero workers.<ref name="gittrich" />

==Finances and organization==
From 2003 to 2007, Downtown Medical received [[US$]]900,000 in public funding, including $630,000 from the [[New York City Council|City of New York]]. The project also received private funding, the biggest supporter being [[Tom Cruise]].<ref name ="NYP"/> Other celebrity donors included [[Paul Newman]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Adam Sandler]], [[Leah Remini]], [[Will Smith]] and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]].<ref name="dunleavy">{{cite news| first = Steve| last = Dunleavy| title = Cruise's Clinic OK| work = [[New York Post]] | date =June 12, 2007}}</ref> By late 2004, these donations amounted to $2.3 million. The detoxification program has  been offered for free to rescue workers, and also offered to other New York City residents, some of whom paid $5,000.<ref name="slate">{{cite news | first = Amanda | last = Schaffer | title = Poisons, Begone!

According to tax filings, the project pays on some of its money to two bodies, related to the [[Church of Scientology]], that promote the Purification Rundown. These are the [[Association for Better Living and Education]] (ABLE), which receives 5% of all contributions, and the Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education (FASE).<ref name="NYP" /> The Executive Director of the Church of Scientology was involved in creating the Foundation and later described it as a "front group".<ref name="welkos">{{cite news | last =Sappell | first =Joel | coauthors =Robert W.

==Endorsements and criticism==
The project had a mixed response from public officials. [[Margarita López]], a former member of [[New York City Council]], endorsed the program and helped it to win public funding. Subsequently, she received nearly $115,000 in campaign contributions from Scientologists.<ref name="backsoff">{{cite news| first=Mark | last=Sommer | title =Schumer backs off support for program | work=[[Buffalo News]] | date = August 6, 2005}}</ref><ref name="downtown">{{cite news|title=Margarita Lopez stays mum through Scientology flap |last=Schindler |first=Paul |url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_117/margaritalopezstays.html|work=Downtown Express|date=August 5, 2005 |volume=18|issue=11|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}</ref> Another councillor, [[Joseph Patrick Addabbo]] also supported the project, telling reporters, "The project seems to work. I've seen it firsthand."<ref name="seifman" /> Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] spoke out against Addabbo and López for their connections with the program,<ref name="NYP" /> saying that Scientology is "not science, and we should only fund those programs that reputable scientists believe will stand the light of day."<ref name=cbs>{{cite news|last=Bonawitz|first=Amy|title=Tom Cruise Raises Money For 9/11 Detox|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/20/entertainment/main2709335.shtml|accessdate=March 4, 2011|newspaper=CBSNews.com|date=April 20, 2007|publisher=CBS Interactive}}</ref><ref name="seifman">{{cite news | last = Seifman | first = David| title = Crui$e is 'Detox' of De Town | work = [[New York Post]]| date = April 20, 2007}}</ref>

Another supportive member of the City Council was [[Hiram Monserrate]]. Monserrate went through the program himself, and drafted official proclamations honoring both Tom Cruise and L.

The project's publicity included favorable quotations from [[Chuck Schumer|Senator Charles Schumer]] and from [[Michael Balboni]], New York's deputy secretary for Public Security, though Schumer later withdrew his support and Balboni denied ever making the statement.<ref name="NYP" /><ref name="backsoff" /> Council speaker [[Christine C.

Actress and radio show host [[Janeane Garofalo]] drew criticism by allowing Scientologist model and actress [[Leah Remini]] to promote the project on her [[Air America Radio]] show.<ref>{{cite news| first=Jeannette |last=Walls| url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12583654/ |title=Garofalo gushes over Scientology-linked project| work=MSNBC.com |date=May 2, 2006|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}</ref>

==Outcomes==
It was reported in October 2007 that 838 people had completed the program.<ref name="results" /> The clinic displayed towels with colored stains, as evidence that toxic material had been sweated out in the saunas. According to its Director, Jim Woodworth, during the Purification Rundown firefighters had passed odd-colored bowel movements and sweated out [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[aluminium]] and [[magnesium]].<ref name="gittrich" /> The Fire Department's chief medical officer, Dr. Kerry Kelly, criticized the lack of objective evidence, saying, "I have trouble believing in these purple-stained towels."<ref name="gittrich" />

An investigation by the ''[[New York Press]]'' asked a number of independent doctors about the evidence for the Purification Rundown. None of them endorsed the program's effectiveness and some explicitly described it as dangerous. Several said that no [[Peer review|peer-reviewed research]] on the rundown had been published in any medical journal. Some apparently supportive studies have been published, but these lack [[Scientific control|control groups]] and have other scientific failings.<ref name="NYP" /><ref name="slate"/> According to Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon, doctors investigating the program on behalf of the Fire Department concluded that it was not detoxifying.<ref name="gittrich">{{cite news|title=Bravest taking the Cruise cure |last=Gittrich|first=Greg|date=December 13, 2003 |work=New York Daily News|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031216055606/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/local/story/145576p-128631c.html |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/local/story/145576p-128631c.html |accessdate=February 22, 2009|archivedate=December 16, 2003}}</ref> [[University of Georgia]] bioterrorism expert Cham Dallas also denied that the procedure could detoxify, saying "It sounds great and they mean well, but it just doesn't work."<ref name="gilmore2004">{{cite news|title=Scientology ‘Detox’ Furor: clinic draws client raves and researcher jeers|last=Gilmore|first=Heather|date=August 15, 2004 |work=New York Post|accessdate=March 10, 2009 }}</ref>

In 2007, James Dahlgren and colleagues published a small-sample pilot study assessing the project.<ref name="dahlgren" /> Dahlgren is a doctor who promotes the Purification Rundown as a method of detoxification.<ref name="crouch" /> The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) and [[polychlorinated dibenzofurans]] (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime.<ref name="dahlgren">{{cite journal |journal=Chemosphere|volume=69 |issue=8 |month=October|year=2007| pages=1320–1325 | title=Persistent organic pollutants in 9/11 world trade center rescue workers: Reduction following detoxification |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.05.127 |first=James |last=Dahlgren |coauthors=Marie Cecchini, Harpreet Takhar, Olaf Paepke |pmid=17234251}}</ref> Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study.<ref name="crouch">{{cite journal |journal=Chemosphere|volume=69 |issue=8 |month=October|year=2007| pages=1330–1332| title=Comment on "Persistent organic pollutants in 9/11 world trade center rescue workers: Reduction following detoxification" by James Dahlgren, Marie Cecchini, Harpreet Takhar, and Olaf Paepke [Chemosphere 69/8 (2007) 1320–1325] |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.05.098 |first=Edmund A.

{{quote|"[W]ith few exceptions, people’s body burdens of PCBs and other 'dioxin-like compounds' are determined almost exclusively by the food we eat, not by the air we breathe. Firefighters may occasionally receive on-the-job exposures to PCBs and PCDFs, but these would be from having fought PCB-containing electrical transformer fires, not from 9/11."}}
The paper argues that the project never properly tested its outcomes and concludes that application of the "potentially dangerous" Purification Rundown to the health problems of 9/11 workers is "unconscionable".<ref name="crouch" />

Many of the participants spoke favorably of the program and reported improved physical and mental health.<ref name="gilmore2004" /> Others said they were just taking advantage of the free saunas.<ref name="ppg2003" /> One Fire Department lieutenant was quoted describing colleagues as desperate for help with the distress they felt in the aftermath of the attacks, to the point that they would try anything.<ref name="odonnell" /><ref name="ppg2003" /> Fire Department officials raised concerns about the project, saying that firefighters were being required to give up [[inhalers]], pills and other orthodox [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]].<ref name="odonnell" /><ref name="gittrich" /><ref name="ppg2003">{{cite news|title=NYC Clinic has Scientology ties|last=O'Donnell|first=Michelle|date=October 4, 2003|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=4|accessdate=March 10, 2009 }}</ref> Two weeks into the program, one firefighter passed out and was taken to an emergency room with severe asthma, later saying that he had been asked to stop using his inhaler.<ref name="gilmore2004" /> According to the clinic's associate medical director, Dr. Kawabena Nyamekye, participants were being helped off medication at their own insistence, not at the request of Downtown Medical.<ref name="gittrich" /> A former worker at Downtown Medical told reporters that staff were discouraged from calling for an ambulance even in an emergency, and that one of them had been required to break off contact with her boyfriend because he had left Scientology.<ref name="clinicbad" /> A spokesman responded that the clinic had "a clear policy of calling 911 when needed."<ref name=clinicbad>{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Stefan C.|title=Scientology Clinic Bad Medicine: Ex-Worker|newspaper=New York Post|date=August 4, 2005}}</ref>
