Dr Forrest had a prestigious career, serving in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps|Army Medical Staff]] for 36 years supporting the [[British Army]] during a number of conflicts including the [[Crimean War]], briefly being in charge of [[Selimiye Barracks|Scutari]] Hospital where [[Florence Nightingale]] was stationed, and was subsequently made an Honorary Physician to the Queen.

His past revealed, however, that as a medical student, whilst seeking a [[cadaver]] to further his understanding of medicine, he was convicted of [[Body snatching|grave-robbing]] – although he was later [[Pardon|pardoned]] by the King.

== Childhood and education ==

John Forrest was born on 20 June 1804 in [[Stirling]], Scotland, the son of Dr John Forrest, a physician, and Elizabeth Glas.<ref name="JF birth"></ref>

In 1822, when he was a student of medicine at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]] Forrest was involved in the removal of the body of Mary Wotherspoon from [[Stirling]] Churchyard.{{#tag:ref|Before the Anatomy Act of 1832, the only legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts. While in the 1700s, hundreds had been executed for trivial crimes, by the 19th century only approximately 50 people were being hanged each year. With the expansion of the medical schools and private anatomical schools, as many as 500 cadavers were needed. This led to body snatching to fill the shortfall. Stealing a corpse was a misdemeanour at common law, not a felony, and was therefore only punishable with fine and imprisonment, rather than transportation or execution. The trade was a sufficiently lucrative business to run the risk of detection, particularly as the authorities tended to turn a blind eye to what they considered a necessary evil.<ref>Wise, Sarah (2004). ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iXKVyl6b4j8C&pg=PA30 The Italian boy: murder and grave-robbery in 1830s London]''. London: Jonathan Cape. pp30-31. ISBN 978-1-84413-330-7 Google Book search. Retrieved on 27 February 2012</ref>|group="nb"}} The crime was discovered and John along with James Shiels, a street sweeper, Daniel Mitchell, a servant and changekeeper, and James McNab, the local gravedigger, were implicated as the culprits.

A [[trial]] was held at the Stirling Spring [[Circuit Court]] on 19 April 1823; however, Forrest had absconded and was absent from the hearings. He was assumed to be heading for Paris whilst McNab and Mitchel were held prisoners in the Stirling [[Tolbooth]]. The court documents do not mention Shiels however. The crime had been discovered when the [[grave]] of Mary Wotherspoon, who had been buried a week before, had been observed to be a couple of inches below the surface. A rope was discovered near the surface and digging down to the [[coffin]] revealed it had been broken open and the body removed, however the clothes had been thrown back inside.{{#tag:ref|One method body-snatchers used was to dig at the head end of a recent burial, digging with a wooden spade (quieter than metal). When they reached the coffin they broke it open, put a rope around the corpse and dragged it out. They were careful not to steal anything such as jewellery or clothes as this would leave them open to a felony charge.<ref>Wise, Sarah (2004). p96.</ref>|group="nb"}}<ref name="JF trial">"Trial papers relating to Daniel Mitchell, James McNab, John Forrest for the crime of violation of sepulchres at Church yard: Stirling, 19 April 1823".

In McNab's statement he described Forrest as the ring-leader who had approached him a number of times trying to persuade him to assist in the removal of bodies from the church yard, offering him up to four [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] per body. In McNab's role as the church [[gravedigger]] he would have held the keys to the church yard which would be of great use in such a crime. Although McNab admitted being with Forrest, Mitchel and Shiels on the night before the crime was discovered, he protested his innocence and claimed the crime was conducted after he left the group.<ref name="JF trial"></ref>

Mitchel's statement supports the claim that Forrest had offered a number of times three of four guineas for assistance in the removal of bodies from the graveyard. Mitchel also mentions one of Forrest's [[accomplice|accomplices]] being ''"a tallish man with a great white coat with a number of capes and whom he heard to be called Mr Johnston from Edinburgh"''. This man was not located and assumed to be a [[fictitious]] character.<ref name="JF trial"></ref><ref group="nb">The character described could have been John Forrest's brother-in-law Dr Alexander Johnston. Johnston was married to John's elder sister Marion and was four years older than John. He had obtained his degree at Edinburgh University and it could be assumed he was still living there and so fitting the description of "Mr Johnston from Edinburgh". The "white coat" may imply a doctor's outfit, however prior to the late 19th century doctors actually wore black.</ref>

Mitchel goes on to describe how Forrest had offered him a large amount of whisky and being [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]], agreed to go with him, McNab and Shiels to the church yard where Mr Johnston gave him a pound note (which he admits he split with Shiels the following day). However, Mitchel denies assisting with the crime, saying he left immediately afterwards.<ref name="JF trial"></ref>

As all evidence pointed towards Forrest being the principal offender in the case and that he had absconded, the court decreed that he should be [[Outlaw|outlawed]].<ref>Shaw, Patrick & Dunlop, Alex (Eds.) (1824). "Court of Justiciary: West Circuit: No.99". In ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wq8DAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA813 Cases decided in the Court of Session]'' '''2'''.

The [[Lord Advocate]] also decided that because Forrest was absent, the trial against McNab and Mitchel who had merely been acting as agents was halted ''pro loco et tempore''. In Scots law this phrase refers to a case where the trial is stopped but the [[prosecution]] retains the right to bring a fresh [[indictment]] against the [[suspect|accused]]. They were freed from jail, however this incensed the local populace who formed an angry mob and started to [[riot]] in the streets. The 77th Regiment were brought down from the Castle to disperse the rioters who fired on the mob in Spittal Street, but no-one was injured, the soldiers intentionally firing over the people's heads. For their own safety McNab and Mitchel had to take refuge in the jail they had just been released from.<ref>"Riot in Stirling" (1823).

== Early military career ==

Much of Dr Forrest's military career is documented in his obituary in the [[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]:<ref name="JF obituary">"Obituaries". ''[http://www.bmj.com/content/2/247 British Medical Journal]'' '''2(247)'''. p323</ref>

Dr Forrest joined the British Army as a Hospital Assistant on 10 November 1825. Through his diligence he was promoted to Assistant Surgeon into the [[Lancashire Fusiliers|20th Regiment of the Foot]] on 9 February 1826. This period of history was relatively peaceful, and regiments were posted around the British Colonies to ensure order was maintained. The 20th Regiment was based in [[India]] and Dr Forrest was involved in the expedition against the Rajah of [[Kolhapur|Kolapore]] in 1827.<ref name="JF obituary"></ref>

On 3 September 1829 Dr Forrest was transferred into the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers|23rd Regiment of Foot]] where he was attached until 11 October 1831 when he transferred to the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th West India Regiment of Foot]]. 

Dr Forrest transferred into the hospital staff in [[St. Ninians]], Scotland on 9 July 1832 where he remained for a number of years.<ref name="JF obituary"></ref> There he married, on 7 March 1839, Ann Mclachlan <ref>"Marriages: St. Ninians, Scotland: 1839".

Dr Forrest was promoted to surgeon of the 2nd class into the [[75th (Stirlingshire) Regiment of Foot|75th Regiment of Foot]] where he was attached from 2 July 1841 until 13 May 1842 when he transferred to the hospital staff in [[Cape Town]].<ref name="JF obituary"></ref>

Whilst in [[Cape Town]], Dr Forrest and his wife Ann had two children, Mary Anne (born 1840)<ref>''1881 England Census'', Public Records Office. Ref.

Dr Forrest's role as hospital staff in Cape Town included involvement in the expedition against the insurgent [[Boer]]s beyond the [[Orange River]] in 1845, and in the [[Kaffir War]] of 1846, for which he received the [[South Africa Medal (1854)|South African Medal]]. <ref name="JF obituary"></ref>

He also became the Medical Attendant to [[Lady Sarah Lennox]], daughter of the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]], and wife of [[Peregrine Maitland|Sir Peregrine Maitland]]. [[John Hall (doctor)|Sir John Hall]] describes Dr Forrest in a letter dated 17 January 1847:

{{quote|Dr Forrest, who belongs to the Medical Staff here, and has made a good deal of money, I hear, by private practice, is indignant at being passed over by Atkinson, who is junior to him in the Service, and is going to make an application to return home on account of his health, to which I suppose I shall be compelled to give my assent. The other day he sent a regular reprimand to Sir James McGrigor for overlooking his individual merits, and promoting a junior Officer over his head, which he sent to me for transmission home. I, of course, returned it to him with a message that, however much he fancied Sir James deserved censure for the promotion he had made, I was not the channel through which such a communication should pass, but that if I could forward his views in getting an exchange, or even promotion, it would afford me much pleasure. It was rather a knowing dodge of the canny Scot, as all Sir James's anger would have fallen on me, and very properly, for transmitting such a document; but I have been severely bitten once by one of his countrymen for my good nature, and I will forgive the next who persuades me to commit myself again for his advantage.<ref>Mitra, Siddha Mohana (1911).

On 28 March 1854, Dr Forrest was promoted to Deputy-Inspector of Army Hospitals and on 13 April 1854 was ordered to be in medical charge of the 3rd division of the Eastern army in [[Gallipoli]] and [[Bulgaria]], accompanying the expedition to the [[Crimea]] on 17 September 1854.<ref name="JF obituary"></ref><ref name="returns">"Returns relating to Officers in the Army (Crimea)".

In his capacity of Principal Medical Officer, Dr Forrest was present at the affair of Bulganac, [[Battle of Balaclava|capture of Balaklava]], battles of the [[Battle of Alma|Alma]] and [[Battle of Inkerman|Inkerman]], and [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|siege of Sebastopol]]. Forrest was noted in [[Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]’s despatch after the Battle of Inkerman, ''“for his able exertions, as deserving to be most honourably mentioned”''.<ref name="JF obituary"></ref>

In December 1854, he was posted to [[Selimiye Barracks|Scutari]] hospital. One of the junior doctors in his division, George Lawson, wrote a letter home describing his high opinion of Dr Forrest:

{{quote|You will be surprised to hear that Dr Forrest has left us. He received orders to proceed to Scutari to take the Medical Superintendance of that station. The Scutari Hospital has been much grumbled at, and from the number of sick now rapidly being sent down there, it requires a man of good capabilities to take charge. Had he been there before there would never have been a complaint against the place ... He has kindly promised to have me removed there, but this I am obliged to keep to myself, as it requires some management to be sent down.

It was not long before the extent of the conditions at Scutari became clear to Dr Forrest, as described in his letter to [[John Hall (doctor)|Dr John Hall]] on 4 January:

{{quote|I fear that this place will prove too much for me. There are now three large Hospitals open containing close upon 5000 sick.

[[Florence Nightingale]], a nurse at Scutari who worked hard to make improvements for the overworked staff against official indifference, wrote of Forrest in her letter to [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]] on 8 January 1855, stating:

{{quote|I beseech you to keep this letter to yourself, while making enquiries to which it may lead you. The Commission has done nothing – probably its powers were limited to enquiry.

The conditions are revealed also in a letter dated 16 January from Dr Forrest to [[John Hall (doctor)|Dr John Hall]]:

{{quote|We are going on very quietly here. Miss Nightingale & Co have not disturbed me. I hope you will not send any more sick down here until our numbers are reduced, as there is no room for them in the hospitals – the weather here is very stormy and I pity the troops in camp with all my heart – their sufferings must be great and I can see nothing before them but certain death.<ref name="Dr Forrest Reports"></ref>}}

Unfortunately Dr Forrest had contracted a severe illness and unable to remain at his post he resigned. His letter to [[John Hall (doctor)|Dr Hall]] on 23 January stated:

{{quote|I am sorry I find I must divert to England for a change in climate as I am quite unfit to carry on duty here. Lawson and others seem to think there is serious disease of the kidney going on and I daresay they are right.<ref name="Dr Forrest Reports"></ref>}}
