'''Fructose malabsorption''', formerly named "dietary [[fructose]] intolerance," is a digestive disorder<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fructose-intolerance/AN01574 MayoClinic.com]</ref> in which absorption of fructose is impaired by deficient [[fructose carrier]]s in the small intestine's [[enterocyte]]s. This results in an increased concentration of [[fructose]] in the entire intestine.

This condition is common in patients identified to be suffering [[symptom]]s of [[irritable bowel syndrome]], although occurrence in these patients is not higher than occurrence in the normal population. Conversely, patients with fructose malabsorption often fit the profile of those with irritable bowel syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ledochowski M, ''et al.'' |title=Fruktosemalabsorption |journal=Journal für Ernährungsmedizin |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15–19 |year=2001 |url=http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/305.pdf |language=German}}</ref> A small proportion of patients with both fructose malabsorption and [[lactose intolerance]] also suffer from [[celiac disease]].

Fructose malabsorption is not to be confused with [[hereditary fructose intolerance]], a potentially fatal condition in which the liver [[enzymes]] that break up fructose are deficient.

==Pathophysiology==
Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25–50g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed. People with fructose malabsorption absorb less than 25g per sitting.<ref>http://www.uihealthcare.com/kxic/2008/06/fructose.html</ref> In the large intestine, fructose that has not been adequately absorbed reduces the absorption of water osmotically and is metabolized by colonic bacteria into short chain fatty acids, producing the byproduct gases hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This abnormal increase in hydrogen is detectable with the [[hydrogen breath test]].

The physiological consequences of fructose malabsorption include increased osmotic load, rapid bacterial fermentation, altered gastrointestinal motility, the formation of mucosal [[biofilm]] and altered [[Gut flora|profile of bacteria]]. These effects are additive with other short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates such as [[sorbitol]]. The clinical significance of these events depends upon the response of the bowel to such changes; they have a higher chance of inducing symptoms in people with functional gut disorders than asymptomatic subjects. Some effects of fructose malabsorption are decreased [[tryptophan]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ledochowski M, Widner B, Murr C, Sperner-Unterweger B, Fuchs D |title=Fructose malabsorption is associated with decreased plasma tryptophan |journal=Scand. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=367–71 |year=2001 |pmid=11336160 |doi=10.1080/003655201300051135}}</ref> [[folic acid]]<ref name=Ledochowski99/> and [[zinc]] in the blood.<ref name=Ledochowski99>{{cite journal |author=Ledochowski M, Uberall F, Propst T, Fuchs D |title=Fructose malabsorption is associated with lower plasma folic acid concentrations in middle-aged subjects |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=45 |issue=11 |pages=2013–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10545075 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/45/11/2013}}</ref>

Restricting dietary intake of free fructose and/or [[fructan]]s may provide symptom relief in a high proportion of patients with functional gut disorders.<ref name="pmid17217453">{{cite journal |author=Gibson PR, Newnham E, Barrett JS, Shepherd SJ, Muir JG |title=Review article: fructose malabsorption and the bigger picture |journal=Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=349–63 |year=2007 |pmid=17217453 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03186.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03186.x/full }}</ref>

==Symptoms==
*[[Bloating]] (from fermentation in the small and large intestine)
*[[Diarrhea]] and/or [[constipation]]
*[[Flatulence]]
*[[Stomach]] pain (as a result of muscle [[spasm]]s, the intensity of which can vary from mild and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] to [[Acute (medical)|acute]] but erratic)
*Vomiting (if great quantities are consumed)
*Early signs of mental depression<ref name="depression">{{cite journal |author=Ledochowski M, Sperner-Unterweger B, Widner B, Fuchs D. |title=Fructose malabsorption is associated with early signs of mental depression. |year=2010 |pmid=9620891 |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=295–8 |journal=European journal of medical research}}</ref>
*Nausea

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic test, when used, is similar to that used to diagnose [[lactose intolerance]].  It is called a [[Hydrogen Breath Test|hydrogen breath test]] and is the method currently used for a clinical [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].

==Treatment==
There is no known cure, but an appropriate [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] will help.

===Diet===
Foods that should be avoided by people with fructose malabsorption include:
*Foods and beverages containing greater than 0.5g fructose in excess of glucose per 100g and greater than 0.2g of fructans per serving should be avoided. Foods with >3g of fructose per serving are termed a ‘high fructose load’ and possibly present a risk of inducing symptoms. However, the concept of a ‘high fructose load’ has not been evaluated in terms of its importance in the success of the diet.<ref name=Gibson10>{{cite journal |author=Gibson PR, Shepherd SJ |title=Evidence-based dietary management of functional gastrointestinal symptoms: The FODMAP approach|journal=Advances in Clinical Practice |volume=25 |pages=252–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20136989 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1746.2009.06149.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122650565/abstract |issue=2}}</ref>
*Foods with high fructose-to-glucose ratio. Glucose enhances absorption of fructose, so fructose from foods with fructose-to-glucose ratio <1, like white potatoes,  are readily absorbed, whereas foods with fructose-to-glucose ratio >1, like apples and pears, are often problematic regardless of the total amount of fructose in the food.<ref>http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/digestive-health/nutrition/BarrettArticle.pdf</ref>
*Foods rich in [[fructans]] and other Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides and Polyols ([[FODMAP]]s), including [[artichoke]]s, [[asparagus]], [[Leek (vegetable)|leeks]], onions, and wheat-containing products, including breads, cakes, biscuits, [[breakfast cereal]]s, [[pie]]s, pastas, [[pizza]]s, and wheat [[noodle]]s.
*Foods containing [[sorbitol]], present in some [[diet food|diet drinks and foods]], and occurring naturally in some [[stone fruit]]s, or [[xylitol]], present in some berries, and other [[polyols]] (sugar alcohols), such as erythritol, mannitol, and other ingredients that end with -tol, commonly added as artificial sweeteners in commercial foods.

Foods with a high glucose content ingested with foods containing excess fructose may help sufferers absorb the excess fructose.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Skoog SM, Bharucha AE |title=Dietary fructose and gastrointestinal symptoms: a review |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=99 |issue=10 |pages=2046–50 |year=2004 |pmid=15447771 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.40266.x |url=http://www.bashaar.org.il/files/101022005111814.pdf }}</ref>

The role that fructans play in fructose malabsorption is still under investigation. However, it is recommended that fructan intake for fructose malabsorbers should be kept to less than 0.5&nbsp;grams/serving,<ref name=Shepherd06>{{cite journal |author=Shepherd SJ, Gibson PR |title=Fructose malabsorption and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome: guidelines for effective dietary management |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=106 |issue=10 |pages=1631–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17000196 |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2006.07.010 |url=http://sacfs.asn.au/download/SueShepherd_sarticle.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> and supplements with ''[[inulin]]'' and ''[[fructooligosaccharide]]'' (FOS), both fructans, should be avoided.<ref name=Shepherd06/>

====Foods with high fructose content====
According to the USDA database,<ref>[http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/ USDA National Nutrient Database] Release 20, September 2007</ref> foods with more fructose than glucose include:

The USDA food database reveals that many common fruits contain nearly equal amounts of the fructose and glucose, and they do not present problems for those individuals with fructose malabsorption.<ref>[http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/Other/herr48.pdf Sugar Content of Selected Foods:  Individual and Total Sugars] Ruth H. Matthews, Pamela R. Pehrsson, and Mojgan Farhat-Sabet, (1987) [[U.S.D.A.]]</ref> Some fruits with a greater ratio of fructose than glucose are apples, pears and watermelon, which contain more than twice as much fructose as glucose. Fructose levels in grapes varies depending on ripeness and variety, where unripe grapes contain more glucose.

===Dietary guidelines for the management of fructose malabsorption===
Researchers at Monash University in Australia developed dietary guidelines<ref name=Shepherd06/> for managing fructose malabsorption, particularly for individuals with IBS.

====Unfavorable foods (i.e. more fructose than glucose)====
*Fruit&nbsp;— apple, pear, guava, honeydew melon, nashi fruit, pawpaw, papaya, quince, star fruit, watermelon;
*Dried fruit — apple, currant, date, fig, pear, raisin, sultana;
*Fortified wines
*Foods containing added sugars, such as [[agave nectar]], some corn syrups, and fruit juice concentrates.

====Favorable foods (i.e. fructose equal to or less than glucose)====
The following list of favorable foods was cited in the paper: "Fructose malabsorption and symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Guidelines for effective dietary management".<ref name=Shepherd06/> The fructose and glucose contents of foods listed on the Australian food standards [http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumerinformation/nuttab2010/nuttab2010onlinesearchabledatabase/onlineversion.cfm?&action=nutrientFoods&category=Proximates&nutrientID=FRU website] would appear to indicate that most of the listed foods have higher fructose levels. 

*Stone fruit: apricot, nectarine, peach, plum (caution — these fruits contain [[sorbitol]]);
*Berry fruit: blueberry, blackberry, boysenberry, cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, loganberry;
*Citrus fruit: kumquat, grapefruit, lemon, lime, mandarin, orange, tangelo;
*Other fruits: ripe banana, jackfruit, kiwi fruit, passion fruit, pineapple, rhubarb, tamarillo.

== Food-labeling ==
Producers of processed food in most or all countries, including the USA, are not currently required by law to mark foods containing "fructose in excess of glucose." This can cause some surprises and pitfalls for fructose malabsorbers.

Foods (such as bread) marked "gluten-free" are usually suitable for fructose malabsorbers, though sufferers need to be careful of gluten-free foods that contain [[dried fruit]] or high fructose corn syrup or [[fructose]] itself in sugar form. However, fructose malabsorbers do ''not'' need to avoid [[gluten]], as those with [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]] must.

Many fructose malabsorbers can eat breads made from [[rye]] and [[maize|corn]] flour. However, these may contain wheat unless marked "wheat-free" (or "gluten-free") (Note: Rye bread is ''not'' gluten-free.)  Although often assumed to be an acceptable alternative to wheat, spelt flour is not suitable for sufferers of fructose malabsorption{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, just as it is not appropriate for those with [[wheat allergy|wheat allergies]] or celiac disease. However, some fructose malabsorbers do not have difficulty with fructans from wheat products while they may have problems with foods that contain excess free fructose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

There are many breads on the market that boast having no [[high fructose corn syrup]].  In lieu of high fructose corn syrup, however, one may find the production of special breads with a high inulin content, where [[inulin]] is a replacement in the [[baking|baking process]] for the following: high fructose corn syrup, flour and fat.  Because of the caloric reduction, lower fat content, dramatic fiber increase and [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] tendencies of the replacement inulin, these breads are considered a healthier alternative to traditionally prepared [[leavening]] breads.  Though the touted health benefits may exist, sufferers of fructose malabsorption will likely find no difference between these new breads and traditionally prepared breads in alleviating their symptoms because inulin is a [[fructan]], and, again, consumption of fructans should be reduced dramatically in those with fructose malabsorption in an effort to appease symptoms.

==New research==
Fructose and [[fructan]]s which are polymers of fructose are [[FODMAP]]s (Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides and Polyols) known to cause GI discomfort in susceptible individuals. A low FODMAP diet has widespread application for managing functional GI disorders such as [[Irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]].<ref name=Gibson10/>
