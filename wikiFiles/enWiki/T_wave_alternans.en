'''T wave alternans''' (TWA) is a periodic beat-to-beat variation in the amplitude or shape of the [[T wave]] in an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG or EKG).

Administered [[Ibutilide]] and converted to [[sinus rhythm]] but subsequently had an episode of [[Torsades de Pointes]] which required [[DC cardioversion]] back into sinus rhythm.]]

TWA was first described in 1908.  At that time, only large variations ("macroscopic" TWA) could be detected.  Those large TWAs were associated with increased susceptibility to lethal [[ventricular tachycardia]]s.

Most modern references to TWA refer to '''microvolt T wave alternans''' (MTWA), a non-invasive [[heart]] test that can identify patients who are at increased risk of [[sudden cardiac death]].<ref>Chow T, Saghir S, Bartone C, Goebel M, Schneider J, Booth T, Chan PS.

Microvolt T-wave alternans and the risk of death or sustained ventricular arrhythmias in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.  J Am Coll Cardiol. 2006 January 17;47(2):456-63. Epub 2005 December 15.</ref>  It is most often used in patients who have had [[myocardial infarction]]s (heart attacks) or other heart damage to see if they are at high risk of developing a potentially lethal [[cardiac arrhythmia]].  Those who are found to be at high risk would therefore benefit from the placement of a [[defibrillator]] device which can stop an arrhythmia and save the patient's life.

The TWA test uses an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) measurement of the heart's electrical conduction.  The test looks for the presence of ''repolarization alternans'' (T-wave alternans), which is variation in the [[vector (geometric)|vector]] and [[amplitude]] of the T wave component of the EKG.  The amount of variation is small, on the order of microvolts, so sensitive digital signal processing techniques are required to detect TWA.

==Microvolt T wave Alternans (MTWA)==
Microvolt T wave alternans is a variant of T wave alternans that detects T wave alternans signals as small as one-millionth of a volt.  Microvolt T wave alternans is defined as an alternation in the morphology of the T wave in an every other beat or AB-AB pattern. It has long been associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. First recognized nearly a century ago, visually discernible alternans were linked to the rapid onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

===Historical Development===
Research conducted in the early 1980s by Dr. Richard Cohen and his colleagues at MIT explored the idea that visually indiscernible alternans may be equally significant. These efforts established a link between visually imperceptible alternans at the microvolt level and susceptibility to arrhythmias and showed alternans to be a heart rate dependent phenomenon. In addition, Dr. Joseph Smith, working with Dr. Cohen developed a methodology known as the Spectral Method which allowed measurement of alternans at the level of one microvolt.

===Clinical Significance===
Microvolt T wave alternans testing acts as a risk stratifier between patients who need implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) and those who do not.<ref>Chow T, Kereiakes DJ, Bartone C, Booth T, Schloss EJ, Waller T, Chung E, Menon S, Nallamothu BK, Chan PS. Microvolt T-wave alternans identifies patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.J Am Coll Cardiol. 2007 Jan 2;49(1):50-8. Epub 2006 Dec 13.</ref>  Patients who test negative for MTWA are less likely to require an ICD than those who test positive.  In some cases, the test is equivalent to a more invasive electrophysiology (EP) study.<ref name="medscape.com">Noninvasive Microvolt T-Wave Alternans Test for Selective Targeting of Primary-Prevention ICDs Gets More Trial Support http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/547941</ref>

Multiple prospective clinical trials indicate that patients from broad groups of at risk populations who test MTWA negative will likely live ventricular event-free for 12 to 24 months after their initial MTWA test.

MTWA results are given as positive, negative, or indeterminate.  Those with indeterminate results can be tested again.  Otherwise, positive and indeterminate results are often lumped together when making clinical judgments about the likelihood of sudden cardiac death.  In patients who have a negative (normal) MTWA test the risk of sudden cardiac death is very low. The Negative Predictive Value of MTWA testing has been shown to be 98% accurate for follow-up periods of 12–24 months in various clinical studies. Negative patients should be retested every 12 months as cardiac function can change over time.<ref name="medscape.com"/>

Patients who test MTWA positive or indeterminate for heart rate or dense ectopy (abnormal) should be referred to an electrophysiologist for further evaluation.

Patients who have an indeterminate test should be retested immediately. Studies indicate that over 50% of patients who initially test as indeterminate, become determinate if retested during the same session.

Relevant clinical studies involving MTWA include the ALPHA trial,<ref>Salerno-Uriarte JA, De Ferrari GM, Klersy C, Pedretti RF, Tritto M, Sallusti L, Libero L, Pettinati G, Molon G, Curnis A, Occhetta E, Morandi F, Ferrero P, Accardi F; ALPHA Study Group Investigators.

Two methods currently exist to perform MTWA testing—the spectral analytic method and the modified moving average (MMA) method.  Most of the results have come from clinical trials using the spectral analytic method, increasing number of studies<ref name="ReferenceA"/> suggest that the modified moving average may be equivalent or superior with the benefit of also being measurable during a routine Holter exam,<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/581058</ref> since the method doesn't require stationary heart rate in a controlled environment. Also TWA measured using MMA method during stress test is very promising risk stratification method that can be performed during a routine exercise test without the need of a special protocol for maintaining stationary heart rate, or special electrodes.<ref>Nieminen T, Lehtimäki T, Viik J, Lehtinen R, Nikus K, Kööbi T, Niemelä K, Turjanmaa V, Kaiser W, Huhtala H, Verrier RL, Huikuri H, Kähönen M.

===Economics of MTWA===
This test is significant for insurance companies because it can potentially save thousands of dollars per patient by reducing the implantation of unnecessary implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD's).<ref>Daniel M.
