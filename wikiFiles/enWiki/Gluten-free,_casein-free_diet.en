A '''gluten-free casein-free diet''' ('''GFCF diet''') or  '''gluten-free dairy-free diet''' ('''GFDF diet''') eliminates dietary intake of the naturally occurring proteins [[gluten]] (found most often in [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[rye]], and commercially available [[oats]]), and [[casein]] (found most often in [[milk]] and [[dairy product]]s).

Despite an absence of scientific evidence, there have been advocates for the use of this diet as a treatment for [[autism]] and related conditions.<ref name=Christison/><ref name=Cochrane/> 

==Background and theory==
In the 1960s, Curtis Dohan<ref>{{cite web|url=https://academic.uthsc.edu/faculty/facepage.php?netID=cdohan&personnel_id=124602|title=Curtis Dohan, M.D., A.B., Associate Professor, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center}}</ref> speculated that the low incidence of [[schizophrenia]] in certain South Pacific Island societies was a result of a diet low in wheat and milk-based foods.<ref>Dohan, F.C. (1966) Cereals and Schizophrenia, data and hypothesis ''Acta Physiologica Scandinavica'', ''42'', 125-132.</ref> Dohan proposed a [[genetic disorder|genetic defect]] wherein individuals are incapable of completely [[metabolism|metabolizing]] [[gluten]] and [[casein]] as a possible [[etiology]] for [[schizophrenia]]. Dohan hypothesized that elevated [[peptide]] levels from this incomplete metabolism could be responsible for schizophrenic behaviors. In 1979, [[Jaak Panksepp]] proposed a connection between autism and opiates, noting that injections of minute quantities of opiates in young laboratory animals induce symptoms similar to those observed among autistic children.<ref>Panksepp, J. (1979) A neurochemical theory of autism. Trends in Neurosciences, 2, 174-177</ref>

The possibility of a relationship between [[autism]] and the consumption of gluten and casein was first articulated by [[Kalle Reichelt]] in 1991.<ref>Reichelt KL, Knivsberg A-M, Lind G, Nødland M. Probable etiology and possible treatment of childhood autism. Brain Dysfunct 1991; 4: 308-19</ref> Based on studies showing correlation between autism, schizophrenia, and increased [[urine|urinary]] [[peptide]] levels,<ref>Reichelt et al. (1981) ‘Biologically Active Peptide Containing Fractions in Schizophrenia and Childhood Autism’, Advances in Biochemical Psychopharmacology 28: 627–43.</ref> Reichelt hypothesized that some of these peptides may have an [[opiate]] effect. This led to the development of the Opioid Excess Theory, expounded by [[Paul Shattock]] and others,<ref>Shattock P, Whiteley P. (2002) "Biochemical aspects in autism spectrum disorders: updating the opioid-excess theory and presenting new opportunities for biomedical intervention" "Autism Research Unit, University of Sunderland, UK.</ref> which speculates that peptides with opioid activity cross into the bloodstream from the lumen of the intestine, and then into the brain. These peptides were speculated to arise from incomplete digestion of certain foods, in particular gluten from wheat and certain other cereals and from casein from milk and dairy produce. Further work confirmed [[opioid peptide]]s such as [[casomorphine]]s<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sun Z, Cade JR |year=1999 |title=A peptide found in schizophrenia and autism causes behavioral changes in rats |journal=Autism |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=85–95 |doi=10.1177/1362361399003001007 }}</ref> (from [[casein]]) and [[gluten exorphine]]s and [[gliadorphin]] (from [[gluten]]) as possible suspects, due to their chemical similarity to opiates.

Reichelt hypothesized that long term exposure to these opiate peptides may have effects on brain maturation and contribute to social awkwardness and isolation. On this basis, Reichelt and others have proposed a gluten-free casein-free (GFCF) diet for sufferers of autism to minimize the buildup of opiate peptides.<ref name=Cochrane/>

==GFCF and GFDF diets as a treatment for autism spectrum disorder==
One of the most visible advocates for the GFCF/GFDF diet is the [[Autism Research Institute]]. The ARI recommends the GFCF/GFDF diet as a treatment for [[autism]] and related conditions.<ref name=Christison/><ref name=Cochrane/> The organization believes that, "Dietary intervention is a cornerstone of a evidence-based medical approach, and there is convincing empirical evidence that special diets help many with autism. The ARI lists two studies: Knivsberg, Wiig, et al. “Dietary Interventions in Autistic Syndromes" in the journal'' Brain Dysfunctions 3'' and Knivsberg, Reichelt, et al. “A Randomised, Controlled Study of Dietary Intervention in Autistic Syndromes”
in ''Nutritional Neuroscience'' as scientific publications that support their theories.<ref>{{cite web|first=Autism Research Institute|title=Special Diets|url=http://www.autism.com/index.php/treating_diets|accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref>

==Effectiveness==

* [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] - Clinical Report (2007)

In their report, the AAP found that they could not recommend the use of special diets for children with autism spectrum disorder because of inadequate evidence. The report stated, "Although use of the gluten/casein-free diet for children with ASDs is popular, there is little evidence to support or refute this intervention, and reviewers have determined that meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn from the existing literature." <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1162–82 |title=Management of children with autism spectrum disorders |author=Myers, S.M.; Johnson, C.P.; Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362 |pmid=17967921 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}</ref>

* Cochrane Library - Gluten and Casein-free diets in autism spectrum disorder (2008)
A 2008 systematic review from the [[Cochrane Library]] indicates that a gluten-free and/or casein-free diet has not been shown to have any effect on the behavior or functioning of individuals with autism. Likewise, research on adverse outcomes and disbenefits is lacking. Two randomized trials were included in the review. The first included ten individuals, was [[Blind experiment|single blind]] (with parents aware of allocation), and reported reduced autistic traits; the second included fifteen individuals, was double blind, and found no significant differences in outcomes.<ref name=Cochrane>{{cite journal |author=Millward C, Ferriter M, Calver S, Connell-Jones G |title=Gluten- and casein-free diets for autistic spectrum disorder |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |year=2008 |issue=2 |pages=CD003498 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003498.pub3 |pmid=18425890 |editor1-last=Ferriter |editor1-first=Michael }}</ref> The first study has been criticized for its small [[sample (statistics)|sample]] size and single-blinding; both factors are associated with positive outcomes bias.<ref name=Christison>{{cite journal |journal=J Dev Behav Pediatr |year=2006 |volume=27 |issue=2 Suppl 2| pages=S162–71 |title=Elimination diets in autism spectrum disorders: any wheat amidst the chaff? |author=Christison GW, Ivany K |pmid=16685183 |doi=10.1097/00004703-200604002-00015 }}</ref>

* ''Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders'' - Gluten-free and casein free diets in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review (2009)

The [[systematic review]], conducted in 2009, concluded that the results "reveal that the current corpus of research does not support the use of GFCF diets in the treatment of ASD. Given the lack of empirical support, and the adverse consequences often associated with GFCF diets (e.g. stigmatization, diversion of treatment resources, reduced bone cortical thickness), such diets should only be implemented in the event a child with ASD experiences acute behavioral changes, seemingly associated with changes in diet...and/or a child has allergies or food intolerances to gluten and/or casein." <ref>{{cite journal|title=Gluten-free and casein-free diets in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review|author=Mulloy A|journal=Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2010|url=http://www.edb.utexas.edu/education/assets/files/ltc/gfcf_review.pdf|author-separator=,|display-authors=1|author2=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref> 
The review identified 14 studies testing the effects of GFCF diet on autism. Both of the papers ARI references were included in this study. Out of 14 studies, 7 reported positive results, 2 reported mixed results, and 4 reported negative results (that is, absence of statistically significant effects). Among the four studies reporting negative results, none were longer than 6 weeks, with two out of four studying effects of the diet for 4 days and 9 days. Only two double-blind studies were identified, and both of these produced negative results.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gluten-free and casein-free diets in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review|author=Mulloy A|journal=Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2010|url=http://www.edb.utexas.edu/education/assets/files/ltc/gfcf_review.pdf|author-separator=,|display-authors=1|author2=<Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.>}}</ref> 

* Vanderbilt Evidence-based Practice Center - Therapies for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2011)

The review, commissioned by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], examined 159 unique studies on therapies for children ages 2 to 12 with ASDs. The review included articles published in English from January 2000 to May 2010. Out of the 159 studies, the Vanderbilt Evidence-based Practice Center examined 14 studies of gluten-free and/or casein-free diets.<ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011>{{cite book |author=Warren, Z.; Veenstra-VanderWeele, J.; Stone, W.; Bruzek, J.L.; Nahmias, A.S.; Foss-Feig, J.H.; Jerome, R.N.; Krishnaswami, S.; Sathe, N.A.; Glasser, A.M.; Surawicz, T.; McPheeters, M.L. |title=Therapies for children with autism spectrum disorders |year=2011 |url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |series=AHRQ Publication No. 11-EHC029-EF, Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 26 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |location=Rockville, MD}}</ref> 

The studies covered 188 participants, who ranged in age from 2 to 17. The review rated 11 of the 14 studies as suggestive. The investigators' methodological concerns included, "use of measurements subject to bias, lack of blinding and control groups, use of only post-treatment measures, short intervention durations, and failure to control for the effects of maturation." The remaining 3 studies were considered as, "providing a level of certainty of evidence for the lack of effectiveness of GFCF diets." The investigators concluded that, "the evidence supporting GFCF diets in ASD is limited and weak." <ref name="VanderbiltAHRQ2011"/> 

[[Testimonial]]s and anecdotal evidence of individual parents and teachers range from no discernible effect to claims of complete recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2006 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=413–20 |title=The gluten-free, casein-free diet in autism: results of a preliminary double blind clinical trial |author=Elder JH, Shankar M, Shuster J, Theriaque D, Burns S, Sherrill L |doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0079-0 |pmid=16555138 }}</ref>

==Safety==
A 2008 study found that boys with autism had significantly thinner bones than non-autistic boys, starting around age 5–6 years, and that boys using casein-free diets had nearly twice the bone thickness deficiency as boys with minimally restricted or unrestricted diets. It is not known which other factors contribute to thin bones in boys with autism, but it appears that a casein-free diet may contribute to calcium and vitamin D deficiencies that lead to decreased bone development and increased risk of broken bones.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=848–56 |title=Reduced bone cortical thickness in boys with autism or autism spectrum disorder |author=Hediger ML, England LJ, Molloy CA, Yu KF, Manning-Courtney P, Mills JL |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0453-6 |pmid=17879151 |laysummary=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jan2008/nichd-29.htm |laysource=NIH News |laydate=2008-01-29 }}</ref>

==Practical implementation==
{{Main|gluten-free diet}}
{{Cookbook|Gluten-Free}}

The implementation of a GFCF diet involves removing all sources of gluten and casein from a person's diet. Gluten is found in all products containing [[wheat]], [[rye]], and [[barley]]. Many gluten-free breads, pastas, and snacks are available commercially. Gluten-free cookbooks have been available for decades. Casein is found in dairy products such as milk, butter or [[cheese]], but is also present in smaller amounts in many substitute dairy products such as vegetarian cheese substitutes and whipped cream topping, which use casein to provide texture. Although advocates of the GFCF diet often recommend total elimination of dairy from the diet, [[whey protein]] is a different milk protein from casein.
