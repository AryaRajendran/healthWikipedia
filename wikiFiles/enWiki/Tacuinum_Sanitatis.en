The '''Tacuinum''' (sometimes '''Taccuinum''') '''Sanitatis''' is a medieval handbook on [[Health|health and wellbeing]], based on the ''Taqwim al‑sihha'' {{lang|ar|تقويم الصحة}} ("Maintenance of Health"), an eleventh-century Arab medical treatise by [[Ibn Butlan]] of [[Baghdad]].<ref>E. Wickersheimer, "Les ''Tacuini Sanitatis'' et leur traduction allemande par Michel Herr", ''Bibliothèque d'Humanisme et Renaissance'' '''12''' 1950:85-97.</ref> Aimed at a cultured lay audience, the text exists in several variant Latin versions, the manuscripts of which are characteristically so profusely illustrated that one student called the ''Taccuinum'' "a trecento picture book," only "nominally a medical text".<ref>Brucia Witthoft, 'The Tacuinum Sanitatis: A Lombard Panorama" ''Gesta'' '''17'''.1 (1978:49-60) p 50.</ref> Though describing in detail the beneficial and harmful properties of foods and plants, it is far more than a [[herbal]]: listing its contents organically rather than alphabetically, it sets forth the six essential elements for well-being: 

*sufficient food and drink in moderation,
*fresh air,
*alternations of activity and rest,
*alternations of sleep and wakefulness,
*secretions and excretions of [[humours]], and finally
*the effects of states of mind.
 
Illnesses result from imbalance of these elements, therefore a healthy life is lived in harmony.

The terse paragraphs of the treatise were freely translated into Latin in mid-thirteenth-century [[Palermo]] or Naples,<ref>"Magister Faragius" (Ferraguth) in Naples took responsibility for one translation into Latin, in a manuscript in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris, MS Lat. 15362 (noted by Witthoft 1978:58 note 9).</ref> where it continued an [[Italo-Norman]] tradition as one of the prime sites for peaceable inter-cultural contact between the Islamic and European worlds.

Four handsomely illustrated complete late fourteenth-century manuscripts of the ''Taccuinum'', all produced in [[Lombardy]], survive, in Vienna, Paris, Liège and Rome, as well as scattered illustrations from others, as well as fifteenth-century [[codex|codices]].<ref>Witthoft 1978 discusses the ''Tacuina'' in the national libraries of Paris and Vienna, and the Biblioteca Casanatense, Rome. Carmelia Opsomer published a commented facsimile of the ms 1041 held in the library of the university of Liège. ''L’Art de vivre en santé. Images et recettes du Moyen Âge. Le « Tacuinum sanitatis » (ms 1041) de la Bibliothèque universitaire de Liège'', éd. de C. Opsomer, Liège, 1991.</ref> Unillustrated manuscripts present a series of tables, with a narrative commentary on the facing pages. The ''Taccuinum'' was first printed in 1531.

The ''Tacuinum'' was very popular in Western Europe in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; an indication of that popularity is the use of the word ''taccuino'' in modern Italian to mean any kind of pocket handbook, guide, notebook.

In addition to its importance for the study of [[medieval medicine]], the Tacuinum is also of interest in the study of agriculture and cooking; for example, one of the earliest identifiable image of the [[carrot]] &mdash; a modern plant &mdash; is found in it. Carrot also appears in The Greek Herbal of [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]]: Illustrated by a Byzantine A.D. 512

In 2008, the Spanish publishing house [[M. Moleiro Editor]] published the first and only facsimile of the ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'' kept at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], in an edition limited to 987 copies.<ref>Albino Mallo, "Moleiro clona códices de los siglos XI y XII con el arte de la perfección", ''Xornal'', January 2, 2009.</ref> This edition was accompanied by a commentary volume by Alain Touwaide ([[Smithsonian]]), Eberhard König ([[Freie Universität Berlin]]) and Carlos Miranda García-Tejedor (Doctor in History).
