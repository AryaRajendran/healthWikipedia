A '''pathogen''' <small style="color:#777">({{lang-el|πάθος}} ''pathos'' “suffering, passion” and γενής ''genēs'' “producer of”)</small> or '''infectious agent''' (colloquially known as a <dfn>''germ''</dfn>) is a [[microorganism]]—in the widest sense, such as a [[virus]], [[bacterium]], [[prion]], or [[fungus]]—that causes [[disease]] in its [[Host (biology)|host]]. The host may be an [[animal]] (including [[humans]]), a [[plant]], or even another microorganism.<ref>http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.</ref><ref>http://www.metapathogen.com</ref>

There are several substrates including ''pathways'' whereby pathogens can invade a host. The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, but [[soil contamination]] has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen. Diseases caused by organisms in humans are known as pathogenic diseases. Some of the diseases that a pathogen can cause are [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[mumps]], [[measles]], [[chickenpox]], [[ebola]] and [[rubella]].

Not all pathogens are necessarily undesirable to humans. In [[entomology]], pathogens are one of the "Three P's" ([[predator]]s, pathogens and [[parasitoids]]) that serve as natural or introduced [[biological control]]s to suppress [[arthropod]] [[pest (organism)|pest]] populations.<ref>sharmen</ref>

==Types of pathogen==

===Viral===
{{Further|Viral disease}}
Pathogenic viruses are diseases mainly those of the families of: [[Adenoviridae]], bacteria [[Picornaviridae]], [[Herpesviridae]], [[Hepadnaviridae]], [[Flaviviridae]], [[Retroviridae]], [[Orthomyxoviridae]], [[Paramyxoviridae]], [[Papovaviridae]], [[Polyomavirus]], [[Rhabdoviridae]], [[Togaviridae]]. Viruses typically range between 20-300 nanometers in length.

===Bacterial===
{{Main|Pathogenic bacteria}}
Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, a few pathogenic bacteria can cause infectious diseases. Bacteria can often be killed by antibiotics because the cell wall in the outside is destroyed, expelling the DNA out of the body of the pathogen, therefore making the pathogen incapable of producing proteins and dies. They typically range between 1 and 5 micrometers in length.

===Fungal===
{{Main|Pathogenic fungi}}
Fungi comprise a eukaryotic kingdom of microbes that are usually [[saprophyte]]s (Consumes off dead organisms) but can cause diseases in humans, animals and plants. Fungi are the most common cause of diseases in crops and other plants. The typical fungal spore size is 1-40 micrometer in length.

===Other parasites===
{{main|Human parasites}}
Some eukaryotic organisms, such as [[protists]] and [[helminths]], cause disease.

===Prionic===
{{Main|Prion}}
According to the prion theory, prions are infectious pathogens that do not contain [[nucleic acid]]s. These abnormally folded proteins are found characteristically in some diseases such as [[scrapie]], [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].<ref>[http://www.mad-cow.org/~tom/prionSP.html ''The prion diseases''] STANLEY B. PRUSINER, Scientific American</ref> Although prions fail to meet the requirements laid out by [[Koch's postulates]], the hypothesis of prions as a new class of pathogen led [[Stanley B. Prusiner]] to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1997.

===Animal pathogens===

===Health care===
A small amount of pathogens are used in vaccines to make immunity stay alert and strengthen defense on the insides to prepare for a larger quantity of the virus ever getting inside.

==Virulence==
[[Virulence]] (the tendency of a pathogen to cause damage to a host's [[physical fitness|fitness]]) evolves when that pathogen can spread from a diseased host, despite that host being very debilitated. [[Horizontal transmission]] occurs between hosts of the same species, in contrast to [[vertical transmission]], which tends to evolve symbiosis (after a period of high morbidity and mortality in the population) by linking the pathogen's evolutionary success to the evolutionary success of the host organism.

[[Evolutionary medicine]] has found that under horizontal transmission, [[Optimal virulence|the host population might never develop tolerance to the pathogen]].
Also can be very dangerous

==Transmission==
{{main|Transmission (medicine)}}
Transmission of pathogens occurs through many different routes, including airborne, direct or indirect contact, sexual contact, through blood, breast milk, or other body fluids, and through the fecal-oral route.
