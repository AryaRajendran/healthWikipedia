The '''respiratory bronchioles''' are the narrowest airways of the [[lung]]s, one fiftieth of an inch across.<ref name="Merck">Merck Manual of medical information,home edition, copyright 1997, first printing of pocket books 1999, Pocket Books, a division of Simon and Schuster Inc</ref>  The [[bronchi]] divide many times before evolving into the bronchioles.
The bronchioles deliver air to the exchange surfaces of the lungs.<ref>Human Anatomy by Frederic Martini sixth edition, page 643</ref>
They are interrupted by [[alveoli]] which are thin walled evaginations.  [[Alveolar ducts]] are distal continuations of the respiratory bronchioles.
