'''Cladribine''' (trade names '''Litak''' and '''Movectro''') is a [[medication|drug]] used to treat [[hairy cell leukemia]] (HCL, leukemic reticuloendotheliosis) and [[multiple sclerosis]].  Its chemical name is 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CDA). 

As a [[purine analog]], it is a synthetic [[antineoplastic|anti-cancer]] agent that also suppresses the immune system.  Chemically, it mimics the [[nucleoside]] [[adenosine]] and thus inhibits the enzyme [[adenosine deaminase]], which interferes with the cell's ability to process DNA.  It is easily destroyed by normal cells except for [[blood]] cells, with the result that it produces relatively few side effects and results in very little non-target cell loss.

==Indications==
Cladribine (as injections) is indicated [approved] for the treatment of symptomatic hairy cell leukemia.<ref name="pmid19344416">{{cite journal |author=Else M, Dearden CE, Matutes E, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term follow-up of 233 patients with hairy cell leukaemia, treated initially with pentostatin or cladribine, at a median of 16 years from diagnosis |journal=Br.

According to the Histiocytosis Association, cladribine is used to treat [[histiocytosis]].<ref>[http://www.histio.org Histiocytosis Association]</ref>

===Multiple sclerosis===
In January 2010, a large clinical trial involving more than 1000 patients documented significant reduction in relapse rates in multiple sclerosis patients with use of ''oral'' cladribine and thus making its use as the first oral medication in multiple sclerosis patients, most likely in year [2011].<ref>{{doi-inline|10.1056/NEJMoa0902533|Giovannoni G, et al., NEJM 2010}}</ref>

June 2011 : Merck has decided to withdraw all marketing applications for cladribine tablets, and to stop selling it in Russia and Australia which had approved it.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/merck-serono-gives-up-on-getting-drug-candidate-for-multiple-sclerosis-approved/81245334/</ref>

==Routes of administration==
For [[hairy cell leukemia]], cladribine can be given by [[intravenous|i.v. infusion]] or [[subcutaneous]] (s.c.) injection.  

For outpatient i.v. infusions, the delivery time (not including time to place the i.v. line) may range from one to four hours; two hours is most common.  Continuous i.v. infusion may be chosen; this approach drips in the cladribine slowly, 24 hours a day using a portable pump and a [[central venous catheter]] or a [[PICC line]].  By contrast, s.c. injections take less than ten seconds per day.

The same total doses are given by both routes. Intravenous and s.c. routes have the same overall outcomes, and the s.c. route may be reduce the infections and other risks associated with venipuncture.<ref name="pmid12377655">{{cite journal |author=von Rohr A, Schmitz SF, Tichelli A, ''et al.'' |title=Treatment of hairy cell leukemia with cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) by subcutaneous bolus injection: a phase II study |journal=[[Ann.

An oral tablet form of cladribine has been successfully tested in patients with relapsing [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>[http://media.netpr.pl/PressOffice/PressRelease.113091.po?rss=true Cladribine Tablets for Multiple Sclerosis Significantly Reduced Relapse Rate in Two-Year Phase III Pivotal Trial]</ref>

==Treatment schedule==
Using either i.v. or s.c. routes of administration, cladribine can be administered on a daily or a weekly schedule.  Daily schedules involve one s.c. injection or one i.v. infusion per day for five to seven consecutive days.  Weekly schedules involve one injection or infusion each week, for five or six weeks.  One cycle is normally sufficient to produce a complete response, but in the event of a partial response, cycles may safely be repeated one to three months after the end of the first cycle.

Actual doses are calculated according to the surface area of the patient's skin instead of by weight, and divided by the number of planned treatments.  

All schedules produce the same benefits and disadvantages.  Five-day and seven-day daily schedules give the same total amount of drug and have the same outcomes, including remissions and adverse effects.<ref name="pmid17557550">{{cite journal |author=Aurer I, Mitrović Z, Kovacević-Metelko J, ''et al.'' |title=[Treatment of hairy cell leukemia with cladribine] |language=Croatian |journal=[[Lijec Vjesn]] |volume=129 |issue=3–4 |pages=80–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17557550 |doi=}}</ref> Daily and weekly schedules give the same total amount of drug and have the same outcomes, including similar proportions of complete responses and similar proportions of patients hospitalized for [[febrile neutropenia|fevers]] and [[opportunistic infection]]s.<ref name="pmid17209059">{{cite journal |author=Robak T, Jamroziak K, Gora-Tybor J, ''et al.'' |title=Cladribine in a weekly versus daily schedule for untreated active hairy cell leukemia: final report from the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) of a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial |journal=[[Blood (journal)|Blood]] |volume=109 |issue=9 |pages=3672–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17209059 |doi=10.1182/blood-2006-08-042929 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17209059}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Existing studies estimate that from 18%<ref name="pmid8641392"/> to 42%<ref name="pmid10194424"/> of patients will experience a fever after cladribine infusion.  This is usually a transient fever which can be treated with [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol).<ref name="pmid8539180">{{cite journal |author=Nelson MC, Hogan DK |title=The role of cladribine in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies |journal=[[Oncol Nurs Forum]] |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1395–400 |year=1995 |pmid=8539180 |doi=}}</ref>  These fevers, which resolve in less than 48 hours,<ref name="pmid7820047">{{cite journal |author=Lauria F, Benfenati D, Raspadori D, ''et al.'' |title=Retreatment with 2-CdA of progressed HCL patients |journal=[[Leuk.

}}</ref>  Factors that increased the likelihood of a neutropenic fever (with or without concomitant infection) include:  [[anemia]], [[hypocholesterolemia]], a high proportion of hairy cells in the bone marrow with a low proportion of [[myelopoietic cells]], low [[albumin]], and high [[C-reactive protein]].  These are all signs of an advanced case of HCL.

In patients with hairy cell leukemia, there is no benefit to using [[cytokine|hormones]] such as [[filgrastim]] or [[Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] to raise white blood cell counts prophylactically.<ref name="pmid10194424">{{cite journal |author=Saven A, Burian C, Adusumalli J, Koziol JA |title=Filgrastim for cladribine-induced neutropenic fever in patients with hairy cell leukemia |journal=[[Blood (journal)|Blood]] |volume=93 |issue=8 |pages=2471–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10194424 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10194424}}</ref><ref name="pmid7619752"/>  The use of these expensive drugs does not reduce the number of patients who experience fevers, the number of days that the fevers last, or the number of patients admitted to the hospital for antibiotic treatments.<ref name="pmid10194424"/>  Therefore routine adjunctive use (that is, use when there are no signs of infection) is not recommended.<ref name="pmid10194424"/>{{fixPOV|date=April 2013}}

In addition to fevers, cladribine increases the risk of herpes virus infections, particularly [[shingles]].<ref name="pmid8641392">{{cite journal |author=Van Den Neste E, Delannoy A, Vandercam B, ''et al.'' |title=Infectious complications after 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine therapy |journal=[[Eur. J. Haematol.]] |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=235–40 |year=1996 |pmid=8641392 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0609.1996.tb01935.x}}</ref>  

Some patients develop a [[rash]] after treatment.  Nearly all patients who develop a rash are taking other drugs, notably [[allopurinol]] or a [[sulfa drug]], which are known to cause rashes, and the rash is likely due to these drugs rather than to cladribine itself.<ref name="url" />

Some HCL patients will require [[blood transfusion]]s of platelets or packed red blood cells.<ref name="pmid17557550"/>

Patients are expected to experience a decline in blood cell counts during treatment.  Several weeks after successful treatment, cell counts will begin to rebound, with [[platelet]] and [[neutrophil]] counts recovering before red blood cells and T cells.  [[T4 cell]] counts may never reach pre-disease levels.  Patients are usually advised to avoid sick people and large crowds of people as well as to wash their hands and keep their hands away from their eyes, nose, and mouth until their neutrophil counts have recovered. 

Many patients experience fatigue, even in the absence of [[anemia]], but since fatigue is a common feature of the disease, this may be caused by the disease instead of by the drug. 

This drug does not cause hair loss, vomiting, or other side effects that are commonly associated with "old style" alkylating [[chemotherapy]] drugs. However, [[Cancer pain#Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy|peripheral neuropathy]] has been reported occasionally after repeated doses of cladribine in the treatment of [[hairy cell leukemia]].  Overdose may cause kidney damage.

==Response==
According to the drug's FDA-approved [[prescribing information]],<ref name="url">{{cite web |url=http://www.orthobiotech.com/orthobiotech/shared/OBI/PI/Leustatin_PI.pdf |title=Leustatin prescribing information |date=August 2007 revision |format=PDF |publisher=Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. (a subsidiary of [[Johnson & Johnson]] |pages= }}</ref> the median time to normalization of blood counts in patients with hairy cell leukemia is:  two weeks for [[platelets]], five weeks for [[absolute neutrophil count]]s, eight weeks for [[hemoglobin]], and nine weeks for a patient to have all three parameters normalized.  Weeks are counted from the first day of treatment, and all patients were on a seven-day daily treatment schedule for these studies.

==History==
Cladribine was designed by [[Dennis A. Carson]] as an anti-lymphocyte compound.<ref name=Lichtman />  It was first synthesized at [[Brigham Young University]].<ref>{{cite book
