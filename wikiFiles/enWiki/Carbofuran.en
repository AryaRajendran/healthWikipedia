'''Carbofuran''' is one of the most toxic [[carbamate]] [[pesticide]]s.  It is marketed under the trade names '''Furadan''', by [[FMC Corporation]] and '''Curater''', among several others. It is used to control insects in a wide variety of field crops, including [[potatoes]], [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s. It is a systemic insecticide, which means that the plant absorbs it through the roots, and from here the plant distributes it throughout its organs where insecticidal concentrations are attained. Carbofuran also has contact activity against pests.

Carbofuran usage has increased in recent years because it is one of the few insecticides effective on soybean [[aphid]]s, which have expanded their range since 2002 to include most soybean-growing regions of the [[United States|U.S.]] The main global producer is the FMC Corporation.

==Chemistry==
The technical or chemical name of carbofuran is 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl methylcarbamate and its [[CAS number]] is 1563-66-2.  It is manufactured by the reaction of [[methyl isocyanate]] with 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-hydroxybenzofuran.

==Bans==
Carbofuran is banned in [[Canada]] and the [[European Union]].

In 2008, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) announced that it intends to ban carbofuran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/carbofuran/carbofuran_noic.htm|title=Carbofuran Cancellation Process|last=US EPA|date=31 July 2008|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref> In December of that year, [[FMC Corp.]], the sole US manufacturer of carbofuran, announced that it had voluntarily requested that the [[United States]] Environmental Protection Agency cancel all but 6 of the previously allowed uses of that chemical as a pesticide.  With this change, carbofuran usage in the US would be allowed only on maize, potatoes, pumpkins, sunflowers, pine seedlings and spinach grown for seed.<ref>''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'', 5 January 2009, "Manufacturer drops Carbofuran uses", p. 18</ref> However, in May 2009 EPA cancelled all food tolerances, an action which amounts to a de facto ban on its use on all crops grown for human consumption.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2009/2009-05-11-093.asp|title=EPA Bans Carbofuran Pesticide Residues on Food|date=11 May 2009|publisher=Environmental News Service|accessdate=5 June 2009}}</ref>

Kenya is considering banning carbofuran,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2358933/ |title=unknown | publisher=tradingmarkets.com}}{{dead link |date=September 2012}}</ref> but it is legal to buy [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] in Kenya.<ref name="BBC" />

It was reported in 2012 that whilst Wildlife Minister in the UK, [[Richard Benyon]], who owns both pheasant and grouse shoots, refused a request from other MPs that possession of carbofuran should be made a criminal offence.<ref name=indy>Michael McCarthy, [http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/fury-at-minister-richard-benyons-astounding-refusal-to-ban-deadly-bird-poison-8215803.html "Fury at minister Richard Benyon's 'astounding' refusal to ban deadly bird poison"], independent.co.uk, 20 October 2012. Accessed 20 October 2012.</ref> Green Party MP [[Caroline Lucas]] was quoted as saying: "The minister's shocking refusal to outlaw the possession of a poison used only by rogue gamekeepers to illegally kill birds of prey would be inexplicable were it not for his own cosy links to the shooting lobby."<ref name=indy/>

== Toxicity to vertebrates ==
Carbofuran is highly toxic to vertebrates with an oral {{LD50}} of 8–14&nbsp;mg/kg in rats and 19&nbsp;mg/kg in dogs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Carbofuran is known to be particularly toxic to birds.  In its granular form, a single grain will kill a bird.  Birds often eat numerous grains of the pesticide, mistaking them for seeds, and then die shortly thereafter.  Before the granular form was banned by [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extoxnet.orst.edu/pips/carbofur.htm |title=Carbofuran | accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> it was blamed for millions of bird deaths per year.  The liquid version of the pesticide is less hazardous to birds since they are not as likely to ingest it directly, but it is still very hazardous.  The EPA announced on July 25, 2008 that it intends to ban all forms in the US.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/us/25brfs-EPATOBANUSEO_BRF.html |title=E.P.A. to Ban Use of a Pesticide |newspaper=New York Times |first=Ashley |last=Southall |date=25 July 2008 | accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> The ban requires that no residue be present on domestic or imported foods.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/07/24/ST2008072403523.html |title=In Surprise Move, EPA Bans Carbofuran Residue on Food |newspaper=Washington Post |first=Juliet |last=Eilperin |date=25 July 2008 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>

Carbofuran has been illegally used to intentionally poison wildlife in the US, Canada and Great Britain; poisoned wildlife have included coyotes, kites, golden eagles and buzzards. Secondary fatal poisoning of domestic and wild animals has been documented,<ref>Wobeser et al. 2004. Secondary poisoning of eagles following intentional poisoning of coyotes with anticholinesterase pesticides in Western Canada. ''Journal of Wildlife Diseases'' 40(2):163-172.</ref><ref>''The Federal Wildlife Officer'', Volume 10, No. 2, Summer 1996</ref> specifically, [[Bird of prey|raptors]] ([[bald eagles]] and [[golden eagles]]), domestic dogs, [[raccoon]]s, [[vulture]]s and other scavengers.  In [[Kenya]], farmers are using carbofuran to kill lions and other predators.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news | publisher = BBC news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7460008.stm | title = Insecticide 'killing Kenya lions' | first=Adam | last=Mynott | date=18 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=CBS>{{cite news | publisher = CBS 60 Minutes | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/26/60minutes/main4894945.shtml | title = Poison Takes Toll on Africa's Lions}}</ref>

In a number of publicized incidents worldwide, carbofuran has also been used to poison domestic pets.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cyprus-mail.com/pets/alarm-over-new-poison/20110526 | title = Alarm over new pet poison | newspaper= Cyprus Mail | date = May 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Psi u naselju Braće Jerković otrovani pesticidima | publisher = Blic Online | date = 25. 02. 2011 | url = http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Beograd/237881/Psi-u-naselju-Brace-Jerkovic-otrovani-pesticidima | language = Serbian}}</ref>

===Toxicity to humans===
Carbofuran has one of the highest acute toxicities to humans of any insecticide widely used on field crops (only [[aldicarb]] and [[parathion]] are more toxic).  A quarter teaspoon (1 mL) can be fatal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Most carbofuran is applied by commercial applicators using closed systems with engineered controls so there is no exposure to it in preparation.  Since its toxic effects are due to its activity as a [[cholinesterase]] inhibitor it is considered a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] pesticide.

Carbofuran is also a powerful endocrine disruptor that can cause transient alterations in the concentration of many hormones in animals and humans even at extremely low doses. These alterations may consequently lead to serious reproductive problems following repeated exposure.<ref name=pmid20021136>{{cite journal | pmid = 20021136 | year = 2004 | last1 = Goad | first1 = RT | last2 = Goad | first2 = JT | last3 = Atieh | first3 = BH | last4 = Gupta | first4 = RC | title = Carbofuran-induced endocrine disruption in adult male rats | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 233–9 | doi = 10.1080/15376520490434476 | journal = Toxicology mechanisms and methods}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17674859 | year = 2007 | last1 = Lau | first1 = TK | last2 = Chu | first2 = W | last3 = Graham | first3 = N | title = Degradation of the endocrine disruptor carbofuran by UV, O3 and O3/UV | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 275–80 | journal = Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research}}</ref> In one study, the exposure of rats to sublethal amounts of carbofuran decreased [[testosterone]] by 88%, while the levels of [[progesterone]], [[cortisol]], and [[estradiol]] were significantly increased (1279%, 202%, and 150%, respectively).<ref name=pmid20021136/>

Carbofuran can also be toxic to testes in sublethal amounts. A decrease in sperm motility, sperm count along with increase in percent abnormal sperm was observed at 0.4&nbsp;mg/kg dose level.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9192206 | year = 1997 | last1 = Pant | first1 = N | last2 = Shankar | first2 = R | last3 = Srivastava | first3 = SP | title = In utero and lactational exposure of carbofuran to rats: effect on testes and sperm | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 267–72 | journal = Human & Experimental Toxicology}}</ref>

===Health scare in Thailand===
Due to nonregistration of 4 [[carcinogenic]] chemicals used on crops not listed in the [[Dangerous Substances Act]] of [[Thailand]], vegetables with residues of [[methomyl]], carbofuran, [[dicrotophos]], and [[EPN (insecticide)|EPN]] were taken off supermarket shelves in July 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/302017/cancer-causing-chemical-residues-found-in-vegetables | title=Cancer-causing chemical residues found in vegetables | newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]] | date=12 July 2012 | accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>
