'''Rouleaux''' (singular is '''rouleau''') are stacks of [[red blood cells]] (RBCs) which form because of the unique [[discoid]] shape of the cells in [[vertebrates]]. The flat surface of the discoid RBCs give them a large surface area to make contact and stick to each other; thus, forming a rouleau. They occur when the plasma [[protein]] concentration is high, and because of them the ESR ([[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]) is also increased. This is a non-specific indicator of the presence of disease. <ref>Oxford Textbook of Medicine</ref>

Conditions which cause rouleaux formation include [[infections]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[inflammation|inflammatory]] and connective tissue disorders, and [[cancers]]. It also occurs in [[diabetes mellitus]] and is one of the causative factors for microvascular occlusion in [[diabetic retinopathy]]. 

Acute phase proteins, particularly [[fibrinogen]], interact with [[sialic acid]] on the surface of RBCs to facilitate the formation of rouleaux. An increase in the ratio of RBCs to [[blood plasma|plasma]] volume, as seen in the setting of [[anaemia]] and hypovolemia, increases rouleaux formation and accelerates sedimentation.
Rouleaux formation is retarded by [[albumins|albumin proteins]]. 

Rouleaux formations are also adopted by [[spermatozoa]] as a means of cooperation between genetically similar gametocytes so as to improve reproductive success through enhanced motility and, therefore, fertilization capacity—e.g., the [[guinea pig]].

==Kinetics of Linear Rouleaux Formation==
According to [[Smoluchowski]], the [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of aggregation of colloids is based on the assumption that each particle is surrounded by a "sphere influence.” Single spherical particles, which undergo [[Brownian motion]] collide and sticking of particles happens. As aggregation proceeds, the average diffusion constant of the aggregate population decreases. The aggregation of red blood cells progresses in the same manner except that cells are [[biconcave]] rather than spherical.
