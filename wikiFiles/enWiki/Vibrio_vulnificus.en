'''''Vibrio vulnificus''''' is a species of [[Gram-negative]], motile, curved, rod-shaped [[Bacterium|bacteria]] of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]''. Present in marine environments such as [[Estuary|estuaries]], brackish ponds, or coastal areas, ''V. vulnificus'' is related to ''[[Vibrio cholerae|''V. cholerae'']]'', the causative agent of [[cholera]].<ref name=Doyle_2001_species>{{cite book | author = Oliver JD, Kaper J | title = Vibrio species. pp. 263-300 In: Food Microbiology: Fundamentals and Frontiers.

==Signs and symptoms==
''Vibrio vulnificus'' causes an infection often incurred after eating [[seafood]], especially raw or undercooked oysters. V. vulnificus does not alter the appearance, taste, or odor of oysters.<ref name=CDCFAQOysters>{{cite web|title=Vibrio vulnificus General Information Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/vibriov/#oysters|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref> the bacteria can also enter the body through open [[wound]]s when swimming or wading in infected waters,<ref name=Oliver_2005_Wound /> or via puncture wounds from the spines of fish such as [[tilapia]]. 

Symptoms include vomiting, [[diarrhea]], abdominal pain, and a [[blister]]ing [[dermatitis]] that is sometimes mistaken for [[pemphigus]] or [[pemphigoid]]. 

''V. vulnificus'' is eighty times more likely to spread into the bloodstream in people with compromised [[immune system]]s, especially those with chronic liver disease. When this happens, severe symptoms including blistering skin lesions, septic shock, and even death can occur.<ref>{{cite web | title=Vibrio vulnificus  | work=NCBI Genome Project  | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=genomeprj&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Overview&list_uids=12341  | accessdate=2005-09-01 }}</ref><ref name=CDCFAQType>{{cite web|title=Vibrio vulnificus General Information Frequently Asked Questions What type of illness does V. vulnificus cause?|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/vibriov/#type|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref> This severe infection may occur regardless of whether the infection began via contaminated food or via an open wound.<ref name=CDCFAQType />

==Treatment==
''Vibrio vulnificus'' wound infections have a mortality of approximately 25%. In patients in whom the infection worsens into septicemia, typically following ingestion, the mortality rate rises dramatically to 50%. The majority of these patients die within the first 48 hours of infection. The optimal treatment is not known, but, in one retrospective study of 93 patients in Taiwan, use of a third-generation [[cephalosporin]] and a [[tetracycline]] (e.g., [[ceftriaxone]] and [[doxycycline]], respectively) were associated with an improved outcome.<ref name="Liu2006">{{cite journal | year=2006 | volume=166 | issue=19 | pages=2117&ndash;23 | title=Prognostic factors and antibiotics in ''Vibrio vulnificus'' septicemia | author=Liu JW | pmid=17060542 | doi=10.1001/archinte.166.19.2117 | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine | author-separator=, | author2=Lee IK | author3=Tang HJ | display-authors=3 | last4=Ko | first4=W.-C. | last5=Lee | first5=H.-C. | last6=Liu | first6=Y.-C. | last7=Hsueh | first7=P.-R. | last8=Chuang | first8=Y.-C. | unused_data=Arch Intern Med }}</ref>  Prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm this finding, but ''in vitro'' data support the supposition this combination is synergistic against ''Vibrio vulnificus''. Similarly, the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend treating the patient with a quinolone or intravenous doxycycline with [[ceftazidime]].<ref>http://www.issc.org/client_resources/Education/VvFactSheet.pdf</ref>

''V. vulnificus'' often causes large, disfiguring ulcers that require extensive [[Wiktionary:debride|debridement]] or even amputation.

''V. vulnificus'' is commonly found in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], where more than dozen people have died from the infection since 2000.<ref>http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/11/still-too-many-raw-oyster-deaths/#.UMNnAYM0IVQ</ref>

==Prognosis==
The worst prognosis is in those patients who arrive at hospital in a state of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. Total mortality in treated patients (ingestion and wound) is around 33%.<ref name="Liu2006"/>

Patients especially vulnerable are those with liver disease (especially [[cirrhosis]] and [[hepatitis]]) or [[immunocompromised]] states ([[cancer]], bone marrow suppression, [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]], [[diabetes]], etc.). With these cases, ''V. vulnificus'' usually enters the bloodstream where it may cause fever and chills, septic shock (with sharply decreased blood pressure), and blistering skin lesions.<ref name=Doyle_2005_Oceans>{{cite book | author = Oliver JD, Kaper J | title = Vibrio vulnificus.

(Belken SS, Colwell RR, editors) | edition = 2nd | publisher = Springer Science | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-387-23708-9 }}</ref> According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), about half of those who contract blood infections die.

''Vibrio vulnificus'' infections also disproportionately affect males; 85% of those who develop [[endotoxic]] shock from the bacteria are male. Females who have had an [[oophorectomy]] experienced increased mortality rates, as  [[estrogen]] has been shown experimentally to have a protective effect against ''V. vulnificus''.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Merkel SM, Alexander S, Zufall E, Oliver JD, Huet-Hudson YM | title=Essential Role for Estrogen in Protection against Vibrio vulnificus-Induced Endotoxic Shock | journal=Infection and Immunity | volume=69 | issue=10 | year=2001 | pages=6119–22 | pmid=11553550 | doi=10.1128/IAI.69.10.6119-6122.2001 | pmc=98741}}

==History==
The pathogen was first isolated in 1976 from a series of blood culture samples submitted to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] in Atlanta.<ref name="pmid1262454"/> It was  described as a "lactose-positive vibrio".<ref name="pmid1262454">{{cite journal |author=Hollis DG, Weaver RE, Baker CN, Thornsberry C |title=Halophilic Vibrio species isolated from blood cultures |journal=J.
