'''Bronchitis'''  is an inflammation of the [[mucous membranes]] of the [[bronchi]] (the larger and medium-sized airways that carry airflow from the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] into the more distal parts of the [[lung]] [[parenchyma]]).<ref name="Medline">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/chronicbronchitis.html |title=Chronic Bronchitis |author=National Lung, Heart, and Blood Institute |year=2012 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="Mayo">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bronchitis/DS00031|title=Bronchitis Definition |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |year=2011 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="lung">{{cite web |url=http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/bronchitis-chronic/understanding-chronic-bronchitis.html |title=Understanding Chronic Bronchitis |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=American Lung Association |accessdate=30 December 2012}}

[[Acute bronchitis]] is characterized by the development of a [[cough]], with or without the production of [[sputum]] ([[mucus]] that is [[expectorated]], or "coughed up", from the [[respiratory tract]]). Acute bronchitis often occurs during the course of an acute viral illness such as the [[common cold]] or [[influenza]].

[[Chronic bronchitis]], a type of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder|COPD]], is characterized by the presence of a [[productive cough]] that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years.

==Acute bronchitis==
{{Main|Acute bronchitis}}
[[Acute bronchitis]] is a self-limited infection of the lower respiratory tract causing inflammation of the [[bronchi]].

Bronchitis may be diagnosed by a physician during a thorough physical examination. Due to the nonspecific signs and symptoms exhibited by individuals with bronchitis, diagnostic tests such as a chest [[x-ray]] to rule out pneumonia, a [[sputum culture]] to rule out [[whooping cough]] or other bacterial respiratory infections, or a [[pulmonary function test]] to rule out asthma or emphysema may be used.<ref name="Diagnosis">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bronchitis/DS00031/DSECTION=tests%2Dand%2Ddiagnosis|title=Bronchitis: Tests and diagnosis |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |year=2011 |work= |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>

Treatment for acute bronchitis is primarily symptomatic. [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) may be used to treat fever and sore throat. Even with no treatment, most cases of acute bronchitis resolve quickly.<ref name="ID"/>

Most cases of acute bronchitis are caused by viruses, therefore [[antibiotic]]s are not generally recommended as they are only effective against bacteria.<ref name="Cause"/><ref name="treatment"/> Using antibiotics in cases of viral bronchitis promotes the development of [[antibiotic-resistant bacteria]], which may lead to greater [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]].<ref name="Family"/> However, even in cases of viral bronchitis, antibiotics may be indicated in certain cases in order to prevent the occurrence of [[Secondary infection|secondary bacterial infections]].<ref name="treatment"/>
