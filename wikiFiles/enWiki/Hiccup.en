A '''hiccup'''  ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|ɪ|k|ə|p}} {{respell|HIK|əp}}) is an involuntary contraction (myoclonic jerk) of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] that may repeat several times per minute. In [[medicine]] it is known as '''synchronous diaphragmatic flutter''' (SDF), or '''singultus''', Latin for the act of catching one's breath while sobbing.<ref name="emedicine">{{Cite web| url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/775746-overview | title = Hiccups | last = Wilkes | first = Garry | date = 2 August 2007 | work = eMedicine | publisher = Medscape | accessdate = 2009-04-22 }}</ref> The hiccup is an [[involuntary action]] involving a [[reflex arc]].<ref name=emedicine/> Once triggered, the reflex causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm followed about 0.25 seconds later by closure of the vocal cords, which results in the classic "hic" sound. At the same time, the normal [[peristalsis]] of the [[esophagus]] is suppressed. 

Hiccups may occur individually, or they may occur in bouts. The rhythm of the hiccup, or the time between hiccups, tends to be relatively constant. 

A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many [[home remedy|home remedies]] are often used to attempt to shorten the duration.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.home-remedies-for-you.com/remedy/Hiccups.html | title =Hiccups | accessdate=5 November 2011 | publisher = Home Remedies }}</ref> Medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups.

===Phylogenetic hypothesis===

It has been proposed that the hiccup is an evolutionary remnant of earlier [[amphibian]] [[respiratory system|respiration]]. <ref name=Straus>{{Cite journal|title=A phylogenetic hypothesis for the origin of hiccough|journal=BioEssays|year=2003 | month=February|first=C.|last=Straus|volume=25|issue=2|pages=182–188|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/102526391/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0=Abstract|format=|doi=10.1002/bies.10224|pmid=12539245|last2=Vasilakos|first2=K|last3=Wilson|first3=RJ|last4=Oshima|first4=T|last5=Zelter|first5=M|last6=Derenne|first6=JP|last7=Similowski|first7=T|last8=Whitelaw|first8=WA}}</ref>  Amphibians such as [[tadpole]]s gulp air and water across their gills via a rather simple motor reflex akin to [[mammal]]ian hiccuping. The motor pathways that enable hiccuping form early during [[fetus|fetal]] development, before the motor pathways that enable normal [[lung]] ventilation form. Thus, according to [[recapitulation theory]] the hiccup is [[evolution]]arily antecedent to modern [[lung]] [[respiratory system|respiration]]. Additionally, they point out that hiccups and [[amphibian]] gulping are inhibited by elevated [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and may be stopped by [[GABA B receptor|GABA<small>B</small>]] [[Sensory receptor|receptor]] [[agonist]]s, illustrating a possible shared physiology and [[evolution]]ary heritage. These proposals may explain why [[premature birth|premature infants]] spend 2.5% of their time hiccuping{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}, possibly gulping like [[amphibian]]s, as their [[lung]]s are not yet fully formed.
Fetal intrauterine hiccups are of two types. The physiological type occurs prior to twenty-eight weeks after conception and tend to last five to ten minutes. These hiccups are part of fetal development and are associated with the myelination of the [[phrenic nerve]], which primarily controls the [[thoracic diaphragm]]. 
The phylogeny hypothesis explains how the hiccup reflex might have evolved, and if there is not an explanation it may explain hiccups as an evolutionary remnant, held-over from our amphibious ancestors.

This hypothesis has been questioned because of the existence of the afferent loop of the reflex, the fact that it does not explain the reason for glottic closure, and because the very short contraction of the hiccup is unlikely to have a significant strengthening effect on the slow-twitch muscles of respiration.

=== Clearance of air from stomach ===
A more recent explanation by Howes in 2012 suggests that hiccups may have evolved along with other reflexes developed in mammals that allow them to coordinate suckling milk and breathing.<ref name="Howes2012">{{cite doi|10.1002/bies.201100194}}</ref> Hiccups are only found in mammals, and are most common in infants, becoming rarer as mammals age.  This may suggest that they evolved to allow air trapped in the stomach of suckling infants to escape, allowing more milk to be ingested. 
The hypothesis suggests that the air bubble in the stomach stimulates the sensory limb of the reflex at receptors in the stomach, esophagus and along the diaphragm. This triggers the hiccup, which creates suction in the chest, pulling air from the stomach up and out through the mouth, effectively burping the animal. 
This theory is supported by the strong tendency for infants to get hiccups, the component of the reflex that suppresses peristalsis in the esophagus, and the existence of hiccups only in milk-drinking mammals.

== Signs and symptoms ==

* A single or a series of breathing diaphragm spasms, of variable spacing and duration.
* A brief (less than one half second), unexpected, shoulder, abdomen, throat, or full body tremor.
* Hiccups might be easily heard as a chirp, squeak, "hupp", or if controlled, a quick inhaling gasp, sigh, or sniff.
* The victim might complain of brief but distracting or painful, frequent or occasional interruptions in normal breath, with sudden momentary pain of the throat, chest, or abdomen.

==Causes==
* Rapid eating <ref name="Howes2012" />
* Carbonated beverages, [[alcohol]], dry breads, and some spicy foods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/pediatrics/pdf/newsletter_win09.pdf |title=Hiccups Happen! |publisher=University of Maryland Hospital for Children |date= |accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref>

== Pathologic Causes for Hiccups ==

Hiccups may be triggered by a number of common human conditions. Rarely, they can be a sign of serious medical problems.

=== Pre-phrenic nucleus irritation of medulla===

Clinical case reports mention that lesions of the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] that involve the area slightly ventral and lateral to nucleus and [[tractus solitarius]] cause hiccups. One (of several) explanations for this finding is that such a lesion “irritates” descending information from [[nucleus solitarius]] to the [[phrenic]] nucleus. The phrenic nucleus consists of a functionally related group of cell bodies in the [[Anterior horn of spinal cord|ventral horn]] from C3-C5. Axons arising from the phrenic nucleus comprise the [[phrenic nerve]], which innervates the diaphragm. The hiccups result from spasmodic lowering of the diaphragm that causes a short, sharp inspiratory cough. [[Brain stem]] lesions involving the area ventral and lateral to nucleus and tractus solitarius result in hiccup.<ref name="Medical Neurosciences">[http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/virtualbrain/BrainStem/11Solitarius.html], additional text.</ref>

==Treatment==

Numerous medical remedies exist but no particular treatment is known to be especially effective.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Hiccups | encyclopedia = The Merck Manual Online | editor-last = Porter | editor-first = Robert S. | publisher = Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme | year = 2011 | url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gastrointestinal_disorders/approach_to_the_patient_with_upper_gi_complaints/hiccups.html }}</ref> Many drugs have been used, such as [[baclofen]], [[chlorpromazine]], [[metoclopramide]], [[gabapentin]], and various [[proton-pump inhibitor]]s. Hiccups that are secondary to some other cause like [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] or [[esophageal web]]s are dealt with by treating the underlying disorder. A simple treatment involves increasing the [[partial pressure]] of [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and inhibiting diaphragm activity by holding one’s breath or rebreathing into a [[paper bag]]. [[Vagus nerve stimulation]] can improve hiccups, done at home by irritating the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] through swallowing dry bread or crushed ice, or by applying [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]] to the tongue, or by stimulating the [[gag reflex]]. The [[phrenic nerve]] can be [[nerve block|blocked]] temporarily with injection of 0.5% [[procaine]], or permanently with bilateral phrenicotomy or other forms of surgical destruction. Even this rather drastic treatment does not cure some cases, however.

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [[Aristophanes]] has a case of the hiccups and is advised by Eryximachus, a physician, to cure them by holding his breath, or, failing that, by [[gargle|gargling]] or provoking [[sneeze|sneezing]]. This ancient recommendation can be compared with the vagal nerve stimulation techniques mentioned previously.

An anecdotal medical approach is to install [[lidocaine]] liniment 3% or gel 2% in the external ear. Somehow this creates a vagus nerve-triggering reflex through its extensions to the external ear and tympanus (ear drum). The effect can be immediate, and also have lasting effect after the lidocaine effect expires after about two hours.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Miracle hiccough cure gets the attention it deserves  | publisher = BMJ  | date = 2006-10-07  | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7580/1222.3.extract  }}</ref>

Hiccups are treated medically only in severe and persistent (termed "intractable") cases, such as in the case of Jennifer Mee, a 19-year-old woman who, in 2007, hiccuped continuously for five weeks.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Teen's hiccups stop after five weeks | publisher = ABC News Online | date = 2007-03-02 (Broken Link) | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200703/s1861793.htm }}</ref> [[Haloperidol]] (Haldol, an anti-psychotic and sedative), [[metoclopramide]] (Reglan, a gastrointestinal stimulant), and [[chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine, an anti-psychotic with strong sedative effects) are used in cases of intractable hiccups. Effective treatment with sedatives often requires a dose that renders the person either unconscious or highly lethargic. Hence, medicating with sedatives is only appropriate short-term, as the affected individual cannot continue with normal life activities while under their effect.

Persistent and intractable hiccups due to [[electrolyte]] imbalance ([[hypokalemia]], [[hyponatremia]]) may benefit from drinking a carbonated beverage containing salt to normalize the potassium–sodium balance in the nervous system.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The carbonation promotes quicker absorption. [[Carbonated beverages]], including beer, by themselves may provoke hiccups in some people.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The administration of intranasal [[vinegar]] was found to ease the chronic and severe hiccups of a three-year old Japanese girl. Vinegar may stimulate the dorsal wall of the nasopharynx, where the pharyngeal branch of the [[glossopharyngeal]] nerve (the [[afferent nerve|afferent]] of the hiccup reflex arc) is located.<ref name="Iwasaki">{{Cite journal| last = Iwasaki | first = N | coauthors = et al. | title = Hiccup treated by administration of intranasal vinegar | journal = No to Hattatsu | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 202–5 | year = 2007 | month = May | pmid = 17515134 }}</ref>

Bryan R. Payne, a neurosurgeon at the [[Louisiana State University]] Health Sciences Center in [[New Orleans]], has had some success with an experimental procedure in which a [[vagus nerve]] stimulator is implanted in the upper chest of patients with an intractable case of hiccups. "It sends rhythmic bursts of [[electricity]] to the [[brain]] by way of the [[vagus nerve]], which passes through the neck. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved the vagus nerve stimulator in 1997 as a way to control seizures in some patients with [[epilepsy]]."<ref>{{Cite news| last = Schaffer | first = Amanda | title = A Horrific Case of Hiccups, a Novel Treatment  | publisher = New York Times | date = 2006-01-10 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/10/health/10hicc.html | accessdate = 2008-04-24 }}</ref>

Lockhart stated that hiccups can sometimes be cured by pinching the skin that covers the surface of the deltoid muscles, thus pinching the phrenic nerve branch located there .<ref name="LOCKHART"> | first = LOCKHART | coauthors =  R.

In Slavic, Baltic and Hungarian folklore, it is said that hiccups occur when the person experiencing them is being talked about by someone not present. Hiccups in Indian and Arabic folklore are similarly said to occur when the person experiencing them is being thought of by somebody close.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
