'''Sócrates Brasileiro Sampaio de Souza Vieira de Oliveira''', [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] (19 February 1954&nbsp;– 4 December 2011), simply '''Sócrates''', was a Brazilian [[association football|footballer]] who played as an [[Midfielder#Attacking|attacking midfielder]]. He was also a qualified [[Physician|doctor]].

He played for [[Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP)|Botafogo-SP]] before joining [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] in 1978. He then moved to Italy to play for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], returning to Brazil in 1985 to end his career.

Sócrates was a technical playmaker, known for great through passes and his vision on the field, as well as his physical strength. He was also a two-footed player and a prolific goal scorer. His ability to read the game was highly valued, and his signature move was the blind heel pass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xtratime.org/forum/showthread.php?t=246965|title=The Greatest Offensive Midfielders of All-Time - Xtratime Community|publisher=Xtratime|date=|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> He was considered to be one of the greatest midfielders ever to play the game.<ref name=bbc_dies_at_57>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/16017071.stm|title=Brazil football legend Socrates dies at 57|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=4 December 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> Easily recognizable for his beard and headband, he became the "symbol of cool for a whole generation of football supporters".<ref name=Obituary>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16019637.stm|title=Obituary: Socrates|work=BBC Sport|last=Jurejko|first=Jonathan|date=4 December 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Club career===
Sócrates was born in [[Belém do Pará, Brazil|Belém do Pará]].<ref name=Obituary/> He began playing football professionally in 1974 for [[Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP)|Botafogo-SP]] in his native [[Ribeirão Preto]], but spent the majority of his career (1978 to 1984) with [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], scoring 41 goals in 59 [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] games, and 172 goals in 297 matches in total.<ref name=formidable>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/dec/04/socrates?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Sócrates: Formidable captain of the Brazilian team in the 1982 World Cup|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Glanville|first=Brian|location=London|date=4 December 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Sócrates lived in Ribeirão Preto with his wife and six children. He was a columnist for a number of newspapers and magazines, writing not only about sports, but also politics and economics. He frequently appeared on Brazilian TV programmes as a football pundit. At the time of his death, Sócrates was writing a fiction book about the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2010/jun/13/socrates-brazil-football-world-cup|title=Sócrates: 'Everyone who comes to Brazil falls in love with someone'|work=The Guardian|last=Bellos|first=Alex|location=UK|date=13 June 2010|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

Sócrates was a [[physician|doctor of medicine]], a rare achievement for a professional footballer (he was a graduate of the [[Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Greatest Who Never Won a World Cup|url=http://www.life.com/gallery/43621/image/1555549/greatest-who-never-won-a-world-cup#index/20|publisher=Life|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> Even rarer is the fact that he earned the degree while concurrently playing professional [[association football|football]]. After retiring as a player he practised medicine at [[Ribeirão Preto]].<ref name=Obituary />

He was also noted for being an intellectual, a heavy drinker and a smoker.<ref name="7SINS"/> His younger brother [[Raí]] was also a footballer and an attacking midfielder, being a member of the Brazilian team that won the World Cup in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], notably playing for [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] and for [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/12/04/soccer-brazil-socrates-idINDEE7B301Z20111204|title=Former Brazil captain Socrates dies at 57|work=Reuters India|last=Ramil|first=Tatiana|date=4 December 2011|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://nytimes.com/1994/07/09/sports/09iht-rob_4.html "Europe's surprising challenge to the latin game"].

==Politics==
During his time at Corinthians, Sócrates co-founded the [[Corinthians Democracy]] movement, in opposition to the then-ruling [[Brazilian military government|military government]]. Sócrates and his team mates protested against the regime's treatment of footballers, and showed support to the wider movement for [[democratisation]], by wearing shirts with "Democracia" written on them during games.<ref name="soc">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/s-crates-midfielder-anti-dictatorship-resister|title=Sócrates – midfielder and anti-dictatorship resister|publisher=Libcom|date=12 July 2007|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> Sócrates has stated that three of his childhood heroes were [[Fidel Castro]], [[Che Guevara]] and [[John Lennon]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1193868_andy_mitten_column|title=Andy Mitten Column: Interview with Socrates|work=Manchester Evening News|last=Mitten|first=Andy|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> "[[Lula]] was good, he said, but earned a mere seven or so out of ten for how he had governed Brazil."<ref>{{cite news |title=Sócrates |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541371 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>

==Legacy and death==
[[Pelé]] named Sócrates as one of the [[FIFA 100|Top 125 Living Footballers]] in March 2004 and [[World Soccer Magazine|World Soccer]] named him one of [[World soccer players of the 20th century|100 best footballers]] in history. In October 2008, he was inducted into the [[Brazil national football team#Brazilian Football Museum – Hall of Fame|Pacaembu Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame]].

On 19 August 2011, Sócrates was admitted to intensive care in the [[Albert Einstein Hospital]] in São Paulo with [[gastrointestinal bleeding]] secondary to [[portal hypertension]] and was discharged nine days later.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14602583.stm|title=Former Brazil captain Socrates discharged from hospital|work=BBC Sport|date=27 August 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> The following month he spent 17 days in hospital with a liver ailment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/dec/04/brazil-socrates-dies-hospital-57?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=Former Brazil captain Sócrates dies in hospital at the age of 57|work=The Guardian|author=Reuters|date=4 December 2011|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> On 1 December 2011, he was hospitalised with food poisoning which developed into [[septic shock]] and he was put on life-support.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/dec/03/socrates-life-support-hospital-shock|title=Sócrates on life support in hospital after suffering from septic shock|work=The Guardian|date=3 December 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> He died on 4 December 2011 at the age of 57.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/584/brazil/2011/12/04/2787074/breaking-news-brazil-legend-socrates-dies-aged-57|title=Breaking news: Brazil legend Socrates dies aged 57|work=[[Goal.com]]|date=4 December 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> He was survived by his wife and six children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/soccer/story/?id=381947|date=4 December 2011|title=Former Brazil Soccer Captain Socrates Dies at 57|publisher=TSN|date=4 December 2011|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref>

[[President of Brazil]], [[Dilma Rousseff]], paid tribute, saying Brazil had lost "one of its most cherished sons". "On the field, with his talent and sophisticated touches, he was a genius. Off the field... he was active politically, concerned with his people and his country."<ref name=bbc_dies_at_57/>

Corinthians fans held up signs in tribute and there was a moment of silence before the team's match against Palmeiras (a 0–0 draw which secured Corinthians their first Brazilian title for six years).<ref name=bbc_dies_at_57/> Fiorentina held a minute's silence before their league match against [[A.S.

==Myths==
There is a persistent myth that Sócrates studied medicine in Dublin, Ireland, and that during this time he played reserve football for [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|University College Dublin]] The rumour gained some credibility following articles in several newspapers apparently confirming it, in one case even citing a confirmation by a named source within the [[Football Association of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/sep/13/newsstory.sport4|title=Knowledge Unlimited|work=The Guardian|author=Sean Ingle|location=UK|date=13 September 2000|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/jan/10/theknowledge.sport|title=Shooting from the hip|work=The Guardian|last1=Ingle|first1=Sean|last2=Murray|first2=Scott|location=UK|date=10 January 2002|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> The story is, however, untrue, and has been debunked in other newspaper articles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucdhiddenhistory.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/1-ucd-legends-debunked-socrates/|title=1.
