'''Vaccination and religion''' have interrelations of varying kinds.

==Historical==

The influential Massachusetts preacher [[Cotton Mather]] was the first known person to attempt inoculation on a large scale, inoculating himself and over 200 members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor. While his pro-health view became standard, he also caused the first reaction against the practice. Several [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] clergymen and devout physicians formed the Anti-vaccination Society in 1798.  Others complained that the practice was dangerous, going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder.<ref>{{cite book |chapter= Theological opposition to inoculation, vaccination, and the use of anæsthetics |title= A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom |author= Andrew Dickson White |publisher=Appleton |year= 1896 |chapterurl=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html |accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was the first state in America to make vaccination mandatory, in 1908.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccineInfo/vaccine_detail.cfv?id=26 |title= Vaccine Information (Smallpox) |publisher= National Network for Immunization Information |date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> 

Iceland in 1816 made the clergy responsible for small pox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices.<ref>{{cite book |author= Pétursson P |year=1983 |title= Church and Social Change: A Study of the Secularization Process in Iceland, 1830–1930 |series= Studies in religious experience and behaviour, nr. 4 |location= Helsingborg, Sweden |publisher= Plus Ultra |pages= 70, 79 |isbn=91-970355-9-9}}</ref>
When [[vaccination]] was introduced into [[United Kingdom|UK]] public policy, and adoption followed overseas, there was opposition from social cranks and trade unionists, including sectarian ministers and those interested in self-help and alternative medicines like homeopathy.<ref>Durbach, Nadja. 2005.

Anti-vaccination proponents were most common in Protestant countries. Those that were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism, including Quakers in England and Baptists in Sweden.<ref>Bourdelais, Patrice. 2006.''

Catholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Indians during an 1862 smallpox epidemic.<ref>{{Cite book |author= Boyd RW | title=The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence: Introduced Infectious Diseases and Population Decline Among Northwest Coast Indians, 1774–1874 | year=1999 | publisher= University of Washington Press | location=Seattle |isbn=0-295-97837-6 |chapter= A final disaster: the 1862 smallpox epidemic in coastal British Columbia |pages=172–201}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], vaccination was provided free starting in 1840 under the Vaccination Act. In 1873, a further [[Vaccination/Vaccination acts|Vaccination Act]] made vaccination compulsory. Resistance to compulsion grew, and in 1885--after riots in [[Leicester]]--a '''Royal Commission''' sat and reported seven years later, recommending the abolition of cumulative penalties. This was accomplished in the '''1898''' Act, which introduced a conscience clause that allowed parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe to obtain exemption. This extended the concept of the "[[conscientious objector]]" in English law. <!-- see Talk and Hansard-->

[[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], religions with dietary prohibitions that regard particular animals as unclean, make exceptions for medical treatments derived from those animals.<ref>{{cite web |author= Mynors G, Ghalamkari H, Beaumont S, Powell S, McGee P |url=http://www.npci.org.uk/therapeutics/cardio/diabetes1/resources/library_other_publications_drugs_of_porcine_origin.pdf |title=Drugs of porcine origin and their clinical alternatives: an introductory guide |format=PDF |publisher= National Prescribing Centre |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immunize.org/concerns/porcine.pdf |format=PDF |title= (Form letter EDB.7/3 P6/61/3) |publisher= World Health Organization, Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean |date=2001-07-17 |author=Gezairy HA |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref>

Opposition by Muslim fundamentalists is a major factor in the failure of polio immunization programs. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the [[Taliban]] have issued ''[[fatwa]]s'' opposing vaccination as an attempt to avert Allah's will, and as an American plot to sterilize Muslims. The Taliban have kidnapped, beaten, and assassinated vaccination officials, including assassinating the head of Pakistan's vaccination campaign in [[Bajaur Agency]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Warraich HJ |title=Religious opposition to polio vaccination |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=15 |issue=6 |doi=10.3201/eid1506.090087 |url=http://cdc.gov/eid/content/15/6/978a.htm |year=2009 |pages=978–978 |pmid=19523311 |pmc=2727330}}</ref>

In the early 2000s Islamic religious leaders in northern [[Nigeria]] advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine. The boycott caused cases of polio to arise not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries.  The followers were also wary of other vaccinations, and Nigeria reported over 20,000 measles cases and nearly 600 deaths from measles from January through March 2005.<ref name=Clements>{{cite journal |journal= Curr Drug Saf |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=117–119 |title= How vaccine safety can become political – the example of polio in Nigeria |author= Clements CJ, Greenough P, Shull D |url=http://bentham.org/cds/samples/cds1-1/Clements.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-28 |doi=10.2174/157488606775252575 |pmid=18690921}}</ref> In 2006 Nigeria accounted for over half of all new polio cases worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title= Wild poliovirus 2000–2008 |date=2008-02-05 |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf |format=PDF |publisher= Global Polio Eradication Initiative |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927204139/http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> Outbreaks continued thereafter; for example, at least 200 children died in a late-2007 measles outbreak in [[Borno State]].<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Hundreds' dead in measles outbreak |publisher=IRIN |date=2007-12-14 |url=http://irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75883 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref>

The cell culture media of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the [[rubella]] vaccine, are derived from tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the [[principle of double effect]], originated by [[Thomas Aquinas]], holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/assets/files/pdfs/Moral_Considerations_With_Certain_Viral_Vaccines.pdf |format=PDF |title= Moral considerations with certain viral vaccines |author= Grabenstein JD |journal= Christ Pharm |issn=1094-9534 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=3–6 |year=1999 |accessdate=2009-05-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have "...a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems."<ref name=Vatican>{{cite journal |author= Pontifical Academy for Life |title= Moral reflections on vaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human foetuses |year=2005 |journal= Medicina e Morale |publisher=Center for Bioethics, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart |url=http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&pag=testo/vacc/vacc&lang=english |accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref> The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for [[Catholic]]s to use the existing vaccine, writing, "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible."<ref name=Vatican/>

Some conservative U.S. Christian groups oppose mandatory vaccination for diseases typically spread via sexual contact, arguing that the possibility of disease deters risky sexual contact. For example, the [[Family Research Council]] opposes mandatory use of [[HPV vaccine|vaccines against the human papillomavirus]], writing, "Our primary concern is with the message that would be delivered to nine- to 12-year-olds with the administration of the vaccines. Care must be taken not to communicate that such an intervention makes all sex 'safe'."<ref>{{cite news |author= Danny Fortson |title= Moral majority take on GSK and Merck over cancer drugs |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/moral-majority-take-on-gsk-and-merck-over-cancer-drugs-481844.html |accessdate=2006-11-02 |date=2006-06-11 |work= The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/14/AR2006071401532.html |title= Pro-family, pro-vaccine—but keep it voluntary |author= Sprigg P |work= Washington Post |date=2006-07-15 |accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>

== Exemptions ==

In the U.S., all but two states allow parents to opt out of their children's otherwise-mandatory vaccinations for religious reasons. The number of religious exemptions rose greatly in the late 1990s and early 2000s; for example, in [[Massachusetts]], the rate of those seeking exemptions rose from 0.24% in 1996 to 0.60% in 2006. Some parents are falsely claiming religious beliefs in order to get exemptions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-17-19819928_x.htm |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |author= LeBlanc S |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |title= Parents use religion to avoid vaccines |work= USA Today}}</ref> The [[American Medical Association]] opposes such exemptions, on the grounds that they endanger health not only for the unvaccinated individual but also for neighbors and the community at large.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/polfind/Hlth-Ethics.pdf |author= American Medical Association |title= Health and Ethics Policies of the AMA House of Delegates |quote= H-440.970 Religious Exemptions from Immunizations |format=PDF |pages=460–461 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref>
