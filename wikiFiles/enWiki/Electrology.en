'''Electrology''' is the practice of electrical [[epilation]] to permanently remove human [[hair]]. The actual process of removing the hair is referred to as electrolysis.

==Overview==
The practitioner slides a solid hair-thin metal probe into each [[hair follicle]]. Proper insertion does not puncture the skin. [[Electricity]] is delivered to the follicle through the probe, which causes localized damage to the areas that generate hairs, either through the formation of caustic [[Sodium hydroxide|lye]] (galvanic method), [[Electrocoagulation|overheating]] (thermolysis method), or both (blend method).

==Modalities==
Three methods or "modalities" are used in electrology. ''Galvanic'', ''thermolysis'', and ''blend'' all have their own merits, and one method is not better than another. The success depends on the skill of the electrologist, the type of hair being removed, the condition of the skin and the pain threshold of the client. All three methods, when properly performed, can be thorough at destroying the hair matrix cells, and leaving follicles incapable of regrowing hair.

===Galvanic===
This modality is named after [[Luigi Galvani]] and uses a person's body as an [[electrolytic cell]]. Galvanic electrolysis was first reported in the medical literature by [[ophthalmologist]] [[Charles Michel (American ophthalmologist)|Charles Michel]] in 1875 to remove ingrown eyelashes in patients with [[trichiasis]].<ref name="michel">Michel CE. Trichiasis and distichiasis; with an improved method for radical treatment. ''St. Louis Clinical Record'', 1875 Oct; 2:145-148</ref> A galvanic epilator is essentially a positive ground power supply that delivers 0-3 [[ampere|milliamperes]] through the body. The follicular probe is the [[cathode]] of an electrolytic cell. [[Sodium hydroxide]] formed at the cathode by the process of chemical [[electrolysis]] kills the hair matrix cells. Modern galvanic epilators automatically adjust the voltage to maintain constant current.

===Thermolysis===
Another method is known as '''thermolysis''', [[radio frequency|RF]], shortwave or [[diathermy]]. 
Thermolysis was developed in the 1920s and first reported in medical literature by [[Henri Bordier]].<ref name="bordier">Bordier H. Noveau traitment de l'hypertrichose par la diathermie. Vie Med., 1924, 5:561</ref> A thermolytic epilator is essentially a radio transmitter, usually with an output of about 0-8 [[watt]]s at a [[frequency]] of 13.56 [[megahertz|MHz]]. RF energy emanates from the probe tip to tissue within about a millimeter. Thermolysis works by heating the hair matrix cells to about 48°C (118°F), causing [[electrocoagulation]].

===Blend===
Galvanic and thermolysis are often combined in a method known as '''blend''', developed by [[Arthur Hinkel]] in 1948, which uses both RF and direct current, combining many of the advantages of galvanic and thermolysis.<ref name="hinkel">Hinkel AR, Lind RW (1968).

==Technique==
The practitioner selects a metal probe that slides easily into the [[hair follicle]], usually the same diameter as the hair shaft or smaller. This is typically 50 to 150&nbsp;µm (0.002 to 0.006&nbsp;inches) for all three modalities.  Care is given to insert the probe at the same angle as the hair is growing out of the skin.  The probe is inserted to the depth of the dermal [[wiktionary:Papilla|papilla]] or hair matrix, which is the site of formation of hair from highly [[mitosis|mitotic]] and [[keratin]]ized [[cell (biology)|cells]].  The power and duration of the electricity are started at the lowest setting, then titrated up until the hair comes out as easily as possible. If the patient experiences significant discomfort, the settings can be lowered.  

==Treatment duration==
Most practitioners will advise that complete removal of male pattern facial hair takes between 1 and 4 years, with an average treatment length of 2 years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Status of profession==

In the United States, electrolysis is regulated in many states, requiring training and licensing. 

Electrolysis as a profession faced new competition in the 1990s after [[laser hair removal]] was developed and promoted as a quicker and easier way to remove hair. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] declared laser and similar devices can only claim to reduce hair growth, not permanently remove it.<ref name="fda-laser">U.S. Food and Drug Administration (04/26/2011). [http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ResourcesforYouRadiationEmittingProducts/ucm252761.htm Laser Facts.]</ref>

In the state of Connecticut the professionals govern a board called the [http://www.electrologyct.com/ Connecticut State Electrolysis Association].
