'''Myocarditis''' or '''inflammatory [[cardiomyopathy]]''' is [[inflammation]] of heart muscle ([[myocardium]]).

Myocarditis is most often due to [[infection]] by common [[virus]]es, such as [[parvovirus B19]], less commonly nonviral pathogens such as ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'' (Lyme disease) or ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', or as a hypersensitivity response to drugs.<ref name=Cooper>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/15/1526 Leslie T. Cooper, Jr.,] (April 9, 2009) Myocarditis, N. Engl. J. Med. 360(15):1526-38</ref>

The definition of myocarditis varies, but the central feature is an infection of the heart, with an inflammatory infiltrate, and damage to the heart muscle, ''without'' the blockage of coronary arteries that define a heart attack ([[myocardial infarction]]) or other common noninfectious causes.<ref name=Baughman>Kenneth L. Baughman, Special Report: Diagnosis of Myocarditis; Death of Dallas Criteria. [http://www.circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/113/4/593 Circulation. 2006;113:593-595] [[Free full text]]</ref> Myocarditis may or may not include death ([[necrosis]]) of heart tissue. It may include [[dilated cardiomyopathy]].<ref name=Cooper/>

Myocarditis is often an autoimmune reaction. [[M protein (Streptococcus)|Streptococcal M protein]] and [[coxsackievirus]] B have regions ([[epitope]]s) that are immunologically similar to cardiac [[myosin]]. During and after the viral infection, the immune system may attack cardiac myosin.<ref name=Cooper/>

Because a definitive diagnosis requires a heart biopsy, which doctors are reluctant to do because they are invasive, statistics on the incidence of myocarditis vary widely.<ref name=Cooper/>

The consequences of myocarditis thus also vary widely. It can cause a mild disease without any symptoms that resolves itself, or it may cause chest pain, [[heart failure]], or sudden death. An acute myocardial infarction-like syndrome with normal coronary arteries has a good prognosis. Heart failure, even with dilated [[left ventricle]], may have a good prognosis. Ventricular arrhythmias and high-degree heart block have a poor prognosis. Loss of right ventricular function is a strong predictor of death.<ref name=Cooper/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms associated with myocarditis are varied, and relate either to the actual inflammation of the myocardium, or the weakness of the heart muscle that is secondary to the inflammation.  Signs and symptoms of myocarditis include:<ref name=Feldman>{{cite journal |author=Feldman AM, McNamara D |title=Myocarditis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=343 |issue=19 |pages=1388–98 |year=2000 |month=November |pmid=11070105 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200011093431908}}</ref>
* [[Chest pain]] (often described as "stabbing" in character)
* [[Congestive heart failure]] (leading to [[edema]], [[breathlessness]] and [[Liver|hepatic]] congestion)
* [[Palpitation]]s (due to [[arrhythmia]]s)
* Sudden death (in young adults, myocarditis causes up to 20% of all cases of sudden death)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eckart RE, Scoville SL, Campbell CL, ''et al.'' |title=Sudden death in young adults: a 25-year review of autopsies in military recruits |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=141 |issue=11 |pages=829–34 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15583223 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/141/11/829}}</ref>
* Fever (especially when infectious, e.g. in [[rheumatic fever]])
* Symptoms in infants and toddlers tend to be more nonspecific, with generalized malaise, poor appetite, abdominal pain, and/or chronic cough. Later stages of the illness will present with respiratory symptoms with increased work of breathing, and is often mistaken for asthma.

Since myocarditis is often due to a viral illness, many patients give a history of symptoms consistent with a recent viral infection, including fever, rash, diarrhea, joint pains, and easy fatigueability.

Myocarditis is often associated with [[pericarditis]], and many patients present with signs and symptoms that suggest concurrent myocarditis and pericarditis.

== Causes ==
A large number of causes of myocarditis have been identified, but often a cause cannot be found.  In Europe and North America, viruses are common culprits.  Worldwide, however, the most common cause is [[Chagas' disease]], an illness endemic to Central and South America that is due to infection by the protozoan ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''.<ref name=Feldman/>

=== Infections ===
* [[Virus|Viral]] ([[Adenovirus]](Most common cause), [[parvovirus B19]], [[coxsackie virus]], [[HIV]], [[enterovirus]], [[rubella virus]], [[polio virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[human herpesvirus 6]] and possibly  [[hepatitis C]])
* [[Protozoan]] (''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' causing ''[[Chagas disease]]'' and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'')
* [[Bacteria]]l ([[brucellosis|''Brucella'']], ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'', [[gonococcus]], ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Actinomyces]]'', ''[[Whipple's disease|Tropheryma whipplei]]'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', [[leptospirosis]], and [[Rickettsia]])
* [[Fungus|Fungal]] (''[[Aspergillus]]'')
* [[Parasite|Parasitic]] ([[ascaris]], ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'', ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'', [[schistosoma]], ''[[Taenia solium]]'', ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'', [[visceral larva migrans]], and ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'')

Bacterial myocarditis is rare in patients without [[immunodeficiency]].

=== Toxins ===
* [[Medication|Drugs]] ([[ethanol]], [[anthracycline]]s and some other forms of [[chemotherapy]], and [[antipsychotic]]s, e.g. [[clozapine]], also some [[designer drug]]s such as [[mephedrone]])<ref name="pmid21062771">{{cite journal |author=Nicholson PJ, Quinn MJ, Dodd JD |title=Headshop heartache: acute mephedrone 'meow' myocarditis |journal=Heart (British Cardiac Society) |volume=96 |issue=24 |pages=2051–2 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21062771 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2010.209338 |url=}}</ref>

=== Immunologic ===
* [[Allergy|Allergic]] ([[acetazolamide]], [[amitriptyline]])
* Rejection after a [[heart transplant]]
* [[Autoimmune disorder|Autoantigens]] ([[scleroderma]], [[systemic lupus erythematosis]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[vasculitis|systemic vasculitis]] such as [[Churg-Strauss syndrome]], and [[Wegener's granulomatosis]])
* [[Toxin]]s ([[arsenic]], [[toxic shock syndrome toxin]], [[carbon monoxide]], or [[snake venom]])
* [[Heavy metals]] ([[copper]] or [[iron]])

=== Physical agents ===
* [[Electric shock]], [[fever|hyperpyrexia]], and [[radiation]]

== Diagnosis ==

Myocarditis refers to an underlying process that causes inflammation and injury of the heart.  It does not refer to inflammation of the heart as a consequence of some other insult.  Many secondary causes, such as a heart attack, can lead to inflammation of the myocardium  and therefore the diagnosis of myocarditis cannot be made by evidence of inflammation of the myocardium alone.<ref name=Robbins>Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 414-416 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1</ref>

Myocardial inflammation can be suspected on the basis of [[electrocardiogram|electrocardiographic]] (ECG) results, elevated [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) and/or [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR) and increased [[IgM]] ([[serology]]) against viruses known to affect the [[myocardium]]. Markers of myocardial damage ([[troponin]] or [[creatine kinase]] cardiac isoenzymes) are elevated.<ref name=Feldman/>

The ECG findings most commonly seen in myocarditis are diffuse [[T wave]] inversions; saddle-shaped ST-segment elevations may be present (these are also seen in pericarditis).<ref name=Feldman/>

The [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] is still [[biopsy]] of the myocardium, generally done in the setting of [[angiography]]. A small tissue sample of the [[endocardium]] and [[myocardium]] is taken, and investigated by a [[pathological anatomy|pathologist]] by [[light microscopy]] and&mdash;if necessary&mdash;[[immunochemistry]] and special staining methods. Histopathological features are myocardial interstitium with abundant edema and inflammatory infiltrate, rich in [[lymphocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s. Focal destruction of myocytes explains the myocardial pump failure.<ref name=Feldman/>

Cardiac [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (cMRI or CMR) has been shown to be very useful in diagnosing myocarditis by visualizing markers for [[inflammation]] of the [[myocardium]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Skouri HN, Dec GW, Friedrich MG, Cooper LT |title=Noninvasive imaging in myocarditis |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=48 |issue=10 |pages=2085–93 |year=2006 |pmid=17112998 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2006.08.017}}</ref>
Recently, consensus criteria for the diagnosis of myocarditis by CMR have been published <ref>{{cite journal |author=Friedrich MG, Sechtem U, Schulz-Menger J, Holmvang G, Alakija P, Cooper LT, White JA, Abdel-Aty H, Gutberlet M, Prasad S, Aletras AH, Laissy JP, Paterson I, Filipchuk NG, Kumar A, Pauschinger M, Liu P |title=Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Myocarditis: A JACC White Paper |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=53 |issue=17 |pages=1475–87 |year=2009 |pmid=7351097 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2009.02.007 |pmc=2743893}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
As most viral infections cannot be treated with directed therapy, symptomatic treatment is the only form of therapy for those forms of myocarditis.<ref name="Hia 580–4">{{cite journal|last=Hia|first=CP|coauthors=Yip, WC, Tai, BC, Quek, SC|title=Immunosuppressive therapy in acute myocarditis: an 18 year systematic review|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|date=2004 Jun|volume=89|issue=6|pages=580–4|pmid=15155409|doi=10.1136/adc.2003.034686|pmc=1719952}}</ref>
In the acute phase, supportive therapy, including bed rest, is indicated. For symptomatic patients, [[digoxin]] and [[diuretic]]s provide clinical improvement. For patients with moderate to severe dysfunction, cardiac function can be supported by use of [[inotrope]]s such as Milrinone in the acute phase, followed by oral therapy with [[ACE inhibitor]]s (Captopril, Lisinopril) when tolerated.  People who do not respond to conventional therapy are candidates for bridge therapy with [[ventricular assist device|left ventricular assist device]]s. [[Heart transplantation]] is reserved for patients who fail to improve with conventional therapy.<ref name="Aziz 509–15">{{cite journal|last=Aziz|first=KU|coauthors=Patel, N, Sadullah, T, Tasneem, H, Thawerani, H, Talpur, S|title=Acute viral myocarditis: role of immunosuppression: a prospective randomised study|journal=Cardiology in the young|date=2010 Oct|volume=20|issue=5|pages=509–15|pmid=20584348|doi=10.1017/S1047951110000594}}</ref>

In several small case series and randomized control trials, systemic corticosteroids have shown to have beneficial effects in patients with proven myocarditis.<ref name="Aziz 509–15"/> However, data on the usefulness of corticosteroids should be interpreted with caution, since 58% of adults recover spontaneously, while most studies on children and infants lack control groups.<ref name="Hia 580–4"/>

== Epidemiology ==
The exact incidence of myocarditis is unknown. However, in series of routine [[autopsy|autopsies]], 1&ndash;9% of all patients had evidence of myocardial inflammation. In young adults, up to 20% of all cases of sudden death are due to myocarditis.<ref name=Feldman/>

Among patients with HIV, myocarditis is the most common cardiac pathological finding at [[autopsy]], with a prevalence of 50% or more.<ref name=Cooper>{{cite journal |author=Cooper LT |title=Myocarditis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=360 |issue=15 |pages=1526–35 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19357408|doi=  10.1056/NEJMra0800028|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/15/1526}}</ref>
