'''Barefoot''' (also '''barefooted''') is the state of not wearing any [[footwear]]. While for functional, fashion, and social reasons footwear is generally worn, the wearing of footwear volitionally is exclusively a human characteristic and is a feature of many human societies, especially outdoors and not in an exclusively private context. Many people do not wear footwear in their home, and some expect visitors to do the same. 

Many people regard the wearing of footwear as a sign of civilization and being barefoot as a sign of poverty. However, even when poverty is not relevant, some still choose to be barefoot, at least in some situations.

There are health risks and benefits associated with going barefoot. Footwear provides protection from cuts, abrasions, and bruises, from objects on the ground, as well as protection from [[frostbite]] and parasites like [[hookworm]]. However, some shoes can limit the flexibility and mobility of the foot and can lead to higher incidences of flat feet or toes that curve inwards. Walking barefoot also results in a more natural gait, allowing for a more rocking motion of the foot and eliminating the hard heel strike and generating less collision force in the foot and lower leg.

Many stores, restaurants, and other public venues in the United States have [[dress code]]s against bare feet. While private business owners are free to set their own policies, many also cite nonexistent health regulations, though these typically are requirements that pertain to employees, not customers. Many people also believe that it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle barefoot, though there are no laws in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and other places against it.

There are many sports that people play barefoot, including [[barefoot running|running]], [[barefoot skiing|water skiing]], [[beach volleyball]], [[gymnastics]], and [[martial arts]]. In modern language, someone who prefers not to wear shoes in public is known as a '''barefooter'''. The term may also be used to describe someone participating in certain sports, such as barefoot skiing or barefoot running.<ref>{{cite book|title=Barefoot water skiing: an illustrated guide to learning and mastering the sport|year=1988|publisher=World Publications, Incorporated|pages=161|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6I2WE5XWIQ8C&q=barefooter&dq=barefooter|author=Scarpa, R; Dorner, T.|isbn=978-0-944406-01-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wallack|first=R.M.|title=Run for Life: The Anti-Aging, Anti-Injury, Super-Fitness Plan to Keep You Running to 100|year=2009|publisher=[http://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/ Sky Horse Publishing]|isbn=978-1-60239-344-8|pages=34|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pkjcENkpO6cC&pg=PA34&dq=barefooter#v=onepage&q=barefooter&f=false}}</ref>

Many people in ancient times, such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Hindu]]s and [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], saw little need for footwear and, most of the time, preferred being barefoot. The Egyptians and Hindus made some use of ornamental footwear, such as a soleless [[sandal]] known as a "Cleopatra", which did not provide any practical protection for the foot. The ancient Greeks largely viewed footwear as self-indulgent, unaesthetic and unnecessary. Shoes were primarily worn in the theater as a means of increasing stature, and many preferred to go barefoot.<ref name="Frazine_Richard">{{cite book|last=Frazine|first=Richard Keith|title=The Barefoot Hiker|year=1993|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=0-89815-525-8|pages=98|url=http://books.google.com/?id=edsITVCd2G0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=barefoot+hiker&q}}</ref> Athletes in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] participated barefoot – and naked.<ref name="ancient_olympics">{{cite news|title=Unearthing the First Olympics|url=http://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2004/jul/nemea/|accessdate=July 1, 2010|newspaper=[[NPR]]|date=July 19, 2004| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100728000414/http://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2004/jul/nemea/| archivedate= 28 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Even the [[Twelve Olympians|gods]] and heroes were primarily depicted barefoot, the [[hoplite]] warriors fought battles in bare feet, and [[Alexander the Great]] conquered his vast empire with barefoot armies.

[[Clothing in ancient Rome|Roman clothing]] was seen as a sign of power, and footwear was seen as a necessity of living in a civilized world, although the slaves and paupers usually went barefoot.<ref name="Frazine_Richard"/> There are many references to shoes being worn in the [[Bible]].

During the 16th century, royalty started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life, such as [[Catherine de Medici]] or [[Mary I of England]].

===Religious aspects===
In many religions, bare feet are often seen as a sign of humility and respect, and some religious practitioners may have taken a vow of poverty. The art of many cultures throughout the world shows a person without shoes symbolizing poverty.<ref name="DeMello_Margo"/> In [[Thailand]], Master Jinshen, a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, walks {{convert|20|km|mi|sp=us}} per day barefoot as a reminder to others who pursue a material life to protect and be concerned for [[Mother Nature]].

In many religions, it is common to remove shoes when entering a place considered holy. For example, in the [[Book of Exodus]], [[Moses]] was instructed to remove his shoes before approaching the burning bush:

{{cquote|Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest [is] holy ground ({{bible|Exodus 3:5|KJV}}).}}

Everyone entering a [[mosque]] or a [[Hindu temple]], including visitors, is expected to remove his or her shoes; racks for the storage of shoes are usually provided at the entrance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goseasia.about.com/od/travelplanning/a/mosque-dos-and-donts.htm|title=Mosque etiquette|work=Southeast Asia travel|publisher=about.com|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/pujaonline/puja/temples.html|title=Worship in Hindu temples|publisher=pujaonline|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref>

[[Foot washing]], or the ceremonial washing of others' feet, is associated with humility in Christianity, and Jesus Christ is recorded in the [[New Testament]] as washing the feet of his disciples as a way to serve them during the [[Last Supper]]. Christians that practice foot washing today do so as a way to bring them closer to Jesus and to fill them with a sense of humility and service. Muslims also wash their feet before entering a [[mosque]] or other place of worship, as well as before prayers. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] also show their respect and humility for the [[Pope]] by kissing his feet, in a similar manner in which Hindus show their love and respect to a [[guru]] by touching his bare feet (also called [[pranam]]). It is also customary to show one's respect by walking barefoot around [[Raj Ghat]], the monument to [[Mahatma Gandhi]].<ref name="DeMello_Margo"/> Both United States President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] paid him this honor.<ref name="Barefoot_Bush">{{cite news|title=Barefoot Bush pays tribute to Mahatma|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Barefoot-Bush-pays-tribute-to-Mahatma/articleshow/1436126.cms|accessdate=June 29, 2010|newspaper=The Times of India|date=March 3, 2006}}</ref> During the [[Imperial Japan]]ese period, removing one's shoes in the presence of a person of higher status was a sign of showing one's own humility and respect towards their status.<ref name="DeMello_Margo"/>

Christian congregations of men and women that go entirely barefoot or wear sandals include the [[Discalced]], like the [[Discalced Carmelites]] (1568), the [[Congregation of the Feuillants|Feuillant]]s ([[Cistercians]], 1575), the [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]]s (1594), the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarian]]s (1604), and the [[Passionist]]s.<ref>{{catholic}}</ref>

=== Cultural aspects ===
[[File:Shoeless_Sam_Sugarman_in_Hartford,_CT_circa_1950.jpg|thumb|left|Shoeless Sam Sugarman in Hartford, Connecticut, circa 1950]]
Incidences and attitudes towards barefoot walking vary between countries and cultures. In the early 1900s, Russian immigrant Samuel Sugarman, a.k.a. "Barefoot Sam" or "Shoeless Sam", became famous in Hartford, Connecticut, for going barefoot all year long, even in snow and ice, until his death in 1954 at age 80.  Samuel Sugarman was the son of noted health advocate Prof. Louis Sugarman of [[Little Falls, New York]], who became famous for walking barefoot in the snow and bathing in the icy Mohawk River in the middle of winter.  According to a February 22, 1950, interview in the ''Hartford Courant'' ("Of Many Things" by Thomas Murphy), Shoeless Sam felt walking barefoot was better for the feet and claimed it was as natural for him to go without shoes as it was for others to wear shoes. Despite this, he was seen as an eccentric (see also photo link at footnote).<ref name="Faude_Wilson">{{cite book|last=Faude|first=Wilson H.|title=Images of America: Hartford.

In Australia and some parts of the United States, where taboos against barefoot walking are strongest, it is not unusual for people to wear the same shoes indoors and outdoors, and for guests to keep their shoes on when visiting other people's houses. In contrast, in many cultures such a behavior is considered inappropriate, if not rude or indeed unacceptable. It may be acceptable to wear outdoor shoes in public places (e.g., museums or libraries), but people are usually expected to go barefoot, or wear socks or slippers, inside dwellings. In some countries, such as Japan<ref name="TJF">{{cite web|title=Japanese Culture and Daily Life: Removing Shoes.|url=http://www.tjf.or.jp/eng/content/japaneseculture/02kutsu.htm|publisher=[http://www.tjf.or.jp/ TJF]|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref> and India,<ref name="remarkable-india">{{cite web|title=How To Travel In India.|url=http://www.remarkableindia.com/step_10_how_to_travel_in_india.php|publisher=[http://www.remarkableindia.com/ RemarkableIndia.com]|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref> the host is expected to provide light [[slippers]] for all visitors. Amongst other things, this practice serves the purpose of minimizing the amount of dirt and mud brought in from the outside.

In many branches of Romani culture across the world, it is traditional for women to dance barefoot.

===Firewalking===
[[Firewalking]] is the practice of walking barefoot over hot coals. It has been practiced by many people and cultures in all parts of the world, with the earliest known reference dating back to [[Iron Age India]] – c. 1200 BC.<ref name="Willey_David">{{cite web|last=Willey|first=David|title=Firewalking Myth vs Physics|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dwilley/Fire/FireTxt/fire.html|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|accessdate=June 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100606040454/http://www.pitt.edu/~dwilley/Fire/FireTxt/fire.html| archivedate= 6 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is often used as a [[rite of passage]], as a test of an individual's strength and courage, or, in religion, as a test of one's faith. Today, it is often used in corporate and team-building seminars and self-help workshops as a confidence-building exercise. Firewalking implies the belief that the feat requires the aid of a supernatural force, strong faith, or on an individual's ability to focus on "mind over matter".<ref name="DeMello_Margo"/> Modern physics has largely debunked this however, showing that the amount of time the foot is in contact with the ground is not enough to induce a burn, combined with the fact that [[coal]] is not a very good conductor of heat.<ref name="Willey_David"/>

=== Slavery and imprisonment ===
It was an integral part of most slave laws ("slave codes") to mandate that slaves have to go barefoot as a matter of course. For example, the [[Cape Town]] slave code states that, "Slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes."<ref name="WCG">{{cite web|title=Cape Town and Surrounds.|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/public_info/P/82884/3/|publisher=[http://www.westerncape.gov.za/ Western Cape Government]|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> This was also seen in states that abolished slavery later in history, such as [[Brazil]], as most images from the slavery period suggest that slaves were barefoot.<ref name="slavery_brazil">{{cite web|title=Slavery in Brazil.|url=http://histclo.com/act/work/slave/am/cou/bra/sab-sla.html|publisher=[http://histclo.com/ Historical Boys' Clothing]|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> In [[Zimbabwe]], prisoners must be barefoot as well.<ref name="zimbabwe_prisoners">{{cite news|title=Long hours in a Harare jail.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2018917.stm|accessdate=July 18, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=June 1, 2002}}</ref> Shoes have been considered as badges of freedom since biblical times:

{{cquote|But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put [it] on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on [his] feet ({{bible|Luke 15:22|KJV}}).}}

==Arts and entertainment==
Many singers and dancers perform on stage barefoot. The classical dance of [[Cambodia]] had its roots in the holy dances of the legendary seductresses (''[[apsaras]]'') of ancient Cambodia and attained its high point during the [[Angkor]] period in its interpretations of the Indian epics, especially the ''[[Ramayana]]''. Cambodian dancers were well-born women of the king's harem and danced barefoot, with the feet turned outwards and the legs slightly bent at the knee to cushion the movements of the upper body. The unimpeded movement of the foot was essential to the art. When the land was invaded by the Thai, the dancers were taken to the Thai court, where their art was adapted and continued to flourish.<ref name="Cambodian_Handbook">{{cite book |author=Colet, John, with Joshua Eliot and Abigail Vertigan |year=2002 |title=Cambodian Handbook |publisher=Footprint |isbn=1-903471-40-0 |pages=218 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=3nVUxKL29ZwC&pg=PA218&dq=cambodia+dance+bare+foot+feet&q}}</ref><ref name="Cambodia">{{cite book |author=Brown, Ian |year=2000 |title=Cambodia |publisher=Oxfam GB |isbn=0-85598-430-9 |pages=71 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=bK11j2IdbC0C&pg=PA71&dq=cambodia+dance+bare+foot+feet&q}}</ref>

The barefoot dance movement of the early 20th century challenged the received laws of classical dance and the broader laws of social decorum. For decades, the bare foot had been perceived as obscene, and no matter how determined barefoot dancers were to validate their art with reference to spiritual, artistic, historic, and organic concepts, barefoot dancing was inextricably linked in the public mind with indecency and sexual taboo. In 1908, [[Maud Allan]] shocked and fascinated London theatre-goers with her barefoot dance of desire in ''Salome'', and scandalous tributes positioned her as the embodiment of lust. For many, barefoot dancing represented not only the freedom and horror of modern sexuality but the progress and decline of high culture.<ref name="Benstock">{{cite book |editors=Benstock, Shari, and Suzanne Ferriss |year=2001 |title=Footnotes: On Shoes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=0-8135-2870-4 |pages=276–8 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=tUK8BP7OOJQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Footnotes:+On+Shoes&q}}</ref>

[[File:Isadora duncan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Isadora Duncan]] performing barefoot during her 1915–18 American tour]]

[[California]]n [[Isadora Duncan]] revolutionized dance in the Western world by jettisoning the [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] and the [[pointe shoe]] of classical [[ballet]] and scandalized audiences by performing works of her own choreography in flowing draperies and bare feet.

She believed her utopian dance vision and program would ameliorate the perceived ills of modern life and restore the world to the imagined perfection of Ancient Greece.<ref name="Benstock" />

The 1954 film ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'' tells the fictional story of Maria Vargas (portrayed by [[Ava Gardner]]), a Spanish [[cabaret]] dancer of simple origins who frequently went barefoot. She was cast in a movie by writer and director Harry Dawes (portrayed by [[Humphrey Bogart]]) and became a major star. In 1978, [[Ina Garten]] purchased a specialty food store in [[The Hamptons]] named ''[[Barefoot Contessa]]'', after the movie. She liked the name because it went well with her simple and elegant cooking style. She sold the store in 1999 and wrote her first book, ''The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook'', which became one of the best-selling cookbooks of the year. She would go on to write more cookbooks and, in 2002, started production of a television show on the [[Food Network]], also named the ''Barefoot Contessa'', which continues to run.<ref name="Ina_Garten">{{cite web|title=Ina Garten (biography)|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/ina-garten/index.html|publisher=[[Food Network]]|accessdate=July 10, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100630134851/http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/ina-garten/index.html| archivedate= 30 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

There are risks and benefits associated with going barefoot. While footwear provides some protection from puncture wounds from glass, nails, rocks, or thorns as well as abrasions, bruises, and [[frostbite]], studies of people who habitually walk barefoot have consistently found that these problems are minimal, with only about 0.89% of barefoot people having any kind of foot complaint which could be linked to walking barefoot (including temporary conditions such as abrasions) or having the tops of the feet uncovered. Feet that have never worn shoes never exhibit problems such as bunions, corns, and '[[Flat feet|fallen arches]]', as well as having a much reduced incidence of problems such as callouses.<ref name="Zipfel_B">{{cite journal|last=Zipfel|first=B.|coauthors=L.R.

Walking barefoot results in a more natural gait.

Since there is no artificial protection of the bare foot, some of the possible issues include cuts, abrasions, bruises, or puncture wounds from glass, nails, rocks, or thorns, as well as poisonous plants, animals, or [[parasite]]s can enter the body through the cuts on an injured bare foot.<ref name="review">{{cite journal |author=Staheli LT |title=Shoes for children: a review |journal=Pediatrics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=371–5 |year=1991 |pmid=1861942 |doi= |ref=harv}}</ref> In people who are not habitually barefoot, [[Athlete's foot]] is spread by fungal spores coming into contact with skin that has been weakened and made moist. The fungus is known to only affect around 0.75% of habitually barefoot people and can be prevented by reducing shoe use and keeping the feet dry, particularly after walking through a damp environments where people communally walk barefoot as the fungus only develops under the right conditions, such as when people fail to properly dry their feet after swimming or showering and then put on shoes.<ref name="athletes_foot">{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=Patricia|title=Athlete's Foot|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/health_problems/skin/athletes_foot.html|publisher=[http://www.kidshealth.org/ www.kidshealth.org]|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> As such, the fungus is very unlikely to develop on a person who goes barefoot all the time.

The [[Hookworm]] parasite, found only in warm, moist, climates where human [[feces]] contaminated with Hookworm larvae has been left in places where it might come into contact with human skin, can also burrow through a bare human foot (or any part of the body that comes into contact with it).<ref name="cdc">{{cite news|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/hookworm/factsht_hookworm.htm|title=Hookworm Infection|date=September 11, 2008|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=August 4, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/00000000000000/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/hookworm/factsht_hookworm.htm| archivedate= 11 July 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, as the parasite tends to be found mainly in mud and cesspools, its spread cannot be stopped by most standard shoes since the larvae can penetrate fabric and small holes. Also, the parasite may spread through contaminated material coming into contact with any part of the body, such as through flecks of mud splashing on an ankle or leg.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trop|first=Am J|title=Penetration by Infective Hookworm Larvae of the Materials Used in the Manufacture of Shoes|url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/s1-9/1/79.citation|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> The [[Hookworm]] parasite is relatively mild, has few symptoms, and can pass completely unnoticed when the infestation level is low enough. Since the hookworm infection is very cheap and easy to treat, and since it requires infected feces to come into contact with human skin within a particular time period, eradicating hookworm is mainly a matter of hygiene (including the building of proper toilet and waste-disposal facilities) and mass-treatment. In very cold weather, shoes can provide thermal insulation, protecting against [[frostbite]]. 

Issues that can develop as a result of someone who has always worn shoes going barefoot include calf pain or [[Achilles tendinitis]] or [[plantar fasciitis]] due to shortening of the Achilles tendon and the foot being underdeveloped, due to regular use of shoes.

A number of myths have existed from time to time about regulations requiring the wearing of footwear.

==Sports and recreation==
[[File:Barfusspark Nienhagen.jpg|thumb|right|Barefoot park in [[Nienhagen (Staufenberg)|Nienhagen]] (Germany)]]
There are several recreational activities one can participate in while barefoot. Those involved in [[water sports]] such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[water polo]] almost always participate barefoot due to the difficulty of swimming with footwear. Other common activities performed barefoot include [[hiking]], running, water skiing, [[beach volleyball]], [[surfing]], [[tubing (recreation)|tubing]], [[gymnastics]], and [[martial arts]]. [[Wrestling]] is another sport that can also be done barefoot. Although most modern [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestlers wear shoes, [[sumo wrestling]], [[Yağlı güreş]] (oil or "Turkish" wrestling), and [[mud wrestling]] are commonly done while barefoot.

The official position on barefoot running by the [[American Podiatric Medical Association]] states that there is not enough research on the immediate and long term benefits of the practice, and that individuals should consult a podiatrist with a strong background in sports medicine to make an informed decision on all aspects of their running and training programs.<ref name="APMA_statement">{{cite web|title=APMA Position Statement on Barefoot Running|url=http://www.apma.org/Media/position.cfm?ItemNumber=995|publisher=[[American Podiatric Medical Association]]|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref>

One alternative to barefoot running is to wear thin-soled shoes with minimal padding, such as [[moccasin]]s, [[plimsolls]], or [[huarache (running shoe)|huarache]]s, which result in similar gait to going barefoot, but protect the skin and keep dirt and water off.<ref name="Hersher_Rebecca">{{cite news|last=Hersher|first=Rebecca|title=Perfect Landing.|url=http://alumni.harvard.edu/stories/perfect-landing|accessdate=June 26, 2010|newspaper=[[Harvard University]]|date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> Some modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear to maintain optimum flexibility while also providing a minimum amount of protection.
