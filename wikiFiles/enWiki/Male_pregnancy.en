{{About|pregnancy in male organisms|the sympathetic condition|Couvade syndrome}}

'''Male pregnancy''' is the incubation of one or more [[embryo]]s or [[fetus]]es by [[male]] members of any species. In nearly all [[Heterogamy|heterogamous]] animal species, offspring are ordinarily carried by the [[female]] until birth, but in fish of the [[Syngnathidae]] family ([[pipefish]] and [[seahorse]]s), males perform this function.<ref name="scidirect">{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VRT-49SN5B1-5&_user=10&_handle=V-WA-A-W-WD-MsSAYWW-UUA-U-AAZAEZDBBD-AACECVYABD-ACYAVUUBU-WD-U&_fmt=full&_coverDate=10%2F14%2F2003&_rdoc=18&_orig=browse&_srch=%23toc%236243%232003%23999869979%23464936!&_cdi=6243&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=08311121da42f6825bc092a851bda224 | title=Male pregnancy | date=2003-10-14 | publisher=[[ScienceDirect]]}}</ref> By some definitions of male identity, human men have done so in certain instances, and male humans incubating fetuses are a recurring theme in speculative fiction.

{{Further2|[[Syngnathidae]]|[[Seahorse]]}}

The [[Syngnathidae]] family of fish has the unique characteristic of a highly derived form of male brood care referred to as "male pregnancy."<ref name="wilson(b)">{{cite journal| last = Wilson| first = A.

Included in Syngnathidae are [[seahorse]]s, the [[pipefish]], and the [[Phyllopteryx|weedy]] and [[leafy seadragon]]s. The males of some of these species possess a [[brood pouch (Syngnathidae)|brood pouch]] on the trunk or tail; in other species, the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are merely attached to the male's trunk or tail when the female lays them. Although biologists' definitions of pregnancy differ somewhat, all members of the family are considered by [[ichthyology|ichthyologists]] to display male pregnancy, even those without an external brood pouch.  

Fertilization may take place in the pouch or in the water before implantation, but in either case, syngnathids' male pregnancy ensures them complete confidence of paternity.<ref name="mobley">{{cite journal|last=Mobley|first=Kenyon B.|coauthors=Small, C. M. and Adam G. Jones|title=The genetics and genomics of Syngnathidae: pipefishes, seahorses and seadragons|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|year=2011|month=June|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1624–1646}}</ref> After implantation in or on the brood pouch or brood patch, the male incubates the eggs. Many species [[osmoregulation|osmoregulate]] the brood pouch fluid to maintain proper pH for the developing embryos. In at least some species, the male also provisions his offspring with nutrients such as glucose and amino acids through the highly vascularized attachment sites in or on his body.

This period of incubation can take much longer than the production of another clutch of eggs by the female, especially in temperate regions where pregnancies last longer,<ref name = "wilson">{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=A.

Interestingly, this reversal of traditional sex roles has only been found in pipefishes, whereas seahorses have largely been accepted as monogamous.<ref name = "berglund">{{cite journal|last=Berglund|first=A|coauthors=G.

Male syngnathids usually prefer females with large body size and prominent ornaments such as blue skin pigmentation or skin folds. Intriguingly, syngnathid males in some species are apparently capable of absorbing eggs or embryos while in the brood pouch.<ref name="sagebakken">{{cite journal| last = Sagebakken| first = Gry| coauthors = Ingrid Ahnesjo, Kenyon B.

==Humans==
=== Ectopic implantation ===
Biological human males do not  have the anatomy needed for natural embryonic and fetal development.<ref name=scidirect/> The theoretical issue of male [[ectopic pregnancy]] (pregnancy outside the uterine cavity) by implantation in biological males has been addressed by experts in the field of [[Reproductive endocrinology and infertility|fertility medicine]], who stress that the concept of ectopic implantation, while theoretically plausible, has never been attempted and would be difficult to justify – even for women lacking a uterus – owing to the extreme health risks to both the parent and child.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/men_shealth/3354220/Pregnant-men-hard-to-stomach.html |title=Pregnant men: hard to stomach? | author=William Leith | date=2008-04-10 | publisher=''Telegraph'' | location=London}}</ref><ref name=teresi2>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/27/magazine/how-to-get-a-man-pregnant.html | title=How To Get A Man Pregnant | author=Dick Teresi | date=1994-11-27 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref>

[[Robert Winston]], a pioneer of in-vitro fertilization, told London's ''Sunday Times'' that "male pregnancy would certainly be possible" by having an embryo implanted in a man's abdomen – with the placenta attached to an internal organ such as the bowel – and later delivered by [[Caesarean section]].<ref name="independent2">{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990222/ai_n14206683 | title=Babies borne by men 'possible'|date=1999-02-22|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071206125851/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990222/ai_n14206683|archivedate=2007-12-06}}</ref><ref name=popsci1>{{cite web | url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/futurebody/0a6d9371b1d75010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html | title=Male Pregnancy: A Dangerous Proposition | author=Meryl Rothstein | work=[[Popular Science]]| date=2005-07-31}}</ref><ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19990222/ile22048.html Men can have babies; Study still in infancy though: Expert]</ref> Ectopic implantation of the embryo along the [[abdominal wall]], and resulting [[placenta]] growth would, however, be very dangerous and potentially fatal for the host, and is therefore unlikely to be studied in humans.<ref name="independent2"/><ref name="snopes">{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/malepreg.asp | title=A Womb Of His Own | date=2008-05-09 | publisher=[[Snopes.com]]}}</ref> Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility Services, a British fertility clinic, noted that the abdomen is not designed to separate from the placenta during delivery, hence the danger of an ectopic pregnancy.  "The question is not 'Can a man do it?'" stated bioethicist Glenn McGee. "It’s ’If a man does have a successful pregnancy, can he survive it?’"<ref name=popsci1 />

Since 2000, several [[hoax]] web sites have appeared on the Internet<ref name=snopes /> purporting to describe the world's first pregnant man. While sometimes relying on legitimate scientific claims, in reality, no such experiment has ever been attested. Fertility clinician [[Cecil Jacobson]] claimed to have transplanted a fertilized egg from a female baboon to the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] in the [[abdominal cavity]] of a male [[baboon]] in the mid-1960s, which then carried the fetus for four months; however, Jacobson did not publish his claims in a scientific journal, and was subsequently convicted on several unrelated counts of fraud for ethical misconduct.<ref name=teresi2 />

===Fetus in fetu===
{{Main|Fetus in fetu}}

Fetus in fetu, though not an actual pregnancy, is an extremely rare condition in which a mass of tissue resembling a fetus forms inside the body. This is a [[Congenital abnormality|developmental abnormality]] in which a fertilized egg splits as if to form [[Twin#Identical (monozygotic) twins|identical twins]], but one half becomes enveloped by the other, and an entire living organ system with torso and limbs can develop inside the host.<ref name="Chua">{{cite journal | last =Chua | first =JHY | authorlink =  | title =Fetus-in-fetu in the pelvis |journal =Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore | volume =34 | issue = | pages =646–649 | publisher = | year =2005 | url =http://annals.edu.sg/pdf/34VolNo10200511/V34N10p646.pdf |format=PDF| doi = | id = | accessdate = | author-separator =, | author2 =Chui CH | author3 =Sai Prasad TR | display-authors =2 }}</ref> The abnormality occurs in 1 in 500,000 live births in humans.<ref>Grant P, Pearn JH Foetus-in-foetu.

The case of [[Fetus in fetu|Sanju Bhagat]], a man from [[Nagpur|Nagpur, India]], attracted attention in 1999 for the length of time (36 years) he had carried his [[parasitic twin]] inside his body, and the size of the growth. Since Bhagat had no placenta, the growth had connected directly to his blood supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i.abcnews.com/Health/Story?id=2346476&page=1|title=ABC News: A Pregnant Man?|publisher=i.abcnews.com|accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
{{Sex in SF}}
{{See also|Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction}}

Thematically, pregnancy can be similar to the issues of [[parasitism]] and [[gender]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some [[science fiction]] writers have picked up on these issues, in "cross-gender" themes &mdash; e.g., [[Octavia E. Butler]]'s ''[[Bloodchild and Other Stories]]''.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s novel ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' contains the sentence "The king was pregnant", and explores a society in which pregnancy can be experienced by anyone, since individuals are not sexually differentiated during most of their life and can become capable of inseminating or gestating at different times. [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]'s ''[[Ethan of Athos]]'' features an all-male society in which men use artificial wombs, but experience many of the [[couvade syndrome|psychological effects of pregnancy]] (anticipation, anxiety, etc.). In [[Marge Piercy]]'s feminist [[utopia]]n novel ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'', neither men nor women get pregnant, leaving that to artificial wombs, but both sexes may [[breastfeeding|lactate and nurse the infant]]; the specifically female experiences of pregnancy and nursing were opened to men in the cause of [[gender equality]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Piercy| first = Marge| authorlink = Marge Piercy| title = Woman on the Edge of Time| publisher = Fawcett| date = 1985-11-12| isbn = 0-449-21082-0 }}</ref>

The concept of male pregnancy has been the subject of popular films, generally as a comedic device. The 1978 comedy film ''[[Rabbit Test (film)|Rabbit Test]]'' stars [[Billy Crystal]] as a young man who inexplicably becomes pregnant instead of his female sex partner. The 1990 BBC television comedy drama ''Frankenstein's Baby'' features a Dr. Eva Frankenstein helping a male patient to become the world's first pregnant man.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/436040|title= Frankenstein's Baby|publisher= [[British Film Institute|BFI]]}}</ref>  The 1994 [[science fiction]] comedy/drama ''[[Junior (film)|Junior]]'' stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as a fertility researcher who experiments on himself; the screenplay was inspired by a 1985 article in ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' magazine.<ref name=teresi2 />

The concept appears frequently as a comedic gag in movie and television programs. In [[Monty Python]]'s 1979 film, ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'', there is a political satire scene in which a character demands that any man has a "right to have babies if he wants them," which is ridiculed as impossible. In the [[BBC]] science fiction comedy series ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', the main character, [[Dave Lister|Lister]], becomes pregnant after having sex with a female version of himself in an alternate universe. In an episode of ''[[Sliders]]'', the quartet "slides" into an alternate world in which babies develop during their final months in the father because a worldwide disease has kept women from being able to carry children beyond their first trimester.

The possibility of extraterrestrial life having different reproductive sexuality is the basis for many references. In the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[Unexpected (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Unexpected]]", [[Trip Tucker|a human male]] becomes pregnant with the offspring of a female of another species. In the video game ''[[The Sims 2]]'' male characters can be impregnated via cheat codes or alien abduction. In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode "[[American Dad! (season 1)|Deacon Stan, Jesus Man]]", the boy Steve becomes impregnated after giving the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the extraterrestrial Roger, then unwittingly passes it on to his girlfriend via a kiss. In the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', the extraterrestrial [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Kif Kroker|Kif]] can be impregnated by a touch. In the ''[[Syfy|SciFi Channel]]'' miniseries, ''[[Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars]]'', the extraterrestrial Rygel becomes impregnated with human John and Aeryn's baby. In the series ''[[Alien Nation (1989 TV series)|Alien Nation]]'', when Tectonese main character George Francisco and his wife Susan decide to have a third child, it is revealed that, in order to conceive, a Tectonese couple needs a third party, called a ''binnaum'', to complete impregnation, and that the male carries the baby - encased in a pod - during the final months of gestation.
