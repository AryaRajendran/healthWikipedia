In [[genetics]], a '''mutation''' is a change of the [[nucleotide sequence]] of the [[genome]] of an [[organism]], [[virus]], or [[extrachromosomal DNA|extrachromosomal genetic element]]. Mutations result from unrepaired [[DNA repair|damage to DNA]] or to RNA genomes (typically caused by radiation or chemical [[mutagens]]), from errors in the process of [[DNA replication|replication]], or from the insertion or deletion of segments of DNA by [[mobile genetic elements]].<ref name=Bertram>{{cite journal |author=Bertram J |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=Mol.

Mutation can result in several different types of change in sequences; these can either have no effect, alter the [[gene product|product of a gene]], or prevent the gene from functioning properly or completely. One study on genetic variations between different species of ''[[Drosophila]]'' suggests that if a mutation changes a [[protein]] produced by a gene, the result is likely to be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.<ref name="Sawyer2007">{{cite journal |author=Sawyer SA, Parsch J, Zhang Z, Hartl DL |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in Drosophila |journal=Proc.

Changes in chromosome number may involve even larger mutations, where segments of the DNA within chromosomes break and then rearrange. For example, in the [[Homininae]], two chromosomes  fused to produce human [[chromosome 2 (human)|chromosome 2]]; this fusion did not occur in the [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] of the other apes, and they retain these separate chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhang J, Wang X, Podlaha O |title=Testing the Chromosomal Speciation Hypothesis for Humans and Chimpanzees |doi= 10.1101/gr.1891104 |journal=Genome Res. |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=845–51 |year=2004 |pmid=15123584 |pmc=479111}}</ref> In evolution, the most important role of such chromosomal rearrangements may be to accelerate the divergence of a population into new species by making populations less likely to interbreed, and thereby preserving genetic differences between these populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ayala FJ, Coluzzi M |title=Chromosome speciation: Humans, Drosophila, and mosquitoes |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl.1/6535.full |journal=Proc.

Sequences of DNA that can move about the genome, such as [[transposon]]s, make up a major fraction of the genetic material of plants and animals, and may have been important in the evolution of genomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hurst GD, Werren JH |title=The role of selfish genetic elements in eukaryotic evolution |journal=Nat.

[[Lethal gene|Nonlethal]] mutations accumulate within the [[gene pool]] and increase the amount of genetic variation.<ref name="pmid17637733">{{cite journal |title=The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations |author=Eyre-Walker A, Keightley PD |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |pages=610–8 | date=August 2007 | volume=8 |issue=8 |url=http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Adam_Eyre-Walker/Website/Publications_files/EWNRG07.pdf |pmid=17637733 |doi=10.1038/nrg2146 }}</ref> The abundance of some genetic changes within the gene pool can be reduced by [[natural selection]], while other "more favorable" mutations may accumulate and result in adaptive changes.

For example, a butterfly may produce offspring with new mutations. The majority of these mutations will have no effect; but one might change the color of one of the butterfly's offspring, making it harder (or easier) for predators to see. If this color change is advantageous, the chance of this butterfly surviving and producing its own offspring are a little better, and over time the number of butterflies with this mutation may form a larger percentage of the population.

[[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|Neutral mutations]] are defined as mutations whose effects do not influence the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of an individual. These can accumulate over time due to [[genetic drift]]. It is believed that the overwhelming majority of mutations have no significant effect on an organism's fitness. Also, [[DNA repair]] mechanisms are able to mend most changes before they become permanent mutations, and many organisms have mechanisms for eliminating otherwise permanently mutated [[somatic cell]]s.

Beneficial mutations can improve reproductive success.

==Causes==
{{main|Mutagenesis}}
Four classes of mutations are (1) spontaneous mutations (molecular decay), (2) mutations due to error prone replication by-pass of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|naturally occurring DNA damage]] (also called error prone [[DNA repair|translesion synthesis]]), (3) errors introduced during DNA repair, and (4) induced mutations caused by [[mutagen]]s.

===Spontaneous mutation===

''Spontaneous mutations'' on the molecular level can be caused by:<ref>[http://www-personal.ksu.edu/~bethmont/mutdes.html#origins "Mutation, Mutagens, and DNA Repair", by Beth A. Montelone, Ph. D., Division of Biology, Kansas State University, 1998]</ref>

* [[Tautomerism]] – A base is changed by the repositioning of a hydrogen atom, altering the hydrogen bonding pattern of that base resulting in incorrect base pairing during replication.
* [[Depurination]] – Loss of a purine base (A or G) to form an apurinic site (AP site).
* [[Deamination]] – Hydrolysis changes a normal base to an atypical base containing a keto group in place of the original amine group. Examples include C → U and A → HX (hypoxanthine), which can be corrected by DNA repair mechanisms; and 5MeC (5-methylcytosine) → T, which is less likely to be detected as a mutation because thymine is a normal DNA base.
* [[Slipped strand mispairing]] – Denaturation of the new strand from the template during replication, followed by renaturation in a different spot ("slipping").  This can lead to insertions or deletions.

===Error prone replication by-pass===

There is increasing evidence that the majority of spontaneously arising mutations are due to error prone replication ([[translesion synthesis]]) past a DNA damage in the template strand.  As described in the article [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]], naturally occurring DNA damages arise about 10,000 to 100,000 times per day per mammalian cell.  In mice, the majority of mutations are caused by translesion synthesis.<ref>Stuart GR, Oda Y, de Boer JG, Glickman BW. (2000) Mutation frequency and specificity with age in liver, bladder and brain of lacI transgenic mice. Genetics 154(3):1291-1300. PMID 10757770</ref>  Similarly, in yeast, Kunz et al.<ref>Kunz BA, Ramachandran K, Vonarx EJ. (1998) DNA sequence analysis of spontaneous mutagenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetics 148(4):1491-1505. Review. PMID 9560369</ref> found that more than 60% of the spontaneous single base pair substitutions and deletions were caused by translesion synthesis.

=== Errors introduced during DNA repair===

Although naturally occurring double-strand breaks occur at a relatively low frequency in DNA (see [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]]) their repair often causes mutation.  [[Non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) is a major pathway for repairing double-strand breaks. NHEJ involves removal of a few nucleotides to allow somewhat inaccurate alignment of the two ends for rejoining followed by addition of nucleotides to fill in gaps.  Consequently, NHEJ often introduces mutations.<ref>Lieber MR. 2008 The mechanism of double-strand DNA break repair by the nonhomologous DNA end-joining pathway. Annu Rev Biochem. 79:181-211. Review. PMID 20192759</ref>

===Induced mutation===

''Induced mutations'' on the molecular level can be caused by:-
* Chemicals
** [[Hydroxylamine]] NH<sub>2</sub>OH
** [[Base analog]]s (e.g. [[BrdU]])
** Alkylating agents (e.g. [[ENU|''N''-ethyl-''N''-nitrosourea]]) These agents can mutate both replicating and non-replicating DNA. In contrast, a base analog can only mutate the DNA when the analog is incorporated in replicating the DNA. Each of these classes of chemical mutagens has certain effects that then lead to transitions, transversions, or deletions.
**Agents that form [[DNA adduct]]s (e.g. [[ochratoxin A]] metabolites)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pfohl-Leszkowicz A, Manderville RA |title=Ochratoxin A: An overview on toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals and humans |journal=Mol Nutr Food Res |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=61–99 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17195275 |doi=10.1002/mnfr.200600137}}</ref>
** DNA [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalating]] agents (e.g. [[ethidium bromide]])
** [[Crosslinking of DNA|DNA crosslinkers]]
** [[Oxidative stress|Oxidative damage]]
** Nitrous acid converts amine groups on A and C to diazo groups, altering their hydrogen bonding patterns which leads to incorrect base pairing during replication.
* Radiation
** [[Ultraviolet]] radiation (nonionizing radiation). Two nucleotide bases in DNA – cytosine and thymine – are most vulnerable to radiation that can change their properties. UV light can induce adjacent [[pyrimidine]] bases in a DNA strand to become covalently joined as a [[pyrimidine dimer]].  UV radiation, particularly longer-wave UVA, can also cause [[DNA oxidation|oxidative damage to DNA]].<ref name="Kozmin">{{cite journal |author=Kozmin S, Slezak G, Reynaud-Angelin A, Elie C, de Rycke Y, Boiteux S, Sage E |title=UVA radiation is highly mutagenic in cells that are unable to repair 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=102 |issue=38 |pages=13538–43 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16157879 |pmc=1224634 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0504497102 |url=http://www.pnas}}</ref> [[Mutation rate]]s also vary across species. Evolutionary biologists{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} have theorized that higher mutation rates are beneficial in some situations, because they allow organisms to evolve and therefore adapt more quickly to their environments. For example, repeated exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, and selection of resistant mutants, can result in the selection of bacteria that have a much higher mutation rate than the original population ([[mutator genotype|mutator strains]]).

===By effect on structure===
The sequence of a gene can be altered in a number of ways. Gene mutations have varying effects on health depending on where they occur and whether they alter the function of essential proteins.
Mutations in the structure of genes can be classified as:
* <u>Small-scale mutations</u>, such as those affecting a small gene in one or a few nucleotides, including:
** '''[[Point mutation]]s''', often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single [[nucleotide]] for another.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Freese, Ernst |title=THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPONTANEOUS AND BASE-ANALOGUE INDUCED MUTATIONS OF PHAGE T4 |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=622–33 |year=1959 |month=April |pmid=16590424 |pmc=222607 |doi=10.1073/pnas.45.4.622}}</ref> These changes are classified as transitions or transversions.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Freese, Ernst | title=The Specific Mutagenic Effect of Base Analogues on Phage T4 | journal=J. Mol. Biol. | year=1959 | pages=87–105 | volume=1 | doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(59)80038-3 | issue=2 }}</ref> Most common is the [[transition (genetics)|transition]] that exchanges a [[purine]] for a purine (A ↔ G) or a [[pyrimidine]] for a pyrimidine, (C ↔ T). A transition can be caused by [[nitrous acid]], base mis-pairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as [[BrdU|5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)]]. Less common is a [[transversion]], which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T ↔ A/G). An example of a transversion is [[adenine]] (A) being converted into a [[cytosine]] (C). A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). Point mutations that occur within the [[protein]] coding region of a gene may be classified into three kinds, depending upon what the erroneous [[codon]] codes for:
*** [[Silent mutation]]s: which code for the same (or a sufficiently similar) [[amino acid]].
*** [[Missense mutation]]s: which code for a different amino acid.
*** [[Nonsense mutation]]s: which code for a [[stop codon|stop]] and can truncate the [[protein]].
** '''[[insertion (genetics)|Insertions]]''' add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by [[transposable element]]s, or errors during replication of repeating elements (e.g. AT repeats{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}). Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]] of the [[mRNA]] ([[splice site mutation]]), or cause a shift in the [[reading frame]] ([[Frameshift mutation|frameshift]]), both of which can significantly alter the gene product. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the [[transposable element]].
** '''[[Genetic deletion|Deletions]]''' remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. Like insertions, these mutations can alter the [[reading frame]] of the gene. They are generally irreversible: though exactly the same sequence might theoretically be restored by an insertion, transposable elements able to revert a very short deletion (say 1–2 bases) in ''any'' location are either highly unlikely to exist or do not exist at all. Note that a deletion is not the exact opposite of an insertion: the former is quite random while the latter consists of a specific sequence inserting at locations that are not entirely random or even quite narrowly defined.
* <u>Large-scale mutations</u> in [[chromosome|chromosomal]] structure, including:
** '''Amplifications''' (or [[gene duplication]]s) leading to multiple copies of all chromosomal regions, increasing the dosage of the genes located within them.
** '''[[Genetic deletion|Deletions]]''' of large chromosomal regions, leading to loss of the genes within those regions.
** Mutations whose effect is to juxtapose previously separate pieces of DNA, potentially bringing together separate genes to form functionally distinct [[fusion gene]]s (e.g. [[bcr-abl]]). These include:
*** '''[[Chromosomal translocation]]s''': interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes.
*** '''Interstitial deletions''': an intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human [[astrocytoma]], a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the "fused in glioblastoma" (fig) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase "ros", producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).
*** '''[[Chromosomal inversion]]s''': reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment.
**'''[[Loss of heterozygosity]]''': loss of one [[allele]], either by a deletion or [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles.

===By effect on function===
* '''Loss-of-function mutations''' are the result of gene product having less or no function. When the allele has a complete loss of function ([[null allele]]) it is often called an '''[[Muller's morphs|amorphic]] mutation'''. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often [[recessive allele|recessive]]. Exceptions are when the organism is [[haploid]], or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called [[haploinsufficiency]]).
* '''Gain-of-function mutations''' change the gene product such that it gains a new and abnormal function. These mutations usually have [[dominant gene|dominant]] phenotypes. Often called a [[Muller's morphs|neomorphic]] mutation.
* '''Dominant negative mutations''' (also called '''[[Muller's morphs|antimorphic]] mutations''') have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele. These mutations usually result in an altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterized by a [[Dominant gene|dominant]] or [[incomplete dominance|semi-dominant]] phenotype. In humans, dominant negative mutations have been implicated in cancer (e.g. mutations in genes [[p53]],<ref>Goh AM, Coffill CR, Lane DP. (2011) The role of mutant p53 in human cancer.

PMID 20123124</ref>  It was once thought that [[Marfan syndrome]] is an example of a dominant negative mutation occurring in an [[autosomal dominant]] disease where the defective glycoprotein product of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) antagonizes the product of the normal allele. However, it may appear this is not that case and that Marfan's may be a result of [[Haploinsufficiency]] due to the absence of one normal allele that causes the disease not the presence of an abnormal allele (i.e. Dominant negative). {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
*'''Lethal mutations''' are mutations that lead to the death of the organisms which carry the mutations.
*A '''back mutation''' or '''reversion''' is a point mutation that restores the original sequence and hence the original phenotype.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ellis NA, Ciocci S, German J | title=Back mutation can produce phenotype reversion in Bloom syndrome somatic cells | journal=Hum Genet | year=2001 | pages=167–73 | volume=108 | issue=2 | doi=10.1007/s004390000447 |pmid=11281456 |url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00439/bibs/1108002/11080167.htm}}</ref>

===By effect on fitness===
In applied genetics it is usual to speak of mutations as either harmful or beneficial.
* A '''harmful mutation''' is a mutation that decreases the fitness of the organism.
* A '''beneficial mutation''' is a mutation that increases fitness of the organism, or which promotes traits that are desirable.

In theoretical population genetics, it is more usual to speak of such mutations as deleterious or advantageous. In the [[neutral allele theory|neutral theory of molecular evolution]], [[genetic drift]] is the basis for most variation at the molecular level.
* A '''neutral mutation''' has no harmful or beneficial effect on the organism. Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming the basis for the molecular clock.
* A '''deleterious mutation''' has a negative effect on the phenotype, and thus decreases the fitness of the organism.
* An '''advantageous mutation''' has a positive effect on the phenotype, and thus increases the fitness of the organism.
* A '''nearly neutral mutation''' is a mutation that may be slightly deleterious or advantageous, although most nearly neutral mutations are slightly deleterious.

==== Distribution of fitness effects ====

In reality, viewing the fitness effects of mutations in these discrete categories is an oversimplification. Attempts have been made to infer the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) using [[mutagenesis]] experiments and theoretical models applied to molecular sequence data. Distribution of fitness effects, as used to determine the relative abundance of different types of mutations (i.e. strongly deleterious, nearly neutral or advantageous), is relevant to many evolutionary questions, such as the maintenance of [[genetic variation]],<ref name=[1]>{{cite journal|last=Charlesworth|first=D|coauthors=Charlesworth B, Morgan M T|title=The pattern of neutral molecular variation under the background selection model.|journal=Genetics|year=1995|volume=141|issue=4|pmid=8601499|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/141/4/1619.long|pmc=1206892|pages=1619–32}}</ref> the rate of genomic decay,<ref name=[2]>{{cite journal|last=Loewe|first=L|title=Quantifying the genomic decay paradox due to Muller's ratchet in human mitochondrial DNA.|journal=Genet Res|year=2006|volume=87|issue=2|pages=133–59|doi=10.1017/S0016672306008123|pmid=16709275|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=439711}}</ref> the maintenance of outcrossing sexual reproduction as opposed to inbreeding<ref>Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE.

In summary, it is generally accepted that the majority of mutations are neutral or deleterious, with rare mutations being advantageous; however, the proportion of types of mutations varies between species. This indicates two important points: first, the proportion of effectively neutral mutations is likely to vary between species, resulting from dependence on [[effective population size]]; second, the average effect of deleterious mutations varies dramatically between species.<ref name=[17] /> In addition, the DFE also differs between [[coding region]]s and [[Noncoding DNA|non-coding regions]], with the DFE of non-coding DNA containing more weakly selected mutations.<ref name=[17] />

===By impact on protein sequence===
*A '''[[frameshift mutation]]''' is a mutation caused by [[gene insertion|insertion]] or [[genetic deletion|deletion]] of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by [[codon]]s, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the [[reading frame]], or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] from the original.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Mutation?topic=49496 ''Mutation''. ed. E.Monosson and C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]</ref>  The earlier in the sequence the deletion or insertion occurs, the more altered the protein produced is.
:{{anchor|in-frame}} In contrast, any insertion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an ''in-frame mutation''
*A '''[[nonsense mutation]]''' is a [[point mutation]] in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature [[stop codon]], or a ''nonsense codon'' in the transcribed mRNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product. (See [[Stop codon]].)
*'''[[Missense mutations]]''' or ''nonsynonymous mutations'' are types of [[point mutation]]s where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid.  This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional.  Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as [[Epidermolysis bullosa]], [[sickle-cell disease]], and [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD1]] mediated [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] {{Harv | Boillée | 2006 | p=39}}.
*A '''[[neutral mutation]]''' is a mutation that occurs in an amino acid codon which results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid. The similarity between the two is enough that little or no change is often rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode [[arginine]], a chemically similar molecule to the intended [[lysine]].
*'''[[Silent mutations]]''' are mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein, unless the changed amino acid is sufficiently similar to the original. They may occur in a region that does not code for a protein, or they may occur within a codon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid sequence. The phrase ''silent mutation'' is often used interchangeably with the phrase ''synonymous mutation''; however, synonymous mutations are a subcategory of the former, occurring only within exons (and necessarily exactly preserving the amino acid sequence of the protein). Synonymous mutations occur due to the [[Degeneracy (biology)|degenerate]] nature of the genetic code. (See [[Genetic code]].)

===By inheritance===
[[Image:Portulaca grandiflora mutant1.jpg|thumb|right|A mutation has caused this garden [[moss rose]] to produce flowers of different colors. This is a somatic mutation that may also be passed on in the germ line.]]
In [[multicellular organisms]] with dedicated [[reproductive cells]], mutations can be subdivided into [[germline mutation|germ line mutation]]s, which can be passed on to descendants through their reproductive cells, and [[somatic]] mutations (also called acquired mutations),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/genetics/#somaticcellgeneticmutation |title=Genome Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}.</ref> which involve cells outside the dedicated reproductive group and which are not usually transmitted to descendants.

A germline mutation gives rise to a ''constitutional mutation'' in the offspring, that is, a mutation that is present in every cell. A constitutional mutation can also occur very soon after [[fertilisation]], or continue from a previous constitutional mutation in a parent.<ref>[http://www.daisyfund.org/rb/about/genetics.html RB1 Genetics] at Daisy's Eye Cancer Fund. Retrieved May 2011</ref>

The distinction between germline and somatic mutations is important in animals that have a dedicated germ line to produce reproductive cells.  However, it is of little value in understanding the effects of mutations in plants, which lack dedicated germ line.  The distinction is also blurred in those animals that reproduce [[asexually]] through mechanisms such as [[budding]], because the cells that give rise to the daughter organisms also give rise to that organisms germ line.  
A new mutation that was not inherited from either parent is called a ''[[wiktionary:de novo|de novo]]'' mutation.

Diploid organisms (e.g. humans) contain two copies of each gene – a paternal and a maternal allele. Based on the occurrence of mutation on each chromosome, we may classify mutations into three types.
*A '''heterozygous mutation''' is a mutation of only one allele.
*A '''homozygous mutation''' is  an identical mutation of both the paternal and maternal alleles.
*'''[[compound heterozygosity|Compound heterozygous]]''' mutations or a '''genetic compound''' comprises two different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles.<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33675 Medterms.com]</ref>

A '''wildtype''' or '''homozygous non-mutated''' organism is one in which neither allele is mutated.

===Special classes===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Cat]] -->
*'''Conditional mutation''' is a mutation that has wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain "permissive" environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain "restrictive" conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences at a lower temperature (permissive condition).

===Nomenclature===
A committee of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) has developed the standard human sequence variant nomenclature,<ref name="paper45">{{cite journal |last1=Den Dunnen |first1=Johan T. |last2=Antonarakis |first2=Stylianos E. |title= Mutation Nomenclature Extensions and Suggestions to Describe Complex Mutations: A Discussion|journal=Human Mutation |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=7–12 |year=2000 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-1004(200001)15:1<7::AID-HUMU4>3.0.CO;2-N |pmid=10612815 }}</ref> which should be used by researchers and [[Genetic testing|DNA diagnostic]] centers to generate unambiguous mutation descriptions. In principle, this nomenclature can also be used to describe mutations in other organisms. The nomenclature specifies the type of mutation and base or amino acid changes.

*Nucleotide substitution (e.g. 76A>T) – The number is the position of the nucleotide from  the 5' end, the first letter represents the wild type nucleotide, and the second letter represents the nucleotide which replaced the wild type. In the given example, the adenine at the 76th position was replaced by a thymine.
**If it becomes necessary to differentiate between mutations in genomic DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and RNA, a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, then it would be written as g.100G>C if the mutation occurred in genomic DNA, m.100G>C if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial DNA, or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.
*Amino acid substitution (e.g. D111E) – The first letter is the one letter code of the wild type amino acid, the number is the position of the amino acid from the [[N-terminus]], and the second letter is the one letter code of the amino acid present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second amino acid (e.g. D111X).
*Amino acid deletion (e.g. ΔF508) – The Greek letter Δ ([[delta (letter)|delta]]) indicates a deletion. The letter refers to the amino acid present in the wild type and the number is the position from the N terminus of the amino acid were it to be present as in the wild type.

==Harmful mutations==
Changes in DNA caused by mutation can cause errors in [[protein]] sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, in order to function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. A condition caused by mutations in one or more genes is called a [[genetic disorder]]. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of ''[[Drosophila]]'' suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, this will probably be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.<ref name="Sawyer2007" /> However, studies have shown that only 7% of mutations  in [[yeast]] that are not in genes are harmful.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Doniger SW |title=A Catalog of Neutral and Deleterious Polymorphism in Yeast |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e1000183 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18769710 |pmc=2515631 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000183 |editor1-last=Pritchard |editor1-first=Jonathan K. |author-separator=, |author2=Kim HS |author3=Swain D |display-authors=3 |last4=Corcuera |first4=D |last5=Williams |first5=M |last6=Yang |first6=SP |last7=Fay |first7=JC}}</ref>

If a mutation is present in a [[germ cell]], it can give rise to offspring that carries the mutation in all of its cells. This is the case in [[hereditary disease]]s. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germ-line mutations may have an increased risk of cancer.  A list of 34 such germ-line mutations is given in the article [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]. On the other hand, a mutation may occur in a [[somatic cell]] of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism, and certain mutations can cause the cell to become malignant, and thus cause [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ionov Y, Peinado MA, Malkhosyan S, Shibata D, Perucho M|title=Ubiquitous somatic mutations in simple repeated sequences reveal a new mechanism for colonic carcinogenesis |volume=363 |issue=6429 |pages=558–61 |year=1993 |doi=10.1038/363558a0 |pmid=8505985}}</ref>

A DNA damage can cause an error when the DNA is replicated, and this error of replication can cause a gene mutation that, in turn, could cause a genetic disorder.  DNA damages are repaired by the [[DNA repair]] system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair damages in DNA. Because DNA can be damaged in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the body protects itself from disease.  Once a DNA damage has given rise to a mutation, the mutation cannot be repaired.  DNA repair pathways can only recognize and act on "abnormal" structures in the DNA. Once a mutation occurs in a gene sequence it then has normal DNA structure and cannot be repaired.

==Beneficial mutations==
Although mutations that change in protein sequences can be harmful to an organism; on occasions, the effect may be positive in a given environment. In this case, the mutation may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild-type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through [[natural selection]].

For example, a specific 32 [[base pair]] deletion in human [[CCR5]] ([[CCR5#CCR5-.CE.9432|CCR5-Δ32]]) confers [[HIV]] resistance to [[Zygosity|homozygotes]] and delays [[AIDS]] onset in [[Zygosity|heterozygotes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sullivan |title=The coreceptor mutation CCR5Δ32 influences the dynamics of HIV epidemics and is selected for by HIV |journal=PNAS |volume=95 |issue=18 |pages=10214–10219 |year=2001 |doi=10.1073/pnas.181325198 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/18/10214.full |pmid=11517319 |pmc=56941 |author-separator=, |author2=Amy D. |display-authors=2 |last3=Kirschner |first3=D}}</ref> The CCR5 mutation is more common in those of European descent. One possible explanation of the [[etiology]] of the relatively high frequency of CCR5-Δ32 in the European population is that it conferred resistance to the [[bubonic plague]] in mid-14th century Europe. People with this mutation were more likely to survive infection; thus its frequency in the population increased.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_plague/clues.html |title= PBS:Secrets of the Dead. Case File: Mystery of the Black Death}}</ref> This theory could explain why this mutation is not found in southern Africa, where the bubonic plague never reached. A newer theory suggests that the [[selective pressure]] on the CCR5 Delta 32 mutation was caused by [[smallpox]] instead of the bubonic plague.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Galvani A, Slatkin M |title=Evaluating plague and smallpox as historical selective pressures for the CCR5-Δ32 HIV-resistance allele |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=100 |issue=25 |pages=15276–9 |year=2003 |pmid=14645720 |pmc=299980 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2435085100 }}</ref>

Another example is [[Sickle cell disease]], a blood disorder in which the body produces an abnormal type of the oxygen-carrying substance [[hemoglobin]] in the [[red blood cells]]. One-third of all [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] inhabitants of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] carry the gene,<ref>[http://sicklecell.md Sicklecell.md]</ref> because in areas where malaria is common, there is a [[Evolution|survival value]] in carrying only a single sickle-cell gene ([[sickle cell trait]]).<ref>[http://sicklecell.md/faq.asp#q1 Sicklecell.md FAQ]: "Why is Sickle Cell Anaemia only found in Black people?</ref> Those with only one of the two [[alleles]] of the sickle-cell disease are more resistant to malaria, since the infestation of the malaria plasmodium is halted by the sickling of the cells which it infests.

==Prion mutation==

[[Prion]]s are proteins and do not contain genetic material. However, prion replication has been shown to be subject to mutation and [[natural selection]] just like other forms of replication.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8435320.stm 'Lifeless' prion proteins are 'capable of evolution']</ref>

A change in the genetic structure that is not inherited from a parent, and also not passed to offspring, is called a ''somatic cell genetic mutation'' or ''acquired mutation''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/genetics/#somaticcellgeneticmutation |title=Definition of somatic cell genetic mutation |work=Genome Dictionary |accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref>

Cells with heterozygous mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated.  This kind of mutation happens all the time in living organisms, but it is difficult to measure the rate.  Measuring this rate is important in predicting the rate at which people may develop cancer.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16166284/ "A quantitative measurement of the human somatic mutation rate", by Araten DJ, et al, Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;65(18):8111-7.; erratum in Cancer Res. 2005 Nov 15;65(22):10635]</ref>

[[Point mutations]] may arise from spontaneous mutations that occur during [[DNA replication]]. The rate of mutation may be increased by [[mutagen]]s. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from [[ultraviolet light|UV rays]], [[X-ray]]s or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.
