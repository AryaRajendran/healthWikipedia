==Alcohol as a carcinogen and cocarcinogen==
The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer) of the [[World Health Organization]] has classified alcohol as a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]]. Its evaluation states, "There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in humans. …Alcoholic beverages are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Alcohol drinking |publisher=[[World Health Organization]], [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] |location=Lyon |year=1988 |isbn=92-832-1244-4 |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol44/volume44.pdf |author=International Agency for Rescarch on Cancer, World Health Organization.}} p8</ref>

==Possible mechanisms of alcohol as a carcinogen==

=== Acetaldehyde ===
[[Acetaldehyde]] is produced by the liver as it breaks down ethanol. The liver then normally eliminates 99% of the acetaldehyde. An average liver can process 7&nbsp;grams of ethanol per hour. For example, it takes 12 hours to eliminate the ethanol in a bottle of wine, giving 12 hours or more of acetaldehyde exposure.
A study of 818 heavy drinkers found that those who are exposed to more acetaldehyde than normal through a defect in the gene for [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] are at greater risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ijc.21583 | author = Homann N, Stickel F, König IR ''et al.'' | year = 2006| title = Alcohol dehydrogenase 1C*1 allele is a genetic marker for alcohol-associated cancer in heavy drinkers | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112141765/HTMLSTART | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 118 | issue = 8| pages = 1998–2002 | pmid=16287084}}</ref>

* local effects of alcohol
* metabolism to [[acetaldehyde]] (which may be mutagenic at physiologically meaningful levels<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Theruvathu JA, Jaruga P, Nath RG, Dizdaroglu M, Brooks PJ |title=Polyamines stimulate the formation of mutagenic 1,N2-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts from acetaldehyde |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=3513–20 |year=2005 |pmid=15972793 |pmc=1156964 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki661}}</ref>)

Purohita ''et al.'' propose an overlapping list:
# production of [[acetaldehyde]], which is a weak mutagen and carcinogen
# induction of [[CYP2E1|cytochrome P450 2E1]] and associated oxidative stress and conversion of procarcinogens to carcinogens
# depletion of [[S-Adenosyl methionine|S-adenosylmethionine]] and, consequently, induction of global DNA hypomethylation;
# induction of increased production of inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins and components of extracellular signal-regulated kinase–mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling
# accumulation of iron and associated oxidative stress

Several European studies have linked the inherited hepatic [[porphyrias]] with  a predisposition to hepatocellular carcinoma. Typical risk factors for HCC need not be present with the acute hepatic porphyrias, specifically acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria. [[Porphyria cutanea tarda]] is also associated with HCC, but with typical risk factors including evidence of hepatotropic viruses, hemochromatosis and alcoholic cirrhosis. Tyrosinemia Type I, an inherited disorder in tyrosine metabolism impacting the second enzyme in the heme metabolic pathway is associated with a high risk of developing HCC in younger populations, including children.

Alcohol is a risk factor for cancers of the [[oral cancer|mouth]], [[Esophageal cancer|esophagus]], [[pharyngeal cancer|pharynx]] and [[Laryngeal cancer|larynx]]. The U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] states "Drinking alcohol increases the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx, larynx, and liver in men and women, … In general, these risks increase after about one daily drink for women and two daily drinks for men. (A drink is defined as 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.) … Also, using alcohol with tobacco is riskier than using either one alone, because it further increases the chances of getting cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alcohol Consumption |url=http://progressreport.cancer.gov/doc_detail.asp?pid=1&did=2007&chid=71&coid=706&mid= |year=2007 |month=December |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |work=Cancer Trends Progress Report – 2007 Update |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>

A review of the epidemiological literature published from 1966 to 2006 concluded that:
* The risk of esophageal cancer nearly doubled in the first two years following alcohol cessation, a sharp increase that may be due to the fact that some people only stop drinking when they are already experiencing disease symptoms. However, risk then decreased rapidly and significantly after longer periods of abstention.
* Risk of head and neck cancer only reduced significantly after 10 years of cessation.
* After more than 20 years of alcohol cessation, the risks for both cancers were similar to those seen in people who never drank alcohol.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Alcohol and cancer: is drinking the new smoking? |publisher=[[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] |date=26 September 2007 |url=http://www.camh.net/News_events/News_releases_and_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/alcohol_cancer_research.html |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Alcohol And Cancer: Is Drinking The New Smoking? |publisher=[[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]], [[Science Daily]] |date=28 September 2007 |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070926094722.htm |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>

"About 7 out of 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis are due to long term heavy drinking. Chronic pancreatitis is a known risk factor for cancer of the pancreas.

==Recommended maximum alcohol intake==
{{Main|Recommended maximum intake of alcoholic beverages}}
As outlined above, there is no recommended alcohol intake with respect to cancer risk alone as it varies with each individual cancer. See [[Recommended maximum intake of alcoholic beverages]] for a list of governments' guidances on alcohol intake which, for a healthy man, range from 140–280g per week.

One meta-analysis suggests that risks of cancers may start below the recommended levels. "Risk increased significantly for drinkers, compared with non-drinkers, beginning at an intake of 25 g (< 2 standard drinks) per day for the following: cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (relative risk, RR, 1.9), esophagus (RR 1.4), larynx (RR 1.4), breast (RR 1.3), liver (RR 1.2), colon (RR 1.1), and rectum (RR 1.1)"<ref>[http://www.bu.edu/act/alcoholandhealth/issues/issue_sept04/html/92004saitz_corrao.html Alcohol and Serious Consequences: Risks Increase Even With "Moderate" Intake]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Corrao G, Bagnardi V, Zambon A, La Vecchia C |title=A meta-analysis of alcohol consumption and the risk of 15 diseases |journal=Preventive Medicine |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=613–9 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15066364 |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2003.11.027}}</ref>

World Cancer Research Fund recommends that people aim to limit consumption to two drinks a day for a man and one for a woman. It defines a "drink" as containing about 10–15&nbsp;grams of ethanol.<ref>World Cancer Research Fund, Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Persepctive, http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/</ref>
