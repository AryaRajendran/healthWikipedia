'''Respect for persons''' is the concept that all people should be given the right to fully exercise their [[autonomy]]. Showing respect for persons is a system for interaction in which one entity ensures that another has [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] to be able to make a [[choice]].

This concept is usually discussed in the context of [[research ethics]]. It is one of the three basic principles of research ethics stated in the [[Belmont Report]] issued by the Office of Human Subject Research; it comprises two essential moral requirements: to recognize the right for autonomy and to protect individuals who are disadvantaged to the extent that they cannot practice this right.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research |location=[[Washington, DC]] |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|url=http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html#gob1}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>

An autonomous person is defined as an individual who is capable of self-legislation and is able to make judgments and actions based on his/her particular set of values, preferences, and beliefs. Respecting a person’s autonomy thus involves considering his/her choices and decisions without deliberate obstruction. It also requires that subjects be treated in a non-degrading manner out of respect for their dignity. In practice, respect for persons is operationalized by obtaining [[Informed Consent]] from all individuals who are going to be research subjects.

==Vulnerable populations==
The standard case for applying respect for persons is when the person receiving the health intervention is of sound mind, fit to make personal decisions, and empowered to choose from various options. Other cases involve showing respect to people who for whatever reason are not free to choose among the typical range of options when making a decision.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1177/1740774507087552}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert J.|title=Ethics and regulation of clinical research|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-04288-7|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref>

The word “vulnerability” stems from the Latin vulnerare, “to wound.” In medical research ethics, the term Vulnerable Populations generally refers to individuals whose situations do not allow them to protect their own interests. The categories of individuals that constitute Vulnerable Populations are outlined under The Common Rule (45 CFR 46, Subparts A-D). These include individuals who are minors, prisoners, pregnant, physically handicapped, mentally disabled, old, economically disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged, or subordinates in hierarchical groups (e.g. a soldier).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ruof|first=Mary, C.|title=Vulnerability, Vulnerable Populations, and Policy.|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal.|year=2004|volume=4|issue=14|pages=411–425}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2.

These individuals are entitled to protection, and additional ethical justification is needed to involve such populations in human subject studies. In such cases, a balance should be established between protecting subjects from exploitation and depriving these subjects of access to the potential benefits of research. 

Reasons justifying the participation of these subjects would include that some studies could not be carried out without a vulnerable population. Another justification would be that the aim of the study is to gain knowledge to improve diagnosis, prevention or treatment of diseases associated specifically with that population.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ruof|first=Mary, C.|title=Vulnerability, Vulnerable Populations, and Policy.|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal.|year=2004|volume=4|issue=14|pages=411–425}}</ref>
