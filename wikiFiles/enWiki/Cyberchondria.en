'''Cyberchondria''' (or '''cyberchondriasis''') is the unfounded escalation of concerns about common symptomology based on review of search results and literature online.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Ryen White | coauthors = Eric Horvitz |title=Cyberchondria: Studies of the escalation of medical concerns in Web search |journal=ACM Transactions on Information Systems |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=2009|doi=10.1145/1629096.1629101 |pages = 1}}</ref><ref name="microsoftamia"/> Articles in popular media position cyberchondria anywhere from temporary [[Neurosis|neurotic]] excess to adjunct [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondria]]. Cyberchondria is a growing concern among many healthcare practitioners as patients can now research any and all symptoms of a rare disease, illness or condition, and manifest a state of medical anxiety.

== Derivation and use ==
The term "cyberchondria" is a [[portmanteau]] [[neologism]] derived from the terms [[Internet-related prefixes|cyber-]] and [[hypochondria]]. (The term "[[hypochondrium]]" derives from Greek and literally means the region below the "[[cartilage]]" or "[[Human sternum|breast bone]].")<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionaryy]]'' #rd Ed. (2003)</ref> Researchers at Harris Interactive clarified the [[etymology]] of cyberchondria, and state in studies and interviews that the term is not necessarily intended to be [[pejorative]].<ref>{{cite web

==Studies==

The first systematic study of cyberchondria, reported in November 2008, was performed by [[Microsoft]] researchers [[Ryen White]] and [[Eric Horvitz]], who conducted a large-scale study that included several phases of analysis.<ref name=microsoft>{{cite web

They also analyzed anonymized large-scale logs of queries to all of the popular search engines and noted the commonality of escalations of queries from common complaints to queries on concerning diseases.  They characterized the nature of escalations within a specific session and also found that potentially disruptive querying about disorders (arrived at via a search escalation) could continue in other sessions over days, weeks, and months, and that the queries could disrupt non-medical search activities.  Finally, the researchers did a survey of over 500 people that confirmed the prevalence of web-induced medical anxieties and that probed several aspects of the phenomenon.  The survey noted that a significant portion of subjects considered the ranking of a list of results on a medical query as somehow linked to the likelihood of relevant disorders.   The researchers highlight the difference between the information provided by standard approaches to “relevance” used by search engines in ranking results and answers to medical questions, especially when searchers are looking for likelihoods of different explanations.  They point out the potential importance of findings drawn from the psychology of judgment in their work. In particular, they point out that previously studied "biases of judgment" play a role in cyberchondria.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The researchers highlighted the potential biases of [[availability heuristic|availability]] (the recency and density of exposure of someone to events raises the assessed likelihood of the events) and [[base rate fallacy|base-rate neglect]] (people often do not properly consider the low prior probability of events in assessing the likelihood of events when they review evidence in support of the event) as influencing both search engines and then people searching the web. [[Confirmation bias]], a tendency for people to confirm their preconceptions or hypotheses, may also contribute to cyberchondria.

They found that overall, people report to having a low level of health anxiety, but that Web-based escalation of concerns occurs frequently for around one in five people. Two in five people report that interactions with the Web increases medical anxiety and approximately half of people report that it reduces anxiety. Traits such as a person’s general anxiety level and predispositions to anxiety may contribute to the levels of medical anxiety experienced and to the likelihood of Web-induced medical escalation. White and Horvitz suggest that Web content providers be cognizant of their potential to heighten medical anxiety and consider the ramifications of publishing alarming medical information, emphasize the importance of Web content in facilitating patient-physician interaction, and recommend periodic surveys and analysis with different cohorts to track changes in health-seeking experiences over time.

They construct and then characterize the performance of classifiers that predict whether an escalation will occur in issued queries following the visit to a page. Their findings show that features such as serious illness preceding benign explanations in page (e.g., cancer is mentioned before caffeine in pages pertaining to headaches), serious illness vs. benign explanation appears in page title or near beginning of page, page from Web forum, and page has external verification are all important predictors of subsequent escalation (or non-escalation).

==Medical websites ==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2008}}
In 2002 the Sydney Morning Herald wrote "a visit to an Internet clinic will probably diagnose drowsiness as chronic fatigue, anal itch as bowel cancer and a headache as a tumour."<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/09/06/1031115930130.html Natasha Wallace, "Doctor in the Mouse" Sydney Herald September 7, 2002]</ref> Many reputable medical organizations maintain websites that may include brief overviews of various conditions for individuals with a general curiosity, or more detailed information to aid the understanding of people who have been properly diagnosed.<ref name="bmjjournal"/> Often listing diagnoses without regard to incidence, prevalence, or relevant risk factors, websites may lead users to suspect rather rare and unlikely diseases as the source of their complaints.  Since many benign conditions share symptoms with more serious ailments and are listed side-by-side, users without proper medical consultation may assume the worst rather than the likely diagnosis.  Web-diagnosis can cause a great deal of distress and anxiety in users who believe themselves to have incurable and serious illnesses.<ref name="microsoft"/>

Patients who go against medical advice or refuse to accept a professional diagnosis while quoting questionable web sources have become more common and can be a frustrating obstacle to physicians trying to provide a professional standard of care.  When in doubt, patients should attempt to get a [[second opinion (medicine)|second opinion]] before turning to web-based sources.  Self diagnosis should not be used as a substitute for a professional medical consultation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010 }}

== Opening lines of communication ==
Some medical practitioners are open to a patient's personal research, as this can open lines of communication between doctors and patients, and prove valuable in eliciting more complete or pertinent information from the patient about their present condition.

Other doctors express concern about patients who [[self diagnosis|self-diagnose]] on the basis of information obtained from the Internet when the patient demonstrates an incomplete or distorted understanding of other diagnostic possibilities and medical likelihoods.  A patient who exaggerates one set of symptoms in support of their self-diagnosis while minimizing or suppressing contrary symptoms can impair rather than enhance a doctor's ability to reach a correct diagnosis. <ref name="bbcnews">{{cite web
