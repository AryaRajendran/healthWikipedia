Polyuria often appears in conjunction with [[polydipsia]] (increased thirst), though it is possible to have one without the other, and the latter may be a cause or an effect. [[Psychogenic polydipsia]] may lead to polyuria. 

Polyuria is physiologically normal in some circumstances, such as cold [[:wikt:diuresis|diuresis]], [[altitude diuresis]], and after drinking large amounts of fluids.

==Causes==
The most common cause of polyuria in both adults and children is uncontrolled [[diabetes mellitus]],<ref name=merck/> causing an [[osmotic diuresis]]. In the absence of diabetes mellitus, the most common causes are [[primary polydipsia]] (excessive fluid [[drinking]]), [[central diabetes insipidus]] and [[nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]].<ref name=merck/>

Polyuria may also be due to various chemical substances ([[diuretic]]s, [[caffeine]], [[alcohol]]). It may also occur after [[supraventricular tachycardia]]s, during an onset of [[atrial fibrillation]], [[childbirth]], and the removal of an obstruction within the [[urinary tract]]. Diuresis is restrained by [[antidiuretic]]s such as [[antidiuretic hormone|ADH]], [[angiotensin II]] and [[aldosterone]].

''Cold diuresis'' is the occurrence of increased urine production on exposure to cold, which also partially explains [[immersion diuresis]].

Substances that increase diuresis are called [[diuretics]].

Substances that decrease diuresis allow more [[vasopressin]] or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to be present in the kidney. 

''High-altitude diuresis'' occurs at altitudes above 10,000&nbsp;ft and is a desirable indicator of [[high-altitude adaptation|adaptation to high altitudes]]. Mountaineers who are adapting well to high altitudes experience this type of diuresis. Persons who produce less urine even in the presence of adequate fluid intake probably are not adapting well to altitude.<ref>Hackett, Peter H. ''Mountain Sickness,'' The [[American Alpine Club]], 1980. pp. 54, 62)</ref>
