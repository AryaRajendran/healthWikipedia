{{Other uses|Eye movement (disambiguation)}}

'''Eye movement''' ('''ocular motility''') is the [[Voluntary action|voluntary]] or [[Reflex action|involuntary]] movement of the [[Human eye|eye]]s, helping in acquiring, fixating and [[Eye tracking|tracking]] visual stimuli. It may also compensate for a body movement, such as when moving the head. In addition, ''[[rapid eye movement]]'' occurs during [[REM sleep]].

Eyes are the visual organs that have the [[retina]], a specialized type of [[brain]] tissue containing [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]]. These specialised cells convert light into [[electrochemical]] signals through the [[ganglion cell layer]] and travel along the [[optic nerve]] fibers to the brain.

Primates and many other invertebrates use three types of voluntary eye movement to track objects of interest: [[smooth pursuit]], vergence shifts <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pierrot-Deseilligny|first=Charles|coauthors=Milea, D. & Muri, R.

In this case, the reflexes (such as reflex shifting the eyes to a moving light) are intact, though the voluntary control is obliterated.<ref name="eb">"Sensory Reception:  Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye" Encyclopaedia Britannica,  1987</ref>

== Varieties and purpose of movement==

There are three main basic types of eye movements:
*'''Vergence Movements''' or [[Convergence (eye)|convergence]] are the movements of both eyes to make sure that the image of the object being looked at falls on the corresponding spot on both retinas.
This type of movement helps in the depth perception of objects <ref name="Heth 2010 Page 140">Carlson and Heth (2010). Psychology the Science of Behaviour 4e. Pearson Education Canada. Page 140</ref>
*[[Saccade]]s are the rapid movement of eyes that is used while scanning a visual scene. In our subjective impression, the eyes do not move smoothly across the printed page during reading. Instead, our eyes make short and rapid movements called ''saccades''.<ref>Wayne S. Murray. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences''(2003)26, page 446</ref> During each ''saccade'' the eyes move as fast as they can and the speed cannot be consciously controlled in between the stops.<ref name="Heth 2010 Page 140"/> The movements are worth a few minutes of arc, moving at regular intervals about three to four per second. One of the main uses for these saccadic eye movements is to be able to scan a greater area with the high resolution fovea of the eye.<ref>John Findlay Saccadic eye movement programming: sensory and attentional factors, Psychological Research (March 2009), 73 (2), pg. 127-135</ref>
*'''Pursuit Movements''' or [[Smooth pursuit]] are the movements that the eyes make while tracking an object's movement, so that its moving image can remain maintained on [[fovea]].<ref name="Heth 2010 Page 140"/>

Additionally, the eyes are never completely at rest. They make fast random jittering movements even when we are fixated on one point. The reason for these random movements are the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells. It appears that a constant visual stimulus can make the photoreceptors or the ganglion cells to become unresponsive; on the other hand a changing stimuli will not. Therefore, these random eye movements constantly change the stimuli that fall on the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells making the image more clear.<ref name="Heth 2010 Page 140"/>

Saccades are faster than vergence and pursuit eye movements.<ref name="eb"/>

=== Types ===
<!-- I recommend prosifying this list -->
Eye movements are typically classified as either [[duction]]s, [[version (eye)|versions]], or [[vergence]]s.<ref>Kanski, JJ. ''Clinical Ophthalmology: A Systematic Approach.'' Boston:Butterworth-Heinemann;1989.</ref><ref>Awwad, S. [http://www.eyeweb.org/motility.htm "Motility & Binocular Vision"]. ''EyeWeb.org.''</ref> A duction is an eye movement involving only one eye; a version is an eye movement involving both eyes in which each eye moves in the same direction; a vergence is an eye movement involving both eyes in which each eye moves in opposite directions.

=== Yoked movement vs. antagonistic movement ===

* [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]
* [[Sherrington's law of reciprocal innervation]]

The visual system in the brain is too slow to process that information if the images are slipping across the retina at more than a few degrees per second.<ref>Westheimer, Gerald & McKee, Suzanne P.; "Visual acuity in the presence of retinal-image motion". ''Journal of the Optical Society of America'' 1975 '''65'''(7), 847-50.</ref> Thus, to be able to see while we are moving, the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes. Another specialisation of visual system in many vertebrate animals is the development of a small area of the retina with a very high [[visual acuity]]. This area is called the [[fovea]], and covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Eye movements are thus very important for visual perception, and any failure to make them correctly can lead to serious visual disabilities. To see a quick demonstration of this fact, try the following experiment: hold your hand up, about one foot (30&nbsp;cm) in front of your nose. Keep your head still, and shake your hand from side to side, slowly at first, and then faster and faster. At first you will be able to see your fingers quite clearly. But as the frequency of shaking passes about [[hertz|1 Hz]], the fingers will become a blur. Now, keep your hand still, and shake your head (up and down or left and right). No matter how fast you shake your head, the image of your fingers remains clear. This demonstrates that the brain can move the eyes opposite to head motion much better than it can follow, or pursue, a hand movement. When your pursuit system fails to keep up with the moving hand, images slip on the retina and you see a blurred hand.

The brain must point both eyes accurately enough that the object of regard falls on [[retinal correspondence|corresponding points of the two retinas]] to avoid the perception of [[Diplopia|double vision]]. In [[primates]] (monkeys, apes, and humans), the movements of different body parts are controlled by [[muscle#Types|striated muscles]] acting around joints. The movements of the eye are slightly different in that the eyes are not rigidly attached to anything, but are held in the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] by six [[extraocular muscles]].

== Anatomy{{anchor|Anatomy of eye movement}} ==

=== Extraocular muscles{{anchor|Ocular anatomy: the extraocular muscles}} ===
{{main|Extraocular muscles}}

Each eye has six extraocular muscles (EOM) that bring about the various eye movements:

* [[Lateral rectus muscle|Lateral rectus]], (supplied by Abducens nerve)
* [[Medial rectus muscle|Medial rectus]], (supplied by Oculomotor nerve)
* [[Inferior rectus muscle|Inferior rectus]], (supplied by Oculomotor nerve)
* [[Superior rectus muscle|Superior rectus]], (supplied by Oculomotor nerve)
* [[Inferior oblique muscle|Inferior oblique]], (supplied by Oculomotor nerve) and
* [[Superior oblique muscle|Superior oblique]] (supplied by Trochlear nerve)

{{Eye movement muscles}}

When the muscles exert differential tensions (contractions in synergistic muscles and relaxation of antagonist muscles), a torque is exerted on the globe that causes it to turn. This is an almost pure rotation, with only about one millimeter of translation.<ref>Carpenter, Roger H.S.; ''Movements of the Eyes (2nd ed.)''. Pion Ltd, London, 1988. ISBN 0-85086-109-8.</ref> Thus, the eye can be considered as undergoing rotations around a single point in the center of the eye.

=== Neuroanatomy ===

The brain exerts ultimate control over both voluntary and involuntary eye movements. Three cranial nerves carry signals from the brain to control the extraocular muscles. They are:

* III cranial nerve: [[Oculomotor nerve]]/Oculomotor nucleus
* IV cranial nerve: [[Trochlear nerve]]/Trochlear nucleus
* VI cranial nerve: [[Abducens nerve]]/[[Abducens nucleus]]
