The '''Alpins Method of astigmatism analysis''' is a method of [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] analysis developed by Australian [[ophthalmologist]] [[Noel A. Alpins|Noel Alpins]]. The seminal publication for the method, which employs [[vector calculus|vector mathematics]], was in the ''Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery'' in 1993.<ref name="Alpins93">{{cite journal |pmid=8355160 |year=1993 |last1=Alpins |first1=NA |title=A new method of analyzing vectors for changes in astigmatism |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=524–33 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}{{Primary source-inline|date=February 2012}}</ref><ref name="Koch1998">{{cite journal |pmid=9559453 |year=1998 |last1=Koch |first1=DD |last2=Kohnen |first2=T |last3=Obstbaum |first3=SA |last4=Rosen |first4=ES |title=Format for reporting refractive surgical data |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=285–7 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref> Since its introduction, the method has been further advanced by Alpins,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12084766 |year=2002 |last1=Alpins |first1=N |title=A re-analysis of astigmatism correction |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=832 |pmc=1771183 |journal=The British journal of ophthalmology |doi=10.1136/bjo.86.7.832-a}}{{Primary source-inline|date=February 2012}}</ref> and has been used or cited by many other investigators involved in analyzing the results of [[refractive surgery|refractive]], [[cornea]]l, and [[cataract surgery|cataract]]/[[Intraocular lens|intraocular lens (IOL)]] surgical procedures.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid=9480341 |year=1997 |last1=Koch |first1=DD |title=Excimer laser technology: new options coming to fruition |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=1429–30 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid=9850884 |year=1998 |last1=Koch |first1=DD |title= Reporting astigmatism data |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1545 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17057812 |year=2005 |last1=Hersh |first1=PS |title=Optics of conductive keratoplasty: Implications for presbyopia management |volume=103 |pages=412–56 |pmc=1447583 |journal=Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14977772 |year=2004 |last1=Lim |first1=L |last2=Pesudovs |first2=K |last3=Goggin |first3=M |last4=Coster |first4=DJ |title=Late onset post-keratoplasty astigmatism in patients with keratoconus |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=371–6 |pmc=1772053 |journal=The British journal of ophthalmology |doi=10.1136/bjo.2003.027037}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12642305 |year=2003 |last1=Lee |first1=GA |last2=Pérez-Santonja |first2=JJ |last3=Maloof |first3=A |last4=Ficker |first4=LA |last5=Dart |first5=JK |title=Effects of lamellar keratotomy on postkeratoplasty astigmatism |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=432–5 |pmc=1771601 |journal=The British journal of ophthalmology |doi=10.1136/bjo.87.4.432}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12446403 |year=2002 |last1=Morlet |first1=N |last2=Minassian |first2=D |last3=Dart |first3=J |title=Astigmatism and the analysis of its surgical correction |volume=86 |issue=12 |pages=1458–9 |pmc=1771428 |journal=The British journal of ophthalmology |doi=10.1136/bjo.86.12.1458}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10460767 |year=1999 |last1=Webber |first1=SK |last2=Lawless |first2=MA |last3=Sutton |first3=GL |last4=Rogers |first4=CM |title=LASIK for post penetrating keratoplasty astigmatism and myopia |volume=83 |issue=9 |pages=1013–8 |pmc=1723178 |journal=The British journal of ophthalmology |doi=10.1136/bjo.83.9.1013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7886866 |year=1994 |last1=Taylor |first1=HR |last2=Carson |first2=CA |title=Excimer laser treatment for high and extreme myopia |volume=92 |pages=251–64; discussion 264–70 |pmc=1298510 |journal=Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society}}</ref> Although Alpins’ earlier work was sometimes overlooked or underacknowledged in some subsequent publications on the subject,<ref name="Eydelman">{{cite journal |pmid=16447941 |year=2006 |last1=Eydelman |first1=MB |last2=Drum |first2=B |last3=Holladay |first3=J |last4=Hilmantel |first4=G |last5=Kezirian |first5=G |last6=Durrie |first6=D |last7=Stulting |first7=RD |last8=Sanders |first8=D |last9=Wong |first9=B |title=Standardized analyses of correction of astigmatism by laser systems that reshape the cornea |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=81–95 |journal=Journal of refractive surgery}}</ref><ref name="Dupps2008">{{cite journal |pmid=18721687 |year=2008 |last1=Dupps Jr |first1=WJ |title=Impact of citation practices: Beyond journal impact factors |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages=1419–21 |doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2008.07.001 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref> the Alpins Method of astigmatism analysis eventually became a standard in the field, and the foundation for an approach to astigmatism analysis endorsed by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) Astigmatism Project Group.<ref name="Eydelman"/><ref name="Dupps2008"/><ref>{{cite journal | pmid=11165844 |year=2001 |last1=Koch |first1=DD |title=How should we analyze astigmatic data?

In brief, the Alpins Method determines a goal for astigmatism correction and a treatment required to achieve that goal. The method also allows the calculation of the principal components by which an operation fails to achieve its goal, and other components that assist in comparing the results of astigmatism surgery for individuals and groups of individuals. The Alpins Method has become an accepted standard worldwide for reporting the results of studies that include refraction and corneal astigmatism measurements.<ref name="Alpins93"/><ref name="Koch1998" /><ref name="Eydelman"/><ref name="Sakimoto">{{cite journal |pmid=16650653 |year=2006 |last1=Sakimoto |first1=T |last2=Rosenblatt |first2=MI |last3=Azar |first3=DT |title=Laser eye surgery for refractive errors |volume=367 |issue=9520 |pages=1432–47 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68275-5 |journal=Lancet}}</ref>

==Background==
In the early 1990s, Alpins first began to examine astigmatism analysis and treatment as they applied to [[LASIK|laser modalities]]. It became apparent to him that the approach to astigmatism at that time was inconsistent and confusing.<ref name="AlpinsBoyd">Alpins N, Stamatelatos G. [http://www.newvisionclinics.com.au/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=43903 "Chapter 24: The Cornea – Part X: Treatment and analysis of astigmatism during the laser era"]. In: Boyd BF, ed. ''Modern Ophthalmology: The Highlights.'' Clayton, Panama: Jaypee-Highlights Medical Publishers, Inc; 2010.{{Primary source-inline|date=February 2012}}</ref> He noted that many approaches simply compared pre- and postoperative astigmatism magnitude values with no consideration of the axis of astigmatism or the amount of attempted change. Other approaches calculated a mean of the axes. None of the methods assessed the success of the results nor the extent to which surgical goals had been achieved.<ref name="AlpinsBoyd"/><ref name="Croes"/>

A description of surgically induced astigmatism vector (SIA), one of the central measures of the Alpins Method, dates back to the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511702259.011 |chapter=On a Mode of Measuring the Astigmatism of a Defective Eye |title=Mathematical and Physical Papers vol.2 |year=2009 |last1=Stokes |first1=George Gabriel |isbn=978-0-511-70225-9 |volume=2 |pages=172}}</ref> Other authors have also contributed to a vector analysis approach to corneal incisions at the 90° and 180° meridia<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2258811 |year=1990 |last1=Naeser |first1=K |title=Conversion of keratometer readings to polar values |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=741–5 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref> and polar values outside the 90° and 180° meridia.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8201567 |year=1994 |last1=Naeser |first1=K |last2=Behrens |first2=JK |last3=Naeser |first3=EV |title=Quantitative assessment of corneal astigmatic surgery: Expanding the polar values concept |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=162–8 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9100111 |year=1997 |last1=Naeser |first1=K |last2=Behrens |first2=JK |title=Correlation between polar values and vector analysis |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=76–81 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3539177 |year=1986 |last1=Wishart |first1=MS |last2=Wishart |first2=PK |last3=Gregor |first3=ZJ |title=Corneal astigmatism following cataract extraction |volume=70 |issue=11 |pages=825–30 |pmc=1040836 |journal=The British journal of ophthalmology |doi=10.1136/bjo.70.11.825}}</ref> The Alpins Method enabled a corneal astigmatism analysis to be performed even where treatment parameters were based on refractive values. The advent of [[excimer laser]] technology (e.g., laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, or [[LASIK]]), however, introduced a conundrum between [[radial keratotomy|incisional]] and [[excimer laser|ablation]] techniques; specifically, should treatment be planned according to [[refractive error|refractive cylinder values]] as introduced with [[excimer laser|laser refractive surgery]], or corneal astigmatism parameters as had been customary with [[radial keratotomy|incisional surgery]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3559948 |year=1987 |last1=Thornton |first1=SP |last2=Sanders |first2=DR |title=Graded nonintersecting transverse incisions for correction of idiopathic astigmatism |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=27–31 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3772786 |year=1986 |last1=Nordan |first1=LT |title=Quantifiable astigmatism correction: Concepts and suggestions, 1986 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=507–18 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2076422 |year=1990 |last1=Lindstrom |first1=RL |title=The surgical correction of astigmatism: A clinician's perspective |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=441–54 |journal=Refractive & corneal surgery}}</ref>

The Alpins Method provided a consistent, logical approach to quantifying and comparing the success of various refractive surgical procedures, and refining/planning surgery to achieve even better results, both in individuals and groups of individuals receiving refractive surgery. The Alpins Method determines a treatment path and defined astigmatic target that in many instances is not zero, although prior to the Alpins Method zero had been a nearly unanimous, but inachievable, preference.<ref name="AlpinsBoyd"/>

==Refractive error and astigmatism in the population==
The ideal [[cornea]] of the eye is a perfect dome with a base that is a perfect circle. For people with astigmatism, the dome is not perfectly spherical and the base is elliptical to one degree or another (Figure 1).

[[Image:AlpinsFig1.png|thumb|alt=The base of a cornea with regular astigmatism.|'''Figure 1'''. The base of a cornea with regular astigmatism is an ellipse. The long axis of the ellipse (A) at 10° is perpendicular to the short axis (B). In the otherwise normal astigmatic human eye, the long axis can be found anywhere from 1° to 180°. However, astigmatism with the long axis near 180°, called "with-the-rule" astigmatism, is considered "better"—i.e., people having with-the-rule astigmatism can see better and report less handicap than people with similar degrees of against-the-rule astigmatism.]]

Since the late 1970s, eye surgeons have been taking advantage of the refractive power of the cornea to correct nearsightedness ([[myopia]]) and farsightedness ([[hyperopia]]). In general, they flatten the dome of the cornea to correct myopia, and steepen the dome of the cornea to correct hyperopia. Either way, the goal is to produce a focused image on the [[retina]], a light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye that serves like the film in a camera.<ref>"Sensory reception: human vision: structure and function of the human eye," vol. 27, ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 1987.</ref>

Myopia and hyperopia in the absence of astigmatism are said to be spherical. The correction of spherical myopia and hyperopia by changing the shape of the cornea is a relatively straightforward process. When astigmatism is thrown into the equation, however, [[refractive surgery]] becomes logarithmically more complicated. It is estimated that as many as half of the patients who are candidates for refractive surgery, who may constitute half of the world's population, have a degree of astigmatism sufficient to be of concern to the refractive surgeon.<ref name="Croes">Croes KJ, [http://www.newvisionclinics.com.au/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=43262 "The Alpins method: a breakthrough in astigmatism analysis"], ''Medical Electronics'', September 1998.</ref><ref>Report from Arthur D.

==Basics of the Alpins Method==

===The golf analogy===
The Alpins Method of astigmatism analysis has many parallels to the game of golf<ref name="AlpinsGoggin">{{cite journal |pmid=14711444 |year=2004 |last1=Alpins |first1=NA |last2=Goggin |first2=M |title=Practical astigmatism analysis for refractive outcomes in cataract and refractive surgery |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=109–22 |journal=Survey of ophthalmology |doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2003.10.010}}</ref> (Figure 2).

[[Image:AlpinsFig2.png|thumb|alt=Vector mapping of a golf putt.|'''Figure 2'''. Vector mapping of a golf putt demonstrates fundamentals of the Alpins approach to astigmatism analysis: the target induced astigmatism vector (TIA), which is the astigmatic change the surgeon intends to induce; the surgical induced astigmatism vector (SIA), which is the astigmatic change the surgeon actually induces; and the difference vector (DV), which is an astigmatic change, by magnitude and axis, that would allow the surgeon to reach target on a second attempt.]]

A golf putt is a vector, possessing magnitude (length) and axis (direction). The intended putt (the path from the ball to the hole) corresponds to Alpins' target induced astigmatism vector (TIA), which is the astigmatic change (by magnitude and axis) the surgeon intends to induce in order to correct the patient's preexisting astigmatism to the derived or calculated target. The actual putt (the path the ball follows when hit) corresponds to Alpins' surgical induced astigmatism vector (SIA), which is the amount and axis of astigmatic change the surgeon actually induces. If the golfer misses the cup, the difference vector (DV) corresponds to the second putt—that is, a putt (by magnitude and axis) that would allow the golfer to hit the cup (the surgeon to completely correct) on a second attempt.<ref name="Alpins93"/><ref name="AlpinsBoyd"/>

===The double-angle vector diagram===
Figure 3 is a double-angle vector diagram (DAVD) that allows calculations in a 360° sense and permits the use of rectangular ([[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]]) coordinates. It is important to note that vectors can only be calculated; they cannot be measured like astigmatism. The analytical technique here simplifies interpretation of differences among preoperative, desired, and achieved astigmatic values, and allows the calculation of the magnitude and direction of surgical vectors. The trigonometry is described in these references:<ref name="Alpins93"/><ref name="AlpinsBoyd"/><ref name="AlpinsJan97">{{cite journal |pmid=9100110 |year=1997 |last1=Alpins |first1=NA |title=New method of targeting vectors to treat astigmatism |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=65–75 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref><ref name="AlpinsDec97">{{cite journal |pmid=9456408 |year=1997 |last1=Alpins |first1=NA |title=Vector analysis of astigmatism changes by flattening, steepening, and torque |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=1503–14 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}{{Primary source-inline|date=February 2012}}</ref>

[[Image:AlpinsFig3.png|thumb|alt=Double-angle vector diagram (DAVD) used to allow calculations in a 360° sense and permit the use of rectangular coordinates.|'''Figure 3'''. The target induced astigmatism vector (TIA), surgical induced astigmatism vector (SIA), and difference vector (DV) correspond to the golf putt analogy in Figure 2. The TIA, SIA, and DV are calculated from (1) the patient's preoperative astigmatism; (2) the targeted astigmatism the surgeon plans to achieve; and (3) the actual achieved effect of the surgery.]]

Line 1 in Figure 3 defines a patient's preoperative astigmatism by magnitude (length of the line) and axis (an angle from the x axis representing twice the patient's measured axis of preoperative astigmatism). Line 2 defines the target astigmatism—that is, the magnitude and axis of the correction the surgeon would like to achieve. Line 3 represents achieved astigmatism—that is, the magnitude and axis of the postoperative astigmatism. The dashed lines are the TIA, SIA, and DV, as described above. The TIA, SIA, and DV, and the description and calculation of their various relationships, comprise the essence of the Alpins Method.<ref name="Alpins93"/><ref name="AlpinsBoyd"/>

=== Important indices generated by the Alpins Method<ref name="Alpins93"/><ref name="AlpinsBoyd"/> ===
* '''Correction index (CI)'''—The ratio of the SIA to the TIA—what the surgery actually induced versus what the surgery was meant to induce. The CI is preferably 1; it is greater than 1 if an overcorrection occurs and less than 1 if there is an undercorrection. The CI is calculated by dividing the SIA (actual effect) by the TIA (target effect).
* '''Coefficient of adjustment (CA)'''—The inverse of the CI, the CA quantifies the modification needed to the initial surgery plan to have achieved a CI of 1, the ideal correction. If the surgeon achieves an overcorrection, for example, the CA might by 0.9, indicating that the surgeon should have selected a correction 90% of what was actually selected. The CA can be used to refine nomograms for future procedures.
* '''Magnitude of error (MofE)'''—The intended correction minus the actual correction in diopters.
* '''Angle of error (AE)'''—The angle described by the vectors of the intended correction versus the achieved correction (SIA minus TIA). By convention, the AE is positive if the achieved correction is on an axis counterclockwise to where it was intended, and negative if the achieved correction is clockwise to its intended axis.
* '''Index of success (IOS)'''—The IOS is calculated by dividing the DV (how far the target is missed) by the TIA (the original target effect). The IOS is a relative measure of success; that is, if golfer John attempts a long putt and golfer Bob a shorter one, and each ends up the same distance from the cup, John's putt can be considered more successful because he had the longer initial putt and a lower IOS (zero being perfect). The IOS is a valuable measure of the relative effectiveness of various surgical procedures.

Unlike previous available approaches to astigmatism analysis, the indices Alpins describes can be subjected to conventional forms of statistical analysis, generating averages, means, standard deviations, etc., for each individual component of surgery.

==Regular and irregular astigmatism==
There are 3 types of astigmatism: (1) naturally occurring regular astigmatism; (2) naturally occurring irregular astigmatism; and (3) irregular astigmatism associated with disease, trauma, or prior ocular procedures. The Alpins Method applies mainly to the first 2 types of astigmatism.

Although irregular astigmatism is commonly associated with prior ocular surgery and trauma, it is also naturally occurring and prevalent.<ref name="Bogan">{{cite journal |pmid=2369353 |year=1990 |last1=Bogan |first1=SJ |last2=Waring Go |first2=3rd |last3=Ibrahim |first3=O |last4=Drews |first4=C |last5=Curtis |first5=L |title=Classification of normal corneal topography based on computer-assisted videokeratography |volume=108 |issue=7 |pages=945–9 |journal=Archives of ophthalmology |doi=10.1001/archopht.1990.01070090047037}}</ref> [[Corneal topography]] or computer-assisted videokeratography (CAVK)—a technique that produces an image map based on the refractive power of the cornea at many discrete points on its surface—shows that irregular astigmatism comes in various configurations. The 2 steep hemimeridians, 180° apart in regular astigmatism, may be separated by less than 180° (a situation called ''nonorthogonal''); and the 2 steep hemimeridians may be asymmetrically steep—that is, one may be significantly steeper than the other, as shown by a larger magnitude value. The continuation of corneal irregular astigmatism can be quantified in diopters (D) as the topographic disparity (the vectorial difference between the 2 opposite semimeridian values for magnitude and meridian) when displayed using a DAVD.<ref name="AlpinsIrregular">{{cite journal |pmid=9610446 |year=1998 |last1=Alpins |first1=NA |title=Treatment of irregular astigmatism |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=634–46 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref>

Unlike other astigmatism analysis approaches, the Alpins Method can independently analyze the 2 hemimeridians of irregular astigmatism. This capability assumes greater importance as refractive lasers gain the ability to treat discrete parts of the cornea.<ref name="AlpinsBoyd"/><ref name="Croes"/>

==Topography versus refraction==
The Alpins Method offers insight into a common situation where astigmatism as measured by refraction (the well-known test where various lenses are placed in front of the eye while the doctor asks, "Which is better, this or this?) differs from the astigmatism as measured by [[keratometer|keratometry]] and [[corneal topography]], tests considered more objective and quantitative. A refraction identifies the myopic or hyperopic correction, as well as the magnitude and axis of total astigmatic correction needed for clear vision. However, as with the patient shown in Figure 4, most people with astigmatism demonstrate differences in magnitude and axis between corneal topographic astigmatism (T) and refractive astigmatism (R).<ref name="AlpinsJan97"/> This difference can be quantified by calculating the vectorial difference between refractive and corneal astigmatism, and is known as the ocular residual astigmatism (ORA). Figure 4 demonstrates 3 different approaches (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C) to handling a patient who has such a discrepancy; that is, the surgeon can treat based 100% on the corneal topographic astigmatism (Figure 4A); 100% on the refractive astigmatism (Figure 4B); or at some point in between (Figure 4C).

[[Image:AlpinsFig4A.png|thumb|alt=Double-angle vector diagram (DAVD) shows a patient having a discrepancy between refractive astigmatism (R) and corneal topographic astigmatism (T).|'''Figure 4A'''. This DAVD shows a patient who has a discrepancy between refractive (R) and corneal topographic (T) astigmatism, and whose targeted treatment is based 100% on T. The vector between R and T is the ocular residual astigmatism (ORA)—the minimal amount of astigmatism that can remain in the optical system of this eye. The target refraction is the amount of refractive astigmatism remaining after treatment to eliminate topographic astigmatism—that is, the cornea would be spherical but the patient would have a remaining refractive astigmatism equal to the target refraction (and ORA) shown. The treatment is shown as a vector of equivalent magnitude to T, but 180° away from T on the DAVD (actual steepening treatment on the cornea would be 90° away).]]

[[Image:AlpinsFig4B.png|thumb|alt=Double-angle vector diagram (DAVD) shows a patient having a discrepancy between refractive astigmatism (R) and corneal topographic astigmatism (T).|'''Figure 4B'''. This DAVD shows the same patient as in Figure 4A, but with correction targeted 100% on refraction. The target topography is the corneal topographic astigmatism remaining after treatment to eliminate the refractive astigmatism. The treatment vector has an equivalent magnitude to R, but is 180° away from R on the DAVD (actual steepening treatment on the cornea would be 90° away).]]

[[Image:AlpinsFig4C.png|thumb|alt=Double-angle vector diagram (DAVD) shows a patient having a discrepancy between refractive astigmatism (R) and corneal topographic astigmatism (T).|'''Figure 4C'''. An intermediate TIA vector can be chosen between the boundaries of the topographic TIA vector and the refractive TIA vector. The relative proximity of the intersection to either the topographic or refractive end points (heavy dashed line) is determined by the emphasis of treatment required (total will equal 100%). Any TIA vector that achieves the minimum target astigmatism for the prevailing topographic and refractive parameters will terminate on the ORA line.]]

''(Abbreviations used in Figure 4: DAVD, double-angle vector diagram; ORA, ocular residual astigmatism; R, refractive astigmatism; T, corneal topographic astigmatism; TIA, target induced astigmatism.)''

Faced with a discrepancy between T and R as shown in the patient in Figure 4, most refractive surgeons would treat the patient's refractive (spectacle) astigmatism in the belief that reshaping the cornea to the patient's refractive preference will produce better visual results. However, Alpins has always contended that treating R may do nothing to alleviate T, and actually can result in increased corneal topographic astigmatism, violating fundamental principles of corneal surgery. Alpins therefore described an "optimal treatment," known as ''vector planning,'' where greater surgical emphasis is put on topographic astigmatism the more unfavorably the target astigmatism falls on the cornea—that is, toward an against-the-rule or even oblique orientation.<ref name="AlpinsJan97"/>

Additionally, in a small prospective study, Alpins and Stamatelatos recently showed that combining wavefront with vector planning provided better visual outcomes than using wavefront planning alone.<ref name="Alpins2008"/><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | pmid=18655955 |year=2008 |last1=Kohnen |first1=T |title=Reshaping the cornea: which laser profiles should we use? |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=1225 |journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery}}</ref>

==Alpins Method combined with wavefront technology==

A description of [[wavefront]] technology and its use in [[refractive surgery]] can be found in the listing for [[LASIK]], a type of refractive surgery. In the early 2000s, wavefront technology was seen as a possible "holy grail" that may provide "super vision" for refractive surgery patients.<ref name="Walsh2000A">Walsh MJ. Is the future of refractive surgery based on corneal topography or wavefront? “Ocular Surgery News”. August 1, 2000, page 26.</ref><ref name="Walsh2000">Walsh MJ. Wavefront is showing signs of success, but can it do it alone? ''Ocular Surgery News''.

May 2000, pages 64 and 65.</ref> In an invited 2002 editorial<ref name="Alpins2002Fail">{{cite journal |pmid=12458868 |year=2002 |last1=Alpins |first1=NA |title=Wavefront technology: A new advance that fails to answer old questions on corneal vs. Refractive astigmatism correction |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=737–9. |journal=Journal of refractive surgery}}</ref> titled "Wavefront Technology: A New Advance That Fails to Answer Old Questions on Corneal vs. Refractive Astigmatism Correction," Alpins was one of the first ophthalmologists to raise a cautionary note. In that publication and others he pointed out the importance of combining vector analysis, often overlooked at the time, with the then-standard use of corneal topography and optical/refractive measurements.<ref name="Walsh2000A"/><ref name="Walsh2000"/><ref name="EW2000"/><ref name="Alpins2002Fail" />

Alpins' observation was confirmed in a small, prospective, masked study of patients receiving LASIK (21 eyes in 14 patients), published in 2008.<ref name="Alpins2008" /> Alpins and Stamatelatos found a greater reduction in corneal astigmatism and better visual outcomes under [[mesopic vision|mesopic conditions]] using wavefront technology combined with vector analysis (the Alpins Method) than using wavefront technology alone, and also found equivalent [[LASIK|higher-order aberrations]].<ref name="Alpins2008" /><ref name="ReferenceA"/> Noting this study, other investigators have acknowledged that a combined approach will be "the treatment approach of the future."<ref name="Kugler">Kugler LJ, Wang M. Corneal topography: what will the upcoming decade bring? In: Wang M, ed. ''Corneal Topography: A Guide for Clinical Application in the Wavefront Era''. Thorofare, NJ: SLACK Incorporated;2012:259-262.</ref>

Alpins' contention is that the purely refraction-based approach represented by wavefront analysis may hold true for scientific instruments such as the [[Hubble space telescope]], but may not be true for the living eye-brain system, and may contradict corneal surgical experience developed over many years.<ref name="Alpins2002Fail"/> Refractive surgeons have long known that corneal regularity is the foundation of a superior visual outcome. If all corrections for internal optical errors are surgically sculpted onto the cornea, corneal irregularity can only increase.<ref name="Alpins2002Fail" /> Additionally, wavefront analysis does not take into account the cerebral integration of visual images. A surgical approach that includes the patients' conscious perception of their astigmatism is likely to enhance patient satisfaction.<ref name="Alpins2002Fail"/>

Alpins believes that the pathway to "supernormal vision" requires a greater customized reduction of corneal astigmatism than is usually attempted, and that any remaining astigmatism ought to be regular (as opposed to irregular), both fundamental principles of vector planning that are overlooked by a purely wavefront-guided treatment plan.<ref name="Alpins2002Fail"/>

No good data can be found that compare the percentage of LASIK procedures that employ wavefront guidance versus the percentage that do not, nor the percentage of refractive surgeons who have a preference one way or the other. Wavefront technology continues to be positioned as an "advance" in LASIK with putative advantages;<ref name="AAOGuide"/><ref name="AMO2012">Abbott Medical Optics website.

==The ASSORT program==
Alpins founded the company ASSORT Pty. Ltd.,<ref name="ASSORT" /> of Cheltenham, Victoria, Australia, to commercialize the Alpins astigmatism analysis methodology. The company offers:
* '''ASSORT'''—An ophthalmic surgical management system capable of analyzing all measurable ophthalmic parameters, such as [[intraocular pressure]]s and medications, visual acuities, and personalized A constants for cataract surgery. The ASSORT program also incorporates the Alpins Method for astigmatism surgery planning and analysis. Surgical techniques can be compared in differing patient groups, and pre- and postoperative events can be documented and analyzed.
* '''iASSORT'''—Performs astigmatic analyses using the topography and/or wavefront values provided by the diagnostic instrument into which the software has been installed. By selecting the review visits required, iASSORT<sup>®</sup> will import the required parameters (Sim Ks from topography and second-order astigmatism values from aberrometry) and display the analyses. The iASSORT program is used in most available [[corneal topography|corneal topographers]], and discussions are underway to enhance iASSORT by including a new corneal measurement called CorT,<ref name=EyeWorld2013>{{cite news|last=Ngoei|first=Enette|title=Refractive editor's corner of the world: CorT'ing accuracy|url=http://www.eyeworld.org/article-cort-ing-accuracy|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=EyeWorld|date=February 2013}}</ref> which is described in the next section.
* '''VECTrAK'''—A comprehensive, simple-to-use astigmatic vector calculator developed for ophthalmic surgeons for implanting/exporting multiple eyes after surgery. VECTrAK can determine astigmatic changes occurring following cataract, incisional, and laser surgical procedures.
* '''Online calculators'''—Free Web-based applications for toric IOL calculations<ref name=ASSORT-IOL>{{cite web|title=ASSORT TORIC IOL Calculator|url=http://www.assort.com/ASSORT-toric-calculator-intro.asp|work=ASSORT Web site|publisher=ASSORT Pty Ltd|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> and femto LRI (limbal relaxing incision) nomograms.<ref name=ASSORT-LRI>{{cite web|title=ASSORT Femto LRI Calculator|url=http://www.assort.com/ASSORT-femto-calculator-intro.asp|work=ASSORT Web site|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> The toric IOL calculator helps determine the most effective (or closest to plano) toric power to use among all available toric IOLs. The femto LRI calculator helps plan LRIs and determine nomogram adjustments.
==Use of CorT in Refractive and Cataract/IOL Surgery==
===The CorT concept===
Alpins et al have developed a vector analysis algorithm, which they call CorT, to quantify corneal topographic astigmatism. The authors compared CorT with manual keratometry, simulated keratometry (SimK), corneal wavefront, and paraxial curvature matching. CorT proved to be significantly more reliable (less variable with smaller standard deviation) than the other approaches (Figure 5). The magnitude of Ocular Residual Astigmatism (ORA) using CorT was the least and its magnitude was closest to refractive cylinder than all other parameters examined.<ref name=Alpins2012>{{cite journal|last=Alpins|first=Noel|coauthors=JK Ong, G Stamatelatos|title=New method of quantifying corneal topographic astigmatism that corresponds with manifest refractive cylinder|journal=Journal of cataract and refractive surgery|year=2012|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1978-1988|doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2012.07.026|pmid=23010252}}</ref>

[[File:Iris of eye overlain with 3 different measurments.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. The corneal topographic astigmatism (CorT) is closer in magnitude and orientation to the manifest refractive cylinder (R) than is simulated keratometry (Sim K), the latter of which has been the standard for 25 years.]]

The variability of SimK values has been a point of frustration in the field, most recently in regard to its meridian for the alignment of toric IOLs. Alpins expects that CorT will replace the SimK value, which has been the standard measure since the inception of [[Corneal topography#Development|Placido ring topography technology]].<ref name=Alpins2012 /><ref name=EyeWorld2013 /><ref name=Biro>{{cite news|last=Biro|first=A|title=New measurement method quantifies corneal astigmatism|url=http://www.healio.com/ophthalmology/refractive-surgery/news/print/ocular-surgery-news/%7B8437E8A7-A8C3-4020-AFA6-430EC5792B3F%7D/New-measurement-method-quantifies-corneal-astigmatism|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=Ocular surgery news. US edition.|date=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=EuroTimes>{{cite news|title=Getting more from topography|url=http://www.eurotimesindia.org/cover-news.asp?id=262|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=EuroTimes India|date=4 March 2013}}</ref>    

Unlike SimK, the CorT value uses measurements from the entire cornea and takes a vectorial average of Placido ring powers across the whole cornea—a novel approach and one that holds much promise. To obtain a CorT value, rather than using one Placido ring for calculating corneal astigmatism as is the case with SimK, the CorT measurement uses all Placido rings and takes a vectorial average across the entire cornea (and each of its hemidivisions) after determining the most effective set of complete rings. The authors are programming CorT into the iASSORT software, which is already used in many types of corneal topographers located in ophthalmology offices around the world.<ref name=EyeWorld2013 />

===CorT in refractive surgery===
The authors’ original description of CorT was based on a retrospective review of 971 eyes of 498 patients aged 19 to 64 years who were seen for refractive surgery assessment. CorT was compared with manual keratometry, SimK, corneal wavefront, and paraxial curvature matching. The standard deviation for CorT was significantly less than for the other measures of astigmatism (''P''<.001).<ref name=Alpins2012 /><ref name=Biro />

iASSORT imports topographic data (SimK values, at present) from topographers or second-order astigmatism values from aberrometers. The surgeon manually enters the sphero-cylinder as measured by manifest refraction or from wavefront aberrometry. From these parameters, the program calculates the ORA, which is a calculation of astigmatism due to noncorneal surface causes as noted above. The software also calculates how much total astigmatism potentially can be corrected by reshaping the cornea, as well as the power and axis of surgical correction required to achieve the maximum potential astigmatic correction.<ref name=EuroTimes />

This information can be used before surgery to help manage patient expectations. For 25% to 30% of patients with ORA values of 1.0 D or more, it may not be possible to achieve the degree of astigmatism correction they might expect, and patients can be counseled accordingly. Preoperative measures also are used to set a target for corneal astigmatism that minimizes total astigmatism after surgery. A target—which can be non-zero—is essential to analyze outcomes, as it provides a baseline for comparison in individuals and groups of individuals, and thus can be used to calibrate future adjustments.<ref name=EuroTimes />

===CorT in cataract/IOL surgery===
CorT can provide a reliable meridian (and magnitude) for the alignment (and power) of a toric IOL. The current standard practice amounts to estimating the meridian from multiple differing inputs (e.g., SimK, manual keratometry, IOL master keratometry, and Lenstar), which often differ in the meridian identified as “steepest.” CorT provides the most reliable orientation of the steep meridian and the most effective magnitude of the corneal astigmatism.<ref name=EyeWorld2013 /> 

CorT is also an accurate and reliable way of measuring irregular corneal astigmatism. CorT can provide measurements of the 2 semimeridians of the cornea, and a separate calculation for each half of the cornea, which generates a magnitude value and a meridian value for each half of the cornea. When these calculations are added vectorially, the result is a CorT for the entire cornea. When these values are subtracted vectorially, the surgeon can determine the dioptric difference of one half of the cornea from the other half (called topographic disparity, or TD). TD provides a common measurement tool, where all topographers can have a common measuring gauge for corneal irregularity.<ref name=EyeWorld2013 />

===iASSORT availability===
The iASSORT software is now interfaced with more than 10 brands of topographers. The first 4 that may contain CorT capability are expected to be the Humphrey Atlas (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany), Pentacam (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany), the Sirius Corneal Topographer (CSO, Scandicci, Italy), and the Galilei (Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems, Port, Switzerland).<ref name=EyeWorld2013 />
