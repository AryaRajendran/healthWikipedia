'''Craniopagus parasiticus''' is a rare type of [[Craniopagus]] occurring in about 4 to 6 of 10,000,000 births.<ref name="Journal of Clinical Neuroscience">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967586810002420 |title=Craniopagus parasiticus: A rare case |publisher=Journal of Clinical Neuroscience |date=2010-10 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref> In craniopagus parasiticus, a [[parasitic twin]] head with an undeveloped body is attached to the head of a developed twin. There are less than a dozen documented cases of this type of [[conjoined twin]] in the literature. Most infants with this condition are [[stillbirth|stillborn]], or die shortly after birth.

==Terminology==
In the past, the use of terminology when describing [[parasitic twins]] has been somewhat inconsistent. By definition a parasitic twin is joined to another twin in a certain anatomical location or position on the developed twin's body. The underdeveloped twin is termed the [[parasite]], and the developed twin is termed the [[autosite]]. The autosite may have some abnormalities as well, but for the most part it has developed enough to where it can live on its own.<ref name="Journal of Pediatric Surgery">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.clemson.edu/science/article/pii/S0022346810005579 |title=Heteropagus (parasitic) twins: a review |publisher=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |date=2010-10 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}</ref>

==History==
According to sources, there have only been ten cases of craniopagus parasiticus reported in the literature. Of those cases, only three have survived birth.<ref name="forteantimes1"></ref> The first case on record is that of Everard Home's twin-headed boy of Bengal, whose head is now being preserved at the Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow.

==Development==
The exact development of craniopagus parasiticus isn't well known. However, it is known that the underdeveloped twin is a [[parasitic twin]]. Parasitic twins are known to occur in utero when [[monozygotic twins]] start to develop as an embryo, but the embryo fails to completely split. When this happens one embryo will dominate development while the others' development is severely altered. The key difference between a [[parasitic twin]] and [[conjoined twins]] is that in parasitic twins, one twin, the [[parasite]], stops development during [[gestation]], while the other twin, the [[autosite]], develops completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_twin|title=Parasitic Twins |publisher=Wikipedia |date=2012-09-05 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref>

In normal [[monozygotic twin]] development, one embryo is fertilized by a single [[sperm]]. The egg will then completely split into two, normally at the two cell stage. If the egg splits in the early [[blastocyst]] stage two inner cell masses will be present, eventually leading to the twins sharing the same [[chorion]] and [[placenta]], but with separate [[amnion]]s. However, the egg can split into two, but still have one blastocyst. This will lead to one [[inner cell mass]] and one [[blastocyst]]. Then as the twins develop they will share the same [[placenta]], [[chorion]], and amnion.<ref name="Schoenwolf 2008">{{cite book | last=Schoenwolf |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Schoenwold |year=2008 |title=Larsen's Human Embryology, 4th Edition}}</ref> This is thought to be the most likely reason why [[conjoined twins]] occur,<ref name="Schoenwolf 2008"/> and could possibly play a role in the development of craniopagus parasiticus.

One hypothesis is that craniopagus parasiticus starts with the development of two fetuses from a single zygote that fail to separate at the head region around the second week of gestation.<ref name="Journal of Clinical Neuroscience"/> Some however believe it occurs later in development, around the fourth week of gestation. It is thought that the two embryos fuse together at the fourth week of gestation near the anterior open neuropore.<ref name="Journal of Clinical Neuroscience"/>

Another hypothesis is that there is joining of the somatic and placental vascular system of the twins and also a degeneration of the umbilical cord of the parasitic twin. This suggests that craniopagus parasiticus develops due to the lack of blood supply to one of the twins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evidence.unboundmedicine.com/evidence/ub/citation/9353833/Craniopagus_parasiticus:_a_case_illustrating_its_relationship_to_craniopagus_conjoined_twinning_ |title=Craniopagus parasiticus: a case illustrating its relationship to craniopagus conjoined twinning |publisher=MEDLINE Journals |year=1997 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}</ref> 

The condition also seems to be more predominant in males than females, with seven of the nine reported cases being male. With the number of cases being so small it is hard to say whether this data has any significance. However, it may provide some insight into the possibility of a genetic predisposition to the condition.

==Treatment==

With so few individuals actually surviving until birth, the only treatment option is surgery. During surgery the goal is to try to remove the parasitic twin. Surgery however is very dangerous and has only been successful once. The problem with surgical intervention is that the arterial supplies of the head are so intertwined that is very hard to control the bleeding, and it has been suggested that cutting off the parasitic twin's arterial supply might improve the odds of the developed twin's survival.<ref name="Journal of Clinical Neuroscience"/>

==Cases==
There have only been ten documented cases of craniopagus parasiticus (though to-date at least eighty cases of craniopagus have been written about in various records.)<ref name="forteantimes1">{{cite web|last=Bondeson |first=Jan |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/148/the_twoheaded_boy_of_bengal.html |title=The Two-Headed Boy of Bengal &#124; Articles &#124; Features &#124; Fortean Times UK |publisher=Forteantimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> Only three have been documented by modern medicine to have survived birth. 
*On December 10, 2003, Rebeca Martínez was born in the [[Dominican Republic]] with this rare condition. She was the first baby born with the condition to undergo an operation to remove the second head. She died on February 7, 2004, after an 11-hour operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/04/health/main597954.shtml |title=Two-Headed Baby Dies After Surgery |publisher=CBS News |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>
*On February 19, 2005, 10-month-old Manar Maged underwent a successful 13-hour surgery in [[Egypt]]. The under developed conjoined twin, Islaam, was attached to Manar's head and was facing upward. Islaam could smile and even blink, but doctors determined she had to be removed, and that she couldn't survive on her own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/4848164.stm |title=In Depth &#124; Two-head girl dies of infection |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-03-26 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> Manar was featured on an episode of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and in the British documentary series [[Body Shock]]. Manar died fourteen months after the surgery, just days before her second birthday, due to a severe infection in her brain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://multiples.about.com/b/2006/03/26/manar-maged-dies-from-brain-infection.htm |title=Manar Maged Dies From Brain Infection |publisher=Multiples.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>
*An earlier case was the so-called "Two-Headed Boy of Bengal," who was born in 1783 and died of a [[cobra]] bite in 1787. His skull remains in the collection of the [[Hunterian Museum]] of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of London]].<ref name="forteantimes1"/>

== Related conditions ==

In addition to craniopagus parasiticus, there are a few other conditions involving a child, or animal, being born with two heads or faces. These conditions, which all fall under the [[congenital]] [[cephalic]] [[disorder]] category,  are commonly mistaken as craniopagus parasiticus, and sometimes the terms are used improperly. Two common mix ups with craniopagus parasiticus include [[Polycephaly]] and [[Diprosopus]].

===Polycephaly===

[[Polycephaly]] is a condition where an organism possesses a single body, but has multiple heads. This is different from craniopagus parasiticus in that the extra head, or heads, is not a parasite. Both heads can share the common body equally, or can even have separate spinal cords, brains, and hearts.

===Diprosopus===
[[Diprosopus]] occurs when a single body and neck are present, but there is a duplication of the structures of the face. This is different from craniopagus parasiticus in that there is only one head, although there is a duplication of the [[craniofacial]] features. [[Diprosopus]] can range from having two fully formed faces to just a duplication of the nose or eyes.
