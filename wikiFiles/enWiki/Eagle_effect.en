things to add:
* History - the meaning has changed over time
* Implications for antimicrobial use - textbook chapters suggest consideration of the Eagle effect when prescribing for severe infections; this will not be how-to, but just a neutral summary of medrs
* Controversy - the clinical implications are not universally accepted

==Mechanism==

Proposed mechanisms:<!-- this list will need to be refactored as prose -->
*Reduced expression of [[penicillin binding proteins]] during stationary growth phase<ref name=pollard2004>{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=Andrew J.|coauthors=McCracken, George H.;Finn, Adam|title=Hot Topics in Infection and Immunity in Children|year=2004|publisher=Springer|page=187|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MDFQ-zDSq8cC&pg=PA187&dq=eagle+effect+antibiotic#v=onepage&q=eagle%20effect%20antibiotic&f=false|isbn=9780306483448}}</ref> 
*Induction of microbial resistance mechanisms (such as beta lactamases with short half-lives) by high drug concentrations<ref name=ikeda1990>{{cite journal|last=Ikeda|first=Y|coauthors=Fukuoka, Y; Motomura, K; Yasuda, T; Nishino, T|title=Paradoxical activity of beta-lactam antibiotics against Proteus vulgaris in experimental infection in mice|journal=Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy|date=1990 Jan|volume=34|issue=1|pages=94–7|pmid=2183712|doi=10.1128/AAC.34.1.94|pmc=171526}}</ref> 
*Precipitation of antimicrobial drug in vitro,<ref name=eagle1948/> possibly also leading to the crystallized drug being mis-detected as colonies of the microbe.
*Self-[[Receptor antagonist|antagonising]] the receptor with which it binds ([[penicillin]] binding proteins, for example, in the case of a penicillin).<ref>''Pharmaceutical Microbiology'', pg188, 7th Edition, Denyer, Hodges, Gorman</ref>
