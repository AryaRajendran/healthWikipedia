'''Dyskaryosis''' of the uterine [[cervix]] is a condition in which some of the [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells near the [[External orifice of the uterus|external orifice ]] show abnormalities in their cellular nuclei.

These changes are often quite subtle, and are often seen as temporary changes in girls between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five. Apparent dyskaryosis in girls below the age of twenty-five is not regarded as significant, and accordingly in most countries where a [[Pap test|cervical screening]] programme exists, the age of entry into the programme is twenty-five. The programme terminates at the age of sixty-five, assuming no abnormal smears in the previous ten years.

Cervical dyskaryosis is classified into three degrees of severity -  mild, moderate and severe. A further category is used to define cells that do not show significant nuclear abnormality, to be defined as dyskaryotic. This category is termed "borderline changes". While any dyskaryotic cervix might develop malignant change, so all must be followed up, the risk is increasingly high with higher grades of dyskaryosis. Most borderline changes will resolve spontaneously, as will many mild ones. Moderate and severe changes are usually treated, by [[electrocautery]], [[cryocautery]] or [[loop excision]], with the objective of completely removing the abnormal area.

Dyskaryosis is caused by an infection with [[Human Papilloma Virus]] (HPV), which exists in a number of different strains; type 16 and type 18 cause dyskaryosis more readily than do other types.<ref>Clinical Evidence Concise, BMJ Publications</ref> These viruses are nearly always [[sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted]]. [[HPV vaccine|Immunization]], which is now available against HPV 16 and 18, will prevent further infection by these strains. But if infection has occurred before immunization, and cellular change has already occurred, the vaccine does not reduce the risk of developing dyskaryotic change.

Dyskaryosis ,means abnormal nucleus and refere to the abnormal epithelial cell which may be found in cervical sample.It is graded from low to high grade based  on degree of abnormality.all these changes are treatable with no recurrence
