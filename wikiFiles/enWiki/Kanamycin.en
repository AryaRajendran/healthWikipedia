'''Kanamycin''' (also known as '''kanamycin A''') is an [[aminoglycoside]] [[bacteriocidal]] [[antibiotic]], available in [[Wiktionary:oral|oral]], [[intravenous]], and intramuscular forms, and used to treat a wide variety of [[infection]]s. Kanamycin is isolated from the bacterium ''[[Streptomyces kanamyceticus]]''<ref>Garrod, L.P., et al.: "Antibiotic and Chemotherapy", page 131. Churchill Livingstone, 1981</ref> and its most commonly used form is kanamycin [[sulfate]].

==Mechanism==

Kanamycin interacts with the [[30S]] subunit of [[prokaryotic]] [[ribosomes]]. It induces substantial amounts of mistranslation and indirectly inhibits translocation during [[protein synthesis]].<ref>Pestka, S.: "The Use of Inhibitors in Studies on Protein Synthesis", Methods in Enzymology 30, pp.261-282, 1975</ref><ref>Misumi, M. & Tanaka, N.: "Mechanism of Inhibition of Translocation by Kanamycin and Viomycin: A Comparative Study with Fusidic Acid, Biochem.Biophys.Res.Commun. 92, pp.647-654, 1980</ref>

==Side effects==

Serious [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s include tinnitus or loss of hearing, [[toxicity to kidneys]], and [[allergic]] reactions to the [[medication|drug]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Consumer Drug Information: Kanamycin | date = 2 April 2008 | url = http://www.drugs.com/cdi/kanamycin.html | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}</ref>

==Use in research==

Kanamycin is used in molecular biology as a selective agent most commonly to isolate [[bacteria]] (e.g., ''[[E. coli]]'') which have taken up genes (e.g., of [[plasmid]]s) coupled to a gene coding for kanamycin resistance (primarily Neomycin phosphotransferase II [NPT II/Neo]). Bacteria that have been [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] with a plasmid containing the kanamycin resistance gene are plated on kanamycin (50-100&nbsp;ug/ml) containing [[agar]] plates or are grown in media containing kanamycin (50-100&nbsp;ug/ml). Only the bacteria that have successfully taken up the kanamycin resistance gene become resistant and will grow under these conditions. As a powder kanamycin is white to off-white and is soluble in water (50&nbsp;mg/ml). 

Mammalian cells and other [[eukaryote]]s are screened using [[Geneticin|G418]], a similar aminoglycoside antibiotic, which KanMX confers resistance against.

At least one such gene, ''Atwbc19''<ref>[http://www.isb.vt.edu/articles/oct0501.htm Horizontal Gene Transfer: Plant vs. Bacterial Genes for Antibiotic Resistance Scenario'sâ€”What's the Difference?]</ref> is native to a plant species, of comparatively large size and its coded protein acts in a manner which decreases the possibility of [[horizontal gene transfer]] from the plant to bacteria; it may be incapable of giving resistance to kanamycin to bacteria even if gene transfer occurs.
