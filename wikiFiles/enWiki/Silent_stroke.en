A '''silent stroke''' is a [[stroke]] that does not have any outward symptoms, and the patient is typically unaware they have suffered a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms a silent stroke still causes damage to the brain, and places the patient at increased risk for both [[transient ischemic attack]] and major stroke in the future.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20453400 |year=2010 |last1=Miwa |first1=K |last2=Hoshi |first2=T |last3=Hougaku |first3=H|title=Silent cerebral infarction is associated with incident stroke and TIA independent of carotid intima-media thickness |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=817–22 |journal=Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan) |doi=10.2169/internalmedicine.49.3211}}</ref> In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced a stroke in the United States.

These types of strokes include lacunar and other ischemic strokes and minor hemorrhages. They may also include [[leukoaraiosis]] (changes in the [[white matter]] of the brain): the white matter is more susceptible to vascular blockage due to reduced amount of blood vessels as compared to the [[cerebral cortex]]. These strokes are termed "silent" because they typically affect "silent" regions of the brain that do not cause a noticeable change in an afflicted person’s motor functions such as contralateral paralysis, [[Dysarthria|slurred speech]], pain, or an alteration in the sense of touch. A silent stroke typically affects regions of the brain associated with various thought processes, mood regulation and cognitive functions and is a leading cause of [[vascular cognitive impairment]] and may also lead to a loss of [[urinary bladder]] control.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15191706 |year=2004 |last1=Yatsu |first1=FM |last2=Shaltoni |first2=HM |title=Implications of silent strokes |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=307–13 |journal=Current atherosclerosis reports |doi=10.1007/s11883-004-0063-0}}</ref><ref name="Pmid_a">{{cite journal |pmid=15209640 |year=2004 |last1=Schmidt |first1=WP |last2=Roesler |first2=A |last3=Kretzschmar |first3=K |last4=Ladwig |first4=KH |last5=Junker |first5=R |last6=Berger |first6=K |title=Functional and cognitive consequences of silent stroke discovered using brain magnetic resonance imaging in an elderly population |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=1045–50 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52300.x |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society}}</ref>

In the Cardiovascular Health Study, a population study conducted among 3,660 adults over the age of 65, 31% showed evidence of silent stroke in neuroimaging studies utilizing [[MRI]]. These individuals were unaware they had suffered a stroke. It is estimated that silent strokes are five times more common than symptomatic stroke.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1669507 |year=1991 |last1=Fried |first1=LP |last2=Borhani |first2=NO |last3=Enright |first3=P |last4=Furberg |first4=CD |last5=Gardin |first5=JM |last6=Kronmal |first6=RA |last7=Kuller |first7=LH |last8=Manolio |first8=TA |last9=Mittelmark |first9=MB |title=The Cardiovascular Health Study: Design and rationale |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=263–76 |journal=Annals of epidemiology |doi=10.1016/1047-2797(91)90005-W}}</ref>

A silent stroke differs from a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In TIA symptoms of stroke are exhibited which may last from a few minutes to 24 hours before resolving. A TIA is a risk factor for having a major stroke and subsequent silent strokes in the future.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16116107 |year=2005 |last1=Coutts |first1=SB |last2=Hill |first2=MD |last3=Simon |first3=JE |last4=Sohn |first4=CH |last5=Scott |first5=JN |last6=Demchuk |first6=AM |last7=Vision Study |first7=Group |title=Silent ischemia in minor stroke and TIA patients identified on MR imaging |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=513–7 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000169031.39264.ff |journal=Neurology}}</ref>

==Types of silent stroke==
*[[Ischemic stroke]]: occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain becomes blocked. This type of stroke accounts for approximately 87 percent of all stroke cases.
*[[Hemorrhagic stroke]]: occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain becomes weakened and ruptures. Typically hemorrhagic stroke is caused by two types of weakened blood vessel: [[aneurysm]]s and [[arteriovenous malformation]]s (AVMs).
*[[Lacunar stroke|Lacunar infarcts]] (LACI) are small (0.2 to 15&nbsp;mm in diameter) noncortical (does not affect [[cerebral cortex]]) infarcts caused by the occlusion of a single penetrating branch of a larger blood vessel that provides blood to the brain's deep structures including the  white matter. LACIs are strongly associated with the development of white matter lesions (WML) which can be detected via the use of [[computerized tomography]] (CT scans).<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8929172 |year=1996 |last1=Van Zagten |first1=M |last2=Boiten |first2=J |last3=Kessels |first3=F |last4=Lodder |first4=J |title=Significant progression of white matter lesions and small deep (lacunar) infarcts in patients with stroke |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=650–5 |journal=Archives of neurology |doi=10.1001/archneur.1996.00550070088015}}</ref>

==Risk factors==
There are various individual risk factors associated with having a silent stroke. Many of these risk factors are the same as those associated with having a major symptomatic stroke.
*[[Acrolein]]:elevated levels of acrolein, a toxic [[metabolite]] produced from the [[polyamines]] [[spermine]], [[spermidine]] and by [[amine oxidase]] serve as a marker for silent stroke, when elevated in conjunction with C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 the confidence levels in predicting a silent stroke risk increase.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21318888 |year=2011 |last1=Igarashi |first1=K |last2=Kashiwagi |first2=K |title=Use of polyamine metabolites as markers for stroke and renal failure |volume=720 |pages=395–408 |doi=10.1007/978-1-61779-034-8_25 |journal=Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.) |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |isbn=978-1-61779-033-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16269634 |year=2005 |last1=Tomitori |first1=H |last2=Usui |first2=T |last3=Saeki |first3=N |last4=Ueda |first4=S |last5=Kase |first5=H |last6=Nishimura |first6=K |last7=Kashiwagi |first7=K |last8=Igarashi |first8=K |title=Polyamine oxidase and acrolein as novel biochemical markers for diagnosis of cerebral stroke |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=2609–13 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000190004.36793.2d |journal=Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation}}</ref>

*[[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) and [[Interleukin 6]] (IL6): C-reactive protein is one of the plasma proteins known as  [[acute phase protein]]s (proteins whose [[Blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations increase (or decrease) by 25% or more during inflammatory disorders) which is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises in response to inflammation in various parts of the body including vascular inflammation. The level of CRP can rise as high as 1000-fold in response to inflammation.

=== In children ===
Children who have suffered silent strokes often have a variety of neuropsychological deficits,<ref>Sam Goldstein, Cecil R. Reynolds: Handbook of Neurodevelopmental and Genetic Disorders in Children p.105 (2010) ISBN 1-60623-990-2</ref> these deficits may include lowered I.Q., learning disabilities and an inability to focus.

Silent strokes are the most common form of neurologic injury in children with sickle cell anemia, who may develop subtle neurocognitive deficits in the areas of attention and concentration, [[executive function]], and visual-motor speed and coordination due to silent strokes which may not have been necessarily detected on physical examination.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11883668 | volume=11 | issue=4 | title=Neuropsychological aspects of pediatric sickle cell disease | year=2001 | month=December | author=Kral MC, Brown RT, Hynd GW | journal=Neuropsychol Rev | pages=179–96}}</ref>

===Link to depression===
Major depression is a risk factor and also a consequence of silent brain infarction (SBI). Persons who present with symptoms of presenile and senile major depression showed a markedly higher incidence of SBI (65.9% and 93.7%). Individuals with major depression who have had an SBI present with more marked neurological deficits and more severe depressive symptoms than do those without SBI.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8160223 |year=1994 |last1=Fujikawa |first1=T |last2=Yamawaki |first2=S |last3=Touhouda |first3=Y |title=Background factors and clinical symptoms of major depression with silent cerebral infarction |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=798–801 |journal=Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation |doi=10.1161/01.STR.25.4.798}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of a silent stroke is usually made as an [[incidental findings|incidental finding]] (by chance) of various neuroimaging techniques. Silent strokes may be detected by:
*[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI)<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9183343 |year=1997 |last1=Price |first1=TR |last2=Manolio |first2=TA |last3=Kronmal |first3=RA |last4=Kittner |first4=SJ |last5=Yue |first5=NC |last6=Robbins |first6=J |last7=Anton-Culver |first7=H |last8=O'Leary |first8=DH |title=Silent brain infarction on magnetic resonance imaging and neurological abnormalities in community-dwelling older adults.

*[[Transcranial Doppler]] [[ultrasonography]] (TCD), which measures cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the large intracranial arteries in the brain, has been shown in various studies to be an effective tool to diagnose children with sickle cell anemia at increased risk of having an initial or recurrent silent stroke. The narrowing of these arteries which is a risk factor for cerebral infarction, is characterized by an increased velocity of blood flow.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1734251 |year=1992 |last1=Adams |first1=R |last2=McKie |first2=V |last3=Nichols |first3=F |last4=Carl |first4=E |last5=Zhang |first5=DL |last6=McKie |first6=K |last7=Figueroa |first7=R |last8=Litaker |first8=M |last9=Thompson |first9=W |title=The use of transcranial ultrasonography to predict stroke in sickle cell disease |volume=326 |issue=9 |pages=605–10 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199202273260905 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine}}</ref>

==Prevention==
''See main article:[[Stroke#Prevention|Stroke prevention]]''

Preventive measures that can be taken to avoid sustaining a silent stroke for the general public are the same as for stroke. [[Smoking cessation]] is the most immediate step that can be taken with the effective management of hypertension the major medically treatable factor.

===In children with sickle cell anemia===
[[Transfusion therapy (Sickle-cell disease)|Transfusion therapy]] lowers the risk for a new silent stroke in children who have both abnormal [[Cerebral arteries|cerebral artery]] [[cerebral blood flow|blood flow velocity]] as detected by [[Transcranial Doppler]] and previous silent infarct even when the initial MRI showed no abnormality. A finding of elevated TCD ultrasonographic velocity warrants MRI of the brain  as those with both abnormalities who are not provided transfusion therapy are at higher risk for developing a new silent infarct or stroke than are those whose initial MRI showed no abnormality. In children with elevated TCD ultrasonographic velocity an additional MRI of the brain is warranted despite the initial normal findings.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11735775 |year=2001 |last1=Pegelow |first1=CH |last2=Wang |first2=W |last3=Granger |first3=S |last4=Hsu |first4=LL |last5=Vichinsky |first5=E |last6=Moser |first6=FG |last7=Bello |first7=J |last8=Zimmerman |first8=RA |last9=Adams |first9=RJ |title=Silent infarcts in children with sickle cell anemia and abnormal cerebral artery velocity |volume=58 |issue=12 |pages=2017–21 |journal=Archives of neurology |doi=10.1001/archneur.58.12.2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16861341 |year=2006 |last1=Lee |first1=MT |last2=Piomelli |first2=S |last3=Granger |first3=S |last4=Miller |first4=ST |last5=Harkness |first5=S |last6=Brambilla |first6=DJ |last7=Adams |first7=RJ |last8=Stop Study |first8=Investigators |title=Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP): Extended follow-up and final results |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=847–52 |doi=10.1182/blood-2005-10-009506 |pmc=1895848 |journal=Blood}}</ref>
