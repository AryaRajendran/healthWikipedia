'''''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7''' is an [[enterohemorrhagic]] [[strain (biology)|strain]] of the [[bacteria|bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and a cause of illness through food.<ref name=Karch_2005>{{cite journal|author=Karch H, Tarr P, Bielaszewska M|title=Enterohaemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'' in human medicine.|journal=Int J Med Microbiol|volume=295|issue=6–7|pages=405–18|year=2005|pmid=16238016|doi=10.1016/j.ijmm.2005.06.009}}</ref> Infection may lead to hemorrhagic [[diarrhea]], and to [[kidney]] failure.

Transmission is via the [[fecal-oral route]], and most illness has been through undercooked, contaminated [[beef|ground beef]] or [[pork|ground pork]] being eaten.

==Bacteriology==
[[Image:E. Coli 0157.jpg|thumb|450px|''E. coli'' O157:H7]]
''E. coli'' [[serotype]] O157:H7 is a [[Gram-negative]], rod-shaped bacterium. The "O" in the name refers to the cell wall ([[somatic antigen|somatic]]) antigen number, whereas the "H" refers to the [[flagellum|flagella]] antigen. Other serotypes may also  cause illness, though usually less severe. Other bacteria may be classified by "K" or capsular antigens. (The "O" stands for ''{{lang|de|ohne Hauch}}'' [Ger. "without huff" or "without film"]; "H" for ''Hauch''; and "K" for ''{{lang|de|Kapsel}}''.<ref>See [[:de:Kauffmann-White-Schema|Kauffmann-White-Schema]] in the German Wikipedia.</ref><ref>[http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/one/000006108.htm O antigen] at Dorlands Medical Dictionary.</ref>) 

This is one of hundreds of serotypes of the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. While most strains are harmless and normally found in the intestines of mammals, this strain may produce [[shiga-like toxin]]s and cause severe illness,  and is a member of a class of pathogenic ''E. coli'' known as enterohemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'' or EHEC. Often they are referred to by their toxin producing capabilities, verocytotoxin producing ''E. coli'' (VTEC) or [[Shiga-like toxin-producing Escherichia coli|Shiga-like toxin producing ''E. coli'']] (STEC).

''E. coli'' O157:H7 was first recognized as a pathogen as a result of an outbreak of unusual gastrointestinal illness in 1982. The outbreak was traced to contaminated [[hamburger]]s, and the illness was similar to other incidents in the United States and Japan. The etiologic agent of the illness was identified as a rare O157:H7 serotype of ''E. coli'' in 1983. This serotype had only been isolated once before, from a sick patient in 1975.<ref name=Riley_1983>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM198303243081203|author=Riley L, Remis R, Helgerson S, McGee H, Wells J, Davis B, Hebert R, Olcott E, Johnson L, Hargrett N, Blake P, Cohen M|title=Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare ''Escherichia coli'' serotype|journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] |volume=308|issue=12|pages=681–5|year=1983|pmid=6338386}}</ref>

''E. coli'' O157:H7 is markedly different from other pathogenic ''E. coli'', as well. In particular, the O157:H7 serotype is negative for invasiveness ([[Sereny test]]), adheres through the ''E. coli'' common pilus (ECP),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rendón|first=M. A.|authorlink=|year=2007|month=|title=Commensal and pathogenic Escherichia coli use a common pilus adherence factor for epithelial cell colonization|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]|volume=104|issue=25|pages=10637–10642|doi=10.1073/pnas.0704104104|url=|accessdate=|quote=|pmid=17563352|pmc=1890562|display-authors=1|last2=Saldana|first2=Z.|last3=Erdem|first3=A.

In addition, ''E. coli'' O157:H7 is usually [[sorbitol]] negative, whereas 93% of all ''E. coli'' with human origin ferment sorbitol.<ref name=wells_1983_101>{{cite journal|author=Wells JG|title=Laboratory investigation of hemorrhagic colitis outbreaks associated with a rare Escherichia coli serotype|journal=Journal of clinical microbiology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=512–20|year=1983|month=September|pmid=6355145|pmc=270845|doi=|url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6355145|author-separator=,|author2=Davis BR|author3=Wachsmuth IK|display-authors=3|last4=Riley|first4=LW|last5=Remis|first5=RS|last6=Sokolow|first6=R|last7=Morris|first7=GK}}</ref> ''E. coli'' O157:H7 also lacks the ability to hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucuronide (MUG)<ref name=Doyl_1984_24/> and does not grow at 45 °C in the presence of 0.15% [[bile salts]].

''E. coli'' O157:H7 serotypes are closely related, descended from a common ancestor, divergent in [[plasmid]] content more than chromosomal content, and are no more related to other [[shiga toxin]] producing strains than any other randomly chosen ''E. coli'' serotype. ''E. coli'' O55:H7 and ''E. coli'' O157:H7 are most closely related and diverged from a common pathogenic ancestor that possessed the ability to form attaching and effacing lesions. ''E. coli'' O157:H7 serotypes apparently arose as a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]] of virulence factors.<ref name=Whittam_1988_102>{{cite journal|author=Whittam TS, Wachsmuth IK, Wilson RA|title=Genetic evidence of clonal descent of Escherichia coli O157:H7 associated with hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome|journal=The Journal of infectious diseases|volume=157|issue=6|pages=1124–33|year=1988|month=June|pmid=3286782|doi=10.1093/infdis/157.6.1124|url=}}</ref>

Among these virulence factors are a periplasmic catalase and [[Shiga toxin|shiga-like toxins]]. Shiga-like toxins are iron-regulated toxins that catalytically inactivate [[60S]] ribosomal subunits of eukaryotic cells, blocking [[mRNA]] translation and causing cell death.<ref name=reisberg_1981_72>{{cite journal|author=Reisbig R, Olsnes S, Eiklid K|title=The cytotoxic activity of Shigella toxin. Evidence for catalytic inactivation of the 60 S ribosomal subunit|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=256|issue=16|pages=8739–44|year=1981|month=August|pmid=6894922|doi=|url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6894922}}</ref>
Shiga-like toxins are functionally identical to toxins produced by virulent ''[[Shigella]]'' species.<ref name=Calderwood_1987_12>{{cite journal|author=Calderwood SB, Auclair F, Donohue-Rolfe A, Keusch GT, Mekalanos JJ|title=Nucleotide sequence of the Shiga-like toxin genes of Escherichia coli|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=84|issue=13|pages=4364–8|year=1987|month=July|pmid=3299365|pmc=305089|doi= 10.1073/pnas.84.13.4364|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3299365}}</ref>

Strains of ''E. coli'' that express shiga-like toxins gained this ability due to [[transduction (genetics)|infection with a prophage]] containing the structural coding for the toxin, and nonproducing strains may become infected and produce shiga-like toxins after incubation with shiga toxin positive strains. The [[prophage]] responsible seems to have infected the strain's ancestors fairly recently, as viral particles have been observed to replicate in the host if it is stressed in some way (e.g. antibiotics).<ref name=O'Brien_1984_65>{{cite journal|author=O'Brien AD, Newland JW, Miller SF, Holmes RK, Smith HW, Formal SB|title=Shiga-like toxin-converting phages from Escherichia coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis or infantile diarrhea|journal=Science|volume=226|issue=4675|pages=694–6|year=1984|month=November|pmid=6387911|doi=10.1126/science.6387911|url=}}</ref><ref name=Strockbine_1986_91>{{cite journal|author=Strockbine NA, Marques LR, Newland JW, Smith HW, Holmes RK, O'Brien AD|title=Two toxin-converting phages from Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain 933 encode antigenically distinct toxins with similar biologic activities|journal=Infection and immunity|volume=53|issue=1|pages=135–40|year=1986|month=July|pmid=3522426|pmc=260087|doi=|url=http://iai.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3522426}}</ref>
The periplasmic catalase is encoded on the [[pO157]] plasmid, and is believed to be involved in virulence by providing additional oxidative protection when infecting the host.<ref name=Brunder_1996_11>{{cite journal|author=Brunder W, Schmidt H, Karch H|title=KatP, a novel catalase-peroxidase encoded by the large plasmid of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7|journal=Microbiology (Reading, England)|volume=142|issue=11|pages=3305–15|year=1996|month=November|pmid=8969527|doi=|url=}}</ref>

==Natural habitat==

While relatively uncommon, ''E. coli'' O157:H7 can naturally be found in the intestinal contents of some cattle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2571/Escherichia-coli.html|title=Escherichia coli|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}</ref> Cattle lack the shiga toxin receptor, [[Globotriaosylceramide]], and therefore can be asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium.<ref name="pmid10973498">{{cite journal |author=Pruimboom-Brees IM, Morgan TW, Ackermann MR, Nystrom ED, Samuel JE, Cornick

==Transmission==
Infection with ''E. coli'' O157:H7 follows ingestion of contaminated food or water, or oral contact with contaminated surfaces. It is highly [[virulence|virulent]], with a low [[infectious dose]]: an inoculation of fewer than 10 to 100 [[colony-forming unit|CFU]] of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 is sufficient to cause infection, compared to over one-million CFU for other pathogenic ''E. coli'' strains.<ref>J.D. Greig, E.C.D. Todd, C. Bartleson, and B. Michaels. March 25, 2010. "[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Atlanta2010/Slides_FSEC_JGreig_Doses.pdf Infective Doses and Pathen Carriage]", pp. 19-20, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] ''2010 Food Safety Education Conference''.</ref>

A main source of infection is undercooked ground beef; other sources include consumption of unpasteurized milk and juice, raw produce and [[salami]], and contact with infected live animals.
Waterborne transmission occurs through swimming in contaminated lakes, pools, or drinking inadequately treated water. The organism is easily transmitted from person to person and has been difficult to control in child day-care centers.

''E. coli'' O157:H7 is found on cattle farms and can live in the intestines of healthy cattle. The toxin requires highly specific [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on the cells' surface in order to attach and enter the cell; species such as [[cattle]], [[swine]], and [[deer]] which do not carry these receptors may harbor toxigenic bacteria without any ill effect, shedding them in their feces, from which they may be spread to humans. Some cattle may also be so-called 'super-shedders' of the bacterium. Super-shedders may be defined as cattle exhibiting rectoanal junction colonization and excreting >10<sup>3 to 4</sup> CFU g<sup>−1</sup> feces. Super-shedders have been found to constitute a small proportion of the cattle in a feedlot (<10%) but they may account for >90% of all ''E. coli'' O157:H7 excreted.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chase-Topping|first=M|coauthors=Gally D, Low C, Matthews L, Woolhouse M|title=Super-shedding and the link between human infection and livestock carriage of Escherichia coli O157|journal=Nat Rev Microbiol|year=2008|volume=6|issue=12|page=904|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2029|pmid=19008890|accessdate=21 February 2013}}</ref> 

Carcasses and hides can become contaminated during slaughter and butchering, and organisms can be thoroughly mixed into beef when it is ground into hamburger. Bacteria present on the cow's [[udder]]s or on equipment may get into raw milk. Contaminated foods look, smell, and taste the same as their normal counterparts.

Another potential vector of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 is filth flies (which includes [[house flies]], ''[[Musca domestica]]''). Filth flies have been shown to be vectors of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 using [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brazil |first=S. M. |first2=C. D. |last2=Steelman |first3=A.

United States food advocates have unsuccessfully attempted to control the spread of this illness by promoting the so-called "[[Kevin's law|Kevin's Law]]". This law would give the United States [[Department of Agriculture]] power to shut down food processing plants that fail multiple inspections. The food processing industry vigorously opposes this proposal.<ref>[[Food Inc.]] Directed by Robert Kenner, Independent Films 2009</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
''E. coli'' O157:H7 infection often causes severe, acute hemorrhagic diarrhea (although nonhemorrhagic diarrhea is also possible) and abdominal [[cramp]]s. Usually little or no [[pyrexia|fever]] is present, and the illness resolves in five to 10 days. It can also be [[asymptomatic]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In some people, particularly children under five years of age and the elderly, the infection can cause [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]] (HUS), in which the [[red blood cell]]s are destroyed and the kidneys fail. About 2–7% of infections lead to this complication. In the United States, HUS is the principal cause of [[acute kidney failure]] in children, and most cases of HUS are caused by ''E. coli'' O157:H7.

==Diagnosis==
A [[stool test|stool culture]] can detect the bacterium, although it is not a routine test and so must be specifically requested. The sample is cultured on [[sorbitol-MacConkey agar|sorbitol-MacConkey]] (SMAC) [[agar]], or the variant cefixime potassium tellurite sorbitol-MacConkey agar ([http://www.solabia.com/solabia/produitsDiagnostic.nsf/0/27DFE62DDA44AF3AC12574C7003A6377/$file/TDS_BK147_v5.pdf CT-SMAC]). On SMAC agar O157 colonies appear clear due to their inability to ferment sorbitol, while the colonies of the usual sorbitol-fermenting serotypes of ''E. coli'' appear red. Sorbitol nonfermenting colonies are tested for the somatic O157 antigen before being confirmed as ''E. coli'' O157. Like all cultures, diagnosis is time-consuming with this method; swifter diagnosis is possible using [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] techniques. Newer technologies using [[fluorescent]] and [[antibody]] detection are also under development.

===Surveillance===
''E. coli'' O157:H7 infection is nationally reportable in the USA and Great Britain, and is reportable in most US states.

==Treatment==
While fluid replacement and blood pressure support may be necessary to prevent death from dehydration, most victims recover without treatment in five to 10 days. There is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of disease, and treatment with [[antibiotic]]s may precipitate kidney complications.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Walterspiel JN, Ashkenazi S, Morrow AL, Cleary TG|title=Effect of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on extracellular Shiga-like toxin I|journal=Infection|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25–9|year=1992|pmid=1563808|doi=10.1007/BF01704889|url=}}</ref> Antidiarrheal agents, such as [[loperamide]] (imodium), should also be avoided as they may prolong the duration of the infection.

[[Hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] is a life-threatening condition usually treated in an [[intensive care unit]]. [[Blood transfusion]]s and [[kidney dialysis]] are often required. With intensive care, the death rate for hemolytic uremic syndrome is 3–5%.

Certain novel treatment strategies, such as the use of anti-induction strategies to prevent toxin production<ref>{{cite doi|10.3389/fcimb.2012.00161}}</ref> and the use of anti-Shiga toxin antibodies,<ref>[[doi: 10.1128/CMR.17.4.926-941.2004]]</ref> have also been proposed.

==Costs==
The pathogen results in an estimated 2,100 hospitalizations annually in the United States. The illness is often misdiagnosed; therefore, expensive and invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed. Patients who develop HUS often require prolonged hospitalization, dialysis, and long-term followup.

==Prevention==

===Agricultural===
Beef processing is a common point of contamination: during the slaughtering process, the contents of intestines or fecal material on the hide could mix with the meat, thus allowing bacteria to flourish in the warm, damp conditions. If the infected parts are then ground, the bacteria go from the surface of the cut to the interior of the ground mass. Ground beef is therefore much more likely to be a source of infection than steak. 

In steak, only the surface area of a cut is exposed during butchering, and cooking the outside affects the entire exposed portion. In ground beef, however, bacteria are mixed throughout the meat mass, requiring the entire mass to be heated thoroughly to eliminate the pathogen. Additionally, in the production of ground beef, meat from multiple cattle is often ground together, enabling contamination from a single animal to contaminate an entire lot of ground beef.

Accordingly, reduction of infection requires preventive measures that either reduce the number of cattle that carry ''E. coli'' O157:H7 or reduce the contamination of meat during slaughter and grinding. These measures include careful removal and cleaning of the intestines, steam/vacuum treatment, and organic acid sprays.

In January 2007, Canadian biopharmaceutical company [[Bioniche]] announced it had developed a bovine vaccine capable of reducing O157:H7 in cattle by over 99%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Research Collaboration Produces World's First Food Safety Vaccine: Against E. coli 0157:H7|work=CNX Marketlink|url=http://www.cnxmarketlink.com/en/releases/archive/January2007/10/c4698.html|accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>

On March 4, 2009, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) granted Epitopix a conditional license for the first ''E. coli'' O157 vaccine for cattle in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.epitopix.com/news_display.aspx?doi=45 Epitopix.com]</ref>

In May 2010, a paper from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center detailed preliminary results of research into the sensing mechanisms used by O157:H7 to determine when to adopt an acid-resistant state needed to escape from the digestive tract. The study introduced two different strains of ''E. coli'' lacking normal sensing mechanisms into the rumens of grain-fed cattle. The strains were unable to pass through the stomach. Next, the researchers plan to conduct tests on grass-fed cattle to establish if the mechanism is the same.<ref>{{cite web |author=UT Southwestern Medical Center |title=Mechanism That May Stop E.

===Culinary and dietary===
Cooking all [[ground beef]] and [[hamburger]]s thoroughly, and checking the temperature using an instant-read meat [[thermometer]], will eliminate the organism. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer inserted into several parts of the patty, including the thickest part, reads at least {{convert|72|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

When preparing meat, it should be kept separate from other food items and all surfaces, and utensils which come into contact with raw meat should be washed and rinsed thoroughly before being used again. [[Hand washing]] is similarly important. Placing cooked hamburgers or ground beef on an unwashed plate that held raw patties can transmit infection. This was the main cause of the ''E. coli'' poisoning in Scotland in 1996 that killed seven and left hundreds infected.

Unpasteurized milk and juices are potential sources of ''E. coli''. Commercial juice is almost always pasteurized, and juice concentrates are also heated sufficiently to kill [[pathogen]]s.

Fruits and vegetables should be washed and rinsed thoroughly, especially those that will not be cooked. Children under five years of age, immunocompromised persons, and the elderly should avoid eating [[alfalfa]] sprouts until their safety can be assured. Methods to decontaminate alfalfa [[seed]]s and [[sprout]]s are being investigated.

Before consumption, contaminated water should be sterilized by 1) boiling at a rolling boil for at least one minute (longer at higher altitudes), 2) ultrafiltration using a system designed for water treatment, or 3) chemically sterilized using an ozone, chlorine, or iodine product. Care while swimming to avoid ingestion of potentially contaminated water can reduce the chances of infection.

Proper [[hand washing]] after using the lavatory or changing a diaper, especially among children or those with diarrhea, reduces the risk of transmission. Anyone with a diarrheal illness should avoid swimming in public pools or lakes, sharing baths with others, and preparing food for others.

==United States==
The [[U.S.D.A.]] banned the sale of ground beef contaminated with the O157:H7 strain in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Ban on E.
