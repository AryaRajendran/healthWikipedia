'''Generalized anxiety disorder''' ('''GAD''') is an [[anxiety disorder]] that is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often [[Irrationality|irrational]] [[worry]] about everyday things that is disproportionate to the actual source of worry. For diagnosis of this disorder, symptoms must last at least 6 months.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Torpy JM, Burke AE, Golub RM | year = 2011 | title = Generalized Anxiety Disorder | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 305 | issue = 5| pages = 522–522 | doi = 10.1001/jama.305.5.522 }}</ref> This excessive worry often interferes with daily [[Functionalism|functioning]], as individuals suffering GAD typically anticipate disaster, and are overly concerned about everyday matters such as [[health]] issues, [[money]], [[death]], [[family]] problems, [[friend]]ship problems, [[relationship|interpersonal relationship]] problems, or work difficulties.<ref name="nimh">[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/anxiety.cfm#anx7 "Anxiety Disorders"], National Institute of Mental Health.

===Epidemiology===
The usual age of onset is variable - from childhood to late adulthood, with the median age of onset being approximately 31 (Kessler, Berguland, et al., 2005) and mean age of onset is 32.7.<ref name="GRANT 1747">{{cite journal|last=GRANT|first=BRIDGET F.|coauthors=HASIN, DEBORAH S.; STINSON, FREDERICK S.; DAWSON, DEBORAH A.; JUNE RUAN, W.; GOLDSTEIN, RISË B.; SMITH, SHARON M.; SAHA, TULSHI D.; HUANG, BOJI|title=Prevalence, correlates, co-morbidity, and comparative disability of DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder in the USA: results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=5 October 2005|volume=35|issue=12|page=1747|doi=10.1017/S0033291705006069}}</ref> Most studies find that GAD is associated with an earlier and more gradual onset than the other anxiety disorders.

Populations that are at an increased risk of GAD are individuals with low and middle socio-economic status, separated, divorced, and widowed individuals. Women are also at a great risk of developing GAD (twice more likely than men). This is primarily because women are more likely than men to live in poverty, and are more subject to discrimination, and sexual and physical abuse. <ref> Schacter, Daniel L., Gilbert, Daniel T., and Wegner, Daniel M. "Generalized Anxiety Disorders". Psychology; Second Edition. New York: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 559-560. Print. </ref>

Other causes of developing GAD include residing in large cities (i.e. having more expenses and higher stress levels), unsafe political conditions, traumatic experiences in childhood, and major life changes such as getting a new job, having a baby, suffering a personal loss, or dealing with physical illnesses. <ref> Schacter, Daniel L., Gilbert, Daniel T., and Wegner, Daniel M.

In one study in 1988–90, illness in approximately half of patients attending mental health services at British hospital psychiatric clinic, for conditions including [[anxiety disorders]] such as [[panic disorder]] or [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], was determined to be the result of [[ethanol|alcohol]] or [[benzodiazepine dependence]]. In these patients, anxiety symptoms, while worsening initially during the withdrawal phase, disappeared with abstinence from benzodiazepines or alcohol. Sometimes anxiety pre-existed [[ethanol|alcohol]] or benzodiazepine dependence, but the dependence was acting to keep the anxiety disorders going and often progressively making them worse. Recovery from benzodiazepines tends to take a lot longer than recovery from alcohol, but people can regain their previous good health.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cohen SI |title=Alcohol and benzodiazepines generate anxiety, panic and phobias |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=73–77 |year=1995 |month=February |pmid=7769598 |pmc=1295099 |doi= }}</ref>

===Neurology===
Generalized anxiety disorder has been linked to disrupted functional connectivity of the [[amygdala]] and its processing of fear and anxiety.<ref name="Etkin">{{cite journal | last1 = Etkin | first1 = A | last2 = Prater | first2 = KE | last3 = Schatzberg | first3 = AF | last4 = Menon | first4 = V | last5 = Greicius | first5 = MD. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2009 | title = Disrupted amygdalar subregion functional connectivity and evidence of a compensatory network in generalized anxiety disorder | url = | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 66 | issue = 12| pages = 1361–72 | pmid = 19996041 | doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2009.104}}</ref> Sensory information enters the amygdala through the nuclei of the basolateral complex (consisting of lateral, basal and accessory basal nuclei). The basolateral complex processes the sensory-related fear memories and communicates their threat importance to memory and sensory processing elsewhere in the brain, such as the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and sensory cortices.

Another area, the adjacent central nucleus of the amygdala, controls species-specific fear responses in its connections to the [[brainstem]], [[hypothalamus]] and [[cerebellum]] areas. In those with generalized anxiety disorder these connections functionally seem to be less distinct, and there is greater [[gray matter]] in the central nucleus. Another difference is that the amygdala areas have decreased connectivity with the [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[cingulate]] areas that control general stimulus salience, while having greater connectivity with the [[parietal cortex]] and [[prefrontal cortex]] circuits that underlie [[executive function]]s.<ref name="Etkin"/> The latter suggests a compensation strategy for dysfunctional amygdala processing of anxiety.  This is consistent with cognitive theories that suggest the use in this disorder of attempts to reduce the involvement of emotions with compensatory cognitive strategies.<ref name="Etkin"/>

==Prevention==
	
Focus is increasing on [[Mental disorders#Prevention|prevention of mental disorders]]. Use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with people at risk of anxiety has been shown to significantly reduce the number of episodes of generalized anxiety disorder and anxiety symptoms, and also significant improvements in explanatory style, hopelessness, and dysfunctional attitudes.<ref>http://www.positivepsychology.org/depprevseligman1999.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16889931 |title=Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training (...

==Diagnosis==

===DSM-IV-TR criteria===
DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder are as follows:<br>
A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more-days-than-not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).<br/>
B. The person finds it difficult to control the worry.<br/>
C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more-days-than-not for the past 6 months).

D. The focus of the anxiety and worry is not confined to features of other Axis I disorder (such as social phobia, OCD, PTSD etc.)<br/>
E. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.<br/>
F. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism), and does not occur exclusively during a mood disorder, psychotic disorder, or a pervasive developmental disorder.<ref>American Psychiatric Association.

==Treatment==


A meta-analysis of 35 studies shows [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] to be more effective in the long term than pharmacologic treatment (drugs such as [[SSRIs]]), and while both treatments reduce anxiety, CBT is more effective in reducing depression.<ref>{{Cite doi | 10.1016/S0005-7894(97)80048-2 }}</ref>

===Cognitive–behavioral orientated psychotherapy===
Generalized anxiety disorder is based on psychological components that include cognitive avoidance, positive worry beliefs, ineffective problem-solving and emotional processing, interpersonal issues, previous trauma, intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, ineffective coping, emotional hyperarousal, poor understanding of emotions, negative cognitive reactions to emotions, maladaptive emotion management and regulation, experiential avoidance, and behavioral restriction.<ref name="Behar, DiMarco 2009">{{cite journal | author = Behar DiMarco, Hekler Mohlman, Staples  | year = 2009 | title = Current theoretical models of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): Conceptual review and treatment implications | url = | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 1011–1023 | doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2009.07.006 }}</ref> In order to combat the previous cognitive and emotional aspects of GAD, psychologists often include some of the following key treatment components in their intervention plan; self-monitoring, relaxation techniques, self-control desensitization, gradual stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, worry outcome monitoring, present-moment focus, expectancy-free living, problem-solving techniques, processing of core fears, socialization, discussion and reframing of worry beliefs, emotional skills training, experiential exposure, psychoeducation, mindfulness and acceptance exercises.<ref name="Behar, DiMarco 2009"/> There exist behavioral, cognitive, and a combination of both treatments for GAD that focus on some of those key components. 
Among the cognitive–behavioral orientated psychotherapies the two main treatments are cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. Intolerance of uncertainty therapy and motivational interviewing are two new treatments for GAD that are used as either stand-alone treatments or additional strategies that may enhance CBT.<ref name="Hoyer, J. 2011">{{cite journal | author = Hoyer J., Van , der Heiden C., Portman M.

;Cognitive behavioral therapy
{{Main|Cognitive behavioral therapy}}

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a [[psychological]] method of treatment for GAD that involves a [[therapist]] working with the patient to understand how [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s influence [[behaviour]].<ref name="cbt">[http://www.babcp.com/babcp/what_is_CBT.htm "A Guide to Understanding Cognitive and Behavioural Psychotherapies"], [[British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies]]. Accessed 29 May 2007.</ref> The goal of the therapy is to change negative thought patterns that lead to the patient's anxiety, replacing them with positive, more realistic ones.  Elements of the therapy include [[Exposure Therapy|exposure strategies]] to allow the patient to confront their anxieties gradually and feel more comfortable in anxiety-provoking situations, as well as to practice the skills they have learned.  CBT can be used alone or in conjunction with [[medication]].<ref name="mayo" />

Components of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for GAD includes psychoeducation, self-monitoring, stimulus control techniques, relaxation, self-control desensitization, cognitive restructuring, worry exposure, worry behavior modification, and problem-solving. The first step in the treatment of GAD is psychoeducation which involves giving information to the patient about the disorder and the treatment. The purpose of psychoeducation is to provide some relief, destigmatization of the disorder, enhance motivation for treatment based on a rationale of the components of the treatment, and increasing compliance by developing realistic expectations about treatment. Self-monitoring requires daily monitoring the times and levels of anxiety as well as the events that provoked them. The purpose of this component is to identify cues that provoke the anxiety. Stimulus control intervention refers to minimizing the stimulus conditions under which worrying occurs. Patients are instructed to postpone worrying during the day to a specific selected time and location in which the focus will only be worrying and problem-solving. Relaxation techniques are designed to lower the patients' stress and thus increasing their attention to alternatives in feared situations (other than worrying). Deep breathing exercise, progressive muscle relaxation, and applied relaxation fall under the scope of relaxation techniques.<ref name="Hoyer, J. 2011"/> 

Self-control desensitization involves patients being deeply relaxed before vividly imagining themselves in situations that usually makes them anxious and worry until internal anxiety cues are triggered. Patients then imagine themselves coping with the situation and decreasing their anxious respond. If anxiety diminishes, then they enter a deeper relaxed state and turn off the scene. Cognitive restructuring's purpose is to shift from worrisome to a more functional and adaptive perception of the world, the future, and the self. It involves socratic questioning that lead patients to think through their worries and anxieties in order for them to realize that alternative interpretations and feelings are more accurate. It also involves behavioral experiments that actually test the validity of both the negative and alternative thoughts in real-life situations. In CBT for GAD, patients also engage in worry exposure exercises during which they are imaginally exposed to images of the most feared outcomes. Then they engage in response-prevention instruction that prevents them from avoiding the image and motivates alternative outcomes to the feared stimulus. The goals of worry exposure are habituation and reinterpretation of the meaning of the feared stimulus. Worry behavior prevention requires patients to monitor the behaviors that caused them worry and are then asked to prevent themselves from engaging in them. Instead they are encouraged to use other coping mechanisms learned earlier in the treatment. Finally, problem solving focuses on dealing with current problems through a problem-solving approach: (1) definition of the problem, (2) formulation of goals, (3) creation of alternative solutions, (4) decision-making, and (5) implementing and verifying the solutions.<ref name="Hoyer, J. 2011"/> 

There is little debate regarding the effectiveness of CBT for GAD. However, there is still room for improvement because only about 50% of treatment completers achieve high functioning or recovery after treatment. Therefore, there's a need for enhancement of current components of CBT.<ref name="Hoyer, J. 2011"/> CBT usually helps one third of the patients substantially, whilst another third does not respond at all to treatment.<ref>Barlow, D. H.: (2007) ''Clincical Handbook of Psychological Disorders'', 4th ed.</ref>

;Acceptance and commitment therapy
{{Main|Acceptance and commitment therapy}}
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a behavioral treatment based on acceptance-based models. ACT is designed with the purpose to target three therapeutic goals: (1) reduce the use of avoiding strategies intended to avoid feelings, thoughts, memories, and sensations; (2) decreasing a person's literal response to their thoughts (e.g., understanding that thinking "I'm hopeless" doesn't mean that the person's life is truly hopeless), and (3) increasing the person's ability to keep commitments to changing their behaviors. These goals are attained by switching the person's attempt to control events to working towards changing their behavior and focusing on valued directions and goals in their lives as well as committing to behaviors that will help the individual accomplish those personal goals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Roemer L., Orsillo S.

;Intolerance of uncertainty therapy
{{Main|Intolerance-of-uncertainty therapy}}
Intolerance of uncertainty therapy (IUT) refers to a consistent negative reaction to uncertain and ambiguous events regardless of their likelihood of occurrence. IUT is used as a stand-alone treatment for GAD patients. Thus, IUT focuses on helping patients in developing the ability to tolerate, cope with and accept uncertainty in their life in order to reduce anxiety. IUT is based on the psychological components of psychoeducation, awareness of worry, training of problem-solving, re-evaluation of the usefulness of worry, imaginal exposure, recognition of uncertainty, and behavioral exposure. Studies have shown support for the efficacy of this therapy with GAD patients with continued improvements in follow-up periods.<ref name="Hoyer, J. 2011"/> 

;Motivational interviewing
{{Main|Motivational interviewing}}
A promising innovative approach to improving recovery rates for the treatment of GAD is to combine CBT with Motivational Interviewing (MI). Motivational Interviewing is a strategy centered on the patient that aims to increase intrinsic motivation and decrease ambivalence about change due to the treatment. MI contains four key elements; (1) express empathy, (2) heighten dissonance between behaviors that are not desired and values that are not consistent with those behaviors, (3) move with resistance rather than direct confrontation, and (4) encourage self-efficacy. It is based on asking open-ended questions and listening carefully and reflectively to patients' answers, eliciting "change talk", and talking with patients about the pros and cons of change. Some studies have shown the combination of CBT with MI to be more efficient than CBT alone.<ref name="Hoyer, J. 2011"/>

===SSRIs===

{{Main|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor}}

Pharmaceutical treatments for GAD include [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs),<ref name="mayo">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/generalized-anxiety-disorder/DS00502/DSECTION=8 "Generalized anxiety disorder"], Mayo Clinic. Accessed 29 May 2007.</ref> which are antidepressants that influence brain chemistry to block the reabsorption of [[serotonin]] in the [[Human brain|brain]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ssris/MH00066 "SSRIs"], Mayo Clinic.  Accessed 29 May 2007.</ref>  SSRIs are mainly indicated for [[clinical depression]], but are also used in treating anxiety disorders.<ref name="mayo" /> Common side effects include [[nausea]], [[sexual dysfunction]], [[headache]], [[diarrhea]], [[constipation]], [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Adverse effects|among others]]. Common SSRIs prescribed for GAD include:

* [[paroxetine]] (Paxil, Aropax)
* [[escitalopram]] (Lexapro, Cipralex) or [[citalopram]] (Celexa, Cipramil) 
* [[fluoxetine]] (prozac)
* [[sertraline]] (Zoloft)

===Pregabalin===
{{Main|Pregabalin}}
[[Pregabalin]] (Lyrica) acts on the [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]] in order to decrease the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, noradrenaline and substance P. Its therapeutic effect appears after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to [[lorazepam]], [[alprazolam]] and [[venlafaxine]] but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and additionally unlike benzodiazepines it does not disrupt [[sleep architecture]] and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment; it also has a low potential for abuse and dependence and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bandelow | first1 = B. | last2 = Wedekind | first2 = D. | last3 = Leon | first3 = T. | title = Pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a novel pharmacologic intervention | journal = Expert Rev Neurother | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 769–81 | month = Jul | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1586/14737175.7.7.769 | pmid = 17610384 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = RT. | title = Pregabalin: its efficacy, safety and tolerability profile in generalized anxiety | journal = Drugs Today (Barc) | volume = 43 | issue = 9 | pages = 601–10 | month = Sep | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1358/dot.2007.43.9.1133188 | pmid = 17940637 }}</ref> The anxiolytic effects of pregabalin appear rapidly after administration, similar to the benzodiazepines, which gives pregabalin an advantage over many anxiolytic medications such as antidepressants.<ref name="pmid22395254">{{cite journal |author=Wensel TM, Powe KW, Cates ME |title=Pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=424–9 |year=2012 |month=March |pmid=22395254 |doi=10.1345/aph.1Q405 }}</ref>

===Other drugs===
- ''Psychotropic drugs''
* [[Buspirone]] (BuSpar) is a [[serotonin receptor]] partial agonist, belonging to the [[azaspirodecanedione]] class of compounds.
* [[Duloxetine]] (Cymbalta)- [[SNRI]] - type antidepressant
* [[Imipramine]] (Tofranil) is a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA).
* Other [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s - as [[clomipramine]],etc. TCAs are thought to act on serotonin, norepinephrine, and [[dopamine]] in the brain.
* [[Venlafaxine]] (Effexor XR) is a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI). SNRIs alter the chemistries of both [[norepinephrine]] and serotonin in the brain.
* [[Afobazole]]
* Some of [[MAO inhibitor]]s - such as [[Moclobemide]],rarely [[Nialamide]]

- ''Non-psychotropic drugs''
* [[Propranolol]] (Inderal, avlocardyl) - Sympatholytic, beta-adrenoblocker
* [[Clonidine]] - Sympatholytic
* [[Guanfacine]] - Sympatholytic
* [[Prazosin]] - Sympatholytic, alpha-adrenoblocker

====Benzodiazepines====
{{Main|Benzodiazepine}}

Benzodiazepines are most often prescribed to patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Research suggests that these drugs give some relief, at least in the short term. However, they carry some risks, mainly impairment of both cognitive and motor functioning, and psychological and physical dependence that makes it difficult for patients to stop taking them. It has been noted that people taking benzodiazepines aren't as alert on their job or at school. Additionally, these drugs may impair driving and they are often associated with falls in the elderly, resulting in hip fractures. These shortcomings make the use of benzodiazepines optimal only for short-term relief of anxiety.<ref>Barlow, D. H., & Durand, V. M. (2009). Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach. 5th Edition. Belmont: Wadsworth Cengage Learning.</ref> CBT and medication are of comparable efficacy in the short-term but CBT has advantages over medication in the longer term.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Durham R.

[[Benzodiazepines]] (or "benzos") are fast-acting hypnotic [[sedatives]] that are also used to treat GAD and other [[anxiety disorders]].<ref name="mayo" /> Benzodiazepines are prescribed for generalized anxiety disorder and show beneficial effects in the short term. The World Council of Anxiety does not recommend the long-term use of benzodiazepines because they are associated with the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[psychomotor impairment]], cognitive and memory impairments, [[physical dependence]] and a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]].<ref name="Allgulander-2003">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Allgulander | first1 = C. | last2 = Bandelow | first2 = B. | last3 = Hollander | first3 = E. | last4 = Montgomery | first4 = SA. | last5 = Nutt | first5 = DJ. | last6 = Okasha | first6 = A. | last7 = Pollack | first7 = MH. | last8 = Stein | first8 = DJ. | last9 = Swinson | first9 = RP. | title = WCA recommendations for the long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder | journal = CNS Spectr | volume = 8 | issue = 8 Suppl 1 | pages = 53–61 | month = Aug | year = 2003 | doi =  | pmid = 14767398 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Stewart SH, Westra HA |title=Benzodiazepine side-effects: from the bench to the clinic |journal=Curr.

* [[chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium)
* [[clonazepam]] (Klonopin)
* [[clorazepate]] (Tranxene)
* [[diazepam]] (Valium)
* [[lorazepam]] (Ativan)

===Caffeine elimination===
Eliminating caffeine can largely eliminate GAD in some sufferers.<ref>[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=4996824 Cambridge Journals Online - Abstract<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, anxiety can temporarily increase during caffeine withdrawal.<ref name="pmid12204389">{{cite journal |author=Dews PB, O'Brien CP, Bergman J |title=Caffeine: behavioral effects of withdrawal and related issues |journal=Food Chem. Toxicol. |volume=40 |issue=9 |pages=1257–61 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12204389 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00095-9}}</ref>

==Comorbidity==
In the National Comorbidity Survey (2005), 58 percent of patients diagnosed with [[Clinical depression|major depression]] were found to have an anxiety disorder; among these patients, the rate of comorbidity with GAD was 17.2 percent, and with [[panic disorder]], 9.9 percent. Patients with a diagnosed anxiety disorder also had high rates of comorbid depression, including 22.4 percent of patients with [[social phobia]], 9.4 percent with [[agoraphobia]], and 2.3 percent with panic disorder. For many, the symptoms of both depression and anxiety are not severe enough (i.e. are subsyndromal) to justify a primary diagnosis of either major depressive disorder  (MDD) or an anxiety disorder. However, [[dysthymia]] is the most prevalent comorbid diagnosis of GAD clients.

Patients can also be categorized as having [[mixed anxiety-depressive disorder]], and they are at significantly increased risk of developing full-blown depression or anxiety.

Accumulating evidence indicates that patients with comorbid depression and anxiety tend to have greater illness severity and a lower treatment response than those with either disorder alone.<ref name="Wolitzky-Taylor et al-2010">{{Cite journal

Further research suggests that about 20 to 40% of individuals with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] have comorbid anxiety disorders, with GAD being the most prevalent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/555748_5 |title=Access |publisher=Medscape |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}</ref>
