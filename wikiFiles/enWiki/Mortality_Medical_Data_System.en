The '''Mortality Medical Data System (MMDS)''' is used to automate the entry, classification, and retrieval of cause-of-death information reported on [[death certificate]]s throughout the [[United States]] and in many other countries.  The [[National Center for Health Statistics]] (NCHS) began the system's development in 1967.

The system has facilitated the standardization of mortality information within the United States, and [[#ACME|ACME]] has become the de facto international standard for the automated selection of the '''underlying cause of death''' from multiple conditions listed on a death certificate. (Johansson & Westerling 2002:302)

==System Components==

The MMDS system consists of the following components, and is itself part of the [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss.htm National Vital Statistics System].

===MICAR===

There are two '''Mortality Medical Indexing, Classification, and Retrieval''' components.
* SuperMICAR automates the MICAR data entry process. This program is designed as an enhancement of the earlier PC-MICAR Data Entry program. Super-MICAR is designed to automatically encode cause-of-death data into numeric entity reference numbers.
* MICAR200 automates the multiple cause coding rules and assigns [[ICD|''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'']] (ICD) codes to each numeric entity reference number.

===ACME===
 <!-- This section is linked from [[Acme]] -->
The '''Automated Classification of Medical Entities''' program automates the underlying cause-of-death coding rules. The input to ACME is the multiple cause-of-death codes ([[ICD]]) assigned to each entity (e.g., disease condition, accident, or injury) listed on cause-of-death certifications, preserving the location and order as reported by the certifier. ACME then applies the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) rules to the [[ICD]] codes and selects an underlying cause of death.  ACME has become the de facto international standard for the automated selection of the underlying cause of death. (Johansson & Westerling 2002:302)

===TRANSAX===

The '''TRANSlation of Axis''' program converts the ACME output data into fixed format and translates the data into a more desirable statistical form using the linkage provisions of the [[ICD]]. TRANSAX creates the data necessary for person-based tabulations by translating the axis of classification from an entity basis to a record basis.
