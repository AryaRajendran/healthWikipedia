'''Darbepoetin alfa''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]]) ({{IPAc-en|icon|d|ɑr|b|ə|ˈ|p|ɔɪ|t|ɨ|n}}) is a synthetic form of [[erythropoietin]]. It stimulates [[erythropoiesis]] (increases [[red blood cell]] levels) and is used to treat [[anemia]], commonly associated with [[chronic renal failure]] and cancer [[chemotherapy]]. Darbepoetin is marketed by [[Amgen]] under the trade name '''Aranesp'''.

The drug was approved in September 2001 by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for treatment of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure by intravenous or subcutaneous injection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/appletter/2001/darbamg091701L.htm

[[Dr. Reddy's Laboratories]] launched darbepoetin alfa in India under the brand name ‘Cresp’ in August 2010. This is the world’s first generic darbepoetin alfa. Cresp has been approved in India.

Darbepoetin is produced by [[recombinant DNA]] technology in modified [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} It differs from endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) by containing two more N-linked oligosaccharide chains.  It is an erythropoiesis-stimulating 165-[[amino acid]] [[protein]].

Like EPO, its use increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, including [[cardiac arrest]], arrhythmia, [[hypertension]] and [[hypertensive encephalopathy]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[vascular thrombosis]] or ischemia, [[myocardial infarction]], [[edema]], and stroke. It can also increase risk of seizures. A recent study has extended these findings to treatment of patients exhibiting cancer-related anemia (distinct from anemia resulting from chemotherapy).<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Pollack

 |publisher=The New York Times |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2007-01-27 }}</ref> Pre-existing untreated hypertension is a contra-indication for darbepoetin, as well as some hematologic diseases. Other reported adverse reactions include [[hypotension]], [[fever]], chest pains, nausea and [[myalgia]].

Like EPO, it has the potential to be abused by athletes seeking a competitive advantage. Its use during the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]] to improve performance led to the disqualification of [[cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]] [[Larisa Lazutina]] and [[Olga Danilova]] of Russia and [[Johann Mühlegg]] of Spain from their final races. Nevertheless, recent publication in professional literature indicate that the detection of prohibited substances at the 2002 Olympics may have been false as a result of less-than-perfect detection methodology, and the Olympic champions could therefore wrongly suffer IOC sanctions.<ref>{{cite web |first=AR |last=Koudinov |title=WADA, IOC Testing For Erythropoietin Is Faked  |url=http://dopingjournal.org/content/3/1/dopingj022006-01.html |publisher=The Doping Journal |date=2006-02-26 |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=}}</ref>

==Safety advisories in anemic cancer patients==
Amgen sent a "dear doctor" letter in January, 2007, that highlighted results from a recent anemia of cancer trial, and warned doctors to consider use in that off-label indication with caution.

Amgen advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as to the results of the [[DAHANCA]] 10 clinical trial.  The DAHANCA 10 data monitoring committee found that 3-year loco-regional control in subjects treated with Aranesp was significantly worse than for those not receiving Aranesp (p=0.01).

In response to these advisories, the FDA released a [[Public Health Advisory]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/RHE2007.htm |title=FDA Public Health Advisory: Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs): Epoetin alfa (marketed as Procrit, Epogen), Darbepoetin alfa (marketed as Aranesp) |accessdate=2007-06-05 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070528103823/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/RHE2007.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-28}}</ref>
on March 9, 2007, and a clinical [[Alert]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/RHE2007HCP.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) |accessdate=2007-06-05 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070515034509/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/RHE2007HCP.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-15}}</ref> for doctors on February 16, 2007, about the use of erythropoeisis-stimulating agents such as [[epogen]] and darbepoetin.  The advisory recommended caution in using these agents in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or off chemotherapy, and indicated a lack of clinical evidence to support improvements in quality of life or transfusion requirements in these settings.

In addition, on March 9, 2007, drug manufacturers agreed to new "black box" warnings about the safety of these drugs.  On November 8, 2007, additional "black box" warnings were included on the aranesp label, at the request of the FDA.

On March 22, 2007, a congressional inquiry into the safety of erythropoeitic growth factors was reported in the news media.  Manufacturers were asked to suspend drug rebate programs for physicians and to also suspend marketing the drugs to patients.

==Business considerations for drug manufacturers==
Epogen and Darbepoetin alfa had more than $6 billion in combined sales in 2006. Procrit sales were about $3.2 billion in 2006.
