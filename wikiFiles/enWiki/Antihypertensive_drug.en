'''Antihypertensives''' are a class of [[medication|drugs]] that are used to treat [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure).<ref>{{MeshName|Antihypertensive+Agents}}</ref> Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the complications of high blood pressure, such as [[stroke]] and [[myocardial infarction]]. Evidence suggests that reduction of the [[blood pressure]] by 5&nbsp;mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of [[ischaemic heart disease]] by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of [[dementia]], [[heart failure]], and [[death|mortality]] from [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Law M, Wald N, Morris J |title=Lowering blood pressure to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke: a new preventive strategy |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=7 |issue=31 |pages=1–94 |year=2003 |pmid=14604498 |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/fullmono/mon731.pdf}}</ref> There are many classes of antihypertensives, which lower blood pressure by different means; among the most important and most widely used are the [[thiazide]] [[diuretic]]s, the [[ACE inhibitor]]s, the [[calcium channel blocker]]s, the [[beta blocker]]s, and the [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s or ARBs.

Which type of medication to use initially for hypertension has been the subject of several large studies and resulting national guidelines. The fundamental goal of treatment should be the prevention of the important [[clinical endpoint|endpoints]] of [[hypertension]], such as heart attack, stroke and heart failure. Patient age, associated clinical conditions and end-organ damage also play a part in determining dosage and type of medication administered.<ref name=nps02>{{cite journal |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/4/108/12 |title=Drug treatment of elevated blood pressure |author=Nelson, Mark |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=108–112 |accessdate=August 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100826074015/http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/4/108/12| archivedate= 26 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The several classes of antihypertensives differ in side effect profiles, ability to prevent endpoints, and cost.

==Diuretics==
[[File:Hydrochlorothiazide.png|thumb|[[Hydrochlorothiazide]], a popular [[thiazide]] diuretic]]
[[Diuretic]]s help the kidneys eliminate excess salt and water from the body's tissues and blood.
* [[Loop diuretic]]s:
** [[bumetanide]]
** [[ethacrynic acid]]
** [[furosemide]]
** [[torsemide]]
* [[Thiazide]] diuretics:
** [[epitizide]]
** [[hydrochlorothiazide]] and [[chlorothiazide]]
** [[bendroflumethiazide]]
* Thiazide-like diuretics:
** [[indapamide]]
** [[chlorthalidone]]
** [[metolazone]]
* [[Potassium-sparing diuretics]]:
** [[amiloride]]
** [[triamterene]]
** [[spironolactone]]

Only the [[thiazide]] and thiazide-like diuretics have good evidence of beneficial effects on important endpoints of [[hypertension]], and hence, should usually be the first choice when selecting a diuretic to treat hypertension. The reason why thiazide-type diuretics are better than the others is (at least in part) thought to be because of their vasodilating properties.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Although the diuretic effect of thiazides may be apparent shortly after administration, it takes longer (weeks of treatment) for the full anti-hypertensive effect to develop. In the United States, the JNC7 (The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention of Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) recommends starting with a [[thiazide]] diuretic if single therapy is being initiated and another medication is not indicated.<!--
 --><ref name="jnc7">{{cite journal | url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/289.19.2560v1 | author=Chobanian AV |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] | title=The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure: the JNC 7 report | year=2003 | volume=289 | pages=2560–72 | pmid=12748199 | doi=10.1001/jama.289.19.2560 | issue=19 | author-separator=, | display-authors=1 | last2=Bakris | first2=G.

This is based on a slightly better outcome for [[chlortalidone]] in the ALLHAT study versus other anti-hypertensives and because thiazide diuretics are relatively cheap.<!--

Despite thiazides being cheap, effective, and recommended as the best first-line drug for hypertension by many experts, they are not prescribed as often as some newer drugs. This is because they have been associated with increased risk of new-onset diabetes and as such are recommended for use in patients over 65 where the risk of new-onset diabetes is outweighed by the benefits of controlling systolic blood pressure.<!--

==Renin Inhibitors==
[[Renin]] comes one level higher than Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) in the [[Renin-angiotensin system|Renin-Angiotensin System]].

Indeed, as a consequence of AT1 blockade, ARBs increase [[Angiotensin]] II levels several-fold above baseline by uncoupling a [[negative-feedback]] loop. Increased levels of circulating Angiotensin II result in unopposed stimulation of the AT2 receptors, which are, in addition upregulated. Unfortunately, recent data suggest that AT2 receptor stimulation may be less beneficial than previously proposed and may even be harmful under certain circumstances through mediation of growth promotion, fibrosis, and hypertrophy, as well as proatherogenic and proinflammatory effects.<ref name="AJH1">

==Aldosterone antagonists==
[[Aldosterone]] receptor antagonists:
* [[eplerenone]]
* [[spironolactone]]

[[Aldosterone]] antagonists are not recommended as first-line agents for blood pressure,<ref name="jnc7" /> but [[spironolactone]] and [[eplerenone]] are both used in the treatment of [[heart failure]].

==Vasodilators==
[[Vasodilator]]s act directly on the [[smooth muscle]] of arteries to relax their walls so blood can move more easily through them; they are only used in [[hypertensive emergency|hypertensive emergencies]] or when other drugs have failed, and even so are rarely given alone.

[[Sodium nitroprusside]], a very potent, short-acting vasodilator, is most commonly used for the quick, temporary reduction of blood pressure in emergencies (such as [[malignant hypertension]] or [[aortic dissection]]).<ref name=Brunton>{{cite book |author=Brunton L, Parker K, Blumenthal D, Buxton I |title=Goodman & Gilman's Manual of Pharmacology and Therapeutics |year=2007 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-144343-2 |pages=544–60 |chapter=Therapy of hypertension}}</ref><ref name=Varon>{{cite pmid|10893382}}</ref> [[Hydralazine]] and its derivatives are also used in the treatment of severe hypertension, although they should be avoided in emergencies.<ref name=Varon/> They are no longer indicated as first-line therapy for high blood pressure due to side effects and safety concerns, but hydralazine remains a drug of choice in [[gestational hypertension]].<ref name=Brunton/>

==Alpha-2 agonists==
Central alpha agonists lower blood pressure by stimulating alpha-receptors in the brain which open peripheral arteries easing blood flow. Central alpha agonists, such as clonidine, are usually prescribed when all other anti-hypertensive medications have failed. For treating hypertension, these drugs are usually administered in combination with a diuretic.
* [[Clonidine]]
* [[Guanabenz]]
* [[Methyldopa]]
* [[Moxonidine]]

Adverse effects of this class of drugs include sedation, drying of the nasal mucosa and rebound hypertension.

Some adrenergic neuron blockers are used for the most resistant forms of hypertension:
* [[Guanethidine]]
* [[Reserpine]]

==Future treatment options==
===Blood pressure vaccines===
Blood pressure vaccinations are being trialed and may become a treatment option for high blood pressure in the future. [[CYT006-AngQb]] was only moderately successful in studies, but similar vaccines are being investigated.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19707182|year=2009|last1=Brown|first1=MJ|title=Success and failure of vaccines against renin-angiotensin system components|volume=6|issue=10|pages=639–47|doi=10.1038/nrcardio.2009.156|journal=Nature reviews. Cardiology}}</ref>

==Choice of initial medication==
For mild blood pressure elevation, consensus guidelines call for medically supervised lifestyle changes and observation before recommending initiation of drug therapy. However, according to the American Hypertension Association, evidence of sustained damage to the body may be present even prior to observed elevation of blood pressure. Therefore the use of hypertensive medications may be started in individuals with apparent normal blood pressures but who show evidence of hypertension related nephropathy, proteinuria, atherosclerotic vascular disease, as well as other evidence of hypertension related organ damage.

If lifestyle changes are ineffective, then drug therapy is initiated, often requiring more than one agent to effectively lower hypertension.
Which type of many medications should be used initially for hypertension has been the subject of several large studies and various national guidelines. Considerations include factors such as age, race, and other medical conditions.<ref name="jnc7" />

The largest study, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), concluded that thiazide-type diuretics are better and cheaper than other major classes of drugs at preventing cardiovascular disease, and should be preferred as the starting drug. ALLHAT used the thiazide diuretic [[chlorthalidone]].<ref name="allhat">{{cite journal|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/288/23/2981|author=ALLHAT Officers and Coordinators for the ALLHAT Collaborative Research Group|journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]|title='''Major outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients randomized to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker vs diuretic: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT)'''|year = 2002|month = December 18|volume = 288|issue = 23|pages = 2981–97|pmid = 12479763|doi=10.1001/jama.288.23.2981}}</ref> (ALLHAT showed that doxazosin, an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, had a higher incidence of heart failure events, and the doxazosin arm of the study was stopped.)

[[Thiazide diuretics]] are effective, recommended as the best first-line drug for hypertension by many experts, and are much more affordable than other therapies, yet they are not prescribed as often as some newer drugs. [[Hydrochlorothiazide]] is perhaps the safest and most inexpensive agent commonly used in this class and is very frequently combined with other agents in a single pill. Doses in excess of 25 milligrams per day of this agent incur an unacceptable risk of low potassium or [[Hypokalemia]]. Patients with an exaggerated hypokalemic response to a low dose of a thiazide diuretic should be suspected to have [[Hyperaldosteronism]], a common cause of secondary hypertension.

Other drugs have a role in treating hypertension. Adverse effects of [[thiazide diuretics]] include [[hypercholesterolemia]], and [[impaired glucose tolerance]] with increased risk of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]. The [[thiazide diuretics]] also deplete circulating potassium unless combined with a [[potassium-sparing diuretic]] or supplemental potassium.

Current UK guidelines suggest starting patients over the age of 55 years and all those of African/Afrocaribbean ethnicity firstly on calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics, whilst younger patients of other [[ethnic group]]s should be started on ACE-inhibitors. Subsequently if dual therapy is required to use ACE-inhibitor in combination with either a calcium channel blocker or a (thiazide) diuretic. Triple therapy is then of all three groups and should the need arise then to add in a fourth agent, to consider either a further diuretic (e.g. [[spironolactone]] or [[furosemide]]), an alpha-blocker or a beta-blocker.<ref name="NICE-BP">{{cite web| title=CG34 Hypertension – quick reference guide |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |date=28 June 2006 |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg034quickrefguide.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-03-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090313072133/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg034quickrefguide.pdf| archivedate= 13 March 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Prior to the demotion of beta-blockers as first line agents, the UK sequence of combination therapy used the first letter of the drug classes and was known as the "ABCD rule".<ref name="NICE-BP"/><ref name="pmid14594956">{{cite journal |author=Williams B |title=Treatment of hypertension in the UK: simple as ABCD? |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=96 |issue=11 |pages=521–2 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14594956 |pmc=539621 |doi= 10.1258/jrsm.96.11.521|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14594956}}</ref>

===Patient Factors Affecting Antihypertensive Drug Choice===
The choice between the drugs is to a large degree determined by the characteristics of the patient being prescribed for, the drugs' side-effects, and cost. Most drugs have other uses; sometimes the presence of other symptoms can warrant the use of one particular antihypertensive. Examples include:
* Age can affect choice of medications. Current UK guidelines suggest starting patients over the age of 55 years first on calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics. 
* [[Anxiety]] may be improved with the use of beta blockers.
* [[Asthma]]tics have been reported to have worsening symptoms when using [[beta blocker]]s. 
* [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]] may be improved with the use of an [[alpha blocker]].
* [[Diabetes]].  The ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been shown to prevent the [[kidney|renal]] and [[retina]]l complications of diabetes mellitus.
*[[Gout]] may be worsened by diuretics, while losartan reduces serum urate. <ref> Würzner G,"Comparative effects of losartan and irbesartan on serum uric acid in hypertensive patients with hyperuricaemia and gout." J Hypertens. 2001;19(10):1855.</ref>
* [[Kidney stone]]s may be improved with the use of thiazide-type diuretics <ref> Worcester EM, Coe FL: Clinical practice. Calcium kidney stones. N Engl J Med 2010;363(10):954-963.  http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcp1001011 </ref>
* [[Heart block]] β-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used in patients with heart block greater than first degree. <ref>1.Chobanian AV, Bakris GL, Black HR, et al: The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-The JNC 7 Report. National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 2003. http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension/jnc7full.pdf </ref>
* [[Heart failure]] may be worsened with nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, the alpha blocker doxazosin, and the alpha-2 agonists moxonidine and clonidine.  Whereas β-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists have been shown to improve outcome.  <ref>Rosendorff C, Black HR, Cannon CP, et al: Treatment of hypertension in the prevention and management of ischemic heart disease: A scientific statement From the American Heart Association Council for High Blood Pressure Research and the Councils on Clinical Cardiology and Epidemiology and Prevention. Circulation 2007;115(21):2761-2788. http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/115/21/2761 </ref>
*Pregnancy. Although α-methyldopa is generally regarded as a first-line agent, labetalol and metoprolol are also acceptable. Atenolol has been associated with intrauterine growth retardation, as well as decreased placental growth and weight when prescribed during pregnancy.  Ace inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)are contraindicated in women who are or who intend to become pregnant.<ref name="jnc7" />
*Race. The JNC 7 particularly points out that when used as monotherapy, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers have been found to be more effective for reducing blood pressure in African-American patients than β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs.
* [[Tremor]] may warrant the use of beta blockers.
The JNC 7 report outlines compelling reasons to choose one drug over the others for certain individual patients.<ref name="jnc7" />

==Herbal and supplemental treatment options==
Several studies have found that [[hibiscus tea]] has a substantial antihypertensive effect attributable to the flower's ACE-inhibiting anthocyanin content, and possibly to a diuretic effect. One study found that hibiscus conferred an antihypertensive effect comparable to 50&nbsp;mg./day of the drug captopril.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mozaffari-Khosravi H, Jalali-Khanabadi BA, Afkhami-Ardekani M, Fatehi F, Noori-Shadkam M |title=The effects of sour tea (''Hibiscus sabdariffa'') on hypertension in patients with type II diabetes |journal=J Hum Hypertens |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=48–54 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=18685605 |doi=10.1038/jhh.2008.100 |url=http://www.nature.com/jhh/journal/v23/n1/full/jhh2008100a.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=McKay DL, Chen CY, Saltzman E, Blumberg JB |title=''Hibiscus sabdariffa L.'' tea (tisane) lowers blood pressure in prehypertensive and mildly hypertensive adults |journal=J.
