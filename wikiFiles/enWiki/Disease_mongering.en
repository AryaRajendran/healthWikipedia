'''Disease mongering''' is a [[pejorative]] term for the practice of widening the diagnostic boundaries of illnesses, and promoting public awareness of such, in order to expand the markets for those who sell and deliver treatments, which may include [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]], physicians, and other professional or consumer organizations.<ref name=Moynihan1>{{cite journal |author=Moynihan R, Heath I, Henry D |title=Selling sickness: the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering |journal=[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]] |volume=324 |issue=7342 |pages=886â€“91 |year=2002 |pmid=11950740 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/324/7342/886 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.886 |pmc=1122833}}</ref> Examples include [[male pattern baldness]] and certain [[specific social phobia|social phobias]].<ref name=Moynihan1/>

In discussions specifically about [[psychiatric]] diagnosis, the term is frequently used by proponents of the [[Antipsychiatry|antipsychiatry movement]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://icspp.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=45&Itemid=72 |title=The Rise and Fall of ADD/ADHD |accessdate=2007-06-03 |author=[[Fred Baughman]] |date=2000-09-25 |publisher=ICSPP}}</ref> and [[Scientology]]-based critics<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p961110.html |title=Psychiatric Profession Current Target of Citizens Commission on Human Rights  |accessdate=2007-06-03 |author=Stephen Barlas and Psychiatric Times staff |date=2006-04-16|publisher=[[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|CCHR]]}}</ref> as just one part of their criticism of [[psychiatry]] or specifically [[biopsychiatry]]. Examples include [[ADHD]] and [[bipolar disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Healy D |title=The latest mania: selling bipolar disorder |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=e185 |year=2006 |pmid=16597178 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030185 | url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0030185 |pmc=1434505}}</ref>

Proponents of this practice argue that the pharmaceutical industry is only providing the public with information about its options and that actual [[Medical prescription|prescription]] is a matter to be discussed between patient and doctor. Opponents, however, claim that this approach leads to the unnecessary prescription of drugs, that its motivation is primarily or only to profit the drug companies, and that it may actually harm instead of help patients.<ref name=Moynihan1/>

A 2006 [[Newcastle, New South Wales]] international conference, reported in ''[[PLoS Medicine]]'', explored the phenomenon of disease mongering.<ref name=PLoS2006>{{cite web | author = Moynihan R, Henry D (eds). | title = A Collection of Articles on Disease Mongering. | work = PLoS medicine, 2006.| url = http://collections.plos.org/diseasemongering-2006.php | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> Journalist [[Ray Moynihan]] satirised disease mongering in a ''[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]]'' "news" item that appeared in its [[April Fool's Day]] edition 2006, titled "Scientists find new disease: motivational deficiency disorder".<ref name=Moynihan2>{{cite journal | author = Moynihan R| title = Scientists find new disease: motivational deficiency disorder. | journal = BMJ | year = 2006 | volume = 332 | pages = p. 745 | url = http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/extract/332/7544/745-a| doi = 10.1136/bmj.332.7544.745-a | issue = 7544|quote= [Neurologist Leth Argos and a team...] at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle in Australia]] say that in severe cases motivational deficiency disorder can be fatal, because the condition reduces the motivation to breathe.}}</ref>
