Several species of ''Cytomegalovirus'' have been identified and classified for different [[mammal]]s.<ref name="isbn0-521-82714-0"/> The most studied is ''Human cytomegalovirus'' (HCMV), which is also known as ''Human herpesvirus 5'' (HHV-5). Other primate CMV species include ''Chimpanzee cytomegalovirus'' (CCMV) that infects [[chimpanzee]]s and [[orangutan]]s, and ''Simian cytomegalovirus'' (SCCMV) and ''Rhesus cytomegalovirus'' (RhCMV) that infect [[macaque]]s; CCMV is known as both [http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/188763| ''Panine herpesvirus 2'' (PaHV-2) and ''Pongine herpesvirus-4'' (PoHV-4)], SCCMV is also called [http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/50292| ''Cercopithecine herpesvirus-5'' (CeHV-5)] and RhCMV is also called [http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/47929| ''Cercopithecine herpesvirus 8'' (CeHV-8)]. A further two viruses found in the [[night monkey]] are tentatively placed in the ''Cytomegalovirus'' genus, and are called ''Herpesvirus aotus 1'' and ''Herpesvirus aotus 3''.  Rodents also have viruses previously called cytomegaloviruses that are now reclassified under the genus ''[[Muromegalovirus]]''; this genus contains ''Mouse cytomegalovirus'' (MCMV) is also known as [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_004065 ''Murid herpesvirus 1'' (MuHV-1)] and the closely related ''Murid herpesvirus 2'' (MuHV-2) that is found in [[rat]]s. In addition, there many other viral species with the name ''Cytomegalovirus'' identified in distinct mammals that are as yet [http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/342596| not completely classified]; these were predominantly isolated from [[primate]]s and [[rodent]]s.

==HCMV==
{{main|human cytomegalovirus}}

'''''Human cytomegalovirus''''' is a [[species]] of [[virus]] that belongs to the viral family known as ''[[Herpesviridae]]'' or herpesviruses.  It is typically abbreviated as '''HCMV''' and is alternatively known as '''''Human herpesvirus 5''''' ('''HHV-5''').<ref name="Sherris" /> Within ''[[Herpesviridae]]'', HCMV belongs to the ''[[Betaherpesvirinae]]'' subfamily, which also includes cytomegaloviruses from other mammals.<ref name="isbn0-521-82714-0" />

Although they may be found throughout the body, HCMV infections are frequently associated with the [[salivary gland]]s.<ref name="isbn0-521-82714-0"/> HCMV infection is typically unnoticed in healthy people, but can be life-threatening for the [[immunocompromised]], such as [[HIV]]-infected persons, [[organ transplant]] recipients, or [[neonate|new born infants]].<ref name="Sherris" />  It can cause [[hydrops fetalis]] in infants. After infection, HCMV has an ability to remain [[Virus latency|latent]] within the body over long periods. CMV persists in the host because the viral genome encodes multiple proteins that interfere with [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] class I presentation of viral antigens. One viral protein blocks translocation of peptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, while two other viral proteins cause degradation of MHC class I proteins before they reach the cell surface.<ref>

A vaccine against cytomegalovirus (CMV) is currently under investigation. As a member of the [[TORCH complex]], cytomegalovirus can cause congenital infection. Because of this, there has been considerable effort made towards the development of a vaccine, with particular emphasis on protection for pregnant women.  Development of such a vaccine has been emphasized as a priority by the [[National Vaccine Program Office]] in the United States.  A phase 2 study of a CMV vaccine published in 2009 indicated an efficacy of 50%, thus the protection provided was limited and a number of subjects contracted CMV infection despite the vaccination. In one case also congenital CMV was encountered.<ref>{{cite journal|  author=Pass RF, Zhang C, Evans A, et al | title=Vaccine prevention of maternal cytomegalovirus infection|  journal=N Engl J Med |pmid=19297572|  year=2009|  volume=360|  issue=12|  pages=1191–9|  doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0804749|  pmc=2753425}}</ref>
