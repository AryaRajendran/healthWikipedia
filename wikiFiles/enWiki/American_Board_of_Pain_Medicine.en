Another initiative of ABPM is to develop a full–fledged pain medicine residency training program accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]].

== Maintenance of Certification program== 
The American Board of Pain Medicine eliminated lifetime certification in 1998.<ref name="about"/> Certificates issued after 1998 expire after 10 years, creating a 10-year recertification cycle. Concurrently, ABPM created the American Board of Pain Medicine MOC (Maintenance of Certification) program.<ref>American Board of Pain Medicine [http://abpm.org/uploads/files/2012recertification_bulletin.pdf "MOC® Examination Bulletin of Information"] Retrieved 6 January 2012.</ref>
