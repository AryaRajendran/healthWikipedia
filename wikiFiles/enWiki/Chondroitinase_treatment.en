'''Chondroitinase treatment''' is a treatment of [[proteoglycan]]s, a [[Glycoprotein|protein]] in the [[Interstitial fluid|fluid among cells]] where (among other things) they affect neural activity (communication, [[neuroplasticity|plasticity]]).<ref>Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair, School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair.  [http://www.brc.cam.ac.uk/Plasticity.htm Plasticity and the extracellular matrix.]</ref>  Chondroitinase treatment has been shown to allow adults vision to be restored as far as [[ocular dominance]] is concerned.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hensch TK |title=Critical period mechanisms in developing visual cortex |journal=Curr.
