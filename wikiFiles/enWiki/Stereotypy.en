A '''stereotypy''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|s|t|ɛr|iː|.|ɵ|t|aɪ|p|i}}) is a repetitive or ritualistic movement, posture, or utterance. Stereotypies may be simple movements such as body rocking, or complex, such as self-caressing, crossing and uncrossing of legs, and marching in place.  They are found in people with [[mental retardation]], [[autism spectrum disorder]]s, [[tardive dyskinesia]] and [[stereotypic movement disorder]];<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Jankovic J |title=Differential diagnosis and etiology of tics |journal=Adv Neurol |date=2001 |volume=85 |pages=15–29 |pmid=11530424}}</ref> studies have shown stereotypies associated with some types of [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Pedro BM, Pilowsky LS, Costa DC, ''et al.'' |title=Stereotypy, schizophrenia and dopamine D2 receptor binding in the basal ganglia |journal=Psychol Med |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=423–9 |year=1994 |month=May |pmid=8084937}}</ref> [[Frontotemporal dementia]] is also a common neurological cause of repetitive behaviors and stereotypies.<ref name="Mateen FJ, Josephs KA 2009 1237–40">{{cite journal |author=Mateen FJ, Josephs KA | title=The clinical spectrum of stereotypies in frontotemporal lobar degeneration | journal=Movement Disorders | volume=24 | issue=8 | pages=1237–40 | year=2009 | month=June | pmid=19412926 | doi=10.1002/mds.22555}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mendez MF, Shapira JS |title=The spectrum of recurrent thoughts and behaviors in frontotemporal dementia |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=202–8 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18323753 |url= http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1460}}</ref> Several causes have been hypothesized for stereotypy, and several treatment options are available.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Singer HS |title=Motor stereotypies |journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=77–81 |year=2009 |pmid=19501335 |doi=10.1016/j.spen.2009.03.008 }}</ref>

Stereotypy is sometimes called ''[[stimming]]'' in autism, under the hypothesis that it self-stimulates one or more senses.<ref name=Nind/> Related terms include ''punding'' and ''tweaking'' to describe repetitive behavior that is a side effect of some drugs.<ref name=Weisheit/>  

Among people with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, more than half (60%) had stereotypies. The time to onset of stereotypies in people with frontotemporal lobar degeneration may be years (average 2.1 years).<ref name="Mateen FJ, Josephs KA 2009 1237–40"/>

==Distinction from tics==
Like [[tic]]s, stereotypies are patterned and periodic, and are made worse by fatigue, stress, and anxiety. Unlike tics, stereotypies usually begin before the age of three, involve more of the body, are more rhythmic and less random, and are associated more with engrossment in another activity rather than premonitory urges. Examples of early tics are things like blinking and throat clearing, while arm flapping is a more common stereotypy.  Stereotypies do not have the ever-changing, waxing and waning nature of tics, and can remain constant for years. Tics are usually suppressible for brief periods; in contrast, children rarely consciously attempt to control a stereotypy, although they can be distracted from one.<ref name=Gilbert>{{vcite journal |author=Muthugovindan D, Singer H |title=Motor stereotypy disorders |journal=Curr Opin Neurol |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=131–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19532036 |doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e328326f6c8 }}</ref>

==Proposed causes==
There are several possible explanations for stereotypy, and different stereotyped behaviors may have different explanations. A popular explanation is [[stimming]], which hypothesizes that a particular stereotyped behavior has a function related to sensory input. Other explanations include hypotheses that stereotypy discharges tension or expresses frustration, that it communicates a need for attention or reinforcement or sensory stimulation, that it is learned or neuropathological or some combination of the two, or that it is normal behavior with no particular explanation needed.<ref name=Nind>{{vcite journal |author=Nind M, Kellett M |title=Responding to individuals with severe learning difficulties and stereotyped behaviour: challenges for an inclusive era |journal=Eur J Spec Needs Educ |date=2002 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=265–82 |doi=10.1080/08856250210162167 }}</ref>

==In animals==

<!--detail moved to Stereotypy (non-human)-->
Stereotypies also occur in non-human animals.  It is considered an [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behavior]] and is sometimes seen in [[Captivity (animal)|captive animals]], particularly those held in small enclosures with little opportunity to engage in more normal behaviors. These behaviors may be maladaptive, involving self-injury or reduced reproductive success, and in laboratory animals can confound behavioral research.<ref name="garner mason">{{vcite journal |title=Evidence for a relationship between cage stereotypies and behavioural disinhibition in laboratory rodents |author=Garner JP, Mason GJ |journal=Behav Brain Res |date=2002 |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=83–92 |doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(02)00111-0 |pmid=12385793 }}</ref>   Examples of stereotypical behaviors include pacing, rocking, swimming in circles, excessive sleeping, self-mutilation (including feather picking and excessive grooming), and mouthing cage bars. Stereotypies are seen in many species, including [[primate]]s, birds, and [[Carnivora|carnivore]]s. Up to 40% of elephants in zoos display stereotypical behaviors.<ref name="elephants">{{vcite news |title=Elephant deaths at zoos reignite animal debate |author=Stern A |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.elephants.com/media/MSNBC_2_28_05.htm |accessdate=2006-05-30 |date=2005-02-28 }}</ref> Stereotypies are well known in [[stable]]d  [[horse]]s, usually developing as a result of being confined, particularly with insufficient exercise. They are colloquially called [[stable vices]].  They present a [[horse care|management]] issue, not only leading to facility damage from chewing, kicking, and repetitive motion, but also lead to health consequences for the animal if not addressed.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/livestocksystems/DI8538.pdf  |author=Christie, Julie Christie, |title=Horse Behavior and Stable Vices| work = University of Minnesota Extension|year=2008 |publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota}}</ref>

Stereotypical behaviors are thought to be caused ultimately by artificial environments that do not allow animals to satisfy their normal behavioral needs. Rather than refer to the behavior as abnormal, it has been suggested that it be described as "behavior indicative of an abnormal environment."<ref name="primate newsletter">{{vcite journal |author=Davis E, Down N, Garner J ''et al'' |title=Stereotypical behavior: a LAREF discussion |url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Primate/lpn43-4.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Lab Primate Newsl |date=2004 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=3–4 |accessdate=2009-12-21 }}</ref> Stereotypies are correlated with altered behavioral response selection in the [[basal ganglia]].<ref name="garner mason" /> As stereotypies are frequently viewed as a sign of psychological distress in animals, there is also an [[animal welfare]] issue involved. 

Stereotypical behavior can sometimes be reduced or eliminated by [[environmental enrichment]], including larger and more stimulating enclosures, training, and introductions of stimuli (such as objects, sounds, or scents) to the animal's environment. The enrichment must be varied to remain effective for any length of time. Housing social animals with other members of their species is also helpful. But once the behavior is established, it is sometimes impossible to eliminate due to alterations in the brain.<ref name="primate newsletter" />
