'''Carl Heitzmann''' (2 October 1836 – 6 December 1896) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[pathologist]] and [[dermatologist]].

==Biography==
Heitzmann was born in [[Vinkovci]] (then [[Srijem County|Syrmia/Szerém/Srijem]], Slavonia, [[Kingdom of Hungary]], today [[Croatia]]).  His father, Martin Heitzmann, was a surgeon in the Austrian army. Carl Heitzmann studied medicine in [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]], earning his doctorate in 1859. After graduation, he furthered his studies in Vienna with [[Franz Schuh (physician)|Franz Schuh]] (1804–1864), [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra|Ferdinand Hebra]] (1816–1880), [[Salomon Stricker]] (1834–1898), and [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky|Carl Rokitansky]] (1804–1878). In Vienna, he performed lectures on morbid anatomy at the [[University of Vienna|university]].

When he was unable to succeed Rokitansky as the chair of pathology at Vienna, he emigrated to New York (1874). Here, he established a laboratory for microscopical research, and became one of the founders of the American Dermatological Association (ADA).

Heitzmann is credited for being the first physician to describe the precursor [[corpuscle]]s of [[red cells]], structures that he referred to as [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematoblasts]]. In 1872 he documented his findings in a treatise titled ''Studien am Knochen und Knorpel'', in which he mentions that his discovery of the hematoblast was in the [[bone marrow]] of an injured dog's leg.

==Works==
Heitzmann was a skilled [[illustrator]] and [[lithographer]], being renowned for his work with [[Watercolor painting|water color]]s. Among his artistic works are water color illustrations he created with [[Anton Elfinger]] (1821–1864) in Hebra's 1876 ''Atlas der Hautkrankheiten'' (Atlas of Skin Diseases).  Written works:
* ''Compendium der chirurgischen Pathologie und Therapie'', (Compendium of [[surgical pathology]] and therapy; 2 vols., 1864 & 1868)
* Descriptive and Topographical Anatomy of Man in 600 Illustrations, (2 volumes, third edition- 1886)
* ''Kenntniss der Dünndarmzotten” and “Untersuchungen über das Protoplasma'' in "Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Sciences", (Vienna, 1867–73)
* Microscopic Morphology of the Animal Body, (1873)
* Microscopic Studies of Inflammations of the Skin, in "Archives of Dermatology" (Philadelphia, 1879)
