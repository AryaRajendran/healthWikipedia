==History==

===1974–1983===
In 1974, Springfield Hospital Medical Center merged Wesson Women's Hospital to create the 672-bed Medical Center of Western Massachusetts. In 1976, the Medical Center of Western Massachusetts merged with Wesson Memorial Hospital. The merger established Baystate Medical Center, then the second-largest hospital in [[New England]], with 1,036 beds.

In 1983, [[Baystate Medical Center]] was reorganized into three separate corporations: Baystate Health Systems, the parent corporation now renamed Baystate Health; Baystate Medical Center; and the for-profit corporation Baystate Diversified Health Services. The reorganization provided a legal framework for developing a future multi-institutional health care system and for reducing the assets that would be encumbered with the financing of a major new hospital building.

===1986–2004===
In 1986, Baystate Franklin Medical Center in Greenfield joined Baystate Health; in 1991, Baystate Mary Lane Hospital in Ware joined the health system. In 1996, the Visiting Nurse Association & Hospice of Pioneer Valley, now renamed the Baystate Visiting Nurse Association & Hospice, became a member of Baystate Health.

To this end, a major corporate restructuring in 1997 reduced the number of governing boards across BH from twenty-one to six. On January 1, 2004, the governance structure of Baystate Health was further simplified with the establishment of a single board of trustees for Baystate Health that also serves as mirror boards for its patient care entities that had previously been governed by a separate board.

===The Hospital of the Future===

Baystate Medical Center built a visionary new facility to meet the [[Greater Springfield]] community’s needs. Hundreds of people—from patients to care providers to the community at large— shared ideas and experiences to design the {{convert|641,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, $300 million facility that includes: a heart and vascular center; new patient care units with private rooms; a new emergency department, which, at {{convert|70,000|sqft|m2}} in size is 3½ times the size of the current ED.  The new building includes also shell space for future growth. The so-called Hospital of the Future was officially dedicated on February 28, 2012. The Massachusetts Department of Health certified the new building in January 2012 and new patients will start to occupy the building in March 2012.<ref>http://www.cbs3springfield.com/news/local/Baystate-gets-the-OK-for-new-Emergency-Department----115747084.html</ref><ref>http://baystatehealth.com/Baystate/Main+Nav/About+Us/Hospital+of+the+Future</ref><ref>http://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2012/02/baystate_medical_center_hospital_of_the_future_designed.html</ref>
