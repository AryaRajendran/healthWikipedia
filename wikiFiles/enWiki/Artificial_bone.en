'''Artificial bone''' refers to [[bone]]-like material created in a laboratory that can be used in [[bone grafting|bone grafts]], to replace human bone that was lost due to severe fractures, disease, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arthroscopy.com/sp12013.htm|title=ARTIFICIAL BONE GRAFTS: PRO OSTEON}}</ref>

==Overview==

[[Bone]]s are rigid organs that serve various functions in the human body (or generally in [[vertebrate]]s), including mechanical support, protection of soft organs, [[blood]] production (from [[bone marrow]]), etc. Bone is a very complex tissue: strong, elastic, and self-repairing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/science/28angi.html?_r=1|title=Bone, a Masterpiece of Elastic Strength | work=The New York Times | first=Natalie | last=Angier | date=2009-04-28 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> 

Damaged bone can be replaced with bone from other parts of the body (autografts), from cadavers (allograft), or with various [[ceramics]] or metallic [[alloy]]s. The use of autografts limits how much bone is available, while the other options can result in rejection by the human body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h21762t6600735m6/|title=Clinical application of artificial bone in the maxillofacial region }}</ref> 

There has been much research towards creating artificial bone. Richard J. Lagow, at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], developed a way of creating a strong bone-like porous structure from bone powder, which, when introduced in the body, can allow the growth of [[blood vessels]], and which can be gradually replaced by natural bone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/health/topics/89/Artificial-bone.html|title=Artificial bone}}</ref> Research at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] has resulted in a metal-ceramic composite that has, like bone, a fine microstructure, and which may help create artificial bone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news10408.html|title=Secrets of the Sea Yield Stronger Artificial Bone}}</ref> A team of British scientists have developed "injectable bone", a soft substance which hardens in the body. They won the Medical Futures Innovation Award for their discovery, and it is planned to test this material in clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2422/injectable-liquid-bone-developed|title=Injectable artificial bone developed}}</ref>

Researchers at [[Columbia University]] have grown an anatomically correct [[human jawbone]] from [[stem cell]]s, though it was solid bone without the normal accessory tissues such as [[bone marrow]], [[cartilage]], or a connectable blood supply.<ref>{{cite news

The substitute bone has a porous structure permitting blood vessels and other accessory tissues to penetrate it, allowing seamless integration into the host bone. The process has been tested on [[sheep]], who showed no signs of [[transplant rejection|rejection]] after several months. <ref>{{cite news
