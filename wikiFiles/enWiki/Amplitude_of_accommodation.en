'''Amplitude of accommodation''' (AA) is a measurement of the [[human eye|eye]]â€™s ability to focus clearly on objects at near distances (i.e. [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]]). This eye focusing range for a child is usually about 5&ndash;7.5&nbsp;cm (2&ndash;3 inches). For a young adult, it is 10&ndash;15&nbsp;cm (4&ndash;6 inches). The focus range for a 45-year-old adult is about 50&nbsp;cm (20 inches). For an 80-year-old adult, it is 1.5 m (60 inches).<ref>[http://www.vision-therapy.com/Glossary_of_Terms.htm www.vision-therapy.com]</ref>

The average amplitude of accommodation, in [[diopters]], for a patient of a given age may be estimated by Hofstetter's formula: 18.5 - (0.30 * patient age in years). The minimum amplitude of accommodation can likewise be estimated by: 15 - (0.25 * age in years), and the maximum amplitude of accommodation can be estimated by 25 - (0.40 * age in years)." <ref>(Hofstetter, 1950.)</ref>
