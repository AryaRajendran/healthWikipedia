'''Gestational trophoblastic disease''' (GTD) is a term used for a group of pregnancy-related [[tumour|tumours]]. These tumours are rare, and they appear when cells in the womb start to grow out of control. The cells that form gestational trophoblastic tumours are called trophoblasts and come from tissue that grows to form the [[placenta]] during pregnancy.

There are several different types of GTD. [[Hydatidiform mole]]s are, in most cases, benign, but may, sometimes, develop into invasive moles, or, in rare cases, into [[choriocarcinoma]], which is likely to spread quickly,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seckl MJ, Sebire NJ, Berkowitz RS |title=Gestational trophoblastic disease |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9742 |pages=717–29 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20673583 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60280-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(10)60280-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lurain JR |title=Gestational trophoblastic disease I: epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation and diagnosis of gestational trophoblastic disease, and management of hydatidiform mole |journal=Am.

Gestational trophoblasts are of particular interest to cell biologists because, like cancer, these cells invade tissue (the uterus), but unlike cancer, they sometimes "know" when to stop.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

GTD can simulate pregnancy, because the uterus may contain fetal tissue, albeit abnormal. This tissue may grow at the same rate as a normal pregnancy, and produces chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone which is measured to monitor fetal well-being.<ref>Gestational trophoblastic disease: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. Chiang JW, Berek JS. In: UpToDate [Textbook of Medicine]. Basow, DS (Ed). Massachusetts Medical Society, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA, and Wolters Kluwer Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 2010.</ref>

While GTD overwhelmingly affects women of child-bearing age, it may rarely occur in postmenopausal women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chittenden B, Ahamed E, Maheshwari A |title=Choriocarcinoma in a postmenopausal woman |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=114 |issue=2 Pt 2 |pages=462–5 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19622962 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181aa97e7 }}</ref>

==Commonly used synonyms==
Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) may also be called gestational trophoblastic tumour (GTT).

Hydatidiform mole (one type of GTD) may also be called molar pregnancy.

Persistent disease; persistent GTD: If there is any evidence of persistence of GTD, usually defined as persistent elevation of beta hCG (see «Diagnosis» below), the condition may also be referred to as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).<ref>{{cite web |title=Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (Green-top 38) |date=2010-03-04 |work=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline 2010 |format=PDF |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GT38ManagementGestational0210.pdf}}</ref>

==Types==
GTD is the common name for five closely related tumours (one [[benign tumour]], and four [[malignant tumour|malignant tumours]]):<ref>Gestational trophoblastic disease: Pathology. Kindelberger DW, Baergen RN. In: UpToDate [Textbook of Medicine]. Basow, DS (Ed). Massachusetts Medical Society, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA, and Wolters Kluwer Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 2010.</ref>

* The benign tumour
** [[Hydatidiform mole]]

Here, first a fertilised egg implants into the uterus, but some cells around the fetus (the chorionic villi) do not develop properly. The pregnancy is not viable, and the normal pregnancy process turns into a benign tumour. There are two subtypes of hydatidiform mole: complete hydatidiform mole, and partial hydatidiform mole.

* The four malignant tumours
** Invasive mole
** [[Choriocarcinoma]]
** [[Placental site trophoblastic tumour]]
** Epithelioid trophoblastic tumour

All five closely related tumours develop in the placenta. All five tumours arise from trophoblastic cells. The [[trophoblast]] is the membrane that forms the wall of the [[blastocyst]] in the early development of the fetus. In a normal pregnancy, trophoblastic cells aid the implantation of the fertilised egg into the uterine wall. But in GTD, they develop into tumour cells.

==Incidence==
Overall, GTD is a rare disease. Nevertheless, the incidence of GTD varies greatly between different parts of the world. The reported incidence of hydatidiform mole ranges from 23 to 1299 cases per 100,000 pregnancies. The incidence of the malignant forms of GTD is much lower, only about 10% of the incidence of hydatidiform mole.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Altieri A, Franceschi S, Ferlay J, Smith J, La Vecchia C |title=Epidemiology and aetiology of gestational trophoblastic diseases |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=670–8 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14602247 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470204503012452 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(03)01245-2}}</ref> The reported incidence of GTD from Europe and North America is significantly lower than the reported incidence of GTD from Asia and South America.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Savage P, Williams J, Wong SL, ''et al.'' |title=The demographics of molar pregnancies in England and Wales from 2000-2009 |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=55 |issue=7–8 |pages=341–5 |year=2010 |pmid=20795349 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Soares PD, Maestá I, Costa OL, Charry RC, Dias A, Rudge MV |title=Geographical distribution and demographic characteristics of gestational trophoblastic disease |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=55 |issue=7–8 |pages=305–10 |year=2010 |pmid=20795343 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chauhan A, Dave K, Desai A, Mankad M, Patel S, Dave P |title=High-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia at Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute: thirteen years of experience |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=55 |issue=7–8 |pages=333–40 |year=2010 |pmid=20795348 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kashanian M, Baradaran HR, Teimoori N |title=Risk factors for complete molar pregnancy: a study in Iran |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=54 |issue=10 |pages=621–4 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=20677481 }}</ref> One proposed reason for this great geographical variation is differences in healthy diet in the different parts of the world (e.g., carotene deficiency).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berkowitz RS, Cramer DW, Bernstein MR, Cassells S, Driscoll SG, Goldstein DP |title=Risk factors for complete molar pregnancy from a case-control study |journal=Am.

However, the incidence of rare diseases (such as GTD) is difficult to measure, because epidemiologic data on rare diseases is limited. Not all cases will be reported, and some cases will not be recognised. In addition, in GTD, this is especially difficult, because one would need to know all gestational events in the total population. Yet, it seems very likely that the estimated number of births that occur at home or outside of a hospital has been inflated in some reports.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Palmer JR |title=Advances in the epidemiology of gestational trophoblastic disease |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=155–62 |year=1994 |month=March |pmid=8035370 }}</ref>

==Risk Factors==
Two main risk factors increase the likelihood for the development of GTD: 1) The woman being under 20 years of age, or over 35 years of age, and 2) previous GTD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kohorn EI |title=Dynamic staging and risk factor scoring for gestational trophoblastic disease |journal=Int.

Although molar pregnancies affect women of all ages, women under 16 years of age have a six times higher risk of developing a molar pregnancy than those aged 16–40 years, and women 50 years of age or older have a one in three chance of having a molar pregnancy.<ref>http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Gestational-Trophoblastic-Disease-%28GTD%29.htm</ref>

Being from Asia/of Asian ethnicity is an important risk factor.<ref>http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Gestational-Trophoblastic-Disease-%28GTD%29.htm </ref>

The ABO blood groups of the parents appear to be a factor in choriocarcinoma development, i.e. women with blood group A have been shown to have a greater risk than blood group O women.

==Diagnosis==
Cases of GTD can be diagnosed through routine tests given during pregnancy, such as blood tests and ultrasound, or through tests done after miscarriage or abortion.<ref name="urlGestational Trophoblastic Tumors Treatment - National Cancer Institute">{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/gestationaltrophoblastic/Patient |title=Gestational Trophoblastic Tumors Treatment - National Cancer Institute |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-21}}</ref> Vaginal bleeding, enlarged uterus, pelvic pain or discomfort, and vomiting too much ([[hyperemesis]]) are the most common symptoms of GTD. But GTD also leads to elevated serum hCG ([[human chorionic gonadotropin]] hormone). Since pregnancy is by far the most common cause of elevated serum hCG, clinicians generally first suspect a pregnancy with a complication. However, in GTD, the beta subunit of hCG (beta hCG) is also always elevated. Therefore, if GTD is clinically suspected, serum beta hCG is also measured.

The initial clinical diagnosis of GTD should be confirmed histologically, which can be done after the evacuation of pregnancy (see «Treatment» below) in women with hydatidiform mole.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sebire NJ |title=Histopathological diagnosis of hydatidiform mole: contemporary features and clinical implications |journal=Fetal Pediatr Pathol |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=2010 |pmid=20055560 |doi=10.3109/15513810903266138 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15513810903266138}}</ref> However, malignant GTD is highly vascular. If malignant GTD is suspected clinically, biopsy is contraindicated, because biopsy may cause life threatening haemorrhage.

==Treatment==
Treatment is always necessary.

The treatment for hydatidiform mole consists of the evacuation of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerulath AH, Ehlen TG, Bessette P, Jolicoeur L, Savoie R |title=Gestational trophoblastic disease |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol Can |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=434–46 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=12196865 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lurain JR |title=Gestational trophoblastic disease II: classification and management of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia |journal=Am.

The treatment for invasive mole or choriocarcinoma generally is the same. Both are usually treated with chemotherapy.

Their treatment usually includes chemotherapy. [[Radiotherapy]] can also be given to places where the cancer has spread, e.g. the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lurain JR, Singh DK, Schink JC |title=Management of metastatic high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: FIGO stages II-IV: risk factor score > or &amp;#61; 7 |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=55 |issue=5–6 |pages=199–207 |year=2010 |pmid=20626175 }}</ref>

Women who undergo chemotherapy are advised not to conceive for one year after completion of treatment. These women also are likely to have an earlier menopause. It has been estimated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists that the age at menopause for women who receive single agent chemotherapy is advanced by 1 year, and by 3 years for women who receive multi agent chemotherapy.

==Follow up==
Follow up is necessary in all women with gestational trophoblastic disease, because of the possibility of persistent disease, or because of the risk of developing malignant uterine invasion or malignant metastatic disease even after treatment in some women with certain risk factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kohorn EI |title=Long-term outcome of placental-site trophoblastic tumours |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9683 |pages=6–7 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19552947 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60791-1 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(09)60791-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoekstra AV, Lurain JR, Rademaker AW, Schink JC |title=Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: treatment outcomes |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=112 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=251–8 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18669719 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817f58ae }}</ref>

The use of a reliable contraception method is very important during the entire follow up period, because the follow-up depends on measuring hCG. If a reliable contraception method is not used during the follow-up, there can be great confusion if hCG rises: Why did it rise? Because the patient became pregnant again? Or because the gestational trophoblastic disease is still present? Therefore, during the prescribed follow up period, the patients must not become pregnant.

In women who have a malignant form of GTD, hCG concentrations stay the same (plateau) or they rise. Persistent elevation of serum hCG levels after a non molar pregnancy (i.e., normal pregnancy [term pregnancy], or preterm pregnancy, or [[ectopic pregnancy]] [pregnancy taking place in the wrong place, usually in the fallopian tube], or abortion) always indicate persistent GTD (very frequently due to choriocarcinoma or placental site trophoblastic tumour), but this is not common, because treatment mostly is successful.

In rare cases, a previous GTD may be reactivated after a subsequent pregnancy, even after several years. Therefore, the hCG tests should be performed also after any subsequent pregnancy in all women who had had a previous GTD (6 and 10 weeks after the end of any subsequent pregnancy).

==Which other women should also undergo hCG testing==
Women with persistent abnormal vaginal bleeding after any pregnancy, and women developing acute respiratory or neurological symptoms after any pregnancy, should also undergo hCG testing, because these may be signs of a hitherto undiagnosed GTD.

==Prognosis and staging==
Women with a hydatidiform mole have an excellent prognosis.

Also women with a malignant form of GTD usually have a very good prognosis.

Choriocarcinoma, for example, is an uncommon, yet almost always curable cancer. Although choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumour and a life threatening disease, it is very sensitive to chemotherapy. Virtually all women with non-metastatic disease are cured and retain their fertility; the prognosis is also very good for those with metastatic (spreading) cancer, in the early stages, but fertility may be lost. [[Hysterectomy]] (surgical removal of the uterus) can also be offered<ref name="pmid17086805">{{cite journal |author=Lurain JR, Singh DK, Schink JC |title=Role of surgery in the management of high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia |journal=The Journal of reproductive medicine |volume=51 |issue=10 |pages=773–6 |year=2006 |pmid=17086805 |doi=}}</ref> to patients > 40 years of age or those for whom sterilisation is not an obstacle.

In this scoring system, women with a score of 7 or greater are considered at high risk.

It is very important for malignant forms of GTD to be discovered in time. In Western countries, women with molar pregnancies are followed carefully; for instance, in the UK, all women who have had a molar pregnancy are registered at the National Trophoblastic Screening Centre. <ref>http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Molar-pregnancy/Pages/Introduction.aspx</ref> There are efforts in this direction in the developing countries too, and there have been improvements in these countries in the early detection of choriocarcinoma, thereby significantly reducing the mortality rate also in  developing countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Izhar R, Aziz-un-Nisa |title=Prognosis of gestational choriocarcinoma at Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar |journal=J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=45–8 |year=2003 |pmid=14552249 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yang JJ, Xiang Y, Wan XR, Yang XY |title=Prognosis of malignant gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: 20 years of experience |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=600–7 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18773625 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lok CA, Ansink AC, Grootfaam D, van der Velden J, Verheijen RH, ten Kate-Booij MJ |title=Treatment and prognosis of post term choriocarcinoma in The Netherlands |journal=Gynecol.

==Becoming pregnant again==
Most women with GTD can become pregnant again and can have children again. The risk of a further molar pregnancy is low. More than 98% of women who become pregnant following a molar pregnancy will not have a further hydatidiform mole or be at increased risk of complications.

In the past, it was seen as important not to get pregnant straight away after a GTD. Specialists recommended a waiting period of 6 months after the hCG levels become normal. Recently, this standpoint has been questioned. New medical data suggest that a significantly shorter waiting period after the hCG levels become normal is reasonable for approximately 97% of the patients with hydatidiform mole.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfberg AJ, Feltmate C, Goldstein DP, Berkowitz RS, Lieberman E |title=Low risk of relapse after achieving undetectable HCG levels in women with complete molar pregnancy |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=551–4 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15339768 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000136099.21216.45 }}</ref>

==Risk of a repeat GTD==
The risk of a repeat GTD is approximately 1 in 100, compared with approximately 1 in 1000 risk in the general population. Especially women whose hCG levels remain significantly elevated are at risk of developing a repeat GTD.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Garrett LA, Garner EI, Feltmate CM, Goldstein DP, Berkowitz RS |title=Subsequent pregnancy outcomes in patients with molar pregnancy and persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia |journal=J Reprod Med |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=481–6 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18720922 }}</ref>

==Persistent trophoblastic disease==
The term «persistent trophoblastic disease» (PTD) is used when after treatment of a molar pregnancy, some molar tissue is left behind and again starts growing into a tumour. Although PTD can spread within the body like a malignant cancer, the overall cure rate is nearly 100%.

In the vast majority of patients, treatment of PTD consist of chemotherapy. Only about 10% of patients with PTD can be treated successfully with a second curettage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Trommel NE, Massuger LF, Verheijen RH, Sweep FC, Thomas CM |title=The curative effect of a second curettage in persistent trophoblastic disease: a retrospective cohort survey |journal=Gynecol.

==GTD coexisting with a normal fetus, a so called «twin pregnancy»==
In some very rare cases, a GTD can coexist with a normal fetus. This is called a «twin pregnancy». These cases should be managed only by experienced clinics, after extensive consultation with the patient. Because successful term delivery might be possible, the pregnancy should be allowed to proceed if the mother wishes, following appropriate counselling. The probability of achieving a healthy baby is approximately 40%, but there is a risk of complications, e.g. [[pulmonary embolism]] and [[pre-eclampsia]]. Compared with women who simply had a GTD in the past, there is no increased risk of developing persistent GTD after such a twin pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee SW, Kim MY, Chung JH, Yang JH, Lee YH, Chun YK |title=Clinical findings of multiple pregnancy with a complete hydatidiform mole and coexisting fetus |journal=J Ultrasound Med |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=271–80 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20103799 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Suri S, Davies M, Jauniaux E |title=Twin pregnancy presenting as a praevia complete hydatidiform mole and coexisting fetus complicated by a placental abscess |journal=Fetal.

==Etiology==
Hydatidiform moles are abnormal conceptions with excessive placental development. Conception takes place, but placental tissue grows very fast, rather than supporting the growth of a fetus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lipata F, Parkash V, Talmor M, ''et al.'' |title=Precise DNA genotyping diagnosis of hydatidiform mole |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=784–94 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20308840 |doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181d489ec }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Alifrangis C, Seckl MJ |title=Genetics of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: an update for the clinician |journal=Future Oncol |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=1915–23 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21142864 |doi=10.2217/fon.10.153 |url=http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/fon.10.153?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Azuma C, Saji F, Tokugawa Y, ''et al.'' |title=Application of gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction to genetic analysis of molar mitochondrial DNA: the detection of anuclear empty ovum as the cause of complete mole |journal=Gynecol.

Complete hydatidiform moles have no fetal tissue and no maternal DNA. A single sperm duplicates and this duplicated sperm fertilises an empty ovum, or, two sperms fertilise an empty ovum (dispermic fertilisation). An empty ovum is a maternal egg which has no functional maternal DNA.

Partial hydatidiform moles have a fetus or fetal cells. They are triploid in origin, i.e. one set of maternal haploid genes and two sets of paternal haploid genes. They almost always occur following dispermic fertilisation of a normal ovum (fertilisation of one egg by two sperm).

Malignant forms of GTD are very rare. About 50% of malignant forms of GTD develop from a hydatidiform mole.

** Exaggerated placental site
** [[Placental site nodule]]

Both are composed of intermediate trophoblast, but their morphological features and clinical presentation can differ significantly.

Exaggerated placental site is a benign, non cancerous lesion with an increased number of implantation site intermediate trophoblastic cells that infiltrate the [[endometrium]] and the underlying [[myometrium]]. An exaggerated placental site may occur with normal pregnancy, or after an abortion. No specific treatment or follow up is necessary.

Placental site nodules are lesions of chorionic type intermediate trophoblast, usually small. 40 to 50% of placental site nodules are found in the [[cervix]]. They almost always are incidental findings after a surgical procedure. No specific treatment or follow up is necessary.
