'''Relapse prevention''' is a [[cognitive-behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] approach with the goal of identifying and preventing high-risk situations such as substance abuse, obsessive-compulsive behavior, sexual offending, obesity, and depression.<ref name="Marlatt">Witkiewitz, K. & Marlatt, G.A. (2004). Relapse Prevention for Alcohol and Drug Problems. American Psychologist, 59, 4, 224-235.</ref>  Furthermore, relapse prevention is an important component in the treatment process of [[alcoholism]], or [[alcohol dependence]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Larimer|first=Mary E.|coauthors=Palmer, Rebekka S.; Marlatt, G.

==Underlying assumptions==
Relapse is seen as both an outcome and as a transgression in the process of behavior change. An initial setback, or [[lapse]], may either translate into a return to the previous problematic behavior, known as [[relapse]], or into the individual turning again towards positive change, called prolapse<!--do not wikify without checking destination-->.<ref name="Marlatt"/>

Relapse is thought to be multi-determined, especially by self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation, coping, emotional states, and interpersonal factors. In particular, high [[self-efficacy]], negative outcome [[Expectancy theory|expectancies]], potent availability of [[coping skills]] following treatment, positive [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], and functional [[social support]] are expected to predict positive outcome. Craving has not historically been shown to serve as a strong predictor.<ref name="Marlatt"/>

==Efficacy and effectiveness==
Carroll ''et al.''. conducted a review of 24 other trials and concluded that RP was more effective than no treatment and was equally effective as other active treatments such as [[supportive psychotherapy]] and [[interpersonal therapy]] in improving substance use outcomes. Irvin and colleagues also conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of RP techniques in the treatment of alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and polysubstance use, and on the basis of 26 studies reviewed, concluded RP was successful for reducing substance use and improving psychosocial adjustment. RP seemed to be most effective for individuals with alcohol problems, suggesting that certain characteristics of alcohol use are amenable to the RP <ref name="Marlatt"/>

==RP and systems theory==
Some theorists, including [[Katie Witkiewitz]] and [[G. Alan Marlatt]], borrowing ideas from [[systems theory]], conceptualize relapse as a multidimensional, [[complex system]]. Such a [[nonlinear]] [[dynamical system]] is believed to be able to best predict the data witnessed, which commonly includes cases where small changes introduced into the equation seem to have large effects. The model also introduces concepts of self-organization, feedback loops, timing/context effects, and interplay between tonic and phasic processes.<ref name="Marlatt"/>

Rami Jumnoodoo and Dr. Patrick Coyne, in London UK,  have been working with [[National Health Service]] users and carers over the past ten years to transfer RP theory into the field of adult mental health.  The uniqueness of the model is the sustainment of change by developing service users and carers as 'experts' - following RP as an educational process and graduating as Relapse Prevention Practitioners.  The work has won many national awards, been presented at many conferences and has resulted in a number of publications [see www.drchange.net for references].{{cn|date=January 2011}}
