'''Nystagmus''' {{IPA-en|nɪˈstæɡməs|}} is a condition of involuntary<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zahn JR |title=Incidence and characteristics of voluntary nystagmus |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg.

There are two key forms of nystagmus: pathological and physiological, with variations within each type. Nystagmus may be caused by [[congenital disorder]]s, [[Acquired disorder|acquired]] or [[central nervous system]] disorders, [[toxicity]], [[pharmaceutical drug]]s or [[alcohol]]. Previously considered untreatable, in recent years several pharmaceutical drugs have been identified for treatment of nystagmus. Nystagmus is occasionally associated with [[vertigo]].

==Diagnosis==
Nystagmus is very noticeable but rarely recognized. Nystagmus can be clinically investigated by using a number of [[non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] standard tests. The simplest one is the [[caloric reflex test]], in which one [[external auditory meatus]] is irrigated with warm or cold water or air. The temperature gradient provokes the stimulation of the [[horizontal semicircular canal]] and the consequent nystagmus.

The resulting movement of the eyes may be recorded and quantified by special devices called [[electronystagmograph]] (ENG), a form of [[electrooculography]] (an electrical method of measuring eye movements using external [[electrodes]]),<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17982846 |year=2007 |last1=Markley |first1=BA |title=Introduction to electronystagmography for END technologists |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=178–89 |journal=American Journal of Electroneurodiagnostic Technology}}</ref> or even less invasive devices called [[Videonystagmography|videonystagmograph]] (VNG),<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14526552 |year=2003 |last1=Mosca |first1=F |last2=Sicignano |first2=S |last3=Leone |first3=CA |title=Benign positional paroxysmal vertigo: videonystagmographic study using rotatory test |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=67–72 |journal=Acta Otorhinolaryngologica Italica}}</ref> a form of [[video-oculography]] (VOG) (a video-based method of measuring eye movements using external small cameras built into head masks) by an [[audiologist]]. Special swinging chairs with electrical controls can be used to induce rotatory nystagmus.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17314477 |year=2007 |last1=Eggert |first1=T |title=Eye movement recordings: methods |volume=40 |pages=15–34 |doi=10.1159/0000100347 |journal=Developments in Ophthalmology}}</ref>

Over the past forty years objective eye movement recording techniques have been applied to the study of nystagmus, and the results have led to a greater accuracy and understanding of the condition.

[[Orthoptist]]s may also use an [[optokinetic drum]], or [[electrooculography]] to assess their eye movements.

Nystagmus can be caused by subsequent [[Foveal|foveation]] of moving objects, [[pathology]], sustained rotation or [[substance abuse|substance use]]. Nystagmus is not to be confused with other superficially similar-appearing disorders of eye movements ([[Saccade|saccadic]] oscillations) such as [[opsoclonus]] or [[ocular flutter]] that are composed purely of fast-phase (saccadic) eye movements, while nystagmus is characterised by the combination of a smooth pursuit, which usually acts to take the eye off the point of regard, interspersed with the saccadic movement that serves to bring the eye back on target. Without the use of objective recording techniques, it may be very difficult to distinguish between these conditions.

In [[medicine]], the presence of nystagmus can be [[benign]], or it can indicate an underlying visual or [[neurology|neurological problem]].<ref name="pmid12438459">{{cite journal |author=Serra A, Leigh RJ |title=Diagnostic value of nystagmus: spontaneous and induced ocular oscillations |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=615–8 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12438459 |pmc=1757336 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.73.6.615}}</ref>

===Pathologic nystagmus===
Pathologic nystagmus is characterized by a biphasic ocular oscillation alternating a slow eye movement, or [[smooth pursuit]], in one direction and a fast eye movement, or saccadic movement, in the other direction. The velocity of the slow phase eye velocity (SPEV) and the fast phase eye velocity (FPEV) are related to each other and can be considered as a measurement of the efficiency of the system stimulus/response.<ref>Angelo Salami, Massimo Dellepiane, Edoardo Cervoni, Giancarlo Mascetti. Temporal analysis of the vestibular and optokinetic nystagmus. Volume 1240, October 2003, Pages 1333-1337. Oto-Rhino-Laryngology. Proceedings of the XVII World Congress of the International Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (IFOS).</ref>

When nystagmus occurs without fulfilling its normal function, it is pathologic (deviating from the healthy or normal condition). Pathological nystagmus is the result of damage to one or more components of the [[vestibular system]], including the [[semicircular canal]]s, [[otolith]] organs, and the [[cerebellum|vestibulocerebellum]].

Pathological nystagmus generally causes a degree of [[vision impairment]], although the severity of such impairment varies widely. Also, many [[Blindness|blind]] people have nystagmus, which is one reason that some wear dark glasses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/N/nystagmus.html |title=nystagmus |accessdate = 2007-06-07 |work=}}</ref>

====Variations====
*'''Central nystagmus''' occurs as a result of either normal or abnormal processes not related to the vestibular organ. For example, lesions of the midbrain or cerebellum can result in up- and down-beat nystagmus.
*'''Peripheral nystagmus''' occurs as a result of either normal or diseased functional states of the vestibular system and may combine a rotational component with vertical or horizontal eye movements and may be ''spontaneous'', ''positional'', or ''evoked''.
**'''Gaze Induced nystagmus''' occurs or is exacerbated as a result of changing one's gaze toward or away from a particular side which has an affected vestibular apparatus.
**'''Positional nystagmus''' occurs when a person's head is in a specific position.<ref name="pmid16705203">{{cite journal |pages=790–2 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2005.084624 |title=Positional nystagmus and vertigo due to a solitary brachium conjunctivum plaque |year=2006 |last1=Anagnostou |first1=E |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=77 |issue=6}}</ref> An example of disease state in which this occurs is [[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] (BPPV).
**'''Post rotational nystagmus''' occurs after an imbalance is created between a normal side and a diseased side by stimulation of the vestibular system by rapid shaking or rotation of the head.
**'''Spontaneous nystagmus''' is nystagmus that occurs randomly, regardless of the position of the patient's head.

===Physiological nystagmus===
Physiological nystagmus is a form of involuntary [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]] that is part of the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR), characterized by alternating [[smooth pursuit]] in one direction and [[saccadic movement]] in the other direction.

====Variations====
The direction of nystagmus is defined by the direction of its quick phase (''e.g.'' a '''right-beating nystagmus''' is characterized by a rightward-moving quick phase, and a '''left-beating nystagmus''' by a leftward-moving quick phase). The [[oscillations]] may occur in the vertical,<ref name="pmid15872015">{{cite journal |author=Pierrot-Deseilligny C, Milea D |title=Vertical nystagmus: clinical facts and hypotheses |journal=Brain |volume=128 |issue=Pt 6 |pages=1237–46 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15872015 |doi=10.1093/brain/awh532}}</ref> horizontal or torsional planes, or in any combination. The resulting nystagmus is often named as a gross description of the movement, ''e.g.'' '''downbeat nystagmus''', '''upbeat nystagmus''', '''seesaw nystagmus''', '''periodic alternating nystagmus'''.

These descriptive names can be misleading however, as many were assigned historically, solely on the basis of subjective clinical examination, which is not sufficient to determine the eyes' true trajectory.
* '''Opticokinetic nystagmus'''; a nystagmus induced by looking at moving visual stimuli, such as moving horizontal or vertical lines, and/or stripes. For example, if one fixates on a stripe of a rotating drum with alternating black and white, the gaze retreats to fixate on a new stripe as the drum moves. This is first a rotation with the same angular velocity, then returns in a [[saccade]] in the opposite direction. The process proceeds indefinitely. This is optokinetic nystagmus, and is a source for understanding the [[fixation reflex]].<ref name="nystagmus"/>
* '''Postrotatory nystagmus'''; if one spins in a chair continuously and stops suddenly, the fast phase of nystagmus is in the opposite direction of rotation, known as the "post-rotatory nystagmus", while slow phase is in the direction of rotation.<ref name="nystagmus">"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye" vol. 27, p. 179 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1987</ref>

==Causes==
The cause for pathological nystagmus may be [[congenital]], [[idiopathic]], or secondary to a pre-existing [[neurological disorder]]. It also may be induced temporarily by disorientation (such as on roller coaster rides) or by certain [[psychoactive drug|drug]]s ([[alcohol]] and other [[central nervous system]] depressants, inhalant drugs, [[stimulant]]s, [[psychedelic drug]]s, and [[dissociative]] drugs).

===Early-onset nystagmus===
Early onset nystagmus occurs more frequently than acquired nystagmus. It can be insular or accompany other disorders (such as micro-ophthalmic anomalies or [[Down Syndrome]]). Early-onset nystagmus itself is usually mild and non-progressive. The affected persons are not normally aware of their spontaneous eye movements, but vision can be impaired depending on the severity of the movements.

Types of early-onset nystagmus include the following:
*Infantile:
**[[Albinism]]
**[[Aniridia]]
**Bilateral [[congenital cataract]]
**Bilateral [[optic nerve hypoplasia]]
**[[Idiopathic]]
**[[Leber's congenital amaurosis]]
**[[Optic nerve]] or [[macula]]r disease
**[[Persistent tunica vasculosa lentis]]
**[[Rod monochromatism]]
** [[Visual-motor syndrome of functional monophthalmos]]
*Latent nystagmus
*[[Noonan syndrome]]
*Nystagmus blockage syndrome

X-linked infantile nystagmus is associated with mutations of the gene [[FRMD7]], which is located on the [[X chromosome]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=187–91 |doi=10.1080/13816810701651233 |title=A Review of the Molecular Genetics of Congenital Idiopathic Nystagmus (CIN) |year=2007 |last1=Self |first1=James |last2=Lotery |first2=Andrew |journal=Ophthalmic Genetics |volume=28 |issue=4 |pmid=18161616}}</ref><ref name="pmid18431453">{{cite journal |pmid=18431453 |pmc=2324116 |year=2008 |last1=Li |first1=N |last2=Wang |first2=L |last3=Cui |first3=L |last4=Zhang |first4=L |last5=Dai |first5=S |last6=Li |first6=H |last7=Chen |first7=X |last8=Zhu |first8=L |last9=Hejtmancik |first9=JF |title=Five novel mutations of the FRMD7 gene in Chinese families with X-linked infantile nystagmus |volume=14 |pages=733–8 |journal=Molecular vision}}</ref>

Infantile nystagmus is also associated with two X-linked eye diseases known as complete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) and incomplete CSNB (iCSNB or CSNB-2), which are caused by mutations of one of two genes located on the X chromosome. In CSNB, mutations are found in NYX ([[nyctalopin]]).<ref>{{cite journal |pages=627–8 |doi=10.1016/j.exer.2005.07.017 |title=Focus on Molecules: Nyctalopin |year=2005 |last1=Poopalasundaram |first1=S |last2=Erskine |first2=L |last3=Cheetham |first3=M |last4=Hardcastle |first4=A |journal=Experimental Eye Research |volume=81 |issue=6 |pmid=16157331}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=692–6 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2008.143727 |title=A common NYX mutation in Flemish patients with X linked CSNB |year=2008 |last1=Leroy |first1=B P |last2=Budde |first2=B S |last3=Wittmer |first3=M |last4=De Baere |first4=E |last5=Berger |first5=W |last6=Zeitz |first6=C |journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=93 |issue=5 |pmid=18617546}}</ref> CSNB-2 involves mutations of CACNA1F, a [[voltage-gated calcium channel]] that, when mutated, does not conduct ions.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=335–45 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.09.021 |title=Functional analysis of congenital stationary night blindness type-2 CACNA1F mutations F742C, G1007R, and R1049W |year=2007 |last1=Peloquin |first1=J.B. |last2=Rehak |first2=R. |last3=Doering |first3=C.J. |last4=McRory |first4=J.E. |journal=Neuroscience |volume=150 |issue=2 |pmid=17949918}}</ref>

===Alcohol===
{{Main|Positional alcohol nystagmus}}

In the United States, testing for ''horizontal gaze nystagmus'' is one of a battery of [[Drunk driving (United States)#Field sobriety tests|field sobriety tests]] used by [[police]] officers to determine whether a suspect is [[driving under the influence]] of [[alcohol]]. The test involves observation of the suspect's [[pupil]] as it follows a moving object, noting
# lack of smooth pursuit,
# distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and
# the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees.

The field sobriety test studies published by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] have never been peer reviewed.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2013}}

The horizontal gaze nystagmus test has been highly criticized and major errors in the testing methodology and analysis found.<ref name="pmid15270451">{{cite journal |author=Booker JL |title=The Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test: fraudulent science in the American courts |journal=Science & Justice |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=133–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15270451|doi=10.1016/S1355-0306(04)71705-0}}</ref><ref name="pmid11393940">{{cite journal |author=Booker JL |title=End-position nystagmus as an indicator of ethanol intoxication |journal=Science & Justice |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=113–6 |year=2001|pmid=11393940 |doi=10.1016/S1355-0306(01)71862-X}}</ref> However, the validity of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test for use as a field sobriety test for persons with a [[Blood alcohol content|blood alcohol level]] between 0.04–0.08 is supported by peer reviewed studies and has been found to be a more accurate indication of blood alcohol content than other standard field sobriety tests.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McKnight AJ, Langston EA, McKnight AS, Lange JE |title=Sobriety tests for low blood alcohol concentrations |journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=305–11 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11939359|doi=10.1016/S0001-4575(01)00027-6}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Congenital nystagmus has traditionally been viewed as non-treatable, but medications have been discovered in recent years that show promise in some patients. In 1980, researchers discovered that a drug called [[baclofen]] could effectively stop periodic alternating nystagmus. Subsequently, [[gabapentin]], an anticonvulsant, was found to cause improvement in about half the patients who received it to relieve symptoms of nystagmus. Other drugs found to be effective against nystagmus in some patients include [[memantine]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17764629 |year=2007 |last1=Corbett |first1=J |title=Memantine/Gabapentin for the treatment of congenital nystagmus |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=395–6 |journal=Current neurology and neuroscience reports |doi=10.1007/s11910-007-0061-z}}</ref> [[levetiracetam]], 3,4-diaminopyridine, [[4-Aminopyridine|4-aminopyridine]], and [[acetazolamide]].<ref name=Groves2006>{{cite journal |last=Groves |first=Nancy |title=Many options to treat nystagmus, more in development |journal=Ophthalmology Times |date=March 15, 2006 |url=http://www.ophthalmologytimes.com/ophthalmologytimes/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=313686&ref=25}}</ref> Several therapeutic approaches, such as [[contact lenses]],<ref name="pmid14742616">{{cite journal |pages=314–6 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.010678 |pmc=1738913 |title=The use of contact lenses to treat visually symptomatic congenital nystagmus |year=2004 |last1=Biousse |first1=V |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=2 |pmid=14742616 |last2=Tusa |first2=RJ |last3=Russell |first3=B |last4=Azran |first4=MS |last5=Das |first5=V |last6=Schubert |first6=MS |last7=Ward |first7=M |last8=Newman |first8=NJ}}</ref> drugs, [[surgery]], and [[low vision]] [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] have also been proposed.

Clinical trials of a surgery to treat nystagmus (known as tenotomy) concluded in 2001. Tenotomy is being performed regularly at the University of Pittsburgh Children's Hospital and by a handful of surgeons around the world. The surgery developed by Louis F. Dell'Osso Ph.D. aims to reduce the eye shaking (oscillations), which in turn tends to improve visual acuity.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[Acupuncture]] has also been shown in some studies to have beneficial effects on the symptoms of nystagmus. These benefits have been seen in treatments where acupuncture points of the neck were used, specifically points on the [[sternocleidomastoid]] muscle.<ref>Ishikawa, S., et al. (1987). Treatment of nystagmus by acupuncture. Highlights in neuro-ophthalmology, 6th ed. pg 227–232.</ref><ref name=Blekher1998>Blekher, T. (1998).

By the standards of [[:Evidence-based medicine]], the quality of these studies can be considered poor (for example, Ishikawa has a study sample size of just six, is unblinded and without proper control), and given high quality studies showing that acupuncture has no effect beyond placebo, the results of these studies have to be considered clinically irrelevant until higher quality studies are produced.

==Epidemiology==
Nystagmus is a relatively common clinical condition, affecting one in several thousand people. A survey conducted in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom found that by the age of two, one in every 670 children had manifested nystagmus.<ref name=ANN/> Authors of another study in the United Kingdom estimated an incidence of 24 in 10,000 (~0.240&nbsp;%), noting an apparently higher rate amongst white Europeans than in individuals of Asian origin.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=5201–6 |doi=10.1167/iovs.09-3486 |title=The Prevalence of Nystagmus: The Leicestershire Nystagmus Survey |year=2009 |last1=Sarvananthan|first1=N. |last2=Surendran |first2=M. |last3=Roberts |first3=E.
