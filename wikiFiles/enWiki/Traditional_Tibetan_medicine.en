'''Traditional Tibetan medicine''' is a centuries-old traditional medical system that employs a complex approach to diagnosis, incorporating techniques such as pulse analysis and [[urinalysis]], and utilizes behavior and dietary modification, medicines composed of natural materials (e.g., herbs and minerals) and physical therapies (e.g. Tibetan acupuncture, [[moxabustion]], etc.) to treat illness.

The Tibetan medical system is based upon a synthesis of the Indian ([[Ayurveda]]), Persian ([[Unani]]), Greek, indigenous Tibetan, and Chinese medical systems, and it continues to be practiced in [[Tibet]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], [[Siberia]], [[China]] and [[Mongolia]], as well as more recently in parts of Europe and North America.  It embraces the traditional [[Buddhist]] belief that all illness ultimately results from the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]] of the mind: ignorance, attachment and aversion. Tibetan medicine follows the Buddha's [[Four Noble Truths]] which apply medical diagnostic logic to suffering.<ref name=Cards>{{cite book|last=Gyamtso|first=Sangye|title=Tibetan Medicine Cards: Illustrations and Text from the Blue Beryl Treatise of Sangye Gyamtso (1653-1705)|publisher=Pomegranate Communications|isbn=978-0764917615|pages=32|url=http://www.amazon.com/Tibetan-Medicine-Cards-Illustrations-1653-1705/dp/0764917617/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361142054&sr=8-1&keywords=tibetan+medicine+cards|chapter=Intro card}}</ref>

== History ==
The Tibetans obtained their first knowledge of medicine from China during the reign of [[Namri Songtsen|Namri Songsten]], who died in 630.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XVHOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA5826&dq=sixth+century+the+tibetans+obtained+their+first+knowledge+of+arithmetic+and+medicine+from+the+chinese&hl=en&ei=OOgNTsXSC6rx0gH_somqDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sixth%20century%20the%20tibetans%20obtained%20their%20first%20knowledge%20of%20arithmetic%20and%20medicine%20from%20the%20chinese&f=false|title=Americanized Encyclopædia Britannica: rev. and amended A dictionary of arts, sciences and literature, to which is added biographies of living subjects. 96 colored maps and numerous illustrations, Volume 9|author=|year=1890|publisher=Belford-Clarke co.|edition=|location=|page=5826|isbn=|accessdate=2011-07-01}}Americanized Encyclopædia Britannica: Rev. and Amended A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and Literature, to which is Added Biographies of Living Subjects. 96 Colored Maps and Numerous Illustrations</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-3saAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5826&dq=sixth+century+the+tibetans+obtained+their+first+knowledge+of+arithmetic+and+medicine+from+the+chinese&hl=en&ei=OOgNTsXSC6rx0gH_somqDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=sixth%20century%20the%20tibetans%20obtained%20their%20first%20knowledge%20of%20arithmetic%20and%20medicine%20from%20the%20chinese&f=false|title=The home encyclopædia: compiled and revised to date from the leading encyclopædias, Volume 18|author=|year=1895|publisher=Educational publishing co.|edition=|location=|page=5826|isbn=|accessdate=2011-07-01}}The Home Encyclopædia: Compiled and Revised to Date from the Leading Encyclopædias</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dj0hAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA5826&dq=sixth+century+the+tibetans+obtained+their+first+knowledge+of+arithmetic+and+medicine+from+the+chinese&hl=en&ei=OOgNTsXSC6rx0gH_somqDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=sixth%20century%20the%20tibetans%20obtained%20their%20first%20knowledge%20of%20arithmetic%20and%20medicine%20from%20the%20chinese&f=false|title=Americanized Encyclopædia Britannica, revised and amended: A dictionary of arts, sciences and literature; to which is added biographies of livings subjects ...|author=|year=1890|publisher=The "Examiner"|edition=|location=|page=5826|isbn=|accessdate=2011-07-01}}Volume 9 of Americanized Encyclopædia Britannica, Revised and Amended: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and Literature; to which is Added Biographies of Livings Subjects</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uDQEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA926&dq=sixth+century+the+tibetans+obtained+their+first+knowledge+of+arithmetic+and+medicine+from+the+chinese&hl=en&ei=OOgNTsXSC6rx0gH_somqDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=sixth%20century%20the%20tibetans%20obtained%20their%20first%20knowledge%20of%20arithmetic%20and%20medicine%20from%20the%20chinese&f=false|title=The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 26|author=|editor=Hugh Chisholm|year=1911|publisher=At the University press|edition=11|location=|page=926|isbn=|accessdate=2011-07-01}}The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Hugh Chisholm</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ezZKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA345&dq=sixth+century+the+tibetans+obtained+their+first+knowledge+of+arithmetic+and+medicine+from+the+chinese&hl=en&ei=OOgNTsXSC6rx0gH_somqDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=sixth%20century%20the%20tibetans%20obtained%20their%20first%20knowledge%20of%20arithmetic%20and%20medicine%20from%20the%20chinese&f=false|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature, Volume 23|author=|editor=Thomas Spencer Baynes|year=1888|publisher=C.

However, the ascription of "rgyud bzhi" has been held in different opinions. Some scholars believe that rgyud bzhi was told by the [[Gautama Buddha|Lord Buddha]], while some believe it is the primary work of [[Yutog Yontan Gonpo|Yuthok Yontan Gonpo]] (708 AD).<ref>''Mirror of Beryl: A Historical Introduction to Tibetan Medicine Desi Sangye Gyatso'', translated by Gavin Kilty, Wisdom Publications 2009. ISBN 0-86171-467-9</ref> The former opinion is often refuted by saying "If it was told by the Lord Buddha, rgyud bzhi should have a [[Sanskrit]] version". However, there is no such version and also no Indian practitioners who have received unbroken lineage of rgyud bzhi. Thus, the later thought should be scholarly considered authentic and practical. The provenance is uncertain.

Youthog Yontag Gonopo adapted and synthesized the Four Tantras in the 12th Century. The Four Tantras are scholarly debated as having Indian origins or, Remedy Master Buddha Bhaisajyaguru's word or, authentically Tibetan with Chinese origins. It was not formally taught in schools at first but, intertwined with Tibetan Buddhism. The [[5th Dalai Lama]] supported [[Desi Sangye Gyatso]] to found the pioneering Chagpori College of Medicine in 1696. Chagpori taught Gyamtso's Bule Beryl as well as the Four Tantras in a model that spread throughout Tibet along with the oral tradition.<ref name=Cards />

==Four Tantras==

The Four Tantras is the common name for the text of the Secrete Tantra Instruction on the Eight Branches, the Immortality Elixir essence. It considers a single medical doctrine from four perspectives. Sage Vidyajnana expounded their manifestation.<ref name=Cards />

* Root - all medical lore elements

* Exegetical - general theory on [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[psychopathology]] and [[Therapy|treatment]]
* Instructional - practical aspects of treatment

* Subsequent - Diagnosis and therapies

==Three principles of function==
Like other systems of traditional Asian medicine, and in contrast to [[biomedicine]], Tibetan medicine first puts forth a specific definition of health in its theoretical texts.  To have good health, Tibetan medical theory states that it is necessary to maintain balance in the body's three principles of function [often translated as ''[[humors]]'']: ''rLung'' (pron. Loong), ''mKhris-pa'' (pron. Tree-pa) [often translated as ''[[bile]]''], and ''Bad-kan'' (pron. Pay-gen) [often translated as ''[[phlegm]]''].<ref name="The Basic Tantra">''The Basic Tantra and the Explanatory Tantra from the Secret Quintessential Instructions on the Eight Branches of the Ambrosia Essence Tantra'' [[Men-Tsee-Khang]]: India 2008 ISBN 81-86419-62-4</ref>

• '''''rLung''''' <ref name="The Basic Tantra" /> is the source of the body's ability to circulate physical substances (e.g. blood), energy (e.g. nervous system impulses), and the non-physical (e.g. thoughts). In embryological development, the mind's expression of materialism is manifested as the system of ''rLung''. There are five distinct subcategories of ''rLung'' each with specific locations and functions: ''Srog-'Dzin rLüng'', ''Gyen-rGyu rLung'', ''Khyab-Byed rLüng'', ''Me-mNyam rLung'', ''Thur-Sel rLüng''.

• '''''mKhris-pa''''' <ref name="The Basic Tantra" /> is characterized by the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of heat, and is the source of many functions such as thermoregulation, metabolism, liver function and discriminating intellect. In embryological development, the mind's expression of aggression is manifested as the system of ''mKhris-pa''. There are five distinct subcategories of ''mKhris-pa'' each with specific locations and functions: '''Ju-Byed mKhris-pa'', ''sGrub-Byed mKhris-pa'', ''mDangs-sGyur mKhris-pa'', ''mThong-Byed mKhris-pa'', ''mDog-Sel mKhris-pa''.

• '''''Bad-kan'''''<ref name="The Basic Tantra" /> is characterized by the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of cold, and is the source of many functions such as aspects of digestion, the maintenance of our physical structure, joint health and mental stability. In embryological development, the mind's expression of ignorance is manifested as the system of ''Bad-kan''. There are five distinct subcategories of ''Bad-kan'' each with specific locations and functions: ''rTen-Byed Bad-kan'', ''Myag-byed Bad-kan'', ''Myong-Byed Bad-kan'', ''Tsim-Byed Bad-kan'', '''Byor-Byed Bad-kan''.

== Usage ==
A key objective of the [[Politics in Tibet|government of Tibet]] is to promote traditional Tibetan medicine among the other [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups in China]]. Once an [[esoteric]] monastic secret, the [[Tibet University of Traditional Tibetan Medicine]] and the [[Qinghai University Medical School]] now offer courses in the practice. In addition, [[Tibetologist]]s from Tibet have traveled to European countries such as Spain to lecture on the topic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://china.globaltimes.cn/society/2010-11/593924.html|title=Push to bring Tibetan medicine to the world|publisher=[[Global Times]]|date=2010-11-19|accessdate=2010-11-19|first=Fu|last=Wen}}</ref>

The Tibetan government-in-exile has also kept up the practise of Tibetan Medicine in India since 1961 when it re-established the Men-Tsee-Khang (the Tibetan Medical and Astrological Institute). It now has 48 branch clinics in India and Nepal.<ref>[http://www.men-tsee-khang.org/Istatus/establish.htm Tibetan Medical & Astrology Institute of the Dalai Lama]</ref>
