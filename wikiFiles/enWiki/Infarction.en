In [[medicine]], '''infarction''' is tissue death ([[necrosis]]) caused by a local lack of oxygen, due to an obstruction of the tissue's [[blood supply]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3970 |work=MedicineNet |publisher=[[WebMD]] |title=Definition of Infarction |date=April 27, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref> The resulting lesion is referred to as an infarct<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/infarct |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] |title=infarct}} Citing:

==Causes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
The supplying [[artery]] may be blocked by an obstruction (e.g.,&nbsp;an [[arterial embolus]], [[thrombus]], or [[atherosclerotic plaque]]), may be mechanically compressed (e.g.,&nbsp;[[tumor]], [[volvulus]], or [[hernia]]), ruptured by trauma (e.g.,&nbsp;[[atherosclerosis]] or [[vasculitides]]), or vasoconstricted (e.g.,&nbsp;cocaine vasoconstriction leading to [[myocardial infarction]]).

[[Hypertension]] and [[atherosclerosis]] are risk factors for both [[atherosclerotic plaque]]s and [[thromboembolism]]. In atherosclerotic formations, a plaque develops under a fibrous cap. When the fibrous cap is degraded by metalloproteinases released from macrophages or by intravascular shear force from blood flow, subendothelial thrombogenic material ([[extracellular matrix]]) is exposed to circulating platelets and thrombus formation occurs on the vessel wall [[Vascular occlusion|occluding]] blood flow. Occasionally, the plaque may rupture and form an [[Embolism|embolus]] which travels with the blood-flow downstream to where the vessel narrows and eventually clogs the vessel lumen. 

Infarctions can also involve mechanical blockage of the blood supply, such as when part of the gut or testicles [[hernia]]tes or becomes involved in a [[volvulus]].

===By histopathology===
Infarctions are divided into 2 types according to the amount of [[blood]] present:
* [[White infarction]]s ([[anemic infarct]]s) affect solid organs such as the [[spleen]], [[heart]] and [[kidneys]] wherein the solidity of the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] substantially limits the amount of nutrients ([[blood]]/[[oxygen]]/[[glucose]]/[[fuel]]) that can flow into the [[area]] of [[ischemic]] [[necrosis]]. Similar [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] to [[blood flow]] and consequent [[necrosis]] can occur as a result of severe [[vasoconstriction]] as illustrated in severe [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] that can lead to irreversible [[gangrene]].
* [[Red infarction]]s ([[hemorrhagic infarct]]s), generally affect the [[lung]]s or other loose organs ([[testis]], [[ovary]], [[small intestines]]). The [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] consists more of [[red blood cell]]s and [[fibrin]] strands. Characteristics of red infarcts include: 
** occlusion of a [[vein]]
** loose tissues that allow [[blood]] to collect in the [[infarcted]] zone
** tissues with a dual [[circulatory system]] (lung, small intestines)
** tissues previously congested from sluggish venous outflow
** [[reperfusion]] ([[injury]])<ref>{{cite journal |pages=654–7 |doi=10.1038/365654a0 |title=Prevention of lung reperfusion injury in rabbits by a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-8 |year=1993 |last1=Sekido |first1=Nobuaki |last2=Mukaida |first2=Naofumi |last3=Harada |first3=Akihisa |last4=Nakanishi |first4=Isao |last5=Watanabe |first5=Yoh |last6=Matsushima |first6=Kouji |journal=Nature |volume=365 |issue=6447 |pmid=8413628}}</ref> of previously [[ischemic]] tissue that is associated with [[reperfusion]]-related [[diseases]]<ref>

===By localization===
* '''Heart''': [[Myocardial infarction]] (''MI''), commonly known as a ''heart attack'', is an infarction of the heart, causing some heart cells to die. This is most commonly due to occlusion (blockage) of a [[coronary artery]] following the rupture of a [[Vulnerable plaque|vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque]], which is an unstable collection of [[lipids]] (fatty acids) and [[white blood cell]]s (especially [[macrophage]]s) in the wall of an [[artery]]. The resulting [[ischemia]] (restriction in blood supply) and [[Hypoxia (medical)|oxygen shortage]], if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can cause damage or death of heart muscle tissue (''[[myocardium]]'').

* '''Brain''': [[Cerebral infarction]] is the [[ischemia|ischemic]] kind of [[stroke]] due to a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. It can be atherothrombotic or embolic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ropper |first1=Allan H. |last2=Adams |first2=Raymond Delacy |last3=Brown |first3=Robert F. |last4=Victor |first4=Maurice |title=Adams and Victor's principles of neurology |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Pub. Division |location=New York  |isbn=0-07-141620-X |pages=686–704}}</ref> Stroke caused by cerebral infarction should be distinguished from two other kinds of stroke: [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and  [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]. Cerebral infarctions vary in their severity with one third of the cases resulting in death.

* '''Lung''': Pulmonary infarction or [[lung Infarction | lung infarction]] 

* '''Spleen''': [[Splenic infarction]] occurs when the [[splenic artery]] or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a [[blood clot]]. Although it can occur [[asymptomatic]]ally, the typical symptom is severe [[abdominal pain|pain]] in the [[left upper quadrant (abdomen)|left upper quadrant of the abdomen]], sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases.<ref name="pmid9486895">{{cite journal |pmid=9486895 |year=1998 |last1=Nores |first1=M |last2=Phillips |first2=EH |last3=Morgenstern |first3=L |last4=Hiatt |first4=JR |title=The clinical spectrum of splenic infarction |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=182–8 |journal=The American surgeon}}</ref> It has to be differentiated from other causes of [[acute abdomen]].

* '''Limb''': [[Limb infarction]] is an infarction of an [[arm]] or [[leg]]. Causes include [[arterial embolism]]s and ''skeletal muscle infarction'' as a rare complication of long standing, poorly controlled [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=Grigoriadis>{{cite journal |pmid=10782838 |year=2000 |last1=Grigoriadis |first1=E |last2=Fam |first2=AG |last3=Starok |first3=M |last4=Ang |first4=LC |title=Skeletal muscle infarction in diabetes mellitus |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=1063–8 |journal=The Journal of rheumatology}}</ref> A major presentation is painful thigh or leg swelling.<ref name=Grigoriadis/>

* '''Bone''': Infarction of [[bone]] results in [[avascular necrosis]]. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and the bone collapses.<ref name=DiGiovanni>{{cite journal |pmid=17426292 |year=2007 |last1=Digiovanni |first1=CW |last2=Patel |first2=A |last3=Calfee |first3=R |last4=Nickisch |first4=F |title=Osteonecrosis in the foot |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=208–17 |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons}}</ref> If avascular necrosis involves the bones of a [[joint]], it often leads to destruction of the joint articular surfaces (see [[osteochondritis dissecans]]).

* '''Testicle''': an infarction of a [[testicle]] may be caused by [[testicular torsion]].

[[File:Segmental testicular infarction 112914968.jpg|thumb|Ultrasound of segmental testicular infarction. Infarct area shown as hypoechoic and avascular upper segment of R testis.]]

* '''Eye''': an infarction can occur to the [[central retinal artery]] which supplies the retina causing sudden visual loss.

==Associated diseases==
Diseases commonly associated with infarctions include:

* [[Peripheral artery occlusive disease]] (the most severe form of which is [[gangrene]])
* [[Antiphospholipid syndrome]]
* [[Sepsis]]
* [[Giant-cell arteritis]] (GCA)
* [[Hernia]]
* [[Volvulus]]
