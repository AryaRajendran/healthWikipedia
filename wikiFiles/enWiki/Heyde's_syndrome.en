'''Heyde's syndrome''' is a [[syndrome]] of [[aortic valve stenosis]] associated with [[gastrointestinal bleeding]] from [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]ic [[angiodysplasia]]. It is named after Dr. Edward C. Heyde, who first described the association in 1958.<ref name=Heyde1958>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM195807242590416|author=Heyde EC|title=Gastrointestinal bleeding in aortic stenosis|journal= N. Engl. J. Med.|year= 1958|volume=259|issue=4|pages=196}}</ref> It is due to the induction of [[von Willebrand disease]] type IIA by the valvular stenosis.<ref name=Vincentelli2003>{{cite journal |author=Vincentelli A, Susen S, Le Tourneau T, ''et al.'' |title=Acquired von Willebrand syndrome in aortic stenosis |journal=N.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Gastrointestinal hemorrhage]] may present as [[hematemesis]] (vomiting blood), [[melena]] (tarry stool from altered blood), or [[hematochezia]] (fresh blood in stool). These symptoms usually lead to [[endoscopy]] of the upper and/or lower digestive tract ([[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopy]] or [[colonoscopy]]). If this shows [[angiodysplasia]] and the patient is known to have [[aortic stenosis]], the combination is referred to as "Heyde's syndrome". It is not necessary for the aortic stenosis to lead to any other symptoms, but evidence of [[heart failure]], [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], or [[chest pain]] may be present if the stenosis is severe.<ref name=Warkentin2003>{{cite journal |author=Warkentin TE, Moore JC, Anand SS, Lonn EM, Morgan DG |title=Gastrointestinal bleeding, angiodysplasia, cardiovascular disease, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome |journal=Transfus Med Rev |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=272–86 |year=2003 |pmid=14571395 |doi=10.1016/S0887-7963(03)00037-3}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
The tests normally performed for [[Von Willebrand disease]] are not necessarily positive, as the abnormality is subtle.<ref name=Warkentin1992>{{cite journal |author=Warkentin TE, Moore JC, Morgan DG |title=Aortic stenosis and bleeding gastrointestinal angiodysplasia: is acquired von Willebrand's disease the link? |journal=Lancet |volume=340 |issue=8810 |pages=35–7 |year=1992 |pmid=1351610 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(92)92434-H}}</ref> [[Platelet function analysis]] (with ADP closure time) or [[von Willebrand factor]] electrophoresis identifies reduction of ULVWF (ultra-large von Willebrand factor).<ref name=Vincentelli2003/>

== Pathophysiology ==
In the 45 years following its initial description, no plausible explanations could be found for the association between aortic valve stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding. Indeed, the association itself was questioned by a number of researchers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gostout CJ |title=Angiodysplasia and aortic valve disease: let's close the book on this association |journal=Gastrointest. Endosc. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=491–3 |year=1995 |pmid=8566646 |doi=10.1016/S0016-5107(95)70058-7}}</ref> A number of reports stressed, however, that replacement of the diseased aortic valve often led to resolution of the coagulopathy.<ref name=Warkentin1992/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Warkentin TE, Moore JC, Morgan DG |title=Gastrointestinal angiodysplasia and aortic stenosis |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=347 |issue=11 |pages=858–9 |year=2002 |pmid=12226167 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200209123471122|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/347/11/858}}</ref>

A 2003 study showed how the subtle form of [[von Willebrand disease]] present in Heyde syndrome patients resolved rapidly after [[aortic valve replacement]] of the stenosed aortic valve. The [[coagulation]] abnormality, the study poses, is possibly caused by the increased breakdown of the very large [[von Willebrand factor]] molecule by its natural [[catabolism|catabolic]] enzyme (named [[ADAMTS13]]) under conditions of high [[shear stress]] around the valve.<ref name=Vincentelli2003/>

== Therapy ==
{{main|Angiodysplasia}}

Symptomatic treatment can be given in the form of [[blood transfusion]]s. [[Desmopressin]] (DDAVP) releases [[Factor VIII]] storage pools and is used in mild to moderate cases of [[von Willebrand disease]].

Vincentelli ''et al.'' argue that severe forms of Heyde's syndrome might be sufficient reason for aortic valve replacement, even if the stenosis is otherwise clinically unimportant and is not likely to cause complications.<ref name=Vincentelli2003/>

==Epidemiology==
The exact prevalence of the syndrome is unknown. A 2003 study found that of 73 [[angiodysplasia]] patients who had also undergone [[echocardiogram]]s, the prevalence of aortic stenosis was 31% (as opposed to 14% in the control group).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Batur P, Stewart WJ, Isaacson JH |title=Increased prevalence of aortic stenosis in patients with arteriovenous malformations of the gastrointestinal tract in Heyde syndrome |journal=Arch.

== History ==
The American internist Edward C. Heyde originally described the syndrome in a 1958 letter to the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', reporting on ten patients with the association.<ref name=Heyde1958/> Edward Heyde, MD Graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1938, served three years in the Army Medical Corps in WWII and joined the Vancouver Clinic in 1948, practicing medicine there for 31 years. He died on October 13, 2004
A letter appearing shortly after confirmed an [[odds ratio]] of almost 3.0 between the two diseases.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM195811062591921|author=Goldman MJ|title=Aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding|journal=N. Engl. J. Med.|year=1958|volume=259|issue=19|pages=941}}</ref>
