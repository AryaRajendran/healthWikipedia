'''Adenitis''' is a general term for an [[inflammation]] of a [[gland]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000001524|Adenitis}}</ref> or [[lymph node]].

==Classification==
===Lymph node adenitis===
{{main|lymphadenitis}}
"Lymph adenitis" or "lymph node adenitis" is caused by bacterial infection in lymph nodes. The infected lymph nodes typically become enlarged, warm and tender. A swelling of lymph nodes due to growth of lymph cells is called [[lymphadenopathy]]. Types include:

* Neck
** '''Cervical adenitis''' is an inflammation of a lymph node in the [[neck]].
** '''Tuberculous adenitis''' ([[scrofula]]) is a tuberculous infection of the skin of the neck caused by ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. Non-tuberculous adenitis can also be caused by ''[[Mycobacterium scrofulaceum]]'' or ''[[Mycobacterium avium]]''.

* Abdomen
** '''Mesenteric adenitis''' is an inflammation of the [[mesentery|mesenteric]] lymph nodes in the abdomen.<ref>Ellis H, Calne R, Watson C. ''Lecture Notes on General Surgery'' tenth edition, p.28. ISBN 0-632-06371-8</ref> If it occurs in the right lower quadrant, it can be mistaken for acute [[appendicitis]], often preceded by a sore throat.

===Other===
'''Sebaceous adenitis''' is an inflammation of the [[sebaceous gland]]s
in the skin. These glands normally produce [[sebum]] (skin oil, a lipid-rich secretion) which prevents drying of the skin.
