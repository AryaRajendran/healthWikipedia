'''Oral rehydration therapy''' (ORT) is a [[medical treatment]] consisting of liquid solutions delivered orally which are designed to counteract [[dehydration]]. Also known as Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) or Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS), ORT is often used in conjunction with, or as a replacement for, [[IV fluid|IV Fluid treatments]].

ORT is effective in treating fluid loss due to acute [[Diarrhea|diarrheal]] diseases of diverse etiology, particularly [[gastroenteritis]], such as that caused by [[cholera]] or [[rotavirus]].

ORT solutions vary in composition, but usually contain a mixture of [[glucose]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[citrate]]. In some cases, ORT solutions using products available in the home, such as salted rice water, yogurt drinks, or vegetable or chicken soups, may be used.

Numerous case studies, including those conducted by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], have shown that ORT dramatically reduces the number of deaths experienced during and after epidemics of cholera. The ease of administering ORT, which can be given by non-medical personnel, has resulted in ORT being heraled as one of the most significant public health advances in the 20th century.<ref name="who.int">World Health Organization, Global Task Force on Cholera Control, [http://www.who.int/cholera/technical/en/ WHO position paper on Oral Rehydration Salts to reduce mortality from cholera]</ref>

== History ==
Prescriptions from the ancient Indian physician [[Sushruta]] date back over 2500 years with treatment of acute diarrhea with [[rice]] water, [[coconut water|coconut juice]], and [[carrot]] soup.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Guerrant|first=Richard L.|coauthors=Carniero-Filho, Dillingham|title=Cholera, Diarrhea, and Oral Rehydration Therapy: Triumph and Indictment|journal=Viewpoints|date=1|year=2003|month=August|volume=37|issue=Cholera, Diarrhea, and Oral Rehydration Therapy|pages=398–405|url=http://amimc.org.mx/congresos/medicina_viajero/Tratamiento_rehidratacion.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref> However, this knowledge did not carry over to the Western world, as dehydration was found to be the major cause of death secondary to the 1829 [[cholera]] pandemic in Russia and Western Europe. In 1831, [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]] noted the loss of water and salt in the stool of cholera patients and prescribed [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluid therapy]] (IV) to compensate. The results were remarkable, as patients who were on the brink of death from dehydration recovered. The mortality rate of cholera dropped from 70&nbsp;percent to 40&nbsp;percent with the use of [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] IV solutions.<ref name=guerrant_ort_history>{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrant | first1 = RL | last2 = Carneiro-Filho | first2 = BA | last3 = Dillingham | first3 = RA | year=2003 | month=August | title=Cholera, Diarrhea, and Oral Rehydration Therapy: Triumph and Indictment | journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume=37 | issue=3 | pages=398–405 | pmid=12884165 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/3/398.full.pdf | doi=10.1086/376619|accessdate=2008-07-15 }}</ref> IV fluid replacement became entrenched as the standard of care for moderate/severe dehydration for over a hundred years. ORT replaced it with the support of several independent key advocates that ultimately convinced the medical community of the efficacy of ORT.<ref name=ruxin />

In the late 1950s, ORT was prescribed by [[Hemendra Nath Chatterjee|Dr. Hemendra Nath Chatterjee]] in India for patients diagnosed with cholera.<ref name=chatterjee>{{cite journal| last= Chatterjee| first = HN | journal = Postgraduate Medical Journal | year = 1957| volume = 33|issue = 380| pages=278–84| title=Reduction of Cholera Mortality by the Control of Bowel Symptoms and Other Complications|pmc=2501333| doi= 10.1136/pgmj.33.380.278| pmid= 13431557}}</ref> Although his findings predate physiological studies, his results failed to gain credibility and recognition because they did not provide [[scientific control]]s and detailed analysis.<ref name=ruxin>{{cite journal | last1 = Ruxin | first1 = JN | title = Magic bullet: the history of oral rehydration therapy | journal = Medical History | year = 1994 | volume = 38 | pages = 363–97 | pmc=1036912 | pmid = 7808099 | issue = 4 }}</ref> Credit for discovery that in the presence of glucose, sodium and chloride became absorbable during diarrhea (in cholera patients) is typically ascribed to Dr. Robert A. Phillips. However, early attempts to translate this observation into an effective oral rehydration solution failed, due to incorrect solution formula and inadequate methodology.<ref name=ruxin/>

In the early 1960s, biochemist [[Robert K. Crane]] discovered the sodium-glucose [[Co-transport|cotransport]] as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption.<ref>Robert K. Crane, D. Miller and I. Bihler. "The restrictions on possible mechanisms of intestinal transport of sugars". In: Membrane Transport and Metabolism. Proceedings of a Symposium held in Prague, August 22–27, 1960. Edited by A. Kleinzeller and A. Kotyk.

These findings were confirmed in [[human experiments]], where it was first shown that a glucose-saline oral therapy solution administered in quantities matching measured diarrhea volumes was effective in significantly decreasing the necessity for IV fluids by 80&nbsp;percent.<ref name=nalin_first_ort_successful_trial>{{cite journal | last=Nalin |first=David R |coauthors= Richard A.

The events surrounding the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971 convinced the world of the effectiveness of ORT.<ref name=ruxin/> As medical teams ran out of intravenous fluids to treat the spreading cholera epidemic, Dr. [[Dilip Mahalanabis]] instructed his staff to distribute oral rehydration salts (ORS) to the 350,000 people in refugee camps. Over 3,000 patients with cholera were treated, and the [[mortality rate|death rate]] was only 3.6&nbsp;percent, compared with the typical 30&nbsp;percent seen in intravenous fluid therapy.<ref name=guerrant_ort_history /> The fact that ORT was delivered primarily by family members instead of trained staff across such a large population in an emergency fashion was demonstrative proof of the utility of ORT against cholera.<ref name=ruxin/>

Between 1980 and 2006, ORT decreased the number of deaths that occurred worldwide from 5 million a year to 3 million a year.<ref name=gerlin>{{cite journal |last=Gerline|first=Andrea |magazine=Time Magazine |title=A Simple Solution| url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1543876,00.html|date=October 8, 2006}}</ref> Death from diarrhea was the leading cause of infant mortality in the developing world until ORT was introduced.<ref name=lancet78/> It is now the second leading cause of mortality for children under five, accounting for 17&nbsp;percent of all deaths, second only to [[pneumonia]], at 19&nbsp;percent.<ref name=unicef_sowc>{{cite book | title=The State of the World's Children 2008: Child Survival | url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc08/docs/sowc08.pdf | author=[[UNICEF]] | publisher = United Nations Children's Fund | date = December 2007 | isbn=978-92-806-4191-2 | page=8 }}</ref> Its remarkable success has led to naming the discovery of its underlying physiological basis as "potentially the most important medical advance [of the 20th]&nbsp;century."<ref name=lancet78>{{cite journal| title=Water with Sugar and Salt| journal = The Lancet | year = 1978 | month = August |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(78)91698-7| volume=312| issue=8084| pages=300–1 }}</ref> ORT is part of UNICEF's GOBI program, a low cost program to increase child survival in developing countries, including growth monitoring, ORT, breastfeeding, and immunization.<ref>{{cite book | title= 1946-2006 Sixty Years for Children |url= http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/1946-2006_Sixty_Years_for_Children.pdf | year= 2006 | month= November | format= pdf | publisher= [[UNICEF]] |isbn=92-806-4053-4 |accessdate= 2008-06-07 | author= [[UNICEF]] }}</ref> Despite the success and effectiveness of ORT, its uptake has recently slowed and even reversed in some developing countries.

The individuals and organizations involved in the development of ORT have been recognized widely.

==Availability==
The World Health Organizations states that some home products can be used to treat and prevent dehydration. This includes salted rice water, salted yogurt drink, and salted vegetable or chicken soup. A home-made solution of one litre of plain water with 3 grams table salt (one half level teaspoonful) and 18 grams common sugar (three tablespoons) can also be made. And a medium amount of salt can also be added to water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, unsweetened weak tea, and unsweetened fruit juice.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>  The homemade solution should have the "taste of tears."<ref name=2010WorldCupTravellersGuide>[http://www.who.int/topics/test/food_safety/safe_food_travel.pdf A GUIDE ON SAFE FOOD FOR TRAVELLERS], WELCOME TO SOUTH AFRICA, HOST TO THE 2010 FIFA WORLD CUP (bottom left of page 1).</ref>  If available, supplemental zinc and potassium can be added to or given with the homemade solution.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>

ORT is available anywhere that adequate nutrition is available. ORS, on the other hand, is typically packaged in pre-measured sachets that are ready to be mixed in with water (generally 1[[liter|L]]). These are available via commercial manufacturers<ref name=rehydrate_suppliers>{{cite web|title = Worldwide Suppliers of ORS - rehydrate.org|url = http://rehydrate.org/resources/suppliers.htm|accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref> or supplied by local/regional governments or relief agencies such as [[UNICEF]]. In 1996, UNICEF distributed 500 million sachets of ORS to over 60 developing nations.<ref name=unicef96_childrenstate_ors>{{cite web|author=[[UNICEF]]|title=The State of the World's Children 1996|year = 1996|url = http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/joral.htm|accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref> Commercial suppliers produce a variety of formulations, and there is no restriction as to what formulation can be marketed as ORS. As such, some vendors include extra sugar or other flavoring to make the product more palatable, popular examples in the US being the various flavors and formulations of Drip Drop ORS,Frutolyte and [[Pedialyte]].

Scheduled to start in October 2011,{{update after|2011|10}} there is a pilot program in Zambia that will test to what extent piggybacking ORS and zinc on Coca-Cola's distribution channels could improve access to these medicines, particularly in rural areas. The project, called [[Colalife]] uses the empty spaces in crated bottles of Coke to supply wedge-shaped packets of medicine that contain oral rehydration salts.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IInI7nkdvPY</ref>

==Definition==

The definition of ORT has changed over time, broadening in scope and encompassing a definition of a specific therapy appropriate for rehydration. Initially, in the early 1980s, ORT was defined only as the solution prescribed by the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]]. It was later changed in 1988 to encompass recommended home fluids, because the official preparation was not always readily available. It was amended once again in 1988 to include continued feeding as appropriate management. In 1991, the definition was changed to define ORT as any increase in administered [[hydrational fluid]]s. The final change came in 1993, and is the definition used today, which states that ORT is an increase in administered fluids and continued feeding.<ref name=who_bu0747 /><ref name="who.int">World Health Organization, Global Task Force on Cholera Control, [http://www.who.int/cholera/technical/en/ WHO position paper on Oral Rehydration Salts to reduce mortality from cholera]</ref>

Other appropriate treatments include official ORSs, salted [[rice water]], salted yogurt-based drinks, and vegetable or chicken soup with salt. [[Clean water]] should always be used when preparing a solution. Drinks with diuretic properties (due to high sugar content and/or caffeine) should be avoided. Drinks with a high concentration ([[osmolarity]]) of sugar can worsen diarrhea as they draw water out of the body and into the intestine because of their [[hypertonic]]ity.<ref name=who_cdd_93.44 />

===Food and supplements===
An adult or child with diarrhea should continue to eat, and infants should continue to breast-feed.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/><ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf Community Health Worker Training Materials for Cholera Prevention and Control], CDC, slides at back are dated 11/17/2010. Page 7 states " . . . Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently."</ref> In a 2005 publication for doctors regarding the treatment of diarrhea, the World Health Organization states: "When food is given, sufficient nutrients are usually absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain. Continued feeding also speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function, including the ability to digest and absorb various nutrients. In contrast, children whose food is restricted or diluted lose weight, have diarrhea of longer duration, and recover intestinal function more slowly."<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment Of Diarrhea, A manual for physicians and other senior health workers]<br>World Health Organization, 2005. See page 9 (13 in PDF) for home products and recipes that can be used to treat and prevent dehydration. See chapter "8. Management Of Diarrhea With Severe Malnutrition," pages 22-24 (26-28 in PDF). This manual is quite emphatic about the importance of continuing to feed the patient with page 10 (14 in PDF) stating: "Food should ''never'' be withheld and the child's usual foods should ''not'' be diluted.

===Treatment when malnourished===
Dehydration may be overestimated in a [[marasmic]]/wasted child and underestimated in a [[kwashiorkor]]/[[edematous]] child. The diagnosis is based instead on whether the person has been having diarrhea.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/><ref name=BangladeshGuideMalnourishedChildren/> Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition (ReSoMal) contains less salt and more sugar and potassium than regular ORS.<ref name=BangladeshGuideMalnourishedChildren>[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008. See esp. pages 21-22 (pages 22-23 in PDF)</ref> In addition, the World Health Organization recommends that all malnourished individuals with diarrhea be treated with a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/> Supplemental zinc is still recommended, and a dehydrated person should still continue to be given food.<ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/>

== Physiological basis ==
Fluid from the body is normally pumped into the [[intestine|intestinal]] [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] during digestion. This fluid is typically [[isosmotic]] with [[blood]] because it contains a high concentration of [[sodium]] (approx. 142 m[[equivalent (chemistry)|Eq]]/L). A healthy individual will secrete 20-30 [[gram]]s of sodium per day via intestinal secretions. Nearly all of this is reabsorbed by the intestine, helping to maintain constant sodium levels in the body ([[homeostasis]]).<ref name=guyton11_814>{{Cite book | author=Guyton, Arthur C.; Hall, John E. | title=Textbook of Medical Physiology | year=2006 | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=0-7216-0240-1 | pages=814–816}}</ref>

Because there is so much sodium secreted by the intestine, without intervention, heavy continuous diarrhea can become a potentially life-threatening condition within hours. This is because liquid secreted into the intestinal lumen during diarrhea passes through the gut so quickly that little sodium is reabsorbed, leading to dangerously low sodium levels in the body (severe [[hyponatremia]]).<ref name=guyton11_814 /> This is the motivation for sodium and water replenishment via ORT.

Sodium absorption via the intestine occurs in two stages. The first is at the outermost cells (intestinal [[epithelial]] cells) at the surface of the intestinal lumen. Sodium passes into these outermost cells by [[co-transport]] via the [[SGLT1]] protein.<ref name=guyton11_814 /> From there, sodium is pumped out of the cells ([[basolateral membrane|basal]] side) and into the [[extracellular space]] by [[active transport]] via the [[sodium potassium pump]].<ref name=cps_ors>{{cite journal|author=Canadian Paediatric Society, Nutrition Committee | title = Oral rehydration therapy and early refeeding in the management of childhood gastroenteritis|journal = Paediatrics & Child Health | year = 2006| volume = 11|issue = 8|pages=527–531|url = http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/N/N06-01.htm|accessdate = 2009-02-17}}</ref><ref name=guyton11_330>{{Cite book | author=Guyton, Arthur C.; Hall, John E. | title=Textbook of Medical Physiology | year=2006 | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=0-7216-0240-1 | pages=330}}</ref>

The co-transport of sodium into the epithelial cells via the [[SGLT1]] protein requires [[glucose]] or [[galactose]]. Two sodium ions and one molecule of glucose/galactose are transported together across the [[cell membrane]] through the SGLT1 protein. Without glucose or galactose present, intestinal sodium will not be absorbed. This is the reason glucose is included in ORSs. For each cycle of the transport, hundreds of water molecules move into the epithelial cell, slowly rehydrating the affected individual.<ref name=guyton11_814 />
