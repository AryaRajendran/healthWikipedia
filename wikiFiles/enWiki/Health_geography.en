'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by a shift from a [[medical model of disability|medical model]] to a [[social model of disability|social model]], which advocates for a redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness to one of promoting well-being.  Under this model, new illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognised, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]]) are combined with [[traditional medicine]].  This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctors offices.  Also, the social model gives primacy to the intimate encounters performed at spaces of non-traditional medicine and care as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].<ref name= "Philo2">Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326</ref>

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].<ref name= "Philo">Philo, Chris (2009).

== History of health geography ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.<ref name= "Philo" /> A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]].  Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground.  [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] thought that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps showing the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps.  He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims.  He figured that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable.  After that the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements.  The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease.  This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].  The second stream of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[Behavioral economics]].<ref>Litva, Andréa; Eyles, John. (1995). "Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography." ''Health & Place'' '''1''' 1, pp. 5-14</ref>

=== Geographies of Disease and Ill Health ===
Health geographers are concerned with the prevalence of different diseases along a range of [[Scale (physics)|scales]] from the local to global, and inspects the natural world, in all of its complexity, for [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]] between diseases and locations.  This situates health geography alongside other [[Geography#Human geography|geographical sub-disciplines]] that trace human-environment relations.  Health geographers use modern spatial analysis tools to map the [[diffusion]] of various diseases, as individuals spread them amongst themselves, and across wider spaces as they [[Human migration|migrate]].<ref name="Philo" />  Health geographers also consider all types of spaces as presenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]] and other potential dangers.<ref name="Philo2" />

=== Geography of Health Care Provision ===
Although health care is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]].  Demand for public services is continuously distributed across space, broadly in accordance with the distribution of population, but these services are only provided at discrete locations, therefore, there will be inequalities of access in terms of the practicality of using services, transport costs, travel times and so on.  Geographical or 'locational' factors (e.g. physical proximity, travel time) are not the only aspects which influence access to health care. Other types (or dimensions) of accessibility to health care except for geographical (or spatial) are social, financial and functional.  

''Social'' accessibility to health care depends on race, age, sex and other social characteristics of individuals, important here is also the relationship between patient and doctor.  ''Financial'' accessibility depends upon the price of a particular health care. ''Functional'' accessibility reflects the amount and structure of provided services.  These factors can vary among different countries or regions of the world.  Access to health care is influenced also by factors such as opening times and waiting lists that play an important part in determining whether individuals or groups can access health care – this type of accessibility is termed 'effective accessibility'.

The location of health care facilities depends largely on the nature of the [[health care]] system in operation, and will be heavily influenced by historical factors due to the heavy investment costs in facilities such as [[hospitals]] and [[surgeries]]. Simple distance will be mediated by organisational factors such as the existence of a referral system by which patients are directed towards particular parts of the hospital sector by their [[General practitioner|GP]].  Access to [[primary care]] is therefore a very significant component of access to the whole system.  In a [[universal health care]] system, one would expect the distribution of facilities to fairly closely match the distribution of [[demand]].  By contrast, a [[market-oriented]] system might mirror the [[locational]] patterns that we find in other business sectors, such as [[retail]] location.  We may attempt to measure either ''potential accessibility'' or ''revealed accessibility'', but we should note that there is a well-established pattern of [[utilisation]] increasing with access, i.e. people who have easier access to [[health care]] use it more often.
