The '''Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus''' (also '''Kahun Papyrus''', '''Kahun Medical Papyrus''', or '''UC 32057''') is the oldest known  medical text of any kind.  Dated to about 1800 BCE, it deals with women's health&mdash;[[gynaecology|gynaecological]] diseases, fertility, pregnancy, contraception, etc. 

It was found at [[El-Lahun]] by [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie|Flinders Petrie]] in 1889<ref>Worton & Wilson, ''op.cit.'', p.192</ref> and first translated by [[Francis Llewellyn Griffith|F. Ll. Griffith]] in 1893 and  published in ''The Petrie Papyri: Hieratic Papyri from Kahun and Gurob''. The later ''[[Berlin Papyrus]]'' and the ''[[Ramesseum Papyrus IV]]''  cover much of the same ground, often giving identical prescriptions.<ref>David, ''op.cit.'', p.124</ref>

The text is divided into thirty-four sections, each section dealing with a specific problem and containing  diagnosis and treatment; no [[prognosis]] is suggested. Treatments are non-surgical, comprising applying medicines to the affected body part or swallowing them. The [[womb]] is at times seen as the source of complaints manifesting themselves in other body parts.<ref>Dixon, ''op.cit.'', pp.15f.</ref>
