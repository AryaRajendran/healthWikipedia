'''Lymph''' is the fluid that circulates throughout the [[lymphatic system]]. The lymph is formed when the [[interstitial fluid]] (the fluid which lies in the [[Interstitial space (biology)|interstices]] of all body tissues)<ref>[http://www.anaesthesiamcq.com/FluidBook/fl2_1.php Fluid Physiology: 2.1 Fluid Compartments]</ref> is collected through [[lymph capillary|lymph capillaries]]. As the blood and the surrounding cells continually add and remove substances from the interstitial fluid, its composition continually changes and it changes into lymph fluid. It is then transported through [[lymph vessel]]s to [[lymph node]]s before emptying ultimately into the right or the left [[subclavian vein]], where it mixes back with blood.

Lymph returns protein and excess interstitial fluid to the circulation. Lymph may pick up bacteria and bring them to lymph nodes where they are destroyed. [[Metastasis|Metastatic]] [[cancer]] cells can also be transported via lymph. Lymph also transports fats from the digestive system.

The word ''lymph'' is derived from the name of the Roman deity of fresh water, [[Lympha]].

==Composition==
Lymph has a composition comparable to that of [[blood plasma]], but it may differ slightly. Lymph contains [[white blood cell]]s. In particular the lymph that leaves a lymph node is richer in [[lymphocyte]]s. Likewise, the lymph formed in the [[digestive system]] called [[chyle]] is rich in [[triglyceride]]s (fat), and looks milky white.

==Formation==
[[Image:Illu capillary microcirculation.jpg|thumb|250 px|Formation of interstitial fluid from blood]]

[[Blood]] supplies [[nutrient]]s and important [[metabolite]]s to the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and collects back the waste products they produce, which requires exchange of respective constituents between the blood and tissue cells. However, this exchange is not direct but instead is effected through an intermediary called ''interstitial fluid'' or ''tissue fluid'' that the blood forms. [[Interstitial fluid]] is the fluid that occupies the spaces between the cells and constitutes their immediate environment. As the blood and the surrounding cells continually add and remove substances from the interstitial fluid, its composition continually changes. Water and [[solution|solutes]] can pass between the interstitial fluid and blood via [[diffusion]] across gaps in [[capillary]] walls called intercellular clefts; thus, the blood and interstitial fluid are in [[dynamic equilibrium]] with each other.<ref name="Gray">{{Cite web |url=http://theodora.com/anatomy/the_lymphatic_system.html |title=The Lymphatic System |work=Human Anatomy (Gray's Anatomy) |accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref> 

Interstitial fluid forms at the [[arteriole|arterial]] (coming from the heart) end of capillaries because of the higher pressure of blood compared to [[vein]]s, and most of it returns to its [[venule|venous]] ends and [[venule]]s; the rest (1%) enters the [[lymph capillary|lymph capillaries]] as lymph.<ref name=grays>{{cite book |last= Warwick|first= Roger|coauthors= Peter L.

However, as it flows through the lymph nodes it comes in contact with blood, and tends to accumulate more cells (particularly, lymphocytes) and proteins.<ref name=sloop>{{cite journal |last= Sloop|first= Charles H.|coauthors= Ladislav Dory, Paul S.

==Lymphatic circulation==
Tubular vessels transport lymph back to the blood, ultimately replacing the volume lost during the formation of the interstitial fluid. These channels are the lymphatic channels, or simply ''lymphatics''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4217 |title=Definition of lymphatics |accessdate=2008-07-06 |work=Webster's New World Medical Dictionary |publisher= MedicineNet.com|date= }}</ref>

Unlike the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system is not closed and has no central pump. Lymph transport, therefore, is slow and sporadic. Despite low pressure, lymph movement occurs due to [[peristalsis]] (propulsion of the lymph due to alternate contraction and relaxation of [[smooth muscle]]), valves, and compression during contraction of adjacent skeletal muscle and [[arterial]] [[pulse|pulsation]].<ref name=Shayan2006>{{cite journal  | author = Shayan, Ramin; Achen, Marc G.; Stacker, Steven A.

Lymph that enters the lymph vessels from the interstitial space usually does not flow backwards along the vessels because of the presence of valves. If excessive [[hydrostatic pressure]] develops within the lymph vessels, though, some fluid can leak back into the interstitial space and contribute to formation of [[edema]].

==As a growth medium==
In 1907 the zoologist [[Ross Granville Harrison]] demonstrated the growth of frog nerve cell processes in a medium of clotted lymph.

In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew [[vaccinia]] [[virus]] in fragments of [[tissue culture]] from guinea pig [[cornea]]l grown in lymph.<ref>Steinhardt, E; Israeli, C; and Lambert, R.A. (1913) "Studies on the cultivation of the virus of vaccinia" ''J. Inf Dis. 13, 294–300</ref>
