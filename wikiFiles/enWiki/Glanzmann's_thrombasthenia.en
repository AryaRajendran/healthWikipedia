'''Glanzmann's thrombasthenia''' is an abnormality of [[thrombocyte|platelets]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000108489|Glanzmann thrombasthenia}}</ref> It is an extremely rare [[coagulopathy]] (bleeding disorder due to a [[blood]] abnormality), in which the platelets contain defective or low levels of [[GpIIb/IIIa|glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb/IIIa)]], which is a receptor for [[fibrinogen]]. As a result, no [[fibrinogen]] bridging of platelets to other platelets can occur, and the [[bleeding time]] is significantly prolonged.

==Pathophysiology==
[[GpIIb/IIIa|Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb/IIIa)]], also known as α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, is an [[integrin]]  [[Platelet#Adhesion and aggregation|aggregation receptor]] on [[thrombocytes|platelets]]. This receptor is activated when the platelet is stimulated by ADP, [[epinephrine]], collagen, or thrombin. GpIIb/IIIa is essential to [[blood coagulation]] since the activated receptor has the ability to bind [[fibrinogen]] (as well as [[von Willebrand factor]], [[fibronectin]], and [[vitronectin]]), which is required for fibrinogen-dependent platelet-platelet interaction (aggregation.) 

In contrast, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia has normal [[glycoprotein Ib]] receptors, the role of which is to enable platelet activation by contact with the [[von Willebrand factor]]-collagen complex that is exposed when the endothelial blood vessel lining is damaged. 

Understanding of the role of GpIIb/IIIa in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia led to the development of [[GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors]], a class of powerful [[antiplatelet agent]]s.<ref name=seligsohn>{{cite journal |author=Seligsohn U |title=Glanzmann thrombasthenia: a model disease which paved the way to powerful therapeutic agents |journal=Pathophysiol.

==Cause==
Glanzmann's thrombasthenia can be inherited in an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] manner<ref name=seligsohn/><ref name="Williams2010-8">Kaushansky K, Lichtman M, Beutler E, Kipps T, Prchal J, Seligsohn U.  (2010; edition 8: pages 1933-1941) ''Williams Hematology''. McGraw-Hill.ISBN 978-0071621519</ref> or acquired as an [[autoimmune disorder]].<ref name="Williams2010-8"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tholouli E, Hay CR, O'Gorman P, Makris M |title=Acquired Glanzmann's thrombasthenia without thrombocytopenia: a severe acquired autoimmune bleeding disorder |journal=Br.

The bleeding tendency in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is variable,<ref name="Williams2010-8"/> some individuals having minimal bruising, while others have frequent, severe, potentially fatal [[hemorrhage]]s. Moreover, platelet α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> levels correlate poorly with hemorrhagic severity, as virtually undetectable α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> levels can correlate with negligible bleeding symptoms, and 10%–15% levels can correlate with severe hemorrhage.<ref name="Nurden2006">{{cite doi|10.1186/1750-1172-1-10}}</ref> Unidentified factors other than the platelet defect itself may have important roles.<ref name="Williams2010-8"/>

==Clinical features==
Characteristically, there is increased [[Mucocutaneous zone|mucosal]] [[bleeding]]:<ref name="Williams2010-8"/>
* [[menorrhagia]] 
* easy bruising
* [[epistaxis]]
* [[gingiva]]l bleeding
* gastrointestinal bleeding
* [[postpartum]] bleeding 
* increased bleeding post-operatively.

The bleeding tendency is variable but may be severe. [[Hemarthrosis]], particularly spontaneous, is very rare, in contrast to the [[hemophilia]]s.

Platelet numbers and morphology are normal. Platelet [[Platelet#Adhesion and aggregation|aggregation]] is normal with [[ristocetin]], but impaired with other agonists such as ADP, [[thrombin]], collagen or epinephrine.

==Treatment==
Therapy involves both preventive measures and treatment of specific bleeding episodes.<ref name="Williams2010-8"/>
* Dental hygiene lessens [[gingiva]]l bleeding
* Avoidance of antiplatelet agents such as [[aspirin]] and other anti-inflammatory drugs ([[NSAIDs]]) such as [[ibuprofen]] and [[naproxen]], and anticoagulants
*  Iron or [[folate]] supplementation may be necessary if excessive or prolonged bleeding has caused anemia
* [[Hepatitis B]] vaccine
* Antifibrinolytic drugs such as [[tranexamic acid]] or [[Aminocaproic acid|ε-aminocaproic acid (Amicar)]] 
* [[Desmopressin]] (DDAVP) does not normalize the [[bleeding time]] in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia but anecdotally improves [[hemostasis]]
* [[Hormonal contraceptive]]s to control excessive menstrual bleeding
* Topical agents such as [[gelfoam]], [[fibrin sealants]], polyethylene glycol polymers, custom dental splints
* Platelet [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s (only if bleeding is severe; risk of platelet [[alloimmunization]])
* [[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] [[factor VIIa]]
* [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT) for severe recurrent hemorrhages

==Eponym==
It is named for [[Eduard Glanzmann]] (1887-1959), the Swiss pediatrician who originally described it.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1289}}</ref><ref>W. E. Glanzmann. Hereditäre hämorrhägische Thrombasthenie.
