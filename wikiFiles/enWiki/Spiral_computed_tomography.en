Most modern hospitals currently use spiral CT scanners.

CT beam types have included parallel beams, fan-beams, and cone-beams.<ref name="Bovik2009">{{cite book|author=Alan Conrad Bovik|title=The essential guide to image processing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6TOUgytafmQC&pg=PA743|accessdate=4 June 2011|year=2009|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374457-9|pages=743–}}</ref>

Since its invention by Kalender in the 1980s, helical scan CT machines have steadily increased the number of rows of detectors (slices) they deploy. The [[prototype]] 16 multi-slice scanner was introduced in 2001 and in 2004, 64 multislice scanners are on the market. These can produce an image in less than a second and thus can obtain images of the heart and its [[blood]] vessels ([[coronary]] vessels) as if frozen in time.

The earliest devices, developed in 1989, were called "SSCT", for "single-slice spiral computed tomography". In 1998, "MSCT" or "multi-slice spiral computed tomography" was introduced.<ref name="Cierniak2011">{{cite book|author=Robert Cierniak|title=X-Ray Computed Tomography in Biomedical Engineering|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XeMtD6lCDcsC&pg=PA31|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=12 January 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-85729-026-7|pages=31–}}</ref>

==Helical (or spiral) cone beam computed tomography==
{{See|Cone beam computed tomography}}
In cone-beam computed tomography (commonly abbreviated ''CBCT''), the x-ray beam is conical.<ref>{{MeshName|Helical+Cone-Beam+CT}}</ref>

'''Helical (or spiral) cone beam computed tomography''' is a type of three dimensional [[computed tomography]] (CT) in which the source (usually of [[x-ray]]s) describes a [[helix|helical]] trajectory relative to the object while a two dimensional array of detectors measures the transmitted radiation on part of a cone of rays emanating from the source.

In practical helical cone beam x-ray CT machines, the source and array of detectors are mounted on a rotating gantry while the patient is moved axially at a uniform rate. Earlier x-ray CT scanners imaged one slice at a time by rotating source and one dimensional array of detectors while the patient remained static. The helical scan method reduces the x-ray dose to the patient required for a given resolution while scanning more quickly. This is however at the cost of greater mathematical complexity in the [[Tomographic_reconstruction|reconstruction of the image]] from the measurements.
