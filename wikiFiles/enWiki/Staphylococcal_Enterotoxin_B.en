'''Staphylococcal enterotoxin B''' ('''SEB''') is an [[enterotoxin]] produced by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. It is a common cause of [[food poisoning]], with severe [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]] and intestinal cramping often starting within a few hours of ingestion.<ref name="emedicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/830715-overview|title=eMedicine - CBRNE - Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B|format= |work=eMedicine|accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref> Being quite stable,.<ref name="Nema et al.">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17477998|title=Isolation and characterization of heat resistant enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus from a food poisoning outbreak in Indian subcontinent.|format=|last=Nema et al.}}</ref> the toxin may remain active even after the contaminating bacteria are killed. It can withstand boiling at 100°C for a few minutes.<ref name="emedicine" /> [[Gastroenteritis]] occurs because SEB is a [[superantigen]], causing the immune system to release a large amount of [[cytokine]]s that lead to significant inflammation.

The US Army Chemical Warfare Service may have supplied a vial of SEB to [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] agents during the [[Second World War]] to incapacitate a [[Nazi]] agent in [[North Africa]] at the time of the [[D-day]] invasion to prevent effective handling of intelligence in the early hours of the invasion.

The United States weaponized SEB originally as agent '''PG''', later '''UC''', during the [[Cold War]].  It was anticipated to have a rate-of-action of several hours and a duration-of-action of 1 – 2 days.  There was a crash program to deliver a usable weapon, and there was a plan to use it in the opening hours of an invasion of Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], but the plan was later rejected.

Field trials with the A/B 45-4 dry agent spray tank demonstrated that a 95&nbsp;kg payload of UC was capable of neutralizing a {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} target.

The ICt<sub>50</sub> of UC is 2 [[milligram|mg]]·[[minute|min]]/m³, with a [[probit]] slope of 1.  The {{LD50}} is 5 [[milligram|mg]]·[[minute|min]]/m³, and unlike the per oral route is known to have a [[neurotoxic]] effect when inhaled.
