'''Saw palmetto extract''' is an extract of the fruit of ''[[Serenoa repens]]''. It is rich in [[fatty acid]]s and [[phytosterol]]s. It has been used in [[Traditional medicine|traditional]], [[Eclectic medicine|eclectic]], and [[alternative medicine]] to treat a variety of conditions, most notably [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH).  Review of clinical trials, including those conducted by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], found the extract to be no more effective than placebo for BPH.<ref name=Cochrane>{{cite journal | pmid = 19370565 | year = 2009 | last1 = Tacklind | first1 = J | last2 = MacDonald | first2 = R | last3 = Rutks | first3 = I | last4 = Wilt | first4 = TJ | title = Serenoa repens for benign prostatic hyperplasia | issue = 2 | pages = CD001423 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001423.pub2 | pmc = 3090655 | journal = Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) | editor1-last = Tacklind | editor1-first = James}}</ref>

==Medicinal use==

Saw palmetto is used in several forms of traditional [[herbal medicine]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] used the fruit for food and to treat a variety of [[Urinary system|urinary]] and [[reproductive system]] problems. The [[Maya civilization|Mayans]] drank it as a tonic, and the [[Seminole]]s used the berries as an [[expectorant]] and [[antiseptic]].<ref name="Mayo">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/saw-palmetto/NS_patient-sawpalmetto |title=Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens [Bartram] Small)] |accessdate=2011-12-15 |publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]] }}</ref> 

Crude saw palmetto extract was used by European/American medical practitioners for at least 200 years for various conditions, including asthenia (weakness), recovery from major illness, and urogenital problems. The [[eclectic medicine]] practitioner [[H. W. Felter]] wrote of it, "Saw palmetto is a nerve sedative, expectorant, and a nutritive tonic, acting kindly upon the digestive tract...Its most direct action appears to be upon the reproductive organs when undergoing waste of tissue..."<ref name="Felter">[http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/felter/serenoa.html Felter's complete text]</ref>

King's American Dispensatory (1898) says of the extract:
<blockquote>It is also an expectorant, and controls irritation of mucous tissues. It has proved useful in irritative cough, chronic bronchial coughs, whooping-cough, laryngitis, acute and chronic, acute [[catarrh]], asthma, tubercular laryngitis, and in the cough of [[Tuberculosis|phthisis pulmonalis]]. Upon the digestive organs it acts kindly, improving the appetite, digestion, and assimilation. However, its most pronounced effects appear to be those exerted upon the urino-genital tracts of both male and female, and upon all the organs concerned in reproduction. It is said to enlarge wasted organs, as the breasts, ovaries, and testicles, while the paradoxical claim is also made that it reduces hypertrophy of the prostate. Possibly this may be explained by claiming that it tends toward the production of a normal condition, reducing parts when unhealthily enlarged, and increasing them when atrophied.<ref>[http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/kings/serenoa.html King's American Dispensatory 1898]</ref></blockquote>

The latest Cochrane Database review (2009) concludes that "Serenoa repens was not more effective than placebo for treatment of urinary symptoms consistent with BPH."<ref name=Cochrane/>

A 2001 study published in JAMA (The [[Journal of the American Medical Association]]) reported on a double-blind study study that eleven North American clinics conducted  on 369 men. The study found that saw palmetto fruit extract failed to reduce urinary tract symptoms more than placebo.<ref name="JAMA">{{cite web|url= http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/306/12/1344.abstract?sid=a4fc4f87-b392-4bb6-99eb-9e36b49e371d | title= Effect of Increasing Doses of Saw Palmetto Extract on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms| publisher=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]| accessdate=2011-10-08}}</ref> Men in the experimental group experienced a 2.20 point drop in their American Urological Assn. Symptom Index (AUASI) score. However, men in the placebo group saw a 2.99 point drop. The [[Los Angeles Times]] reports, “42.6% of the men in the extract group saw their AUASI scores fall by at least three points; 44.2% of the men in the placebo group saw the same degree of benefit.” The study was funded by several offices within the [[NIH]], including the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]].”<ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/27/news/la-heb-enlarged-prostate-saw-palmetto-20110927| title= Saw palmetto extract likely won't relieve enlarged prostate symptoms| publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=27 September 2011| accessdate=2011-10-08}}</ref>


== Contraindications and side effects ==
Few side effects or allergic reactions are associated with saw palmetto extract use. The most common are gastrointestinal, some of which may be reduced by taking the extract with food. Use may increase the risk of bleeding or affect sex hormones, and concurrent use of other drugs with similar action should be avoided.<ref name=MedlinePlus />

Beta-[[sitosterol]], a chemical present in saw palmetto extract, is chemically similar to cholesterol. High levels of sitosterol concentrations in blood have correlated with increased severity of heart disease in men who previously suffered heart attacks.<ref name="Nutr">{{cite journal |author=Assmann G, Cullen P, Erbey J, Ramey DR, Kannenberg F, Schulte H |title=Plasma sitosterol elevations are associated with increased incidence of coronary events in men: results of a nested case-control analysis of the Prospective Cardiovascular Münster (PROCAM) study |journal=Nutrition, Metabolism, and Cardiovascular Diseases : NMCD |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16399487 |doi=10.1016/j.numecd.2005.04.001}}</ref>

As with other herbal preparations, precise chemical constituents may vary by manufacturer and batch. Contraindications include pregnancy, lactation due to antiandrogenic and estrogenic activity.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
