A '''Beating Heart Cadaver''' is a human body that though dead in all medical and legal definitions is attached to a [[medical ventilator]] and retains  cardio-pulmonary functions.  This will keep the [[organs]] of the dead body, including the [[heart]], functioning and alive for a few days.<ref name="stiff">[[Roach, Mary]]. ''Stiff: the Curious Lives of Human Cadavers''. New York: W.W. Norton &, 2003. Print.</ref>  As a result, the period of time in which the organs may be used for transplantation is extended.

==Care==
Caring for a beating heart cadaver is similar to caring for a living patient. Since the brain has stopped functioning, the hormone levels and blood pressure must be regulated by [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) personnel.<ref name="Roach170"/> The protocol for preserving the cadaver aims to prevent infection and maintain adequate [[oxygenation]] of tissue.<ref name= "surgerydoor">"Beating Heart Cadaver." Surgery Door. Web. 4 March 2010. <http://www.surgerydoor.co.uk/advice/organ-donation/beating-heart-donor/>.</ref> The cadaver's status must be continuously monitored, so that ICU staff can prevent organ failure or quickly operate to save threatened organs.<ref name="Roach170">Roach, p. 170.</ref>

==Organ recovery==
A beating heart cadaver is kept "alive" in order to keep its organs from decaying before they can be transplanted.  Surgeons will remove the organs, one after the other, and have them transferred to the recipients' treating teams.<ref name="stiff"/>  The entire recovery process is usually completed within four hours.<ref name="surgerydoor"/>  This process was formerly known as an "organ harvest", but the name has since changed to the milder "organ recovery."<ref name="stiff"/> Many organs can be extracted, and many lives can be saved by one body.  The bodies are generally those of [[Organ Donation|organ donors]], who have agreed beforehand to donate their organs.<ref>"Her Donated Organs Changed Lives of Many." San Diego News, Local, California and National News - SignOnSanDiego.com. Web. 4 March 2010. <http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/feb/27/her-donated-organs-changed-lives-of-many/>.</ref> Some donated organs are taken from [[Non-heart-beating donation|non-heart-beating donors]].<ref>"Physicians For Life - Abstinence, Abortion, Birth Control - Brain Death or NHBD." Physicians For Life - Abstinence, Abortion, Birth Control - Home. Web. 4 March 2010. <http://www.physiciansforlife.org/content/view/166/33/>.</ref> Organs from [[brain death]]s, however, have a better success rate, and currently most organ donation is from these deaths.<ref>"Organ Donation - What Does Organ Donation After Brain Death Mean." All About Surgery-Understanding Surgery from A to Z-Surgery Information-Surgery 101. Web. 3 March 2010. <http://surgery.about.com/od/proceduresaz/ss/OrganDonation_3.htm>.</ref>

==Brain death and pregnancy==
Pregnancy can be prolonged after brain death in order to allow the fetus to reach full-term. It is then possible to deliver the baby by means of ceasarian section.<ref>Bernstein IM, Watson M, Simmons GM, Catalano PM, Davis G, Collins R. Maternal brain death and prolonged fetal survival. Obstet Gynecol. 1989 Sep;74(3 Pt 2):434-7.<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2761925></ref>  The cadaver's organs may then be removed for donation.

==Social issues==
Being faced with a beating heart cadaver is often a disturbing and confusing experience.  Because the heart is beating and the body is warm, people may have difficulty believing the person is dead.  Families often like to see the body once it has been removed from the machines and "put to rest".<ref name="surgerydoor"/>
