It adopted the current name of Royal Society of Medicine in 1907 when a number of independent societies, including the [[Epidemiological Society of London]] founded in 1850, whose members had included [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]],<ref name=r1>

The Society publishes an eponymous Journal, the [[JRSM]]. For those potentially interested in becoming a doctor and wanting to know what it entails, the society also publishes a comprehensive guide to medical school application, entitled [http://www.acareerinmedicine.net/ A career in medicine]. The society also owns the nearby [[Chandos House]], designed by the 18th century architect [[Robert Adam]], which it runs as a venue facility.

Scientists are elected to the Society following nomination and committee review. It takes members from a wide range of professions including medicine, dentistry, veterinary sciences and allied healthcare specialities. It also welcomes students members of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science to join.  An elite group of physicians or scientists are elected annually to fellowship or as Honorary Fellows.

==Edward Jenner Medal==

The award was founded in 1896 by the [[Epidemiological Society of London]] (1850–1907) to commemorate the centenary of [[Edward Jenner]]’s discovery of a means of [[smallpox]] [[vaccination]]. It is awarded periodically to individuals who have undertaken distinguished work in [[epidemiological research]].

The medal was designed in Bronze by [[Allan Wyon]]. It features Jenner’s face on one aspect and the symbol of the Epidemiological Society, the Earth, on the reverse. The medal was re-cast following the evolution of the Society into the Section of Epidemiology at the RSM in 1907.  Photographs of the medal may be found in ''The History of the Royal Society of Medicine''<ref name=r1/> published in 2001.

It was first awarded to Sir [[William Henry Power]] who was the then Medical Officer for London and had formulated the theory of aerial conveyance of smallpox and chaired the Royal Commission on [[Tuberculosis]].<ref>[http://www.rsm.ac.uk/academ/downloads/ep-public-history.pdf History of the section of Epidemiology & Public Health]</ref>
