'''Thessalus of Tralles''' (fl. circa 70-95 AD) was a famous Roman physician and early adherent to the [[Methodic school]] of medicine.<ref>Bartlett, Elisha and Stempsey, William E. ''Elisha Bartlett's Philosophy of Medicine''. Springer, 2005, ISBN 1-4020-3041-X, p. 223. [Notes] "Thessalus of Tralles (fl. c. A.D. 70-95) was a prominent Roman physician and early advocate of methodism."</ref> He lived in [[Rome]],<ref name="pliny1">Pliny, ''H. N.'' xxix. 5</ref> where he was the court physician of [[Emperor Nero]]. It was here that he died and was buried, and his tomb was to be seen on the ''[[Via Appia]]''.<ref name="galen1">Galen, ''De Meth. Med.'', i. 2, vol. x</ref>

He was from [[Tralles]] in [[Lydia]]. He was the son of a weaver, and followed the same employment himself in his youth.<ref name="galen1"/> This, however, he soon gave up, and, though he had a poor general education, he embraced the medical profession, by which he acquired for a time a great reputation, and amassed a large fortune. He adopted the principles of the Methodic school, but modified and developed them. He appears to have exalted himself at the expense to his predecessors;<ref name="pliny1"/> asserting that none of them had contributed to the advance of medical science,<ref name="galen1"/> and boasting that he himself could teach the art of healing in six months. [[Galen]] frequently mentions him, but always in terms of contempt,<ref>Galen, ''De Meth. Med.'', i. 1, etc. vol. x; ''Adv. Julian.'' c. 1, etc. vol. xviii. pt. i., etc.</ref> and is often abusive towards him.

He supported a method of treatment that he named ''metasyncrisis''.<ref>[[Thaddus E. Weckowicz|E. Weckowicz, Thaddeus E.]] and Liebel-Weckowicz, Helen P. ''A History of Great Ideas in Abnormal Psychology''. Elsevier, 1990, ISBN 0-444-88391-6, p. 30. "Thessalus of Tralles (first century A.D.), was a court physician of Nero. He advocated a method of treatment which he called ''metasyncrisis''. By means of some violent procedure a thorough commotion of the patient's fundamental constitution took place which led to the reestablishment of the equilibrium compatible with a state of health."</ref> His object was, in obstinate chronic cases, where other remedies failed, to attempt a thorough change in the fundamental constitution of the organism (''syncrisis''). He began by the application, for three days, of strong vegetable remedies, both internally and externally, together with which, a strict regimen and [[emetic]]s were applied. This was the preparation to a system of [[fasting]], which concluded with a course of restoratives.<ref name="smith">William Smith, (1870), ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', Volume 3, page 1102</ref>

Interestingly, Thessalus regarded the [[chicory]] plant to be an [[herb]] of the [[sun]].<ref>Wood, Matthew. ''The Earthwise Herbal: A Complete Guide to Old World Medicinal Plants''. North Atlantic Books, 2008, ISBN 1-55643-692-0, p. 189. "'''Cichorium intybus. Chicory.''' ''Chicory is a member of the Asteraceae family, distinguished by its rare blue flower. It was anciently used by the Greeks and Romans. Thessalus of Tralles (c. 50 CE) states that it is an herb of the sun; he reports learning his astrological medicine directly from the demigod Asclepius.''"</ref> He wrote several medical works, of which only the titles and a few sentences remain.<ref name="smith"/>
