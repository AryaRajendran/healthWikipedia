People who are malnourished may:
*not consume adequate calories and protein for growth and maintenance, such as undernutrition or [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM)<ref name= "WHO 2001">{{Cite web|author= World Health Organization |title=Water-related diseases: Malnutrition |year= 2001 |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/malnutrition/en/.}}</ref>
*consume too many calories ([[overnutrition]])<ref name= "WHO 2001" />
*have abnormal nutrient loss (due to diarrhoea or chronic illness) or increased energy expenditure (secondary malnutrition)<ref name= "WHO 2001" /><ref name="Grover 2009">{{cite journal|last=Grover|first=Zubin|coauthors=Ee, Looi C.|title=Protein Energy Malnutrition|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|year=2009|volume=56|issue=5|pages=1055–1068|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2009.07.001|pmid=19931063}}</ref>

Undernutrition encompasses stunting, wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which literally describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has also been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.<ref name="Black2008" />

The term ''severe malnutrition'' is often used to refer specifically to PEM.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics">{{cite book|last=Walker|first=[edited by] Christopher Duggan, John B. Watkins, W. Allan|title=Nutrition in pediatrics : basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&f=false}}</ref> PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /> Two forms of PEM are kwashiorkor and marasmus, and they commonly coexist.<ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" />

[[Kwashiorkor]] (‘displaced child’) is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake resulting in a low concentration of amino acids.<ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /> The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.<ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /> Kwashiorkor is identified by swelling of the extremities and belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.<ref name="Chowdhury 2008" />

[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of both protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.<ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /> Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.<ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /> It is traditionally seen in famine, food restriction, or anorexia.<ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /> Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.<ref name="Chowdhury 2008" />

===Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.<ref name="Stevenson 2011">{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=R. D.|coauthors=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}</ref> The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.<ref name="Grover 2009" /> The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.<ref name="Stevenson 2011" /> An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.<ref name="Gueri 1980">{{cite journal|last=Gueri|first=M.|coauthors=J.

===Waterlow===
In a paper titled "Classification and Definition of Protein-Calorie Malnutrition", [[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.<ref name="Waterlow 1972"/>  Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.<ref name="J. C. Waterlow">{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=NaN undefined NaN|year=2010|month=December|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}</ref> Waterlow was the chair of human nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine from 1970 to 1982, and was considered an expert on severe malnutrition and malnutrition in children.

These classifications of malnutrition are commonly used with some modifications by WHO.<ref name="Grover 2009"/>

==Effects==
Malnutrition increases the risk of infection and infectious disease, and moderate malnutrition weakens every part of the immune system.<ref name="Stillwaggon 2008" />  For example, it is a major risk factor in the onset of active [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pmed.0040115}}</ref> Protein and energy malnutrition and deficiencies of specific micronutrients (including iron, zinc, and vitamins) increase susceptibility to infection.<ref name="Stillwaggon 2008">{{cite journal|last=Stillwaggon|first=Eileen|title=Race, Sex, and the Neglected Risks for Women and Girls in Sub-Saharan Africa|journal=Feminist Economics|year=2008|volume=14|issue=4|pages=67–86|doi=10.1080/13545700802262923}}</ref> Malnutrition affects HIV transmission by increasing the risk of transmission from mother to child and also increasing replication of the virus.<ref name="Stillwaggon 2008" /> In communities or areas that lack access to safe drinking water, these additional health risks present a critical problem. Lower energy and impaired function of the brain also represent the downward spiral of malnutrition as victims are less able to perform the tasks they need to in order to acquire food, earn an income, or gain an education.

===Mortality===
[[File:Niger childhood malnutrition 16oct06.jpg|thumb|right|Malnourished children in [[Niger]], during the 2005 famine.]]
According to Jean Ziegler(the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58 percent of the total mortality in 2006: "In the world, approximately 62 million people, all causes of death combined, die each year. One in twelve people worldwide is malnourished and according to the [[Save the Children]] 2012 report, one in four of the world’s children are chronically malnourished.<ref>http://www.savethechildren.org/atf/cf/%7B9def2ebe-10ae-432c-9bd0-df91d2eba74a%7D/STATE-OF-THE-WORLDS-MOTHERS-REPORT-2012-FINAL.PDF</ref><ref name="library.thinkquest.org">[http://library.thinkquest.org/C002291/high/present/stats.htm The world hunger problem: Facts, figures and statistics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2006, more than 36 million died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients".<ref>{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Ziegler |authorlink=Jean Ziegler |title=L'Empire de la honte |publisher=Fayard |location= |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-253-12115-2 |page=130 }}</ref>

According to the World Health Organization, malnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to [[child mortality]], present in half of all cases.<ref name=economist/> Six million children die of hunger every year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/11/17/italy.food.summit/ | work=CNN | title=U.N. chief: Hunger kills 17,000 kids daily | date=2009-11-17}}</ref> [[Underweight]] births and intrauterine growth restrictions cause 2.2 million child deaths a year. Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of [[vitamin A]] or [[zinc]], for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition in the first two years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower educational achievements. Their own children also tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea. But malnutrition actually causes diseases as well, and can be fatal in its own right.<ref name=economist/>

===Psychological===
Malnutrition in the form of [[iodine deficiency]] is "the most common preventable cause of mental impairment worldwide."<ref name=salt>{{cite news |author= |title=In raising the world's IQ the secret is in salt |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=2006-12-16 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html?fta=y |first=Donald G. |last=McNeil Jr}}</ref> Even moderate iodine deficiency, especially in pregnant women and infants, lowers intelligence by 10 to 15 I.Q. points, shaving incalculable potential off a nation’s development.<ref name=salt/> The most visible and severe effects — disabling goiters, cretinism and dwarfism — affect a tiny minority, usually in mountain villages. But 16 percent of the world’s people have at least mild goiter, a swollen thyroid gland in the neck.<ref name=salt/>

[[Iron deficiency anemia]] in children under two years of age likely affects brain function acutely and probably also chronically.

[[Protein-calorie malnutrition]] can cause cognitive impairments. For humans, "critical period varies from the final third of gestation to the first 2 years of life".<ref>{{cite doi|10.3390/ijerph8020590}}</ref>

Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], the four most common mental disorders in developed countries.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1186/1475-2891-7-2}}</ref> Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (each of which are an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] contained in [[fish oil]], but not in [[flaxseed oil]]), [[vitamin B12]], [[folic acid]], and [[inositol]].

====Impact on learning====
Research indicates that improving the awareness of nutritious meal choices and establishing long-term habits of healthy eating has a positive effect on a cognitive and spatial memory capacity, potentially increasing a student's potential to process and retain academic information.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Some organizations have begun working with teachers, policymakers, and managed food service contractors to mandate improved nutritional content and increased nutritional resources in school cafeterias from primary to university level institutions.

=== Cancer ===
According to a study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], "In the developing world, cancers of the liver, stomach and esophagus were more common, often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods, such as smoked or salted food, and parasitic infections that attack organs." Developed countries "tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle' — cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and prostate — that can be caused by obesity, lack of exercise, diet and age."<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Coren| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/03/09/cancer.study/index.html | title=Study: Cancer no longer rare in poorer countries | publisher= CNN | date=2005-03-10 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> Weight loss in cancer patients of over 10 percent of pre-illness weight, or weight in the preceding 3–6 months, is often associated with a high risk of malnutrition.<ref>{{cite doi | 10.1016/S0936-6555(03)00155-9}}</ref>

=== Metabolic syndrome ===
[[File:Insulinresistance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Insulin resistance]] model.]]
Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyle-induced [[hyperinsulinemia]] and reduced insulin function (i.e. [[insulin resistance]]) as a decisive factor in many disease states. For example, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation, which in turn is associated with a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and [[clot]] formation (i.e. heart disease) as well as exaggerated cell division (i.e. cancer). Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (the so-called [[metabolic syndrome]]) are characterized by a combination of abdominal obesity, elevated [[blood sugar]], elevated [[blood pressure]], elevated blood [[triglycerides]], and reduced HDL [[cholesterol]]. The negative impact of hyperinsulinemia on prostaglandin PGE1/PGE2 balance may be significant.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The state of obesity clearly contributes to insulin resistance, which in turn can cause [[type 2 diabetes]]. Virtually all obese and most type 2 diabetic individuals have marked insulin resistance. Although the association between overweight and insulin resistance is clear, the exact (likely multifarious) causes of insulin resistance remain less clear. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that appropriate exercise, more regular food intake and reducing [[glycemic load]] (see below) all can reverse insulin resistance in overweight individuals (and thereby lower blood sugar levels in those who have type 2 diabetes).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone [[leptin]], and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores. In addition, reduced leptin signalling to the brain may reduce leptin's normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors&mdash; such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals&mdash;contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance. In any case, analogous to the way modern man-made pollution may potentially overwhelm the environment's ability to maintain [[homeostasis]], the recent explosive introduction of high [[glycemic index]] and processed foods into the human diet may potentially overwhelm the body's ability to maintain homeostasis and health (as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Causes==
[[Image:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]], 1865]]
Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as in [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/s11205-004-5579-8}}</ref>

===Diseases and infections===
Malnutrition can be a consequence of health issues such as [[gastroenteritis]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Dolin|first=[edited by] Gerald L. Mandell, John E.

===Dietary practices===
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes continues three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=2012 Jun |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}</ref>

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.<ref name=Burchi>{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=2011 Feb |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |author=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}</ref>

Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.<ref name=Gardner00/> Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]” where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedent over healthy nutritious foods.<ref name=Gardner00/> Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.<ref name=Gardner00/> The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Oftentimes fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.<ref name=Gardner00_5/> However, overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.<ref name=Gardner00/> Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|170px|A child suffering extreme malnutrition in [[India]], 1972]]
In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.<ref name="Factors in Bangladesh">{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=MM|coauthors=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore medical journal|year=2009|month=August|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}</ref> As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.<ref name=Gardner00>{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}</ref> The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.<ref name=Sen81>{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TcNZtwAACAAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}</ref>

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |date= |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}</ref>

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.<ref name=newyorktimes/><ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= 2006-02-06|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}</ref> Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.<ref name=newyorktimes/>
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneer [[Norman Borlaug]].<ref name=atlantic/>

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

Climate change is of great importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest IPCC reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."<ref name=ipcc>{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=12–17 November 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref> Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.<ref name=ipcc /> Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.<ref>Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. 27 October 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}</ref> Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.<ref name=ipcc /><ref>{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |work=Science & Environment |newspaper=BBC News |date=August 9, 2010 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}</ref>

An [[epidemic]] of [[wheat stem rust]] caused by race [[Ug99]] is currently spreading across Africa and into Asia and, it is feared, could wipe out more than 80 percent of the world’s wheat crops.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Millions face famine as crop disease rages |agency= |work= |newspaper=Guardian |date=2007-04-22 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/apr/22/food.foodanddrink |location=London |first1=Robin |last1=McKie |first2=Xan |last2=Rice}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A time bomb for world wheat crop |newspaper=LA Times |date=2009-06-14 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/14/science/sci-wheat-rust14 |first=Karen |last=Kaplan}}</ref>

==Management==
{{See also|Famine relief}}
Fighting malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.<ref name=IQ>{{cite news |author= |title=Raising the world's IQ |agency= |work= The New York Times|newspaper= |date=2008-12-04 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html |first=Nicholas D. |last=Kristof}}</ref> The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.<ref name=hiddenhunger/><ref name="Let them eat micronutrients">{{cite news |author= |title=Let them eat micronutrients |agency= |work= |newspaper=Newsweek |date= |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075}}</ref> However, roughly $300 million of aid goes to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.<ref name=economist/> In contrast, [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which causes fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.<ref name=economist/>

===Emergency measures===
[[File:Spirulina tablets.jpg|thumb|right|Tablets of the therapeutic [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] dietary supplement.]]
Micronutrients can be obtained through [[food fortification|fortifying foods]].<ref name=hiddenhunger/> Fortifying foods such as [[peanut butter]] sachets (see [[Plumpy'Nut]]) and [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] have revolutionized emergency feeding in humanitarian emergencies because they can be eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with scarce clean water, can be stored for years and, vitally, can be absorbed by extremely ill children.<ref name=BBC/> The United Nations World Food Conference of 1974 declared Spirulina as 'the best food for the future' and its ready harvest every 24 hours makes it a potent tool to eradicate malnutrition. Additionally, supplements, such as Vitamin A capsules or [[Zinc]] tablets to cure [[diarrhea]] in children, are used.<ref name=time/>

There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.<ref name=csmonitor/> The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.<ref name=csmonitor/><ref name=wfp/> The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.<ref name=csmonitor/>

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.<ref name=csmonitor/> [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."<ref>Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)</ref> U.S. Law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.<ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"/> Fred Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."<ref>memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York) — July 1994</ref> [[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=2008-05-06 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2}}</ref> Not only has Ethiopia been pioneering a program but Brazil has also established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, this reduces the country's waste and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.<ref name=Gardner00_5>{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |page=5 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}</ref>

===Prevention===

[[File:Vallee fertile du Nil a Louxor.jpg|thumb|right|[[Irrigation]] canals have opened dry desert areas of [[Egypt]] to agriculture.]]
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= 2007-10-10|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}</ref> Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.<ref name=newyorktimes/><ref>{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=2008-06-18 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}</ref> For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.<ref name=newyorktimes/> This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.<ref name=newyorktimes/> Proponents for investing in agriculture include [[Jeffrey Sachs]], who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa’s farmers.<ref name=obama/><ref name=newyorktimes/>

Breastfeeding education helps. Breastfeeding in the first two years and exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months could save 1.3 million children’s lives.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Millions of children dying needlessly |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= 2003-06-26|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3022558.stm}}</ref> In the longer term, firms are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.<ref name=BBC/>

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through “moral restraint.”<ref>{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}</ref> Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF02436122}}</ref> However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.<ref>Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.</ref><ref>Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)</ref> For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, “no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation.”<ref name=Sen81/> One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]], the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market. Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/heapol/czl010}}</ref><ref>Nyonator, Frank, J Koku Awooner-Williams, James Phillips, Tanya Jones, Robert Miller.

(2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute</ref> By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

When aiming to prevent rather than treat overeating, which is also a form of malnutrition, starting in the school environment would be the perfect place as this is where the education children receive today will help them choose healthier foods during childhood, as well as into adulthood. As seen in Singapore, if we increase nutrition in school lunch programs and physical activity for children and teachers, obesity can be reduced by almost 30–50 percent.<ref name=Gardner00 />

Undernutrition is an important determinant of maternal and child health, accounting for more than a third of child deaths and more than 10 percent of the total [[global disease burden]] according to 2008 studies.<ref name="Black2008">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61690-0}}</ref>

===In women===
Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country.<ref name="Nube 2003" /> These small-scale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="Nube 2003" /> Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of undernutrition were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates.<ref name="Nube 2003">{{Cite doi| 10.1080/0301446031000119601}}</ref> Gender inequality in nutrition in some countries such as India is present in all stages of life.<ref name="Women 2008">{{cite journal|last=Dewan|first=Manju|title=Malnutrition in Women|journal=Stud.

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.<ref name="Nube 2003" />  Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.<ref name="Women 2008" /> The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.<ref name="Women 2008" /> In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=March 2012}}</ref>

Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.<ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001">{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=http://www.fao.org/sd/2001/PE0703a_en.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations|accessdate=March 2012}}</ref> Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.<ref name="Nube 2003" /> Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.<ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" />  Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.<ref name="Nube 2003" /> During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).<ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /> In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in developing countries and increased the risk of death during childbirth.<ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /> A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).<ref name="Bhutta 2008" /> Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.<ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" />  Household chores and agricultural tasks can be arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.<ref name="Nube 2003" /> According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.<ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" />

The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition accounts for 54 percent of child mortality worldwide,<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /> about 1 million children.<ref name=ENJM013113 /> Even mild degrees of malnutrition double the risk of mortality for respiratory and diarrheal disease mortality and malaria.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /> This risk is greatly increased in more severe cases of malnutrition.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /> There are three commonly used measures for detecting malnutrition in children: stunting (extremely low height for age), underweight (extremely low weight for age), and wasting (extremely low weight for height).<ref name="Wagstaff 1999" /> These measures of malnutrition are interrelated, but studies for the World Bank found that only 9 percent of children exhibit stunting, underweight, and wasting.<ref name="Wagstaff 1999">{{cite web|title=Socioeconomic Inequalities in Child Malnutrition in the Developing World|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=632505|work=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 2434|accessdate=March 2012|author=Adam Wagstaff|coauthors=Naoke Watanabe|month=November|year=1999}}</ref> According to a 2008 review an estimated 178 million children under age 5 are stunted, most of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="Bhutta 2008" /> A 2008 review of malnutrition found that about 55 million children are wasted, including 19 million who have severe wasting or severe acute malnutrition.<ref name="Bhutta 2008" /> Measurements of a child’s growth provide the key information for the presence of malnutrition, but weight and height measurements alone can lead to failure to recognize kwashiorkor and an underestimation of the severity of malnutrition in children.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" />

The 2008 Copenhagen Consensus estimated that undernutrition causes 35 percent of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years old, and that the nutrition of children 5 years and younger depends strongly on the nutrition level of their mothers during pregnancy and breastfeeding.<ref name="Challenge 2008">{{cite web|title=The Challenge of Hunger and Malnutrition|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Files/Filer/CC08/Papers/0%20Challenge%20Papers/CP_HungerandMalnutritionCC08vol2.pdf|work=Copenhagen Consensus Challenge Paper|accessdate=March 2012|author=Sue Horton|coauthors=Harold Alderman, Juan A.

Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition are very thin, but they often also have swollen hands and feet, making the internal problems more evident to health workers.<ref name="Facts for Life" /> Undernutrition in children causes direct structural damage to the brain and impairs infant motor development and exploratory behavior.<ref name="Victora 2008" /> Children who are undernourished before age two and gain weight quickly later in childhood and in adolescence are at high risk of chronic diseases related to nutrition.<ref name="Victora 2008" /> Inadequate food intake, infections, psychosocial deprivation, the environment, and perhaps genetics contribute.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /> Children with severe malnutrition are very susceptible to infection.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /> However, children with chronic diseases like HIV have a higher risk of malnutrition, since their bodies cannot absorb nutrients as well.<ref name="Facts for Life" />  Diseases such as measles are a major cause of malnutrition in children; thus immunizations present a way to relieve the burden.<ref name="Facts for Life" />

Studies have found a strong association between undernutrition and child mortality.<ref name="Bhutta 2008" /> Once malnutrition is treated, adequate growth is an indication of health and recovery.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /> Even after recovering from severe malnutrition, children often remain stunted for the rest of their lives.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /> A study in Bangladesh in 2009 reported that rates of malnutrition were higher in female children than male children.<ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /> Other studies show that, at the national level, differences between undernutrition prevalence rates between young boys and girls are generally small.<ref name="Nube 2003" /> Girls often have a lower nutritional status in South and Southeastern Asia compared to boys.<ref name="Nube 2003" /> In other developing regions, the nutritional status of girls is slightly higher.<ref name="Nube 2003" /> In almost all countries, the poorest quintile of children has the highest rate of malnutrition.<ref name= "Wagstaff 1999" /> However, inequalities in malnutrition between children of poor and rich families vary from country to country, with studies finding large gaps in Peru and very small gaps in Egypt.<ref name= "Wagstaff 1999" /> In 2000, rates of child malnutrition were much higher in low income countries (36 percent) compared to middle income countries (12 percent) and the United States (1 percent).<ref name= "Wagstaff 1999" />

Measures have been taken to reduce child malnutrition. Studies for the World Bank found that, from 1970–2000, the number of malnourished children decreased by 20 percent in developing countries.<ref name= "Wagstaff 1999" /> Iodine supplement trials in pregnant women have been shown to reduce offspring deaths during infancy and early childhood by 29 percent.<ref name="Facts for Life" /> However, universal salt iodization has largely replaced this intervention.<ref name="Facts for Life" /> The Progresa program in Mexico combined [[conditional cash transfer]]s with nutritional education and micronutrient-fortified food supplements; this resulted in a 10 percent reduction the prevalence of stunting in children 12–36 months old.<ref name="Bhutta 2008" /> Milk fortified with zinc and iron reduced the incidence of diarrhea by 18 percent in a study in India. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and dehydration caused by diarrhea, but mothers are sometimes wrongly advised to not breastfeed their children.<ref name="Facts for Life" />  Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce mortality in infants and young children.<ref name="Bhutta 2008" /> Since only 38 percent of children worldwide under 6 months are exclusively breastfed, education programs could have large impacts on children malnutrition rates.<ref name="unicef" />  However, breastfeeding cannot fully prevent PEM if not enough nutrients are consumed.<ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" />
