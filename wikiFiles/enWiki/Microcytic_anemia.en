'''[[Microcyte|Microcytic]] [[anemia]]''' ([[BrE]]:  '''anaemia''') is a generic term for any type of anemia characterized by small [[red blood cell]]s. The normal [[mean corpuscular volume]] (abbreviated to MCV on [[complete blood count|full blood count]] results) is 76-100 [[femtolitre|fL]], with smaller cells (<76 fL) described as microcytic and larger cells (>100 fL) as macrocytic.

In microcytic anemia, the red blood cells (erythrocytes) are usually also hypochromic, meaning that the red blood cells are paler than usual. This can be quantified as the mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), the amount of hemoglobin per cell; the normal value is 27-32 picograms (pg). Similar is the [[mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration]] (MCHC), giving the amount of hemoglobin per volume of erythrocytes (normally about 320-360 g/L or 32-36 g/dL). Typically, therefore, anemia of this category is described as "microcytic, hypochromic anemia".

==Causes==
Typical causes of microcytic anemia include:
* childhood

** [[thalassemia]]

** [[iron deficiency anemia]]
** [[sideroblastic anemia]], congenital or acquired

 |pmid=21934347|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?DOI=000331283&typ=pdf}}</ref> although this more typically causes [[normochromic]], normocytic anemia. Microcytic anemia has been discussed by Weng et al.<ref name=pmid21934347 /> 
** [[lead poisoning]]
** [[pyridoxine deficiency]]

Other causes that are typically thought of as causing [[normocytic anemia]] or [[macrocytic anemia]] must also be considered, and the presence of two or more causes of anemia can distort the typical picture.
