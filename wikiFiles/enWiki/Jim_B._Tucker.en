==Biography==

Tucker attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA Degree]] in [[psychology]] and a medical degree. He is currently Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences, and in addition to conducting research, he is the medical director of the [[University of Virginia]] Child & Family Psychiatry Clinic.<ref name="bio">[http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/psychiatry/sections/cspp/dops/staff/jimbio-page Jim B. Tucker, MD]- University of Virginia profile</ref>

He lives in Charlottesville, VA with his wife, Christine McDowell Tucker, a clinical psychologist,<ref>[http://www.rutherford.org/internship/speakerschedule2009.asp Rutherford Institutes Summer Speaker Series speakers schedule]</ref> and has presented at academic and public conferences.<ref name="bio"/><ref>[http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=7746 The Unexplained - San Francisco Conference on proof of afterlife]</ref>
Tucker felt unfulfilled by his work in child psychiatry, but was open to the possibility that humans are more than their physical bodies and wished to investigate the matter further.<ref>{{citation

==Reincarnation research==
{{Main|Reincarnation research}}

While Ian Stevenson focused on cases in Asia, Tucker has studied American children.<ref>Miller, Lisa (Sunday, August 29, 2010). "Remembrances of Lives Past." [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/fashion/29PastLives.html?pagewanted=3&_r=2 New York Times]</ref>

Tucker reports that in about 70% of the cases of children claiming to remember past lives the deceased died from an unnatural cause, suggesting that traumatic death may be linked to the hypothesized survival of personality.  He further indicates that the time between death and apparent rebirth is, on average, 16 months, and that unusual birthmarks might match fatal wounds suffered by the deceased.<ref>[http://archive.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2005/08/31.html Coast to Coast AM]|Tucker explained that individual cases are investigated and checked for accuracy. For instance, birthmarks of an unusual shape or size might match up with fatal wounds that the deceased had.</ref>

Tucker has developed the Strength Of Case Scale (SOCS), which evaluates what Tucker sees as four aspects of potential cases of reincarnation;<ref>Tucker, Jim (2000), ‘A scale to measure the strength and weakness of children’s claims of previous lives: Methodology and initial findings’, ''[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]]'', 14 (4), pp 571–81.</ref><ref>Mills, Antonia. ‘Back from Death: Young Adults in Northern India Who as Children Were Said to Remember a Previous Life, with or without a Shift in Religion (Hindu to Moslem or Vice Versa)’, in ''Anthropology and Humanism'', Volume 31. December 2008</ref> "(1) whether it involves birthmarks/defects that correspond to the supposed previous life; (2) the strength of the statements about the previous life; (3) the relevant behaviours as they relate to the previous life; and (4) an evaluation of the possibility of a connection between the child reporting a previous life and the supposed previous life".<ref name=edelmann>Edelmann, J. [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2007/00000014/00000012/art00004;jsessionid=bsrqcpr6k339.alexandra Setting Criteria for Ideal Reincarnation Research] ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'', 14, No. 12, 2007, pp. 92–101</ref>

Although critics have argued there is no physical explanation for the survival of personality, Tucker suggests that [[quantum mechanics]] may offer a mechanism by which memories and emotions could carry over from one life to another.<ref name="sfgate"/><ref name="metro">{{cite news |first=James |last=Ellis  |title=Have we met before? |work=Metro |date=Tuesday, March 7, 2006 |accessdate=17 July 2009  |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/home/article.html?in_article_id=10745&in_page_id=1 }}</ref> He argues that since the act of observation collapses wave equations, consciousness may not be merely a by-product of the physical brain but rather a separate entity in the universe that impinges on the physical.  Tucker argues that viewing consciousness as a fundamental, non-physical, part of the universe makes it  possible to conceive of it continuing to exist after the death of the physical brain.<ref>Tucker JB. ''[[Life Before Life]]: A Scientific Investigation of Children's Memories of Previous Lives'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 2005, 256pp. ISBN 0-312-32137-</ref> He provides the analogy of a television set and the television transmission; the television is required to decode the signal, but it does not create the signal.  In a similar way the brain may be required for consciousness to express itself, but may not be the source of consciousness.

However, there's no evidence quantum mechanics is relevant any more than asking quantum mechanics to prove or disprove the existence of God.'}}</ref>

==Media coverage==
Since taking over the research into claimed past life memories from Ian Stevenson in 2002, Tucker has been interviewed about reincarnation in print and broadcast media in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.<ref name="nationalpost"/><ref name="sfgate"/><ref name="metro"/><ref name="Soul Search"/><ref name=DailyMail/><ref name=oprah/><ref name=adler/><ref name="storyhousepro.com"/><ref name="Good Morning America"/><ref name="ch5"/>

In 2006, Tucker investigated the case of Cameron Macaulay as part of the Channel 5 Documentary ''Extraordinary People: The Boy Who Lived Before''. Tucker’s investigation took him firstly to [[Glasgow]] to interview the six-year-old and his mother Norma about Cameron’s reported recollections of life on the isle of [[Barra]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], around 200 miles from the family’s home in Glasgow. Tucker then accompanied the family as they traveled to Barra in an attempt to verify Cameron’s statements about life on the island.<ref name=ch5/>

The documentary also briefly covered another of Tucker’s cases: that of Gus Taylor from the American [[Midwest]], who reportedly claimed from around the age of 18-months to be his own grandfather returned to the family. In addition to speaking of a previous life, Tucker notes that both boys speak of falling through a ‘porthole’ or ‘hole’ from one life to the next.<ref name=ch5/>

In 2009, he was interviewed on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' about the cases he has studied.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0912/22/lkl.01.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com}}</ref>
