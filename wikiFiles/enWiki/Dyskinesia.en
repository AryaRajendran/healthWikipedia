'''Dyskinesia''' is a [[movement disorder]] which consists of [[adverse effect]]s including diminished voluntary movements<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000033093|dyskinesia}}</ref> and the presence of involuntary movements, similar to [[tic]]s or [[Choreia (disease)|chorea]]. Dyskinesia can be anything from a slight tremor of the hands to uncontrollable movement of, most commonly, the upper body but can also be seen in the lower extremities. Discoordination can also occur internally especially with the respiratory muscles and it often goes unrecognized.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Healy|title=Psychiatric Drugs Explained|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ikTJViYMPIEC|accessdate=16 December 2010|date=3 December 2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7020-2997-4|pages=29–30}}</ref> Dyskinesia is a [[symptom]] of several [[medical disorder]]s and is distinguished by the underlying cause.

==Types==
{{Prose|date=August 2011}}

===Acute===
[[Acute dystonia]] is a cerebral type of palsy.

[[Levodopa-induced dyskinesia]] (LID) is evident in patients with [[Parkinson's disease]] who have been on [[levodopa]] for prolonged periods of time. LID commonly first appears in the foot, on the most affected side of the body. There are three main types that can be classified on the basis of their course and clinical presentation following an oral dose of L-dopa:<ref name=Fabbrini>{{cite journal|last=Fabbrini|first=Giovanni|coauthors=Brotchie JM, Grandas F, Nomoto M, Goetz CG |title= Levodopa-induced dyskinesias|journal=Movement Disorders |year= 2007 |volume= 22| issue= 10 |pages= 1379–1389 |url=https://ssl4.pair.com/mds/education/journalcme/journalcme_0707Fabbrini.pdf| accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=Thanvi>{{cite journal| last= Thanvi |first= Bhomraj |coauthors= Lo N., Robinson T.|title=Levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease: clinical features, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment| journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal| year= 2007| volume= 83| pages= 384–388 |doi= 10.1136/pgmj.2006.054759| url=http://pmj.bmj.com/content/83/980/384.full.pdf+html|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref>
* [[Off-period dystonia]] - correlated to the [[akinesia]] that occurs before the full effect of L-dopa sets in, when the plasma levels of L-dopa are low. It generally occurs as painful spasms in the foot. They will respond to L-dopa therapy.<ref name=Fabbrini/><ref name=Thanvi/>
* [[Diphasic dyskinesia]] - occurs when [[blood plasma|plasma]] levodopa levels are rising or falling. This form tends to predominate in lower limbs, and is usually [[dystonic]] or [[ballistic]]. It does not respond to L-dopa reduction.<ref name=Fabbrini/><ref name=Thanvi/>
* [[Peak-dose dyskinesia]] - the most common form of LID; it correlates with the plateau L-dopa plasma level. This type usually involves the upper limbs more (but could also affect the head, trunk and respiratory muscles), is choreic, and less disabling. They will respond to L-dopa reduction but may be accompanied by deterioration of [[parkinsonism]].<ref name=Fabbrini/><ref name=Thanvi/> Peak-dose Levodopa-induced dyskinesia has recently been suggested to be associated with cortical dysregulation of dopamine signaling.<ref>{{cite journal|last=M.Tamtè/P.Halje|first=|coauthors=U.Richter, M.Mohammed, A.Cenci, P.Petersson|title=Levodopa-induced dyskinesia is strongly associated with resonant cortical oscillations|journal=Journal of Neuroscience,|year=2012|month=November|volume=32|issue=47|pages=16541-16551|pmid=23175810}}</ref>

===Chronic/tardive===
Late onset dyskinesia, also known as [[tardive dyskinesia]], occurs after [[therapy|treatment]] with an [[antipsychotic]] [[drug]] such as [[haloperidol]] (Haldol) or [[amoxapine]] (Asendin). The symptoms include tremors and writhing movements of the body and limbs and abnormal movements in the face, mouth, and tongue, including involuntary lip smacking, repetitive pouting of the lips, and tongue protrusions.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Healy|title=Psychiatric Drugs Explained|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ikTJViYMPIEC|accessdate=16 December 2010|date=3 December 2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7020-2997-4|pages=30–31}}</ref>

[[Rabbit syndrome]] is another type of chronic dyskinesia, while orofacial dyskinesia may be related to persistent replication of Herpes Simplex Virus type-1 (Gonzales GR, 1992)

===Non-motor===
Two other types, [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], and [[biliary dyskinesia]], are caused by specific kinds of ineffective movement of the body, and are not [[movement disorder]]s.
Spastic thrusting of hip area can occur in [[sodemytopic Parkinson's]].
