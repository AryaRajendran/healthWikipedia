'''C-reactive protein''' ('''CRP''') is a [[protein]] found in the blood, the levels of which rise in response to [[inflammation]] (i.e. C-reactive protein is an [[acute-phase protein]]). Its physiological role is to bind to [[phosphocholine]] expressed on the surface of dead or dying cells (and some types of bacteria) in order to activate the [[complement system]] via the [[C1Q complex]].<ref name="pmid10368284">{{cite journal | author = Thompson D, Pepys MB, Wood SP | title = The physiological structure of human C-reactive protein and its complex with phosphocholine | journal = Structure | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–77 | year = 1999 | month = February | pmid = 10368284 | doi = 10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80023-9 }}</ref>

==History and nomenclature==
CRP was so named because it was first identified as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the [[C-polysaccharide]] of [[Pneumococcus]].  

Discovered by [[William S. Tillett|Tillett]] and Francis in 1930,<ref name="pmid19869788">{{cite journal | author = Tillett WS, Francis T | title =Serological reactions in pneumonia with a nonprotein somatic fraction of pneumococcus | journal = J.

==Genetics and biochemistry==
The ''CRP'' gene is located on the first [[chromosome]] (1q21-q23). CRP is a 224-residue protein<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?db=protein&val=30224 NCBI Entrez Protein #CAA39671]</ref> with a monomer molecular mass of 25106 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]. The protein is an annular pentameric disc in shape and a member of the small [[pentraxins]] family.

==Function==

The acute phase response develops in a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions like bacterial, viral, or fungal infections; rheumatic and other inflammatory diseases; malignancy; and tissue injury or necrosis. These conditions cause release of interleukin-6 and other cytokines that trigger the synthesis of CRP and fibrinogen by the liver.  During the acute phase response, levels of CRP rapidly increase within 2 hours of acute insult, reaching a peak at 48 hours. With resolution of the acute phase response, CRP declines with a relatively short half-life of 18 hours. Measuring CRP level is a screen for infectious and inflammatory diseases.  Rapid, marked increases in CRP occur with inflammation, infection, trauma and tissue necrosis, malignancies, and autoimmune disorders. Because there are a large number of disparate conditions that can increase CRP production, an elevated CRP level does not diagnose a specific disease. An elevated CRP level can provide support for the presence of an inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica or [[giant-cell arteritis]].

The physiological role of CRP is to bind to phosphocholine expressed on the surface of dead or dying cells (and some types of bacteria) in order to activate the complement system. CRP binds to phosphocholine on microbes and damaged cells and enhances phagocytosis by macrophages. Thus, CRP participates in the clearance of necrotic and apoptotic cells.

CRP is a member of the class of acute-phase reactants, as its levels rise dramatically during [[inflammation|inflammatory]] processes occurring in the body. This increment is due to a rise in the plasma concentration of [[Interleukin-6|IL-6]], which is produced predominantly by [[macrophage]]s<ref name=Pepys/> as well as [[adipocyte]]s.<ref name="Lau"/> CRP binds to [[phosphocholine]] on microbes. It is thought to assist in [[Complement system|complement]] binding to foreign and damaged cells and enhances phagocytosis by macrophages ([[opsonin|opsonin mediated phagocytosis]]), which express a receptor for CRP. It is also believed to play another important role in [[innate immunity]], as an early defense system against infections. 

CRP rises up to 50,000-fold in acute inflammation, such as infection. It rises above normal limits within 6 hours, and peaks at 48 hours. Its half-life is constant, and therefore its level is mainly determined by the rate of production (and hence the severity of the precipitating cause).

[[Serum amyloid A]] is a related acute-phase marker that responds rapidly in similar circumstances.<ref name=Pepys/>

== Clinical significance ==

[[Scleroderma]], [[polymyositis]], and [[dermatomyositis]] often elicit little or no CRP response. CRP levels also tend not to be elevated in SLE unless serositis or synovitis is present. Elevations of CRP in the absence of clinically significant inflammation can occur in renal failure. CRP level is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Patients with high CRP concentrations are more likely to develop stroke, myocardial infarction, and severe peripheral vascular disease.<ref name="Risk">{{cite journal | author = Clearfield MB | title = C-reactive protein: a new risk assessment tool for cardiovascular disease | journal =The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association | volume = 105 | issue = 9 | pages = 409–16 | year = 2005 | month = September | pmid = 16239491 | url = http://www.jaoa.org/content/105/9/409.full }}</ref>

=== Role in cancer ===

==Diagnostic use==
CRP is used mainly as a marker of inflammation. Apart from [[liver failure]], there are few known factors that interfere with CRP production.<ref name=Pepys/>

Measuring and charting CRP values can prove useful in determining disease progress or the effectiveness of treatments. [[Blood]], usually collected in a [[serum-separating tube]], is analysed in a [[medical laboratory]] or at the point of care. Various analytical methods are available for CRP determination, such as [[ELISA]], [[immunoturbidimetry]], rapid [[immunodiffusion]], and visual [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]].

</div>

A high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) test measures low levels of CRP using laser [[nephelometry]]. The test gives results in 25 minutes with a sensitivity down to 0.04&nbsp;mg/L.

Normal concentration in healthy human serum is usually lower than 10&nbsp;mg/L, slightly increasing with [[aging]]. Higher levels are found in late [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] women, mild [[inflammation]] and [[viral infection]]s (10–40&nbsp;mg/L), active inflammation, bacterial infection (40–200&nbsp;mg/L), severe [[bacterial infections]] and [[burn]]s (>200&nbsp;mg/L).<ref name="pmid10595891">{{cite journal | author = Clyne B, Olshaker JS | title = The C-reactive protein | journal = J Emerg Med | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 1019–25 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10595891 | doi = 10.1016/S0736-4679(99)00135-3 }}</ref>

CRP is a more sensitive and accurate reflection of the acute phase response than the ESR ([[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate]]). The half-life of CRP is constant. Therefore, CRP level is mainly determined by the rate of production (and hence the severity of the precipitating cause). In the first 24 h, ESR may be normal and CRP elevated. CRP returns to normal more quickly than ESR in response to therapy.

=== Cardiology diagnostic test ===
Arterial damage results from [[macrophage|white blood cell]] invasion and [[inflammation]] within the wall. CRP is a general marker for inflammation and infection, so it can be used as a very rough proxy for heart disease risk.
