'''Alternative medicine''' is any of a wide range of [[health care]] practices, products and therapies, using methods of [[medical diagnosis]] and treatments  which, at least up to the end of the twentieth century, were typically not included in the degree courses of established [[medical schools]] teaching western medicine, including surgery, in the tradition of the [[Flexner Report]] or similar.<ref>[[Peking Union Medical College]] is an instance of the influence of the Flexner Report outside N.

=== Regional definitions ===

The Danish Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicine an independent institution under the Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health (Danish abbreviation: ViFAB) uses the term “alternative medicine” for:
* Treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals, where authorized healthcare professionals are those practicing what is proven by science.
* Treatments performed by authorized healthcare professionals, but those based on methods otherwise used mainly outside the healthcare system, which is based on science in Denmark. People without a healthcare authorisation must be able to perform the treatments.

====Institutions====
In ''General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of [[Traditional Medicine]]'', published in 2000 by the World Health Organization, complementary and alternative medicine were there defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system.<ref name="WHO"/><ref>''General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine''

Among putative medical practices available at the time which later became known as "alternative medicine" were homeopathy (founded in Germany in the early 19c.) and chiropractic (founded in North America in the late 19c.). These conflicted in principle with the developments in medical science upon which the Flexner reforms were based, and they have not become compatible with further advances of medical science such as listed in [[Timeline of medicine and medical technology]], 1900-1999 and 2000–present, nor have Ayurveda, acupuncture or other kinds of alternative medicine.

At the same time "[[Tropical medicine]]" was being developed as a specialist branch of western medicine in research establishments such as [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] founded 1898, [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], founded 1899 and [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine]], founded 1912. A distinction was being made between western scientific medicine and indigenous systems. An example is given by an official report about indigenous systems of medicine in India, including Ayurveda, submitted by [[Mohammad Usman of Madras]] and others in 1923. This stated that the first question the Committee considered was "to decide whether the indigenous systems of medicine were scientific or not".<ref>''The report of the Committee on the Indigenous systems of medicine, Madras'' (also known as the ''Usman Report'').Gram Vichar, ''What is the role of indigenous medical sciences in our health care system?''

By the later twentieth century the term 'alternative medicine' had come into use for the purposes of public discussion,{{refn|group=n|According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the earliest recorded English language usage in a print medium of the term "alternative medicine" is found in a 1974 text by Helen Kruger.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=alternative|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=OED Online|date=December 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/5803?redirectedFrom=Alternative+medicine|accessdate=20 February 2013}} {{cite book|year=1974|first=Helen|last=Kruger|title=Other healers, other cures: a guide to alternative medicine|url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=S5_8AAAACAAJ&dq|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|isbn=9780672517082}} See also: {{cite book|last=British Medical Association|title=Complementary Medicine, New Approach to Good Practice|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1993|url=http://books.google.ie/books/about/Complementary_medicine.html?id=rTFrAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780192861665}} {{cite book|last1=Cant|first1=Sarah|last2=Sharma|first2=Ursula|chapter=Alternative health practices and systems|pages=433–|editor1-last=Albrecht|editor1-first=Gary L|editor2-last=Fitzpatrick|editor2-first=Ray|editor3-last=Scrimshaw|editor3-first=Susan C.|title=The Handbook of Social Studies in Health and Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LyK1e6U7fU0C&pg=PA433|date=22 October 1999|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-84787-096-4}} {{harvnb|Saks|2003|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=zW2_iJsZFS0C&pg=PA117 117]}}</ref>}} but it was not always being used with the same meaning by all parties.

In respect of alternative medicine [[History of alternative medicine#altmed since the 1970s|since the 1970s]] in North America, Great Britain and elsewhere, there has been a tendency for the terms ‘alternative’ and ‘complementary’ to be used interchangeably to describe a wide diversity of therapies that attempt to use the self-healing powers of the body by amplifying natural recuperative processes to restore health. By 1990, approximately 60 million Americans had used one or more complementary or alternative therapies to address health issues, according to a nationwide survey in the United States published in 1993 by David Eisenberg.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eisenberg DM |year=1993|title=Unconventional Medicine in the United States – Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of Use|journal= N Engl J Med|volume= 328|pages=246–252|doi=10.1056/NEJM199301283280406 | pmid=8418405 | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Kessler | first2 = Ronald C. | last3 = Foster | first3 = Cindy | last4 = Norlock | first4 = Frances E. | last5 = Calkins | first5 = David R. | last6 = Delbanco | first6 = Thomas L. | issue = 4 }}</ref> A study published in the November 11, 1998 issue of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] reported that 42% of Americans had used complementary and alternative therapies, up from 34% in 1990.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eisenberg DM |year=1998|title= Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990–1997: results of a follow-up national survey |journal=JAMA|volume= 280 |issue=18|pages=1569–75|pmid=9820257 |doi=10.1001/jama.280.18.1569 | author-separator = , | author2 = Davis RB | author3 = Ettner SL | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Appel | first4 = S | last5 = Wilkey | first5 = S | last6 = Van Rompay | first6 = M | last7 = Kessler | first7 = RC}}</ref> However, despite the growth in patient demand for complementary medicine, most of the early alternative/complementary medical centers failed.<ref name=bestpractices>Best Practices in Integrative Medicine: A Report from the Bravewell Clinical Network.

The clinician's diagnosis was equivalent to the scientist's hypothesis: both [[medical diagnosis]] and hypothesis needed to be submitted to the test of an experiment...

Alternative medicine practices and beliefs are diverse in their foundations and methodologies, and typically make use of preparations and dosages other than such as are included in the [[Pharmacopeia]] recognised by established medical schools.

==Examples and classes==
{{Further2|[[List of branches of alternative medicine]]}}
[[File:Botanica.jpg|thumb|right|A [[botánica]] of traditional Hispanic medicines]]

Alternative medicines include a wide range of treatments and practices. Some stem from nineteenth century North America, such as [[Chiropractic]] and [[Naturopathy]], some, mentioned by Jütte, originated in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Germany, such as [[homeopathy]] and [[hydropathy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1044149/pdf/medhist00018-0066.pdf |title=Robert Jütte, "Historiography of Nonconventional Medicine in Germany" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> some have originated in China or India.

The following examples include some of the more common methods in use. Most therapies can be considered as part of five broad classes; biological based approaches, energy therapies, alternative medical systems, muscle and joint manipulation and mind body therapies.

[[File:ColouredChakraswithDescriptions.jpg|thumb|right|In Japanese [[Reiki]], it is believed that supernatural energies flow from the palms of the healer into the patient near [[Chakras]], influencing disease.]]

Alternative medical systems are complete health systems with their own approaches to diagnosis and treatment that differ from the conventional biomedical approach to health. Some are cultural systems such as [[Ayurveda]] and [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], while others, such as [[Homeopathy]] and [[Naturopathy]] are relatively recent and were developed in the West.<ref name="NP"/>

Writing as a historian Matthew Ramsey has asked whether some counter-hegemonic medicines are better understood as manifestations of more general developments in the larger society, or as the product of a coherent alternative world view.<ref>Matthew Ramsey, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN ''Alternative medicine in modern France'' Cambridge Journals, Med Hist. 1999 July; 43(3): 286–322.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1044147/pdf/medhist00018-0010.pdf]</ref>

===Ayurvedic medicine===

[[Ayurvedic medicine]] is a traditional medicine of India and has strong links with [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. It is based on the belief that health is controlled by 3 "humours" with disease caused by an imbalance of these "humours". The basis of treatment has some similarities with "Western medicine". Remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials.<ref>The Roots of Ayurveda: Selections from Sanskrit Medical Writings, D. Wujastyk, p xviii, 2003, ISBN 0-14-044824-1</ref>  Safety concerns have been raised about Ayurveda, with two U.S. studies finding about 20 percent of Ayurvedic Indian-manufactured [[patent medicine]]s contained toxic levels of heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]]. Other concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities.<ref name="Saper2008">{{cite journal |last=Saper|first=R.

===Traditional Chinese medicine===

[[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] is based on a concept of "spirit" called [[qi]],<ref>{{cite book|last= Ho |first= Peng Yoke| year=2000|month=Oct |title= Li, Qi, and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China |publisher= Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-41445-0}}</ref> considerations of [[Chinese Astrology]] as in acupuncture,<ref name=CLHRAM>Celestial lancets: a history and rationale of acupuncture and moxa, Needham, J; Lu GD, 2002, Routledge, ISBN 0-7007-1458-8</ref> traditional use of herbs and other substances found in China, and a belief that a map of the body is contained on the tongue, which reflects changes in the body.<ref>Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine, G Cia, 1995, Eastland Press.

===Homeopathy===

	
Homeopathy is based on the belief that a disease can be cured by a very low dose of substance that creates similar symptoms in a healthy person. These ideas are known as 'like cures like' and the 'law of the minimum dose'<ref name="Hahnemann">{{cite book | title=The Homœopathic Medical Doctrine, or "Organon of the Healing Art" | publisher=W.F.

===Naturopathy===

Naturopathy is based on a belief in [[vitalism]], which posits that a special energy called vital energy or vital force guides bodily processes such as [[metabolism]], reproduction, growth, and adaptation.<ref>Sarris, J., and Wardle, J. 2010. Clinical naturopathy: an evidence-based guide to practice. Elsevier Australia. Chatswood, NSW.</ref> Naturopathy favors a [[holistic health|holistic]] approach with non-invasive treatment and, similar to conventional medicine, encourages minimal use of [[surgery]] and [[Medication|drugs]].

The term "naturopathy" is derived from Greek and Latin, and literally translates as "nature disease".<ref name=NCCAM>

===Energy therapies===
Energy therapies are designed to influence energy fields (biofields) that practitioners believe surround and enter the body. Some energy therapies involve the use of crystals, while others use magnets and electric fields. NCCAM (the US-based National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) has distinguished two types of [[energy medicine]]: one, "Veritable" involving scientifically observable [[energy]], including [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]] and [[light therapy]]; the other "Putative" which invoke physically undetectable or unverifiable energy.<ref>''Energy Medicine: An Overview'', National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine [http://markmaluga.com/files/Energy-Medicine-NCCAM.pdf]</ref>

====Biofields====
[[File:Acupuncture1-1.jpg|thumb|upright|In Chinese [[acupuncture]] it is believed that insertion of needles affects the flow of a energy influencing disease.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}]]
[[File:Chiropractic spinal adjustment.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chiropractic]] was developed in the US in the belief that manipulation of the spine affects a supernatural [[vitalism|vital energy]] that influences health and disease.]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Energy (spirituality)#Biofields|Biofield]] therapies are intended to influence energy fields that, it is purported, surround and penetrate the body.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> Writers such as [[Carl Sagan]] (1934-1996), a noted astrophysicist, advocate of skeptical thinking ([[Scientific skepticism]]) and the author of ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]: Science as a Candle in the Dark'' (1996), have described the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.<ref>Demon Haunted World, Carl Sagan</ref>

[[Acupuncture]] is a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In acupuncture, it is believed that a supernatural energy called [[qi]] flows through the universe and through the body, and helps propel the blood, blockage of which leads to disease.<ref name=CLHRAM/> It is believed that insertion of needles at various parts of the body determined by astrological calculations can restore balance to the blocked flows, and thereby cure disease.<ref name=CLHRAM/>

Chiropractic was developed in the belief that manipulating the spine affects the flow of a supernatural [[vital energy]] and thereby affects health and disease.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In the western version of Japanese [[Reiki]], the palms are placed on the patient near [[Chakras]], believed to be centers of supernatural energies, in a belief that the supernatural energies can transferred through the palms of the practitioner, to heal the patient.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====Electromagnetic fields====
[[Bioelectromagnetism|Bioelectromagnetic]]-based therapies use verifiable electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, alternating-current, or direct-current fields in an unconventional manner.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> [[Magnetic healing]] does not claim existence of supernatural energies, but asserts that magnets can be used to defy the laws of [[physics]] to influence health and disease.

===Mind body therapies===
Mind–body therapies attempt to use the mind to affect bodily symptoms and functions; examples include yoga, spirituality and relaxation.

[[Mind-body medicine]] takes a holistic approach to health that explores the interconnection between the mind, body and spirit. It works under the premise that the mind can affect "bodily functions and symptoms".<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> Mind body medicine includes healing claims made in [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]], [[meditation]], [[deep-breathing exercises]], [[guided imagery]], [[hypnotherapy]],<ref name="Ginandes">{{Cite web |url=http://hypnosishypnotherapy.info/b-hypnosis-and-healing/ |last1=Ginandes |first1=Carol |first2=Patricia |last2=Brooks |year=2003 |title=Hypnosis Heals |journal=American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis}}</ref> [[progressive relaxation]], [[qi gong]] and [[tai chi]].<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/>

Yoga, a method of traditional stretches, exercises and meditations in [[Hinduism]], may also be classified as an energy medicine insofar as its healing effects are believed to be due to a healing "life energy" that is absorbed into the body through the breath, and is thereby believed to treat a wide variety of illnesses and complaints.<ref name="Raub">{{Cite journal| first=J. A. |last=Raub |year=2002 |title=Psychophysiologic effects of Hatha Yoga on musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary function: A literature review |journal=''The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=797-812 |doi=10.1089/10755530260511810}}</ref>

[[File:Fallerjfa.JPG|thumb|upright|Christian priest [[Faith healer]] laying hands on sick girl in belief in divine healing.]]

Religion based healing practices, such as use of [[prayer]] and the laying of hands in [[Christian]] [[faith healing]], rely on belief in divine intervention for healing.

===Herbs, diet and vitamins===
Biological approaches include the use of herbal medicines, special diets or very high doses of vitamins.

Substance based practices use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, non-vitamin supplements and megavitamins, and minerals, and includes traditional herbal remedies with herbs specific to regions in which the cultural practices arose.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> "Herbal" remedies in this case, may include use of nonherbal toxic chemicals from nonbiological sources, such as use of the poison [[lead]] in Traditional Chinese Medicine.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Nonvitamin supplements include [[fish oil]], [[Omega-3 fatty acid]], [[glucosamine]], [[echinacea]], [[flaxseed oil]] or pills, and [[ginseng]], when used under a claim to have healing effects.<ref name=NIHNGS>{{cite web|title=According to a New Government Survey, 38 Percent of Adults and 12 Percent of Children Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine (Press Release)|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2008/121008.htm|work=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|publisher=US Department of Health & Human Services. National Institutes of Health|date=December 10, 2008}}</ref>

===Body manipulation===
Body-based therapies such as massage, chiropractic and [[osteopathy]] use movement and physical manipulation of joints and muscles.

Manipulative and body-based practices feature manipulation or movement of body parts, such as is done in [[chiropractic]] manipulation.

==Criticism==
CAM, and use of the term "alternative medicine", have been criticised. A US government agency, the [[National Science Foundation]], reporting on ''Public Attitudes and Public Understanding'' in ''Science and Engineering Indicators 2002'' defined the term "alternative medicine", as used in their report, as treatments that had not been proven effective using scientific methods.<ref name="National Science Foundation"/><ref name="nsf.gov"/>

Criticisms have come from individuals such as [[Wallace Sampson]] in an article in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, June 1995 (first published online Dec 2006).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sampson|first=Wallace|title=Antiscience trends in the rise of the "alternative medicine" movement|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=1 June 1995|volume=775|issue=1|pages=189–191|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1996.tb23138.x}} [[Wallace Sampson]]</ref> Sampson argued that proponents of alternative medicine often used terminology which was loose or ambiguous to create the appearance that a choice between "alternative" effective treatments existed when it did not, or that there was effectiveness or scientific validity when it did not exist, or to suggest that a dichotomy existed when it did not, or to suggest that consistency with science existed when it might not; that the term "'''alternative'''" was to suggest that a patient had a choice between effective treatments when there was not; that use of the word "'''conventional'''" or "'''mainstream'''" was to suggest that the difference between alternative medicine and science based medicine was the prevalence of use, rather than lack of a scientific basis of alternative medicine as compared to "conventional" or "mainstream" science based medicine;
that use of the term "'''complementary'''" was to suggest that purported supernatural energies of alternative medicine could add to or complement science based medicine; that use of the term "'''integrative'''" was to suggest that supernatural beliefs can be consistently integrated with science and the result has scientific validity. Sampson, [[Stanford University]] medical professor, former chairperson of the [[National Council Against Health Fraud]], advisor to the California Attorney General and numerous district attorneys on medical fraud, and editor of [[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]], has also written that CAM is the "propagation of the absurd", and argued that ''alternative'' and ''complementary'' have been substituted for ''quackery'', ''dubious'' and ''implausible''.<ref name=absurd/>

Other criticism has been that "''Integrative medicine''" ("integrated medicine") is used either to refer to a belief that medicine based on science can be "integrated" with practices that are not, or that a combination of alternative medical treatments with conventional science based treatments that have some scientific proof of efficacy, in which case it is identical with CAM;<ref name=BMJ_May/> that there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and that which has not;<ref name="Angell 1998" /> that ''"There really is no such thing as alternative medicine--only medicine that has been proven to work and medicine that has not."'' - Arnold Relman, editor in chief emeritus of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''.<ref>The New England Journal of Medicine, July 1995.</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}

Another critic, with reference to government funding studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream, [[Steven Novella]], a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine, wrote that it "is used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate." Another, Marcia Angell, argued that it was "a new name for snake oil."<ref name="HttpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpdyncontentarticleARhtml" /> Angell considered that critics felt that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]], and if a treatment had been rigorously tested and found safe and effective, science based medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered "alternative" to begin with.<ref name="Angell 1998" /> It was thus possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. Prominent supporters of this position include [[George D. Lundberg]], former editor of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA).<ref name=Fontanarosa>{{cite journal |author=Fontanarosa PB, Lundberg GD |title=Alternative medicine meets science |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=18 |pages=1618–9 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9820267 |doi= 10.1001/jama.280.18.1618|url=}}</ref>

In an article first published in ''CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians'', November/December 1999, ''Evaluating complementary and alternative therapies for cancer patients'', Barrie R. Cassileth mentioned that a 1997 letter to the US Senate Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which had deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in OAM-supported research, had been signed by four Nobel Laureates and other prominent scientists.

In March 2009 a ''Washington Post'' staff writer reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], quoting one of them, Steven Salzberg, a genome researcher and computational biologist at the University of Maryland, saying "One of our concerns is that NIH is funding pseudoscience."  They argued that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of [[physiology]] and [[disease]], and have shown little or no effect.<ref name=Brown>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602139.html?hpid=sec-health |title=Scientists Speak Out Against Federal Funds for Research on Alternative Medicine|work=Washingtonpost |date=March 17, 2009 | first=David | last=Brown | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>
[[Stephen Barrett]], founder and operator of [[Quackwatch]], has argued that practices labeled "alternative" should be reclassified as either genuine, experimental, or questionable. Here he defines genuine as being methods that have sound evidence for safety and effectiveness, experimental as being unproven but with a plausible rationale for effectiveness, and questionable as groundless without a scientifically plausible rationale.<ref name=Quackwatch/>

A group of prominent scientists argued before the federal government, USA, that plausibility of interventions such as diet, relaxation, yoga and botanical remedies, should not be used to support research on implausible interventions based on superstition and belief in the supernatural, and that the plausible methods can be studied just as well in other parts of NIH, where they should be made to compete on an equal footing with other research projects.<ref name=Brown/> The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|NCCAM]] budget has been criticized<ref name="HttpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpdyncontentarticleARhtml">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602139.html |title=Scientists Speak Out Against Federal Funds for Research on Alternative Medicine – |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> because, despite the duration and intensity of studies to measure the efficacy of alternative medicine, there had been no effective CAM treatments supported by scientific evidence as of 2002, according to the QuackWatch website.<ref name="HttpwwwquackwatchorgQuackeryRelatedTopicsnccamhtml">{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html |title=Why the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) Should Be Defunded |publisher=Quackwatch.org |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> Despite this, the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] budget has been on a sharp sustained rise to support complementary medicine.<ref name="HttpwwwquackwatchorgQuackeryRelatedTopicsnccamhtml" /> There have been negative results in almost all studies conducted over ten years at a cost of $2.5 billion by the NCCAM.<ref>http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/</ref>

Another critic has argued that academic proponents of [[integrative medicine]] sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments in order to achieve a placebo effect.{{refn|group=n|As a 2010 article in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' concluded: <blockquote>real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments.

[[Integrative medicine]] has been criticized in that its practitioners, trained in science based medicine, deliberately mislead patients by pretending [[placebo]]s are not.

An analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious American medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine (1965–1999) was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of CAM in three phases, and that in each phase there had been changes in the medical marketplace which influenced the type of response in the journals.<ref>

'''Complementary and alternative medicine''' (CAM) has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being.

===Regulation===
{{Further|Regulation of alternative medicine | Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}
Some professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as [[chiropractic|chiropractic medicine]], have achieved full regulation in North America  and other parts of the world <ref name=WHO-guidelines>{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization|year=2005|title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf|format=PDF|isbn= 92-4-159371-7|accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref>  and are are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine.  In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others  have no regulation at all. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country, and state to state.<ref name="WHO-guidelines"/>

Government bodies in the USA and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine. One of those is the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which mentions specifically [[homeopathic]] products, [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[Ayurvedic]] products.<ref name="fda.gov"/> A document which the FDA has issued for comment is headed ''Guidance for Industry: Complementary and Alternative Medicine Products and Their Regulation by the Food and Drug Administration'', last updated 04/06/2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074360.htm |title=CPG Sec. 400.400 Conditions Under Which Homeopathic Drugs May be Marketed |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> The document opens with three preliminary paragraphs which explain that ''in the document'':

: - "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) are being used to encompass a wide array of health care practices, products, and therapies which are distinct from those used in "conventional" or "allopathic" medicine.

: - some forms of CAM, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, have been practiced for centuries, and others, such as electrotherapy, are of more recent origin.

: - in a publication of The [[Institute of Medicine]] it has been stated that more than one-third of American adults reported using some form of CAM and that visits to CAM providers each year exceed those to primary care physicians (Institute of Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States, pages 34-35, 2005).

: - no mention (in the document) of a particular CAM therapy, practice or product should be taken as expressing FDA's support or endorsement of it or as an agency determination that a particular product is safe and effective.

As of 2005, the [[Cochrane Library]] had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.69% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.{{sfn|CAM Committee|2005|pp=135-136}}

Most alternative medical treatments are not [[patent]]able, which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy—also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.<ref name=Ernst2005>{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=The efficacy of herbal medicine--an overview |journal=Fundamental & Clinical Pharmacology |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=405–9 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16011726 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-8206.2005.00335.x}}</ref> Some have proposed adopting a [[prize]] system to reward medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Horrobin DF | year = 1986 | title = Glittering prizes for research support | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 324 | issue = 6094| page = 221 |bibcode=1986Natur.324..221H|doi=10.1038/324221a0}}</ref> However, public funding for research exists. Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the [[US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. NCCAM and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than $2.5 billion on such research since 1992; this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments.<ref name="$2.5 billion"/><ref name='nccam_$'>{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/about/budget/appropriations.htm |title=NCCAM Funding: Appropriations History |accessdate=2008-04-02 |date=2008-01-09 |publisher=[[NCCAM]] | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5hSlSj9d5 | archivedate = 2009-06-11| deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Atwood2003">{{cite news | first=Kimball C. | last=Atwood | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=The Ongoing Problem with the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine | date=2003-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ongoing_problem_with_the_national_center | work =Skeptical Inquirer | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-18 | language = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091116142044/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ongoing_problem_with_the_national_center| archivedate= 16 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the [[Helsinki Declaration]] states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.<ref>{{cite pmid|12356597}}</ref>

Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers has stated:

:Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many [[alternative cancer treatments]] have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. In this article, clinical trial data on a number of alternative cancer cures including Livingston-Wheeler, Di Bella Multitherapy, antineoplastons, vitamin C, hydrazine sulfate, [[Laetrile]], and psychotherapy are reviewed. The label "unproven" is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been "disproven."<ref name=Vickers/>

===Adequacy of regulation and CAM safety===
Many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial. Some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects, which can be fatal.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

One of the commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is the manner in which is regulated. There have been significant developments in how CAMs should be assessed prior to re-sale in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) in the last 2 years. Despite this, it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re-labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Colquhoun|first=Professor David|title=Regulation of Alternative Medicine ‐ why it doesn't work|journal=Scottish Universities Medical Journal|year=2012|month=October|volume=1 (EPub series)|issue=16|pages=1–9|url=http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/epub-article/016-sumj.epub.pdf|accessdate=25 November}}</ref>  There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection (from false claims, toxicity, and advertising) with freedom to choose remedies.

Advocates of CAM suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms, even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Connelly|first=P|title=The Ethics of Acupuncture|journal=Scottish Universities Medical Journal|year=2012|month=August|volume=1|issue=2|pages=165–169|url=http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/volume2/sumjv1i2p.165-169.pdf}}</ref> Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose (such as paracetamol).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Malcolm|first=Dr R|title=Small but Intriguing - The Unfolding Story of Homeopathic Medicine|journal=Scottish Universities Medical Journal|year=2012|month=October|volume=1 (EPub series)|issue=15|pages=1–7|url=http://sumj.dundee.ac.uk/data/uploads/epub-article/015-sumj.epub.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref>

====Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals====

Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite journal |author=Cassileth BR, Deng G |title=Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer |journal=The Oncologist |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=80–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14755017 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.9-1-80}}</ref> An anecdotal example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor Alastair MacLennan of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking "natural" potions to "build up her strength" before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.<ref name='BenHills'>{{cite web|url=http://benhills.com/articles/articles/MED06a.html |title=Fake healers. Why Australia's $1 billion-a-year alternative medicine industry is ineffective and out of control. |accessdate = 2008-03-06 |last=Hills |first=Ben |work=Medical Mayhem }}</ref>

To ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

:And lastly {{sic}} there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.|<ref name='ABC_Maclennan'>{{cite news | first=Norman | last=Swan | coauthors= | title=Alternative Medicine – Part Three | date=2000-10-02 | publisher=ABC Radio National | url =http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s195441.htm | work =The Health Report | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | language = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080306230537/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s195441.htm| archivedate= 6 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

====Potential side-effects====

Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative treatments, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the ''[[appeal to nature]]'' fallacy, i.e., "that which is natural cannot be harmful".

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is [[Homeopathy]]. Since 1938, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in "several significantly different ways from other drugs."<ref name=Stehlin>Isadora Stehlin. "[http://web.archive.org/web/20071012070120/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/096_home.html Homeopathy: Real Medicine or Empty Promises?]" – FDA Consumer magazine (December 1996)</ref> Homeopathic preparations, termed "remedies," are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but "their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength," and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.<ref name=Stehlin/>

====Treatment delay====

Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/354/7/731 |title=NEJM – Drug-Related Hepatotoxicity |doi=10.1056/NEJMra052270 |publisher=Content.nejm.org |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2009-12-16|last1=Navarro|first1=Victor J.|last2=Senior|first2=John R.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=7|pages=731–9|pmid=16481640}}</ref> For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, "unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments" and refers to this as "[[opportunity cost]]". Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes.<ref name='Lilienfeld_2002'>{{cite journal|title=Our Raison d'Être|journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice|year=2002|first=Scott O.|last=Lilienfeld|coauthors=|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|url=http://www.srmhp.org/0101/raison-detre.html|accessdate = 2008-01-28 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QcyAPtwV | archivedate = 2007-07-26| deadurl=no}}</ref>

HIDING THIS SECTION FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION
Secondary metabolites in thousands of plants are regularly tested by drug companies in search of new therapies. [[Atropa belladonna|Deadly nightshade]] contains atropine, a potent (and dangerous) substance useful in the treatment of a number of disorders, including as an antidote for nerve agents. Chemicals isolated from [[Foxglove]] are used in the treatment of epilepsy; [[Opiates]] derived from poppies are highly effective painkillers, and [[THC]], found in [[cannabis sativa]], is used to counter the effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy itself owes some of its constituent drugs to [[Chemotherapy#Plant alkaloids and terpenoids (L01C)|plant alkaloids]]. These name just a few of the most prominent classes of drugs derived from natural sources that have been adopted as treatments by alternative therapies.

In the US, many medical insurers and some hospitals integrate chiropractic and massage therapy as adjuncts to mainstream medical care.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====Unconventional cancer "cures"====

Perhaps because many forms of [[cancer]] are difficult or impossible to cure, there have always been many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]]. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as "unproven," suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown. However, many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective.
<ref name=Vickers>{{cite journal |last1=Vickers |first1=A. |title=Alternative Cancer Cures: 'Unproven' or 'Disproven'? |journal=CA |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=110–118 |year=2004 |pmid=15061600 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110/full }}</ref>

===Research funding===

Although the Dutch government funded CAM research between 1986 and 2003, it formally ended funding in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Renckens CN |title=A Dutch view of the ''science'' of CAM 1986--2003 |journal=Eval Health Prof |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=431–50 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19926606 |doi=10.1177/0163278709346815 |url=}}</ref>

==Appeal==

A study published in 1998<ref name="Astin">{{cite journal |author=Astin JA |title=Why patients use alternative medicine: results of a national study |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=19 |pages=1548–53 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9605899 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.19.1548}}</ref> indicates that a majority of alternative medicine use was in conjunction with standard medical treatments. Approximately 4.4 percent of those studied used alternative medicine as a replacement for conventional medicine.  The research found that those having used alternative medicine tended to have higher education or report poorer health status.  Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine was not a meaningful factor in the choice, but rather the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so largely because "they find these healthcare alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life." In particular, subjects reported a holistic orientation to health, a transformational experience that changed their worldview, identification with a number of groups committed to environmentalism, feminism, psychology, and/or spirituality and personal growth, or that they were suffering from a variety of common and minor ailments – notable ones being anxiety, back problems, and chronic pain.

Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among that minority using them ''in lieu'' of conventional medicine.  There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].<ref name=Beyerstein /> Related to this are vigorous [[advertising|marketing]]<ref name=Weber>{{cite journal |author=Weber DO |title=Complementary and alternative medicine. Considering the alternatives |journal=Physician Executive |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=6–14 |year=1998 |pmid=10351720}}</ref> of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.<ref name=Beyerstein>{{cite journal|author=Beyerstein BL|url=http://www.sram.org/0302/bias.html|title=Psychology and 'Alternative Medicine' Social and Judgmental Biases That Make Inert Treatments Seem to Work|journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|year=1999|volume=3|issue=2|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref><ref name=Beyerstein2>{{cite journal |author=Beyerstein BL |title=Alternative medicine and common errors of reasoning |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=230–7 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11242572 |doi=10.1097/00001888-200103000-00009}}</ref>

There is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.<ref name=Beyerstein2/> Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.<ref name=pmid15188733/> Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.<ref name=Weber/>

In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the [[placebo effect]], which is a well-established observation in medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van Deventer MO |title=Meta-placebo: do doctors have to lie about giving a fake treatment? |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=335–9 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18485613 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2008.03.040}}</ref>  Related to it are similar psychological effects such as the will to believe,<ref name=Beyerstein /> [[cognitive bias]]es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning,<ref name=Beyerstein /> and the ''[[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.<ref name=Beyerstein />

Patients can also be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Also, many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach.  In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.<ref name=Beyerstein/><ref name=Beyerstein2/>

Schofield et al., in a systematic review published in 2011, make ten recommendations which they think may increase the effectiveness of consultations in a conventional (here: oncology) setting, such as "Ask questions about CAM use at critical points in the illness trajectory"; "Respond to the person's emotional state"; and "Provide balanced, evidence-based advice". They suggest that this approach may address "... concerns surrounding CAM use [and] encourage informed decision-making about CAM and ultimately, improve outcomes for patients".<ref>{{cite pmid| 19783116}}</ref>

CAM's popularity may be related to other factors which [[Edzard Ernst]] mentions in an interview in ''[[The Independent]]'':

: Why is it so popular, then? Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. "People are told lies. There are 40 million websites and 39.9 million tell lies, sometimes outrageous lies. They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. "At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.<ref name="Con?">{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/features/complementary-therapies-the-big-con-813248.html |title=Complementary therapies: The big con? – The Independent |work= |accessdate= 2010-04-23| location=London | date=2008-04-22 |deadurl=yes| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100417080412/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/features/complementary-therapies-the-big-con-813248.html| archivedate= 17 April 2010}}</ref>

In a paper published in October 2010 entitled ''The public's enthusiasm for complementary and alternative medicine amounts to a critique of mainstream medicine'', Ernst describes these views in greater detail and concludes:

: [CAM] is popular. An analysis of the reasons why this is so points towards the therapeutic relationship as a key factor. Providers of CAM tend to build better therapeutic relationships than mainstream healthcare professionals. In turn, this implies that much of the popularity of CAM is a poignant criticism of the failure of mainstream healthcare. We should consider it seriously with a view of improving our service to patients.<ref>{{cite pmid|  20846193}}</ref>

Physicians who practice complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available complementary therapies. Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sobel DS |title=The cost-effectiveness of mind-body medicine interventions |journal=Progress in Brain Research |volume=122 |issue= |pages=393–412 |year=2000 |pmid=10737073 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(08)62153-6 |series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=978-0-444-50049-6}}</ref> Some mind-body techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, were once considered complementary medicine, but are now a part of conventional medicine in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/tc/complementary-medicine-mind-body-interventions |title=Complementary Medicine – Mind-Body Interventions |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref>
