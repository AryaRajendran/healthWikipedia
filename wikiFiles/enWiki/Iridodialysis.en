==Symptoms and signs==
Those with small iridodialyses may be [[asymptomatic]] and require no treatment, but those with larger dialyses may have [[corectopia]] or [[polycoria]] and experience [[diplopia#Monocular|monocular diplopia]], [[Glare (vision)|glare]], or [[photophobia]].<ref name="Rappon">Rappon JM.

==Treatment and management==
Iridodialysis causing an associated hyphema has to be carefully managed, and recurrent bleeds should be prevented by strict avoidance of all sporting activities. Management typically involves observation and [[bed rest]]. Red blood cells may decrease the outflow of aqueous humor, therefore the eye should be kept soft by giving oral [[acetazolamide]]. Accidental trauma during sleep should be prevented by patching with an eye shield during night time. Avoid giving aspirin, heparin/warfarin and observe daily for resolution or progression. A large hyphema may require careful anterior chamber washout. Rebleeds may require additional intervention and therapy. 

Later, surgical repair may be considered for larger avulsions causing significant double vision, cosmesis or glare symptoms.<ref name="DRO2"/> Surgical repair is usually done by 10-0 prolene suture taking the base of iris avulsion and suturing it to the [[scleral spur]] and ciliary body junction.

==Complications==
Those with traumatic iridodialyses (particularly by [[eye trauma|blunt trauma]]) are at high risk for angle recession, which may cause [[glaucoma]].<ref name="Rappon"/> This is typically seen about 100 days or three months after the injury, and is thereby called "100 day Glaucoma". Medical or surgical treatment to control the IOP may be required if glaucoma is present.<ref name="DRO1"/> Soft opaque [[contact lens]]es may be used to improve [[cosmesis]] and reduce the perception of double vision.<ref name="DRO1"/><ref name="Rappon"/>
