In [[cardiology]], '''Ventricular dyssynchrony''' is a difference in the timing, or lack of synchrony, of contractions in different [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s in the [[heart]]. Large differences in timing of contractions can reduce cardiac efficiency and is correlated with [[heart failure]]. <ref name=Nagueh>{{cite journal|last=Nagueh, MD|first=Sherif F.|title=Mechanical Dyssynchrony in Congestive Heart Failure|journal=J Am Coll Cardiol.|year=2008|volume=51|issue=1|pages=18-22|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.08.052|url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1186968|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=Ghio>{{cite journal|last=Ghio|first=Stefano|coauthors=Cristina Constantin, Catherine Klersy, Alessandra Serio, Alessandra Fontana, Carlo Campana, Luigi Tavazzi|title=Interventricular and intraventricular dyssynchrony are common in heart failure patients, regardless of QRS duration|journal=European Heart Journal|year=2004|volume=25|pages=571-578|url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/7/571.full.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=Medscape>{{cite web|title=Review - The Pathology of Ventricular Dyssynchrony and the Role of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/493887|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>

==Types of dyssynchrony==

Three types of dyssynchrony can occur. '''Atrioventricular (AV) dyssynchrony''' occurs when there is a difference in timing between [[atrial]] and [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] contractions. '''Interventricular dyssynchrony''' occurs when there is a difference in timing between [[right ventricular]] (RV) and [[left ventricular]] (LV) contractions. '''Intraventricular dyssynchrony''' occurs when the timing in a sequence of activations and contractions of segments of the LV wall becomes abnormal.<ref name=Medscape /> In all three types, changes in timing lead to changes in the dynamic behavior of the tissues, leading to ''mechanical dyssynchrony''.<ref name=Ghio /> It is important to distinguish ventricular dyssynchrony from ventricular ''dyssynergy''. Dyssynergy refers to changes in relative strength of contractions, whereas dyssynchrony is a change in relative timing of contractions.<ref name=Nagueh />

==Diagnosis==

[[Echocardiography]] and tissue [[Doppler imaging]] (TDI) are both needed to fully diagnose the different types of ventricular dyssynchrony.<ref name=Ghio />  

==Treatment==
Recent studies suggest that [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]] can reduce the incidence of ventricular dyssynchrony and thus increase cardiac efficiency. <ref name=Nagueh /><ref name=Medscape />
