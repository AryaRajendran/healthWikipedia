'''Schizoid personality disorder''' ('''SPD''') is a [[personality disorder]] characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships, a tendency towards a solitary lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional coldness and [[apathy]]. Affected individuals may simultaneously demonstrate a rich, elaborate and exclusively internal [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy world]],<ref>Authur S. Reber- Dictionary of Psychology, Penguin p.690 (1995)</ref> although this is often more suggestive of [[schizotypal personality disorder]].

SPD is not the same as [[schizophrenia]], although they share such similar characteristics as [[Emotional detachment|detachment]] or [[blunted affect]]. There is, however, increased prevalence of the disorder in families with schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pchtreatment.com/schizoid-personality-disorder-clinic.php|title=Schizoid Personality Disorder|last=Ball|first=Jeff|publisher=Psychological Care & Healing Treatment Center|accessdate=2010-12-18}}</ref>

==History==

The term "schizoid" was coined in 1908 by [[Eugen Bleuler]] to designate a human tendency to direct attention toward one's inner life and away from the external world, a concept akin to [[introversion]] in that it was not viewed in terms of psychopathology. Bleuler labeled the [[exaggeration]] of this tendency the “schizoid personality.”<ref>Details recorded by Salman Akhtar in Schizoid Personality Disorder: A Synthesis of Developmental, Dynamic, and Descriptive Features. American Journal of Psychotherapy, 41, 499-518</ref>

Studies on the schizoid personality have developed along two distinct paths. The ''"[[descriptive psychiatry]]" tradition'' focuses on overtly observable, behavioral and describable symptoms and finds its clearest exposition in the [[DSM-IV#The current DSM|DSM-IV revised]]. The ''[[dynamic psychiatry]] tradition'' includes the exploration of covert or unconscious motivations and [[character structure]] as elaborated by classic psychoanalysis and object-relations theory.

The descriptive tradition began in [[Ernst Kretschmer|Ernst Kretschmer's]] 1925<ref name=EK>Ernst Kretschmer- ''Physique and Character''. London: Kegan, Paul, Trench & Trubner</ref> description of observable schizoid behaviors, which he organized into three groups of characteristics:
# unsociability, quietness, reservedness, seriousness, [[wikt:eccentricity|eccentricity]]
# [[wikt:timidity|timidity]], shyness with feelings, sensitivity, nervousness, excitability
# [[wikt:pliability|pliability]], honesty, indifference, silence, cold emotional attitudes.<ref name=EK />

These characteristics were the precursors of the DSM-IV division of schizoid character into three distinct personality disorders, though Kretschmer himself did not conceive of separating these behaviors to the point of radical isolation but considered them to be simultaneously present as varying potentials in schizoid individuals. For Kretschmer, the majority of schizoids are not ''either'' oversensitive ''or'' cold, but they are oversensitive and cold "at the same time" in quite different relative proportions, with a tendency to move along these dimensions from one behavior to the other.<ref name=EK />

The second path, that of dynamic psychiatry, began in 1924 with observations by [[Eugen Bleuler]],<ref>Eugen Bleuler- ''Textbook of Psychiatry'', New York: Macmillon (1924)</ref> who observed that the schizoid person and schizoid [[wikt:pathology|pathology]] were not things to be set apart.<ref>Conclusion of Bleuler's observations by Ralph Klein p.5 in Disorders of The Self: New Therapeutic Horizons: Brunner/Mazel (1995)</ref> [[Ronald Fairbairn|W. R. D. Fairbairn]]'s seminal work on the schizoid [[personality]], from which most of what is known today about schizoid phenomena is derived, was presented in 1940. Here Fairbairn delineated four central schizoid themes: (1) the need to regulate [[interpersonal distance]] as a central focus of concern, (2) the ability to mobilize [[Self-preservation|self preservative defenses]] and self-reliance, (3) a pervasive tension between the anxiety-laden need for attachment and the defensive need for distance that manifests in observable behavior as ''indifference'', and (4) an overvaluation of the inner world at the expense of the outer world.<ref>Recounted by Ralph Klein- Disorders of the Self: New Therapeutic Horizons, Brunner/Mazel p. 9 (1995)</ref> Following Fairbairn, the dynamic psychiatry tradition has continued to produce rich explorations on the schizoid character, most notably from writers Nannarello (1953), [[R. D. Laing|Laing]] (1960), [[Winnicott]] (1965), [[Guntrip]] (1969), [[Masud Khan|Khan]] (1974), [[Salman Akhtar|Akhtar]] (1987), Seinfeld (1991), Manfield (1992) and Klein (1995).<ref>J. J.

Psychologist Nancy McWilliams argues that the definition of SPD is flawed due to [[cultural bias]]: "One reason schizoid people are [[medicalization|pathologized]] is because they are comparatively rare. People in majorities tend to assume that their own psychology is [[normative]] and to equate difference with inferiority."<ref>Psychoanalytic Diagnosis, Second Edition: Understanding Personality Structure in the Clinical Process (Nancy McWilliams): [http://books.google.com/books?id=BzPOAWB2DncC&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=Schizoid+pathologizing&source=bl&ots=Sk0PXXdVjv&sig=8jCJ1gOEfpUzEtVD8jXTdUebkUk&hl=en&ei=GEuYTsyNIsz3sgay4IydBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Schizoid%20pathologizing&f=false]</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
People with SPD are often [[wikt:aloof|aloof]], cold and indifferent, which causes interpersonal difficulty. Most individuals diagnosed with SPD have trouble establishing personal relationships or expressing their feelings in a meaningful way. They may remain [[wikt:passive|passive]] in the face of unfavorable situations. Their communication with other people may be indifferent and concise at times. Because of their lack of meaningful communication with other people, those who are diagnosed with SPD are not able to develop accurate images of how well they get along with others.<ref name="D. Laing- p.82-100">R. D. Laing- 'The Divided Self' chapter-5 'The Inner Self of the Schizoid Condition' p.82-100</ref>

Such images are believed to be important for a person's self-awareness and ability to assess the impact of their own actions in social situations. R.D. Laing suggests that when one is not enriched by injections of interpersonal reality, the self-image becomes increasingly empty and [[wikt:volatilize|volatilized]], which leads the individual to feel unreal.<ref name="D. Laing- p.82-100"/>

People with SPD "feel lost" without the people they are normally around, because they require a sense of security and stability.<ref>{{cite book | author = Gunderson, John G., Zanarini, Mary C., Kisiel, Cassandra L. | editor = Livesley, W. John (ed.) | title = The DSM-IV Personality Disorders | year = 1995 | publisher = The Guilford Press | location = New York | chapter = Borderline Personality Disorder }}</ref> When the individual's personal space is violated, they feel suffocated and feel the need to free themselves and be independent. People who have SPD tend to be happiest when they are in a relationship in which the partner places few emotional or [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|intimate]] demands on them. It is not people as such that they want to avoid, but emotions both negative and positive, [[emotional intimacy]], and [[Self-disclosure|self disclosure]].<ref>Philip Manfield- 'Split Self, Split Object' p. 207</ref>

This means that it is possible for schizoid individuals to form relationships with others based on intellectual, physical, familial, occupational, or recreational activities as long as these modes of relating do not require or force the need for emotional intimacy, which the affected individual will reject. [[Donald Winnicott]] explains this need to modulate emotional interaction by saying that schizoid individuals "prefer to make relationships on their own terms and not in terms of the impulses of other people." Failing to attain that, they prefer isolation.<ref>D.W. Winnicott- p.73 'The Family and Individual Development' (1965)</ref>

=== The 'Secret schizoid' === 
Many fundamentally schizoid individuals present with an engaging, interactive personality style that contradicts the observable characteristic emphasized by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 definitions of the schizoid personality.<ref name=Klein>{{cite book|title=Disorders of the Self: Secret Pure Schizoid Cluster Disorder|year=1995|pages=25–27|author=Masterson, James F.|coauthors=Klein, Ralph|quote=Klein was Clinical Director of the Masterson Institute and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York|authorlink=James F. Masterson}}</ref> Klein classifies these individuals as "secret schizoids"<ref name=Klein /> who present themselves as socially available, interested, engaged and involved in interacting yet remain emotionally withdrawn and [[wikt:sequestered|sequestered]] within the safety of the internal world.

Withdrawal or [[wikt:detachment|detachment]] from the outer world is a characteristic feature of schizoid (alleged) pathology, but may appear either in "classic" or in "secret" form. When classic, it matches the typical description of the schizoid personality offered in the DSM-IV. It is however "just as often" a hidden internal state in which that what meets the objective eye may not match the subjective, internal world of the patient. Klein therefore cautions that one should not miss identifying the schizoid patient because one cannot see the patient's withdrawal through the patient's defensive, [[wikt:compensatory|compensatory]] interaction with external reality. He suggests that one need only ask the patient what his or her subjective experience is in order to detect the presence of the schizoid refusal of emotional intimacy.<ref name=Klein />

Descriptions of the schizoid personality as "hidden" behind an outward appearance of emotional engagement have been recognized as far back as 1940 with Fairbairn's description of "schizoid exhibitionism," in which the schizoid individual is able to express a great deal of feeling and to make what appear to be impressive social contacts yet in reality gives nothing and loses nothing. Because he is only "playing a part," his own personality is not involved. According to Fairbairn, "the person'' disowns the part which he is playing and thus the schizoid individual seeks to preserve his own personality intact and immune from compromise."<ref>W. R. D. Fairbairn- 'Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality'. pp 16-17</ref>

Further references to the secret schizoid come from [[Masud Khan]],<ref>Masud Khan- 'The Role of phobic and counterphobic mechanisms and separation anxiety in schizoid character formation' in the volume 'The Privacy of the Self'. Here Khan remarks "...in the course of the treatment it became gradually clear that behind a façade of excessive sociability and [[wikt:venturesome|venturesomeness]] as well as random and frequent sexual episodes these patients had lived all their life... in a secretive and adamantly rejective state of withdrawal from all objects as well as from their environment." p. 70.</ref> Jeffrey Seinfeld<ref>J. Seinfeld- 'The Empty Core'. Seinfeld writes: "The schizoid may also seem to be sociable and involved in relationships. However, he is frequently playing a role and not ‘fully’ involved, unconsciously disowning this role..."</ref> and Philip Manfield,<ref>Philip Manfield- 'Split Self, Split Object'. Manfield writes: "Not all schizoids keep away from people. It is not people that schizoids avoid, but emotional intimacy, self disclosure, and emotions both positive and negative." p.207</ref> who gives a [[wikt:palpable|palpable]] description of an SPD individual who actually "enjoys" regular public speaking engagements but experiences great difficulty in the breaks when audience members would attempt to engage him emotionally.<ref>Philip Manfield- 'Split Self, Split Object'. p. 207</ref> These references expose the problems involved in relying singularly on outer observable behavior for assessing the presence of personality disorders in certain individuals.

=== Avoidant attachment style ===
The question of whether SPD qualifies as a full personality disorder or simply as an [[Attachment in adults#Dismissive–avoidant attachment|avoidant attachment style]] is contentious.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} If what has been known as schizoid personality disorder is no more than an attachment style requiring more distant emotional proximity, then many of the more problematic reactions these individuals show in interpersonal situations may be partly accounted for by the social judgments commonly imposed on those with this style. Several sources to date have confirmed the synonymy of SPD and avoidant attachment style,<ref>M. L. West & A. E. Sheldon-Keller- 'Patterns of Relating' p. 111-113.</ref> which leaves open the question of how researchers might best approach this subject in future diagnostic manuals and therapeutic practice. However, individuals with SPD characteristically do not seek social interactions merely due to lack of interest, while those of the avoidant personality type crave interactions but fear rejection.

=== Schizoid sexuality ===
People with SPD are sometimes sexually apathetic, though they do not typically suffer from [[anorgasmia]]. Many schizoids have a healthy sex drive but some prefer to masturbate rather than deal with the social aspects of finding a sexual partner. Their preference to remain alone and detached may cause their need for sex to appear to be less than that of those who do not have SPD. Sex often causes individuals with SPD to feel that their personal space is being violated, and they commonly feel that [[masturbation]] or [[sexual abstinence]] is preferable to the emotional closeness they must tolerate when having sex.<ref>Nannarello, J., Schizoid. Journal of Nervous Mental Diseases 1953</ref><ref>'Schizoid Phenomena, Object Relations, and the Self'</ref> Significantly broadening this picture are notable exceptions of SPD individuals who engage in occasional or even frequent sexual activities with others.<ref>Nannarello, J., Schizoid. Journal of Nervous Mental Diseases 1953 p.240-242</ref>

Harry Guntrip<ref>'Schizoid Phenomena, Object Relations, and the Self' p.303</ref> describes the "secret sexual affair" entered into by some married schizoid individuals as an attempt to reduce the quantity of emotional intimacy focused within a single relationship, a sentiment echoed by [[Karen Horney|Karen Horney's]] "resigned personality" who may exclude sex as "too intimate for a permanent relationship, and instead satisfy his sexual needs with a stranger. Conversely he may more or less restrict a relationship to merely sexual contacts and not share other experiences with the partner."<ref>K. Horney- 'Neurosis and Human Growth' chapter 'Resignation: The appeal of freedom' p. 264-265</ref> Jeffrey Seinfeld, professor of social work at New York University, has  published a volume on SPD<ref>J. Seinfeld- The Empty Core: An Object Relations Approach to Psychotherapy of the Schizoid Personality' p. 104</ref> that details examples of "schizoid hunger" which may manifest as [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]]. Seinfeld provides an example of a schizoid woman who would covertly attend various bars to meet men for the purposes of gaining impersonal sexual gratification, an act which alleviated her feelings of hunger and emptiness.

Salman Akhtar describes this dynamic interplay of overt versus covert sexuality and motivations of some SPD individuals with greater accuracy. Rather than following the narrow proposition that schizoid individuals are either sexual or [[Asexuality|asexual]], Akhtar suggests that these forces may ''both'' be present in an individual despite their rather contradictory aims.<ref name=Akhtar>Akhtar, S. Schizoid Personality Disorder: A Synthesis of Developmental, Dynamic, and Descriptive Features. American Journal of Psychotherapy, 151:499–518, 1987.</ref> A clinically accurate picture of schizoid sexuality must therefore include the overt signs: "asexual, sometimes [[Celibacy|celibate]]; free of romantic interests; averse to sexual gossip and [[innuendo]]," as well as possible ''covert'' manifestations of "secret voyeuristic and pornographic interests; vulnerable to [[erotomania]]; tendency towards [[Masturbation#Compulsive masturbation|compulsive masturbation]] and [[Perversion#Sexual usages|perversions]],"<ref name=Akhtar /> although none of these necessarily apply to all people with SPD.

==Causes==
There is some evidence to suggest that there is an increased prevalence of schizoid personality disorder in relatives of people with [[schizophrenia]] or [[schizotypal personality disorder]]. To [[Sula Wolff]], who did extensive research and clinical work with children and teenagers with schizoid symptoms, "schizoid personality has a constitutional, probably genetic, basis."<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Wolff | first1 = Sula | authorlink1 = Sula Wolff | title = Loners - The Life Path of Unusual Children | publisher = Routledge - Taylor and Francis Group | pages = 35 | url = http://books.google.pt/books?id=ltbeu-XY6YgC | accessdate = 2012-07-21 | isbn = 978-0-415-06665--5}}</ref> Other researchers  had hypothesized that unloving, neglectful,<ref>{{cite web|author=&#8226; Personality Disorders &#8226; Nov 28, 2005 |url=http://www.health.am/psy/more/schizoid_personality_disorder |title=Schizoid Personality Disorder -Personality Disorders |publisher=Health.am |date=2005-11-28 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> or excessively [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]]<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Schizoid Child | journal = American Journal of Orthopsychiatry | date = April 1946 | coauthors = R.L.

==Diagnosis==

===DSM===
The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' fourth edition, a widely used  manual for diagnosing [[mental disorder]]s, categorizes schizoid personality disorder in Axis II, [[Cluster A]].<ref name="DSM-IV-TR">[http://behavenet.com/schizoid-personality-disorder Schizoid personality disorder], ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref> The criteria can be found on [http://behavenet.com/schizoid-personality-disorder behavenet].

===World Health Organization===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]] lists schizoid personality disorder as ''Schizoid personality disorder''.<ref name="schizoid">http://www.mentalhealth.com/icd/p22-pe02.html Schizoid personality disorder - [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] 10th Revision ([[ICD-10]])]</ref>

:It is characterized by at least four of the following criteria:

:# Emotional coldness, detachment or reduced [[Affect (psychology)|affect]].
:# Limited capacity to express either positive or negative emotions towards others.
:# Consistent preference for [[wikt:solitary|solitary]] activities.
:# Very few, if any, close friends or [[personal relationship|relationships]], and a lack of desire for such.
:# Indifference to either [[praise]] or [[criticism]].
:# Taking pleasure in few, if any, activities.
:# Indifference to social [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s and conventions.
:# Preoccupation with [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] and [[introspection]].
:# Lack of desire for [[Human sexuality|sexual]] experiences with another person.

It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of [[Personality disorder#Diagnosis|general personality disorder criteria]].

===Millon's subtypes===

[[Theodore Millon]] identified four subtypes of schizoid.<ref name="Millon">Millon, Theodore (2004). ''Personality Disorders in Modern Life'', p. 378. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey. ISBN 0-471-23734-5.</ref><ref name=millon9>{{cite web|url=http://millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm |title=Millon, Theodore - Personality Subtypes |publisher=Millon.net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> Any individual schizoid may exhibit none or one of the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Subtype
!Features
|-
| '''Languid schizoid''' (including [[depressive personality disorder|depressive]] features)
| Marked inertia; deficient activation level; intrinsically phlegmatic, lethargic, weary, leaden, lackadaisical, exhausted, enfeebled.<ref name="Millon"/>
|-
| '''Remote schizoid''' (including [[avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] features)
| Distant and removed; inaccessible, solitary, isolated, homeless, disconnected, secluded, aimlessly drifting; peripherally occupied.<ref name="Millon"/>
|-
| '''Depersonalized schizoid''' (including [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] features)
| Disengaged from others and self; self is disembodied or distant object; body and mind sundered, cleaved, dissociated, disjoined, eliminated.<ref name="Millon"/>
|-
| '''Affectless schizoid''' (including [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|compulsive]] features)
| Passionless, unresponsive, unaffectionate, chilly, uncaring, unstirred, spiritless, lackluster, unexcitable, unperturbed, cold; all emotions diminished.<ref name="Millon"/>
|}

=== Dynamic diagnostic criteria ===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
Ralph Klein's 1995 description of a schism in the object of relations of the schizoid gave new perspective on commonly held beliefs about the schizoid that focus mainly on the schizoid’s apparent disinterest in relationships. This split involves a "slave/master" relationship characterized by exploitation and dehumanization, and the "self in exile," in which the self recoils from the exploitative relationship. The distanced or unresponsive self in exile is the more commonly recognized aspect of the schizoid. As Klein states: "[the] seeming detachment from feelings should never be accepted as the real state of affairs."<ref name=Klein>p. 135</ref>

Of particular significance is the correlation between the [[narcissistic disorder]] and the schizoid. The "over-entitlement" of the narcissist in a family can result in the "under-entitlement" of the schizoid sibling. The disavowed shame of the narcissist is often absorbed by or projected onto the schizoid, which causes the experience of psychic invasion and the sense of vulnerability to intrusiveness. A schizoid may also be attracted to exploitative relationships in which they long to experience significance and recognition by serving a need of the other. This same person may yet be highly aware of any forms of corruption or exploitation outside of this relationship. In this approach diagnosis is based on the dynamic of this split and its consequences, as opposed to diagnosis on the basis of a list of external behaviors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Guntrip criteria===

Ralph Klein, Clinical Director of the Masterson Institute, delineates the following nine characteristics of the schizoid personality as described by [[Harry Guntrip]]: [[Extroversion and introversion|introversion]], withdrawnness, [[narcissism]], self-sufficiency, a sense of superiority, loss of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], loneliness, depersonalization, and [[Regression (psychology)|regression]].<ref name="RK">Ralph Klein- pp. 13–23 in Disorders of the Self: New Therapeutic Horizons, Brunner/Mazel (1995).</ref>

====Introversion====
Guntrip described the schizoid's inner world thus: "By the very meaning of the term, the schizoid is described as cut off from the world of outer reality in an emotional sense. All this [[libido|libidinal]] desire and striving is directed inward toward internal objects and he lives an intense inner life often revealed in an astonishing wealth and richness of [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] and imaginative life whenever that becomes accessible to observation. Though mostly his varied fantasy life is carried on in secret, hidden away."<ref name="Guntrip">Guntrip, Harry. Schizoid Phenomena, Object-Relations, and The Self. New York: International Universities Press, 1969.</ref> The schizoid person is so cut off from outer reality as to experience it as dangerous. It is a natural human response to turn away from sources of danger and toward sources of safety. The schizoid individual, therefore, is primarily concerned with avoiding danger and ensuring safety.<ref name="RK" />

====Withdrawnness====
Withdrawnness means detachment from the outer world, the other side of introversion. Only a small portion of schizoid individuals present with a clear and obvious timidity, reluctance, or avoidance of the external world and interpersonal relationships. Many fundamentally schizoid people [[human behavior|present]] with an engaging, interactive [[personality type|personality style]].

Such a person can appear to be available, interested, engaged and involved in interacting with others, but he or she may in reality be emotionally withdrawn and sequestered in a safe place in an internal world. Withdrawnness is a characteristic feature of schizoid [[psychopathology|pathology]], but it is sometimes overt and sometimes covert. Overt withdrawnness matches the usual description of the schizoid personality, but withdrawnness is just as often a covert, hidden, internal state of the patient.

The patient's observable behavior may not accurately reflect the internal state of their mind. One should not mistake introversion for indifference, and one should not miss identifying the schizoid patient due to misinterpretation of the patient's defensive, compensatory, engaging interaction with external reality.<ref name="RK" />

====Narcissism====
Guntrip defines [[narcissism]] as "a characteristic that arises out of the predominately interior life the schizoid lives. His love objects are all inside him and moreover he is greatly identified with them so that his libidinal attachments appear to be in himself. The question, however, is whether the intense inner life of the schizoid is due to a desire for hungry incorporation of external objects or due to withdrawal from the outer to a presumed safer inner world."<ref name="Guntrip"/> The need for [[Attachment (psychology)|attachment]] as a primary motivational force is as strong in the schizoid person as in any other human being. Because the schizoid's love objects are internal, he or she finds safety without connecting and attaching to objects in the real world.<ref name="RK" />

====Self-sufficiency====
Guntrip defined schizoid self-sufficiency as a symptom of narcissism, "a safeguard against [[anxiety]] breaking out in dealing with actual people."<ref name="Guntrip"/> The more that schizoids can rely on themselves, the less they have to rely on other people and expose themselves to the potential dangers and anxieties associated with that reliance or, even worse, dependence. The vast majority of schizoid individuals show an enormous capacity for self-sufficiency and the ability to operate alone, independently and autonomously, in managing their worlds.<ref name="RK" />

====Sense of superiority====
Guntrip observed that a sense of superiority accompanies self-sufficiency. "One has no need of other people, they can be dispensed with... There often goes with it a feeling of being different from other people."<ref name="Guntrip" /> The sense of superiority of the schizoid has nothing to do with the grandiose self of the narcissistic disorder. It does not find expression in the schizoid through the need to devalue or annihilate others who are perceived as offending, criticizing, shaming, or humiliating. This type of superiority was described by a young schizoid man:
:"If I am superior to others, if I am above others, then I do not need others. When I say that I am above others, it does not mean that I feel better than them, it means that I am at a distance from them, a safe distance."
It is a feeling of distance rather than of superiority.<ref name="RK" />

====Loss of affect====
{{Further|Affect (psychology)}}
Guntrip saw loss of affect as inevitable,<ref name="Guntrip"/> as the tremendous investment made in the self interferes with the desire and ability to be [[empathy|empathic]] and sensitive toward another person’s experience. These things often seem secondary to securing one's own defensive, safe position. The subjective experience is one of loss of affect.<ref name="RK" />

Some patients experience loss of affect to such a degree that the insensitivity becomes manifest in the extreme as [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], callousness, or even cruelty. The patient appears to have no awareness of how his or her comments or actions affect and hurt other people. This loss of affect is more frequently manifest within the patient as genuine confusion, a sense of something missing in his or her emotional life.<ref name="RK" />

====Loneliness====
Guntrip observed that the preceding characteristics result in loneliness: "Loneliness is an inescapable result of schizoid introversion and abolition of external [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. It reveals itself in the intense longing for friendship and love which repeatedly break through. Loneliness in the midst of a crowd is the experience of the schizoid cut off from affective rapport."<ref name="Guntrip" /> This is a central experience of the schizoid that is often lost to the observer. Contrary to the familiar [[caricature]] of the schizoid as uncaring and cold, the vast majority of schizoid persons who become patients express at some point in their treatment their longing for [[friendship]] and [[love]]. This is not the schizoid patient as described in the DSMs. Such longing, however, may not break through except in the schizoid’s fantasy life, to which the therapist may not be allowed access for quite a long period in treatment.

There is a very narrow range of classic DSM-defined schizoids for whom the hope of establishing relationships is so minimal as to be almost extinct. The longing for closeness and attachment is almost unidentifiable to such a person. These individuals will not voluntarily become patients, as the schizoid individual who becomes a patient does so often because of the twin motivations of loneliness and longing. This type of patient believes that some kind of connection and attachment is possible and is well suited to [[psychotherapy]]. The psychotherapist, however, may approach the schizoid patient with a sense of therapeutic [[pessimism]], if not [[nihilism]], and may misread the patient by believing that the patient’s wariness is indifference and that caution is coldness.<ref name="RK" />

====Depersonalization====
Guntrip describes [[depersonalization]] as a loss of a sense of [[Personal identity (philosophy)|identity]] and [[individual]]ity. Depersonalization is a dissociative defense, often described by the schizoid patient as  "tuning out," "turning off", or as the experience of a separation between the observing and the participating [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]. It is experienced most profoundly when anxieties seem overwhelming and is a more extreme form of loss of affect: whereas the loss of affect is a more chronic state in schizoid personality disorder, depersonalization is an acute defense against more immediate experiences of overwhelming anxiety or danger.<ref name="RK" />

====Regression====
{{Further|Regression (psychology)}}
Guntrip defined regression as "Representing the fact that the schizoid person at bottom feels overwhelmed by their external world and is in flight from it both inwards and as it were backwards to the safety of the [[metaphor]]ical womb."<ref name="Guntrip" /> Such a process of regression encompasses two different mechanisms: inward and backwards. Regression inward speaks to the magnitude of the reliance on primitive forms of fantasy and self-containment, often of an [[autoeroticism|autoerotic]] or even [[asexuality|objectless]] nature. Regression backwards to the safety of the womb is a unique schizoid phenomenon and represents the most intense form of schizoid defensive withdrawal in an effort to find safety and to avoid destruction by external reality. The fantasy of regression to the womb is the fantasy of regression to a place of ultimate safety.<ref name="RK" />

The description of the nine characteristics first articulated by Guntrip should bring more clearly into focus some of the major differences that exist between the traditional descriptive DSM portrait of the schizoid disorder and the traditional psychoanalytically informed object relations view. All nine characteristics are internally consistent. Most, if not all, should be present in order to diagnose a schizoid disorder.<ref name="RK" />

===Akhtar's phenomenological profile===
[[Salman Akhtar]], M.D.<ref name="Akhtar"/> provided a comprehensive phenomenological profile of Schizoid Personality Disorder in which classic and contemporary descriptive views are synthesized with psychoanalytic observations. This profile is summarized in the table reproduced below that lists clinical features that involve six areas of psychosocial functioning and are organized by [[wikt:overt|"overt"]] and [[wikt:covert|"covert"]] manifestations. Dr. Akhtar states that "these designations do not imply conscious or unconscious but denote seemingly contradictory aspects that are phenomenologically more or less easily discernible," and that "this manner of organizing symptomology emphasizes the centrality of splitting and identity confusion in schizoid personality."<ref name=Akhtar/>

One patient with SPD commented that he could not fully enjoy his life because he feels that he is living in a shell. He furthermore noted that his inability distressed his wife.<ref>{{cite book | last = Magnavita | first = Jeffrey J. | title = Restructuring Personality Disorders: A Short-Term Dynamic Approach | year = 1997 | publisher = The Guilford Press | location = New York | isbn = 1-57230-185-6 }}</ref> According to Beck and Freeman,<ref name="beckfreeman">{{cite book | author = Beck, Aaron T., M.D., Freeman, Arthur, Ed.D. | title = Cognitive Therapy of Personality Disorders | year = 1990 | publisher = The Guilford Press | location = New York }}</ref> "Patients with schizoid personality disorders consider themselves to be observers, rather than participants, in the world around them."

===[[Differential diagnosis]]===
SPD shares several aspects with other psychological conditions, but there are some important differentiating features:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! psychological condition
!Features
|-
| [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
| People who have SPD may also suffer from clinical depression, but this is not always the case. Unlike depressed people, persons with SPD generally do not consider themselves inferior to others, although they will probably recognize that they are different.
|-
| [[Avoidant personality disorder]]
| People affected with avoidant personality disorder avoid social interactions due to anxiety or feelings of incompetence, but those with SPD do so because they are genuinely indifferent to social relationships. A 1989 study,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Overholser | first = JC | year = 1989 | month = November | title = Differentiation between schizoid and avoidant personalities: an empirical test | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 785–90 | pmid = 2819642 }}</ref> however, found that "schizoid and avoidant personalities were found to display equivalent levels of anxiety, depression, and psychotic tendencies as compared to psychiatric control patients." One SPD patient remarked that previous knowledge, expectations, or assumptions may result in such elevated levels.{{why|date=November 2012}} Patients can mentally simulate damaging scenarios in order to flatten negative effects, should one occur.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}
|-
| [[Asperger syndrome]]
|Asperger syndrome (AS), sometimes called "schizoid disorder of childhood," is an [[autism-spectrum disorder]]. SPD does not involve impairments in [[nonverbal communication]] such as a [[Asperger syndrome#Social interaction|lack]] of [[eye contact]], [[Asperger syndrome#Speech and language|unusual]] [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or a pattern of [[Asperger syndrome#Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior|restricted interests or repetitive behaviors]]. Compared to AS, SPD is characterized by prominent [[conduct disorder]], better adult adjustment and a slightly increased risk of schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |year=2008 |title= Asperger syndrome |author= Woodbury-Smith MR, Volkmar FR |doi=10.1007/s00787-008-0701-0 |pmid=18563474 |volume= 18 |pages= 2–11 |issue= 1}}</ref>
|}

Some people with schizoid personality features may occasionally experience instances of [[brief reactive psychosis]] when under stress.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.pt/books?id=w_HajjMnjxwC&pg=PA695#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|year=2000|page=695|accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref> A pathological reliance on fantasizing activity is often part of the schizoid individual's withdrawal from the world. Fantasy thus becomes a core component of the self in exile,<ref name="autogenerated5">Klein, Ralph. Disorders of The Self: New Therapeutic Horizons. Brunner and Mazel, 1995 p. 64</ref> though fantasizing in schizoid individuals is far more complicated than a means of facilitating withdrawal.<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|64}}

Fantasy is also a relationship with the world and with others by proxy. It is a substitute relationship, but a relationship nonetheless, characterized by idealized, defensive and compensatory mechanisms. It is an expression of the self in exile because it is self-contained and free from the dangers and anxieties associated with emotional connection to real persons and situations.<ref name="autogenerated5" />

Klein explains it as "an expression of the self struggling to connect to objects, albeit internal objects. Fantasy permits schizoid patients to feel connected, and yet still free from the imprisonment in relationships. In short, in fantasy one can be attached (to internal objects) and still be free."<ref name="autogenerated5" /> This aspect of schizoid pathology has been generously elaborated in works by Laing,<ref> Laing, R.D. The Divided Self. Tavistock Publications, 1960. pp.82-100</ref> Winnicott,<ref>Winnicott, W.D. Playing and Reality. Routledge, 1971. pp. 26-38</ref> and Klein.<ref name="autogenerated5" />

Schizoid individuals frequently [[act out]] with substance and alcohol abuse and other addictions which serve as substitutes for human relationships.<ref name="core">J. Seinfeld- The Empty Core: An Object Relations Approach to Psychotherapy of the Schizoid Personality, Jason Aronson 1991, p. 101</ref> The substitute of a nonhuman for a human object serves as a schizoid defense. Providing examples of how the schizoid individual creates a personal relation with the drug, Seinfeld tells of an addict who called heroin his "soothing white pet," and of others who referred to crack as their "bad mama" or "boyfriend." He explains that "Not all addicts name their drug, but there often is the trace of a personal feeling about the relationship."<ref name="core" /> The object relations view emphasizes that the drug use and alcoholism reinforce the fantasy of union with an internal object, yet enable the addict to be indifferent to the external object world. Addiction is therefore a schizoid and symbiotic defense.

S. C. Ekleberry<ref name="Ekleberry">Sharon S. Ekleberry- [[Dual Diagnosis]] and the Schizoid Personality Disorder 2000</ref> suggests that [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] "may be the single most [[egosyntonic]] drug for individuals with SPD because it allows a detached state of fantasy and distance from others, provides a richer internal experience than these individuals can normally create, and reduces an internal sense of emptiness and failure to participate in life. Also, alcohol, readily available and safe to obtain, is another obvious drug of choice for these individuals. Some will use both marijuana and alcohol and see little point in giving up either. They are likely to use in isolation for the effect on internal processes."<ref name="Ekleberry" />

Suicide may also be a running theme for schizoid individuals, though they are not likely to actually attempt one. They might be down and depressed when all possible connections have been cut off, but as long as there is some relationship or even hope for one the risk will be low. The idea of [[suicide]] is a driving force against the person's schizoid defenses. As Klein says: "For some schizoid patients, its presence is like a faint, barely discernible background noise, and rarely reaches a level that breaks into consciousness. For others, it is an ominous presence, an emotional sword of [[Damocles]]. In any case, it is an underlying dread that they all experience."<ref>James F. Masterson & Ralph Klein pp. 54–55 in Disorders of the Self: New Therapeutic Horizonds, The Masterson Approach, Brunner/Mazel (1995).</ref>

==Treatment==
Schizoid personality disorder has negative symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia, such as [[anhedonia]], [[blunted affect]] and low energy, and [[atypical antipsychotics]] may have efficacy in alleviating them. Those who do seek treatment have the option of medication or therapy. The medication most recently used to treat the negative symptoms is [[risperidone]]. Before this, there was no psychotropic medication that made an impact on the negative symptoms.<ref name="Joseph, S., M.D., Ph.D., MPH 1997">{{cite book | author = Joseph, S., M.D., Ph.D., MPH | title = Personality Disorders: New Symptom-Focused Drug Therapy | year = 1997 | publisher = The Haworth Medical Press | location = New York }}</ref> Low doses of risperidone or [[olanzapine]] also work for the social deficits and blunted affect, [[Wellbutrin]] (bupropion) for anhedonia.<ref name="Joseph, S., M.D., Ph.D., MPH 1997"/>

The use of [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]], [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCAs]], [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]], low dose benzodiazepines and beta-blockers may help [[social anxiety]] in people with SPD. However, social anxiety may not be a main concern for the people who have SPD. Supportive psychotherapy is also used in an inpatient or outpatient setting by a trained professional that focuses on areas such as coping skills, improvement of social skills and social interactions, communication, and self-esteem issues. Mark Zimmerman suggested the following questions for evaluation of patients with SPD:
* Do you have close relationships with friends or family? If yes, with whom? If no, does this bother you?
* Do you wish you had close relationships with others?
* Some people prefer to spend time alone, others prefer to be with people. How would you describe yourself?
* Do you frequently choose to do things by yourself?
* Would it bother you to go a long time without a sexual relationship? Does your sex life seem important or could you get along as well without it?
* What kind of activities do you enjoy?
* Do you confide in anyone who is not in your immediate family?
* How do you react when someone criticizes you?
* How do you react when someone compliments you?

In the assessment process, note if these individuals make eye contact, smile or express affect nonverbally.<ref name="zimmerman">{{cite book | author = Zimmerman, Mark, M.D. | title = Interview Guide for Evaluating DSM-IV Psychiatric Disorders and the Mental Status Examination | year = 1994 | publisher = Psych Products Press | location = East Greenwich, RI | isbn = 0-9633821-3-6 }}</ref></blockquote>

People with SPD have a tendency to miss differences that causes an inability to pick up environmental cues and limits their experience.<ref name="beckfreeman"/> The perception of varied events only increases their fear for intimacy and limits them in their interpersonal relationships. Their aloofness may limit their opportunities to refine the social skills and behavior necessary to effectively pursue relationships.{{clarify|reason="miss" what differences? What environmental cues? How does this diffuse experience?|date=November 2012}}

Socialization groups may help these people with SPD. Educational strategies in which people who have SPD identify their positive and negative emotions also are effective. Such identification helps them to learn about their own emotions and the emotions they draw out from others and to feel the common emotions with other people with whom they relate. This can help people with SPD create empathy with the outside world.

===Shorter-term treatment===

The concept of "closer compromise" means that the schizoid patient may be encouraged to experience intermediate positions between the extremes of emotional closeness and permanent exile.<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|95-143}} A lack of injections of interpersonal reality causes an impoverishment in which the schizoid individual's self-image becomes increasingly empty and volatilized and leads the individual to feel unreal.<ref name="D. Laing- p.82-100"/> To create a more adaptive and self-enriching interaction with others in which one "feels real," the patient is encouraged to take risks through greater connection, communication, and sharing of ideas, feelings, and actions. Closer compromise means that while the patient's vulnerability to anxieties is not overcome, it is modified and managed more adaptively. Here the therapist repeatedly conveys to the patient that anxiety is inevitable but manageable, without any illusion that the vulnerability to such anxiety can be permanently dispensed with. The limiting factor is the point at which the dangers of intimacy become overwhelming and the patient must again retreat.

Klein suggests that patients must take the responsibility to place themselves at risk and to take the initiative for following through with treatment suggestions in their personal lives. It is emphasized that these are the therapist's impressions<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|95-123}} and that he or she is not reading the patient's mind or imposing an agenda but is simply stating a position that is an extension of the patient's therapeutic wish. Finally, the therapist directs attention to the need to employ these actions outside of the therapeutic setting.<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|95-123}}

===Longer-term therapy===

Klein suggests that "working through" is the second longer-term tier of psychotherapeutic work with schizoid patients.<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|123-143}} Its goals are to change fundamentally the old ways of feeling and thinking, and to rid oneself of the vulnerability to those emotions associated with old feelings and thoughts. A new therapeutic operation of "remembering with feeling" that draws on [[Donald Winnicott|D. W. Winnicott]]'s concepts of [[false self]] and [[true self]] is called for.<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|126}} The patient must remember with feeling the emergence of his or her false self through childhood, and remember the conditions and proscriptions that were imposed on the individual’s freedom to experience the self in company with others. Remembering with feeling ultimately leads the patient to understand that he or she had no opportunity to choose from a selection of possible ways of experiencing the self and of relating with others, and had few, if any, options other than to develop a schizoid stance toward others. The false self was simply the best way in which the patient could experience the repetitive predictable acknowledgment, affirmation, and approval necessary for emotional survival while warding off the effects associated with the abandonment depression.<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|123-143}}

If the goal of shorter-term therapy is for patients to understand that they are not the way they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who and what they are as human beings, what they truly are like and what they truly contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.{{clarify|reason=what are these "spontaneous, nonreactive elements"?|date=November 2012}}

Working through abandonment depression is a complicated, lengthy and conflicted process that can be an enormously painful experience in terms of what is remembered and what must be felt. It involves mourning and grieving for the loss of the illusion that the patient had adequate support for the emergence of the real self. There is also a mourning for the loss of an identity, the false self, which the person constructed and with which he or she has negotiated much of his or her life. The dismantling of the false self requires relinquishing the only way that the patient has ever known of how to interact with others. This interaction was better than not to have a stable, organized experience of the self, no matter how false, defensive, or destructive that identity may be.

The dismantling of the false self "leaves the impaired real self with the opportunity to convert its potential and its possibilities into actualities."<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|127}} Working through brings unique rewards, of which the most important element is the growing realization that the individual has a fundamental, internal need for relatedness that may be expressed in a variety of ways. "Only schizoid patients", suggests Klein, "who have worked through the abandonment depression&nbsp;... ultimately will believe that the capacity for relatedness and the wish for relatedness are woven into the structure of their beings, that they are truly part of who the patients are and what they contain as human beings. It is this sense that finally allows the schizoid patient to feel the most intimate sense of being connected with humanity more generally, and with another person more personally. For the schizoid patient, this degree of certainty is the most gratifying revelation, and a profound new organizer of the self experience."<ref name="autogenerated5" />{{rp|127}}

==Epidemiology==
SPD is uncommon in clinical settings and occurs slightly more commonly in males.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-pe02.html |title=Internet Mental Health - schizoid personality disorder |publisher=Mentalhealth.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> It is rare compared with other personality disorders, with a prevalence estimated at less than 1% of the general population.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Weismann | first = M. M. | year = 1993 | title = The epidemiology of personality disorders. A 1990 update | journal = Journal of Personality Disorders | issue = Spring issue, Suppl. | pages = 44–62 }}</ref>

Philip Manfield suggests that SPD is far more common than is reported: "I believe that the schizoid condition is far more common... comprising perhaps as many as 40 percent of all personality disorders. This huge discrepancy is probably largely because someone with a schizoid disorder is less likely to seek treatment than someone with other axis-II disorders."<ref>''Split Self, Split Object'', p.&nbsp;204.</ref> Manfield backs this claim with a 1985 study by Valliant & Drake, who found that over 40% of a particular sample group of inner city males were schizoid.
