{{homicide}}

'''Infanticide''' (or '''infant homicide''') is the intentional killing of infants. [[Neonaticide]], killing within 24 hours of a child's birth, is most commonly done by the mother whereas infanticide of a child more than one day old is slightly more likely to be committed by the father.<ref name=Marks2009>{{cite journal|journal = Psychiatry | doi = 10.1016/j.mppsy.2008.10.017 | title = Infanticide | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–12 | author = Maureen Marks | url = http://www.psychiatryjournal.co.uk/article/S1476-1793(08)00217-6/abstract}}</ref>

In many past societies, certain forms of infanticide were considered permissible. In some countries, female infanticide is more common than the killing of male offspring, due to [[sex-selective infanticide]].

==History and pre-history==
[[File:InfanticidioGarciaVega.jpg|thumb|''Infanticidio'' by Mexican artist [[Antonio García Vega]].]]
The practice of infanticide has taken many forms. [[Child sacrifice]] to supernatural figures or forces, such as the one practiced in ancient [[Carthage]], may be only the most notorious example in the [[ancient world]]. Anthropologist Laila Williamson notes that "Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations, including our own ancestors. Rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule."<ref name="InfAnAn">{{Cite book

A frequent method of infanticide in ancient Europe and Asia was simply to [[child abandonment|abandon the infant]], leaving it to die by exposure (i.e. [[hypothermia]], hunger, thirst, or animal attack).<ref name = "Justin Martyr">[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[First Apology]].''</ref><ref name="Ex&Ob">{{cite journal  | last = Boswell| first = John Eastburn| authorlink = John Boswell| title =  Exposition and oblation: the abandonment of children and the ancient and medieval family  | jstor = 1855916| journal= [[American Historical Review]]| volume = 89  | pages = 10–33  | year = 1984| doi =  10.2307/1855916  | issue = 1}}</ref> Infant abandonment still occurs in modern societies.<ref>{{Cite web

In at least one island in [[Oceania]], infanticide was carried out until the 20th century by suffocating the infant,<ref name="Collapse">[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]] (2005). ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''. ISBN 0-14-303655-6.</ref> while in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and in the [[Inca Empire]] it was carried out by sacrifice (see below).

===Paleolithic and Neolithic===
Many Neolithic groups routinely resorted to infanticide in order to control their numbers so that their lands could support them. [[Joseph Birdsell]] believed that infanticide rates in [[prehistory|prehistoric times]] were between 15% and 50% of the total number of births,<ref>{{Cite book

====In the Old World====
Three thousand bones of young children, with evidence of sacrificial rituals, have been found in [[Sardinia]]. Infants were offered to the [[Babylonian]] goddess [[Ishtar]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Pelasgians]] offered a sacrifice of every tenth child during difficult times. [[Syrians]] sacrificed children to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. Many remains of children have been found in [[Gezer]] excavations with signs of sacrifice. Child skeletons with the marks of sacrifice have been found also in [[Egypt]] dating 950-720 BCE. In [[Carthage]] "[child] sacrifice in the ancient world reached its infamous zenith."<ref name="Hardness" /><!-- p. 324 --> Besides the Carthaginians, other [[Phoenicians]], and the [[Canaanites]], [[Moabites]] and [[Sepharvite]]s offered their first-born as a sacrifice to their gods.

=====Carthage=====
<!--

Before making any edits regarding the alleged practice of child sacrifice, please read the archived discussion at [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]]. We have been around this block several times before.  

Please refrain from entering text that comes down conclusively on the question of whether or not child sacrifice was, in fact, practiced in Carthage. This question has been the subject of long and heated debate among editors of this article and has occasioned edit warring, semi-protection, etc.

The current consensus is that nobody knows for sure and that we should simply report both sides of the question without asserting which one is right. Any departure from this stance is likely to get edited out fairly quickly.

Parts of this section may be canted towards the assertion that child sacrifice ''was'' practiced in Carthage. It is reasonable to put in qualifying text that asserts that the details of the child sacrifice are based on accounts which may not be altogether reliable. 

We are in the process of looking for sources for these details so that the descriptions can be based on [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].

See [[Talk:Carthage/Human Sacrifice]] for details of past debate on this topic.

{{Main|Carthaginian#Child sacrifice question|l1=Carthaginian - Child Sacrifice Question}}

According to Shelby Brown, [[Carthaginian]]s, descendants of the [[Phoenicia]]ns, sacrificed infants to their gods.<ref name="Brown 1991">{{Cite book| last = Brown | first = Shelby | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context| publisher = Sheffield Academic Press| year = 1991| location = Sheffield | pages = }}</ref> Charred bones of hundreds of infants have been found in Carthaginian archaeological sites. One such area harbored as many as 20,000 burial [[urn]]s.<ref name="Brown 1991"/>  Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children that died naturally.<ref>Sergio Ribichini, "Beliefs and Religious Life" in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p.141</ref>

[[Plutarch]] (ca. 46–120 [[Common Era|AD]]) mentions the practice, as do [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], Diodorus Siculus and [[Philo]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] also mentions what appears to be child sacrifice practiced at a place called the [[Tophet]] (from the Hebrew ''taph'' or ''toph'', to burn) by the [[Canaan]]ites. Writing in the 3rd century BCE, [[Kleitarchos]], one of the historians of [[Alexander the Great]], described that the infants rolled into the flaming pit. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote that babies were roasted to death inside the burning pit of the god [[Baal#Ba.27al of Carthage|Baal Hamon]], a bronze statue.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Brown  | first = Shelby  | title = Late Carthaginian Child Sacrifice and Sacrificial Monuments in their Mediterranean Context| publisher = Sheffield Academic Press| year = 1991| location = Sheffield | pages = 22–23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Stager| first = Lawrence| authorlink = Lawrence Stager| coauthors = Samuel R.

=====Greece and Rome=====
[[Image:Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 031.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Medea]] killing her sons,  by [[Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix]] (1862).]]
The historical Greeks considered the practice of adult and child sacrifice [[barbarous]].<ref>{{Cite book| last= Hughes|first = Dennis D.| authorlink = | coauthors =|title = Human Sacrifice in Ancient Greece | publisher = Routledge|year = 1991|location = |pages = 187|url =| isbn=0-415-03483-3 }}</ref> However, exposure of newborns was widely practiced in [[ancient Greece]]. In Greece the decision to expose a child was typically the father's, although in Sparta the decision was made by a group of elders.<ref>See Plutarch's ''Life of Lycurgus''.</ref> Exposure was the preferred method of disposal, as that act in itself was not murder; moreover, the exposed child technically had a chance of being rescued by the gods or any passersby.<ref>See (e.g.) Budin 2004, 122-23.</ref> This very situation was a recurring motif in [[Greek mythology]].<ref>[[Infant exposure]]</ref>
To notify the neighbors of a birth of a child, a woolen strip was hung over the front door - this indicated a female baby. An olive branch indicated a boy had been born. Families did not always keep their new child. After a woman had a baby, she would show it to her husband. If the husband accepted it, it would live, but if he refused it, it would die. Babies would often be rejected if they were illegitimate, unhealthy or deformed, the wrong sex (female for example), or too great a burden on the family. These babies would not be directly killed, but put in a clay pot or jar and deserted outside the front door or on the roadway. In ancient Greek religion, this practice took the responsibility away from the parents because the child would die of natural causes, for example hunger, asphyxiation or exposure to the elements.

The practice was prevalent in [[ancient Rome]], as well. [[Philo]] was the first philosopher to speak out against it.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Philo| first = | authorlink = Philo| title =  The Special Laws| publisher =  [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  1950| location =  Cambridge| pages =  III, XX.117, Volume VII, pp. 118, 551, 549| url =| doi= | nopp = true}}</ref> A letter from a Roman citizen to his sister, dating from 1 BCE, demonstrates the casual nature with which infanticide was often viewed:
:"I am still in Alexandria. ... I beg and plead with you to take care of our little child, and as soon as we receive wages, I will send them to you. In the meantime, if (good fortune to you!) you give birth, if it is a boy, let it live; if it is a girl, expose it."<ref>[http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-privatelife249.shtml  "249.

In some periods of [[Roman history]] it was traditional for a newborn to be brought to the ''[[pater familias]]'', the family [[Patriarchy|patriarch]], who would then decide whether the child was to be kept and raised, or left to die by exposure.<ref name=Crossan>John Crossan, ''The Essential Jesus: Original Sayings and Earliest Images'', p. 151 (Castle, 1994, 1998).

According to mythological legend, [[Romulus and Remus]], twin infant sons of the war god, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], survived near-infanticide after being tossed into the Tiber River. According to the mythology, they were raised by wolves and later founded the city of Rome.

=====Judaism=====
Judaism prohibits infanticide, and has for some time, dating back to at least early [[Common Era]].  Roman historians wrote about the ideas and customs of other peoples, which often diverged from their own. [[Tacitus]] recorded that the Jews "regard it as a crime to kill any late-born children."<ref name="Histories">{{Cite book| last = Tacitus| first = | authorlink = Tacitus| title =  [[The Histories (Tacitus)|The Histories]]| publisher =  William Heinemann| year =  1931| location =  London|  pages=  Volume II, 183|url =  | doi=    | nopp = true  }}</ref> [[Josephus]], whose works give an important insight into 1st-century Judaism, wrote that God "forbids women to cause abortion of what is begotten, or to destroy it afterward."<ref>{{Cite book| last = Josephus| first = | authorlink = Josephus| title =  The Works of Flavius Josephus, "Against Apion"| publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]| year =  1976| location =  Cambridge| pages =  II.25, p. 597| url =  | doi=     }}</ref>

=====Pagan European tribes=====
In his book ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', [[Tacitus]] wrote that the ancient [[Germanic tribes]] enforced a similar prohibition. He found such mores remarkable and commented: ''"[The Germani] hold it shameful to kill any unwanted child."'' Modern scholarship differs. [[John Boswell]] believed that in ancient Germanic tribes unwanted children were exposed, usually in the forest.<ref name="KofS">{{Cite book| last = Boswell| first = John| authorlink = John Boswell| title =  The Kindness of Strangers| publisher = Vintage Books| year =  1988| location =  NY| pages =  | url =| doi=}}</ref><!-- p. 218 --> "It was the custom of the [Teutonic] pagans, that if they wanted to kill a son or daughter, they would be killed before they had been given any food."<ref name="KofS"/><!-- p. 211 -->  Usually children born out of wedlock were disposed that way.

The last canto, ''Marjatan poika'' (Son of Marjatta), of Finnish [[national epic]] [[Kalevala]] describes an assumed infanticide. [[Väinämöinen]] orders the infant [[legitimacy (law)|bastard]] son of Marjatta to be drowned in [[marsh]].

The [[Íslendingabók]], a main source for the early history of [[Iceland]], recounts that on the [[Íslendingabók#7. Conversion of Iceland to Christianity|Conversion of Iceland to Christianity]] in 1000 it was provided - in order to make the transition more palatable to Pagans - that "(...)the old laws allowing exposure of newborn children will remain in force".
However, this provision - like other concessions made at the time to the Pagans - was abolished some years later.

===Christianity===
[[Christianity]] rejects infanticide. The ''Teachings of the [[Apostles]]'' or ''[[Didache]]'' said ''"You shall not kill that which is born."''<ref>{{Cite book

====Middle Ages====
Whereas theologians and clerics preached sparing their lives, newborn abandonment continued as registered in both the literature record and in legal documents.<ref name="Ex&Ob"/><!-- p. 16 --> According to [[William L.

Unlike other European regions, in the Middle Ages the German mother had the right to expose the newborn.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Westrup| first = C.W.| authorlink = | title =  Introduction to Roman Law| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| year = 1944| location =  London| pages = 249| url =  | doi=}}</ref> In [[Gotland]], [[Sweden]], children were also sacrificed.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Turville-Petre|first = Gabriel | authorlink = Gabriel Turville-Petre| title =Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia | publisher = Holt, Rinehart & Winston|year = 1964|location =NY |pages = 253|url =}}</ref>

In the High Middle Ages, abandoning unwanted children finally eclipsed infanticide. Unwanted children were left at the door of church or abbey, and the clergy was assumed to take care of their upbringing. This practice also gave rise to the first [[orphanage]]s.

===Arabia===
The [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n society practiced infanticide as a form of "post-partum birth control".<ref name="Children">[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], ''Children''</ref> Regarding the prevalence of this practice, we know it was "common enough among the pre-Islamic Arabs to be assigned a specific term, ''waʾd''".<ref name="EoQ-Infanticide">Donna Lee Bowen, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Infanticide</ref> Infanticide was practiced either out of destitution (thus practiced on males and females alike), or as sacrifices to gods, or as "disappointment and fear of social disgrace felt by a father upon the birth of a daughter".<ref name="Children"/>

Some authors believe that there is little evidence that infanticide was prevalent in pre-Islamic [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] or early [[Muslim history]], except for the case of the [[Banu Tamim|Tamim tribe]], who practiced it during severe famine.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Lammens|first = Henri| authorlink = | title = Islam.

Other passages condemning infanticide in the Qur'an appear in LXXXI:8-9, XVI:60-62, XVII:42 and XLII:48.</ref>

The [[Qur'an]] rejected the practice of infanticide. Together with [[polytheism]] and [[homicide]], infanticide was regarded as a grave sin (see {{cite quran|6|151|style=nosup|expand=no}} and {{cite quran|60|12|style=nosup|expand=no}}).<ref name="Children"/> Infanticide is also implicitly denounced in the story of Pharaoh's slaughter of the male children of Israelites (see  {{cite quran|2|49|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|7|127|style=nosup|expand=no}};   {{cite quran|7|141|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|14|6|style=nosup|expand=no}}; {{cite quran|28|4|style=nosup|expand=no}} ;{{cite quran|40|25|style=nosup|expand=no}}).<ref name="Children"/>

===Ukraine and Russia===
Infanticide may have been practiced as human sacrifice, as part of the [[pagan]] cult of [[Perun]]. [[Ibn Fadlan]] describes sacrificial practices at the time of his trip to Kiev Rus (present day Ukraine) in 921-922 CE, and describes an incident of a woman voluntarily sacrificing her life as part of a [[funeral rite]] for a prominent leader, but makes no mention of infanticide. The [[Primary Chronicle]], one of the most important literary sources before the 12th century, indicates that human sacrifice to idols may have been introduced by [[Vladimir the Great]] in 980 CE. The same Vladimir the Great formally converted Kiev Rus into [[Christianity]] just 8 years later, but pagan cults continued to be practiced clandestinely in remote areas as late as the 13th century. 

In [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]], babies were killed and thrown to the dogs.<ref name="StAnHist"/><!--p. 105--> American explorer [[George Kennan (explorer)|George Kennan]] noted that among the [[Koryaks]], a [[Mongoloid]] people of north-eastern [[Siberia]], infanticide was still common in the 19th century.

Philosopher [[Han Fei Tzu]], a member of the ruling aristocracy of the 3rd century BC, who developed a school of law, wrote: ''"As to children, a father and mother when they produce a boy congratulate one another, but when they produce a girl they put it to death."''<ref>{{Cite book| last= Yu-Lan|first = Fung| authorlink = |title = A History of Chinese Philosophy| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]|year = 1952|location = Princeton|pages = 327|url =}}</ref> Among the [[Hakka people]], and in [[Yunnan]], [[Anhui]], [[Sichuan]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]] a method of killing the baby was to put her into a bucket of cold water, which was called "baby water".<ref>{{Cite book| last= Yao |first = Esther S.

Infanticide was known in China as early as the 3rd century BC, and, by the time of the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), it was widespread in some provinces. [[Buddhist]] belief in transmigration allowed poor residents of the country to kill their newborn children if they felt unable to care for them, hoping that they would be reborn in better circumstances. Furthermore, the Chinese did not consider newborn children fully "human", and saw "life" beginning at some point after the sixth month after birth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fate and fortune in rural China: social organization and population behavior in Liaoning, 1774-1873|authors=James Z. Lee, Cameron D. Campbell|page=70}}</ref>

Contemporary writers from the Song Dynasty note that, in [[Hubei]] and [[Fujian]] provinces, residents would only keep three sons and two daughters (among poor farmers, two sons and one daughter), and kill all babies beyond that number at birth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Drowning girls in China: female infanticide since 1650|author=David E. Mungello|pages=5–8}}</ref> Initially the sex of the child was only one factor to consider. By the time of the Ming Dynasty, however (1368–1644), male infanticide was becoming increasingly uncommon. The prevalence of female infanticide remained high much longer. The magnitude of this practice is subject to some dispute; however, one commonly quoted estimate is that, by late [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]], between one fifth and one quarter of all newborn girls, across the entire social spectrum, were victims of infanticide. If one includes excess mortality among female children under 10 (ascribed to gender-differential neglect), the share of victims rises to one third.<ref>{{cite book|title=Drowning daughters: A cultural history of female infanticide in late nineteenth century China|author=Michelle Tien King}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Fate and fortune in rural China: social organization and population behavior in Liaoning, 1774-1873|authors=James Z.

Scottish Physician [[John Dudgeon]], who worked in [[Beijing]], China, during the [[Qing Dynasty]] said that in China, "Infanticide does not prevail to the extent so generally believed among us, and in the north it does not exist at all."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=wcriTbeZGMjUgAee6K23Bg&ct=result&output=text&id=sB9t4PIqNhQC&dq=formosa+china+partial+same+race&q=Infanticide+does+not+prevail+to+the+extent+so+generally+believed+among+us%2C+and+in+the+north+it+does+not+exist+at+all#v=snippet&q=Infanticide%20does%20not%20prevail%20to%20the%20extent%20so%20generally%20believed%20among%20us%2C%20and%20in%20the%20north%20it%20does%20not%20exist%20at%20all&f=false|title=The Diseases of China, including Formosa and Korea|volume=|year=1910|author=William Hamilton Jefferys|edition= |publisher=P.

They respond readily to kindness and are in every way satisfactory from a professional point of view. Not infrequently simply good feeding and plenty of oxygen will work the most marvellous cures. Permission is almost invariably asked to remain with the child in the hospital, and it is far better to grant the request, since, after a few days when all is well and the child is happy, the adult will gladly enough withdraw. Meanwhile, much has been gained. Whereas the effort to argue parents into leaving a child at once and the difficulty of winning the frightened child are enormous.

The Chinese infant usually has a pretty good start in life.

====Japan====

Since feudal [[Japan]] the common slang for infanticide was ''"mabiki"'' (間引き) which means to pull plants from an overcrowded garden. A typical method in Japan was smothering through wet paper on the baby's mouth and nose.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000433-198607020-00004 | last = Shiono| first = Hiroshi| authorlink = | coauthors = Atoyo Maya, Noriko Tabata, Masataka Fujiwara, Jun-ich Azumi and Mashahiko Morita| title =  Medicolegal aspects of infanticide in Hokkaido District, Japan| journal =  American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 104–6| publisher = | year = 1986| url = | pmid = 3740005 }}</ref> Mabiki persisted in the 19th century and early 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Vaux| first = Kenneth| authorlink = | title = Birth Ethics | publisher = Crossroad | year = 1989 | location = NY | pages = 12| url =}}</ref>

====South Asia====
[[Female infanticide]] of newborn girls was systematic in feudatory [[Rajputs]] in [[South Asia]] for [[illegitimate]] female children during the Middle Ages. According to [[Firishta]], as soon as the illegitimate female child was born she was held "in one hand, and a knife in the other, that any person who wanted a wife might take her now, otherwise she was immediately put to death".<ref>{{Cite book| last = Westermarck| first = Edward| authorlink = Edward Westermarck| title =  A Short History of Marriage| publisher =  Humanities Press| year =  1968| location =  NY| pages =  Vol. III, 162| url = | doi= }}</ref> The practice of female infanticide was also common among the [[Kutch]], Kehtri, [[Nagar, Bangladesh|Nagar]], [[Bengal]], Miazed, Kalowries in India inhabitants, and also among the [[Sindh]] in [[British India]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Panigrahi| first = Lalita |title =  British Social Policy and Female Infanticidein India| publisher =  Munshiram Manoharlal| year =  1972| location = New Delhi| pages = 18| url = | doi=  }}</ref>

===Africa===

In [[Africa]] some children were killed because of fear that they were an evil omen or because they were considered unlucky. Twins were usually put to death in Arebo; as well as by the Nama Hottentots of [[South West Africa]]; in the [[Lake Victoria|Lake Victoria Nyanza]] region; by the [[Tswana people|Tswana]] in [[Portuguese East Africa]]; among the Ilso and [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]]; and by the [[!Kung people|!Kung]] [[Bushmen]] of the [[Kalahari Desert]].<ref name="Hardness"/><!--pp. 160-161 --> The [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Kenya]]'s most populous ethnic group, practiced [[Religious abuse|ritual killing of twins]].<ref>{{Cite book

===Australia===
Literature suggests infanticide may have occurred reasonably commonly amongst Indigenous Australians, in all areas of Australia prior to European settlement.  Infanticide may have continued to occur quite often up until the 1960s.  An 1866 issue of 'The Australian News for Home Readers' informed readers that "the crime of infanticide is so prevalent amongst the natives that it is rare to see an infant."<ref>{{cite web|title=My First Born|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/63170296|accessdate=13 April 2013|location=Victoria, Australia|pages=5|date=20 January 1866}}</ref>

Author Susanna de Vries in 2007 told a newspaper that her accounts of Aboriginal violence, including infanticide, was censored by publishers in the 1980s and 1990s.  She told reporters that the censorship "stemmed from guilt over the stolen children question."<ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007">{{cite web|title=Aboriginal violence was 'sanitised'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/aboriginal-violence-was-sanitised/story-e6frg6nf-1111113906387|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=13 April 2013|author=Justine Ferrari|date=7 July 2007}}</ref>  [[Keith Windschuttle]] weighed in on the conversation, saying this type of censorship started in the 1970s.<ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007" />  In the same article [[Louis Nowra]] suggested that infanticide in customary Aboriginal law may have been because it was difficult to keep an abundant number of Aboriginal children alive; there were life-and-death decisions modern-day Australians no longer have to face.<ref name="Aboriginalviolence'Sanitised'2007" />

According to [[William D. Rubinstein]], "Nineteenth-century European observers of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] life in South Australia and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] reported that about 30% of Aboriginal infants were killed at birth."<ref>{{Cite book | last = Rubinstein | first = W.

[[James Dawson (activist)|James Dawson]] wrote a passage about infanticide amongst Indigenous people in the western district of Victoria, which stated that "Twins are as common among them as among Europeans; but as food is occasionally very scarce, and a large family troublesome to move about, it is lawful and customary to destroy the weakest twin child, irrespective of sex. 
It is usual also to destroy those which are malformed."<ref name=VictorianAboriginalInfanticide>{{cite web|title=Australian Aborigines: The Languages and Customs of Several Tribes of Aborigines in the Western District of Victoria, Australia|publisher=George Robertson (reissued by Cambridge University Press, 2009; ISBN 978-1-108-00655-2)|author=James Dawson|year=1881}}</ref> 

He also wrote "When a woman has children too rapidly for the convenience and necessities of the parents, she makes up her mind to let one be killed, and consults with her husband which it is to be. As the strength of a tribe depends more on males than females, the girls are generally sacrificed.
The child is put to death and buried, or burned without ceremony; not, however, by its father or mother, but by relatives. No one wears mourning for it.
Sickly children are never killed on account of their bad health, and are allowed to die naturally."<ref name=VictorianAboriginalInfanticide />

In 1937, a reverend in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] offered a "baby bonus" to Aboriginal families as a deterrent against infanticide and to increase the birthrate of the local Indigenous population.<ref name=RevLoveBabyBonus>{{cite web|title=Iron-Roofed Cottage as Baby Bonus|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/85590904|publisher=The Daily News|accessdate=13 April 2013|location=Perth, Western Australia|date=11 March 1937}}</ref>

Killings of newborn babies has been on the rise in [[Pakistan]], corresponding to an increase in poverty across the country.<ref name =tribune/> More than 1,000 infants, mostly girls, have been killed or abandoned to die in Pakistan in 2009 according a Pakistani charity organization. Infanticide of girls in Pakistan is attributed to a [[patriarchal]] society where women are less valued than men.<ref>Daughter neglect, women's work, and marriage: Pakistan and Bangladesh compared

The [[Edhi Foundation]] found 1,210 dead babies in 2010. Many more are abandoned and left at the doorsteps of mosques. As a result Edhi centers feature signs "Do not murder, lay them here." Though female infanticide is punishable by life in prison, such crimes are rarely prosecuted.<ref name =tribune>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/105019/infanticide-on-the-rise-in-pakistan-statistics/ Infanticide on the rise: 1,210 babies found dead in 2010, says Edhi], The Tribune, January 18, 2011.</ref>

==Modern proposals==
In a 2012 article in the [[Journal of Medical Ethics]], a philosopher and a bioethicist jointly proposed that infanticide be legalized, calling it "after-birth abortion", and claiming that both "the fetus and the newborn are potential persons". Many replies were published to this article.<ref>http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full</ref>

===Child euthanasia===
{{Main|Child euthanasia}}
[[Euthanasia]] applied to children that are gravely ill or that suffer from significant birth defects is legal in the [[Netherlands]] under rigidly controlled conditions, but controversial.<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp058026</ref> Some critics have compared child euthanasia to infanticide.

==Explanations for the practice==

There are various reasons for infanticide.  Neonaticide typically has different patterns and causes than for killing of older infants. Traditional neonaticide is often related to economic necessity - inability to provide for the infant.  

In England and the United States, Older infants are typically killed for reasons related to [[child abuse]], [[domestic violence]] or mental illness.<ref name=Marks2009/> For infants older than one day, younger infants are more at risk, and boys are more at risk than girls.<ref name=Marks2009/> Risk factors for the parent include: Family history of violence, violence in current relationship, history of abuse or neglect of children, and personality disorder and/or depression.<ref name=Marks2009/>

===Economic===
Many historians believe the reason to be primarily economic, with more children born than the family is prepared to support.  In societies that are [[patrilineal]] and [[patrilocal]], the family may choose to allow more sons to live and kill some daughters, as the former will support their birth family until they die, whereas the latter will leave economically and geographically to join their husband's family, possibly only after the payment of a burdensome [[dowry]] price.  Thus the decision to bring up a boy is more economically rewarding to the parents.<ref name="Hardness">{{Cite book| last = Milner  | first = Larry S.  | title = Hardness of Heart / Hardness of Life: The Stain of Human Infanticide  | publisher = University Press of America  | location =  Lanham/New York/Oxford| year = 2000| url =  | doi =   |isbn=0-7618-1578-3}}</ref><!-- pp. 362-368 --> However, this does not explain why infanticide would occur equally among rich and poor, nor why it would be as frequent during decadent periods of the [[Roman Empire]] as during earlier, less affluent, periods.<ref name="Hardness"/><!-- pp. 28-34 & 187-192-->

Before the appearance of effective [[contraception]], infanticide was a common occurrence in ancient brothels. Unlike usual infanticide - where historically girls have been more likely to be killed - prostitutes in certain areas preferred to kill their male offspring.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14401305 ''Roman dead baby 'brothel' mystery deepens''], BBC</ref>

====UK 18th and 19th Century====

Instances of infanticide in Britain in 18th and 19th century is often attributed to the economic position of the women, with juries committing [[Jury nullification|pious perjury]] in many subsequent murder cases. The knowledge of the difficulties  faced in the 18th century by those women who attempted to keep their children can be seen as reason for juries to show compassion. If the woman chose to keep the child, society was not set up to ease the pressure placed upon the woman, legally, socially or economically.<ref>{{Cite book|  last = McLynn  |  first = Frank  | title = Crime and Punishment in 18th Century England  |  publisher = Routledge  |  location = London  |  year = 1989  |  pages = 102}}</ref>

In mid-18th century Britain there was assistance available for women who were not able to raise their children. The Foundling Hospital opened in 1756 and was able to take in some of the illegitimate children. However, the conditions within the hospital caused [[Parliament]] to withdraw funding and the governors to live off of their own incomes.<ref>{{cite journal  |  last = unknown  |  first = unknown  |  title = The Foundling Hospital and Neighbourhood  |  journal = Old and New London Journal  |  volume = 5  |  year = 1878  |  url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk }}</ref> This resulted in a stringent entrance policy, with the committee requiring that the hospital:

'Will not receive a child that is more than a year old, nor the child of a domestic servant, nor any child whose father can be compelled to maintain it'.<ref name="unknown 1878">{{cite journal  |  last = unknown  |  first = unknown  |  title = The Foundling Hospital and Neighbourhood  |  journal = Old and New London Journal  |  volume = 5  |  issue =   |  pages =   |  year = 1878  |  url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk }}</ref>

Once a mother had admitted her child to the hospital, the hospital did all it could to ensure that the parent and child were not re-united.<ref name="unknown 1878"/>

Macfarlane argues in Illegitimacy and Illegitimates in Britain (1980) that English society greatly concerned itself with the burden that a bastard child places upon its communities and had gone to some lengths to ensure that the father of the child is identified in order to maintain its wellbeing.<ref>{{Cite book|  last = MacFarlane  |  first = Alan  |  title = Illegitimacy and Illegitimates in English History  |  volume =   |  issue =   |  pages = 75  |  publisher = Arnold   |  location =   |  year = 1980  |  url =  |  work = Bastardy and its Comparative History   }}</ref> Assistance could be gained through maintenance payments from the father, however, this was capped ‘at a miserable 2s and 6d a week’.<ref name="Rose 1986 28">{{Cite book|  last = Rose  |  first = Lionel  |  title = Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800-1939  |  book =   |  volume =   |  issue =   |  pages = 28  |  publisher = Routledge and Kegan  |  location = London  |  year = 1986  |  url =   }}</ref> If the father got into arrears with the payments he could only be asked ‘to pay a maximum of 13 weeks arrears’.<ref name="Rose 1986 28"/>

Despite the accusations of some that women were getting a free hand-out there is evidence that many women were far from receiving adequate assistance from their parish. ‘Within Leeds in 1822 … relief was limited to 1s per week’.<ref>{{Cite book|  last = Rose  |  first = Lionel  |  title = Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800-1939  |  book =   |  volume =   |  issue =   |  pages = 25  |  publisher = Routledge and Kegan  |  location = London  |  year = 1986  |  url =   }}</ref> Sheffield required women to enter the [[workhouse]], whereas Halifax gave no relief to the women who required it. The prospect of entering the workhouse was certainly something to be avoided. Lionel Rose quotes Dr Joseph Rogers in Massacre of the Innocents … (1986). Dr Rogers, who was employed by a London workhouse in 1856 stated that conditions in the nursery were ‘wretchedly damp and miserable … [and] … overcrowded with young mothers and their infants’.<ref>{{Cite book|  last = Rose  |  first = Lionel  |  title = Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800-1939  |  book =   |  volume =   |  issue =   |  pages = 31–33  |  publisher = Routledge and Kegan  |  location = London  |  year = 1986   }}</ref>

The loss of social standing for a servant girl was a particular problem in respect of producing a bastard child as they relied upon a good character reference in order to maintain their job and more importantly, to get a new or better job. In a large number of trials for the crime of infanticide, it is the servant girl that stood accused.<ref>{{Cite book|  last = McLynn  |  first = Frank  | title = Crime and Punishment in 18th Century England  |  publisher = Routledge  |  location = London  |  year = 1989  |  pages = 111}}</ref> The disadvantage of being a servant girl is that they had to live to the social standards of their superiors or risk dismissal and no references. Whereas within other professions, such as in the factory, the relationship between employer and employee was much more anonymous and the mother would be better able to make other provisions, such as employing a minder.<ref>{{Cite book|  last = Rose  |  first = Lionel  |  title = Massacre of the Innocents: Infanticide in Great Britain 1800-1939  |  book =   |  volume =   |  issue =   |  pages = 19  |  publisher = Routledge and Kegan  |  location = London  |  year = 1986  |  url =   }}</ref>  The result of the lack of basic social care in Britain in the 18th and 19th century is the numerous accounts in court records of women, particularly servant girls, standing trial for the murder of their child.<ref>{{Cite book|  last = Hitchcock/Shoemaker  |  first = Tim/Robert  |  title =   |  web page = The Proceedings of the Old Bailey  |  volume =   |  issue =   |  pages =   |  publisher = University of Sheffield and University of Hertfordshire  |  location =   |  year = 2006  |  url = http://www.oldbaileyonline.org }}</ref>

There may have been no specific offence of infanticide in England before about 1623 because infanticide was a matter for the  by [[ecclesiastical court]]s, possibly because [[Infant mortality]] from natural causes was high (about 15% or one in six) <ref>{{cite book

Thereafter the accusation of the suppression of bastard children by lewd mothers was a crime incurring the presumption of guilt<ref>{{cite web |title= The history of infanticide in England

The '''[[Infanticide Act]]s''' is the name of several [[English Law|laws]]. That of 1922 made the  killing of an infant child by its mother during the early months of life as a lesser crime than murder. The acts of 1938 and 1939 abolished the earlier act, but introduced the idea that [[Postpartum depression]] was legally to be regarded as a form of [[diminished responsibility]].

===Population control===
[[Marvin Harris]] estimated that among Paleolithic [[hunter]]s 23-50% of newborn children were killed. He argued that the goal was to preserve the 0.001% population growth of that time.<ref name="Cannibals&Kings"/><!-- p. 15 --> He also wrote that female infanticide may be a form of [[population control]].<ref name="Cannibals&Kings">{{Cite book| last = Harris  | first = Marvin  | authorlink = Marvin Harris  | title = Cannibals and Kings: The Origins of Cultures  | publisher = Random House  | year = 1977   | location = NY  | url =  | doi =    }}</ref><!-- p. 5 --> Population control is achieved not only by limiting the number of potential mothers; increased fighting among men for access to relatively scarce wives would also lead to a decline in population. For example, on the [[Melanesia]]n island of [[Tikopia]] infanticide was used to keep a stable population in line with its [[carrying capacity|resource base]].<ref name="Collapse"/><!--He devotes a chapter to this aspect of Tikopia--> Research by Marvin Harris and [[William Divale]] supports this argument, it has been cited as an example of [[environmental determinism]].<ref>{{Cite book| last = Hallpike | first = C.R.  | authorlink =   | title = The Principles of Social Evolution  | publisher = Claredon Press  | year = 1988  | location = Oxford| pages = 237–238  | url =  | doi =    }}</ref>

===Customs and taboos===
In 1888, Lieut. F. Elton reported that Ugi beach people in the [[Solomon Islands]] killed their infants at birth by burying them, and women were also said to practice abortion. They reported that it was too much trouble to raise a child, and instead preferred to buy one from the bush people.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Elton| first = Lieut. F.| authorlink =  | title =  Notes  on Natives of the Solomon Islands | journal =  The Journal  of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland| volume = 17| issue = | pages = 90–99| year = 1988| jstor =2841588| doi =  10.2307/2841588 }}</ref> Larry S. Milner, author of ''Hardness of Heart/Hardness of Life'', a treatise on infanticide, believes that superstition has always reigned supreme in tribal religion. In chapters 9 through 21 Milner explores diverse customs and taboos as possible causes of infanticide, from punishment and shame to poverty, famine, revenge, depression and insanity and superstitious omens.

===Psychological===

====Evolutionary psychology====
[[Evolutionary psychology]] have proposed several theories for different forms of infanticide. Infanticide by stepfathers, as well as child abuse in general by stepfathers, has been explained by spending resources on not genetically related children reducing [[reproductive success]] (See the [[Cinderella effect]] and  [[Infanticide (zoology)]]). Infanticide is one of the few forms of violence more often done by women than men. Cross-cultural research have found that this is more likely to occur when the child has deformities or illnesses as well as when there are lacking resources due to factors such as poverty, other children requiring resources, and no male support. Such a child may have a low chance of reproductive success in which case it would decrease the mother's [[inclusive fitness]], in particular since women generally have a greater [[parental investment]] than men, to spend resources on the child. .<ref>{{cite doi|10.1037/a0026610}}</ref>

===="Early infanticidal childrearing"====
A minority of academics subscribe to an alternate school of thought, considering the practice as "[[early infanticidal childrearing]]".<ref name="EMOL">{{Cite book| last = deMause  | first = Lloyd  | authorlink = Lloyd deMause | title = The Emotional Life of Nations
  | publisher = Karnak  | year = 2002  | location = NY, London  | pages = 258–262}}</ref><!-- pp. 246-247--> They attribute parental infanticidal wishes to massive [[projection (psychology)|projection]] or [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] of the parents' [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] onto the child, because of intergenerational, ancestral abuse by their own parents.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Godwin   | first = Robert W.  | title = One cosmos under God  | publisher = Paragon House
  | year = 2004  | location = Minnesota  | pages = 124–176}}</ref> Clearly, an infanticidal parent may have multiple motivations, conflicts, emotions, and thoughts about their baby and their relationship with their baby, which are often colored both by their individual psychology, current relational context and attachment history, and, perhaps most saliently, their psychopathology<ref>Almeida A, Merminod G, Schechter DS (2009).  Mothers with severe psychiatric illness and their newborns:  a hospital-based model of perinatal consultation. Journal of ZERO-TO-THREE: National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families, 29(5), 40-46.</ref> (See also Psychiatric section below) Almeida, Merminod, and Schechter<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Schechter</ref> suggest that parents with fantasies, projections, and delusions involving infanticide need to be taken seriously and assessed carefully, whenever possible, by an interdisciplinary team that includes infant mental health specialists or mental health practitioners who have experience in working with parents, children, and families.

====Wider effects====
In addition to debates over the morality of infanticide itself, there is some debate over the effects of infanticide on surviving children, and the effects of childrearing in societies that also sanction infanticide. Some argue that the practice of infanticide in any widespread form causes enormous psychological damage in children.<ref name="EMOL"/><!-- p. 261-262--> Conversely, studying societies that practice infanticide [[Géza Róheim]] reported that even infanticidal mothers in [[New Guinea]], who ate a child, did not affect the personality development of the surviving children; that "these are good mothers who eat their own children".<ref>{{Cite book| last = Róheim| first = Géza| authorlink = Géza Róheim| title =  Psychoanalysis and Anthropology| publisher = International Universities Press | year = 1950 | location = NY | pages =  60–62}}</ref> Harris and Divale's work on the relationship between female infanticide and warfare suggests that there are, however, extensive negative effects.

===Psychiatric===
{{see also|Psychiatric disorders of childbirth}}

[[Postpartum psychosis]] is also a causative factor of infanticide. Stuart S. Asch, MD, a Professor of Psychiatry at [[Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University|Cornell University]] established the connections between some cases of infanticide and post-partum depression.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5239550 Asch SS.

Stanley Hopwood wrote that childbirth and lactation entail severe stress on the female sex, and that under certain circumstances attempts at infanticide and suicide are common.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Hopwood  | first = Stanley, J.  | title = Child murder and insanity  | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Psychopathology  | volume = 73  | pages = 96  | year = 1927}}</ref> A study published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' revealed that 44% of filicidal [[father]]s had a diagnosis of [[psychosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Campion| first = John| authorlink = | coauthors = James M.

In addition, severe [[postpartum depression]] can lead to infanticide.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Perspect Public Health| year = 2009 | volume = 129 | number = 5 | pages = 221–7 | title = Postnatal depression: a global public health perspective | author = Almond P.}}</ref>

===Genetic===

Larry Milner writes in the concluding chapter of his study of infanticide:

<blockquote>So with this strata of support, I have concluded that it is a normal — a "natural"— trait for a human being to be willing to kill his or her own child, especially during the first year of life, and that there are [[Genetics|genetic factors]] which are determinative of this compulsion.<ref name="Hardness"/><!-- p. 547 --></blockquote>

However, Milner's treatise includes at the same time cultural hypotheses for the practice, and his approach to the subject has been criticized as both scholarly and an idealized view of infanticide.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Tort| first = Cesar| authorlink = | title =  A schizophrenic yet very useful monograph on infanticide| journal =  [[Journal of Psychohistory]]| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 186–189| publisher = | location =  NY| year = 2008| url = http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SUDKIDV50BA8}}</ref>

===Sex selection===
<!-- Female infanticide redirects here -->
[[Sex selection]] may be one of the contributing factors of infanticide. In the absence of [[sex-selective abortion]], [[sex-selective infanticide]] can be deduced from very skewed birth statistics. The biologically normal [[sex ratio for humans]] at birth is approximately 105 males per 100 females; normal ratios hardly ranging beyond 102-108.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Barclay|first = George W.| authorlink = |title = Techniques of Population Analysis| publisher = John Wiley & Sons|year = 1958|location = NY|pages = 83}}</ref> When a society has an infant male to female ratio which is [[statistical significance|significantly]] higher or lower than the biological norm, sex selection can usually be inferred.

==Current law==

===England and Wales===
In [[England and Wales]], the [[Infanticide Act 1938]] describes the offence of infanticide as one which would otherwise amount to murder (by his/her mother) if the victim was older than 12 months and the mother was not suffering from an imbalance of mind due to the effects of childbirth or lactation. Where a mother who has killed such an infant has been charged with murder rather than infanticide s.1(3) of the Act confirms that a jury has the power to find alternative verdicts of [[manslaughter|Manslaughter in English law]] or guilty but insane.

===Romania===
The Romanian Penal Code defines infanticide (''pruncucidere'') as a distinct criminal offense, providing for a maximum punishment of 7 years imprisonment, recognizing the fact that a mother's judgement may be impaired immediately after birth.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cjo.ro/coduri-de-drept/codul-penal#Infractiuni%20contra%20persoanei | title=Penal Code of Romania, art. 177 | accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref> Romanian legislation, however, does not define the term "infant", and this has led to debates regarding the precise moment when infanticide becomes homicide. This issue is to be resolved by a new Penal Code, scheduled to come into force in 2014, which states that infanticide can only occur in the first 24 hours after birth.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dreptonline.ro/legislatie/codul_penal_2009.php | title=Romanian Penal Code of 2009, art. 200 | accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref> The new Code will also reduce the maximum sentence to 5 years imprisonment.

===United States===
In 2009, [[Texas]] state representative [[Jessica Farrar]] proposed legislation that would define infanticide as a distinct and lesser crime than [[homicide]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/032209dnmetinfanticide.3030173.html Proposed Texas House bill would recognize postpartum psychosis as a defense for moms who kill infants]</ref> Under the terms of the proposed legislation, if jurors concluded that a mother's "judgment was impaired as a result of the effects of giving birth or the effects of lactation following the birth," they would be allowed to convict her of the crime of infanticide, rather than murder.<ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/when-infanticide-isnt-mur_b_279703.html When Infanticide Isn't Murder]</ref> The maximum penalty for infanticide would be two years in prison.<ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder"/> Farrar's introduction of this bill prompted liberal bioethics scholar [[Jacob M. Appel]] to call her "the bravest politician in America."<ref name="When Infanticide Isn't Murder"/>

==Prevention==

Since infanticide, especially neonaticide, is often a response to an unwanted birth,<ref name=Marks2009/> preventing [[unwanted pregnancies]] through improved [[sex education]] and increased [[birth control|contraceptive]] access are advocated as ways of preventing infanticide.<ref name=Friedman2009>{{cite journal |author=Friedman SH, Resnick PJ |title=Neonaticide: Phenomenology and considerations for prevention |journal=Int J Law Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19064290 |doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2008.11.006 |url=}}</ref>  Increased use of contraceptives and access to safe legal abortions<ref name="Hardness" /><ref name=Paul/><!-- page 122-123 --> have greatly reduced neonaticide in many developed nations.

Screening for psychiatric disorders or risk factors, and providing treatment or assistance to those at risk may help prevent infanticide.<ref name=FriedmanDepress>{{cite journal |author=Friedman SH, Resnick PJ |title=Postpartum depression: an update |journal=Women's Health (Lond Engl) |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=287–95 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19392614 |doi=10.2217/whe.09.3 |url=}}</ref>  However in developed world significant proportions of neonaticides that are detected occur in young women who deny their pregnancy, and avoid outside contacts, so they may have limited contact with health care services.<ref name=Marks2009/>

In some areas [[baby hatch]]es, safe places for a mother to anonymously leave an infant, are offered, in part to reduce the rate of infanticide.  In other places, like the United States, [[safe-haven law]]s allow mothers to anonymously give infants to designated officials.  Typically such babies are put up for adoption, or cared for in orphanages.

Granting women employment raises their status and autonomy. Having a [[gainful employment]] can raise the perceived worth of females. This can lead to an increase in the number of women getting an education and a decrease in the number of female infanticide. As a result, the [[infant mortality]] rate will decrease and economic development will increase.<ref name="Fuse">{{cite journal|last=Fuse|first=K|coauthors=Crenshaw, E.M|title=Gender imbalance in infant mortality: A cross-national study of social structure and female infanticide|journal=Social Science & Medicine|year=2006|volume=62|pages=360–374}}</ref>

Although human infanticide has been widely studied, the practice has been observed in many other species of the [[animal]] kingdom since it was first seriously studied by [[:jp:杉山幸丸|Yukimaru Sugiyama]].<ref>Sugiyama, Y. (1965) On the social change of Hanuman langurs (''Presbytis entellus'') in their natural conditions. ''Primates'' '''6''':381-417.</ref> These include from microscopic [[rotifer]]s and [[insect]]s, to [[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, including primates such as [[chacma baboon]]s.<ref name="Hoogland">Hoogland, J. L. (1985) Infanticide in Prairie Dogs: Lactating Females Kill Offspring of Close Kin ''Science'' '''230''':1037-1040.</ref> Infanticide can be practiced by both [[male]]s and [[female]]s.
