==Controversy==

===Lack of classification in DSM===

Excited delirium is not found in the current version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''. Eric Balaban of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] argued in 2007 that excited delirium was not recognized by the [[American Medical Association]] or the [[American Psychological Association]] and that the diagnosis served "as a means of white-washing what may be excessive use of force and inappropriate use of control techniques by officers during an arrest."<ref name=NPR1/> Melissa Smith of the American Medical Association stated in 2007 that the organization had "no official policy" on the condition.<ref name=abc/>. 

However the term "excited delirium" has been accepted by the [[National Association of Medical Examiners]] and the [[American College of Emergency Physicians]], who argued in a 2009 [[white paper]] that "excited delirium" may be described by several codes within the [[ICD-9]].<ref name="ACEP white paper"/>

===Use to exonerate police restraint and TASER use===

Some civil-rights groups argue that excited delirium diagnoses are being used to absolve law enforcement of guilt in cases where alleged excessive force may have contributed to patient deaths.<ref name=Truscott>{{cite journal |author=Truscott A |title=A knee in the neck of excited delirium |journal=CMAJ |volume=178 |issue=6 |pages=669–70 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18332375 |pmc=2263095 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.080210}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Paquette M |title=Excited delirium: does it exist? |journal=Perspect Psychiatr Care |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=93–4 |year=2003 |pmid=14606228 |doi= |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0031-5990&date=2003&volume=39&issue=3&spage=93}}</ref><ref name=LATimes>[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/21/health/he-delirium21 "'Excited delirium' as a cause of death"], Daniel Costello, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 21, 2003</ref> In 2003, the [[NAACP]] argued that excited delirium is used to explain the deaths of [[minorities]] more often than [[whites]].<ref name=LATimes/>

In [[Canada]], the 2007 case of [[Robert Dziekanski]] received national attention and placed a spotlight on the use of tasers in police actions and the diagnosis of excited delirium. Police psychologist Mike Webster testified at a [[British Columbia]] inquiry into taser deaths that police have been "brainwashed" by [[Taser International]] to justify "ridiculously inappropriate" use of the electronic weapon. He called "excited delirium" a "dubious disorder" used by Taser International in its training of police.<ref name=Hall>{{cite news | last = Hall | first = Neil | title = Police are 'brainwashed' by Taser maker; Psychologist blames instructions | work = [[Vancouver Sun]] | pages = A1 | publisher = Canwest | date = 2008-05-14 | url = http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=28218a80-11db-47a3-baf9-90b7dc2618aa | accessdate = 2008-08-30}}</ref> In a 2008 report entitled ''An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police'', the authors argued that excited delirium should not be included in the operational manual for the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] without formal approval after consultation with a mental-health-policy advisory body.<ref>[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ccaps-spcca/cew-ai/kiedrowski-report-rapport-eng.htm "An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police"], John Kiedrowski, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], June 5, 2008</ref>

A 2010 [[systematic review]] published in the ''Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine'' argued that the symptoms associated with excited delirium likely posed a far greater medical risk than the use of tasers, and that it seems unlikely that taser use significantly exacerbates the symptoms of excited delirium.<ref name=Jauchem>{{cite journal |author=Jauchem JR |title=Deaths in custody: are some due to electronic control devices (including TASER devices) or excited delirium? |journal=J Forensic Leg Med |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20083043 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.05.011 |url=}}</ref>
