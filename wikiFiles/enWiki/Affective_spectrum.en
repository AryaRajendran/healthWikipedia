The '''affective spectrum''' is a grouping of related [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] and [[medicine|medical]] disorders which may accompany [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]], [[unipolar depression|unipolar]], and [[schizoaffective disorder]]s at statistically higher rates than would normally be expected.  These disorders are identified by a common positive response to the same types of pharmacologic treatments. They also aggregate strongly in families and may therefore share common heritable underlying physiologic anomalies.
 
Affective spectrum disorders include:
