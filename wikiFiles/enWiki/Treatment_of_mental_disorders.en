Mental disorders are classified as a psychological condition marked primarily by sufficient disorganization of personality, mind, and emotions to seriously impair the normal psychological and often social functioning of the individual. Individuals diagnosed with mental disorders are typically deemed unable to function in society. Mental disorders occasionally consist of a combination of affective, behavioral, cognitive and perceptual components. The acknowledgement and understanding of mental health conditions has changed over time and across cultures, and there are still variations in the definition, classification, and treatment of mental disorders.

==History==
The history of treatment of mental disorders consist in a development through years in both psychotherapy (Cognitive therapy, Behavior therapy, Group Therapy, and ECT) and psychopharmacology (drugs used in mental disorders). Psychotherapy is a relatively new method used in treatment of mental disorders. The practice of individual psychotherapy as a treatment of mental disorders is about 100 years old. Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) was the first one to introduce this concept in psychoanalysis. Cognitive therapy is a more recent therapy that was founded by Aaron T. Beck ( born in 1921), an American psychiatrist. It is a more systematic and structured part of psychotherapy. It consist in helping the patient learn effective ways to overcome their problems and difficulties that causes them distress. Behavior therapy has its roots in experimental psychology. E.L Thorndike and B.F Skinner were among the first to work on behavior therapy. Convulsive therapy was introduced by Ladislas Meduna in 1934. He induced seizures, by using pentetrazol, as a way to reduce depression. Meanwhile in Italy, Ugo Cerletti substituted metrazol (which was used in Convulsive theory) with electricity. Because of this substitution the new theory was called Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT). Beside psychotherapy, a wide range of medication is used in the treatment of mental disorders. The first drugs used for this purpose were extracted from plants with psychoactive properties. Louis Lewin, in 1924, was the first one to introduce a classification of drugs and plants that had these kind of properties. The history of the medications used in mental disorders has developed a lot through years. The discovery of modern drugs prevailed during the 19th century.. Lithium was discovered as a treatment of mania, by John F. Cade in 1949, "and Hammond (1871) used lithium bromide for 'acute mania with depression'".<ref name=bjp>http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/161/2/279.full.pdf+html</ref> In 1937, Daniel Bovet and Anne-Marie Staub discovered the first antihistamine (Neuroleptic). In 1950 the Paul Charpentier synthesized chlorpromazine (Neuroleptic). Different perspectives on the causes of psychological disorders arose including some that stated that psychological disorders are caused by specific abnormalities of the brain and nervous system and that is, in principle, they should be approached for treatments in the same way as physical illness (arose from Hippocrates's ideas).<ref>{{cite book|last=R.

==Influences==
There are numerous numbers of individuals who have influenced the treatment of modern mental disorders. One of the most important doctors was the "Father of American Psychiatry", Benjamin Rush. Benjamin Rush (1746–1813) was considered the Father of American Psychiatry for his many works in the mental field of study. He published several books on the matter. He also tried to classify different types of mental disorders, he theorized about their causes, and tried to find possible cures for them. Rush believed that mental disorders were caused by poor blood circulation, though he was wrong. He also described Savant Syndrome and had an approach to addictions.

Other important early pychiatrists include [[George Parkman]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], [[George A. Zeller]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Leo Kanner]], and [[Peter Breggin]]. George Parkman (1790–1849) got his medical degree at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. He was influenced by [[Benjamin Rush]], who inspired him to take interest in the state asylums. He trained at the Parisian Asylum. Parkman wrote several papers on treatment for the mentally ill. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.(1809–1894) was an American Physician who wrote many famous writings on medical treatments. George H. Zeller (1858–1938) was famous for his way of treating the mentally ill. He believed they should be treated like people and did so in a caring manner. He banned narcotics, mechanical restraints, and imprisonment while he was in charge at Peoria State Asylum. Peter Breggin (1939–present) disagrees with the practices of harsh psychiatry such as electroconvulsive therapy.

==Psychotherapy==
A common form of treatment for many mental disorders is [[psychotherapy]]. Psychotherapy is an interpersonal intervention, usually provided by a [[mental health professional]] such as a clinical psychologist, that employs any of a range of specific psychological techniques. There are several main types. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is used for a wide variety of disorders, based on modifying the patterns of thought and behavior associated with a particular disorder. There are various kinds of CBT therapy, and offshoots such as [[dialectical behavior therapy]]. [[Psychoanalysis]], addressing underlying psychic conflicts and defenses, has been a dominant school of psychotherapy and is still in use. [[Systemic therapy]] or [[family therapy]] is sometimes used, addressing a network of relationships as well as individuals themselves. Some psychotherapies are based on a [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approach. Some therapies are for a specific disorder only, for example [[interpersonal and social rhythm therapy]]. Mental health professionals often pick and choose techniques, employing an [[integrative psychotherapy|eclectic or integrative approach]] tailored to a particular disorder and individual. Much may depend on the [[therapeutic relationship]], and there may be issues of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[confidentiality]] and [[engagement]].

To regulate the potentially powerful influences of therapies, psychologists hold themselves to a set of ethical standers for the treatment of people with mental disorders, written by the [[American Psychological Association]]. These ethical standards include:<ref>Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., & Wegner, D. M. (2010). Psychology. (2nd ed., p. 620). New York: Worth Pub.</ref>
*Striving to benefit clients and taking care to do no harm; 
*Establishing relationships of trust with clients; 
*Promoting accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness; 
*Seeking fairness in treatment and taking precautions to avoid biases; 
*Respecting the dignity and worth of all people.

==Medication==
[[Psychiatric medication]] is also widely used to treat mental disorders. These are licenced [[psychoactive]] drugs usually [[prescription medication|prescribed]] by a [[psychiatrist]] or family doctor. There are several main groups. [[Antidepressants]] are used for the treatment of [[clinical depression]] as well as often for anxiety and other disorders. [[Anxiolytics]] are used, generally shorter-term, for anxiety disorders and related problems such as physical symptoms and insomnia. [[Mood stabilizers]] are used primarily in [[bipolar disorder]], mainly targeting [[mania]] rather than depression. [[Antipsychotics]] are used for [[psychotic disorder]]s, notably in [[schizophrenia]]. [[Stimulants]] are commonly used, notably for [[ADHD]].

Despite the different conventional names of the drug groups, there can be considerable overlap in the kinds of disorders for which they are actually indicated. There may also be [[off-label use]]. There can be problems with [[adverse effects]] and [[compliance (medicine)|adherence]].

===Antipsychotics===
The addition of atypical antipsychotics in cases of inadequate response to antidepressant therapy is an increasingly popular strategy that is well supported in the literature,3 though these medications may result in greater discontinuation due to adverse events. Aripiprazole was the first drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for adjunctive treatment of MDD in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy in the current episode. Recommended doses of aripiprazole range from 2&nbsp;mg/d to 15&nbsp;mg/d based on 2 large, multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies,4,5 which were later supported by a third large trial.6

Pencina, PhD; Sean Ward, MBA; Mark H. Pollack, MD; and Maurizio Fava, MD|title=Efficacy of Dose Increase Among Nonresponders to Low-Dose Aripiprazole Augmentation in Patients With Inadequate Response to Antidepressant Treatment: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Efficacy Trial|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=2011-10-02|pages=1|doi=10.4088/JCP.10m06541|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/article_wrapper.asp?art=oap/10m06541/10m06541.htm|accessdate=2011-10-10}}</ref>
Most conventional antipsychotics, such as the phenothiazines, work by blocking the D2 Dopamine receptors. Atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine block both the D2 Dopamine receptors as well as 5HT2A serotonin receptors. Atypical antipsychotics are favored over conventional antipsychotics because they reduce the prevalence of pseudoparkinsonism which causes tremors and muscular rigidity similar to Parkinson’s disease. The most severe side effect of antipsychotics is agranulocytosis, a depression of white blood cell count with unknown cause, and some patients may also experience photosensitivity.

===Antidepressants===
Early antidepressants were discovered through research on treating tuberculosis and yielded the class of antidepressants known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO). Only two MAO inhibitors remain on the market in the United States because they alter the metabolism of the dietary amino acid tyramine which can lead to a hypertensive crisis. Research on improving phenothiazine antipsychotics led to the development of tricyclic antidepressants which inhibit synaptic uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Later research on this class of antidepressants focused mostly on the effects of norepinephrine. These drugs share many similarities with the tricyclic antidepressants but are more selective in their action. The greatest risk of the SSRIs is an increase in violent and suicidal behavior, particularly in children and adolescents. In 2003 antidepressant sales worldwide totaled $15 billion USD and as of 2006 antidepressants accounted of seven of the 100 most prescribed drugs.

==Other==
Electroconvulsive therapy (known as [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]]) is used, for example in prolonged mood disorder unresponsive to other interventions. [[Psychosurgery]], including [[deep brain stimulation]], is another available treatment for some disorders.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Creative therapies are sometimes used, including [[music therapy]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crawford |first=Mike J.|coauthors=Talwar, Nakul|year=2006|title=Music therapy for in-patients with schizophrenia: Exploratory randomised controlled trial|journal=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] (2006)|volume=189|pages=405–9|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/189/5/405|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.105.015073|quote=Music therapy may provide a means of improving mental health among people with schizophrenia, but its effects in acute psychoses have not been explored|pmid=17077429|display-authors=1|first1=N.|issue=5}}</ref> [[art therapy]] or [[drama therapy]].

Lifestyle adjustments and supportive measures are often used, including [[peer support]], [[self-help]] and supported [[house|housing]] or [[employment]]. Some advocate [[dietary supplements]]. Many things have been found to help at least some people. A [[placebo]] effect may play a role.

==Services==
{{main|Services for mental disorders}}
Often an individual may engage in different treatment modalities and use various mental health services. These may be under [[case management (mental health)|case management]] (sometimes referred to as "service coordination"), use inpatient or [[partial hospitalization|day treatment]], utilize a [[Clubhouse Model of Psychosocial Rehabilitation|psychosocial rehabilitation]] program, and/or take part in an [[Assertive Community Treatment]] program. Providing optimal treatments earlier in the course of a mental health disorder may prevent further relapses and ongoing disability and has led to a new [[early intervention in psychosis]] service approach for psychosis.

Mental health services may be based in hospitals, clinics or the community.

Some approaches are based on a [[psychosocial recovery|recovery model]] of mental disorder, and may focus on challenging [[social stigma|stigma]] and [[social exclusion]] and creating empowerment and hope.<ref>Repper, J. & Perkins, R. (2006) ''Social Inclusion and Recovery: A Model for Mental Health Practice.'' Bailliere Tindall, UK. ISBN 0-7020-2601-8</ref>

In America, half of people with severe symptoms of a mental health condition were found to have received no treatment in the prior 12 months.<ref>America's [[Mental Health Survey]], National Mental Health Association, 2001.</ref>

Fear of disclosure, rejection by friends, and ultimately discrimination are a few reasons why people with mental health conditions often don't seek help.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
