In [[electrocardiography]], the '''T wave''' represents the [[repolarization]] (or recovery) of the [[Ventricular system|ventricle]]s. The interval from the beginning of the [[QRS complex]] to the apex of the T wave is referred to as the '''absolute [[refractory period]]'''. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the '''relative [[refractory period]]''' (or vulnerable period). The T wave contains more information than the [[QT interval]]. The T wave can be described by its symmetry, skewness, slope of ascending and descending limbs, amplitude and subintervals like the T<sub>peak</sub>–T<sub>end</sub> interval.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reference values of electrocardiogram repolarization variables in a healthy population |year=2010|author=Haarmark C, Graff C, Andersen MP, et al.|journal=Journal of Electrocardiology|volume=43 |pages=31–9 |issue=1 |pmid=19740481}}</ref>

In most leads, the T wave is positive. This is due to the repolarization of the membrane. During ventricle contraction (QRS wave), the heart hyperpolarizes to a point at which contraction is no longer possible. Through the action of the Na+/K+ pump, the heart muscle is repolarized to a state receptive to further conduction. This is why the T wave is positive; although the cell remains in a negatively charged state, the net effect is in the positive direction, and the ECG reports this as a positive spike. However, a negative T wave is normal in lead aVR. Lead V1 may have a positive, negative, or biphasic (positive followed by negative, or vice versa) T wave. In addition, it is not uncommon to have an isolated negative T wave in lead III, aVL, or aVF.

==Clinical significance==

* T-wave inversion (negative T waves) can be a sign of [[ischemic heart disease|coronary ischemia]], [[Wellens' syndrome]], [[left ventricular hypertrophy]], or [[central nervous system|CNS]] disorder.
* A periodic beat-to-beat variation in the amplitude or shape of the T wave may be termed [[T wave alternans]].
* Tall and narrow ("peaked" or "tented") symmetrical T waves may indicate [[hyperkalemia]].<ref>http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/internalmed/nephro/webpages/Part_D.htm</reF>
* Flat T waves (less than 1 mV in the limb leads and less than 2 mV in the precordial leads)<ref name=meddean/> may indicate [[coronary ischemia]] or [[hypokalemia]]<ref name=meddean>[http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/MEDICINE/skills/ekg/les1prnt.htm Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. > EKG Interpretive skills] Retrieved on April 22, 2010</ref>
* The earliest [[Electrocardiography in myocardial infarction|electrocardiographic finding of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) acute myocardial infarction]] is sometimes the '''hyperacute T wave''', which can be distinguished from [[hyperkalemia]] by the broad base and slight asymmetry. This may also be seen in [[Prinzmetal angina]].
* When a [[bundle branch block]] is present, the T wave should be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. This is known as '''appropriate T wave discordance'''.
