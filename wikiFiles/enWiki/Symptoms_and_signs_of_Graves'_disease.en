Virtually all the '''symptoms and signs of Graves' disease''' result from the direct and indirect effects of [[hyperthyroidism]], with exceptions being [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]], [[goitre]] and [[pretibial myxedema]] (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of Graves' disease). These clinical manifestations are dramatic and involve virtually every system in the body. The mechanisms that mediate these effects are not well-understood. The severity of the symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism is related to the duration of the disease, the magnitude of the thyroid hormone excess, and the patient's age. There is also significant variability in the individual response to hyperthyroidism and individual sensitivity to thyroid hormone fluctuations generally.<ref name="MyThyroid">{{Cite web|author=Druckerhttp D |title=Hyperthyroidism |url=http://www.mythyroid.com/hyperthyroidism.html |work=MyThyroid.com |year=2005 |accessdate=2010-05-03}}</ref> On top of that, Graves' disease patients can undergo periods of ''hypo''thyroidism (for further information, see [[hypothyroidism#Symptoms|symptoms of hypothyroidism]]): finding the right dosage of thyroid hormone suppression and/or supplementation can be difficult and takes time. The body's need for thyroid hormone can also change over time, like in the first months after radioactive iodine treatment (RAI). Thyroid autoimmune diseases can also be volatile: hyperthyroidism can interchange with hypothyroidism and euthyroidism.<ref name="ReferenceB">Psychische stoornissen bij endocriene zieken, 1983, C. van der Meer en W. van Tilburg (red.)</ref>

==General symptoms and signs==
* [[Goitre]] (enlarged thyroid). If the thyroid grows large enough, it may compress the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]], producing [[vocal cord paralysis]], [[dysphonia]], and even respiratory [[stridor]]. Compression of the [[sympathetic chain]] may result in [[Horner's syndrome]].<ref>Surgical management of multinodular goiter with compression symptoms.

* [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]] (protrusion of one or both eyes)
* [[Pretibial myxedema]] (lumpy, reddish skin of the lower legs)

* Cardiovascular features may include [[hypertension]], and heart rate that may be [[Tachycardia|rapid]] or [[Arrhythmia|irregular in character]]; these may be perceived as [[palpitations]].<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot">Graves' Disease and the Manifestations of Thyrotoxicosis - Leslie l. De Groot, Thyroid Disease Manager, Chapter 10 (http://www.thyroidmanager.org/Chapter10/10-frame.htm)</ref> Less common findings include [[left ventricular hypertrophy]], premature atrial and ventricular contractions, [[atrial fibrillation]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[angina]], [[myocardial infarction]], systemic embolization, death from [[Circulatory collapse|cardiovascular collapse]] and resistance to some drug effects ([[digoxin]], [[coumadin]]).<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>
* [[Hyperreflexia]], with a rapid relaxation phase.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>
* A distinctly excessive reaction to all sorts of stimuli.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>
* A marked increase in [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigability]], or [[asthenia]], is often prominent. This increased weariness may be combined with [[hyperactivity]]; patients remark that they are impelled to incessant activity, which, however, causes great fatigue.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>
* [[Insomnia]]<ref>A survey study of neuropsychiatric complaints in patients with Graves' disease. Stern RA, Robinson B, Thorner AR, Arruda JE, Prohaska ML, Prange AJ Jr, J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci. 1996;8(2):181.</ref>

* [[Polyphagia|Increased appetite]].<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>
* [[Weakness]] or [[muscle weakness]] (especially in the large muscles of the arms and legs).

==Effects on skeleton==
Overt hyperthyroidism is associated with accelerated [[bone remodeling]] (resulting in increased porosity of [[cortical bone]] and reduced volume of [[trabecular bone]]), a generally reduced [[bone density]], [[osteoporosis]], and an increase in [[Bone fracture|fracture]] rate. The changes in bone metabolism are connected with negative [[Bone#Calcium balance|calcium balance]], an increased excretion of [[Calcium in biology|calcium]] and [[Phosphorus#Biological role|phosphorus]] in the urine ([[hypercalciuria]]) and stool, and, rarely, [[hypercalcemia]].<ref name="medicinenet"/> In hyperthyroidism, the normal cycle duration of [[bone resorption]] of approximately 200 days is halved, and each cycle is associated with a 9.6 percent loss of mineralized [[Mineralized tissues#Bone|bone]]. In ''hypo''thyroidism, cycle length approximates 700 days and is associated with a 17 percent increase in mineralized bone.<ref>Normal and pathological remodeling of human trabecular bone: three dimensional reconstruction of the remodeling sequence in normals and in metabolic bone disease. Eriksen EF, Endocr Rev. 1986;7(4):379.</ref>

The extent of the reduction in bone density in most studies is 10-20%. The clinical manifestations on bone differ depending on the age of the patient. [[menopause#Postmenopause|Postmenopausal woman]] are most sensitive to accelerated bone loss from thyrotoxicosis. Accelerated bone growth in growing children can increase [[ossification]] in the short term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights.

With the introduction of antithyroid drugs and radioiodine in the 1940s, clinically apparent hyperthyroid bone disease became less common. However, bone density measurements have demonstrated that bone loss is common in patients with overt hyperthyroidism and, to a lesser extent, in those with subclinical hyperthyroidism. A history of overt hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for [[hip fracture]] later in life, which in turn is one of the causes of excess late mortality in previously hyperthyroid patients. It is therefore reasonable to assume that in some hyperthyroid patients bone density does not completely return to normal after antithyroid treatment.

However, if the thyrotoxicosis is treated early, bone loss can be minimized.<ref name="medicinenet"/> The level of calcium in the blood can be determined by a simple blood test, and a [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry|bone density scan]] can document the amount of bone loss. There are many medications that can help to rebuild bone mass and to prevent further bone loss.<ref name="medicinenet"/> [[Risedronate]] treatment has been demonstrated to help restore bone mass in [[osteopenia]]/[[osteoporosis]] associated with Graves’ disease.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch11-Groot">Chapter 11. Diagnosis and Treatment of Graves’ Disease Leslie J. De Groot, MD Professor of Medicine - http://www.thyroidmanager.org/Chapter11/chapter11.html Updated: March 5, 2008</ref> Nevertheless, weight-bearing [[exercises]], a [[balanced diet]], calcium intake of about 1500&nbsp;mg a day and enough [[vitamin D]], are of course elementary foundations.<ref name="medicinenet"/>

==Eye symptoms==
Hyperthyroidism almost always causes general eye symptoms like dryness and irritation, regardless of what the cause of the hyperthyroid state is. However, these need to be distuingished from [[Graves' ophthalmopathy]], which can only occur in patients who have Graves' disease. (It may also, rarely, be seen in [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], primary [[hypothyroidism]], and [[thyroid cancer]]).

About 20-25% of patients with Graves' disease will suffer from clinically obvious Graves' ophthalmopathy, and not just from the eye signs of hyperthyroidism. Only 3 to 5% will develop severe ophthalmopathy.<ref>Graves’ ophthalmopathy: a preventable disease? Luigi Bartalena, Claudio Marcocci and Aldo Pinchera1 - European Journal of Endocrinology (2002) 146 457–461</ref> However, when subjected to closer inspection (e.g. by [[magnetic resonance imaging]] of the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]]) many more patients have evidence of ophthalmopathy. It is estimated that for every 100,000 persons, 16 women and 3 men have Graves' ophthalmopathy every year.<ref>The incidence of Graves' ophthalmopathy in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Bartley GB, Fatourechi V, Kadrmas EF, Jacobsen SJ, [[Duane Ilstrup|Ilstrup DM]], Garrity JA, Gorman CA, Am J Ophthalmol. 1995;120(4):511.</ref>

Although it is true that in most patients ophthalmopathy, goiter, and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis appear more or less coincidentally, it is also true that in certain cases eye signs may appear long before thyrotoxicosis is evident, or become worse when the thyrotoxicosis is subsiding or has been controlled by treatment.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/> In approximately 20% of ophthalmopathy patients, ophthalmopathy appears before the onset of hyperthyroidism, in about 40% concurrently, and in about 20% in the six months after diagnosis.<ref>Chronology of Graves' ophthalmopathy in an incidence cohort. Bartley GB, Fatourechi V, Kadrmas EF, Jacobsen SJ, Ilstrup DM, Garrity JA, Gorman CA, Am J Ophthalmol. 1996;121(4):426.</ref> In the remainder, the eye disease first becomes apparent after treatment of the hyperthyroidism, more often in patients treated with radioiodine.<ref>Occurrence of ophthalmopathy after treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism. The Thyroid Study Group. Tallstedt L, Lundell G, Tørring O, Wallin G, Ljunggren JG, Blomgren H, Taube A, N Engl J Med. 1992;326(26):1733.</ref>

It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between eye symptoms due to hyperthyroidism and those due to Graves' antibodies, not in the least because the two often occur coincidently. What can make things particularly difficult, is that many patients with hyperthyroidism have lid retraction, which leads to stare and lid lag (due to contraction of the [[levator palpebrae]] muscles of the eyelids). This stare may then give the ''appearance'' of protruding eyeballs ([[proptosis]]), when none in fact exists. This subsides when the hyperthyroidism is treated.

===Due to Graves' ophthalmopathy===
{{Main|Graves' ophthalmopathy}}[[Image:Proptosis and lid retraction from Graves' Disease.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Photo showing the classic finding of proptosis and lid retraction in Graves' disease]]
Graves' ophthalmopathy is characterized by inflammation of the [[extraocular muscles]], orbital fat and connective tissue. It results in the following signs, which can be extremely distressing to the patient:<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>
* Most frequent are symptoms due to [[conjunctival]] or [[cornea]]l irritation: burning, [[photophobia]], tearing, pain, and a gritty or sandy sensation.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>
* Protruding eyeballs (known as [[proptosis]] and [[exophthalmos]]).
* [[Diplopia]] (double vision) is common.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>
* Limitation of eye movement (due to impairment of [[eye muscle]] function).
* Periorbital and conjunctival [[edema]] (accumulation of fluid beneath the skin around the eyes).
* In severe cases, the [[optic nerve]] may be compressed and acuity of vision impaired.<ref name="pmid19547630">{{Cite journal|author=Ponto KA, Pitz S, Pfeiffer N, Hommel G, Weber MM, Kahaly GJ |title=Quality of life and occupational disability in endocrine orbitopathy |journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int |volume=106 |issue=17 |pages=283–9 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19547630 |pmc=2689575 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2009.0283 |url= |doi_brokendate=2010-08-28}}</ref>
* Occasionally [[loss of vision]].

===Due to hyperthyroidism===
In the absence of Graves' ophthalmopathy, patients may demonstrate other ophthalmic symptoms and signs due to hyperthyroidism:

* Dry eyes (due to loss of corneal moisture).<ref name="pmid19547630"/>
* A sense of irritation, discomfort, or pain in the eyes.
* A tingling sensation behind the eyes or the feeling of grit or sand in the eyes.
* Excessive tearing that is often made worse by exposure to cold air, wind, or bright lights.
* Swelling or redness of the eyes.
* Stare
* Lid lag ([[Von Graefe's sign]])
* [[Sensitivity to light]]
* Blurring of vision
* Widened [[palpebral fissures]]
* Infrequent blinking
* The appearance of lid retraction.

==Neuropsychological manifestations==

Treatment of hyperthyroidism typically leads to improvement in cognitive and behavioral impairments.<ref name="pmid17097812"/> Agitation, inattention, and frontal lobe impairment may improve more rapidly than other cognitive functions. However, several studies confirm that a substantial proportion of patients with hyperthyroidism have psychiatric disorders or mental symptoms and decreased quality of life even after successful treatment of their hyperthyroidism.<ref name="pmid9081554"/>

===Effects on pre-existing psychiatric disorders===
Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, will experience a worsening of their usual symptoms, as observed by several studies. A study of 1999 found that Graves' disease exacerbated the symptoms of [[Tourette's disorder]] and [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), and points out that the lack of diagnosis of the Graves' disease compromised the efficacy of the treatment of these disorders.<ref name="pmid10405504">{{Cite journal|author=Woolston JL, Caracansi A |title=Case study: missed diagnosis and mistreatment of unrecognized comorbid Graves disease |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=861–4 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10405504 |doi= 10.1097/00004583-199907000-00016|url=}}</ref> Patients who are known to have a convulsive disorder may become more difficult to control with the usual medications, and seizures may appear in patients who have never previously manifested such symptoms.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>

==Subclinical hyperthyroidism==
In subclinical hyperthyroidism, serum TSH is abnormally low, but T4- and T3-levels fall within laboratory reference ranges.<ref>Narrow Individual Variations in Serum T4 and T3 in Normal Subjects: A Clue to the Understanding of Subclinical Thyroid Disease Stig Andersen, Klaus Michael Pedersen, Niels Henrik Bruun and Peter Laurberg - The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 2007, Vol. 87, No. 3 1068-1072</ref> It primarily affects the [[skeleton]] and the cardiovascular system (abnormalities in other systems have also been reported), in a similar but less severe and less frequent way than overt hyperthyroidism does. It can alter cardiac function, with [[increased heart rate]], increased [[left ventricular]] mass index, increased [[cardiac contractility]], [[diastolic dysfunction]], and induction of [[arrhythmias|ectopic atrial beats]]. Long-term mild excess of thyroid hormone can thus cause impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/> In a large population-based study of 2008, the odds of having poorer [[cognitive function]] were greater for subclinical hyperthyroidism than for [[stroke]], [[diabetes mellitus]], and [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name="pmid19054181">{{Cite journal|author=Ceresini G |title=Thyroid function abnormalities and cognitive impairment in elderly people: results of the Invecchiare in Chianti study |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=89–93 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19054181 |pmc=2631617 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.02080.x |url=|author-separator=,|author2=Lauretani F|author3=Maggio M|display-authors=3|last4=Ceda|first4=Gian Paolo|last5=Morganti|first5=Simonetta|last6=Usberti|first6=Elisa|last7=Chezzi|first7=Carlo|last8=Valcavi|first8=Rita|last9=Bandinelli|first9=Stefania}}</ref> 

A possible explanation for the mental symptoms of subclinical thyroid disease, might be found in the fact that the brain has among the highest expression of THR's, and that neurons are often more sensitive than other tissues to thyroid abnormalities, including sublicnical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1210/mend-3-2-392 | last1 = Sakurai | first1 = A | author-separator =, | last2 = Nakai | author-name-separator=  | first2 = A| year = 1989 | last3 = Degroot | first3 = LJ | title = Expression of three forms of thyroid hormone receptor in human tissues | url = | journal = Mol Endocrinol | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 392–9 | pmid = 2710139 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shahrara | first1 = S | last2 = Drvota | first2 = V | last3 = Sylven | first3 = C. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1999 | title = Organ specific expression of thyroid hormone receptor mRNA and protein in different human tissues | url = | journal = Biol Pharm Bull | volume = 22 | issue = 10| pages = 1027–33 | pmid = 10549850 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.22.1027 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Geracioti | first1 = TD Jr | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2006 | title = How to identify hypothyroidism's psychiatric presentations | url = | journal = Current Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 11| pages = 98–117 }}</ref> In a 1996 survey study respondents reported a significant decline in memory, attention, planning, and overall productivity from the period 2 years prior to Graves' symptoms onset to the period when hyperthyroid.<ref name="pmid9081554"/> Also, hypersensitivity of the [[central nervous system]] to low-grade hyperthyroidism can result in an [[anxiety disorder]] before other Graves’ disease symptoms emerge. E.g., [[panic disorder]] has been reported to precede Graves’ hyperthyroidism by 4 to 5 years in some cases, although it is not known how frequently this occurs.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000289088 | last1 = Matsubayashi | first1 = S | last2 = Tamai | first2 = H | last3 = Matsumoto | first3 = Y | author-separator =, | author-name-separator=  | last4 = Tamagawa| year = 1996 | first4 = K | last5 = Mukuta | first5 = T | last6 = Morita | first6 = T | last7 = Kubo | first7 = C | title = Graves' disease after the onset of panic disorder | url = | journal = Psychother Psychosom | volume = 65 | issue = 5| pages = 277–80 | pmid = 8893330 }}</ref>

However, while clinical hyperthyroidism is associated with frank [[Graves' disease#Neuropsychological manifestations|neuropsychological and affective alterations]], the occurrence of these alterations and their treatment in mild and subclinical hyperthyroidism remains a controversial issue.<ref name="pmid15180808">{{Cite journal|author=Bono G, Fancellu R, Blandini F, Santoro G, Mauri M |title=Cognitive and affective status in mild hypothyroidism and interactions with L-thyroxine treatment |journal=Acta Neurol.

==Children and adolescents==
Hyperthyroidism has unique effects in children on growth and pubertal development, e.g. causing [[Epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal]] maturation. In growing children, accelerated bone growth from hyperthyroidism can increase [[osteogenesis]] in the short term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights. Pubertal development tends to be delayed, or slowed. Girls who have undergone [[menarche]] may develop secondary [[amenorrhea]]. Hyperthyroidism is associated with high sex hormone-binding globulin ([[SHBG]]), which may result in high serum [[estradiol]] levels in girls and [[testosterone]] levels in boys. However, unbound or free levels of these hormones are decreased. Hyperthyroidism before the age of four may cause neurodevelopmental delay. A study by Segni et al. suggests that permanent [[brain damage]] can occur as a result of the illness.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/><ref>{{Cite journal| author = Segni M, Leonardi E, Mazzoncini B, Pucarelli I, Pasquino AM | title = Special features of Graves' disease in early childhood | journal = Thyroid | volume = 9 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10524565 | issue = 9| pages = 871–7|doi=10.1089/thy.1999.9.871}}</ref>

Ophthalmopatic findings are more common but less severe in children (severe infiltrative exophthalmos is virtually unknown before mid-adolescence), but besides that, many of the typical clinical features of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents are similar to those in adults.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/> An important difference between children and adults with Graves' disease, is that children have not yet developed like adults have (psychological and physiological), and that they are a lot more dependent on their environment. The [[encephalopathy]] will have profound effects on children's developing personalities and developing relationship with their environment. Disturbments in bodily development further complicates matters. The consequences for the development and the somatic and psychological wellbeing of the child can be very radical and sometimes irreversible. The earlier a person is affected by thyroid disease, the more the development of personality is affected and the bigger the delay from their potential development level. The child gets behind in its cognitive, emotional and sexual growth, which, by itself, also influences its processing abilities of the endocrine disease.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Children with hyperthyroidism tend to have greater [[mood swings]] and disturbances of behavior, as compared with adults. Their [[attention span]] decreases, they are usually hyperactive and distractible, they sleep poorly, and their school performance deteriorates. Because devastating personality and emotional changes often appear in the child or adolescent with Graves' disease, many hyperthyroid children are (similar to many adults) referred to a developmental specialist or child psychiatrist before the presence of hyperthyroidism is suspected.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/>

==Older patients==
In older patients, emotional instability may be less evident, or depression may occur, and the symptoms and signs are manifestly circulatory. In many, the thyroid is not readily palpable.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/> Symptoms such as [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]], [[Dyspnea|shortness of breath]] on exertion, and [[edema]] may predominate. Older patients also tend to have more weight loss and less of an increase in appetite. Thus [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] in this group is fairly frequent, as is [[constipation]].<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch10-Groot"/> Elderly patients may have what is called "apathetic thyrotoxicosis", a state in which they have less and less severe symptoms, except for weakness, [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[lethargy]] (making it even more prone to escape diagnosis).

==Graves' disease and work==
Considering the many signs and symptoms, the generally delayed diagnosis, and the possibility of residual complaints after treatment, it is little wonder that a significant number of people with Graves' disease have difficulty keeping their job. One study found that of 303 patients successfully treated for hyperthyroidism (77% had Graves’ disease) 53% dealt with lack of energy. About one-third were unable to resume their customary work, mainly due to persistent mental problems.<ref name="pmid17044727"/><ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0306-4530(99)00050-5 | title = Long-term residual complaints and psychosocial sequelae after remission of hyperthyroidism | author = Fahrenfort JJ, Wilterdink AM, van der Veen EA | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | year = 2000 | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–11 | pmid =10674283}}</ref> In their 1986 study of 26 patients (10 years after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism), Perrild et al. note that four patients had been granted [[disability pension]]s on the basis of intellectual dysfunction.<ref>{{Cite journal| title = Intellectual impairment after hyperthyroidism | author = Perrild H, Hansen JM, Arnung K, Olsen PZ, Danielsen U. | journal = Acta Endocrinol (Copenh) | year = 1986 | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–91 | pmid = 3739553}}</ref> Between 2006 and 2008, Ponto et al. surveyed 250 Graves' disease patients. Of these, 36% were written of sick and 5% even had to take [[Retirement#Early retirement|early retirement]].

A 2008 meta-article by De groot states that the patient with Graves' disease should have time away from normal duties to help in reestablishing his or her psychic and physiologic equilibria. Patients can and do recover with appropriate therapy while continuing to work, but more rapid and certain progress is made if a period away from the usual occupation can be provided.<ref name="ThyroidManager-Ch11-Groot"/>
