'''Craniosacral therapy''' ('''CST'''), or '''cranial-sacral therapy''', is an [[alternative medicine|alternative]] therapy used by [[occupational therapist]]s, [[physiotherapist]]s, [[massage therapist]]s, [[naturopath]]s, and [[chiropractor]]s. Craniosacral therapy was developed by Dr. John Upledger around 1983, and is loosely based on osteopathy in the cranial field (OCF), which was developed in 1899 by [[William Garner Sutherland]]. In the United States, OCF, or cranial osteopathy, as it is more commonly known, can only be practiced by fully licensed physicians (DOs, MDs and, in some states licensed naturopathic physicians, or NDs) and dentists. Cranial osteopathy is considered an extension of osteopathic medicine, and its training is therefore strictly regulated by the osteopathic medical profession and its governing bodies.<ref name="crislip">{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/alas-poor-craniosacral/ |title=Alas poor Craniosacral.

}}</ref> Medical research has concluded that there is no evidence for the therapy's effectiveness.<ref name="rev2012"/> However, research remains ongoing{{fact|date=March 2013}} to determine if mobility of the cranial bones exists and to determine if OCF can be shown to have any therapeutic applications.

== History and conceptual basis ==
Cranial Osteopathy was originated by [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopath]] [[William Garner Sutherland|William Sutherland]] (1873–1954) in 1898–1900. While looking at a disarticulated [[Human skull|skull]], Sutherland was struck by the idea that the [[cranial sutures]] of the [[temporal bone]]s where they meet the [[parietal bones]] were "beveled, like the [[gill]]s of a fish, indicating articular mobility for a [[respiratory system|respiratory]] mechanism.<ref name="Jakel"/>

From 1975 to 1983, osteopathic physician John E. Upledger and neurophysiologist and histologist [[Ernest W. Retzlaff]] worked at [[Michigan State University]] as clinical researchers and professors. They assembled a research team to investigate the purported pulse and further study Sutherland's theory of cranial bone movement. Upledger and Retzlaff went on to publish their results, which they interpreted as support for both the concept of cranial bone movement, and the concept of a cranial rhythm.<ref name="therapy6">{{cite journal | pmid = 7899490 | year = 1995 | last1 = Upledger | first1 = JE | title = Craniosacral therapy | volume = 75 | issue = 4 | pages = 328–30 | url=http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/75/4/328.long | journal = Physical therapy}}</ref><ref name="therapy7">{{cite journal | pmid = 659282 | year = 1978 | last1 = Upledger | first1 = JE | title = The relationship of craniosacral examination findings in grade school children with developmental problems | volume = 77 | issue = 10 | pages = 760–76 | journal =[[Journal of the American Osteopathic Association]]}}</ref><ref name="therapy8">{{cite journal | pmid =  582820 | year =  1979 | last1 =  Upledger | first1 =  JE | last2 =  Karni | first2 =  Z | title =  Mechano-electric patterns during craniosacral osteopathic diagnosis and treatment | volume =  78 | issue =  11 | pages =  782–91 | journal =  The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association}}</ref> Later reviews of these studies have concluded that their research is of insufficient quality to provide conclusive proof for the effectiveness of craniosacral therapy and the existence of cranial bone movement.<ref name=Green/>

Practitioners of craniosacral therapy assert that there are small, rhythmic motions of the [[Cranial vault|cranial bones]] attributed to cerebrospinal fluid pressure or arterial pressure. The premise of CST is that palpation of the cranium can be used to detect this rhythmic movement of the cranial bones and selective pressures may be used to manipulate the cranial bones to achieve a therapeutic result.  However, the degree of mobility and compliance of the cranial bones is considered controversial and is a critically important concept in craniosacral therapy.<ref name="International"/>

==Treatment==
The therapist lightly [[palpate]]s the patient's body, and focuses intently on the communicated movements. A practitioner's feeling of being in tune with a patient is described as ''entrainment''.<ref name="Mcpartland1"/>
Patients often report feelings of deep [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] during and after the treatment session, and may feel light-headed. This is popularly associated{{by whom|date=January 2013}} with increases in [[endorphin]]s, but research shows the effects may actually be brought about by the [[endocannabinoid system]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=McPartland|first=John M.|coauthors=Giuffrida, A; King, J; Skinner, E; Scotter, J; Musty, RE|title=Cannabimimetic effects of osteopathic manipulative treatment|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|year=2005|month=June|volume=105|issue=6|pages=283–91|pmid=16118355|url=http://www.jaoa.org/content/105/6/283.long|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> 

There are few reports of [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse events]] from CST treatment. In one study of craniosacral manipulation in patients with [[traumatic brain injury|traumatic brain syndrome]], the incidence of adverse effects from treatment was 5%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greenman|first=PE|coauthors=McPartland, JM|title=Cranial findings and iatrogenesis from craniosacral manipulation in patients with traumatic brain syndrome|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|year=1995|month=Mar|volume=95|issue=3|pages=182–8; 191–2|pmid=7751168}}</ref>

===Primary respiratory mechanism===
The ''Primary Respiratory Mechanism'' (PRM) has been summarized in five ideas.<ref name="Jakel"/>

;Inherent motility of the central nervous system
:The postulated [[intracranial]] fluid fluctuation is described by practitioners as an interaction between four main components: [[artery|arterial]] [[blood]], [[capillary]] blood (brain volume), [[venous blood]] and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Greitz|first=D|coauthors=Franck, A; Nordell, B|title=On the pulsatile nature of intracranial and spinal CSF-circulation demonstrated by MR imaging|journal=Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)|year=1993|month=July|volume=34|issue=4|pages=321–8|pmid=8318291|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8318291|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Greitz|first=D|coauthors=Wirestam, R; Franck, A; Nordell, B; Thomsen, C; Ståhlberg, F|title=Pulsatile brain movement and associated hydrodynamics studied by magnetic resonance phase imaging.

;Fluctuation of the cerebrospinal fluid
:There is research which demonstrates examiners are unable to measure craniosacral motion reliably, as indicated by a lack of inter-rater agreement among examiners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wirth-Pattullo |first=Virginia|coauthors=Hayes, Karen W.|title=Interrater reliability of craniosacral rate measurements and their relationship with subjects' and examiners' heart and respiratory rate measurements |journal=Physical therapy |year=1994|month=Oct|volume=74|issue=10|pages=908–16; discussion 917–20|pmid=8090842|url=http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/74/10/908.long|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> The authors of this research conclude this "measurement error may be sufficiently large to render many clinical decisions potentially erroneous".

;Mobility of the intracranial and intraspinal dural membranes
:In 1970, Upledger observed during a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure on the neck what he described as a slow pulsating movement within the spinal meninges. He attempted to hold the membrane still and found that he could not due to the strength of the action behind the movement.<ref>Upledger J E, Vredevoogd J. 1983 ''Craniosacral Therapy'' Eastland Press.

In 2011 a systematic review concluded that the evidence base surrounding craniosacral therapy and its efficacy was sparse and composed of studies with heterogeneous design.
