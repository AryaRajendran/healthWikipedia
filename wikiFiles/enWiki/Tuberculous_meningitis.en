'''Tuberculous meningitis''' is also known as '''TB meningitis''' or '''tubercular meningitis'''.

Tuberculous [[meningitis]] is ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' infection of the [[meninges]]—the system of [[Mesothelium|membrane]]s which envelops the [[central nervous system]]. It is the most common form of [[central nervous system|CNS]] [[tuberculosis]].

==Clinical features==
[[Fever]] and [[headache]] are the cardinal features. [[Confusion]] is a late feature and [[coma]] bears a poor prognosis.  [[Meningism]] is absent in a fifth of patients with TB meningitis.  Patients may also have focal neurological deficits.

==Pathology==
'''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''' of the meninges is the cardinal feature and the inflammation is concentrated towards the base of the [[brain]].  When the inflammation is in the brain stem subarachnoid area, cranial nerve roots may be affected.  The symptoms will mimic those of space-occupying lesions.<ref>p1301 Robbins and Cotran, ''Pathologic Basis of Disease'', 8th edition</ref>  Infection begins in the lungs and may spread to the meninges by a variety of routes.

Blood-borne spread certainly occurs and 25% of patients with [[miliary TB]] have TB meningitis, presumably by crossing the [[blood–brain barrier]];<ref>{{cite journal | title=''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' invasion and traversal across an in vitro human blood–brain barrier as a pathogenic mechanism for central nervous system tuberculosis | author=Jain SK, Paul-Satyaseela M, Lamichhane G, ''et al.'' | journal=J. Infect. Dis. | year=2006 | volume=193 | issue=9 | pages=1287–95 | doi=10.1086/502631 |month=May |pmid=16586367}}</ref> but a proportion of patients may get TB meningitis from rupture of a cortical focus in the brain (a so-called '''[[Rich focus]]'''); an even smaller proportion get it from rupture of a bony focus in the spine.  It is rare and unusual for TB of the spine to cause TB of the [[central nervous system]], but isolated cases have been described.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of TB meningitis is made by analysing [[cerebrospinal fluid]]  collected by [[lumbar puncture]].  When collecting CSF for suspected TB meningitis, a minimum of 1[[millilitre|ml]] of fluid should be taken (preferably 5 to 10ml).

The CSF usually has a high protein, low glucose and a raised number of lymphocytes.  [[Acid-fast bacilli]] are sometimes seen on a CSF smear, but more commonly, ''M. tuberculosis'' is grown in culture. A spiderweb clot in the collected CSF is characteristic of TB meningitis, but is a rare finding.

[[ELISPOT]] testing is not useful for the diagnosis of acute TB meningitis and is often false negative,<ref>{{cite journal

More than half of cases of TB meningitis cannot be confirmed microbiologically, and these patients are treated on the basis of clinical suspicion only.  The culture of TB from CSF takes a minimum of two weeks, and therefore the majority of patients with TB meningitis are started on treatment before the diagnosis is confirmed.

===Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)===
This is a heterogeneous group of tests that use [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to detect mycobacterial nucleic acid. These test vary in which nucleic acid sequence they detect and vary in their accuracy. The two most common commercially available tests are the amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD, Gen-Probe) and Amplicor. In 2007, a systematic review of NAAT by the NHS Health Technology Assessment Programme concluded that for diagnosing tuberculous meningitis "Individually, the AMTD test appears to perform the best (sensitivity 74% and specificity 98%) [page 87]".<REF NAME="pmid17266837">{{cite journal |author=Dinnes J, Deeks J, Kunst H, Gibson A, Cummins E, Waugh N, Drobniewski F, Lalvani A |title=A systematic review of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of tuberculosis infection |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=1–314 |year=2007 |pmid=17266837 | url = http://www.hta.nhsweb.nhs.uk/project/1247.asp}}</ref> In the NHS [[meta-analysis]], they found the pooled prevalence of TB meningitis to be 29% [page 85]; however there was much heterogeneity in the reported sensitivities. Using a [http://medinformatics.uthscsa.edu/calculator/ clinical calculator], these numbers yield a [[positive predictive value]] of 94% and a [[negative predictive value]] of 90%; however the 30% prevalence may be high due to referral bias. Alternate estimates of disease prevalence can be entered into the [http://medinformatics.uthscsa.edu/calculator/ clinical calculator] to refine the predictive values.These instances vary from patient to patient according to their pathology.

===Imaging===
Imaging studies such as [[computed tomography|CT]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] may show features strongly suggestive of TB meningitis, but cannot diagnose it.

==Treatment==
''See: [[tuberculosis treatment]]''

The treatment of TB meningitis is [[isoniazid]], [[rifampicin]], [[pyrazinamide]] and [[ethambutol]] for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin alone for a further ten months.  Steroids are always used in the first six weeks of treatment (and sometimes for longer).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Thwaites GE, Nguyen DB, Nguyen HD, ''et al.''|title=Dexamethasone for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis in adolescents and adults|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2004|volume=351|issue=17|pages=1741&ndash;1751|pmid= 15496623|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa040573}}</ref>  A few patients may require [[immunomodulator]]y agents such as [[thalidomide]].

Treatment must be started as soon as there is a reasonable suspicion of the diagnosis.  Treatment must not be delayed while waiting for confirmation of the diagnosis.

[[Hydrocephalus]] occurs as a complication in about a third of patients with TB meningitis and will require a [[ventricular shunt]]. The addition of aspirin may improve mortality,<ref>{{cite journal|unused_data=Misra UK, Kalita J, Nair PP, ''et al.''|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2010.03.025|last1=Misra|first1=U.K.|last2=Kalita|first2=J.|last3=Nair|first3=P.P.|title=Role of aspirin in tuberculous meningitis: a randomized open-label placebo-controlled trial|journal=J Neutrol Sci|year=2010|volume=293|issue=1-2|pages=12&ndash;17}}</ref> possibly by reducing complications such as infarcts.
