'''Bronchiolitis obliterans''' (BO),<ref name=pu>{{cite pmid|8140211}}</ref> also called '''obliterative bronchiolitis''' (OB)<ref name=ob>{{cite pmid|9678682}}</ref> and '''constrictive bronchiolitis''' (CB),<ref name=cb>{{cite pmid|9845757}}</ref> is a rare and life-threatening form of non-reversible obstructive [[lung]] disease in which the [[bronchiole]]s (small airway branches) are compressed and narrowed by [[fibrosis]] (scar tissue) and/or [[inflammation]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/bronchiolitis%20obliterans Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary > bronchiolitis obliterans] Retrieved on August, 2010</ref> Bronchiolitis obliterans is also sometimes used to refer  to a particularly severe form of pediatric bronchiolitis caused by adenovirus. 

''Bronchiolitis'' means [[inflammation]] of the [[bronchioles]] and ''obliterans'' refers to the fact that the inflammation or fibrosis of the bronchioles partially or completely obliterates the airways.<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:bronchiolitis fibrosa obliterans">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzninezSz000950973zPzhtm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:bronchiolitis fibrosa obliterans |work= |accessdate=2008-11-17}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==

Bronchiolitis obliterans is a lung disease characterized by fixed airway obstruction.  [[Inflammation]] and [[scarring]] occur in the airways of the lung, resulting in severe shortness of breath and dry cough. 

FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) should be above 80% of predicted values to be considered normal. Bronchiolitis obliterans reduces this to 16% to 21%.

Symptoms include:
* dry cough
* shortness of breath
* wheezing

The symptoms can start gradually, or severe symptoms can occur suddenly.{{ref label|CDC|3|^}}<ref>http://www.morethanacold.co.uk/about-bronchiolitis/bronchiolitis-symptoms.aspx</ref>

==Cause==
Bronchiolitis obliterans has many possible causes, including: [[collagen vascular disease]], [[transplant rejection]] in [[organ transplant]] patients, viral infection ([[respiratory syncytial virus]], [[adenovirus]], [[HIV]], [[cytomegalovirus]]), [[Stevens-Johnson Syndrome]], [[Pneumocystis pneumonia]], drug reaction, aspiration and complications of prematurity ([[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]]), and exposure to toxic fumes, including: [[diacetyl]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[ammonia]], [[chlorine]], [[thionyl chloride]], [[methyl isocyanate]], [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[hydrogen bromide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[phosgene]], polyamide-amine dyes, mustard gas and [[ozone]]. It can also be present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<ref>{{cite book |last= Sam |first= Amir H. |coauthors= James T.H. Teo |title= [[Rapid Medicine]] |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 2010 |isbn= 1-4051-8323-3}}</ref> Certain orally administrated emergency medications, such as [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]], have been known to cause it when aspirated.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} Additionally, the disorder may be [[idiopathic]] (without known cause).{{ref label|Brant|1|^}}{{ref label|Webb|2|^}}{{ref label|Hazmap|5|^}}

===Industrial inhalants===

There are many industrial inhalants that are known to cause various types of bronchiolitis, including bronchiolitis obliterans. {{ref label|Colby|5|^}}
                
Industrial workers who have presented with bronchiolitis:
         
*nylon-flock workers {{ref label|Hazmap|6|^}}
*workers who spray prints onto textiles with polyamide-amine dyes {{ref label|Hazmap|6|^}}
*battery workers who are exposed to thionyl chloride fumes
*workers at plants that use or manufacture flavorings, e.g. diacetyl butter-like flavoring {{ref label|CDC|3|^}}{{ref label|Hazmap|6|^}}{{ref label|CalOSH|7|^}}

===Diacetyl (popcorn workers lung)===
[[File:Diacetyl structure.png|thumb|[[Diacetyl]]]]
In rare instances, bronchiolitis obliterans may be caused by inhalation of airborne [[diacetyl]], a chemical used to produce the [[artificial butter flavoring]]<ref name="pmid17288497">{{cite journal |author=Harber P, Saechao K, Boomus C |title=Diacetyl-induced lung disease |journal=Toxicol Rev |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=261–272 |year=2006 |pmid=17288497 |month= |url= |doi=10.2165/00139709-200625040-00006}}</ref> in many foods such as candy and microwave popcorn and occurring naturally in wines. This first came to public attention when eight former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in [[Jasper, Missouri]], developed bronchiolitis obliterans. In 2000, the Missouri Department of Health called in [[NIOSH]] to make a determination of the cause, and to recommend safety measures. After surveying the plant and each patient's medical history, NIOSH recommended respiratory protection for all workers in microwave popcorn production. Due to this event, bronchiolitis obliterans began to be referred to in the popular media as "Popcorn Lung" or "Popcorn Workers Lung".{{ref label|NIOSH|4|^}}{{ref label|NEJM|8|^}}{{ref label|Egilman|9|^}}

In 2007 a heavy consumer of microwaved popcorn was diagnosed by a doctor in Denver with "popcorn lung," the first known case involving a consumer.{{ref label|Reuters|13|^}} On 16 January 2008, it was announced that Wayne Watson, the Denver consumer who developed "popcorn lung" after inhaling fumes from microwaved popcorn, was suing the [[Kroger]] grocery store chain and its affiliates. In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, Watson's attorney claimed that the companies "failed to warn that preparing microwave popcorn in a microwave oven as intended and smelling the buttery aroma could expose the consumer to an inhalation hazard and a risk of lung injury."{{ref label|Kroger|16|^}} On September 19, 2012 a [[jury]] in [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado|U.S. District Court in Denver]] awarded $2.3 million in [[actual damages]] and $5 million in [[punitive damages]] to Wayne Watson of [[Centennial, Colorado]] who habitually consumed microwave popcorn for a decade. Defendants included [[Glister-Mary Lee]], the manufacturer; [[Kroger]], and Kroger's subsidiary [[Dillons]], owners of [[King Soopers & City Market]], a Colorado regional supermarket chain.<ref name=DP92112>{{cite news|title=Centennial man with "popcorn lung" disease gets $7.3 million award|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21586951/centennial-man-popcorn-lung-disease-gets-7-3|accessdate=September 22, 2012|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=September 21, 2012|author=Mark Jaffe|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6As16codb|archivedate=September 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?n=81014-conagra-popcorn-lung-diacetyl ABC News‘Popcorn Lung’ Lawsuit Nets $7.2M Award]</ref><ref>[http://newsfeedresearcher.com/data/articles_m38_2/popcorn-watson-lungs.html#hdng0 NewsFeed Researcher: 'Popcorn Lung' Lawsuit Nets $7.2M Award]</ref> 

On 27 August 2007, Weaver Popcorn Company of [[Indianapolis]] promised to replace the diacetyl butter flavor ingredient in [[Pop Weaver]] popcorn with another flavoring.{{ref label|Weaver|14|^}}

In September 2007, Dr. Cecile Rose, pulmonary specialist at Denver's National Jewish Medical and Research Center, warned federal agencies that consumers, not just flavoring or food factory workers, may be in danger of contracting bronchiolitis obliterans. David Michaels, of the [[George Washington University]] School of Public Health, first published Rose's warning letter on his blog.{{ref label|Yahoo|10|^}}{{ref label|letter|11|^}}{{ref label|PH|12|^}}

On 4 September 2007, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers recommended reduction of diacetyl in butter-like flavorings. The next day [[ConAgra Foods]] announced that it would soon remove diacetyl from its popcorn products.{{ref label|ConAgra|15|^}}

Diacetyl is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a safe flavor ingredient, but there is evidence to suggest that inhalation in large amounts is dangerous. There are currently no warnings from federal regulators about diacetyl.

==Diagnosis==

Bronchiolitis obliterans is often misdiagnosed as [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]], [[emphysema]], or [[pneumonia]].  

Diagnosis may include the following tests:

* [[Chest X-rays]] tests.
* Diffusing capacity of the lung ([[DLCO]]) tests are usually normal.
* [[Spirometry]] tests show fixed [[airway obstructions]] and sometimes restriction. FEV1/FVC may therefore be <75%.
* [[Lung volume]] tests may show hyperinflation (excessive air in lungs caused by [[air trapping]]).
* High-resolution computerized [[tomography]] scans of the chest at full inspiration and expiration may reveal heterogeneous [[air trapping]] on the expiratory view as well as haziness and thickened airway walls.
* [[Lung biopsies]] may reveal evidence of constrictive bronchiolitis obliterans (i.e., severe narrowing or complete obstruction of the small airways). An open lung biopsy, such as by thoracoscopy, is more likely to be diagnostic than a transbronchial biopsy. Special processing, staining, and review of multiple tissue sections may be necessary for a diagnosis.{{ref label|NIOSH|4|^}}

==Treatment==

This disease is irreversible and severe cases often require a [[lung transplant]]. Evaluation of interventions to prevent bronchiolitis obliterans relies on early detection of abnormal [[spirometry]] results or unusual decreases in repeated measurements.
