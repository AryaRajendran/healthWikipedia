'''Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich''' (August 4, 1815, [[Sulz am Neckar]] &ndash; September 25, 1877, [[Leipzig]]) was a German [[physician]], pioneer [[psychiatrist]], and medical professor.  He is known for his measurement of mean [[normal human body temperature|healthy human body temperature]] of 37°C (98.6°F), now known more accurately to be about 36.8°C (98.2°F).<ref>{{Cite journal

}}  The conversion of 37°C to Fahrenheit should have conserved Wunderlich's two significant figures, thus the standard ought to have been {{convert|99|°F|°C|abbr=on}} until its recent empirical correction.</ref>

He  attended grammar school in [[Stuttgart]] and  at the age of eighteen he began his medical studies at [[Tübingen University]], where he completed his final exams in 1837.  In 1838 he worked as assistant at St Catharine's Hospital in Stuttgart, and wrote his MD thesis.  Two years later he wrote his MD [[habilitation]] on internal medicine at Tübingen University 

In 1846 he was appointed Professor (ordentlicher Professor) and head of the general hospital at Tübingen.  Four years later he moved to [[Leipzig University]] as Professor and Medical Director of the university hospital.  There he introduced [[clinical pedagogy]], combined with a rigorous methodology of diagnosis, and empirical observation of patients. He introduced temperature charts into hospitals, holding that fever is not a disease, but a symptom. The thermometer he used was reportedly a foot long, and required 20 minutes to register the temperature.

He was known for his lectures on psychiatry and on the "pathology and therapy of illnesses of the [[nervous system]]."   He described an extremely rare [[eponymous]] syndrome  which consists of [[retroperitoneal]] bleeding from the [[kidney]] which tracks into the surrounding tissues.

In 1871 he was appointed to the Department of Medicine's organisational commission for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals.
