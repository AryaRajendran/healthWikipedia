[[Mathematical models]] can project how [[infectious diseases]] progress to show the likely outcome of an [[epidemic]] and help inform [[public health]] interventions. Models use some basic assumptions and mathematics to find [[parameter]]s for various [[infectious disease]]s and use those parameters to calculate the effects of possible interventions, like mass [[vaccination]] programmes.

==History==
Early pioneers in infectious disease modelling were William Hamer and [[Ronald Ross]], who in the early twentieth century applied the [[law of mass action]] to explain epidemic behaviour. [[Lowell Reed]] and [[Wade Hampton Frost]] developed the [[Reed-Frost model|Reed-Frost epidemic model]] to describe the relationship between [[susceptible]], infected and [[immunity (medical)|immune]] individuals in a population.

==Concepts==

; ''R''<sub>0</sub>, the [[basic reproduction number]]
: The average number of other individuals each infected individual will infect in a population that has no [[immune system|immunity]] to the disease.
; [[susceptible|''S'']]
: The proportion of the population who are susceptible to the disease (neither immune nor infected).
; ''A''
: The average age at which the disease is contracted in a given population.
; ''L''
: The average [[life expectancy]] in a given population.

==Assumptions==
Models are only as good as the assumptions on which they are based. If a model makes predictions which are out of line with observed results and the mathematics is correct, the initial assumptions must change to make the model useful.
* [[Population pyramid|Rectangular age distribution]]: Often well-justified for developed countries where there is a low infant mortality and much of the population lives to the life expectancy. 
* Homogeneous mixing of the population, i.e., individuals of the population under scrutiny assort and [[transmission risks and rates|make contact]] at random and do not mix mostly in a smaller subgroup. This assumption is rarely justified because [[social structure]] is widespread, for example, most people in London, only make contact with other Londoners, and within London then there will be smaller subgroups such as the Turkish community or teenagers (just to give two examples) who will mix with each other more than people outside their group. However, homogeneous mixing is a standard assumption to make the mathematics tractable.

==Endemic steady state==
An infectious disease is said to be [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] when it can be sustained in a population without the need for external inputs. This means that, on average, each infected person is infecting ''exactly'' one other person (any more and the number of people infected will [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]] and there will be an [[epidemic]], any less and the disease will die out). In mathematical terms, that is:

<math>
\ {R_0} \times {S} = {1}.
</math>

The [[basic reproduction number]] (''R''<sub>0</sub>) of the disease, assuming everyone is susceptible, multiplied by the proportion of the population that is actually susceptible (''S'') must be one (since those who are not susceptible do not feature in our calculations as they cannot contract the disease). Notice that this relation means that for a disease to be in the [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] [[steady state]], the higher the basic reproduction number, the lower the proportion of the population susceptible must be, and vice versa.

The first assumption (above) lets us say that everyone in the population lives to age ''L'' and then dies. If the average age of infection is ''A'', then on average individuals younger than ''A'' are susceptible and those older than ''A'' are immune (or infectious). Thus the proportion of the population that is susceptible is given by:

<math>
{S} = \frac {A} {L}.
</math>

But the mathematical definition of the endemic steady state can be rearranged to give:

<math>
{S} = \frac {1} {R_0}.
</math>

Therefore, since things equal to the same thing are equal to each other:

<math>
\frac {1} {R_0} = \frac {A} {L} \Rightarrow {R_0} = \frac {L} {A}.
</math>

This provides a simple way to estimate the parameter ''R''<sub>0</sub> using easily available data.

For a population with an [[population pyramid|exponential age distribution]],

<math>
{R_0} = {1} + \frac {L} {A}.
</math>

This allows for the basic reproduction number of a disease given ''A'' and ''L'' in either type of population distribution.

==Infectious disease dynamics==

Mathematical models need to integrate the increasing volume of [[Numerical data|data]] being generated on [[Host (biology)|host]]-[[pathogen]] interactions. Many theoretical studies of the [[population dynamics]], structure and evolution of [[infectious disease]]s of [[plants]] and animals, including humans, are concerned with this problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Research topics include:

* [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], spread and control of infection
* [[epidemiological]] networks
* [[spatial epidemiology]]
* persistence of pathogens within hosts
* intra-host dynamics
* [[immune system|immuno]]-epidemiology
* [[virulence]]
* [[Strain (biology)]] structure and interactions
* [[antigenic shift]]
* [[phylodynamics]]
* pathogen [[population genetics]]
* [[evolution]] and spread of [[drug resistance|resistance]]
* role of host genetic factors
* statistical and mathematical tools and innovations
* role and identification of [[infection reservoir]]s

==Mathematics of mass vaccination==
If the proportion of the population that is immune exceeds the [[herd immunity]] level for the disease, then the disease can no longer persist in the population. Thus, if this level can be exceeded by vaccination, the disease can be eliminated. An example of this being successfully achieved worldwide is the global eradication of [[smallpox]], with the last wild case in 1977. The [[WHO]] is carrying out a similar vaccination campaign to eradicate [[polio]].

The herd immunity level will be denoted ''q''. Recall that, for a stable state:

<math>
\ {R_0} \cdot {S} = {1}.
</math>

''S'' will be (1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''q''), since ''q'' is the proportion of the population that is immune and ''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''S'' must equal one  (since in this simplified model, everyone is either susceptible or immune). Then:

<math> \ {R_0} \cdot ({1}-{q}) = {1}, </math>
<math> {1}-{q} = \frac {1} {R_0}, </math>
<math> {q} = {1} - \frac {1} {R_0}. </math>

Remember that this is the threshold level. If the proportion of immune individuals ''exceeds'' this level due to a mass vaccination programme, the disease will die out.

We have just calculated the '''critical immunisation threshold''' (denoted ''q<sub>c</sub>''). It is the minimum proportion of the population that must be immunised at birth (or close to birth) in order for the infection to die out in the population.

<math> {q_c} = {1} - \frac {1} {R_0} </math>

===When mass vaccination cannot exceed the herd immunity===
If the vaccine used is insufficiently effective or the required coverage cannot be reached (for example due to [[MMR vaccine controversy|popular resistance]]), the programme may fail to exceed ''q<sub>c</sub>''. Such a programme can, however, disturb the balance of the infection without eliminating it, often causing unforeseen problems.

Suppose that a proportion of the population ''q'' (where ''q'' < ''q<sub>c</sub>'') is immunised at birth against an infection with ''R''<sub>0</sub>>1. The [[vaccination]] programme changes ''R''<sub>0</sub> to ''R''<sub>''q''</sub> where

<math>
\ {R_q} = {R_0}{({1}-{q})}
</math>

This change occurs simply because there are now fewer susceptibles in the population who can be infected. R<sub>q</sub> is simply R<sub>0</sub> minus those that would normally be infected but that cannot be now since they are immune.

As a consequence of this lower [[basic reproduction number]], the average age of infection ''A'' will also change to some new value ''A''<sub>q</sub> in those who have been left unvaccinated.

Recall the relation that linked R<sub>0</sub>, ''A'' and ''L''. Assuming that life expectancy has not changed, now:

<math>\ {R_q} = \frac {L} {A_q},</math>
<math>\ {A_q} = \frac {L} {R_q} = \frac {L} {{R_0}({1}-{q})}.</math>

But ''R''<sub>0</sub> = ''L''/''A'' so:

<math>\ {A_q} = \frac {L} {({L}/{A})({1}-{q})} = \frac {AL} {{L}({1}-{q})} = \frac {A} {{1}-{q}}.</math>

Thus the vaccination programme will raise the average age of infection, another mathematical justification for a result that might have been intuitively obvious. Unvaccinated individuals now experience a reduced [[force of infection]] due to the presence of the vaccinated group.

However, it is important to consider this effect when vaccinating against diseases that are more severe in older people. A vaccination programme against such a disease that does not exceed ''q<sub>c</sub>'' may cause more deaths and complications than there were before the programme was brought into force as individuals will be catching the disease later in life. These unforeseen outcomes of a vaccination programme are called '''perverse effects'''.

===When mass vaccination exceeds the herd immunity===
If a vaccination programme causes the proportion of immune individuals in a population to exceed the critical threshold for a significant length of time, transmission of the infectious disease in that population will stop. This is known as elimination of the infection and is different from [[Disease eradication|eradication]].

; Elimination
: Interruption of endemic transmission of an infectious disease, which occurs if each infected individual infects less than one other, is achieved by maintaining vaccination coverage to keep the proportion of immune individuals above the critical immunisation threshold.
; Eradication
: Reduction of infective organisms in the wild worldwide to zero. So far, this has only been achieved for [[smallpox]] and [[rinderpest]]. To get to eradication, elimination in all world regions must be achieved.
