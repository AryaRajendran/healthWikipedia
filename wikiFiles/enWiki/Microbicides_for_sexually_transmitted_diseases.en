'''Microbicides for  [[sexually transmitted disease]]s''' are [[pharmacology|pharmacologic]] agents and [[chemical substance]]s that are capable of killing or destroying certain [[microorganism]]s that commonly cause human [[infection]] (for example, the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]).

Microbicides  are a diverse group of [[chemical compound]]s that exert their activity by a variety of different [[Pharmacodynamics|mechanisms of action]].
Multiple compounds are being developed and tested for their microbicidal activity in [[clinical trial]]s. Microbicides can be formulated in various [[Drug delivery|delivery systems]] including [[gel]]s, [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lotion]]s, [[aerosol spray]]s, [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] or [[coating|films]] (which must be used near the time of [[sexual intercourse]]) and sponges and [[vaginal ring]]s (or other devices that release the [[active ingredient]](s) over a longer period). Some of these agents are being developed for [[vagina]]l application, and for [[Rectum|rectal]] use by those engaging in [[anal sex]].

Although there are many approaches to preventing sexually transmitted diseases in general (and HIV in particular), current methods have not been sufficient to halt the spread of these diseases (particularly among women and people in [[Developing country|less-developed nations]]). [[Sexual abstinence]] is not a realistic option for women who want to bear children, or who are at risk of [[sexual violence]].<ref>{{Cite web

It is hoped that microbicides may be safe and effective in reducing the risk of HIV [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with an infected partner.<ref>{{Cite web

==Mechanisms of action==
=== Detergents ===
[[Detergent]] and [[surfactant]] microbicides such as [[nonoxynol-9]], [[Sodium lauryl sulfate|sodium dodecyl sulfate]] and Savvy (1.0% C31G), act by disrupting the [[viral envelope]], [[capsid]] or [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membrane]] of microorganisms. Since detergent microbicides also kill host cells and impair the barrier function of healthy [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] surfaces, they are less desirable than other agents. Additionally, clinical trials have not demonstrated these agents to be effective at preventing HIV transmission.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Consequently, laboratory and clinical trials testing this class of products as microbicides have largely been discontinued.<ref>{{Cite web

===Vaginal defense enhancers===
Healthy vaginal [[pH]] is typically quite [[acid]]ic, with a pH value of around 4. However, the [[alkalinity|alkaline]] pH of [[semen]] can neutralize vaginal pH. One potential class of microbicides acts by reducing the pH of vaginal [[secretion]]s, which may kill (or otherwise inactivate) pathogenic microorganisms. One such agent is [[BufferGel]], a [[spermicide|spermicidal]] and microbicidal gel formulated to maintain the natural protective acidity of the vagina. Candidates in this category (including BufferGel) have proven to be ineffective in preventing HIV infection.<ref>{{Cite web

===Polyanions===
[[Image:cellulose sulfate.png|thumb|alt=chemical structure of cellulose sulfate|Cellulose sulfate (also known as sulfate cellulose or sulfocellulose)|alt=Chemical diagram of cellulose sulfate]]
The [[Polyelectrolyte|polyanion]] category of microbicides includes the [[carrageenan]]s. Carrageenans are a family of linear sulfated [[polysaccharide]]s chemically related to [[heparan sulfate]], which many microbes utilize as a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|biochemical receptor]] for initial attachment to the [[cell membrane]]. Thus, carrageenan and other microbicides of its class act as decoy receptors for [[virus|viral]] binding.

''Carrageenan'' preparations (such as 0.5% PRO 2000 and 3% Carraguard vaginal microbicide gels) have failed to demonstrate [[efficacy]] in preventing HIV transmission in [[Phase_III_clinical_trials#Phase_III|phase III]] clinical [[multicenter trial]]s. PRO 2000 was demonstrated to be safe, but it did not reduce the risk of HIV infection in women (as explained in the MDP 301 trial results, released in December 2009).<ref>{{Cite web

''Cellulose sulfate'' is another microbicide found ineffective in preventing the transmission of HIV.

It is also hoped that microbicides will block the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, such as those caused by certain [[human papillomavirus]]es (HPV) and [[herpes simplex virus]]es (HSV). In 2009, Starpharma released its results for a study investigating VivaGel’s antiviral activity against HIV and HSV in humans by testing cervico-vaginal samples ''in vitro'' (in a test tube). The compound displayed a high level of efficacy against HIV and HSV. While the results are encouraging, the study did not evaluate VivaGel’s effect in the body. It is still unknown what the results mean for women who would use the product in real-life settings; for example, the effect of sexual intercourse (or semen) on the gel (which often affects the protective properties of a drug) is unknown. The [[CAPRISA 004]] trial demonstrated that topical tenofovir gel provided 51% protection against HSV-2.<ref>{{Cite web

===Antiretrovirals===

Researchers have begun to focus on another class of microbicides, the [[antiretroviral]] (ARV) agents. ARVs work either by preventing the HIV virus from entering a human host cell, or by preventing its replication after it has already entered.<ref>http://www.caprisa.org/joomla/index.php/component/content/article/1/225</ref> Examples of ARV drugs being tested for prevention include [[tenofovir]], [[dapivirine]] (a [[diarylpyrimidine]] [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor|inhibitor]] of HIV [[reverse transcriptase]]) and UC-781.<ref>{{Cite web

ARVs are also used to prevent [[vertical transmission]] of HIV from mother to child during [[childbirth]], and are used to prevent HIV infection from developing immediately [[Post-exposure prophylaxis|after exposure]] to the virus.<ref>{{Cite web

ARV-based microbicides may be formulated as long-acting vaginal rings, gels and films. The results of the first efficacy trial of an ARV-based microbicide, CAPRISA 004, tested 1% tenofovir in gel form to prevent male-to-female HIV transmission. The trial showed that the gel (which was applied topically to the vagina), was 39% effective at preventing HIV transmission.<ref name="global-campaign">{{Cite web

The results of this trial are [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] and offer [[proof of concept]] that ARVs, topically applied to the vaginal mucosa, can offer protection against HIV (and other) [[pathogen]]s.<ref name="global-campaign" />

==Formulations==

Most of the '''first generation''' microbicides were formulated as semi-solid systems, such as gels, tablets, films, or creams, and were designed to be applied to the vagina before every act of intercourse. However, vaginal rings have the potential to provide long-term controlled release of microbicide drugs. Long-acting formulations, like vaginal rings, are potentially advantageous since they could be easy to use, requiring replacement only once a month. This ease of use could prove very important to make sure that products are used properly. In 2010, the [[International Partnership for Microbicides]] began the first study in Africa to test the safety and acceptability of a vaginal ring containing dapivirine.<ref>{{Cite web

Injectable formulations may be desirable since they could be administered infrequently, possibly once a month. It is likely, however, that such products would need to be monitored closely and would be available only through prescription. This approach also carries the risk of emergence of ARV-resistant strains of HIV.<ref>{{Cite web

Substantial numbers of men who have sex with men in [[Developed country|developed countries]] use lubricants containing nonoxynol-9.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} This suggests that they might be receptive to the concept of using topical rectal microbicides if such products were to become commercially available.<ref>{{Cite web

Ultimately, successful topical microbicides might simultaneously employ multiple modes of action. In fact, long-acting formulations such as vaginal rings could provide the technology needed to deliver multiple active ingredients with different mechanisms of action.

==Completed clinical trials==

A major breakthrough in microbicide research, announced in July 2010, proved that an ARV-based microbicide does work. A trial led by the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), conducted in South Africa, demonstrated that the ARV tenofovir, when used in a vaginal gel, was 39% effective at preventing HIV transmission from men to women during sex.<ref name="caprisa">{{Cite web

=== {{anchor|Tenofovir gel,CAPRISA 004}}Tenofovir gel ===
[[File:Tenofovir.png|thumb|150px|Chemical structure of tenofovir|alt=Chemical diagram of tenofovir]]
In July 2010 the [[Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa]] (CAPRISA) released results of a study establishing proof of concept that an ARV-based, topical microbicide can reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission. The trial, CAPRISA 004, was conducted among 889 women to evaluate the ability of 1% tenofovir gel to prevent male-to-female HIV transmission. The study found a 39% lower HIV infection rate in women using 1% tenofovir gel compared with women using a placebo gel. In addition, tenofovir gel was shown to be safe as tested.<ref name="caprisa" /> The results of the [[CAPRISA 004]] trial provide statistically significant evidence that ARVs, topically applied to the vaginal mucosa, can offer protection against HIV and (potentially) other pathogens. During the study, 38 of the women who used the tenofovir gel acquired HIV and 60 women who used a placebo gel became HIV-infected. No tenofovir-resistant virus was detected in the women who acquired HIV infection during the study. In addition to demonstrating efficacy against HIV, CAPRISA 004 found evidence that tenofovir gel also prevents the transmission of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is a lifelong, incurable infection which can make those infected with the virus two-to-three times more likely to acquire HIV. Data collected during the CAPRISA 004 study indicate that tenofovir gel provided 51% protection against HSV-2. Tenofovir, developed by Gilead Sciences, is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) which interferes with the replication of HIV and is approved in tablet form for use in combination with other ARVs to treat HIV. CAPRISA 004 was a collaboration among CAPRISA, [[Family Health International]] and [[CONRAD (organization)|CONRAD]]. It was funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the South African Department of Science and Technology's [[Technology Innovation Agency]].

Clinical evidence suggests that regular use of [[nonoxynol-9]], a spermicide, increases the risk of HIV infection. Early in the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it was found that nonoxynol-9 could block the replication of HIV in laboratory tests. For more than a decade public-health professionals recommended nonoxynol-9 as a topical microbicide, and many condom and sexual-lubricant brands incorporated nonoxynol-9 for this purpose. Subsequent clinical research showed that nonoxynol-9 can result in the formation of erosions (sores) in the vagina or rectum, which are believed to serve as points of entry for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Consequently, there is broad consensus in the public-health community that nonoxynol-9 should ''not'' be used as a topical microbicide.<ref>{{Cite web
