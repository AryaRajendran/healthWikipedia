'''Tea tree oil''', or '''melaleuca oil''', is a pale yellow color to nearly colorless and clear [[essential oil]] with a fresh [[camphor]]aceous [[odor]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.holisticonline.com/aromatherapy/aroma_ess-oil-tea-tree-oil.htm | title = Directory of Essential Oils for Aromatherapy: Tea-Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) | publisher = Holistics Online}}</ref> It is taken from the [[leaf|leaves]] of the ''[[Melaleuca alternifolia]]'', which is native to Southeast [[Queensland]] and the Northeast coast of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Tea tree oil should not be confused with [[tea oil]], the sweet seasoning and cooking oil from pressed seeds of the tea plant ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'' (beverage [[tea]]), or the tea oil plant ''[[Camellia oleifera]]''.

== History and extraction ==

The [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] [[Bundjalung people]] of eastern Australia use “tea trees” as a [[traditional medicine]] by inhaling the oils from the crushed leaves to treat coughs and [[colds]]. They also sprinkle leaves on wounds, after which a [[poultice]] is applied. In addition, tea tree leaves are soaked to make an [[infusion]] to treat sore throats or [[skin]] ailments.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shemesh | first1 = A. | last2 = Mayo | first2 = W.

''Bush medicine.'' Harper Collins Publishers, North Ryde, NSW, Australia</ref>

Use of the oil itself, as opposed to the unextracted plant material, did not become common practice until researcher Arthur Penfold published the first reports of its [[antimicrobial]] activity in a series of papers in the 1920s and 1930s. In evaluating the antimicrobial activity of ''M. alternifolia'', tea tree oil was rated as 11 times more active than [[phenol]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Penfold | first1 = A.

[[Image:tea tree plantation.JPG|left|thumb|Tea tree plantation, [[Coraki]].]]
The commercial tea tree oil [[industry]] was born after the medicinal properties of the oil were first reported by Penfold in the 1920s. It was produced from natural bush stands of ''M. alternifolia'' that produced oil with the appropriate [[chemotype]]. The plant material was hand cut and often [[distilled]] on the spot in makeshift, mobile, wood-fired bush [[still]]s.

Production ebbed after [[World War II]], as demand for the oil declined, presumably due to the development of effective [[antibiotics]] and the waning image of [[natural products]]. Interest in the oil was rekindled in the 1970s as part of the general renaissance of interest in natural products. Commercial [[plantations]] were established in the 1970s and 1980s, which led to [[mechanization]] and large-scale production of a consistent essential oil product.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740580109 |last1=Johns |first1=M.

Although tea tree oil normally is extracted from ''[[Melaleuca alternifolia]]'' commercially, it can also be extracted from ''[[Melaleuca dissitiflora]]'' and ''[[Melaleuca linariifolia]].''

==Composition==
Tea tree oil is defined by international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 4730 (2004)  ("Oil of ''Melaleuca'', Terpinen-4-ol type"), which specifies levels of 15 components which are needed to define the oil as "tea tree oil."

[[Image:MelaleucaAlternifoliaEssOil.png|thumb|right|Tea tree (''Melaleuca alternifolia'') essential oil in a clear glass vial]]

Among over 98 [[chemical compound|compounds]] contained in the oil, [[terpinen-4-ol]] is responsible for most of the antimicrobial activity.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=619–26 |doi=10.1007/s000110050639 |title=Terpinen-4-ol, the main component of the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil), suppresses inflammatory mediator production by activated human monocytes |year=2000 |last1=Hart |first1=P.H. |last2=Brand |first2=C. |last3=Carson |first3=C.F. |last4=Riley |first4=T.V. |last5=Prager |first5=R.H. |last6=Finlay-Jones |first6=J.J. |journal=Inflammation Research |volume=49 |issue=11 |pmid=11131302}}</ref>

==Medical use==
===On humans===
Tea tree oil has been scientifically investigated only recently.  Some sources suggest beneficial [[medicine|medical]] properties when applied [[topical]]ly, including [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]],<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11338678 |year=2001 |last1=Schnitzler |first1=P |last2=Schön |first2=K |last3=Reichling |first3=J |title=Antiviral activity of Australian tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil against herpes simplex virus in cell culture |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=343–7 |journal=Die Pharmazie}}</ref> [[antibacterial]], [[Fungicide|antifungal]], and [[antiseptic]] qualities.  The antiseptic properties can help in the fight against skin blemishes ([[acne]]).<ref>http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/make-natural-moisturizers-2969.html</ref> It also has beneficial [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ptr.1363 |title=Plants used in cosmetics |year=2003 |last1=Aburjai |first1=Talal |last2=Natsheh |first2=Feda M. |journal=Phytotherapy Research |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=987–1000 |pmid=14595575}}</ref> 

Tea tree oil is less successful for anti-microbial application in the nose.<ref name=bastyr>''Journal of Hospital Infection'' (2004; 56:283–286), cited in {{citation | last = Beauchamp | first = Kimberly | year = 2004 | url = http://bastyrcenter.org/content/view/972/&page= | title = Tea Tree Oil and Staph}}{{MEDRS|date=October 2011}}</ref> Also, there is clinical evidence that topical dermatological preparations containing tea tree oil may be more effective than conventional antibiotics in preventing transmission of [[CA-MRSA]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jac/dkn272 |title=Comparative in vitro activities of topical wound care products against community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus |year=2008 |last1=Bearden |first1=D.

Recent studies support a role for the [[topical]] application of tea tree oil in [[Human skin|skin care]] and for the treatment of various [[disease]]s and conditions. Tea tree oil appears to be effective against [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}, [[Mycosis|fungal infections]] such as [[athlete's foot]],<ref name=medlineplus/> [[mite]]s such as [[scabies]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}, and [[lice]] such as [[head louse|head lice]]. A 2008 study of ''in vitro'' toxicity showed a tea tree oil preparation was more effective against head lice than permethrin, a popular pharmaceutical remedy.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=264–72 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2915.2008.00738.x |title=In vitroefficacy of over-the-counter botanical pediculicides against the head lousePediculus humanusvarcapitisbased on a stringent standard for mortality assessment |year=2008 |last1=Heukelbach |first1=J. |last2=Canyon |first2=D.

Tea tree oil is possibly effective against [[Acne vulgaris|acne]].<ref name=medlineplus/> In the treatment of moderate common [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[topical application]] of 5% tea tree oil has shown an effect comparable to 5% [[benzoyl peroxide]]. Albeit with slower onset of action, patients who use tea tree oil experience fewer side effects than those that use benzoyl peroxide treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2145499 |year=1990 |last1=Bassett |first1=IB |last2=Pannowitz |first2=DL |last3=Barnetson |first3=RS |title=A comparative study of tea-tree oil versus benzoylperoxide in the treatment of acne |volume=153 |issue=8 |pages=455–8 |journal=The Medical journal of Australia}}</ref>

Tea tree oil is a known [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] agent, effective ''[[in vitro]]'' against multiple [[dermatophyte]]s found on the skin.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9055360 |year=1996 |last1=Nenoff |first1=P |last2=Haustein |first2=UF |last3=Brandt |first3=W |title=Antifungal activity of the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil) against pathogenic fungi in vitro |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=388–94 |journal=[[Skin Pharmacology and Physiology|Skin pharmacology]] : the official journal of the Skin Pharmacology Society |doi=10.1159/000211450}}</ref> [[Shampoo]] with 5% tea tree oil has been shown to be an effective treatment for [[dandruff]] due to its ability to treat ''[[Malassezia furfur]]'', the most common cause of the condition.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=852–5 |doi=10.1067/mjd.2002.122734 |title=Treatment of dandruff with 5% tea tree oil shampoo |year=2002 |last1=Satchell |first1=A |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=47 |issue=6 |pmid=12451368 |last2=Saurajen |first2=A |last3=Bell |first3=C |last4=Barnetson |first4=RS}}</ref>  

One clinical study found that 100% tea tree oil administered topically, combined with [[debridement]], was comparable to clotrimazole in effectiveness against [[onychomycosis]], the most frequent cause of nail disease.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8195735 |year=1994 |last1=Buck |first1=DS |last2=Nidorf |first2=DM |last3=Addino |first3=JG |title=Comparison of two topical preparations for the treatment of onychomycosis: Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil and clotrimazole |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=601–5 |journal=The Journal of family practice}}</ref> It was not as effective at lower concentrations.<ref name=medlineplus/>

The effectiveness of topical tea tree oil preparations for the treatment of the [[Pathogenic yeasts|yeast]] infection [[Candidiasis]] is supported by its ability to kill [[Candida (genus)|Candida]] ''in vitro.''<ref>{{cite journal |pages=591–5 |doi=10.1093/jac/42.5.591 |title=In-vitro activity of essential oils, in particular Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil and tea tree oil products, against Candida spp |year=1998 |last1=Hammer |first1=K. |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy |volume=42 |issue=5 |pmid=9848442 |last2=Carson |first2=CF |last3=Riley |first3=TV}}</ref>

There is some very limited research that has shown that tea tree oil may have ''in vitro'' [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] activity against the Tobacco Mosaic Virus, some strains of Herpes Simplex, and some bacteriophage viruses. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Bishop |first=C.

=== In aquarium fish ===
Diluted solutions of tea tree oil are often used as a remedy to treat bacterial and fungal infections in [[aquarium fish]]. Common brand names are [[Melafix]] and [[Bettafix]]. Melafix is a stronger concentration and Bettafix is a lower concentration that makes it harder to overdose smaller fish, especially [[betta]]s. It is most commonly used to promote [[fin]] and tissue regrowth, but is also effective in treating other conditions, such as [[fin rot]] or [[Velvet (fish disease)|velvet]]. The remedy is used mostly on [[betta fish]],<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&lr=&vid=USPATAPP12640785&id=0obOAAAAEBAJ&oi=fnd&dq=%22tea+tree%22+aquarium+fish&printsec=abstract#v=onepage&q=%22tea%20tree%22%20aquarium%20fish&f=false | title = ANTIMICROBIAL COMPOSITIONS AND APPLICATIONS THEREFORE (Patent # US 2010/0092398 A1)| first =  Max | last = Reynolds | date = 15 April 2010 | publisher = United States Patent Application Publication}}</ref> but can also be used with other aquarium fish, other than goldfish.

== Safety ==
According to the American Cancer Society: "Tea tree oil is toxic when swallowed. It has been reported to cause drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, coma, unsteadiness, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, blood cell abnormalities, and severe rashes. It should be kept away from pets and children."<ref name=ACS>{{cite web|title=Tea Tree Oil|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Tea_Tree_Oil.asp|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=4 October 2012|date=28 November 2008}}</ref>

Some people can experience allergic contact dermatitis as a reaction to dermal contact with tea tree oil. Allergic reactions may be due to the various oxidation products that are formed by exposure of the oil to light and/or air.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=616–25 |doi=10.1016/j.fct.2005.09.001 |title=A review of the toxicity of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil |year=2006 |last1=Hammer |first1=K |last2=Carson |first2=C |last3=Riley |first3=T |last4=Nielsen |first4=J |journal=[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pmid=16243420}}</ref><ref name=Aberer2008>{{cite journal|last=Aberer|first=W|title=Contact allergy and medicinal herbs|journal=Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG|date=2008 Jan|volume=6|issue=1|pages=15–24|pmid=17919303}}</ref>

One reported case of transient [[gynecomastia]] in a boy who was using a hair styling gel containing both lavender and tea tree oil suggests that tea tree oil may possess endocrine disrupting activity capable of leading to gynecomastia.
