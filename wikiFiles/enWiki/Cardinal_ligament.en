The '''cardinal ligament''' (or '''Mackenrodt's ligament''',<ref name="isbn1-4160-3699-7">{{cite book |author=Netter, Frank H. |title=Atlas of Human Anatomy, Professional Edition |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |isbn=1-4160-3699-7 |oclc= |doi= |page=370}}</ref> '''lateral cervical ligament''', or '''transverse cervical ligament'''<ref>[http://www.infoplex.northwestern.edu/academic/basicscience/anatomy/labs/12-13_femrs.html Anatomy Labs #12 & 13<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) is a [[major ligament of the uterus]]. It is located at the base of the [[broad ligament of the uterus]]. Importantly, it contains the [[uterine artery]] and [[uterine vein]]. There is a pair of cardinal ligaments in the female human body.

It attaches the [[cervix]] to the lateral pelvic wall by its attachment to the Obturator fascia of the Obturator internus muscle, and is continuous externally with the fibrous tissue that surrounds the pelvic blood vessels.  It thus provides support to the uterus.<ref name="isbn0-7817-5309-0">{{cite book |author=Kyung Won, PhD.

It may be of clinical significance in [[hysterectomy]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kato T, Murakami G, Yabuki Y | title = Does the cardinal ligament of the uterus contain a nerve that should be preserved in radical hysterectomy? | journal = Anat Sci Int | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 161–8 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12422408 | doi = 10.1046/j.0022-7722.2002.00023.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Kato T, Murakami G, Yabuki Y | title = A new perspective on nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy: nerve topography and over-preservation of the cardinal ligament. | journal = Jpn J Clin Oncol | volume = 33 | issue = 11 | pages = 589–91 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14711985 | doi = 10.1093/jjco/hyg107}}</ref> due to its close proximity to the ureters, which can get damaged during ligation of the ligament.
