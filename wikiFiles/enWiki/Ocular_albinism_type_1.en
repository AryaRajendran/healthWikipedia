'''Ocular Albinism type 1''' '''(OA1)''', also called as '''[[Edward Nettleship|Nettleship]]-[[Harold Francis Falls|Falls]] syndrome''', is the most common type of [[Ocular albinism|Ocular Albinism]] with a prevalence rate of 1:50,000.<ref>Oetting, W.S.

==Albinism==
The term ''[[albinism]]'' [L. ''albus'' means ‘white’] refers to a heterogeneous group of congenital disorders in [[melanin]] pigment biogenesis. Pigmentation process maybe affected in one or many ways due to mutations. Abnormal pigmentation maybe at the level of [[embryogenesis]] in regions where melanocytes fail to populate. The melanin biosynthetic pathway may also be affected due to mutations. Sometimes one or many of the genes responsible for biogenesis of organelles may be mutated.<ref>Kushimoto, T., Basrur, V., Valencia, J., Matsunaga, J., Viera, W.D., Ferrans, V.J., Muller, J., Appella, E. and Hearing, V.J. (2001). A model for melanosome biogenesis based on the purification and analysis of early melanosomes. ''Proceedings at the National Academy of Sciences'' '''98(19):'''10698.</ref>

Albinism may manifest itself as oculocutaneous (OCA) or just ocular (OA). There occur at least ten different types of OCA and four types of OA.<ref>Incerti, B., Cortese, K., Pizzigoni, A., Surace, E.M., Varani, S., Coppola, M., Jeffery, G., Seeliger, M., Jaissle, G., Bennett, D.C., Marigo, V., Schiaffino, M.V., Tacchetti, C. and Ballabio, A. (2000). Oa1 knock-out: New insights on the pathogenesis of ocular albinism  type 1. ''Human Molecular Genetics'' '''9(19):'''2781.</ref><ref>Hegde, M., Lewis, R.A. and Richards, C.S. (2002). Diagnostic DNA testing for X-linked ocular albinism (OA1) with a hierarchical mutation screening protocol. ''Genetic Testing'' '''6(1):'''7.</ref> OCA refers to a group of autosomal recessive disorders in which melanin is reduced or even absent leading to pale skin with increased risk of skin cancer. OCA1 is caused due to mutations in tyrosinase gene affecting its catalytic or synthetic activity.<ref>Kushimoto, T., Basrur, V., Valencia, J., Matsunaga, J., Viera, W.D., Ferrans, V.J., Muller, J., Appella, E. and Hearing, V.J. (2001). A model for melanosome biogenesis based on the purification and analysis of early melanosomes. ''Proceedings at the National Academy of Sciences'' '''98(19):'''10698.</ref> OCA2 is a condition where ''TYR'' gene is not mutated but the P polypeptide is. Mutational defects in TRP-1 protein leads to OCA3.

Ocular albinism results from defects in the melanin system, which may arise from either defects in the OA1 receptor, or mutations of either the Tyr gene or P transporter.<ref>Kushimoto, T., Basrur, V., Valencia, J., Matsunaga, J., Viera, W.D., Ferrans, V.J., Muller, J., Appella, E. and Hearing, V.J. (2001). A model for melanosome biogenesis based on the purification and analysis of early melanosomes. ''Proceedings at the National Academy of Sciences'' '''98(19):'''10698.</ref>

==Symptoms==
OA1 is recognized by many different symptoms. Reduced visual acuity is accompanied by involuntary movements of the eye termed as [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]. [[Astigmatism (eye)|Astigmatism]] is a condition wherein there occurs significant refractive error. Moreover, ocular albino eyes become crossed, a condition called as ‘lazy eyes’ or [[strabismus]]. Since very little pigment is present the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] becomes translucent and reflects light back. It appears green to brown. However, the most important part of the eye, the [[fovea]] which is responsible for acute vision, does not develop properly, probably indicating the role of melanin in the development stages of the eye. Some patients may also develop [[photophobia]]/photodysphoria. All these symptoms are due to hypo-pigmentation of the retina. Moreover, in an ocular albino eye, nerves from back of the eye to the brain may not follow usual pattern of routing. In an ocular albino eye, more nerves cross from back of the eye to the opposite side of the brain instead of going to the both sides of the brain as in a normal eye.<ref>www.albinism.org/publications/ocular.html</ref> An ocular albino eye appears orangish pink in color with no pigmentation at all. Carrier women have regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation due to X-inactivation and partial iris transillumination and do not show any other symptoms exhibited by patients suffering from OA1.<ref>Surace, E.M., Angeletti, B., Ballabio, A. and Marigo, V. (2000). Expression pattern of the ocular albinism type 1 (''Oa1'') gene in the murine retinal pigment epithelium. ''Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science'' '''41(13):'''4333.</ref><ref>Lauronen, L., Jalkanen, R., Huttunen, J., Carlsson, E., Tuupanen, S., Lindh, S., Forsius, H., Sankila, E.M. and Alitalo, T. (2005). Abnormal crossing over of the optic fibres shown by evoked magnetic fields in patients with ocular albinism with a novel mutation in the OA1 gene. ''British Journal of Ophthalmology'' '''89:'''820.</ref>

==Microscopic examination==
Microscopic examination of retinal pigment epithelium and skin [[melanocytes]] of patients suffering from OA1 reveal the presence of characteristic macromelanosomes, even though skin appears normal.<ref>Oetting, W.S. and King, R. A.(1999). Molecular basis of albinism: Mutations and polymorphisms of pigmented genes associated with albinism. ''Human Mutations'' '''13:'''99.</ref> Studies from ''Oa1'' knock-out mice reveal that these giant [[melanosomes]] appear due to abnormal growth of a single melanosome and not due to aggregation or fusion of many melanosomes. These melanin macroglobules are probably formed due to failure of melanosomes to separate from the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|ER]]-[[Golgi apparatus|golgi]] system with the accumulation of enzymes and other secretory proteins leading to an increase organelle size. However, Incerti, ''et al.'' contradict the above theory.<ref>Incerti, B., Cortese, K., Pizzigoni, A., Surace, E.M., Varani, S., Coppola, M., Jeffery, G., Seeliger, M., Jaissle, G., Bennett, D.C., Marigo, V., Schiaffino, M.V., Tacchetti, C. and Ballabio, A. (2000). Oa1 knock-out: New insights on the pathogenesis of ocular albinism  type 1. ''Human Molecular Genetics'' '''9(19):'''2781.</ref>

==Treatment==
To date there is no treatment for ocular albinism, probably because such little is known about the receptor function and its role in pathophysiology. Though surgery for strabismus is sometimes helpful, there does not seem to be a sure remedy for it until the etiology of ocular albinism is well established.<ref>www.albinism.org/publications/ocular.html</ref> However, with the recent discovery of the ligand for this receptor and uncovering the OA1 signaling pathway, treatment of OA1 by administering L-DOPA should seem possible.<ref>Lopez, V.M., Decatur, C.L., Stamer, W.D., Lynch, R.M. and McKay, B.S. (2008). L-DOPA is an endogenous ligand for OA1. ''PLoS Biology'' '''6(9):'''e236.</ref>

Touloukian ''et al.'' have characterized OA1 immunologically as a melanoma/melanocyte differentiation antigen.<ref>Shen, B., Rosenberg, B. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). Intracellular distribution and late endosomal effects of the ocular albinism type 1 gene product: Consequences of disease-causing mutations and implications for melanosome biogenesis. ''Traffic''  '''2:'''202.</ref> Flow cytometry data suggests that OA1-specific T cells are all CD8+. This indicates that OA1 peptide is processed and presented on the surface of melanoma cells to be recognized by antigen-specific T cells. Moreover, recognition of OA1 by T cells induces cytokine production by the OA1-specific T cells.This means that OA1 is a potential target for melanoma vaccines.

==Molecular biology of ''Oa1''==
Human ''Oa1'' gene has been identified by positional cloning as a 40kb gene mapped to Xp22.3-Xp22.2.<ref>Shen, B., Samaraweera, P., Rosenberg, B. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). Ocular albinism 1: More than meets the eye. ''Pigment Cell Research'' '''14:'''243.</ref><ref>Oetting, W.S. and King, R. A.(1999). Molecular basis of albinism: Mutations and polymorphisms of pigmented genes associated with albinism. ''Human Mutations'' '''13:'''99.</ref> Later, a mouse homolog of the human ''Oa1'' gene was also identified and cloned. It codes for a 404 amino acid long protein with up to three potential glycosylation sites. The transcript has been found to be expressing very well in retinal pigment epithelium and skin and to a much lesser extent in brain and adrenal glands.<ref>Oetting, W.S. and King, R. A.(1999). Molecular basis of albinism: Mutations and polymorphisms of pigmented genes associated with albinism. ''Human Mutations'' '''13:'''99.</ref>

Mutations in ''Oa1'' have been well characterized and studied using various techniques like [[southern blot]] analyses, [[single-strand conformation polymorphism]] and sequence analysis.<ref>Hegde, M., Lewis, R.A. and Richards, C.S. (2002). Diagnostic DNA testing for X-linked ocular albinism (OA1) with a hierarchical mutation screening protocol. ''Genetic Testing'' '''6(1):'''7.</ref> Most of these mutations have been reported to be occurring in the N-terminus and few in the trans-membrane regions but very rarely in the much conserved cytoplasmic C-terminus. Populations belonging to different ethnic groups have been extensively analyzed and a database has been created recording the details of mutations related to OA1.<ref>www.cbc.umm.edu/tad</ref> A total of 25 missense, 2 nonsense, 9 frameshift, and 5 splicing mutations have been reported till date.<ref>Oetting, W.S. and King, R. A.(1999). Molecular basis of albinism: Mutations and polymorphisms of pigmented genes associated with albinism. ''Human Mutations'' '''13:'''99.</ref> In addition to these mutations, there also occur several deletions in one or many of the exons of ''Oa1'' gene, especially exon 2. These deletions are presumed to be because of unequal crossing-over due to the presence of flanking ''Alu'' regions. In some cases, the entire ''Oa1'' gene is deleted along with other contiguous genes. Many different polymorphisms have also been detected, mainly in intron 1.<ref>Oetting, W.S. and King, R. A.(1999). Molecular basis of albinism: Mutations and polymorphisms of pigmented genes associated with albinism. ''Human Mutations'' '''13:'''99.</ref>

Tissue-specific control of ''Oa1'' transcription is by a 617bp long E-box region bound by Mitf.<ref>Vetrini, F., Auricchio, A., Du, J., Angeletti, B., Fisher, D.E., Ballabio, A. and Marigo, V. (2004). The microphthalmis transcription factor (Mitf) controls expression of the ocular albinism type 1 gene: Link between melanin synthesis and melanosome biogenesis. ''Molecular and Cellular Biology'' '''24(15):'''6550.</ref> Mitf has been shown to regulate expression of many melanosomal genes like TYR and TRP-1 through the E-box motif (CATGTG). Vetrini ''et al.'' have used adenoviral vectors to study tissue-specificity of ''Oa1'' transcription through Mitf and observed that this regulation in conserved in human ''Oa1'' gene.<ref>Vetrini, F., Auricchio, A., Du, J., Angeletti, B., Fisher, D. E., Ballabio, A., Marigo, V. (2004). The microphthalmis transcription factor (Mitf) controls expression of the ocular albinism type 1 gene: link between melanin synthesis and melanosome biogenesis. Mol Cell Biol 24(15): 6550</ref>

==Structure of OA1 protein==
Human ''Oa1'' gene product was initially identified as a 60kDa protein formed from a 46-48kDa precursor.<ref>Shen, B., Samaraweera, P., Rosenberg, B. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). Ocular albinism 1: More than meets the eye. ''Pigment Cell Research'' '''14:'''243.</ref> The OA1 disease is due to defect in the OA1 receptor. This receptor has been shown to be similar to class C [[G protein-coupled receptor|G- protein coupled receptors]] (GPCR). OA1 receptor has a characteristic GPCR structure-7 transmembrane helices with 3 cytoplasmic loops and 3 extracellular loops and an extracellular N- terminus and cytoplasmic C-terminus. Recently the ligand activating this receptor was found.<ref>Lopez, V.M., Decatur, C.L., Stamer, W.D., Lynch, R.M. and McKay, B.S. (2008). L-DOPA is an endogenous ligand for OA1. ''PLoS Biology'' '''6(9):'''e236.</ref> A recent computational work has provided some insight into the three dimensional structure of this protein and its dynamic interactions with its known ligands.<ref>Ghosh, A., Sonavane, U., Andhirka, S.K., Aradhyam, G.K., Joshi, R. (2012). Structural insights into human GPCR protein OA1: a computational perspective. ''Journal of Molecular Modeling'' '''18(5):2117'''.</ref>

==Localization of the OA1 protein==
Shen, ''et al.'' created fusion proteins between OA1 and GFP.<ref>Shen, B., Samaraweera, P., Rosenberg, B. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). Ocular albinism 1: More than meets the eye. ''Pigment Cell Research'' '''14:'''243.</ref> Melanosomal localization of OA1 has been confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy and other techniques alike. Localization patterns of wild type OA1-GFP and mutated OA1-GFP were compared. The wild type OA1 localized to late endosomal or lysosomal compartments. This is supported by data from Samaraweera, ''et al.'' that OA1 colocalizes with Lamp1, which is a marker for late endosomal compartment. Hence, OA1 might traffick itself out of this compartment to the melanosomes.<ref>Samaraweera, P., Shen, B., Newton, J.M., Barsh, G.S. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). The mouse ocular albinism 1 gene product is an endolysosomal protein. ''Experimental Eye Research'' '''72:'''319.</ref>

In addition to retina and melanoma, OA1 protein product was also detected in human pigment cells like melanosomal membrane glycoprotein.<ref>Incerti, B., Cortese, K., Pizzigoni, A., Surace, E.M., Varani, S., Coppola, M., Jeffery, G., Seeliger, M., Jaissle, G., Bennett, D.C., Marigo, V., Schiaffino, M.V., Tacchetti, C. and Ballabio, A. (2000). Oa1 knock-out: New insights on the pathogenesis of ocular albinism  type 1. ''Human Molecular Genetics'' '''9(19):'''2781.</ref> This suggests that OA1 might be involved in melanosome biogenesis. Coimmunoprecipitation studies of OA1 with G<sub>β</sub> and G<sub>αi</sub> in melanocyte extracts revealed its specific interaction with G<sub>αi</sub>.<ref>Oetting, W.S. (2002). New insights into ocular albinism type 1(OA1): Mutations and polymorphisms of the ''Oa1'' gene. ''Human Mutations'' '''19:'''85.</ref>  Moreover, since OA1 is an organellar GPCR, it may represent an unidentified pathway in the melanosome. Until recently, it was believed that the probable ligand for OA1 might be within the melanosomal lumen, maybe one of the components of the melanogenic pathway since it is so closely related to melanosome biogenesis.<ref>Incerti, B., Cortese, K., Pizzigoni, A., Surace, E.M., Varani, S., Coppola, M., Jeffery, G., Seeliger, M., Jaissle, G., Bennett, D.C., Marigo, V., Schiaffino, M.V., Tacchetti, C. and Ballabio, A. (2000). Oa1 knock-out: New insights on the pathogenesis of ocular albinism  type 1. ''Human Molecular Genetics'' '''9(19):'''2781.</ref> This has been proved now.<ref>Lopez, V.M., Decatur, C.L., Stamer, W.D., Lynch, R.M. and McKay, B.S. (2008). L-DOPA is an endogenous ligand for OA1. ''PLoS Biology'' '''6(9):'''e236.</ref>

Studies by Samaraweera, ''et al.'' revealed OA1 as an endolysosomal protein.<ref>Samaraweera, P., Shen, B., Newton, J.M., Barsh, G.S. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). The mouse ocular albinism 1 gene product is an endolysosomal protein. ''Experimental Eye Research'' '''72:'''319.</ref> Schiaffino, ''et al.'' already proved that it is an integral membrane protein.<ref>Schiaffino, M.V., d'Addio, M.,  Alloni, A., Baschirotto, C., Valetti, C., Cortese, K., Puri, C., Bassi, M.T., Colla, C., De Luca, M., Tacchetti, C. and Ballabio, A. (1999). Ocular albinism: Evidence for a defect in an intracellular signal transduction system. ''Nature Genetics'' '''23:'''108.</ref> Newton ''et al.'' have shown that it has three probable glycosylation sites.<ref>Newton, J.M., Orlow, S.J. and Barsh, G.S. (1996). Isolation and characterization of a mouse homolog of the X-linked ocular albinism (OA1) gene. ''Genomics'' '''37:'''219.</ref> Furthermore, OA1 was found to be stimulated by α-melanocortin stimulating hormone but inhibited by agouti signal protein.<ref>Samaraweera, P., Shen, B., Newton, J.M., Barsh, G.S. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). The mouse ocular albinism 1 gene product is an endolysosomal protein. ''Experimental Eye Research'' '''72:'''319.</ref> The fact that OA1 responds to melanin modifiers indicates its probable role in melanogenesis. Just like other melanosomal proteins TYR and TRP-1, processing of OA1 also occurs in the golgi.<ref>d'Addio, M., Pizzigoni, A., Bassi, M.T., Baschirotto, C., Valetti, C., Incerti, B., Clementi, M., De Luca, M., Ballabio, A. and Schiaffino, M.V. (2000). Defective intracellular transport and processing of OA1 is a major cause of ocular albinism type 1. ''Human Molecular Genetics'' '''9(20):'''3011.</ref> Endogenous OA1 protein expressed by normal human melanocytes is detected as a 60kDa protein.

==Receptor-Ligand interactions==
Very recently the orphan OA1 receptor has been de-orphaned. Studies showed that L-DOPA is the specific ligand for the OA1 receptor.<ref>Gross, L. (2008). A molecular link between albinism and visual deficits. ''PLoS Biology'' '''6(9):'''e248.</ref> L-DOPA is a by-product of melanin biosynthetic pathway. During melanin synthesis, L-DOPA is released to the retina in the retinal pigment epithelium and is necessary for specific stages of retinal development. Activation of the OA1 receptor by L-DOPA leads to the secretion of a neurotropic factor by the retinal pigment epithelium that helps in normal retinal development.<ref>Lopez, V.M., Decatur, C.L., Stamer, W.D., Lynch, R.M. and McKay, B.S. (2008). L-DOPA is an endogenous ligand for OA1. ''PLoS Biology'' '''6(9):'''e236.</ref>

==Mutations==
The OA1 mutants were classified into two major groups based on glycosylation and localization patterns. While group I consisted of normally glycosylated OA1, group II represented aberrantly glycosylated OA1 which is indistinguishable from the wild type.<ref>Shen, B., Samaraweera, P., Rosenberg, B. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). Ocular albinism 1: More than meets the eye. ''Pigment Cell Research'' '''14:'''243.</ref> However, both these studies revealed that in >60% of these mutations, the protein was retained in the ER and which is assumed to be the major cause of OA1. They also revealed that the protein levels decreased drastically, probably due to misfolding of the protein in the ER. Some of the mutations reported in second and third cytoplasmic loops (these regions are known to be critical for GPCR downstream signaling) are believed to affect transduction of the signals from OA1 via G proteins.<ref>Shen, B., Samaraweera, P., Rosenberg, B. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). Ocular albinism 1: More than meets the eye. ''Pigment Cell Research'' '''14:'''243.</ref><ref>d'Addio, M., Pizzigoni, A., Bassi, M.T., Baschirotto, C., Valetti, C., Incerti, B., Clementi, M., De Luca, M., Ballabio, A. and Schiaffino, M.V. (2000). Defective intracellular transport and processing of OA1 is a major cause of ocular albinism type 1. ''Human Molecular Genetics'' '''9(20):'''3011.</ref>

==Functions of OA1==
Though the exact role of OA1 is yet to be confirmed, many studies give clues about the probable roles of OA1. The ''Oa1'' gene product might be involved in vesicular trafficking or sorting them to the melanosomes.<ref>Samaraweera, P., Shen, B., Newton, J.M., Barsh, G.S. and Orlow, S.J. (2001). The mouse ocular albinism 1 gene product is an endolysosomal protein. ''Experimental Eye Research'' '''72:'''319.</ref> It is also believed to be involved in redistribution of mannose-6-phosphate receptors, thus suggesting that it is important for melanogensis.<ref>Oetting, W.S. (2002). New insights into ocular albinism type 1(OA1): Mutations and polymorphisms of the ''Oa1'' gene. ''Human Mutations'' '''19:'''85.</ref> Literature shows that it plays a major role in the final stages of growth and maturation of melanosomes. This conclusion is based on the fact that there are no intermediates of melanosome-melanosome fusion and the number of melanosomes decreases only on maturation of the cell and not in the initial stages of development. A number of genes in Drosophila, like the ''hook'' gene that alter ocular pigment granules have been shown to affect lysosomal delivery.<ref>Oetting, W.S. and King, R. A.(1999). Molecular basis of albinism: Mutations and polymorphisms of pigmented genes associated with albinism. ''Human Mutations'' '''13:'''99.</ref> Moreover, it has been found that in normal conditions, melanosomal proteins traffic normally to late endosomes, while in the absence of OA1, they continue to accumulate in the mature melanosomes. This may mean that OA1 acts as a stop signal for melanosomal growth.<ref>Shen, B., Rosenberg, B., and Orlow, S.J. (2001).
