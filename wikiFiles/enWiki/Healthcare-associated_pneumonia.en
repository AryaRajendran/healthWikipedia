In [[medicine]], '''healthcare-associated pneumonia''' (HCAP) is a category of [[pneumonia]] in patients with recent close contact with the health care system.

HCAP is a condition in patients who are not hospitalised (similar to [[community-acquired pneumonia]], CAP) but its causes, prognosis, prevention and treatment are more similar to [[hospital-acquired pneumonia]] (HAP).<ref name="pmid15526736"/> The category was introduced because healthcare has increasingly shifted from hospital-based to home care, and more people are residing in [[nursing home]]s or extended care facilities.

'''Nursing home-acquired pneumonia''' is an important subgroup of HCAP. Residents of long term care facilities may become infected through their contacts with the healthcare system; as such, the [[microbe]]s responsible for their pneumonias may be different from those traditionally seen in community-dwelling patients, requiring therapy with different [[antibiotics]]. Other groups include patients who are admitted as a day case for regular [[hemodialysis]] or [[intravenous infusion]] (for example, [[chemotherapy]]). Especially in the very old and in [[dementia|demented]] patients, HCAP is likely to present with atypical symptoms.<ref name="pmid15021052">{{cite journal |author=Loeb M |title=Pneumonia in the elderly |journal=Curr.

Compared to subjects with CAP, the pneumonia in HCAP is more likely to be caused by [[bacteria]] [[antimicrobial resistance|resistant]] to first line [[antibiotics]], such as [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA) or [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]. The optimal antibiotic strategy for the treatment of HCAP remains controversial.

HCAP was first suggested as a novel category of pneumonia in 2005 by the [[American Thoracic Society]] and [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]].<ref name="guidelines"/>

==Definition==
Healthcare-associated pneumonia can be defined as pneumonia in a patient with at least one of the following risk factors:
* hospitalization in an acute care [[hospital]] for two or more days in the last 90 days;
* residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility in the last 30 days
* receiving outpatient [[intravenous]] therapy (like [[antibiotics]] or [[chemotherapy]]) within the past 30 days
* receiving home wound care within the past 30 days
* attending a hospital clinic or [[dialysis]] center in the last 30 days
* having a family member with known [[multi-drug resistant]] [[pathogen]]s<ref>{{cite web|title=IDSA guidelines|url=http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedFiles/IDSA/Guidelines-Patient_Care/PDF_Library/HAP.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref> 

Although patients with HCAP may have more severe disease than those with classic CAP, disease severity does not determine if a patient has HCAP or not; the label HCAP is merely an indicator of risk factors for multi-drug resistant bacteria.

A recent study defined HCAP as admittance to a hospital or underwent surgery in the past 180 days, based on the observation that colonization with hospital-acquired bacteria can occur for extended periods.<ref name="pmid19124816">{{cite journal |author=Venditti M, Falcone M, Corrao S, Licata G, Serra P |title=Outcomes of patients hospitalized with community-acquired, health care-associated, and hospital-acquired pneumonia |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=150 |issue=1 |pages=19–26 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19124816 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19124816}}</ref>

==Causes==
The bacteria found in patients with HCAP are more similar to HAP than to CAP; compared to CAP, they have higher rates of [[Staphylococcus aureus]] (S. aureus) and [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]], and less [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] and [[Haemophilus influenzae]]. It is well known that nursing home residents have high rates of [[Colonization (biology)|colonization]] with MRSA. However, not all studies have found high rates of S. aureus and [[gram-negative bacteria]].<ref name="LTCF-pneumonia"/> One factor responsible for these differences is the reliance on sputum samples and the strictness of the criteria to discriminate between colonising or disease-causing bacteria.<ref name="pmid16823991">{{cite journal |author=Mylotte JM |title=Nursing home-acquired pneumonia: update on treatment options |journal=Drugs Aging |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=377–90 |year=2006 |pmid=16823991 |doi= 10.2165/00002512-200623050-00002|url=}}</ref> Moreover, sputum samples might be less frequently obtained in the elderly.<ref name="pmid15526736"/>

[[Aspiration pneumonia|Aspiration]] (both of microscopic drops and macroscopic amounts of [[nasopharynx|nose and throat]] secretions) is thought to be the most important cause of HCAP. [[Dental plaque]] might also be a reservoir for bacteria in HCAP.<ref name="pmid15909270">{{cite journal |author=Terpenning M |title=Geriatric oral health and pneumonia risk |journal=Clin. Infect.

==Treatment==
Patients with HCAP are more likely than those with community-acquired pneumonia to receive inappropriate antibiotics that do not target the bacteria causing their disease.

In 2002, an expert panel made recommendations about the evaluation and treatment of probable nursing home-acquired pneumonia.<ref name="pmid12184969">{{cite journal |author=Hutt E, Kramer AM |title=Evidence-based guidelines for management of nursing home-acquired pneumonia |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=709–16 |year=2002 |month=August |pmid=12184969 |doi= |url=http://www.jfponline.com/Pages.asp?AID=1275}}</ref> They defined probably pneumonia, emphasized expedite antibiotic treatment (which is known to improve survival) and drafted criteria for the hospitalization of willing patients.

For initial treatment in the nursing home, a [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotic suitable for respiratory infections ([[moxifloxacin]], for example), or [[amoxicillin with clavulanic acid]] plus a [[macrolide]] has been suggested.<ref name="pmid16823991"/> In a hospital setting, injected ([[parenteral]]) fluoroquinolones or a second- or third-generation [[cephalosporin]] plus a macrolide could be used.<ref name="pmid16823991"/> Other factors that need to be taken into account are recent antibiotic therapy (because of possible resistance caused by recent exposure), known carrier state or risk factors for resistant organisms (for example, known carrier of MRSA or presence of [[bronchiectasis]] predisposing to [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]), or suspicion of possible [[Legionella pneumophila]] infection (legionnaires disease).<ref name="TVG.be">{{nl}} {{cite journal |author=Depuydt P, Vogelaers D |title=Nosocomial pneumonia outside the hospital: health-care associated pneumonia and nursing home pneumonia |journal=Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde (Belgium) |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=174–181 |year=2007 |month= |doi=10.2143/TVG.63.05.2000033 |url=}}</ref>

In 2005, the [[American Thoracic Society]] and [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] have published guidelines suggesting antibiotics specifically for HCAP.<ref name="guidelines">{{cite journal |author=American Thoracic Society; Infectious Diseases Society of America. |title=Guidelines for the management of adults with hospital-acquired, ventilator-associated, and healthcare-associated pneumonia |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=388–416 |year=2005 |pmid=15699079 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200405-644ST}}</ref> The guidelines recommend combination therapy with an agent from each of the following groups to cover for both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA. This is based on studies using [[sputum]] samples and [[intensive care]] patients, in whom these bacteria were commonly found.
* [[cefepime]], [[ceftazidime]], [[imipenem]], [[meropenem]] or [[Piperacillin/tazobactam|piperacillin–tazobactam]]; plus
* [[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]], [[amikacin]], [[gentamicin]], or [[tobramycin]]; plus
* [[linezolid]] or [[vancomycin]]

In one observational study, empirical antibiotic treatment that was not according to international treatment guidelines was an independent predictor of worse outcome among HCAP patients.<ref name="pmid19124816"/>

Guidelines from Canada suggest that HCAP can be treated like community-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics targeting [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]], based on studies using [[blood culture]]s in different settings which have not found high rates of MRSA or Pseudomonas.<ref name="pmid15993675">{{cite journal |author=Grossman RF, Rotschafer JC, Tan JS |title=Antimicrobial treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in the hospital setting |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=118 Suppl 7A |issue= 7|pages=29S–38S |year=2005 |month=July |pmid=15993675 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.05.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9343(05)00385-2}}</ref>

Besides prompt antibiotic treatment, supportive measure for organ failure (such as [[heart failure|cardiac decompensation]]) are also important. Another consideration goes to hospital referral; although more severe pneumonia requires admission to an acute care facility, this also predisposes to hazards of hospitalization such as [[delirium]], [[urinary incontinence]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[falls in older adults|falls]], restraint use, functional decline, [[adverse drug effect]]s and [[nosocomial infection|hospital infections]].<ref name="pmid18299494">{{cite journal |author=Fernandez HM, Callahan KE, Likourezos A, Leipzig RM |title=House staff member awareness of older inpatients' risks for hazards of hospitalization |journal=Arch.

==Prognosis==
Healthcare-associated pneumonia seems to have [[fatality rate]]s similar to hospital-acquired pneumonia, worse than community-acquired pneumonia but less severe than pneumonia in ventilated patients.<ref name="Chest2005"/> Besides clinical markers like [[tachypnea]] (fast breathing) or a high white cell count ([[leukocytosis]]), the prognosis seems to be influenced by the underlying associated diseases ([[comorbidity|comorbidities]]) and functional capacities (for example, the [[Activities of daily living|ADL score]]).<ref name="pmid9789516">{{cite journal |author=Mehr DR, Zweig SC, Kruse RL, ''et al.'' |title=Mortality from lower respiratory infection in nursing home residents.

==Epidemiology==
Several studies found that healthcare-associated pneumonia is the second most common type of pneumonia, occurring less commonly than community-acquired pneumonia but more frequently than hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia. In a recent observational study, the rates for CAP, HCAP and HAP were 60%, 25% and 15% respectively.<ref name="pmid19124816"/> Patients with HCAP are older and more commonly have simultaneous health problems (such as previous [[stroke]], [[heart failure]] and [[diabetes]]).<ref name="Chest2005">{{cite journal |author=Kollef MH, Shorr A, Tabak YP, Gupta V, Liu LZ, Johannes RS |title=Epidemiology and outcomes of health-care-associated pneumonia: results from a large US database of culture-positive pneumonia |journal=Chest |volume=128 |issue=6 |pages=3854–62 |year=2005 |pmid=16354854 |doi=10.1378/chest.128.6.3854}}</ref>

The number of residents in long term care facilities is expected to rise dramatically over the next 30 years.
