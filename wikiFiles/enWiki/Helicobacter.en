'''''Helicobacter''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Gram-negative]] [[bacteria]] possessing a characteristic [[helix]] shape. They were initially considered to be members of the ''[[Campylobacter]]'' genus, but since 1989 they have been grouped in their own genus. The ''Helicobacter'' genus belongs to class ''Epsilonproteobacteria'', order ''Campylobacterales'', family ''Helicobacteraceae'' and already involves &gt;35 species.<ref name= BoyanovaL>{{cite book | author= Boyanova, L (editor) | year=2011 | title=Helicobacter pylori | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-84-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1099/00207713-39-4-397 | author = Goodwin CS, Armstrong JA, Chilvers T, ''et al.'' | title = Transfer of ''Campylobacter pylori'' and ''Campylobacter mustelae'' to ''Helicobacter'' gen. nov. as ''Helicobacter pylori'' comb. nov. and ''Helicobacter mustelae'' comb. nov., respectively| journal = Int.

==Molecular signatures==

Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 11 proteins which are uniquely found in members of the family ''Helicobacteraceae''. Of these proteins, 7 are found in all species of the family, while the remaining 4 are not found in any ''Helicobacter'' strains and are unique to ''Wollinella''.<ref name= Gupta >Gupta, R. S.

==Non-''pylori Helicobacter'' species==
Recently, new gastric (''Helicobacter suis'' and ''Helicobacter baculiformis'') and enterohepatic (''Helicobacter equorum'') species have been reported. ''Helicobacter pylori'' is of primary importance for medicine; however, non-''pylori'' ''Helicobacter'' species (NPHS), which naturally inhabit mammals (except humans) and birds, have been detected in human clinical specimens. NPHS encompass two (gastric and enterohepatic) groups, showing different organ specificity. Importantly, some species such as ''Helicobacter hepaticus, Helicobacter mustelae'' and, probably, ''Helicobacter bilis'' exhibit carcinogenic potential in animals. NPHS harbour many [[virulence]] genes and may cause diseases not only in animals but also in humans. Gastric NPHS such as ''H. suis'' (most often)'', Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter bizzozeronii'' and ''Helicobacter salomonis'' have been associated with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers in humans and, importantly, with higher risk for MALT lymphoma compared to ''H. pylori''. Enterohepatic species e.g., ''H. hepaticus,'' ''H. bilis'' and ''Helicobacter ganmani'' have been detected by [[PCR]] in but still not isolated from specimens of patients with hepatobiliary diseases. Moreover, NPHS may be associated with [[Crohn's disease]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]]. The significance of avian helicobacters (''Helicobacter pullorum, Helicobacter anseris'' and ''Helicobacter brantae)'' also has been evaluated extensively. NPHS such as ''Helicobacter'' ''cinaedi'' and ''Helicobacter canis'' can cause severe infections, mostly in immunocompromised patients with animal exposure. Briefly, the role of NPHS in veterinary and human medicine is increasingly recognised. However, despite the growing interest in the possible association between NPHS and the chronic hepatobiliary or intestinal diseases in humans, more studies are still required to prove the suggested association. Several other topics such as isolation of still uncultured species, [[antibiotic resistance]] and treatment regimens for NPHS infections and, last but not least, NPHS pathogenesis and possible carcinogenesis in humans should be additionally evaluated.<ref name="BoyanovaL" />
