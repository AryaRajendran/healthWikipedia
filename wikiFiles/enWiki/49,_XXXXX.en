'''XXXXX syndrome''' (also called '''pentasomy X''' or '''49,XXXXX''') is the presence of three additional [[X chromosome]]s. Diagnosis is done by [[karyotyping]]. Approximately 25 females have been described in medical literature worldwide with this extremely rare condition. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The condition was first described in 1963. XXXXX syndrome is a type of [[aneuploidy]] (an abnormal number of chromosomes).

==Effects==
===Physical traits===
XXXXX syndrome is associated with [[microcephaly]] (undersized skull), [[micrognathia]] (undersized jaw), and round face. The ears are generally low-set and malformed. Eyes are upslanting and show [[palpebral fissures]], [[hypertelorism]], and [[strabismus]]. Usually the nose is shaped with a broad and depressed nasal bridge and [[epicanthus]], with the mouth having a [[Cleft palate|cleft]] and highly arched palate, dental abnormalities, and thick, furrowed, and everted lips. The neck is [[Webbed neck|webbed]], much like the neck of a woman with [[Turner's syndrome]].
The hands and feet are small with overlapping toes, [[camptodactyly]], [[clinodactyly]], [[talipes equinovarus]], and [[metatarsus varus]]. [[Scoliosis]] generally affects the spine and [[hypotonia]] affects the muscles.

===Internal organs===
The heart is usually affected by [[patent ductus arteriosus]], [[atrial septal defect]], [[ventricular septal defect]], and [[aortic dextroposition]]. There is abnormal [[lobulation]] of the lungs and [[neonatal]] [[asphyxia]]. The [[ovaries]] are abnormally shaped with a small uterus and kidney [[hypoplasia]].

===Growth and development===
XXXXX syndrome causes mental, growth, and motor retardation. There is occasional delayed puberty.
Behavior and performance is affected by [[opisthotonoid posture]].  Recent observations have indicated an average of a 10 to 15 IQ point decrease for each extra X chromosome.  Thus, the average IQ of XXXXX individuals tends to be between 55 and 70.<ref>[http://www.genealogysource.com/tetra_x/information.htm Tetrasomy & Pentasomy X Syndrome Information and Support]</ref>
