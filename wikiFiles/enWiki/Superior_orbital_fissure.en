The '''superior orbital fissure''' is a [[Foramina of the skull|foramen]] in the [[human skull|skull]], although strictly it is more of a cleft, lying between the [[Small wings of the sphenoid|lesser]] and [[Great wings of the sphenoid|greater wings]] of the [[Sphenoid bone|sphenoid]] [[bone]].

==Structures passing through==
A number of important [[anatomy|anatomical]] structures pass through the fissure, and these can be damaged in [[orbit (anatomy)|orbital]] trauma, particularly [[blowout fracture]]s through the floor of the orbit into the [[maxillary sinus]]. These structures are:
* superior and inferior divisions of [[oculomotor nerve]] (III) 
* [[trochlear nerve]] (IV) 
* [[lacrimal nerve|lacrimal]], [[frontal nerve|frontal]] and [[nasociliary nerve|nasociliary]] branches of [[ophthalmic ]] (V<sub>1</sub>).
* [[abducens nerve]] (VI) 
* superior and inferior divisions of [[ophthalmic vein]].  Inferior division also passes through the [[inferior orbital fissure]].
* [[sympathetic fibers]] from [[cavernous plexus]]
These include nonvisual sensory messages, such as pain, or motor nerves.  They also serve as vascular connections.  <ref>"eye, human."Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] </ref>

The nerves passing through the fissure can be remembered with the [[mnemonic]], "'''L'''ive '''F'''rankly '''T'''o '''S'''ee '''A'''bsolutely '''N'''o '''I'''nsult" - for '''L'''acrimal, '''F'''rontal, '''T'''rochlear, '''S'''uperior Division of Oculomotor, '''A'''bducens, '''N'''asociliary and '''I'''nferior Division of Oculomotor nerve. <ref name="LHC">{{cite web | url = http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/18/superior-orbital-fissure-structures-passing-through | title = Superior orbital fissure: Structures passing through | publisher = LifeHugger | accessdate = 2009-12-11}}</ref> 

It is divided into 3 parts from lateral to medial:
Lateral Part transmits:  [[lacrimal nerve]], [[frontal nerve]], [[trochlear nerve]], meningeal branch of [[lacrimal artery]], anastomotic branch of [[middle meningeal artery]] which anastomoses with recurrent branch of the lacrimal artery
Middle Part transmits:  Upper and lower divisions of the [[oculomotor nerve]], [[nasociliary nerve]] between the two divisions of oculomotor nerve and [[abducent nerve]]
Medial Part transmits:  [[Superior ophthalmic vein]] and sympathetic nerves from the plexus around [[internal carotid artery]]

==Pathology==
The abducens nerve is most likely to show [[sign (medicine)|sign]]s of damage first, with the most common complaints retro-orbital [[pain]] and the involvement of cranial nerves III, IV, V1, and VI without other neurological signs or symptoms. This presentation indicates either compression of structures in the superior orbital fissure or the [[cavernous sinus]].

===Superior orbital fissure syndrome===
'''Superior orbital fissure syndrome''', also known as '''Rochon-Duvigneaud's syndrome''', <ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3387}}</ref><ref>A. Rochon-Duvigneaud. Quelques cas de paralysie de tous les nerfs orbitaires (ophthalmoplegie totale avec amaurosse en anesthésie dans le domaine de l’ophthalmique d’origine syphilitique). Archives d'ophthalmologie, Paris, 1896, 16: 746-760.</ref> is a neurological disorder that results if the superior orbital fissure is [[fracture]]d. Involvement of the cranial nerves that pass through the superior orbital fissure may lead to [[diplopia]], [[paralysis]] of extraocular motions, [[exophthalmos]], and [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]. [[Blindness]] or loss of vision indicates involvement of the orbital apex, which is more serious, requiring urgent surgical intervention. Typically, if blindness is present with superior orbital syndrome, it is called orbital apex syndrome.
