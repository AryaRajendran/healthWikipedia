'''Hyperammonemia''' (or '''hyperammonaemia''') is a metabolic disturbance characterised by an excess of [[ammonia]] in the blood. It is a dangerous condition that may lead to [[encephalopathy]] and death. It may be primary or secondary.

Ammonia is a substance that contains [[nitrogen]]. It is a product of the [[catabolism]] of [[protein]]. It is converted to the less toxic substance [[urea]] prior to [[excretion]] in [[urine]] by the [[kidney]]s. The metabolic pathways that synthesize urea are located first in the [[mitochondria]] and then into the cytosol. The process is known as the [[urea cycle]], which comprises several enzymes acting in sequence.

==Types==
===Primary vs. secondary===
* Primary hyperammonemia is caused by several [[inborn errors of metabolism]] that are characterised by reduced activity of any of the [[enzyme]]s in the [[urea cycle]].
* Secondary hyperammonemia is caused by inborn errors of intermediary [[metabolism]] characterised by reduced activity in enzymes that are not part of the urea cycle (e.g. .[[Propionic acidemia]], [[Methylmalonic acidemia]]) or dysfunction of cells that make major contributions to metabolism (e.g. hepatic failure).

===Specific types===

The following list includes such examples:

* {{OMIM|311250}} - hyperammonemia due to [[ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency]]
* {{OMIM|606762}} - hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome ([[glutamate dehydrogenase 1]])
* {{OMIM|238970}} - hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome ([[ornithine translocase]])
* {{OMIM|237310}} - hyperammonemia due to [[N-acetylglutamate synthetase deficiency]]
* {{OMIM|237300}} - hyperammonemia due to [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency]] ([[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I]])
* {{OMIM|238750}} - hyperlysinuria with hyperammonemia (genetics unknown)
* Methylmalonic acidemia
* Isovalemic acidemia
* Propionic acidemia
* [[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency]]
* [[Transient hyperammonemia of the newborn]], specifically in the preterm.

==Treatment==
Treatment centers on limiting intake of ammonia and increasing its excretion. Dietary protein (a source of ammonium) is restricted and caloric intake is provided by glucose and fat. Intravenous sodium phenylacetate and [[sodium benzoate]] are pharmacologic agents commonly used as adjunctive therapy to treat hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle enzyme deficiencies.<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/TOPIC162.HTM eMedicine - Hyperammonemia : Article by Kazi Imran Majeed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate can serve as alternatives to urea for the excretion of waste nitrogen. Phenylacetate conjugates with [[glutamine]] to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys. Similarly, sodium benzoate reduces ammonia content in the blood by conjugating with [[glycine]] to form [[hippuric acid]], which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys.<ref>[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/ammonul_cp.htm Ammonul (Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection) clinical pharmacology - prescription drugs and medications at RxList<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A preparation containing sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate is available under the trade name Ammonul.
Acidification of the intestinal lumen using lactulose can decrease ammonia levels by protonating ammonia and trapping it in the stool.  This is a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.

Treatment of severe hyperammonemia (serum ammonia levels greater than 1000 μmol/L) should begin with [[hemodialysis]] if it is otherwise medically appropriate and tolerated.<ref>[http://www.expertconsultbook.com/expertconsult/ob/book.do?method=display&type=bookPage&decorator=none&eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-4252-5..50307-5--cebib1&isbn=978-1-4160-4252-5 CHAPTER 298 – Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy] in: {{cite book |author=John J.

==Sequelae==
Hyperammonemia is one of the metabolic derangements that contribute to [[hepatic encephalopathy]].
