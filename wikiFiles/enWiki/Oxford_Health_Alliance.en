The '''Oxford Health Alliance (OxHA)''' is a charitable organisation based in [[London]], UK, and with a global network of participants. Its aim is to reduce the global impact of the epidemic of four major [[chronic disease]]s – [[diabetes]], [[heart disease]], [[lung disease]]s and some cancers – which are caused by three risk factors: tobacco use, and poor diet and lack of [[physical activity]] that lead to [[obesity]]. The four chronic diseases together account for over 50% of deaths in the world.<ref>See, for example, the World Health Organisation's website on [http://www.who.int/chp/en/ chronic diseases and health promotion].</ref>

OxHA enables collaboration between experts and activists from a wide range of disciplines in order to raise awareness and change behaviours, policies and perspectives about the epidemic of chronic disease at every level of society. OxHA advocates and facilitates action and collaboration and encourages research about the risk factors and chronic disease prevention to promote health at local, national and international levels.

OxHA was founded in 2003 under the name Oxford Vision 2020. It was renamed 'the Oxford Health Alliance' in early 2005.

==Focus areas==

In particular, OxHA focuses on five topics central to the prevention of chronic disease and reducing the risk factors - the organisation's work in these areas promotes translating compelling evidence into practical and actionable solutions. OxHA assembles and promotes evidence in each area, in conjunction with a network of experts and partner organisations.

*The economic argument for prevention: the costs of chronic disease are already vast, and without urgent action these costs will continue to increase.<ref>[http://www.oxha.org/initiatives/economics/chronic-disease-an-economic-perspective Chronic Disease: An Economic Perspective] (OxHA 2006) and [http://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/en/index.html Preventing Chronic Diseases: A Vital Investment] (WHO 2005).</ref>
*Prevention in the workplace: chronic disease risk reduction in the workplace can have a major impact on the health of employees and their families, while also demonstrating social responsibility and improving productivity.
*Youth, children and future health: the insights and enthusiasm of young people can change perceptions and lifestyles of future generations. 
*Environmental design for prevention: designers, architects and urban planners can assist in creating an environment in which the healthy choices are the easy choices.
*Industry’s role in prevention: prevention efforts by companies and industries can have a far-reaching effect on consumers and communities.

==Annual Summits==
OxHA convenes its members at annual summits to generate ideas, provoke dialogue and stimulate effective action.

The 2006 meeting was held in [[Cape Town]], South Africa on the theme of 'Health in transition: working together'. It gave particular focus to the developing world and to ways in which the alliance can use the technology offered by new media, including the launch of 3four50.com.
