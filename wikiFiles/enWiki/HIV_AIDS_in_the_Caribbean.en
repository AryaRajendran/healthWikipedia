Different countries have employed a variety of responses to the disease, with a range of challenges and successes.

==Overview==
Although the exact origin of the disease is unknown, the HIV epidemic in the Caribbean most likely began in the 1970s. The first reported AIDS case occurred in Jamaica in 1982, followed by eight cases among [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men in Trinidad and Tobago. In the early days of the epidemic, more men were affected than women.<ref name="Figueroa">[http://caribbean.scielo.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0043-31442008000300008&lng=en "The HIV epidemic in the Caribbean: meeting the challenges of achieving universal access to prevention, treatment and care", ''West Indian Medical Journal'', J. P. Figueroa, 57(3), 2008]</ref>{{rp|page: 196}} By 1985, however, HIV/AIDS clearly was becoming a general population issue and was no longer a disease solely of gay or bisexual men.<ref name="Howe">''The Caribbean AIDS Epidemic'', edited by Glenford Deroy Howe and Alan Gregor Cobley, University of the West Indies Press, Kingston, Jamaica, 2000, page 2</ref> Contrary to popular belief, the primary mode of HIV transmission in the region is heterosexual sex.<ref name="Beck"/> The number of new HIV infections among women became and continues to be higher than those among men.<ref name="Beck"/> Currently, the Caribbean is the only area outside of Sub-Saharan Africa where women and girls outnumber men and boys living with HIV.<ref name="UNAIDS"/> 

Among adults aged 15–44, AIDS is the leading cause of death.<ref name="Beck"/> Between 2001 and 2009, new infections slightly declined.<ref name="UNAIDS"/> There is a large degree of variation of HIV prevalence between the 21 Caribbean countries. Currently, there are five countries where the national prevalence is over 2 percent, those being the [[Bahamas]], [[Belize]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].<ref name="Cohen">Cohen, J. (2006). HIV/AIDS: Latin America & Caribbean. Overview: the overlooked	epidemic. Science (New York, N.Y.),313(5786), 468-469.</ref> In [[Jamaica]] and [[Barbados]], the HIV rate is estimated to be about 1.5 percent, while in [[Cuba]] the rate is under 0.2 percent.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 106}} The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Caribbean appears to have been overshadowed by the seemingly more severe problems in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the countries with more active and highly visible activism.<ref name="Cohen"/>

==Causes and spread==

===Social factors===

A variety of social factors have perpetuated the spread and worsened the severity of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean. Many persons are at increased risk of HIV infection because of their [[social vulnerability]], arising from [[poverty]], [[illiteracy]] or limited education, [[unemployment]], gender inequity, and sexual orientation.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 199}} HIV/AIDS can weaken the national education system, perpetuating the spread of the disease by hindering efforts to educate the public about the disease. Furthermore, a weak political response by the government can result in ineffective programs.<ref name="Kelly">Kelly, M. J., & Bain, B. (2004). CHAPTER 2: The HIV/AIDS Epidemic in the Caribbean. In, Education & HIV/AIDS - UNESCO</ref> [[Public policies]] in some countries openly discriminate against HIV-positive people, placing the burden of responsibility on the family of the infected individual. [[Discrimination]] also takes place in housing, employment, and [[public accommodations]], and currently little is able to be done.<ref name="Encyclopedia">Smith R. Encyclopedia Of AIDS : A Social, Political, Cultural, And Scientific Record Of The HIV Epidemic [e-book]. Fitzroy Dearborn; 1998. Available from: eBook Collection (EBSCOhost), Ipswich, MA. Accessed 15 November 2012.</ref> Because of these factors, many have less knowledge, skills, and motivation to practice [[safe-sex]] and avoid the disease.

====Risk groups====

=====Women=====
[[Gender]] plays an important role in the spread of HIV. Young women are more likely than men to contract HIV in the Caribbean, and most of these women are between 24–44 years old.<ref name="Howe"/> In [[developing countries]] in general, women are at an extreme disadvantage in terms of the prevention and treatment of HIV. The gender hierarchies found within many societies contributes to the correlation of women and HIV.<ref name="Bond">Bond, G. C. (1997). AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean, / edited by George C. Bonds ... [et al.]. Boulder, Colo. : Westview Press, 1997.</ref> One of the factors that put women most at risk is [[sexual violence]]. The first sexual experience of a girl is often forced, and during unprotected [[vaginal intercourse]], women are more likely than men to contract HIV, because HIV-infected semen has a higher viral concentration than vaginal secretions.<ref name="Roberts">Roberts, D. E. (2009). Sex, power & taboo : gender and HIV in the Caribbean and beyond /	Dorothy Roberts ... [et al.]. Kingston, Jamaica ; Miami : Ian Randle Publishers, 2009.</ref> The [[Capability Approach]], outlined by Nussbaum's Central Capabilities, lists bodily health and bodily integrity as crucial components of human dignity, and both of these are violated in the case of HIV transmission through rape.<ref>Nussbaum, M. (2011). Creating capabilities:the human development approach. (p.	33). Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press</ref> Furthermore, sexual relations between older men and younger women during [[transactional sex]] possibly explain why more teenage girls than boys are HIV-positive in the Caribbean.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 199}}

=====Men who have sex with men=====
{{See also|HIV and Men who have sex with men}}

[[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] has also had a significant impact on HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean. The prevalence of HIV among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) seems to be high, though reliable, current data is lacking. The HIV prevalence rate across the Caribbean between MSM varies, ranging from 11.7 percent in the [[Dominican Republic]] (1996) to 18 percent in [[Suriname]] (1998) to 33.6 percent in Jamaica (1996).<ref name="Figueroa"/> While unprotected sex between men is undoubtedly a major contributing factor to the epidemic, it remains largely hidden in the data. In many Caribbean countries, gay sexual relations remain illegal. This has led to a heavy [[stigma]] associated with [[same-sex relationships]].<ref name="UNAIDS"/> This stigma and widespread discrimination are definite factors in the spread of HIV.<ref name="FPS">United States (US). 20 June 2006. Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service CRS).
Mark P. Sullivan. "HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean and Central America." CRS Report for Congress. (RL32001) <usinfo.state.gov/gi/img/assets/16117/crsrl3200162006.pdf> [Accessed 15 Nov.
2006]</ref> In Trinidad and Tobago, one in five MSM were HIV positive, and out of those, one in four said they also have sex with women.<ref name="UNAIDS"/> Because of the stigma and discrimination, these men hide their same sex behavior and become involved with women who do not know about their sexuality.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 199}} This has created a bridge for HIV to pass from the gay community to the general population.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 199}}

===Cultural factors===

Several factors within Caribbean cultures play a role in HIV transmission. Firstly, sexual patterns exist in several countries that foster the spread of the disease. There is a high level of sexual activity among the youth, as evidenced by the 22 to 32 percent of persons in six eastern Caribbean states reporting having sex before age 15.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 199}} Furthermore, having multiple sexual partners within the past year is relatively common throughout the Caribbean.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 199}}

The [[commercial sex]] industry, [[transactional sex]], and [[sex tourism]] in the Caribbean are likewise important factors. HIV infection rates for commercial sex workers are high, ranging from 4.5-12.4 percent in the Dominican Republic (2000) to 9 percent in Jamaica (2005) to 30.6 percent in [[Guyana]] (2000).<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 197}} One possible explanation is that the use of [[condoms]] in transactional sex is less likely.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 199}} In addition to the specific industry of sex tourism, studies have shown that the general [[tourism]] industry is positively correlated with the HIV epidemic.<ref name="Padilla">Padilla, M., Reyes, A., Connolly, M., Natsui, S., Puello, A., & Chapman, H. (2012). Examining the policy climate for HIV prevention in the Caribbean tourism sector: a qualitative study of policy makers in the Dominican Republic. Health Policy &	Planning, 27(3), 245-255.</ref> The perceived connection exists in that there are aspects of the environment of a tourist area that foster higher risks for HIV infection. These include riskier behaviors on the part of locals and tourists, as well as employees of the tourism industry engaging in relations with the tourists.<ref name="Padilla"/> 

[[Intravenous drug use]] also plays a small role in perpetuating the spread of the disease, though it is not very common in many countries. However, two notable exceptions are [[Bermuda]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. In Bermuda, the prevalence rate is around 43 percent, while in Puerto Rico almost 80 percent of HIV infections arise from [[drug injection]].<ref name="Beck"/>

===Economic factors===

The economies of the Caribbean influence the spread of HIV/AIDS as well. Firstly, the cost of HIV on many facets of life, outside of simply human [[well-being]], was underestimated in the past.<ref name="La Foucade">LA FOUCADE, A., SCOTT, E., THEODORE, K., & BEHARRY, V. (2008). HIV/AIDS: HURDLES TO A SUSTAINABLE RESPONSE IN THE CARIBBEAN. Journal Of Business, Finance & Economics In Emerging Economies, 3(1), 155-175.</ref> The disease hindered both the growth and the development of the island nations that make up the region. Because of rising [[mortality]] and falling [[productivity]] due to illness, the [[labor force]] in several industries has been negatively affected.<ref name="La Foucade"/> Several aspects on individual economies will also experience negative impacts of HIV, from [[agriculture]] to [[tourism]] to [[finance]].<ref name="FPS"/> There have also been observed correlations between condom use and economic security, with those in more impoverished situations being less likely to practice safe sex.<ref name="Allen">Allen, C. F., Simon, Y. Y., Edwards, J. J., & Simeon, D. T. (2010). Factors associated with condom use: economic security and positive prevention among people living with HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean. AIDS Care, 22(11), 1386-1394. doi:10.1080/09540121003720978</ref> 

Studies have tried to identify a relationship between poverty and susceptibility to HIV.<ref name="Scott">Scott, E., Simon, T., Foucade, A., Theodore, K., & Gittens-Baynes, K. (2011). Poverty, Employment and HIV/AIDS in Trinidad and Tobago. International Journal Of	Business & Social Science, 2(16), 38-46.</ref>  Many have indicated that HIV/AIDS can have a negative impact on [[socioeconomic status]], as well as the level of overall employment in a given country. In Trinidad and Tobago specifically, being poor leaves one at a higher risk to contract the disease, but having the disease likewise leaves one more vulnerable to becoming poor and unemployed.<ref name="Scott"/>

==Examples by country==

===Haiti===
{{See also|HIV/AIDS in Haiti}}

Haiti, a nation that shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, has been greatly affected by HIV. Recent studies suggest that the adult prevalence is about 3 percent, the highest rate in the Americas and the highest outside of Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="Beck"/> Like many other countries, the disease began as being associated with men who have sex with men, specifically men in Haiti who engaged in commercial sex with male tourists. Later, the disease crossed over into the heterosexual community, with the main areas of risk being sex with female sex workers, casual sex with partners infected with AIDS, and blood transfusions.<ref name="Beck"/> The course of the disease in Haiti has been rapid and aggressive, compounded by high rates of [[tuberculosis]]  and other [[diseases of poverty]]. Furthermore, a large number of children were born to HIV-positive mothers before proper treatment was available, leading to a spike in [[infant mortality]].  Negative affects have been observed in the country, one being the impact on the economy due to a shrinking tourism industry. The response of the [[healthcare in Haiti]] has been fairly effective. Due to swift identification of the disease, a coordinated response was undertaken relatively quickly.  Several measures were taken, such as giving the Haitian Red Cross complete control of the blood bank, launching a national awareness campaign, and setting up local health units that provide HIV treatment with [[antiretroviral drugs]]. Although Haiti has undergone civil unrest for several years, a priority was placed on the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and strong relationships were formed with the private health sector. Through both prevention and care, Haiti continues to manage the spread of the disease.<ref name="Beck"/>

===Barbados===

Currently, the adult prevalence rate of HIV in Barbados is estimated to be 1.5 percent.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 196}} When HIV first struck Barbados, the island nation was completely underprepared to handle such a significant and detrimental disease.<ref name="Beck"/> The first case was recognized in 1984, after which those infected with AIDS were heavily stigmatized. In contrast to system in Haiti, much of the healthcare response in Barbados was carried out by the [[public sector]]. Several successes of Barbados in its fight against HIV include [[universal screening]], [[confidentiality]], an AIDS information center and [[hotline]], and special attention focused on at-risk groups. Overall, the achievements should undoubtedly be praised, especially considering the fact that these responses were carried out during an [[economic depression]] in 1990s, as well as during a period of severe stigmatization of HIV-positive people.<ref name="Beck"/>

===Jamaica===
{{See also|HIV/AIDS in Jamaica}}
Jamaica is another island nation that has been hit hard by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with an adult prevalence rate of around 1.5 percent.<ref name="Beck"/> Currently, AIDS is the leading cause of death among two at-risk groups, young children aged 1–4 and young women aged 20–29. Both the public and private health sectors have played important roles in the response to the epidemic. From providing healthcare to seeking international funds, instituting educational programs to providing condoms, the Jamaican government has done much in prioritizing the HIV crisis. Notably, as part of their strategic plan. Jamaica has set of goal of normalizing HIV as part of normal societal discourse. This would undoubtedly help to reduce stigma towards HIV-positive individuals. The relative successes of the Jamaican program are also notable, as the country has managed to secure its blood supply, expand STI treatment centers, introduce proper surveillance of HIV, and make condoms widely available. The country still seeks to strengthen its response, especially in terms of reducing discrimination and expanding prevention and intervention programs.<ref name="Beck"/>

===Cuba===
{{news release|section|date=January 2013}}

The current HIV adult prevalence rate in [[Cuba]] is estimated to be out 0.07 percent, one of the lowest in the world and certainly the lowest in the region.<ref name="Beck"/> Three of the major modes of transmissions in other nations, [[mother-to-child transmission]], transmission through [[blood transfusion]], and through [[intravenous drug use]], are virtually non-existent in Cuba. Instead, sexual contact accounts for approximately 99 percent of all cases. In terms of sexuality, Cuba has followed a trajectory nearly opposite of the norm. Most of the first cases diagnosed were heterosexual men, but the disease then crossed over into the gay community as male-to-male sexual contact began to spread the disease. Today, men who have sex with men (MSM) are one of the most at-risk groups, making up for around 86 percent of men infected with HIV in Cuba. 

With the establishment of the Working Group for Confronting and Fighting AIDS, the government and nongovernmental organizations created comprehensive measures to fight the disease. Firstly, Cuba banned the importation of all human blood products and destroyed potentially infected supplies, effectively eliminating transmission of HIV through blood transfusions. Next, the country provided wide-scale [[HIV testing]] for Cubans who had travelled abroad and potentially brought the disease back into the country. The most important measures served to prevent sexual transmission, namely through education programs, medical examinations, and admittance of HIV-positive individuals into specialized health centers called [[sanatoria]]. These sanatoria were somewhat controversial, especially in terms of possible [[human rights violations]]. Although severely isolated in the late 1980s, the program has since improved significantly, providing outlets for [[social integration]] and multiple levels of care.<ref name="Beck"/>

==Responses==

The responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean have varied over time and across countries. In the 2001 Nassau Declaration on Health, the [[Caribbean Community]] ([[CARICOM]]) declared the HIV/AIDS crisis to be a priority for the region. As part of their response, the Pan-Caribbean Partnership Against AIDS (PANCAP) was formed. Today, this partnership is made up of over 80 members, including Caribbean countries, AIDS organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Sources of funding include the World Bank, UNAIDS, and the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 198}} Three principles that are crucial to the effective control of HIV are the inclusion of HIV positive persons, prevention and treatment programs that are carried out simultaneously, and the reduction of stigma.<ref name="Piot">Piot, P., Bartos, M., Ghys, P. D., Walker, N., & Schwartlander, B. (2001). The global impact of HIV/AIDS. Nature, 410(6831), 968-973.</ref>

Broadly, increased political will, affordable and accessible antiretroviral drugs, stronger NGOs, and the generous aid of donors have combined to improve access to treatment.<ref name="Cohen"/> Testing pregnant women for HIV and providing antiretroviral drugs has significantly reduced the rates of mother-to-child transmission.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 197}} Improving awareness of safe sex practices through HIV education and prevention programs, as well as increasing contraceptive distribution, can reduce the rates of sexual transmission.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 200}} Specifically, childhood sex education is important in helping kids to develop lifelong safe-sex practices like consistent condom usage and reducing risk by delaying sexual activity.<ref name="Piot"/> Although it does play a minor role in the Caribbean, IV drug use still contributes to the spread of the disease. There is evidence that the harm reduction model, including needle and syringe exchange, is effective at preventing HIV with no other harmful effects.<ref name="Piot"/> Other responses include screening blood banks to reduce transmission through blood transfusion, increasing HIV screening and testing, and advocacy to establish responsive governmental policies.

==Challenges==

Several challenges have hindered the response to the HIV crisis. First, many countries have weak national capacities in terms of their ability to manage, control, and address the epidemic.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 199}} This management also presents technical challenges for developing countries with varying levels of technological advancement. Because of the many regional governments and international aid agencies, the response to the spread of the disease is often uncoordinated and less effective than it could be.<ref name="Figueroa"/>{{rp|page: 200}} Political factors that affect the response include inattention to or a lack of concern about HIV and incomplete or slow information flow.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> The stigma associated with both HIV-positive people and the perceived connection to the gay community is often crippling, resulting in discrimination, low use of testing facilities, and increased transmission of the disease.<ref name="Howe"/> While this is certainly improving, there is still also a lack of information regarding how HIV/AIDS affected specific groups, like commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, and IV drug users.<ref name="Howe"/> Without substantive and concrete information, it remains difficult to completely address the needs of the groups. Lastly, it remains difficult to fully implement HIV interventions in several areas, and in-depth research is needed to truly understand how these interventions function to help HIV-positive individuals.<ref name="Beck"/>
