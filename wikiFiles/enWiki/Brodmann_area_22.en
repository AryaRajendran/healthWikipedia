'''Brodmann area 22''' is one of [[Korbinian Brodmann|Brodmann]]'s [[cytological]]ly defined regions of the brain.  It is involved in auditory processing.

==Human==
'''Brodmann area 22''' is a region of the human [[brain]] (the 22nd numbered [[Brodmann area]]). On the left side of the brain this area  helps with generation and understanding of individual words. On the right side of the brain it helps to discriminate [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and sound [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], both of which are necessary to perceive [[melody]] and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]. Researchers believe this part of the brain is active in [[language processing|processing language]].

This area is also known as '''superior temporal area 22''', and it refers to a subdivision of the [[cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitecturally]] defined temporal region of [[cerebral cortex]]. In the human it corresponds approximately to the lateral and caudal two thirds of the [[superior temporal gyrus]]. It is bounded rostrally by the [[temporopolar area 38]] (H), medially by the [[posterior transverse temporal area 42]] (H), ventrocaudally by the [[middle temporal area 21]] and dorsocaudally by the [[supramarginal area 40]] (H) and the [[angular area 39]] (H) (Brodmann-1909).

The posterior section of '''Brodmann area 22''' is home to [[Wernicke's area]] (most commonly in the left hemisphere only).

==Guenon==
'''Brodmann area 22''' is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the [[guenon]] defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It is cytoarchitecturally homologous to the superior temporal area 22 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): compared to [[Brodmann area 21]]-1909 the cortical thickness of area 22 is greater; cell density is reduced overall and the internal granular layer (IV) is even less developed with fewer cells; there is no detectable boundary between the internal pyramidal layer (V) and the multiform layer (VI); as in area 21, the [[ganglion cell]]s of layer V are numerous and are arrayed adjacent to its boundary with layer IV, but they are plumper and more pyramidal in shape; the [[polymorphic cell]]s of the multiform layer (VI) become gradually more numerous as one goes deeper and gives way to a wide sublayer 6b of [[fusiform cell]]s as one approaches the boundary of the cortex with the subcortical [[white matter]].
