'''Neutrophil [[granulocytes]]''' are the most abundant type of [[white blood cell]]s in mammals and form an essential part of the [[innate immune system]]. In general, they are referred to as either '''neutrophils''' or '''polymorphonuclear neutrophils''' (or '''PMNs'''), and are subdivided into '''segmented neutrophils''' (or '''segs''') and '''[[band cell|banded neutrophils]]''' (or '''bands'''). They form part of the polymorphonuclear cell family (PMNs) together with [[basophils]] and [[eosinophils]].<ref name="Witko">{{cite journal

The name ''neutrophil'' derives from staining characteristics on [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] (H&E) [[histology|histological]] or [[cell biology|cytological]] preparations. Whereas [[basophilic]] white blood cells stain dark blue and [[eosinophilic]] white blood cells stain bright red, neutrophils stain a neutral pink. Normally, neutrophils contain a nucleus divided into 2–5 lobes.

Neutrophils are a type of [[phagocyte]] and are normally found in the [[blood]] stream. During the beginning ([[acute (medical)|acute]]) phase of [[inflammation]], particularly as a result of [[bacteria]]l [[infection]], environmental exposure,<ref name="Jacobs">{{cite journal

</ref> neutrophils are one of the first-responders of inflammatory cells to migrate towards the site of inflammation. They migrate through the blood vessels, then through [[:wikt:interstitial|interstitial]] tissue, following chemical signals such as [[Interleukin-8]] (IL-8), [[C5a]], [[N-Formylmethionine leucyl-phenylalanine|fMLP]] and [[Leukotriene B4]] in a process called [[chemotaxis]]. They are the predominant cells in [[pus]], accounting for its whitish/yellowish appearance.

Neutrophils are recruited to the site of injury within minutes following trauma and are the hallmark of acute inflammation.<ref>Cohen, Stephen. Burns, Richard C. Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 465.</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[Image:NeutrophilerAktion.png|thumb|Neutrophil granulocyte migrates from the blood vessel to the matrix, sensing proteolytic enzymes, in order to determine intercellular connections (to the improvement of its mobility) and envelop bacteria through phagocytosis.]]
Neutrophil granulocytes have an average diameter of 12–15 [[micrometre|micrometers]] (µm) in [[blood film|peripheral blood smears]].  When analyzing a pure neutrophil suspension on an automated cell counter, neutrophils have an average diameter of 8–9&nbsp;µm.

With the [[eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophil]] and the [[basophil granulocyte|basophil]], they form the class of ''polymorphonuclear cells'', named for the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]'s multilobulated shape (as compared to [[lymphocyte]]s and [[monocyte]]s, the other types of white cells). The nucleus has a characteristic lobed appearance, the separate lobes connected by [[chromatin]]. The nucleolus disappears as the neutrophil matures, which is something that happens in only a few other types of nucleated cells.<ref>Zucker-Franklin, p. 168.</ref> In the cytoplasm, the [[Golgi apparatus]] is small, [[mitochondria]] and [[ribosome]]s are sparse, and the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] is absent.<ref name=ZF170>Zucker-Franklin, p. 170.</ref> The cytoplasm also contains about 200 granules, of which a third are [[Azurophilic granule|azurophilic]].<ref name=ZF170/>

A minor difference is found between the neutrophils from a male subject and a female subject. The cell nucleus of a neutrophil from a female subject shows a small additional X chromosome structure, known as a "neutrophil drumstick".<ref>Zucker-Franklin, p. 174.</ref>

Neutrophils will show hypersegmentation (many segments of nucleus) in B12 and folate deficiency.

[[Image:Reference ranges for blood tests - white blood cells.png|thumb|400px|left|[[Reference ranges for blood tests]] of white blood cells, comparing neutrophil amount (shown in pink) with that of other cells.]]

Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in humans (approximately 10<sup>11</sup> are produced daily); they account for approximately 50-70% of all white blood cells (leukocytes). The stated normal range for human blood counts varies between laboratories, but a neutrophil count of 2.5–7.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L is a standard normal range. People of [[Africa]]n and [[Middle East]]ern descent may have lower counts, which are still normal. A report may divide neutrophils into segmented neutrophils and [[band cell|bands]].

When circulating in the bloodstream and unactivated, neutrophils are spherical. Once activated, they change shape and become more amorphous or amoeba-like and can extend pseudopods as they hunt for antigens.<ref name=edwards>{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Steven W.|title=Biochemistry and physiology of the neutrophil|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|pages=6|isbn=0-521-41698-1|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=S7o3YYskc-oC&pg=PA6&dq=%22surface+receptors%22+neutrophil&hl=en&ei=0Bx1Tp7qBI-aiAeaiMDHDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22surface%20receptors%22%20neutrophil&f=false}}</ref>

==Life span==

The average lifespan of (non-activated [[human]]) neutrophils in the circulation is about 5.4 days.<ref>Pillay J, den Braber I, Vrisekoop N, Kwast LM, de Boer RJ, Borghans JA, Tesselaar K, Koenderman L. [http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/116/4/625 In vivo labeling with 2H2O reveals a human neutrophil lifespan of 5.4 days] Blood. 2010 Jul 29;116(4):625-7.</ref> Upon activation, they marginate (position themselves adjacent to the blood vessel endothelium), and undergo [[selectin]]-dependent capture followed by [[integrin]]-dependent adhesion in most cases, after which they migrate into tissues, where they survive for 1–2 days.<ref name=Wheater/>

Neutrophils are much more numerous than the longer-lived [[monocyte]]/[[macrophage]] phagocytes. A [[pathogen]] (disease-causing microorganism or virus) is likely to first encounter a neutrophil. Some experts hypothesize that the short lifetime of neutrophils is an [[evolution]]ary adaptation. The short lifetime of neutrophils minimizes propagation of those pathogens that [[parasite|parasitize]] phagocytes because the more time such parasites spend outside a host [[cell (biology)|cell]], the more likely they will be destroyed by some component of the body's defenses. Also, because neutrophil [[antimicrobial]] products can also damage host [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, their short life limits damage to the host during [[inflammation]].<ref name=Wheater>{{cite book |author=Wheater, Paul R.; Stevens, Alan |title=Wheater's basic histopathology: a colour atlas and text |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-443-07001-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=http://www.ecc-book.com/ACINFLMPDF1.pdf}}</ref>

Neutrophils will often be [[phagocytosed]] themselves by macrophages after digestion of pathogens.  [[PECAM-1]] and [[phosphatidylserine]] on the cell surface are involved in this process.

==Chemotaxis==
Neutrophils undergo a process called [[chemotaxis]], which allows them to migrate toward sites of infection or inflammation. Cell surface receptors allow neutrophils to detect chemical gradients of molecules such as [[interleukin-8]] (IL-8), [[interferon gamma]] (IFN-gamma), [[C5a]], and [[Leukotriene B4]], which these cells use to direct the path of their migration.

Neutrophils have a variety of specific receptors, including complement receptors, cytokine receptors for interleukins and  [[interferon gamma]] (IFN-gamma), receptors for chemokines, receptors to detect and adhere to [[endothelium]], receptors for leptins and proteins, and  [[Fc receptor]]s for opsonin.<ref>{{cite book|last= Charles N. Serhan, Peter A. Ward, Derek W. Gilroy|title=Fundamentals of Inflammation|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|pages=53–54|isbn=0-521-88729-1|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=cJq1RMPKEYkC&pg=PA54&dq=receptors+neutrophils&hl=en&ei=QUl1TsyaCoXdmAXO3YXfDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=receptors%20neutrophils&f=false}}</ref>

==Anti-microbial function==
Being highly [[motility|motile]], neutrophils quickly congregate at a focus of [[infection]], attracted by [[cytokine]]s expressed by activated [[endothelium]], [[mast cell]]s, and [[macrophage]]s. Neutrophils express<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ear T, McDonald PP |title=Cytokine generation, promoter activation, and oxidant-independent NF-kappaB activation in a transfectable human neutrophilic cellular model |journal=BMC Immunol. |volume=9|pages=14 |year=2008 |pmid=18405381 |pmc=2322942 |doi=10.1186/1471-2172-9-14 |url=}}</ref> and release [[cytokines]], which in turn amplify inflammatory reactions by several other cell types.

In addition to recruiting and activating other cells of the immune system, neutrophils play a key role in the front-line defence against invading pathogens.  Neutrophils have three methods for directly attacking micro-organisms: [[phagocytosis]] (ingestion), release of soluble anti-microbials (including granule proteins), and generation of [[neutrophil extracellular traps]] (NETs).<ref name="NatRev">{{cite journal

===Phagocytosis===
Neutrophils are phagocytes, capable of ingesting microorganisms or particles. For targets to be recognised, they must be coated in [[opsonin]]s—a process known as [[antibody opsonization]].<ref name=edwards/> They can internalize and kill many [[microbe]]s, each phagocytic event resulting in the formation of a phagosome into which [[reactive oxygen species]] and hydrolytic enzymes are secreted. The consumption of oxygen during the generation of reactive oxygen species has been termed the "[[respiratory burst]]", although unrelated to respiration or energy production.

The respiratory burst involves the activation of the [[enzyme]] [[NADPH oxidase]], which produces large quantities of [[superoxide]], a reactive oxygen species. Superoxide decays spontaneously or is broken down via enzymes known as superoxide dismutases (Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD), to hydrogen peroxide, which is then converted to [[hypochlorous acid]] HClO, by the green heme enzyme [[myeloperoxidase]]. It is thought that the bactericidal properties of HClO are enough to kill bacteria phagocytosed by the neutrophil, but this may instead be a step necessary for the activation of proteases.

}}</ref>

===Degranulation===
Neutrophils also release an assortment of proteins in three types of granules by a process called [[degranulation]].  The contents of these granules have antimicrobial properties, and help combat infection.

==Role in disease==
Low neutrophil counts are termed ''[[neutropenia]]''. This can be [[congenital disorder|congenital]] ([[genetic disorder]]) or it can develop later, as in the case of [[aplastic anemia]] or some kinds of [[leukemia]]. It can also be a [[adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]] of [[medication]], most prominently [[chemotherapy]]. Neutropenia makes an individual highly susceptible to infections. Neutropenia can be the result of colonization by intracellular neutrophilic parasites.

In [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]], the important neutrophil enzyme [[elastase]] is not adequately inhibited by [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]], leading to excessive tissue damage in the presence of inflammation – the most prominent one being [[emphysema|pulmonary emphysema]].

In [[Familial Mediterranean fever]] (FMF), a mutation in the ''pyrin'' (or ''[[marenostrin]]'') gene, which is expressed mainly in neutrophil granulocytes, leads to a constitutively active [[acute-phase protein|acute-phase response]] and causes attacks of [[fever]], [[arthralgia]], [[peritonitis]], and – eventually – [[amyloidosis]].<ref name="fmf">{{cite journal
