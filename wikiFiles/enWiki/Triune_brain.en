The '''triune brain''' is an obsolete model of the [[evolution]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[forebrain]] and behavior proposed by the American physician and [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]] [[Paul D. MacLean]]. MacLean originally formulated his model in the 1960s and propounded it at length in his 1990 book ''The Triune Brain in Evolution''.<ref name="KHEPER">{{cite web | last = Kazlev, et al.| first =M. Alan| title = The Triune Brain. | work = KHEPER | date = 2003-10-19| url = http://www.kheper.net/topics/intelligence/MacLean.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-25}}</ref> The triune brain consists of the [[Basal ganglia|reptilian complex]], the paleomammalian complex ([[limbic system]]), and the neomammalian complex ([[neocortex]]), viewed as structures sequentially added to the forebrain in the course of evolution. However, this hypothesis is not espoused by many comparative neuroscientists. 

The triune brain hypothesis became familiar to a broad popular audience through [[Carl Sagan]]'s [[Pulitzer prize]] winning 1977 book ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]''. The theory has been embraced by some psychiatrists and at least one leading [[affective neurnoscience]] researcher.<ref>Panksepp, J. (2003). Foreword to Cory, G. and Gardner, R. (2002) ''The Evolutionary Ethology of Paul MacLean''. Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref>

== Reptilian complex ==
The reptilian complex, also known as the R-complex or "reptilian brain" was the name MacLean gave to the [[basal ganglia]], structures derived from the floor of the forebrain during development. The term derives from the fact that comparative neuroanatomists once believed that the forebrains of reptiles and birds were dominated by these structures. MacLean proposed that the reptilian complex was responsible for species typical instinctual behaviors involved in aggression, dominance, territoriality, and ritual displays.

== Paleomammalian complex ==
The paleomammalian brain consists of the [[septum]], [[amygdalae]], [[hypothalamus]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal complex]], and [[cingulate cortex]]. MacLean first introduced the term "[[limbic system]]" to refer to this set of interconnected brain structures in a paper in 1952. MacLean's recognition of the limbic system as a major functional system in the brain won wide acceptance among neuroscientists, and is generally regarded as his most important contribution to the field. MacLean maintained that the structures of the limbic system arose early in mammalian evolution (hence "paleomammalian") and were responsible for the motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behavior, and parental behavior.

== Neomammalian complex ==
The neomammalian complex consists of the cerebral [[neocortex]], a structure found uniquely in mammals. MacLean regarded its addition as the most recent step in the evolution of the mammilian brain, conferring the ability for language, abstraction, planning, and perception.

== Status of the model ==
MacLean originally formulated the triune brain hypothesis in the 1960s, drawing on comparative neuroanatomical work done by [[Ludwig Edinger]], [[Elizabeth Crosby]] and [[C. J. Herrick]] early in the twentieth century.<ref>Reiner, A. (1990). An Explanation of Behavior, Science, 250:303-305</ref><ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution>[[Georg F. Striedter|Striedter, G. F.]] (2005) ''Principles of Brain Evolution.'' Sinauer Associates.</ref> The 1980s saw a rebirth of interest in comparative neuroanatomy, motivated in part by the availability of a variety of new neuroanatomical techniques for charting the circuitry of animal brains. Subsequent findings have refined the traditional neuroanatomical ideas upon which MacLean based his hypothesis.

For example, the basal ganglia (structures derived from the floor of the forebrain and making up MacLean's reptilian complex) were shown to take up a much smaller portion of the forebrains of reptiles and birds (together called [[sauropsids]]) than previously supposed, and to exist in [[amphibians]] and [[fishes]] as well as [[mammals]] and sauropsids. Because the basal ganglia are found in the forebrains of all modern vertebrates, they most likely date to the common evolutionary ancestor of the vertebrates, more than 500 million years ago, rather than to the origin of reptiles. 

Some recent behavioral studies do not support the traditional view of sauropsid behavior as stereotyped and ritualistic (as in MacLean's reptilian complex). Birds have been shown to possess highly sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as the [[toolmaking]] of the [[New Caledonian crow]] and the language-like categorization abilities of the [[African Gray Parrot]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Patton |title= One World, Many Minds: Intelligence in the Animal Kingdom |url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=one-world-many-minds |work= Scientific American |date= December, 2008|accessdate=29 December 2008}}</ref> Structures of the limbic system, which MacLean proposed arose in early mammals, have now been shown to exist across a range of modern vertebrates. The "paleomammalian" trait of parental care of offspring is widespread in birds and occurs in some fishes as well.  Thus, like the basal ganglia, the evolution of these systems presumably date to a common vertebrate ancestor.<ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /><ref name="ReferenceA">Butler, A. B. and Hodos, W. Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation, Wiley</ref>

Finally, recent studies based on paleontological data or comparative anatomical evidence strongly suggest that the neocortex was already present in the earliest emerging mammals.<ref name="PrinciplesBrainEvolution"/> In addition, although non-mammals do not have a neocortex in the true sense (that is, a structure comprising part of the forebrain roof, or pallium,  consisting of six characteristic layers of neurons), they possess [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] regions, and some parts of the pallium are considered homologous to the mammalian neocortex. While these areas lack the characteristic six neocortical layers, birds and reptiles generally possess three layers in the dorsal pallium (the homolog of the mammalian neocortex).<ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /><ref name="ReferenceA">Butler, A. B. and Hodos, W. Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation, Wiley</ref> The [[telencephalon]] of birds and mammals makes neuroanatomical connections with other telecencephalic structures<ref name = PrinciplesBrainEvolution /> like those made by neocortex. It mediates similar functions such as perception, learning and memory, decision making, motor control, conceptual thinking, and tool use.

The triune model of the mammalian brain is obsolete in the field of comparative neuroscience and is seen as an oversimplified organizing theme.<ref>Smith CU., 2010, The triune brain in antiquity: Plato, Aristotle, Erasistratus. J Hist Neurosci. 19:1-14.</ref> but continues to hold interest among non-scientists. Reasons for this success are its simplicity. Under this model, the "neocortex" represents that cluster of brain structures involved in advanced cognition, including planning, modeling and simulation; the "limbic brain" refers those brain structures, wherever located, associated with social and nurturing behaviors, mutual reciprocity, and other behaviors and affects that arose during the age of the mammals; and the "reptilian brain" refers to those brain structures related to territoriality, ritual behavior and other "reptile" behaviors. Some people find this to be a helpful model because of its broad explanatory value.
 
[[Howard Bloom]], in his book ''[[The Lucifer Principle]]'', references the concept of the triune brain in his explanations of certain aspects of human behavior. [[Arthur Koestler]] made MacLean's concept of the triune brain the centerpiece of much of his later work, notably [[The Ghost in the Machine]]. English novelist [[Julian Barnes]] quotes MacLean on the triune brain in the foreword to his 1982 novel ''Before She Met Me''.
