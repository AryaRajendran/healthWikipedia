'''Physical medicine and rehabilitation''' (PM&R), '''physiatry''' {{IPAc-en|f|ɨ|ˈ|z|aɪ|.|ə|t|r|i}} or rehabilitation medicine, is a branch of [[medicine]] that aims to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life to those with physical impairments or disabilities. A [[physician]] having completed training in this field is referred to as a '''physiatrist''' or rehabilitation medicine specialist. Physiatrists specialize in restoring optimal function to people with injuries to the muscles, bones, tissues, and nervous system (such as stroke patients).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.edu/what-is-physiatry.asp |title=What is Physiatry? - HSS |publisher=Hss.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

== History ==
The term 'physiatry' was coined by Dr. [[Frank H. Krusen]] in 1938. The term was accepted by the [[American Medical Association]] in 1946. The field grew notably during World War II to accommodate the large number of injured soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|editors= Grabois, M.; Garrison, S.J.; Hart, K.A; and Lehmkuhl, L.D|title=Physical medicine and rehabilitation : the complete approach|year=2000|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=978-0865425361}}</ref>

== Scope of the field ==
Common conditions that are treated by the rehabilitation therapists include [[amputation]], [[spinal cord injury]], sports injury, [[stroke]], musculoskeletal pain syndromes such as [[low back pain]], [[fibromyalgia]], and [[traumatic brain injury]]. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation involves optimizing function in those afflicted with heart or lung disease. Chronic pain management is achieved through a multidisciplinary approach involving [[psychologist]]s, [[physical therapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, exercise therapists, [[anesthesiologist]], and interventional procedures when indicated. In addition to the previous methodology, stroke is often treated with the help of a [[speech therapist]] and [[recreational therapist]] when possible.<ref>Frontera, W.R. (ed.). (2010).

== Philosophy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
The major concern that PM&R deals with as a medical field is the ability of a person to function optimally within the limitations placed upon them by a disabling impairment or disease process for which there is no known cure. The emphasis is not on the full restoration to the premorbid level of function, but rather the optimization of the quality of life for those not able to achieve full restoration. A team approach to chronic conditions is emphasized to coordinate care of patients. Comprehensive Rehabilitation is provided by specialists in this field, who act as a facilitator, team leader, and medical expert for rehabilitation.

== Subspecialties ==
Six formal sub-specializations are recognized by the field in the [[United States]]:

* [[Hospice and Palliative Medicine]]
* [[Neuromuscular Medicine]]
* [[Pain management|Pain Medicine]]
* [[Pediatrics|Pediatric]] Rehabilitation
* [[Spinal Cord Injury]] Medicine
* [[Sports Medicine]]

Other subspecialties within the field that are recognized include the following{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}:
* Musculoskeletal pain management
* Intervention physiatry
* Surgical rehabilitation
* Rheumatological rehabilitation
* Obesity and other lifestyle disease modifications
* Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
* Amputee care

* [[Traumatic brain injury]] (TBI)

==PM&R in India==
The [[Indian Association of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]] is a scientific body of physiatrists working in the speciality of physical medicine and rehabilitation in India. It is a registered society promoting education and research in PM&R.  It also looks into legislative affairs for persons with disability. Its secretarial office is in New Delhi, India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iapmr.org |title=Indian Association of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |publisher=IAPMR |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

== Journals ==
''[[Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]]'', is the journal of the [[American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine]]. Prior to 2009 is was jointly published with the [[American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]].

In 2009, the [[American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]] launched a new journal, ''PM&R'', published by [[Elsevier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.e-aapmr.org/imis/membersonly/academy/journal2.htm |title=AAPM&R - American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |publisher=E-aapmr.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>
