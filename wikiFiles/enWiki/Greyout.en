A '''greyout''' (also '''whiteout''') is a transient loss of vision characterized by a perceived dimming of light and color, sometimes accompanied by a [[tunnel vision|loss of peripheral vision]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open2.net/labrats/g-force_diary_p4.html |title=G-Force Diary |author=Mike Leahy and Zeron Gibson |date=2005-08-25 |publisher=BBC/Open University |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> It is a precursor to [[fainting]] or a blackout and is caused by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (low brain oxygen level), often due to a loss of [[blood pressure]].  

Greyouts have a variety of possible causes:
* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]], such as [[Hypovolemia]], even in mild form such as when drawing blood.
* Suddenly standing up (see [[orthostatic hypotension]]), especially if sick, [[hangover|hungover]], or suffering from [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].
* By pilots or roller coaster riders experiencing positive [[g-force|''g''-force]].
* Paradoxically, [[hyperventilation]], such as the [[fainting game]], self-induced [[hypocapnia]], or [[shallow water blackout]].
* Overexertion

Usually recovery is rapid and a greyout can be readily reversed by lying down. This way, the cardiovascular system does not need to work against gravity for blood to reach the brain.

A grey-out may be experienced by aircraft pilots pulling high positive [[g-force|''g''-force]]s as when pulling up into a loop or a tight turn forcing blood to the lower extremities of the body and lowering blood pressure in the brain.<ref>Braithwaite MG, Durnford SJ, Crowley JS, Rosado NR, Albano JP. "Spatial disorientation in U.S. Army rotary-wing operations." ''Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine'' 69(11):1031-7 (November 1998).</ref> This is the reverse of a [[redout]], or a reddening of the vision, which is the result of negative G forces caused by performing an outside loop, that is by pushing the nose of the aircraft down. Redouts are potentially dangerous and can cause [[retina]]l damage and hemorrhagic [[stroke]]. Pilots of high performance aircraft can increase their resistance to greyout by using a [[G-suit]], which controls the pooling of blood in the lower limbs but there is no suit yet capable of controlling a redout. In both cases symptoms may be remedied immediately by easing pressure on the flight controls. Continued, or heavy G force will rapidly progress to [[g-LOC]] (G force induced Loss of Consciousness).

Surprisingly, even during a heavy grey-out, where the visual system is severely impaired, pilots can still hear, feel, and speak.<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.aerobatics.org.uk/repeats/physiological_effects.htm |author=Eoin Harvey, MD |title=Physiological Effects of Positive G Forces  |publisher=British Aerobatic Association |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref>  In other words, complete grey-out and [[g-LOC|loss of consciousness]] are separate events.

Another common occurrence of greyouts are in [[roller coaster]] riders. Many roller coasters put riders through positive G forces,<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/08977150260337921 |title=Roller Coasters, G Forces, and Brain Trauma: On the Wrong Track? |author=Douglas H. Smith, David F. Meaney |publisher=Journal of Neurotrauma |date=October 2002}}</ref> particularly in [[vertical loop]]s and helices. Roller coasters rarely have high enough negative G forces to induce redouts, as most [[Zero G roll|low-G elements]] are designed to simulate weightlessness.
