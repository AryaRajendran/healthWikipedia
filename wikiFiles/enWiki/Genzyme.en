'''Genzyme Corporation'''  is a fully owned subsidiary of [[Sanofi]]. Before its acquisition in 2011, Genzyme was an American biotechnology company based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. In 2010, Genzyme was the world’s third-largest biotechnology company, employing more than 11,000 people around the world. As a subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis, Genzyme has a presence in approximately 40 countries, including 17 manufacturing facilities and 9 genetic-testing laboratories, its products are sold in 90 countries. In 2007, Genzyme generated $3.8 billion in revenues with more than 25 products in the market. In 2006 and 2007 Genzyme was named one of [[Fortune Magazine]]’s “100 Best Companies to Work for”. The company donated $83 million worth of products worldwide; in 2006, it made $11 million in cash donations. In 2005, Genzyme was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]], the highest level of honor awarded by the president of the United States to America’s leading innovators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/nmti/recipients_05.html |title=The National Medal of Technology Recipients 2005 Laureates |accessdate=2009-02-26 |date=2009-02-19 |work=The National Medal of Technology and Innovation |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office}}</ref>

==History==
The company was started by [[Sheridan Snyder]], [[George M. Whitesides]]<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Smithsonian Magazine |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/40th-anniversary/Can-Nanotechnology-Save-Lives.html |accessdate=08-16-2012}}</ref> and scientist Henry Blair in 1981 and is primarily devoted to finding drugs that would cure [[enzyme]] deficiency conditions that were essential to human survival and which usually afflict a very small percentage of the world’s population. Drugs used to treat such conditions are considered to be “[[orphan drugs]].” In 1986, the company went public, raising $27 million.

Genzyme acquired several of [[Impath]]'s laboratories and cancer-testing technologies in May 2004, after Impath sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Milford Daily News |date=05-04-2004 |url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/business/x1528515155 |accessdate=12-15-2011}}</ref>

==Operations==
Genzyme focuses on six areas of medicine relating to [[lysosomal storage disease]]s, [[renal disease]], [[orthopedics]], transplant and immune diseases, [[oncology]], genetics and diagnostics. The first orphan-drug for Genzyme that FDA approved was [[Ceredase]], a drug for treating [[Gaucher disease]]. Ceredase was eventually replaced by [[Cerezyme]], which, at a cost of $200,000 per patient annually for life, currently accounts for approximately 30% of Genzyme's revenue.  Other important drugs made by Genzyme are [[Renagel]], used in treatment of dialysis patients, and [[Fabrazyme]], used to treat patients with [[Fabry's disease]]. Other products in development are [[Tolevamer]] for [[Clostridium difficile colitis disease]] and [[Campath]] for [[Chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].

Genzyme had a sub-license from [[Bioenvision]] to market [[clofarabine]] in North America.  On May 29, 2007 Genzyme made a tender offer to purchase Bioenvision for $5.60 per share.  On October 27, 2007, a majority of shareholders voted to approve Genzyme's acquisition.<ref>

==Contamination incidents==
In June 2009, Genzyme's Allston, Massachusetts plant was shut down to correct a viral contamination ([[Vesivirus]] 2117). A similar event had occurred in 2008 at the Geel, Belgium facilities. By April 2010 it had restarted operation at diminished capacity.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News (GEN)|date=Apr 15, 2010 | volume= 30 |issue= 8 | url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/viral-safety-methods-for-manufacturing/3261/ | title=Viral Safety Methods for Manufacturing | author=Angelo DePalma}}</ref>

In November 2009, fragments of stainless steel, rubber, and fiber-like material were discovered in some of Genzyme's drugs.  The FDA found these materials in [[Cerezyme]], Genzyme's treatment for [[Gaucher disease]], a rare genetic disorder that can lead to life-threatening organ damage.  The FDA is permitting the drug to stay in the market, due to a lack of adverse events, and a critical need for the product.<ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE5AC5OF20091113

Supplies of [[Fabrazyme]], Genzyme's treatment for [[Fabry disease]], have been rationed to one-third the recommended dose prompting patients to file a petition asking for a license to produce Fabrazyme by other manufacturers to make up the deficit under the [[Bayh–Dole Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/08/04/128973687/with-a-life-saving-medicine-in-short-supply-patients-want-patent-broken|title=With A Life-Saving Medicine In Short Supply, Patients Want Patent Broken|accessdate=2010-09-02|date=2010-08-04}}</ref>
