'''Cerebral vasculitis''' or '''central nervous system vasculitis''' (sometimes the word '''angiitis''' is used instead of "vasculitis") is [[vasculitis]] (inflammation of the [[blood vessel]] wall) involving the [[brain]] and occasionally the [[spinal cord]]. It may produce a wide range of [[neurology|neurological]] symptoms, such as [[headache]], difficulty moving or coordinating part of the body, changes in sensation, and alterations in perception, thought or behaviour, as well as the phenomena of a [[tumor|mass lesion]] in the brain leading to [[coma]] and [[brain herniation|herniation]]. Some of its symptoms may resemble [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scolding NJ, Jayne DR, Zajicek JP, Meyer PA, Wraight EP, Lockwood CM |title=Cerebral vasculitis--recognition, diagnosis and management |journal=QJM |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=61–73 |year=1997 |month=January |pmid=9093590 |doi= }}</ref> 10% have associated [[cerebral hemorrhage]].<ref name=Rehman>{{cite journal |author=Rehman HU |title=Primary angiitis of the central nervous system |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=93 |issue=11 |pages=586–8 |year=2000 |month=November |pmid=11198690 |pmc=1298150 |doi= |url=http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/reprint/93/11/586 | format=PDF}}</ref>

==Causes==
"Primary" CNS vasculitis is said to be present if there is no underlying cause. More commonly, the disease occurs in the setting of other medical conditions: [[infection]]s, other forms of systemic vasculitis such as [[Wegener's granulomatosis]] or [[polyarteritis nodosa]], connective tissue diseases such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE) and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], particular [[medication]]s and [[Recreational drug use|drugs]] ([[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]]), certain forms of [[cancer]] (particularly [[lymphoma]]s, [[leukemia]] and [[lung cancer]]) and [[Behçet's disease]]. It may imitate, and is in turn imitated by, a number of other diseases that affect the blood vessels of the brain diffusely such as [[fibromuscular dysplasia]] and [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]].<ref name=Rehman/>

==Diagnosis and treatment==
[[Cerebral angiography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], and ultimately [[biopsy]] of the brain, are often required for its diagnosis. Once confirmed, various tests are often performed to establish whether the vasculitis is primary or the result of an underlying cause. Treatment is with [[glucocorticoid]]s, often with additional [[immunosuppression]] with medication such as [[cyclophosphamide]] to decrease the immune system's attack on the body's own tissues.<ref name=Rehman/> Cerebral vasculitis is a very rare condition that is difficult to diagnose, and as a result there are significant variations in the way it is diagnosed and treated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scolding NJ, Wilson H, Hohlfeld R, Polman C, Leite I, Gilhus N |title=The recognition, diagnosis and management of cerebral vasculitis: a European survey |journal=Eur.
