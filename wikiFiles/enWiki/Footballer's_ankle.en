'''Footballer's Ankle''' is a pinching or impingement of the ligaments or tendons of the ankle between the bones, particularly the [[talus bone|talus]] and [[tibia]]. This results in pain, inflammation and swelling.

== Causes ==
A common cause of anterior impingement is a bone spur on anklebone ([[talus bone|talus]]) or the shinbone ([[tibia]]). Repeated kicking actions can cause the anklebone to hit the bottom of the shinbone, which can lead to a lump of bone (or [[bone spur]]) developing. This bone spur may then begin to impact on the soft tissue at the front of the ankle, causing [[inflammation]] and swelling. The condition is most common in athletes who repeatedly bend the ankle upward ([[dorsiflexion]]), such as footballers, hence the name.

== Symptoms ==
- pain and tenderness over anterior ankle joint<br />
- pain on dorsiflexion and plantar flexion<br />
- band of pain across anterior ankle when kicking a ball<br />
- palpable bony lump on distal tibia or superior talus

== Treatment ==
- [[soft tissue technique]]s to stretch muscles crossing the ankle to relieve tension<br />
- mobilisation of ankle joint<br />
- steroid injection to reduce inflammation<br />
- surgery to remove bony spurs
