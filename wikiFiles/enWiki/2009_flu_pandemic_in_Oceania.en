Almost all of the cases in Oceania have been in [[Australia]], where the majority of cases have resulted from internal community spread of the virus.  In addition, the government of [[New Zealand]], where most of the remainder of cases in Oceania have occurred, is on high alert for any people travelling into the country with flu-like symptoms.
