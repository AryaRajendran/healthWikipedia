'''Sarcopenia''' (from the Greek meaning "poverty of flesh") is the degenerative loss of [[skeletal muscle]] mass (0.5-1% loss per year after the age of 25), quality, and strength associated with [[aging]]. Sarcopenia is a component of the [[frailty syndrome]].

| quote = The age-related loss of muscle mass, also called sarcopenia, is receiving increasing attention in aging research. While the concept is frequently being used in research settings and introduced to clinical settings, thus far no consensus on its definition has been established. This article provides an overview of the history of sarcopenia definitions proposed in the literature thus far. It will describe the methodology used to develop the cutpoints for low muscle mass (or strength) in large epidemiological studies, how sarcopenia based on these cutpoints relates to functional outcomes, and the advantages and disadvantages of the different definitions. This overview will contribute to the current need to develop a consensus definition of sarcopenia which can be used in all relevant settings.}}</ref>

==Elements of sarcopenia==
Sarcopenia is characterized first by a [[muscle atrophy]] (a decrease in the size of the [[muscle]]), along with a reduction in muscle tissue "quality," caused by such factors as replacement of muscle fibres with [[fat]], an increase in [[fibrosis]], changes in muscle metabolism, [[oxidative stress]], and degeneration of the [[neuromuscular junction]].<ref name=RyallEtAl,2008>{{cite journal|last=Ryall|first=James G.|coauthors=Jonathan D. Schertzer, Gordon S. Lynch|title=Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying age-related skeletal muscle wasting and weakness|journal=Biogerontology|date=2008 Aug|volume=9|issue=4|pages=213–28|doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9131-0|pmid=18299960|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>  Combined, these changes lead to progressive loss of muscle function and frailty.

==Benefit of exercise==
Lack of [[exercise]] is currently thought to be a significant risk factor for sarcopenia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Abate M, Di Iorio A, Di Renzo D, Paganelli R, Saggini R, Abate G |title=Frailty in the elderly: the physical dimension |journal=Eura Medicophys |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=407–15 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17117147 |doi= |url=http://www.minervamedica.it/index2.t?show=R33Y2007N03A0407}}</ref> Not only muscle but the entire musculoskeletal system of muscle, neuromuscular responsiveness, endocrine function, vasocapillary access, tendon, joint, ligament, and bone, depends on regular and lifelong exercise to maintain integrity.   Exercise and increases in activity have been shown to be beneficial in settings of sarcopenia, even in the very old.

However, even highly trained athletes experience the effects of sarcopenia. Even Master class athletes who continue to train and compete throughout their adult life, exhibit a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, and records in speed and strength events decline progressively after age 30.<ref name=RyallEtAl,2008 /><ref name=Faulkner,2007>{{cite journal|last=Faulkner|first=John A|coauthors=Lisa M Larkin, Dennis R Claflin, Susan V Brooks|title=Age-related changes in the structure and function of skeletal muscles|journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology|date=2007 Nov|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1091–6|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.2007.04752.x|pmid=17880359|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>

==Fiber-type changes in sarcopenia==
Simple [[circumference]] measurement does not provide enough data to determine whether or not an individual is suffering from severe sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is also marked by a decrease in the circumference of distinct types of [[muscle fiber]]s. Skeletal muscle has different fiber-types, which are characterized by expression of distinct [[myosin]] variants. During sarcopenia, there is a decrease in "type 2" fiber circumference ([[Muscle fiber#Type II|Type II]]), with little to no decrease in "type I" fiber circumference ([[muscle fiber#Type I|Type I]]), and deinervated type 2 fibers are often converted to type 1 fibers by reinnervation by slow type 1 fiber motor nerves.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Doherty TJ |title=Invited review: Aging and sarcopenia |journal=J Appl Physiol |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=1717–27 |year=2003 |pmid=12970377 |doi= 10.1152/japplphysiol.00347.2003 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/95/4/1717}}</ref>

==Loss of satellite cell function==
[[Satellite cells]] are small mononuclear cells that abut the muscle fiber. [[Satellite cell]]s are normally activated upon injury or exercise. These cells then differentiate and fuse into the muscle fiber, helping to maintain its function. One theory is that sarcopenia is in part caused by a failure in satellite cell activation.<ref name=RyallEtAl,2008 /> Therefore, the ability to repair damaged muscles or respond to nutritional signals is impaired.

==Loss of anabolic signals==
Extreme muscle loss is often a result of both diminishing [[anabolic]] signals, such as [[growth hormone]] and [[testosterone]], and promotion of [[catabolic]] signals, such as pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]].<ref name=RyallEtAl,2008 />

==Sarcopenia as a public-health problem==
Due to the lessened physical activity and increased [[longevity]] of industrialized populations, sarcopenia is emerging as a major health concern. Sarcopenia may progress to the extent that an older person may lose his or her ability to live independently. Furthermore, sarcopenia is an important independent predictor of disability in population-based studies, linked to poor balance, gait speed, falls, and fractures. Sarcopenia can be thought of as a muscular analog of [[osteoporosis]], which is loss of bone, also caused by inactivity and counteracted by exercise. The combination of [[osteoporosis]] and sarcopenia results in the significant frailty often seen in the elderly population.

==Natural history==
Strength losses with ageing for men and women are relatively similar. They are greater for lower than upper extremity muscles. Maximum attainable strength peaks in mid-twenties and declines thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The decline is precipitous after 65 years of age, though few longitudinal studies exist on this topic. A direct assessment of the effects of sarcopenia, even in extremely physically fit individuals, can be seen in the age-related decline in [[Masters athletics (track and field)]] world records of muscle-intensive sports, such as weight lifting.

==Diagnosis==
Consensus on clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia has quickly developed over the last decade around the working definition proposed in 1998 by Baumgartner et al.,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baumgartner |first1=R.N. |last2=Koehler |first2=K.M. |last3=Gallagher |first3=D. |last4=Romero |first4=L. |last5=Heymstleld |first5=S.B. |last6=Ross |first6=R.R. |last7=Garry |first7=P.J. |last8=Lindeman |first8=R.D. |title=Epidemiology of sarcopenia among the elderly in New Mexico |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=147 |issue=8 |pages=755–763 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9554417 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9554417}}</ref> which uses a measure of lean body mass as determined by [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA) compared to a normal reference population. His working definition uses a cut point of 2 standard deviations below the mean of lean mass for gender specific healthy young adults.

This methodology is attractive for definitive diagnosis in clinical settings as well for several reasons. Primarily, emerging research shows it is predictive of negative outcomes and it is also a method familiar to most clinicians. This latter point is especially true for those that treat the geriatric population, given its similarity to the 1996 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) methodology for definitive diagnosis of [[osteoporosis]], which also uses DEXA, but uses a measure of lean mass rather than bone mineral density (BMD). DEXA is widely used already in clinical settings in developed countries to identify and monitor severity of osteoporosis. And the degree of sarcopenia can be measured using DEXA in patients being evaluated for osteoporosis, at the same time with the same scan, with no added cost or radiation exposure to the patient.

Since Baumgartner’s working definition first appeared, some consensus groups have refined the definition, including the recent joint effort of the European Society on Clinician Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) Special Interest Groups (SIG) on geriatric nutrition and on [[cachexia|cachexia-anorexia]] in chronic wasting diseases. Their consensus definition is:

'''1) A low muscle mass, >2 standard deviations below that mean measured in young adults (aged 18–39 years in the 3rd NHANES population) of the same sex and ethnic background, and
2) Low gait speed (e.g. a walking speed below 0.8&nbsp;m/s in the 4-m walking test).
However, it can be replaced by one of the well-established functional tests utilized locally as being part of the comprehensive geriatric assessment.'''<ref>{{cite journal |author= Muscaritoli M, Anker S, Argilés J, ''et al.'' |title= Consensus definition of sarcopenia, cachexia and pre-cachexia: Joint document elaborated by Special Interest Groups (SIG) "cachexia-anorexia in chronic wasting diseases" and "nutrition in geriatrics" |journal= Clinical Nutrition | year=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.clnu.2009.12.004 |pmid= 20060626 |volume= 29 |issue= 2 |pages= 154–159}}</ref>

There remain many opportunities for further refinement of reference populations by ethnic groups, and to further correlate the degrees of severity of sarcopenia to overt declines in functional performance (preferably using verified functional tests), as well as incidence of hospitalization admissions, morbidity and mortality. Work toward this objective has already begun, and the body of research to date clearly points toward severe sarcopenia being predicative of negative outcomes, similar to those already shown to exist with the [[Frailty syndrome]], as defined by the criteria set forth in 2001 by Fried et al.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Fried LP, Tangen CM, Walston J, ''et al.'' |title= Frailty in Older Adults: Evidence for a Phenotype. |journal= J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci. |year=2001|pmid=11253156 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=M146–56}}</ref>

==Management==

===Exercise===
Exercise has been considered of great interest in treatment of sarcopenia. There are several reports showing increased ability and capacity of skeletal muscle to synthesize proteins in response to short term resistance exercise.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Also, it has been reported exercise can improve physical performance (strength and mobility) in elderly subjects.  However, there is insufficient research demonstrating such findings in long term.

===Pharmacotherapy===
Currently, there are no agents approved for treatment of sarcopenia. Possible therapeutic strategies include use of testosterone or anabolic steroids, though long term use of these agents is controversial in men given concerns of prostate symptoms, and essentially contraindicated in women, given concerns of virilization. Recent experimental results have shown testosterone treatments may induce adverse cardiovascular events.<ref name="pmid20592293">{{cite journal |last1=Basaria |first1=S. |last2=Coviello |first2=A.D. |last3=Travison |first3=T.G. |title=Adverse Events Associated with Testosterone Administration |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume= 363|issue= 2|pages= 109–122|year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20592293 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1000485 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=20592293&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref>
Other approved medications have been shown to have little to no effect in this setting, including agents such [[DHEA]] and [[human growth hormone]].
New therapies in clinical development hold great promise in this area, including the [[selective androgen receptor modulator]]s (SARMs), as evidenced by recent studies.<ref name=Lynch,2004>{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Gordon S|title=Emerging drugs for sarcopenia: age-related muscle wasting|journal=Expert Opinion on Emerging Drugs|date=2004 Nov|volume=9|issue=2|pages=345–61|pmid=15571490|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>  Nonsteriodal SARMs are of particular interest, given they exhibit significant selectivity between the anabolic effects of testosterone on muscle, but apparently with little to no androgenic effects such as prostate stimulation in men<ref name=Lynch,2004 /> or virilization in women.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Diet and nutrition===
Nutritional evaluation may also be indicated if malnutrition is suspected, or current nutritional intake is insufficient to maintain adequate total body mass, although increased exercise also increases appetite. A 2012 study of 14 elderly women in Scotland had "compelling" results, suggesting the fatty acids [[eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]] contribute to increased muscle strength.<ref name="bbc ball 2012">{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19494801 | title=Fish oils 'help slow age decline' | work=[[BBC News]] | date=6 September 2012 | accessdate=6 September 2012 | author=Ball, Jonathan}}</ref> A further trial involving 60 people (males and females) received funding and was due to start afterwards.<ref name="bbc ball 2012" />
