The term '''nonpuerperal mastitis''' describes inflammatory lesions of the breast occurring unrelated to [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]]. 

It is sometimes equated with [[duct ectasia]], but other forms can be described.<ref name="pmid2918655">{{cite journal |author=Peters F, Schuth W |title=Hyperprolactinemia and nonpuerperal mastitis (duct ectasia) |journal=JAMA |volume=261 |issue=11 |pages=1618â€“20 |year=1989 |month=March |pmid=2918655 |doi= 10.1001/jama.261.11.1618|url=}}</ref>

==Types==
===Duct ectasia===
{{main|Duct ectasia of breast}}
'''[[Duct ectasia]]''' - literally (lactiferous) duct widening is a very common and thus rather unspecific finding, increasing with age.

===Subareolar abscess===
{{main|Subareolar abscess}}
Also called  Zuska's disease (only nonpuerperal case), is a frequently aseptic inflammation and has been associated with [[squamous metaplasia of the lactiferous ducts]].

===Granulomatous mastitis===
{{main|Granulomatous mastitis}}
Characteristic for granulomatous mastitis are [[multinucleated giant cells]] and [[epithelioid histiocyte]]s around lobules. Often minor ductal and periductal inflammation is present. The lesion is in some cases very difficult to distinguish from [[breast cancer]].

===Comedo mastitis===

Comedo mastitis is a very rare form similar to granulomatous mastitis but with [[tissue necrosis]]. Because it is so rare it may be sometimes confused with [[comedo carcinoma]] of the breast although the conditions appear to be completely unrelated.
