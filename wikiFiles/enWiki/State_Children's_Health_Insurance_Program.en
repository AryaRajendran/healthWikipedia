The '''State Children's Health Insurance Program''' ('''SCHIP''') – now known more simply as the '''Children's Health Insurance Program''' ('''CHIP''')<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Childrens-Health-Insurance-Program-CHIP/Childrens-Health-Insurance-Program-CHIP.html | title=Children's Health Insurance Program | publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] | accessdate=July 29, 2009}}</ref> – is a program administered by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] that provides [[matching funds]] to states for [[health insurance]] to families with children.<ref>Sultz, H., & Young, K. Health Care USA Understanding its Organization and Delivery pg. 257</ref> The program was designed to cover uninsured children in families with incomes that are modest but too high to qualify for [[Medicaid]].

At its creation in 1997, CHIP was the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since Medicaid began in the 1960s. The statutory authority for CHIP is under title XXI of the [[Social Security Act]]. It was sponsored by Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] in a partnership with Senator [[Orrin Hatch]]<ref name="Hatch Joins Kennedy">{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Pear | coauthors= | title= Hatch Joins Kennedy to Back a Health Program | date=1997-03-14  | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE4D81E39F937A25750C0A961958260 | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-06 | language = }}</ref> with support coming from First Lady [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] during the [[Clinton administration]].<ref name="ap100507"/><ref name="time031308"/><ref name="fc031808"/>

States are given flexibility in designing their CHIP eligibility requirements and policies within broad federal guidelines. Some states have received authority through waivers of statutory provisions to use CHIP funds to cover the parents of children receiving benefits from both CHIP and Medicaid, [[pregnant]] women, and other adults. CHIP covered 7.6 million children during federal fiscal year 2010, and every state has an approved plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Childrens-Health-Insurance-Program-CHIP/Downloads/2010_enrollment_datapdf.pdf |title=FY 2010 Number of Children Ever Enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP |accessdate=2013-04-03 |format=PDF }}</ref> Despite CHIP, the number of uninsured children continued to rise, particularly among families that cannot qualify for CHIP. An October 2007 study by the Vimo Research Group found that 68.7 percent of newly uninsured children were in families whose incomes were 200 percent of the [[Poverty in the United States|federal poverty level]] or higher as more employers dropped dependents, or dropped coverage altogether due to annual premiums nearly doubling between 2000 and 2006. Vimo cites the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured when it says 48 percent of the newly uninsured were not eligible for any kind of public coverage, and that only those in the lowest income bracket might offset the loss of employer-sponsored coverage with increases in Medicaid and SCHIP. <ref name="Uninsured In America">{{cite web|url=http://www.vimo.com/reports/uninsured.pdf |title=The Uninsured In America |accessdate=2008-01-06 |last=Espe |first=Erik |date=2007-10 |format=PDF |publisher=Vimo Research Group}}</ref> In FY 2008, the program faced funding shortfalls in several states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/7635.pdf |title=President's FY 2008 Budget and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) |accessdate=2007-07-03 |format=PDF |work=Henry J.

During the administration of [[George W. Bush]], two attempts to expand funding for the program failed when President Bush vetoed them.  Mr. Bush argued that such efforts were steps toward federalization of health care, and would "steer the program away from its core purpose of providing insurance for poor children and toward covering children from middle-class families."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/washington/03cnd-veto.html|David Stout,|title=Bush Vetoes Children's Health Bill |The New York Times| accessdate=2009-01-08 | date=2007-10-03}}</ref>   On February 4, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the ''Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009'', expanding the healthcare program to an additional 4 million children and pregnant women, including for the first time legal immigrants without a waiting period.

==History==
{{hus}}
As a part of the fallout from the failed [[1993 Clinton health care plan]], both Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy and the Clinton administration were looking for smaller initiatives for publicly funded health care that could gain bipartisan support.<ref name="ap100507">{{cite news | url=http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/hillary_health_care/2007/10/05/38601.html | title=Hillary Claims Credit for Child Program | agency=[[Associated Press]] for [[NewsMax]] | author=Beth Fouhy | date=2007-10-05 |  accessdate=2007-10-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080123174618/http://www.newsmax.com/insidecover/hillary_health_care/2007/10/05/38601.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-23}}</ref>  

Kennedy was intrigued by a children's health insurance plan in [[Massachusetts]] that had passed in 1996, and met with a [[Boston Medical Center]] pediatrics director and a [[Massachusetts state legislator]] to discuss the feasibility of a national initiative.<ref name="bg031408">{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/03/14/clinton_role_in_health_program_disputed/?page=full | title=Clinton role in health program disputed | author=Susan Milligan | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref>  Kennedy also saw using an increase in [[sin tax|tobacco taxes]] as a way to pay for the expanded coverage.<ref name="bg031408"/>  Thus, in October 1996, Kennedy introduced a bill to provide health care coverage for children of the working poor, to be financed via a 75 cents a pack cigarette tax increase.<ref name="time031308">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1721966,00.html | title=Assessing Clinton's "Experience": Children's Health Care | author=Karen Tumulty, Michael Duffy, Massimo Calabresi | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=2008-03-13 | accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref>

Meanwhile, in December 1996 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton examined several possible such initiatives and decided expanding health care insurance to children who had none was the one to advance,<ref name="ap100507"/> especially as its focus on children would be politically popular.<ref name="time031308"/>  Indeed, a different variant of this approach, dubbed "Kids First", had been envisioned as a backup plan during the original 1993 Task Force on National Health Care Reform meetings.<ref name="fc031808">{{cite news | url=http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/giving_hillary_credit_for_schip.html | title=Giving Hillary Credit for SCHIP | author=Brooks Jackson | publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] | date=2008-03-18 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.aapsonline.org/newsletters/jan96.htm | title=Clinton Care Through the Kitchen Door | publisher=[[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons]] | date=January 1996 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Additionally, Hillary Clinton had discussed an SCHIP-ish program with a White House health policy coordinator during the time her full-blown health care plan had suffered political failure.<ref name="wapo032408">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/23/AR2008032301706.html?sid=ST2008032401106 | title=Both Obama And Clinton Embellish Their Roles | author=Shailagh Murray, Jonathan Weisman | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2008-03-24 | accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref>

An  initial objection of Republicans in the Senate was that proposing to pay for the services by raising the federal tax on cigarettes, from 24 cents a pack to 67 cents a pack, ignored the likely consequence that sale of tobacco products would decrease and tax revenues would increasingly fall short of those needed to pay for the expansion of benefits.<ref name="nyt052197">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E0D7173BF932A15756C0A961958260 | title= Child Insurance Bill Opposed As Threat to Cigarette Revenue | author=[[Adam Clymer]] | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1997-05-21 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>  Kennedy and Hatch scoffed at the objection, with the former saying, "If we can keep people healthy and stop them from dying, I think most Americans would say 'Amen; isn't that a great result?'

SCHIP is located at Title IV, subtitle J of  H.R. 2015 [105th]  [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]].  H.R. 2015 was introduced and sponsored by Rep John Kasich [R-OH] with no cosponsors.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h105-2015 H.R. 2015 [105th&#93;: Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (GovTrack.us)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 25 June 1997, H.R. 2015 passed House Vote Roll #241 mainly among partisan lines, 270 ayes and 162 nays, with most Democrats in the House of Representatives in opposition.
On the same day, the bill passed in the Senate, with a substitute amendment, by unanimous consent.  After a conference between the House and Senate, passage in both House (Roll #345: 346-85) and Senate (Roll #209: 85-15) on the conference substitute became more bipartisan.

==State administration==
Like Medicaid, SCHIP is a partnership between federal and state governments. The programs are run by the individual states according to requirements set by the federal [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]]. States may design their SCHIP programs as an independent program separate from Medicaid (separate child health programs), use SCHIP funds to expand their Medicaid program (SCHIP Medicaid expansion programs), or combine these approaches (SCHIP combination programs). States receive enhanced federal funds for their SCHIP programs at a rate above the regular Medicaid match.

By February 1999, 47 states had set up SCHIP programs, but it took effort to get children enrolled.<ref name="fc031808"/>  That month, the Clinton administration launched the "Insure Kids Now" campaign, designed to get more children enrolled;<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/022399-fact-sheet-on-insure-kids-now-campaign.htm | title=President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton Launch the [Insure Kids Now Campaign]http://www.insurekidsnow.gov Promoting Children's Health Insurance Outreach | date=1999-02-23 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> the campaign would fall under the aegis of the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]].  By April 1999, some 1 million children had been enrolled, and the Clinton administration set a goal of raising the figure to 2.5 million by 2000.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org/legacy/042099-hrc-announces-child-health-insurance-enrollment.htm | title=First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton Announces That Almost One Million Children Are Enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program | date=1999-04-20 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>

States with separate child health programs follow the regulations described in Section 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 457. Separate child health programs have much more flexibility than Medicaid programs. Separate programs can impose cost sharing, tailor their benefit packages, and employ a great deal of flexibility in eligibility and enrollment matters. The limits to this flexibility are described in the regulations, and states must describe their program characteristics in their SCHIP state plans. Out of 50 state governors, 43 support SCHIP renewal.<ref>[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/10/schip_numbers.html Overriding the SCHIP Veto by the Numbers]  Center for American Progress.</ref> Some states have incorporated the use of private companies to administer portions of their SCHIP benefits. These programs, typically referred to as [[Medicaid managed care]], allow private insurance companies or health maintenance organizations to contract directly with a state Medicaid department at a fixed price per enrollee. The health plans then enroll eligible individuals into their programs and become responsible for assuring SCHIP benefits are delivered to eligible beneficiaries.

In [[Ohio]], SCHIP funds are used to expand eligibility for the state's Medicaid program. Thus all Medicaid rules and regulations (including cost sharing and benefits) apply. Children from birth through age 18 who live in families with incomes above the Medicaid thresholds in 1996 and up to 200% of the federal poverty level are eligible for the SCHIP Medicaid expansion program. In 2008, the maximum annual income needed for a family of four to fall within 100% of the federal poverty guidelines was $21,200, while 200% of the poverty guidelines was $42,400.<ref>Federal Register, Vol. 73, No. 15, January 23, 2008, pp. 3971-3972. Also see [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/index.shtml "US Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines"]</ref>

Other states have similar SCHIP guidelines, with some states being more generous or restrictive in the number of children they allow into the program.<ref>[http://ccf.georgetown.edu/index/medicaid-and-schip-programs "Medicaid and SCHIP Program Eligibility Rules by State"]</ref> With the exception of Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota and Oklahoma, all states have a minimum threshold for coverage at 200% of the federal poverty guidelines. North Dakota currently has the lowest at 160%. New York currently has the highest at 400% of the federal poverty guidelines.<ref>[http://ccf.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Eligibility-by-State.pdf]</ref> SCHIP Medicaid expansion programs typically use the same names for the expansion and Medicaid programs. Separate child health programs typically have different names for their programs. A few states also call the SCHIP program by the term "Children's Health Insurance Program" (CHIP).

States are allowed to use Medicaid and SCHIP funds for premium assistance programs that help eligible individuals purchase private health insurance.  As of 2008 relatively few states had premium assistance programs, and enrollment was relatively low.  Interest in this approach remained high, however.<ref>Joan Alker, [http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/7782.pdf "Choosing Premium Assistance: What Does State Experience Tell Us?"], The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], May 2008</ref>

In August 2007, the Bush Administration announced a rule requiring states (as of August 2008) to sign up 95% of families with children, earning 200% of the federal poverty level, before using the funds to serve families earning more than 250% of the federal poverty level.  The federal government said that 9 out the 17 states that offer benefits to higher-earning families were already compliant.  Opponents of this rule argued that signing up higher-income families makes lower-income families more likely to sign up, and that the rule was incompassionate toward children who would otherwise go without medical insurance.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89521878 Proposal Favoring SCHIP's Poorest Kids Criticized]</ref>

==Debate over impacts==
SCHIP has cost the federal government $40 billion over its first 10 years, and the debate over its fiscal impacts reflects [[Health care in the United States#Health care debate|the larger debate in the U.S. over the government's role in health care]].

In 2007, researchers from [[Brigham Young University]] and [[Arizona State University|Arizona State]] found that children who drop out of SCHIP cost states more money because they shift away from routine care to more frequent [[emergency room|emergency care]] situations.<ref name="Impacts Medicaid disenrollment">{{cite journal | author = Rimsza ME, Butler RJ, Johnson WG | title = Impact of Medicaid disenrollment on health care use and cost | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 119 | issue = 5 | pages = e1026–32 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17473075 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2006&ndash;2747 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17473075 | issn = | accessdate = 2008-01-05}}
</ref> The conclusion of the study is that an attempt to cut the costs of a state healthcare program could create a false savings because other government organizations pick up the tab for the children who lose insurance coverage and later need care.

Detractors of the program focus on the impact to the private health insurance industry. In a 2007 analysis by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], researchers determined that "for every 100 children who gain coverage as a result of SCHIP, there is a corresponding reduction in private coverage of between 25 and 50 children." The CBO speculates this is because the state programs offer better benefits at lower cost to enrollees than the private alternatives.<ref name="CBO">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/80xx/doc8092/05-10-SCHIP.pdf|title=The State Children's Health Insurance Program|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|date=2007-05-10|accessdate=2007-10-16|format=PDF}}</ref>  A briefing paper by libertarian think-tank [[Cato Institute]] estimated the "crowding out" of private insurers by the public program could be as much as 60%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/bp/html/bp99/bp9900006.html|title=Sinking SCHIP: A first step toward stopping the growth of government health programs|author=Michael F. Cannon|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref>

== Reauthorization ==
SCHIP was created in 1997 as a ten-year program; to continue past federal fiscal year 2007, passage of a reauthorization bill was required.  The first two reauthorization bills to pass through Congress would also expand the program's scope; President [[George W. Bush]] vetoed them as improper expansions.  A two-year reauthorization bill was signed into law by the President in December 2007 that would merely extend current SCHIP services without expanding any portion of the program.  With the 2008 Presidential and Congressional elections bringing Democrats to a majority in both houses of Congress and to the Oval Office, SCHIP was reauthorized and expanded in the same bill through fiscal year 2013.

===2007 reauthorization===
====HR 976====
In 2007, both houses of Congress passed a bipartisan measure to expand the SCHIP program, {{USBill|110|H.R.|976}}. The measure would have expanded coverage to over 4 million more participants by 2012, while phasing out most state expansions in the program that include any adults other than pregnant women. The bill called for a budget increase for five years totaling $35 billion, increasing total SCHIP spending to $60 billion for the five-year period. Opposition to HR 976 focused on the $35 billion increase in government health insurance as well as $6.5 billion in Medicaid benefits to illegal immigrants. Originally intended to provide health care coverage to low-income children, HR 976 was criticized as a giveaway that would have benefited adults as well as non-U.S. citizens.<ref>[http://aderholt.house.gov/?sectionid=20&sectiontree=6,20&itemid=649 Congressman Robert B.

On October 18, 2007, the House of Representatives fell 13 votes short (273–156) of the two-thirds majority required to override the president's veto, although 44 Republicans joined 229 Democrats in supporting the measure.<ref name="House override attempt">{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll982.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 982 |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=2007-10-18 |format=webpage}}</ref>

====HR 3963====
Within a week of the failed veto override vote, the House passed a second bill attempting a similar expansion of SCHIP. According to Democrats, the second bill, {{USBill|110|H.R.|3963}}, created firmer caps on income eligibility, prevented adults from joining, and banned children of illegal immigrants from receiving benefits. According to its opponents, however, this second proposed expansion was for families with annual incomes up to $62,000 (300 percent of the federal poverty level).<ref name="Citizen Feb 2009 Game Plan" /> The Senate passed the measure on November 1, 2007, but on December 12, 2007, Bush vetoed this bill as well, saying it was "essentially identical" to the earlier legislation,<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=President Bush vetoes child health bill again|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/12/bush.schip/?iref=mpstoryview|work= |publisher=CNN |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2007-12-14 }}</ref> and a House vote in January 2008 failed to override the veto.

{{USPL|110|173}}, which extended SCHIP funding through March 31, 2009, and the President signed it into law on December 21, 2007.

=== 2009 reauthorization ===
In the wake of President [[Barack Obama]]'s inauguration and the Democrats' increased majorities in both houses of Congress, legislative leaders moved quickly to break the political stalemate over SCHIP expansion. On January 14, 2009, the House passed {{USBill|111|H.R.|2}} on a vote of 290-138. The bill authorized spending an added $32.8 billion to expand the health coverage program to include about 4 million more children, including coverage of legal immigrants<ref name="NYTimes.com"/> with no waiting period for the first time. A cigarette tax increase of 62 cents&mdash;bringing the total tax on a pack of cigarettes to $1.01&mdash;an increase of tax on chewing tobacco from $0.195/lb. to $0.50/lb.&mdash;as well as tax increases on other tobacco products<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/021009/page2 |title=Health Groups Hail Increase in Federal Tobacco Taxes |accessdate=2009-02-10 |work=NCI Cancer Bulletin |publisher=National Cancer Institute |date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> will fund the program's expansion. On January 29, the Senate passed the house bill by a 66-32 margin, with two amendments.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ceci |last=Connolly |title=Senate Passes Health Insurance Bill for Children |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/29/AR2009012900325.html |work=Washington Post |publisher= |date=January 30, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2009 }}</ref> The House accepted the amended version on a vote of 290 to 135,<ref name="NYTimes.com">{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Pear |title=Obama Signs Children's Health Insurance Bill |work=NYTimes.com |date=February 4, 2009 |accessdate=February 6, 2009 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/us/politics/05health.html?ref=health}}</ref> and President Obama signed the bill into law as {{USPL|111|3}} on February 4, 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29011620/ | title=Obama signs kids' health insurance bill | publisher=MSNBC | work=The Associated Press | accessdate=2009-02-04 | date=February 4, 2009}}</ref>

===Arizona rescission===
In early 2010, [[Arizona]] Governor [[Jan Brewer]], along with the House and Senate of the state passed a budget that eliminated S-CHIP, known as KidsCare in Arizona. As of 22 April 2010, the state assembly, after learning they will lose federal matching and stimulus funds, is looking at restoring some of the program, but not allowing new enrollment. <ref>http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2010/10/04/critics-bash-brewer-for-inconsistent-behavior-on-child-health-care/</ref>
