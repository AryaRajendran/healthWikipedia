'''Pulmonary fibrosis''' is the formation or development of excess fibrous [[connective tissue]] ([[fibrosis]]) in the [[lung]]s. It is also described as "scarring of the lung".<ref name=pff>[http://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/education Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation > What is Pulmonary Fibrosis?] Last updated October 19, 2009</ref>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis are mainly:
*[[Shortness of breath]], particularly with exertion<ref name=pff/>
*Chronic dry, hacking coughing<ref name=pff/>
*Fatigue and weakness<ref name=pff/>
*Chest discomfort<ref name=pff/>
*Loss of appetite and rapid weight loss<ref name=pff/>

Pulmonary fibrosis is suggested by a history of progressive shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]) with exertion.<ref name=medicinenet/> Sometimes fine inspiratory [[crackles]] can be heard at the lung bases on auscultation.<ref name=medicinenet/> A [[chest x-ray]] may or may not be abnormal, but [[high Resolution CT]] will frequently demonstrate abnormalities.<ref name=medicinenet/>

==Cause==
{{Further|Interstitial lung disease}}
Pulmonary fibrosis may be a secondary effect of other diseases.  Most of these are classified as [[interstitial lung disease]]s.   Examples include autoimmune disorders, viral infections or other microscopic injuries to the lung.<ref name=pff/> However, pulmonary fibrosis can also appear without any known cause.  In this case,  it is termed "idiopathic".<ref name=nlm/> Most idiopathic cases are diagnosed as ''[[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]]''.  This is a diagnosis of exclusion of a characteristic set of histologic/pathologic features known as [[usual interstitial pneumonia]] (UIP). In either case, there is a growing body of evidence which points to a genetic predisposition in a subset of patients. For example, a mutation in [[Surfactant protein C]] (SP-C) has been found to exist in some families with a history of pulmonary fibrosis.<ref name=pff/>

Diseases and conditions that may cause pulmonary fibrosis as a secondary effect include:
* Inhalation of environmental and occupational pollutants,<ref name=pff/> such as in [[asbestosis]],<ref name=medicinenet/> [[silicosis]]<ref name=medicinenet/> and exposure to certain gases.<ref name=medicinenet/> Coal miners, ship workers and sand blasters among others are at higher risk.<ref name=nlm>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pulmonaryfibrosis.html MedlinePlus > Pulmonary Fibrosis] Date last updated: 09 February 2010</ref>
**[[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], most often resulting from inhaling dust contaminated with bacterial, fungal, or animal products.<ref name=medicinenet/>
* [[Cigarette smoking]]<ref name=pff/> can increase the risk or make the illness worse.<ref name=nlm/>
* Some typical [[connective tissue disease]]s<ref name=nlm/> such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]],<ref name=pff/><ref name=medicinenet/> [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE]]<ref name=pff/><ref name=medicinenet/> and [[scleroderma]]<ref name=pff/>
* Other diseases that involve connective tissue, such as [[sarcoidosis]]<ref name=pff/><ref name=medicinenet/> and [[Wegener's granulomatosis]].<ref name=medicinenet>[http://www.medicinenet.com/pulmonary_fibrosis/article.htm MedicineNet.com > Pulmonary Fibrosis] Retrieved on Feb 26, 2010</ref>
* Infections<ref name=medicinenet/>
* Certain medications, e.g. [[amiodarone]], [[bleomycin]] ([[pingyangmycin]]), [[busulfan]], [[methotrexate]], and <ref name=pff/><ref name=nlm/> [[nitrofurantoin]]<ref name="pmid18495029">{{cite journal |author=Goemaere NN, Grijm K, van Hal PT, den Bakker MA |title=Nitrofurantoin-induced pulmonary fibrosis: a case report |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=2 |issue= |pages=169 |year=2008 |pmid=18495029 |pmc=2408600 |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-169 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/2//169}}</ref>
* [[Radiation therapy]] to the chest<ref name=pff/><ref name=medicinenet/>

A helpful mnemonic for medical students and healthcare professionals to remember the causes of apical or basal fibrosis are as follows:

'''Apical - BREAST CLAP'''
* Berylliosis
* Radiation
* Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis
* Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis
* Sarcoidosis
* Tuberculosis

* Coal worker's Pneumoconiosis
* Langahans Cell Histiocytosis
* Ankylosing Spondylitis
* Psoriasis

'''Basal - DR CIA'''
* Drugs
* Rheumatoid Arthritis
* Connective Tissue Disease
* Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
* Asbestosis

==Pathogenesis==
{{Further|Fibrosis}}
Pulmonary fibrosis involves gradual exchange of normal lung [[parenchyma]] with fibrotic tissue. The replacement of normal lung with scar tissue causes irreversible decrease in [[oxygen diffusion]] capacity.<ref name=pff/> In addition, decreased compliance makes pulmonary fibrosis a [[restrictive lung disease]]. It is the main cause of restrictive lung disease that is intrinsic to the lung parenchyma. In contrast, [[quadriplegia]]<ref name="pmid2780083">{{cite journal |author=Walker J, Cooney M, Norton S |title=Improved pulmonary function in chronic quadriplegics after pulmonary therapy and arm ergometry |journal=Paraplegia |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=278–83 |year=1989 |month=August |pmid=2780083 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and [[kyphosis]]<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301760-overview eMedicine Specialties  > Pulmonology > Interstitial Lung Diseases > Restrictive Lung Disease] Author: Lalit K Kanaparthi, MD, Klaus-Dieter Lessnau, MD, Sat Sharma, MD. Updated: Jul 27, 2009</ref> are examples of causes of restrictive lung disease that do not necessarily involve pulmonary fibrosis

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Pulmon fibrosis.PNG|thumb|right|HRCT of lung showing extensive fibrosis possibly from usual interstitial pneumonitis. There is also a large emphysematous bulla.]]
The diagnosis can be confirmed by [[lung biopsy]].<ref name=medicinenet/> A videoscopic assisted thoracoscopic wedge biopsy (VATS) under [[general anesthesia]] may be necessary to obtain enough tissue to make an accurate diagnosis. This kind of biopsy involves placement of several tubes through the chest wall, one of which is used to cut off a piece of lung to send for evaluation .<ref name=medicinenet/> The removed tissue is examined [[histopathologically]] by microscopy to confirm the presence and pattern of fibrosis as well as presence of other features that may indicate a specific cause e.g. specific types of mineral dust or possible response to therapy e.g. a pattern of so-called non-specific interstitial fibrosis.<ref name=medicinenet/>

Misdiagnosis is common because, while overall pulmonary fibrosis is not rare, each individual type of pulmonary fibrosis is uncommon and the evaluation of patients with these diseases is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.<ref name=pff/> Terminology has been standardized but difficulties still exist in their application.<ref name=pff/> Even experts may disagree with the classification of some cases.

On [[spirometry]], as a restrictive lung disease, both the FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second) and FVC (Forced [[Vital Capacity]]) are reduced so the [[FEV1/FVC ratio]] is normal or even increased in contrast to obstructive lung disease where this ratio is reduced. The values for residual volume and total lung capacity are generally decreased in restrictive lung disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.spirxpert.com/characteristic6.htm |title= www.spirXpert.com |work= }}</ref>

==Treatment and prevention==
Pulmonary fibrosis creates scar tissue. The scarring is permanent once it has developed.<ref name=medicinenet/> Slowing the progression and prevention depends on the underlying cause:

*Treatment options for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are very limited.<ref name=medicinenet/> Though research trials are ongoing, there is no evidence that any medications can significantly help this condition. Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option available in severe cases. Since some types of lung fibrosis can respond to corticosteroids (such as Prednisone) and/or other medications that suppress the body's immune system, these types of drugs are sometimes prescribed in an attempt to slow the processes that lead to fibrosis.
The immune system is felt to play a central role in the development of many forms of pulmonary fibrosis. The goal of treatment with immune suppressive agents such as corticosteroids is to decrease lung inflammation and subsequent scarring. Responses to treatment are variable. Those whose conditions improve with immune suppressive treatment probably do not have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has no significant treatment or cure.<ref name=medicinenet/> There are pharmacological agents in the experimental phase intended to prevent scarring.<ref name=pff/> [[Anti-inflammatory]] agents have only limited success in reducing the fibrotic progress.<ref name=pff/>
*Some of the other types of fibrosis, such as [[nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis]] (NSIP), may respond to [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] therapy such as [[corticosteroids]].<ref name=medicinenet/> However, only a minority of patients respond to corticosteroids alone, so additional immunosuppressants, such as [[cyclophosphamide]], [[azathioprine]], [[methotrexate]], [[penicillamine]], and [[cyclosporine]] may be used.<ref name=medicinenet/> [[Colchicine]] has also been used with limited success.<ref name=medicinenet/> There are ongoing trials with newer drugs such as [[Interferon-gamma|IFN-γ]], [[mycophenolate mofetil]], and [[pirfenidone]].
*[[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], a less severe form of pulmonary fibrosis, is prevented from becoming aggravated by avoiding contact with the causative material.

[[Oxygen supplementation]] improves the quality of life and exercise capacity.<ref name=pff/> [[Lung transplantation]] may be considered for some patients.<ref name=pff/>

==Prognosis==
[[File:End-stage interstitial lung disease (honeycomb lung).jpg|thumb|right|Lung with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis at autopsy]]
[[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] caused by pulmonary fibrosis can lead to [[pulmonary hypertension]], which, in turn, can lead to [[heart failure]] of the [[right ventricle]]. This can be prevented with oxygen supplementation.<ref name=medicinenet/>

Pulmonary fibrosis may also cause increased risk for [[pulmonary emboli]], which can be prevented by [[anticoagulant]]s.<ref name=medicinenet/>

==Epidemiology==
Five million people worldwide are affected by pulmonary fibrosis.<ref name=pff/> A wide range of incidence and prevalence rates have been reported for pulmonary fibrosis. The rates below are per 100,000 persons, and the ranges reflect narrow and broad inclusion criteria, respectively.

Based on these rates, pulmonary fibrosis prevalence in the United States could range from more than 29,000 to almost 132,000, based on the population in 2000 that was 18 years or older. The actual numbers may be significantly higher due to misdiagnosis.<ref name=pff/> Typically, patients are in their forties and fifties when diagnosed while the incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis increases dramatically after the age of fifty. However, loss of pulmonary function is commonly ascribed to old age, heart disease or to more common lung diseases.  Fibrosis is best known for killing [[Peter Benchley]] in 2006.<ref name=pff/>
