'''Post orgasmic illness syndrome''' (POIS) is a condition characterized by debilitating symptoms following [[orgasm]] that last for a few hours to several days.<ref name="waldingernew">{{cite journal

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms usually appear within half an hour of [[orgasm]] and resolve after a few days.<ref name=coitalbmj/><ref name=HandbookOfSexualDysfunction />

The sufferer experiences mental symptoms, physical symptoms, or both.  Common mental symptoms include cognitive dysfunction, intense discomfort, irritability, [[anxiety]], craving for relief, susceptibility to nervous system stresses (e.g. [[common cold]]), depressed mood, and difficulty communicating, remembering words, reading and retaining information, concentrating, and socialising.<ref name=waldingernew/><ref name=coitalbmj/><ref name=HandbookOfSexualDysfunction /><ref name="poisforum">{{cite web |author= |title=Post Orgasmic Illness Syndrome (POIS)|title=The Naked Scientists |volume= |issue= |pages= |year=2010 |pmid= |doi= |url= http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=6576.0}}</ref> Physical symptoms include severe [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], mild to severe headache, and [[flu-like syndrome|flu-like]] and allergy-like symptoms, such as sneezing, itchy eyes, [[rhinitis|nasal irritation]], and [[myalgia|muscle pain]].<ref name=coitalbmj /><ref name=HandbookOfSexualDysfunction /> Affected individuals may also experience intense warmth.<ref name=waldingernew/><ref name="pmid11995603" />

==Diagnosis==
Waldinger says this condition is prone to being erroneously ascribed to psychological factors or hypochondria.<ref name="pmid11995603" />  In a 2010 British Medical 
Journal case study, Dexter links a form of [[Coital cephalalgia|coital headache]] with POIS, and references a science forum in which hundreds of sufferers 
(a number which is rapidly growing) have detailed their condition.<ref name="coitalbmj"/><ref name="poisforum" />  Dexter's patient was found to have low progesterone.<ref name="coitalbmj"/> Others on the referenced forum have tested low in testosterone, high in cortisol, and a contrast enhanced dedicated pituitary MRI has found pituitary abnormalities in three cases: a pituitary microadenoma was found in two, and a partially empty [[Sella turcica|sella]] in the other.

==Management==
POIS patients are beginning to be treated using hyposensitation techniques for semen allergies.<ref name="waldingerhypo">{{cite journal

|title = Hyposensitization Therapy with Autologous Semen in Two Dutch Caucasian Males: Beneficial Effects in Postorgasmic Illness Syndrome (POIS; Part 2)
|doi =10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02167.x|publisher = The Journal of Sexual Medicine
|date = April 2011
}}</ref>
If allergy is what is causing issues, cleaning the body after sex, by taking shower and urinate, can help somewhat.

Dexter's patient, who had been symptomatic for 27 years, was completely treated by 5 to 10&nbsp;mg doses of [[norethisterone]], half an hour before, and in the minutes just after orgasm.<ref name="coitalbmj" />

Affected individuals typically avoid sexual activity,<ref name="pmid11995603" /> especially orgasm, or schedule it for times when they can rest and recover for several days afterwards.<ref name=HandbookOfSexualDysfunction />

One physician has treated two people, whose primary symptoms were intense depressed mood, with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]].<ref name="NYTimes.com">{{cite news |author = Friedman, Richard A.

|publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=12 May 2009 }}</ref>

Withdrawing from porn or other [[addiction]]s has also been mentioned to help maintain sound levels of for instance [[dopamine]].

Intake of certain [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s seem to help some patients, [[niacin]] being one of the most commonly mentioned substances (with detailed ways of intake).

==Pathophysiology==
Most recently, in early 2011, Professor Waldinger and collaborators further characterized POIS, proposed a specific immunological mechanism, and empirically supported their hypothesis on 45 Dutch Caucasian males. This study concluded that both Type-1 and Type-4 allergy to male's own semen contribute to symptoms of the illness.<ref name=waldingernew/>

Dexter speculates that POIS could be caused by a lack of [[progesterone]], a powerful neurosteroid, or a defect in neurosteroid precursor synthesis. 
In the latter case, the same treatment may not be effective for different sufferers.  Different sufferers may have different missing precursors,
ultimately leading to a deficiency of the same particular neurosteroid, causing similar symptoms.

An array of more subtle, lingering symptoms after orgasm, which would not constitute POIS, may contribute to habituation between mates. They may show up as restlessness, irritability, increased sexual frustration, apathy, sluggishness, neediness, dissatisfaction with a mate, or weepiness <ref>{{cite news

Habituation to a mate can drive the search for novel mates (the [[Coolidge effect]]). Possible neurochemical mechanisms behind such effects are discussed in "The Passion Cycle."<ref>{{cite news

One researcher suggests that the symptoms may be produced by an autoimmune reaction against any of various hormones or other substances secreted during and after sex.<ref>{{cite news

It is difficult to demonstrate a causal relationship based on patient reports.<ref>{{cite news

==Epidemiology==
POIS could affect between 0.25% and 1% of the population.<ref name="coitalheadache">{{cite journal |author=Rasmussen BK, Olesen J |title=Symptomatic and nonsymptomatic headaches in the general population. |journal=Neurology |volume=42 |issue= 6|pages=1225–31 |year=1992 |pmid= 1603351|doi= |url=}}</ref>

In the United States of America, POIS is recognized as a rare disorder by the National Institutes for Health (NIH), Office of Rare Diseases Research.<ref>[http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/10809/Postorgasmic_illness_syndrome.aspx rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/10809/Postorgasmic_illness_syndrome.aspx].</ref> It is also listed in the organizational database of the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD).<ref>[http://www.rarediseases.org/rare-disease-information/organizations/byID/3136/viewDetail www.rarediseases.org/rare-disease-information/organizations/byID/3136/viewDetail].</ref>
