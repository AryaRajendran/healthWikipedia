'''Scoliosis Research Society''' (SRS) is a non-profit, professional, international organization, made up of physicians and allied health personnel, whose purpose is to "care for those with spinal deformity throughout life by patient care, education, research and patient advocacy."<ref>Ogilvie JW: Presidential Address: Quo Vadimus? Scoliosis Research Society Presidential Address at the 2004 Annual Meeting, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Spine 30(18): 2007-8, 2005.</ref>  Founded in 1966 with 35 members, the SRS has grown to include almost 1100 spinal deformity surgeons in 41 countries, with a primary focus on providing continuing medical education for health care professionals and on funding/supporting research in spinal deformities.  Among its founding members was Dr [[Paul Randall Harrington]], inventor of the [[Harrington Rod]] treatment for [[scoliosis]].  Harrington later served as President from 1972 to 1973.<ref name="JBJS">{{cite web |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/63/5/857.pdf|title=Paul Randall Harrington, M.D., 1911â€“1980 |publisher=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}</ref>  Current membership primarily includes spinal deformity surgeons, as well as some researchers, physician assistants, and orthotists who are involved in research and treatment of spinal deformities.  Strict membership criteria ensure that the individual SRS Fellows are dedicated to the highest standards of care for adult and pediatric spinal deformities, utilizing both non-operative and operative techniques.<ref>[http://www.srs.org Scoliosis Research Society] website - www.srs.org</ref>

==Annual meeting==

The organization holds an annual meeting with strong global participation from spine surgeons and specialists from around the world.<ref>Crawford AH: Strategic Directions: The Scoliosis Research Society Initiatives For Change, Spine 27(17): 1960-1964, 2002.</ref>  This annual scientific meeting includes scientific presentations related to spine surgery and spinal deformity, which are selected through a process of abstract submission and peer review.  Both basic science and clinical research are presented during the meeting and all clinical research (involving surgical treatment) is required to have a minimum of 2-year post-operative follow-up.  These presentations cover a variety of aspects of spinal deformity, including:
* Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
* Adult Spinal Deformity
* Aging Spine
* Basic Science
* Cervical Deformity
* Congenital Deformity
* Complications
* Diagnostic Methods
* Early Onset Scoliosis
* Etiology/Genetics
* Natural History
* Infection
* Innovative Methods
* Kyphosis
* Miscellaneous
* Neuromuscular Deformity
* Spondylolisthesis
* Trauma
* Tumors

Also, a second annual meeting, entitled International Meeting on Advanced Spine Techniques (IMAST) is held, focusing on emerging technologies and techniques.<ref>Meetings of Interest for Spine Physicians and Surgeons, Spine 25(13): 1742-1744, 2000.</ref>  This second meeting includes scientific presentations pertaining to all aspects of spinal surgery and treatment, not specifically relating to spinal deformity.  Also, because the IMAST meeting does not require a minimum 2-year post-operative patient follow-up for submitted research, the results of newer and more innovative surgical techniques can be presented for education and discussion.  In addition to the topics covered by the Annual SRS Meeting, the IMAST meeting also covers:

* Cervical Reconstruction
* Disc Replacement/Dynamic Stabilization
* Lumbar Degenerative

A number of smaller instructional courses and tutorials are also held throughout the year, including regional and international meetings.  These venues serve the continuing educational goals of the Scoliosis Research Society and its members.<ref>[http://www.srs.org Scoliosis Research Society] website - www.srs.org</ref>  Furthermore, as an organization dedicated to the study and treatment of spinal deformity, the SRS periodically releases position statements and holds symposia on various topics of interest, such as bracing,<ref>Nachemson AL, et al.: Effectiveness of treatment with a brace in girls who have adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. A prospective, controlled study based on data from the Brace Study of the Scoliosis Research Society, J Bone Joint Surg Am 77: 815-822, 1995.</ref> intraoperative neuromonitoring,<ref>Scoliosis Research Society. Position statement: Somatosensory evoked potential monitoring of neurologic spinal cord function during spinal surgery.  Scoliosis Research Society, September 1992.</ref><ref>Schwartz DM, et al.: Neurophysiological Detection of Impending Spinal Cord Injury During Scoliosis Surgery, J Bone Joint Surg Am 89: 2440-2449, 2007.</ref> and school scoliosis screening.<ref>Richards BS et al.: Screening for Idiopathic Scoliosis in Adolescents. An Information Statement, J Bone Joint Surg Am 90: 195-198, 2008.</ref>

The Scoliosis Research Society website serves as an educational resource to patients, and a professional resource for health care providers.  For patients, a variety of spinal deformity topics and treatment options are explained in layman's terms, and serve as a way for patients and their families to educate themselves about an otherwise complex medical condition. 

The "Glossary" contains a comprehensive list of spinal terminology to help patients and their families make sense of the complex nomenclature and terms that are used in discussing spinal deformity.  The "Find a Specialist" section offers patients access to the entire list of members of the Scoliosis Research Society, as well as their practice locations, contact information, and areas of expertise.

For health care professionals, the Scoliosis Research Society website contains educational materials, outcomes questionnaires, meeting schedules, and research opportunities.  These educational materials are written and designed for personnel more familiar with medical terminology.
