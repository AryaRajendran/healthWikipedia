'''Müllerian agenesis''' is a [[congenital malformation]] characterized by a failure of the [[Paramesonephric duct|Müllerian duct]] to develop, resulting in a missing [[uterus]] and [[fallopian tubes]] and variable malformations of the upper portion of the [[vagina]]. It is the third most common cause of primary [[amenorrhoea]] after pregnancy and gonadal failure (such as from [[Turner syndrome]]). The condition is also called '''Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome''' or '''MRKH''', named after [[August Franz Joseph Karl Mayer]], [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky]], [[Hermann Kuster]], and [[G. A. Hauser]]. A review of the literature can be found in the ''Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases'' <ref>{{cite journal|last=Morcel|first=Karine|coauthors=Laure Camborieux,  Daniel Guerrier|title=Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome|journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis|year=2007|volume=2|issue=13|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-13|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1832178/}}</ref> 

==Signs and Symptoms==
An individual with this condition is hormonally normal; that is, they will enter puberty with development of [[secondary sexual characteristics]] including [[thelarche]] and [[adrenarche]] (pubic hair). Their chromosome constellation will be 46,XX. [[Ovaries]] are intact and [[ovulation]] usually occurs. Typically, the [[vagina]] is shortened and intercourse may, in some cases, be difficult and painful. Medical examination supported by [[gynecologic ultrasonography]] demonstrates a complete or partial absence of the [[cervix]], [[uterus]], and [[vagina]].

If there is no [[uterus]], people with MRKH cannot carry a pregnancy. However, it is possible for them to have genetic offspring by [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) and [[surrogacy]]. Treatment by uterine transplantation is still in its infancy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.uk.msn.com/odd-news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=158217341|title=Woman 'to receive mother's womb'|date=13 June 2011|accessdate=date=13 June 2011}}</ref>

People with MRKH typically discover the condition when, during puberty years, the menstrual cycle does not start (primary [[amenorrhoea]]). Some find out earlier through surgeries for other conditions, such as a [[hernia]].

==Classification==
*Typical MRKH – Isolated uterovaginal [[aplasia]]/[[hypoplasia]]
**Prevalence – 64 percent 
*Atypical MRKH – Uterovaginal [[aplasia]]/[[hypoplasia]] with renal malformation or uterovaginal [[aplasia]]/[[hypoplasia]] with ovarian dysfunction
**Prevalence – 24 percent 
*MURCS syndrome – Uterovaginal [[aplasia]]/[[hypoplasia]] with renal malformation, skeletal malformation, and cardiac malformation
**Prevalence – 12 percent<ref name="EIGHT">{{cite pmid|19165657}}</ref>

==Causes==
[[WNT4]] has been clearly implicated in the atypical version of this disorder.  A genetic mutation causes a leucine to proline residue substitution at amino acid position 12.<ref name="EIGHT"></ref>  This occurrence reduces the intranuclear levels of [[β catenin]].  In addition, it removes the inhibition of steroidogenic enzymes like 3β-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase and 17α-hydroxylase.  Patients therefore have androgen excess.<ref name="EIGHT"></ref>  Furthermore, without [[WNT4]], the [[Paramesonephric duct|Müllerian duct]] is either deformed or absent.  Female reproductive organs, such as the [[cervix]], [[fallopian tubes]], [[ovaries]], and much of the [[vagina]], are hence affected.<ref>{{cite web| title=WNT4 Müllerian aplasia and ovarian dysfunction| publisher=Genetics Home Reference| accessdate=2012-08-18| url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/wnt4-mullerian-aplasia-and-ovarian-dysfunction}}</ref> 

An association with a deletion mutation in chromosome 17 (17q12) has been reported. The gene [[LHX1]] is located in this region and may be the cause of a number of these cases.<ref name=Ledig2012>Ledig S, Brucker S, Barresi G, Schomburg J, Rall K, Wieacker P (2012) Frame shift mutation of LHX1 is associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.

==Prevalence==
The estimated prevalence is 1 in 5000 people with XX chromosomes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Queen [[Amalia of Greece]] was found post mortem to have had the syndrome.<ref name=LossOfThrone>{{cite journal|last=Poulakou-Rebelakou|first=E|coauthors=C Tsiamis, N Tompros, G Creatsas|title=The lack of a child, the loss of a throne: the infertility of the first royal couple of Greece (1833–62)|journal=J R Coll Physicians Edinb|year=2011|volume=41|pages=73-33|url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_41_1/poulakou-rebelakou.pdf}}</ref> Her inability to provide an heir contributed to the overthrow of her husband, King [[Otto of Greece]].<ref name=LossOfThrone />

==Treatment==
Although there are treatments to increase the comfort in sexual intercourse, there are none that can make pregnancy possible. There are plans by United Kingdom and Swedish doctors for a [[uterine transplant]] that would allow these women to carry their own child, but no transplant has yet been successful in producing a child. Since [[ovaries]] are present, people with this condition can have genetic children through [[IVF]] with [[embryo transfer]] to a [[gestational carrier]]. Some also choose to adopt.

It may be necessary to use vaginal dilators or surgery to develop a functioning [[vagina]] to allow for penetrative sexual intercourse. A number of surgical approaches have been used. In the McIndoe procedure<ref>,{{cite journal

The [[Vecchietti procedure]] has been shown to result in a [[vagina]] that is comparable to a normal [[vagina]] in patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vecchietti G |title=[Creation of an artificial vagina in Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome] |language=Italian |journal=Attual Ostet Ginecol |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=131–47 |year=1965 |pmid=5319813 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fedele L, Bianchi S, Tozzi L, Borruto F, Vignali M |title=A new laparoscopic procedure for creation of a neovagina in Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome |journal=Fertil.

There the threads are attached to a traction device. The operation  takes about 45 minutes. The traction device is then tightened daily so the olive is pulled inwards and stretches the [[vagina]] by approximately 1&nbsp;cm per day, creating a [[vagina]] approximately 7&nbsp;cm deep in 7 days, although it can be more than this.<ref>[http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/NR/rdonlyres/07C53DB9-6C67-4375-86B4-DB9DF42635AD/21989/VecchiettiProcedure.pdf University College University Hospitals > Vecchietti Procedure] Retrieved on April 3, 2010</ref>
