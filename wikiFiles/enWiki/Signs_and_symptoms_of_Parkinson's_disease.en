'''Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease''' are varied. [[Parkinson's disease]] affects movement, producing motor symptoms.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Non-motor symptoms, which include [[dysautonomia]], cognitive and neurobehavioral problems, and sensory and sleep difficulties, are also common.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> When other diseases mimic Parkinson's disease they are categorized as [[Parkinsonism]].

*''[[Postural instability]]'': In the late stages [[postural instability]] is typical, which leads to [[Balance disorder|impaired balance]] and frequent falls, and secondarily to bone fractures.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Instability is often absent in the initial stages, especially in younger people.<ref name="pmid15172778"/> Up to 40% of the patients may experience falls and around 10% may have falls weekly, with number of falls being related to the severity of PD.

Other motor symptoms include:
*[[Gait]] and posture disturbances:
**Shuffling gait:<ref name=Jankovic2008/> gait is characterized by short steps, with feet barely leaving the ground. Small obstacles tend to cause the patient to trip.
**Decreased arm-swing.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
**Turning "en bloc": rather than the usual twisting of the neck and trunk and pivoting on the toes, PD patients keep their neck and trunk rigid, requiring multiple small steps to accomplish a turn.
**[[Camptocormia]]:<ref name=Jankovic2008/> stooped, forward-flexed posture.  In severe forms, the head and upper shoulders may be bent at a [[right angle]] relative to the trunk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lepoutre A, Devos D, Blanchard-Dauphin A, ''et al'' |title=A specific clinical pattern of camptocormia in Parkinson's disease |journal=J.

**[[Festinating gait|Festination]]:<ref name=Jankovic2008/> a combination of stooped posture, imbalance, and short steps.  It leads to a gait that gets progressively faster and faster, often ending in a fall.
**[[Gait freezing]]: also called motor blocks, is a manifestation of akinesia.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Gait freezing is characterized by a sudden inability to move the lower extremities which usually lasts less than 10 seconds.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> It may worsen in tight, cluttered spaces, when attempting to initiate gait or turning around, or when approaching a destination.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Freezing improves with treatment and also with behavioral techniques such as marching to command or following a given rhythm.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
**[[Dystonia]]:<ref name=Jankovic2008/> abnormal, sustained, painful twisting muscle contractions, often affecting the foot and ankle (mainly toe flexion and foot inversion) which often interferes with gait.
**[[Scoliosis]]<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
*Speech and swallowing disturbances.
**[[Hypophonia]]:<ref name=Jankovic2008/> soft speech.
**Monotonic speech: Speech quality tends to be soft, hoarse, and monotonous.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
**Festinating speech: excessively rapid, soft, poorly-intelligible speech.
**[[Drooling]]: most likely caused by a weak, infrequent swallow.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
**[[Dysphagia]]: impaired ability to swallow; which in the case of PD is probably related to an inability to initiate the [[swallowing reflex]] or by a too long laryngeal or oesophageal movement.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>  Can lead to [[aspiration pneumonia]].
**[[Dysarthria]]<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
*Other motor symptoms and signs:
**[[fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]

Parkinson's disease causes neuropsychiatric disturbances, which include mainly cognition, mood and behavior problems and can be as disabling as motor symptoms.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>

Cognitive disturbances occur even in the initial stages of the disease in some cases.<ref name="pmid18175397"/> A very high proportion of sufferers will have mild cognitive impairment as the disease advances.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Most common deficits in non-demented patients are:
*[[Executive dysfunction]], which translates into impaired set shifting, poor problem solving, and ﬂuctuations in  attention among other difficulties.<ref name="pmid18175397"/>
*[[Bradyphrenia|Slowed cognitive speed]] (Bradyphrenia).<ref name="pmid18175397"/>
*Memory problems; specifically in recalling learned information, with an important improvement with cues. Recognition is less impaired than free recall pointing towards a retrieving more than to an encoding problem.<ref name="pmid18175397"/>
*Regarding language, patients are found to have problems in [[verbal fluency test]]s.<ref name="pmid18175397">{{cite journal |author=Caballol N, Martí MJ, Tolosa E |title=Cognitive dysfunction and dementia in Parkinson disease |journal=Mov. Disord. |volume=22  |issue= Suppl 17|pages=S358–66 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=18175397 |doi=10.1002/mds.21677 |url=}}</ref>
*Visuospatial skills difficulties, which are seen when the person with PD is for example asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of line orientation.<ref name="pmid18175397"/>

Deficits tend to aggravate with time, developing in many cases into [[dementia]]. A person with PD has a sixfold increased risk of suffering it,<ref name=Jankovic2008/> and the overall rate in people with the disease is around 30%.<ref name="pmid18175397"/> Moreover, prevalence of dementia increases in relation to disease duration, going up to 80%.<ref name="pmid18175397"/> Dementia has been associated with a reduced [[quality of life]] in disease sufferers and [[caregiver]]s, increased [[Mortality rate|mortality]] and a higher probability of attending a [[nursing home]].<ref name="pmid18175397"/> 

Cognitive problems and dementia are usually accompanied by behavior and mood alterations, although these kind of changes are also more common in those patients without cognitive impairment than in the general population. Most frequent mood difficulties include:<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
*[[Depression (mood)|Depression]]:<ref name=Jankovic2008/> [[clinical depression|Depression]] is well recognized in PD, having been identified as "melancholia" by [[James Parkinson]] in his original report of the disease in 1817.

*[[Apathy]]<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
*[[Anxiety]]:<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Seventy percent of individuals with Parkinson's disease diagnosed with pre-existing depression go on to develop anxiety. Ninety percent of Parkinson's disease patients with pre-existing anxiety subsequently develop depression; [[apathy]] or [[abulia]].

[[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|Obsessive–compulsive]] behaviors such as [[craving]], [[binge eating]], [[hypersexuality]], [[pathological gambling]], or other, can also appear in PD, and have been related to a [[dopamine dysregulation syndrome]] associated with the medications for the disease.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> 

[[Psychosis|Psychotic]] symptoms are common in PD, generally associated with dopamine therapy. Symptoms of psychosis, or impaired reality testing, are either [[hallucination]]s, typically visual, less commonly auditory, and rarely in other domains including tactile, gustatory or olafactory, or [[delusion]]s, that is, irrational beliefs. Hallucinations are generally stereotyped and without emotional content. Initially patients usually have insight so that the hallucinations are benign in terms of their immediate impact but have poor prognostic implications, with increased risk of dementia, worsened psychotic symptoms and mortality. Delusions occur in about 5-10% of treated patients, and are considerably more disruptive, being paranoid in nature, of spousal infidelity or family abandonment. Psychosis is an independent risk factor for nursing home placement.<ref name="pmid20538500">{{cite journal |author=Friedman JH |title=Parkinson's disease psychosis 2010: A review article |journal=Parkinsonism Relat Disord |volume= 16|issue= 9|pages= 553–60|year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20538500 |doi=10.1016/j.parkreldis.2010.05.004 |url=}}</ref>

Hallucinations can occur in Parkinsonian syndromes for a variety of reasons. There is an overlap between Parkinson's disease and [[Lewy body dementia]], so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, hallucinations may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally non-threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however their carers often find this part of the disease most disturbing and the occurrence of hallucinations is a major risk factor for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an [[antipsychotic]] drug like [[quetiapine]], or offering carers a psychosocial intervention to help them cope with the hallucinations.

==Sleep==
[[File:Sleep EEG REM.png|thumb|[[Rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM) is altered in PD as opposed to the shown [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] [[Polysomnography|polysomnographic]] record representing normal REM]]

Sleep problems can be worsened by medications for PD, but they are a core feature of the disease.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> Some common symptoms are:
*Excessive daytime [[somnolence]].<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
*[[Insomnia]], characterized mostly by sleep fragmentation.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
*Disturbances in [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] sleep: disturbingly vivid dreams, and [[rapid eye movement behavior disorder]], characterized by acting out of dream content.<ref name=Jankovic2008/> It appears in a third of the patients and it is a risk factor for Parkinson's disease in the overall population.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>

==Perception==
*Impaired [[proprioception]] (the awareness of bodily position in three-dimensional space).
*Reduction or loss of sense of [[olfaction|smell]] ([[hyposmia]] or [[anosmia]]).<ref name=Jankovic2008/> It may be an early marker of the disease.<ref name=Jankovic2008/>
*[[Pain]]:<ref name=Jankovic2008/> neuropathic, muscle, joints, and tendons, attributable to tension, dystonia, rigidity, joint stiffness, and injuries associated with attempts at accommodation.
