'''Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis''' (AECB) are episodes of difficulty in breathing in a person with [[chronic bronchitis]].<ref name=medbroadcast>[http://www.medbroadcast.com/condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=285&next_page=y medbroadcast.com > Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis] Retrieved on Mars 13, 2010</ref>

In concomitant presence of [[emphysema]], the underlying condition can be classified as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), and the exacerbations termed "[[acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|acute exacerbation of COPD]]", and shares many characteristics with that of AECB.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The incidence of AECB varies depending on which definition is used, but by AECB definitions by ''Anthonisen et al.''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anthonisen NR, Manfreda J, Warren CP, Hershfield ES, Harding GK, Nelson NA |title=Antibiotic therapy in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |journal=Ann.

==Pathogenesis==
During AECB, breathing becomes much more difficult because of further narrowing of the airways, in addition to increased secretion of mucus, which often is thicker than usual.<ref name=medbroadcast/>

==Causes==
AECB can be caused by:
*[[Allergens]], e.g., pollens, wood or cigarette smoke, pollution<ref name=medbroadcast/>
*Toxins, including a variety of different chemicals<ref name=medbroadcast/>
*Acute viral or bacterial infections. The extra mucus in the airways in chronic bronchitis provides a good place for viruses and bacteria to grow. Bacterial infections are suspected when there is a yellow or greenish colour of the mucus, or it is thicker than usual.<ref name=medbroadcast/> However, coloured mucus is not [[Specificity (statistics)|specific]] to bacterial infections.<ref name=medbroadcast/> Common bacterial pathogens of acute exacerbations include ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]''.<ref name=bsac>[http://www.bsac.org.uk/pyxis/RTI/Chronic%20bronchitis/Chronic%20bronchitis.htm The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy > Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB)] Retrieved on Mars 13, 2010</ref> Less common bacterial pathogens include ''[[Chlamydia pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]''.<ref name=bsac/> Pathogens seen more frequently in patients with impaired lung function (FEV<35% of predicted) include ''[[Haemophilus parainfluenzae]]'' (after repeated use of antibiotics), ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' and [[gram-negative]],  [[opportunistic pathogen]]s like ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]''.<ref name=bsac/>

Although the condition of a patient with chronic bronchitis can become exacerbated by many other factors as well, the scope is generally restricted to the ones that cause the symptoms below.

==Symptoms==
An acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is associated with increased frequency and severity of coughing.<ref name=medbroadcast/> It is often accompanied by worsened chest congestion and discomfort. [[Shortness of breath]] and wheezing are present in many cases.<ref name=medbroadcast/>

In infection, there is often weakness, fever and chills. If due to a bacterial infection, the sputum may be slightly streaked with blood and coloured yellow or green.<ref name=medbroadcast/>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic criteria for acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis generally include a production of sputum that is [[Pus|purulent]]<ref name=bsac/> and may be thicker<ref name=medbroadcast/> than usual, but without evidence of [[pneumonia]] (which involves mainly the [[alveoli]] rather than the [[bronchi]]).<ref name=medbroadcast/> Also, diagnostic criteria may include an increased in frequency and severity of cough,<ref name=medbroadcast/> as well as increased shortness of breath.<ref name=bsac/>

A [[chest X-ray]] is usually performed on people with fever and, especially, [[hemoptysis]] (blood in the sputum), to rule out pneumonia and get information on the severity of the exacerbation. Hemoptysis may also indicate other, potentially fatal, medical conditions.<ref name=medbroadcast/>

A history of exposure to potential causes and evaluation of symptoms may help in revealing the cause of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, which helps in choosing the best treatment. A [[sputum culture]] can specify which strain is causing a bacterial AECB.<ref name=medbroadcast/> An early morning sample is preferred.<ref name=bsac/>

==Prevention==
Prevention of AECB include:
* [[Smoking cessation]] and avoiding dust, [[passive smoking]], and other inhaled irritants<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* Yearly [[influenza vaccine|influenza]] and [[pneumococcal vaccine]]<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* Regular exercise, appropriate rest, and healthy nutrition<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* Avoiding people currently infected with e.g. cold and influenza<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* Maintaining good fluid intake and humidifying the home, in order to help reduce the formation of thick sputum and chest congestion.<ref name=medbroadcast/>

==Treatment==
Treatment is often started before the test results confirm the condition.<ref name=medbroadcast/>

Treatment of AECB may include:
* [[Mucolytic agent]]s may be used to help liquefy thick mucus, facilitating clearance from the airways.<ref name=medbroadcast/>  Thinning of mucus may also be done by drinking plenty of fluids.<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* Inhaled [[bronchodilator]]s open up the airways in the lungs.<ref name="pmid11281745">{{cite journal |author=Bach PB, Brown C, Gelfand SE, McCrory DC |title=Management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a summary and appraisal of published evidence |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=134 |issue=7 |pages=600–20 |year=2001 |pmid=11281745 |doi=}}</ref> These include [[salbutamol]] and [[terbutaline]] (both [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists]]), and ipratropium (an [[anticholinergic]]).<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* [[Antibiotics]] are used if a bacterial infection is the suspected cause.<ref name=medbroadcast/>  However, antibiotics will not treat exacerbations caused by viruses. Viral infections will usually be cured with time with the aid of proper rest and care. Still, other medications may be needed to control symptoms.<ref name=medbroadcast/> Lipid-soluble antibiotics such as [[macrolide]]s, [[tetracycline]]s, and [[quinolone]]s penetrate the lung tissue well.<ref name=bsac/> Macrolides are more active against ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' than the tetracyclines and the older quinolones.<ref name=bsac/> Within the macrolides, newer ones are more active against ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' than the older erythromycin. Regimens should generally be given for five days.<ref name=bsac/> Choice of antibiotics is also dependent on the severity of chronic bronchitis:
** "Simple" chronic bronchitis is generally where the patient is 65 years or less, has fewer than four exacerbations per year, has minimal or moderate impairment in respiratory function and no [[comorbidity|comorbid disease]].<ref name=bsac/> In patients with "simple" chronic bronchitis, therapy should be targeted towards ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Moraxella catarrhalis'', ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', and possibly pathogens of [[atypical pneumonia]].<ref name=bsac/> The [[first-line treatment]] is a [[beta-lactam antibiotic]] such as [[amoxicillin]]. The choice will depend on resistance patterns.<ref name=bsac/> In patients with [[penicillin allergy]], [[doxycycline]] or [[trimethoprim]] are preferred.<ref name=bsac/>
** More complicated bronchitis may be when the patient is more than 65 years old, has four or more exacerbations per year, has an [[FEV1/FVC ratio]] of less than 50% on [[spirometry]], has failed to respond to previous antibiotic treatment, and/or has comorbidity.<ref name=bsac/> In these cases, treatment should be aimed at [[Gram-negative bacteria]] and the possibility of high [[antibiotic resistance]] should be considered.<ref name=bsac/> Sputum culture results are of great value in determining antibiotic resistance.<ref name=bsac/> First-line treatment is [[cefuroxime]] or [[co-amoxiclav]].<ref name=bsac/> Third-line treatment, as well as treatment in penicillin-allergic patients, is a [[fluoroquinolone]] such as [[ciprofloxacin]].<ref name=bsac/> An agent active against ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' may have to be added.<ref name=bsac/>
* [[Corticosteroid]]s such as [[prednisone]] reduce inflammation in the airways.<ref name="pmid11281745"/> They are usually used for short periods.<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* [[Theophylline]], taken orally, helps to ease the difficulty of breathing. It may be added if the patient is not already taking it for the chronic bronchitis.<ref name=medbroadcast/>
* [[Oxygen therapy]] should be initiated if there is a substantial risk of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. If oxygen is required on an ongoing basis, a [[portable oxygen concentrator]] can be used.<ref name=medbroadcast/>

There should also be a "care plan" in case of future exacerbations. Patients may watch for symptoms, such as shortness of breath, change in character or amount of mucus, and start self-treatment as discussed with a health care provider. This allows for treatment right away until a doctor can be seen.<ref name=medbroadcast/>
