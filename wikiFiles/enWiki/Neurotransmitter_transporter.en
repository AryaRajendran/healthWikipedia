'''[[Neurotransmitter]] transporters''' are a class of [[membrane transport protein]]s that span the [[cellular membrane]]s of neurons. Their primary function is to carry [[neurotransmitters]] across these membranes and to direct their further transport to specific intracellular locations.  There are more than twenty types of neurotransmitter transporters.<ref name=Iversen>{{cite journal |author=Iversen L |title=Neurotransmitter transporters: fruitful targets for CNS drug discovery |journal=Mol. Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=357–62 |year=2000 |month=July |pmid=10889545 |url=http://www.biopsychiatry.com/transporters.htm |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4000728}}</ref>

'''Vesicular transporters''' move neurotransmitters into [[synaptic vesicle]]s, regulating the concentrations of substances within them.<ref name=Johnson>{{cite journal |author=Johnson J, Tian N, Caywood MS, Reimer RJ, Edwards RH, Copenhagen DR |title=Vesicular neurotransmitter transporter expression in developing postnatal rodent retina: GABA and glycine precede glutamate |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=518–29 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12533612 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/23/2/518}}</ref>  Vesicular transporters rely on a [[proton gradient]] created by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) in order to carry out their work:  [[vesicle ATPase]] hydrolyzes ATP, causing protons to be pumped into the [[Synaptic vesicle]]s and creating a proton gradient.   Then the efflux of protons from the vesicle provides the energy to bring the neurotransmitter into the vesicle.<ref name=Kandel>{{cite book |author=[[Eric R. Kandel|Kandel ER]], Schwartz JH, Jessell TM |title=[[Principles of neural science]] |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2000 |page=287 |isbn=0-8385-7701-6 |edition=4th}}</ref>

Neurotransmitter transporters frequently use [[electrochemical gradient]]s that exist across cell membranes to carry out their work.  For example, some transporters use energy obtained by the [[cotransport]], or [[symport]], of [[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] in order to move [[glutamate]] across membranes. Such neurotransporter cotransport systems are highly diverse, as recent development indicates that uptake systems are generally selective and associate with a specific neurotransmitter.<ref name=Susan>{{cite journal |last1=Amara |first1=Susan G. |last2=Kuhar |first2=Michael J. |year=1993 |title=Neurotransmitter Transporters:Recent Progress |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=73-93 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.16.030193.000445}}</ref>

Normally, transporters in the [[Synapse|synaptic]] membrane serve to remove neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and prevent their action or bring it to an end.  However, on occasion transporters can work in reverse, transporting neurotransmitters into the synapse, allowing these neurotransmitters to bind to their [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s and exert their effect.  This "nonvesicular release" of neurotransmitters is used by some cells, such as [[amacrine cell]]s in the [[retina]], as a normal form of neurotransmitter release.<ref name=Kandel295>{{cite book |author=[[Eric R. Kandel|Kandel ER]], Schwartz JH, Jessell TM |title=[[Principles of neural science]] |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2000 |page=295 |isbn=0-8385-7701-6 |edition=4th}}</ref>

== Types ==

Specific types of neurotransmitter transporters include the following:

* [[Glutamate transporter|Glutamate/aspartate transporter]]s, including:
** [[SLC1A3|Excitatory amino acid transporter 1]] (EAAT1)
** [[SLC1A2|Excitatory amino acid transporter 2]] (EAAT2)
** [[SLC1A1|Excitatory amino acid transporter 3]] (EAAT3)
** [[SLC1A6|Excitatory amino acid transporter 4]] (EAAT4)
** [[SLC1A7|Excitatory amino acid transporter 5]] (EAAT5)
** [[Vesicular glutamate transporter 1]] (VGLUT1)
** [[Vesicular glutamate transporter 2]] (VGLUT2)
** [[Vesicular glutamate transporter 3]] (VGLUT3)

* [[GABA transporter]]s, including:
** [[GABA transporter type 1]] (GAT1)
** [[GABA transporter type 2]] (GAT2)
** [[GABA transporter type 3]] (GAT3)
** [[Betaine transporter]] (BGT1)
** [[Vesicular GABA transporter]] (VGAT)

* [[Glycine transporter]]s, including:
** [[Glycine transporter 1|Glycine transporter type 1]] (GlyT1)
** [[Glycine transporter type 2]] (GlyT2)

* [[Monoamine transporter]]s, including:
** [[Dopamine transporter]] (DAT)
** [[Norepinephrine transporter]] (NET)
** [[Serotonin transporter]] (SERT)
** [[Vesicular monoamine transporter 1]] (VMAT1)
** [[Vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2)

* [[Equilibrative nucleoside transporter|Adenosine transporter]]s, including:
** [[Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1]] (ENT1)
** [[Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2]] (ENT2)
** [[Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3]] (ENT3)
** [[Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 4]] (ENT4)

* [[Vesicular acetylcholine transporter]] (VAChT)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weihe E, Tao-Cheng JH, Schäfer MK, Erickson JD, Eiden LE |title=Visualization of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter in cholinergic nerve terminals and its targeting to a specific population of small synaptic vesicles |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. |volume=93 |issue=8 |pages=3547–52 |year=1996 |month=April |pmid=8622973 |pmc=39647 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.93.8.3547|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8622973}}</ref>

Note that there is no plasmalemmal [[acetylcholine]] transporter, as acetylcholine is terminated via rapid metabolism into [[choline]] by [[cholinesterase]] [[enzyme]]s, and choline is subsequently transported back into the cell and reconverted into acetylcholine.

Transporters associated with [[histamine]] and the [[endocannabinoid]]s have not yet been identified.

== Clinical significance ==

[[Antidepressant]]s such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]], [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRIs]] and [[tricyclic antidepressant|TCAs]] suppress the activity of serotonin and/or norepinephrine transporters, preventing the reuptake of targeted neurotransmitters from the [[synaptic cleft]].

[[Psychostimulant]]s like [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]]s, and [[methylphenidate]] act by inhibiting and/or reversing the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. Some [[dissociative]]s like [[phencyclidine]] and [[ketamine]] are also dopamine transporter blockers.

[[Tiagabine]], a drug used as an [[anticonvulsant]], acts by inhibiting the GABA transporter 1.
