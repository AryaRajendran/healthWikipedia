The '''Schmidt sting pain index''' is a [[pain scale]] rating the relative [[pain]] caused by different hymenopteran stings. It is mainly the work of [[Justin O. Schmidt]], an [[entomologist]] at the [[Carl Hayden]] Bee Research Center in Arizona.  Schmidt has published a number of papers on the subject, and claims to have been stung by the majority of stinging [[Hymenoptera]].

His original paper in 1984 was an attempt to systematize and compare the [[Hemolysis|hemolytic]] properties of insect venoms.<ref>Schmidt, J. O., Blum, M. S., and Overal, W. L. "Hemolytic activities of stinging insect venoms", Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology, 1:155–160, 1984.</ref> The index contained in the paper started from 0 for stings that are completely ineffective against humans, progressed through 2, a familiar pain such as a common bee or [[Vespula vulgaris|wasp]] sting and finished at 4 for the most painful stings. In the conclusion, some descriptions of the most painful examples were given, e.g.: "''[[Paraponera clavata]]'' stings induced immediate, excruciating pain and numbness to pencil-point pressure, as well as trembling in the form of a totally uncontrollable urge to shake the affected part."

Subsequently, Schmidt has refined his scale, culminating in a paper published in 1990, which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera. Schmidt described some of the experiences in vivid detail.<ref>{{cite book | author=Schmidt, Justin O. | chapter=Hymenoptera Venoms: Striving Toward the Ultimate Defense Against Vertebrates | editor=D.

An entry in ''[[The Straight Dope]]'' reported that "implausibly exact numbers" which do not appear in any of Schmidt’s published scientific papers were "wheedled out of him" by [[Outside (magazine)|''Outside'']] magazine for an article it published in 1996.<ref name=dope>Cecil Adams (May 11, 2012) [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/3052/did-the-creator-of-the-schmidt-sting-pain-index-volunteer-to-get-stung-by-everything-on-earth ''Did the creator of the Schmidt Sting Pain Index volunteer to get stung by everything on earth?''], ''The Straight Dope''</ref>
