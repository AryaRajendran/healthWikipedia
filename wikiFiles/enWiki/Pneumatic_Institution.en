The '''Pneumatic Institution''' (also referred to as '''Pneumatic Institute''') was a medical research facility in [[Bristol]], England, in 1799–1802. It was established by physician and science writer [[Thomas Beddoes]] to study the medical effects of the gases that had recently been discovered. [[Humphry Davy]] headed the ''Institution's'' laboratory, examining the effects of ''laughing gas'' on himself and others, and [[James Watt]] designed much of the lab's equipment.

===Preliminaries===
After [[Lavoisier]] had established the role of [[oxygen]] in animal respiration, members of the [[Lunar Society]], such as [[Joseph Priestley]] (who had co-discovered oxygen), originated [[pneumatic chemistry]], which eventually led to the establishment of the ''Pneumatic Institution''.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Ether Anaesthesia 1842–1900 | author=Duncum, Barbara M. | journal=Postgrad Med J. | year=1946 | month=October | volume=22 | issue=252 | pages=280–281 | pmc=2478430 | pmid=20276652}}</ref>

[[Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire]], who was unusually educated about Chemistry,<ref name="georgina"/> visited Thomas Beddoes in his laboratory in Hope Square, Bristol, in December 1793.<ref name="georgina"/> He had set it up earlier that year to study possible medical uses of the recently discovered gases.<ref name="georgina"/> During her second, extended, visit, "the idea of replacing the existing outpatient facility with a hospital—a Medical Pneumatic Institution—was first formulated."<ref name="georgina">{{cite journal | title=Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, and Princess Diana: a parallel | author=Bergman, Norman A. | journal=J R Soc Med. | year=1998 | month=April | volume=91 | issue=4 | pages=217–219 | pmc=1296647 | pmid=9659313}}</ref> In 1794, she tried to persuade [[Sir Joseph Banks]], who was [[President of the Royal Society]] of London at the time, to lend support to Beddoes' efforts.<ref name="georgina"/> Sir Joseph refused, citing scientific objections in addition to his political concerns about Beddoes' sympathising with the [[French revolution]].<ref name="georgina"/> Even a supporting request from Watt did not change Banks' mind.<ref name ="georgina"/>

===Establishment===
[[File:6 Dowry Square, Bristol.jpg|thumb|6 Dowry Square, Bristol, site of the Pneumatic Institution]]
Beddoes had moved from Oxford in 1793 and established himself as a physician. He moved near to the [[Hotwells]] area of Bristol where many sufferers from tuberculosis were gathered in the hope of a cure. By 1794 Beddoes had arranged for the manufacture of suitable apparatus by the firm of [[Boulton and Watt]] and the first of the "pneumatic patients" was a Mr Knight of [[Painswick]], whom Beddoes treated with "unrespirable airs" for a deep-seated ulcer of the pelvis. By 5 March 1795 Beddoes was reporting successful treatment of paralytic patients and ordering an apparatus and oxygen for a Mr Gladwell in Clifton.<ref name="stansfields"/>

Between 1792 and 1798, Beddoes had collected and published many "case histories" sent to him by other sympathetic physicians, from many parts of the country, and principally concerning the inhalation of [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]].<ref name="stansfields"/>

In November 1798, Beddoes rented two buildings at 6 and 7 [[Dowry Square]], in Hotwells,<ref name="hdcontrib" /> and in March 1799 the laboratory was moved into the smaller one and the ''Institution'' was publicly announced.<ref name="hdcontrib">{{cite journal | title=Humphry Davy's Contribution to Anæsthesia | author=Cartwright, F. F. | journal=Proc R Soc Med. | year=1950 | month=July | volume=43 | issue=7 | pages=571–578 | pmc=2081366 | pmid=15440782}}</ref> Beddoes anticipated that scientific investigations and medical treatment would be carried out side by side.

===Humphry Davy's experiments===
In March 1798, the curiosity of Humphry Davy was aroused by dramatic statements made in Samuel Latham Mitchell's ''Remarks on the gaseous oxyd of nitrogen and its effects (1795)'' that nitrous oxide had disastrous effects whether inhaled or in
contact with the skin, that it was indeed the very "principle of contagion".<ref name="stansfields"/>

Davy joined the ''Pneumatic Institution'' in 1798 as the laboratory operator,<ref name="stansfields">{{cite journal | title=Dr. Thomas Beddoes and James Watt: Preparatory Work 1794–96 for the Bristol Pneumatic Institute | author=Stansfield, Dorothy A., Stansfield, Ronald G. | journal=Medical History | year=1986 | issue=30 | pages=276–302 | pmc=1139651 | pmid=3523076}}</ref> largely through the recommendation of [[Davies Giddy]], and it was here that he undertook experiments that included himself inhaling [[nitrous oxide]],<ref name="general anaesthesia">{{cite web | url=http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/ | title=Utopian Surgery. Early arguments against anaesthesia in surgery, dentistry and childbirth | accessdate=April 6, 2011 | author=Pearce, David | year=2008}}</ref> which he called ''laughing gas'' for its effects.<ref name="general anaesthesia" /> Davy was to describe his work at the Institution in his ''Researches, chemical and philosophical, chiefly concerning nitrous oxide, or dephlogisticated nitrous air, and its respiration'' (London, Murray, 1800).<ref name="stansfields"/>

This and other gases were administered, without charge, to willing subjects, particularly those with diseases considered to be incurable at the time.<ref name="ot150" /> Although the initial aim had been to treat patients with tuberculosis, most of the patients treated suffered from some form of paralysis.<ref name="stansfields"/>

===James Watt's involvement===
[[Image:Watt apparatus 1.JPG|thumb|Apparatus designed by James Watt in preparation of the Pneumatic Institution]]
James Watt supported the ''Institution'' because conventional methods had failed to help against his son's [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] (known as ''consumption'' at the time), which had previously claimed his daughter Jessie.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://digital.nls.uk/scientists/biographies/james-watt/index.html | title=James Watt biography&nbsp;— Science Hall of fame&nbsp;— National Library of Scotland | accessdate=April 6, 2011 | year=2009 | publisher=National Library of Scotland}}</ref>

In the last days of Jessie Watt's illness, on the advice of [[Erasmus Darwin]], Beddoes had been called in to administer his new respiritory treatment and, although lacking suitable apparatus, had arranged for the girl to breathe "fixt air" ([[carbon dioxide]]). The treatment, not surprisingly, had no beneficial effect and Watt's daughter had died.<ref name="stansfields"/>

Watt designed many of the apparatuses and techniques necessary to produce and administer various gases.<ref name="bol">{{cite journal | title=Breath of life: the evolution of oxygen therapy | author=Grainge, C. | journal=J R Soc Med. | year=2004 | month=October | volume=97 | issue=10 | pages=page 489 | pmc=1079621 | pmid=15459264}}</ref>

===Disestablishment and legacy===
The ''Pneumatic Institution'' was converted into a normal hospital when [[typhus]] broke out in Bristol in 1800.<ref name="bol"/> Davy left in 1801 to join Sir Joseph at the [[Royal Institution]].<ref name = "ot150"/> The Bristol ''Pneumatic Institution'' closed down in 1802.<ref name = "ot150">{{cite web | url=http://www.lakesidepress.com/pulmonary/papers/ox-hist/ox-hist1.html | title=Oxygen Therapy: The First 150 Years | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Martin, Lawrence}}</ref> Many of the techniques and tools developed by Watt for the ''Pneumatic Institution'' are still used in modern medicine.<ref name="bol" />
