In [[radiology]], a '''solitary pulmonary nodule''' ('''SPN''') or '''coin lesion''' is a [[tumor|mass]] in the [[lung]] smaller than 3 centimeters in diameter. It can be an [[incidentaloma|incidental finding]] found in up to 0.2% of [[chest X-ray]]s<ref name="NEJM-cp">{{cite journal |author=Ost D, Fein AM, Feinsilver SH |title=Clinical practice.

The [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]] most commonly represents a [[benign]] tumor such as a [[granuloma]] or [[hamartoma]], but in around 20% of cases it represents a [[malignant]] [[cancer]],<ref name="pmid18402653"/> especially in [[elderly|older adults]] and [[tobacco smoking|smokers]]. Conversely, 10 to 20% of patients with [[lung cancer]] are diagnosed in this way.<ref name="pmid18402653"/> Thus, the possibility of cancer needs to be excluded through further radiological studies and interventions, possibly including surgical resection. The [[prognosis]] depends on the underlying condition.

==Definition==
A solitary pulmonary nodulus needs to be separated from larger lung tumors, smaller infiltrates or masses with other accompanying characteristics. An often used formal radiological definition is the following: a single lesion in the lung completely surrounded by lung [[parenchyma]] (functional tissue) with a diameter less than 3 cm and without associated [[pneumonia]], [[atelectasis]] (lung collapse) or [[lymphadenopathy|lymphadenopathies]] (swollen lymph nodes).<ref name="pmid12527568">{{cite journal |author=Tan BB, Flaherty KR, Kazerooni EA, Iannettoni MD |title=The solitary pulmonary nodule |journal=Chest |volume=123 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=89S–96S |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12527568 |doi= 10.1378/chest.123.1_suppl.89S|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12527568}}</ref><ref name="Radiology2006">{{cite journal |author=Winer-Muram HT |title=The solitary pulmonary nodule |journal=Radiology |volume=239 |issue=1 |pages=34–49 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16567482 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2391050343 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16567482}}</ref>

== Causes ==
Not every round spot on a radiological image is a coin lesion: it should not be confused with the projection of a structure of the [[chest wall]] or skin, such as a nipple, a healing [[rib fracture]] or [[electrocardiography|electrocardiographic]] monitoring.

The most important cause to exclude is a form of lung cancer, including rare forms such as primary pulmonary [[lymphoma]], [[carcinoid tumor]] and a solitary [[metastasis]] to the lung (common unrecognised primary tumor sites are [[melanoma]]s, [[sarcoma]]s or [[testicular cancer]]). Benign tumors in the lung include [[hamartoma]]s and [[chondroma]]s.

The most common benign coin lesion is a [[granuloma]] (inflammatory [[Nodule (medicine)|nodule]]), for example due to [[tuberculosis]] or a [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]]. Other infectious causes include a [[pulmonary abscess]], [[pneumonia]] (including [[Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia]]) or rarely [[nocardia]]l infection or worm infection (such as [[dirofilariasis]] or [[Dirofilaria immitis|dog heartworm]] infestation). Lung nodules can also occur in [[immune disorder]]s such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] or [[Wegener's granulomatosis]].

An SPN can be found to be an [[arteriovenous malformation]], a [[hematoma]] or an [[infarction]] zone. It may also be caused by [[bronchial atresia]], [[sequestering|sequestration]], an inhaled [[foreign body]] or [[pleural plaque]].

== Initial evaluation ==
The medical history, physical examination and imaging results form the basis of the initial risk assessment and determine the further course of action. Most patients will have a [[CT scan]].

===Radiological features===
[[Image:Thorax CT peripheres Brronchialcarcinom li OF.jpg|thumb|A solitary pulmonary nodule (''indicated by the purple arrow'') on a CT scan of the chest.]]
Several features help to distinguish benign conditions from possible lung cancer. The first parameter is the size of the lesion: the smaller, the less risk for malignant cancer.<ref name="Radiology2006"/> Benign causes tend to have a well defined border, whereas lobulated lesions or those with an irregular margin extending into the neighbouring tissue tend to be malignant.<ref name="Radiology2006"/>

If there is a central cavity, then a thin wall points to a benign cause whereas a thick wall is associated with malignancy (especially 4mm or less versus 16mm or more).<ref name="Radiology2006"/> In lung cancer, cavitation can represent central tumor [[necrosis]] (tissue death) or secondary [[abscess]] formation. If the walls of an airway are visible (air bronchogram), [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]] is a possibility.

An SPN often contains calcifications. Certain patterns of calcification are reassuring, such as the popcorn-like appearance of hamartoma.<ref name="NEJM-cp"/> An SPN with a density below 15 [[Hounsfield unit]]s on [[computed tomography]] tends to be benign, whereas malignant tumors often measure more than 20 Hounsfield units. Fatty tissue inside hamartomas will have a strongly negative value on the [[Hounsfield scale]].

The growth velocity of a lesion is also informative: very fast or very slow growing tumors are rarely malignant, in contrary to inflammatory or congenital conditions.<ref name="pmid10682770">{{cite journal |author=Erasmus JJ, Connolly JE, McAdams HP, Roggli VL |title=Solitary pulmonary nodules: Part I. Morphologic evaluation for differentiation of benign and malignant lesions |journal=Radiographics |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=43–58 |year=2000 |pmid=10682770 |doi= |url=http://radiographics.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10682770}}</ref> It is therefore important to retrieve previous imaging studies to see if a lesion was presented and how fast its volume is increasing. This is more difficult for nodules smaller than 1 centimeter. Moreover, the predictive value of stable lesion over a period of 2 years has been found to be rather low and unreliable.<ref name="pmid10682770"/>

===Patient features===
Several patient factors may influence the likelihood of a benign versus a malignant condition: these include previous exposure to smoke or other [[carcinogen]]s such as [[asbestos]], and previously diagnosed cancer or [[respiratory infection]]s. A patient with airway symptoms, especially coughing up blood ([[hemoptysis]]), is more likely to have cancer compared to a patient with no respiratory symptoms.

==Work-up==
[[Image:FDG-PET initial study solitary pulmonary nodule Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.jpg|thumb|[[FDG-PET]] study of a 71-year-old woman with a solitary pulmonary nodule (''thin arrow'') in the left lower lobe near the heart. The scan also revealed abnormal increased activity at the [[gastro-esophageal junction]] (''thick arrow''). The final diagnosis was [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] at both sites.]]

The work-up in patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule is based on an initial risk assessment. If the risk of malignancy is thought to be low, follow-up imaging (usually serial CT scans) can be planned at a later time. The frequency of further scans can be determined by the patient's risk for cancer and the size of the nodule.<ref name="pmid16244247">{{cite journal |author=MacMahon H, Austin JH, Gamsu G, ''et al.'' |title=Guidelines for management of small pulmonary nodules detected on CT scans: a statement from the Fleischner Society |journal=Radiology |volume=237 |issue=2 |pages=395–400 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16244247 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2372041887 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16244247}}</ref> If the initial impression is that there is a high likelihood of cancer, then a surgical intervention is appropriate (provided that the patient is fit for surgery).

If there is an intermediate risk of malignancy, further imaging with [[positron emission tomography]] (PET scan) is appropriate (if available). Around 95% of patients with a malignant nodule will have an abnormal PET scan, while around 78% of patients with a benign nodule will look normal on PET (this is the test [[sensitivity and specificity]]).<ref name="JAMA-2001">{{cite journal |author=Gould MK, Maclean CC, Kuschner WG, Rydzak CE, Owens DK |title=Accuracy of positron emission tomography for diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and mass lesions: a meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=285 |issue=7 |pages=914–24 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11180735 |doi= 10.1001/jama.285.7.914|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11180735}}</ref> Thus, an abnormal PET scan will reliably pick up cancer, but several other types of nodules (inflammatory or infectious, for example) will also show up on a PET scan. If the nodule has a diameter below 1 centimeter, PET scans are often avoided because there is an increased risk of [[false-negative|falsely normal]] results.<ref name="JAMA-2001"/><ref name="pmid17412254">{{cite journal |author=Khan A |title=ACR Appropriateness Criteria on solitary pulmonary nodule |journal=J Am Coll Radiol |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=152–5 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17412254 |doi=10.1016/j.jacr.2006.12.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1546-1440(06)00694-6}}</ref><ref name="pmid17409830">{{cite journal |author=Vansteenkiste JF, Stroobants SS |title=PET scan in lung cancer: current recommendations and innovation |journal=J Thorac Oncol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=71–3 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=17409830 |doi= 10.1097/01243894-200601000-00014|url=}}</ref> Cancerous lesions usually have a high [[metabolism]] on PET, as demonstrated by their high uptake of [[fluorodeoxyglucose|FDG]] (a radioactive sugar). If the lesion is found on further imaging to be suspicious, it should be surgically excised (via [[thoracotomy]] or [[Thoracic surgery, video-assisted|video-assisted thoracic surgery]]) to confirm the diagnosis by [[histopathology|microscopical examination]].

In selected cases, nodules can also be sampled through the airways using [[bronchoscopy]] or through the chest wall using [[Needle aspiration biopsy|needle aspiration]] (which can be done under CT guidance). Needle aspiration can only retrieve groups of cells for [[cytopathology|cytology]] and not a tissue cylinder or [[biopsy]], precluding evaluation of the tissue architecture. Theoretically, this makes the diagnosis of benign conditions more difficult, although rates higher than 90% have been reported.<ref name="pmid8628859">{{cite journal |author=Klein JS, Salomon G, Stewart EA |title=Transthoracic needle biopsy with a coaxially placed 20-gauge automated cutting needle: results in 122 patients |journal=Radiology |volume=198 |issue=3 |pages=715–20 |year=1996 |month=March |pmid=8628859 |doi= |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8628859}}</ref> Complications of the latter technique include hemorrhage into the lung and air leak in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall ([[pneumothorax]]).
