'''Hodgkin's lymphoma''', also known as '''Hodgkin lymphoma''' and previously known as '''Hodgkin's disease''', is a type of [[lymphoma]], which is a [[cancer]] originating from [[white blood cell]]s called [[lymphocyte]]s. It was named after [[Thomas Hodgkin]], who first described abnormalities in the [[lymph system]] in 1832.<ref name="Hoppe2007">{{cite book |author=Hellman S |editor=Hoppe RT, Mauch PT, Armitage JO, Diehl V, Weiss LM |title=Hodgkin Lymphoma |chapter=Brief Consideration of Thomas Hodgkin and His Times |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |edition=2nd |pages=3–6 |isbn=0-7817-6422-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="Hodgkin1832">{{cite journal |title=On some morbid experiences of the absorbent glands and spleen |author=Hodgkin T |journal=Med Chir Trans |volume=17 |pages=69–97 |year=1832}}</ref>

Hodgkin's lymphoma is characterized by the orderly spread of disease from one [[lymph node]] group to another and by the development of [[B symptoms|systemic symptoms]] with advanced disease. When Hodgkins cells are examined microscopically, multinucleated [[Reed–Sternberg cell]]s (RS cells) are the characteristic [[histopathology|histopathologic]] finding.

Hodgkin's lymphoma may be treated with [[radiation therapy]], [[chemotherapy]], or [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]], with the choice of treatment depending on the age and sex of the patient and the stage, bulk, and histological subtype of the disease. The disease occurrence shows two peaks: the first in young adulthood (age 15–35) and the second in those over 55 years old.<ref>Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program (www.seer.cancer.gov) [http://canques.seer.cancer.gov/cgi-bin/cq_submit?dir=seer2006&db=4&rpt=LINE&sel=1^0^79^0^^^&x=Age%20at%20diagnosis^6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20&y=Race^0,1,2^Sex^0,1,2&dec=1&template=null Cancer.gov]</ref>

The overall 5-year relative survival for 2001–2007 from 17 [[Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results|SEER]] geographic areas was 83.9%.<ref name="seer">{{cite web|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/hodg.html |title=Hodgkin Lymphoma—SEER Stat Fact Sheets |publisher=Seer.cancer.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> Since many patients are young, they often live 40 years or more after treatment. However, few studies follow patients as long as 25 years, and those studies are of older treatments with more life-threatening adverse effects. There is insufficient data available about the long-term outcomes of newer, less-toxic regimens and ones which limit radiation exposure. Radiation treatments, and some chemotherapy drugs, pose a risk of causing potentially fatal secondary cancers, heart disease, and lung disease 40 or more years later. Modern treatments greatly minimize the chances of these late effects.<ref name="Armitage2010">

Patients with a history of [[infectious mononucleosis]] because of [[Epstein–Barr virus]] (EBV) may have an increased risk of HL, but the precise contribution of Epstein–Barr virus remains largely unknown.<ref>K J Flavell and P G Murray.

==Classification==
===Types===
Classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (excluding [[nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma]]) can be subclassified into 4 [[Anatomical pathology|pathologic]] subtypes based upon Reed–Sternberg cell [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and the composition of the reactive cell [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrate]] seen in the [[lymph node]] [[biopsy]] specimen (the cell composition around the Reed–Sternberg cell(s)).
{| class="wikitable"
| '''Name''' || '''Description''' || '''[[ICD-10]]''' || '''[[ICD-O]]'''
 |-
 | [[Nodular sclerosis|Nodular sclerosing HL]] || Is the most common subtype and is composed of large [[tumor]] '''''nodules''''' showing scattered lacunar classical RS cells set in a background of reactive [[lymphocytes]], [[eosinophils]] and [[plasma cells]] with varying degrees of collagen fibrosis/'''''sclerosis'''''. || {{ICD10|C|81|1|c|81}} || {{ICDO|9663|3}}

[[Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma]] expresses [[CD20]], and is not currently considered a form of classical Hodgkin's.

For the other forms, although the traditional [[B cell]] markers (such as [[CD20]]) are not expressed on all cells,<ref name="urlHMDS: Hodgkins Lymphoma">{{cite web |url=http://www.hmds.org.uk/hl.html |title=HMDS: Hodgkin's Lymphoma |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Reed–Sternberg cells are usually of B cell origin.<ref name="pmid12078890">{{cite journal |author=Küppers R, Schwering I, Bräuninger A, Rajewsky K, Hansmann ML |title=Biology of Hodgkin's lymphoma |journal=Ann.

Hodgkin's cells produce [[interleukin-21]] (IL-21), which was once thought to be exclusive to [[T cell]]s. This feature may explain the behavior of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, including clusters of other immune cells gathered around HL cells (infiltrate) in cultures.<ref name="blood-112-8">{{cite journal | author = Lamprecht B, Kreher S, Anagnostopoulos, I, Johrens k, Monteleone G, Junt F, Stein H, Janz M, Dorken B, Mathas S| title = Aberrant expression of the Th2 cytokine IL-21 in Hodgkin lymphoma cells regulates STAT3 signaling and attracts Treg cells via regulation of MIP-3a | journal = Blood | volume = 112 | issue = Oct 2008 | pages = 3339–3347 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18684866| doi = 10.1182/blood-2008-01-134783| url = http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/112/8/3339 }}</ref>

===Staging===
The staging is the same for both Hodgkin's as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

After Hodgkin's lymphoma is diagnosed, a patient will be ''[[Cancer staging|staged]]'': that is, they will undergo a series of tests and procedures that will determine what areas of the body are affected. These procedures may include documentation of their histology, a physical examination, blood tests, chest [[X-ray]] radiographs, [[computed tomography]] (CT)/[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET)/[[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and usually a bone marrow biopsy. [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) scan is now used instead of the [[gallium scan]] for staging. In the past, a [[lymphangiogram]] or surgical [[laparotomy]] (which involves opening the abdominal cavity and visually inspecting for tumors) were performed. Lymphangiograms or laparotomies are very rarely performed, having been supplanted by improvements in imaging with the CT scan and PET scan.

On the basis of this staging, the patient will be classified according to a staging classification (the [[Ann Arbor staging classification]] scheme is a common one):
* Stage I is involvement of a single lymph node region (I) (mostly the cervical region) or single extralymphatic site (Ie);
* Stage II is involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] (II) or of one lymph node region and a contiguous extralymphatic site (IIe);
* Stage III is involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm, which may include the [[spleen]] (IIIs) and/or limited contiguous extralymphatic organ or site (IIIe, IIIes);
* Stage IV is disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs.

The absence of systemic symptoms is signified by adding 'A' to the stage; the presence of systemic symptoms is signified by adding 'B' to the stage. For localized extranodal extension from mass of nodes that does not advance the stage, subscript 'E' is added.  Splenic involvement is signified by adding 'S' to the stage.

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma may present with the following symptoms:
*[[Lymph nodes]]: the most common symptom of Hodgkin's is the painless enlargement of one or more lymph nodes, or [[lymphadenopathy]]. The nodes may also feel rubbery and swollen when examined. The nodes of the neck and shoulders ([[cervical lymph nodes|cervical]] and [[supraclavicular lymph nodes|supraclavicular]]) are most frequently involved (80–90% of the time, on average). The lymph nodes of the chest are often affected, and these may be noticed on a [[chest radiograph]].
*[[Pruritus|Itchy skin]]
*[[Sleep hyperhidrosis|Night sweats]]
*Unexplained [[weight loss]]
*[[Splenomegaly]]: enlargement of the [[spleen]] occurs in about 30% of people with Hodgkin's lymphoma. The enlargement, however, is seldom massive and the size of the spleen may fluctuate during the course of treatment.
*[[Hepatomegaly]]: enlargement of the [[liver]], due to liver involvement, is present in about 5% of cases.
*[[Hepatosplenomegaly]]: the enlargement of both the liver and spleen caused by the same disease.
*Pain following alcohol consumption: classically, involved nodes are painful after alcohol consumption, though this phenomenon is very uncommon,<ref>{{cite journal

*[[Back pain]]: nonspecific back pain (pain that cannot be localized or its cause determined by examination or scanning techniques) has been reported in some cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The lower back is most often affected.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
*Red-coloured patches on the skin, easy bleeding and [[petechiae]] due to low platelet count (as a result of bone marrow infiltration, increased trapping in the spleen etc.—i.e. decreased production, increased removal)
*Systemic symptoms: about one-third of patients with Hodgkin's disease may also present with systemic symptoms, including low-grade [[fever]]; [[night sweats]]; unexplained weight loss of at least 10% of the patient's total body mass in six months or less, itchy skin ([[itch|pruritus]]) due to increased levels of [[eosinophils]] in the bloodstream; or [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] (lassitude). Systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss are known as [[B symptoms]]; thus, presence of fever, weight loss, and night sweats indicate that the patient's stage is, for example, 2B instead of 2A.<ref>{{cite web

==Cause==
There are no guidelines for preventing Hodgkin's lymphoma; the cause is unknown or multifactorial. A [[risk factor]] is something that statistically increases one's chance of contracting a disease or condition. Risk factors for Hodgkin's lymphoma include:

* Sex: [[Man|male]]<ref name=mountsinai>[http://www.mountsinai.org/patient-care/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma-adult#risk] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]]</ref>
* Ages: 15–40 and over 55<ref name=mountsinai/>
* Family history<ref name=mountsinai/>
* History of [[infectious mononucleosis]] or infection with Epstein–Barr virus, a causative agent of mononucleosis<ref name=mountsinai/>
* Weakened immune system, including infection with [[HIV]] or the presence of [[AIDS]]<ref name=mountsinai/>
* Prolonged use of [[human growth hormone]]<ref name=mountsinai/>
* Exposure to exotoxins, such as [[Agent Orange]]

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
Hodgkin's lymphoma must be distinguished from non-cancerous causes of lymph node swelling (such as various infections) and from other types of cancer. Definitive diagnosis is by lymph node [[biopsy]] (usually excisional biopsy with microscopic examination). [[Blood test]]s are also performed to assess function of major organs and to assess safety for [[chemotherapy]]. [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) is used to detect small deposits that do not show on CT scanning. PET scans are also useful in functional imaging (by using a radiolabeled glucose to image tissues of high metabolism). In some cases a [[Gallium imaging|Gallium Scan]] may be used instead of a PET scan.

===Pathology===
;Macroscopy
Affected lymph nodes (most often, laterocervical lymph nodes) are enlarged, but their shape is preserved because the capsule is not invaded. Usually, the cut surface is white-grey and uniform; in some histological subtypes (e.g. [[nodular sclerosis]]) a nodular aspect may appear.

A [[fibrin ring granuloma]] may be seen.

;Microscopy
[[Image:Reed-Sternberg lymphocyte nci-vol-7172-300.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a classic Reed–Sternberg cell]]
[[Image:Popcorn cell in nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma - very high mag cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing a "popcorn cell", the Reed–Sternberg cell variant seen in [[nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma]]. [[H&E stain]]]]
Microscopic examination of the lymph node biopsy reveals complete or partial effacement of the lymph node architecture by scattered large malignant cells known as Reed–Sternberg cells (RSC) (typical and variants) admixed within a reactive cell infiltrate composed of variable proportions of lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells. The Reed–Sternberg cells are identified as large often bi-nucleated cells with prominent nucleoli and an unusual [[CD45]]-, [[CD30]]+, [[CD15]]+/- immunophenotype. In approximately 50% of cases, the Reed–Sternberg cells are infected by the Epstein–Barr virus.

Characteristics of classic Reed–Sternberg cells include large size (20–50 micrometres), abundant, amphophilic, finely granular/homogeneous cytoplasm; two mirror-image nuclei (owl eyes) each with an eosinophilic nucleolus and a thick nuclear membrane ([[chromatin]] is distributed close to the nuclear membrane).

Variants:
* [[Hodgkin cell]] (atypical mononuclear RSC) is a variant of RS cell, which has the same characteristics, but is mononucleated.
* Lacunar RSC is large, with a single hyperlobated nucleus, multiple, small nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm which is retracted around the nucleus, creating an empty space ("lacunae").
* Pleomorphic RSC has multiple irregular nuclei.
* "Popcorn" RSC (lympho-histiocytic variant) is a small cell, with a very lobulated nucleus, small nucleoli.
* "Mummy" RSC has a compact nucleus, no nucleolus and basophilic cytoplasm.

Hodgkin's lymphoma can be sub-classified by histological type. The cell histology in Hodgkin's lymphoma is not as important as it is in [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]: the treatment and prognosis in classic Hodgkin's lymphoma usually depends on the stage of disease rather than the [[histotype]].

==Management==
Patients with early stage disease (IA or IIA) are effectively treated with [[radiation therapy]] or chemotherapy. The choice of treatment depends on the age, sex, bulk and the histological subtype of the disease. Patients with later disease (III, IVA, or IVB) are treated with combination chemotherapy alone. Patients of any stage with a large mass in the chest are usually treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

| The original treatment for Hodgkin's was ''[[MOPP (medicine)]]''  The abbreviation stands for the four drugs [[Mustargen]], [[Oncovin]], also known as Vincristine, . [[Prednisone]] and [[Procarbazine]] also known as Matulane.  The treatment is usually administered in four week cycles, often for six cycles. MSD and VCR are administered intravenously, while procarbazine and prednisone are pills taken orally. MOPP was the first combination chemotherapy brought in that achieved a high success rate. It was developed at the National Cancer Institute in the 1960s by a team that included Vincent DeVita, Jr..
Although no longer the most effective combination, MOPP is still used after relapse or where the patient has certain allergies or lung or heart problems which prevents the use of another regimen.
| Currently, the ''[[ABVD]]'' [[chemotherapy regimen]] is the standard treatment of Hodgkin's disease in the US. The abbreviation stands for the four drugs [[Adriamycin]], [[bleomycin]], [[vinblastine]], and [[dacarbazine]]. Developed in Italy in the 1970s, the ABVD treatment typically takes between six and eight months, although longer treatments may be required.
| The newer [[Stanford V]] regimen is typically only half as long as the ABVD but involves a more intensive chemotherapy schedule and incorporates radiation therapy. In a randomized controlled study in Italy, Stanford V was inferior to ABVD <ref name="pmid16172458">{{cite journal |author=Gobbi PG |title=ABVD versus modified stanford V versus MOPPEBVCAD with optional and limited radiotherapy in intermediate- and advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma: final results of a multicenter randomized trial by the Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi |journal=J.

| [[BEACOPP]] is a form of treatment for stages > II mainly used in Europe. The cure rate with the BEACOPP esc. regimen is approximately 10–15% higher than with standard ABVD in advanced stages. This was shown in a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine (Diehl et al.), but US physicians still favor ABVD, maybe because some physicians think that BEACOPP induces more secondary leukemia. However, this seems negligible compared to the higher cure rates. BEACOPP is more expensive because of the requirement for concurrent treatment with [[GCSF]] to increase production of white blood cells. Currently, the German Hodgkin Study Group tests 8 cycles (8x) BEACOPP esc vs. 6x BEACOPP esc vs. 8x BEACOPP-14 baseline (HD15-trial).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghsg.org/en/ |title=Home &#124; German Hodgkin Study Group |publisher=Ghsg.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

It should be noted that the common non-Hodgkin's treatment, [[rituximab]] (which is a monoclonal antibody against CD20) is not routinely used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma due to the lack of CD20 surface antigens in most cases. The use of rituximab in Hodgkin's lymphoma, including the lymphocyte predominant subtype has been reviewed recently.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  Saini KS, Azim HA Jr, Cocorocchio E, Vanazzi A, Saini ML, Raviele PR, Pruneri G, Peccatori FA  | title = Rituximab in Hodgkin lymphoma: Is the target always a hit? | journal = Cancer Treat Rev | volume = 37 | pages = 385–90 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21183282 | doi =  10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.11.005 | issue =  5}}</ref>

Although increased age is an adverse risk factor for Hodgkin's lymphoma, in general elderly patients without major comorbidities are sufficiently fit to tolerate standard therapy, and have a treatment outcome comparable to that of younger patients. However, the disease is a different entity in older patients and different considerations enter into treatment decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klimm B, Diehl V, Engert A |title=Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the Elderly: A Different Disease in Patients Over 60 |journal=Oncology |volume=21 | year=2007 |url=http://www.cancernetwork.com/display/article/10165/59443 |issue=8 |pmid=17715698 |pages=982–90; discussion 990, 996, 998 passim}}</ref>

For Hodgkin's lymphomas, radiation oncologists typically use [[external beam radiation therapy]] (sometimes shortened to EBRT or XRT). Radiation oncologists deliver external beam radiation therapy to the lymphoma from a machine called a linear accelerator. Patients usually describe treatments as painless and similar to getting an X-ray. Treatments last less than 30 minutes each, every day but Saturday and Sunday.

For lymphomas, there are a few different ways radiation oncologists target the cancer cells. Involved field radiation is when the radiation oncologists give radiation only to those parts of the patient's body known to have the cancer. Very often, this is combined with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy directed above the diaphragm to the neck, chest and/or underarms is called mantle field radiation. Radiation to below the diaphragm to the abdomen, spleen and/or pelvis is called inverted-Y field radiation. Total nodal irradiation is when the therapist gives radiation to all the lymph nodes in the body to destroy cells that may have spread.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtanswers.com/treatmentinformation/cancertypes/lymphomas/externalbeam.aspx |title=RTanswers.com |publisher=RTanswers.com |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref>

===Adverse effects===
The high cure rates and long survival of many patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma has led to a high concern with late adverse effects of treatment, including cardiovascular disease and second malignancies such as acute [[leukemia]]s, lymphomas, and [[solid tumors]] within the radiation therapy field. Most patients with early-stage disease are now treated with abbreviated chemotherapy and involved-field radiation therapy rather than with radiation therapy alone. Clinical research strategies are exploring reduction of the duration of chemotherapy and dose and volume of radiation therapy in an attempt to reduce late morbidity and mortality of treatment while maintaining high cure rates. Hospitals are also treating those who respond quickly to chemotherapy with no radiation.

In childhood cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma, long-term endocrine adverse effects are a major concern, mainly [[gonadal dysfunction]] and [[growth retardation]]. Gonadal dysfunction seems to be the most severe endocrine long-term effect, especially after treatment with [[alkylating agent]]s and/or pelvic radiotherapy.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr038}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Treatment of Hodgkin's disease has been improving over the past few decades. Recent trials that have made use of new types of chemotherapy have indicated higher survival rates than have previously been seen. In one recent European trial, the 5-year survival rate for those patients with a favorable prognosis was 98%, while that for patients with worse outlooks was at least 85%.<ref name="Ferm">{{cite journal |author=Fermé C |title=Chemotherapy plus involved-field radiation in early-stage Hodgkin's disease |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |issue=19 |pages=1916–27 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17989384 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa064601 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=17989384&promo=ONFLNS19 |author-separator=, |author2=Eghbali H |author3=Meerwaldt JH |display-authors=3 |last4=Rieux |first4=Chantal |last5=Bosq |first5=Jacques |last6=Berger |first6=Françoise |last7=Girinsky |first7=Théodore |last8=Brice |first8=Pauline |last9=Van't Veer |first9=Mars B.}}</ref>

In 1998, an international effort<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hasenclever D, Diehl V | title=A Prognostic Score for Advanced Hodgkin's Disease | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | volume=339 | issue=21 | date=November 19, 1998 |pages=1506–14 |pmid=9819449 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199811193392104}}</ref> identified seven prognostic factors that accurately predict the success rate of conventional treatment in patients with locally extensive or advanced stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. Freedom from progression (FFP) at 5 years was directly related to the number of factors present in a patient. The 5-year FFP for patients with zero factors is 84%. Each additional factor lowers the 5-year FFP rate by 7%, such that the 5-year FFP for a patient with 5 or more factors is 42%.

The adverse prognostic factors identified in the international study are:
* Age ≥ 45 years
* Stage IV disease
* [[Hemoglobin]] < 10.5 g/dl
* [[Lymphocyte count]] < 600/µl or < 8%
* [[Male]]
* [[Albumin]] < 4.0 g/dl
* [[white blood cell count|White blood count]] ≥ 15,000/µl

Other studies have reported the following to be the most important adverse prognostic factors: mixed-cellularity or lymphocyte-depleted histologies, male sex, large number of involved nodal sites, advanced stage, age of 40 years or more, the presence of B symptoms, high [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], and bulky disease (widening of the [[mediastinum]] by more than one third, or the presence of a nodal mass measuring more than 10&nbsp;cm in any dimension.)

Unlike some [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma|other lymphomas]], whose [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] increases with age, Hodgkin's lymphoma has a [[Bimodal distribution|bimodal]] incidence curve; that is, it occurs most frequently in two separate age groups, the first being young adulthood (age 15–35) and the second being in those over 55 years old although these peaks may vary slightly with nationality.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mauch | first=Peter | coauthors=James Armitage, Volker Diehl, Richard Hoppe, Laurence Weiss | title=Hodgkin's Disease | publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] | year=1999 | pages=62–64 | isbn=0-7817-1502-4}}</ref> Overall, it is more common in males, except for the [[nodular sclerosis]] variant, which is slightly more common in females. The annual incidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma is about 1 in 25,000 people, and the disease accounts for slightly less than 1% of all cancers worldwide.

The incidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma is increased in patients with [[HIV]] infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Biggar RJ, Jaffe ES, Goedert JJ, Chaturvedi A, Pfeiffer R, Engels EA |title=Hodgkin lymphoma and immunodeficiency in persons with HIV/AIDS |journal=Blood |volume=108 |issue=12 |pages=3786–91 |year=2006 |pmid=16917006 |doi=10.1182/blood-2006-05-024109 |pmc=1895473}}</ref> In contrast to many other lymphomas associated with HIV infection it occurs most commonly in patients with higher [[CD4]] T cell counts.

==History==
[[File:Hodgkin's Disease (Essentials of Medicine).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Photograph from a 1938 medical textbook labeled "Hodgkin's Disease", (''Essentials of medicine'')]]

Hodgkin's lymphoma was first described in an 1832 report by [[Thomas Hodgkin]], although Hodgkin noted that perhaps the earliest reference to the condition was provided by [[Marcello Malpighi]] in 1666.<ref name="Hoppe2007"/><ref name="Hodgkin1832"/> While occupied as museum curator at [[Guy's Hospital]], Hodgkin studied seven patients with painless lymph node enlargement. Of the seven cases, two were patients of [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]], one was of [[Thomas Addison]], and one was of Robert Carswell.<ref name="Hoppe2007"/> Carswell's report of this seventh patient was accompanied by numerous illustrations that aided early descriptions of the disease.<ref name="pmid10594291">{{cite journal |author=Dawson PJ |title=The original illustrations of Hodgkin's disease |journal=Annals of Diagnostic Pathology |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=386–93 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10594291 |doi=10.1053/ADPA00300386 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/00300386 |doi_brokendate=2010-01-09}}</ref>

Hodgkin's report on these seven patients, entitled "On some morbid appearances of the absorbent glands and spleen", was presented to the [[Medical and Chirurgical Society]] in London in January 1832 and was subsequently published in the society's journal, ''Medical-Chirurgical Society Transactions''.<ref name="Hoppe2007"/> Hodgkin's paper went largely unnoticed, however, even despite Bright highlighting it in an 1838 publication.<ref name="Hoppe2007"/> Indeed, Hodgkin himself did not view his contribution as particularly significant.<ref name="Geller1984">{{cite journal |author=Geller SA |title=Comments on the anniversary of the description of Hodgkin's disease |journal=Journal of the National Medical Association |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=815–7 |year=1984 |month=August |pmid=6381744 |pmc=2609834 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

In 1856, [[Samuel Wilks]] independently reported on a series of patients with the same disease that Hodgkin had previously described.<ref name="Geller1984"/> Wilks, a successor to Hodgkin at Guy's Hospital, was unaware of Hodgkin's prior work on the subject. Bright made Wilks aware of Hodgkin's contribution and in 1865, Wilks published a second paper, entitled "Cases of enlargement of the lymphatic glands and spleen", in which he called the disease "Hodgkin's disease" in honor of his predecessor.<ref name="Geller1984"/>

[[Theodor Langhans]] and WS Greenfield first described the microscopic characteristics of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1872 and 1878, respectively.<ref name="Hoppe2007"/> In 1898 and 1902, respectively, [[Carl Sternberg]] and [[Dorothy Mabel Reed Mendenhall|Dorothy Reed]] independently described the cytogenetic features of the malignant cells of Hodgkin's lymphoma, now called Reed–Sternberg cells.<ref name="Hoppe2007"/>

Tissue specimens from Hodgkin's seven patients remained at Guy's Hospital for a number of years. Nearly 100 years after Hodgkin's initial publication, [[histopathology|histopathologic]] reexamination confirmed Hodgkin's lymphoma in only three of seven of these patients.<ref name="Geller1984"/> The remaining cases included [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[syphilis]].<ref name="Geller1984"/>

Hodgkin's lymphoma was one of the first cancers which could be treated using [[radiation therapy]] and, later, it was one of the first to be treated by [[combination chemotherapy]].
