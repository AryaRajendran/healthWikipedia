'''Phage therapy''' is the [[therapeutic]] use of [[bacteriophage]]s to treat [[pathogenic]] [[bacterial]] [[bacterial infection|infections]].<ref>''[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/48hours/main522596.shtml Silent Killers: Fantastic Phages?]'', by David Kohn, ''CBS News: 48 Hours Mystery''.</ref> Although extensively used and developed mainly in former [[Soviet Union]] countries circa 1920, the treatment is not approved in countries other than [[Russia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Phage therapy has many potential applications in [[human]] [[medicine]] as well as [[dentistry]], [[veterinary science]], and [[agriculture]].<ref>McAuliffe et al.

Bacteriophages are much more specific than [[antibiotics]], so they can hypothetically be chosen to be indirectly harmless not only to the host [[organism]] (human, animal, or [[plant]]), but also to other [[normal flora|beneficial bacteria]], such as [[gut flora]], reducing the chances of [[opportunistic infection]]s.<ref>{{cite doi|10.3389/fmicb.2012.00238}}</ref> They would have a high [[therapeutic index]], that is, phage therapy would be expected to give rise to few  [[adverse effect|side effect]]s. Because phages replicate ''[[in vivo]]'', a smaller effective dose can be used. On the other hand, this specificity is also a disadvantage: a phage will only kill a bacterium if it is a match to the specific [[strain (biology)|strain]]. Consequently phage mixtures are often applied to improve the chances of success, or samples can be taken and an appropriate phage identified and grown.

Phages are currently being used therapeutically to treat bacterial infections that do not respond to conventional antibiotics, particularly in the [[Russian Federation]] <ref name="Eaters of bacteria: Is phage therapy ready for the big time?">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2011/05/20/eaters-of-bacteria-is-phage-therapy-ready-for-the-big-time/#.UWhfQ3D0jPs|title=Eaters of bacteria: Is phage therapy ready for the big time?|publisher=Discover Magazine|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> and Republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref name="horizon">BBC Horizon: Phage - The Virus that Cures 1997-10-09</ref><ref name="pmid15986542">{{cite journal |author=Parfitt T |title=Georgia: an unlikely stronghold for bacteriophage therapy |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9478 |pages=2166–7 |year=2005 |pmid=15986542|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66759-1}}</ref><ref name=Thiel>{{cite journal

Following the discovery of bacteriophages by [[Frederick Twort]] and [[Felix d'Hérelle]]<ref name="pmid15143702">{{cite journal |author=Shasha SM, Sharon N, Inbar M |title=[Bacteriophages as antibacterial agents] |language=Hebrew |journal=Harefuah |volume=143 |issue=2 |pages=121–5, 166 |year=2004 |pmid=15143702 |doi=}}</ref> in 1915 and 1917, phage therapy was immediately recognized by many to be a key way forward for the eradication of bacterial infections. A Georgian, [[George Eliava]], was making similar discoveries. He travelled to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris where he met d'Hérelle, and in 1923 he founded the [[Eliava Institute]] in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], devoted to the development of phage therapy.

In neighbouring countries including Russia, extensive research and development soon began in this field. In the United States during the 1940s commercialization of phage therapy was undertaken by the large pharmaceutical company, [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]].

While knowledge was being accumulated regarding the biology of phages and how to use phage cocktails correctly, early uses of phage therapy were often unreliable. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Kutter|first=E|coauthors=De Vos, D, Gvasalia, G, Alavidze, Z, Gogokhia, L, Kuhl, S, Abedon, ST|title=Phage therapy in clinical practice: treatment of human infections|journal=Current pharmaceutical biotechnology|date=2010 Jan|volume=11|issue=1|pages=69–86|pmid=20214609|doi=10.2174/138920110790725401}}</ref> When [[antibiotics]] were discovered in 1941 and marketed widely in the U.S. and Europe, Western scientists mostly lost interest in further use and study of phage therapy for some time.<ref name="pmid17566713">{{cite journal |author=Hanlon GW |title=Bacteriophages: an appraisal of their role in the treatment of bacterial infections |journal=Int.

Isolated from Western advances in antibiotic production in the 1940s, Russian scientists continued to develop already successful phage therapy to treat the wounds of soldiers in [[field hospital]]s. During [[World War II]], the Soviet Union used bacteriophages to treat many soldiers infected with various bacterial diseases e.g. dysentery and gangrene. Russian researchers continued to develop and to refine their treatments and to publish their research and results. However, due to the scientific barriers of the [[Cold War]], this knowledge was not translated and did not proliferate across the world.<ref>"Stalin's Forgotten Cure"  ''[[Science (magazine)]]'' 25 October 2002 v.298  [www.sciencemag.org][http://www.phage-biotech.com/images/Science-phagetherapy.pdf reprint]</ref><ref name="pmid11544363">{{cite journal |author=Summers WC |title=Bacteriophage therapy |journal=Annu.

As a result of the development of [[antibiotic resistance]] since the 1950s and an advancement of scientific knowledge, there has been renewed interest worldwide in the ability of phage therapy to eradicate bacterial infections and chronic polymicrobial [[biofilm]] (including in industrial situations<ref name="kera">{{cite web|date=2011-06-16|accessdate=2012-06-04|title=KERA Think!

The oldest use was, however, in human medicine. Phages have been used against diarrheal diseases caused by ''[[E. coli]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'' or ''[[Vibrio]]'' and against wound infections caused by facultative pathogens of the skin like [[staphylococci]] and [[streptococci]]. Recently the phage therapy approach has been applied to systemic and even intracellular infections and the addition of non-replicating phage and isolated phage enzymes like [[lysins]] to the antimicrobial arsenal. However, actual proof for the [[efficacy]] of these phage approaches in the field or the hospital is not available.<ref name="McGrath"/>

Some of the interest in the West can be traced back to 1994, when Soothill demonstrated (in an animal model) that the use of phages could improve the success of skin grafts by reducing the underlying ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' infection.<ref name="pmid8054131">{{cite journal |author=Soothill JS |title=Bacteriophage prevents destruction of skin grafts by Pseudomonas aeruginosa |journal=Burns |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=209–11 |year=1994 |pmid=8054131|doi=10.1016/0305-4179(94)90184-8}}</ref> Recent studies have provided additional support for these findings in the model system.<ref name="pmid17387151">{{cite journal |author=McVay CS, Velásquez M, Fralick JA |title=Phage therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in a mouse burn wound model |journal=Antimicrob.

==Potential benefits ==

Bacteriophage treatment offers a possible alternative to conventional [[antibiotic]] treatments for bacterial infection.<ref name="pmid19649921">{{cite journal |author=Górski A, Miedzybrodzki R, Borysowski J, Weber-Dabrowska B, Lobocka M, Fortuna W, Letkiewicz S, Zimecki M, Filby G |title=Bacteriophage therapy for the treatment of infections |journal=Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs (London, England : 2000) |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=766–74 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19649921 |doi= |url=}}</ref> It is conceivable that, although [[bacteria]] can develop resistance to phage, the resistance might be easier to overcome than resistance to antibiotics.<ref>http://www.phagetherapycenter.com/pii/PatientServlet?command=static_phagetherapy&language=0</ref>  Just as bacteria can evolve resistance, viruses can evolve to overcome resistance; however, the ability to evolve raises serious safety questions.<ref name="kera" />

Bacteriophages are very specific, targeting only one or a few strains of bacteria.<ref name="pmid11909002">{{cite journal |author=Duckworth DH, Gulig PA |title=Bacteriophages: potential treatment for bacterial infections |journal=BioDrugs |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=57–62 |year=2002 |pmid=11909002 |doi=}}</ref> Traditional antibiotics have more wide-ranging effect, killing both harmful bacteria and useful bacteria such as those facilitating food digestion. The specificity of bacteriophages might reduce the chance that useful bacteria are killed when fighting an infection.

Some evidence shows the ability of phages to travel to a required site—including the brain, where the [[blood brain barrier]] can be crossed—and multiply in the presence of an appropriate bacterial host, to combat infections such as [[meningitis]]. However the patient's immune system can, in some cases, mount an immune response to the phage (2 out of 44 patients in a Polish trial<ref>"Non-antibiotic therapies for infectious diseases." by Christine F Carson, and Thomas V Riley ''Communicable Diseases Intelligence'' Volume 27 Supplement - May 2003

==Application==
===Collection===

The simplest method of phage treatment involves collecting local samples of water likely to contain high quantities of bacteria and bacteriophages, for example [[effluent]] outlets, [[sewage]] and other sources.<ref name="horizon"/> They can also be extracted from corpses. The samples are taken and applied to the bacteria that are to be destroyed which have been cultured on growth medium.

If the bacteria die, as usually happens, the mixture is centrifuged; the phages collect on the top of the mixture and can be drawn off.

The phage solutions are then tested to see which ones show growth suppression effects (lysogeny) or destruction (lysis) of the target bacteria. The phage showing lysis are then amplified on cultures of the target bacteria, passed through a filter to remove all but the phages, then distributed.

===Treatment===

Phages are "bacterium-specific" and it is therefore necessary in many cases to take a swab from the patient and culture it prior to treatment. Occasionally, isolation of therapeutic phages can require a few months to complete, but clinics generally keep supplies of phage cocktails for the most common bacterial strains in a geographical area.

Phages in practice are applied orally, topically on infected wounds or spread onto surfaces, or used during surgical procedures. Injection is rarely used, avoiding any risks of trace chemical contaminants that may be present from the bacteria amplification stage, and recognizing that the immune system naturally fights against viruses introduced into the bloodstream or lymphatic system.

The direct human use of phages is likely to be very safe; suggestively, in August 2006, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved spraying meat with phages. The approval was for ListShield (a phage preparation targeted against ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'')  created by [[Intralytix]]. This was the first approval granted by the FDA and UDSA for a phage-based food additive. Although this initially raised concerns since without [[mandatory labeling]] consumers will not be aware that meat and poultry products have been treated with the spray,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110614007247/en/Intralytix-Completes-Regulatory-Clearance-Phage-Based-E.-coli }}</ref> it confirms to the public that, for example, phages against ''[[Listeria]]'' are [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS status) within the worldwide scientific community and opens the way for other phages to also be recognized as having GRAS status{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}.

Phage therapy has been attempted for the treatment of a variety of bacterial infections including: [[laryngitis]], skin infections, [[dysentery]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[periodontitis]], [[gingivitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[urinary tract infection]]s and intestinal infections, burns, boils,<ref name="horizon"/> poly-microbial biofilms on chronic wounds, ulcers and infected surgical sites. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} <!--either a review covering them all, or a source for each specific disease.

===Administration===

Phages can usually be freeze-dried and turned into pills without materially impacting efficiency.<ref name="horizon"/> Temperature stability up to 55 °C and shelf lives of 14 months have been shown for some types of phages in pill form.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Application in liquid form is possible, stored preferably in refrigerated vials.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Oral administration works better when an antacid is included, as this increases the number of phages surviving passage through the stomach.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Topical administration often involves application to gauzes that are laid on the area to be treated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Obstacles==
===General===

The high bacterial strain specificity of phage therapy may make it necessary for clinics to make different cocktails for treatment of the same infection or disease because the bacterial components of such diseases may differ from region to region or even person to person.

In addition, due to the specificity of individual phages, for a high chance of success, a mixture of phages is often applied. This means that 'banks' containing many different phages must be kept and regularly updated with new phages.<ref name="phage">{{cite doi|10.3389/fmicb.2012.00238|noedit}}</ref>

Further, bacteria can evolve different receptors either before or during treatment; this can prevent the phages from completely eradicating the bacteria.

The need for banks of phages makes regulatory testing for safety harder and more expensive. Such a process would make it difficult for large-scale production of phage therapy. Additionally, [[patent]] issues (specifically on living organisms) may complicate distribution for pharmaceutical companies wishing to have exclusive rights over their "invention", making it unlikely that a for-profit [[corporation]] will invest capital in the widespread application of this technology.

As has been known for at least thirty years, [[mycobacterium|mycobacteria]] such as ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' have specific bacteriophages.<ref>Graham F. HATFULL 12 - Mycobacteriophages : ''Pathogenesis and Applications'', pages 238-255 (in Waldor, M.K., D.I. Friedman, and S.L. Adhya, ''Phages: Their role in bacterial pathogenesis and biotechnology'', '''2005''', University of Michigan; Sankar L. Adhya, National Institutes of Health: ASM Press).</ref> No lytic phage has yet been discovered for ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'', which is responsible for many [[nosocomial infection|nosocomial diseases]],  but some ''temperate'' phages (integrated in the genome) are known for this species, which opens encouraging avenues.

To work, the virus has to reach the site of the bacteria, and viruses do not necessarily reach the same places that antibiotics can reach.

Funding for phage therapy research and clinical trials is generally insufficient and difficult to obtain, since it is a lengthy and complex process to patent bacteriophage products. Scientists comment that 'the biggest hurdle is regulatory', whereas an official view is that individual phages would need proof individually because it would be too complicated to do as a combination, with many variables. Due to the specificity of phages, phage therapy would be most effective with a cocktail injection, which is generally rejected by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Researchers and observers predict that for phage therapy to be successful the FDA must change its regulatory stance on combination drug cocktails.<ref name="phage" /> Public awareness and education about phage therapy are generally limited to scientific or independent research rather than mainstream media.<ref>Brüssow, H 2007. ''Phage Therapy: The Western Perspective''. in S. McGrath and D. van Sinderen (eds.) ''Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology'', Caister Academic Press, Norfolk, UK. ISBN 978-1-904455-14-1</ref>

The negative public perception of viruses may also play a role in the reluctance to embrace phage therapy.<ref name="pmid17927471">{{cite journal |author=Verbeken G, De Vos D, Vaneechoutte M, Merabishvili M, Zizi M, Pirnay JP |title=European regulatory conundrum of phage therapy |journal=Future Microbiol |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=485–91 |year=2007 |pmid=17927471 |doi=10.2217/17460913.2.5.485 |url=http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/17460913.2.5.485}}</ref>

===Safety===

Approval of phage therapy for use in humans has not been given in Western countries.  Much of the problem is how to prove safety when using a self-replicating entity which has the capability to evolve.<ref name="kera" />

As with antibiotic therapy and other methods of countering bacterial infections, [[endotoxin]]s are released by the bacteria as they are destroyed within the patient ([[Herxheimer reaction]]). This can cause symptoms of fever, or in extreme cases [[toxic shock]] (a problem also seen with antibiotics) is possible.<ref>[http://www.evergreen.edu/phage/phagetherapy/phagetherapy.htm Evergreen PHAGE THERAPY: BACTERIOPHAGES AS ANTIBIOTICS]</ref> Janakiraman Ramachandran<ref>[http://www.phageinternational.com/phagetherapy/stalins_print.htm Stone, Richard. "Stalin's Forgotten Cure." Science Online 282 (25 October 2002).]</ref> argues that this complication can be avoided in those types of infection where this reaction is likely to occur by using [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] bacteriophages which have had their gene responsible for producing endolysin removed. Without this gene the host bacterium still dies but remains intact because the lysis is disabled. On the other hand this modification stops the exponential growth of phages, so one administered phage means one dead bacterial cell.<ref name="Thiel"/>
Eventually these dead cells are consumed by the normal house-cleaning duties of the [[Phagocytosis|phagocytes]], which utilise enzymes to break the whole bacterium and its contents down into harmless proteins, polysaccharides and lipids.<ref>{{cite book

[[Lysogeny|Lysogenic]] bacteriophages are not generally used therapeutically, as this group can act as a way for bacteria to exchange DNA; this can help spread antibiotic resistance or even, theoretically, make the bacteria pathogenic (see [[Cholera]]).

==Effectiveness==
In Russia, mixed phage preparations may have a therapeutic efficacy of 50%. This equates to the complete cure of 50 of 100 patients with terminal antibiotic-resistant infection. The rate of only 50% is likely to be due to individual choices in admixtures and ineffective diagnosis of the causative agent of infection.<ref>http://files.school-collection.edu.ru/dlrstore/378ba3de-4e8f-dadd-e84f-4cf4f0b632f1/11-15_03_2002.pdf</ref>
