'''Duct tape occlusion therapy''' (DTOT): is a method for attempting to treat [[warts]] by keeping them covered with [[duct tape]] for an extended period. The evidence as to whether or not it is effective is poor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wenner|first=R|coauthors=Askari, SK, Cham, PM, Kedrowski, DA, Liu, A, Warshaw, EM|title=Duct tape for the treatment of common warts in adults: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.|journal=Archives of dermatology|date=2007 Mar|volume=143|issue=3|pages=309–13|pmid=17372095|doi=10.1001/archderm.143.3.309}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ringold|first=S|coauthors=Mendoza, JA, Tarini, BA, Sox, C|title=Is duct tape occlusion therapy as effective as cryotherapy for the treatment of the common wart?|journal=Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine|date=2002 Oct|volume=156|issue=10|pages=975–7|pmid=12361441}}</ref> Thus it is not recommended as routine treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stubbings|first=A|coauthors=Wacogne, I|title=Question 3.

== Effectiveness ==
Duct tape occlusion therapy is not yet proven to be effective, with some studies showing some effectiveness, and others finding no significant efficacy. One study by ''Focht et al.'' found that the duct tape method was 85% effective, compared to a 60% success rate in the study's [[cryotherapy]] group.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Focht DR, Spicer C, Fairchok MP |title=The efficacy of duct tape vs cryotherapy in the treatment of verruca vulgaris (the common wart) |journal=Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine |volume=156 |issue=10 |pages=971–4 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12361440 |url=http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=203979}}<br/>reviewed in {{cite journal |author=Miller KE |title=Duct tape more effective than cryotherapy for warts |journal=American Family Physician |volume=67 |issue=3 |month=February |year=2003 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030201/tips/8.html }} {{dead link|date=May 2010}}<br/>& {{cite journal |author=DeMichele J |title=A new medical breakthrough: wart to do when verruca vulgaris attacks |journal=Journal of Young Investigators |volume=7 |issue=5 |year=2003 |url=http://www.jyi.org/volumes/volume7/issue5/features/demichele.html}}</ref>

Another study led by Rachel Wenner, however, found no statistically significant effect after 2 months in a double-blind, randomized and controlled clinical trial in 90 adults when transparent duct tape was compared to [[moleskin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wenner R, Askari SK, Cham PM, Kedrowski DA, Liu A, Warshaw EM |title=Duct tape for the treatment of common warts in adults: a double-blind randomized controlled trial |journal=Archives of Dermatology |volume=143 |issue=3 |pages=309–13 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17372095 |doi=10.1001/archderm.143.3.309 }}</ref> There was no statistically significant difference for resolution of the target wart between patients treated with moleskin versus patients treated with duct tape. Eight of 39 patients (21%) in the treatment group vs 9 of 41 patients in the control group [22%] had complete resolution of the target wart. Fewer of the patients achieving resolution of their wart in the moleskin group had recurrence of their wart. But it is not clear if the transparency of the duct tape affected efficacy.

Of the patients who had complete resolution, 6 (75%) in the treatment group and 3 (33%) in the control group had recurrence of the target wart by the sixth month.  "Whether or not the standard type of duct tape is effective is up in the air," said co-author Dr. Rachel Wenner of the University of Minnesota, who started the new study as a medical student. "Theoretically, the rubber adhesive could somehow stimulate the immune system or irritate the skin in a different manner."<ref>[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/20/161113.shtml "Study Casts Doubt on Duct Tape Wart Cure"]. ''Newsmax'', 21 March 2007.</ref> Since Wenner's study protocol covered the adhesive with waxed paper, the treatment did not achieve the combination of airtight occlusion and a reaction to the adhesive suggested by Litt in his paper as the mechanism of action.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Litt JZ |title=Don't excise--exorcise.

A second trial found duct tape had a modest but nonsignificant effect on wart resolution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Haen M, Spigt MG, van Uden CJ, van Neer P, Feron FJ, Knottnerus A |title=Efficacy of duct tape vs placebo in the treatment of verruca vulgaris (warts) in primary school children |journal=Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine |volume=160 |issue=11 |pages=1121–5 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17088514 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.160.11.1121 | url= http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/160/11/1121}}</ref> The [[statistical power]] of the latter trial has been questioned.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Cleave J, Kemper AR, Davis MM |title=Interpreting negative results from an underpowered clinical trial: warts and all |journal=Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine |volume=160 |issue=11 |pages=1126–9 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17088515 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.160.11.1126 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/160/11/1126}}</ref>

One [[randomized controlled trial]] found that more people having occlusive treatment with duct tape than cryotherapy had complete clearance of warts at two months. The randomized controlled trial did not assess recurrence.<ref>[http://www.clinicalevidence.com/ceweb/conditions/skd/1710/1710_I16.jsp Duct tape occlusion in treatment of warts] {{subscription}}, ''[[Clinical Evidence]]'', British Medical Journal.</ref>
