The '''''Physicians' Desk Reference''''' ('''''PDR''''') is a commercially published compilation of manufacturers' prescribing information ([[package insert]]) on [[prescription drug]]s, updated annually. While designed to provide [[physician]]s with the full legally mandated information relevant to writing prescriptions (just as its name suggests), it is widely available in [[Library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s, widely used by other medical specialists, and sometimes valuable to the [[layman]]. The compilation is financially supported in part by pharmaceutical manufacturing corporations which create drugs listed within its pages.

Since the late 20th century, a consumer edition has been offered at a much reduced price. Electronic editions are available on [[CD-ROM]] and the [[World Wide Web]] to subscribers. In 1984, Paul C. Kranz and Michael Grondin travelled to Oradell, New Jersey, and presented to Medical Economics (then-publisher of the ''PDR'') a prototype developed by Grondin on a [[TI 99/4A]] computer of how a digital copy of the PDR would work and benefit clinicians. The idea originally conceived by Kranz was well received by the president and vice-president of IT and an agreement was struck to investigate. The result was the ''PDR'' on CD-ROM.

The main edition is usable by determined laypeople in conjunction with a [[medical dictionary]].

==Controversies with the ''PDR''==
Originally distributed as a promotional item, the ''PDR'' has come under recent scrutiny with the lack of reporting of updated and accurate drug dosages along with [[Adverse drug reaction|adverse drug effects]].  Often dosage information can be taken from phase 1 trial information where clinical drug information is incomplete, resulting in higher ''PDR''-recommended dosages than therapeutically effective dosages for many medications.  And since most of the information is taken from drug data sheets generated by drug manufacturers, it is more likely to not include drug studies reporting the worst side-effect and adverse effect data.<ref name=discrepancies>Cohen JS. Dose Discrepancies Between the Physicians’ Desk Reference and the Medical Literature, and Their Possible Role in the High Incidence of Dose-Related Adverse Drug Events. Arch Intern Med. 2001;161:957–964</ref>  This is opposed to evidence-based medicine or clinical reviewed material which examines all such data but is not contained within the ''PDR''.

The ''PDR'' has also been criticized for its being paid for by the various pharmaceutical manufacturers that present medications within its pages.  This criticism stems from the lack of special interest disclosure and the potential for guiding medical recommendations apart from evidence-based medicine<ref>Cohen JS, Insel PA. The Physicians' Desk Reference. Problems and possible improvements. Arch Intern Med. 1996 Jul 8;156(13):1375-80.</ref>  The lack of medical editorial capacity within the PDR which is standard in the review of all scientific literature by informed scientific peers has also been criticized.<ref>Mindel JS, Teich SA, Teich CM, Beam P. Editorial: Limitations of the Physicians' Desk Reference 2007 Surv of Ophth 2008;53:82–84</ref>

While proponents may argue that the controversies with the ''PDR'' may seem insignificant, critics allege that in fact, most physicians and pharmacists rely on it in a bound, online or ''PDA'' version for drug dosaging and the lack of transparency in its formation most certainly leads to adverse patient outcomes.<ref name=discrepancies/>
