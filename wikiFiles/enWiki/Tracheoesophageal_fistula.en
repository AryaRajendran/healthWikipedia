A '''tracheoesophageal fistula''' ('''TEF''', or '''TOF'''; see [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|spelling differences]]) is an abnormal connection ([[fistula]]) between the [[esophagus]] and the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]].  TEF is a common [[congenital]] abnormality, but when occurring late in life is usually the sequela of surgical procedures such as a [[laryngectomy]].

==Causes==
Congenital TEF can arise due to failed fusion of the [[tracheoesophageal ridges]] during the third week of embryological development.<ref name="pmid10068713">{{cite journal |author=Clark DC |title=Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula |journal=American Family Physician |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=910–6, 919–20 |year=1999 |month=February |pmid=10068713 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990215ap/910.html}}</ref>

A fistula, from the Latin meaning ‘a pipe,’ is an abnormal connection running either between two tubes or between a tube and a surface. In tracheo-esophageal fistula it runs between the trachea and the esophagus. This connection may or may not have a central cavity; if it does, then food within the esophagus may pass into the trachea (and on to the lungs) or alternatively, air in the trachea may cross into the esophagus.

TEF can also occur due to pressure [[necrosis]] by a [[tracheostomy tube]] in apposition to a [[nasogastric tube]] (NGT).<ref>Dr. Lorne H. Blackbourne, ''Advanced Surgical Recall, 3rd Ed.'', pg. 206.</ref>

==Associations==

Babies with TEF or esophageal atresia are unable to feed properly. Once diagnosed, prompt surgery is required to allow the baby to take in food. Few children with TEF have problems after surgery; however, a number develop feeding difficulties and chest problems. Some babies with TEF are also born with other abnormalities, most commonly those described in [[VACTERL]] association - a group of anomalies which often occur together, including heart, kidney and limb deformities. 6% of babies with TEF also have a [[laryngeal cleft]].<ref>{{Cite book

==Classification==
Fistulae between the trachea and esophagus in the newborn can be of diverse morphology and anatomical location;<ref name="pmid17498283">{{cite journal |author=Spitz L |title=Oesophageal atresia |journal=Orphanet journal of rare diseases |volume=2 |issue= 1|pages=24 |year=2007 |pmid=17498283 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-24 |pmc=1884133}}</ref><ref name="pmid15364774">{{cite journal |author=Kovesi T, Rubin S |title=Long-term complications of congenital esophageal atresia and/or tracheoesophageal fistula |journal=Chest |volume=126 |issue=3 |pages=915–25 |year=2004 |pmid=15364774 |doi=10.1378/chest.126.3.915}}</ref> however, various pediatric surgical publications have attempted a classification system based on the below specified types. 

Not all types include both esophageal agenesis and tracheoesophageal fistula, but the most common types do.

The letter codes are usually associated with the system used by Gross,<ref>Gross, RE. The surgery of infancy and childhood. Philadelphia, WB Saunders; 1953.</ref> while number codes are usually associated with Vogt.<ref>Vogt EC. Congenital esophageal atresia. Am J of Roentgenol. 1929;22:463–465.</ref>

An additional type, "blind upper segment only" has been described,<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=800}}</ref> but this type is not usually included in most classifications.

(For the purposes of this discussion, ''proximal esophagus'' indicates normal esophageal tissue arising normally from the pharynx, and ''distal esophagus'' indicates normal esophageal tissue emptying into the proximal stomach.)

==Clinical presentation==
Tracheoesophageal fistula is suggested in a newborn by copious [[salivation]] associated with [[choking]], [[coughing]], vomiting, and [[cyanosis]] coincident with the onset of feeding. Esophageal atresia and the subsequent inability to swallow typically cause [[polyhydramnios]] in utero. Rarely it may present in an adult.<ref>D. Newberry, V. Sharma, D. Reiff, and F. De Lorenzo. A "little cough" for 40 years. Lancet, 354(9185):1174, Oct 1999.PMID:10513712</ref>

==Treatment==
It is surgically corrected, with [[Segmental resection|resection]] of any fistula and [[anastomosis]] of any discontinuous segments.  Surgical repair is associated with complications, including
*[[stenosis|Stricture]], due to gastric acid erosion of the shortened esophagus.
*Leak of contents at the point of anastomosis.
*Recurrence of fistula.
