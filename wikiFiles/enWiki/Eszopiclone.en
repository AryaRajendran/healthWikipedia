'''Eszopiclone''', marketed by [[Sepracor]] under the brand-name '''Lunesta''', is a [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] which is slightly effective for [[insomnia]]. Eszopiclone is the active [[dextrorotatory]] [[stereoisomer]] of [[zopiclone]], and belongs to the class of drugs known as [[cyclopyrrolones]].

Eszopiclone is a short acting [[nonbenzodiazepine]] sedative hypnotic. According to its manufacturer, it has been shown to be safe and effective for the short term treatment of primary insomnia in the elderly and safe in younger adults for 6&ndash;12 months. All clinical trials of eszopiclone published so far have been funded by the manufacturer of eszopiclone, [[Sepracor]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Clin Interv Aging | year = 2007 | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–26 | title = Eszopiclone for late-life insomnia | author = McCrae CS | coauthors = Ross A, Stripling A, Dautovich ND  | pmid = 18044182 | pmc = 2685268}}</ref>  There were 43 million prescriptions issued for insomnia medications during 2005 in the USA which generated a total of $2.7 billion for pharmaceutical companies.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = J Mass Dent Soc | year = 2007 | volume = 56 | issue = 53 | pages = 44–5 | title = What every dentist should know about the "z-sedatives" | author =McKenzie WS | coauthors = Rosenberg M  | pmid = 18069595}}</ref> Eszopiclone (Lunesta) along with other "[[Z-drug]]s" including [[zolpidem]] (Ambien), [[zaleplon]] (Sonata) are the most commonly prescribed sedative hypnotics in the USA.

Eszopiclone is not marketed in the [[European Union]] following a 2009 decision by the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] denying it ''new active substance'' status,<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2009/11/news_detail_000083.jsp&jsenabled=true Sepracor Pharmaceuticals Ltd withdraws its marketing authorisation application for Lunivia (eszopiclone)] - EMA, 15 may 2009</ref> in which it ruled that eszopiclone was too similar to [[zopiclone]] to be considered a new patentable product.<ref name=CBS>[http://www.bnet.com/blog/drug-business/end-of-sepracor-gsk-deal-raises-question-in-lunesta-patent-fight/1868 End of Sepracor-GSK Deal Raises Question in Lunesta Patent Fight] - CBS/BNet, 13 Jun 2009</ref>

==Medical uses==
Eszopiclone is slightly effective in the treatment of insomnia where difficulty in falling asleep is the primary complaint.<ref name=TB2012>{{cite journal|last=Huedo-Medina|first=TB|coauthors=Kirsch, I; Middlemass, J; Klonizakis, M; Siriwardena, AN|title=Effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in treatment of adult insomnia: meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=2012 Dec 17|volume=345|pages=e8343|pmid=23248080}}</ref> The benefit over placebo is of questionable clinical significance.<ref name=TB2012/> It is not recommended for chronic use in the elderly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert|first=Panel|title=American Geriatrics Society updated Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults.|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=2012 Apr|volume=60|issue=4|pages=616-31|pmid=22376048}}</ref>

===Elderly===
Sedative hypnotic drugs including eszopiclone are more commonly prescribed to the elderly than to younger patients despite benefits of medication being generally unimpressive. Care should be taken in choosing an appropriate hypnotic drug and if drug therapy is initiated it should be initiated at the lowest possible dose to minimise side effects.<ref>{{cite journal| journal = Clin Geriatr Med | year = 2008 | month = February | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 93–105, vii | title = Pharmacotherapy for insomnia | author = Tariq SH, Pulisetty S | pmid = 18035234 | doi = 10.1016/j.cger.2007.08.009}}</ref>An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the [[nonbenzodiazepine]]sedative-hypnotics, including eszopiclone appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother | year = 2006 | month = June | volume = 4 | issue = 2 |pages = 168–92 | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | author = Bain KT | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Eszopiclone has fewer [[anticholinergic]] side effects than racemic [[zopiclone]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patil PA, Kothekar MA |title=Development of safer molecules through chirality |journal=Indian J Med Sci |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=427–37 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17006031 |doi= 10.4103/0019-5359.27676|url=http://www.indianjmedsci.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5359;year=2006;volume=60;issue=10;spage=427;epage=437;aulast=Patil}}</ref> The following side effects may occur from usage of eszopiclone (Lunesta):<ref name="lunestasefxab">{{cite web |url= http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/lunesta_ad.htm |title= Lunesta |accessdate= 22 March 2008 |author= rxlist}}</ref>

'''Common side effects can include:'''

* [[itch]]ing
* incoordination
* [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs
* painful or frequent [[urination]]
* [[back pain]]

'''neuropsychiatric adverse effects reported include;'''<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry | year = 2007 | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 468–9 | title = New-onset transient hallucinations possibly due to eszopiclone: a case study |url =http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v09n06/v09n0611.pdf#page=5 |format =PDF |author =Duggal HS | pmid = 18185832 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.v09n0611e | pmc = 2139930}}</ref>

* [[aggressive]] behavior
* [[confusion]]
* [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]]
* auditory and visual [[hallucinations]]
* worsening of depression
* [[suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]]
* [[depersonalisation]]
* [[amnesia]]

If a person does not sleep immediately after taking eszopiclone or if they get up shortly after taking the medication they may experience dizziness, lightheadedness, [[hallucination]]s (seeing things or hearing voices that are not there), as well as problems with coordination and memory.

===Dependence===
In the United States Eszopiclone is a schedule IV controlled substance under the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. Use of [[benzodiazepines]] and similar benzodiazepine-like drugs such as eszopiclone may lead to physical and psychological dependence. The risk of abuse and dependence increases with the dose and duration of usage and concomitant use of other psychoactive drugs. The risk is also greater in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse or history of psychiatric disorders. Tolerance may develop after repeated use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs for a few weeks.
Eszopiclone was studied for up to 6 months in a group of patients which showed no signs of tolerance or dependence in a study funded and carried out by Sepracor.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent). | year = 2006 | month = January | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–9 | title = Eszopiclone (Lunesta): a new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agent  |pmc=1325284 | author = Brielmaier BD | pmid = 16424933}}</ref>

===Abuse===
A study of abuse potential of eszopiclone found that in persons with a known history of benzodiazepine abuse, eszopiclone at doses of 6 and 12&nbsp;mg produced effects similar to those of [[diazepam]] 20&nbsp;mg . The study found that at these doses which are two or more times greater than the maximum recommended doses, a dose-related increase in reports of amnesia and hallucinations was observed for both eszopiclone (lunesta) as well as for diazepam ([[Valium]]).<ref name="lunestasefxab"/>

===Overdose===
Eszopiclone is dangerous in overdose. Signs of eszopiclone overdose reported included dulled mental status, [[ST elevation|ST-elevation]] coronary [[vasospasm]], [[Troponin test|troponemia]], [[ventricular fibrillation]] arrest and prolonged [[coma]] (lasting up to 48 hours).<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Emerg Med | year = 2007 | month = July | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 735 (e5–6) | title = Prolonged coma after eszopiclone overdose | author = Lovett B | coauthors = Watts D, Grossman M | pmid = 17606111 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajem.2006.12.021}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller AH, Bruggman AR, Miller MM |title=Lunesta overdose: ST-elevation coronary vasospasm, troponemia, and ventricular fibrillation arrest |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=741–6 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16984850 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2006.02.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735-6757(06)00049-0}}</ref> Texas poison control centers reported that during 2005-2006 there were 525 total eszopiclone overdoses recorded in the state of [[Texas]], the majority of which were intentional suicide attempts.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Hum Exp Toxicol | year = 2007 | month = October | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 795–800 | title = Eszopiclone ingestions reported to Texas poison control centers, 2005 2006 | author = Forrester MB | pmid = 18025051 | doi = 10.1177/0960327107084045}}</ref>

If consumed within the last hour, eszopiclone overdose can be treated with the administration of [[activated charcoal]] or via [[gastric lavage]].<ref>(( cite web | url = http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Licensingofmedicines/Informationforlicenceapplicants/Guidance/OverdosesectionsofSPCs/Genericoverdosesections/Zopiclone/index.htm ))</ref> In potentially fatal overdose cases where eszopiclone has been consumed more than one hour before treatment, overdose symptoms may be successfully reversed with the intravenous administration of [[flumazenil]], although this is not recommended for mixed overdoses.<ref>(( cite web |  url = http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/informa-healthcare/zopiclone-overdose-responsive-to-flumazenil-cQmKQivWJH ))</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Eszopiclone acts on [[benzodiazepine]] binding site situated on [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> neurons]] as an [[agonist]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Vertex | year = 2007 | month = July&ndash;August | volume = 18 | issue = 74 |pages = 294–9 | title = [New hypnotics: perspectives from sleep physiology] | author =Jufe GS | pmid = 18265473}}</ref>
Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with serum levels peaking between 1 and 1.3 hours.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Health Syst Pharm | date =  January 1, 2006 |  volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–8 | title = Eszopiclone | author = Halas CJ | pmid = 16373464 | doi = 10.2146/ajhp050357}}</ref> The elimination half-life of eszopiclone is approximately 6 hours and it is extensively metabolized by oxidation and demethylation. Approximately 52% to 59% of a dose is weakly bound to plasma protein. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2E1]] are involved in the biotransformation of eszopiclone; thus, drugs that induce or inhibit these CYP isozymes may affect the metabolism of eszopiclone. Less than 10% of the orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as racemic zopiclone.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Clin Ther | year = 2006 | month = April | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–516 | title = Eszopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia | author = Najib J | pmid = 16750462 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.014}}</ref> In terms of benzodiazepine receptor binding and relevant potency, 3&nbsp;mg of eszopiclone is equivalent to 10&nbsp;mg of [[diazepam]].<ref>{{cite web

==Controversy==
The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine published a paper which had carried out a systematic review of the medical literature concerning insomnia medications including eszopiclone. The review found that almost all trials of sleep disorders and drugs are sponsored by the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. It was found that the odds ratio for finding results favorable to industry in
industry-sponsored trials was 3.6 times higher than non-industry-sponsored studies. The paper found that there is little research into hypnotics that is independent from the drug manufacturers. The author was concerned that there is no discussion of adverse effects of sedative hypnotics discussed in the medical literature such as significant increased levels of infection, cancers and increased [[Death|mortality]] in eszopiclone and other sedative hypnotic drugs and an overemphasis on the positive effects. The author concluded by stating that "''major hypnotic trials are needed to more carefully study potential adverse effects of hypnotics such as daytime impairment, [[infection]], [[cancer]], and [[death]] and the resultant balance of benefits and risks.''"<ref>{{cite journal | journal = J Clin Sleep Med | date =  December 15, 2007 |  volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 671–3 | title = Who should sponsor sleep disorders pharmaceutical trials? | author = Kripke DF | pmid = 18198797 | pmc=2556906}}</ref>

In a 2009 article in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], "Lost in Transmission — FDA Drug Information That Never Reaches Clinicians", it was reported that the largest of three Lunesta trials found that compared to placebo Lunesta "was superior to placebo" while it only  shortened initial time falling asleep by 15 minutes on average.  "Clinicians who are interested in the drug’s efficacy cannot find efficacy information in the label: it states only that Lunesta is superior to placebo. The FDA’s medical review provides efficacy data, albeit not until page 306 of the 403-page document. In the longest, largest phase 3 trial, patients in the Lunesta group reported falling asleep an average of 15 minutes faster and sleeping an average of 37 minutes longer than those in the placebo group. However, on average, Lunesta patients still met criteria for insomnia and reported no clinically meaningful improvement in next-day alertness or functioning."<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Schwartz | first = Lisa M. | coauthors = Steven Woloshin | date = | year = 2009 | month = October | title = Lost in Transmission — FDA Drug Information That Never Reaches Clinicians | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 361| issue = 18| pages = 1717–1720| publisher = NEJM.org | issn = | pmid = 19846841| doi = 10.1056/NEJMp0907708 | url = http://healthpolicyandreform.nejm.org/?p=2126&query=home | format = Online | accessdate = 2010-12-06 | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote =  }}</ref>

==Availability in Europe==
On September 11, 2007, Sepracor signed a marketing deal with British pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] for the rights to sell Eszopiclone (under the name '''Lunivia''' rather than Lunesta) in [[Europe]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2007/2007_09_11_GSK1114.htm GlaxoSmithKline and Sepracor Inc. announce international alliance for commercialisation of Lunivia]</ref> Sepracor was expected to receive approximately 155 million dollars if the deal went through.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 2008 Sepracor submitted an application to the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] (the European Union's equivalent to the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]) for authorization to market the drug in the EU, and initially received a favourable response.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2010/02/WC500070840.pdf COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USEm SUMMARY OF POSITIVE OPINION for LUNIVIA] - [[European Medicines Agency]]/[[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]], 23 Oct 2010</ref>  However Sepracor withdrew its authorization application in 2009 after the EMA stated it would not be granting eszopiclone 'new active substance' status, as it was essentially pharmacologically and therapeutically too similar to [[zopiclone]] to be considered a new patentable product.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2009/11/news_detail_000083.jsp&jsenabled=true Sepracor Pharmaceuticals Ltd withdraws its marketing authorisation application for Lunivia (eszopiclone)] - [[European Medicines Agency]], 15 May 2009</ref> Since zopiclone's [[patent]] has expired, this ruling would have allowed rival companies to also legally produce cheaper [[Generic drug|generic]] versions of eszopiclone for the European market.<ref>[http://www.twobirds.com/English/News/Articles/Pages/Data_exclusivity_definition_new_active_substance.Aspx Data exclusivity and definition of a new active substance: suspension of generic escitalopram-containing medicines by CHMP] - Bird and Bird Commercial Law 23 Apr 2010</ref> {{As of|2012|11}}, Sepracor has not resubmitted its authorization application and Lunesta/Lunivia is not available in Europe. The deal with GSK fell through, and GSK instead launched a $3.3 billion deal to market Actelion's [[Almorexant]] sleeping tablet, which entered stage three medical trials before development was abandoned due to side effects.
