'''Megaloblastic anemia''' (or '''megaloblastic anaemia''') is an [[anemia]] (of [[macrocytic anemia|macrocytic]] classification) that results from inhibition of [[DNA replication|DNA synthesis]] in red blood cell production.<ref name="urlMegaloblastic Anemia: Overview - eMedicine Hematology">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/204066-overview |title=Megaloblastic Anemia: Overview - eMedicine Hematology |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> When DNA synthesis is impaired, the [[cell cycle]] cannot progress from the G2 growth stage to the mitosis (M) stage. This leads to continuing cell growth without division, which presents as macrocytosis.
Megaloblastic anemia has a rather slow onset, especially when compared to that of other anemias.
The defect in red cell DNA synthesis is most often due to hypovitaminosis, specifically a deficiency of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]] and/or [[folic acid]]. Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} deficiency alone will not cause the syndrome in the presence of sufficient folate, for the mechanism is loss of B{{ssub|12}} dependent folate recycling, followed by folate-deficiency loss of [[nucleic acid]] synthesis (specifically thymine), leading to defects in DNA synthesis. Folic acid supplementation in the absence of vitamin B{{ssub|12}} prevents this type of anemia (although other vitamin B{{ssub|12}}-specific pathologies continue). Loss of micronutrients may also be a cause. Copper deficiency resulting from zinc excess from unusually high oral consumption of zinc containing denture fixation creams has been found to be a cause.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berkowitz|first=Arnold|title=M.D.|url=http://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/hematologic-malignancies/news/print/hematology-oncology/%7B9FDEC553-9EA3-4C38-A4A0-59B1CD4BCCA2%7D/Check-the-mouths-of-patients-with-low-risk-myelodysplasia|work=Oncologist|publisher=Oncology News|accessdate=7-13-12}}</ref>

Megaloblastic anemia not due to hypovitaminosis may be caused by antimetabolites that poison DNA production directly, such as some chemotherapeutic or antimicrobial agents (for example [[azathioprine]] or [[trimethoprim]]).

The pathological state of megaloblastosis is characterized by many large immature and dysfunctional red blood cells ([[megaloblasts]]) in the bone marrow<ref name="titleMegaloblastic (Pernicious) Anemia - Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital">{{cite web |url=http://www.lpch.org/DiseaseHealthInfo/HealthLibrary/hematology/megalob.html |title=Megaloblastic (Pernicious) Anemia - Lucile Packard Children's Hospital |accessdate=2008-03-12 |work=}}</ref> and also by [[hypersegmented neutrophil]]s (those exhibiting five or more nuclear lobes ("segments"), with up to four lobes being normal). These hypersegmented [[neutrophil]]s are found in the "peripheral blood" (i.e., a diagnostic smear of a blood-sample taken from the circulation).

==Causes==
* [[Vitamin B12 deficiency]] leading to folate deficiency:
** [[Achlorhydria]]-induced malabsorption
** Deficient intake
** Deficient [[intrinsic factor]], a molecule produced by cells in the stomach that is required for B12 absorption ([[pernicious anemia]] or [[gastrectomy]])
** [[Coeliac disease]]
** Biological competition for vitamin B12 by [[diverticulosis]], [[fistula]], intestinal [[anastomosis]], or infection by the marine parasite ''[[Diphyllobothrium latum]] (fish tapeworm)''
** Selective [[vitamin B12]] [[malabsorption]] (congenital—[[juvenile megaloblastic anaemia 1|juvenile megaloblastic anemia 1]]—and drug-induced)
** [[Chronic pancreatitis]]
** Ileal resection and bypass
** Nitrous oxide anesthesia (usually requires repeated instances).

* [[Folate deficiency]]:
** [[Alcoholism]]
** Deficient intake
** Increased needs: [[pregnancy]], [[infant]], rapid cellular proliferation, and [[cirrhosis]]
** [[Malabsorption]] (congenital and drug-induced)
** Intestinal and [[jejunal]] resection
** (indirect) Deficient [[thiamine]] and factors (e.g., enzymes) responsible for [[folate metabolism]].

* Combined Deficiency: vitamin B12 & folate.

* Inherited Pyrimidine Synthesis Disorders: [[Orotic aciduria]]

* Inherited [[DNA]] Synthesis Disorders

* Toxins and Drugs:
** [[Folic acid]] antagonists ([[methotrexate]])
** [[Purine]] synthesis antagonists ([[6-mercaptopurine]])
** [[Pyrimidine]] antagonists ([[cytosine arabinoside]])
** [[Phenytoin]]
** [[Nitrous Oxide]]

* [[Erythroleukemia]]

==Hematological findings==
The [[blood film]] can point towards vitamin deficiency:
*Decreased [[red blood cell]] (RBC) count and [[hemoglobin]] levels<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000567.htm MedlinePlus: Megaloblastic Anemia, "Megaloblastic anemia is a blood disorder in which there is anemia with larger-than-normal red blood cells. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues."</ref>
*Increased [[mean corpuscular volume]] (MCV, >95 fl) and [[mean corpuscular hemoglobin]] (MCH)
*Normal [[mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration]] (MCHC, 32–36 g/dL)
*The [[reticulocyte]] count is decreased due to destruction of fragile and abnormal megaloblastic erythroid precursor.
*The [[platelet]] count may be reduced. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
*[[Neutrophil granulocyte]]s may show [[multisegmented neutrophil|multisegmented]] nuclei ("senile neutrophil"). This is thought to be due to decreased production and a compensatory prolonged lifespan for circulating neutrophils, which increase numbers of nuclear segments with age. {{Citation needed|reason=compensatory mechanism|date=July 2008}}
*[[Anisocytosis]] (increased variation in RBC size) and [[poikilocytosis]] (abnormally shaped RBCs).
*[[Macrocyte]]s (larger than normal RBCs) are present.
*[[Ovalocyte]]s (oval-shaped RBCs) are present.
*[[Howell-Jolly body|Howell-Jolly bodies]] (chromosomal remnant) also present.

Blood chemistries will also show:
*In increased [[lactic acid dehydrogenase]] (LDH) level. The isozyme is LDH-2 which is typical of the serum and hematopoetic cells.
*Increased homocysteine and [[methylmalonic acid]] in Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} deficiency
*Increased homocysteine in folate deficiency
Normal levels of both methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine rule out clinically significant cobalamin deficiency with virtual certainty.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Savage DG, Lindenbaum J, Stabler SP, Allen RH |title=Sensitivity of serum methylmalonic acid and total homocysteine determinations for diagnosing cobalamin and folate deficiencies |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=239–46 |year=1994 |pmid=8154512 |doi= 10.1016/0002-9343(94)90149-X|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0002-9343(94)90149-X}}</ref>

[[Bone marrow]] (not normally checked in a patient suspected of megaloblastic anemia) shows megaloblastic [[hyperplasia]].

==Analysis==
The gold standard for the diagnosis of Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} deficiency is a low blood level of Vitamin B{{ssub|12}}. A low level of blood Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} is a finding that normally can and should be treated by injections, supplementation, or dietary or lifestyle advice, but it is not a diagnosis.  Hypovitaminosis B{{ssub|12}} can result from a number of mechanisms, including those listed above. For determination of etiology, further patient history, testing, and empirical therapy may be clinically indicated.

A measurement of methylmalonic acid can provide an indirect method for partially differentiating Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} and folate deficiencies. The level of methylmalonic acid is not elevated in folic acid deficiency. Direct measurement of blood cobalamin remains the gold standard because the test for elevated methylmalonic acid is not specific enough. Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} is one necessary prosthetic group to the enzyme [[methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase]]. Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} deficiency is but one among the conditions that can lead to dysfunction of this enzyme and a buildup of its substrate, [[methylmalonic acid]], the elevated level of which can be detected in the urine and blood.

Due to the lack of available radioactive Vitamin B{{ssub|12}}, the [[Schilling test]] is now largely a historical artifact.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  The [[Schilling test]] was performed in the past to help determine the nature of the vitamin B{{ssub|12}} deficiency.  An advantage of the [[Schilling test]] was that it often included Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} with intrinsic factor.
