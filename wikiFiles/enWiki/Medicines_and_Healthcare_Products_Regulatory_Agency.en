The '''Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency''' ('''MHRA''') is a UK government agency which is responsible for ensuring that [[medicine]]s and [[medical device]]s work and are acceptably safe.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency was formed in 2003 with the merger of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA).  In April 2013, it merged with the [[National Institute for Biological Standards and Control]] (NIBSC) and was rebranded, with the MHRA identity being used for the parent organisation and one of the centres within the group. It is an [[executive agency]] of the [[Department of Health (UK)|Department of Health]].  The agency employs over 900 people.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Aboutus/Workingforus/index.htm | title = Working for is: MHRA | accessdate = 24 October 2012 }}</ref>

==Structure==
The MHRA is divided into three main centres:
* MHRA Regulatory (the regulator for the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries)
* [[Clinical Practice Research Datalink]]
* [[National Institute for Biological Standards and Control]]

==History==
[[Image:MHRA Logo.png|thumb|230px|Logo of the MHRA (2006-2013)]]
In 1999, the [[Medicines Control Agency]] (MCA) took over control of the [[General Practice Research Database]] (GPRD) from [[Office for National Statistics]]. Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) merged in 2003 to form the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (with a lower case "products" at that time).  In April 2012, the GPRD was expanded and relaunched as the Clinical Practice Datalink (CPRD). In April 2013, the MHRA merged with the [[National Institute for Biological Standards and Control]] (NIBSC) and was rebranded, with the MHRA identity being used for the parent organisation and one of the centres within the group.  At the same time the CPRD was formally declared a separate centre if the MHRA as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/CON254872|date=28 March 2013|accessdate=04 April 2013|title=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency Expands|publisher=MHRA}}</ref> 

==Roles of the MHRA==

#Operate [[Postmarketing surveillance|post-marketing surveillance]] for [[report]]ing, investigating and monitoring of adverse drug reactions to medicines and incidents with medical devices.
#Assessment and authorisation of medicinal products for sale and supply in [[United Kingdom|UK]].
#Oversee the Notified Bodies that ensure medical device manufacturers comply with regulatory requirements before putting devices on the market.
#Operate a quality surveillance system to sample and test medicines to address quality defects and to monitor the safety and quality of unlicensed products.
#Investigate internet sales and potential counterfeiting of medicines, and prosecute where necessary.
#Regulate clinical trials of medicines and medical devices.
#Monitor and ensure compliance with statutory obligations relating to medicines and medical devices.
#Promote safe use of [[medicines]] and [[medical device|device]]s.

MHRA hosts and supports a number of expert advisory bodies, including the [[Commission on Human Medicine]] which replaced the [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] in 2005, and the [[British Pharmacopoeia Commission]].

As part of the European system of approval, MHRA or other national bodies can be the rapporteur or co-rapporteur for any given pharmaceutical application, taking on the bulk of the verification work on behalf of all members, while the documents are still sent to other members as and where requested.
