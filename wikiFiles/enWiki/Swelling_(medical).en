In [[medicine|medical parlance]], '''swelling''', '''turgescence''' or '''tumefaction''' is a transient abnormal enlargement of a body part or area not caused by [[neoplasm|proliferation of cells]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |title=Swelling |edition=31st |year=2007 |publisher=[[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] |isbn=9781849723480 }}</ref> It is caused by accumulation of [[Interstitial_fluid|fluid in tissues]].<ref name=MedlinePlus/> It can occur throughout the body (generalized), or a specific part or organ can be affected (localized).<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{cite web |url= http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003103.htm |title=Swelling |date=28 October 2010 |work=[[MedlinePlus]] |accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref>

Swelling is considered one of the five characteristics of [[inflammation]]; along with pain, heat, redness, and loss of function. 

In a general sense, the suffix "-megaly" is used to indicate a growth, as in [[hepatomegaly]], [[acromegaly]], and [[splenomegaly]].

A body part may swell in response to injury, [[infection]], or disease. Swelling, especially of the [[ankle]], can occur if the body is not circulating fluid well.

Generalized swelling, or massive [[edema]] (also called [[anasarca]]), is a common sign in severely ill people. Although slight edema may be difficult to detect to the untrained eye, especially in an overweight person, massive edema is very obvious.

==Types of swelling==
''Congenital swellings'' are present since birth, e.g., [[hemangioma]], [[meningocele]], etc. Some congenital swellings may not appear since birth, but later in life, e.g., [[branchial cyst]], [[dermatoid cyst]], [[thyroglossal cyst]].

''Traumatic swellings'' develop immediately after trauma, e.g., [[hematoma]], [[Joint dislocation|dislocation]]

''Inflammatory swelling'': It may be either acute or chronic variety. The presentations of acute swellings are redness, local fever, pain and impairment of function of the affected organ. The related lymph nodes will be affected and will show signs of acute [[lymphadenitis]]. 
Chronic inflammatory swellings will show the signs of acute inflammatory swellings, but in subdued form. In this case, [[edema]] might not occur. Such swellings can be differentiated from neoplastic swellings by the fact that neoplastic swellings never recede in size, but inflammatory swellings may show occasional diminution.

== Treatment ==
While it is possible for mild swelling to go away on its own, several things can be done to relieve the symptoms or hasten the process. The [[RICE (medicine)|HI-RICE]] first aid method of rest and protecting the affected area has long been taught as a short term solution. The application of oxygen is known to assist in the reduction of swelling.
An effective option for extrinsic treatment of swelling and it's reduction is Kinesio Tape (KT). By strategically cutting and placing Kinesio Tape above the area of swelling it assists in the removal of edema (swelling) by directing the exudates toward lymphatic ducts. This is aided by KT's inherent property of lifting the epidermis away from the dermis creating a larger area for blood flow and lymphatic movement.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thelen|first=M.|coauthors=Dauber, J., Stoneman, P.|title=The Clinical Efficacy of Kinesio tape for Shoulder Pain: A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Clinical Trial|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy|year=2008|pages=389â€“395}}</ref>
