COMMENTING OUT TEXT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN COPIED FROM ELSEWHERE.

I suspect that the following text may be a copyvio from the hospital's website

'''History of Wills Eye'''

'''The first Wills Eye Hospital,''' containing 70 beds, was located at the southwest corner of 18th and Race Streets in Philadelphia, opposite what is now Logan Circle. As a specialty institution from its inception, Wills played a vital role in establishing ophthalmology as a separate branch of medicine in this country.

By the early 1900s, Wills Eye had outgrown its quarters. In 1932 the Hospital relocated to a new building at 16th and Spring Garden Streets. The new Hospital expanded the inpatient bed capacity to 120, increased outpatient service areas, and provided additional conference and teaching facilities. In the 1960s, Wills Eye began to develop subspecialty services, in addition to its General Ophthalmology Service (now the Cataract and Primary Eye Care Service). Dealing with particular diseases or parts of the eye, these services now number nine: Contact Lens, Cornea, Glaucoma, Neuro-Ophthalmology, Oculoplastics, Oncology, Pathology, Pediatric Ophthalmology, and Retina.

In 1972, Wills Eye affiliated with Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University. As a result, Wills Eye now serves as Jefferson's Department of Ophthalmology. All Jefferson medical students receive their basic eye instruction and training at Wills Eye. With its continued growth, Wills Eye once again needed larger quarters. Wills Eye moved to a new facility at 9th and Walnut Streets in 1980. This new building won several design awards, and was nearly twice as large as the previous building. It featured greatly expanded outpatient services in keeping with the trend toward outpatient care in ophthalmology.

Wills Eye constructed a new state-of-the-art, outpatient facility. The new Wills Eye, located at 840 Walnut Street, directly across the street from its current inpatient facility. It opened in June 2002 and is considered one of the most advanced eye centers in the world. The eight-story building delivers a full range of eye care services in a modern, comfortable setting. The new facility houses an ambulatory surgery center, physician offices, clinics and a state-of-the-art center for ophthalmic education and research.

'''Pioneering Technology'''

Many of the special instruments and techniques that are commonplace in ophthalmology were invented or developed at Wills Eye. During its centuries-long history, the Hospital's staff has pioneered the development of innovative techniques in ophthalmology. The implantation of an artificial intraocular lens to replace the cataract patient's own clouded lens was pioneered in the United States in 1952 by Warren Reese, M.D., and Turgut Hamdi, M.D., of the Hospital staff. Other revolutionary cataract surgery procedures were developed by former Wills Eye resident Charles Kelman, M.D. A vitrectomy machine, now widely used for eye microsurgery, was invented in 1972 by Wills Eye physician Jay L. Federman, M.D.

'''Patient Care Services'''

For common eye problems to rare sight-threatening diseases, Wills Eye provides general eye care and nine subspecialty services attracting patients from throughout the Delaware Valley, across the country and around the world. The sophistication of care delivered at Wills Eye can be evidenced by the following descriptions of the activities performed by its specialty services:

'''The Primary Eye Care (CPEC) Servic'''e is the hub of Wills Eye. Approximately 22,000 patients are seen each year. Wills physicians perform routine eye exams and refer any serious complications to the Hospital's subspecialty services. Each year thousands of patients also undergo cataract surgery at Wills Eye, benefiting from the experience of world-class surgeons consistently rated as America's best.

'''The Contact Lens''' Service evaluates and fits patients of all ages and medical conditions with the latest in cosmetic and therapeutic contact lens technology. With its participation in major national studies on advances in contact lenses, this service provides its patients with the newest devices and the latest information available.   

''' The Cornea Service''' is a leading center for corneal transplants and the treatment of corneal diseases and conditions. More than 400 corneal transplants are performed at Wills Eye each year. In addition to corneal transplants, physicians in the Cornea Service diagnose and treat corneal dystrophies, abrasions, scars, and congenital corneal problems.

''' The Glaucoma Service''', the country's largest, treats patients with the newest laser and surgical techniques and drug therapies available. The Glaucoma Service Diagnostic Laboratory provides advanced computerized techniques to uncover the earliest signs of glaucoma in suspected patients, as well as charting the progression of the condition, including the slightest change in the optic nerve, in patients who have already been diagnosed.  

The physicians on the '''Neuro-Ophthalmology Service''' have a long history of investigating and treating optic neuritis, thyroid-related eye disease, ischemic optic neuropathy, blepharospasm, and hemifacial spasm.

''' The Oculoplastics Service''' is one of the largest of its kind in the country. Oculoplastic surgery is a subspecialty of ophthalmology that focuses on problems surrounding the eyeball (the lids, the orbit and the lacrimal system) as well as artificial eyes. The Service also includes a cosmetic surgery unit.    

''' The Oncology Service''', one of the largest in the world, serves an international patient population. Its physicians are leaders in the diagnosis and treatment of ocular oncology, particularly melanoma and retinoblastoma, and have developed new techniques to save eyes that, in the past, it would have been necessary to remove.

''' The Pathology Service''' is the backbone of teaching at Wills Eye. It conducts ongoing research into the broad spectrum of ocular diseases. It features state-of-the-art technology, and is a center of activity for Wills residents and fellows, as well as for Jefferson medical students.

''' The Pediatric Ophthalmology Service''' treats the unique ocular problems of children including strabismus (crossed eyes) and amblyopia (lazy eye). Physicians also perform cataract surgery on infants as early as a few weeks old. A pediatric contact lens service at Wills Eye fits and stocks lenses exclusively for children.

'''The Retina Service''' was the first subspecialty service at Wills Eye. Today, an average of 15,000 patients are diagnosed and treated here each year. All vitreoretinal diseases are treated at Wills Eye, including macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, and retinitis pigmentosa.

'''Other services'''

Other ocular services at Wills Eye include: the Refractive Surgery Unit, the Foerderer Center for the Study of Eye Movement Disorders in Children, the Center for Sports Vision, the Low Vision Service, and a 24-hour Emergency Service open 365 days a year.

'''Wills Eye Surgical Network'''

Wills Eye has also branched into the community with a network of same-day surgery centers throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. The centers offer care that reaches beyond ophthalmology to other surgical specialties such as orthopedics, pediatrics, plastics, and ear, nose and throat. Wills Eye also provides laser vision correction at its center in downtown Philadelphia and centers throughout the tri-state region.

'''Education'''

Wills Eye built its outstanding reputation as a pioneer in ophthalmic education by establishing the first ophthalmology residency program in the country in 1839. Admission to the residency program is extremely competitive; eight physicians are selected every year from 500 applicants. Wills currently has 24 residents enrolled in the three-year program, making it one of the largest ophthalmic training programs in the country.

In addition to the residency program, Wills offers fellowships in each ophthalmic subspecialty. At the present time there are 26 ophthalmologists enrolled in clinical and research fellowship programs.

Wills has a long-standing academic and clinical relationship with Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and Jefferson Medical College. Thomas Jefferson University sponsors the Wills Eye Residency Program and Wills serves as Jefferson's Department of Ophthalmology. Jefferson medical students and non-ophthalmology residents rotate through Wills Eye as part of their training.

'''Research'''

Research has a long and distinguished history at Wills Eye. It is carried out in the laboratories of the Research Department (which was first formally organized in 1952), in many of the Wills subspecialty services, and in cooperative efforts involving both ophthalmologists and laboratory scientists.

Macular degeneration, Stickler syndrome, glaucoma and ocular cancers in children and adults are the primary areas of research taking place at Wills Eye using the most advanced scientific equipment. Through molecular genetics, gene identification and gene sequencing investigators are compiling critical data for use in future treatments or cures of these blinding diseases.

A major aspect of research is directed at improving the diagnosis of diseases and conditions and at developing better methods of treatment. Other studies are aimed at developing new treatments for infectious or inflammatory eye disease, either of which, if not treated promptly and effectively, can permanently diminish sight.

'''Endowed Chairs'''

The first endowed chair at Wills Eye was the Thomas David Duane Professorship in Ophthalmology. It was named after the former Ophthalmologist-in-Chief and was established in 1987 to fund ongoing research at the Hospital.

The Board of Directors of City Trusts, Wills' governing body, authorized $4.5 million to establish and seed four new clinical research chairs. The chairs were awarded to the Cornea Service, the Glaucoma Service, Ocular Oncology and Ophthalmic Pathology.

The Pathology Chair is already fully funded, thanks to the generous support of Sara L. Simmonds, wife of the late Noel T. Simmons, M.D., a Wills ex-resident. As a result, the Pathology chair was named the Noel T. and Sara L. Simmonds Professorship in Ophthalmic Pathology.

By a unanimous vote of the Board of Directors of City Trusts, the Glaucoma chair was named for [[Louis J. Esposito]], President of the Board of Directors of City Trusts and a staunch, long-time supporter of Wills Eye.

'''Community Outreach'''

Wills Eye maintains a Free Public Eye Screening that has been held in the Wills Eye building every spring since 1980 for members of the community. Adults and children over the age of three are screened for various eye problems by members of the Wills Eye medical staff who volunteer their time. The visual acuity of screening participants is tested by Wills Eye ophthalmic technicians.

'''Governance'''

Wills is managed by a tripartite organization consisting of the Board of Directors of City Trusts, the Wills Eye administration, and the medical staff. Overall policy — including matters pertaining to selection, direction, and accountability of management — is determined by the Board of Directors of City Trusts. Establishment of institutional objectives and decisions relating to the operations are the responsibility of the Wills administration. Strategies and administrative concerns relating to professional matters, the residency program, and research are under the purview of the Ophthalmologist-in-Chief and Executive Council of the medical staff.

'''Board of Directors of City Trusts'''

In his bequest, James Wills stipulated that Wills be administered by the Mayor of Philadelphia or his representatives. In 1869, the Pennsylvania legislature established the Board of Directors of City Trusts for the purpose of administering such funds left in trust to the City.

The Board consists of twelve citizens of Philadelphia, appointed by and accountable to the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. Members of the Board, who are named for life or during good behavior, serve without compensation. The Mayor and the President of the Council of the City of Philadelphia are ex-officio members. The Board is required to report annually to the above Court, the legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the Council of the City of Philadelphia on the condition and status of the trusts, which it administers.

The Board's bylaws provide that matters relating to Wills Eye shall be supervised by a standing committee of the Board, the Hospital and Research Committee. In addition, another of the Board's standing committees, the Joint Conference Committee, is responsible for the supervision of all medical affairs related to the administration of Wills. The CEO of Wills consults frequently with the Chair of the Hospital Committee on all matters of Wills policy, organizational changes, and major operational problems.

'''Wills Eye Policy'''

Since its founding, Wills Eye has been treating anyone needing ophthalmic care without regard to creed, color, sex or financial status. Therefore, when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, Wills Eye was already in compliance with the formal requirements that no person shall, on the grounds of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination in the provision of any care or service.

This nondiscriminatory policy of Wills Eye applies to patients, physicians and employees as well. Under no circumstances will the application of this policy result in the segregation or resegregation of buildings, wings, floors or rooms for reasons of race, color, national origin or financial status. -->

==History of Wills Eye==

James Wills, Jr., a Quaker merchant, was instrumental in the founding of Wills Eye through his bequest of $116,000 in 1832 to the City of Philadelphia. Wills stipulated that the funds were to be used specifically for the indigent, blind, and lame.  Over the years it evolved into solely an eye hospital.  The first Wills Eye Hospital opened in 1834 near Logan Circle at 18th & Race Streets.

Early surgeons at Wills Eye included Isaac Parrish, M.D. and Isaac Hays, MD,<ref>Jackson, Samuel.
