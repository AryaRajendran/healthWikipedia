'''Giant cell carcinoma of the lung''' (GCCL) is a rare [[histology|histological]] form of [[cell differentiation|undifferentiated]] [[lung cancer]] traditionally classified within the [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small cell lung carcinomas]]. The characteristic feature of this highly lethal [[malignant|malignancy]] is the distinctive [[light]] [[microscope|microscopic]] appearance of its extremely large [[cell (biology)|cells]], which are bizarre and highly [[pleomorphism (cytology)|pleomorphic]], and which often contain more than one huge, misshapen, pleomorphic [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] ("[[syncytium|syncytia]]"), which result from [[cell fusion]].

Although it is common in the lung cancer literature to refer to histologically mixed tumors containing significant numbers of malignant giant cells as "giant cell carcinomas", technically a diagnosis of "giant cell carcinoma" should be limited strictly to [[neoplasm]]s containing ''only'' malignant giant cells (i.e. "pure" giant cell carcinoma).<ref name='who2004' />

Aside from the great heterogeneity seen in lung cancers (especially those occurring among tobacco smokers), the considerable variability in [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] and [[biopsy|sampling]] techniques used in medical practice, the high relative proportion of individuals with suspected GCCL who do not undergo complete [[surgery|surgical]] [[Segmental resection|resection]], and the near-universal lack of complete sectioning and pathological examination of resected tumor specimens prevent high levels of quantitative accuracy.

==Epidemiology==
The true [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], [[prevalence (epidemiology)|prevalence]], and [[mortality rate|mortality]] of GCCL is generally unknown due to a lack of accurate [[cancer]] data on a national level. It is known to be a very rare tumor variant in all populations examined, however. In an [[United States|American]] study of a database of over 60,000 lung cancers, GCCL comprised between 0.3% and 0.4% of primary [[pulmonary]] malignancies, with an age-adjusted incidence rate of about 3 new cases per million persons per year.<ref name='TravisTravis'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD, Travis LB, DeVesa SS |title=Lung Cancer |journal=Cancer |year=1995 |volume=75 |pages=191–202 |pmid=8000996 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950101)75:1+<191::AID-CNCR2820751307>3.0.CO;2-Y}}</ref> Wit

==Classification==
For several decades, primary lung cancers were consistently dichotomously classified for treatment and research purposes into [[Small-cell lung carcinoma|small cell lung carcinomas]] (SCLC's) and [[Non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small cell lung carcinomas]] (NSCLC's), based on an oversimplified approach that is now clearly outmoded.

The subclassification of GCCL among these major taxa has undergone significant changes in recent decades. Under the 2nd revision (1981) of the WHO classification, it was considered a subtype of [[large-cell lung carcinoma|large cell carcinoma]].<ref name='WHO2'>{{cite book |author=World Health Organization |title=Histological typing of Lung Tumours |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=1981 |edition=2nd}}</ref> In the 3rd (1999) revision,<ref name='WHO1999'>{{cite journal |author=Brambilla E, Travis WD, Colby TV, Corrin B, Shimosato Y |title=The new World Health Organization classification of lung tumours |journal=Eur.

J. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1059–68 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11829087 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11829087 |doi=10.1183/09031936.01.00275301}}</ref> it was placed within a taxon called "Carcinomas with Pleomorphic, Sarcomatoid, or Sarcomatous Elements", along with  [[pleomorphic carcinoma]], [[spindle cell carcinoma]], [[carcinosarcoma]], and [[pulmonary blastoma]], which are (arguably) related variants. While the 4th revision ("WHO-2004") retained the same grouping of lesions as the 3rd revision, the name of the major taxon was shortened to "[[sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung|sarcomatoid carcinomas]]".<ref name='who2004' />

The current rules for classifying lung cancers under WHO-2004, while useful and improved, remain to some extent fairly complex, ambiguous, arbitrary, and incomplete.<ref name='who2004' /> Although it is fairly common for mixed tumors that are seen to contain malignant giant cells to be called "giant cell carcinomas", ''accurate'' classification of a pulmonary tumor as a GCCL requires that the ''entire tumor'' consists ''only'' of malignant giant cells. Therefore, complete sampling of the entire tumor — obtained via a [[surgery|surgical]] [[Segmental resection|resection]] — is absolutely necessary for a definitive diagnosis of GCCL to be made.<ref name='who2004' />

==Microscopic features and cytology==
The background contained numerous lymphocytes and neutrophils. The shape of the tumor cell was spindle or pleomorphic, and the sizes of the tumor cells varied by more than 5-fold. The tumor cells had an abundant, thick and well-demarcated cytoplasm. The location of the nucleus was centrifugal, and the nucleus was oval or irregularly shaped. Multinucleated giant cells were frequently observed. The size of the nucleus was more than 5 times that of normal lymphocytes, and its size also varied by more than 5-fold. The nuclear membrane was thin, and nuclear chromatin was coarsely granular, while the nucleolus was single and round.

In cytological preparations, giant cells typically appear as single cells or in flat loose clusters, and occasionally in fascicles.<ref name='HiroshimaDosaka'>{{cite journal |author=Hiroshima K, Dosaka-Akita H, Usuda K, ''et al.'' |title=Cytological characteristics of pulmonary pleomorphic and giant cell carcinomas |journal=Acta Cytol. |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=173–9 |year=2011 |pmid=21325803 |doi=10.1159/000320860 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp??DOI=000320860&typ=pdf}}</ref> 

GCCL are considered a member of the most common type of [[lung cancer]], called "[[Non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small cell carcinomas]]". This group of lethal neoplasms make up approximately 85% of all lung cancers.<ref name='who2004' /> By the definition of "large-vs.-small cell carcinoma", the diameter of GCCL cells '''must''' be considerably greater than three times that of a resting (i.e. unstimulated) [[lymphocyte]]. Also by definition, GCCL do '''not''' contain '''any''' amount of these small, neurosecretory granule-containing, [[neuroendocrine]] cells that are characteristic of [[small cell carcinoma]]s — when they do, the tumor should be classified as a [[combined small-cell lung carcinoma|combined small cell carcinoma]].<ref name='who2004' />

Compared to most other lung cancer variants, cells comprising GCCL tend to be much larger (up to 150 micrometers diameter, or even larger),<ref name='DavidsonMcNicol'>{{cite journal |author=Davidson JF, McNicol GP, Frank GL, Anderson TJ, Douglas AS |title=Plasminogen-activator-producing tumour |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=5636 |pages=88–91 |year=1969 |month=January |pmid=5761832 |pmc=1982019 }}</ref> Both cells and nuclei show extreme variation in size distribution and shape. Carcinomatous giant cells carcinoma nuclei have been reported to average 5 times the size of lymphocyte nuclei.<ref name='HiroshimaDosaka'/> 

The cells from giant cell carcinomas are [[anaplastic]], and show no evidence of cell maturation or differentiation, lacking the [[Cytopathology|cytological]] and tissue architectural characteristics of [[squamous cell carcinoma]], [[adenocarcinoma]], [[neuroendocrine]] carcinomas, or other more differentiated lung cancer cell types. They tend to be highly pleomorphic (i.e. variable in characteristics), but are most often round and/or polygonal in shape, with a relatively low nuclear-to-[[cytoplasm]]ic ratio. When associated with spindle cells, as they very frequently are in tumors with mixed histology, malignant giant cells tend to form loosely cohesive aggregate structures on cytological examination. However, when a [[biopsy]] sample consists purely of malignant giant cells, the cells tend to be single and disaggregated.<ref name='who2004' />

Case series suggest that the relative number of giant cells in a given tumor are generally directly proportional to the size of the tumor, and to the relative amount of necrosis.<ref name='CacicOberman'>{{cite journal |author=Caci&#x107; M, Oberman B, Dvornik G |title=Investigation of the applicability of histological classification of bronchial carcinoma according to the World Health Organization |journal=Tumori |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=580–2 |year=1989 |month=December |pmid=2482566 }}</ref>

Giant cells in a lung cancer are highly associated with the presence of spindle cells.<ref name='MatsuiKitagawa'>{{cite journal |author=Matsui K, Kitagawa M |title=Spindle cell carcinoma of the lung. A clinicopathologic study of three cases |journal=Cancer |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=2361–7 |year=1991 |month=May |pmid=1707339 }}</ref>

The [[chromatin]] of malignant giant cells tends to be hyperchromatic and coarsely clumped. Nucleoli are usually multiple and prominent.<ref name='DavidsonMcNicol'/>

Subcellular characteristics often noted in the malignant giant cells of GCCL cases include abundant mitochondria, concentric whorls of tonofilament-like fibrils, and aggregates of several pairs of centrioles.<ref name='WangSeemayer'>{{cite journal |author=Wang NS, Seemayer TA, Ahmed MN, Knaack J |title=Giant cell carcinoma of the lung. A light and electron microscopic study |journal=Hum. Pathol. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–16 |year=1976 |month=January |pmid=172430 }}</ref>

Both "tumor cell-tumor cell" and "leukocyte-tumor cell" emperipolesis (i.e. active penetration of the latter by the former) is very commonly seen in cases of GCCL.<ref name='WangSeemayer'/>

==Tissue architectural features==
In mixed tumors, giant cells are more likely to be found in higher proportions at the edge of a tumor.<ref name='MatsuiKitagawa'/> When extensive necrosis is present, it is possible for a giant cell tumor to have only a thin rim of viable cells remaining at the perimeter of the mass.

In one early case series, abundant production of loose malignant giant cells were noted to fill the [[alveoli]] of victims without destroying, infiltrating, or disturbing the normal underlying architecture, a [[pathology|pathologic]] behavior that bears some resemblance to the pneumonic variant of [[bronchioloalveolar carcinoma]].<ref name='Zaib'/>

Extensive tumor necrosis and hemorrhage is extremely common in GCCL.<ref name='Zaib'/>

Although the issue has not been extensively studied in a controlled fashion, GCCL's have been noted to contain significantly elevated levels of [[VEGF]].<ref name='JiangLu'>{{cite journal | author = Jiang DF, Lu YL, Qiu ZY ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | title = Study of differential expression of molecules affecting the metastatic potential between highly and poorly metastatic human lung giant cell carcinoma | journal = Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zai | volume = 25 | pages = 131–4 }}</ref> However, in one study where a giant cell carcinoma tumor that had been completely excised was sectioned and examined, no qualitative or quantitative abnormalities in tissue vascularization were noted.<ref name='DavidsonMcNicol'/>

GCCL have been noted to be encapsulated, and to be divided via septa into "pseudolobules", by a highly fibrous stroma, suggested to be produced commensurately with tumor growth. The capsule is typically infiltrated with malignant giant cells.<ref name='KennedyA'>{{cite journal |author=Kennedy A |title=Pathology and survival in operable cases of giant-cell carcinoma of the lung |journal=J.

==Macroscopic features==
Giant cell carcinomas of the lung frequently show extensive necrosis<ref name='KennedyA'/> and myxoid degeneration.<ref name='MatsuiKitagawa'/>

A trend toward less vascularity and tissue density (with lower contrast enhancement on CT) has been noted toward the center of these lesions, especially in larger tumors, and even in tumors without a significant volume of gross necrosis.<ref name='KimKim'/>

Grossly, the cut surfaces of these malignancies are often gray-white or tan, and frequently show myxoid, necrotic, and/or hemorrhagic foci.<ref name='KimKim'/> These sorts of areas often show low levels of contrast enhancement on [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] scanning.

Low encapsularity and high levels of tissue collagen tend to be observed, with high contrast enhancement in these areas.<ref name='KimKim'/>

GCCL have been seen to develop from/in [[emphysema]]tous [[bulla (dermatology)|bulla]]e.<ref name='ShirakusaSigematsu'>{{cite journal |author=Shirakusa T, Shigematsu N, Koga T, Yamagata Y |title=Giant cell carcinoma arising in a pulmonary bulla |journal=Scand J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=307–9 |year=1980 |pmid=7221506 }}</ref>

==Staining and immunohistochemistry==

GCCL cells often stain intensely by Periodic acid-Schiff reagent, suggesting the presence of significant amounts of glycogen in the cell [[cytoplasm]].<ref name='KennedyA'/>

==Differential diagnosis==
Under light [[microscope|microscopy]], the giant malignant pleomorphic cells making up a GCCL resemble those found in [[choriocarcinoma]],<ref name='who2004' /> angiosarcoma,<ref name='SpivachBorea'>{{cite journal |author=Spivach A, Borea B, Bertoli G, Daris G |title=[Primary lung neoplasm of rare incidence: giant cell carcinoma] |language=Italian |journal=Minerva Med. |volume=67 |issue=34 |pages=2233–49 |year=1976 |month=July |pmid=986035 }}</ref> and some forms of true [[sarcoma]],<ref name='who2004' /> such as malignant fibrous histiocytoma<ref name='who2004' /> and rhabdomyosarcoma.<ref name='DavidsonMcNicol'/> In some instances, they can also bear considerable resemblance to "activated" [[histiocyte]]s seen in some [[inflammation|inflammatory]] conditions.<ref name='DavidsonMcNicol'/>

A rare and potentially difficult differential diagnostic dilemma occurs when GCCL's must be separated from pulmonary or [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] [[choriocarcinomas]], a critical distinction to me made because while there is a known standard of care for treating choriocarcinoma, as yet there is no generally accepted specific standard treatment for GCCL. Careful review of cell morphology is key to their delineation — while GCCL's show great variation in cell size distributions and morphologies in tumors, choriocarcinomas consistently contain only [[syncytiotrophoblasts]] and [[cytotrophoblasts]].<ref name='Travis2010'>{{cite journal |author=Travis WD |title=Sarcomatoid neoplasms of the lung and pleura |journal=Arch.

==Sites of metastasis==
GCCLs are particularly notable among lung cancers for their extremely unusual tendency to metastasize to the [[small intestine]], occasionally causing [[Bowel obstruction|obstruction]], severe [[bleeding]], and/or [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]]. This clinical characteristic of GCCL has been seen in cases spanning over half a century in time.<ref name='Thomas1962'>{{cite journal |author=Thomas C |title=[Giant cell carcinoma of the lungs] |language=German |journal=Frankf Z Pathol |volume=72 |pages=302–8 |year=1962 |pmid=13981042 }}</ref><ref name='WellmanChafiian'>{{cite journal |author=Wellmann KF, Chafiian Y, Edelman E |title=Small bowel perforation from solitary metastasis of clinically undetected pulmonary giant cell carcinoma |journal=Am.

Within the small bowel, the jejunum seems to be a preferred site for metastasis of GCCL.

GCCL also often metastasizes to bone,<ref name='WillebrandWernitsch'/> adrenal, brain,<ref name='HagiharaAbe'/> lung, liver, kidney,

Brain metastases from GCCL are particularly likely to cause significant cerebral hemorrhages as compared to other lung cancer variants, probably due to greatly increased rates of endothelial proliferation and neovascularization, tumor tissue growth, extensive necrosis, and aggressive local infiltrative character of GCCL cells.<ref name='HagiharaAbe'/>

==Pathogenesis and genetics==
Several studies, both in giant cell tumor specimens and in cell lines, have identified rearrangement and amplification of the ''c-myc'' [[oncogene]], sometimes in combination with mutations of the ''K-ras'' gene.<ref name='IizukaShiraishi'>{{cite journal |author=Le Doussal JM, Gruaz-Guyon A, Martin M, Gautherot E, Delaage M, Barbet J |title=Targeting of indium 111-labeled bivalent hapten to human melanoma mediated by bispecific monoclonal antibody conjugates: imaging of tumors hosted in nude mice |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=50 |issue=11 |pages=3445–52 |year=1990 |month=June |pmid=2334941 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2334941}}</ref><ref name='TayaHosogai'>{{cite journal |author=Taya Y, Hosogai K, Hirohashi S, ''et al.'' |title=A novel combination of K-ras and myc amplification accompanied by point mutational activation of K-ras in a human lung cancer |journal=EMBO J. |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=2943–6 |year=1984 |month=December |pmid=6098458 |pmc=557793 }}</ref> 

Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to occur in GCCL and is thought to be related to the high metastatic potential of this lung cancer variant.<ref name='JiangLu'/>

Malignant giant cells identical to those found in GCCL commonly occur in lung cancer cases with a prominent major or minor clear cell carcinoma pattern (for a discussion about this variant, see for example<ref name='MorganMacKenzie'>{{cite journal |author=Morgan AD, Mackenzie DH |title=Clear-cell Carcinoma of the Lung |journal=J Pathol Bacteriol |volume=87 |pages=25–7 |year=1964 |month=January |pmid=14106350 }}</ref>). They have been hypothesized to derive from an undifferentiated [[multipotent]] malignant [[stem cell]] precursor that is generated in distal [[bronchiole]]s via an as yet unknown [[oncogenesis|oncogenetic]] [[metabolic pathway|pathway]] or [[oncogene|oncogenetic driver]].<ref name='WangSeemayer'/>

Ultrastructurally, malignant giant cells often contain accumulations of microfilaments arranged in whorls near the cell nucleus. These entities appear similar in structure to microfilaments and bundles found in the D1 cell of the gastro-entero-pancreatic [[endocrine]] system, and it has been proposed that these D1 cells may be the cancer stem cell for at least some GCCL's. Identically appearing whorled filament structures have also been produced in certain airway cells of animals after treatment with [[carcinogenic]] nitrosamines.<ref name='Carstens1978'>{{cite journal |author=Carstens PH, Broghamer WL |title=Duodenal carcinoid with cytoplasmic whorls of microfilaments |journal=J. Pathol. |volume=124 |issue=4 |pages=235–8 |year=1978 |month=April |pmid=569192 |doi=10.1002/path.1711240408 }}</ref>

Ultrastructural studies have suggested that the malignant giant cells in GCCL are of endodermal lineage.<ref name='Sidhu1979'>{{cite journal |author=Sidhu GS |title=The endodermal origin of digestive and respiratory tract APUD cells. Histopathologic evidence and a review of the literature |journal=Am. J. Pathol. |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=5–20 |year=1979 |month=July |pmid=37740 |pmc=2042351 }}</ref>

Remarkably fast growing tumors.<ref name='HagiharaAbe'/>

==Combined/multiphasic tumors containing giant cells==
Malignant giant cells are commonly found — and vary in relative proportion to a greater or lesser degree — in both primary tumors and metastatases of many different variants of lung carcinomas. A number of authors have noted that bizarre malignant giant cells occur more commonly in primary and secondary tumors — including any remaining tumor "deposits" — that have previously been treated with [[chemotherapy]] and/or [[radiation]] therapy in [[adjuvant]] or [[neoadjuvant therapy|neoadjuvant]] protocols.<ref name='Sidhu1979'/>

==Imaging characteristics==
GCCL often presents as a large peripheral mass that is severely cavitated.<ref name'Culiner'>{{cite journal |author=Culiner MM, Abouav J, Reich SB |title=Cavitary carcinoma of the lung |journal=Calif Med |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=355–8 |year=1958 |month=November |pmid=13585165 |pmc=1512515 }}</ref>

In a radiographic study of almost 2,000 lung cancer patients published 50 years ago, 3.4% of lung carcinomas proved to be cavitated masses,<ref name='Strang'>{{cite journal |author=Strang C, Simpson JA |title=Carcinomatous abscess of the lung |journal=Thorax |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=11–26 |year=1953 |month=March |pmid=13038734 |pmc=1019223 |url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13038734}}</ref> most of which were [[squamous cell carcinoma]].

In a number of cases of severe cavitation, the resected tumor remnant consists of only a thin rim of proliferating cells.

==Positron Emission Tomography scanning==
On [[Positron Emission Tomography]] scanning, GCCL has been found to have exceedingly high standardized uptake values (SUV) for radioactive glucose, values that are statistically significantly higher than in other histological variants of lung cancer.<ref name='ParkLee'/>

==Metabolic pathways==
PET scanning suggests that GCCL are tumors with particularly rapid metabolism, and that the metabolic pathways of GCCL may be unusually dependent on, or interlinked to, [[glycolysis]].<ref name='ParkLee' />

==Paraneoplastic syndromes==
GCCL have been long known<ref name='DaileyMarcuse'>{{cite journal |author=Dailey JE, Marcuse PM |title=Gonadotropin secreting giant cell carcinoma of the lung |journal=Cancer |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=388–96 |year=1969 |month=August |pmid=5796783 }}</ref> for secretion of the ''beta'' subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (''beta''-HCG), often in large amounts, which can lead to very high levels of [[estrogen]] and painful [[gynecomastia]] (breast enlargement) in males as paraneoplastic signs.<ref name='YaturuHarrara'>{{cite journal |author=Yaturu S, Harrara E, Nopajaroonsri C, Singal R, Gill S |title=Gynecomastia attributable to a human chorionic gonadotropin-secreting giant cell carcinoma of the lung |journal=Endocr Pract |year=2003 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=231–5 |pmid=12917067 }}</ref>

Giant cell lung cancers are well known for their paraneoplastic production and secretion of granulopoietic colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)<ref name='TayaHosogai'/><ref name='KamedaKodama'>{{cite book |author1=Kameda T |author2=Kodama T |author3=Shimosato Y |editor=Shimosato Y |editor2=Melamed MR |editor3=Nettesheim P |title=Morphogenesis of Lung Cancer |volume=2 |location=Boca Raton, Florida |publisher=CRC Press |pages=107–29 |year=1982 }}</ref>

GCCL has also been reported to produce plasminogen activator as a paraneoplastic phenomenon.<ref name='DavidsonMcNicol'/>

==Treatment==
Because of its rarity, there have been no randomized clinical trials of treatment of GCCL, and all information available derives from small retrospective institutional series or multicenter metadata.<ref name='BaeMin'>{{cite journal |author=Bae HM, Min HS, Lee SH, Kim DW, Chung DH, Lee JS, Kim YW, Heo DS |title=Palliative chemotherapy for pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma |journal=Lung Cancer |date=2007 Oct |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=112–5 |pmid=17574296 |doi=10.1016/j.lungcan.2007.05.006}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Giant cell lung cancers have long been considered to be exceptionally aggressive malignancies<ref name='KallenbergJaque' /><ref name='KennedyA'/><ref name='RazzukUrschel'>{{cite journal |author=Razzuk MA, Urschel HC, Albers JE, Martin JA, Paulson DL |title=Pulmonary giant cell carcinoma |journal=Ann. Thorac. Surg. |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |year=1976 |month=June |pmid=1275605 }}</ref> that grow very rapidly<ref name='TayaHosogai'/> and have a very poor prognosis.<ref name='ZhaoSong' />

Many small series have suggested that the prognosis of lung tumors with giant cells is worse than that of most other forms of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),<ref name='MatsuiKitagawa'/> including squamous cell carcinoma,<ref name='ZhaoSong' /> and spindle cell carcinoma.<ref name='ZhaoSong' />

The overall five-year survival rate in GCCL varies between studies but is generally considered to be very low. The (US) Armed Forces Institute of Pathology has reported a figure of 10%,<ref name='ColbyKoss'>{{cite book |author=Colby TV, Koss MN, Travis WD |chapter=Tumors of the lower respiratory tract |editor=Rosai J, Sobin LH |title=Atlas of Tumor Pathology |publisher=Armed Forces Institute of Pathology |location=Washington DC |year=1995 |pages=259–75 }}</ref> and in a study examining over 150,000 lung cancer cases, a figure of 11.8% was given.<ref name='TravisTravis'/> However, in the latter report the 11.8% figure was based on data that included [[spindle cell carcinoma]], a variant which is generally considered to have a less dismal prognosis that GCCL.<ref name='MatsuiKitagawa'/> Therefore, the likely survival of "pure" GCCL is probably lower than the stated figure.

In the large 1995 database review by Travis and colleagues, giant cell carcinoma was noted to have the third-worst prognosis among 18 histological forms of lung cancer (only small cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma had shorter average survival).<ref name='TravisTravis'/>

Most GCCL have already grown and invaded locally and/or regionally, and/or have already metastasized distantly, and are inoperable, at the time of diagnosis.<ref name='KennedyA'/>

==History==
Most sources credit Nash and Stout with publishing the first detailed report in the medical literature recognizing GCCL as a distinct clinicopathological entity in 1958.<ref name='NashStout'>{{cite journal |author=Nash AD, Stout AP |title=Giant cell carcinoma of the lung; report of 5 cases |journal=Cancer |year=1958 |volume=11 |pages=369–76}}</ref> However, there is some evidence that suggests this tumor [[phenotype]] was described as early as 1951.<ref name='Zaib'>{{cite journal |author=Naib ZM |title=Giant cell carcinoma of the lung: cytological study of the exfoliated cells in sputa and bronchial washings |journal=Dis Chest |year=1961 |volume=40 |pages=69–73}}</ref> In a report on 3 cases of giant cell lung carcinoma published in 1961 by Z.M.
