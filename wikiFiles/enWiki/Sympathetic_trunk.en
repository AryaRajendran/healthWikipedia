The '''sympathetic trunks''' ('''sympathetic chain''', '''gangliated cord''') are a paired bundle of nerve fibers that run from the base of the [[Human skull|skull]] to the [[coccyx]]. 

==Structure==
The sympathetic trunk travels in a downward direction from the skull, just lateral to the vertebral bodies.  It interacts with the [[spinal nerves]] or their ventral rami by way of [[rami communicantes]].

The superior end of it is continued upward through the [[carotid canal]] into the skull, and forms a [[plexus]] on the [[internal carotid artery]]; the inferior part travels in front of the [[coccyx]], where it converges with the other trunk at a structure known as the [[ganglion impar]].  

Along the length of the sympathetic trunk are [[ganglia]] known as [[paravertebral ganglia]].

==Function==
The sympathetic trunk is a fundamental part of the sympathetic division of the [[autonomic nervous system]].  It allows nerve fibers to travel to spinal nerves that are superior and inferior to the one in which they originated.  Also, a number of nerves, such as most of the [[splanchnic nerves]], arise directly from the trunks.
