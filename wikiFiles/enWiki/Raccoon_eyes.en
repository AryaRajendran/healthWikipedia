'''Raccoon eye/eyes''' (also known in the UK as '''panda eyes''') or '''periorbital ecchymosis''' is a [[medical sign|sign]] of [[basal skull fracture]], a [[craniotomy]] that ruptured the meninges, or (rarely) certain cancers.<ref>{{cite journal  | first = FA | last = Herbella | coauthors = Mudo M, Delmonti C, Braga FM, Del Grande JC | year = 2001 | month = December | title = 'Raccoon eyes' (periorbital haematoma) as a sign of skull base fracture | journal = Injury | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | pages = 745–7 | pmid = 11754879 | doi = 10.1016/S0020-1383(01)00144-9}}</ref><ref>EMT Prehospital Care (4th Edition)</ref> Bilateral subconjunctival [[hemorrhages|hemorrhage]] occurs when damage at the time of a  facial fracture tears the [[meninges]] and causes the venous sinuses to bleed into the [[arachnoid villi]] and the cranial sinuses. In layman's terms, blood from skull fracture seeps into the soft tissue around the eyes. Raccoon eyes may be accompanied by [[Battle's sign]], an [[ecchymosis]] behind the ear. These signs may be the only sign of a skull fracture, as it may not show on an X-ray. They may not appear until up 2–3 days after the injury.<ref>Handbook of Signs & Symptoms (Third Edition)</ref> It is recommended that the patient not blow their nose, cough vigorously, or strain to prevent further tearing of the meninges.<ref>Nursing: Interpreting Signs and Symptoms</ref>

Racoon eyes may be bilateral or unilateral. <ref>Skull fractures. Step-by-step diagnostic approach. Best Practice, BMJ. http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/398/diagnosis/step-by-step.html</ref> If bilateral, it is highly suggestive of basilar skull fracture, with a positive predictive value of 85%. Most often associated with fractures of the anterior cranial fossa. <ref>http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/398/diagnosis.html</ref><ref>Visual Diagnosis in Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Christopher P.

Raccoon eyes may also be a sign of disseminated [[neuroblastoma]]<ref name="pmid17534581">{{cite journal |author=Gumus K |title=A child with raccoon eyes masquerading as trauma |journal=[[Int Ophthalmol]] |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=379–81 |year=2007 |pmid=17534581 |doi=10.1007/s10792-007-9089-y}}</ref> or of [[amyloidosis]] ([[multiple myeloma]]). It can also be a side effect of using cocaine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} 

Depending on cause, raccoon eyes always require urgent consultation and management, that is [[surgery|surgical]] (facial fracture or post-craniotomy) or [[medicine|medical]] (neuroblastoma or amyloidosis).
