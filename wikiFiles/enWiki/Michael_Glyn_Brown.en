==History==
Brown was born in [[Galena Park, Texas]]. In middle school he saw a film of [[Michael DeBakey]] performing heart surgery. He wanted to be a heart surgeon, but he said that he ultimately became a hand surgeon because the practice allowed for greater creativity and was "more challenging."<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/> In 1975 he graduated from [[Galena Park High School]] with honors. For his undergraduate studies he attended the Southwest Texas State University (now [[Texas State University–San Marcos]]), where he received a [[grade point average]] of 3.97.<ref name="Malislow2">Malislow, Craig.

Retrieved on November 20, 2011.</ref> He then attended and graduated from the [[Baylor College of Medicine]].<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/> He received his medical license in 1983. Brown did surgical training in a hospital in [[Stockton, California]]. In 1988 he founded the Brown Hand Center.<ref name="Malislow2"/> Until a time before 2002, Brown made $2.5 million annually from his business. He had a residence in the East Wedgwood Glen of [[The Woodlands, Texas|The Woodlands]].<ref name="Fleckgooddoc1">Fleck, Tim. "The Good Doctor." ''[[Houston Press]]''. Thursday, January 24, 2002.

Todd Ackerman of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' said that Brown's popularity as a hand surgeon was often attributed to the "patented Brown technique" of [[carpal tunnel]] surgery, an [[endoscopic surgery]] for the wrist.<ref name="Ackermanimage2">Ackerman, Todd. "Troubles belie Houston hand doc's family-man image." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Monday September 6, 2010. [http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Troubles-belie-Houston-hand-doc-s-family-man-image-1717453.php#page-2 2]. Retrieved on November 20, 2011.</ref> The Brown Hand Center advertisements and website credited him with inventing the technique. The materials contrast the Brown technique with more traditional surgery, which requires stitches. Dr. Robert Szabo, the president of the [[American Society for Surgery of the Hand]] and the chief hand surgeon of the [[University of California-Davis]] School of Medicine, said that Brown's business has "nothing unique" "in regards to the surgeries they perform or helping hand patients generally."<ref name="Ackermanimage2"/> Ackerman said that Szabo and other orthopedic surgeons say that Brown's claim to a special technique is based on the fact that he patented his own surgical instruments.<ref name="Ackermanimage2"/> They said that Brown's instruments are very similar to instruments used by other hand surgeons.<ref name="Ackermanimage2"/>

In Houston Brown was well known for starring in television advertisements that show him with Sophie, his baby daughter.<ref name="Fleckgooddoc1"/> Ackerman said that Brown "made a lucrative business by portraying himself as a medical pioneer dedicated to principles of family, compassion and kindness" and that he had a "family-man image".<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/> Ackerman added that "But in reality, he appears possessed by personal demons — drugs, sex, violence — that have threatened his professional career and destroyed his family life."<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/>

In 2002 the [[Texas Medical Board]] placed Brown on probation due to "concerns he had an alcohol or chemical dependency" and for beating Darlina Barone, his third wife.<ref name="Ackermanimage2"/> In 2002 he had been charged with and convicted of beating her.<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/>

In 2006, after Brown tested positive for [[cocaine]], the Texas Medical Board revoked his license to practice medicine.<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/>

In 2008 Brown received the [[Republican Congressional Medal of Distinction]]. As part of the award he had a dinner with [[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] and a lunch with [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Dick Cheney]]. In 2010 he threw the first pitch at a [[Houston Astros]] game. Ackerman said that the marital and drug use controversies did not "put a damper on Brown's favor among the powerful."<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/>

In September, 2011, after a week long trial, Brown was acquitted of felony assault of Rachael Brown, his fourth wife.<ref>Rogers, Brian.

==Brown Hand Center==
As of 2010 the Brown Hand Center has locations in [[Houston]], [[Dallas]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. In 2010 Ackerman said "For all of Brown's troubles, his business continues to thrive."<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/> One of Barone's divorce attorneys said in September 2010 that his businesses were expected to gross about $45 million in a 12 month period afterwards. Tommy Fibich, a law attorney, said that the projected figure is higher than the $15 and $30 million annual grosses that the business had in approximately five years.<ref name="Ackermanimage1"/> As of 2010 the Brown Hand Center advertising promotes Brown's medical background and mentions that he has a medical degree, but Ackerman said that the advertisements "stop short of identifying him as a practicing doctor"<ref name="Ackermanimage2"/> The advertisements say that Brown trained the doctors who work at the clinic and had been "retired."<ref name="Ackermanimage2"/> Seth Chandler, a [[University of Houston]] professor of law, assessed whether the advertisements violate the Texas Medical Practice Act. Chandler concluded that "It's a close call. The ads are misleading, but I don't see a slam dunk for anyone looking to prosecute."<ref name="Ackermanimage2"/>
