==Policies==
===Major League Baseball===
[[Major League Baseball]]'s policy was first started in 2007, and injured players are examined by a team athletic trainer on the field.<ref name=USAToday>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/2011-04-12-nba-concussions_N.htm |title=Concussions now a hot issue as leagues toughen policies |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> On March 29, 2011, MLB and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] announced that they have created various protocols for the league's concussion policy.

* The SCAT2 (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, version 2) has been adopted as the official sideline concussion assessment tool of the league, even though various teams have already adopted this tool.
* The establishment of the 7-day disabled list for players with concussions. Players who have been on the list for 14 days are to be transferred to the 15-day list.<ref name=USATodayMLB />
* Any player who has been diagnosed with a concussion, regardless of being placed on the disabled list, must have his team submit a return-to-play form to the league's medical director to in order for that player to be cleared to play.

===National Basketball Association===
The [[National Basketball Association]] does not have a policy, and team procedures after concussions vary by team.<ref name=USAToday />

===National Football League===
{{main|Concussions in American football}}
The [[National Football League]]'s policy was first started in 2007, and injured players are examined on field by the medical team.<ref name=USAToday /> The league's policy included the "NFL Sidelines Concussion Exam", which requires players who have taken [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|hits to the head]] to perform tests concerning concentration, thinking and balance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/25/new-nfl-concussion-policy-waiting-on-approval/ |title=NFL to require sideline test after head blows – - CNN.com Blogs |publisher=Thechart.blogs.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> In 2011, the league introduced an assessment test, which combines a symptoms checklist, a limited neurological examination, a cognitive evaluation, and a balance assessment.

===National Hockey League===
The [[National Hockey League]]'s concussion policy began in 1997, and players who sustain concussions are evaluated by a team doctor in a quiet room.<ref name=USAToday /> In March of 2011, the NHL adopted guidelines for the league's concussion policy. Before the adoptions, examinations on the bench for concussions was the minimum requirement, but the new guidelines make it mandatory for players showing concussion-like symptoms to be examined by a doctor in the locker room.<ref name=ESPNNHL>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=6411004 |title=NHL commissioner Gary Bettman pleased with league's concussion protocol - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-04-23 |accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref>

==Concussions in other sports==
===Association football===
[[Association football]]—while not as severe as [[American football]]—has also been one of the major sports to have concussions. Even though 50-80% of injuries in football are to the legs, head injuries have been shown to account for between 4 and 22% of football injuries, with a possibility that heading the ball could damage the head, as the ball could travel at 100 km/hour. However, most professional football players reported that they experienced head injuries from colliding with other players and the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/soccer.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids - Soccer |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> A [[Norway|Norwegian]] study consisting of current and former players of the [[Norway national football team]] found out that 3% of the active and 30% of the former players had persistent symptoms of concussions, and that 35% of the active and 32% of that former players had abnormal [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG).<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439395?dopt=Abstract |title=Head and neck injuries in soccer.

===American football===
{{main|Concussions in American football}}
American football has been known to have the most concussions out of any other sport in the United States, with over 250,000 injuries reported annually in football players, with 20% of high-school football players experiencing a concussion every year.<ref>{{cite web|author=SMH |url=http://www.hughston.com/hha/a_12_2_3.htm |title=Sport-Related Concussion |publisher=Hughston.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> In 2000, researchers from the Sports Medicine Research Laboratory at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] analyzed 17,549 players from 242 different school. Research eventually revealed that 888 (5.1%) of the players analyzed have at least one concussion a season, and 131 (14.7%) of them have had another concussion the year later. [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] and high-school players have a higher tendecy to sustain a concussion than [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] and [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/concuss.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids - Football Concussions |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> In {{NFL Year|2001}}, the [[National Football League Players Association]] partnered with the UNC to determine whether professional football players suffer any health effects after any injuries, with the findings being criticized by the NFL for being unreliable due to being based on self-reporting by the players.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hadhazy |first=Adam |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=football-concussions-felt-long-after-retirement |title=Concussions Exact Toll on Football Players Long After They Retire |publisher=Scientific American |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>

===Auto racing===
The [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|death]] of [[Dale Earnhardt]] at the [[2001 Daytona 500]], along with [[Kenny Irwin]], [[Adam Petty]] and [[Tony Roper (racing driver)|Tony Roper]], and serious injuries sustained by [[Steve Park]] in a wreck in September 2001 at Darlington,  led to NASCAR creating various protocols to aid in driver safety, such as the introduction of the [[Car of Tomorrow]]. Drivers were eventually instructed to wear head and neck restraints, and SAFER barriers have been installed on racetrack walls, with foam-padded supports on each side of the helmet that would allow a driver's head to move in the event of a crash. Despite this, 29 concussions have been identified since [[2004 in NASCAR|2004]], and 12 of them have happened since [[2007 in NASCAR|2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/racing/news/20120221/nascar-concussions/ |title=NASCAR drivers have concussion concerns - Racing - SI.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> 

In 2012, when [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] suffered a concussion after being involved in a crash at Talladega in October, NASCAR expressed consideration in adding baseline testing to its concussion policies. NASCAR is one of few motorsport organizations that do not have baseline testing.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bandoim |first=Lana |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nascar-may-considering-changes-concussion-policies-fan-view-103700708--nascar.html |title=NASCAR May Be Considering Changes to Its Concussion Policies: Fan View |publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]] |date= |accessdate=2012-10-21}}</ref>

===Basketball===
In the 2005 high school [[basketball]] year, 3.6% of reported injuries were concussions, with 30.5% of activity report when a concussion occurred being rebounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/basketball-92782-becoming-concern.html |title=Concussions becoming a concern in basketball &#124; basketball, becoming, concern - Sports - Colorado Springs Gazette, CO |publisher=Gazette.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>

===Boxing===
Despite [[boxing]]'s violent nature, a [[National Safety Council]] report in 1996 ranked amateur boxing as the safest contact sport in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxing.isport.com/boxing-guides/concussions-in-boxing |title=Concussions in Boxing &#124; iSport.com |publisher=Boxing.isport.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> However, concussions are one the most serious injuries that can occur from boxing, and in an 80-year span from 1918 to 1998, there were 659 boxers who died from brain injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/story/health/story/2011-08-29/Pediatricians-urge-parents-to-keep-kids-away-from-boxing-ring-head-injuries/50177078/1 |title=– |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>

===Ice hockey===
[[Ice hockey]] has also been known to have concussions inflict various players. Because of this, the NHL made [[hockey helmet]]s mandatory in the [[1979–80 NHL season]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Stubbs |first=Dave |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Dave+Stubbs+Pacioretty+richly+deserves+Masterton+trophy/6801101/story.html |title=Dave Stubbs: Max Pacioretty richly deserves Masterton trophy |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> According to a data release by the National Academy of [[Neuropsychology]]'s Sports Concussion Symposium, from 2006 to 2011, 759 NHL players have been diagnosed with a concussion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/3039-bigger-hockey-players-causing-concussions.html |title=Bigger Hockey Players Causing More Concussions |publisher=LiveScience |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> At the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center Ice Hockey Summit: Action on Concussion conference in 2010, a panel made a recommendation that blows to the head are to be prohibited, and to outlaw [[checking (ice hockey)|body checking]] by 11- and 12-year olds. For the [[2010–11 NHL season]], the NHL prohibited blindside hits to the head, but did not ban hits to the face. The conference also urged the NHL and its minor entities to join the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA]] and the [[Ontario Hockey League]] in banning any contact to the head.<ref>{{cite news|last=Klein |first=Jeff |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/sports/hockey/21concussions.html |title=Hockey Urged to Ban All Blows to Head by Concussions Panel |date=2010-10-20 |accessdate= |publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Rugby union===
Concussions are also a significant factor in [[rugby union]], another full-contact sport. The sport's world governing body, the [[International Rugby Board]], has issued a highly detailed policy for dealing with injured players with suspected concussions. Under no circumstances is a player suffering from a suspected concussion allowed to return to play in that game. Players are not cleared to play after the injury for a minimum of 21 days, unless they are being supervised in their recovery by a medical practitioner. Even when medical advice is present, players must complete a multi-step monitoring process before being cleared to play again; this process requires a minimum of six days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irbplayerwelfare.com/?documentid=3 |title=IRB Concussion Guidelines |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref>

==Female sports==
Various reports have stated that [[women's sports|female athletes]] sustain more concussions than their male counterparts. A December 2008 report states that 29,167 female high school soccer players suffered from concussions in 2005, compared to 20,929 male players. In high school basketball, 12,923 girls suffered from concussions while only 3,823 boys did. Girls also sustained more concussions in softball, compared to boys in baseball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=75789 |title=High school headaches: Girls' concussions outnumber boys' in most sports |publisher=News.medill.northwestern.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> Female athletes also had longer recovery times than males, and also had lower scores on visual memory tests. One of the possibles reasons that are suggested by various researchers as to why girls have longer recovery times include the possibility that the greater rate of blood flow in the brain for females might have affected the recovery times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20120511/concussions-girls-have-longer-recovery-time |title=Concussions: Girls Have Longer Recovery Time |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>

Women's ice hockey was reported as one of the most dangerous sports in the NCAA, as the concussion rate is 2.72 per 1,000 player hours. Even though men's ice hockey allows body checking, which is illegal in the women's game, the rate of concussions for men is 46% lower, at 1.47 per 1,000 player hours.Women’s basketball is one of the top women’s sports with the highest risks of getting a concussion.  With high competition comes a higher risk of injuries. College level sports can be very physical, especially women’s basketball (The Epidemiology).  Concussions are associated with different activities. For women, they have a greater risk of getting a concussion by dribbling/ball handling rather than defending. Also it was found that female college basketball players typically receive concussions during games rather than practices. The reasoning for this could be that they are competing at a higher level, and are more aggressive in games than practices. Not only just in concussions, but for overall injuries (The Epidemiology)."The Epidemiology of Sport-Related Concussion." Clin Sports Med, 1 Jan. 2012. Web. 8 Feb. 2013.  [[College football]] also has lower concussion rates than women's hockey, with a rate of 2.34 per 1,000.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klein |first=Jeff Z. |url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/at-the-mayo-clinic-womens-hockey-a-most-dangerous-game/ |title=Women's Hockey, a Most Dangerous Game - NYTimes.com |publisher=Slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>

==Prevention efforts==
There have been several attempts at preventing concussions, such as the establishment of the [http://www.dsgpace.org/ PACE (Protecting Athletes Through Concussion Education) Program], which works with the imPACT system, which is currently used by every NFL and some NHL teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/06/26/drew-brees-teams-up-against-concussions-in-school-sports/ |title=Drew Brees Teams Up Against Concussions in School Sports - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> In 2008, the [[Arena Football League]] tested a device created by [[Schutt Sports]] called the "Shockometer", which is a triangular device attached to the back of [[football helmet]]s that has a light on the device that turns red when a concussion occurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt%e2%80%99s-Shockometer/ |title=AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt’S-Shockometer / News |publisher=NFLPlayers.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref> [[Riddell]] has also created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to record the frequency and severity of player hits during practices and games. On every helmet with the system, MX Encoders are implemented, which can automatically record every hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riddell.com/innovation/hits-technology/ |title=HITS™ Technology |publisher=Riddell |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref> Eight NFL teams had originally planned to use the system in the {{NFL Year|2010}} season, but the [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]] ultimately blocked its use.<ref name=HITS>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/24/failure-to-use-hit-system-exposes-league-to-future-concussion-liability/ |title=Failure to use HIT system exposes league to future concussion liability &#124; ProFootballTalk |publisher=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref>

In 2012, film producer [[Steve James (producer)|Steve James]] created the documentary film ''[http://headgamesthefilm.com/ Head Games]'', interviewing former NHL player [[Keith Primeau]], and the parents of Owen Thomas, who hung himself after sustaining brain damage during his football career at [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://athleticbusiness.com/articles/lexisnexis.aspx?lnarticleid=1679642947&lntopicid=136030023 |title='Head Games' Film Focuses on Concussions, Asks If Enough is Being Done |publisher=Athleticbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> The documentary also interviewed former athletes [[Christopher Nowinski]], [[Cindy Parlow]], and ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporter [[Alan Schwarz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headgamesthefilm.com/people/ |title=Head Games: The People |publisher=Headgamesthefilm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref>
