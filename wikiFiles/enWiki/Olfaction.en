'''Olfaction''' or '''olfactory perception'''<ref>Also known as '''olfactics'''; [[adjectival form]]: "olfactory".</ref> is the [[sense]] of '''smell'''. This sense is mediated by specialized sensory cells of the nasal cavity of vertebrates, which can be considered analogous to sensory cells of the antennae of invertebrates. In humans, olfaction occurs when odorant molecules bind to specific sites on the olfactory receptors. These receptors are used to detect the presence of smell. They come together at what is called the glomerulus. The glomerulus is a structure that transmits signals to the olfactory bulb (a brain structure located directly above the nasal cavity  and below the frontal lobe).<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Sensation and Perception | author = Charles Linsmeiser | title = Psychology | author = Daniel Schacter, Daniel Gilbert, Daniel Wegner | publisher = Worth Publishers | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4292-3719-2 | page = 166-171 }}</ref>  Many vertebrates, including most mammals and reptiles, have two distinct olfactory systems—the main olfactory system, and the accessory olfactory system (used mainly to detect pheromones).

==Study of olfaction==
[[File:The Lady and the unicorn Smell.jpg|thumb|''[[The Lady and the Unicorn]]'' a Flemish tapestry depicting the smell]]

As the Epicurean and atomistic Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]] (1st Century BCE) speculated, different odors are attributed to different shapes and sizes of odor molecules that stimulate the olfactory organ. A modern demonstration of that theory was the cloning of [[olfactory receptor]] proteins by [[Linda B. Buck]] and [[Richard Axel]] (who were awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 2004), and subsequent pairing of odor molecules to specific receptor proteins. Each odor receptor molecule recognizes only a particular molecular feature or class of odor molecules.  [[Mammals]] have about a thousand [[gene]]s that code for [[Olfactory receptors|odor reception]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buck L, Axel R |title=A novel multigene family may encode odorant receptors: a molecular basis for odor recognition |journal=Cell |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=175–87 |year=1991 |month=April |pmid=1840504 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90418-X |url=}}</ref> Of the genes that code for odor receptors, only a portion are functional.

In mammals, each [[olfactory receptor neuron]] expresses only one functional odor receptor.<ref>Pinel, John P.J. (2006) Biopsychology. Pearson Education Inc. ISBN 0-205-42651-4 (page 178)</ref> Odor receptor nerve cells function like a key-lock system: If the airborne molecules of a certain chemical can fit into the lock, the nerve cell will respond. There are, at present, a number of competing theories regarding the mechanism of odor coding and perception. According to the [[Shape theory of olfaction|shape theory]], each receptor detects a feature of the odor [[molecule]]. Weak-shape theory, known as [[odotope theory]], suggests that different receptors detect only small pieces of molecules, and these minimal inputs are combined to form a larger olfactory perception (similar to the way visual perception is built up of smaller, information-poor sensations, combined and refined to create a detailed overall perception).{{cn|date=March 2013}} An alternative theory, the [[vibration theory]] proposed by [[Luca Turin]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turin L |title=A spectroscopic mechanism for primary olfactory reception |journal=Chemical senses |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=773–91 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8985605 |doi= 10.1093/chemse/21.6.773|url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8985605}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Turin L |title=A method for the calculation of odor character from molecular structure |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=216 |issue=3 |pages=367–85 |year=2002 |month=June |pmid=12183125 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2001.2504 |url=}}</ref> posits that odor receptors detect the frequencies of vibrations of odor molecules in the infrared range by [[quantum tunneling|electron tunnelling]].

==Main olfactory system==
In [[vertebrate]]s smells are sensed by [[olfactory sensory neuron]]s in the [[olfactory epithelium]].  The olfactory epithelium is made up of at least six morphologically and biochemically different cell types. <ref>Doty, R. L. (2001). Olfaction. 425. Retrieved from http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/9139085232678633444.pdf</ref>The proportion of olfactory [[epithelium]] compared to respiratory epithelium (not innervated) gives an indication of the animal's olfactory sensitivity.  Humans have about {{convert|10|cm2|abbr=on}} of olfactory epithelium, whereas some dogs have {{convert|170|cm2|abbr=on}}.  A dog's olfactory epithelium is also considerably more densely innervated, with a hundred times more receptors per square centimetre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bear, Connors and Paradiso|first=Mark, Barry and Michael|title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=USA|pages=265–275}}</ref>

Molecules of odorants passing through the [[superior nasal concha]] of the nasal passages dissolve in the [[mucus]] lining the superior portion of the cavity and are detected by [[olfactory receptor]]s on the [[dendrites]] of the olfactory sensory neurons. This may occur by diffusion or by the binding of the odorant to [[odorant binding protein]]s.  The mucus overlying the epithelium contains [[mucopolysaccharides]], salts, [[enzymes]], and [[antibodies]] (these are highly important, as the olfactory neurons provide a direct passage for infection to pass to the [[brain]]). This mucus acts as a solvent for odor molecules, flows constantly and is replaced approximately every 10 minutes. 

In [[insect]]s smells are sensed by [[olfactory sensory neuron]]s in the chemosensory [[sensilla]], which are present in insect antenna, palps and tarsa, but also on other parts of the insect body. Odorants penetrate into the cuticle pores of chemosensory sensilla and get in contact with insect [[Odorant-binding protein]]s (OBPs) or [[Chemosensory protein]]s (CSPs), before activating the sensory neurons.

===Receptor neuron===
The binding of the [[ligand]] (odor molecule or odorant) to the receptor leads to an [[action potential]] in the receptor neuron, via a [[second messenger]] pathway, depending on the organism. In mammals, the odorants stimulate [[adenylate cyclase]] to synthesize [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|CAMP]] via a [[G protein]] called G<sub>olf</sub>. CAMP, which is the second messenger here, opens a [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]] (CNG), producing an influx of [[cation]]s (largely [[Calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>  with some [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>) into the cell, slightly depolarising it. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> in turn opens a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated [[chloride channel]], leading to efflux of [[chlorine|Cl]]<sup>-</sup>, further depolarising the cell and triggering an [[action potential]]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is then extruded through a [[sodium-calcium exchanger]].  A calcium-[[calmodulin]] complex also acts to inhibit the binding of CAMP to the CAMP-dependent channel, thus contributing to olfactory adaptation.'''
This mechanism of transduction is somewhat unique, in that CAMP works by directly binding to the [[ion channel]] rather than through activation of [[protein kinase A]].  It is similar to the transduction mechanism for [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s, in which the second messenger [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]] works by directly binding to ion channels, suggesting that maybe one of these receptors was evolutionarily adapted into the other.  There are also considerable similarities in the immediate processing of stimuli by [[lateral inhibition]].
Averaged activity of the receptor neurons can be measured in several ways. In vertebrates, responses to an odor can be measured by an [[electro-olfactogram]] or through calcium imaging of receptor neuron terminals in the olfactory bulb. In insects, one can perform [[electroantenogram]] or also calcium imaging within the olfactory bulb.

===Olfactory bulb projections===
[[File:Early Olfactory System.svg|right|300px|alt=Early Olfactory System|Schematic of the early olfactory system including the olfactory epithelium and bulb. Each ORN expresses one OR that responds to different odorants. Odorant molecules bind to ORs on cilia. ORs activate ORNs that transduce the input signal into action potentials. In general, glomeruli receive input from ORs of one specific type and connect to the principal neurons of the OB, mitral and tufted cells (MT cells).]]
Olfactory sensory neurons project [[axon]]s to the brain within the [[olfactory nerve]], ([[cranial nerve]] I).  These nerve fibers, lacking [[myelin]] sheaths, pass to the [[olfactory bulb]] of the brain through perforations in the [[cribriform plate]], which in turn projects olfactory information to the [[olfactory cortex]] and other areas.<ref>Morris, H., & Schaeffer, J. P. (1953). The Nervous system-The Brain or Encephalon. Human anatomy; a complete systematic treatise. (11th ed., pp.1218-1219). New York: Blakiston.</ref> The axons from the [[olfactory receptor]]s converge in the outer layer of the [[olfactory bulb]] within small (~50 [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] in diameter) structures called [[glomerulus (olfaction)|glomeruli]]. [[Mitral cell]]s, located in the inner layer of the olfactory bulb, form synapses with the axons of the sensory neurons within glomeruli and send the information about the [[odor]] to other parts of the olfactory system, where multiple signals may be processed to form a synthesized olfactory perception.  A large degree of convergence occurs, with twenty-five thousand axons synapsing on twenty-five or so mitral cells, and with each of these mitral cells projecting to multiple glomeruli.  Mitral cells also project to [[periglomerular cell]]s and [[granule cell|granular cell]]s that inhibit the mitral cells surrounding it ([[lateral inhibition]]).  Granular cells also mediate inhibition and excitation of mitral cells through pathways from centrifugal fibers and the anterior olfactory nuclei.

The mitral cells leave the olfactory bulb in the [[lateral olfactory tract]], which synapses on five major regions of the cerebrum: the [[anterior olfactory nucleus]], the [[olfactory tubercle]], the [[amygdala]], the [[piriform cortex]], and the [[entorhinal cortex]].  The anterior olfactory nucleus projects, via the [[anterior commissure]], to the contralateral olfactory bulb, inhibiting it.  The piriform cortex has two major divisions with anatomically distinct organizations and functions. The anterior piriform cortex (APC) is better associated with determining the chemical structure of the odorant molecules and whereas the posterior piriform cortex (PPC) is best known for its strong role in categorizing odors and assessing similarities between odors (e.g. minty, woody, citrus are odors which can be distinguished via the PPC despite being highly-variant chemicals and in a concentration-independent manner).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Margot C |title=A noseful of objects |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=813–4 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19554043 |doi=10.1038/nn0709-813 |url=}}</ref> The piriform cortex projects to the [[medial dorsal nucleus]] of the thalamus, which then projects to the orbitofrontal cortex.  The orbitofrontal cortex mediates conscious perception of the odor.  The 3-layered piriform cortex projects to a number of thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, the hippocampus and amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex but its function is largely unknown.  The entorhinal cortex projects to the [[amygdala]] and is involved in emotional and autonomic responses to odor.  It also projects to the hippocampus and is involved in motivation and memory.  Odor information is stored in [[long-term memory]] and has strong connections to [[emotional memory]]. This is possibly due to the olfactory system's close anatomical ties to the [[limbic system]] and [[hippocampus]], areas of the brain that have long been known to be involved in emotion and place memory, respectively.

Since any one receptor is responsive to various odorants, and there is a great deal of convergence at the level of the olfactory bulb, it seems strange that human beings are able to distinguish so many different odors.  It seems that there must be a highly-complex form of processing occurring; however, as it can be shown that, while many neurons in the olfactory bulb (and even the pyriform cortex and amygdala) are responsive to many different odors, half the neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex are responsive to only one odor, and the rest to only a few.  It has been shown through microelectrode studies that each individual odor gives a particular specific spatial map of excitation in the olfactory bulb.  It is possible that, through spatial encoding, the brain is able to distinguish specific odors.  However, temporal coding must be taken into account.  Over time, the spatial maps change, even for one particular odor, and the brain must be able to process these details as well.

Inputs from the two [[nostril]]s have separate inputs to the brain with the result that it is possible for humans to experience perceptual rivalry in the olfactory sense akin to that of [[binocular rivalry]] when there are two different inputs into the two nostrils.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zhou W, Chen D | year = 2009 | title = Binaral rivalry between the nostrils and in the cortex | url = | journal = Curr Biol | volume = 19 | issue = 18| pages = 1561–5 | pmid = 19699095 | pmc = 2901510 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.07.052}}</ref>

In [[insect]]s smells are sensed by sensilla located on the antenna and maxillary palp and first processed by the [[antennal lobe]] (analogous to the [[olfactory bulb]]), and next by the mushroom bodies and lateral horn.

==Accessory olfactory system==
Many animals, including most mammals and reptiles, but not humans, have two distinct and segregated olfactory systems: a main olfactory system, which detects volatile stimuli, and an accessory olfactory system, which detects fluid-phase stimuli. Behavioral evidence suggests that these fluid-phase stimuli often function as [[pheromone]]s, although pheromones can also be detected by the main olfactory system.   In the accessory olfactory system, stimuli are detected by the [[vomeronasal organ]], located in the vomer, between the [[nose]] and the [[mouth]]. Snakes use it to smell prey, sticking their tongue out and touching it to the organ. Some mammals make a facial expression called [[flehmen]] to direct stimuli to this organ.

The sensory receptors of the accessory olfactory system are located in the [[vomeronasal organ]].  As in the main olfactory system, the axons of these sensory neurons project from the vomeronasal organ to the [[Olfactory bulb#Accessory olfactory bulb|accessory olfactory bulb]], which in the mouse is located on the dorsal-posterior portion of the main [[olfactory bulb]].  Unlike in the main olfactory system, the axons that leave the accessory olfactory bulb do not project to the brain's cortex but rather to targets in the [[amygdala]] and [[bed nucleus of the stria terminalis]], and from there to the [[hypothalamus]], where they may influence aggressive and mating behavior.

==Human olfactory system==

In women, the sense of olfaction is strongest around the time of [[ovulation]], significantly stronger than during other phases of the [[menstrual cycle]] and also stronger than the sense in males.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Navarrete-Palacios E, Hudson R, Reyes-Guerrero G, Guevara-Guzmán R |title=Lower olfactory threshold during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=269–79 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12853171 |doi=10.1016/S0301-0511(03)00076-0 |url=}}</ref>

The [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] genes (known as [[human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] in humans) are a group of genes present in many animals and important for the [[immune system]]; in general, offspring from parents with differing MHC genes have a stronger immune system.

==Olfactory coding and perception==
How olfactory information is coded in the brain to allow for proper perception is still being researched and the process is not completely understood.  However, what is known is that the chemical nature of the odorant is particularly important, as there may be a chemotopic map in the brain; this map would show specific activation patterns for specific odorants.  When an odorant is detected by receptors, the receptors in a sense break the odorant down and then the brain puts the odorant back together for identification and perception.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11418503 | volume=26 | issue=5 | journal = Chemical senses | year=2001 | title = Receptive fields in the rat piriform cortex. | month=June | pages=577–84 | author=Wilson DA}}</ref>  The odorant binds to receptors which only recognize a specific functional group, or feature, of the odorant, which is why the chemical nature of the odorant is important.<ref name= Leon>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(03)00142-5 | author = Leon M., Johnson B.A. | year = 2003 | title = Olfactory coding in the mammalian olfactory bulb | url = | journal = Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 23–32 | pmid = 12668289 }}</ref>

After binding the odorant, the receptor is activated and will send a signal to the glomeruli.<ref name = Leon/>  Each glomerulus receives signals from multiple receptors that detect similar odorant features.  Because multiple receptor types are activated due to the different chemical features of the odorant, multiple glomeruli will be activated as well.  All of the signals from the glomeruli will then be sent to the brain, where the combination of glomeruli activation will encode the different chemical features of the odorant.  The brain will then essentially put the pieces of the activation pattern back together in order to identify and perceive the odorant.<ref name = Leon/>

Odorants that are similar in structure activate similar patterns of glomeruli, which lead to a similar perception in the brain.<ref name=Leon/><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10861522 | volume=422 | issue=4 | journal = The Journal of comparative neurology | year=2000 | title = Modular representations of odorants in the glomerular layer of the rat olfactory bulb and the effects of stimulus concentration. | month=July | pages=496–509 | author=Johnson BA, Leon M | doi = 10.1002/1096-9861(20000710)422:4<496::AID-CNE2>3.0.CO;2-4}}</ref>  Data from animal models, suggest that the brain may have a chemotopic map.  A chemotopic map is an area in the brain, to be specific the olfactory bulb, in which glomeruli project their signals onto the brain in a specific pattern.  The idea of the chemotopic map has been supported by the observation that chemicals containing similar functional groups have similar responses with overlapped areas in the brain.  This is important because it allows the possibility to predict the neural activation pattern from an odorant and vice versa.<ref name = Leon/>

==Interactions of olfaction with other senses==
===Olfaction and taste===
Olfaction, [[taste]] and [[trigeminal nerve|trigeminal]] receptors (also called  [[Chemesthesis]]) together contribute to [[flavor]]. The human [[tongue]] can distinguish only among five distinct qualities of [[taste]], while the nose can distinguish among hundreds of substances, even in minute quantities. It is during [[exhalation]] that the olfaction contribution to [[flavor]] occurs, in contrast to that of proper smell, which occurs during  the [[inhalation]] phase.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Masaoka Y, Satoh H, Akai L, Homma I | year = 2010 | title = Expiration: The moment we experience retronasal olfaction in flavor | url = | journal = Neurosci Lett. | volume = 473 | issue = 2| pages = 92–96 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.02.024 | pmid = 20171264 }}</ref> The neurons of the olfactory system is the only one of the human senses that bypasses the thalamus and connects directly to the forebrain<ref name="Olfaction"> Annual Review of Psychology (February 2001), 52 (1), pg. 423-452,Richard L.

==Disorders of olfaction==
The following are disorders of olfaction:<ref>Hirsch, Alan R. (2003) Life's a Smelling Success</ref>

*[[Anosmia]] – inability to smell
*[[Dysosmia]] – things smell different than they should
*[[Hyperosmia]] – an abnormally acute sense of smell.
*[[Hyposmia]] – decreased ability to smell
*[[Olfactory Reference Syndrome]] – psychological disorder which causes the patient to imagine he or she has strong [[body odor]]
*[[Parosmia]] – things smell worse than they should<ref>{{cite book | title=What the Nose Knows | first=Avery | last=Gilbert | authorlink=Avery Gilbert | publisher=Crown Publishers | year=2008 | page=52 | chapter=Freaks, Geeks, and Prodigies | isbn=978-1-4000-8234-6}}</ref>
*[[Phantosmia]] – "hallucinated smell," often unpleasant in nature

==Quantifying olfaction in industry==
[[File:Nasal Ranger.JPG|thumb|right|Nasal Ranger, an olfactometer, in use.]]

Scientists have devised methods for quantifying the intensity of odors, in particular for the purpose of analyzing unpleasant or objectionable odors released by an industrial source into a community.  Since the 1800s, industrial countries have encountered incidents where proximity of an industrial source or landfill produced adverse reactions to nearby residents regarding airborne odor.  The basic theory of odor analysis is to measure what extent of dilution with "pure" air is required before the sample in question is rendered indistinguishable from the "pure" or reference standard.  Since each person perceives odor differently, an "odor panel" composed of several different people is assembled, each sniffing the same sample of diluted specimen air.  A field [[olfactometer]] can be utilized to determine the magnitude of an odor.

Many air management districts in the [[USA]] have numerical standards of acceptability for the intensity of odor that is allowed to cross into a residential property.  For example, the [[Bay Area Air Quality Management District]] has applied its standard in regulating numerous industries, landfills, and sewage treatment plants.  Example applications this district has engaged are the [[San Mateo, California]] wastewater treatment plant; the [[Shoreline Amphitheatre]] in [[Mountain View, California]]; and the [[IT Corporation]] waste ponds, [[Martinez, California]].

==Olfaction in plants and animals==
The tendrils of plants are especially sensitive to airborne [[volatile organic compound]]s. Parasites such as [[dodder]] make use of this in locating their preferred hosts and locking on to them.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/science/03find.html | work=The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Fountain | title=This Plant Has the Sense of Smell (Loves Tomatoes, Hates Wheat) | date=3 October 2006}}</ref> The emission of volatile compounds is detected when foliage is browsed by animals. Threatened plants are then able to take defensive chemical measures, such as moving [[tannin]] compounds to their foliage. (see [[Plant perception (physiology)#Senses in plants|Plant perception]]).

The importance and sensitivity of smell varies among different organisms; most [[mammal]]s have a good sense of smell, whereas most [[bird]]s do not, except the [[Procellariiformes|tubenoses]] (e.g., [[petrel]]s and [[albatross]]es), certain species of [[vultures]] and the [[kiwi]]s. Among mammals, it is well-developed in the [[carnivore]]s and [[ungulate]]s, which must always be aware of each other, and in those that smell for their food, like [[mole (animal)|mole]]s.  Having a strong sense of smell is referred to as '''''macrosmatic'''''.

Figures suggesting greater or lesser sensitivity in various species reflect experimental findings from the reactions of animals exposed to aromas in known extreme dilutions. These are, therefore, based on perceptions by these animals, rather than mere nasal function. That is, the brain's smell-recognizing centers must react to the stimulus detected, for the animal to show a response to the smell in question. It is estimated that dogs in general have an olfactory sense approximately a hundred thousand to a million times more acute than a human's. This does not mean they are overwhelmed by smells our noses can detect; rather, it means they can discern a molecular presence when it is in much greater dilution in the carrier, air.

[[Scenthound]]s as a group can smell one- to ten-million times more acutely than a human, and [[Bloodhound]]s, which have the keenest sense of smell of any dogs,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} have noses ten- to one-hundred-million times more sensitive than a human's. They were bred for the specific purpose of tracking humans, and can detect a [[scent trail]] a few days old. The second-most-sensitive nose is possessed by the [[Basset Hound]], which was bred to track and hunt rabbits and other small animals.

[[Bears]], such as the Silvertip Grizzly found in parts of North America, have a sense of smell seven times stronger than that of the bloodhound, essential for locating food underground.  Using their elongated claws, bears dig deep trenches in search of burrowing animals and nests as well as roots, bulbs, and insects.  Bears can detect the scent of food from up to 18 miles away; because of their immense size, they often scavenge new kills, driving away the predators (including packs of wolves and human hunters) in the process.

The sense of smell is less-developed in the catarrhine [[primate]]s ([[Catarrhini]]), and nonexistent in [[cetacea]]ns, which compensate with a well-developed sense of [[taste]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. In some [[prosimian]]s, such as the [[Red-bellied Lemur]], scent glands occur atop the head. In many species, olfaction is highly tuned to [[pheromone]]s; a male [[silkworm]] moth, for example, can sense a single molecule of [[bombykol]].

Fish too have a well-developed sense of smell, even though they inhabit an aquatic environment.  Salmon utilize their sense of smell to identify and return to their home stream waters. Catfish use their sense of smell to identify other individual catfish and to maintain a social hierarchy. Many fishes use the sense of smell to identify mating partners or to alert to the presence of food.

Insects use primarily their [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] for olfaction. Sensory neurons in the antenna generate odor-specific electrical signals called spikes in response to odor. They process these signals from the sensory neurons in the [[antennal lobe]]  followed by the [[mushroom body|mushroom bodies]] and lateral horn of the brain. The antennae have the sensory neurons in the sensilla and they have their [[axons]] terminating in the antennal lobes, where they synapse with other neurons there in semidelineated (with membrane boundaries) called glomeruli. These antennal lobes have two kinds of neurons, projection neurons (excitatory) and local neurons (inhibitory). The projection neurons send their axon terminals to mushroom body and lateral horn (both of which are part of the protocerebrum of the insects), and local neurons have no axons. Recordings from projection neurons show in some insects strong specialization and discrimination for the odors presented (especially for the projection neurons of the macroglomeruli, a specialized complex of glomeruli responsible for the pheromones detection). Processing beyond this level is not exactly known though some preliminary results are available.
