'''The Inverse Benefit Law''' states that the ratio of benefits to harms among patients taking new [[drug]]s tends to vary inversely with how extensively a drug is [[marketed]]. Two Americans, [[Howard Brody]] and [[Donald Light]], have defined the Inverse Benefit Law, inspired by [[Julian Tudor Hart|Tudor Hart]]'s [[Inverse care law]].<ref>[http://www.pharmamyths.net/files/Brody-Light_Inverse_Bene_LAW_ARTICLE.pdf Brody H, Light DW. The inverse benefit law: how drug marketing undermines patient safety and public health. Am J Public Health. 2011; 101(3):399-404.]</ref>

A drug [[effective]] for a serious [[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]] is less and less effective as it is promoted for milder cases and for other conditions for which the drug was not approved. As [[effectiveness]] becomes more diluted, the risks of harmful [[side effects]] proliferate, thus the benefit-harm ratio worsens as a drug is [[marketing|marketed]] more widely. The inverse benefit law highlights the need for comparative effectiveness research and other reforms to improve evidence-based prescribing. <ref>[http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d598.extract Tanne JH. “Inverse benefit law” explains how drug marketing undermines patient safety. BMJ. 2011; 342:d598.]</ref>

== State of affairs ==
The law is manifested through 6 basic marketing strategies:
* reducing thresholds for diagnosing disease,
* relying on surrogate endpoints,
* exaggerating [[safety]] claims,
* exaggerating [[efficacy]] claims,
* [[Disease mongering|creating new diseases]],
* encouraging unapproved uses.

== Impact ==
Many harms of new drugs are unexpected, and could be as serious as death. This is the reason why organizations like "Worst Pill, Best Pill" <ref>[http://www.worstpills.org/ Worst Pill, Best Pill. Public Citizen's Health Research Group.]</ref> recommend not to use/prescribe new medications before being in the market for at least ten years (except in the very few cases of really important new drugs that solve previous unsolved problems). 

Agencies of drugs, committee of ethics and organizations of patients' safety should consider: 
* Requiring that clinical trials run long enough to pick up evidence of side effects and record all adverse reactions, including in subjects who drop out.<ref>[http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/281/18/1753.extract Wood AJJ. The Safety of New Medicines: The Importance of Asking the Right Questions. JAMA. 1999; 281(18):1753-4.]</ref>
* Paying companies more for new drugs in proportion to how much better they are for patients than existing drugs, and marketing according to the value of the new drugs (ratio of benefits to harms and marketing).<ref>[http://english.prescrire.org/en/81/168/46799/0/NewsDetails.aspx Astellas' lawsuit against Prescrire: French court rules that Prescrire did not "denigrate" Protopic° (tacrolimus). Prescrire. 2 March 2011]</ref>
* Considering that market could be a force against the best use of medications.<ref>[http://www.actasanitaria.com/actasanitaria/frontend/desarrollo_noticia.jsp?idCanal=23&idContenido=24885 Gérvas J. Garum. Acta Sanitaria. 07/03/2011.]</ref>
