'''Sleep studies''' are tests that record the body activity during sleep. They are helpful in identification of [[sleep disorder]]s.  [[Polysomnography]], a type of sleep study, is the [[gold standard]] to rule out [[obstructive sleep apnea]].  If a home study does not find obstructive sleep apnea, but the patient still complains of unrefreshing sleep and daytime sleepiness, an in-lab polysomnogram may be necessary to find other possible disorders.<ref name=Polysomnography.vs.Home.Sleep.Study>{{cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Sharon M.|title=Polysomnography vs. the home sleep study: Which is better?|url=http://www.clinicaladvisor.com/polysomnography-vs-the-home-sleep-study-which-is-better/article/226158/#http://www.clinicaladvisor.com/polysomnography-vs-the-home-sleep-study-which-is-better/article/226158|publisher=Clinical Advisor|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>

==Utility==
Sleep studies can help diagnose:
* Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as [[sleep apnea]]<ref name=nhlbi>{{cite web|title=What Are Sleep Studies?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/slpst/|publisher=National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=WebMD/>
* Sleep-related [[seizure disorders]]<ref name=nhlbi/>
* Sleep-related movement disorders, such as periodic limb movement disorder<ref name=nhlbi/>
* Problems sleeping at night ([[insomnia]]) : caused by [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], depression, hunger, physical discomfort, or other problem<ref name=WebMD/>
* Sleep disorders that cause extreme daytime tiredness, such as [[narcolepsy]]<ref name=nhlbi/><ref name=WebMD/>
* Problems with nighttime behaviours, such as [[sleepwalking]], [[night terrors]], or [[bed-wetting]]<ref name=WebMD/>
* [[Bruxism]] or grinding of the teeth during sleep<ref name=Polysomnography.vs.Home.Sleep.Study/>
* Problems sleeping during the day because of working at night or rotating shift work. This sleep problem is called [[shift work sleep disorder]].<ref name=WebMD/>
* Conditions such as periodic limb movement disorder, which is repeated muscle [[Myoclonus|twitching]] of the [[foot|feet]], [[arm]]s, or [[Human leg|legs]] during sleep.<ref name=WebMD/>  Sleep studies may be used to diagnose or rule out [[restless legs syndrome]] (RLS). However, RLS usually is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms, medical history, and a physical exam.<ref name=nhlbi/>
* Sleep studies can also determine problems with [[Sleep|stages of sleep]]. The two stages of sleep are [[non-rapid eye movement]] (NREM) and [[rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM). Normally,  four to five series of NREM and REM make up a night's sleep. A change in this cycle may make it hard to sleep soundly.<ref name=WebMD/>

==Types==
The most common sleep studies are:
===Simple sleep study===
It is a simple sleep study done within the home premises.<ref name=Polysomnography.vs.Home.Sleep.Study/>
===Polysomnogram===
Polysomnography records several body functions during sleep, including brain activity, eye movement, oxygen and carbon dioxide blood levels, heart rate and rhythm, breathing rate and rhythm, the flow of air through the mouth and nose, snoring, body muscle movements, and chest and belly movement.<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|title=Sleep Studies|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-studies|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>

===Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)===
The MSLT measures, several times in one day, how long it takes the patient to fall asleep. It also determines whether REM sleep appears upon falling asleep.<ref name=WebMD/><ref name=medicaid>{{cite web|title=Medicaid and Health Choice and Clinical Coverage Policy No.: 1A-20|url=http://www.ncdhhs.gov/dma/mp/1A20.pdf|publisher=NC Division of Medical Assistance Sleep Studies Polysomnography Services|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>

===Maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)===
This test measures whether you can stay awake during a time when you are normally awake.<ref name=WebMD/><ref name=medicaid/>
