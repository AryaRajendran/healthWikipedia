A '''chemical nomenclature''' is a set of rules to generate [[systematic name]]s for [[chemical compound]]s. The nomenclature used most frequently worldwide is the one created and developed by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC).

The IUPAC's rules for naming [[Organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic compound]]s are contained in two publications, known as the ''[[Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry|Blue Book]]''<ref>{{citation | title = Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry | origyear = 1958 (A: Hydrocarbons, and B: Fundamental Heterocyclic Systems), 1965 (C: Characteristic Groups) | year =1971 | edition = 3rd  | publisher = Butterworths | location = London | isbn = 0-408-70144-7}}.</ref><ref name="blue book">{{BlueBook1979}}. {{BlueBook1993}}. {{BlueBook2004}}.</ref> and the ''[[Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry|Red Book]]'',<ref name="redbook">{{RedBook2005}}.</ref> respectively. A third publication, known as the ''[[Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry|Green Book]]'',<ref name="greenbook">{{GreenBook2nd}}.</ref> describes the recommendations for the use of [[symbol]]s for [[Physical quantity|physical quantities]] (in association with the [[IUPAP]]), while a fourth, the ''[[Compendium of Chemical Terminology|Gold Book]]'',<ref name="goldbook">''Compendium of Chemical Terminology, IMPACT Recommendations (2nd Ed.)'', Oxford:Blackwell Scientific Publications. (1997)</ref> contains the definitions of a large number of technical terms used in chemistry. Similar compendia exist for [[biochemistry]]<ref name="bio chem">''Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents'', London:Portland Press, 1992.</ref> (the ''White Book'', in association with the [[IUBMB]]), [[analytical chemistry]]<ref name="anal">{{OrangeBook3rd}}.</ref> (the ''[[Compendium of Analytical Nomenclature|Orange Book]]''), [[macromolecular chemistry]]<ref name="macro">''Compendium of Macromolecular Nomenclature'', Oxford:Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1991.</ref> (the ''Purple Book'') and [[clinical chemistry]]<ref>{{citation | title = Compendium of Terminology and Nomenclature of Properties in Clinical Laboratory Sciences | series = IMPACT Recommendations 1995 | location = Oxford | publisher = Blackwell Science | isbn = 0-86542-612-0}}.</ref> (the ''Silver Book''). These "color books" are supplemented by shorter recommendations for specific circumstances that are published from time to time in the [[Scientific journal|journal]] ''[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]''.

==Aims of chemical nomenclature==
The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that a spoken or written chemical name leaves no ambiguity concerning to what chemical compound the name refers: each chemical name should refer to a single substance. A less important aim is to ensure that each substance has a single name, although the number of acceptable names is limited.

Preferably, the name also conveys some information about the structure or chemistry of a compound. [[CAS number]]s form an extreme example of names that do not perform this function: each CAS number refers to a single compound but none contain information about the structure.

The form of nomenclature used depends on the audience to which it is addressed. As such, no single '''''correct''''' form exists, but rather there are different forms that are more or less appropriate in different circumstances.

A common name will often suffice to identify a chemical compound in a particular set of circumstances. To be more generally applicable, the name should indicate at least the [[chemical formula]]. To be more specific still, the three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms may need to be specified.

In a few specific circumstances (such as the construction of large indices), it becomes necessary to ensure that each compound has a unique name: This requires the addition of extra rules to the standard IUPAC system (the [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS system]] is the most commonly used in this context), at the expense of having names that are longer and less familiar to most readers. Another system gaining popularity is the [[International Chemical Identifier]] (InChI)—while InChI symbols are not human-readable, they contain complete information about substance structure. That makes them more general than CAS numbers.

The IUPAC system is often criticized for the above failures when they become relevant (for example, in differing reactivity of sulfur [[allotropes]], which IUPAC does not distinguish). While IUPAC has a human-readable advantage over CAS numbering, it would be difficult to claim that the IUPAC names for some larger, relevant molecules (such as [[rapamycin]]) are human-readable, and so most researchers simply use the informal names.

== Differing aims of chemical nomenclature and lexicography ==
It is generally understood that the aims of [[lexicography]] versus chemical nomenclature vary and are to an extent at odds. Dictionaries of words, whether in traditional print or on the web, collect and report the meanings of words as their uses appear and change over time. For web dictionaries with limited or no formal editorial process, definitions—in this case, definitions of chemical names and terms—can change rapidly without concern for the formal or historical meanings.

== History ==
[[Image:Lavoisier Nomenclature01.gif|right|thumb|First page of Lavoisier's ''Chymical Nomenclature'' in English.]]

The nomenclature of [[alchemy]] is rich in description, but does not effectively meet the aims outlined above. Opinions differ about whether this was deliberate on the part of the early practitioners of alchemy or whether it was a consequence of the particular (and often esoteric) theoretical framework in which they worked.

While both explanations are probably valid to some extent, it is remarkable that the first "modern" system of chemical nomenclature appeared at the same time as the distinction (by [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]]) between [[Chemical element|elements]] and [[Chemical compound|compounds]], in the late eighteenth century.

The [[France|French]] chemist [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] published his recommendations<ref name="guyton">{{citation | last = Guyton de Morveau | first = L. B. | authorlink = Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau | year = 1782 | journal = J. Phys. | volume = 19 | pages = 310}}.</ref> in 1782, hoping that his "constant method of denomination" would "help the intelligence and relieve the memory". The system was refined in collaboration with [[Berthollet]], [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy|de Fourcroy]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]],<ref name="french">{{citation | last1 = Guyton de Morveau | first1 = L. B. | authorlink1 = Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau | last2 = Lavoisier | first2 = A. L. | authorlink2 = Antoine Lavoisier | last3 = Berthollet | first3 = C.

L. | authorlink = Antoine Lavoisier | year = 1801 | title = [[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]] | edition = 3e | location = Paris | publisher = Deterville}}.</ref> The project was also espoused by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]],<ref name="berzelius">{{citation | last = Berzelius | first = J.

The recommendations of Guyton covered only what would be today known as inorganic compounds. With the massive expansion of organic chemistry in the mid-nineteenth century and the greater understanding of the structure of organic compounds, the need for a less ''ad hoc'' system of nomenclature was felt just as the theoretical tools became available to make this possible. An international conference was convened in [[Geneva]] in 1892 by the national chemical societies, from which the first widely accepted proposals for standardization arose.<ref name="ref1892">{{citation | title = Congrès de nomenclature chimique, Genève 1892 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2820064.image | journal = Bull. Soc. Chim. Paris, Ser. 3 | volume = 7 | pages = xiii–xxiv | year = 1892}}.</ref>

A commission was set up in 1913 by the Council of the International Association of Chemical Societies, but its work was interrupted by [[World War I]]. After the war, the task passed to the newly formed [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], which first appointed commissions for organic, inorganic, and biochemical nomenclature in 1921 and continues to do so to this day.

====Compositional nomenclature====
For Type I Ionic Binary Compounds, the cation (a metal in most cases) is named first, and the anion (a nonmetal in most cases) is named second with "-ide" added to it. In these compounds, there is not ambiguity about the [[oxidation state]] of an element. The cation takes the name of its elemental form, and the anion name uses the first part of its elemental name with the subsequent addition of the suffix "-ide". For example, the compound LiBr is made up of Li<sup>+</sup> cations and Br<sup>-</sup> anions. Thus, the compound LiBr would be called [[lithium bromide]]. The compound BaO, which is composed of Ba<sup>2+</sub> cations and O<sup>2-</sup> anion, is referred to as [[barium oxide]]. Note that in these compounds, the charges on the ions balance to zero.

Type II Ionic Binary Compounds are those in which the cation does not have a fixed [[oxidation state]] - this is very frequent among [[transition metals]]. To name these compounds, one must determine the charge of the cation and then write out the name as would be done with Type I Ionic Compounds, except that a Roman numeral (indicating the charge of the cation) is written in parentheses next to the cation name (this is sometimes referred to as [[stock nomenclature]]). For example, take the compound FeCl<sub>3</sub>. The cation, [[iron]], can occur as Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sub>. In order for the compound to have a net charge of zero, the cation must be Fe<sup>3+</sup> so that the three Cl<sup>-</sup> anions can be balanced out (3+ and 3- balance to 0). Thus, this compound is called [[iron(III) chloride]]. Another example could be the compound PbS<sub>2</sub>. Because the S<sup>2-</sup> anion has a subscript of 2 in the formula (giving a 4- charge), the compound must be balanced with a 4+ charge on the Pb cation ([[lead]] is a transition metal, and can form cations with a 4+ or a 2+ charge). Thus, the compound is made of one Pb<sup>4+</sup> cation to every two S<sup>2-</sup> anions, the compound is balanced, and its name is written as [[lead(IV) sulfide]]. It should be noted that an older system - relying on Latin names for the elements - is also sometimes used to name Type II Ionic Binary Compounds. In this system, the metal (instead of a Roman numeral next to it) has an "-ic" or "-ous" suffix added to it to indicate its oxidation state ("-ous" for lower, "-ic" for higher). For example, the compound FeO contains the Fe<sup>2+</sup> cation (which balances out with the O<sup>2-</sup> anion). Since this oxidation state is lower than the other possibility (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), this compound is sometimes called [[Iron(II) oxide|ferrous oxide]]. For the compound, SnO<sub>2</sub>, the tin ion is Sn<sup>4+</sub> (balancing out the 4- charge on the two O<sup>2-</sub> anions), and because this is a higher oxidation state than the alternative (Sn<sup>2+</sub>), this compound is called [[Tin dioxide|stannic oxide]]. 

Some ionic compounds contain [[polyatomic ion]]s, which are charged entities containing two or more covalently bonded types of atoms. It is important to know the names of common polyatomic ions; these include [[ammonium]] (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), [[nitrite]] (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), [[sulfite]] (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), [[sulfate]] (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), [[Sulfate#Chemical properties|hydrogen sulfate]] (bisulfate) (HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>
), [[hydroxide]] (OH<sup>-</sup>), [[cyanide]] (CN<sup>-</sup>), [[phosphate]] (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>), [[Phosphate#Chemical properties|hydrogen phosphate]] (HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), [[Phosphate#Chemical properties|dihydrogen phosphate]] (H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>), [[carbonate]] (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), [[bicarbonate|hydrogen carbonate]] (bicarbonate) (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sub>), [[hypochlorite]] (ClO<sup>-</sup>), [[chlorite]] (ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) [[chlorate]] (ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), [[perchlorate]] (ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>), [[acetate]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), [[permanganate]] (MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>), [[dichromate]] (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup>) [[chromate]] (CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), [[peroxide]] (O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>). If you are given the formula Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, it can be seen that the cation is [[sodium]], or Na<sup>+</sub>, while the anion is the sulfite ion (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>). Therefore, this compound is named [[sodium sulfite]]. If the given formula is Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, it can be seen that OH<sup>-</sub> is the hydroxide ion. Since the charge on the calcium ion is 2+, it makes sense there must be two OH<sup>-</sub> ions to balance the charge. Therefore, the name of the compound is [[calcium hydroxide]]. If one is asked to write the formula for copper(I) chromate, the Roman numeral indicates that copper ion is Cu<sup>+</sup> and one can identify that the compound contains the chromate ion (CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>). Two of the 1+ copper ions are needed to balance the charge of one 2- chromate ion, so the formula is Cu<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>.

Type III Binary Compounds are [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]], an occurrence between nonmetals elements; compounds like these are also known as [[molecule]]s. In the compound, the first element is named first and with its full elemental name. The second element is named as if it were an anion (root name of the element + “-ide” suffix). Then, prefixes are used to indicate the numbers of each atom present: these prefixes are mono- (one), di- (two), tri- (three), tetra- (four), penta- (five), hexa- (six), hepta- (seven), octa- (eight), nona- (nine), and deca- (ten). It should be noted that the prefix "mono-" is never used with the first element. Thus, NCl<sub>3</sub> would be named [[nitrogen trichloride]], P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> would be called [[diphosphorus pentoxide]] (note how the “a” of the penta- prefix is dropped before the vowel for easier pronunciation),  and BF<sub>3</sub> would be called [[boron trifluoride]]. In the case of being given the name and wishing to write the formula, examples include [[carbon dioxide]], which would be written as CO<sub>2</sub>, and [[sulfur tetrafluoride]], which is written as SF<sub>4</sub>. The compounds H<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub>, however, are not named according to this system and are referred to by their common names: [[water]] and [[ammonia]], respectively. In [[Dihydrogen monoxide hoax|a joking context]], water has been referred to by its systematic name, ''dihydrogen monoxide''.

====Substitutive nomenclature====
This naming method generally follows established IUPAC organic nomenclature. [[Hydrides]] of the main group elements (groups 13–17) are given -ane base names, e.g. [[borane]] ([[Boron|B]][[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>3</sub>), [[oxidane]] ([[hydrogen|
H]]<sub>2</sub>[[Oxygen|O]]), [[phosphane]] ([[Phosphorus|P]][[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>3</sub>) (the name [[phosphine]] is also in common use, but is not recommended by IUPAC). The compound PCl<sub>3</sub> would be named substitutively as trichlorophosphane. Not all names are derived from the element name, for instance: [[nitrogen|N]][[hydrogen|
H]]<sub>3</sub> is called "[[azane]]".

====Additive nomenclature====
This naming method has been developed principally for coordination compounds although it can be more widely applied. An example of its application is:
*[CoCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) chloride
Note that [[ligands]] such as chloride become chlorido- rather than chloro- as in substitutive naming.
