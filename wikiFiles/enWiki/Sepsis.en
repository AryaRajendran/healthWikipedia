'''Sepsis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|p|s|ɨ|s}}; from the Greek {{lang|grc|σῆψις}}: the state of putrefaction and decay) is a potentially deadly [[medicine|medical]] condition characterized by a whole-body [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] state (called a [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] or SIRS) caused by severe [[infection]].<ref name="pmid12682500">{{cite journal |pages=1250–6 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000050454.01978.3B |title=2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference |year=2003 |last1=Levy |first1=Mitchell M. |last2=Fink |first2=Mitchell P. |last3=Marshall |first3=John C. |last4=Abraham |first4=Edward |last5=Angus |first5=Derek |last6=Cook |first6=Deborah |last7=Cohen |first7=Jonathan |last8=Opal |first8=Steven M. |last9=Vincent |first9=Jean-Louis |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=31 |issue=4 |pmid=12682500}}</ref><ref name="1992consensus">{{cite journal |pages=1644–55 |doi=10.1378/chest.101.6.1644 |title=Definitions for sepsis and organ failure and guidelines for the use of innovative therapies in sepsis.

It has been inconsistently used in the past by medical professionals, for example as a synonym of [[bacteremia]], causing some confusion.<ref name="1992consensus"/>

Sepsis is caused by the [[immune system]]'s response to a serious [[infection]], most commonly [[bacteria]], but also [[fungi]], [[viruses]], and [[parasites]] in the [[blood]], [[urinary tract]], [[lungs]], [[skin]], or other tissues.  Sepsis can be thought of as falling within a continuum from infection to [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]].<ref name = "pmid15639681">{{cite journal |author=Annane D, Bellissant E, Cavaillon JM |title=Septic shock |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9453 |pages=63–78 |year=2005 |pmid=15639681 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17667-8 |url=}}</ref> 

Common symptoms of sepsis include those related to a specific infection, but usually accompanied by high fevers, hot, flushed skin, [[tachycardia|elevated heart rate]], [[hyperventilation]], altered mental status, [[edema|swelling]], and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]. In the very young and elderly, or in people with [[immunodeficiency|weakened immune systems]], the pattern of symptoms may be atypical, with [[hypothermia]] and without an easily localizable infection. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Levy MM, Fink MP, Marshall JC, ''et al.'' |title=2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference |journal=Crit.

<!-- Treatment -->
Sepsis is usually treated with [[intravenous fluids]] and [[antibiotics]]. If fluid replacement isn't sufficient to maintain [[blood pressure]], [[vasopressor]]s can be used. [[Mechanical ventilation]] and [[dialysis]] may be needed to support the function of the lungs and kidneys, respectively. To guide therapy, a [[central venous catheter]] and an [[arterial catheter]] may be placed; measurement of other hemodynamic variables (such as [[cardiac output]], mixed venous oxygen saturation or stroke volume variation) may also be used. Sepsis patients require preventive measures for [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[stress ulcer]]s and [[pressure ulcer]]s, unless other conditions prevent this. Some might benefit from tight control of [[blood sugar]] levels with [[insulin]] (targeting [[stress hyperglycemia]]).<ref name=Campaign2008/> The use of [[corticosteroids]] is controversial.<ref name=Steroids2012>{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=GP|coauthors=Balk, RA|title=Systemic steroids in severe sepsis and septic shock.|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=2012 Jan 15|volume=185|issue=2|pages=133–9|pmid=21680949}}</ref> [[Activated drotrecogin alfa]] ([[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] activated [[protein C]]), originally marketed for severe sepsis, has not been found to be helpful, and has recently been withdrawn from sale.<ref name=APC2012/>

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Image:Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman Meningicoccal Disease.jpg|thumb|[[Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman]], with sepsis due to [[meningococcemia]].]]
In addition to symptoms related to the provoking infection, sepsis is frequently associated with either [[fever]] or [[hypothermia]], [[Tachypnea|rapid breathing]], [[tachycardia|elevated heart rate]], [[altered mental status|confusion]], and [[edema]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Levy|first=MM|coauthors=Fink, MP; Marshall, JC; Abraham, E; Angus, D; Cook, D; Cohen, J; Opal, SM; Vincent, JL; Ramsay, G; SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS,|title=2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference.|journal=Critical care medicine|date=2003 Apr|volume=31|issue=4|pages=1250–6|pmid=12682500}}</ref> Early signs are [[tachycardia|elevated heart rate]], [[oliguria|decreased urination]], and [[hyperglycemia|elevated blood sugar]], while signs of established sepsis are [[altered mental status|confusion]], [[metabolic acidosis]] with compensatory [[respiratory alkalosis]] (which can manifest as faster breathing), [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], decreased systemic [[vascular resistance]], higher [[cardiac output]], and [[coagulopathy|dysfunctions of blood coagulation]].<ref name=Hospital2012>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Sylvia McKean ...

Sepsis may also lead to a drop in blood pressure, resulting in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. This may result in light-headedness. Bruising or intense bleeding may also occur.

The most common primary sources of infection resulting in sepsis are the lungs, the abdomen and the urinary tract.<ref name=M70>{{cite book|last=Dolin|first=[edited by] Gerald L. Mandell, John E.

==Diagnosis==
{{SIRS}}
In those with sepsis it is recommended that [[blood cultures]] be drawn before antibiotics are given.<ref name=Campaign2008>{{cite journal|last=Dellinger|first=RP|coauthors=Levy, MM; Carlet, JM; Bion, J; Parker, MM; Jaeschke, R; Reinhart, K; Angus, DC; Brun-Buisson, C; Beale, R; Calandra, T; Dhainaut, JF; Gerlach, H; Harvey, M; Marini, JJ; Marshall, J; Ranieri, M; Ramsay, G; Sevransky, J; Thompson, BT; Townsend, S; Vender, JS; Zimmerman, JL; Vincent, JL|title=Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008.|journal=Intensive care medicine|date=2008 Jan|volume=34|issue=1|pages=17–60|pmid=18058085}}</ref>

===Definitions===
According to the American College of Chest Physicians and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, there are different levels of sepsis:<ref name="1992consensus"/>
*[[Systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) is the presence of two or more of the following: abnormal [[body temperature]], [[heart rate]], [[respiratory rate]] or [[blood gas]], and [[white blood cell]] count.
*Sepsis is defined as SIRS in response to an infectious process.<ref name=Soong2012>{{cite journal|last=Soong|first=J|coauthors=Soni, N|title=Sepsis: recognition and treatment.|journal=Clinical medicine (London, England)|date=2012 Jun|volume=12|issue=3|pages=276–80|pmid=22783783}}</ref>
*Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion (manifesting as hypotension, elevated lactate, or [[oliguria|decreased urine output]]. <ref name="Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2012">{{cite journal|last=Dellinger|first=RP|coauthors=Levy, MM; Rhodes, A; Annane, D; Gerlach, H; Opal, SM; Sevransky, JE; Sprung, CL; Douglas, IS; Jaeschke, R; Osborn, TM; Nunnally, ME; Townsend, SR; Reinhart, K; Kleinpell, RM; Angus, DC; Deutschman, CS; Machado, FR; Rubenfeld, GD; Webb, SA; Beale, RJ; Vincent, JL; Moreno, R; Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, Committee; Pediatric, Subgroup|title=Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012.|journal=Critical care medicine|date=2013 Feb|volume=41|issue=2|pages=580-637|pmid=23353941}}</ref>
*[[Septic shock]] is severe sepsis plus persistently [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] following the administration of intravenous fluids.<ref name=Campaign2008/>

===Infection===
Infection can be suspected or proven (by culture, stain, or [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR)), or a clinical syndrome pathognomonic for infection. Specific evidence for infection includes WBCs in normally sterile fluid (such as urine or [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF)); evidence of a perforated [[viscus]] (free air on abdominal x-ray or CT scan; signs of [[acute peritonitis]]); abnormal chest x-ray (CXR) consistent with [[pneumonia]] (with focal opacification); or [[petechiae]], [[purpura]], or [[purpura fulminans]].

===End-organ dysfunction===
Examples of end-organ dysfunction include the following:<ref name="pmid17948334">{{cite journal |pages=2408–16 |doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000282072.56245.91 |title=Mechanisms of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction |year=2007 |last1=Abraham |first1=Edward |last2=Singer |first2=Mervyn |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=35 |issue=10 |pmid=17948334}}</ref>
*Lungs:[[acute lung injury]] (ALI) (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> < 300) or [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> < 200)
*Brain: [[encephalopathy]] symptoms: agitation, confusion, coma; cause: ischemia, hemorrhage, microthrombi, microabscesses, multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy
*Liver: disruption of protein synthetic function: manifests acutely as progressive [[coagulopathy]] due to inability to synthesize [[clotting factors]], disruption of metabolic functions: manifests as cessation of [[bilirubin]] metabolism, resulting in elevated unconjugated serum [[bilirubin]] levels
*Kidney: [[oliguria]] and [[anuria]], [[electrolyte abnormalities]], [[volume overload]]
*Heart: systolic and diastolic [[heart failure]], likely due to [[cytokines]] that depress myocyte function, cellular damage, manifest as a [[troponin]] leak (although not necessarily ischemic in nature)

More specific definitions of end-organ dysfunction exist for SIRS in pediatrics.<ref name="pmid15636651">{{cite journal |author=Goldstein B, Giroir B, Randolph A |title=International pediatric sepsis consensus conference: definitions for sepsis and organ dysfunction in pediatrics |journal=Pediatr Crit Care Med |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=2–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15636651 |doi=10.1097/01.PCC.0000149131.72248.E6 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1529-7535&volume=6&issue=1&spage=2}}</ref>

Consensus definitions, however, continue to evolve, with the latest expanding the list of signs and symptoms of sepsis to reflect clinical bedside experience.<ref name="pmid12682500" />

===Differential diagnosis===

The differential diagnosis for sepsis is broad and includes those conditions that can cause the systemic signs of SIRS: [[alcohol withdrawal]], [[pulmonary embolus]], [[thyrotoxicosis]], [[anaphylaxis]], [[adrenal insufficiency]], and [[neurogenic shock]].<ref name=Hospital2012/>

=== Neonatal sepsis ===
In common clinical usage, [[neonatal sepsis]] specifically refers to the presence of a bacterial [[bacteremia|blood stream infection]] (BSI), such as [[meningitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[pyelonephritis]], or [[gastroenteritis]], in the setting of fever. Criteria with regards to hemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure are not useful clinically because these symptoms often do not arise in neonates until death is imminent and unpreventable.

==Pathophysiology==
Sepsis is caused by a combination of factors related to the invading organism(s) and the host (pre-disposing illnesses, genetics, and immune system).<ref name=Critical2005/>

===Microbial factors===
A bacteria's capsule (for example, in certain strains of [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]), can allow it to evade [[phagocytosis]], while [[pilus|pili]] of some strains of [[E. Coli]] can allow this bacterium to adhere to the [[epithelium]] of the [[kidneys]].<ref name=Critical2005>{{cite book|first=editors, Jesse B. Hall, Gregory A. Schmidt, Lawrence D.H. Wood ; Cora D. Taylor, editorial|title=Principles of critical care|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division|location=New York|isbn=0071416404|edition=3rd ed.}}</ref> Sepsis caused by gram negative bacteria is thought to be largely due to the host's response to [[lipopolysaccharides]], also called LPS or [[endotoxin]], in the cell wall, while gram positive bacteria are more likely to cause sepsis by their release of [[exotoxins]].<ref name=Critical2005/> Some exotoxins can quickly lead to a rapid release of cytokines by acting as [[superantigens]], which can simultaneously bind [[major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] and the T-cell receptor.<ref name=Critical2005/>

===Host factors===
Severe sepsis occurs when sepsis leads to organ dysfunction, such as [[respiratory failure|pulmonary dysfunction]], coagulation or other blood abnormalities,  [[oliguria|decreased urine production]], or [[altered mental status]]. If the organ dysfunction of severe sepsis is associated with low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]), or insufficient blood flow ([[hypoperfusion]]) to one or more organs (causing, for example, [[lactic acidosis]]), this is septic shock.

Sepsis can lead to  [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]] (MODS) (formerly known as multiple organ failure), and death. Organ dysfunction results from local changes in blood flow, from sepsis-induced [[hypotension]] (< 90 mmHg or a reduction of ≥ 40 mmHg from baseline) and from [[diffuse intravascular coagulation]], among other things. One of the factors which appears to promote the development of MODS is the cytokine-induced abnormalities to microcirculation which has been observed as microvascular thrombosis within septic patients.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Balk|first=Robert|coauthors=Richert E Goyette|title=Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in patients with severe sepsis: moer than just inflammation|journal=International Congress and Symposium Series 249|date=18|year=2001|month=10|page=37-58|url=http://experiencedmedicalwriter.com/Examples_files/MODS_Cyran.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref>  

[[Endotoxins]] produced from bacteria and [[cytokines]], particularly TNF, IL-1 and IL-6, can activate the pro[[coagulation]] factors in the endothelium, leading to endothelial damage. This damaged endothelial surface inhibits anticoagulant properties as well as increases antifibrinolysis, which can lead to intravascular clotting, microvascular [[thrombosis]] and multiple organ failure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nimah|first=Marianne|coauthors=Richard J. Brilli|title=Coagulation dysfunction in sepsis and multiple organ system failure|journal=Critical Care Clinics|year=2003|volume=19|page=441-458|doi=10.1016/s0749/0704(03)00008-3|url=http://www.sassit.co.za/Journals/ICU/Coagulation/Coagulation%20dysfunction%20in%20sepsis%20&%20multiple%20otrgan%20failure%20Crit%20car%20eclin%202003.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref>  

[[Bacteremia]] is the presence of viable [[bacteria]] in the bloodstream. Likewise, the terms [[viremia]] and [[fungemia]] simply refer to [[virus]]es and [[fungus|fungi]] in the bloodstream. These terms say nothing about the consequences this has on the body. For example, bacteria can be introduced into the bloodstream during [[toothbrushing]].<ref name="pmid18541739">{{cite journal  |pages=3118–25 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.758524  |title=Bacteremia Associated with Tooth Brushing and Dental Extraction  |year=2008  |last1=Lockhart  |first1=P.

== Management ==
The therapy of sepsis rests on intravenous fluids, [[antibiotic]]s, surgical drainage of infected fluid collections, and appropriate support for organ dysfunction. This may include [[dialysis|hemodialysis]] in [[kidney failure]], [[mechanical ventilation]] in [[lung|pulmonary]] dysfunction, transfusion of [[blood plasma|blood products]], and drug and fluid therapy for circulatory failure. Ensuring adequate nutrition—preferably by enteral feeding, but if necessary by [[parenteral nutrition]]—is important during prolonged illness.

In those with [[hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]] levels, [[insulin]] to bring it down to 7.8-10&nbsp;mmol/L (140-180&nbsp;mg/dL) is recommended with lower levels potentially worsening outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hirasawa|first=H|coauthors=Oda, S; Nakamura, M|title=Blood glucose control in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.|journal=World journal of gastroenterology : WJG|date=2009 Sep 7|volume=15|issue=33|pages=4132–6|pmid=19725146}}</ref> Medication to prevent [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[gastric ulcers]] may also be used.<ref name=Campaign2008/>

===Antibiotics===
In severe sepsis, broad spectrum antibiotics are recommended within 1 hour of making the diagnosis.<ref name=Campaign2008/> For every hour delay in the administration there is an associated 6% rise in mortality.<ref name=Soong2012/> Duration of treatment is typically 7-10&nbsp;days with the type of antibiotic used directed by the results of cultures.<ref name=Campaign2008/>

===Early goal directed therapy===
[[Early goal directed therapy]] (EGDT) is an approach to the management of severe sepsis during the initial 6&nbsp;hours after diagnosis.<ref name=Campaign2008/> A step-wise approach should be used, with the physiologic goal of optimizing cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility.<ref name="EGDT">{{cite journal |pages=1368–77 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa010307 |title=Early Goal-Directed Therapy in the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock |year=2001 |last1=Rivers |first1=Emanuel |last2=Nguyen |first2=Bryant |last3=Havstad |first3=Suzanne |last4=Ressler |first4=Julie |last5=Muzzin |first5=Alexandria |last6=Knoblich |first6=Bernhard |last7=Peterson |first7=Edward |last8=Tomlanovich |first8=Michael |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=345 |issue=19 |pmid=11794169 |author9=Early Goal-Directed Therapy Collaborative Group}}</ref> It has been found to reduce mortality in those with sepsis.<ref name="pmid18766093">{{cite journal |pages=2734–9 |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e318186f839 |title=The effect of a quantitative resuscitation strategy on mortality in patients with sepsis: A meta-analysis |year=2008 |last1=Jones |first1=Alan E. |last2=Brown |first2=Michael D. |last3=Trzeciak |first3=Stephen |last4=Shapiro |first4=Nathan I. |last5=Garrett |first5=John S. |last6=Heffner |first6=Alan C. |last7=Kline |first7=Jeffrey A. |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=36 |issue=10 |pmid=18766093 |author8=Emergency Medicine Shock Research Network investigators |pmc=2737059}}</ref>

Urine output is also monitored, with a minimum goal of 0.5 ml/kg/h. In the original trial, mortality was cut from 46.5% to 30.5%.<ref name="EGDT" /> An appropriate decrease in serum [[Lactic acid|lactate]] however may be equivalent to SvO2 and easier to obtain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=AE|coauthors=Shapiro, NI, Trzeciak, S, Arnold, RC, Claremont, HA, Kline, JA, Emergency Medicine Shock Research Network (EMShockNet), Investigators|title=Lactate clearance vs central venous oxygen saturation as goals of early sepsis therapy: a randomized clinical trial.|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=2010 Feb 24|volume=303|issue=8|pages=739–46|pmid=20179283|doi=10.1001/jama.2010.158|pmc=2918907}}</ref>

===Intravenous fluids===
In EGDT, fluids are titrated in response to [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]], and urine output; restoring large fluid deficits can require 6 to 10L of [[crystalloid solution|crystalloid]]s.<ref name=H46>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Jesse|title=Principles of critical care|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division|location=New York|isbn=0071416404|pages=Chapter 46|edition=3rd ed.}}</ref>  In cases where a [[central venous catheter]] is used to measure blood pressures dynamically, fluids should be administered until the [[central venous pressure]] (CVP) reaches 8–12&nbsp;cm of water (or 10–15&nbsp;cm of water in mechanically ventilated patients). Once these goals are met, the [[mixed venous oxygen saturation]] (SvO2), i.e., the oxygen saturation of venous blood as it returns to the heart as measured at the vena cava, is optimized. If the SvO2 is less than 70%, blood is given to reach a hemoglobin of 10 g/dl and then inotropes are added until the SvO2 is optimized.<ref name=H46/>

===Vasopressors===
Once the person has been sufficiently fluid resuscitated but the [[mean arterial pressure]] is not greater than 65&nbsp;mmHg [[vasopressor]]s are recommended.<ref name=Campaign2008/> While current recommendations suggest either [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) or [[dopamine]],<ref name=Campaign2008/> the former appears safer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=De Backer|first=D|coauthors=Aldecoa, C, Njimi, H, Vincent, JL|title=Dopamine versus norepinephrine in the treatment of septic shock: A meta-analysis.|journal=Critical Care Medicine|date=2012 Mar|volume=40|issue=3|pages=725–30|pmid=22036860|doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e31823778ee}}</ref><ref name="pmid21436167">{{cite journal |author=Vasu TS, Cavallazzi R, Hirani A, Kaplan G, Leiby B, Marik PE |title=Norepinephrine or dopamine for septic shock: systematic review of randomized clinical trials |journal=J Intensive Care Med |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=172–8 |year=2012 |pmid=21436167 |doi=10.1177/0885066610396312}}</ref> If a single pressor is not sufficient in improving the blood pressure, [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) may be added in.<ref name=Campaign2008/>

===Ventilation===
Elective [[tracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]] may be performed to reduce oxygen demand if the SvO2 remains low despite optimization of hemodynamics.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Etomidate]] is not recommended as a medication to help with [[intubation]] in this situation due to concerns of [[adrenal insufficiency]] and increased mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cherfan|first=AJ|coauthors=Arabi, YM; Al-Dorzi, HM; Kenny, LP|title=Advantages and disadvantages of etomidate use for intubation of patients with sepsis.|journal=Pharmacotherapy|date=2012 May|volume=32|issue=5|pages=475–82|pmid=22488264}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=CM|coauthors=Mitchell, AL; Shorr, AF|title=Etomidate is associated with mortality and adrenal insufficiency in sepsis: A meta-analysis.|journal=Critical care medicine|date=2012 Nov|volume=40|issue=11|pages=2945–53|pmid=22971586}}</ref>

=== Steroids ===
The use of [[steroids]] in sepsis is controversial.<ref name=Steroids2012/> During critical illness, a state of [[adrenal insufficiency]] and tissue resistance to [[corticosteroids]] may occur. This has been termed [[critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency]].<ref name="pmid18496365">{{cite journal |pages=1937–49 |doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e31817603ba |title=Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine |year=2008 |last1=Marik |first1=Paul E. |last2=Pastores |first2=Stephen M. |last3=Annane |first3=Djillali |last4=Meduri |first4=G Umberto |last5=Sprung |first5=Charles L. |last6=Arlt |first6=Wiebke |last7=Keh |first7=Didier |last8=Briegel |first8=Josef |last9=Beishuizen |first9=Albertus |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=36 |issue=6 |pmid=18496365}}</ref> Treatment with corticosteroids might be most beneficial in those with [[septic shock]] and early severe [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), whereas its role in others such as those with [[pancreatitis]] or severe [[pneumonia]] is unclear.<ref name="pmid18496365"/> However, the exact way of determining corticosteroid insufficiency remains problematic. It should be suspected in those poorly responding to resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors. [[Cort-stim test|ACTH stimulation testing]] is not recommended to confirm the diagnosis.<ref name="pmid18496365"/> The method of cessation of glucocorticoid drugs is variable, and it is unclear whether they should be weaned or simply stopped abruptly.

=== Activated protein C===
[[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] activated [[protein C]] ([[drotrecogin alpha]]) was originally introduced for severe sepsis (as identified by a high [[APACHE II]] score), where it was thought to confer a survival benefit.<ref name=Campaign2008/> However, subsequent studies showed that it increased adverse events and did not decrease mortality.<ref name=APC2012>{{cite journal|last=Martí-Carvajal|first=AJ|coauthors=Solà, I; Lathyris, D; Cardona, AF|title=Human recombinant activated protein C for severe sepsis.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2012 Mar 14|volume=3|pages=CD004388|pmid=22419295}}</ref> It was removed from sale in 2011.<ref name=APC2012/>

===Neonates ===
[[Neonatal sepsis]] is difficult to diagnose clinically. They may be relatively asymptomatic until hemodynamic and respiratory collapse is imminent. If there is even a remote suspicion of sepsis, they are frequently treated with antibiotics empirically until cultures are sufficiently proven to be negative.

==Prognosis==
Approximately 20–35% of people with severe sepsis and 30–70% of people with septic shock die.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Russel|first=JA|title=The current management of septic shock.|journal=Minerva medica|date=2008 Oct|volume=99|issue=5|pages=431–58|pmid=18971911}}</ref> Lactate is a useful method of determining prognosis with those who have a level greater than 4&nbsp;mmol/L having a mortality of 40% and those with a level of less than 2&nbsp;mmol/L have a mortality of less than 15%.<ref name=Soong2012/>

There are a number of prognostic stratification systems such as [[APACHE II]] and Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis. APACHE II factors in the person's age, underlying condition, and various physiologic variables can yield estimates of the risk of dying of severe sepsis. Of the individual covariates, the severity of underlying disease most strongly influences the risk of death. Septic shock is also a strong predictor of short- and long-term mortality. Case-fatality rates are similar for culture-positive and culture-negative severe sepsis. The Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score is simpler and useful in the emergency department environment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=CR|coauthors=Keim, SM; Upadhye, S; Nguyen, HB; Best Evidence in Emergency Medicine Investigator, Group|title=Risk stratification of the potentially septic patient in the emergency department: the Mortality in the Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) score.|journal=The Journal of emergency medicine|date=2009 Oct|volume=37|issue=3|pages=319–27|pmid=19427752}}</ref>

Some people may experience severe long-term cognitive decline following an episode of severe sepsis, but the absence of baseline neuropsychological data in most sepsis patients makes the incidence of this difficult to quantify or to study.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=JC|coauthors=Hopkins, RO; Miller, RR; Gordon, SM; Wheeler, AP; Ely, EW|title=Acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and cognitive decline: a review and case study.|journal=Southern medical journal|date=2009 Nov|volume=102|issue=11|pages=1150–7|pmid=19864995}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Sepsis causes millions of deaths globally each year.<ref name=Campaign2008/> In the [[United States]] sepsis affects approximately 3 in 1000 people<ref name=Soong2012/> and severe sepsis contributes to more than 200,000 deaths per year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Longo|first=Dan|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0071748896|edition=18th ed.|page=Chapter 271}}</ref> Due to its rarely being reported as a primary diagnosis (often being a complication of cancer or other illnesses), the incidence, mortality, and morbidity rates are likely underestimated.<ref name=Critical2005/> It is the second-leading cause of death in non-coronary [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) patients, and the tenth-most-common cause of death overall according to data from the (the first being heart disease).<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1546–54 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa022139 |title=The Epidemiology of Sepsis in the United States from 1979 through 2000 |year=2003 |last1=Martin |first1=Greg S. |last2=Mannino |first2=David M. |last3=Eaton |first3=Stephanie |last4=Moss |first4=Marc |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=348 |issue=16 |pmid=12700374}}</ref> Children under 12 months and elderly have the highest incidence of severe sepsis.<ref name=Critical2005/> It occurs in 1–2% of all hospitalizations and accounts for as much as 25% of ICU bed utilization.

==History==
Though severe systemic toxicity was observed prior, it was only in the 19th century that a specific term - sepsis - was coined for this condition. By the end of the 19th century, it was widely believed that microbes produced substances that could injure the mammalian host and that soluble toxins released during infection caused the fever and shock that were commonplace during severe infections. [[Richard Friedrich Johannes Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]] coined the term [[endotoxin]] at the beginning of the 20th century to denote the pyrogenic principle associated with ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. It was soon realised that endotoxins were expressed by most and perhaps all Gram negative organisms. The lipopolysaccharide character of enteric endotoxins was elucidated in the 1944 by Shear.<ref name=Shear1944>Shear MJ (1944) Chemical treatment of tumors, IX: reactions of mice with primary subcutaneous tumors to injection of a hemorrhage-producing bacterial polysaccharide. J Natl Canc Inst 4: 461-476 </ref> The molecular character of this material was determined by Luderitz ''et al'' in 1973.<ref name=Luderitz1973>{{cite journal | author = Luderitz O | year = 1973 | title = Lipid A: chemical structure and biologic activity | url = | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 128 | issue = | page = 29 | author-separator = , | author2 = Galanos C | author3 = Lehmann V }}</ref> 

It was discovered in 1965 that a strain of C3H/HeJ [[mouse|mice]] were immune to the endotoxin induced shock.<ref name=Heppner1965>{{cite journal | author = Heppner G, Weiss DW | year = 1965 | title = High susceptibility of strain A mice to endotoxin and endotoxin-red blood cell mixtures | url = | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 90 | issue = 3| pages = 696–703 | pmid = 16562068 | pmc = 315712 }}</ref> The genetic locus for this effect was dubbed ''Lps''. These mice were also found to be hypersusceptible to infection by Gram negative bacteria.<ref name=O>{{cite journal | author = O'Brien AD | year = 1980 | title = Genetic control of susceptibility to ''Salmonella typhimurium'' in mice: role of the LPS gene | url = | journal = J Immunol | volume = 124 | issue = 1| pages = 20–24 | author-separator = , | author2 = Rosenstreich DL | author3 = Scher I | display-authors = 3 | pmid = 6985638 | last4 = Campbell | first4 = GH | last5 = MacDermott | first5 = RP | last6 = Formal | first6 = SB }}</ref> These observations were finally linked in 1998 by the discovery of the [[Toll-like receptor]] gene 4 (TLR 4).<ref name=Poltorak1998>Poltorak A, Smirnova I, He XL ''et al'' (1998) Genetic and physical mapping of the Lps locus-identification of the toll-4 receptor as a candidate gene in the critical region. Blood Cells Mol Dis 24: 340-355</ref> Genetic mapping work, performed over a period of 5 years, showed that TLR4 was the sole candidate locus within the Lps critical region strongly implying that a mutation within TLR4 must account for the lipopolysaccharide resistance phenotype. The defect in the TLR4 gene that led to the endotoxin resistant phenotype was discovered to be due to a mutation in the cytoplasmic domain.<ref name=Poltorak1998>{{cite journal | author = Poltorak A | year = 1998 | title = Defective LPS signaling in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice: mutations in Tlr4 gene | url = | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5396| pages = 2085–2088 | author-separator = , | author2 = He X | author3 = Smirnova I | display-authors = 3 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5396.2085 | pmid = 9851930 | last4 = Liu | first4 = MY | last5 = Van Huffel | first5 = C | last6 = Du | first6 = X | last7 = Birdwell | first7 = D | last8 = Alejos | first8 = E | last9 = Silva | first9 = M }}</ref>

==Society and culture==
A large international collaboration was established to educate people about sepsis and to improve patient outcomes with sepsis, entitled the "[[Surviving Sepsis Campaign]]". The Campaign has published an evidence-based review of management strategies for severe sepsis, with the aim to publish a complete set of guidelines in subsequent years.<ref name=Campaign2008/>

In 2012, a paper was published raising concerns regarding the use of [[hydroxyethyl starch]] in sepsis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perner|first=A|coauthors=Haase, N; Guttormsen, AB; Tenhunen, J; Klemenzson, G; Åneman, A; Madsen, KR; Møller, MH; Elkjær, JM; Poulsen, LM; Bendtsen, A; Winding, R; Steensen, M; Berezowicz, P; Søe-Jensen, P; Bestle, M; Strand, K; Wiis, J; White, JO; Thornberg, KJ; Quist, L; Nielsen, J; Andersen, LH; Holst, LB; Thormar, K; Kjældgaard, AL; Fabritius, ML; Mondrup, F; Pott, FC; Møller, TP; Winkel, P; Wetterslev, J; 6S Trial, Group; Scandinavian Critical Care Trials, Group|title=Hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.42 versus Ringer's acetate in severe sepsis.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=2012 Jul 12|volume=367|issue=2|pages=124–34|pmid=22738085}}</ref> The pharmaceutical company, [[Fresenius Kabi]], that makes the product is threatening to bring legal action against the author, Anders Perner, as they disagree with the results.<ref name=Newpaper2012>{{cite news|last=Wojcik|first=Jeppe|title=Pharma giant threatens Danish scientist|url=http://sciencenordic.com/pharma-giant-threatens-danish-scientist|accessdate=13 August 2012|newspaper=ScienceNordic|date=July 24, 2012}}</ref> The academic community has raised concerns regarding this sort of behavior by a corporation.<ref name=Newpaper2012/>
