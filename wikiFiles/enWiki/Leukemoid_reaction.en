The term '''leukemoid reaction''' describes an elevated [[white blood cell]] count, or [[leukocytosis]], that is a physiological response to stress or infection (as opposed to a primary blood [[Cancer|malignancy]], such as [[leukemia]]).

It may be [[lymphoid]] or [[myeloid]].<ref name="HannSmith2006">{{cite book|author1=Ian M. Hann|author2=Owen P.

==Definition and diagnosis==

Conventionally, a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm<sup>3</sup> with a significant increase in early [[neutrophil]] precursors is referred to as a leukemoid reaction.<ref>{{cite book | author = Ronald Hoffman et al. | title = Hematology: basic principles and practice | publisher = Elsevier Churchill Livingstone | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-443-06628-0}} p. 803.</ref> The peripheral blood smear may show [[myelocyte]]s, [[metamyelocyte]]s, [[promyelocyte]]s, and rarely [[myeloblasts]]; however, there is a mix of early mature neutrophil precursors, in contrast to the immature forms typically seen in [[acute leukemia]].  Serum leukocyte [[alkaline phosphatase]] is normal or elevated in leukemoid reaction, but is depressed in [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]]. The [[bone marrow]] in a leukemoid reaction, if [[bone marrow biopsy|examined]], may be hypercellular but is otherwise typically unremarkable.

Leukemoid reactions are generally benign and are not dangerous in and of themselves, although they are often a response to a significant disease state (see ''Causes'' below). However, leukemoid reactions can resemble more serious conditions such as [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML), which can present with identical findings on peripheral blood smear.

Historically, various clues including the [[leukocyte alkaline phosphatase]] score and the presence of [[basophilia]] were used to distinguish CML from a leukemoid reaction. However, at present the test of choice in adults to distinguish CML is an assay for the presence of the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], either via [[cytogenetics]] and [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]], or via [[PCR]] for the BCR/ABL fusion gene. The LAP (Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase) score is high in reactive states but is low in CML.  In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, a qualified [[hematologist]] or [[oncologist]] should be consulted.

==Causes of leukemoid reaction==

As noted above, a leukemoid reaction is typically a response to an underlying medical issue. Causes of leukemoid reactions include:
* [[Hemorrhage]]
* Drugs
** Use of Sulfa drugs 
** Use of [[Dapsone]]
** Use of [[glucocorticoid]]s
** Use of [[G-CSF]] or related growth factors
** [[All-trans retinoic acid]] (ATRA)
* Infections
** [[Clostridium difficile]]
** [[Tuberculosis]]
** [[Pertussis]]
** [[Infectious mononucleosis]] ([[lymphocyte]] predominant)
** Visceral Larva Migrans ([[eosinophil]] predominant)
* [[Asplenia]]
* [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]]
* Organ necrosis
** Hepatic necrosis
** [[Ischemic colitis]]
* As a feature of [[Trisomy 21]] in infancy (incidence of ~10%)
* As a [[paraneoplastic phenomenon]] (rare)
