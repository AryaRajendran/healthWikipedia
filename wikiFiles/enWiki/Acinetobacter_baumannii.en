'''''Acinetobacter baumannii''''' is a [[Gram negative]] [[bacteria]]. It is typically a short, almost round, rod-shape ([[coccobacillus]]). It can be an [[opportunistic pathogen]] in humans, affecting people with compromised immune systems and is becoming increasingly important as a hospital derived infection ([[nosocomial]]). It has also been isolated from soil and water samples in the environment.<ref name="J.

==Virulence Factors and Determinants==
Many microbes, including ''A. baumannii'', have several properties that allow them to be more successful as pathogens. These properties may be [[virulence factor]]s like toxins or toxin delivery systems which directly impact the host cell. They may also be virulence determinants, which are qualities contributing to a microbe's [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] and allow it to survive the host environment but that do not affect the host directly. The following characteristics are just some of the known factors which make ''A. baumannii'' effective as a pathogen.

===AbaR Resistance Islands===
[[Pathogenicity island]]s are relatively common genetic structures in bacterial pathogens that are composed of two or more adjacent genes that increase a pathogen's [[virulence]]. They may contain genes that encode [[toxin]]s, [[coagulase|coagulate blood]], or, as in this case, allow the bacteria to resist antibiotics. AbaR-type resistance islands are typical of MDR ''A. baumannii'', and different variations may be present in a given strain. Each consists of a [[transposon]] backbone of approximately 16.3 Kb that facilitates [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Transposons allow portions of genetic material to be excised from one spot in the genome and integrate into another. This makes horizontal gene transfer of this and similar pathogenicity islands more likely because when genetic material is taken up by a new bacterium, the transposons allow the pathogenicity island to integrate into the new microorganism's genome. In this case, it would grant the new microorganism the potential to resist certain antibiotics. AbaRs contain several genes for antibiotic resistance all flanked by [[insertion sequence]]s. These genes provide resistance to [[aminoglycosides]], [[aminocyclitol]]s, [[tetracycline]], and [[chloramphenicol]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seputiene|first=V.|coauthors=Povilonis, J.; Suziedeliene, E.|title=Novel Variants of AbaR Resistance Islands with a Common Backbone in Acinetobacter baumannii Isolates of European Clone II|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|date=30 January 2012|volume=56|issue=4|pages=1969–1973|doi=10.1128/AAC.05678-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Post|first=V|coauthors=White, PA; Hall, RM|title=Evolution of AbaR-type genomic resistance islands in multiply antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.|journal=The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy|date=2010 Jun|volume=65|issue=6|pages=1162–70|doi=10.1093/jac/dkq095|pmid=20375036}}</ref>

===Beta-lactamase===
''A. baumannii'' has been shown to produce at least one [[beta-lactamase]], which is an enzyme responsible for cleaving the four atom lactam ring typical of [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s. Beta-lactam antibiotics are structurally related to [[penicillin]], which inhibits synthesis of the bacterial [[cell wall]]. By cleaving the lactam ring, these antibiotics are rendered harmless to the bacteria. The beta-lactamase, OXA-235, was found to be flanked by insertion sequences, suggesting it was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Higgins|first=PG|coauthors=Pérez-Llarena, FJ; Zander, E; Fernández, A; Bou, G; Seifert, H|title=OXA-235, a novel Class D Beta-Lactamase Involved in Resistance to Carbapenems in Acinetobacter baumannii.|journal=Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy|date=2013 Feb 25|pmid=23439638}}</ref>

===Biofilm Formation===
''A. baumannii'' has been noted for its apparent ability to survive on artificial surfaces for an extended period of time therefore allowing it to persist in the hospital environment. This is thought to be due to its ability to form [[biofilm]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Espinal|first=P|coauthors=Martí, S; Vila, J|title=Effect of biofilm formation on the survival of Acinetobacter baumannii on dry surfaces.|journal=The Journal of hospital infection|date=2012 Jan|volume=80|issue=1|pages=56–60|pmid=21975219}}</ref>  For many biofilm-forming bacteria, the process is mediated by flagella. However for ''A. baumannii'' this process seems to be mediated by pili. Further, disruption of the putative pili chaperone and usher genes ''csuC'' and ''csuE'' were shown to inhibit biofilm formation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tomaras|first=AP|coauthors=Dorsey, CW; Edelmann, RE; Actis, LA|title=Attachment to and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces by Acinetobacter baumannii: involvement of a novel chaperone-usher pili assembly system.|journal=Microbiology (Reading, England)|date=2003 Dec|volume=149|issue=Pt 12|pages=3473–84|pmid=14663080}}</ref> The formation of biofilms has been shown to alter the metabolism of microorganisms within the biofilm consequently reducing their sensitivity to antibiotics. This may be due to the fact that less nutrients are available deeper within the biofilm. A slower metabolism can prevent the bacteria from uptaking an antibiotic or performing a vital function fast enough for particular antibiotics to have an effect. They also provide a physical barrier against larger molecules and may prevent dessication of the bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Worthington|first=RJ|coauthors=Richards, JJ; Melander, C|title=Small molecule control of bacterial biofilms.|journal=Organic & biomolecular chemistry|date=2012 Oct 7|volume=10|issue=37|pages=7457–74|pmid=22733439}}</ref><ref name="J. Yeom" />

===Capsule===
Many virulent bacteria possess the ability to generate a protective [[Bacterial capsule|capsule]] around each individual cell. This capsule is made of long chains of sugars and provides an extra physical barrier between antibiotics, [[Antibody|antibodies]], and [[Complement system|complement]]. The association of increased virulence with presence of a capsule was classically demonstrated in [[Griffith's experiment]].A gene cluster responsible for secretion of the polysaccharide capsule has been identified and shown to inhibit the antibiotic effect of complement when grown on [[ascites]] fluid. A decrease in killing associated with loss of capsule production was then demonstrated using a rat virulence model.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kleinman|first=HK|coauthors=McGarvey, ML; Hassell, JR; Star, VL; Cannon, FB; Laurie, GW; Martin, GR|title=Basement membrane complexes with biological activity.|journal=Biochemistry|date=1986 Jan 28|volume=25|issue=2|pages=312–8|pmid=2937447}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Luke|first=NR|coauthors=Sauberan, SL; Russo, TA; Beanan, JM; Olson, R; Loehfelm, TW; Cox, AD; St Michael, F; Vinogradov, EV; Campagnari, AA|title=Identification and characterization of a glycosyltransferase involved in Acinetobacter baumannii lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis.|journal=Infection and immunity|date=2010 May|volume=78|issue=5|pages=2017–23|pmid=20194587}}</ref>

===Efflux Pumps===
[[Efflux_(microbiology)#Bacterial_efflux_pumps|Efflux pumps]] are [[protein]] machines that use energy to pump antibiotics and other small molecules that get into the bacterial [[cytoplasm]] out of the cell. By constantly pumping antibiotics out of the cell, bacteria can increase the concentration of a given antibiotic that is required to kill them or inhibit their growth when the target of the antibiotic is inside the bacterium. ''A. baumannii'' is known to have two major efflux pumps which decrease its susceptibility to antimicrobials. The first, AdeB, has been shown to be responsible for aminoglycoside resistance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Magnet|first=S|coauthors=Courvalin, P; Lambert, T|title=Resistance-nodulation-cell division-type efflux pump involved in aminoglycoside resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii strain BM4454.|journal=Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy|date=2001 Dec|volume=45|issue=12|pages=3375–80|pmid=11709311}}</ref> The second, AdeDE, is responsible for efflux of a wide range of substrates including tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and various carbapenems.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chau|first=SL|coauthors=Chu, YW; Houang, ET|title=Novel resistance-nodulation-cell division efflux system AdeDE in Acinetobacter genomic DNA group 3.|journal=Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy|date=2004 Oct|volume=48|issue=10|pages=4054–5|pmid=15388479}}</ref>

===OmpA===
[[Bacterial adhesin|Adhesion]] can be a critical determinant of virulence for bacteria. The ability to attach to host cells allows bacteria to interact with them in various ways, whether by [[Type three secretion system|type III secretion system]] or simply by holding on against the prevailing movement of fluids. Outer membrane protein A has been shown to be involved in the adherence of ''A. baumannii'' to epithelial cells. This allows the bacteria to invade the cells through the zipper mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=CH|coauthors=Lee, JS; Lee, YC; Park, TI; Lee, JC|title=Acinetobacter baumannii invades epithelial cells and outer membrane protein A mediates interactions with epithelial cells.|journal=BMC microbiology|date=2008 Dec 10|volume=8|pages=216|pmid=19068136}}</ref> The protein was also shown to localize to the [[mitochondria]] of epithelial cells and cause necrosis by stimulating the production of [[Reactive Oxygen Species|ROS]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=JS|coauthors=Choi, CH; Kim, JW; Lee, JC|title=Acinetobacter baumannii outer membrane protein A induces dendritic cell death through mitochondrial targeting.|journal=Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)|date=2010 Jun|volume=48|issue=3|pages=387–92|pmid=20571958}}</ref>

==Course of Treatment for Infection==
Because most infections are now multidrug resistant, it is necessary to determine what susceptibilities the particular strain has for treatment to be successful. Traditionally, infections were treated with [[imipenem]] or [[meropenem]], but there has been a steady rise in [[carbapenem]] resistant ''A. baumannii''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Su|first=CH|coauthors=Wang, JT; Hsiung, CA; Chien, LJ; Chi, CL; Yu, HT; Chang, FY; Chang, SC|title=Increase of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection in acute care hospitals in Taiwan: association with hospital antimicrobial usage.|journal=PloS one|year=2012|volume=7|issue=5|pages=e37788|pmid=22629456}}</ref> Consequently, treatment methods often fall back on [[polymixins]], particularly [[colistin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abbo|first=A|coauthors=Navon-Venezia, S; Hammer-Muntz, O; Krichali, T; Siegman-Igra, Y; Carmeli, Y|title=Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.|journal=Emerging infectious diseases|date=2005 Jan|volume=11|issue=1|pages=22–9|pmid=15705318}}</ref> Colistin is considered a drug of last resort because it often causes kidney damage among other side effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spapen|first=H|coauthors=Jacobs, R; Van Gorp, V; Troubleyn, J; Honoré, PM|title=Renal and neurological side effects of colistin in critically ill patients.|journal=Annals of intensive care|date=2011 May 25|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14|pmid=21906345}}</ref> Prevention methods in hospitals focus on increased hand washing and more diligent sterilization procedures.<ref>{{cite web|title=Acinetobacter in Healthcare Settings|url=http://www.cdc.gov/HAI/organisms/acinetobacter.html|publisher=CDC|accessdate=4/8/2013}}</ref>

==Occurrence in Veterans Injured in Iraq and Afghanistan==
Soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are at risk for traumatic injury due to gunfire and [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs). Previously it was thought that infection occurred due to contamination with ''A. baumannii'' at the time of injury. Subsequent studies have shown that although ''A. baumannii'' may be infrequently isolated from the natural environment, it is much more likely that the infection is nosocomially acquired. This result is likely due to the ability of ''A. baumannii'' to persist on artificial surfaces for extended periods, and also the multiple facilities injured soldiers are exposed to during the casualty evacuation process. What a soldier is injured, he or she is first taken to level I facilities where the patient is stabilized. Depending on the severity of the injury, the soldier may then be transferred to a level II facility which consists of a forward surgical team for additional stabilization. Depending on the logistics of the locality, the injured soldier may transfer between these facilities several times before finally being taken to a major hospital within the combat zone (level III). Generally after 1–3 days when the patient is stabilized, they are transferred by air to a regional facility (level IV) for additional treatment. For soldiers serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, this is typically [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] in Germany. Finally, the injured soldier is transferred to hospitals in their home country for rehabilitation and additional treatment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Army Medical Logistics|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/fm4_02x1.pdf|work=FM 4-02.1|publisher=United States|accessdate=4/8/2013}}</ref>  This repeated exposure to many different medical environments seems to be the reason ''A. baumannii'' infections have become increasingly common. Multidrug resistant ''A. baumannii'' is a major factor in complicating the treatment and rehabilitation of injured soldiers, and has led to additional deaths.<ref name="MK O'Shea" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Meghoo|first=CA|coauthors=Dennis, JW; Tuman, C; Fang, R|title=Diagnosis and management of evacuated casualties with cervical vascular injuries resulting from combat-related explosive blasts.|journal=Journal of vascular surgery|date=2012 May|volume=55|issue=5|pages=1329-36; discussion 1336-7|pmid=22325667}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=CK|title=Epidemiology of infections associated with combat-related injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan.|journal=The Journal of trauma|date=2008 Mar|volume=64|issue=3 Suppl|pages=S232-8|pmid=18316967}}</ref>

==Incidence of ''A. baumannii'' in Hospitals==
The importation of ''A. baumannii'' and subsequent presence in hospitals has been well documented.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=A|coauthors=Morgan, D; Walsh, A; Turton, J; Livermore, D; Pitt, T; Green, A; Gill, M; Mortiboy, D|title=Importation of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp infections with casualties from Iraq.|journal=The Lancet infectious diseases|date=2006 Jun|volume=6|issue=6|pages=317–8|pmid=16728314}}</ref>  ''A. baumannii'' is usually introduced into a hospital by a colonized patient. Due to it's ability to survive on artificial surfaces and resist dessication, it can remain and possibly infect new patients for some time. It is suspected that ''A baumannii'' is is selected for in hospital settings due to the constant use of antibiotics by patients in the hospital.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dijkshoorn|first=L|coauthors=Nemec, A; Seifert, H|title=An increasing threat in hospitals: multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.|journal=Nature reviews.
