'''Growth hormone treatment''' refers to the use of [[growth hormone]] (GH) as a [[prescription medication]] - it is one form of [[Hormone therapy]]. Growth hormone is a [[peptide hormone]] secreted by the [[pituitary]] gland that stimulates [[Cell growth|growth]] and [[cell (biology)|cell]] reproduction. In the past, growth hormone was extracted from human pituitary glands. GH is now produced by [[recombinant DNA]] technology and is prescribed for a variety of reasons. GH therapy has been a focus of social and ethical controversies for 50 years.

This article describes the history of GH treatment, current uses and risks arising from GH use. Other articles describe [[growth hormone|GH physiology]], diseases of GH excess ([[acromegaly]] and [[gigantism|pituitary gigantism]]), [[growth hormone deficiency|deficiency]], the recent phenomenon of [[HGH controversies]], [[growth hormone in sports]], and [[bovine somatotropin|growth hormone for cows]].

==Medical uses==
===HGH deficiency in children===
[[Growth hormone deficiency]] is treated by replacing GH.<ref name="Humatrope Label">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019640s068lbl.pdf</ref><ref name="Nutropin Label">http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/opportunistic/nutropin/insert.jsp</ref><ref name="Genotropin Label">http://www.pfizer.com/files/products/uspi_genotropin.pdf</ref>  All GH prescribed in North America, Europe, and most of the rest of the world is a human GH, manufactured by [[recombinant DNA technology]]. As GH is a large peptide molecule, it must be injected into subcutaneous tissue or muscle to get it into the blood. Nearly painless [[insulin]] [[syringe]]s make this less trying than is usually anticipated, but perceived discomfort is a subjective value.

When treated with GH, a deficient child will begin to grow faster within months. Other benefits may be noticed, such as increased strength, progress in [[motor development]], and reduction of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. Side-effects of this type of physiologic replacement are quite rare. Known risks and unsettled issues are discussed below, but GH-deficient children receiving replacement doses are at the lowest risk for problems. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}.

Still, costs of treatment in terms of money, effort, and perhaps [[quality of life]] are substantial. Treatment of children usually involves daily injections of growth hormone, usually for as long as the child is growing. Lifelong continuation may be recommended for those most severely deficient as adults. Most [[pediatric endocrinologist]]s monitor growth and adjust dose every 3–4 months. Assessing the psychological value of treatment is difficult, but most children and families are enthusiastic once the physical benefits begin to be seen. Treatment costs vary by country and by size of child, but $US 10,000 to 30,000 a year is common.

Little except the cost of treating severely deficient children is controversial, and most children with severe growth hormone deficiency in the developed world are offered treatment. Most accept. The story is very different for adult deficiency.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===HGH deficiency in adults===
[[The Endocrine Society]] has recommended that adult patients diagnosed with grown hormone deficiency (GHd) be administered an individualized GH treatment regimen.<ref name=EndocSoc>Molitch ME et al. (2011) [http://www.endo-society.org/guidelines/upload/Evaluation-treatment-of-Adult-Growth-Hormone-Deficiency-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-NonCME.pdf Evaluation and Treatment of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency:An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline] The Endocrine Society, 2011.  First published in Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 96(6):1587–1609.</ref>  With respect to diagnosis, their guidelines state that "adults patients with structural hypothalamic/pituitary disease, surgery or irradiation in these areas, head trauma, or evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies be considered for evaluation for acquired GHd" and that "idiopathic GHd in adults is very rare, and stringent criteria are necessary to make this diagnosis. Because in the absence of suggestive clinical circumstances there is a significant false-positive error rate in the response to a single GH stimulation test, we suggest the use of two tests before making this diagnosis."<ref name=EndocSoc/>

Reports have indicated increase of growth rate (especially in the first year of treatment) and a variety of other positive effects, including improved body composition (higher muscle mass, lower fat mass); improved weight management; increased energy and physical activity; improved strength, agility, and endurance; and improved respiratory function. The Prader-Willi Syndrome Association (USA) recommends that a sleep study be conducted before initiating GH treatment in a child with PWS.  At this time there is no direct evidence of a causative link between growth hormone and the respiratory problems seen in PWS (among both those receiving and those not receiving GH treatment), including sudden death.  A follow-up sleep study after one year of GH treatment may also be indicated.  GH (specifically Pfizer's version, Genotropin) is the only treatment that has received an FDA indication for children with PWS.  The FDA indication only applies to children.<ref name="Genotropin Label" />

* Children short because of [[intrauterine growth retardation]] are small for gestational age at birth for a variety of reasons. If early [[catch-up growth]] does not occur and their heights remain below the third percentile by 2 or 3 years of age, adult height is likely to be similarly low.

These boys and girls appeared to be headed toward heights of less than 63" (160&nbsp;cm) and 59" (150&nbsp;cm) respectively. They were treated for about 4 years and gained {{Convert|1.5|–|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} in adult height. Controversy has arisen as to whether all of these children were truly "short normal" children, since the average [[IGF1]] was low.

==Research==

Everything discussed in this section involves either studies to see if GH could be useful for other diseases or conditions, or off-label uses that doctors have developed in the course of their daily work.  None of the uses described below have been approved by the FDA.

Some of the uses that have been explored relate to stunted growth due to various disorders. 

Post-transplant growth failure sometimes improves with GH. Many children who suffer from chronic renal, [[liver]], and [[heart]] disease grow poorly for years before a [[Organ transplant|transplant]] is required (or available). While growth may improve after correction of organ function by successful transplantation, the [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] drugs taken to protect the transplanted organ may continue to interfere with growth. Growth hormone may help offset these effects and is sometimes offered in these circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

X-linked [[hypophosphatemic rickets]] is an inherited disorder of [[phosphorus]] metabolism that results in growth failure and [[rickets]]. GH has been shown to accelerate growth modestly.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Inflammatory bowel disease]] (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) can impair growth before producing obvious bowel symptoms. Children with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[Crohn's disease]] have often GH and [[IGF-I]] deficiency and /or GH resistance.<ref name="pmid20184596">{{cite journal | author = Wong SC, Smyth A, McNeill E, Galloway PJ, Hassan K, McGrogan P, Ahmed SF | title = The growth hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 axis in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease and growth retardation | journal = Clin.

Stunted growth can be a result of Coeliac Disease damaging the intestines and preventing proper nutrient absorption. Treatment involves a gluten-free diet. HGH treatment has been used in an attempt to recover lost growth due to this effect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  A study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that HGH might be a beneficial treatment for patients with Crohn's disease.<ref name="pmid10833209">{{cite journal | author = Slonim AE, Bulone L, Damore MB, Goldberg T, Wingertzahn MA, McKinley MJ | title = A preliminary study of growth hormone therapy for Crohn's disease | journal = N.

Poor growth is a part of [[Noonan syndrome]] and many other genetic [[syndrome]]s. Many short children with various syndromes have been treated with GH. As a broad generalization, GH for several years usually produces faster growth, and perhaps {{Convert|1|-|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} of extra adult height.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Small numbers of children with various forms of bone dysplasia ([[dwarfism]] in common parlance) have been treated with GH with modest increases in short-term height velocity. No long-term studies have demonstrated increased adult height, and dwarfism due to bone dysplasia remains the prime example of extreme shortness considered ''not'' very amenable to GH treatment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

On occasion, GH has been used for other purposes than accelerating growth or replacing deficiency. Nearly every hormone available for administration has been given to non-deficient people in hope of obtaining improvement for various conditions for which other treatments are unsatisfactory. With a few exceptions, benefits are modest and side-effect risk is higher. Experience with GH has yielded the same results. The following is not an exclusive list.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Other scientists have explored whether hGH treatment could be useful in adults that are not severely deficient in GH.

GH has been given to attempt to promote healing of large [[burn (injury)|burns]] by reducing the amount of protein breakdown during the early post-injury period.

GH has been used as an adjunct to caloric restriction to attempt to treat [[obesity]]. GH promotes [[lipolysis]] and reduces [[proteolysis]]. It was hoped that GH would reduce muscle breakdown without interfering with use and reduction of fat as the body shifted to a near-[[starvation]] economy. Results showed potential benefit, but this has not been widely adopted for a variety of reasons (cost, injections, potential aggravation of [[insulin resistance]], etc.). Recent studies suggest that side-effects, in particular, insulin resistance, may outweigh the potential benefits of such therapy.<ref name="pmid17519313" />

[[Fibromyalgia]] and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] are poorly understood and vaguely defined conditions with overlapping features. After demonstration of disordered GH secretion and higher rates of tissue breakdown in patients with these conditions, a few people tried growth hormone treatment to see whether energy or healing could be improved. Disturbances of GH secretion may be secondary phenomena and not causal. Despite anecdotal reports of improvement, no large, controlled trials have demonstrated significant, persistent improvement, and GH is not a common or standard treatment for either condition.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

GH has been illegally taken by athletes wanting to increase recovery, strength, and power.  Some scientific research has been conducted to determine whether such use could be safe and effective—see [[Growth hormone in sports]].

==Adverse effects==
The New England Journal of Medicine published two editorials in 2003 expressing concern about off-label uses of HGH and the proliferation of advertisements for "HGH-Releasing" dietary supplements, and emphasized that there is no evidence that use of HGH in healthy adults or in geriatric patients is safe and effective - and especially emphasized that risks of long-term HGH treatment are unknown.

==History==
Perhaps the most famous person who exemplified the appearance of untreated congenital [[growth hormone deficiency]] was [[General Tom Thumb|Charles Sherwood Stratton]] (1838–1883), who was exhibited by [[P.T. Barnum]] as [[General Tom Thumb]], and married Lavinia Warren. Pictures of the couple show the typical adult features of untreated severe growth hormone deficiency. Despite the severe shortness, limbs and trunks are proportional.

Like many other nineteenth-century medical terms that lost precise meaning as they gained wider currency, “[[midget]],” as a term for someone with extreme proportional shortness, acquired pejorative connotations and is no longer used in medical contexts.

By the middle of the twentieth century, endocrinologists understood the clinical features of growth hormone deficiency. GH is a protein hormone, like [[insulin]], which had been purified from pig and cow [[pancreas]]es for treatment of type 1 diabetes since the 1920s. However, pig and cow GH did not work at all in humans, due to greater species-to-species variation of molecular structure (i.e., insulin is considered more "evolutionarily conserved" than GH).

===Extraction for treatment===

Extracted growth hormone was used since late 1950s until late 1980s when its use was replaced by recombinant GH.

In the late 1950s, Maurice Raben purified enough GH from human [[pituitary gland]]s to successfully treat a GH-deficient boy. A few endocrinologists began to help parents of severely GH-deficient children to make arrangements with local [[pathologist]]s to collect human pituitary glands after removal at [[autopsy]]. Parents would then contract with a [[biochemistry|biochemist]] to purify enough growth hormone to treat their child. Few families could manage such a complicated undertaking.

In 1960, the [[National Pituitary Agency]] was formed as a branch of the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]]. The purpose of this agency was to supervise the collection of human pituitary glands when autopsies were performed, arrange for large-scale extraction and purification of GH, and distribute it to a limited number of pediatric endocrinologists for treating GH-deficient children under research protocols. Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, France, Israel, and other countries establish similar government-sponsored agencies to collect pituitaries, purify GH, and distribute it for treatment of severely GH-deficient children.

Supplies of this “cadaver growth hormone” were limited, and only the most severely deficient children were treated. From 1963 to 1985 about 7700 children in the U.S. and 27,000 children worldwide were given GH extracted from human pituitary glands to treat severe GH deficiency. Physicians trained in the relatively new specialty of [[pediatric endocrinology]] provided most of this care, but in the late 1960s there were only a hundred of these physicians in a few dozen of the largest university medical centers around the world.

In 1976, physicians became aware that [[Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease]] could be transmitted by [[neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] procedures and [[cornea transplantation]]. CJD is a rapidly fatal [[dementia|dementing disease]] of the brain also known as [[spongiform encephalopathy]], related to “[[mad cow disease]]”.

In 1977, the NPA GH extraction and purification procedure was refined and improved.

A shortage of available cadaver GH worsened in the late 1970s as the autopsy rate in the U.S. declined, while the number of pediatric endocrinologists able to diagnose and treat GH deficiency increased. GH was "rationed." Often, treatment would be stopped when a child reached an arbitrary minimal height, such as {{height|ft=5}}. Children who were short for reasons other than severe GH deficiency were lied to and told that they would not benefit from treatment. Only those pediatric endocrinologists that remained at university medical centers with departments able to support a research program had access to NPA growth hormone.

In the late 1970s, a Swedish pharmaceutical company, Kabi, contracted with a number of hospitals in Europe to buy pituitary glands for the first commercial GH product, Crescormon. Although an additional source of GH was welcomed, Crescormon was greeted with ambivalence by pediatric endocrinologists in the United States. The first concern was that Kabi would begin to purchase pituitaries in the U.S., which would quickly undermine the NPA, which relied on a donation system like blood transfusion. As the number of autopsies continued to shrink, would pathologists sell pituitaries to a higher bidder? The second offense was Kabi-Pharmacia’s marketing campaign, which was directed at [[primary care physician]]s under the slogan, “Now, you determine the need,” implying that the services of a specialist were not needed for growth hormone treatment anymore and that any short child might be a candidate for treatment. Although the Crescormon controversy in the U.S. is long forgotten, Kabi’s pituitary purchase program continued to generate scandal in Europe as recently as 2000.

===Recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH)===
In 1981, the new American corporation Genentech, after collaboration with Kabi, developed and started trials of recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) made by a new technology ([[recombinant DNA technology|recombinant DNA]]) in which human [[gene]]s were inserted into bacteria so that they could produce unlimited amounts of the protein. Because this was new technology, approval was deferred as lengthy safety trials continued over the next four years.

In 1985, four young adults in the U.S. having received NPA growth hormone in the 1960s developed CJD ([[Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease]]). The connection was recognized within a few months, and use of human pituitary GH rapidly ceased. Between 1985 and 2003, a total of 26 cases of CJD occurred in adults having received NPA GH before 1977 (out of 7700), comparable numbers of cases occurred around the world. By 2003 there had been no cases in people who received only GH purified by the improved 1977 methods.

Discontinuation of human cadaver growth hormone led to rapid Food and Drug Administration approval of Genentech’s recombinant human growth hormone, which was introduced in 1985 as '''Protropin''' in the United States. Although this previously scarce commodity was suddenly available in “bucketfuls,” the price of treatment (US$10,000–30,000 per year) was the highest at the time. Genentech justified it by the prolonged research and development investment, [[orphan drug]] status, and a pioneering [[Postmarketing surveillance|post-marketing surveillance]] registry for tracking safety and effectiveness ([[National Cooperative Growth Study]]).

Within a few years, GH treatment had become “big business” in more than one sense. [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] launched a competing natural sequence growth hormone (Humatrope<ref>http://www.humatrope.com/Pages/index.aspx</ref>). Pharmacia (formerly Kabi, now [[Pfizer]]) introduced Genotropin.<ref>http://www.genotropin.com/</ref> [[Novo Nordisk]] introduced Norditropin.<ref>http://www.norditropin-us.com/</ref> [[Serono]] (now EMD Serono) introduced Saizen<ref>http://www.saizenus.com/</ref> and Serostim<ref>http://www.serostim.com/</ref> and Serostim.<ref>http://www.emdserono.com/en/therapies/metabolic_endocrinology/zorbtive/zorbtive.html</ref> Ferring has introduced Zomacton.<ref>http://www.ferring.com/en/therapeutic/endo</ref> Genentech eventually introduced another HGH product, '''Nutropin''',<ref>http://www.nutropin.com/index.jsp</ref> and stopped making Protropin in 2004.  Price competition has begun. Teva, which is primarily a generics company, has introduced Tev-tropin.<ref>http://www.tev-tropin.com/</ref>   Chinese companies have entered the market as well and have introduced more pricing competition: NeoGenica BioScience Ltd. introduced Hypertropin/;<ref>http://www.hypertropin.com/</ref> GeneScience Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has introduced Jintropin;<ref>http://www.jintropin.cn/</ref> Anhui Anke Biotechnology has introduced Ansomone.<ref>http://www.ansomone.com/</ref> (There are reports of a product called Fintropin sold by the Chinese biotech firm, Kexing, but as of December 2011, their website does not report that they produce rHGH.<ref>http://www.sdkexing.com/</ref>)  These are all recombinant human growth hormone products and they have competed with various marketing strategies. Most children with severe deficiency in the developed world are now likely to have access to a pediatric endocrinologist and be diagnosed and offered treatment.

[[Pediatric endocrinology]] became a recognizable specialty in the 1950s, but did not reach board status in the U.S. until the late 1970s. Even 10 years later, as a cognitive, procedureless specialty dealing with mostly rare diseases, it was one of the smallest, lowest-paid, and more obscure of the medical specialities{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Pediatric endocrinologists were the only physicians interested in the arcana of GH metabolism and children’s growth {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, but their previously academic arguments took on new practical significance with major financial implications.

The major scientific arguments dated back to the days of GH scarcity:
* Everyone agrees on the nature and diagnosis of severe [[growth hormone deficiency|GH deficiency]], but what are the edges and variations?
* How should marked [[delayed puberty|constitutional delay]] be distinguished from partial GH deficiency?
* To what extent is “normal [[short stature|shortness]]” a matter of short children naturally making less growth hormone?
* Can a child make GH in response to a stimulation test but fail to make enough in “daily life” to grow normally?
* If a stimulation test is used to define deficiency, what GH cutoff should be used to define normal?

It was the [[bioethics|ethical]] questions that were new. Is GH not a wise use of finite healthcare resources, or is the physician’s primary responsibility to the patient? If GH is given to most extremely short children to make them taller, will the definition of “extremely short” simply rise, negating the expected social benefit? If GH is given to short children whose parents can afford it, will shortness become a permanent mark of lower social origins? More of these issues are outlined in the ethics section. Whole meetings were devoted to these questions; pediatric endocrinology had become a specialty with its own [[bioethics]] issues.

Despite the price, the 1990s became an era of experimentation to see what else growth hormone could help. The medical literature of the decade contains hundreds of reports of small trials of GH use in nearly every type of growth failure and shortness imaginable. In most cases, the growth responses were modest{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. For conditions with a large enough potential market, more rigorous trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that were making growth hormone to achieve approval to market for those specific indications. [[Turner syndrome]] and [[chronic renal failure]] were the first of these “nonGH-deficient causes of shortness” to receive [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for GH treatment, and [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] and [[intrauterine growth retardation]] followed. Similar expansion of use occurred in Europe.

One obvious potential market was adult GH deficiency. By the mid-1990s, several GH companies had sponsored or publicized research into the [[quality of life]] of adults with severe GH deficiency{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. Most were people having been treated with GH in childhood for severe deficiency{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.  Although the injections are painless, many of them had been happy to leave injections behind as they reached final heights in the low-normal range{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. However, as adults in their 30s and 40s, these people, who had been children with growth hormone deficiency, were now adults with growth hormone deficiency and had more than their share of common adult problems: reduced physical, mental, and social energy, excess adipose and diminished muscle, diminished libido, poor bone density, higher cholesterol levels, and higher rates of cardiovascular disease. Research trials soon confirmed that a few months of GH could improve nearly all of these parameters. However, despite marketing efforts, most GH-deficient adults remain untreated.

Though GH use was slow to be accepted among adults with GH deficiency, similar research to see if GH treatment could slow or reverse some of the similar effects of aging attracted much public interest. The most publicized trial was reported by Daniel Rudman in 1990.<ref name="pmid2355952">{{cite journal | author = Rudman D, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA, Lalitha PY, Goldberg AF, Schlenker RA, Cohn L, Rudman IW, Mattson DE | title = Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old | journal = N.

There are always entrepreneurs who do not need much evidence to see a business opportunity. In 1997, Ronald Klatz of the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] published ''Grow Young With HGH: The Amazing Medically Proven Plan To Reverse the Effects Of Aging'',<ref>Ronald Klatz and Carol Kahn.

However, their adoption of the "HGH" term has provided an easy way to distinguish the hype from the evidence.  In 2003, growth hormone hit the news again, when the US FDA granted [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] approval to market Humatrope for the treatment of [[idiopathic short stature]]. The indication was controversial for several reasons, the primary one being the difficulty in defining extreme shortness with normal test results as a disease rather than the extreme end of the normal height range<ref>Leona Cuttler (2005) [http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/90/9/5502.full Editorial: Safety and Efficacy of Growth Hormone Treatment for Idiopathic Short Stature]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 90(9):5502-5504</ref>

Recombinant growth hormone available in the U.S. (and their manufacturers) included ''Nutropin'' ([[Genentech]]), ''Humatrope'' ([[Eli Lilly and Company]]), ''Genotropin'' ([[Pfizer]]), ''Norditropin'' ([[Novo Nordisk]]), ''Tev-Tropin'' ([[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]]) and ''[[Saizen]]'' ([[Merck Serono]]). The products are nearly identical in composition, efficacy, and cost, varying primarily in the formulations and delivery devices.

==Terminology==
'''Growth hormone''' (GH l) is also called somatotropin (British: somatotrophin). The human form of growth hormone is known as human growth hormone, or hGH (ovine growth hormone, or sheep growth hormone, is abbreviated oGH). GH can refer either to the natural hormone produced by the pituitary (somatotropin), or biosynthetic GH for therapy.

'''Cadaver growth hormone''' is the term for GH extracted from human pituitary glands between 1960 and 1985 for therapy of deficient children. In the U.S., cadaver GH, also referred to as '''NPA growth hormone''', was provided by the National Pituitary Agency, and by other national programs and commercial firms as well. In 1985 it was associated with the development of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease]], and was withdrawn from use.

'''rHGH''' refers to [[recombinant DNA technology|recombinant]] human growth hormone (somatropin). Its amino acid sequence is identical with that of endogenous human GH.

It is coincidental that rHGH also refers to rhesus monkey GH, using the accepted naming convention. [[Rhesus]] [[growth hormone]] was never used by physicians to treat human patients, but rhesus GH was part of the lore of the underground [[anabolic steroid]] community in those years, and fraudulent versions may have been bought and sold in gyms.

'''met-GH''' refers to methionyl-growth hormone. This was the first recombinant GH product marketed (Protropin by Genentech). It had the same [[amino acid]] sequence as human GH with an extra [[methionine]] at the end of the chain to facilitate the manufacturing process. It was discontinued in 2004.<ref>http://www.gene.com/gene/about/ir/historical/product-sales/nutropin.html</ref>

'''rBST''' refers to recombinant [[bovine somatropin]] (cow growth hormone), or recombinant bovine GH (rbGH).
