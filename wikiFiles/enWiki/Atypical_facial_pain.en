'''Atypical Facial Pain''' ('''AFP''') has historically been regarded as a pathological condition, including a wide group of [[facial pain]] problems.  Generally, this pain is [[neuropathic]] in presentation, consisting of burning, superficial or deep-aching, stabbing [[pain]]. '''AFP''' may also be described as poorly localized, typically involving the [[nose]], [[eye]], [[cheek]], [[temple]], and [[jaw]]. Some practitioners have assigned this diagnostic label to any condition of facial pain in which pain simultaneously crosses the mid-line of the face, or otherwise fails to fit recognized patterns of other identified facial pain syndromes.  

Predominant age: 30 to 60 years and predominant sex is [[female]].

Some sources have assigned or categorized Atypical Facial Pain as a psycho-somatic manifestation of so-called "Somatiform Symptom Disorder", as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.  However, this categorization is increasingly being seen as inappropriate and actively damaging to patients.  In a recent publication of the Trigeminal Neuralgia Association (TNA), Dr. Peter Jannetta and eleven other serving members of the TNA Medical Advisory Board concurred in the following finding:  

{{Quotation|"The term "atypical facial neuralgia or pain" was a wastebasket term applied by a serious contributor of a former era to a group of patients he did not understand. Many of these patients were our trigeminal neuralgia type 2 patients. It is unfortunate that many of these people were told they had psychological problems. Many developed psychological problems after the fact when told by everyone that such was their problem. Over the years, our areas of ignorance have progressively narrowed.}}

{{Quotation|"A non-pejorative and, hopefully, reasonable term for the ever-narrowing group of undiagnosed face pain problems: Facepain of Obscure Etiology (FOE or POE) to replace atypical facial pain in the Burchiel classification. {{ref|1}}}}

==Signs and Symptoms==

Patient often reports symptoms of [[paresthesia]], [[pain]], and [[throbbing]]. [[Physical examination]] may be normal, but [[hypoesthesia]], [[hyperesthesia]], and [[allodynia]] may be found.

==Tests==

There are presently no accepted medical tests which consistently discriminate between facial pain syndromes or differentiate Atypical Facial Pain from other syndromes.  However, a normal [[Radiograph]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]], and [[MRI]] may help to exclude other pathology such as arterio-veinous malformation, tumor, Temporomandibular Joint Disorder, or MS.

==Differential Diagnosis==

*[[Trigeminal neuralgia]]
*[[Migraine]]
*[[Dental disease]]s
*[[Neoplasia]]
*[[Infection]]

==Treatment==

*[[Analgesics]]
*[[Antidepressants]]
*Centrally acting [[muscle relaxants]]
*[[Anticonvulsants]]
