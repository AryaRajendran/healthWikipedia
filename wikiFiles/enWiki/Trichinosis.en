'''Trichinosis''', also called '''trichinellosis''', or '''trichiniasis''', is a [[parasitic disease]] caused by eating raw or undercooked [[pork]] or [[wild game]] infected with the [[larva]]e of a species of [[roundworm]] ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'', commonly called the [[trichina worm]]. There are eight ''Trichinella'' species; five are encapsulated and three are not.<ref name=one>Pozio, E., & Murrell, D. K. (2006). Systematics and Epidemiology of Trichinella. Advances in Parasitology, 63, 368–439.</ref> Only three ''Trichinella'' species are known to cause trichinosis: ''T. spiralis'', ''T. nativa'', and ''[[Trichinella britovi|T. britovi]]''.<ref name="one"/>

Between 2002 and 2007, 11 cases were reported to CDC each year on average in the United States;<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/trichinellosis/epi.html</ref> these were mostly the result of eating undercooked game, bear meat, or home-reared pigs. It is common in developing countries where meat fed to pigs is raw or undercooked, but many cases also come from developed countries in Europe and North America, where raw or undercooked pork and wild game may be consumed as delicacies.<ref>Gottstein, B et al: "Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Control of Trichinellosis", Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 22(1)127–145. Jan 2009.</ref>

==Agent and taxonomy==

===Agent===
The disease-causing agents include the eight species of ''Trichinella'', but ''T. spiralis'' is the most important to humans due to its worldwide distribution and high pathogenicity.<ref name=three>Pozio E, et al. "Trichinella zimbabwensis n.sp. (Nematoda), a new non-encapsulated species from crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in Zimbabwe also infecting mammals." Int J Parasitol. 2002 Dec 19;32(14):1787–99. < http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12464425>.</ref>

;Species and characteristics
*[[Trichinella spiralis|''T. spiralis'']] is most adapted to swine, most pathogenic in humans and is cosmopolitan in distribution.
*[[Trichinella britovi|''T. britovi'']] is the second most common species to infect humans; it is distributed throughout Europe, Asia, and northern and western Africa usually in wild boar and domesticated pigs.
*[[Trichinella nativa|''T. nativa'']], which has a high resistance to freezing, is found in the Arctic and subarctic regions; reservoir hosts include polar bears, arctic foxes, walruses and other wild game.
*''T. pseudospiralis'' infects birds and mammals, and has demonstrated infection in humans;<ref>Jongwutiwes S et al "First outbreak of human trichinellosis caused by Trichinella pseudospiralis." Clin Infect Dis. 1998 Jan;26(1):111-5.</ref> it is a nonencapsulated species.
*''T. papuae'' infects both mammals and reptiles, including crocodiles, humans, and pigs; this species, found in Papua New Guinea and Thailand, is also nonencapsulated.
*''T. nelsoni'', found in eastern Africa, has been documented to cause a few human cases.
*''T. murrelli'' also infects humans, especially from black bear meat; it is distributed among wild carnivores in North America.
*''T. zimbabwensis'' can infect mammals and possibly humans; this nonencapsulated species was detected in reptiles of Africa.

==History of the discovery==

===Discovery of the parasite===
The circumstances surrounding the first observation and identification of ''Trichinella spiralis'' are controversial due to a lack of medical records. In 1835, [[James Paget]], a first-year medical student, first observed the larval form of ''T. spiralis'' while witnessing an autopsy at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London. Paget took special interest in the presentation of muscle with white flecks, described as a "sandy diaphragm". 

Although Paget is most likely the first person to have noticed and recorded these findings, the parasite was named and published in a report by his professor, [[Richard Owen]], who is now credited for the discovery of the ''T. spiralis'' larval form.<ref>Richard Owen (1835) [http://books.google.com/books?id=Bh0zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA315#v=onepage&q&f=false "Description of a microscopic entozoon infesting the muscles of the human body,"] ''Transactions of the Zoological Society of London'', '''1''' :  315–324.  Paget is mentioned on pages 315 and 320.</ref><ref name=four>Cook GC, "Outbreak of trichinosis (trichiniasis)—contracted in London in 1879" Postgrad Med J 2001;77:62–63</ref>

===Discovery of the life cycle===
A series of experiments conducted between 1850 and 1870 by the German researchers [[Rudolf Virchow]], [[Rudolf Leuckart]] and [[Friedrich Albert von Zenker]], which involved feeding infected meat to a dog and performing the subsequent necropsy, led to the discovery of the life cycle of ''Trichinella''. Through these experiments, Virchow was able to describe the development and infectivity of ''T. spiralis''.<ref>Blumer G. "Some remarks on the early history of Trichinosis (1822–1866)." Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine 1(6)581–588.</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Trichinella larvaeD.jpg|thumb|''Trichinella spiralis'' [[larvae]] in muscle tissue]]
The great majority of trichinosis infections have either minor or no symptoms and no complications.<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/trichinosis/page3.htm]</ref> There are two main phases for the infection: enteral (affecting the intestines) and parenteral (outside the intestines). The symptoms vary depending on the phase, species of ''Trichinella'', amount of encysted larvae ingested, age, gender, and host immunity.<ref name="five"/>

===Enteral phase===
A large burden of adult worms in the intestines promote symptoms such as [[nausea]], [[heartburn]], [[dyspepsia]], and [[diarrhea]] from two to seven days after infection, while small worm burdens generally are asymptomatic. [[Eosinophilia]] presents early and increases rapidly.<ref>Bruschi F, Murrell KD. "New aspects of human trichinellosis: the impact of new Trichinella species." Postgrad Med J 2002;78:15–22 {{doi|10.1136/pmj.78.915.15}},</ref>

===Parenteral phase===
The severity of symptoms caused by larval migration from the intestines depends on the number of larvae produced. As the larvae migrate through tissue and vessels, the body's inflammatory response results in [[edema]], muscle pain, fever, and weakness. A classic sign of trichinosis is [[periorbital edema]], swelling around the eyes, which may be caused by [[vasculitis]]. [[Splinter hemorrhage]] in the nails is also a common symptom.<ref name=eight>John D and William A. Petri. Markell and Voge's Medical Parasitology. 9th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, 2006.</ref>

They may very rarely cause enough damage to produce serious neurological deficits (such as [[ataxia]] or [[respiratory paralysis]]) from worms entering the [[central nervous system]]. The CNS is compromised by trichinosis in 10–24% of reported cases of [[Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis|a rare form of stroke]].<ref name=sixteen>Evans, R.W. & Patter, B.M. (1982) Trichinosis associated with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. Annals of Neurology, 11 (2), 216–217.</ref> Trichinosis can be fatal depending on the severity of the infection; death can occur 4–6 weeks after the infection,<ref name="two"/> and is usually caused by [[myocarditis]], [[encephalitis]], or [[pneumonia]].<ref name="three"/>

==Life cycle==
The typical life cycle for ''T. spiralis'' involves humans, pigs, and rodents. Pigs become infected when they eat infectious cysts in raw meat, often pork or rats ([[sylvatic cycle]]). Humans become infected when they eat raw or undercooked infected pork ([[domestic cycle]]). After humans ingest the [[cyst]]s from infected undercooked meat, pepsin and hydrochloric acid help free the larvae in the cysts in the stomach.<ref name=five>Capo, V. & Despommier, D. D. (1996). Clinical Aspects of Infection with ''Trichinella spp.'' Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 9, 47–54.</ref> The larvae then migrate to the small intestine, where they molt four times before becoming adults.<ref name=five>Capo, V. & Despommier, D. D. (1996). Clinical Aspects of Infection with Trichinella spp. Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 9, 47–54.</ref>

Thirty to 34 hours after the cysts were originally ingested, the adults mate, and within five days produce larvae.<ref name="five"/> The worms can only reproduce for a limited time because the immune system will eventually expel them from the small intestine.<ref name="five"/> The larvae then use their piercing mouthpart, called the "stylet", to pass through the intestinal mucosa and enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the bloodstream.<ref name="four"/>

The larvae travel by capillaries to various organs, such as the retina, myocardium, or lymph nodes; however, only larvae that migrate to skeletal muscle cells survive and encyst.<ref name="two"/> The larval host cell becomes a [[nurse cell]] in which the larvae will be encapsulated. The development of a capillary network around the nurse cell completes encystation of the larvae.

[[Image:Trichinella LifeCycle.gif|Life cycle of ''Trichinella spiralis'']]

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of trichinosis is confirmed by a combination of exposure history, clinical diagnosis, and laboratory testing.

===Exposure history===
An epidemiological investigation can be done to determine a patient's exposure to raw infected meat. Often, an infection arises from home-preparation of contaminated meat, in which case microscopy can be used to determine the infection. However, exposure does not have to be directly from an infected animal. Other exposure includes the consumption of products from a laboratory-confirmed infected animal or by sharing a common exposure as a laboratory-confirmed infected human.<ref name=two>Gottstein B, et al. "Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Control of Trichinellosis." Clinical Microbiology Reviews, January 2009, p. 127-145, Vol. 22, No. 1.</ref>

===Clinical diagnosis===
Clinical presentation of the common trichinosis symptoms may also suggest infection. These symptoms include [[circumorbital edema]], [[splinter hemorrhage]], nonspecific [[gastroenteritis]], and muscle pain.<ref name="two"/> The case definition for trichinosis at the European Center for Disease Control states "at least three of the following six: [[fever]], muscle soreness and pain, [[gastrointestinal]] symptoms, [[facial edema]], [[eosinophilia]], and subconjuctival, subungual, and retinal [[hemorrhages]]." <ref name="two"/>

===Laboratory testing===
Blood tests and [[microscopy]] can be used to aid in the diagnosis of trichinosis. Blood tests include a complete blood count for [[eosinophilia]], [[creatine phosphokinase]] activity, and various immunoassays such as [[ELISA]] for larval antigens.<ref name="two"/>

==Treatment and vaccines==
As is desirable with most diseases, early treatment is better and decreases the risk of developing disease. If larvae do encyst in skeletal muscle cells, they can remain infectious for months to years.<ref name="two"/>

===Primary treatment===
Early administration of [[anthelmintics]], such as [[mebendazole]] or [[albendazole]], decreases the likelihood of larval encystation, particularly if given within three days of infection.<ref name="eight"/> However, most cases are diagnosed after this time.<ref name="two"/>

[[Mebendazole]] (200–400&nbsp;mg three times a day for three days) or [[albendazole]] (400&nbsp;mg twice a day for 8–14 days) are given to treat trichinosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&drugid=4254&drugname=Mebendazole+Misc&monotype=monograph|title=	Monograph – Mebendazole|publisher=medscape.com|accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> These drugs prevent newly hatched larvae from developing, but should not be given to pregnant women or children under two years of age.<ref name="five"/>

===Secondary treatment===
After infection, [[steroids]], such as [[prednisone]] may be used to relieve muscle pain associated with larval migration.

===Vaccine research===
There are currently no vaccines for trichinosis, although experimental mice studies have suggested a possibility. In one study, microwaved ''Trichinella'' larvae were used to immunize mice, which were subsequently infected. Depending on dosage and the frequency of immunization, results ranged from a decreased larval count to complete protection from trichinosis.<ref>Ali SM, et al. "Immunization against trichinellosis using microwaved larvae of Trichinella spiralis." J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 2007 Apr;37(1):121-33.</ref>

Another study, Dea-Ayuela et al. (2006) used extracts and excretory-secretory products from first stage larvae to produce an oral vaccine.<ref name=twelve>Dea-Ayuela, M. A., Iniguz, S.R., Fernandez, F.B. (2006). Vaccination of mice against intestinal Trichinella spiralis infections by oral administration of antigens microencapsulated
in methacrilic acid copolymers. Vaccine, 24, 2772–2780.</ref> To prevent the gastric acids from dissolving the antigens before reaching the small intestine, scientists encapsulated the antigens in a microcapsule made of copolymers. This vaccine significantly increased CD4+ cells and increased antigen-specific serum IgGq and IgA, resulting in a statistically significant reduction in the average number of adult worms in the small intestine of mice. The significance of this approach is that if the white blood cells in the small intestine have been exposed to ''Trichinella'' antigens (through vaccination) then, when an individual gets infected, the immune system will respond to expel the worms from the small intestine fast enough to prevent the female worms from releasing their larvae. Yuan Gu et al. (2008) tested a DNA vaccine on mice which "induced a muscle larvae burden reduction in BALB/c mice by 29% in response to T. spiralis infection".<ref name=thirteen>Gu, Y., Li, J., Zhu, X., Yang, J., Li, Q., Liu, Z., Yu, S., Li, Y. (2008). Trichinella spiralis: Characterization of phage-displayed specific epitopes and their protective immunity in BALB/c mice. Experimental Parasitology, 118, 66–74.</ref> Researchers trying to develop a vaccine for ''Trichinella'' have tried to using either "larval extracts, excretory-secretory antigen, DNA vaccine, or recombinant antigen protein." <ref name="thirteen"/>

==Epidemiology==
As early as 1835, trichinosis was known to have been caused by a parasite, but the mechanism of infection was unclear at the time. A decade later, [[United States|American]] scientist [[Joseph Leidy]] pinpointed undercooked meat as the primary vector for the parasite, and it was not until two decades afterwards that this hypothesis was fully accepted by the scientific community.[http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/other/parasitology.php]

About 11 million individuals are infected with ''Trichinella''; ''Trichinella spiralis'' is the species responsible for most of these infections.<ref>Gideon (1994). Gideon Informatics Inc. Retrieved January 31, 2009, from http://web.gideononline.com/web/epidemiology/?gdn_form=dmlldz1HZW5lcmFsJmRpc2Vhc2U9MTI0MTA=</ref> Infection was once very common, but is now rare in the [[First World|developed world]]. The incidence of trichinosis in the U.S. has decreased dramatically in the past century. From 1997 to 2001, an annual average of 12 cases per year were reported in the United States. The number of cases has decreased because of legislation prohibiting the feeding of raw meat garbage to hogs, increased commercial and home freezing of pork, and the public awareness of the danger of eating raw or undercooked pork products.<ref>

In the [[Third World|developing world]], most infections are associated with undercooked pork. For example, in [[Thailand]], between 200 and 600 cases are reported annually around the [[Thai New Year]]. This is mostly attributable to a particular delicacy, ''[[larb]]'', which calls for undercooked pork as part of the recipe. In parts of Eastern Europe, the World Health Organization ([[WHO]]) reports some swine herds have trichinosis infection rates above 50%, and there are correspondingly large numbers of human infections. [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic612.htm]

===Reemergence===
The disappearance of the pathogen from domestic pigs has led to a relaxation of legislation and control efforts by veterinary public health systems. It has since been thought of as a [[reemerging zoonosis]] supplemented by the increased distribution of meat products, political changes, a changing climate, and increasing [[sylvatic]] transmission.<ref>Murrell KD, Pozio E. "Trichinellosis: the zoonosis that won’t go quietly." International Journal for Parasitology. 30(2000)1339–1349.</ref>

It is also important to keep in mind major socio-political changes can produce conditions that favor the resurgence of ''Trichinella'' infections in swine and, consequently, humans. For instance, "the overthrow of the social and political structures in the 1990s" in Romania led to an increase in the incidence rate of trichinosis.<ref name=seven>Blaga, R., Durand, B., Antoniu, S., Gherman, C., Cretu, C.M., Cozma, V., Boireau, P. (2007). A dramatic increase in the incidence of human trichinellosis in Romania over the past 25 years: impact of political changes and regional food habits. American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 983–986.</ref> There is also a high incidence of trichinosis among refugees from Southeast Asia.<ref name="two"/> China reports approximately 10,000 cases every year, and is therefore the country with the highest numbers of cases.<ref name="two"/> In China, between 1964 and 1998, over 20,000 people were infected with Trichinosis and more than 200 people died.<ref name=six>Gu, Y., Li, J., Zhu, X., Yang, J., Li, Q., Liu, Z., Yu, S. & Li, Y. (2008). Trichinella spiralis: Characterization of phage-displayed specific epitopes and their protective immunity in BALB/c mice. Experimental Parasitology, 118, 66–74.</ref>

The [[kashrut]] and [[halal]] dietary laws of [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] prohibit eating pork. In the 19th century, when the association between trichinosis and undercooked pork was first established, it was suggested that this association was the reason for the prohibition, reminiscent of the earlier opinion of the medieval [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] philosopher [[Maimonides]] that food forbidden by Jewish law was "unwholesome". This theory was controversial and eventually fell out of favor.<ref>pp. 67–70, chapter 4, ''Good to Eat: Riddles of Food and Culture'', Marvin Harris, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1985, ISBN 0-671-50366-9.</ref>

==International Commission on Trichinellosis==
The [[International Commission on Trichinellosis]] (ICT) was created in 1958 in Budapest and is aiming to exchange information on the biology, the physiopathology, the epidemiology, the immunology, and the clinical aspects of trichinellosis in humans and animals. Prevention is a primary goal. Since the creation of the ICT, its members (more than 110 from 46 countries) have regularly gathered and worked together during meetings held every four years : the [[International Conference on Trichinellosis]].

==Prevention==

===Legislation===
Laws and rules required of food producers may improve food safety for consumers, such as the rules established by the [[European Commission]] for inspections, rodent control, and improved hygiene.<ref name="two"/> Similar protocol exists in the United States in the [[USDA]] guidelines for establishment responsibilities in inspecting pork.<ref>United States Department of Agriculture – Food Safety and Inspection Service. "NSS NRTE/RTE Establishment Responsibilities." (2006).</ref>

===Education and training===
Public education about the dangers of consuming raw and undercooked meat, especially pork, may reduce infection rates. Hunters are also an at-risk population due to their contact and consumption of wild game, including bear. As such, many states, such as New York, require the completion of a course in such matters before a hunting license can be obtained.<ref>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation – Hunting Licenses <www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6094.html></ref>

===Food preparation===
Larvae may be killed by the heating or irradiation of raw meat. Freezing is only usually effective for ''T. spiralis'', since other species, such as ''T. nativa'', are freeze resistant and can survive long-term freezing.<ref name="two"/>

*All [[meat]] (including pork) can be safely prepared by cooking to an internal temperature of 165°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (74°[[Celsius|C]]) or more for 15 seconds or more.

*Wild game: Wild game meat must be cooked thoroughly (see [[meat]] preparation above) Freezing wild game does not kill all trichinosis larval worms. This is because the worm species that typically infests wild game can resist freezing.

*[[Pork]]: Freezing cuts of pork less than 6&nbsp;inches thick for 20 days at 5&nbsp;°F (−15&nbsp;°C) or three days at −4&nbsp;°F (−20&nbsp;°C) kills ''T. spiralis'' larval worms; but this will not kill other trichinosis larval worm species, such as ''T. nativa'', if they have infested your pork food supply (which is unlikely).

[[Pork]] can be safely cooked to a slightly lower temperature provided that the internal meat temperature is at least as hot for at least as long as listed in the [[USDA]] table below.<ref name="USDA Title 9 section 318.10 Table">USDA Title 9 section 318.10 Table</ref> Nonetheless, it is prudent to allow a [[margin of error]] for variation in internal temperature within a particular cut of pork, which may have bones that affect temperature uniformity. In addition, your thermometer has measurement error that must be considered. Cook pork for significantly longer and at a higher uniform internal temperature than listed here to be safe.

Unsafe and unreliable methods of cooking meat include the use of microwave ovens, curing, drying, and smoking, as these methods are difficult to standardize and control.<ref name="two"/>

===Hygienic pig farming===
*Cooking all meat fed to pigs or other wild animals
*Keeping pigs in clean pens with floors that can be washed (such as concrete)
*Not allowing hogs to eat uncooked carcasses of other animals, including rats, which may be infected with ''Trichinella''
*Cleaning meat grinders thoroughly when preparing ground meats
*Control and destruction of meat containing [[trichina]]e, e.g., removal and proper disposal of porcine diaphragms prior to public sale of meat
	 
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] makes the following recommendation: "Curing (salting), drying, smoking, or microwaving meat does not consistently kill infective worms."<ref>In addition, out of the reports of trichinosis in the United States, all have been a result of mass produce, particularly in large venues, such as cafeterias and mall food courts.
