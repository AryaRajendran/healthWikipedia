In [[medicine]], a '''chest radiograph''', commonly called a '''chest X-ray''' ('''CXR'''), is a [[Projectional radiography|projection radiograph]] of the [[chest]] used to diagnose conditions affecting the chest, its contents, and nearby structures. Chest radiographs are among the most common films taken, being diagnostic of many conditions.

Like all methods of [[radiography]], chest radiography employs [[ionizing radiation]] in the form of [[X-ray]]s to generate images of the chest. The typical [[radiation]] dose to an adult from a chest radiograph is around 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) for a front (PA) view or 0.04 mSv (4 mrem) for a side (lat) view.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wall|first=B.F.|coauthors=and Hart, D.|title=Revised Radiation Doses for Typical X-Ray Examinations|journal=The British Journal of Radiology|year=1997|volume=70|pages=437–439|url=http://bjr.birjournals.org/content/70/833/437.full.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2012}} (5,000 patient dose measurements from 375 hospitals)</ref><ref>National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. Sources and magnitude of occupational and

Chest radiographs are used to diagnose many conditions involving the chest wall, bones of the [[thorax]], and structures contained within the [[thoracic cavity]] including the [[lung]]s, [[heart]], and [[great vessel]]s. [[Pneumonia]] and [[congestive heart failure]] are very commonly diagnosed by chest radiograph. Chest radiographs are used to screen for job-related lung disease in industries such as mining where workers are exposed to dust.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/blog/nsb060209_chest-radiography.html Using Digital Chest Images to Monitor the Health of Coal Miners and Other Workers]. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</ref>

For some conditions of the chest, radiography is good for screening but poor for diagnosis. When a condition is suspected based on chest radiography, additional imaging of the chest can be obtained to definitively diagnose the condition or to provide evidence in favor of the diagnosis suggested by initial chest radiography.
Unless a fractured rib is suspected of being displaced, and therefore likely to cause damage to the lungs and other tissue structures, x-ray of the chest is not necessary as it will not alter patient management.

The main regions where a chest X-ray may identify problems may be summarized as ''ABCDEF'' by their first letters:<ref>[http://www.medicalmnemonics.com/pdf/2002_06_pack_unabr_a4.pdf medicalmnemonics.com > Chest X-ray interpretation] 2002</ref>

Different views of the chest can be obtained by changing the relative orientation of the body and the direction of the x-ray beams. The most common views are ''posteroanterior'', ''anteroposterior'', and ''lateral''. In an posteroanterior (PA) view, the x-ray source is positioned so that x-rays enter through the posterior (back) aspect of the chest, and exit out of the anterior (front) aspect where they are detected. To obtain this view, individuals stand facing a flat surface behind which is an x-ray detector. A radiation source is positioned behind the patient at a standard distance, and x-ray beams are transmitted toward the patient.

In anteroposterior (AP) views, the positions of the x-ray source and detector are reversed: x-rays enter through the anterior aspect and exit through the posterior aspect of the chest. AP chest x-rays are harder to interpret than PA x-rays and are therefore generally reserved for situations where it is difficult for the patient to obtain a normal chest x-ray, such as when the patient cannot get out of bed.  In this situation, mobile X-ray equipment is used to obtain a lying down chest x-ray (known as a "supine film").  As a result most supine films are also AP.

[[File:Chest labeled.png|thumb|300px|A chest radiograph with the [[Angle (rib)|angle]] parts of the [[rib]]s and some other landmarks labeled.]]
Lateral views of the chest are obtained in a similar fashion as the posteroanterior views, except in the lateral view, the patient stands with both arms raised and the left side of the chest pressed against a flat surface.

===Typical views===
In the [[United States]], initial imaging of the chest generally consists of PA and lateral views. In other countries, the PA view suffices as an initial study; the lateral view is only added if indicated from interpretation of the PA view.

===Additional views===
*[[Decubitus]] - useful for differentiating [[pleural effusion]]s from consolidation (e.g. pneumonia) and Loculated effusions from free fluid in the pleura. In effusions, the fluid ''layers out'' (by comparison to an up-right view, when it often accumulates in the [[costophrenic angle]]s).
*[[Lordotic]] view - used to visualize the [[apex of the lung]], to pick-up abnormalities such as a [[Pancoast tumour]].
*[[Expiratory]] view - helpful for the diagnosis of pneumothorax
*[[Oblique projection|Oblique]] view

==Abnormalities==
===Nodule===
A nodule is a discrete opacity in the lung which may be caused by:
* [[Neoplasm]]: benign or malignant
* Granuloma: [[tuberculosis]]
* Infection: round pneumonia
* Vascular: [[infarct]], [[esophageal varices|varix]], [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]]

There are a number of features that are helpful in suggesting the diagnosis:
* rate of growth
** Doubling time of less than one month: sarcoma/infection/infarction/vascular
** Doubling time of six to 18 months: benign tumour/malignant granuloma
** Doubling time of more than 24 months: benign nodule malignancy
* [[calcification]]
* margin
** smooth
** lobulated
** presence of a [[corona radiata]]
* shape
* site

If the nodules are multiple, the differential is then smaller:
*infection: [[tuberculosis]], fungal infection, [[septic embolism|septic emboli]]
*neoplasm: e.g., [[metastasis|metastases]], [[lymphoma]], [[hamartoma]]
*[[sarcoidosis]]
*[[alveolitis]]
*auto-immune disease: e.g., [[Wegener's granulomatosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]]
*inhalation (e.g., [[pneumoconiosis]])

===Cavities===
A cavity is a walled hollow structure within the lungs. Diagnosis is aided by noting:
*wall thickness
*wall outline
*changes in the surrounding lung
The causes include:
*[[cancer]] (usually malignant)
*[[infarct]] (usually from a pulmonary embolus)
*infection: e.g., ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[tuberculosis]], [[Gram negative]] bacteria (especially ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]''),anaerobic bacteria, and fungal
*[[Wegener's granulomatosis]]

===Pleural abnormalities===
Fluid in space between the lung and the chest wall is termed a [[pleural effusion]]. There needs to be at least 75ml of pleural fluid in order to blunt the [[costophrenic angle]] on the lateral chest radiograph, and 200ml on the posteroanterior chest radiograph. On a lateral decubitus, amounts as small as 5ml of fluid are possible. Pleural effusions typically have a [[meniscus]] visible on an erect chest radiograph, but loculated effusions (as occur with an [[empyema]]) may have a [[lens (geometry)|lenticular]] shape (the fluid making an [[obtuse angle]] with the chest wall).

Pleural thickening may cause blunting of the costophrenic angle, but is distinguished from pleural fluid by the fact that it occurs as a linear shadow ascending vertically and clinging to the ribs.

===Diffuse shadowing===
The differential for diffuse shadowing is very broad and can defeat even the most experienced radiologist. It is seldom possible to reach a diagnosis on the basis of the chest radiograph alone: high-resolution [[computed tomography|CT]] of the chest is usually required and sometimes a lung [[biopsy]]. The following features should be noted:
*type of shadowing (lines, dots or rings)
**reticular (crisscrossing lines)
**[[companion shadow]] (lines paralleling bony landmarks)
**nodular (lots of small dots)
**rings or cysts
**ground glass
**consolidation (diffuse opacity with air bronchograms)
*location (where is the lesion worst?)
**upper (e.g., [[Sarcoidosis|sarcoid]], [[tuberculosis]], [[silicosis]]/[[pneumoconiosis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]])
**lower (e.g., [[cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis]], [[connective tissue disease]], asbestosis, drug reactions)
**central (e.g., [[pulmonary edema]], [[alveolar proteinosis]], [[lymphoma]], [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], [[pneumocystis pneumonia|PCP]])
**peripheral (e.g., [[cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis]], [[connective tissue disease]], [[chronic eosinophilic pneumonia]], [[bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia]])
*lung volume
**increased (e.g., [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]], [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]])
**decreased (e.g., fibrotic lung disease, chronic sarcoidosis, chronic extrinsic allergic alveolitis)

[[Pleural effusion]]s may occur with cancer, sarcoid, connective tissue diseases and [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]]. The presence of a pleural effusion argues against pneumocystis pneumonia.

===Signs===
:*The [[silhouette sign]] is especially helpful in localizing lung lesions.     (e.g., loss of right heart border in right middle lobe pneumonia),<ref name="OBGYN">[http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/OBGYN_101/MyDocuments4/Xray/Chest/ChestXray.htm Chest X-Ray], OB-GYN 101:  Introductory Obstetrics & Gynecology. © 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008 Medical Education Division,   Brookside Associates, Ltd. Retrieved 9 February 2010.</ref>
:*The air bronchogram sign, where branching     radiolucent columns of air     corresponding to bronchi is seen,  usually indicates air-space (alveolar) disease, as from blood, pus, mucus, cells, protein surrounding the air bronchograms. This is seen in [[Respiratory distress syndrome]]<ref name="OBGYN"/>
:*The "bean" sign first described by Professor Keval Pandya is the appearance of a sharply circumscribed bean shaped nodule on chest X-ray which has a high sensitivity and specificity (92% and 88%) for the presence of miliary TB.

==Limitations==
While chest radiographs are a cheap and relatively safe method of investigating diseases of the chest, there are a number of serious chest conditions that may be associated with a normal chest radiograph and other means of assessment may be necessary to make the diagnosis.  For example, a patient with an acute myocardial infarction may have a completely normal chest radiograph.
