'''Ketonuria''' is a medical condition in which [[ketone bodies]] are present in the [[urine]].

It is seen in conditions in which the body produces excess ketones as an indication that it is using an alternative source of energy. It is seen during starvation or more commonly in type I [[diabetes mellitus]]. Production of ketone bodies is a normal response to a shortage of [[glucose]], meant to provide an alternate source of fuel from [[fatty acids]].

==Pathophysiology==
Ketones are metabolic end-products of fatty acid [[metabolism]]. In healthy individuals, [[ketone bodies|ketones]] are formed in the [[liver]] and are completely metabolized so that only negligible amounts appear in the [[urine]]. However, when [[carbohydrates]] are unavailable or unable to be used as an energy source, [[fat]] becomes the predominant body fuel instead of carbohydrates and excessive amounts of ketones are formed as a metabolic byproduct. Higher levels of ketones in the urine indicate that the body is using fat as the major source of energy. 

Ketone bodies that commonly appear in the urine when fats are burned for energy are [[acetoacetate]] and [[beta-hydroxybutyric acid]]. Acetone is also produced and is expired by the lungs.<ref>[http://www.managedcaremag.com/supplements/0404_ketonetesting/MC0404_ketonetesting.pdf Detection of Ketones and Monitoring of Diabetic Ketoacidosis-cov-7]</ref> Normally, the urine should not contain a noticeable concentration of ketones to give a positive reading. As with tests for [[glucose]], acetone can be tested by a dipstick or by a lab. The results are reported as small, moderate, or large amounts of acetone. A small amount of acetone is a value under 20&nbsp;mg/dl; a moderate amount is a value of 30–40&nbsp;mg/dl, and a finding of 80&nbsp;mg/dl or greater is reported as a large amount.

One 2010 study admits that though ketonuria's relation to general metabolic health is ill-understood, there is a positive relationship between the presence of ketonuria after fasting and positive metabolic health.<ref>''Nam-Seok Joo at al. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995232/ Ketonuria after Fasting may be Related to the Metabolic Superiority]. J Korean Med Sci. 2010 December; 25(12): 1771–1776.

==Screening==
Screening for ketonuria is done frequently for acutely ill patients, presurgical patients, and pregnant women. Any diabetic patient who has elevated levels of blood and urine glucose should be tested for urinary ketones. In addition, when diabetic treatment is being switched from [[insulin]] to oral [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] agents, the patient's urine should be monitored for ketonuria. The development of ketonuria within 24 hours after insulin withdrawal usually indicates a poor response to the oral hypoglycemic agents. Diabetic patients should have their urine tested regularly for glucose and ketones, particularly when acute infection or other illness develops. 

In conditions associated with acidosis, urinary ketones are tested to assess the severity of acidosis and to monitor treatment response. Urine ketones appear before there is any significant increase in blood ketones;<ref>[http://archive.student.bmj.com/issues/09/02/education/68.php BMJ Student Archive-Glycosuria and Ketonuria]</ref> therefore, urine ketone measurement is especially helpful in emergency situations. During pregnancy, early detection of ketonuria is essential because ketoacidosis is a factor associated with intrauterine death.

==Causes of ketosis and ketonuria==
* Metabolic abnormalities such as [[diabetes]], renal [[glycosuria]], or [[glycogen]] storage disease 
* Dietary conditions such as [[starvation]], fasting, high protein, or low carbohydrate diets, prolonged [[vomiting]], and [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]]
* Conditions in which metabolism is increased, such as [[hyperthyroidism]], fever, pregnancy or [[lactation]]

In nondiabetic persons, ketonuria may occur during acute illness or severe stress. Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients may have ketonuria, even though they do not have diabetes. In a diabetic patient, ketone bodies in the urine suggest that the patient is not adequately controlled and that adjustments of medication, diet, or both should be made promptly. In the nondiabetic patient, ketonuria reflects a reduced carbohydrate metabolism and an increased fat metabolism.

==Test equipment==
Ketostix<ref>[http://www.americandiabeteswholesale.com/-strse-263/Bayer-Ketostix-Reagent-Strips/Detail.bok Description of Ketostix]</ref> is [[Bayer]]'s [[brand|brand name]] for test strips to measure the level of [[ketone]]s in the [[urine]]. Other brands of ketone test strips are [[Uriscan]], [[Atkins]] and [[Dirui]]. A strip consists of a thin piece of plastic film slightly larger than a [[matchstick]], with a reagent pad on one end that is either dipped into a urine sample or passed through the stream while the user is voiding. The pad is allowed to react for an exact, specified amount of time (it is recommended to use a stopwatch to time this exactly and disregard any resultant colour change after the specified time);<ref>[http://www.uchsc.edu/misc/diabetes/books/ud11/ud05.pdf Ketone Testing-Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes]</ref><ref>[http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/presentations/06-cwd-sick-days_files/slide0607.htm Measuring Ketones in Urine-Children With Diabetes]</ref> its resulting colour is then compared to a graded shade chart indicating a detection range from negative presence of ketones up to a significant quantity.
