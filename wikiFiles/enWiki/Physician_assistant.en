A '''physician assistant''' '''(PA)''', is a [[health care provider|healthcare professional]] who is trained to practice medicine.<ref>{{cite web|title=The PA Profession|url=http://www.aapa.org/the_pa_profession.aspx|work=The PA Profession|publisher=American Academy of Physician Assistants|accessdate=12/10/11}}</ref>

Physician assistants are concerned with preventing and treating human illness and injury by providing a broad range of health care services that are traditionally performed by a physician.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physician Assistants|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos081.htm|work=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition|publisher=United States Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=12/10/11}}</ref> Physician assistants conduct physical exams, diagnose and treat illnesses, order and interpret tests, prescribe medications, counsel on preventive health care and may assist in surgery.<ref>[http://medicine.yale.edu/pa/profession/index.aspx The PA Profession]. [[Yale School of Medicine]], 26 March 2009. Accessed 26 June 2009.</ref>

== Environment ==
Physician assistants work in [[hospital]]s, [[clinic]]s, and all other types of health facilities, and exercise autonomy in medical decision making. Physician Assistants practice medicine as a team and exercise a scope of practice and knowledge content similar to their supervising physician.  A period of extensive clinical training precedes obtaining a license to practice as a physician assistant, and similar to physician training, includes all systems of the human body. Renewal of licensure is necessary every few years, varying by state as well as re-certification every six years, however this is changing to a 10 year cycle{{cn|date=April 2013}}.  Physician assistants may also complete residency training, similar to physicians' residencies, in fields such as OB/GYN, emergency medicine, critical care, orthopedics, neurology, surgery, and other medical diciplines.

== Regulation ==
In the [[United States]], the profession is represented by the [[American Academy of Physician Assistants]]. In Canada, it is represented by the Canadian Association of Physician Assistants.  Similar providers have different titles in other countries such as [[clinical officer]]s in Africa, [[Clinical associates]] in South Africa, [[Assistant Medical Officer|assistant medical officer]]s in Malaysia, Physician Associate (formally known as Physician Assistant) in the UK{{cn|date=April 2013}}, [[Assistant Doctor]]s in China, and [[Feldsher]] in countries of the former Soviet Union.<ref>[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm International Standard Classification of Occupations, 2008 revision: Unit Group 2240-‘Paramedical pracititioners’.

==History==
The PA profession was first proposed when Charles Hudson recommended to the AMA in 1961 the "creation of two new groups of assistants to doctors from nonmedical and nonnursing personnel."<ref>Carter, R., Physician Assistant History, ''Perspective on Physician Assistant Education'', Vol. 12, No. 2, Spring 2001, http://www.pahx.org/pdf/Military%20Ranks.pdf Accessed 2011-06-03.</ref>  Dr. [[Eugene A. Stead]], Jr. of the [[Duke University]] Medical Center in [[North Carolina]] assembled the first class of physician assistants in 1965, composed of former [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Hospital Corpsman|hospital corpsmen]].<ref>[http://www.pahx.org/steadBio.html Eugene A. Stead, Jr., MD Biography - PA History Center]</ref> He based the curriculum of the PA program in part on his first-hand knowledge of the fast-track training of medical doctors during [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Two other physicians, Dr. Richard Smith at the University of Washington, and Dr. Hu Myers at Alderson-Broaddus College, also launched their own programs in the mid and late 1960s.<ref name="pahx.org">Carter, R., Physician Assistant History, ''Perspective on Physician Assistant Education'', Vol. 12, No. 2, Spring 2001, http://www.pahx.org/pdf/Military%20Ranks.pdf , Accessed 2011-06-03.</ref>

It was not until 1970 that the AMA passed a resolution to develop educational guidelines and certification procedures for PAs.<ref name="pahx.org"/> The Duke University Medical Center Archives has established the Physician Assistant History Center, dedicated to the study, preservation, and presentation of the history of the PA profession.<ref>[http://www.pahx.org/index.htm Physician Assistant History Center]</ref>

In the United States, "National Physician Assistant Week" is celebrated annually from October 6 through October 12. This week was chosen to commemorate the anniversary of the first graduating physician assistant class at Duke University on October 6, 1967.<ref>http://www.aapa.org/newsroom/pa-week.html</ref>

==Education and certification==

As of October 2011, there were 156 accredited PA programs in the United States.<ref name="paeaonline.org">[http://www.paeaonline.org/index.php?ht=d/sp/i/25515/pid/25515 "PA Programs Directory," Accessed 3 June 2011]</ref> All educational programs are [[Postgraduate education|graduate programs]] leading to the award of [[master's degree]]s or higher in either Physician Assistant Studies ([[Master of Physician Assistant Studies|MPAS]]), Health Science ([[Master of Health Science|MHS]]), or Medical Science (MMSc), and require a [[bachelor's degree]] and [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] or [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] scores for entry. Professional licensure is regulated by the medical boards of the individual [[U.S. state|states]].  Physician Assistant students train at medical schools and academic medical centers across the united states.  

Physician assistant education is based on medical education<ref>[http://www.aapa.org/gandp/issuebrief/education.pdf "Issue Brief - Physician Assistant Education: Preparation for Excellence" - AAPA]</ref> although unlike medical school which lasts four years plus a specialty-specific residency, PA training is usually 2 to 3 years of full-time study, completed during their post-graduate studies, for a total of 6–8 years of rigorious science based postsecondary education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physician Assistant|url=http://www.guidetohealthcareschools.com/degrees/allied-health/physician-assistant|publisher=guidetohealthcareschools|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> Medical school for physician assistants does not permit the student to work and is a serious committment to the study of medicine.  However, most PA students start their medical education with a background of health care experience. The didactic training of PA education consists of classroom and laboratory instruction in medical and behavioral sciences, such as anatomy, microbiology, pharmacology, pathophysiology, hematology, pathology, clinical medicine, and physical diagnosis, followed by clinical rotations in internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, and geriatric medicine, as well as elective rotations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Many PA schools do not differentiate between PA students and medical students in the content of their education, and their classes are often taken together, although PA students will take additional coursework in the evenings and summers to complete their programs in an accelerated fashion. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Unlike physicians, who must complete a minimum of three years of residency after completion of medical school, PAs are not required to complete such residencies after they complete medical school.  Despite this, there are residency programs in certain specialties for PAs who choose to continue formal education in such a format.<ref>[http://www.appap.org/index1.html The Association of Postgraduate PA Programs (APPAP)]</ref>  There are also PA to DO bridge programs for PAs who wish to practice as physicians allowing them to match for traditional medical residencies.  

PA clinical postgraduate programs are clinical training programs which differ from training on the job in their inclusion of didactic education and supervised clinical experience to meet learning objectives which are clearly defined.<ref name="Polansky 2007 100–108">{{cite journal|last=Polansky|first=Maura|title=A Historical Perspective on Postgraduate Physician Assistant Education and the Association of Postgraduate Physician Assistant Programs.|journal=Journal of Physician Assistant Education|year=2007|volume=18|issue=3|pages=100–108}}</ref> The Montefiore Medical Center Postgraduate Surgical Physician Assistant Program was established in 1971 as the first clinical postgraduate PA program to be recognized.<ref name="Polansky 2007 100–108"/> Currently, there are known to be 49 programs in various specialties such as Neurology, Trauma/Critical Care and Oncology.<ref name="Polansky 2012 39–45">{{cite journal|last=Polansky|first=Maura|coauthors=Garver GJ, Wilson LN, Pugh M, Hilton G|title=Postgraduate clinical education of physician assistants.|journal=J Physician Assist Educ|year=2012|volume=23|issue=1|pages=39–45}}</ref> The Association of Postgraduate Physician Assistant Programs was formed in 1988 as an instrument in the establishment of educational standards for postgraduate PA programs<ref name="Polansky 2007 100–108"/> and currently includes 50 member programs.<ref name="Polansky 2012 39–45"/>

A physician assistant may use the [[post-nominal]] initials "PA", "PA-C", "APA-C", "RPA" or "RPA-C", where the "-C" indicates "Certified" and the "R" indicates "Registered". The "R" designation is unique to a few states, mainly in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]; The "A" indicates completion of the Army [[Flight surgeon|Flight Surgeon]] Course.  Most PAs use [http://www.nccpa.net "PA-C"] During training, PA students are designated PA-S. The use of "PA-C" is limited only to those PAs currently certified and in compliance with the regulations of the national certifying organization, the [http://www.nccpa.net National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants] ([http://www.nccpa.net NCCPA]).

In the United States, a graduate from an accredited PA program must pass the NCCPA-administered Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam ([[PANCE]]) before becoming a PA-C; this certification is required for licensure in all states.<ref>[http://www.nccpa.net/EX_pance.aspx "Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE)" - National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA)]</ref>  In addition, a PA must earn and log 100 [[Continuing medical education|Continuing Medical Education]] (CME) hours and reregister his or her certificate with the NCCPA every two years.  Every six years, a PA must also recertify by successfully completing the Physician Assistant National Recertifying Exam ([[PANRE]])<ref>[http://www.nccpa.net/EX_panre.aspx "Physician Assistant National Recertifying Exam (PANRE)" - NCCPA]</ref><ref>[http://www.nccpa.net/EX_pathway.aspx "Pathway II" - NCCPA]</ref>

==Scope of practice==
PAs are medical professionals. They typically obtain medical histories, perform examinations and procedures, order treatments, diagnose diseases, prescribe medication, order and interpret diagnostic tests, refer patients to specialists as required, and first or second-assist in surgery.  Physician assistants' scope of practice is delineated in their PA-Physician practice agreement. PAs are employed in primary care or in specialties in urban or rural regions, as well as in academic administration. 

Physician assistants have their own medical licenses and do not work under a physician's license.<ref>[http://www.aapa.org/about-pas/becoming-a-physician-assistant "Becoming a Physician Assistant" - AAPA]</ref>  Each of the 50 states has different laws regarding the prescription of medications by [[mid-level practitioner]]s (which include PAs) by State and the licensing authority granted to each category within that particular State through the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA).<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugreg/practioners/index.html, U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control, Mid-Level Practitioners Authorization by State, Accessed 11 June 2011.</ref>  PAs in Florida, Kentucky, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are not allowed to prescribe any [[controlled substance]]s.<ref name="usdoj">http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugreg/practioners/mlp_by_state.pdf, U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control, Mid-Level Practitioners Authorization by State Table, Created 10 February 2011, Accessed 11 June 2011.</ref> Several other states place a limit on the type of [[Controlled Substances Act|controlled substance]] or the quantity that can be prescribed, dispensed, or administered by a PA.<ref name="usdoj"/>

Depending upon the specific laws of any given state board of medicine, the PA must have a formal relationship on file with a [[collaborative]] physician supervisor.  The physician collaborator must also be licensed in the state in which the PA is working, although he or she may physically be located elsewhere. Physician supervision can be in person, by [[telecommunication|telecommunication systems]] or by other reliable means (for example, availability for consultation).

==Employment==
The first employer of PAs was the then Veterans Administration, known today as the [[Department of Veterans Affairs]].  Today, the VA is the largest single employer of PAs, employing nearly 2000 PAs.  One of the first three graduates of the Duke program in 1967 was Mr. Vic Germino who was employed after graduation by the Durham, NC VA Medical Center, where he remained for over 25 years.  In July 2010, Mr. Germino was honored by the Veteran Affairs Physician Assistant Association (VAPAA) with an honorary membership and assigning him the special membership number 0001 in honor of Mr. Germino being the first PA employed by the VA.

According to the AAPA, there were an estimated 68,124 PAs in clinical practice as of January 2008.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the 2008 AAPA census, 56 percent of responding PAs worked in physicians' offices or clinics and 24 percent were employed by [[hospital]]s.<ref>[http://www.aapa.org/research/Highlights08/2008AAPACensusNationalReport.pdf 2008 AAPA Physician Assistant Census Report.]  page 2.</ref>   The remainder were employed in [[public health]] clinics, nursing homes, schools, prisons, home [[health care]] agencies, and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]]<ref>which also was the first employer of PAs.  Mr. Vic Germino one of the first three graduates was employed by the VA and he remained with the VA for over 25 years.[http://www.aapa.org/research/Highlights08/2008AAPACensusNationalReport.pdf 2008 AAPA Physician Assistant Census Report.]  Table 3.4: Number and Percent Distribution of Clinically Practicing Respondents by Primary Work Setting</ref> Fifteen percent of responding PAs work in counties classified as non-metropolitan by Economic Research Service of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]];<ref>[http://www.aapa.org/research/Highlights08/2008AAPACensusNationalReport.pdf 2008 AAPA Physician Assistant Census Report.]  Table 3.13: Number and Percent Distribution of Clinically Practicing Respondents by Metropolitan Status and Degree of Rurality of County of Primary Work Site</ref> approximately 17% of the US population resides in these [[County (United States)|counties]].<ref>[http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/Rurality/RuralUrbCon/ "Measuring Rurality: Rural-Urban Continuum Codes" - USDA Economic Research Service]</ref>

The U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics report on PAs states, "...Employment of physician assistants is expected to grow 27 percent from 2006 to 2016, much faster than the average for all occupations..."<ref>[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos081.htm#outlook "Physician Assistants" - U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics]</ref>  This is due to several factors, including an expanding health care industry, an aging [[baby boomer|baby-boomer]] population, concerns for cost containment, and newly-implemented restrictions to shorten physician [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] work hours.

For PAs in primary care practice, [[malpractice]] insurance policies with $100,000&ndash;300,000 in coverage can cost less than $600 per year; premiums are higher for PAs in higher-risk specialties.<ref>[http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/memag/Medical+Malpractice:+Insurance/Malpractice-Consult-Liability-insurance-for-a-phys/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/118626 "Malpractice Consult: Liability insurance for a physician assistant" - Modern Medicine]</ref>

''Money'' magazine, in conjunction with Salary.com, listed the PA profession as the "fifth best job in America" in May 2006, based both on salary and job prospects, and on an anticipated 10-year job growth of 49.65%.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2006/05/01/8375749/index.htm "50 Best Jobs in America" (May 1, 2006) - CNN/Money.com]</ref> In 2010, CNN Money rated the Physician Assistant Career as the number two Best Job In America.<ref>http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/2010/snapshots/2.html</ref> In 2012, Forbes rated the Physician Assistant Degree as the number one Master's Degree for jobs.<ref>http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/06/08/the-best-and-worst-masters-degrees-for-jobs-2/</ref> According to the 2012 National Salary Survey of PAs, the mean total income for physician assistants working full-time was $102,165.<ref>[http://nurse-practitioners-and-physician-assistants.advanceweb.com/Web-Extras/Online-Extras/2012-NP-PA-Salary-Survey-Results.aspx]</ref> Physician assistants in emergency medicine, dermatology, and surgical subspecialties may earn $100,000 to $200,000 per year.<ref>[http://physician-assistant.advanceweb.com/editorial/content/editorial.aspx?cc=188720 2008 AAPA Physician Assistant Census Report - Specialty Reports]</ref>

==Federal Government, Uniformed Services, and U.S. Armed Forces==
PAs are employed by the [[State Department|United States Department of State]] as Foreign Service Health Practitioners (FSHP).  PAs working in this capacity may be deployed anywhere in the world where there is a State Department facility.  They provide primary care to authorized members of the state department.  In order to be considered for the position of FSHP these PAs must be licensed and have at least two years of recent experience in primary care.<ref>[http://state.gov U.S. Department of State]</ref>

[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] PAs typically serve as [[Medical Specialist Corps]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s within Army combat or combat support [[battalion]]s located in the [[continental United States]], [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and overseas.<ref>[http://www.usarec.army.mil/armypa U.S. Army PA Information]</ref> These include [[infantry]], [[armor]], [[cavalry]], [[airborne forces|airborne]], [[artillery]] and (if the PA qualifies) [[Special Forces]] units. They serve as the "front line" of Army medicine and along with [[combat medic]]s are responsible for the total health care of soldiers assigned to their unit, as well as of their family members.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

PAs also serve in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] as clinical practitioners and [[aviation medicine]] specialists, as well as in the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] and [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]]. The skills required for these PAs are similar to that of their civilian colleagues, but additional training is provided in advanced casualty care, medical management of chemical injuries, [[aviation medicine]] and [[military medicine]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In addition, military PAs are also required to meet the officer commissioning requirements and maintain the professional and physical readiness standards of their respective services.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
