A '''wheelbench''' is a wheeled [[mobility device]] in which the user lies down. The device is propelled manually. The user pushes the wheels with their hands in the same manner as propelling a wheelchair or the wheelbench can be moved by a second person pulling or pushing it by the handles.

A wheelbench is constructed in a similar way to a [[wheelchair]], except that it has a [[stretcher]] on the top instead of a seat. The device is also called a wheeled stretcher.<ref>http://friends-forum.mosken.com/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=24052</ref> A wheelbench is collapsible, just like a wheelchair.

Wheelbenches are used by people for whom both sitting and walking is difficult or impossible. The term ''[[sitting disability]]'' is used to describe a condition in which sitting is difficult, painful and perhaps medically injurious and which may be due to [[illness]], injury, or other [[disability]]. A notable symptom of ''sitting disability'' is severe [[back pain]]. While mobility impairment is widely recognised, ''sitting disability'' is rarely mentioned in research or legal documents. Hence, wheelbenches are not as well known to society as wheelchairs.

A wheelbench has some resemblance to a hospital [[gurney]] or wheelchair. The difference is that the gurney is primarily made to move patients around in a hospital and is less comfortable for long distances or outdoors. A wheelbench has bigger wheels, just like a wheelchair.

Wheelbenches are usually produced by companies producing wheelchairs.  Norway is one of the nations producing wheelbenches.<ref>http://www.pantheranorge.no/webbsidor/liggetralle.htm</ref><ref>http://www.handicare.no/</ref>
