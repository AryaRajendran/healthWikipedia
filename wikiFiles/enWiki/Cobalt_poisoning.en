'''Cobalt poisoning''' is [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] caused by excessive levels of [[cobalt]] in the body. Cobalt is an [[essential element]] for health in animals in minute amounts as a component of [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]]. A deficiency of cobalt, which is very rare, is also potentially lethal, leading to [[pernicious anemia]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

==How cobalt enters the body ==
Exposure to cobalt metal dust is most common in the fabrication of [[tungsten carbide]].

==Toxicity of cobalt salts==
The {{LD50}} values of soluble cobalt salts has been estimated to be between 150 and 500&nbsp;mg/kg. Thus, for a 100&nbsp;kg person the LD<sub>50</sub> would be about 20&nbsp;grams.<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|author=John D.
