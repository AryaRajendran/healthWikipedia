'''Polybus''' (fl. c. 400 BC) was one of the pupils of [[Hippocrates]], and also his son-in-law. He lived on the island of [[Kos|Cos]] in the 4th century BC. With his brothers-in-law, [[Thessalus (physician)|Thessalus]] and [[Draco (physician)|Draco]], he was one of the founders of the [[Dogmatic school]] of medicine. He was sent by Hippocrates, with his fellow-pupils, during the time of the plague, to assist different cities with his medical skill.<ref>Thessal., ''Orat.''</ref> Afterwards, he remained in his native country.<ref name="galen1">Galen, ''Comment. in Hippocr. De Nat. Hom.'', i. praef. col. xv.</ref> According to Galen, he followed implicitly the opinions and practices of Hippocrates, but the strict accuracy of this assertion has been doubted. 

He has been supposed, by both ancient and modern scholars, to be the author of several works in the Hippocratic collection. Possible works include ''De Natura Hominis'', ''De Genitura'', ''De Natura Pueri'', ''De Salubri Victus Ratione'', ''De Affectionibus'', and ''De Internis Affectionibus''. [[Clement of Alexandria]] attributes to him the treatise ''De Octimestri Partu'',<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', vi.</ref> and [[Pseudo-Plutarch]] quotes him as the author of ''De Septimestri Partu''.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch, ''De Philosoph. Plac''. v. 18</ref> ''De Natura Hominis'' (''On the Nature of Man'') is the earliest known text to advance a [[Four humours|four-humor]] system of [[blood]], [[phlegm]], [[yellow bile]], and [[black bile]]. [[Galen]], though, considers ''De Natura Hominis'' to be the work of Hippocrates himself.<ref name="galen1"/>

Polybus is mentioned many times by Galen, chiefly in connection with different works in the Hippocratic collection. He is also mentioned by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]], [[Caelius Aurelianus]], and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].
