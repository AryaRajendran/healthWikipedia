'''Ethylene glycol poisoning''' is caused by the ingestion of [[ethylene glycol]] (the primary ingredient in both automotive [[antifreeze]] and hydraulic [[brake fluid]]). Ethylene glycol should not be confused with [[propylene glycol]], a common [[food additive]]. Ethylene glycol is a toxic, colorless, odorless, almost [[Volatility (chemistry)|nonvolatile]] liquid with a sweet taste that is occasionally consumed by children and dogs due to its sweetness. Following ingestion the symptoms of poisoning follow a three step progression starting with [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] and [[vomiting]], before causing [[metabolic acidosis]], [[cardiovascular]] dysfunction, and finally [[acute kidney failure]]. The major cause of toxicity is not the ethylene glycol itself but its [[metabolite]]s. The major metabolites causing toxicity are [[glycolic acid]] and [[oxalic acid]].

[[Medical diagnosis]] of poisoning is most reliably done by measurement of ethylene glycol in the blood. However, many [[hospital]]s do not have the facilities to perform this test and need to rely on abnormalities in the body’s [[biochemistry]] to diagnose poisoning. Diagnosis can also be aided by examining the urine for the presence of calcium oxalate crystals. Treatment consists of initially stabilizing the patient, followed by the use of [[antidotes]]. The antidotes used are either [[ethanol]] or [[fomepizole]] (Antizol). The antidotes work by blocking the [[enzyme]] responsible for metabolizing ethylene glycol and therefore halt the progression of poisoning. [[Hemodialysis]] is also used to help remove ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. As long as medical treatment is undertaken, the prognosis is generally good with most patients making a full recovery. Poisoning is relatively common, and due to its taste, children and animals will sometimes consume large quantities of ethylene glycol. [[Denatonium benzoate]], a [[bitterant]], is added to many antifreeze products to discourage accidental or deliberate ingestion.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning usually follow a three-step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent">{{cite journal | author = Brent J | title = Current management of ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Drugs | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 979–88 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11434452 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200161070-00006 | issn = 0012-6667}}</ref>
* Stage 1 (0.5 to 12 hours) consists of [[neurological]] and [[gastrointestinal]] symptoms; people may appear to be [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]], exhibiting symptoms such as [[dizziness]], [[ataxia|incoordination of muscle movements]], [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[headache]]s, slurred speech, and [[confusion]]. Irritation to the stomach may cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> Over time, the body [[Metabolism|metabolizes]] ethylene glycol into other toxins.
* Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) is a result of accumulation of [[organic acid]]s formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol and consists of [[tachycardia|increased heart rate]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[hyperventilation]], and [[metabolic acidosis]]. Additionally [[hypocalcemia|low calcium concentrations in the blood]], [[hyperreflexia|overactive muscle reflexes]], [[Spasm|muscle spasms]], [[QT interval]] prolongation, and [[congestive heart failure]] may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/>
* Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. Symptoms include [[acute tubular necrosis]], [[hematuria|red blood cells in the urine]], [[proteinuria|excess proteins in the urine]], [[lower back]] pain, [[oliguria|decreased]] or [[anuria|absent]] production of urine, [[hyperkalemia|elevated blood concentration of potassium]], and [[acute kidney failure]].<ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux">{{cite journal | author=Barceloux DG, Krenzelok EP, Olson K, Watson W. | title=American Academy of Clinical Toxicology Practice Guidelines on the Treatment of Ethylene Glycol Poisoning.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Glycolic acid3d.png|thumb|right|[[Glycolic acid]] is the major metabolite of ethylene glycol responsible for toxicity]]
The three main systems affected by ethylene glycol poisoning are the [[central nervous system]], [[metabolic]] processes, and the [[kidney]]s.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The central nervous system is affected early in the course of poisoning as the result of a direct action of ethylene glycol. Similar to [[ethanol]], it causes intoxication, followed by [[drowsiness]] or [[coma]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> [[Seizure]]s may occur due to a direct effect.<ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux"/> The toxic mechanism of ethylene glycol poisoning is mainly due to the metabolites of ethylene glycol. Initially it is [[metabolized]] by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] to [[glycolaldehyde]], which is then oxidized to [[glycolic acid]].  The increase in metabolites may cause [[encephalopathy]] or [[cerebral edema]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maier W |title=Cerebral computed tomography of ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=Neuroradiology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–7 |year=1983 |pmid=6828232 |doi= |url= |issn=0028-3940}}</ref> The metabolic effects occur 12 to 36 hours post ingestion, causing primarily [[metabolic acidosis]] which is due mainly to accumulated glycolic acid. Additionally, as a side effect of the first two steps of metabolism, an increase in the blood concentration of [[lactic acid]] occurs contributing to [[lactic acidosis]]. The formation of acid metabolites also causes inhibition of other [[metabolic pathway]]s, such as [[oxidative phosphorylation]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/>

The renal toxicity of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and is caused by a direct [[cytotoxic]] effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to [[glyoxylic acid]] and finally to [[oxalic acid]]. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form [[calcium oxalate]] crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to [[oliguric]] or [[Anuria|anuric]] [[acute kidney failure]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting]] step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid.<ref name="Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R 1986 16–20">{{cite journal |author=Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R |title=Organic acids in ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=Annals of internal medicine |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=16–20 |year=1986 |month=July |pmid=3717806 |doi= |url= |issn=0003-4819}}</ref> Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clay KL, Murphy RC |title=On the metabolic acidosis of ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=[[Toxicology and applied pharmacology]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=39–49 |year=1977 |month=January |pmid=14421 |doi= 10.1016/0041-008X(77)90175-2|url= |issn=0041-008X |format=}}</ref>

=== Toxicity ===
Ethylene glycol has been shown to be toxic to humans<ref name="Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ 1962 891–902">{{cite journal |author=Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ |title=Consequences of ethylene glycol poisoning.

That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80&nbsp;kg adult and 4 mL for a 20&nbsp;kg child. [[Poison control center]]s often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.<ref name="Caravati"/>

The orally [[lethal dose]] in humans has been reported as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> That is approximately 224 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80&nbsp;kg adult and 56 mL for a 20&nbsp;kg child.

Ethylene glycol has a low [[vapor pressure]]; it does not [[evaporate]] readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hodgman MJ, Wezorek C, Krenzelok E |title=Toxic inhalation of ethylene glycol: a pharmacological improbability |journal=Journal of toxicology.

==Prevention==
Antifreeze products for automotive use containing [[propylene glycol]] in place of ethylene glycol are available, and are generally considered safer to use, as it possesses an unpleasant taste in contrast to the perceived "sweet" taste of toxic ethylene glycol-based coolants, and only produces [[lactic acid]] in an animal's body, as their muscles do when exercised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.resteddoginn.ca/antifreeze.php |title=Ethylene Glycol Poisoning |author=Pieter Klapwijk |date=January 27th, 2010 |work= |publisher=The Rested Dog Inn |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=October 2012}}

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Calcium oxalate crystals in urine.jpg|thumb|Urine microscopy showing [[calcium oxalate]] crystals in the urine]]

As many of the [[Medical sign|clinical signs]] and symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult.<ref name="Hall TL">{{cite journal |author=Hall TL |title=Fomepizole in the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=CJEM: Canadian Journal of Emergency Medical Care: JCUM: Journal Canadien De Soins Médicaux D'urgence |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=199–204 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=17609006 |doi= |url=http://www.cjem-online.ca/sites/default/files/pg199.pdf|issn=1481-8035 |format=pdf}}</ref> It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the [[Blood plasma|blood]] ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined easily by [[gas chromatography]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aarstad K, Dale O, Aakervik O, Ovrebø S, Zahlsen K |title=A rapid gas chromatographic method for determination of ethylene glycol in serum and urine |journal=Journal of analytical toxicology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=218–21 |year=1993 |pmid=8371550 |doi= |month= July|issn=0146-4760 |format=}}</ref> Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this [[blood test]] and in the absence of this test the diagnosis must be made based on the clinical presentation of the patient.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the [[osmol gap|osmolal gap]]. The patients' serum [[osmolality]] is measured by [[freezing point depression]] and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured [[sodium]], [[glucose]], [[blood urea nitrogen]], and any [[ethanol]] that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.<ref name="Jacobsen"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoffman RS, Smilkstein MJ, Howland MA, Goldfrank LR |title=Osmol gaps revisited: normal values and limitations |journal=Journal of toxicology. Clinical toxicology |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |year=1993 |pmid=8433417 |doi=10.3109/15563659309000375 |url= |issn=0731-3810 |format=}}</ref>

The increased osmolal gap is caused by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Glaser DS |title=Utility of the serum osmol gap in the diagnosis of methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=343–6 |year=1996 |month=March |pmid=8599495 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(96)70271-8|url= |issn=0196-0644}}</ref> Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], or [[methanol]] or conditions such as [[Ketoacidosis|alcoholic]] or [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[lactic acidosis]], or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/>

Other laboratory abnormalities may suggest poisoning, especially the presence of a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large [[anion gap]]. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of [[differential diagnosis]], including poisoning from methanol, [[salicylate]]s, [[Iron poisoning|iron]], [[isoniazid]], [[paracetamol]], [[theophylline]], or from conditions such as [[uremia]] or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> Urine [[microscopy]] can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jacobsen D, Akesson I, Shefter E |title=Urinary calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals in ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=231–4 |year=1982 |month=May |pmid=7134806 |doi= |url= |issn=0036-5513}}</ref> Finally, many commercial radiator [[antifreeze]] products have [[fluorescein]] added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a [[Wood's lamp]].

== Treatment ==
=== Stabilization and decontamination ===
The most important initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, [[gastric]] decontamination is unlikely to be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, [[gastric lavage]] or [[nasogastric aspiration]] of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vale JA, Kulig K |title=Position paper: gastric lavage |journal=J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=933–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15641639 |doi=10.1081/CLT-200045006 |url= |issn=0731-3810 }}</ref> [[Syrup of ipecac|Ipecac]]-induced [[vomiting]] is not recommended.

In this situation [[ABC (medicine)|stabilization]] of the patient including [[airway management]] with [[endotracheal intubation|intubation]] should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with [[sodium bicarbonate]] and anticonvulsives such as a [[benzodiazepine]] respectively.<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/> Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen [[hypocalcemia]] by increasing the [[plasma protein binding]] of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage.<ref name="Hall TL"/> [[Intubation]] and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with [[hypotension]] require treatment with [[intravenous]] fluids and possibly [[vasopressor]]s.<ref name="Brent-2009"/>

=== Antidotes ===
Following decontamination and the institution of supportive measures, the next priority is inhibition of further ethylene glycol metabolism using [[antidote]]s. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are [[ethanol]] and [[fomepizole]]. This antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management of ethylene glycol poisoning.  The toxicity of ethylene glycol comes from its metabolism to glycolic acid and oxalic acid.  The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent the formation of these metabolites.  Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the degradation pathway.  Because ethanol has a much higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase, about a 100-times greater affinity, it successfully blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycoaldehyde, which prevents the further degradation.  Without oxalic acid formation, the nephrotoxic effects can be avoided, but the ethylene glycol is still present in the body.  It is eventually excreted in the urine, but supportive therapy for the CNS depression and metabolic acidosis will be required until the ethylene glycol concentrations fall below toxic limits.  Pharmaceutical grade ethanol is usually given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% [[dextrose]], but it is also sometimes given orally in the form of a strong spirit such as [[whisky]], [[vodka]], or [[gin]].<ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/>

Fomepizole is a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block the formation of the toxic metabolites.<ref name="Hall TL"/><ref name="Brent-2009">{{cite journal |author=Brent J |title=Fomepizole for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning |journal=N.

Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, [[hypoglycemia]] in children, and possible [[liver]] toxicity.<ref name="Jacobsen"/> Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a [[Therapeutic index|therapeutic]] ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an [[intensive care unit]]. Alternatively, the adverse [[adverse effect|side effects]] of fomepizole are minimal{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive.

=== Hemodialysis ===
In addition to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning is the use of [[hemodialysis]]. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It has been shown to be highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood.<ref name="Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R 1986 16–20"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Moreau CL, Kerns W, Tomaszewski CA, McMartin KE, Rose SR, Ford MD, Brent J |title=Glycolate kinetics and hemodialysis clearance in ethylene glycol poisoning.

In an effort to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called [[denatonium benzoate]], known by the [[trade name]] Bitrex, is added to ethylene glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion.

== History ==
Ethylene glycol was once thought innocuous; in 1931 it was suggested as being suitable for use as a vehicle or solvent for injectable pharmaceutical preparations.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hanzlik PJ, Seidenfeld MA, Johnson CC |title=General properties, irritant and toxic actions of ethylene glycol |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume= 41|issue= 4|pages= 387–406|year= 1931|doi= |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/41/4/387}}</ref> Numerous cases of poisoning have been reported since then, and it has been shown to be toxic to humans.<ref name="Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ 1962 891–902"/>
