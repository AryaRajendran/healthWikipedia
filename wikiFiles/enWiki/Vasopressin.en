'''Arginine vasopressin''' ('''AVP'''), also known as '''vasopressin''', '''argipressin''' or '''antidiuretic hormone''' ('''ADH'''), is a [[neurohypophysial hormone]] found in most [[mammals]]. Its two primary functions are to retain water in the body and to constrict blood vessels. Vasopressin regulates the body's [[Water retention (medicine)|retention of water]] by acting to increase water absorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney nephron.<ref name="isbn0-387-30348-0">{{cite book | author =  Caldwell HK, Young WS III | authorlink = | editor = Lajtha A, Lim R | others = | title = Handbook of Neurochemistry and Molecular Neurobiology: Neuroactive Proteins and Peptides | edition = 3rd | language = | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2006 | origyear = | chapter =  Oxytocin and Vasopressin: Genetics and Behavioral Implications | chapterurl= http://refworks.springer.com/mrw/fileadmin/pdf/Neurochemistry/0387303480C25.PDF | pages = 573–607| quote = | isbn = 0-387-30348-0 | oclc = | doi = | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref> Vasopressin increases water permeability of the kidney's collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels in the kidney nephron collecting duct plasma membrane.<ref name="pmid7532304">{{cite journal | author = Nielsen S, Chou CL, Marples D, Christensen EI, Kishore BK, Knepper MA | title = Vasopressin increases water permeability of kidney collecting duct by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels to plasma membrane | journal = Proc.

It also increases [[peripheral vascular resistance]], which in turn increases arterial [[blood pressure]]. It plays a key role in [[homeostasis]], by the regulation of water, glucose, and salts in the blood. It is derived from a [[preprohormone]] precursor that is synthesized in the [[hypothalamus]] and stored in vesicles at the [[posterior pituitary]]. Most of it is stored in the posterior pituitary to be released into the bloodstream. However, some AVP may also be released directly into the [[brain]], and accumulating evidence suggests it plays an important role in [[social behavior]], [[Sexual motivation and hormones#Oxytocin and vasopressin|sexual motivation]] and bonding, and maternal responses to stress.

==Physiology==

===Function===
One of the most important roles of AVP is to regulate the body's [[Water retention (medicine)|retention of water]]; it is released when the body is dehydrated and causes the [[kidney]]s to conserve water, thus concentrating the [[urine]] and reducing urine volume. At high concentrations, it also raises blood pressure by inducing moderate [[vasoconstriction]]. In addition, it has a variety of neurological effects on the brain, having been found, for example, to influence pair-bonding in [[voles]]. The high-density distributions of vasopressin receptor AVPr1a in [[prairie vole]] ventral forebrain regions have been shown to facilitate and coordinate reward circuits during partner preference formation, critical for pair bond formation.<ref name="Young2004">{{cite journal | author = Lim MM, Young LJ | title = Vasopressin-dependent neural circuits underlying pair bond formation in the monogamous prairie vole | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–45 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15051143 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2003.12.008 | url = }}</ref>

A very similar substance, ''lysine vasopressin'' ('''LVP''') or '''lypressin''', has the same function in [[pig]]s and is often used in human therapy.

====Kidney====
Vasopressin has two effects by which it contributes to increased urine osmolarity (increased concentration) and decreased water excretion. These are: 

# Increasing the water permeability of distal tubule and collecting duct cells in the kidney, thus allowing water reabsorption and excretion of more concentrated urine, i.e., [[antidiuretic|antidiuresis]]. This occurs through insertion of water channels ([[aquaporin|Aquaporin-2]]) into the [[apical membrane]] of distal tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells. Aquaporins allow water to move down their osmotic gradient and out of the nephron, increasing the amount of water re-absorbed from the filtrate (forming urine) back into the bloodstream.</br> [[V2 receptor]]s, which are [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s on the basolateral plasma membrane of the epithelial cells, couple to the heterotrimeric G-protein [[Gs alpha subunit|G<sub>s</sub>]], which activates [[adenylyl cyclase]]s III and VI to convert [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] into [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], plus 2 inorganic phosphates. The rise in cAMP then triggers the insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels by exocytosis of intracellular vesicles, recycling endosomes. Vasopressin also increases the concentration of calcium in the collecting duct cells, by episodic release from intracellular stores.  Vasopressin, acting through cAMP, also increases transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene, thus increasing the total number of aquaporin-2 molecules in collecting duct cells.</br> Cyclic-AMP activates [[protein kinase A]] (PKA) by binding to its regulatory subunits and allowing them to detach from the catalytic subunits.   Detachment exposes the catalytic site in the enzyme, allowing it to add phosphate groups to proteins (including the aquaporin-2 protein), which alters their functions. 
# Increasing permeability of the inner medullary portion of the collecting duct to [[urea]] by regulating the cell surface expression of [[urea transporter]]s,<ref name="pmid21686211">{{cite journal | author = Sands JM, Blount MA, Klein JD | title = Regulation of renal urea transport by vasopressin | journal = Trans.

Assoc. | volume = 122 | issue = | pages = 82–92 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21686211 | pmc = 3116377 | doi = }}</ref> which facilitates its reabsorption into the [[medullary interstitium]] as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the [[connecting tubule]], [[cortical collecting duct]], and [[outer medullary collecting duct]].

====Cardiovascular system====
Vasopressin increases peripheral vascular resistance (vasoconstriction) and thus increases arterial [[blood pressure]]. This effect appears small in healthy individuals; however it becomes an important compensatory mechanism for restoring blood pressure in [[hypovolemic shock]] such as that which occurs during hemorrhage.

====Central nervous system====
[[File:AVP, ISH, periventricular region of the hypothalamus, adult mouse.jpg|thumbnail|left|[http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/78153149 Avp] is expressed in the periventricular region of the hypothalamus in the adult mouse.<ref name="pmid17437647">{{cite journal | author = Liu Z, Yan SF, Walker JR, Zwingman TA, Jiang T, Li J, Zhou Y | title = Study of gene function based on spatial co-expression in a high-resolution mouse brain atlas | journal = BMC Syst Biol | volume = 1| pages = 19 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17437647 | pmc = 1863433 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-1-19 }}</ref> [[Allen Brain Atlas]]es]]
Vasopressin released within the brain has many actions:
* It has been implicated in [[memory]] formation, including delayed reflexes, image, short- and long-term memory, though the mechanism remains unknown; these findings are controversial.  However, the synthetic [[vasopressin analogue]] [[desmopressin]] has come to interest as a likely [[nootropic]].

* Vasopressin is released into the brain in a [[circadian rhythm]] by neurons of the [[supraoptic nucleus]].

* Vasopressin released from centrally projecting hypothalamic neurons is involved in aggression, blood pressure regulation and temperature regulation.

* It is likely that vasopressin acts in conjunction with [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] to modulate the release of [[corticosteroids]] from the [[adrenal gland]] in response to stress, particularly during pregnancy and lactation in mammals.<ref name="pmid1649836">{{cite journal | author = Goland RS, Wardlaw SL, MacCarter G, Warren WB, Stark RI | title = Adrenocorticotropin and cortisol responses to vasopressin during pregnancy | journal = J.

*Selective AVPr1a blockade in the [[ventral pallidum]] has been shown to prevent partner preference in prairie voles, suggesting that these receptors in this ventral forebrain region are crucial for pair bonding.<ref name="Young2004"/>

Evidence for this comes from experimental studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of vasopressin and vasopressin receptors in the brain is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and promiscuous species in the distribution of AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | author = Young LJ | title = The neuroendocrinology of the social brain | journal = Front Neuroendocrinol | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–8 | year = 2009 | month = October | pmid = 19596026 | doi = 10.1016/j.yfrne.2009.06.002 }}</ref> Moreover, studies involving either injecting AVP agonists into the brain or blocking the actions of AVP support the hypothesis that vasopressin is involved in aggression toward other males. There is also evidence that differences in the AVP receptor gene between individual members of a species might be predictive of differences in social behavior. 
One study has suggested that genetic variation in male humans affects pair-bonding behavior. The brain of males uses vasopressin as a reward for forming lasting bonds with a mate, and men with one or two of the genetic alleles are more likely to experience marital discord.  The partners of the men with two of the alleles affecting vasopressin reception state disappointing levels of satisfaction, affection, and cohesion.<ref name="pmid18765804">{{cite journal | author = Walum H, Westberg L, Henningsson S, Neiderhiser JM, Reiss D, Igl W, Ganiban JM, Spotts EL, Pedersen NL, Eriksson E, Lichtenstein P | title = Genetic variation in the vasopressin receptor 1a gene (AVPR1A) associates with pair-bonding behavior in humans | journal = Proc.

Vasopressin receptors distributed along the reward circuit pathway, to be specific in the ventral pallidum, are activated when AVP is released during social interactions such as mating, in monogamous prairie voles. The activation of the reward circuitry reinforces this behavior, leading to conditioned partner preference, and thereby initiates the formation of a pair bond.<ref name="Pitkow(2001)">{{cite journal | author = Pitkow LJ, Sharer CA, Ren X, Insel TR, Terwilliger EF, Young LJ | title = Facilitation of affiliation and pair-bond formation by vasopressin receptor gene transfer into the ventral forebrain of a monogamous vole | journal = J.

===Control===
Vasopressin is secreted from the [[posterior pituitary gland]] in response to reductions in [[blood plasma|plasma]] volume, in response to increases in the [[plasma osmolality]], and in response to [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK) secreted by the [[small intestine]]:

* Secretion ''in response to reduced plasma volume'' is activated by [[baroreceptor|pressure receptors]] in the [[vein]]s, [[atrium (anatomy)|atria]], and [[carotid]]s.
* Secretion ''in response to increases in plasma osmotic pressure'' is mediated by [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[hypothalamus]].
* Secretion ''in response to increases in plasma CCK'' is mediated by an unknown pathway.

The neurons that make AVP, in the hypothalamic [[supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic nuclei]] (SON) and [[paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular nuclei]] (PVN), are themselves osmoreceptors, but they also receive synaptic input from other osmoreceptors located in regions adjacent to the anterior wall of the third ventricle. These regions include the [[organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis]] and the [[subfornical organ]].

Many factors influence the secretion of vasopressin:
* [[Ethanol]] (alcohol) reduces the calcium-dependent secretion of AVP by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels in neurohypophyseal nerve terminals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wang X, Dayanithi G, Lemos JR, Nordmann JJ, Treistman SN | title = Calcium currents and peptide release from neurohypophysial terminals are inhibited by ethanol | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 259 | issue = 2 | pages = 705–11 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1941619 }}</ref>

*[[Atrial natriuretic peptide]] inhibits AVP secretion, in part by inhibiting Angiotensin II-induced stimulation of AVP secretion.<ref name="Matsukawa"/>

===Secretion===
The main stimulus for secretion of vasopressin is increased osmolality of plasma. Reduced volume of extracellular fluid also has this effect, but is a less sensitive mechanism. 

The AVP that is measured in peripheral blood is almost all derived from secretion from the [[posterior pituitary gland]] (except in cases of AVP-secreting tumours). Vasopressin is produced by [[magnocellular neurosecretory neuron]]s in the [[Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus]] (PVN) and [[Supraoptic nucleus]] (SON). It then travels down the axon through the [[Pituitary stalk|infundibulum]] within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood. However there are two other sources of AVP with important local effects: 
*AVP is also synthesized by [[parvocellular neurosecretory neuron]]s at the PVN, transported and released at the [[median eminence]], which then travels through the [[hypophyseal portal system]] to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates [[corticotropic cell]]s synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue).<ref name="pmid2830315">{{cite journal | author = Salata RA, Jarrett DB, Verbalis JG, Robinson AG | title = Vasopressin stimulation of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) in humans.

* Vasopressin is also released into the brain by several different populations of smaller neurons.

==Structure and relation to oxytocin==
[[File:vasopressin labeled.png|thumb|right|Chemical structure of the argipressin (indicating that this compound is of the vasopressin family with an [[arginine]] at the 8th [[amino acid]] position.]]
[[File:Oxytocin with labels.png|thumb|right|Chemical structure of [[oxytocin]]]]

The vasopressins are [[peptide]]s consisting of nine [[amino acid]]s (nonapeptides). (NB: the value in the table above of 164 amino acids is that obtained before the hormone is activated by cleavage).  The amino acid sequence of arginine vasopressin is [[cysteine|Cys]]-[[tyrosine|Tyr]]-[[Phenylalanine|Phe]]-[[glutamine|Gln]]-[[asparagine|Asn]]-[[Cysteine|Cys]]-[[proline|Pro]]-[[arginine|Arg]]-[[glycine|Gly]], with the cysteine residues forming a [[disulfide bond]]. Lysine vasopressin has a [[lysine]] in place of the arginine.

The structure of [[oxytocin]] is very similar to that of the vasopressins: It is also a nonapeptide with a disulfide bridge and its amino acid sequence differs at only two positions (see table below). The two genes are located on the same chromosome separated by a relatively small distance of less than 15,000 bases in most species. The [[Magnocellular neurosecretory cell|magnocellular neurons]] that make vasopressin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that make oxytocin, and are similar in many respects.
The similarity of the two peptides can cause some cross-reactions: oxytocin has a slight antidiuretic function, and high levels of AVP can cause uterine contractions.<ref name="pmid18057218">{{cite journal | author = Li C, Wang W, Summer SN, Westfall TD, Brooks DP, Falk S, Schrier RW | title = Molecular mechanisms of antidiuretic effect of oxytocin | journal = J.

==Role in disease==

===Lack of AVP===
Decreased AVP release or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP leads to [[diabetes insipidus]], a condition featuring [[hypernatremia]] (increased blood [[sodium]] concentration), [[polyuria]] (excess urine production), and [[polydipsia]] (thirst).

===Excess AVP===
High levels of AVP secretion may lead to [[hyponatremia]]. In many cases, the AVP secretion is appropriate (due to severe hypovolemia), and the state is labelled "hypovolemic hyponatremia". In certain disease states ([[heart failure]], [[nephrotic syndrome]]) the body fluid volume is increased but AVP production is not suppressed for various reasons; this state is labelled "hypervolemic hyponatremia". A proportion of cases of hyponatremia feature neither hyper- nor hypovolemia. In this group (labelled "euvolemic hyponatremia"), AVP secretion is either driven by a lack of [[cortisol]] or [[thyroxine]] ([[hypoadrenalism]] and [[hypothyroidism]], respectively) or a very low level of urinary solute excretion ([[potomania]], low-protein diet), or it is entirely inappropriate. This last category is classified as the [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH).<ref name=Verbalis2007>{{cite journal |author=Verbalis JG, Goldsmith SR, Greenberg A, Schrier RW, Sterns RH |title=Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations |journal=Am.

SIADH in turn can be caused by a number of problems. Some forms of [[cancer]] can cause SIADH, particularly [[small cell lung carcinoma]] but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs has been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants ([[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s and [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s), the anticonvulsant [[carbamazepine]], [[oxytocin]] (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug [[vincristine]]. Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation.<ref name=Verbalis2007/>

Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of [[vasopressin receptor antagonist]]s.<ref name=Verbalis2007/>

==Pharmacology==

===Vasopressin analogues===
Vasopressin agonists are used therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue [[desmopressin]] is used in conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, as well as for control of bleeding (in some forms of [[von Willebrand disease]] and in mild [[haemophilia A]]) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. [[Terlipressin]] and related analogues are used as [[vasoconstrictor]]s in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for [[esophageal varices]] commenced in 1970.<ref name="Baum_1970">{{cite journal | author = Baum S, Nusbaum M, Tumen HJ | title = The control of gastrointestinal hemorrhage by selective mesenteric infusion of pitressin | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 926 | year = 1970 | pmid = | doi = | url =  }}<!--PMID not found--></ref> 

Vasopressin infusion has also been used as a second line of management in [[septic shock]] patients not responding to high dose of [[inotrope]]s (e.g., [[dopamine]] or [[norepinephrine]]).

===The role of vasopressin analogues in cardiac arrest===
Injection of vasopressors for the treatment of [[cardiac arrest]] was first suggested in the literature in 1896 when Austrian scientist Dr. R. Gottlieb described the vasopressor [[epinephrine]] as an "infusion of a solution of suprarenal extract [that] would restore circulation when the blood pressure had been lowered to unrecordable levels by chloral hydrate."<ref name="Pearson">{{cite journal | author = Pearson JW, Redding JS | title = The role of epinephrine in cardiac resuscitation | journal = Anesth.

Pearson and Dr. Joseph Stafford Redding in which they demonstrated improved outcomes with the use of adjunct intracardiac epinephrine injection during resuscitation attempts after induced cardiac arrest.<ref name=Pearson /> Also contributing to the idea that vasopressors may be useful treatments in cardiac arrest are studies performed in the early to mid 1990's that found significantly higher levels of endogenous serum vasopressin in adults after successful resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest compared to those who did not live.<ref name="pmid1329579">{{cite journal | author = Lindner KH, Strohmenger HU, Ensinger H, Hetzel WD, Ahnefeld FW, Georgieff M | title = Stress hormone response during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 662–8 | year = 1992 | month = October | pmid = 1329579 | doi =10.1097/00000542-199210000-00008 }}</ref><ref name="pmid8673752">{{cite journal | author = Lindner KH, Haak T, Keller A, Bothner U, Lurie KG | title = Release of endogenous vasopressors during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation | journal = Heart | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–50 | year = 1996 | month = February | pmid = 8673752 | pmc = 484250 | doi =10.1136/hrt.75.2.145 }}</ref> Results of animal models have supported the use of either vasopressin or epinephrine in cardiac arrest resuscitation attempts, showing improved coronary perfusion pressure<ref name="Aung">{{cite journal | author = Aung K, Htay T | title = Vasopressin for cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Arch.

Although both vasopressors, vasopressin and [[epinephrine]] differ in that vasopressin does not have direct effects on [[cardiac contractility]] as epinephrine does.<ref name=Williamson/> Thus, vasopressin is theorized to be of increased benefit over epinephrine in cardiac arrest due to its properties of not increasing myocardial and cerebral oxygen demands.<ref name=Williamson /> This idea has led to the advent of several studies searching for the presence of a clinical difference in benefit of these two treatment choices.
