'''Chorionic villus sampling''' ('''CVS'''), sometimes misspelled "chorionic ''villous'' sampling",<ref>A [[PubMed]] search yields 168 papers using ''chorionic villous'' as of June 15, 2011.</ref> is a form of [[prenatal diagnosis]] to determine [[chromosomal abnormalities|chromosomal]] or [[genetic disorders]] in the [[fetus]]. It entails [[sampling (medicine)|sampling]] of the [[chorionic villus]] ([[placenta]]l tissue) and testing it for chromosomal abnormalities, usually with [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|FISH]] or [[PCR]]. CVS usually takes place at 10–12 weeks' gestation, earlier than [[amniocentesis]] or [[percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling]]. It is the preferred technique before 15 weeks.<ref name="pmid12535386">{{cite journal |author=Alfirevic Z, von Dadelszen P |title=Instruments for chorionic villus sampling for prenatal diagnosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD000114 |year=2003 |pmid=12535386 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000114 |editor1-last=Alfirevic |editor1-first=Zarko}}</ref>

CVS was performed for the first time by Italian biologist [[Giuseppe Simoni]], scientific director of [[Biocell Center]], in 1983.<ref name="Lancet">[http://www.thelancet.com/search/results?searchTerm=simoni&fieldName=Authors&year=1983&volume=&page=&journalFromWhichSearchStarted=&sort=date&order=desc&collectionName=Medline (Lancet, 1983)]</ref>

Use as early as 8 weeks in special circumstances has been described.<ref name="pmid12066086">{{cite journal |author=Wapner RJ, Evans MI, Davis G, ''et al.'' |title=Procedural risks versus theology: chorionic villus sampling for Orthodox Jews at less than 8 weeks' gestation |journal=Am.

It can be performed in a transcervical or transabdominal manner.<ref name="pmid12917956">{{cite journal |author=Alfirevic Z, Sundberg K, Brigham S |title=Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling for prenatal diagnosis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD003252 |year=2003 |pmid=12917956 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003252 |editor1-last=Alfirevic |editor1-first=Zarko}}</ref>

Although this procedure is mostly associated with testing for [[Down Syndrome]], overall, CVS can detect more than 200 disorders.<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003406.htm</ref>

==Indications==
Possible reasons for having a CVS can include:
*Abnormal first trimester screen results
*Increased [[nuchal translucency]] or other abnormal [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]] findings
*Family history of a [[chromosomal abnormality]] or other [[genetic disorder]]
*Parents are known carriers for a [[genetic disorders|genetic disorder]]

* Advanced maternal age (maternal age above 35). AMA is associated with increase risk of [[Down's syndrome]] and at age 35, risk is 1:400.<ref>[http://pregnancysigns.blogspot.com/2011/03/down-syndrome-screenings.html Incidence of Down syndrome | Pregnancy Signs Blog]</ref> Screening test are usually carried out first before deciding if CVS should be done.

==Risks==
Risk of miscarriage in CVS is about 0.5 - 1%. Apart from a risk of miscarriage, there is a risk of infection and [[amniotic fluid]] leakage. The resulting amniotic fluid leak can develop into a condition known as [[oligohydramnios]], which is low amniotic fluid level. If the resulting oligohydramnios is not treated and the amniotic fluid continues to leak it can result in the baby developing hypoplastic lungs (underdeveloped lungs).  

Additionally, there is also mild risk of Limb Reduction Defects associated with CVS, with the risk being higher the earlier the procedure is carried.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00038393.htm US CDC MMWR Recommendations and Reports: Chorionic Villus Sampling and Amniocentesis: Recommendations for Prenatal Counseling, July 21, 1995 / 44(RR-9);1-12]</ref>

It is important after having CVS that the [[obstetrician]] follow the patient closely to ensure the patient does not develop infection.

==Chorionic Villi and stem cells==
Recent studies have discovered that chorionic villi can be a rich source of fetal stem cells, multipotent [[mesenchymal stem cells|mesenchymal]] stem cells<ref name="wash_post">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/07/AR2007010700674.html|title=Scientists See Potential In Amniotic Stem Cells | work=The Washington Post | first=Rick | last=Weiss | date=2007-01-08 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref><ref name="nature">{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v25/n1/abs/nbt1274.html|title=Isolation of amniotic stem cell lines with potential for therapy}}</ref><ref name="urlStem Cells - BiocellCenter">{{cite web |url=http://www.biocellcenter.com/en/services_research/stem_cells/ |title=Stem Cells – BiocellCenter|accessdate=2010-01-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100111035407/http://www.biocellcenter.com/en/services_research/stem_cells/| archivedate= 11 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> 

A potential benefit of using fetal stem cells over those obtained from embryos is that they side-step [[stem cell controversy|ethical concerns]] among anti-abortion activists by obtaining pluripotent lines of undifferentiated cells without harm to a fetus or destruction of an embryo. These stem cells would also, if used to treat the same individual they came from, sidestep the donor/recipient issue which has so far stymied all attempts to use donor-derived stem cells in therapies. 

Artificial heart valves, working tracheas, as well as muscle, fat, bone, heart, neural and liver cells have all been engineered through use of fetal stem cells <ref name="urlStem cells scientific updates - BiocellCenter">{{cite web |url=http://www.biocellcenter.com/en/services_research/scientific_updates/ |title=Stem cells scientific updates – BiocellCenter |accessdate=2010-01-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100111035235/http://www.biocellcenter.com/en/services_research/scientific_updates/| archivedate= 11 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Limitations==
A small percentage (1-2%) of pregnancies have [[confined placental mosaicism]], where some but not all of the [[placenta]]l cells tested in the CVS are abnormal, even though the pregnancy is unaffected.<ref name=Wapner>{{cite journal | last =Wapner | first =Ronald | title =Invasive prenatal diagnostic techniques | journal =Seminars in Perinatology | volume =29 | issue =6  | pages =401–4 | month =December | year =2005 | doi =10.1053/j.semperi.2006.01.003 | pmid =16533654}}</ref> Cells from the mother can be mixed with the [[placenta]]l cells obtained from the CVS procedure.  Occasionally if these maternal cells are not completely separated from the [[placenta]]l sample, this can lead to discrepancies with the results.  This phenomenon is called Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC).<ref name=Wapner/>  CVS cannot detect all birth defects.  It is used for testing [[chromosomal abnormalities]] or other specific [[genetic disorders]] only if there is family history or other reason to test.
