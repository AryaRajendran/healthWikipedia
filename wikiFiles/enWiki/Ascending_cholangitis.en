'''Ascending cholangitis''' or '''acute cholangitis''' (or sometimes '''cholangitis''' without a modifier - from Greek ''chol''-, bile + ''ang''-, vessel + ''itis''-, [[inflammation]]) is an [[infection]] of the [[bile duct]] (cholangitis), usually caused by [[bacteria]] ascending from [[Ampulla of Vater|its junction]] with the [[duodenum]] (first part of the [[small intestine]]). It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by [[gallstone]]s.<ref name=Kinney/><ref name=schwartz/>

Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is regarded as a [[medical emergency]].<ref name=Kinney/> Characteristic symptoms include [[jaundice]], [[fever]], [[abdominal pain]], and in severe cases, [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and [[mental confusion|confusion]]. Initial treatment is with [[intravenous fluid]]s and [[antibiotic]]s, but there is often an underlying problem (such as [[gallstone]]s or [[Stenosis|narrowing]] in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of [[endoscopy]] to relieve obstruction of the bile duct.<ref name=Kinney/><ref name=Williams/>

==Signs and symptoms==
A person with cholangitis may complain of [[abdominal pain]] (particularly in the [[right upper quadrant]] of the [[Human abdomen|abdomen]]), [[fever]], [[rigor (medicine)|rigors]] (uncontrollable shaking) and a feeling of uneasiness ([[malaise]]). Some may report [[jaundice]] (yellow discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes).<ref name=Kinney>{{cite journal | author=Kinney TP | title=Management of ascending cholangitis | journal=Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am | year=2007 | month=April | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=289–306 | pmid=17556149 | doi=10.1016/j.giec.2007.03.006}}</ref>

[[Physical examination]] findings typically include [[jaundice]] and [[right upper quadrant]] tenderness.<ref name=Kinney/> [[Charcot's cholangitis triad|Charcot's triad]] is a set of three common findings in cholangitis: abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever.<ref name=Charcot>{{cite book | author=Charcot JM | title=Leçons sur les maladies du foie, des voies biliaires et des reins faites à la Faculté de médecine de Paris: Recueillies et publiées par Bourneville et Sevestre | location=Paris | publisher=Bureaux du Progrés Médical & Adrien Delahaye | origyear=1877 | year=2004 | isbn=1-4212-1387-7}}</ref> This was assumed in the past to be present in 50–70% of cases, although more recently the frequency has been reported as 15–20%.<ref name=Kinney/> [[Reynolds' pentad]] includes the findings of Charcot's triad with the presence of [[septic shock]] and [[mental confusion]].<ref name=Reynolds>{{cite journal | author=Reynolds BM, Dargan EL | title=Acute obstructive cholangitis; a distinct clinical syndrome | journal=Ann Surg | year=1959 | month=August | volume=150 | issue=2 | pages=299–303 | pmid=13670595 | pmc=1613362 | doi=10.1097/00000658-195908000-00013}}</ref> This combination of symptoms indicates worsening of the condition and the development of [[sepsis]], and is seen less commonly still.<ref name="Kinney"/><ref name=schwartz>{{cite book |author=Oddsdόttir M, Hunter JG | editor=Brunicardi FC, Anderson DK, Billiar TR, Dunn DL, Hunter JG, Pollock RE | title=Schwartz's Principles of Surgery | edition=Eighth | year= 2005 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | isbn=0-07-141090-2 | chapter=Gallbladder and the extrahepatic biliary system (chapter 31) | page=1203}}</ref> 

In the elderly, the presentation may be atypical; they may directly collapse due to septicemia without first showing typical features.<ref name=schwartz/> Those with an indwelling stent in the bile duct ([[#Causes|see below]]) may not develop jaundice.<ref name=schwartz/>

==Causes==
Bile duct obstruction, which is usually present in acute cholangitis, is generally due to [[gallstone]]s. 10–30% of cases, however, are due to other causes such as [[benign]] stricturing (narrowing of the bile duct without an underlying tumor), postoperative damage or an altered structure of the bile ducts such as narrowing at the site of an [[anastomosis]] (surgical connection) and various tumors ([[cholangiocarcinoma|cancer of the bile duct]], [[gallbladder cancer]], cancer of the [[ampulla of Vater]], [[pancreatic cancer]] or [[small intestine cancer|cancer of the duodenum]]).<ref name=Kimura2007>{{cite journal | author=Kimura Y, Takada T, Kawarada Y ''et al.'' | title=Definitions, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of acute cholangitis and cholecystitis: Tokyo Guidelines | journal=J Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg | year=2007 | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=15–26 | pmid=17252293 | doi=10.1007/s00534-006-1152-y | pmc=2784509}}</ref> Cholangitis may also complicate medical procedures involving the bile duct, especially ERCP. To prevent this, it is recommended that those undergoing ERCP for any indication receive prophylactic (preventative) antibiotics.<ref name=Williams/>

The presence of a permanent biliary stent (e.g. in pancreatic cancer) slightly increases the risk of cholangitis, but stents of this type are often needed to keep the bile duct patent under outside pressure.<ref name=Kinney/>

==Diagnosis==
===Blood tests===
Routine [[blood test]]s show features of acute inflammation (raised [[white blood cell]] count and elevated [[C-reactive protein]] level), and usually abnormal [[liver function tests]] (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised [[bilirubin]], [[alkaline phosphatase]] and [[Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase|γ-glutamyl transpeptidase]]. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in [[hepatitis]], with elevations in [[alanine transaminase]] and [[aspartate transaminase]].<ref name=Kinney/>

[[Blood culture]]s are often performed in people with fever and evidence of acute infection. These yield the bacteria causing the infection in 36% of cases,<ref name="Sung">{{cite journal | author=Sung JJ, Lyon DJ, Suen R, Chung SC, Co AL, Cheng AF, Leung JW, Li AK | title=Intravenous ciprofloxacin as treatment for patients with acute suppurative cholangitis: a randomized, controlled clinical trial |journal= J Antimicrob Chemother | volume=35 | issue=6 | pages=855–864 | month=June | year=1995 | pmid=7559196 | doi=10.1093/jac/35.6.855 }}</ref> usually after 24–48 hours of incubation. Bile, too, may be sent for culture during ERCP (see below). The most common bacteria linked to ascending cholangitis are [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] [[bacilli]]: ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (25–50%), [[Klebsiella]] (15–20%) and [[Enterobacter]] (5–10%). Of the [[gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]] [[Coccus|cocci]], [[Enterococcus]] causes 10–20%. A small proportion of cases, especially in the [[elderly]] and those who have undergone previous surgery of the [[biliary system]], is due to [[anaerobic organism]]s such as [[Clostridium]] and [[Bacteroides]]. In the [[developing world]], cholangitis may also be caused by parasites such as ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'' and ''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]''. In people with [[AIDS]], a large number of opportunistic organisms has been known to cause ''AIDS cholangiopathy'', but the risk has rapidly diminished since the introduction of [[Antiretroviral drug|effective AIDS treatment]].<ref name=Kinney/>

===Medical imaging===
[[File:ERCP stone.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cholangiography|Cholangiogram]] through a nasobiliary drain showing the common bile duct in black (diagonally from top left to bottom right in the center) with an interruption in the contour due to a large [[gallstone]].]]
Given that ascending cholangitis usually occurs in the setting of bile duct obstruction, various forms of [[medical imaging]] may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]], as this is the most easily available.<ref name=Kinney/> Ultrasound may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones further down the bile duct. Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and [[cholecystitis]] (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound.<ref name=Varghese>{{cite journal |author=Varghese JC, Liddell RP, Farrell MA, Murray FE, Osborne DH, Lee MJ |title=Diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and ultrasound compared with direct cholangiography in the detection of choledocholithiasis |journal=Clin Radiol |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10650107 |doi=10.1053/crad.1999.0319}}</ref> A better test is [[magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography]] (MRCP), which uses [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP.<ref name=Varghese/> Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending on the quality of the hospital's facilities.<ref name=Kinney/>

The [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] (best possible) test for biliary obstruction is still [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP). This involves the use of [[endoscopy]] (passing a tube through the mouth into the [[esophagus]], [[stomach]] and thence to the [[duodenum]]) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, [[radiocontrast]] is injected to opacify the duct, and [[X-ray]]s are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct, or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as [[Cholangiography|cholangiograms]]), gallstones are visible as nonopacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.<ref name=Kinney/>

If other causes rather than gallstones are suspected (such as a [[tumor]]), [[computed tomography]] and [[endoscopic ultrasound]] (EUS) may be performed to identify the nature of the obstruction. EUS may be used to obtain [[biopsy]] (tissue sample) of suspicious masses.<ref name=Kinney/> EUS may also replace diagnostic ERCP for stone disease, although this depends on local availability.<ref name=Williams>{{cite journal | author=Williams EJ, Green J, Beckingham I, Parks R, Martin D, Lombard M | title=Guidelines on the management of common bile duct stones | journal=Gut | year=2008 | volume=57 | pages=1004–1021 | pmid=18321943 | doi=10.1136/gut.2007.121657 | url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/57/7/1004 | issue=7}}</ref>

==Pathogenesis==
[[File:Biliary system new.svg|thumb|Diagram showing liver and related parts of the digestive system]]
Bile is produced by the liver, and serves to eliminate [[cholesterol]] and [[bilirubin]] from the body, as well as [[Emulsion|emulsifying]] of [[Lipids|fats]] to make them more soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by [[hepatocyte]]s (liver cells) and excreted into the [[common hepatic duct]]. Part of the bile is stored in the [[gall bladder]] because of back pressure (exerted by the [[sphincter of Oddi]]), and may be released at time of digestion. The gall bladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the [[duodenum]] (first part of the small intestine) through the [[common bile duct]] and the [[ampulla of Vater]]. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[Pancreatic juice|secretions]] into the digestive tract.<ref name=Kinney/>

The biliary tree is normally relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi acts as a mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 [[centimetre of water|cmH<sub>2</sub>O]])<ref>{{cite book | author=Dooley JS | title=Oxford textbook of clinical hepatology | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-19-262515-2 | page=1650 }}</ref> and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow establishment of an infection. The constitution of bile&mdash;[[bile salt]]s<ref name=Kinney/> and [[immunoglobulin]]<ref name=schwartz/> secreted by the [[epithelium]] of the bile duct also has a protective role.

Bacterial contamination alone in absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis.<ref name=schwartz/> However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O)<ref name=Huang>{{cite journal |author=Huang T, Bass JA, Williams RD |title=The significance of biliary pressure in cholangitis |journal=Arch Surg |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=629–632 |year=1969 |month=May |pmid=4888283 }}</ref> resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens spaces between the cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile in contact with the blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of [[Kupffer cells]], which are specialized [[macrophage]] cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of [[IgA]] immunoglobulins in the bile.<ref name=Sung2>{{cite journal |author=Sung JY, Costerton JW, Shaffer EA |title=Defense system in the biliary tract against bacterial infection |journal=Dig Dis Sci |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=689–96 |year=1992 |month=May |pmid=1563308 |doi= 10.1007/BF01296423|url=}}</ref> This results in [[bacteremia]] (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) comprising fever (often with [[Rigor (medicine)|rigors]]), [[tachycardia]], increased [[respiratory rate]] and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called [[sepsis]].<ref name=Kinney/> Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the [[immune system]] and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells ([[neutrophil granulocyte]]s) and modifying the levels of immune hormones ([[cytokine]]s).<ref name=Kinney/>

In ascending cholangitis, it is assumed that organisms migrate backwards up the bile duct as a result of partial obstruction and decreased function of the sphincter of Oddi.<ref name=Kinney/> Other theories about the origin of the bacteria, such as through the [[portal vein]] or transmigration from the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], are considered less likely.<ref name=Kinney/>

==Treatment==
===Fluids and antibiotics===
Cholangitis requires admission to hospital. [[Intravenous fluid]]s are administered, especially if the blood pressure is low, and [[antibiotic]]s are commenced. [[Empirical treatment]] with [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of [[penicillin]]s and [[aminoglycoside]]s are widely used, although [[ciprofloxacin]] has been shown to be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. [[Metronidazole]] is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10&nbsp;days.<ref name=Kinney/> Drugs that increase the blood pressure ([[Vasoconstriction|vasopressors]]) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.<ref name=schwartz/>

===Endoscopy===
The definitive treatment for cholangitis is relief of the underlying biliary obstruction.<ref name=Kinney/> This is usually deferred until 24–48&nbsp;hours after admission, when the patient is stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but may need to happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment,<ref name=Kinney/> or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which happens in 15% of cases).<ref name=schwartz/><ref name=Williams/>

[[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP) is the most common approach in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a [[fiberoptic]] tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the [[common bile duct]]; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon.<ref name=Heo>{{cite journal |author=Heo JH, Kang DH, Jung HJ, ''et al.'' |title=Endoscopic sphincterotomy plus large-balloon dilation versus endoscopic sphincterotomy for removal of bile-duct stones |journal=Gastrointest Endosc |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=720–6; quiz 768, 771 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17905013 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2007.02.033}}</ref> Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical [[lithotriptor]] in order to crush the stone prior to removal.<ref name=Caddy>{{cite journal |author=Caddy GR, Tham TC |title=Gallstone disease: Symptoms, diagnosis and endoscopic management of common bile duct stones |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=1085–101 |year=2006 |pmid=17127190 |doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2006.03.002}}</ref> Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by [[ESWL|extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy]].

Narrowed areas may be bridged by a [[stent]], a hollow tube that keeps the duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in uncomplicated gallstone disease, while permanent [[Self-expandable metallic stent|self-expanding metal stents]] with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as [[pancreatic cancer]]. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It is similar to a [[nasogastric tube]], but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment.<ref name=Kinney/> Certain treatments may be unsafe if [[coagulation|blood clotting]] is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as [[clopidogrel]] (which inhibits [[platelet]] aggregation) or if the [[prothrombin time]] is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, [[vitamin K]] or [[fresh frozen plasma]] may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.<ref name=Kinney/>

It may be difficult to obtain endoscopic access to the obstruction located higher ([[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]]) up in the biliary system, or when it is due to a stricture in the priorly performed [[Anastomosis#Medicine|anastomosis]] between the bile duct (surgically joining) with the duodenum or [[jejunum]].<ref name=schwartz/> When this happens, [[percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography]] (PTC) may be needed to relieve pressure. This involves identifying the bile duct by ultrasound and then passing a tube through the skin (percutaneous).<ref name=Williams/> PTC is generally performed by [[radiology|radiologists]]. PTC has potential complications, so occasionally further attempts at ERCP by more experienced doctors are preferred.<ref name=Kinney/>

Continual contamination of bile duct by indwelling stents (as may occur in chronic conditions like tumor of the [[head of pancreas]]) requires monitoring by repeated radiologic tests and changing of the stents.<ref name=schwartz/>

=== Cholecystectomy ===
Not all gallstones implicated in ascending cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but [[cholecystectomy]] (surgical removal of the gallbladder) is generally recommended in people who have been treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones.<ref name=Kinney/><ref name=schwartz/><ref name=Williams/> Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have an increased risk of recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or related procedures; the risk of death is also significantly increased.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McAlister VC, Davenport E, Renouf E |title=Cholecystectomy deferral in patients with endoscopic sphincterotomy |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD006233 |year=2007 |pmid=17943900 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006233.pub2 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006233/frame.html |editor1-last=McAlister |editor1-first=Vivian}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Acute cholangitis carries a significant risk of death, the leading cause being irreversible [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] with [[multiple organ failure]] (a possible complication of severe infections).<ref name=Kimura2007/> Improvements in diagnosis and treatment have led to a reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%.<ref name=Kimura2007/> Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are likely to die unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include [[heart failure]] and [[pneumonia]].<ref name=LaiEtAl1990>{{cite journal  | author = Lai EC, Tam PC, Paterson IA, Ng MM, Fan ST, Choi TK, Wong J | title = Emergency surgery for severe acute cholangitis.

Risk factors indicating an increased risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of [[cirrhosis|liver cirrhosis]], biliary narrowing due to [[cancer]], [[acute renal failure]] and the presence of [[liver abscess]]es.<ref name=GigotEtAl1989>{{cite journal | author=Gigot JF, Leese T, Coutinho J, Castaing D, Bismuth H | title=Acute cholangitis.

==Epidemiology==
In the Western world, about 15% of all people have gallstones in their gallbladder but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over ten&nbsp;years, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of [[biliary colic]] (abdominal pain due to the passage of gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: [[acute pancreatitis]], [[cholecystitis]] or acute cholangitis.<ref name=Williams/> Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and [[body mass index]] (a marker of [[obesity]]). However, risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after [[bariatric surgery|weight loss surgery]]) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bateson MC |title=Fortnightly review: gallbladder disease |journal=BMJ |volume=318 |issue=7200 |pages=1745–8 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10381713 |pmc=1116086 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7200/1745}}</ref>

==History==
Dr [[Jean-Martin Charcot]], working at the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière Hospital]] in Paris, France, is credited with early reports of cholangitis, as well as his eponymous triad, in 1877.<ref name=Charcot/> He referred to the condition as "hepatic fever" (''fièvre hépatique'').<ref name=Charcot/><ref name=Kimura2007/> Dr Benedict M. Reynolds, an American surgeon, reignited interest in the condition in his 1959 report with colleague Dr Everett L. Dargan, and formulated the pentad that carries his name.<ref name=Reynolds/> It remained a condition generally treated by surgeons, with exploration of the bile duct and excision of gallstones, until the ascendancy of ERCP in 1968.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCune WS, Shorb PE, Moscovitz H |title=Endoscopic cannulation of the ampulla of vater: a preliminary report |journal=Ann Surg |volume=167 |issue=5 |pages=752–6 |year=1968 |month=May |pmid=5646296 |pmc=1387128 |doi=10.1097/00000658-196805000-00013}}</ref> ERCP is generally performed by internal medicine or gastroenterology specialists. In 1992 it was shown that ERCP was generally safer than surgical intervention in ascending cholangitis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM199206113262401 |author=Lai EC, Mok FP, Tan ES, ''et al.'' |title=Endoscopic biliary drainage for severe acute cholangitis |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=326 |issue=24 |pages=1582–6 |year=1992 |month=June |pmid=1584258}}</ref>
