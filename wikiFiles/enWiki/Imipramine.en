'''Imipramine''' ('''Tofranil'''), also known as '''melipramine''', is an a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA) of the [[dibenzazepine]] group. Imipramine is mainly used in the treatment of [[major depressive disorder|major depression]] and [[enuresis]] (inability to control urination).

It has also been evaluated for use in [[panic disorder]].<ref name="pmid12823079">{{cite journal |author=Lepola U, Arató M, Zhu Y, Austin C |title=Sertraline versus imipramine treatment of comorbid panic disorder and major depressive disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=654–62 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=12823079 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v64n0606|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2003/v64n06/v64n0606.pdf}}</ref>

==Therapeutic uses==
Imipramine is used in the treatment of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety and has similar efficacy to the antidepressant drug [[moclobemide]].<ref name="pmid8557884">{{cite journal |author=Delini-Stula A, Mikkelsen H, Angst J |title=Therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants in agitated anxious depression--a meta-analysis of moclobemide studies |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=35 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–30 |year=1995 |month=October |pmid=8557884 |doi=10.1016/0165-0327(95)00034-K }}</ref>

== History ==
Imipramine was, in the late 1950s, the first tricyclic antidepressant to be developed (by [[Ciba-Geigy|Ciba]]). At the first international congress of neuro-pharmacology in Rome, September 1958 Dr Freyhan from the University of Pennsylvania, USA, discussed as one of the first clinicians the effects of imipramine in a group of 46 patients, most of them were diagnosed as 'depressive psychosis'. The patients were selected for this study based on symptoms such as depressive apathy, kinetic retardation and feelings of hoplessness and despair. In 30% of all patients he reported 'optimal results and in around 20% failure. The side effects noted were classified as ' atropine-like and most patients suffered from dizziness.
Imipramine was first tried against psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, but proved insufficient.  As an antidepressant, it did well in clinical studies and it is known to work well in even the most severe cases of depression.<ref>Healy, David: ''The Antidepressant Era'', page 211. Harvard University Press, 1997.</ref> It is not surprising, therefore, that Imipramine is also known to cause a high rate of manic and hypomanic reactions, especially in patients with preexisting bipolar disorder. It is estimated that up to 25% of such patients maintained on Imipramine will switch into mania or hypomania.<ref name="urlSpringerLink - Journal Article">{{cite journal

At the advent of [[SSRI]]s, its sometimes intolerable side-effect profile became more tolerable. Therefore, it became extensively used as a standard antidepressant and later served as a prototypical drug for the development of the later-released tricyclics. It is not as commonly used today, but is sometimes used to treat major depression as a second-line treatment. It has also seen limited use in the treatment of [[migraine]]s, [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], and [[post concussive syndrome]]. Imipramine has additional indications for the treatment of [[panic attacks]], [[chronic pain]], and [[Kleine-Levin syndrome]]. In pediatric patients, it is relatively frequently used to treat [[pavor nocturnus]] and [[nocturnal enuresis]].

== Mechanism of action ==

Imipramine, a [[tertiary amine]], affects numerous neurotransmitter systems known to be involved in the etiology of depression, anxiety, [[ADHD]], enuresis and numerous other mental and physical conditions. Imipramine is similar in structure to some muscle relaxants, and has a significant analgesic effect and, thus, is very useful in some pain conditions. 

The mechanisms of Imipramine's medicinal action include, but are not limited to, effects on: 

* '''[[Serotonin]]''' (5-HT): Very strong reuptake inhibition. Imipramine has the second highest attraction for the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) in the [[tricyclic antidepressant]] class behind [[clomipramine]].  This provides a very strong and proportional effect on the blockade of serotonin reuptake.  Moderating this effect, however, is imipramine's continual conversion in the body to its metabolite [[desipramine]], which has extremely strong and relatively selective noradrenergic effects.  This blend of imipramine and desipramine circulating together within the body provides a powerful one-two punch in simultaneously blockading both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.

* '''[[Norepinephrine]]''' (NE): Strong reuptake inhibition.

* '''[[Dopamine]]''' (DA): Reuptake and release at D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors. Similar but less potent than psychostimulants, dopamine agonists, and the atypical antidepressant [[bupropion]] on dopaminergic mechanisms (increase in release and blockade of reuptake inhibition). While this effect is much less than the primary effects on NE, SER and ACh, it is nonetheless significant and is partially responsible for the therapeutic benefits of treatment with Imipramine. Enhancement of brain dopamine activity has been implicated in Imipramine's ability to stimulate motor activity and prolong time spent in escape in mice. Regarding dopamine uptake, imipramine is far less potent than most other antidepressants (for example, it has only 5% of the potency of [[amitryptiline]] or [[paroxetine]], see the table below).{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

* '''[[Acetylcholine]]''' (ACh): Imipramine is an [[anticholinergic]]. Thus, it is prescribed with caution to the elderly and with extreme caution to those with psychosis, as the general brain activity enhancement in combination with the "dementing" effects of anticholinergics increases the potential of Imipramine to cause hallucinations, confusion and delirium in this population. Imipramine is an antagonist at M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see external links). The blockade of cholinergic (muscarine) receptors is known to cause [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], potentially contributing to the mood lifting effects of Imipramine as well. Antimuscarinic effect is also responsible for rapid heart rate (tachycardia).

* '''[[Epinephrine]]''': Imipramine antagonizes adreno-receptors (II), thus sometimes causing increased heart rate (contributed to by other effects as well), orthostatic hypotension, and a general decrease in the responsiveness of the central nervous system (hence, a contribution to its potent anti-anxiety properties).
 
* '''[[Sigma receptor|σ receptor]] and Enkephalinase''': Activity on σ-receptors is present, but it is very low (Ki of 520 nM on σ-receptors, see references) and it is about half the power of amitryptiline (300 nM).

* '''[[Histamine]]''': Imipramine is an antagonist at histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. This contributes to the acute sedative effect that it has in most people. In turn, its anti-histaminergic and general calming effects take place immediately, and, thus, Imipramine is sometimes prescribed as a sleep aid in low doses.

* '''[[BDNF]]''': BDNF is implicated in neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and studies suggest that depressed patients have decreased levels of BDNF and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. It is not clear how neurogenesis restores mood, as ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis in murine models do not show anxiety related or depression related behaviours.  Chronic Imipramine administration results in increased histone acetylation (which is associated with transcriptional activation and decondensed chromatin) at the hippocampal BDNF promotor, and also reduced expression of hippocampal [[Histone deacetylase 5|HDAC5]].<ref>{{cite journal

== Comparison with other antidepressants ==

The potency (affinity) of imipramine and other antidepressants on various transporters and receptors are summarized below. Data are from "Pharmacology of antidepressant", Mayo Clin Proc, May 2001, Vol 76.<ref name="pmid11357798">{{cite journal

Potency (affinity) data are expressed as the inverse of equilibrium dissociation constant multiplied by a factor of 10<sup>−7</sup>. So, the higher the number, the higher the blocking power.

Dosages specified below are significantly too high. 
* Hospitalized patients: starting with 3 times 25&nbsp;mg, increasing to 125&nbsp;mg. Up to 300&nbsp;mg may be given in resistant cases. After remission dose is often reduced to 50 to 100&nbsp;mg daily.
* Ambulatory patients: starting with 25 to 75&nbsp;mg daily, increasing up to a maximum of 200&nbsp;mg daily, after remission dose is often reduced to 50–100&nbsp;mg daily.
* Pediatric patients: starting with 10&nbsp;mg daily the dose is adjusted according to the severity of the symptoms to be treated, the side-effects encountered and the weight of the patient.

== Overdose ==

{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

The symptoms and the treatment of an '''imipramine''' overdose are largely the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants. Cardinal symptoms are cardiac (tachycardia, widened [[QRS complex]]) and neurological disturbances. Any ingestion by children should be considered as serious and potentially fatal.
