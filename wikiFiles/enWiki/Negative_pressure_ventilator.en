A '''negative pressure ventilator''', often referred to colloquially as an '''[[Iron lung|iron lung]]''', is a form of [[medical ventilator]] that enables a person to [[breathing|breathe]] when normal [[Muscles of respiration|muscle]] control has been lost or the work of breathing exceeds the person's ability. Examples of the device include the Drinker respirator and the Both respirator. The negative form of pressure ventilation has been almost entirely superseded by [[Positive pressure ventilation]] [[intubation]] or [[Biphasic cuirass ventilation|Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]].

==Method and use==
Humans, like most other animals, breathe by ''negative pressure'' breathing:<ref name=stemnet>{{cite web|author=|title=Gas Exchange in Humans|url=http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/~dpower/resp/exchange.htm|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> the rib cage expands and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] contracts, expanding the [[chest cavity]]. This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows into the lungs from the atmosphere: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.

The person using the iron lung is placed into the central chamber, a cylindrical steel drum. A door allowing the head and neck to remain free is then closed, forming a sealed, air-tight compartment enclosing the rest of the person's body. Pumps that control airflow periodically decrease and increase the [[air pressure]] within the chamber, and particularly, on the chest. When the pressure is below that within the lungs, the lungs expand and atmospheric pressure pushes air from outside the chamber in via the person's nose and airways to keep the lungs filled; when the pressure goes above that within the lungs, the reverse occurs, and air is expelled. In this manner, the iron lung mimics the physiological action of breathing: by periodically altering intrathoracic pressure, it causes air to flow in and out of the lungs. The iron lung is a form of [[non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] therapy.

==Invention and early use==
[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum Gütersloh|Gütersloh Town Museum]]. In Germany, nowadays less than a dozen of these breathing machines are available to the public.]]
In 1670, English scientist [[John Mayow]] came up with the idea of external negative pressure ventilation. Mayow built a model consisting of bellows and a [[Waterskin|bladder]] to pull in and expel air.<ref name=Schlager2000>{{cite book|last=Schlager|first=Neil|title=Science and Its Times: Understanding the Social Significance of Scientific Discovery, Vol. 6: 1900-1950|page=348|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan|year=2000|isbn=978-0787639389}}</ref> 
The first negative pressure ventilator was described by Scottish physician [[John Dalziel]] in 1832. Successful use of similar devices was described a few years later. Early prototypes included a hand-operated bellows-driven "Spirophore" designed by Dr. Woillez of Paris (1876), and an airtight wooden box designed specifically for the treatment of polio by Dr. Stueart of South Africa (1918). Stueart's box was sealed at the waist and shoulders with clay and powered by a motor-driven bellows.<ref name="Gould">{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Tony| title=A Summer Plague: Polio and Its Survivors| publisher=[[Yale University Press]]| location=New Haven| year=1997| page=90| isbn=978-0300072761}}</ref>

The first clinical use of the Drinker respirator on a human was on October 12, 1928 at the [[Children's Hospital Boston|Children's Hospital]] in [[Boston]].<ref name=Gorham1979/><ref>[http://www.tebyan.net/Events_History/World_Events/2010/10/12/140096.html Today in History: Iron Lung Used for the First Time (1928)]</ref> The subject was an eight-year-old girl who was nearly dead as a result of [[respiratory failure]] due to [[poliomyelitis]] (often called polio or infantile paralysis).<ref name=Lehigh/> Her dramatic recovery, within less than a minute of being placed in the chamber, helped popularize the new device.<ref name=OSHHarvard/>

Danish physiologist [[August Krogh]], upon returning to Copenhagen in 1931 from a visit to New York where he saw the Drinker machine in use, constructed the first Danish respirator designed for clinical purposes. Krogh's device differed from Drinker's in that its motor was powered by water from the city pipelines. Krogh also made an infant respirator version.<ref name="Kirby">{{cite book| last=Kirby| first=Richard R.| title=Mechanical Ventilation| publisher=[[Churchill Livingstone]]| location=New York| year=1985| page=9| isbn=978-0443080630}}</ref> 

In 1931, [[John Haven Emerson]] (February 5, 1906{{spaced ndash}}February 4, 1997) introduced an improved and less expensive iron lung.<ref name=Geddes2007>{{cite journal|last=Geddes|first=LA|title=The history of artificial respiration|journal=IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine: the Quarterly Magazine of the Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society|volume=26|issue=6|pages=38–41|year=2007|pmid=18189086|doi=10.1109/EMB.2007.907081}}</ref><ref name=NMAH>{{cite web|author=|title=Iron Lung|publisher=National Museum of American History|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&objkey=114|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> The Emerson iron lung had a bed that could slide in and out of the cylinder as needed, and the tank had portal windows which allowed attendants to reach in and adjust limbs, sheets, or hot packs.<ref name=NMAH2011/> Drinker and Harvard University sued Emerson, claiming he had infringed on patent rights. Emerson defended himself by making the case that such lifesaving devices should be freely available to all.<ref name=NMAH2011/> Emerson also demonstrated that every aspect of Drinker's patents had been published or used by others at earlier times.  Since an invention must be novel to be patentable, prior publication/use of the invention meant it was not novel and therefore unpatentable. Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.

The United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1933 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis. Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name="Wills">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=51-2| isbn=978-1840186116}}</ref><ref name="Thomas">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson  | publisher=''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]''| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>

==Both respirator==
[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]
{{main|Both respirator}}
The [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. While the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 102 kg), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and £2000 to land in Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around £1500 sterling. Consequently there were few of the Drinker devices in Australia and Europe.<ref name="Trubuhovich">{{cite journal |last=Trubuhovich| first=Ronald V.| title=Notable Australian contributions to the management of ventilatory failure of acute poliomyelitis| journal=Critical Care and Resuscitation| year=2006| volume=8| issue=4| pages=383–5}}</ref>

Visiting London in 1938 during another polio epidemic, Both produced additional respirators there, which attracted the attention of [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|William Morris]] (Lord Neuffield), a British motor manufacturer and philanthropist. Neuffield, intrigued by the design, financed the production of approximately 1700 machines at his [[Morris Motors|car factory]] in [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]], and donated them to hospitals throughout all parts of Britain and the British Empire.<ref name="Langmore" /> Soon, the Both-Neuffield respirators were able to be produced by the thousand at about one-thirteenth the cost of the American design.<ref name="Healey" /> By the early 1950s, there were over 700 Both-Nuffield iron lungs in the United Kingdom, compared with only 50 Drinker's models.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Ghislaine|title=The Smith-Clarke Respirator|journal=[[The Lancet]]|date=23 February 2002|volume=359|pmid=11879908}}</ref>

==Modern usage==
[[Image:Poumon artificiel.jpg|thumb|Staff in a [[Rhode Island]] hospital are examining a patient in an iron lung tank respirator during the [[History of poliomyelitis|1960 polio epidemic]]. The iron lung encased the [[thoracic cavity]] in an air-tight chamber. The chamber was used to create a negative pressure around the thoracic cavity, thereby causing air to enter the lungs to equalize [[Breathing#Mechanics|intrapulmonary pressure]].]]
Rows of iron lungs filled hospital wards at the height of the polio outbreaks of the 1940s and 1950s, assisting the breathing of children and adults (mostly children) with bulbar polio and bulbospinal polio. A polio patient with paralyzed lungs could spend up to a week inside an iron lung.<ref>http://amhistory.si.edu/polio/howpolio/ironlung.htm<br>http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/01/what-america-looked-like-polio-children-paralyzed-in-iron-lungs/251098/</ref> 

[[Polio vaccine|Polio vaccination]] programs have virtually [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradicated]] new cases of poliomyelitis in the United States. Because of this, and also the development of modern [[Medical ventilator|ventilators]] and widespread use of [[tracheal intubation]] and [[tracheotomy]], the iron lung has virtually disappeared from modern medicine. For example, in 1959, there were 1,200 people using tank respirators in the United States, but by 2004 there were only 39.<ref name=NMAH2011/>

[[Positive pressure ventilation]] systems are now more common than negative pressure systems. Positive pressure ventilators work by blowing air into the patient's lungs via [[intubation]] through the airway; they were used for the first time in [[Blegdams Hospital]], [[Copenhagen]], Denmark during a polio outbreak in 1952.<ref name=Reisner2009>{{cite web|author=Louise Reisner-Sénélar|title=The Danish anaesthesiologist Björn Ibsen a pioneer of long-term ventilation on the upper airways|year=2009|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B7CdB217pf6yN2QxOGI5NTUtZWIzYS00N2NhLWFhODQtOGZjMjdhZTlkZGE5&hl=de|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref><ref name=Wackers1994>{{cite book|last=Wackers|first=Ger|title=|chapter=Chapter 4: Theaters of truth and competence.

The iron lung now has a marginal place in modern [[respiratory therapy]]. Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[Ondine's curse]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain result in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] control of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> There are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.

==Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation==
{{main|Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation}}
[[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]] (BCV) is a modern development of the iron lung, consisting of a wearable rigid upper-body shell (a [[cuirass]]) which functions as a negative pressure ventilator. The ventilation is biphasic because the cuirass is attached to a pump which actively controls both the inspiratory and expiratory phases of the respiratory cycle. This method is a modern improvement of 'Negative Pressure Ventilation' (NPV), which could only control inspiratory breathing, relying on passive recoil for exhalation. BCV was developed by Dr Zamir Hayek, a pioneer in the field of assisted ventilation. Some of Dr Hayek's previous inventions include the Hayek Oscillator, an early form of the technology.
