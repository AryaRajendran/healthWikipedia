The '''Omaha System''' is a standardized [[health care]] [[terminology]] consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), an intervention component (Intervention Scheme), and an outcomes component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes). Approximately 11,000 interdisciplinary practitioners, educators, and researchers use Omaha System for structured clinical documentation and analysis of [[secondary data]]. Omaha System users from [[Japan]], [[Estonia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[New Zealand]], [[Wales]], [[Canada]], The [[Netherlands]], and the [[United States]] have presented at international Omaha System conferences.<ref>Martin KS.
