The '''serum-ascites albumin gradient''' or '''gap''' ('''SAAG''') is a calculation used in [[medicine]] to help determine the cause of [[ascites]].<ref name="pmid18334692">{{cite journal |author=Wong CL, Holroyd-Leduc J, Thorpe KE, Straus SE |title=Does this patient have bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension?

The formula is as follows:
:SAAG = ([[albumin]] concentration of [[Blood serum|serum]]) - (albumin concentration of ascitic fluid).

Ideally, the two values should be measured at the same time.

This phenomenon is the result of Starling's forces between the fluid of the circulatory system and ascitic fluid. Under normal circumstances the SAAG is < 1.1 because serum oncotic pressure (pulling fluid back into circulation) is exactly counterbalanced by the serum hydrostatic pressure (which pushes fluid out of the circulatory system). This balance is disturbed in certain diseases (such as the Budd-Chiari syndrome, heart failure, or liver cirrhosis) that increase the hydrostatic pressure in the circulatory system. The increase in hydrostatic pressure causes more fluid to leave the circulation into the peritoneal space (ascites). The SAAG subsequently increases because there is more free fluid leaving the circulation, diluting the albumin in the ascitic fluid. The albumin does not move across membrane spaces easily because it is a large molecule.

=== High gradient ===
A high gradient (> 1.1 g/dL) indicates the ascites is due to [[portal hypertension]] with 97% accuracy.<ref name="pmid1616215"/> This is due to increased [[hydrostatic pressure]] within the blood vessels of the [[hepatic portal system]], which in turn forces water into the [[peritoneal cavity]] but leaves proteins such as albumin within the vasculature. 

Important causes of high SAAG ascites (> 1.1 g/dL) include:
* high protein (> 2.5): [[heart failure]], [[Budd Chiari syndrome]]
* low protein (< 2.5): [[cirrhosis of the liver]],<ref>Gines P, Cardenas A, Arroyo V, Rodes J. Management of cirrhosis and ascites. N Engl J Med. 2004 15;350:1646-54. PMID 15084697</ref> nephrotic syndrome

===Low gradient===
A low gradient (< 1.1 g/dL ) indicates causes of ascites not associated with increased portal pressure such as [[tuberculosis]], [[pancreatitis]], [[nephrotic syndrome]] and various types of peritoneal [[cancer]].
