'''Morton's neuroma''' (also known as  '''Morton's metatarsalgia''', '''Morton's neuralgia''', '''plantar neuroma''' and '''intermetatarsal neuroma''') is a [[benign]] [[neuroma]] of an intermetatarsal [[plantar nerve]], most commonly of the second and third intermetatarsal spaces (between 2nd-3rd and 3rd-4th metatarsal heads). 

This problem is characterised by [[pain]] and/or [[numbness]], sometimes relieved by removing [[footwear]].

Despite the name, the condition was first correctly described by a chiropodist named Durlacher,<ref>[http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/mortons_neuroma_interdigital_perineural_fibrosis Morton's Neuroma: Interdigital Perineural Fibrosis - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and although it is labeled a "neuroma", many sources do not consider it a true [[tumor]], but rather a perineural fibroma (fibrous tissue formation around nerve tissue).

==Symptoms and signs==
Symptoms include: pain on [[weight bearing]], frequently after only a short time. The nature of the pain varies widely among individuals. Some people experience shooting pain affecting the contiguous halves of two toes. Others describe a feeling like having a pebble in their shoe or walking on razor blades. [[Burning]], [[numbness]], and [[paresthesia]] may also be experienced.<ref name="">{{cite journal |author=SimonMoyes.co.uk |title= What is Morton's Neuroma? |url=http://simonmoyes.co.uk/2011/03/09/what-is-morton%e2%80%99s-neuroma/}}</ref> 

Morton's neuroma lesions have been found using MRI in patients without symptoms.<ref name="pmid10954445">{{cite journal |author=Bencardino J, Rosenberg ZS, Beltran J, Liu X, Marty-Delfaut E |title=Morton's neuroma: is it always symptomatic? |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=175 |issue=3 |pages=649–53 |year=2000 |month=September |pmid=10954445 |doi= |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10954445}}</ref>

==Diagnosis/differential diagnosis==
Negative signs include no obvious deformities, [[erythema]], signs of [[inflammation]], or limitation of movement. Direct pressure between the metatarsal heads will replicate the symptoms, as will compression of the forefoot between the finger and thumb so as to compress the transverse arch of the foot.  This is referred to as [[Mulder’s Sign]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

There are other causes of pain in the forefoot. Too often all forefoot pain is categorized as neuroma. Other conditions to consider are [[capsulitis]], which is an inflammation of ligaments that surrounds two bones, at the level of the joint. In this case, it would be the ligaments that attach the [[Phalanges|phalanx]] (bone of the toe) to the [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] bone. Inflammation from this condition will put pressure on an otherwise healthy nerve and give neuroma-type symptoms.
Additionally, an intermetatarsal [[bursitis]] between the third and fourth metatarsal bones will also give neuroma-type symptoms because it too puts pressure on the nerve. [[Freiberg's disease]], which is an [[osteochondritis]] of the metatarsal head, causes pain on weight bearing or compression.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Histopathology==
Microscopically, the affected nerve is markedly distorted, with extensive concentric perineural fibrosis. The arterioles are thickened and occlusion by thrombi are occasionally present.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reed|first=RJ|coauthors=Bliss, BO|title=Morton's neuroma. Regressive and productive intermetatarsal elastofibrositis.|journal=Archives of Pathology|date=1973 Feb|volume=95|issue=2|pages=123-9|pmid=4118941}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Scotti|first=TM|title=The lesion of Morton's metatarsalgia (Morton's toe).|journal=A.M.A. archives of pathology|date=1957 Jan|volume=63|issue=1|pages=91-102|pmid=13381291}}</ref>

==Imaging==
Though a neuroma is a soft tissue abnormality and won’t be visualized on standard radiographs, the first step in the assessment of forefoot pain is an X-ray in order to evaluate for the presence of arthritis and exclude stress fractures/reactions and focal bone lesions, which may mimic the symptoms of a neuroma. Ultrasound (sonography) accurately demonstrates thickening of the interdigital nerve within the web space of greater than 3mm, diagnostic of a Morton’s neuroma.  This typically occurs at the level of the intermetatarsal ligament. Frequently, intermetatarsal bursitis coexists with the diagnosis. Other conditions that may also be visualized with ultrasound and can be clinically confused with a neuroma include synovitis/capsulitis from the adjacent metatarsophalangeal joint, stress fractures/reaction, and plantar plate disruption.<ref name="pmid=19038613">{{cite journal |author=Gregg JM, Schneider T, Marks P |title=MR imaging and ultrasound of metatarsalgia--the lesser metatarsals |journal=Radiol Clin North Am |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1061–78 |year=2008 |pmid=19038613 |doi=10.1016/j.rcl.2008.09.004}}</ref><ref name="pmid=17958682">{{cite journal |author=Gregg JM, Marks P |title=Metatarsalgia: an ultrasound perspective |journal=Australas Radiol |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=493–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17958682 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1673.2007.01886.x}}</ref> MRI can similarly demonstrate the above conditions; however, in the setting where more than one abnormality coexists, ultrasound has the added advantage of determining which may be the source of the patient’s pain by applying direct pressure with the probe. Further to this, ultrasound can be used to guide treatment such as cortisone injections into the webspace, as well as alcohol ablation of the nerve.

==Treatment==
[[Orthotics]] and [[corticosteroid]] injections are widely used conservative treatments for Morton’s neuroma.  In addition to traditional orthotic arch supports, a small foam or fabric pad may be positioned under the space between the two affected metatarsals, immediately behind the bone ends.  This pad helps to splay the metatarsal bones and create more space for the nerve so as to relieve pressure and irritation.  It may however also elicit mild uncomfortable sensations of its own, such as the feeling of having an awkward object under one's foot.  Corticosteroid injections can relieve inflammation in some patients and help to end the symptoms.  For some patients, however, the inflammation and pain recur after some weeks or months, and corticosteroids can only be used a limited number of times because they cause progressive degeneraton of ligamentous and tendinous tissues.

Sclerosing alcohol injections are an increasingly available treatment alternative if the above management approaches fail. Dilute alcohol (4%) is injected directly into the area of the neuroma, causing toxicity to the fibrous nerve tissue. Frequently, treatment must be performed 2-7 times, with 1–3 weeks between interventions.  An 82-90% success rate has been achieved in clinical studies, equal to or exceeding the success rate for surgical neurectomy with fewer risks and less significant recovery.

If such interventions fail, patients are commonly offered surgery known as [[neurectomy]], which involves removing the affected piece of nerve tissue. Postoperative scar tissue formation (known as stump neuroma) can occur in approximately 20% of cases, causing a return of neuroma symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=NHS.CO.UK |title= treating Morton's neuroma |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/mortonsneuroma/Pages/treatmentpage.aspx }}</ref> Neurectomy can be performed using one of two general methods. Making the incision from the dorsal side (the top of the foot) is the more common method but requires cutting the deep transverse metatarsal ligament that connects the 3rd and 4th metatarsals in order to access the nerve beneath it.  This results in exaggerated postoperative splaying of the 3rd and 4th digits (toes) due to the loss of the supporting ligamentous structure. This has aesthetic concerns for some patients and possible though unquantified long-term implications for foot structure and health. Alternatively, making the incision from the ventral side (the sole of the foot) allows more direct access to the affected nerve without cutting other structures.  However, this approach requires a greater post-operative recovery time where the patient must avoid weight bearing on the affected foot because the ventral aspect of the foot is more highly enervated and impacted by pressure when standing.  It also has an increased risk that scar tissue will form in a location that causes ongoing pain.

[[Cryogenic]] [[neuroablation]] is a lesser known alternative to neurectomy surgery. Cryogenic neuroablation (also known as cryo injection therapy or cryosurgery) is a term that is used to describe the destruction of [[axons]] to prevent them from carrying painful impulses. This is accomplished by making a small incision (~3mm) and inserting a cryoneedle that applies extremely low temperatures of between &minus;50C to &minus;70C to the nerve/neuroma.<ref name="podiatrytoday.com">[http://www.podiatrytoday.com/article/2691 Cryosurgery Or Sclerosing Injections: Which Is Better For Neuromas?]</ref> This results in degeneration of the intracellular elements, [[axons]], and [[myelin]] sheath (which houses the neuroma) with [[wallerian degeneration]]. The [[epineurium]] and [[perineurium]] remain intact, thus preventing the formation of stump neuroma. The preservation of these structures differentiates cryogenic neuroablation from surgical excision and [[neurolytic]] agents such as alcohol. An initial study showed that cryo neuroablation is initially equal in effectivenesss to surgery but does not have the risk of stump neuroma formation.<ref>{{cite journal |author= A Caporusso EF, Fallat LM, Savoy-Moore R. |title=Cryogenic Neuroablation for the treatment of lower extremity neuromas |journal= J Foot Ankle Surg. |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=286–290 |year=2002 |month=Sept-Oct |pmid=12400711 |doi= 10.1016/S1067-2516(02)80046-1|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=PubMed&cmd=Search&term=cryogenic+neuroablation+for+the+treatment+of+lower+extremity+neuromas&doptcmdl=Books&log%24=bookpubmed&bname=helppubmed}}</ref> However, the results from this procedure are not considered permanent.<ref name="podiatrytoday.com"/>
