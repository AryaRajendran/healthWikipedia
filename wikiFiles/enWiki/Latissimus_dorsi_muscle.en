The '''latissimus dorsi''' (plural: ''latissimi dorsi''), meaning 'broadest [muscle] of the back' ([[Latin]] ''latus'' meaning 'broad', ''latissimus'' meaning 'broadest'  and ''dorsum'' meaning the back), is the larger, flat, dorso-lateral muscle on the trunk, posterior to the arm, and partly covered by the [[trapezius]] on its median dorsal region. ''Latissimi dorsi'' are commonly known as "'''lats'''", especially among [[bodybuilder]]s.

The latissimus dorsi is responsible for [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]], [[adduction]], transverse extension also known as horizontal abduction, flexion from an extended position, and (medial) [[internal rotation]] of the [[shoulder joint]]. It also has a [[synergistic]] role in extension and lateral flexion of the lumbar spine.

Due to bypassing the scapulothoracic joints and attaching directly to the spine, the actions the latissimi dorsi have on moving the arms can also influence the movement of the scapulae, such as their downward rotation during a [[pull up (exercise)|pull up]].

==Variations==
The number of dorsal vertebra to which it is attached vary from four to eight; the number of costal attachments varies; muscle fibers may or may not reach the crest of the ilium.

A muscular slip, the axillary arch, varying from 7 to 10&nbsp;cm in length, and from 5 to 15&nbsp;mm in breadth, occasionally springs from the upper edge of the latissimus dorsi about the middle of the posterior fold of the axilla, and crosses the axilla in front of the axillary vessels and nerves, to join the under surface of the tendon of the [[pectoralis major]], the [[coracobrachialis]], or the fascia over the [[biceps brachii]]. This axillary arch crosses the [[axillary artery]], just above the spot usually selected for the application of a ligature, and may mislead a surgeon. It is present in about 7% os and may be easily recognized by the transverse direction of its fibers.  Guy ''et al.'' extensively described this muscular variant using MRI data and positively correlated its presence with symptoms of neurological impingement.<ref>Guy MS, Sandhu SK, Gowdy JM, Cartier CC, Adams JH.  MRI of the axillary arch muscle: prevalence, anatomic relations, and potential consequences. AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2011 Jan;196(1):W52-7.</ref>    

A fibrous slip usually passes from the upper border of the tendon of the Latissimus dorsi, near its insertion, to the long head of the [[triceps brachii]]. This is occasionally muscular, and is the representative of the [[dorsoepitrochlearis brachii]] of [[ape]]s.

==Triangles==
* The lateral margin of the latissimus dorsi is separated below from the [[obliquus externus abdominis]] by a small triangular interval, the ''lumbar triangle of Petit'', the base of which is formed by the [[iliac crest]], and its floor by the [[obliquus internus abdominis]].

* Another triangle is situated behind the scapula. It is bounded above by the [[trapezius]], below by the latissimus dorsi, and laterally by the vertebral border of the scapula; the floor is partly formed by the [[rhomboideus major]]. If the [[scapula]] is drawn forward by folding the arms across the chest, and the trunk bent forward, parts of the sixth and seventh ribs and the interspace between them become subcutaneous and available for [[auscultation]]. The space is therefore known as the [[Triangle of auscultation|''triangle of auscultation'']].

*The Latissimus Dorsi can be remembered best for insertion as "The Lady Between Two Majors". As the Latissimus Dorsi inserts into the floor of the intertubercular groove of the [[humerus]] it is surrounded by two major muscles. The Teres Major inserts medially on the medial lip of the intertubercular groove and laterally the Pectoralis Major inserts into the lateral lip.

==Innervation==
The Latissimus dorsi is supplied by the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves through the [[thoracodorsal nerve|thoracodorsal (long scapular)]] nerve. [[Electromyography]] suggests that it consists of  six groups of muscle fibres that can be independently coordinated by the [[central nervous system]].<ref>Brown JM, Wickham JB, McAndrew DJ, Huang XF. (2007). Muscles within muscles: Coordination of 19 muscle segments within three shoulder muscles during isometric motor tasks. J Electromyogr Kinesiol. 17(1):57-73. PMID 16458022 {{doi|10.1016/j.jelekin.2005.10.007}}</ref>

==Training==
The power/size/strength of this muscle can be [[Weight training|trained]] with a variety of different exercises. Some of these include:
*Vertical pulling movements such as [[pulldown exercise|pull-down]]s and [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]]s (including [[chin-up]]s)
*Horizontal pulling movements such as [[bent-over row]], [[T-bar row]] and other [[rowing exercise]]s
*[[pull-over]]s
*[[deadlift]]
*[[boxing]]
Lifting under control can help reduce chances of injury.

Other types of sport and exercise are known to generate lat growth and power, such as boxing. In boxing the large number of punches thrown by a fighter on a day to day basis in training, sparring, padwork contributes to development of the lat muscles. Examples of this would be seen in boxers such as [[Manny Pacquiao]], Chris Eubank, Sam Storey, Carl Froch and Arturo Gatti, although the size difference in lats can be due to genetics as well.

===Synergists===
Most latissimus dorsi exercises concurrently recruit the [[teres major]], posterior fibres of the [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]], long head of the [[triceps brachii]], among numerous other stabilizing muscles. Compound exercises for the 'lats' typically involve elbow flexion and tend to recruit the [[biceps brachii]], [[brachialis]], and [[brachioradialis]] for this function. Depending on the line of pull, the [[trapezius]] muscles can be recruited as well; horizontal pulling motions such as rows recruit both latissimus dorsi and trapezius heavily.

===Pain===
Tight latissimus dorsi has been shown to be one cause of chronic shoulder pain and chronic back pain.<ref name=Arnheim>Arnheim, D.D., Prentice, W.E., Principles of athletic training. 9th ed. McGraw Hill, pp 570-574, 1997.</ref>  Because the latissimus dorsi connects the spine to the [[humerus]], tightness in this muscle can manifest as either sub-optimal [[glenohumeral joint]] (shoulder) function which leads to chronic pain or [[tendinitis]] in the tendinous fasciae connecting the latissimus dorsi to the thoracic and [[lumbar spine]].<ref name=Francis>Francis, P., Applied anatomy and kinesiology, supplemental materials. KB Books., p 19-25, 1999.</ref>

==Cardiac support==
For heart patients with low cardiac output and who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation, a procedure called ''[[cardiomyoplasty]]'' may support the failing heart. This procedure involves wrapping the latissimus dorsi muscles around the heart and electrostimulating them in synchrony with ventricular systole.
