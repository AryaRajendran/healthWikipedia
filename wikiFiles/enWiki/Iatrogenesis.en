'''Iatrogenesis''', or an '''iatrogenic artifact''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|aɪ|ˌ|æ|t|r|oʊ|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ɪ|k}}; "originating from a physician") is an inadvertent [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]] or [[complication (medicine)|complication]] resulting from [[medicine|medical]] treatment or advice, including that of [[psychologist]]s, [[therapist]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[physician]]s, and [[dentist]]s. Iatrogenesis is not restricted to conventional medicine; it can also result from [[complementary and alternative medicine]] treatments.

Some iatrogenic artifacts are clearly defined and easily recognized, such as a complication following a surgical procedure. Some less obvious ones can require significant investigation to identify, such as complex [[drug interaction]]s. Furthermore, some conditions have been described for which it is unknown, unproven, or even controversial whether they are iatrogenic or not; this has been encountered in particular with regard to various psychological and chronic-pain conditions. Research in these areas continues.

Causes of iatrogenesis include negative effects of drugs, chance, [[medical error]], [[negligence]], [[social control]],{{Clarify|date=October 2010}} unexamined instrument design, anxiety or annoyance related to medical procedures, and the [[adverse effect]]s or [[drug interaction|interactions]] of medications.

The term iatrogenic can also be used without negative connotation to describe the results of treatment; for example, scars created by surgery are said to be iatrogenic even though they do not represent improper care and may not be problematic.
Lymphedema, secondary to any breast cancer surgery, is a perfect example of a condition directly caused solely by the surgery itself.

==History==
[[File:Yearly mortality rates 1784-1849.png|thumb|right|500px|In his 1861 book, [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Semmelweis]] presented evidence to demonstrate that the advent of [[pathological anatomy]] in Vienna in 1823 (left vertical line) correlated with the incidence of fatal childbed fever there. Onset of chlorine handwash in 1847 marked by vertical line at far right. Rates for Dublin maternity hospital, which had no pathological anatomy, appear for comparison ([[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1784-1849|view rates]]).]]

The term '''[[wikt:en:iatrogenesis#English|iatrogenesis]]''' means ''brought forth by a healer'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] '''[[wikt:en:ἰατρός#Ancient Greek|ἰατρός]]''' (''iatros'', "healer") and '''[[wikt:en:γένεσις#Ancient Greek|γένεσις]]''' (''genesis'', "origin"); as such, in its earlier forms, it could refer to good or bad effects.

Since at least the time of [[Hippocrates]], people have recognized the potential damaging effects of a healer's actions. The old mandate "first do no harm" (''[[primum non nocere]]'') is an important clause of [[bioethics|medical ethics]], and iatrogenic illness or death caused purposefully or by avoidable error or negligence on the healer's part became a punishable offense in many civilizations.<ref>{{cite book |title=Organization Development in Healthcare: Conversations on Research and Strategies |editor=Wolf, Hanson, Moir, Friedman, Savage |date=July 12, 2011 |publisher=Emerald Group Pub |isbn=978-0-85724-709-4 |page=292 |series=Advances in Health Care Management Series #10}}</ref>

The transfer of pathogens from the autopsy room to maternity patients, leading to shocking [[historical mortality rates of puerperal fever]] (a k a "childbed fever") at maternity institutions in the 19th century, was a major iatrogenic catastrophe of that time. The infection mechanism was first identified by [[Ignaz Semmelweis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hanninen|first=O|coauthors=Farago, M.; Monos, E.|title=Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, the prophet of bacteriology|journal=Infection Control|year=1983|volume=4|issue=5|pages=367–370|pmid=6354955}}</ref>

With the development of [[scientific medicine]] in the 20th century, it could be expected that iatrogenic illness or death would be more easily avoided. [[Antiseptic]]s, [[anesthesia]], [[antibiotic]]s, and better surgical techniques have been developed to decrease iatrogenic [[death|mortality]].

==Sources==
Examples of iatrogenesis:

* [[Complication (medicine)|Risk]] associated with medical interventions
** [[Adverse effect]]s of prescription drugs
** Over-use of drugs, (causing - for example - [[antibiotic resistance]] in [[bacteria]])
** Prescription [[drug interaction]]
* [[Medical error]]
* Wrong [[Medical prescription|prescription]], perhaps due to illegible [[handwriting]], [[typos]] on computer.
* [[Negligence]]
* [[Nosocomial infection]]s
* Faulty procedures, techniques, information, methods, or equipment.

==Causes and consequences==

===Medical error and negligence===
Iatrogenic conditions do not necessarily result from ''[[medical error]]s'', such as mistakes made in [[surgery]], or the prescription or dispensing of the wrong therapy, such as a [[Medication|drug]]. In fact, intrinsic and sometimes ''[[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]]'' of a medical treatment are iatrogenic. For example, [[radiation therapy]] and [[chemotherapy]], due to the needed aggressiveness of the therapeutic agents, frequently produce iatrogenic effects such as [[hair loss]], [[anemia]], [[vomiting]], [[nausea]], [[brain damage]], [[lymphedema]], infertility, etc. The loss of functions resulting from the required removal of a diseased organ also counts as iatrogenesis, thus we find, for example, iatrogenic [[diabetes]] brought on by removal of all or part of the pancreas.

The incidence of iatrogenesis may be misleading in some cases. For example, ruptured [[aortic aneurysm]] is fatal in most cases; the survival rate for a ruptured aortic aneurysm is under 25%. Patients who die during or after an operation will still be considered as iatrogenic deaths, but the procedure itself remains a better bet than the 100% probability of death if left untreated.

Other situations may involve actual ''[[negligence]]'' or faulty procedures, such as when [[Pharmacotherapy|pharmacotherapist]]s produce handwritten prescriptions for drugs.

===Adverse effects===
A very common iatrogenic effect is caused by ''[[drug interaction]]'', i.e., when pharmacotherapists fail to check for all medications a patient is taking and prescribe new ones that interact agonistically or antagonistically (potentiate or decrease the intended therapeutic effect). Such situations can cause significant [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]]. Adverse reactions, such as [[allergy|allergic reactions]] to drugs, even when unexpected by pharmacotherapists, are also classified as iatrogenic.

The evolution of ''[[antibiotic resistance]]'' in [[bacteria]] is iatrogenic as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Finland M |title=Emergence of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, 1935-1975 |journal=Rev. Infect. Dis. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=4–22 |year=1979 |pmid=45521|doi=10.1093/clinids/1.1.4 }}</ref> Bacteria strains resistant to antibiotics have evolved in response to the overprescription of [[antibiotic]] drugs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Certain drugs are toxic in their own right in therapeutic doses because of their mechanism of action. [[Alkylating antineoplastic agent]]s, for example, cause DNA damage, which is more harmful to cancer cells than regular cells. However, alkylation causes severe side-effects and is actually [[carcinogenic]] in its own right, with potential to lead to the development of secondary tumors.  In similar manner, arsenic-based medications like [[melarsoprol]] for [[trypanosomiasis]] cause [[arsenic poisoning]].

Adverse effects can appear mechanically.  The design of some surgical instruments may be decades old, hence certain adverse effects (such as tissue trauma) may have never been properly cauterized.  Some instruments that are long-standing parts of surgical kit would be unlikely to succeed if they were introduced anew; the collateral damage one "expects" to see with their use would be unacceptable if associated with a *new* product.

===Psychology===
In psychology, iatrogenesis can occur due to [[Medical error|misdiagnosis]] (including diagnosis with a false condition as was the case of [[hystero-epilepsy]]<ref name="spanos">{{Cite book|author=Spanos, Nicholas P. |title=Multiple Identities & False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective |publisher=American Psychological Association (APA) |year=1996 |isbn=1-55798-340-2 }}</ref>).

though research is equivocal for each condition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The degree of association of any particular condition with iatrogenesis is unclear and in some cases controversial.

==Incidence and importance==
Iatrogenesis is a major phenomenon, and a severe risk to patients.
A study carried out in 1981 more than one-third of illnesses of patients in a university hospital were iatrogenic, nearly one in ten was considered major, and, in 2% of the patients, the iatrogenic disorder ended in death. Complications were most strongly associated with exposure to drugs and medications.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM198103123041104 |author=Steel K, Gertman PM, Crescenzi C, Anderson J |title=Iatrogenic illness on a general medical service at a university hospital |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=304 |issue=11 |pages=638–42 |year=1981 |pmid=7453741 }}</ref> In another study, the main factors leading to problems were inadequate patient evaluation, lack of monitoring and follow-up, and failure to perform necessary tests.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In the United States, figures suggest estimated deaths per year of:

* 12,000 due to unnecessary surgery
* 7,000 due to medication errors in hospitals
* 20,000 due to other errors in hospitals
* 80,000 due to [[nosocomial]] infections in hospitals
* 106,000 due to non-error, negative effects of drugs

Based on these figures, iatrogenesis may cause 225,000 deaths per year in the United States (excluding recognizable error).<ref name="starfield" />

These estimates are lower than those in an earlier [[Institute of Medicine|IOM]] report, which would suggest from 230,000 to 284,000 iatrogenic deaths.<ref name="starfield" />

These figures are likely exaggerated, however, as they are based on recorded deaths in hospitals rather than in the general population. Even so, the large gap separating these estimates, deaths from cerebrovascular disease would still suggest that iatrogenic illness constitutes the third-leading cause of death in the United States; heart disease and cancer are the first- and second-leading causes of death, respectively.<ref name="starfield" />
