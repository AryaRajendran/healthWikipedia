'''The practice of selling one's kidney for profit in [[Iran]]''' is legal and regulated by the government. In any given year, it is estimated that 1400 Iranians sell one of their kidneys to a recipient who was previously unknown to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/6090468.stm|title=Iran's desperate kidney traders|last=Sarvestani|first=Nima|date=October 31, 2006|work=This World|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref> Iran currently is the only country in the world that allows the sale of one's [[Kidney transplantation|kidney]] for compensation (typically a payment); consequently, the country does not have either a waiting list or a shortage of available organs.<ref name=Economist>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8173039?story_id=8173039|title=Psst, wanna buy a kidney?|date=November 16, 2006|work=Organ transplants|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Compensated-Donations/|title=A New Outlook on Compensated Kidney Donations|last=Schall|first=John A.|date=May 2008|work=RENALIFE|publisher=American Association of Kidney Patients|accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>

==Background==
The first kidney transplantation in the Middle Eastern region was conducted in 1967 in Iran. It was not until the mid-1980s that these operations became commonplace. Iran allows kidney donations from both cadavers and compensated donors. Before the April 2000 law passed by parliament justifying<!--legalizing?--> the procurement of organs from those deemed clinically brain-dead, donor compensated transplants represented over 99 percent of cases. It is now estimated that 13 percent of donations come from cadavers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Einollahi B |title=Cadaveric kidney transplantation in Iran: behind the Middle Eastern countries? |journal=Iran J Kidney Dis |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=55–6 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=19377209 |url=http://www.ijkd.org/index.php/ijkd/article/viewFile/78/67}}</ref>

==Regulation==
The Charity Association for the Support of Kidney Patients (CASKP) and the Charity Foundation for Special Diseases (CFSD), under control of the [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education (Iran)|Ministry of Health]], regulates the trade of organs with the support of the government. The organizations match donors to recipients, arranging for tests to ensure compatibility. The amounts paid to the donor vary in Iran; however, the average figures are between $2,000 to $4,000 for a kidney donation.<ref name=Economist/> In contrast, a compatible kidney sold on the global [[black-market]] can cost in excess of {{$}}160,000 in some cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-5190413-504083.html|title=Black Market Kidneys, $160,000 a Pop|last=Martinez|first=Edecio|date=July 27, 2009|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref>

==Islamic views==
In 1996, Islamic religious scholars from the Muslim Law Council of Great Britain<!--what has a UK group to do with Iranian practice?  if there is a connection, it should be explained--> issued a [[fatwa]] allowing the practice of organ transplants.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite journal |author=Al-Khader AA |title=The Iranian transplant programme: comment from an Islamic perspective |journal=Nephrol.

==Similar Middle-eastern models==
In Saudi Arabia, transplants are performed using medicinal [[cadavers]] rather than living donors. The practice is sponsored and regulated by the government, through the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation (SCOT).  The organization is also responsible for the standards of care, public and formal education, regulations, and monitoring of all types of organ transplants. Because of the limited number of cadaver candidates, there are not enough donations to satisfy demand.<ref name=Oxford/>
