He lived in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. Some ancient writers attributed to him the two works ''De Fracturis'' and ''De Articulis'', while others contended that he wrote nothing at all.<ref>John Tzetzes, ''Chil.'' vii. ''Hist.'' 155; Poeti ''Epist. at Artax.'', in Hippocr. ''Opera'', vol. iii; ''Suda'', "Hippocrates", ι565; Galen, ''Comment. in Hippocr. De Rat. Vict. in Morb. Acut.'', i. 17, vol. xv., ''Comment. in Hippocr. ''De Fract.'', vol. xviii. pt. ii.</ref>
