'''Doxylamine''' is a first generation [[antihistamine]]. It can be used by itself as a short-term [[sedative]] and in combination with other drugs to provide night-time [[allergy]] and [[common cold|cold]] relief.  Doxylamine is also used in combination with the analgesics [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[codeine]] as an analgesic/calmative preparation, and is prescribed in combination with [[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] ([[pyridoxine]]) to prevent [[morning sickness]] in [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women. Its fetal safety is "A" in Briggs' Reference Guide to Fetal and Neonatal Risk.<ref>Briggs GG, Freeman RK, Yaffe SJ. Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation: A Reference Guide to Fetal and Neonatal Risk, 8th edition. 2008. Published by: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.</ref>

== Indications ==
Doxylamine is a member of the [[ethanolamine]] class of antihistamines and has anti-allergy power superior to almost every other antihistamine on the market, with the exception of [[diphenhydramine]] ([[Benadryl]]); it is also the most effective over-the-counter sedative available in the [[United States]]  and is more sedating than some prescription [[hypnotic]]s.<ref name ="drugbank" /> One study found that doxylamine [[succinate]] was more effective than the [[barbiturate]] [[phenobarbital]] for use as a sedative.<ref name="drugbank">http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00366</ref>

The dosage required to induce [[sleep]] can be as low as 6.25&nbsp;mg, but is usually effective in dosages of up to 25&nbsp;mg. Higher doses are not recommended by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]], although single dosage recommendations of up to 50&nbsp;mg are common in some countries, including Australia, where it is marketed under the names '''Restavit''' and '''Dozile'''.
A recent placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial found the formulation of doxylamine and pyridoxine marketed as Diclectin to be effective in controlling nausea and vomiting due to pregnancy.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Am%20J%20Obstet%20Gynecol.%202010%20AND%20diclectin</ref>

== Metabolites ==
The two main metabolites are [[desmethyldoxylamine]] and [[didesmethyldoxylamine]].

== Side effects ==
Doxylamine succinate is a potent [[anticholinergic]] and has a [[adverse drug reaction|side-effect]] profile common to such drugs, including [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]], [[ataxia]], [[urinary retention]], drowsiness, memory problems, inability to concentrate, hallucinations, psychosis, and a marked increased sensitivity to external stimuli. Like many hypnotics, it should not be combined with other antihistamines, such as Zyrtec (cetirizine) or Benadryl (diphenhydramine), as this combination can increase the risk of serious side effects. Using doxylamine over a long period of time is not recommended. However, the drug is not addictive and withdrawal effects are unlikely to be experienced with prolonged use.

== Toxicity ==
Doxylamine succinate is generally safe for administration to healthy adults.  Typical preparations that contain doxylamine range from 6.25&nbsp;mg to 50&nbsp;mg.  The {{LD50}} is estimated to be 50–1000&nbsp;mg/kg in humans.<ref>http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/d8882.htm</ref>  Symptoms of overdose may include dry mouth, dilated pupils, insomnia, night terrors, euphoria, hallucinations, seizures, blackout [[rhabdomyolysis]], and death.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Syed | first = Husnain | authorlink = | coauthors = Sumit Som, Nazia Khan, Wael Faltas | title = Doxylamine toxicity: seizure, rhabdomyolysis and false positive urine drug screen for methadone | journal = [[BMJ]] Case Reports | volume = 2003 | issue = 90 | pages = 845 | publisher = [[BMJ Group]] | date = 17 March 2009 | url = http://casereports.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/2009/mar08_1/bcr0920080879 | doi = 10.1136/bcr.09.2008.0879 | accessdate = 29 November 2009}}</ref>  Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose. These have been characterized by coma, tonic-clonic seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8&nbsp;mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000&nbsp;mg doxylamine succinate.<ref name="medsafe.govt.nz"/>  Rarely, an overdose results in [[rhabdomyolysis]] and acute [[renal failure]].<ref>{{cite journal

Studies of doxylamine's carcinogenicity in mice and rats have produced positive results for both liver and thyroid cancer, especially in the mouse.<ref>http://potency.berkeley.edu/chempages/DOXYLAMINE%20SUCCINATE.html</ref>  The carcinogenicity of the drug in humans is not well studied, and the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] lists the drug as "not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans".<ref>http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol79/79-05.html</ref>

== Formulations ==
Doxylamine is primarily used as the [[succinic acid]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], doxylamine succinate.
*It is the sedating ingredient of [[NyQuil]].
*In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, such as [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]], doxylamine is available prepared with [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[codeine]] under the brand name '''Dolased''', '''Propain Plus''', '''Syndol''', or '''Mersyndol''', as treatment for [[tension headache]] and other types of [[pain]].
*Doxylamine succinate is used in general [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] sleep-aids branded as '''Somnil''', '''Dozile''', '''Donormyl''', '''Dormidina''' (Portugal), '''Restavit''', '''Unisom-2''' and '''Sleep Aid''' (generic - Australia).
*In the [[United States]] doxylamine succinate is the active ingredient in the over-the-counter sleep-aid tablets branded as [[Unisom]]; however, the [[gelcap|gel-cap]] form contains [[diphenhydramine hydrochloride]] instead.<ref>[http://www.chattem.com/DrugFacts.asp?product=10 manufacturer's website]</ref>
*In [[Canada]] doxylamine succinate is the active ingredient in the over-the-counter sleep-aid tablets branded as [[Unisom]] 2; while [[Unisom]] contains [[diphenhydramine hydrochloride]] as the active ingredient.{{Dubious |Availability in Canada |reason=summary of problem |date=March 2013}}
*It is also available in combination with vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and [[folic acid]] under the brand name '''Evanorm''' (marketed by Ion Healthcare).
*In [[Canada]], doxylamine succinate and [[pyridoxine]] ([[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]]) are the ingredients of '''Diclectin''', which is used to prevent [[morning sickness]].
