'''The Bethesda system''' ('''TBS''') is a system for reporting [[cervix|cervical]] or vaginal [[Cytopathology|cytologic]] diagnoses,<ref name=AFP-TBS2001 /> used for reporting [[Pap smear]] results.  It was introduced in 1988,<ref name="pmid2791840">{{cite journal |author= |title=The 1988 Bethesda System for reporting cerval/vaginal cytologic diagnoses: developed and approved at the National Cancer Institute workshop in Bethesda, MD, December 12–13, 1988 |journal=Diagn.

==Types of results==
Abnormal results include:
*Atypical squamous cells
**Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)
**Atypical squamous cells – cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)
*Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL)
*High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL)
*[[Squamous cell carcinoma]]

*Atypical Glandular Cells not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS)
*Atypical Glandular Cells, suspicious for AIS or cancer (AGC-neoplastic)

*Adenocarcinoma ''in situ'' (AIS)

===Squamous cell abnormalities===
====LSIL – Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion{{anchor|LSIL}}====
[[Image:Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.jpg|thumb|right|LSIL. [[Pap stain]].]]
Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL or LGSIL) indicates possible [[Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia|cervical dysplasia]]. LSIL usually indicates mild dysplasia (CIN 1), more than likely caused by a [[human papillomavirus]] infection.  It is usually diagnosed following a [[Pap smear]].

CIN 1 is the most common and most benign form of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and usually resolves spontaneously within two years. Because of this, LSIL results can be managed with a simple "watch and wait" philosophy. However, because there is a 12–16% chance of progression to more severe dysplasia, the physician may want to follow the results more aggressively by performing a [[colposcopy]] with [[biopsy]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wright TC Jr, Massad LS, Dunton CJ, Spitzer M, Wilkinson EJ, Solomon D | year = 2007 | month = Oct | title = 2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests | url = | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 197 | issue = 4| pages = 346–55 }}</ref> If the dysplasia progresses, treatment may be necessary. Treatment involves removal of the affected tissue, which can be accomplished by [[Loop electrical excision procedure|LEEP]], [[cryosurgery]], [[cone biopsy]], or laser ablation.

====HSIL – High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion{{anchor|HSIL}}====
[[Image:High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.jpg|thumb|right|HSIL. [[Pap stain]].]]
High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL or HGSIL) indicates moderate or severe [[cervical intraepithelial neoplasia]] or [[carcinoma in situ]].  It is usually diagnosed following a [[Pap test]].  In some cases these lesions can lead to invasive [[cervical cancer]], if not followed appropriately.

HSIL does not mean that cancer is present. Of all women with HSIL results, 2%<ref>Massad LS; Collins YC; Meyer PM. ''Biopsy correlates of abnormal cervical cytology classified using the Bethesda system.'' Gynecologic Oncology. 2001 Sep;82(3):516-22.</ref> or less<ref>Melnikow J, Nuovo J, Willan AR, Chan BK, Howell LP. ''Natural history of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions: a meta-analysis.'' Obstetric Gynecology. 1998 Oct;92(4 Pt 2):727-35.</ref> have invasive cervical cancer at that time, however about 20% would progress to having invasive cervical cancer without treatment.<ref>McIndoe WA; McLean MR; Jones RW; Mullins PR. ''The invasive potential of carcinoma in situ of the cervix.'' Obstetric Gynecology. 1984 Oct;64(4):451-8.</ref> To combat this progression, HSIL is usually followed by an immediate [[colposcopy]] with [[biopsy]] to sample or remove the dysplastic tissue. This tissue is sent for [[pathology]] testing to assign a [[histology|histologic]] classification that is more definitive than a Pap smear result (which is a [[Cytopathology|cytologic]] finding). HSIL generally corresponds to the histological classification of [[Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia|CIN 2 or 3]].

HSIL treatment involves the removal or destruction of the affected cells, usually by [[Loop electrical excision procedure|LEEP]]. Other methods include [[cryosurgery|cryotherapy]], cautery, or laser ablation, but none are performed on [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women for fear of disrupting the pregnancy.<ref>Wright TC Jr; Massad LS; Dunton CJ; Spitzer M; Wilkinson EJ; Solomon D. ''2006 consensus guidelines for the management of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests.'' American Journal of Obstetric Gynecology. 2007 Oct;197(4):346-55.</ref> Any of these procedures is 85% likely to cure the problem.

===Glandular cell abnormalities===
====Adenocarcinoma====
[[Image:Adenocarcinoma on pap test 1.jpg|thumb|right|Adenocarcinoma. [[Pap stain]].]]
[[Adenocarcinoma]] can arise from the endocervix, endometrium and extrauterine sites.

====AGC{{anchor|AGC}}====

AGC, formerly AGUS, is an [[acronym]] for ''atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance''.<ref>{{EMedicineDictionary|AGUS}}</ref>  Renamed AGC to avoid confusion with ASCUS.<ref name=AFP-TBS2001 />

The management of AGC is [[colposcopy]] with or without an [[endometrium|endometrial]] [[biopsy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
