A '''Choroid plexus papilloma''' (CPP) is a rare, slow-growing, histologically benign intracranial [[neoplasm]] or [[tumor]] that is commonly located in the [[ventricular system]] of the [[choroid plexus]].<ref name="pmid10940770">{{cite journal |author=McEvoy AW, Harding BN, Phipps KP, ''et al.'' |title=Management of choroid plexus tumours in children: 20 years experience at a single neurosurgical centre |journal=Pediatr Neurosurg |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=192â€“9 |year=2000 |month=April |pmid=10940770 |doi= 10.1159/000028933|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=pne32192}}</ref> It may obstruct the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] flow, causing increased [[intracranial pressure]].

==Pathophysiology==
The tumor is neuroectodermal in origin and similar in structure to a normal [[choroid plexus]]. They may be created by [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[choroid plexus]].

==Frequency and age affected==
Internationally tumors of the choroid plexus are rare, accounting for 0.4-0.6% of all intracranial neoplasms. It most commonly affects young children under the age of 5 with a mean patient age of 5.2 years.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs of the tumor resulting from increased [[intracranial pressure]] are present in 91% of patients, with [[vomiting]], [[homonymous hemianopia|homonymous visual field defects]] and [[headache]] being the most common symptoms.

==Surgical treatment==
Choroid plexus papillomas are benign tumors that are usually cured by surgery; malignant progression has been rarely reported.
