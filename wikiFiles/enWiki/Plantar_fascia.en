The '''plantar fascia'''  is the thick [[connective tissue]] ([[fascia]]) which supports the [[Arches of the foot|arch]] on the bottom ([[Anatomical terms of location#Relative directions in the limbs|plantar]] side) of the [[foot]].  It runs from the [[tuberosity]] of the [[calcaneus]] (heel bone) forward to the heads of the [[metatarsus|metatarsal bones]] (the bone between each [[toe]] and the bones of the mid foot). The often painful condition [[plantar fasciitis]] is an inflammatory condition of the plantar fascia.

==Anatomy of the plantar fascia==
[[Image:PF-PlantarDesign.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Anatomical diagrams illustrating the components of the plantar fascia.]]

The plantar fascia is a broad structure that spans between the medial calcaneal tubercle and the proximal [[phalanx bones|phalanges]] of the toes. There is still some debate as to whether it is deep [[fascia]] or an [[aponeurosis]]. The Dorland’s Medical Dictionary defines an aponeurosis as: (i) a white, flattened or ribbon-like tendinous expansion, serving mainly to connect a muscle with the parts that it moves, (ii) a term formerly applied to certain fasciae. Further, it defines the plantar aponeurosis as bands of [[fibrous connective tissue]] radiating toward the bases of the toes from the medial process of the tuber calcanei (posterior half of the calcaneus).

The plantar fascia is made up of predominantly longitudinally oriented [[collagen]] fibers. There are three distinct structural components: the '''medial component''', the '''central component''' ('''plantar aponeurosis'''), and the '''lateral component''' (see diagram at right). The central component is the largest and most prominent.

In younger people the plantar fascia is also intimately related to the [[Achilles tendon]], with a continuous fascial connection between the two from the distal aspect of the Achilles to the origin of the plantar fascia at the calcaneal tubercle. However, the continuity of this connection decreases with age to a point that in the elderly there are few, if any, connecting fibers. There are also distinct attachments of the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon to the calcaneus so the two do not directly contact each other. Nevertheless, there is an indirect relationship whereby if the toes are [[dorsiflexion|dorsiflexed]], the plantar fascia tightens via the [[windlass]] mechanism. If a tensile force is then generated in the Achilles tendon it will increase tensile strain in the plantar fascia. Clinically, this relationship has been used as a basis for treatment for plantar fasciitis, with stretches and night stretch splinting being applied to the [[gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]]/[[soleus muscle]] unit.

==Biomechanics of the plantar fascia==
[[Image:PF-PlantarMove.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The effect of dorsiflexing the toes on arch height (A).The windlass mechanism (B).]]

The plantar fascia contributes to support of  arch of the foot by acting as a tie-rod, where it undergoes tension when the foot bears weight. One [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] model estimated it carries as much as 14% of the total load of the foot. In an experiment using [[cadaver]]s, it was found that failure of the plantar fascia averaged at loads of 1189&nbsp;±&nbsp;244 [[newton (unit)|newton]]s<ref>{{Cite journal | author = H. B. Kitaoka, Z. P. Luo, E. S. Growney, L. J. Berglund and K. N. An | title = Material properties of the plantar aponeurosis | journal = Foot & ankle international | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 557–560 | year = 1994 | month = October | pmid = 7834064}}</ref> (121&nbsp;±&nbsp;24 [[kilogram-force|kgf]] or 267&nbsp;±&nbsp;55 [[Foot-pound (energy)|ft-lb]]). Interestingly, failure most often occurred at the proximal attachment to the calcaneus, which is consistent with the usual location of [[symptom]]s (i.e. in plantar fasciitis). Complete [[rupture of membranes|rupture]] or surgical release of the plantar fascia leads to a decrease in arch stiffness and a significant collapse of the [[longitudinal arch of the foot]]. By modeling it was predicted such conditions would result in a 17% increase in vertical displacement and a 15% increase in horizontal elongation of the foot when it was loaded at {{convert|683|N|lbf}}.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = G. A. Arangio, C. Chen and W. Kim | title = Effect of cutting the plantar fascia on mechanical properties of the foot | journal = Clinical orthopaedics and related research | issue = 339 | pages = 227–231 | year = 1997 | month = June | pmid = 9186224}}</ref> Surgical release also significantly increases both stress in the plantar [[ligament]]s and plantar pressures under the metatarsal heads. Although most of the figures mentioned above are from either [[cadaver]] studies or investigations using models, they highlight the relatively large load the plantar fascia is subjected to while contributing to the structural integrity of the foot.

The plantar fascia also has an important role in dynamic function during [[gait (human)|gait]]. It was found the plantar fascia continuously elongated during the contact phase of gait. It went through rapid elongation before and immediately after mid-stance, reaching a maximum of 9% to 12% elongation between mid-stance and toe-off.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Amit Gefen | title = The in vivo elastic properties of the plantar fascia during the contact phase of walking | journal = Foot & ankle international | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 238–244 | year = 2003 | month = March | pmid = 12793487}}</ref> During this phase the plantar fascia behaves like a spring, which may assist in conserving energy. In addition, the plantar fascia has a critical role in normal mechanical function of the foot, contributing to the "windlass mechanism". When the toes are dorsiflexed in the propulsive phase of gait, the plantar fascia becomes tense, resulting in elevation of the longitudinal arch and shortening of the foot (see 3A). One can liken this mechanism to a cable being wound around the drum of a windlass (see 3B); the plantar fascia being the cable, the metatarsal head the drum, and the handle, the [[proximal phalanges|proximal phalanx]]. Therefore, the plantar fascia has a number of roles, the most important of these including supporting the arch of the foot and contributing to the windlass mechanism.

==Abnormal conditions==
* [[Plantar fasciitis]] is an often painful inflammatory process of the plantar fascia.
** [[Calcaneal spur]] (heel spur) is a small calcified bone extension ([[osteophyte]]) located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus or on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. The condition is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period of time. It may also be related to [[ankylosing spondylitis]], typically in children.
* [[Plantar fibromatosis]] is a relatively uncommon non-malignant thickening of the plantar fascia.
* [[Psoriatic arthritis]] is a type of inflammatory arthritis that may affect the plantar fascia.
