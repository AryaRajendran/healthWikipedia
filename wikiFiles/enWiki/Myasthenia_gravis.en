'''Myasthenia gravis'''  (from [[Greek language|Greek]] μύς "muscle", {{lang|grc|ἀσθένεια}} "weakness", and {{lang-la|gravis}} "serious"; abbreviated '''MG''') is an autoimmune [[neuromuscular disease]] leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigability]]. It is an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune disorder]], in which weakness is caused by circulating [[antibody|antibodies]] that block [[acetylcholine receptor]]s at the postsynaptic [[neuromuscular junction]],<ref name=Conti-Fine>{{cite journal |author=Conti-Fine BM, Milani M, Kaminski HJ |title=Myasthenia gravis: past, present, and future |journal=J.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Myasthenia.jpg|thumb|[[Blepharoptosis]] of the left eye]]

The hallmark of myasthenia gravis is [[fatigability]]. Muscles become progressively weaker during periods of activity and improve after periods of rest. Muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expressions, [[chewing]], [[Manner of articulation|talking]], and [[swallowing]] are especially susceptible. The muscles that control [[breath]]ing and neck and limb movements can also be affected. Often, the physical examination yields results within normal limits.<ref name="Scherer">{{cite journal | author=Scherer K, Bedlack RS, Simel DL. | title=Does this patient have myasthenia gravis? | journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] | year=2005 | volume=293 | issue=15 | pages=1906–14 | pmid=15840866 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.15.1906}}</ref>

The onset of the disorder can be sudden. Often symptoms are intermittent. The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis may be delayed if the symptoms are subtle or variable.

In most cases, the first noticeable symptom is weakness of the [[eye muscles]]. In others, difficulty in swallowing and slurred speech may be the first signs. The degree of muscle weakness involved in MG varies greatly among patients, ranging from a localized form that is limited to eye muscles ([[ocular myasthenia]]), to a severe and generalized form in which many muscles - sometimes including those that control breathing - are affected. Symptoms, which vary in type and severity, may include asymmetrical [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] (a drooping of one or both [[eyelid]]s), [[diplopia]] (double vision) due to weakness of the muscles that control eye movements, an unstable or waddling gait, weakness in arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck, a change in facial expression, [[dysphagia]] (difficulty in swallowing), shortness of breath and [[dysarthria]] (impaired speech, often nasal due to weakness of the velar muscles).

In ''myasthenic crisis'' a [[paralysis]] of the respiratory muscles occurs, necessitating [[assisted ventilation]] to sustain life. In patients whose respiratory muscles are already weak, crises may be triggered by infection, fever, an adverse reaction to medication, or emotional stress.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bedlack RS, Sanders DB. | title=How to handle myasthenic crisis. Essential steps in patient care | journal=Postgrad Med | year=2000 | volume=107 | issue=4 | pages=211–4, 220–2 | url=http://www.postgradmed.com/issues/2000/04_00/bedlack.htm | pmid=10778421 | doi=10.3810/pgm.2000.04.1003}} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> Since the [[cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] is only regulated by the [[autonomic nervous system]], it is generally unaffected by MG.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Synapse diag4.png|thumb|A neuromuscular junction: 1. [[Axon]] 2. Muscle cell membrane ([[sarcolemma]]) 3. [[Synaptic vesicle]] 4. [[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] 5. [[Mitochondrion]]]]
[[Image:Gray1178.png|thumb|A juvenile thymus shrinks with age.]]
[[Image:Nicotinic Acetylcholine receptor.png|thumb|The [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]]] 
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune [[channelopathy]]: it features antibodies directed against proteins that are naturally present in the body. While various similar diseases have been linked to immunologic cross-reaction with an infective agent, there is no known causative [[pathogen]] that could account for myasthenia. There is a slight genetic predisposition: particular [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] types seem to predispose for MG (B8 and DR3 with DR1 more specific for ocular myasthenia). Up to 75% of patients have an abnormality of the [[thymus]]; 10% have a [[thymoma]], a tumor (either benign or malignant) of the thymus, and other abnormalities are frequently found. The disease process generally remains stationary after thymectomy (removal of the thymus).

In MG, the autoantibodies most commonly act against the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] (nAChR),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Patrick |first=J. |last2=Lindstrom |first2=J. |title=Autoimmune response to acetylcholine receptor |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=1973 |volume=180 |issue=4088 |pages=871–872 |doi=10.1126/science.180.4088.871 }}</ref> the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] in the [[motor end plate]] for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]] that stimulates muscular contractions. Some forms of the antibody impair the ability of acetylcholine to bind to receptors. Others lead to the destruction of receptors, either by [[complement system|complement]] fixation or by inducing the muscle cell to eliminate the receptors through [[endocytosis]].

The antibodies are produced by plasma cells, derived from B-cells. B-cells convert into plasma cells by T-helper cell stimulation. To carry out this activation, T-helpers must first be activated themselves, which is done by binding of the [[T-cell receptor]] (TCR) to the acetylcholine receptor antigenic peptide fragment ([[epitope]]) resting within the [[major histocompatibility complex]] of [[antigen presenting cells]]. Since the thymus plays an important role in the development of T-cells and the selection of TCR, myasthenia gravis is closely associated with [[thymoma]]. The exact mechanisms are, however, not convincingly clarified, although resection of the thymus (thymectomy) in MG patients without a thymus neoplasm often have positive results.

In normal [[muscle contraction]], cumulative activation of the nAChR leads to influx of [[sodium]] ions, which in turn causes the depolarization of muscle cell and subsequent opening of voltage-gated sodium channels. This ion influx then travels down the cell membranes via T-tubules and, via calcium channel complexes, leads to the release of calcium from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]]. Only when the levels of calcium inside the muscle cell are high enough will it contract. Decreased numbers of functioning nAChRs therefore impairs muscular contraction by limiting depolarization. In fact, MG causes the motor neuron action potential to muscular twitch ratio to vary from the nonpathological one to one ratio.

A second category of gravis is due to autoantibodies against the [[MuSK protein]] (muscle specific kinase), a [[tyrosine kinase]] receptor which is required for the formation of the [[neuromuscular junction]]. Antibodies against MuSK inhibit the signaling of MuSK normally induced by its nerve-derived ligand, [[agrin]]. The result is a decrease in patency of the neuromuscular junction, and the consequent symptoms of MG.

People treated with penicillamine can develop MG symptoms. Their antibody titer is usually similar to that of MG, but both the symptoms and the titer disappear when drug administration is discontinued.

MG is more common in families with other autoimmune diseases. A familial predisposition found in 5% of the cases is associated with certain genetic variations, such as an increased frequency of HLA-B8 and DR3. People with MG suffer from coexisting autoimmune diseases at a higher frequency than members of the general population. Of particular mention is coexisting [[thyroid disease]], where episodes of [[hypothyroidism]] may precipitate a severe exacerbation.

The acetylcholine receptor is clustered and anchored by the Rapsyn protein, research into which might eventually lead to new treatment options.<ref name="Losen"/>

===Associated condition===
Myasthenia gravis is associated with various [[autoimmune]] diseases,<ref>{{cite journal |first=S. |last=Thorlacius |last2=''et al.'' |title=Associated disorders in myasthenia gravis: autoimmune diseases and their relation to thymectomy |journal=Acta Neurologica Scandinavica |volume=80 |issue=4 |year=1989 |pages=290–295 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.1989.tb03881.x |first2=J. A. |last3=Riise |first3=T. |last4=Matre |first4=R. |last5=Johnsen |first5=H. J. |pmid=2816285 }}</ref> including:
* [[Thyroid]] diseases, including [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] and [[Graves' disease]]
* [[Diabetes mellitus type 1]]
* [[Rheumatoid arthritis]]
* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|Lupus]], and
* [[Demyelinating disease|Demyelinating CNS diseases]]

Seropositive and "double-seronegative" patients often have [[thymoma]] or thymic hyperplasia. However, anti-MuSK positive patients do not have evidence of thymus pathology.

===In pregnancy===
In the long term, [[pregnancy]] does not affect myasthenia gravis. The mothers themselves suffer from exacerbated myasthenia in a third of cases, and in those for whom it does worsen, it usually occurs in the [[first trimester]] of pregnancy. Signs and symptoms in pregnant mothers tend to improve during the [[second trimester|second]] and [[third trimester]]s. Complete [[remission (medicine)|remission]] can occur in some mothers.<ref name="tellez">{{cite journal | author = Téllez-Zenteno JF, Hernández-Ronquillo L, Salinas V, Estanol B, da Silva O | title = Myasthenia gravis and pregnancy: clinical implications and neonatal outcome | journal = BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders | volume = 5| page = 42 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15546494 | pmc = 534111 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2474-5-42 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/5/42| accessdate =10 July 2008}}</ref> [[Immunosuppressive therapy]] should be maintained throughout pregnancy, as this reduces the chance of neonatal muscle weakness, as well as controls the mother's myasthenia.<ref name="OTM3"/>

Up to 10% of infants with parents affected by the condition are born with transient (periodic) [[neonatal]] myasthenia (TNM), which generally produces feeding and [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] difficulties.<ref name="OTM3">{{cite book |title=Oxford Textbook of Medicine — Fourth Edition — Volume 3 |last=Warrell |first=David A |coauthors=Timothy M Cox, ''et al.'' |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=0-19-852787-X| page=1170}}</ref> TNM usually presents as poor [[suckling]] and generalized [[hypotonia]] (low muscle tone). Other reported symptoms include a weak cry, facial [[diplegia]] (paralysis of one part of the body) or [[paresis]] (impaired or lack of movement) and mild respiratory distress. A child with TNM typically responds very well to [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]s. Very rarely, an infant can be born with [[arthrogryposis multiplex congenita]], secondary to profound intrauterine weakness. This is due to maternal [[Antibody|antibodies]] that target an infant's [[acetylcholine]] receptors. In some cases, the mother remains [[asymptomatic]].<ref name="OTM3"/>

==Diagnosis==
MG can be a difficult diagnosis, as the symptoms can be subtle and hard to distinguish from both normal variants and other neurological disorders.<ref name="Scherer">{{cite journal | author=Scherer K, Bedlack RS, Simel DL. | title=Does this patient have myasthenia gravis? | journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]] | year=2005 | volume=293 | pages=1906–14 | pmid=15840866 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.15.1906 | issue=15}}</ref> A thorough [[physical examination]] can reveal easy fatigability, with the weakness improving after rest and worsening again on repeat of the exertion testing. A good response to medication can also be considered a sign of autoimmune pathology.

===Physical examination===
Muscle fatigability can be tested for many muscles.<ref name="Baets">{{cite book |title=Myasthenia gravis |last=Baets |first=M.H. |coauthors=H.J.G.H. Oosterhuis |year=1993 |publisher=DRD Press |isbn=3-8055-4736-6| page=158}}</ref> A thorough investigation includes:
* looking upward and sidewards for 30 seconds: [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]] and [[diplopia]]
* looking at the feet while lying on the back for 60 seconds
* keeping the arms stretched forward for 60 seconds
* ten deep knee bends
* walking 30 steps on both the toes and the heels
* five situps, lying down and sitting up completely
* "Peek sign": after complete initial apposition of the lid margins, they quickly (within 30 seconds) start to separate and the sclera starts to show<ref name="Scherer"/>

===Blood tests===
If the diagnosis is suspected, [[serology]] can be performed in a [[blood test]] to identify certain [[antibody|antibodies]]:

* One test is for antibodies against the [[acetylcholine receptor]].<ref name="Scherer"/> The test has a reasonable [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 80–96%, but in MG limited to the eye muscles (ocular myasthenia) the sensitivity falls to 50% (negative in up to 50% who have MG).

* A proportion of the patients without antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor have antibodies against the [[MuSK protein]].<ref name="pmid18515870">{{cite journal |author=Leite MI, Jacob S, Viegas S, ''et al.'' |title=IgG1 antibodies to acetylcholine receptors in 'seronegative' myasthenia gravis |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=1940–52 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18515870 |pmc=2442426 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn092 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18515870}}</ref>

* In specific situations (decreased reflexes which increase on facilitation, coexisting autonomic features, suspected presence of neoplasm, especially of the lung, presence of increment or facilitation on repetitive EMG testing) testing is performed for [[Lambert-Eaton syndrome]], in which other antibodies (against a voltage-gated [[calcium channel]]) can be found.

===Electrodiagnostics===
Muscle fibers of patients with MG are easily fatigued, and thus do not respond as well as muscles in healthy individuals to repeated stimulation. By stimulating a nerve-muscle motor unit with short sequences of rapid, regular electrical impulses, before and after exercising the motor unit, the fatiguability of the muscle can be measured. This is called the repetitive nerve stimulation test. In single fiber [[electromyography]] (SFEMG), which is considered to be the most sensitive (although not the most specific) test for MG,<ref name="Scherer"/> a thin needle electrode is inserted into different areas of a particular muscle to record the action potentials from several samplings of different individual muscle fibers. Two muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit are identified and the temporal variability in their firing patterns are measured. Frequency and proportion of particular abnormal action potential patterns, "jitter" and "blocking," are diagnostic. Jitter refers to the abnormal variation in the time interval between action potentials of adjacent muscle fibers in the same motor unit. Blocking refers to the failure of nerve impulses to elicit action potentials in adjacent muscle fibers of the same motor unit.<ref name="Selvan">{{cite journal | author=Selvan VA. | title=Single-fiber EMG: A review | journal=[[Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology|Ann Indian Acad Neurol.]] | year=2011 | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=64–67 | pmid=21654930 | doi=10.4103/0972-2327.78058 | pmc=3108086}}</ref>

===Ice test===
Applying [[ice]] to weak muscle groups characteristically leads to improvement in strength of those muscles. Applying ice for 5 minutes to the muscles reportedly has a sensitivity and specificity of 76.9% and 98.3%, respectively, for the identification of MG. It is thought that acetylcholinesterase is inhibited at the lower temperature and that this is the basis for this diagnostic test.<ref>http://shortreports.rsmjournals.com/content/1/1/14.full</ref>

===Edrophonium test===
[[Image:Myasthenia gravis ptosis reversal.jpg|thumb|Photograph of a patient showing right partial ptosis (left picture), the left lid shows compensatory pseudo lid retraction because of equal innervation of the levator palpabrae superioris ([[Hering's law of equal innervation]]). Right picture: after an edrophonium test, note the improvement in ptosis.]]

The "edrophonium test" is infrequently performed to identify MG; its application is limited to those situations in which other investigations have failed to yield a conclusive diagnosis. This test requires the [[intravenous]] administration of [[edrophonium|edrophonium chloride]] (Tensilon, Reversol) or neostigmine (Prostigmin), drugs that block the breakdown of acetylcholine by [[cholinesterase]] ([[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]s) and temporarily increases the levels of acetylcholine at the [[neuromuscular junction]]. In people with myasthenia gravis involving the eye muscles, edrophonium chloride will briefly relieve weakness.<ref name="Seybold">{{cite journal | author=Seybold ME | title=The office Tensilon test for ocular myasthenia gravis | journal=[[Arch Neurol]] | year=1986 | volume=43 | pages=842–3 | pmid=3729766 | issue=8 | doi=10.1001/archneur.1986.00520080080028}}</ref>

===Imaging===
[[Image:Tumor Thymoma1.JPG|thumb|A chest CT-scan showing a thymoma (red circle)]] A [[chest X-ray]] is frequently performed; it may point towards alternative diagnoses (e.g. [[Lambert-Eaton syndrome]] due to a lung tumor) and comorbidity. It may also identify widening of the [[mediastinum]] suggestive of [[thymoma]], but [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) are more sensitive ways to identify thymomas, and are generally done for this reason.<ref name="Kraker">{{cite journal | author=de Kraker M, Kluin J, Renken N, Maat AP, Bogers AJ | title=CT and myasthenia gravis: correlation between mediastinal imaging and histopathological findings | journal=Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg | year=2005 | volume=4 | pages=267–71 | pmid=17670406 | doi=10.1510/icvts.2004.097246 | issue=3}}</ref> MRI of the cranium and orbits may also be performed to exclude compressive and inflammatory lesions of the cranial nerves and ocular muscles.<ref>Allan H. Ropper, Robert H. Brown ''Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology'' McGraw-Hill Professional; 8 edition (29 March 2005)</ref>

===Pulmonary function test===
[[Spirometry]] (lung function testing) may be performed to assess respiratory function if there are concerns about  breathing adequacy. The forced [[vital capacity]] may be monitored at intervals to detect increasing muscular weakness.  Acutely, [[negative inspiratory force]]  may be used to determine adequacy of ventilation. Severe myasthenia may cause [[respiratory failure]] due to exhaustion of the respiratory muscles.<ref name="Thieben">{{cite journal | author=Thieben MJ, Blacker DJ, Liu PY, Harper CM Jr, Wijdicks EF | title=Pulmonary function tests and blood gases in worsening myasthenia gravis | journal=Muscle Nerve | year=2005 | volume=32 | pages=664–667 | pmid=16025526 | doi=10.1002/mus.20403 | issue=5 }}</ref>

===Pathological findings===
Muscle biopsy is only performed if the diagnosis remains in doubt and clinical suspicion of MG persists. [[Immunofluorescence]] shows [[IgG]] antibodies on the neuromuscular junction. (The antibody which causes myasthenia gravis does not fluoresce, but rather a [[secondary antibody]] directed against it.) Muscle electron microscopy shows receptor infolding and loss of the tips of the folds, together with widening of the [[Chemical synapse|synaptic]] clefts. Both these techniques are currently used for research rather than diagnostically.<ref name="Losen">{{cite journal | author=Losen M, Stassen MH, Martínez-Martínez P, et al. | title=Increased expression of rapsyn in muscles prevents acetylcholine receptor loss in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis | journal=Brain | year=2005 | volume=128 | pages=2327–37 | pmid=16150851 | doi=10.1093/brain/awh612 | issue=Pt 10 }}</ref>

==Management==
Treatment is by medication and/or surgery. Medication consists mainly of [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]s to directly improve muscle function and [[immunosuppressant drug]]s to reduce the autoimmune process. [[Thymectomy]] is a surgical method to treat MG. For emergency treatment, [[plasmapheresis]] or [[IVIG]] can be used as a temporary measure to remove antibodies from the blood circulation.

===Medication===

[[Image:Neostigmine.svg|thumb|Neostigmine, chemical structure.]]
* [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]s: [[neostigmine]] and [[pyridostigmine]] can improve muscle function by slowing the natural enzyme [[cholinesterase]] that degrades [[acetylcholine]] in the motor end plate; the neurotransmitter is therefore around longer to stimulate its receptor. Usually, doctors will start with a low dose, e.g. 3x20mg pyridostigmine, and increase until the desired result is achieved. If taken 30 minutes before a meal, symptoms will be mild during eating. Side effects, such as perspiration and diarrhea, can be countered by adding [[atropine]]. Pyridostigmine is a short-lived drug, with a half-life of about four hours.

[[Image:Azathioprine.svg|thumb|Azathioprine, chemical structure]]
* [[Immunosuppressive drugs]]: [[prednisone]], [[cyclosporine]], [[mycophenolate mofetil]] and [[azathioprine]] may be used. Patients are commonly treated with a combination of these drugs with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Treatments with some immunosuppressives take weeks to months before effects are noticed. Other immunomodulating substances, such as drugs that prevent acetylcholine receptor modulation by the immune system, are currently being researched.<ref name=Losen2008>{{cite journal |author=Losen M, Martínez-Martínez P, Phernambucq M, Schuurman J, Parren PW, DE Baets MH |title=Treatment of myasthenia gravis by preventing acetylcholine receptor modulation |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume=1132 |pages=174–9|year=2008 |pmid=18567867 |doi=10.1196/annals.1405.034}}</ref>

===Plasmapheresis and IVIG===
If the myasthenia is serious (myasthenic crisis), [[plasmapheresis]] can be used to remove the putative antibodies from the circulation. Also, [[intravenous immunoglobulin]]s (IVIGs) can be used to bind the circulating antibodies. Both of these treatments have relatively short-lived benefits, typically measured in weeks.<ref name=Juel2004>{{cite journal |author=Juel VC. |title=Myasthenia gravis: management of myasthenic crisis and perioperative care |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=75–81 |year=2004|pmid=15229794 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-829595}}</ref>

===Surgery===
{{Main|thymectomy}}

Thymectomy, the surgical removal of the [[thymus]], is essential in cases of [[thymoma]] in view of the potential neoplastic effects of the tumor. However, the procedure is more controversial in patients who do not show thymic abnormalities. Although some of these patients improve following thymectomy, some patients experience severe exacerbations and the highly controversial concept of "therapeutic thymectomy" for patients with thymus hyperplasia is disputed by many experts, and efforts are underway to unequivocally answer this important question.

There are a number of surgical approaches to the removal of the thymus gland: transsternal (through the [[Human sternum|sternum]], or breast bone), transcervical (through a small neck incision), and transthoracic (through one or both sides of the chest). The transsternal approach is most common and uses the same length-wise incision through the sternum (breast bone) used for most open-heart surgery. The transcervical approach, a less invasive procedure, allows for removal of the entire thymus gland through a small neck incision. There has been no difference in success in symptom improvement between the transsternal approach and the minimally invasive transcervical approach.<ref name=Calhoun_1999>{{cite journal |author=Calhoun R, et al. |title=Results of Transcervical Thymectomy for Myasthenia Gravis in 100 Consecutive Patients |journal=Annals of Surgery |volume=230 |issue=4 |pages=555–561 |year=1999 |pmid=10522725 |doi=10.1097/00000658-199910000-00011 |pmc=1420904 |last2=Ritter |first2=Jon H. |last3=Guthrie |first3=Tracey J. |last4=Pestronk |first4=Alan |last5=Meyers |first5=Bryan F. |last6=Patterson |first6=G. Alexander |last7=Pohl |first7=Mary S. |last8=Cooper |first8=Joel D.}}</ref> For patients with a thymoma, though, complete tissue removal is important, as thymic tissue can regrow. Thymomas can be malignant and are thought to be the onset of other diseases, as well, so many surgeons will only recommend the full sternotomy approach to a thymectomy.

Thymoma is relatively rare in younger (<40) patients, but especially younger patients with generalized MG without thymoma benefit, paradoxically, from thymectomy. Resection is also indicated for those with a thymoma, but it is less likely to improve the MG symptoms.

===Physical activity===
Patients with MG should be educated regarding the fluctuating nature of their symptoms, including weakness and exercise-induced fatigue. Exercise participation should be encouraged with frequent bouts of rest.<ref name=Goldenberg>{{cite web|last=Goldenberg, W.D. and Shah, A.K.|title=Myasthenia Gravis|url=http://emedicine.com/neuro/topic232.htm|publisher=eMedicine|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref>

===Inspiratory muscle therapy===
In patients with generalized MG, there is some evidence that a partial home program including training in [[diaphragmatic breathing]], [[pursed lip breathing]], and interval based IMT may improve respiratory muscle strength, chest wall mobility, respiratory pattern, and respiratory endurance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cup E.H., Pieterse A.J., ten Broek-Pastoor J.M., Munneke M., van Engelen B.G., Hendricks H.T., van der Wilt G.J., Oostendorp R.A.|title=Exercise therapy and other types of physical therapy for patients with neuromuscular diseases: a systematic review|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|year=2007|volume=88|pages=1452–64|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.07.024|pmid=17964887|first1=EH|last2=Pieterse|first2=AJ|last3=Ten Broek-Pastoor|first3=JM|last4=Munneke|first4=M|last5=Van Engelen|first5=BG|last6=Hendricks|first6=HT|last7=Van Der Wilt|first7=GJ|last8=Oostendorp|first8=RA|issue=11}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
With treatment, patients have a normal life expectancy, except for those with a malignant [[thymoma]] (whose lesser life expectancy is on account of the thymoma itself and is otherwise unrelated to the myasthenia). Quality of life can vary depending on the severity and the cause. The drugs used to control MG either diminish in effectiveness over time (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) or cause severe side effects of their own (immunosuppressants). About 10% of MG patients are found to have tumors in their thymus glands, in which case a thymectomy is a very effective treatment with long-term remission. However, most patients need treatment for the remainder of their lives, and their abilities vary greatly. MG is not usually a progressive disease; the symptoms may fluctuate, but do not always get worse as the patient ages. For some, the symptoms decrease after a span of three to five years.

==Epidemiology==
Myasthenia gravis occurs in all ethnic groups and both sexes. It most commonly affects women under 40 and people from 50 to 70 years old of either sex, but it has been known to occur at any age. Younger patients rarely have thymoma. The prevalence in the [[United States]] is estimated at 20 cases per 100,000.<ref name="MGFA">{{cite web | title=What is Myasthenia Gravis (MG)? | url=http://www.myasthenia.org/amg_whatismg.cfm | publisher=Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America}}</ref>  Risk factors are the female sex with ages 20 – 40, familial myasthenia gravis, [[D-penicillamine]] ingestion (drug-induced myasthenia), and having other autoimmune diseases.

Three types of myasthenic symptoms in children can be distinguished:<ref name="Baets"/>
# Neonatal: In 12% of the pregnancies with a mother with MG, she passes the antibodies to the infant through the [[placenta]], causing neonatal myasthenia gravis. The symptoms will start in the first two days and disappear within a few weeks after birth. With the mother, it is not uncommon for the symptoms to even improve during pregnancy, but they might worsen after labor.
# Congenital: Children of a healthy mother can, very rarely, develop myasthenic symptoms beginning at birth, [[congenital myasthenic syndrome]] or CMS. Other than myasthenia gravis, CMS is not caused by an autoimmune process, but due to synaptic malformation, which in turn is caused by genetic [[mutations]]. Thus, CMS is a [[hereditary disease]]. More than 11 different mutations have been identified, and the inheritance pattern is typically [[recessive gene|autosomal recessive]].
# Juvenile myasthenia gravis: myasthenia occurring in childhood, but after the peripartum period

The congenital myasthenias cause muscle weakness and fatigability similar to those of MG. The symptoms of CMS usually begin within the first two years of life, although in a few forms, patients can develop their first symptoms as late as the seventh decade of life. A diagnosis of CMS is suggested by the following:
* Onset of symptoms in infancy or childhood
* Weakness which increases as muscles tire
* A decremental EMG response, on low frequency, of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP)
* No anti-AChR or MuSK antibodies
* No response to immunosuppressant therapy
* Family history of symptoms which resemble CMS

The symptoms of CMS can vary from mild to severe. It is also common for patients with the same form, even members of the same family, to be affected to differing degrees. In most forms of CMS, weakness does not progress, and in some forms, the symptoms may diminish as the patient gets older. Only rarely do symptoms of CMS become worse with time.
