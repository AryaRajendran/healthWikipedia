A '''DNA repair-deficiency disorder''' is a medical condition due to reduced functionality of [[DNA repair]].

DNA repair defects can cause both an '''accelerated aging disease''' and an '''increased risk of cancer'''.  Accelerated aging is discussed first, and increased risk of cancer is discussed next.

==DNA repair defects and accelerated aging==

DNA repair defects are seen in nearly all of the diseases described as  '''accelerated aging disease''', in which various [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s or systems of the human body [[Senescence|age]] prematurely. Because the '''accelerated aging diseases''' display different aspects of aging, but never every aspect, they are often called '''segmental progerias''' by [[Gerontology#Biogerontology|biogerontologists]].

===DNA repair defects distinguished from "accelerated aging"===
Most of the DNA repair deficiency diseases show varying degrees of "accelerated aging" or cancer (often some of both).<ref name="nDNA">{{cite journal | author=Best,BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging | journal=Rejuvenation Research  | volume=12 | issue=3 | year=2009 | pages=199–208 | url=http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/Nuclear_DNA_in_Aging.pdf | doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 | pmid=19594328 }}</ref> But elimination of any [[gene]] essential for  [[base excision repair]] kills the [[embryo]]—it is too lethal to display symptoms (much less symptoms of cancer or "accelerated aging").<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hasty P, Campisi J, Hoeijmakers J, van Steeg H, Vijg J |title=Aging and genome maintenance: lessons from the mouse? |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5611 |pages=1355–9 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12610296 |doi=10.1126/science.1079161 |url=}}</ref> 
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum display symptoms dominated by vulnerability to cancer, whereas progeria and Werner syndrome show the most features of "accelerated aging". [[Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]] (HNPCC) is very often caused by a defective [[MSH2]] gene leading to defective [[DNA mismatch repair|mismatch repair]], but displays no symptoms of "accelerated aging".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mazurek A, Berardini M, Fishel R |title=Activation of human MutS homologs by 8-oxo-guanine DNA damage |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=277 |issue=10 |pages=8260–6 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11756455 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M111269200  |url= http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/277/10/8260 }}</ref> On the other hand, Cockayne Syndrome and trichothiodystrophy show mainly features of accelerated aging, but apparently without an increased risk of cancer<ref>Hoeijmakers JH. DNA damage, aging, and cancer. N Engl J Med. 2009 Oct 8;361(15):1475-85.</ref> Some DNA repair defects manifest as [[neurodegeneration]] rather than as cancer or "accelerated aging".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rass U, Ahel I, West SC |title=Defective DNA repair and neurodegenerative disease |journal=Cell |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=991–1004 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17889645 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.08.043 |url=}}</ref>  (Also see the "[[DNA damage theory of aging]]" for a discussion of the evidence that DNA damage is the primary underlying cause of aging.)

===Debate concerning "accelerated aging"===
Some biogerontologists question that such a thing as "accelerated aging" actually exists, at least partly on the grounds that all of the so-called accelerated aging diseases are segmental progerias. Many disease conditions such as [[diabetes]], [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], etc., are associated with increased [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. Without reliable [[biomarkers of aging]] it is hard to support the claim that a disease condition represents more than accelerated mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller RA |title='Accelerated aging': a primrose path to insight? |journal=Aging Cell |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=47–51 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15038817 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9728.2004.00081.x |url=}}</ref> 

Against this position other biogerontologists argue that premature aging [[phenotype]]s are identifiable symptoms associated with mechanisms of molecular damage.<ref name="nDNA"/> The fact that these phenotypes are widely recognized justifies classification of the relevant diseases as "accelerated aging".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hasty P, Vijg J |title=Accelerating aging by mouse reverse genetics: a rational approach to understanding longevity |journal=Aging Cell |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=55–65 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15038819 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9728.2004.00082.x |url=}}</ref> Such conditions, it is argued, are readily distinguishable from [[Genetic disorder|genetic disease]]s associated with increased mortality, but not associated with an aging phenotype, such as [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]]. It is further argued that segmental aging phenotype is a natural part of aging insofar as genetic variation leads to some people being more disposed than others to [[aging-associated diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hasty P, Vijg J |title=Rebuttal to Miller: 'Accelerated aging': a primrose path to insight?' |journal=Aging Cell |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=67–9 |year=2004 |month=April |pmid=15038820 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-9728.2004.00087.x |url=}}</ref>

==DNA repair defects and increased cancer risk==

Individuals with an inherited impairment in [[DNA repair]] capability are often at increased risk of [[cancer]].<ref>Bernstein C, Bernstein H, Payne CM, Garewal H. DNA repair/pro-apoptotic dual-role proteins in five major DNA repair pathways: fail-safe protection against carcinogenesis. Mutat Res. 2002 Jun;511(2):145-78. Review.</ref>  If there is a [[mutation]] in a DNA repair gene, the repair gene will either not be expressed or expressed in a mutated form.  Consequently the repair function will be deficient or altered, and damages will accumulate.  Such DNA damages, if not repaired, cause errors during [[DNA synthesis]] leading to mutations that can give rise to cancer.  The abbreviated names of the most well studied DNA repair genes (for which a mutation results in an increased risk of cancer) are followed by an abbreviated name of the repair pathway affected, and by the tissue in which cancer develops when the gene is mutated.  Below the list is shown the full name of each gene and the affected pathway(s).
