'''Chemical imbalance''' is one hypothesis about the cause of [[mental illness]]. Other causes that are debated include psychological and social causes.

The basic concept is that [[neurotransmitter]] imbalances within the [[brain]] are the main causes of [[psychiatric]] conditions and that these conditions can be improved with [[medication]] which corrects these imbalances. The phrase originated from the scientific study of [[brain chemistry]]. In the 1950s the [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs) and [[tricyclic antidepressants]] were accidentally discovered to be effective in the treatment of [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref name="csusm.edu">[http://www.csusm.edu/DandB/AD.html Drugs and the Brain: Antidepressants<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> 

These findings and other supporting evidence led scientist [[Joseph J. Schildkraut]] (1934–2006) to publish his paper called "The Catecholamine Hypothesis of Affective Disorders" in 1965.<ref name="neuro.psychiatryonline.org">[http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/citation/7/4/524 The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: a review of supporting evidence. 1965 [classical article&#93; - Schildkraut 7 (4)  524 - J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/08/us/08schildkraut.html Joseph J. Schildkraut obituary, ''New York Times'' (July 8, 2006)]</ref> Schildkraut associated low levels of [[neurotransmitter]]s with depression.

Research into other mental illnesses such as [[schizophrenia]] also found that too much activity of certain [[neurotransmitter]]s such as dopamine was correlated to these disorders. In the scientific community this hypothesis has been referred to as the "Monoamine hypothesis". This hypothesis has been a major focus of research in the fields [[pathophysiology]] and [[pharmacotherapy]] for over 25 years<ref name="touchneurology.com">[http://www.touchneurology.com/looking-beyond-monoamine-hypothesis-a5616-1.html Looking Beyond the Monoamine Hypothesis<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> and led to the development of new classes of drugs such as [[SSRI]]s (selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors).<ref name= "bio4102.homeip.net">[http://bio4102.homeip.net/labwiki/index.php/Mental_Illness Mental Illness - GSU Biology 4102 / 6102<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> 

This conceptual framework has been challenged within the scientific community, though no other demonstrably superior hypothesis has emerged. While the hypothesis has been shown to be simplistic and lacking, there is sufficient evidence to consider it as a useful heuristic in the aiding of our understanding of brain chemistry and explaining [[pharmacotherapy]].<ref name= "touchneurology.com"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schildkraut | year = | title = The Catecholamine Hypothesis of Affective Disorders: A review of Supporting Evidence | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/122/5/509 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 122 | issue = 5| page = 509 }}</ref> 

[[Wayne Goodman]], Chair of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] Psychopharmacological Advisory Committee, has described the serotonergic theory of depression as a "useful metaphor" for understanding [[clinical depression|depression]], though not one that he uses with his own psychiatric patients.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18825252.500.html Television adverts for antidepressants cause anxiety], from ''[[New Scientist]]''.

==Monoamine hypothesis==
{{main|Biology of depression#Monoamine hypothesis}}
The monoamine hypothesis is a biological hypothesis stating that [[clinical depression|depression]] is caused by the underactivity in the brain of [[monoamine]]s, such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.

In the 1950s the [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants were accidentally discovered to be effective in the treatment of depression. These findings and other supporting evidence led Joseph Schildkraut to publish his paper called "The Catecholamine Hypothesis of Affective Disorders" in 1965.<ref name= "neuro.psychiatryonline.org"/> Schildkraut associated low levels of neurotransmitters with depression. Research into other mental impairments such as [[schizophrenia]] also found that too little activity of certain neurotransmitters were connected to these disorders.

The hypothesis has been a major focus of research in the fields [[pathophysiology]] and [[pharmacotherapy]] for over 25 years.<ref name="touchneurology.com"/> and led to the development of new classes of drugs such as SSRIs ([[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s).<ref name="bio4102.homeip.net"/>

==Dopamine hypothesis==
In studying the causes of [[schizophrenia]], particular focus has been placed upon the function of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that a drug group which blocks dopamine function, known as the [[phenothiazines]], could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that  [[amphetamine]]s, which trigger the release of dopamine may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.<ref name="Laruelle_et_al_1996">{{cite journal |author=Laruelle M |coauthors=Abi-Dargham A, van Dyck CH, Gil R, D'Souza CD, Erdos J, McCance E, Rosenblatt W, Fingado C, Zoghbi SS, Baldwin RM, Seibyl JP, Krystal JH, Charney DS, Innis RB |year=1996 |title=Single photon emission computerized tomography imaging of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in drug-free schizophrenic subjects |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |volume=93 |doi=10.1073/pnas.93.17.9235 |pages=9235–40 |pmid=8799184 |issue=17 |pmc=38625 |bibcode=1996PNAS...93.9235L}}</ref> 

An influential theory, known as the [[Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]], proposed that a malfunction involving dopamine pathways was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. This theory is now thought to be overly simplistic as a complete explanation, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (called [[atypical antipsychotic]] medication) can be equally effective as older medication (called [[typical antipsychotic]] medication), but also affects [[serotonin]] function and may have slightly less of a [[dopamine]] blocking effect.<ref name="JonesPilowsky2002">{{cite journal |author=Jones HM |coauthors=Pilowsky LS |year=2002 |title=Dopamine and antipsychotic drug action revisited |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=181 |issue=4 |pages=271–275 |pmid=12356650 |doi=10.1192/bjp.181.4.271}}</ref>

==Criticisms==
According to critics, the chemical imbalance hypothesis has been overpromoted and continues to be advanced as factual by [[pharmaceutical]] companies. They believe the general population and many journalists have accepted this hypothesis into their understanding of mental illness uncritically.<ref name="Lacasse Leo 07">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12115-007-9047-3 |title=The Media and the Chemical Imbalance Theory of Depression |year=2007 |last1=Leo |first1=Jonathan |last2=Lacasse |first2=Jeffrey R. |journal=Society |volume=45|issue=1 |pages=35|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u37j12152n826q60/fulltext.pdf}}</ref> They have pointed to the lack of an established chemical ''balance'' (without which, they claim, the notion of an "imbalance" is meaningless). Certain pharmaceutical companies such as [[Pfizer]] continue to promote drugs like [[Zoloft]] with advertisements asserting that mental illness ''may'' be due to chemical imbalances in the brain, and that their drugs work to "correct" this imbalance.<ref name="Lacasse Leo 05">{{cite journal|unused_data=2(12):e392|url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/archive/1549-1676/2/12/pdf/10.1371_journal.pmed.0020392-L.pdf|title=Serotonin and depression: a disconnect between the advertisements and the scientific literature|author=Lacasse JR, Leo J|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=2|issue=12|pages=e392|date=2005 Dec|pmid=16268734|pmc=1277931|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392}}</ref> Most academics believe that the advertisements are oversimplified and don't fully explain what is happening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/516262 |title=Advertisements for SSRIs may be misleading}}</ref>

Chemical imbalance theories do not presume individual laboratory tests be obtained from a patient at the time of prescription, such as one would expect in the analogy to physical medicine. For example, someone suffering from schizophrenia is not given [[haloperidol]] on the basis of a laboratory test which shows that his or her dopamine level is too high.

Chemical imbalance theories distinguish between "side" and "main" drug effects in recording the response to the drug. "Side" effects are considered to be simple, direct, predictable, allowable effects which are merely "physical" but do include often flattened affect and memory, emotive and cognitive effects. These drug effects may then be cited capriciously as further evidence to confirm the diagnosis as correct, confusing cause and effect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

When "improvement" is measured in industry research studies, attention is given only to the "main" effect—typically a complex, indirect, interpersonal, perceptual, cultural change, thereby confusing cause with coincidence. In chemical imbalance theories, there are no effectiveness measures using standard social networks and associated tests before and after drug administration.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Chemical imbalance theories predominate in "streamline" public sector medicine for lower [[social class]] and [[homeless]] persons, where drugs constitute the only form of treatment. There is much wishful thinking in attribution of drug effect, particularly in cases like [[schizophrenia]], where there no longer exists a patient [non-drug user] control group available.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

One criticism while not outright rejecting the theory is that it has been scientifically proven{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} that things other than drugs can influence [[brain chemistry]]. Exercise releases [[endorphin]]s. Even our own thoughts change our brain chemistry. These natural methods of changing brain chemicals are claimed by critics to be preferable to drugs since drugs have side effects. Furthermore, some psychiatric drugs might{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} alter the mind by disabling [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]s and [[emotion]]s not just in circumstances where they're a problem but in circumstances where they're appropriate or even beneficial as well while natural ways to change brain chemistry can be used as needed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

There is also criticism that Chemical Imbalance theory does not take into account that there are feedback mechanisms in all neurotransmitter pathways.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} These feedback mechanisms are present in all mammals, and likely all forms of life utilizing neurons, and are absolutely required for information processing to function properly. Publications on chemical imbalance theory often do not properly follow the scientific method,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roggenbach|first=J|coauthors=Müller-Oerlinghausen, B; Franke, L|title=Suicidality, impulsivity and aggression--is there a link to 5HIAA concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid?|journal=Psychiatry Research|date=2002-12-15|volume=113|issue=1-2|pages=193–206|pmid=12467958|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12467958}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=L|first=McHenry|title=Ethical issues in psychopharmacology|journal=J Med Ethics.|year=2006|pmc=2564489|pmid=16816041|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.013185|volume=32|issue=7|pages=405–10}}</ref>  {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} and often gather data on changes to neurotransmitter systems in patients who are taking, or have taken, psychotropic medication. This skews data by confusing the cause of the illness with feedback mechanisms potentiated by psychotropic drugs. Limited publications on changes detected in neurotransmitters pathways in psychotropic drug naive patients have not been reproducible.
The primary neurotransmitter feedback mechanisms currently studied are:
* Receptor deletion (uncoupling),
* Receptor addition (supersensitivity),
* increase or decrease of neurotransmitter metabolism (manufacture),
* increase or decrease of neurotransmitter release,
* increase or decrease of reuptake (removal process from the synaptic cleft),
* increase or decrease of enzymatic breakdown of neurotransmitters (for monoamines like Dopamine, Serotonin, and Norepinephrine - this is done by the Monoamine Oxidase enzyme)
Receptor deletion and Receptor addition are implicated in causing psychiatric and physiological symptoms of dependence and withdrawal from psychotropic drugs. As feedback mechanisms also evolved to overcome the effect of molecules from eternal sources that interfere with receptors (and thereby interfere with information processing) through a variety of means, treatment with psychotropic drugs should produce 'withdrawal' like symptoms with long or even short term use of an unchanged dose (this is called dependence), thus the chemical imbalance theory is under attack due to published evidence on how feedback mechanisms respond to drugs - rather than a lack of evidence on changes in neurotransmitters in patients with mental illness. To date, all studied psychotropic drugs potentiate feedback mechanisms, some feedback mechanisms of which have been implicated in causing the same symptoms of the illness the drugs are approved to treat. It is currently understood that feedback mechanisms can lose their original reference point in some patients with some drugs (usually in long term treatment), meaning that a drug with the exact opposite effect is needed to repair the feedback mechanisms to end otherwise permanent drug withdrawal symptoms. The only class of drugs that had been studied in this manner are benzodiazepines, for treatment of 'protracted withdrawal syndrome' using a GABA agonist.
