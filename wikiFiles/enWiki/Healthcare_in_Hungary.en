[[Hungary]] has a tax-funded [[Universal health care|universal healthcare system]], organized by the state-owned National Healthcare Fund ({{lang-hu|Országos Egészségbiztosítási Pénztár (OEP)}}). Health insurance is absolutely free for [[children]], [[mother]]s or [[father]]s with [[baby]], [[student]]s, [[pensioner]]s, [[Poverty|people with socially poor background]] and [[Disability|handicapped people]] (including physical and mental disorders).<ref>[http://www.oep.hu/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/LAKOSSAG/OEPHULAK_EBELLAT/ACH%C3%8DVUM%202010/KIZAROLAG_EU_SZOLG_JOGOSULTAK.PDF List of the entitled people for free insurance, National Healthcare Fund]</ref> Health in Hungary can be described with a rapidly growing [[life expectancy]] and a very low [[infant mortality rate]] (4.9 per 1,000 [[Live birth (human)|live births]] in 2011).<ref>[http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/gyor/nep/nep21208.pdf Vital statistics, Hungarian Central Statistical Office]</ref> Hungary spent 7.4% of the GDP on health care in 2009 (it was 7.0% in 2000), lower than the average of the [[OECD]].

The first [[hospital]]s go back to the 13th century mining towns of Hungary. The first mining health insurance was founded by [[János Thurzó]] in 1496. The first modern insurer was established in 1907, named ''Országos Munkásbetegsegélyező és Balesetbiztosító Pénztár'' ("National Workers' Sick-benefit and Accident Fund"). 

The first steps to overall health insurance took place in the [[Miklós Horthy|Horthy era]] with the creation of ''Országos Társadalombiztosítási Intézet'' (lit. "National Social Insurance Institution") in 1928 (It is the predecessor of present-day ''Országos Egészségbiztosítási Pénztár''.). Social servises got complete to 1938, at that time the Hungarian social health insurance system was the most progressive and charitable in [[East-Central Europe]].

After the [[World War II]] the [[Hungarian Working People's Party|Communist government]] fully [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the social insurance, since then Hungarian healthcare system is state-owned, overall and available for all of the people.<ref>[http://www.oep.hu/portal/page?_pageid=34,32914&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL History of social insurance in Hungary, National Healthcare Fund]</ref>     
  
The free-market shift initiated after the end of [[People's Republic of Hungary|communist rule]] {{Years ago|1989}} years ago put a strain on the largely centralised, wholly tax-funded public health system, which required far-reaching reforms.<ref name="civ">[http://www.civitas.org.uk/nhs/download/Hungary.pdf Hungary’s Healthcare System]</ref> These resulted in the creation of the National Healthcare Fund ({{lang-hu|Országos Egészségbiztosítási Pénztár}}), in 1993.<ref name="OEP"/> The OEP, predominantly based on a [[social insurance]] system,<ref name="civ"/> is the public organization currently controlling the management of [[publicly-funded health care|health care]] in Hungary.<ref name="OEP">[http://www.oep.hu/portal/page?_pageid=34,32910&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL OEP - Főigazgatói köszöntő]</ref> Eighty-three percent of the financing for the health care comes from taxes and other public revenues.<ref>[http://www.eum.hu/english/main-policy-objectives/the-organisation-and Egészségügyi Minisztérium - The organisation and functioning of health insurance in hungary]</ref>

Participation in the insurance scheme is mandatory for everyone in the workforce, including also the self-employed.<ref name="who">[http://www.who.int/countryfocus/cooperation_strategy/ccsbrief_hun_en.pdf World Health Organization - Hungary]</ref> Most private hospitals also operate under the OEP framework.<ref name="OEP"/> Because of the past hiring policies, Hungarian hospitals often have redundancies of doctors, and a lack of nurses, resulting in an unproductive misuse of human resources.<ref name="civ"/>

So-called "gratitude payments", another communist legacy, require in practice a cash payment to have access to better treatments.<ref name="civ"/> Medical treatment deemed "medically necessary" is provided free of charge for [[European citizens]] in the country.<ref>[http://www.oep.hu/oepdok/fajlok/e.pdf Health Care Services Available During Temporary Stay in Hungary]</ref>

== Infrastructure ==
As a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income nation]], [[Hungary]] has a relatively developed health infrastructure. [[Ambulance]]s of the ''Országos Mentőszolgálat'' (''OMSZ'', "National Ambulance Service") reach all over the country at the very latest 15 minutes. Until the late 2013 OMSZ will built 20 new [[ambulance station]]s and will renew 60 others with the purchase of 200 new ambulances.<ref>[http://www.nepszava.hu/articles/article.php?id=588643 Tényleg kiérnek a mentők 15 perc alatt ("Ambulances get to under 15 minutes"), Népszava (Hungarian)]</ref> 

[[Air ambulance]] service got complete to 2009 with the grand opening of [[Szentes]] air ambulance station. Air ambulance bases (in [[Budaörs]], [[Balatonfüred]], [[Sármellék]], [[Pécs]], [[Szentes]], [[Debrecen]], [[Miskolc]]) cover all over Hungary, helicopters reach 85% of the country's territory at the very latest 15 minutes. Every national and county hospitals have [[heliport]], including the specialized and most professional university clinics and emergency centres in [[Budapest]], [[Pécs]], [[Szeged]] and [[Debrecen]].<ref>[http://www.varosivisszhang.hu/?p=2845 Átadták a légimentő bázist - a legmodenebb az országban ("Air ambulence base has opened - the most modern in the country"), Városi Visszhang (Hungarian)]</ref><ref>[http://www.airambulance.hu/index.php?mod=ShowStatic&page=bazis Air ambulance bases in Hungary, Hungarian Air Ambulance Plc. (English)]</ref> 

[[Hungarian Homeland Defence Forces]] also has air ambulences, the army's hospital in Budapest, named ''Magyar Honvédség Központi Kórháza - Állami Egészségügyi Központ'' ("Central Hospital of the Hungarian Homeland Defence Forces - State Medical Centre"), is the most prominent hospital in Hungary. [[Military helicopters]] also can landing at its heliport.<ref>[http://hvg.hu/itthon/20110510_helikopter_mi8_honvedkorhaz Mintha igazi lenne: helikopteres mentést gyakorolnak Budapesten ("Seems like reality : Military air ambulance training in Budapest"), HVG (Hungarian)]</ref>

== Statistics ==

Despite recent improvements, life expectancy in Hungary is still among the lowest in [[Europe]];<ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1073,46870091&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_product_code=TPS00025 Eurostat - Life expectancy at birth]</ref> [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma people]] have a life expectancy up to ten years lower than for ethnic Hungarians.<ref name="civ"/>

===Regional differences===
According to the last ''Országos Lakossági Egészségfelmérés'' ("National Population Health Survey") was held in 2003 the most healthy [[Regions of Hungary|region]] is [[Western Transdanubia]] and the last is the [[Southern Great Plain]]. There are huge differences between the western and eastern parts of Hungary, [[heart disease]], [[hypertonia]], [[stroke]] and [[suicide]] is prevalent in the mostly [[agricultural]] and low-income characteristic [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Plain]] (can be described as the Hungarian [[Stroke Belt]]), but infrequent in the high-income and [[middle class]] characteristic [[Western Transdanubia]]. [[Central Hungary]] (region of [[Budapest]]) is between east and west by health.<ref>[http://www.oefi.hu/olef/OLEF2003/Jelentesek/KronikusBbetegsegekOLEF2003.pdf Országos Lakossági Egészségfelmérés ("National Population Health Survey"), 2003, Dr. Dóra Hermann: Krónikus betegségek (Chronic illnesses)]</ref>
