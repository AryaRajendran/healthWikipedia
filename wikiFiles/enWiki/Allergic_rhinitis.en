'''Allergic rhinitis''' is an [[allergic]] [[inflammation]] of the nasal airways. It occurs when an [[allergen]], such as [[pollen]], dust or animal dander (particles of shed skin and hair) is inhaled by an individual with a sensitized [[immune system]]. In such individuals, the allergen triggers the production of the [[antibody]] [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE), which binds to [[mast cells]] and [[basophil granulocyte|basophils]] containing [[histamine]]. When caused by pollens of any plants, it is called '''pollinosis''', and if specifically caused by grass pollens, it is known as '''hay fever'''. While symptoms resembling a cold or flu can be produced by an allergic reaction to pollen from plants and grasses, including those used to make [[hay]], it does not cause a fever.

IgE bound to mast cells are stimulated by allergens, causing the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine (and other chemicals).<ref name=Dipiro08>{{cite book |last1=May |first1=J.R. |last2=Smith |first2=P.H. |chapter=Allergic Rhinitis |editor1-last=Dipiro |editor1-first=J.T. |editor2-last=Talbert |editor2-first=R.L. |editor3-last=Yee |editor3-first=G.C. |editor-first4=G. |editor4-last=Matzke |editor-first5=B. |editor-last5=Wells |editor-first6=L.M. |editor-last6=Posey |title=Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiologic Approach |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=007147899X |pages=1565–75 |edition=7th}}</ref> This usually causes [[sneezing]], itchy and watery eyes, swelling and inflammation of the nasal passages, and an increase in [[mucus]] production.  Symptoms vary in severity between individuals. Very sensitive individuals can experience [[hives]] or other [[rash]]es. Particulate matter in polluted air, and chemicals such as [[chlorine]] and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can greatly aggravate allergic rhinitis. The physician [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] first described hay fever in 1819 as a disease.

Allergies are common. Heredity and environmental exposures may contribute to a predisposition to allergies. It is roughly estimated that one in three people have an active allergy at any given time and at least three in four people develop an allergic reaction at least once in their lives. In Western countries between 10–25% of people annually are affected by allergic rhinitis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dykewicz MS, Hamilos DL |title=Rhinitis and sinusitis |journal=J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. |volume=125 |issue=2 Suppl 2 |pages=S103–15 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20176255 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2009.12.989 |url=}}</ref>

==Classification==
Allergic rhinitis may be seasonal or perennial.  Seasonal allergic rhinitis occurs particularly during pollen seasons. It does not usually develop until after 6 years of age.  Perennial allergic rhinitis occurs throughout the year. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly seen in younger children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rush.edu/rumc/page-1098987384061.html|title=Rush University Medical Center|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>

Allergic rhinitis may also be classified as Mild-Intermittent, Moderate-Severe intermittent, Mild-Persistent, and Moderate-Severe Persistent. Intermittent is when the symptoms occur <4 days per week or <4 consecutive weeks. Persistent is when symptoms occur >4 days/week and >4 consecutive weeks. The symptoms are considered mild with normal sleep, no impairment of daily activities, no impairment of work or school, and if symptoms are not troublesome. Severe symptoms result in sleep disturbance, impairment of daily activities, and impairment of school or work.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bousquet J, Reid J, van Weel C, ''et al.'' |title=Allergic rhinitis management pocket reference 2008 |journal=Allergy |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=990–6 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18691301 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01642.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0105-4538&date=2008&volume=63&issue=8&spage=990}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The characteristic symptoms of allergic rhinitis are: [[rhinorrhea]] (excess nasal secretion), [[pruritis|itching]], and nasal congestion and obstruction.<ref name=AFP10/> Characteristic physical findings include conjunctival swelling and [[erythema]], eyelid swelling, lower eyelid venous stasis (rings under the eyes known as "allergic shiners"), swollen [[nasal turbinates]], and middle ear effusion.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Valet RS, Fahrenholz JM |title=Allergic rhinitis: update on diagnosis |journal=Consultant |volume=49 |pages=610–3 |year=2009 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/display/article/10162/1465701}}</ref>

There can also be behavioural signs; in order to relieve the irritation or flow of mucus, patients may wipe or rub their nose with the palm of their hand in an upward motion: an action known as the "nasal salute" or the "[[allergic salute]]". This may result in a crease running across the nose, commonly referred to as the "[[transverse nasal crease]]", and can lead to permanent physical deformity if repeated enough.<ref name=pray221>{{cite book|last=Pray|first=W. Steven|title=Nonprescription Product Therapeutics|year=2005|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]]|location=p. 221|isbn=0781734983}}</ref>

Sufferers might also find that [[oral allergy syndrome|cross-reactivity]] occurs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Czaja-Bulsa G, Bachórska J |title=[Food allergy in children with pollinosis in the Western sea coast region] |journal=Pol Merkur Lekarski |volume=5 |issue=30 |pages=338–40 |year=1998 |pmid=10101519}}</ref> For example, someone allergic to birch pollen may also find that they have an allergic reaction to the skin of apples or potatoes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yamamoto T, Asakura K, Shirasaki H, Himi T, Ogasawara H, Narita S, Kataura A |title=[Relationship between pollen allergy and oral allergy syndrome] |journal=Nippon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho |volume=108 |issue=10 |pages=971–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16285612}}</ref> A clear sign of this is the occurrence of an itchy throat after eating an apple or sneezing when peeling potatoes or apples. This occurs because of similarities in the proteins of the pollen and the food.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malandain H |title=[Allergies associated with both food and pollen] |journal=Allerg Immunol (Paris) |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=253–6 |year=2003 |pmid=14626714}}</ref> There are many cross-reacting substances.

Some disorders may be associated with allergies: [[Comorbidity|Comorbidities]] include [[eczema]], [[asthma]] and [[clinical depression|depression]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Allergy testing==
Allergy testing may reveal the specific allergens to which an individual is sensitive. Skin testing is the most common method of allergy testing. This may include intradermal, scratch, patch, or other tests. Less commonly, the suspected allergen is dissolved and dropped onto the lower eyelid as a means of testing for allergies. This test should only be done by a physician, never the patient, since it can be harmful if done improperly. In some individuals who cannot undergo skin testing (as determined by the doctor), the [[RAST blood test]] may be helpful in determining specific allergen sensitivity. Peripheral [[eosinophilia]] can be seen in differential leukocyte count.

Allergy testing can either show allergies that aren't actually causing symptoms, or miss allergies that do cause symptoms.  
The intradermal allergy test is more sensitive than the skin prick test but is more often positive in people who do not have symptoms to that allergen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.webmd.com/allergies/allergy-tests | title=Allergy Tests}}</ref>

Even if a person has negative [[skin allergy test|skin-prick, intradermal]] and [[RAST test|blood tests]] for allergies, they may still have allergic rhinitis, from a local allergy in the nose.  This is called [[allergic rhinitis#Local allergic rhinitis|local allergic rhinitis]].<ref name="lar0">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e328334f5fb |title=Local allergic rhinitis: A new entity, characterization and further studies |year=2010 |last1=Rondón |first1=Carmen |last2=Canto |first2=Gabriela |last3=Blanca |first3=Miguel |journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=10 |pages=1–7 |pmid=20010094 |issue=1}}</ref> Specialized testing is necessary to diagnose local allergic rhinitis.<ref name="lar">{{cite journal |pmid=20945601 |year=2010 |last1=Rondón |first1=C |last2=Fernandez |first2=J |last3=Canto |first3=G |last4=Blanca |first4=M |title=Local allergic rhinitis: Concept, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic approach |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=364–71; quiz 2 p following 371 |journal=Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology |url=http://www.jiaci.org/issues/vol20issue5/cme.pdf}}</ref>

==Pollen allergies==
Allergic rhinitis triggered by the [[pollen]]s of specific seasonal plants is commonly known as "hay fever", because it is most prevalent during [[hay]]ing season. However, it is possible to suffer from hay fever throughout the year. The pollen which causes hay fever varies between individuals and from region to region; generally speaking, the tiny, hardly visible pollens of [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] [[plant]]s are the predominant cause. Pollens of [[entomophily|insect-pollinated]] plants are too large to remain airborne and pose no risk. Examples of plants commonly responsible for hay fever include:
* Trees: such as pine (''[[Pinus]]''), birch (''[[Betula]]''), alder (''[[Alnus]]''), cedar, hazel (''[[Corylus]]''), hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]''), horse chestnut (''[[Aesculus]]''), willow (''[[Salix]]''), poplar (''[[Populus]]''), plane (''[[Platanus]]''), linden/lime (''[[Tilia]]'') and olive (''[[Olea]]''). In northern latitudes birch is considered to be the most important allergenic tree pollen, with an estimated 15–20% of hay fever sufferers sensitive to birch pollen grains. A major antigen in these is a protein called  [[Bet v I allergen|Bet V I]]. Olive pollen is most predominant in Mediterranean regions. [[Hay fever in Japan]] is caused primarily by [[sugi]] (''Cryptomeria japonica'') and [[hinoki]] (''Chamaecyparis obtusa'') tree pollen.
** "Allergy friendly" trees include: [[Ash (Fraxinus)|ash]], red [[maple]], yellow [[poplar]], [[dogwood]], [[magnolia]], [[double-flowered]] [[cherry]], [[fir]], [[spruce]] and flowering [[plum]].<ref>[http://forestry.about.com/od/difficultissues/a/tree_allergy_3.htm Allergy Friendly Trees]</ref>

* Grasses (Family [[Poaceae]]): especially ryegrass (''[[Lolium]]'' sp.) and timothy (''[[Phleum pratense]]''). An estimated 90% of hay fever sufferers are allergic to grass pollen.
* Weeds: ragweed (''Ambrosia''), plantain (''[[Plantago]]''), nettle/parietaria ([[Urticaceae]]), [[mugwort]] (''Artemisia''), Fat hen (''[[Chenopodium]]'') and sorrel/dock (''[[Rumex]]'')

==Treatment==
The goal of rhinitis treatment is to prevent or reduce the symptoms caused by the inflammation of affected tissues. Measures which are effective include avoiding the allergen.<ref name=AFP10>{{cite journal |author=Sur DK, Scandale S |title=Treatment of allergic rhinitis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=81 |issue=12 |pages=1440–6 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20540482 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=20540482}}</ref> Intranasal [[corticosteroid]]s are the preferred treatment if medications are required with other options used only if these are not effective.<ref name=AFP10/> [[Mite]] proof covers, air filters, and withholding certain foods in childhood do not have evidence supporting their effectiveness.<ref name=AFP10/>

===Steroids===
[[Intranasal]] corticosteroids are used to control symptoms associated with sneezing, rhinorrhea, itching and nasal congestion.  It is an excellent choice for perennial rhinitis.<ref name=Dipiro08/> Steroid [[nasal spray]]s are effective and safe, and may be effective without oral antihistamines. They take several days to act and so need be taken continually for several weeks as their therapeutic effect builds up with time. 

Systemic [[steroids]] such as [[prednisone]] are effective at reducing nasal inflammation, but their use is limited by their short duration of effect and the side effects of prolonged steroid therapy.

===Other===
Other measures that may be used second line include: [[antihistamine]]s, [[decongestant]]s, [[cromolyn]], [[leukotriene receptor antagonist]]s, and nonpharmacologic therapies such as [[nasal irrigation]].<ref name=AFP10/>

Antihistamine drugs can have undesirable side-effects, most notably [[drowsiness]]. [[H1 antagonist#First-generation (non-selective, classical)|First generation antihistamine drugs]] such as [[diphenhydramine]] cause drowsiness, but [[H1 antagonist#Second-generation and third-generation (selective, non-sedating)|second- and third-generation antihistamines]] such as [[cetirizine]] and [[loratadine]] do not.<ref name=Dipiro08/>

Antihistamine drugs can be taken orally to control symptoms such as sneezing, rhinorrhea, itching and conjunctivitis.  It is best to take the medication before exposure, especially for seasonal allergic rhinitis. Ophthalmic antihistamines (such as [[ketotifen]]) are used for conjunctivitis; intranasal forms are used for sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal pruritus.<ref name=Dipiro08/>

[[Pseudoephedrine]] is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis. It is only used when nasal congestion is present and can be used with antihistamines. In the United States, oral decongestants containing pseudoephedrine must be purchased behind the pharmacy counter by law to combat the making of methamphetamine.<ref name=Dipiro08/>

[[Topical decongestant]]s may also be helpful in reducing symptoms such as nasal congestion, but should not be used for long periods as stopping them after protracted use can lead to a rebound nasal congestion called [[rhinitis medicamentosa]].

For nocturnal symptoms, intranasal [[corticosteroid]]s can be combined with nightly [[oxymetazoline]], an [[adrenergic alpha-agonist]], without risk of [[rhinitis medicamentosa]].<ref name="pmid21377716">{{cite journal| author=Baroody FM, Brown D, Gavanescu L, Detineo M, Naclerio RM| title=Oxymetazoline adds to the effectiveness of fluticasone furoate in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis. | journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol | year= 2011 | volume= 127 | issue= 4 | pages= 927–34 | pmid=21377716 | doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2011.01.037 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=21377716  }}</ref>

===Desensitization===
More severe cases of allergic rhinitis not responding to medication may benefit from [[allergen immunotherapy]] (allergy shots).<ref name=AFP10/> Allergen is given in gradually increasing doses till a maintenance dose is reached. Immunotherapy suppresses the formation of IgE and raises the titre of IgE antibody. Immunotherapy has to be given for a year before significant improvement of symptoms can be noticed. It is discontinued if uninterrupted treatment for five years shows no clinical improvement.

===Alternative treatments===
Therapeutic efficacy of complementary-alternative treatments is not supported by currently available evidence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Passalacqua G, Bousquet PJ, Carlsen KH, Kemp J, Lockey RF, Niggemann B, Pawankar R, Price D, Bousquet J |title=ARIA update: I--Systematic review of complementary and alternative medicine for rhinitis and asthma |journal=J.

The overall quality of evidence, however, is poor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Witt CM, Brinkhaus B |title=Efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis — An overview about previous and ongoing studies |journal=Auton Neurosci |volume= 157|issue= 1-2|pages= 42–5|year=2010 |month=July |pmid=20609633 |doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2010.06.006 |url=}}</ref>

==Complications==
Nasal allergy may cause recurrent [[sinusitis]] because of the obstruction to the sinus ostia. It may lead to the formation of [[nasal polyp|nasal polypi]]. Nasal allergy can result in serous otitis media and orthodontic problems. Patients of nasal allergy have four times more risk of developing [[bronchial asthma]].

==Local allergic rhinitis==
Local allergic rhinitis is an allergic reaction in the nose to an allergen, without systemic allergies. So [[skin allergy test|skin-prick]] and [[RAST test|blood tests]] for allergy are negative, but there are [[immunoglobulin E|IgE]] antibodies produced in the nose that react to a specific [[allergen]].  [[skin allergy test|Intradermal skin testing]] may also be negative.<ref name="lar"/>

The symptoms of local allergic rhinitis are the same as the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including symptoms in the eyes.  Just as with allergic rhinitis, people can have either seasonal or perennial local allergic rhinitis.  The symptoms of local allergic rhinitis can be mild, moderate or severe.  Local allergic rhinitis is associated with [[allergic conjunctivitis|conjunctivitis]] and [[asthma]].<ref name="lar"/>

In one study, about 25% of patients with rhinitis had local allergic rhinitis. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Rondón C, Campo P, Galindo L, Blanca-López N, Cassinello MS, Rodriguez-Bada JL, Torres MJ, Blanca M.
|title=Prevalence and clinical relevance of local allergic rhinitis. |journal=Allergy |volume=67 |issue=10|pages=1282-8 |year=2012 |pmid=22913574 }}</ref>
In several studies, over 40% of people who had been diagnosed with nonallergic rhinitis were found to actually have local allergic rhinitis.<ref name="lar0"/>  

Steroid nasal sprays and oral antihistamines have been found to be effective for local allergic rhinitis.<ref name="lar"/>
A preliminary study found that allergy shots were also effective,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rondón C, Blanca-López N, Aranda A, Herrera R, Rodriguez-Bada JL, Canto G, Mayorga C, Torres MJ, Campo P, Blanca M. |title=Local allergic rhinitis: allergen tolerance and immunologic changes after preseasonal immunotherapy with grass pollen |journal=J Allergy Clin.
