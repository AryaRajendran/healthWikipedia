'''Nephroptosis''' (also called '''floating kidney''' or '''renal ptosis''') is an abnormal condition in which the [[kidney]] drops down into the [[pelvis]] when the patient stands up. It is more common in women than in men. It has been one of the most controversial conditions among doctors in both its diagnosis and its treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Moss SW |title=Floating kidneys: a century of nephroptosis and nephropexy |journal=J.

==Cause==
It is believed to result from deficiency of supporting perirenal [[fascia]]e.

==Symptoms==
Nephroptosis is asymptomatic in most patients. However, nephroptosis can be characterized by violent attacks of colicky flank pain, nausea, chills, hypertension, [[hematuria]] and [[proteinuria]]. Patients with symptomatic nephroptosis often complain of sharp pains that radiate into the groin. Many patients also suggest a weighing feeling on the abdomen. Pain is typically relieved by lying down. The attack of [[colic]] pain is called 'Dittel's crisis' or 'renal paroxysm'.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is contemplated based upon patient symptoms. Diagnosis is confirmed during intravenous urography, by obtaining erect and supine films. 
 
==Treatment==
[[Nephropexy]] was performed in the past to stabilize the kidney, but presently surgery is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Laparoscopic nephropexy has recently become available for selected symptomatic patients.
