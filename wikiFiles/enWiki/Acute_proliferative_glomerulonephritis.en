'''Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis''' is a disorder of the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]] ([[glomerulonephritis]]), or small blood vessels in the kidneys. It is a common complication of infections, typically [[streptococcal skin infection]] ([[impetigo]]) rather than [[streptococcal pharyngitis]], for which it is also known as '''postinfectious''' or '''poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis'''.<ref name=Review10>{{cite journal |author=Baltimore RS |title=Re-evaluation of antibiotic treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis |journal=Curr. Opin. Pediatr. |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=77–82 |year=2010 |month=February |pmid=19996970 |doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833502e7 |url=}}</ref>

==Causes==
Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis can be a complication of [[streptococcal pharyngitis]] (strep throat) and [[impetigo]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Acute Glomerulonephritis Pathology Diagram.svg|thumb|Schematic representation.]]
The exact pathology remains unclear, but it is believed to be [[type III hypersensitivity]] reaction.  Immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes formed during an infection) become lodged in the [[glomerular basement membrane]] below the podocyte foot processes.  This creates a lumpy bumpy appearance on light microscopy and subepithelial humps on electron microscopy. [[Complement system|Complement]] activation leads to destruction of the basement membrane.  It has also been proposed that specific antigens from certain nephrotoxic streptococcal infections have a high affinity for basement membrane proteins, giving rise to particularly severe, long lasting antibody response.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis rarely requires a [[renal biopsy]] since there is usually a classical clinical presentation. There will be elevated levels of ASOT Ab and low complement levels (C3 and C4) in the blood.

===Presentation===
'''1) [[Hematuria]]''':<ref name="pmid18162726">{{cite journal |author=Sung HY, Lim CH, Shin MJ, ''et al.'' |title=A case of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage |journal=J.

* May be microscopic and not identified by the patient.

* May be macroscopic and lead to dark brown or smoky urine.

* Frank hematuria may occur in severe case.

'''2) [[Oliguria]]'''

* Urine output is less than 400 ml/day (normally 600 to 2500 ml/day). In children it is less than 0.5 mL/ kg/ hr.

* May not be observed by the patient.

'''3) Edema'''

* Acute onset.

* Mild to modest severity.

* Pitting edema.

* Starts in the eyelids and face then the lower and upper limbs then generalized (e.g. [[hydrocele]], [[ascites]]. [[pericardial effusion|pericardial]] and [[pleural effusion]].)

* It may be migratory: appearing in eyelid in the morning, disappearing in the afternoon, and reappearing around the ankle in ambulatory patients by the end of the day.

'''4) Hypertension'''.

* It is usually mild to moderate.

* Hypertensive [[encephalopathy]], [[heart failure]], and acute [[pulmonary edema]] may occur in severe cases.

* Pulmonary congestion and congested neck veins may be present, but is usually due to salt and water retention (and, less commonly, heart failure).

'''5) General'''

* Fever, headache, [[malaise]], anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.

* Pallor due to edema and/or anemia.

'''6) Acute renal necrosis due to injury of capillary or capillary thrombosis.'''

* Acute tubular obstruction by cast.

====Mechanism of edema====

Diffuse Proliferative Glomerulonephritis (DPGN) is a nephritic syndrome; therefore, it causes edema through an increase in hydrostatic pressure and fluid overload secondary to inflammatory damage. Examples of nephritic syndrome include: DPGN, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and MPGN. 

Hypoalbuminemia is the cause of edema in nephrotic syndrome (characterized by heavy proteinuria—greater than 3.5g/day). Examples include: minimal change disease (MCD), membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), lupus, amyloidosis, and diabetes.

===Differential diagnosis===

# Other causes of acute glomerulonephritis:
#*IgA Nephropathy
#*[[Lupus nephritis]]
#*Type 1 membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
#*Bacterial [[endocarditis]]
#*[[Shunt nephritis]]
#*[[Cryoglobulinemia]]
# Nephrotic syndrome
# Other causes of generalized edema:
#*Malnutrition
#*Malabsorption
#*Renal affection
#*Liver cell failure
#*Right side heart failure
#*[[Angioedema]]
# Other causes of hematuria

==Complications==
Possible complications of acute proliferative glomerulonephritis include [[renal failure]] and [[hypertensive encephalopathy]].
