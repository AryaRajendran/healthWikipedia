A '''systematic review''' is a [[literature review]] focused on a research question that tries to identify, appraise, select and synthesize all high quality research evidence relevant to that question. Systematic reviews of high-quality [[randomized controlled trial]]s are crucial to [[evidence-based medicine]].<ref name='CEBM_about'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cebm.net/index.aspx?o=1914 |title=What is EBM? |accessdate=2011-06-17 |date=2009-11-20 |publisher=[http://www.cebm.net/ Centre for Evidence Based Medicine] }}</ref> An understanding of systematic reviews and how to implement them in practice is becoming mandatory for all professionals involved in the delivery of [[health care]]. Besides health interventions, systematic reviews may concern clinical tests, public health interventions, social interventions, [[adverse effects]], and economic evaluations.<ref name=CRD2008>[http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/pdf/Systematic_Reviews.pdf Systematic reviews: CRD's guidance for undertaking reviews in health care.] York: [[University of York]], Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2008.

Systematic reviews are not limited to [[medicine]] and are quite common in other sciences where data are collected, published in the literature, and an assessment of methodological quality for a precisely defined subject would be helpful.<ref name="Herman2008">{{Cite book|author=Herman J.

== Characteristics ==
A systematic review aims to provide an exhaustive summary of literature relevant to a [[research question]]. The first step of a systematic review is a thorough search of the literature for relevant papers. The ''Methodology'' section of the review will list the [[database]]s and [[citation index]]es searched, such as [[Web of Science]], [[Embase]], and [[PubMed]], as well as any individual journals. Next, the titles and the abstracts of the identified articles are checked against pre-determined criteria for eligibility and relevance. This list will always depend on the research problem. Each included study may be assigned an objective assessment of methodological quality  preferably using a method conforming to PRISMA (the current guideline)<ref>http://www.prisma-statement.org/</ref> or the high quality standards of Cochrane collaboration.<ref>http://handbook.cochrane.org</ref> 

Systematic reviews often, but not always, use statistical techniques ([[meta-analysis]]) to combine results of the eligible studies, or at least use scoring of the levels of evidence depending on the methodology used.  An additional rater may be consulted to resolve any scoring differences between raters.<ref name="Herman2008" /> Systematic review is often applied in the [[biomedical research|biomedical]] or healthcare context, but it can be applied in any field of research. Groups like the [[Campbell Collaboration]] are promoting the use of systematic reviews in policy-making beyond just healthcare. 

A systematic review uses an objective and transparent approach for research synthesis, with the aim of minimizing bias. While many systematic reviews are based on an explicit [[quantitative research|quantitative]] [[meta-analysis]] of available data, there are also [[qualitative research|qualitative]] reviews which adhere to the standards for gathering, analyzing and reporting evidence. The [[EPPI-Centre]] has been influential in developing methods for combining both qualitative and quantitative research in systematic reviews.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7446.1010 |title=Integrating qualitative research with trials in systematic reviews |year=2004 |last1=Thomas |first1=J. |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7446 |pages=1010–2 |pmid=15105329 |last2=Harden |first2=A |last3=Oakley |first3=A |last4=Oliver |first4=S |last5=Sutcliffe |first5=K |last6=Rees |first6=R |last7=Brunton |first7=G |last8=Kavanagh |first8=J |pmc=404509}}</ref>

Recent developments in systematic reviews include realist reviews,<ref>{{cite doi| 10.1258/1355819054308530}}</ref> and the meta-narrative approach.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Fraser |last1=MacFarlane |first2=Olivia |last2=Kyriakidou |last3=Bate |first3=Paul |first4=Richard |last4=Peacock |last5=Greenhalgh |first5=Trisha |title=Diffusion of Innovations in Health Service Organisations: A Systematic Literature |series=Studies in Urban and Social Change |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Professional |year=2005 |isbn=0-7279-1869-9}}{{page needed|date=June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00578.x |title=Tensions and Paradoxes in Electronic Patient Record Research: A Systematic Literature Review Using the Meta-narrative Method |year=2009 |last1=Greenhalgh |first1=Trisha |last2=Potts |first2=Henry W.W. |last3=Wong |first3=Geoff |last4=Bark |first4=Pippa |last5=Swinglehurst |first5=Deborah |journal=Milbank Quarterly |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=729–88 |pmid=20021585 |jstor=25593645}}</ref> These approaches try to overcome the problems of methodological and [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[heterogeneity]] in the diverse literatures existing on some subjects.

==Cochrane Collaboration==
[[The Cochrane Collaboration]] is a group of over 28,000 specialists in health care who systematically review randomised trials of the effects of prevention, treatments and rehabilitation as well as health systems interventions. When appropriate, they also include the results of other types of research. Cochrane Reviews are published in ''The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' section of [[The Cochrane Library]]. The 2010 [[impact factor]] for ''The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' was 6.186, and it was ranked 10th in the “Medicine, General & Internal” category.<ref>The Cochrane Library. [http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/SpringboardWebApp/userfiles/ccoch/file/Impact%20Factor/FAQ%20for%202010%20IF.pdf 2010 impact factor. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Frequently asked questions.] Retrieved 2011-07-01.</ref>

The Cochrane Collaboration provides a handbook for systematic reviewers of interventions which "provides guidance to authors for the preparation of Cochrane Intervention reviews."<ref name=CochraneHandbook>Higgins JPT, Green S (editors). [http://www.cochrane-handbook.org Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions, version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011).] The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Retrieved 2011-06-17.</ref> The ''Cochrane Handbook'' outlines eight general steps for preparing a systematic review:<ref name=CochraneHandbook/>
# Defining the review question and developing criteria for including studies
# Searching for studies
# Selecting studies and collecting data
# Assessing risk of bias in included studies
# Analysing data and undertaking meta-analyses
# Addressing reporting biases
# Presenting results and "summary of findings" tables
# Interpreting results and drawing conclusions

The Cochrane Handbook forms the basis of two sets of standards for the conduct and reporting of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR - Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews)[http://www.editorial-unit.cochrane.org/mecir]

==Strengths and weaknesses==
While systematic reviews are regarded as the strongest form of medical evidence, a review of 300 studies found that not all systematic reviews were equally reliable, and that their reporting could be improved by a universally agreed upon set of standards and guidelines.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040078 |title=Epidemiology and Reporting Characteristics of Systematic Reviews |year=2007 |last1=Moher |first1=David |last2=Tetzlaff |first2=Jennifer |last3=Tricco |first3=Andrea C. |last4=Sampson |first4=Margaret |last5=Altman |first5=Douglas G. |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e78 |pmid=17388659 |pmc=1831728}}</ref>

A further study by the same group found that of 100 systematic reviews monitored, 7% needed updating at the time of publication, another 4% within a year, and another 11% within 2 years; this figure was higher in rapidly-changing fields of medicine, especially cardiovascular medicine.<ref name="pmid17638714">{{Cite journal |pmid=17638714 |year=2007 |last1=Shojania |first1=Kaveh G. |last2=Sampson |first2=Margaret |last3=Ansari |first3=Mohammed T. |last4=Ji |first4=Jun |last5=Doucette |first5=Steve |last6=Moher |first6=David |title=How Quickly Do Systematic Reviews Go Out of Date? A Survival Analysis |url=http://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=147&page=224 |volume=147 |issue=4 |pages=224–33 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine}}</ref> A 2003 study suggested that extending searches beyond major databases, perhaps into [[gray literature]], would increase the effectiveness of reviews.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0266462303000163 |title=Beyond Medline: reducing bias through extended systematic review search |year=2003 |last1=Savoie |first1=Isabelle |last2=Helmer |first2=Diane |last3=Green |first3=Carolyn J. |last4=Kazanjian |first4=Arminée |journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care |volume=19 |pmid=12701949 |issue=1 |pages=168–78}}</ref>

Systematic reviews are increasingly appearing in other fields, such as international development research.<ref name=Hagen-Zanker2012>{{cite web |first1=Jessica |last1=Hagen-Zanker |first2=Maren |last2=Duvendack |first3=Richard |last3=Mallett |first4=Rachel |last4=Slater |first5=Samuel |last5=Carpenter |first6=Mathieu |last6=Tromme |month=January |year=2012 |title=Making systematic reviews work for international development research |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=6260&title=systematic-review-slrc-international-development-research-methods |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}</ref> Subsequently, a number of donors – most notably the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and [[AusAid]] – are focusing attention and resources on testing the appropriateness of systematic reviews in assessing the impacts of development and humanitarian interventions.<ref name=Hagen-Zanker2012/>
