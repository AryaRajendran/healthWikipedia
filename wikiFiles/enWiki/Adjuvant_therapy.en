'''Adjuvant therapy''', also called '''adjuvant care''', is treatment that is given in addition to the primary, main or initial treatment. The [[surgeries]] and complex treatment regimens used in [[cancer therapy]] have led the term to be used mainly to describe [[adjuvant]] cancer treatments. An example of adjuvant therapy is the additional treatment<ref>{{MeshName|Chemotherapy, +Adjuvant}}</ref> usually given after surgery where all detectable disease has been removed, but where there remains a statistical risk of relapse due to occult disease. If known disease is left behind following surgery, then further treatment is not technically adjuvant.

==Adjuvant cancer therapy==
For example, [[radiotherapy]] or [[systemic therapy]] is commonly given as adjuvant treatment after surgery for [[breast cancer]]. Systemic therapy consists of [[chemotherapy]], [[immunotherapy]] or [[biological response modifiers]] or [[hormone therapy]]. [[Oncologist]]s use statistical evidence to assess the risk of disease relapse before deciding on the specific adjuvant therapy. The aim of adjuvant treatment is to improve disease-specific symptoms and overall survival. Because the treatment is essentially for a risk, rather than for provable disease, it is accepted that a proportion of patients who receive adjuvant therapy will already have been cured by their primary surgery.

Adjuvant systemic therapy and radiotherapy are often given following surgery for many types of cancer, including [[colon cancer]], [[lung cancer]], [[pancreatic cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], and some gynaecological cancers. Some forms of cancer fail to benefit from adjuvant therapy, however. Such cancers include [[renal cell carcinoma]], and certain forms of [[brain cancer]].

==Neoadjuvant therapy==
[[Neoadjuvant therapy]], in contrast to adjuvant therapy, is given before the main treatment. For example, systemic therapy that is given before removal of a breast is considered neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The most common reason for neoadjuvant therapy is to reduce the size of the tumor so as to facilitate more effective surgery.

==Concomitant or concurrent systemic therapy==
Concomitant or concurrent systemic therapy refers to administering medical treatments at the same time as other therapies, such as radiation. Adjuvant [[hormonal therapy]] is given after [[prostate]] removal in prostate cancer, but there are concerns that the [[side effect]]s, in particular the cardiovascular ones, may outweigh the risk of recurrence.

In breast cancer, adjuvant therapy may consist of [[chemotherapy]] ([[doxorubicin]], [[herceptin]], [[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[fluorouracil]], and [[methotrexate]]) and radiotherapy, especially after [[lumpectomy]], and hormonal therapy (tamoxifen, femara). Adjuvant therapy in breast cancer is used in stage one and two breast cancer following lumpectomy, and in stage three breast cancer due to [[lymph node]] involvement. 

In [[glioblastoma multiforme]], adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is critical in the case of a completely removed tumor, as with no other therapy, recurrence occurs in 1–3 months{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

Adjuvant therapy does not improve [[prognosis]] in stage I, II, and III renal cell carcinoma, with the possible exception of radiotherapy, which lowered the risk of local recurrence from 41% to 22% in one study{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. As a result of this resistance to chemotherapy, targeted therapies, including [[nexavar]], [[sutent]], [[rapamycin]] and [[interleukin 2]] that are known to be effective in stage IV [[renal cell carcinoma]] have been studied in the adjuvant setting, without good results.

In early stage one [[small cell lung carcinoma]], adjuvant chemotherapy with gemzar, [[cisplatin]], [[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]], and other chemotherapeutic agents, and adjuvant radiotherapy is administered to either the [[lung]], to prevent a local recurrence, or the [[human brain|brain]] to prevent [[metastases]].

In [[testicular cancer]], adjuvant either radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used following [[orchidectomy]]. Previously, mainly radiotherapy was used, as a full course of [[cytotoxic]] [[chemotherapy]] produced far more side effects then a course of [[external beam radiotherapy]] (EBRT)<ref>http url www.cancerconsultants.com</ref> However, it has been found a single dose of [[carboplatin]] is as effective as EBRT in stage 11 testicular cancer, with only mild side effects (transient [[myelosuppressive]] action vs severe and prolonged myelosuppressive [[neutropenic]] illness in normal chemotherapy, and much less [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[mucositis]], and no [[alopecia]] in 90% of cases, according to cancerconsultants.com).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Adjuvant therapy is particularly effective in certain types of cancer, including [[colorectal carcinoma]], [[lung cancer]], and [[medulloblastoma]]. In completely resected medulloblastoma, 5-year survival rate is 85% if adjuvant chemotherapy and/or craniospinal irradiation is performed, and just 10% if no adjuvant chemotherapy or craniospinal irradiation is used. Prophylactic cranial irradation for [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL) is technically adjuvant, and most experts agree that cranial irradation decreases risk of [[central nervous system]] (CNS) relapse in ALL and possibly [[acute myeloid leukemia]] (AML), but it can cause severe side effects, and adjuvant [[intrathecal]] [[methotrexate]] and [[hydrocortisone]] may be just as effective as cranial irraditon, without severe [[late effect]]s, such as [[developmental disability]], [[dementia]], and increased risk for second malignancy.

==Side effects of adjuvant therapy==
Depending on what form of treatment is used, adjuvant therapy can have [[side effect]]s, like all therapy for [[neoplasm]]s. Chemotherapy frequently causes [[vomiting]], [[nausea]], [[alopecia]], [[mucositis]], [[myelosuppression]] particularly [[neutropenia]], sometimes resulting in [[septicaemia]]. Some chemotheraputic agents can cause [[acute myeloid leukaemia]], in particular the [[alkylating agents]]. Rarely, this risk may outweigh the risk of recurrence of the [[primary tumor]]. Depending on the agents used, side effects such as [[neuropathy]], [[leukoencephalopathy]], [[bladder]] damage, [[constipation]] or [[diarrhea]], [[hemorrhage]], or [[post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment]].<ref>fragment sentence</ref> Radiotherapy causes [[radiation dermatitis]] and fatigue, and, depending on the area being irradiated, may have other side effects. For instance, [[radiotherapy]] to the [[brain]] can cause [[memory loss]], [[headache]], [[alopecia]], and radiation necrosis of the [[human brain|brain]]. If the abdomen or spine is irradiated, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dysphasgia can occur. If the pelvis is irradiated, prostitis, [[proctitis]], [[dysuria]], [[metritis]], diarrhea, and abdominal pain can occur. Adjuvant hormonal therapy for prostate cancer may cause cardiovascular disease, and other, possibly severe, side effects.

===Adjuvant therapy in malignant melanoma===
The role of adjuvant therapy in [[malignant melanoma]] is and has been hotly debated by oncologists. In 1995 a multicenter study reported improved long-term and disease-free survival in melanoma patients using [[interferon type I|interferon alpha 2b]] as an adjuvant therapy. Thus, later that year the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved interferon alpha 2b for melanoma patients who are currently free of disease, to reduce the risk of recurrence. Since then, however, some doctors{{Who|date=May 2010}} have argued that interferon treatment does not prolong survival or decrease the rate of relapse, but only causes harmful side effects. Those claims have not been validated by scientific research. 

Adjuvant chemotherapy has been used in malignant melanoma, but there is little hard evidence to use chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. However, melanoma is not a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy. [[Dacarbazine]], [[temozolomide]], and cisplatin all have a reproducible 10–20% response rate in metastatic melanoma.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}; however, these responses are often short-lived and almost never complete. Multiple studies have shown that adjuvant radiotherapy improves local recurrence rates in high-risk melanoma patients. The studies include at least two M.D. Anderson cancer center studies. However, none of the studies showed that adjuvant radiotherapy had a statistically significant survival benefit.

===Adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer===
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
Adjuvant chemotherapy is effective in preventing the outgrowth of micrometastatic disease from colorectal cancer that has been removed surgically. Studies have shown that fluorouracil is an effective adjuvant chemotherapy among patients with microsatellite stability or low-frequency [[microsatellite instability]], but not in patients with high-frequency microsatellite instability.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ribic CM, Sargent DJ, Moore MJ, ''et al.'' |title=Tumor microsatellite-instability status as a predictor of benefit from fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer |journal=N.
