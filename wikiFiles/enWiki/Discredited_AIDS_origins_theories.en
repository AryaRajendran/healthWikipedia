:''This article contains hypotheses not currently accepted by the majority of the scientific community. For the majority view within the scientific community, see [[History of HIV/AIDS]].''

Various alternate theories and other such hypotheses have arisen to speculate about the origins of [[HIV/AIDS]]. These alternative ideas range from suggestions that AIDS was the inadvertent result of experiments in the development of vaccines, to claims that [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] was developed by scientists working for the U.S. government. While a few reputable mainstream scientists once investigated some of these theories as reasonable hypotheses, this is no longer the case, as continuing research has invalidated the alternative ideas. The current [[scientific consensus]] is that AIDS originated in Africa in the mid-1930s from the closely related [[Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]].<ref>{{cite doi |10.1098/rstb.2001.0863}}</ref>

==Man-made or iatrogenic origins of AIDS==

* [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate and environmental activist [[Wangari Maathai]] was asked by a Time magazine interviewer if she stood by a previous alleged claim that "AIDS is a biological weapon manufactured by the developed world to wipe out the black race". Maathai responded, "I have no idea who created AIDS and whether it is a biological agent or not. But I do know things like that don't come from the moon. (...) I guess there is some truth that must not be too exposed."<ref>{{cite news| author=Faris, Stephan | title=10 Questions: Wangari Maathai | publisher=TIME.com/CNN | date=2004-10-10 | url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901041018-713166,00.html | accessdate=2007-03-19 }}</ref> Maathai subsequently issued a written statement in December 2004: "I neither say nor believe that the virus was developed by white people or white powers in order to destroy the African people. Such views are wicked and destructive."<ref>[http://greenbeltmovement.org/a.php?id=30 from the Green Belt Movement website- Wangari Maathai's "The Challenge of AIDS in Africa"].</ref>

* [[Jakob Segal]], a former biology professor at [[Humboldt University]] in then-[[East Germany]], proposed that HIV was engineered at a U.S. military laboratory at [[Fort Detrick]], by splicing together two other viruses, [[Visna]] and [[Human T-lymphotropic virus|HTLV-1]]. According to his theory, the new virus, created between 1977 and 1978, was tested on prison inmates who had volunteered for the experiment in exchange for early release. He further suggested that it was through these prisoners that the virus was spread to the population at large. After the end of the [[cold war]] however the former [[KGB]] agents Wassili Nikititsch Mitrochin and Oleg Gordijewski revealed independently of each other, that the Fort Detrick  hypothesis was a propaganda operation devised by the KGB's [[First Chief Directorate]] under the codename [[Operation INFEKTION|"infection"]]. Later it was also supported by the section X of [[East Germany]]'s [[Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung]] as admitted by its officer Günther Bohnensack. It is not entirely clear whether Segal pursued the hypothesis independently on his own accord or whether he was simply following orders. Segal himself always denied the latter and kept pursuing the hypothesis even after the operation had been canceled and the cold war had ended. It is known that Segal was in close contact with Russian KGB officers and Mitrochin mentioned him as a central asset of the operation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Andrew |first=Christopher|coauthors=Vasili Mitrokhin|title=The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB|publisher=Basic Books|year=1999|isbn=0-465-00310-9|page=319}}</ref><ref>Johanna Lutterroth: [http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/25017/das_propaganda_virus_des_kgb.html ''Aids-Verschwörung.

* [[Alan Cantwell]], in self-published books entitled ''AIDS and the Doctors of Death: An Inquiry into the Origin of the AIDS Epidemic'' and ''Queer Blood: The Secret AIDS Genocide Plot'', says that HIV is a genetically modified organism developed by U.S. Government scientists and that it was introduced into the population through [[Hepatitis B]] experiments performed on gay and bisexual men between 1978–1981 in major U.S. cities. Cantwell claims that these experiments were directed by [[Wolf Szmuness]], and that there was an ongoing government cover-up of the origins of the AIDS epidemic. Similar theories have been advanced by Robert B. Strecker, Matilde Krim and [[Milton William Cooper]].

* [[Leonard G. Horowitz]], author of the self-published works ''Emerging Viruses: AIDS & Ebola. Nature, Accident or Intentional?'' and ''Death in the Air: Globalism, Terrorism and Toxic Warfare'', advances the theory that the AIDS virus was engineered by such U.S. Government defense contractors as [[Litton Industries|Litton Bionetics]] for the purposes of bio-warfare and "population control."

:In contrast, a research article was published in 2010  suggesting that it might have been the actual eradication of smallpox and the subsequent ''ending'' of the mass vaccination campaign that contributed to the sudden emergence of HIV, due to the possibility that immunization against smallpox "might play a role in providing an individual with some degree of protection to subsequent HIV infection and/or disease progression".<ref>{{Cite journal

*The [[OPV AIDS hypothesis]] asserts that the oral [[polio vaccine]] was developed in chimpanzee tissues contaminated with a strain of [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV), and that an experimental mass vaccination program introduced the virus into the human population.

{{See also|AIDS denialism}}{{See also|AIDS in Africa}}

*The [[Duesberg hypothesis]] promoted by biologist [[Peter Duesberg]] argues that AIDS is not caused by HIV, but rather that HIV is a harmless [[passenger virus]], and that AIDS is caused by non-infectious agents like illegal drug usage.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02705115 | last1 = Duesberg | first1 = P | last2 = Koehnlein | first2 = C | last3 = Rasnick | first3 = D | title = The chemical bases of the various AIDS epidemics: recreational drugs, anti-viral chemotherapy and malnutrition. | journal = Journal of biosciences | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 383–412 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12799487 }}</ref> According to Peter Duesberg despite the fact that HIV causes AIDS, we only find HIV antibodies in patients. Furthermore he states that in patients dying of AIDS, HIV is present in less than 1 out of the 500 T-cells that become infected. Furthermore, he points out that there is yet no vaccine, no prevention, and not one single AIDS patient has been cured. Also, HIV is said to be the cause of the 26 AIDS defining diseases yet they can also occur without HIV. <ref> Duesberg, Peter, Claus Koehnlein, and David Rasnick.

==Prevalence of Conspiracy Beliefs==
*An anonymous telephone survey was conducted to identify the conspiracy beliefs regarding HIV and AIDS that are the most prevalent. The survey found that the majority somewhat or strongly believed that “a lot of information about AIDS is being withheld from the public” and over half somewhat or strongly believed that “there is a cure for AIDS, but it is being withheld.” Almost 60% disagreed that, "the government is telling the truth about AIDS." Over 40% somewhat or strongly agreed that, "people who take the new medicines for HIV are human guinea pigs for the government." <ref> Bogart, Laura M., and Sheryl Thorburn Bird. "Exploring the Relationship of Conspiracy Beliefs about HIV/AIDS to Sexual Behaviors and Attitudes Among African-American Adults."

This makes them less careful when engaging in practices that put them at risk because they believe there is no point. <ref> Fears, Darryl. "Study: Many Blacks Cite AIDS Conspiracy."
