'''Spermiogenesis''' is the final stage of [[spermatogenesis]], which sees the maturation of [[spermatid]]s into mature, motile [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]]. The spermatid is more or less circular cell containing a nucleus, Golgi apparatus, centriole and mitochondria. All these components take part in forming the spermatozoon.

==Phases==

The process of spermiogenesis is traditionally divided into four stages: the Golgi phase, the cap phase,formation of tail, and the maturation stage.<ref>[http://anatomy.iupui.edu/courses/histo_D502/D502f04/lecture.f04/Malef04/Male%20Reproduction-06.htm ANAT D502 â€“ Basic Histology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Golgi phase===

The spermatids, which up until now have been mostly [[Symmetry (biology)|radially symmetrical]], begin to develop polarity. 

* The head forms at one end, and the [[Golgi apparatus]] creates enzymes that will become the [[acrosome]].
* At the other end, it develops a thickened mid-piece, where the [[mitochondrium|mitochondria]] gather and the distal centriole begins to form an [[axoneme]].

Spermatid [[DNA]] also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged first, with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with [[protamine]]s during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed [[chromatin]] is transcriptionally inactive.

===Cap phase===
The Golgi apparatus surrounds the condensed nucleus, becoming the [[acrosome|acrosomal cap]].

===Formation of Tail===
One of the [[centriole]]s of the cell elongates to become the tail of the sperm. A temporary structure called the "manchette" assists in this elongation.

During this phase, the developing spermatozoa orient themselves so that their tails point towards the center of the lumen, away from the epithelium.

===Maturation phase===
The excess [[cytoplasm]], known as ''residual bodies'', is [[phagocytosed]] by surrounding [[Sertoli cells]] in the [[testes]].

==Spermiation==
The mature spermatozoa are released from the protective [[Sertoli cell]]s into the lumen of the [[seminiferous tubule]] and a process called ''spermiation'' then takes place, which removes the remaining unnecessary [[cytoplasm]] and [[organelles]]. 

The resulting spermatozoa are now mature but lack motility, rendering them sterile. The non-motile spermatozoa are transported to the [[epididymis]] in ''testicular fluid'' secreted by the Sertoli cells with the aid of [[peristalsis|peristaltic contraction]]. 

Whilst in the epididymis, they acquire motility. However, transport of the mature spermatozoa through the remainder of the [[male reproductive system]] is achieved via muscle contraction rather than the spermatozoon's motility. A glycoprotein coat over the acrosome prevents the sperm from fertilizing the egg prior to traveling through the male and female reproductive tracts. [[Capacitation]] of the sperm by the enzymes FPP (fertilization promoting peptide, produced by the male) and heparin (in the female reproductive tract) remove this coat and allow sperm to bind to the egg.
