'''Anatomical pathology''' (''Commonwealth'') or '''Anatomic pathology''' (''U.S.'') is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the [[gross examination|gross]], [[Histopathology|microscopic]], chemical, immunologic and [[Molecular pathology|molecular]] examination of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], and whole bodies ([[autopsy]]). Its modern beginner was the [[Italy|Italian]] scientist [[Giovan Battista Morgagni]] from [[Forlì]].

Anatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology, the other being [[clinical pathology]], the diagnosis of disease through the [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] analysis of [[bodily fluid]]s and/or tissues. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as [[general pathology]]. The distinction between anatomic and clinical pathology is increasingly blurred by the introduction of technologies that require new expertise and the need to provide patients and referring physicians with integrated diagnostic reports.  Similar specialties exist in [[veterinary pathology]].

==Differences between Anatomic Pathology and Clinical Pathology==
Anatomic pathology relates to the processing of surgical and gynecological specimens. Its subsections usually include surgical pathology, histology and cytology. Clinical pathology is the division that processes the test requests more familiar to the general public; such as blood cell counts, coagulation studies, urinalysis, blood glucose level determinations and throat cultures. Its subsections include chemistry, hematology, microbiology, immunology, urinalysis and blood bank.<ref>http://www.springhillmedicalcenter.com/what-we-do/laboratory.aspx</ref>

Anatomical pathology is itself divided in subspecialties, the main ones being [[surgical pathology]], [[cytopathology]], and [[forensic pathology]].  In many countries, to be [[Medical license|licensed]] to practice pathology, one has to complete [[medical school]] and secure a license to practice medicine.  An approved [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] program and certification (in the U.S., the [[American Board of Pathology]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Pathology]]) is usually required to obtain employment or hospital privileges.

==Skills and procedures==
The procedures used in anatomic pathology include:
* [[Gross examination]] - the examination of diseased tissues with the naked eye. This is important especially for large tissue fragments, because the disease can often be visually identified. It is also at this step that the pathologist selects areas that will be processed for histopathology. The eye can sometimes be aided with a [[magnifying glass]] or a [[optical microscope|stereo microscope]], especially when examining parasitic organisms.
* [[Histopathology]] - the [[microscope|microscopic]] examination of stained tissue sections using [[histology|histological]] techniques. The standard stains are [[haematoxylin]] and [[eosin]], but many others exist. The use of haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides to provide specific diagnoses based on morphology is considered to be the core skill of anatomic pathology. The science of staining tissues sections is called [[histochemistry]].
* [[Immunohistochemistry]] - the use of antibodies to detect the presence, abundance, and localization of specific proteins. This technique is critical to distinguishing between disorders with similar morphology, as well as characterizing the molecular properties of certain cancers.
* [[In situ hybridization]] - Specific [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] molecules can be identified on sections using this technique. When the probe is labeled with [[fluorescent]] dye, the technique is called [[Fluorescent in situ hybridization|FISH]].
* [[Cytopathology]] - the examination of loose cells spread and stained on glass slides using [[Cell biology|cytology]] techniques.
* [[Electron microscopy]] - the examination of tissue with an electron microscope, which allows much greater magnification, enabling the visualization of [[organelles]] within the cells. Its use has been largely supplanted by [[immunohistochemistry]], but it is still in common use for certain tasks, including the diagnosis of [[kidney]] disease and the identification of [[immotile cilia syndrome]] among many others.
* Tissue [[cytogenetics]] - the visualization of chromosomes to identify genetics defects such as [[chromosomal translocation]].
* [[Flow cytometry|Flow immunophenotyping]] - the determination of the [[immunophenotype]] of cells using [[flow cytometry]] techniques. It is very useful to diagnose the different types of [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]].

==Subspecialties==

===Surgical pathology===
{{main|Surgical pathology}}
[[Surgical pathology]] is the most significant and time-consuming area of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of [[surgery|surgical]] specimens, as well as [[biopsy|biopsies]] submitted by non-[[surgeon]]s such as [[internal medicine|general internists]], [[internal medicine|medical subspecialists]], [[dermatologist]]s, and [[interventional radiologist]]s. Surgical pathology increasingly requires technologies and skills traditionally associated with clinical pathology such as molecular diagnostics.

===Oral and maxillofacial pathology===
In the United States, subspecialty-trained doctors of [[dentistry]], rather than medical doctors, can be certified by a professional board to practice Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology.

===Cytopathology===
{{main|Cytopathology}}
[[Cytopathology]] is a sub-discipline of anatomical pathology concerned with the microscopic examination of whole, individual cells obtained from smears or fine needle aspirates. Cytopathologists are trained to perform fine-needle aspirates of superficially located organs, masses, or cysts, and are often able to render an immediate diagnosis in the presence of the patient and consulting physician. In the case of screening tests such as the [[Pap smear|Papanicolaou smear]], non-physician cytotechnologists are often employed to perform initial reviews, with only positive or uncertain cases examined by the pathologist. Cytopathology is a board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S.

===Molecular pathology===
{{main|Molecular pathology}}
[[Molecular pathology]] is an emerging discipline within anatomical and clinical pathology that is focused on the use of nucleic acid-based techniques such as in-situ hybridization, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and nucleic acid microarrays for specialized studies of disease in tissues and cells. Molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic and clinical pathology, and is sometimes considered a "crossover" discipline.

===Autopsy pathology===
{{main|Autopsy}}
General anatomical pathologists are trained in performing [[autopsies]], which are used to determine the disease factors contributing to a person's death. Autopsies are important in the ongoing medical education of clinicians, and in efforts to improve and verify the quality of medical care. In addition to pathologists, additional staff including [[Diener]]s and [http://www.pathologistsassistants.org Pathologists Assistants] are often involved in performing autopsies. 
Autopsies represent less than 10% of the workload of typical pathologists in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith R D |title=Some characteristics of the community practice of pathology in the United States. National Manpower Survey of 1987. |journal=Arch Pathol Lab Med |volume=113 |issue=12 |pages=1335–42 |year=1989 |pmid=2589945 |last2=Benson |first2=ES |last3=Anderson |first3=RE |last4=Tholen |first4=D}}</ref> 
However, the autopsy is central to public perceptions of the field, in part due to portrayals of pathologists on television programs such as ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' and ''[[Silent Witness]]''.

===Forensic pathology===
{{main|Forensic pathology}}
[[Forensic_pathology#Scope_of_forensic_pathology|Forensic pathologists]] receive specialized training in determining the cause of death and other legally relevant information from the bodies of persons who died suddenly with no known medical condition, those who die from non-natural causes, as well as those dying as a result of homicide, or other criminally suspicious deaths.  A majority of the forensic pathologists cases are due to natural causes. Often, additional tests such as toxicology, histology, and genetic testing will be used to help the pathologist determine the cause of death.  Because of this, it is necessary for forensic pathologists to have a strong background in anatomical pathology before becoming forensic pathologists.  Forensic pathologists will often testify in courts regarding their findings in cases of homicide and suspicious death. They also play a large role in public health, such as investigating deaths in the workplace, deaths in custody, as well as sudden and unexpected deaths in children.  
Forensic pathologists often have special areas of interest within their practice, such as sudden death due to cardiac pathology, deaths due to drugs, or Sudden Infant Death (SIDS), and various others.

==Training and certification of Anatomical Pathologists==

===Australia===
*'''(Also New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia)'''
Anatomical Pathology one of the specialty training programs offered by the [http://www.rcpa.edu.au Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA)]. The [[RCPA]]. To qualify as a Fellow of the RCPA in Anatomical Pathology, the candidate must complete a recognised undergraduate or postgraduate medical qualification, then complete a minimum of 1 year of clinical medical experience (internship)as a prerequisite to selection as a training registrar. The training program is a minimum of 5 years, served in at least two laboratories, and candidates must pass a Basic Pathological Sciences examination (usually in first year), the Part 1 examination (not before 3rd year) and the Part 2 examination (not before 5th year). Fellows may then continue into subspecialty training.

===Canada===
Anatomical Pathology (AP) is one of the specialist certificates granted by the [http://rcpsc.medical.org/main_e.php Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]. Other certificates related to pathology include general pathology (GP), forensic pathology, hematopathology, and neuropathology. Candidates for any of these must have completed four years of medical school and five years of residency training. After becoming certified in either AP or GP, it is common for pathologists to seek further fellowship training in a subspecialty of AP.

===USA===
Anatomic Pathology (AP) is one of the two primary certifications offered by the American Board of Pathology (the other is [[Clinical Pathology]] (CP))<ref>http://www.abpath.org/default.aspx</ref> and one of three primary certifications offered by the American Osteopathic Board of Pathology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Specialties & Subspecialties|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/development/aoa-board-certification/Pages/specialty-subspecialty-certification.aspx|publisher=AOA|accessdate=2 October 2012}}</ref> To be certified in anatomic pathology, the trainee must complete four years of medical school followed by three years of residency training. Many U.S. pathologists are certified in both AP and CP, which requires a total of four years of residency. After completing residency, many pathologists enroll in further years of fellowship training to gain expertise in a subspecialty of AP.

==Anatomical pathology practice settings==
<!-- References to be added soon | May, 2007 -->
*''Academic anatomical pathology'' is practiced at university medical centers by pathologists who are also university faculty. As such, they often have diverse responsibilities that may include training pathology [[Residency (medicine)|residents]], teaching [[medical students]], conducting [[basic research|basic]], [[clinical research|clinical]], or [[translational research]], and/or performing administrative duties, all in addition to the practice of diagnostic anatomical pathology. Pathologists in academic settings often sub-specialize in a particular area of anatomic pathology and may serve as consultants to other pathologists regarding cases in their specific area of expertise.

*''Group practice'' is the most traditional private practice model. In this arrangement, a group of senior pathologists will control a partnership that employs junior pathologists and contracts independently with hospitals to provide diagnostic services, as well as attracting referral business from local clinicians who practice in the outpatient setting. The group often owns a laboratory for [[histology]] and ancillary testing of tissue, and may hold contracts to run hospital-owned labs. Many pathologists who practice in this setting are trained and certified in both anatomical pathology and [[clinical pathology]], which allows them to supervise [[blood banking|blood banks]], [[clinical chemistry]] laboratories, and [[medical microbiology]] laboratories as well.

*Large ''corporate providers of anatomical pathology services'' have emerged in recent years, the most notable one being ''[[AmeriPath]]'' in the United States. In this model, pathologists are employees, rather than independent partners. This model has been criticized for reducing physician independence, but defenders claim that the larger size of these practices allows for [[economies of scale]] and greater specialization, as well a sufficient volume to support more specialized testing methods.

*''Multispecialty groups'', composed of physicians from clinical specialties as well as [[radiology]] and pathology, are another practice model. In some case, these may be large groups controlled by an [[HMO]] or other large healthcare organization. In others, they are in essence clinician group practices that employ pathologists to provide diagnostic services for the group. These groups may own their own laboratories, or, in some cases may make controversial arrangements with "pod labs" that allow clinician groups to lease space, with the clinican groups receiving direct insurance payments for pathology services.<ref>[http://www.cap.org/apps/docs/cap_today/feature_stories/0105OIG.html] Congress of American Pathologists Feature story - "Out of joint OIG takes dim view of pod lab setup" January, 2005 (Accessed 5-19-2007)</ref> Proposed changes to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] regulations may essentially eliminate these arrangements in the United States.<ref>[http://www.fosterswift.com/pdfs/pubs/hclraugust2006a.pdf] Foster, Swift, Collins, and Smith, P.C. - Health Care Alert, August 2006.</ref>
