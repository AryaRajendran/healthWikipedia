In [[human anatomy]] (female), the '''Skene's''' ''\ˈskēnz-\'' '''glands''' (also known as the '''lesser vestibular glands''', '''periurethral glands''', '''skene glands''', '''paraurethral glands''',<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/20823231|paraurethral glands}}</ref> '''female [[prostate]]''') are [[glands]] located on the anterior wall of the [[vagina]], around the lower end of the [[urethra]]. They drain into the urethra and near the urethral opening and may be near or a part of the [[G-Spot]]. These glands are surrounded with tissue (which includes the part of the [[clitoris]]) that reaches up inside the vagina and swells with [[blood]] during [[sexual arousal]].

==Homology and possible functions==
===Female ejaculation===
{{Main|Female ejaculation}}
The location of the Skene's gland is the general area of the [[vulva]], glands located on the anterior wall of the vagina around the lower end of the [[urethra]]. It has been postulated that the Skene's glands are the source of [[female ejaculation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rabinerson D, Horowitz E |title=[G-spot and female ejaculation: fiction or reality?] |language=Hebrew |journal=Harefuah |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=145–7, 163 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17352286 |doi= |url=}}</ref> In 2002, Emanuele Jannini of [[L'Aquila University]] in Italy showed that there may be an explanation both for the phenomenon and for the frequent denials of its existence. Skene's glands have highly variable anatomy, and in some extreme cases they appear to be absent entirely. If Skene's glands are the cause of female ejaculation and [[G-Spot]]-orgasms, this may explain the absence in many women.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jannini E, Simonelli C, Lenzi A | title = Sexological approach to ejaculatory dysfunction | journal = Int J Androl | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 317–23 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12406363 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2605.2002.00371.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Jannini E, Simonelli C, Lenzi A | title = Disorders of ejaculation | journal = J Endocrinol Invest | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–19 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12553564}}</ref>

It has been demonstrated that a large amount of lubricating fluid (filtered blood plasma{{Specify|date=May 2010}}) can be secreted from this gland when stimulated from inside the vagina.<ref name=heath>{{cite journal |author=Heath D |title=An investigation into the origins of a copious vaginal discharge during intercourse: "Enough to wet the bed" - that "is not urine" |journal=J Sex Res. |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=194–215 |year=1984 |doi=10.1080/00224498409551217}}</ref> Some reports indicate that embarrassment regarding female ejaculation, and the mistaken notion that the substance is urine, can lead to purposeful suppression of sexual climax, leading women to seek medical advice and even undergo surgery to "stop the urine".<ref name="chalker">{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=m3m3_Uq8qWkC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94 | author = Chalker, Rebecca | title = The Clitoral Truth: The secret world at your fingertips | publisher = Seven Stories | location = New York| year = 2002 | isbn = 1-58322-473-4}}</ref>
