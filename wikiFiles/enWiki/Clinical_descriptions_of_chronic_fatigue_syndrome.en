The '''clinical descriptions of [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]''' ('''CFS''') vary. Different agencies and scientific bodies have produced different guidelines to define the condition, with some overlap of [[symptom]]s between descriptions. Aspects of the condition are [[Controversies related to chronic fatigue syndrome|controversial]], with disagreements over etiology, pathophysiology, treatment and [[alternative names for chronic fatigue syndrome|naming]] between medical practitioners, researchers, patients and advocacy groups. Subgroup analysis suggests that, depending on the applied definition, the CFS population may represent a variety of conditions rather than a single disease entity.

==Definitions==
===CDC 1994 criteria===
The most widely used diagnostic criteria for CFS<ref name = Wyller>{{cite journal |author=Wyller VB |title=The chronic fatigue syndrome--an update |journal=Acta neurologica Scandinavica. Supplementum |volume=187 |issue= |pages=7–14 |year=2007 |pmid=17419822 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.2007.00840.x |url=}}</ref> are the 1994 research guidelines proposed by the "International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group", led by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].<ref name = aboutcfs>{{cite web | title = About CFS: What is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?  | work = | publisher = National Institutes of Health | date = | url = http://orwh.od.nih.gov/cfs/aboutHistory.html | doi = | accessdate = 2009-06-27}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="CDC1994">{{cite journal | author = Fukuda K, Straus S, Hickie I, Sharpe M, Dobbins J, Komaroff A | title = The chronic fatigue syndrome: a comprehensive approach to its definition and study.

The 1994 CDC criteria specifies the following conditions must be met:

;Primary symptoms
Clinically evaluated, unexplained, persistent or relapsing chronic fatigue that is: 
* of new or definite onset (has not been lifelong);
* is not the result of ongoing exertion;
* is not substantially alleviated by rest; and
* results in substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities.

;Additional requirements
The concurrent occurrence of four or more of the following symptoms, all of which must have persisted or recurred during 6 or more consecutive months of illness and must not have predated the fatigue:
#self-reported impairment in [[short-term memory]] or [[concentration]] severe enough to cause substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social, or personal activities;
#[[sore throat]];
#tender cervical or axillary [[lymph nodes]];
#[[muscle pain]];
#multi-[[joint pain]] without joint swelling or redness;
#[[headaches]] of a new type, pattern, or severity;
#unrefreshing [[sleep]];
#post-exertional [[malaise]] lasting more than 24 hours.

;Final requirement
All other known causes of chronic fatigue must have been ruled out, specifically clinical depression, side effects of medication, eating disorders and substance abuse.

The clinical evaluation should include:
# A thorough history that covers medical and psychosocial circumstances at the onset of fatigue; depression or other psychiatric disorders; episodes of medically unexplained symptoms; alcohol or other substance abuse; and current use of prescription and over-the-counter medications and food supplements;
# A mental status examination to identify abnormalities in mood, intellectual function, memory, and personality. Particular attention should be directed toward current symptoms of depression or anxiety, self-destructive thoughts, and observable signs such as psychomotor retardation. Evidence of a psychiatric or neurologic disorder requires that an appropriate psychiatric, psychological, or neurologic evaluation be done;
# A thorough physical examination;
# A minimum battery of laboratory screening tests, including complete blood count with leukocyte differential; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, and creatinine; determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone; and urinalysis.

Other diagnostic tests have no recognized value unless indicated on an individual basis to confirm or exclude a differential diagnosis, such as [[multiple sclerosis]].

===CDC 1988 criteria===
The initial chronic fatigue syndrome definition was published in 1988. It is also called the "Holmes definition", after the manuscript's first author.<ref name=Holmes1988>{{cite journal |author=Holmes GP |title=Chronic fatigue syndrome: a working case definition |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=387–9 |year=1988 |month=March |pmid=2829679 |doi= |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Kaplan JE |author3=Gantz NM |display-authors=3 |last4=Komaroff |first4=AL |last5=Schonberger |first5=LB |last6=Straus |first6=SE |last7=Jones |first7=JF |last8=Dubois |first8=RE |last9=Cunningham-Rundles |first9=C}} [http://www.medicineau.net.au/clinical/medicine/CFS.html#holmes Details]</ref> Unlike the 1994 CDC criteria, the Holmes criteria exclude patients with psychiatric diagnoses and require the presence of eight secondary symptoms, not just four.

===Oxford 1991 criteria===
The ''Oxford criteria'' were published in 1991<ref name="oxford">{{cite journal |author=Sharpe MC |title=A report--chronic fatigue syndrome: guidelines for research |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=118–21 |year=1991 |month=February |pmid=1999813 |pmc=1293107 |doi= |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Archard LC |author3=Banatvala JE |display-authors=3 |last4=Borysiewicz |first4=LK |last5=Clare |first5=AW |last6=David |first6=A |last7=Edwards |first7=RH |last8=Hawton |first8=KE |last9=Lambert |first9=HP}} Synopsis by {{GPnotebook|-476446699}})</ref> and include both CFS of unknown etiology and a subtype of CFS called post-infectious fatigue syndrome (PIFS), which "either follows an infection or is associated with a current infection." Important differences are that the presence of mental fatigue is necessary to fulfill the critera and  symptoms are accepted that may suggest a psychiatric disorder.<ref name = Wyller />

===Canadian 2003 criteria===
A clinical case definition for ME/CFS was initiated by [[Health Canada]] and published by an international group of researchers in 2003.<ref name="carr">{{cite journal | author = Carruthers BM | title = Myalgic encephalomyalitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: Clinical working definition, diagnostic and treatment protocols | journal = Journal of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–36 | year = 2003 | url = http://www.cfids-cab.org/MESA/ccpccd.pdf |format=PDF| doi = 10.1300/J092v11n01_02 | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Jain | first2 = Anil Kumar | last3 = De Meirleir | first3 = Kenny | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Daniel | last5 = Klimas | first5 = Nancy | last6 = Lerner | first6 = A. Martin | last7 = Bested | first7 = Alison | last8 = Flor-Henry | first8 = Pierre | last9 = Joshi | first9 = Pradip}}</ref> Diagnosis requires "two or more neurological/cognitive manifestations" and one or more symptoms from at least two of the categories of autonomic, neuroendocrine and immune manifestations, in addition to multiple major criteria of fatigue, post exertional malaise and/or fatigue, chronic pain and sleep dysfunction. The definition is also referred to as the Canadian consensus criteria.<ref name=PMID2680051>{{cite journal |author=Myhill S, Booth NE, McLaren-Howard J |title=Chronic fatigue syndrome and mitochondrial dysfunction |journal=Int J Clin Exp Med |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |year=2009 |pmid=19436827 |pmc=2680051 |doi= |url=http://www.ijcem.com/files/IJCEM812001.pdf}}</ref>

An important difference is that the Canadian definition excludes patients with symptoms of mental illness.<ref name = Wyller /> It was updated in 2010 to provide greater specification to the original. Functional impairment must be below defined thresholds in two of the three designated subscales of the [[SF-36|Short Form 36 Health Survey]] i.e. Vitality, Social Functioning, and Role-Physical. Criterion symptoms which predate fatigue onset can now be counted towards diagnosis, and individuals "who do not meet the fatigue criterion may still obtain a Clinical ME/CFS diagnosis if they meet the other five criteria".<ref name="revised-CCC">{{cite journal | author = Jason,L.A., Evans,M., Porter,N., Brown,M., Brown,A., Hunnell,J., Anderson, V., Lerch, A., De Meirleir, K., & Friedberg, F. | title = The Development of a Revised Canadian Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Case Definition | journal = American Journal of Biochemistry and Biotechnology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 120–135 | year = 2010 | month = | pmid = | doi = 10.3844/ajbbsp.2010.120.135}}</ref>

===London criteria===
The ''London criteria'' were designed for research purposes and used by AFME in all the studies funded by them until the mid 90s. An incomplete version edited by Nick Anderson (CEO of AFME) was published in a 1994 report.  These revised criteria require exercise-induced fatigue; memory and concentration impairment, normally accompanied by other neurological or psychological symptoms; and variability of symptoms, often brought on by mental or physical activity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meassociation.org.uk/?p=4702 |title=London Criteria for M.E. – for website discussion |author=Shepherd, Charles |date=2011-02-21}}</ref>
In light of the advances in understanding of CFS, the criteria were updated in 2009. These have been cited in articles and are currently being evaluated, for example, in studies to ascertain differences between patients selected using different case definitions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jason|first=LA|coauthors=Brown AA, Clyne E, Bartgis L, Evans M, Brown M.|title=Contrasting case definitions for chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis|journal=Evaluations & the Health Professions|year=2011|month=December|pages=1–25|doi=10.1177/016327871142481|pmid=22158691}}</ref>

===2011 'international consensus criteria' for ME===
Developed by a group of 26 individuals from 13 countries and consisting of clinicians, researchers, teaching faculty and an independent patient advocate. Based on the 2003 "Canadian" definition by Carruthers et al, chronic fatigue is no longer required and the six-month waiting period before diagnosis has been dropped. The main symptom is "post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion" (PENE) i.e. low stamina, rapid fatigability, symptom exacerbation, and variable onset with prolonged recovery; which is also accompanied by symptoms from neurological, immune/gastro-intestinal/genitourinary, and energy metabolism/transport impairment categories, and at least a 50% reduction in activity which is described as "mild".<ref name="PMID:21777306">{{cite journal | author = Carruthers BM, van de Sande MI, De Meirleir KL, Klimas NG, Broderick G, Mitchell T, Staines D, Powles AC, Speight N, Vallings R, Bateman L, Baumgarten-Austrheim B, Bell DS, Carlo-Stella N, Chia J, Darragh A, Jo D, Lewis D, Light AR, Marshall-Gradisbik S, Mena I, Mikovits JA, Miwa K, Murovska M, Pall ML, Stevens S. | title = Myalgic encephalomyelitis: International Consensus Criteria. | journal = J Intern Med | volume = 270 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–38 | year = 2011 | month = October | pmid = 21777306 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02428.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02428.x/full}}</ref>

==National guidelines==
National guidelines, based upon some or all of the above diagnostic criteria, have been produced by several national bodies, for example in [[Australia]] in 2004<ref>[http://www.cfids-cab.org/MESA/AU_CFS.pdf Australian Guidelines (2004)]</ref> and in the United Kingdom in 2007.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales published a multidisciplinary [[clinical practice guideline]] in 2007 in which the following criteria are employed:<ref name=NICECG53>{{cite web | coauthors = Turnbull N, Shaw EJ, Baker R, Dunsdon S, Costin N, Britton G, Kuntze S and Norman R. © Royal College of General Practitioners | title = Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy):diagnosis and management of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy) in adults and children | work = | publisher = National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence | date = August 2007 | url = http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG53FullGuidance.pdf | format =pdf | page = | accessdate = 2009-05-25}}</ref>

* fatigue that is new, persistent and/or recurrent, not explained by other conditions and has resulted in a substantial reduction in activity level characterised by post-exertional malaise and/or fatigue (typically delayed, for example by at least 24 hours, with slow recovery over several days) ''and''
* one or more of the following list of symptoms: difficulty with sleeping, muscle and/or joint pain at multiple sites without evidence of inflammation, headaches, painful lymph nodes that are not pathologically enlarged, sore throat, cognitive dysfunction, worsening of symptoms by physical or mental exertion, general malaise, dizziness and/or nausea and palpitations with no identifiable heart problem.

The diagnosis should be reconsidered if none of the following symptoms remain: post-exertional fatigue or malaise, cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbance, chronic pain.<ref name=NICECG53/>

The guideline requires fatigue to have been present for 4 months in an adult or 3 months in a child. It expects a diagnosis in a child to be made by a pediatrician. The guideline states that a referral to a CFS/ME specialist should be offered immediately to the severely ill.<ref name=NICECG53/>

==Testing==
There is no generally accepted diagnostic test to reliably diagnose or exclude chronic fatigue syndrome.

The 1994 CDC criteria states diagnostic tests should be directed to confirm or exclude other causes for fatigue and other symptoms. Further tests may be individually necessary to identify underlying or contributing conditions that require treatment. The use of tests for diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome should only be done in the context of protocol-based research. The following routine tests are recommended:<ref name="CDC1994"/>
* [[Complete blood count]]
* Blood chemistry ([[electrolyte]]s, [[glucose]], [[renal function]], [[liver enzyme]]s, and protein levels).
* [[Thyroid function test]]s
* [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] (ESR)
* [[Urinalysis]] for blood cells, protein and glucose

The 2007 NICE guideline includes, in addition to panel recommended by the CDC, tests for [[C-reactive protein]] (a marker of inflammation), [[creatine kinase]] (a muscle-related enzyme), plasma [[viscosity]] (optional if ESR done) and [[serology]] for [[celiac disease]]. [[Ferritin]] determination may be performed in children and young people, and in adults only if other tests suggest iron deficiency. The guideline recommends clinical judgment in decisions to perform other tests in addition to the standard set. Testing for infections (e.g. Lyme disease, viral hepatitis, HIV, mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus) is only recommended if the patient gives a specific history for this. The NICE guideline discourages routine performance of the [[Tilt table test|head-up tilt test]], [[auditory brainstem response]] and [[Skin conductance|electrodermal conductivity]] for the purpose of diagnosis.<ref name=NICECG53/>

==Diagnostic complications and suggested improvements==
The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) in England and Wales states that none of the existing case definitions are based on robust evidence, and no studies have confirmed any case definition to be superior to others.<ref name=NICECG53pg114>{{Cite book | coauthors = Turnbull N, Shaw EJ, Baker R, Dunsdon S, Costin N, Britton G, Kuntze S and Norman R. © Royal College of General Practitioners | title = Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy):diagnosis and management of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy) in adults and children | work = | publisher = National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence | date = August 2007 | url = http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG53FullGuidance.pdf | pages = 114 | format =pdf | accessdate = 2009-05-25}}</ref>

===CDC 1994===
A 2003 international CFS study group for the CDC found ambiguities in the CDC 1994 CFS research case definition which contribute to inconsistent case identification.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reeves WC |title=Identification of ambiguities in the 1994 chronic fatigue syndrome research case definition and recommendations for resolution |journal=BMC Health Serv Res |volume=3 |pages=25 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14702202 |pmc=317472 |doi=10.1186/1472-6963-3-25 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/3/25 |author-separator=, |author2=Lloyd A |author3=Vernon SD |display-authors=3 |last4=Klimas |first4=Nancy |last5=Jason |first5=Leonard A |last6=Bleijenberg |first6=Gijs |last7=Evengard |first7=Birgitta |last8=White |first8=Peter D |last9=Nisenbaum |first9=Rosane}}</ref> Different self-reported causes of CFS are associated with significant differences in clinical measures and outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kennedy G, Abbot NC, Spence V, Underwood C, Belch JJ |title=The specificity of the CDC-1994 criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome: comparison of health status in three groups of patients who fulfill the criteria |journal=Ann Epidemiol |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=95–100 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=15018881 |doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2003.10.004 |url=}}</ref>
