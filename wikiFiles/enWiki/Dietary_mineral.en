'''Dietary minerals''' (also known as '''mineral nutrients''') are the [[chemical element]]s required by living [[organism]]s, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] present in common [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. 

Minerals in order of abundance in the human body include the seven major minerals [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], [[sulfur]], [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], and [[magnesium]]. Important "trace" or minor minerals, necessary for mammalian life, include [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[molybdenum]], [[iodine]], and [[selenium]] (see below for detailed discussion). 

Over twenty dietary minerals are necessary for mammals, and several more for various other types of life on Earth. The total number of minerals that are absolutely needed is not known for any organism. Ultratrace amounts of some minerals (e.g., [[boron]], [[chromium]]) are known to clearly have a role but the exact biochemical nature is unknown, and others (e.g. [[arsenic]], [[silicon]]) are suspected to have a role in health, but without proof. 

Most minerals that enter into the dietary [[physiology]] of organisms consist of simple compounds of [[chemical element]]s. Larger [[chemical compound|aggregates]] of [[mineral]]s need to be broken down for absorption. Plants absorb dissolved minerals in soils, which are subsequently picked up by the herbivores that eat them and so on, the minerals move up the food chain. Larger organisms may also consume soil ([[geophagia]]) and visit [[salt lick|mineral licks]] to obtain limiting mineral nutrients they are unable to acquire through other components of their diet.

Bacteria play an essential role in the weathering of primary minerals that results in the release of nutrients for their own nutrition and for the nutrition of others in the ecological [[food chain]]. One mineral, [[cobalt]], is available for use by animals only after having been processed into complicated molecules (e.g., [[vitamin B12]]), by bacteria. Scientists are only recently starting to appreciate the magnitude and role that [[microorganisms]] have in the global cycling and formation of [[Biomineralization|biological minerals]].

==Blood concentrations of dietary minerals==

Dietary minerals are present in a healthy human being's blood at certain mass and molar concentrations. The figure below presents the concentrations of each of the dietary minerals discussed in this article, from center-right to the right. Depending on the concentrations, some are in upper part of the picture, while others are in the lower part. The figure includes the relative values of other constituents of blood such as hormones.

==Dietary nutrition==
[[Dietitian]]s may recommend that dietary elements are best supplied by ingesting specific foods rich with the chemical element(s) of interest.  The elements may be naturally present in the food (e.g., calcium in dairy milk) or added to the food (e.g., orange juice [[Food fortification|fortified]] with calcium; [[iodised salt|iodized salt]], salt fortified with [[iodine]]).  [[Dietary supplement]]s can be formulated to contain several different chemical elements (as compounds), a combination of [[vitamin]]s and/or other chemical compounds, or a single element (as a compound or mixture of compounds), such as [[calcium]] (as carbonate, citrate, etc.) or [[magnesium]] (as oxide, etc.), [[chromium]] (usually as picolinate) or iron (as bis-glycinate).

The dietary focus on chemical elements derives from an interest in supporting the [[chemical reaction|biochemical reaction]]s of [[metabolism]] with the required elemental components.<ref name=lipp>{{Cite book

}}</ref> Appropriate intake levels of certain chemical elements have been demonstrated to be required to maintain optimal health.  Diet can meet all the body's chemical element requirements, although supplements can be used when some requirements (e.g., calcium, which is found mainly in dairy products) are not adequately met by the diet, or when chronic or acute deficiencies arise from pathology, injury, etc. Research has supported that altering inorganic mineral compounds (carbonates, oxides, etc.) by reacting them with organic ligands (amino acids, organic acids, etc.) improves the bioavailability of the supplemented mineral.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashmead|first=H. DeWayne|title=The Roles of Amino Acid Chelates in Animal Nutrition|year=1993|publisher=Noyes Publications|location=Westwood}}</ref>

==Other elements==
Many elements have been suggested as essential, but such claims have usually not been confirmed.  Definitive evidence for efficacy comes from the characterization of a biomolecule containing the element with an identifiable and testable function.  One problem with identifying efficacy is that some elements are innocuous at low concentrations and are pervasive (examples: silicon and nickel in solid and dust), so proof of efficacy is lacking because deficiencies are difficult to reproduce.<ref name=lipp/>

They absorb dissolved organic matter containing mineral nutrients as they scavenge through the dying individuals that fall out of large phytoplankton blooms. [[Flagellates]] are effective [[Bacterivore|bacteriovores]] and are also commonly found in the marine water column. The flagellates are preyed upon by [[plankton|zooplankton]] while the [[phytoplankton]] concentrates on the larger [[Particle (ecology)|particulate matter]] that is suspended in the water column as they are [[consumer|consumed]] by larger zooplankton, with fish as the [[top predator]]. Mineral nutrients cycle through this marine [[food chain]], from bacteria and phytoplankton to flagellates and zooplankton who are then eaten by fish. The bacteria are important in this chain because only they have the physiological ability to absorb the dissolved mineral nutrients from the sea. These recycling principals from marine environments apply to many soil and freshwater ecosystems as well.<ref name="Azam83">{{cite journal | last1=Azam | first1=F. | last2=Fenche | first2=T. | last3=Field | first3=J.
