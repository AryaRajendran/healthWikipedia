A '''route of administration''' in [[pharmacology]] and [[toxicology]] is the path by which a [[medication|drug]], fluid, poison, or other substance is taken into the body.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/route+of+administration TheFreeDictionary.com > route of administration] Citing: Jonas: Mosby's Dictionary of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. 2005, Elsevier.</ref> Routes of administration are generally classified by the location at which the substance is applied.  Common examples include oral and intravenous administration.  Routes can also be classified based on where the target of action is.  Action may be topical (local), enteral (system-wide effect, but delivered through the [[gastrointestinal tract]]), or parenteral (systemic action, but delivered by routes other than the GI tract).

==Classification==
Routes of administration are usually classified by application location (or exposition). The route or course the active substance takes from application location to the location where it has its target effect is usually rather a matter of [[pharmacokinetics]] (concerning the processes of uptake, distribution, and elimination of drugs). Nevertheless, some routes, especially the [[transdermal]] or [[transmucosal]] routes, are commonly referred to ''routes of administration''. The location of the target effect of active substances are usually rather a matter of [[pharmacodynamics]] (concerning e.g. the physiological effects of drugs<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lees P, Cunningham FM, Elliott J |title=Principles of pharmacodynamics and their applications in veterinary pharmacology |journal=J. Vet. Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=397–414 |year=2004 |pmid=15601436 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2885.2004.00620.x}}</ref>). Furthermore, there is also a classification of routes of administration that basically distinguishes whether the effect is local (in "topical" administration) or systemic (in "enteral" or "parenteral" administration).

===Application location===

====Gastrointestinal/enteral====
Administration through the [[gastrointestinal tract]] is sometimes termed ''enteral or enteric administration'' (literally meaning 'through the [[intestines]]'). ''Enteral/enteric administration'' usually includes ''[[oral administration|oral]]''<ref name="url195_20-1-3.1.htm"/> (through the [[mouth]]) and ''[[Rectal (medicine)|rectal]]'' (into the [[rectum]])<ref name="url195_20-1-3.1.htm">{{cite web |url=http://www.oar.state.ok.us/viewhtml/195_20-1-3.1.htm |title=Oklahoma Administrative Code and Register > 195:20-1-3.1. Pediatric conscious sedation utilizing enteral methods (oral, rectal, sublingual) |work= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref> administration, in the sense that these are taken up by the intestines. However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the [[stomach]], and as such ''gastrointestinal'' (along the [[gastrointestinal tract]]) may be a more fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as ''enteral'', such as [[sublingual administration|sublingual]]<ref name="url195_20-1-3.1.htm"/> (under the tongue) and [[sublabial administration|sublabial]] or buccal (between the cheek and gums/[[gingiva]]), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly enteral administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for systemic administration, as well as local (sometimes termed [[topical]]), such as in a contrast [[enema]], whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term enteral is reserved for substances with systemic effects.

Many drugs as [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], or drops are taken orally. Administration methods directly into the stomach include those by [[gastric feeding tube]] or [[gastrostomy]]. Substances may also be placed into the [[small intestine]]s, as with a [[duodenal]] feeding tube and [[enteral nutrition]].Some enteric coated tablets will not dissolve in stomach but it is directed to the intestine because the drug present in the enteric coated tablet causes irritation in the stomach.

====Central nervous system====
*[[epidural]] (synonym: peridural) (injection or infusion into the [[epidural space]]), e.g. epidural anesthesia
*[[intracerebral]] (into the cerebrum) direct injection into the brain. Used in experimental research of chemicals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neurotransmitter.net/mdmametabolites.html |title=MDMA (ecstasy) metabolites and neurotoxicity: No occurrence of MDMA neurotoxicity from metabolites when injected directly into brain, study shows |publisher=Neurotransmitter.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref> and as a treatment for malignancies of the brain.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1028604 |title=A potential application for the intracerebral injection of drugs entrapped within liposomes in the treatment of human cerebral gliomas |publisher=Pubmedcentral.nih.gov |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref> The intracerebral route can also interrupt the blood brain barrier from holding up against subsequent routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g26l42336v161173/ |title=Blood–brain barrier changes following intracerebral injection of human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α in the rat |publisher=Springerlink.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref>
*[[intracerebroventricular]] (into the cerebral ventricles) administration into the ventricular system of the brain. One use is as a last line of opioid treatment for terminal cancer patients with intractable [[cancer pain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/content/full/89/5/1209 |title=Acute Decreases in Cerebrospinal Fluid Glutathione Levels after Intracerebroventricular Morphine for Cancer Pain |publisher=Anesthesia-analgesia.org |date=1999-06-22 |accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref>

====Other locations====
*epicutaneous or topical (application onto the skin). It can be used both for local effect as in allergy testing and typical [[local anesthesia]], as well as [[:wikt:systemic|systemic]] effects when the active substance diffuses through skin in a [[transdermal]] route.
*[[intradermal]], (into the skin itself) is used for [[skin testing]] some [[allergens]], and also for [[mantoux test]] for Tuberculosis
*[[Subcutaneous administration|subcutaneous]] (under the skin), e.g. [[insulin]]. [[Skin popping]] is a slang term that includes this method of administration, and is usually used in association with [[recreational drugs]].
*[[human nose|nasal]] administration (through the nose) can be used for topically acting substances, as well as for [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] of e.g. [[decongestant]] nasal sprays to be taken up along the [[respiratory tract]]. Such substances are also called ''inhalational'', e.g. [[inhalational anesthetics]].
*[[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (into a [[vein]]), e.g. many drugs, [[Parenteral nutrition|total parenteral nutrition]]
*intraarterial (into an [[artery]]), e.g. [[vasodilator]] drugs in the treatment of [[vasospasm]] and [[thrombolytic drug]]s for treatment of [[embolism]]
*[[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] (into a [[muscle]]), e.g. many [[vaccine]]s, antibiotics, and long-term psychoactive agents. Recreationally the colloquial term 'muscling' is used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fenwayhealth.org/site/PageServer?pagename=CM_efc_effects |title=Fenway Community Health |publisher=[[Fenway Health]] |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}</ref>
*[[intracardiac]] (into the heart), e.g. [[adrenaline]] during [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (no longer commonly performed)
*[[intraosseous infusion]] (into the [[bone]] marrow) is, in effect, an indirect intravenous access because the bone marrow drains directly into the venous system. This route is occasionally used for drugs and fluids in emergency medicine and pediatrics when intravenous access is difficult.
*[[intrathecal]] (into the spinal canal) is most commonly used for spinal [[anesthesia]] and [[chemotherapy]]
*[[intraperitoneal injection|intraperitoneal]], (infusion or injection into the [[peritoneum]]) e.g. [[peritoneal dialysis]]
*[[urinary bladder|Intravesical]] infusion is into the urinary bladder.
*[[intravitreal]], through the eye
*[[Intracavernous injection]], an injection into the base of the [[penis]]
*[[Intravaginal administration]], in the [[vagina]]
*Intrauterine
** [[Extra-amniotic administration]], between the [[endometrium]] and [[fetal membranes]]
*[[Transdermal technology|transdermal]] (diffusion through the intact skin for systemic rather than topical distribution), e.g. [[transdermal patch]]es such as [[fentanyl]] in pain therapy, [[nicotine]] patches for treatment of [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] and [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerine]] for treatment of [[angina pectoris]].
*[[Transmucosal]] (diffusion through a mucous membrane), e.g. [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (snorting) of [[cocaine]], [[sublingual]], i.e. under the tongue, [[Sublabial route of administration|sublabial]], i.e. between the lips and [[gingiva]], [[nitroglycerine]], vaginal suppositories

===Local or systemic effect===
Routes of administration can also basically be classified whether the effect is local (in topical administration) or systemic (in enteral or parenteral administration):
*''[[topical]]'': local effect, substance is applied directly where its action is desired.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/netdict/topical Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary > topical]. Retrieved April 26, 2010.</ref> Sometimes, however, the term ''topical'' is defined as applied to a localized area of the body or to the surface of a body part,<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/topical thefreedictionary.com > topical] Citing: The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000</ref> without necessarily involving target effect of the substance, making the classification rather a variant of the classification based on application location.
*''[[enteral]]'': desired effect is systemic (non-local), substance is given via the [[digestive tract]].
*''[[parenteral]]'': desired effect is systemic, substance is given by routes other than the digestive tract.

====Topical====
*epicutaneous (application onto the skin), e.g. allergy testing, typical [[local anesthesia]]
*inhalational, e.g. [[asthma]] medications
*[[enema]], e.g. contrast media for imaging of the bowel
*eye drops (onto the [[conjunctiva]]), e.g. [[antibiotic]]s for conjunctivitis
*ear drops - such as antibiotics and [[corticosteroids]] for [[otitis externa]]
* through mucous membranes in the body

====Enteral====<!-- This section is linked from [[Ciprofloxacin]] -->
In this classification system, enteral administration is administration that involves any part of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and has [[systemic administration|systemic]] effects:
*by [[mouth]] (orally), many drugs as [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], or drops
*by [[gastric feeding tube]], [[duodenal]] feeding tube, or [[gastrostomy]], many drugs and [[enteral nutrition]]
*[[rectum|rectally]], various drugs in [[suppository]]

====Parenteral====
*[[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (into a [[vein]]), e.g. many drugs, [[Parenteral nutrition|total parenteral nutrition]]
*intra-arterial (into an [[artery]]), e.g. [[vasodilator]] drugs in the treatment of [[vasospasm]] and [[thrombolytic drug]]s for treatment of [[embolism]]
*[[intraosseous infusion]] (into the [[bone]] marrow) is, in effect, an indirect intravenous access because the bone marrow drains directly into the venous system. This route is occasionally used for drugs and fluids in emergency medicine and pediatrics when intravenous access is difficult.
*intra-muscular
*intracerebral (into the brain [[parenchyma]])
*intracerebroventricular (into cerebral ventricular system) 
*[[intrathecal]] (an [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] into the spinal canal)
*subcutaneous (under the skin)<ref>{{cite book|last=Malenka|first=Eric J. Nestler, Steven E. Hyman, Robert C.|title=Molecular neuropharmacology : a foundation for clinical neuroscience|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-148127-4|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref>

== Choice of Route of Administration ==
The options are limited by the available forms of any given drug.  Still, there are advantages and disadvantages to consider with any route of administration.

===Oral===
The oral route is generally the most convenient and carries the lowest cost.<ref name="Nursing Times"/> However, some drugs can cause [[gastrointestinal tract]] irritation.<ref name=DDS>{{cite web |url= http://www.ct.gov/dds/lib/dds/edsupp/medadmin_recert_part_ii.pdf |title=DDS Medication Administration Recertification Manual |date= 2006|work=DDS Recertification Review Manual |publisher= State of Connecticut Department of Developmental Services |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> For drugs that come in [[delayed release]] or [[Time Release Capsule|time-release]] formulations, breaking the tablets or capsules can lead to more rapid delivery of the drug than intended.<ref name="Nursing Times"/>

===Topical===
By delivering drugs almost directly to the site of action, the risk of systemic [[adverse effect|side effects]] is reduced.<ref name="Nursing Times"/> However, skin irritation may result, and for some forms such as creams or lotions, the dosage is difficult to control .<ref name=DDS/>

===Inhalation===
Inhaled medications can be absorbed quickly, and act both locally and systemically.<ref name=DDS/> Proper technique with [[inhaler]] devices is necessary to achieve the correct dose. Some medications can have an unpleasant taste or irritate the mouth.<ref name=DDS/>
 
Inhalation by smoking a substance is likely the most rapid way to deliver drugs to the brain, as the substance travels directly to the brain without being diluted in the systemic circulation.<ref name=Quinn>{{cite journal |author=Quinn DI Wodak A Day RO |year=1997 |title= Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Principles of Illicit Drug Use and Treatment of Illicit Drug Users |journal=Clinical Pharmacokinetics |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=344-400 |publisher=Springer}}</ref> The severity of dependence on [[psychoactive drug]]s tends to increase with more rapid drug delivery.<ref name=Quinn/>

===Injection===
The term injection encompasses [[intravenous]] (IV), [[intramuscular]] (IM), and [[subcutaneous]] (SC) administration. <ref>http://www.ismp.org/Tools/errorproneabbreviations.pdf</ref>

Injections act rapidly, with onset of action in 15-30 seconds for IV, 10-20 minutes for IM, and 15-30 minutes for SC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/ems/guidelines/docs/A2.08.03.pdf |title=Routes for Drug Administration |date=2003 |work=Emergency Treatment Guidelines Appendix |publisher= Manitoba Health |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> They also have essentially 100% [[bioavailability]], and can be used for drugs that are poorly absorbed or ineffective when given orally.<ref name="Nursing Times">{{cite web |url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/clinical-zones/prescribing/the-administration-of-medicines/288560.article |title=The Administration of Medicines |date=2007 |work=Nursing Practice Clinical Zones: Prescribing |publisher=NursingTimes.net |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> Some medications, such as certain [[antipsychotic]]s, can be administered as [[depot injection|long-acting intramuscular injections]].<ref>Stahl SM, Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific basis and practical applications, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008</ref> Ongoing [[IV infusion]]s can be used to deliver continuous medication or [[IV fluid|fluids]].<ref>Smeltzer SC Bare BG, Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 9th ed, Philadelphia: Lippincott, 2000</ref>

Disadvantages of injections include potential pain or discomfort for the patient, and the requirement of trained staff using [[aseptic technique]]s for administration.<ref name="Nursing Times"/> However, in some cases patients are taught to self-inject, such as SC injection of insulin in patients with [[insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus]]. As the drug is delivered to the site of action extremely rapidly with IV injection, there is a risk of [[drug overdose|overdose]] if the dose has been calculated incorrectly, and there is an increased risk of side effects if the drug is administered too rapidly.<ref name="Nursing Times"/>

==Uses==
*Some routes can be used for topical as well as systemic purposes, depending on the circumstance. For example, inhalation of asthma drugs is targeted at the airways (topical effect), whereas inhalation of [[general anaesthetic|volatile anesthetics]] is targeted at the brain (systemic effect).

*On the other hand, identical drugs can produce different results depending on the route of administration. For example, some drugs are not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract and their action after enteral administration is therefore different from that after parenteral administration. This can be illustrated by the action of [[naloxone]] (Narcan), an antagonist of [[opiate]]s such as [[morphine]]. Naloxone counteracts opiate action in the [[central nervous system]] when given intravenously and is therefore used in the treatment of opiate overdose. The same drug, when swallowed, acts exclusively on the bowels; it is here used to treat constipation under opiate pain therapy and does not affect the pain-reducing effect of the opiate.

*Enteral routes are generally the most convenient for the patient, as no punctures or [[sterile technique|sterile]] procedures are necessary. Enteral medications are therefore often preferred in the treatment of chronic disease. However, some drugs can not be used enterally because their absorption in the digestive tract is low or unpredictable. Transdermal administration is a comfortable alternative; there are, however, only a few drug preparations that are suitable for transdermal administration.

*In acute situations, in [[emergency medicine]] and [[intensive care medicine]], drugs are most often given intravenously. This is the most reliable route, as in acutely ill patients the absorption of substances from the tissues and from the digestive tract can often be unpredictable due to altered blood flow or bowel motility.
