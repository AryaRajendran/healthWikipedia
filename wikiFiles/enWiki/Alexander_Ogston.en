Sir '''Alexander Ogston''' [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs"/> [[Master of Surgery|CM]] [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[surgeon]], famous for his discovery of ''[[Staphylococcus]]''. He was born in [[Aberdeen]] in 1844 and died there in 1929.<ref name="smith">{{cite doi|10.1002/bjs.1800521203 }}</ref> He was the eldest son of Prof. [[Francis Ogston]] (1803–1887), Professor of Medical Jurisprudence at the University of Aberdeen.<ref name='Johnston 1899'>{{cite book | last1 = Johnston | first1 = William | title = Some account of the last bajans of King's and Marischal Colleges, MDCCCLIX-LX: and of those who joined their class in the University of Aberdeen during the semi, tertian and magistrand sessions MDCCCLX-LXIII | publisher = Privately printed by Her Majesty's Printers at the Adelphi Press | year = 1899 | pages = 42 | url = http://books.google.com/ebooks/reader?id=migBAAAAYAAJ | accessdate = 2012-01-03}}</ref>

==University of Aberdeen==
Ogston began his medical training at [[Marischal College]] in 1862 and graduated in 1865 with honours in [[medicine]] and [[surgery]] at the age of 21.
<ref name=" PMID18952323 ">{{cite journal |author=Newsom S. W. |title=Ogston’s coccus |journal=J. Hops. Infect.|volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=368–372|year=2008 |month=Dec|url=http://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(08)00396-4/abstract|PMID= 18952323 |accessdate=01-11-2012}}</ref>
He obtained his MD a year later in 1866. He was appointed as a full surgeon to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in 1874.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  He was Assistant [[Professor]] of [[Medical Jurisprudence]] and [[Materia Medica]], Lecturer in [[Ophthalmology]] and [[Anaesthetist]] before being appointed as [[Regius Professor of Surgery (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Surgery]] in 1882.<ref name="JAmAcadDermatol-lyell-1989">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0190-9622(89)70035-9 }}</ref> He is credited with the  introduction of  [[carbolic acid|carbolic spray]] to Aberdeen.<ref name="ScottMedJ-pennington-1988">{{cite pmid|3291113 }}</ref>

==''Staphylococcus''==
Ogsten was reported to have called on Joseph Lister and rigorously followed his antiseptic principals.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  These are aptly phrased in a small ditty composed by his students. 
[[Image:Staphylococcus aureus, 50,000x, USDA, ARS, EMU.jpg|thumb|[[Transmission electron microscopy|Transmission electron micrograph]] of ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]

The spray, the spray, the antiseptic spray<br>
A.O. would shower it morning, night and day<br>
For every sort of scratch<br>
Where others would attach<br> 
A sticking plaster patch<br>
He gave the spray.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>

Ogsten followed the work of other contemporaries such as Koch, J.C. Ewart from Edinburgh (published on different types of bacteria), and Kohler from Berne (who found bacteria in cases of osteomyelitis and ‘strumitis’.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/><br>
Following his examination of the organisms from the abscess of James Davidson, Ogsten used the shed behind his house as a laboratory (receiving a grant (£50) from the British Medical Association (BMA), with which he purchased a Zeiss microscope and the methyl-aniline dye used by Koch) to continue his research.<br>
Following Kochs postulates and staining methods, Ogsten set about isolating the causative organism of Davidson’s wound.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  By experiment Ogston concluded that the optimal conditions for cultivation of this organism were hen’s egg medium grown in small bottles shielded from contamination by glass ‘shades.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  Using samples from 82 abscesses, Ogsten successfully isolated bacteria from 65 samples, the others being referred to as “cold”.  He was then able to transfer pure colonies to guinea-pigs, white mice or wild mice.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  
Ogsten soon realized there were ‘”two forms of micrococcus: one in the form of chains or necklaces to which the name ‘streptococcus’ had been given and produced the more violent inflammation, and the other growing in masses or clusters [like the roe of a fish], to which I gave the name ‘staphylococcus’ which cause a less violent inflammatory disease’.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  He also noted that a transferring a 1/146 016 000 dilution of the original pus sample could induce abscesses in new subjects.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  Ogsten demonstrated that these bacteria could be killed by heat or  carbolic acid, fulfilling Kochs postulates.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  He also noted that “ micrococci so deleterious when injected” were seemingly “harmless on the surface of wounds and ulcers”.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/> An observation of the existence of some staphylococci as part of the normal flora.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>

Ogsten encountered a great deal of difficulty convincing the medical establishment of his observations on Staphylococcus.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  
The Aberdeen branch of the BMA, received his findings with disbelief.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/> The editor of the British Medical Journal stated  at the time ‘can anything good come out of Aberdeen’.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  After a careful study of the evidence presented by Ogsten, his contemporary, Joseph Lister agreed with his findings however, another peer, Watson Cheyne was still skeptical.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>
Given this local skeptisim, Ogsten decided to present his discoveries to a surgical congress in Berlin where he had previously presented a paper “genu valgum” on 9 April 1880.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>
Ogsten delivered this presentation on absesses in German which was then published. He was subsequently made a ‘Fellow’ of the German Surgical Society despite his youth (36 years old).<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/> 
The next year Ogsten published his observations in the British Medical Journal.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>  After this point his papers were refused and instead he published in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology.<ref name=" PMID18952323 "/>

==Military career==
Ogston served in the 1884 [[Egyptian War]] and the [[Boer War]]. He was also instrumental in arguing for the creation of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in 1898. During the [[First World War]] when over seventy years old, he was sent to assist with the management of severe trauma.<ref name="ScotMedJ-adam-1998">{{cite pmid|9854306 }}</ref>

==Royal acknowledgement==
In 1892, [[Queen Victoria]] appointed him Surgeon in Ordinary, a post he also held under [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. He was appointed ''[[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]]'' in 1912.

==Legacy==
The Surgical Society of the [[University of Aberdeen]] is named the "Ogston Society" in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Ogston Society|title=Sir Alexander Ogston|url=http://www.ogston.org.uk}}</ref> The University Department of Surgery also awards an annual prize in his honour to the best student in surgery.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=University of Aberdeen|title=Endowed Prizes and Medals|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/prizes.shtml|accessdate=2007-02-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070322231014/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/prizes.shtml| archivedate= 22 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
