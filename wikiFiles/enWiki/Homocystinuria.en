}} '''Classical Homocystinuria''', also known as '''cystathionine beta synthase deficiency''' or '''CBS deficiency''',<ref name=omim>{{OMIM|236200}}</ref> is an inherited disorder of the [[metabolism]] of the [[amino acid]] [[methionine]], often involving [[cystathionine beta synthase]]. It is an inherited [[autosomal recessive trait]], which means a child needs to inherit a copy of the defective gene from both parents to be affected.

==Presentation==
This defect leads to a multisystemic disorder of the [[connective tissue]], [[muscle]]s, [[Central nervous system|CNS]], and [[cardiovascular system]]. Homocystinuria represents a group of hereditary [[metabolic disorder]]s characterized by an accumulation of [[homocysteine]] in the [[blood plasma|serum]] and an increased excretion of homocysteine in the [[urine]]. Infants appear to be normal and early symptoms, if any are present, are vague.

==Laboratory Diagnosis==
The term homocystinuria describes an increased excretion of the [[thiol]] [[amino acid]] [[homocystine]] in urine (and incidentally, also an increased concentration in [[blood plasma|plasma]]). The source of this increase may be one of many metabolic factors, only one of which is CBS deficiency. Others include the re-methylation defects (cobalamin defects, methionine sythase deficiency, [[MTHFR]]) and vitamin deficiencies ([[cobalamin]] (vitamin B12) deficiency, [[folate]] (vitamin B9) deficiency, [[riboflavin]] deficiency (vitamin B2), [[pyridoxal phosphate]] deficiency (vitamin B6)). In light of this information, a combined approach to laboratory diagnosis is required to reach a differential diagnosis.

CBS deficiency may be diagnosed by routine metabolic biochemistry. In the first instance plasma or urine amino acid analysis will frequently show an elevation of [[methionine]] and the presence of homocystine. In fact many neonatal screening programs include methionine as a metabolite. The disorder may be distinguished from the re-methylation defects (e.g. MTHFR, methionine synthase deficiency and the cobalamin defects) in lieu of the elevated methionine concentration and perhaps the presence of [[cystathionine]].<ref>{{cite book|last=(eds.)|first=N.

Scott|title=Facts and Recommendations about Total Homocysteine Determinations: An Expert Opinion|journal=Clinical Chemistry|year=2004|volume=50|issue=1|pages=3–32|pmid=14709635}}</ref>

The laboatory analysis of homocystine itself is complicated by the fact that most homocystine (possibly >85%) is bound to other thiol amino acids and proteins in the form of [[disulphides]] (e.g. [[cysteine]] in cystine-homocystine, [[homocysteine]] in homocystine-homocystine) via [[disulphide bonds]]. Since as an equilibrium process the proportion of free homocystine is variable a true value of total homocysteine (free + bound) is useful for confirming diagnosis and particularly for monitoring of treatment efficacy. To this end it is prudent to perform total homocyst(e)ine analysis in which all disulphide bonds are [[redox|reduction]] prior to analysis, traditionally by [[HPLC]] after [[derivatisation]] with a fluorescent agent, thus giving a true reflection of the quantity of homocysteine in a plasma sample.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carducci|first=Claudia|coauthors=M.

==Mortality/morbidity==
The life expectancy of patients with homocystinuria is reduced only if untreated. It is known that before the age of 30, almost one fourth of patients die as a result of thrombotic complications (e.g. [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]).

==Treatment==
No specific cure has been discovered for homocystinuria; however, many people are treated using high doses of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (also known as [[pyridoxine]]).<ref name=vit>{{cite pmid|9259028}}</ref> Slightly less than 50% respond to this treatment and need to intake supplemental vitamin B<sub>6</sub> for the rest of their lives. Those who do not respond require a low [[methionine]] diet, and most will need treatment with [[trimethylglycine]]. A normal dose of [[folic acid]] supplement and occasionally adding [[cysteine]] to the diet can be helpful.

Betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) is used to reduce concentrations of homocysteine by promoting the conversion of homocysteine  back to methionine, i.e. increasing flux through the re-methylation pathway. The re-formed methionine is then gradually removed by incorporation into body protein.  The methionine that is not converted into protein is converted to S-adenosyl-methionine which goes on to form homocysteine again. Betaine is, therefore, only effective if the quantity of methionine to be removed is small. Hence treatment includes both betaine and a diet low in methionine. In classical homocystinuria (CBS, or cystathione beta synthase deficiency) the plasma methionine usually increases above the normal range of 30 micromoles/L and the concentrations should be monitored as potentially toxic levels (more than 400 micromole/l) may be reached.

===Recommended diet===
Low-protein food is recommended for this disorder, which requires food products low in particular types of amino-acid (e.g. methionine).
