'''Nocturnal enuresis''' or '''nighttime urinary incontinence''', commonly called '''bedwetting''', or "'sleepwetting'" is [[urinary incontinence|involuntary urination]] while [[sleep|asleep]] after the age at which [[bladder]] control usually occurs.  Nocturnal enuresis is considered ''primary'' (PNE) when a child has not yet had a prolonged period of being dry. ''Secondary'' nocturnal enuresis (SNE) is when a child or adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry.

Bedwetting is the most common childhood urologic complaint <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s13c09.html | title = Case Based Pediatrics For Medical Students and Residents | accessdate = 2010-05-28 | last = Reynoso Paredes, MD | first = Potenciano | publisher = Department of Pediatrics, University of Hawaii John A.

Only a small percentage (5% to 10%) of bedwetting cases are caused by specific medical situations.<ref name="johnson">{{cite web|url=http://www.duj.com/Johnson.html|title=Nocturnal Enuresis|publisher=www.duj.com|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=Johnson|first=Mary |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080122063339/http://www.duj.com/Johnson.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-22}}</ref> Bedwetting is frequently associated with a [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of the condition.<ref>{{cite web| title = Bedwetting| publisher = The Royal Childrens Hospital Melbourne| url = http://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/factsheets.cfm?doc_id=3716| accessdate = 2009-10-20}}</ref>

Most girls can stay dry by age six and most boys stay dry by age seven. By ten years old, 95% of children are dry at night. Studies place adult bedwetting rates at between 0.5% to 2.3%.<ref name="Pediatrics">{{cite web|url=http://www.pediatriceducation.org/2005/04/04|title=Pediatrics | Paediatrics | Pediatric Education | Paediatric Education - PediatricEducation.org|publisher=www.pediatriceducation.org|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref> 

Treatments range from [[Behaviour therapy|behavioral-based]] options such as [[bedwetting alarm]]s, to medication such as hormone replacement, and even surgery such as urethral enlargement. Since most bedwetting is simply a developmental delay, most treatment plans aim to protect or improve [[self-esteem]].<ref name="johnson" /> Bedwetting children and adults can suffer emotional stress or psychological injury if they feel shamed by the condition. Treatment guidelines recommend that the physician counsel the parents, warning about psychological damage caused by pressure, shaming, or punishment for a condition children cannot control.<ref name="johnson" />

==Normal processes of staying dry==
Two physical functions prevent bedwetting. The first is a [[hormone]] that reduces [[urine]] production at night. The second is the ability to wake up when the [[bladder]] is full. Children usually achieve nighttime dryness by developing one or both of these abilities. There appear to be some [[hereditary]] factors in how and when these develop. 

The first ability is a [[hormone]] cycle that reduces the body's urine production. At about sunset each day, the body releases a minute burst of [[vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]] (also known as arginine vasopressin or AVP). This hormone burst reduces the [[kidney]]'s urine output well into the night so that the bladder does not get full until morning. This hormone cycle is not present at birth. Many children develop it between the ages of two and six years old, others between six and the end of [[puberty]], and some not at all.

The second ability that helps people stay dry is waking when the bladder is full. This ability develops in the same age range as the vasopressin hormone, but is separate from that hormone cycle.

The typical development process begins with one- and two-year-old children developing larger bladders and beginning to sense bladder fullness. Two- and three-year-old children begin to stay dry during the day. Four- and five-year-olds develop an adult pattern of urinary control and begin to stay dry at night.<ref name="johnson" />

==Frequency of bedwetting (epidemiology)==
Most girls can stay dry at night by age six and most boys stay dry by age seven. Boys are three times more likely to wet the bed than girls.<ref name="Pediatrics" /><ref>Miller  K.  Concomitant nonpharmacologic therapy in the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis.  Clin Pediatr [Phila].  1993;July(spec. no.):32–7.</ref>

Doctors frequently consider bedwetting as a self-limiting problem, since most children will outgrow it. Children 5 to 9 years old have a spontaneous cure rate of 14% per year. Adolescents 10 to 18 years old have a spontaneous cure rate of 16% per year.<ref name="BJU">{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1464-410X.2002.03030.x|title=Nocturnal enuresis in the adolescent: a neglected problem|publisher=British Journal of Urology|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref> 

Approximate bedwetting rates are:
* Age 5:  20%
* Age 6:  10–15%
* Age 7:  7%
* Age 10: 5%
* Age 15: 1–2%
* Age 18–64: 0.5–1%<ref name="Pediatrics" />

As can be seen from the numbers above, a portion of bedwetting children will not outgrow the problem. Adult rates of bedwetting show little change due to spontaneous cure. Persons who are still enuretic at age 18 are likely to deal with bedwetting throughout their lives.<ref name="BJU" /> 

Studies of bedwetting in adults have found varying rates. The most quoted study in this area was done in the Netherlands. It found a 0.5% rate for 18- to 64-year-olds. A Hong Kong study, however, found a much higher rate. The Hong Kong researchers found a bedwetting rate of 2.3% in 16- to 40-year-olds.<ref name="BJU" />

==Medical definitions: primary vs. secondary enuresis==
The medical name for bedwetting is ''nocturnal enuresis''. The condition is divided into two types: '''''primary''''' nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and '''''secondary''''' nocturnal enuresis.

=== Primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) ===
Primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is the most common form of bedwetting. Bedwetting counts as a disorder once a child is old enough to stay dry, but continues either to average at least two wet nights a week with no long periods of dryness or to not sleep dry without being taken to the toilet by another person.

Medical guidelines vary on when a child is old enough to stay dry. Common medical definitions allow doctors to diagnose PNE beginning at between 4 to 5 years old. This type of classification is frequently used by insurance companies. It defines PNE as, "persistent bedwetting in the absence of any urologic, medical or neurological anomaly in a child beyond the age when over 75% of children are normally dry."<ref name="PedEd">{{cite web|url=http://www.pediatriceducation.org/2005/04/04|title=What is the Most Effective Treatment for Primary Nocturnal Enuresis?|publisher=www.pediatriceducation.org|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref> 

Some researchers, however, recommend a different starting age range. This guidance says that bedwetting can be considered a clinical problem if the child regularly wets the bed after turning seven years old.<ref name="ifas">{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/HE794|title=Bedwetting|publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=Evans and Radunovich|first=}}</ref> D'Alessandro refines this to bedwetting more than twice a month after six years old for girls and seven years old for boys.<ref name="PedEd" />

=== Secondary nocturnal enuresis ===
Secondary enuresis occurs ''after'' a patient goes through an extended period of dryness at night (roughly six months or more) and then ''reverts'' to nighttime wetting. Secondary enuresis can be caused by emotional stress or a medical condition, such as a bladder infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pedclerk.bsd.uchicago.edu/enuresis.html|title=Enuresis|publisher=University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref>

=== U.S. psychological definition ===
Psychologists may use a definition from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSM-IV]], defining nocturnal enuresis as repeated urination into bed or clothes, occurring twice per week for at least three consecutive months in a child of at least 5 years of age and not due to either a drug [[Adverse drug reaction|side effect]] or a [[medical condition]]. Even if the case does not meet these criteria, the DSM-IV definition allows psychologists to diagnose nocturnal enuresis if the wetting causes the patient clinically significant distress.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jpepsy.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/4/193#SEC1|title=Empirically Supported Treatments in Pediatric Psychology: Nocturnal Enuresis |journal=Journal of Pediatric Psychology|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=Mellon and McGrath|first=}}</ref>

==Causes of and increased risks for bedwetting==
The following list summarizes bedwetting's known causes and risk factors. Enuretic patients frequently have more than one cause or risk factor from the items listed below.<ref name="PedEd" />

=== Most common causes ===
Most cases of bedwetting are [[Bedwetting#Primary Enuresis|PNE-type]], which has two related most common causes

* '''Neurological-developmental delay'''<br /> This is the most common cause of bedwetting. Most bedwetting children are simply delayed in developing the ability to stay dry and have no other developmental issues.<ref name="PedEd" /> Studies suggest that bedwetting may be due to a nervous system that is slow to process the feeling of a full bladder.<ref name="drynites.co.nz">{{cite web|url=http://www.drynites.co.nz/enuresis|title=Enuresis and Information and Advice For Children With Bedwetting Problems|publisher=DryNites, Kimberly Clark Inc.|accessdate=2010-12-02|last=|first=}}</ref>

* '''Genetics'''<br /> Bedwetting has a strong genetic component. Children whose parents were not enuretic have only a 15% incidence of bedwetting. When one or both parents were bedwetters, the rates jump to 44% and 77% respectively.<ref name="pracparm">{{cite web|url=http://www.aacap.org/galleries/PracticeParameters/Enuresis.pdf|format=PDF|title=Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Enuresis|publisher=J . AM. ACAD. CHILD ADOLESC. PSYCHIATRY|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref> Genetic research shows that bedwetting is associated with the genes on chromosomes 13q and 12q (possibly 5 and 22 also).<ref name="PedEd" />

These first two items are the most common factors in bedwetting, but current medical technology offers no easy testing for either cause. There is no test to prove that bedwetting is only a developmental delay, and genetic testing offers little or no benefit. 

As a result, doctors work to rule out other causes. The following causes are less common, but are easier to prove and more clearly treated:

* '''Alcohol consumption'''<br /> Drinking [[Ethanol|alcohol]] increases [[urine]] production.
* '''Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)'''<br />  Children with [[ADHD]] are 2.7 times more likely to have bedwetting issues.<ref name="cks.library.nhs.uk" />
* '''Caffeine'''<br /> [[Caffeine]] increases [[urine]] production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003144.htm|title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Urination - bed wetting|publisher=www.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref>
* '''Constipation'''<br /> Chronic [[constipation]] can cause bedwetting. When the [[bowels]] are full, it can put pressure on the [[bladder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s13c09.html|title=Case Based Pediatrics For Medical Students and Residents|publisher=Department of Pediatrics, University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=Reynoso Paredes|first=Potenciano }}</ref>
* '''Infection/disease'''<br /> Infections and disease are more strongly connected with [[Nocturnal enuresis#Medical definitions: primary vs. secondary enuresis|''secondary'' nocturnal enuresis]] and with [[Daytime wetting|'''''daytime''''' wetting]]. Less than 5% of all bedwetting cases are caused by infection or disease, the most common of which is a [[urinary tract infection]].<ref name="cks.library.nhs.uk">{{cite web|url=http://cks.library.nhs.uk/enuresis_nocturnal/in_depth/background_information|title=CKS: Enuresis — nocturnal - In depth - Background information|publisher=National Library for Health, National Health Service|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref>
* '''Insufficient anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) production'''<br /> A portion of bedwetting children do not produce enough of the [[anti-diuretic hormone]]. As explained above, the body normally increases ADH levels at night, signalling the kidneys to produce less urine. The diurnal change may not be seen until about age 10.<ref name="PedEd" />
* '''More severe neurological-developmental issues'''<br /> Patients with intellectual disabilities have a higher rate of bedwetting problems. One study of seven-year-olds showed that "handicapped and [[mentally retarded]] children" had a bedwetting rate almost three times higher than "non-handicapped children" (26.6% vs. 9.5%, respectively).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Järvelin MR, Vikeväinen-Tervonen L, Moilanen I, Huttunen NP |title=Enuresis in seven-year-old children |journal=Acta Paediatr Scand |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=148–53 |year=1988 |month=January |pmid=3369293 |doi= 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1988.tb10614.x|url= |accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref>
* '''Physical abnormalities'''<br /> Less than 10% of enuretics have [[urinary tract]] abnormalities, such as a smaller than normal [[bladder]]. Current data does support increased bladder tone in some enuretics, which functionally would decrease bladder capacity.<ref name="PedEd" />
* '''Psychological'''<br /> Psychological issues (e.g., death in the family, [[sexual abuse]], extreme [[bullying]]) are established as a cause of [[Nocturnal enuresis#Medical definitions: primary vs. secondary enuresis|''secondary'' nocturnal enuresis]] (a return to bedwetting),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urologychannel.com/pediatric/enuresis.shtml|title=Pediatric Urology Enuresis (Bedwetting), Causes, Treatment|publisher=www.urologychannel.com|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref> but are very rarely a cause of [[Bedwetting#Primary Enuresis|PNE-type bedwetting]].<ref name="pracparm" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Butler RJ |title=Childhood nocturnal enuresis: developing a conceptual framework |journal=Clin Psychol Rev |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=909–31 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15533278 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.07.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272-7358(04)00078-9 |accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref> Bedwetting can also be a symptom of a pediatric neuropsychological disorder called [[PANDAS]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/pandas/pandas-frequently-asked-questions-about-pediatric-autoimmune-neuropsychiatric-disorders-associated-with-streptococcal-infections.shtml     | title = PANDAS: Frequently Asked Questions about Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections | accessdate = 2010-06-01 | publisher = NIMH}}</ref> When enuresis is caused by a psychological or neuropsychological disorder, the bedwetting is considered a ''symptom'' of the disorder. Enuresis has a psychological diagnosis code (see previous section), but it is not considered a psychological condition itself.<ref name="PedEd" />  (See section on psychological/social impact, below)
* '''Sleep apnea'''<br /> [[Sleep apnea]] stemming from an upper [[airway]] obstruction has been associated with bedwetting. [[Snoring]] and enlarged [[tonsils]] or [[adenoids]] are a sign of potential sleep apnea problems.<ref name="pracparm" />
* '''Sleepwalking'''<br /> [[Sleepwalking]] can lead to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker may think he/she is in another room. When the sleepwalker urinates during a sleepwalking episode, he/she usually thinks they are in the bathroom, and therefore urinate where they think the toilet should be. Cases of this have included opening a closet and urinating in it; urinating on the sofa and simply urinating in the middle of the room.
* '''Stress'''<br /> Stress is not a cause of [[Bedwetting#Primary Enuresis|''primary'' nocturnal enuresis]] (PNE), but is well established as a cause of returning to bedwetting ([[Nocturnal enuresis#Medical definitions: primary vs. secondary enuresis|''secondary'' nocturnal enuresis]]). Researchers studying children who have yet to stay dry find "no relationship to social background, life stresses, family constellation, or number of residencies."<ref name="PedEd" /> On the other hand, stress is a cause of people who return to wetting the bed. Researchers find that moving to a new town, parent conflict or divorce, arrival of a new baby, or loss of a loved one or pet can cause insecurity, contributing to returning bedwetting.<ref name="ifas" />

=== Unconfirmed, controversial, or mixed causes ===
* '''Heavy sleeping'''<br /> Many parents report that their bedwetting children are heavy sleepers. Research in this area has produced some contradictory results. Studies show that children wet the bed during all [[Sleep#Stages of sleep|phases of sleep]], not just the deepest (stage four, or stages three and four). A recent study, however, showed that enuretic children were harder to wake up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drgreene.com/21_586.html|title=Bed Wetting And Its Causes|publisher=www.drgreene.com
|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref> Some literature does show a possible connection between sleep disorders and [[Vasopressin|ADH]] production. Insufficient ADH might make it more difficult to transition from light sleep to being awake.<ref name="PedEd" />  
* '''Food allergies'''<br /> For some patients, [[Food allergy|food allergies]] may be part of the cause. This link is not well established, requiring further [[research]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mungan NA, Seckiner I, Yesilli C, Akduman B, Tekin IO |title=Nocturnal enuresis and allergy |journal=Scand. J. Urol. Nephrol. |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=237–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16118098 |doi=10.1080/00365590510007739 |url= |accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://healthinfo.cedars-sinai.edu/library/healthguide/en-us/Cam/topic.asp?hwid=hn-1006005
|title=Allergies and Sensitivities|publisher=Cedars-Sinai Health System|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref> 
* '''Improper toilet training'''<br /> This is another disputed cause of bedwetting. This theory was more widely supported in the last century and is still cited by some authors today. Some say bedwetting can be caused by improper [[toilet training]], either by starting the training when the child is too young or by being too forceful. Recent research has shown more mixed results and a connection to toilet training has not been proven or disproven.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uimc.discoveryhospital.com/main.php?id=2863 |title=Enuresis |publisher=University of Illinois Medical Center:Health Library |accessdate=2008-02-02 |last=|first=}}</ref>
* '''Dandelions'''<br /> Anecdotal reports and folk wisdom say children who handle [[dandelion]]s can end up wetting the bed. Dandelions are reputed to be a potent diuretic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/living-green/dandelions.html|title=Dandelions:time to throw in the trowel|accessdate=2007-07-10 | work=CBC News|date=2007-06-13}}</ref>  English folk names for the plant are "peebeds" and "pissabeds".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/dandelions-1|title=English folklore}}</ref>  In French dandelions are called ''pissenlit'', which means "urinate in bed"; likewise "piscialletto", an Italian folkname, and "meacamas" in Spanish.<ref>{{cite web |title=Benefits of herbal tea |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080106134125/http://www.herbalteatips.com/Benefits.php |archivedate=2008-01-06}}</ref>

==Psychological-social impact==
A review of medical literature shows doctors consistently stressing that a bedwetting child is not at fault for the situation. Many medical studies state that the psychological impacts of bedwetting are more important than the physical considerations. "It is often the child's and family member's reaction to bedwetting that determines whether it is a problem or not."<ref name="ifas" />

=== Impact on self-esteem ===
Whether bedwetting ''causes'' low self-esteem remains a subject of debate, but several studies have found that self-esteem improved with management of the condition.<ref name="nursingcenter">{{cite web|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/prodev/ce_article.asp?tid=659967|title=Helping Children with Nocturnal Enuresis|publisher=www.nursingcenter.com|accessdate=2008-02-03|last=Berry|first=Amanda}}</ref> 
Children questioned in one study ranked bedwetting as the third most stressful life event, after parental divorce and parental fighting. Adolescents in the same study ranked bedwetting as tied for second with parental fighting.<ref name="nursingcenter" /> 

Bedwetting children face problems ranging from being teased by siblings, being punished by parents, and being afraid that friends will find out. 

Psychologists report that the amount of psychological harm depends on whether the bedwetting harms self-esteem or development of social skills. Key factors are:<ref name="psychtoday">{{cite web|url=http://psychologytoday.com/conditions/enuresis.html|title=Psychology Today's Diagnosis Dictionary: Enuresis|publisher=psychologytoday.com|accessdate=2008-02-02|last=|first=}}</ref> 

*How much the bedwetting limits social activities like sleep-overs and campouts
*The degree of the social ostracism by peers
*Anger, punishment, and rejection by caregivers
*The number of failed treatment attempts
*How long the child has been wetting

=== Behavioral impact ===
Studies show that bedwetting children are more likely to have behavioral problems. For children who have developmental problems, the behavioral problems and the bedwetting are frequently part of/caused by the developmental issues. For bedwetting children '''without''' other developmental issues, these behavioral issues can result from self-esteem issues and stress caused by the wetting.<ref name="psychtoday" /> 

As mentioned below, current studies show that it is very rare for a child to intentionally wet the bed as a method of acting out.

=== Historical psychological perspective on bedwetting ===
An early psychological perspective on bedwetting was given in 1025 by [[Avicenna]] in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'':<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sleep Psychiatry|last=Alexander Z. Golbin|first=Howard M. Kravitz, Louis G. Keith|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=1-84214-145-7|page=171}}</ref>

{{quote|"Urinating in bed is frequently predisposed by deep sleep: when urine begins to flow, its inner nature and hidden will (resembling the will to breathe) drives urine out before the child awakes. When children become stronger and more robust, their sleep is lighter and they stop urinating."}}

Psychological theory through the 1960s placed much greater focus on the possibility that a bedwetting child might be acting out, purposefully striking back against parents by soiling linens and bedding. (More recent research and medical literature states that this is very rare.)<ref name="rwj">{{cite web|url=http://rwjsurgery.umdnj.edu/divisions/Urology/Peds/bedwetting.asp|title=Department of Surgery, UMDNJ-RWJMS|publisher=rwjsurgery.umdnj.edu|accessdate=2008-02-03|last=|first=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://children.musc.edu/news/parenting_newsletter/2002_12/|title=Many Older Children Struggle With Bedwetting

=== Punishment for bedwetting: effects and rates ===
Medical literature states and studies show that punishing or shaming a child for bedwetting will frequently make the situation worse. Doctors describe a downward cycle where a child punished for bedwetting feels shame and a loss of self-confidence. This can cause increased bedwetting incidents, leading to more punishment and shaming.<ref name="UFlorida">{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/HE794 |title=Bedwetting|accessdate=2009-09-12 }}</ref>

In the United States, about 25% of enuretic children are punished for wetting the bed.<ref name="jdiseases">{{cite journal |author=Haque M, Ellerstein NS, Gundy JH, ''et al.'' |title=Parental perceptions of enuresis. A collaborative study |journal=Am. J. Dis.

=== Impact on families ===
Parents and family members are frequently stressed by a child's bedwetting. Soiled linens and clothing cause additional laundry. Wetting episodes can cause lost sleep if the child wakes and/or cries, waking the parents. A European study estimated that a family with a child who wets nightly will pay about $1,000 a year for additional laundry, extra sheets, disposable absorbent garments such as diapers, and mattress replacement.<ref name="nursingcenter" /> 

Despite these stressful effects, doctors emphasize that parents should react patiently and supportively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidshealth.org/parent/general/sleep/enuresis.html|title=Bedwetting|publisher=www.kidshealth.org
|accessdate=2008-02-03|last=|first=}}</ref>

==Treatment and management options==

There are a number of treatment and condition management options for bedwetting. The following options apply when the bedwetting is not caused by a specifically identifiable medical condition such as a bladder abnormality or diabetes.

===When treatment is recommended===
Doctors consider treatment when there is a specific medical condition such as [[bladder]] abnormalities, [[infection]], or [[diabetes]]. Physicians also treat bedwetting when it may harm the child's [[self-esteem]] or relationships with family/friends. Only a small percentage of bedwetting is caused by a specific medical condition, so most treatment is prompted by concern for the child's ''emotional'' welfare. Behavioral treatment of bedwetting overall tends to show increased self-esteem for children <ref>Patrick C. Friman and Kevin M. Jones (2005):  Behavioral Treatment for Nocturnal Enuresis. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention  2 (4),'' Pg. 259- 267 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]</ref>

Parents become concerned much earlier than doctors. A study in 1980 asked parents and physicians the age that children should stay dry at night. The average parent response was 2.75 years old, while the average physician response was 5.13 years old.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shelov SP, Gundy J, Weiss JC, ''et al.'' |title=Enuresis: a contrast of attitudes of parents and physicians |journal=Pediatrics |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=707–10 |year=1981 |month=May |pmid=7255000 |doi= |url=}}</ref> 

Punishment is not effective and can interfere with treatment.

===Treatment options with high success rates===
* '''Waiting'''<br /> Almost all children will outgrow bedwetting. For this reason, urologists and pediatricians frequently recommend delaying treatment until the child is at least six or seven years old. Physicians may begin treatment earlier if they perceive the condition is damaging the child's self-esteem and/or relationships with family/friends.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Wearable alarm.gif|thumb|250px|Wearable Bedwetting Alarm]] -->
*'''Bedwetting alarms'''<br /> Physicians also frequently suggest [[bedwetting alarm]]s which sound a loud tone when they sense moisture. This can help [[Classical conditioning|condition]] the child to wake at the sensation of a full [[Urinary bladder|bladder]]. These alarms are considered effective, with study participants being 13 times more likely to become dry at night. There is a 29% to 69% relapse rate, however, so the treatment may need to be repeated.<ref name="bmj">{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7322/1167?view=full&pmid=11711411#SEC5|title=Evidence based paediatrics: Evidence based management of nocturnal enuresis|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=2008-02-03|last=Evans|first=Jonathan}}</ref>
* '''DDAVP (desmopressin)'''<br /> [[Desmopressin]] tablets are a synthetic replacement for [[Vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]], the hormone that reduces urine production during sleep. Desmopressin is usually used in the form of desmopressin acetate, DDAVP. Patients taking DDAVP are 4.5 times more likely to stay dry than those taking a placebo.<ref name="bmj" /> The drug replaces the hormone for that night with no cumulative effect. <br /> US drug regulators have banned using desmopressin nasal sprays for treating bedwetting since the oral form is considered safer.

* '''Tricyclic antidepressants'''<br /> [[Tricyclic antidepressant]] [[prescription drug]]s with [[anti-muscarinic]] properties have been proven successful in treating bedwetting, but also have an increased risk of side effects, including death from overdose.<ref>Evaluation and management of enuresis, W. Lane M. Robinson, N Engl J Med, 360:1429</ref> These drugs include [[amitriptyline]], [[imipramine]] and [[nortriptyline]]. Studies find that patients using these drugs are 4.2 times as likely to stay dry as those taking a [[placebo]].<ref name="bmj" /> The relapse rates after stopping the medicines are close to 50%.

===Condition management options===
*'''Absorbent Underwear'''<br /> Absorbent underwear or diapers can reduce embarrassment for bedwetters and make cleanup easier for caregivers. These products are known as training pants or diapers when used for younger children, and as absorbent underwear or incontinence briefs when marketed for older children and adults. Some brands of diaper are marketed especially for sufferers of bedwetting. A major benefit is the reduced stress on both the bedwetter and caregivers. Absorbent underwear can be especially beneficial for bedwetting children wishing to attend sleepovers or campouts, reducing emotional problems caused by social isolation and/or embarrassment in front of peers. Extended diaper usage may interfere with learning to stay dry at night, at least in adults with severe disabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba/articles/2004/jaba-37-01-0097.pdf|format=PDF|title=EXTENDED DIAPER WEARING: EFFECTS ON CONTINENCE IN AND OUT OF THE DIAPER|publisher=JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS|accessdate=2008-02-03|last=|first=}}</ref>

*Waterproof mattress pads are used in some cases to ease clean-up of bedwetting incidents, however they only protect the mattress, and the sheets, bedding or sleeping partner may be soiled.

* '''Dry bed training'''<br /> Dry bed training consists of a strict schedule of waking the child at night, attempting to condition the child into waking by himself/herself.<ref name="yahoohealth">{{cite web|url=http://health.yahoo.com/fitness-resources/dry-bed-training-for-bed-wetting/healthwise--hw211600.html

* '''Star chart'''<br /> A star chart allows a child and parents to track dry nights, as a record and/or as part of a reward program. This can be done either alone or with other treatments. There is no research to show effectiveness, either in reducing bedwetting or in helping self-esteem.<ref name="bmj" /> Some psychologists, however, recommend star charts as a way to celebrate successes and help a child's self-esteem.<ref name="yahoohealth" />

==Macdonald triad==
Research has shown that bedwetting does '''not''' indicate a greater possibility of being a sociopath, as long as caregivers do not cause trauma by shaming or punishing a bedwetting child. Bedwetting was part of the [[Macdonald triad]], a set of three behavioral characteristics described by [[John Macdonald (psychiatrist)|John Macdonald]] in 1963.<ref>Macdonald JM (1963). The threat to kill. ''Am J Psychiatry'' 120:125-130</ref>   The other two characteristics were [[firestarting]] and [[animal abuse]].  Macdonald suggested that there was an association between a person displaying '''all three''' characteristics, then later displaying [[Psychopathy|sociopathic]] criminal behavior. 

Research has found, however, that enuresis is '''not''' associated with sociopathic behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Weatherby | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Buller | first2 = D.

Bedwetting can be connected to emotional or physical trauma. Trauma can trigger a return to bedwetting (secondary enuresis) in both children and adults. In addition, caregivers cause some level of emotional trauma when they punish or shame a bedwetting child. 

This leads to a difficult distinction: it is not the bedwetting that increases the chance of criminal behavior, but the trauma. For example, parental cruelty can result in "homicidal proneness".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Violence|last=Dicanio|first=Margaret|publisher=iUniverse|year=2004|isbn=0-595-31652-2}}</ref>
