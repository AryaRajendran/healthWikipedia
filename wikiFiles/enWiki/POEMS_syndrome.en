'''POEMS syndrome''' (also known as '''Crow–Fukase syndrome, Takatsuki disease''', or '''PEP syndrome''') is a [[rare disease|rare]] medical [[syndrome]]. It is defined as the combination of a plasma-cell proliferative disorder (typically [[myeloma]]), [[polyneuropathy]], and effects on many other [[organ systems]]. It begins in middle age – the average age at onset is 50 – and affects up to twice as many men as women.<ref name="wustl" /> If untreated it is progressive and often fatal, with only 60% of sufferers remaining alive five years after onset.<ref name="wustl" /> However, the symptoms can improve if the blood disorder is successfully treated.

The name 'POEMS syndrome', now the most prevalent, was coined in 1980 by Bardwick ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bardwick PA, Zvaifler NJ, Gill GN, Newman D, Greenway GD, Resnick DL |title=Plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes: the POEMS syndrome. Report on two cases and a review of the literature |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=311–22 |year=1980 |pmid=6248720}}</ref> The name is an [[acronym]] deriving from some of the main features: [[polyneuropathy|'''P'''olyneuropathy]] (peripheral nerve damage), [[organomegaly|'''O'''rganomegaly]] (abnormal enlargement of organs), [[Endocrinology|'''E'''ndocrinopathy]] (damage to hormone-producing glands) or [[edema|'''E'''dema]], [[paraprotein|'''M'''-protein]] (an abnormal [[immunoglobulin]]) and '''S'''kin abnormalities (including [[hyperpigmentation]] and [[hypertrichosis]]).<ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000104618|POEMS syndrome}}</ref> However, these features are neither an exhaustive list nor seen in all individuals with the condition.

==Signs and symptoms==
The following are the most common clinical features of POEMS syndrome, either symptoms or signs.<ref name="wustl">{{cite web |url=http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/antibody/pnimdem.html#poems |title=Neuromuscular Disease Center, Washington University |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref><ref name="Disp07">{{Cite pmid|17850941}}</ref> The first two are present by definition; the remainder are frequent but not universal, and different individuals experience different combinations of them.

===Defining features===

The '''polyneuropathy''' is usually symmetrical and distal. There is a combination of [[demyelination]] and [[axonal]] damage, and [[sensory neuron|sensory]], [[motor neuron|motor]] and [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] neurones are all affected. The typical symptoms are therefore of numbness, tingling and weakness in the feet, later affecting the legs and hands. Pain is unusual, but the weakness may eventually become severe and disabling. The autonomic neuropathy may cause excessive sweating and [[erectile dysfunction]]; hormonal changes may also contribute to the latter. It is usually the symptoms of neuropathy which prompt a person with POEMS syndrome to seek medical attention.

[[Myeloma]] is the most common '''plasma-cell proliferative disorder''' associated with POEMS syndrome, present in more than half of all cases. Most myelomas associated with POEMS syndrome are [[osteosclerotic]], in contrast to the [[osteolytic]] bone lesions in most other myelomas. Other blood disorders occur in a significant minority of cases, including [[Castleman's disease]], [[plasmacytoma]] and [[MGUS]].

===Common features===

'''[[Papilloedema]]''' is a common sign of POEMS syndrome, occurring in a significant proportion of cases. Less frequent ocular features include [[uveitis]] and [[preretinal haemorrhage]].

'''Pulmonary disease:''' The [[lungs]] are often affected at more severe stages of the illness, although since by then physical exertion is usually limited by neuropathy, [[shortness of breath]] is unusual. [[Pulmonary hypertension]] is the most serious effect on the lungs, and there may also be restriction of chest expansion or impaired gas exchange.

'''Organomegaly:''' The [[hepatomegaly|liver]] may be enlarged, and less often the [[splenomegaly|spleen]] or [[lymphadenopathy|lymph nodes]], though these organs usually function normally.

'''Oedema:''' Leakage of fluid into the tissues is a common and often severe problem. This may take several forms, including dependent [[peripheral oedema]], [[pulmonary oedema]], effusions such as [[pleural effusion]] or [[ascites]], or generalised capillary leakage ([[anasarca]]).

'''Endocrinopathy:''' In women, [[amenorrhoea]], and in men, [[gynaecomastia]], [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[testicular atrophy]], are common early symptoms due to dysfunction of the gonadal axis. Other hormonal problems occurring in at least a quarter of patients include [[type 2 diabetes]], [[hypothyroidism]] and [[adrenal insufficiency]].

'''Monoclonal paraprotein:''' In most cases a serum [[paraprotein]] can be detected, although this is not universal (75–80%). This may represent [[IgG]] or [[IgA]], but the light chain type is almost always [[lambda light chain|lambda]]. This is in contrast to most paraproteinaemic neuropathies, in which the paraprotein is usually an [[IgM]] antibody.

'''Skin changes:''' A very wide variety of skin problems have been reported in association with POEMS syndrome. The most common is non-specific [[hyperpigmentation]]. The fingernails may be [[Nail clubbing|clubbed]] or [[leuconychia|white]], There may be thickening of the skin, excess hair or hair in unusual places ([[hypertrichosis]]), skin [[angioma]]s or [[haemangioma]]s, or there may be changes reminiscent of [[scleroderma]].

===Possible features===
Some features have been observed in patients with POEMS syndrome but are not yet certain to form part of the syndrome itself. These include [[thrombophilia]], [[arthralgia]], [[cardiomyopathy]] (systolic dysfunction), [[fever]], low [[vitamin B12]] levels and [[diarrhea]].<ref name=Dispenzieri/>

===Laboratory findings===
In addition to tests corresponding to the above findings (such as [[Electromyography|EMG]] for neuropathy or [[CT scan]] and [[bone marrow biopsy]] for myeloma), two other tests give abnormal results. These are: a raised level of [[VEGF]] in blood; and a raised [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] protein level, as in some other neuropathies. Even when myeloma is present, [[anaemia]] and [[thrombocytopaenia]] are rare; on the contrary, [[polycythaemia]] and [[thrombocytosis]] are often found.

==Criteria==
The most recent criteria for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome<ref name="Disp07"/> require that all of the following be present:
* polyneuropathy
* a monoclonal plasma-cell proliferative disorder
* one or more of the following major criteria:
** sclerotic bone lesions
** [[Castleman's disease]]
** elevated [[VEGF]] levels
* one or more of the following minor criteria:
** organomegaly (enlarged spleen, liver or lymph nodes)
** extravascular volume overload (oedema, pleural effusion or ascites)
** endocrinopathy (adrenal, pituitary, gonadal, parathyroid); diabetes or hypothyroidism alone are insufficient
** skin changes
** [[papilloedema]]
** [[thrombocytosis]] or [[polycythaemia]]

==Pathogenesis==
While the main features of the disease have been described, the exact mechanism of the disease has remained elusive. The paraprotein alone is insufficient to explain the multi-organ features, and various [[cytokine]]s produced by plasmacytoma cells have therefore been linked with the features of POEMS syndrome, specifically [[IL1B|interleukin 1β]], [[interleukin 6]] and [[TNFα]]. There also seems to be a role of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), given the [[angiogenesis|angiogenic]] changes in many tissues.<ref name=Dispenzieri>{{cite journal |author=Dispenzieri A, Kyle RA, Lacy MQ, ''et al.'' |title=POEMS syndrome: definitions and long-term outcome |journal=Blood |volume=101 |issue=7 |pages=2496–506 |year=2003 |pmid=12456500 |doi=10.1182/blood-2002-07-2299 | url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/101/7/2496}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There are no [[randomised controlled trial]]s of treatment in POEMS syndrome, owing to its rarity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD006828/frame.html |title=The Cochrane Library |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> Conventional treatments for demyelinating neuropathy, such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, are ineffective; treatment must be aimed at the haematological disorder.

Dispenzieri ''et al.''<ref name=Dispenzieri /> list numerous treatments, the effect of many of which is almost anecdotal. [[Prednisolone]] and [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s are the most commonly used. The Mayo Clinic group attempted [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] in sixteen patients; one patient died during the treatment, and in several others respiratory problems were unmasked in the course of the procedure. The outcome of the treatment, though, was good.

Given that VEGF plays a central role in the symptoms of POEMS syndrome, some have tried [[bevacizumab]] (Avastin), a [[monoclonal antibody]] directed against VEGF. While some reports were positive, others have reported [[capillary leak syndrome]] suspected to be the result of overly rapid lowering of VEGF levels. It therefore remains doubtful as to whether this will become part of standard treatment for POEMS syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Samaras P, Bauer S, Stenner-Liewen F, ''et al.'' |title=Treatment of POEMS syndrome with bevacizumab |journal=Haematologica |volume=92 |issue=10 |pages=1438–9 |year=2007 |pmid=18024383 |doi=10.3324/haematol.11315 | url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/content/full/92/10/1438}}</ref>

==History==
Crow, working in [[Bristol]], first described the combination of osteosclerotic myeloma, polyneuropathy and various unusual features (such as pigmentation and clubbing) in two patients aged 54 and 67.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4996.802 |author=Crow RS |title=Peripheral neuritis in myelomatosis |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=4996 |pages=802–4 |year=1956 |pmid=13364332 |pmc=2035359}}</ref>
