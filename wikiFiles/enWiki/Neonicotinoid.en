'''Neonicotinoids''' are a class of neuro-active [[insecticide]]s chemically related to [[nicotine]].
The development of this class of insecticides began with work in the 1980s by [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] and the 1990s by [[Bayer]].<ref name=Kollmeyer1999>{{Cite book

The neonicotinoids were developed in large part because they show reduced toxicity compared to previously used [[Organophosphate#Organophosphate pesticides|organophosphate]] and [[Carbamate#Carbamate insecticides|carbamate]] insecticides.
Most neonicotinoids show much lower toxicity in mammals than insects, but some breakdown products are toxic.<ref name=Chao1997>{{cite journal

In March 2013, the [[American Bird Conservancy]] published a review of 200 studies on neonicotinoids including industry research obtained through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|US Freedom of Information Act]], calling for a ban on neonicotinoid use as seed treatments because of their toxicity to birds, aquatic invertebrates, and other wildlife.<ref name="abcbirds1">{{cite web|title=The Impact of the Nation’s Most Widely Used Insecticides on Birds|url=http://www.abcbirds.org/abcprograms/policy/toxins/Neonic_FINAL.pdf|work=Neonicotinoid Insecticides and Birds|publisher=American Bird Conservancy|accessdate=19 March 2013|author=Pierre Mineau|coauthors=Cynthia Palmer|date=March 2013}}</ref> Also in March 2013, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] was sued by a coalition of [[beekeeper]]s, [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and [[sustainable agriculture]] advocates who accused the agency of performing inadequate toxicity evaluations and allowing the pesticides' registration to stand on insufficient industry studies.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carrington|first=Damian|title=US government sued over use of pesticides linked to bee harm|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/mar/22/us-government-sued-pesticides-bee-harm|accessdate=25 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 March 2013}}</ref>

==History==
Nicotine acts as an insecticide but is also toxic to mammals.<ref name=Ujvary>{{Cite book | first = István | last = Ujváry | contribution = Nicotine and Other Insecticidal Alkaloids | pages = 29–69 | editor-first = Izuru | editor-last = Yamamoto | editor2-first = John | editor2-last = Casida | title = Nicotinoid Insecticides and the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Tokyo | year = 1999 |isbn=443170213X}}
</ref>
In fact, nicotine has a lower [[lethal dose]] for rats than flies.<ref name=Yamamoto1999 />
This spurred a scientific search for compounds that retain the insecticidal properties of nicotine but have selectively less effect on mammals, but initial investigation of nicotine related compounds (nicotinoids) as insecticides was not successful.<ref name=Ujvary />
The precursor to [[nithiazine]] was first synthesized by a chemist at Purdue University. [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] researchers found in screening that this precursor showed insecticide potential and refined it to develop nithiazine.<ref name=Kollmeyer1999 />
Nithiazine was later found to be a postsynaptic [[Parasympathomimetic drug|acetylcholine receptor agonist]],<ref name=Schroeder1984>{{cite journal
| first = M. E. | last = Schroeder | first2 = R. F. | last2 = Flattum

| issue = 2}}</ref> 
meaning it has the same mode of action as nicotine. 
Nithiazine does not act as an [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]],<ref name=Schroeder1984 /> in contrast to the [[Organophosphate#Organophosphate pesticides|organophosphate]] and [[Carbamates#Carbamate insecticides|carbamate]] insecticides.
While nithiazine has the desired specificity (i.e. low mammalian toxicity), it is not photostable (it breaks down in sunlight), so it was not commercially viable. 
Neonicotinoids were developed after the lack of commercial success of nithiazine. 
The first commercial neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, was developed by [[Bayer]].<ref name=Kollmeyer1999 />

Most neonicotinoids  are water-soluble and break down slowly in the environment, so they can be taken up by the plant and provide protection from insects as the plant grows. During the late 1990s this class of pesticides, primarily [[imidacloprid]], became widely used. Beginning in the early 2000s, two other neonicotinoids, [[clothianidin]] and [[thiamethoxam]] were in use as well.  Currently, virtually all corn that is planted in the [[Midwestern United States]] is treated with one of these two insecticides and various [[fungicide]]s. In addition, most [[soybean]] seeds are also treated with  a neonicotinoid insecticide, usually thiamethoxam.  Clothianidin is one of the most toxic substances known for honey bees.<ref>[http://www.extension.org/pages/65034/neonicotinoid-seed-treatments-and-honey-bee-health Neonicotinoid Seed Treatments and Honey Bee Health]. eXtension (2013-01-28). Retrieved on 2013-05-02.</ref>  

===US EPA reregistration===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] has established a 15-year registration review cycle for all pesticides. As all neonicotinoids were registered after 1984, they were not subject to reregistration. The EPA granted a conditional, or temporary, registration to clothianidin in 2003. The same approval was given to thiamethoxam. Imidacloprid was registered in 1994. It was not conditional. The EPA is now re-evaluating the safety of neonicotinoids. According to Scott Black, the EPA has stated that the registration review process will take several years. At the earliest , the new verdict for imidacloprid will be in 2016 and 2017 for clothianidin and thiamethoxam.
The registration review docket for [[imidacloprid]] opened in December 2008 and the docket for [[nithiazine]] opened in March 2009. Stated topics for review include uncertainty in the effects of neonicotinoids on pollinators, including reports of beekill incidents. The EPA states, "To better ensure a 'level playing field' for the neonicotinoid class as a whole, and to best take advantage of new research as it becomes available," the other neonicotinoids ([[acetamiprid]], [[clothianidin]], [[dinotefuran]], [[thiacloprid]] and [[thiamethoxam]]) will begin registration review in 2012.<ref name=epa>{{cite web | last = US EPA | authorlink = United States Environmental Protection Agency | title = Pesticides: Registration Review: Program Highlights | year = 2012 | date = April 2012 | url = http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/registration_review/highlights.htm | accessdate = 15 April 2012}}</ref>

===EU ban===
In response to growing concerns about the impact of neonicotinoids on honey bees, the [[European Commission]] asked the [[European Food Safety Authority]] to study their safety.  The results of the peer reviewed study were published in January 2013.   They concluded that the previous industry-sponsored studies were flawed and that the pesticide posed an unacceptably high risk to bees.<ref name=EFSA>European Food Safety Authority (16 January 2013) [http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3066.htm "Conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment for bees for the active substance clothianidin"] ''EFSA Journal'' '''11'''(1):3066.</ref>  In response to the study, the European Commission recommended a moratorium across the [[European Union]].<ref name=victory>{{cite news|title='Victory for bees' as European Union bans neonicotinoid pesticides blamed for destroying bee population|work=The Independent|date=29 April 2013|author=Charlotte McDonald-Gibson|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/victory-for-bees-as-european-union-bans-neonicotinoid-pesticides-blamed-for-destroying-bee-population-8595408.html|accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref>

On 29 April 2013, 15 of the 27 [[European Union]] member states voted to enact a 2-year ban on the use of three neonicotinoids.  Eight nations voted against the ban, while four abstained.  The law prevents the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam on [[flowering plant]]s for two years unless compelling [[scientific evidence]] comes out that says the chemicals are safe.<ref name=victory /> Temporary suspensions had previously been enacted in [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Italy]].<ref name=harming />

Environmentalists called the move "a significant victory for common sense and our beleaguered bee populations" and said it is "crystal clear that there is overwhelming scientific, political and public support for a ban."<ref name=victory />  Great Britain, which voted against the bill, disagreed: "Having a healthy bee population is a top priority for us, but we did not support the proposal for a ban because our scientific evidence doesn’t support it."<ref name=victory />  [[Bayer Cropscience]], which makes two of the three banned products remarked "Bayer remains convinced neonicotinoids are safe for bees, when used responsibly and properly&nbsp;... clear scientific evidence has taken a back-seat in the decision-making process."<ref name=harming>{{cite news|title=Bee-harming pesticides banned in Europe|work=The Guardian|author=Damian Carrington|date=29 April 2013|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/apr/29/bee-harming-pesticides-banned-europe|accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref>  Reaction in the scientific community was mixed.  Biochemist Lin Field said the decision was based on "political lobbying" and could lead to the overlooking of other factors involved in colony collapse disorder.  A [[Cambridge]] researcher disagreed, saying "This is a victory for the [[precautionary principle]], which is supposed to underlie environmental regulation."<ref name=victory />  A bee expert called the ban "excellent news for pollinators", and said, "The weight of evidence from researchers clearly points to the need to have a phased ban of neonicotinoids."<ref name=harming />

==Usage==
Imidacloprid, a representative neonicotinoid, is effective against sucking insects, some chewing insects, soil insects, and is also used to control fleas on domestic animals.<ref name=NPIC-imi />

Imidacloprid is possibly the most widely used insecticide, both within the mode of action group and in the worldwide market. It is now applied against soil, seed, timber and animal pests as well as foliar treatments for crops including: cereals, cotton, grain, legumes, potatoes,<ref>[http://www.nationalpotatocouncil.org/NPC/p_documents/document_280607084102.pdf Potato insecticides by group and mode of action] (PDF)</ref> pome fruits, rice, turf and vegetables. It is systemic with particular efficacy against sucking insects and has a long residual activity. Imidacloprid can be added to the water used to irrigate plants. Controlled release formulations of imidacloprid take 2–10 days to release 50% of imidacloprid in water.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1080/03601234.2012.634365}}</ref>

The application rates for neonicotinoid insecticides are much lower than older, traditionally used insecticides.

==Mode of action==
Neonicotinoids, like nicotine, are [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] agonists.
This [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] is normally activated by the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]].
In mammals, these receptors are located in both the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s.  In insects the receptors are limited to the [[central nervous system|CNS]].
While low to moderate activation of these receptors causes nervous stimulation, high levels overstimulate and block the receptors.<ref name=Yamamoto1999 /><ref name=NPIC-imi>{{cite web | first = J.A. | last = Gervais | first2 = B. | last2 = Luukinen | first3 = K. | last3 = Buhl | first4 = D. | last4 = Stone

| url = http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/imidacloprid.pdf | accessdate = 12 April 2012 }}</ref>
This receptor blockage causes [[paralysis]] and death. 
Normally, [[acetylcholine]] is broken down by [[acetylcholinesterase]] to terminate signals from these receptors. However, acetylcholinesterase cannot break down neonicotinoids, and the binding is irreversible.<ref name=NPIC-imi />
Because most neonicotinoids bind much more strongly to insect [[neuron]] receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, these insecticides are selectively more toxic to insects than mammals.<ref name=Tomizawa2004>{{Cite journal

A [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] nitrogen will become positively charged in neutral aqueous solution because it is [[Protonation|protonated]] by water.
This positive charge gives these compounds a strong [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand binding affinity|affinity]] to mammalian nAChRs. 
At the same time, the charge on nicotine lowers its effectiveness as an insecticide, because the [[blood–brain barrier]] prevents free access of [[ion]]s to the [[central nervous system]], and insect nAChRs are only present in the [[central nervous system]].<ref name=Yamamoto1999 /><ref name=Tomizawa2004 />
The blood–brain barrier does not prevent nicotine poisoning in mammals, because mammalian nAChRs are located in the [[peripheral nervous system]] and are necessary for vital functions such as breathing. The low mammalian toxicity of imidacloprid can be explained in large part by its lack of a charged nitrogen atom at physiological pH. The molecule shows weak affinity to mammalian nAChRs but strong affinity for insect nAChRs. Furthermore, the uncharged molecule can penetrate the insect blood–brain barrier, while the human blood–brain barrier filters it.<ref name=Yamamoto1999 />

Independent studies show that while the [[photodegradation]] [[Biological half-life|half-life time]] of most neonicotinoids is around 34 days when exposed to sunlight, it might take up to 1386 days (3.8 years) for these compounds to degrade in the absence of sunlight and micro-organism activity.

==Environmental impacts==
In 2008, Germany revoked the registration of clothianidin for use on seed corn after an incident that resulted in the death of millions of nearby honey bees.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Alison |last=Benjamin |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/23/wildlife.endangeredspecies |title=Pesticides: Germany bans chemicals linked to honeybee devastation |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 May 2008}}</ref>  Investigation of the incident revealed that it was caused by a combination of factors:
*failure to use a [[Seed treatment|polymer seed coating]] known as a "sticker"; 
*weather conditions that resulted in late planting when nearby [[canola]] crops were in bloom;  
*a particular type of air-driven equipment used to sow the seeds which apparently blew clothianidin-laden dust off the seeds and into the air as the seeds were ejected from the machine into the ground; 
*dry and windy conditions at the time of planting that blew the dust into the nearby canola fields where honey bees were foraging;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/cb/csb_page/updates/2008/bees-act.htm |title=EPA Acts to Protect Bees &#124; Pesticides &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref> 
*and a higher application rate which had been authorized for a severe [[Western corn rootworm|root worm]] infestation. Clothianidin was also restricted for a short period for use on [[rapeseed]]; however, after evidence had shown that the problems resulting from [[maize]] seed were not transferable to rapeseed, its use was reinstated under the condition that the pesticide be fixed to the rapeseed grains by means of an additional sticker, so that abrasion dusts would not be released into the air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bvl.bund.de/EN/08_PresseInfothek_engl/01_Presse_und_Hintergrundinformationen/2008_07_15_hi_Bienensterben_en.html?nn=1414138 |title=Press releases and background information – Background information: Bee losses caused by insecticidal seed treatment in Germany in 2008 |publisher=BVL |accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref><ref name=bvlBeeBack>{{cite web| url=http://www.bvl.bund.de/EN/08_PresseInfothek_engl/01_Presse_und_Hintergrundinformationen/2008_07_15_hi_Bienensterben_en.html?nn=1414138| title= Background information: Bee losses caused by insecticidal seed treatment in Germany in 2008| publisher=German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL)|date=2008-07-15}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (Germany)|German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety]] decided to continue to suspend authorization for the use of clothianidin on corn. It had not yet been fully clarified to what extent and in what manner, bees come into contact with the active substances in the pesticides belonging to the neonicotinoid group (clothianidin, [[thiamethoxam]] and [[imidacloprid]]) when used on corn. In addition, on the basis of new findings, the question arose as to whether drops of liquid from plants, which are taken in by bees, pose an additional risk.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bvl.bund.de/EN/08_PresseInfothek_engl/01_Presse_und_Hintergrundinformationen/2009_02_09_pi_Maissaatgut_Mesurol_en.html?nn=1414138| title= Maize seed may now be treated with "Mesurol flüssig" again| publisher=German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL)|date=2002-02-09}}</ref>

Initially neonicotinoids were considered to have low-toxicity to many beneficial insects, including bees; however recently this claim has come into question. More recent research suggests a potential toxicity to bees and other beneficial insects through low level contamination of nectar and pollen with neonicotinoid insecticides used in agriculture. Although these low level exposures do not normally kill bees directly, they may impact some bees’ ability to forage for nectar, learn and remember where flowers are located, and possibly impair their ability to find their way home to the nest or hive.<ref>[http://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/what-is-a-neonicotinoid/ What is a neonicotinoid? | Insects in the City].

A two-year [[peer review]]ed study published in 2012 showed the presence of two neonicotinoid insecticides, clothianidin and thiamethoxam, in bees found dead in and around hives situated near agricultural fields. Other bees at the hives exhibited tremors, uncoordinated movement and convulsions, all signs of insecticide poisoning. The insecticides were also consistently found  at low levels in soil — up to two years after treated seed was planted — on nearby [[dandelion]] flowers and in corn pollen gathered by the bees.  Insecticide-treated seeds are covered with a sticky substance to control its release into the environment, however they are then coated with [[talc]] to facilitate machine planting.  This talc is released into the environment in large amounts.  The study found that the exhausted talc showed extremely high levels of the insecticides — up to about 700,000 times the lethal contact dose for a bee.  According to the research, {{quote|"Whatever was on the seed was being exhausted into the environment.  This material is so concentrated that even small amounts landing on flowering plants around a field can kill foragers or be transported to the hive in contaminated pollen. This might be why we found these insecticides in pollen that the bees had collected and brought back to their hives."}}  Tests also showed that the corn pollen that bees were bringing back to hives tested positive for neonicotinoids at levels roughly below 100 [[Parts-per notation|parts per billion]], an amount not acutely toxic, but enough to kill bees if sufficient amounts are consumed.<ref>[http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2012/120111KrupkeBees.html Purdue Newsroom – Researchers: Honeybee deaths linked to seed insecticide exposure].

In July 2010, a Dutch toxicologist examined the toxicity of neonicotinoid pesticides in relation to exposure time.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20803795 |year=2010 |last1=Tennekes |first1=Henk A. |title=The significance of the Druckrey–Küpfmüller equation for risk assessment—The toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides to arthropods is reinforced by exposure time |volume=276 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |journal=Toxicology |url=http://boerenlandvogels.nl/sites/default/files/Tennekes_2010_Toxicology_9.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.tox.2010.07.005}}<!-- looks like a pre-publication copy... --></ref> He then authored and published a book in regards to his research called "A Disaster in the Making". The book explores the impact of neonicotinoids on the [[immune system]] of bees.  The 2009 documentary ''[[Vanishing of the Bees]]'' suggests that a link between neonicotinoid pesticides and Colony Collapse Disorder exists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vanishingbees.co.uk/ |title=2009 documentary '&#39;Vanishing of the Bees'&#39; |publisher=Vanishingbees.co.uk |date=2011-02-03 |accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref>

===Health effects on birds, aquatic invertebrates, and other wildlife===
In March 2013, the [[American Bird Conservancy]] published a review of 200 studies on neonicotinoids including industry research obtained through the US Freedom of Information Act, calling for a ban on neonicotinoid use as seed treatments because of their toxicity to birds, aquatic invertebrates, and other wildlife.<ref name="abcbirds1"/> 

===Health effect on humans===
A study conducted on rats suggests that the neonicotinoids may adversely affect human health, especially the developing brain.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0032432}}</ref>
