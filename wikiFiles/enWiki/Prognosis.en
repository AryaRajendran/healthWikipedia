'''Prognosis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''πρόγνωση'' - literally fore-knowing, foreseeing) is a [[medicine|medical]] term for predicting the likely outcome of one's current standing. When applied to large [[statistical population]]s, prognostic estimates can be very accurate: for example the statement "45% of patients with severe [[septic shock]] will die within 28 days" can be made with some confidence, because previous research found that this proportion of patients died. However, it is much harder to translate this into a prognosis for an individual patient: additional information is needed to determine whether a patient belongs to the 45% who will succumb, or to the 55% who survive.<ref>{{cite  |author=Gould, SJ| url=http://www.prognosis.org/what_does_it_mean.php|accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref>

A complete prognosis includes the expected duration, the function, and a description of the course of the disease, such as progressive decline, intermittent crisis, or sudden, unpredictable crisis.  
==Methodology==
===Disease and prognostic indicators===

Prognostic scoring is also used for cancer outcome predictions.  A [[Manchester score]] is an indicator of prognosis in small-cell [[lung cancer]].  For Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, physicians have developed the [[International Prognostic Index]] to predict patient outcome.

Other medical areas where prognostic indicators are used is in Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) ([[Hy's law]]) and use of an [[exercise stress test]] as a prognostic indicator after [[myocardial infarction]].

===End of life===
Medical studies have demonstrated that most doctors are overly optimistic when giving prognostic information, that is, they tend to overstate how long a patient might live.  For patients who are critically ill, particularly those in an [[intensive care unit]], there are numerical prognostic scoring systems that are more accurate. The most famous of these is the [[APACHE II]] scale. However, this scale is most accurate when applied in the seven days prior to a patient's predicted death.

Knowing the prognosis helps determine whether it makes more sense to attempt certain treatments or to withhold them, and thus plays an important role in end-of-life decisions.

==Estimator==
[[Estimator]]s that are commonly used to describe prognoses include:
*''[[Progression-free survival]]'' - the length of time during and after medication or treatment during which the disease being treated (usually cancer) does not get worse.
*''[[Survival rate]]'' - indicating the percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive for a given period of time after diagnosis.
*''Survival time'' - the remaining duration of life. If not otherwise specified, it generally starts from the time of diagnosis.

==History==

For 19th century physicians, particularly those following the French school of medicine, the main aim of medicine was not to cure disease, but rather to give a [[medical diagnosis]] and achieve a satisfying ''prognosis'' of the patient's chances. Only several decades later did the focus of efforts in Western medicine shift to curing disease.
