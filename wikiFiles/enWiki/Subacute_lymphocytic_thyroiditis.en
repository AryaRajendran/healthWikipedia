'''Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis''' is a form of [[thyroiditis]] that is also known as '''silent thyroiditis''' or '''painless thyroiditis'''. Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis may occur at any age and is more common in females. A variant of subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis occurs postpartum - postpartum thyroiditis. Both of these entities can be considered subtypes of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and have an autoimmune basis. Anti-thyroid antibodies are common in all three and the underlying histology is similar.  <ref name=afp>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000215/1047.html ''Thyroiditis: Differential Diagnosis and Management'', American Family Physician,February 15, 2000]</ref><ref>{{DorlandsDict|eight/000108754|Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis}}</ref> 

== Symptoms ==
Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis features a small [[Goitre|goiter]] without tenderness.  This condition tends to have a phase of [[hyperthyroidism]] followed by a return to a [[euthyroid]] state, and then a phase of [[hypothyroidism]], followed again by a return to the euthyroid state. The time span of each phase can vary; however, each phase usually lasts 2-3 months.<ref name=afp/>

==Diagnosis==

Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis can only be diagnosed correctly by taking a [[radioactive iodine uptake test]], or RAIU test.<ref name=afp/><ref name=raiu>[http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/radioactive-iodine-uptake-test Description of Radioactive Iodine Uptake Test, WebMD.com, August 14, 2008]</ref> 

During the hyperthyroid phase, iodine uptake is suppressed, while during the hypothyroid phase, uptake is increased.<ref name=nih>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/article/000388.htm NIH Medline Plus]</ref> 

This situation contrasts greatly with the elevated iodine uptake found in patients with [[Graves' disease]].<ref name=afp/>

==Treatment==

Treatment is based on symptoms. [[Beta-blockers]] relieve rapid heart rate and excessive sweating during the hyperthyroid phase.<ref name=nih/>
