The micro-organisms that colonize the vagina, collectively referred to as the '''vaginal microbiota''' or '''vaginal microflora''', were discovered by the German gynecologist [[Albert Döderlein]] in 1892.  The amount and type of bacteria present have significant implications for a woman's overall health.  The primary colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual are of the genus [[lactobacillus]],<ref>{{cite doi|10.1128/JCM.40.8.2746-2749.2002}}</ref> such as ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus|L. acidophilus]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus doderlein|L. doderlein]]'', and the [[lactic acid]] they produce (some species produce hydrogen peroxide or antibiotic), in combination with fluids secreted during [[sexual arousal]], are greatly responsible for the characteristic scent associated with the vaginal area.

== Menstruation ==
During [[menstruation]], the concentration of vaginal microbiome is observed to decline.<ref>{{cite pmid|3954346}}</ref> The effect of [[tampon]] use on vaginal flora is debated, but application of tampons appears not to significantly modify the balance of bacterial presence.

== Disease prevention ==
A healthy vaginal microbiome aids in the prevention of [[bacterial vaginosis]], [[yeast infections]] and other possible problems by maintaining an acidic pH (< 4.5) that is unfavourable for the growth of common pathogens, such as ''[[Gardnerella vaginalis]]''. The lactobacilli present in a healthy vaginal microbiome also occupy the [[ecological niche]] that would otherwise be available for exploitation by pathogenic organisms. However, harmful bacteria or an imbalance in bacteria can lead to infection.

One method of reducing the risk of infection in the local area of the [[urethra]] is to urinate immediately after sex.  Additionally, exclusive use of sterile contraceptives can assist in prevention of infection.
