The '''midbrain''' or '''mesencephalon''' (from the Greek ''mesos'' - middle, and ''enkephalos'' - brain<ref>Mosbyâ€™s Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book 1994, p. 981</ref>) is a portion of the [[central nervous system]] associated with vision, hearing, motor control, sleep/wake, arousal ([[alertness]]), and temperature regulation.<ref>Breedlove, Watson, & Rosenzweig. Biological Psychology, 6th Edition, 2010, pp. 45-46</ref> 

Anatomically, it comprises the [[tectum]] (or corpora quadrigemina), [[tegmentum]], the ventricular mesocoelia (or "iter"), and the [[cerebral peduncle]]s, as well as several nuclei and fasciculi. [[wikt:caudal|Caudally]] <!-- Is this a good word to use here? -->the mesencephalon adjoins the [[pons]] ([[metencephalon]]) and [[wikt:rostral|rostrally]] it adjoins the [[diencephalon]] (Thalamus, hypothalamus, etc.). The midbrain is located below the [[cerebral cortex]], and above the [[hindbrain]] placing it near the center of the brain.<ref>http://www.morris.umn.edu/~ratliffj/images/brain_slides/slide_5.htm</ref>

==Development==

During embryonic development, the midbrain arises from the second vesicle, also known as the mesencephalon, of the [[neural tube]]. Unlike the other two vesicles, the [[prosencephalon]] and [[rhombencephalon]], the mesencephalon remains undivided for the remainder of neural development. It does not split into other brain areas. while the  prosencephalon, for example, divides into the [[telencephalon]] and the [[diencephalon]].<ref>Martin. Neuroanatomy Text and Atlas, Second Edition, 1996, pp. 35-36.</ref>

Throughout embryonic development, the cells within the midbrain continually multiply and compress the still-forming [[Aqueduct of Sylvius]] or cerebral aqueduct. Partial or total obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct during development can lead to congenital [[hydrocephalus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydrocephalus/detail_hydrocephalus.htm |title=Hydrocephalus Fact Sheet |publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |date=2008-02 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref>

==Functional role==

The mesencephalon is considered part of the [[brainstem]]. Its [[substantia nigra]] is closely associated with [[motor system]] pathways of the [[basal ganglia]]. The human mesencephalon is [[archipallium|archipallian]] in origin, meaning its general architecture is shared with the most ancient of [[vertebrate]]s. [[Dopamine]] produced in the [[substantia nigra]] and [[ventral tegmental area]] plays a role in motivation and habituation of species from humans to the most elementary animals such as insects. Laboratory [[house mice]] from lines that have been [[selectively bred]] for high voluntary [[Running wheel|wheel running]] have enlarged midbrains.<ref>Kolb, E. M., E. L. Rezende, L. Holness, A. Radtke, S. K. Lee, A. Obenaus, and [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] T, Jr. 2013. Mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running have larger midbrains: support for the mosaic model of brain evolution. [[Journal of Experimental Biology]] 216:515-523. </ref> The midbrain helps to relay information for vision and hearing.

==Corpora quadrigemina==
The [[corpora quadrigemina]] ("quadruplet bodies") are four solid lobes on the dorsal side of the [[cerebral aqueduct]], where the superior posterior pair are called the [[superior colliculus|superior colliculi]] and the inferior posterior pair are called the [[inferior colliculus|inferior colliculi]].
The four solid lobes help to decussate several fibres of the optic nerve. However some fibers also show ipsilateral arrangement (i.e. they run parallel on the same side without decussating.)
The superior colliculus is involved with [[Saccade|saccadic eye movements]]; while the inferior is a synapsing point for sound information. The [[trochlear nerve]] comes out of the posterior surface of the midbrain, below the inferior colliculus.

==Cerebral peduncle==
The [[cerebral peduncles]] are paired structures, present on the ventral side of cerebral aqueduct, and they further carry [[tegmentum]] on the dorsal side and cresta or pes on the ventral side, and both of them accommodate the [[corticospinal tract]] fibres, from the [[internal capsule]] (i.e. ascending + descending tracts = longitudinal tract.)
the middle part of cerebral peduncles carry [[substantia nigra]] (also called "Black Matter") which is a type of basal nucleus. It is the only part of the brain that carries melanin pigment.

Between the peduncles is the interpeduncular fossa, which is a cistern filled with [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. The [[oculomotor nerve]] comes out between the peduncles, and the trochlear nerve is visible wrapping around the outside of the peduncles. The oculomotor is responsible for pupil constriction (parasympathetic) and certain eye movements.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haines|first=Duane E.|title=Neuroanatomy : an atlas of structures, sections, and systems|publisher=Wolters Kluwer/ Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Health|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-60547-653-7|pages=42|edition=8th ed.}}</ref>

==Anatomical features of cross-sections through the midbrain==
[[Image:Midbrainsuperiorcolliculus.png|thumb|right]]
The midbrain is usually sectioned at the level of the superior and inferior colliculi.
[[File:Human embryo 8 weeks 4.JPG|thumb|Mesencephalon of human embryo]]
*A transverse cross-section at the level of the superior colliculus shows the [[red nucleus]], the nuclei of the [[oculomotor nerve]] (and associated [[Edinger-Westphal nucleus]]), the superior cerebellar peduncles or [[crus cerebri]], and the [[substantia nigra]].<ref>Martin. Neuroanatomy Text and Atlas, Second edition. 1996, pp. 522-525.</ref>
*A horizontal cross section at the level of the inferior colliculus still shows the substantia nigra. Also apparent are the [[trochlear nerve]] nucleus, and the [[decussation]] of the superior cerebellar peduncles.<ref>Martin. Neuroanatomy Text and Atlas, Second edition. 1996, pp. 522-525.</ref>
*Both sections will show the [[cerebral aqueduct]], which connects the [[third ventricle|third]] and [[fourth ventricle]] and the [[periaqueductal gray]].<ref>Martin. Neuroanatomy Text and Atlas, Second edition. 1996, pp. 522-525.</ref>

One [[mnemonic]] for remembering the structures of the midbrain involves visualizing the mesencephalic cross-section as an upside down bear face. The two red nuclei are the eyes of the bear and the cerebral crura are the ears. The tectum is the chin and the cerebral peduncles are the face and ears.
