==Signs and symptoms==
AEN has never been recorded as a one symptom disorder, but instead present by multiple symptoms.<ref name="pmid17322991"/> The symptoms vary from the severity of the disorder. The most classic sign of AEN is the dark pigmentation of esophageal mucosa in an upper endoscopy, usually viewed as an ulcer or as an infectious disease.<ref name="aen1"/> Necrosis can be found mostly between the three distals of the esophagus, but stops abruptly at the [[gastroesophageal junction]].<ref name="pmid17322991"/> The basic and most common symptoms reported are [[blood in stool]] and [[blood in vomiting]]. [[Upper gastrointestinal bleeding]] then is reported, and is very commonly represented in elderly patients.<ref name="pmid15285044">{{cite journal |author=Khan AM, Hundal R, Ramaswamy V, Korsten M, Dhuper S |title=Acute esophageal necrosis and liver pathology, a rare combination |journal=World J.

Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and unstable vital signs are common.  A cardiovascular event (such as a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]) was reported in ten percent of the total known cases.<ref name="pmid17322991"/>

==Risk factors==

Having [[cancer]] (current or previous) is currently one of the most prevalent out of all conditions among patients.

==Diagnosis==
Acute esophageal necrosis can only be diagnosed by an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.<ref name="pmid17322991"/><ref name="aen1"/><ref name="aen4">{{cite journal |title=Black esophagus: report of six cases and review of the literature, 1963-2003 |pages=105–110 |author=Grudell A, Mueller P, Viggiano T. |journal=Journal of Gastroenterology |year=2007 |volume=19 |issue=2}}</ref>

==Treatment==
Currently, there is no direct treatment for AEN.<ref name="aen2"/> Only treatment is for the underlying main diseases or conditions. Appropriate hydration is set. [[Antacids]] are also added for further recovery support. Common support drugs of antacids are either [[Dihydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]] [[receptor antagonist]]s, and/or a [[proton pump inhibitor]].<ref name="aen2"/> [[Sucralfate]] was used as an option.  [[Parenteral nutrition]] greatly increased chance of recovery. An [[esophagectomy]] can be issued if the disorder is severe enough.<ref name="aen2"/>

==Society and culture==
Acute esophageal necrosis made an appearance on an [[United States of America|American]] medical drama show, [[Dr. G: Medical Examiner]]. [[Jan Garavaglia]], the show's host, receives a female body, that at time of the autopsy had a severe case of acute esophageal necrosis due to chronic [[alcoholism]].

==History==
Acute esophageal necrosis was first described by Goldenberg ''et al.'' in 1990.<ref name="pmid17322991"/><ref name="aen2"/> Cases have emerged since 1960, but have never been described as the common names for AEN. Due to its rarity, only 88 cases have been pronounced AEN, but most likely there are many more. Gurvits ''et al.'' describes AEN as "poorly described in medical literature".<ref name="pmid17322991"/>
