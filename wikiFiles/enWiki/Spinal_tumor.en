'''Spinal tumors''' are [[neoplasm]]s located in the [[spinal cord]].  Extradural tumors are more common than intradural neoplasms.

Depending on their location, the spinal cord tumors can be:
* Extradural - outside the [[dura mater]] lining (most common)
* Intradural - part of the dura
** Intramedullary - inside the [[spinal cord]]
**Extramedullary- inside the dura, but outside the spinal cord

==Pathology==
Extradural tumors are mostly [[metastasis|metastases]] from primary cancers elsewhere (commonly [[breast cancer|breast]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]] and [[lung cancer]]).<ref name=Hamamoto>{{cite journal|last=Hamamoto|first=Yasushi|coauthors=Kataoka, M., Senba, T., Uwatsu, K., Sugawara, Y., Inoue, T., Sakai, S., Aono, S., Takahashi, T. and Oda, S.|title=Vertebral Metastases with High Risk of Symptomatic Malignant Spinal Cord Compression|journal=Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=9|year=2009|month=May|volume=39|issue=7|pages=431–434|doi=10.1093/jjco/hyp039|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> Primary tumors may be benign (e.g. [[hemangioma]]) or malignant in nature. 

==Symptoms==
The symptoms seen are due to spinal nerve compression and weakening of the vertebral structure. [[Urinary incontinence|Incontinence]] and decreased sensitivity in the ''saddle area'' ([[buttock]]s) are generally considered warning signs of [[spinal cord compression]] by the tumor. Other symptoms of spinal cord compression include lower extremity weakness, [[sensory loss]], and rapid onset [[paralysis]]. The diagnosis of primary spinal cord tumors is very difficult, mainly due to its symptoms, which tend to be wrongly attributed to more common and benign degenerative spinal diseases.<ref name=Hamamoto></ref> <ref name=Ribas>{{cite journal|last=Ribas|first=Eduardo S. C.|coauthors=Schiff, David|title=Spinal Cord Compression|journal=Current Treatment Options in Neurology|date=1|year=2012|month=May|doi=10.1007/s11940-012-0176-7|accessdate=6 May 2012}} </ref> 

Spinal cord compression is commonly found in patients with metastatic malignancy.<ref name=Holt>{{cite journal|last=Holt|first=T.|coauthors=Hoskin, P., Maranzano, E., Sahgal, A., Schild, S.E., Ryu, S., Loblaw, A.|title=Malignant epidural spinal cord compression: the role of external beam radiotherapy|journal=Curr Opin Support Palliat Care|date=6|year=2012|month=March|volume=6|issue=1|pages=103–8|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> [[Back pain]] is a primary symptom of spinal cord compression in patients with known malignancy.<ref name=Reith>{{cite journal|last=Reith|first=W.|coauthors=Yilmaz, U.|title=[Extradural tumors].|journal=Radiologe|year=2011|month=December|volume=51|issue=12|pages=1018–1024|doi=10.1007/s00117-011-2152-8|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> It may prompt a [[bone scan]] to confirm or exclude spinal metastasis. Rapid identification and intervention of malignant spinal tumors, often causing spinal cord compression, is key to maintaining quality of life in patients.<ref name=Jennelle>{{cite journal|last=Jennelle|first=Richard L. S.|coauthors=Vijayakumar, Vani, and Vijayakumar, Srinivasan|title=A Systemic and Evidence-Based Approach to the Management of Vertebral Metastasis|journal=ISRN Surg|date=2|year=2011|month=August|volume=2011|doi=10.5402/2011/719715|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> 

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of primary spinal cord tumors is difficult, mainly due to their symptoms, which in early stages mimic more common and benign degenerative spinal diseases. [[MRI]] and [[bone scan]]ning are used for diagnostic purposes. This assesses not only the location of the tumor(s) but also their relationship with the [[spinal cord]] and the risk of cord compression.<ref name=Segal>{{cite journal|last=Segal D|first=Constantini S. C.|coauthors=Korn, Lidar|title=Delay In Disgnosis of Primary Intra Dural Spinal Cord Tumors|journal=Surg Neurol Int 2012;3:52|date=14|year=2012|month=May|doi= 10.4103/2152-7806.96075|accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref>

==Treatment==
* [[Glucocorticoid|Steroids]] (e.g. [[corticosteroids]])<ref name=Ribas></ref> may be administered if there is evidence of [[spinal cord compression]]. These do not affect the tumoral mass itself, but tend to reduce the inflammatory reaction around it, and thus decrease the overall volume of the mass impinging on the spinal cord.
* [[Radiotherapy]] may be administered to patients with malignant tumors. Radiation is usually delivered to the involved segment in the spinal cord as well as to the uninvolved segment above and below the involved segment.<ref name=Ribas></ref>
* [[Surgery]] is sometimes possible. The goals of surgical treatment for spinal tumors can comprise of histologic diagnosis, tumor local control or oncological cure, pain relief, spinal cord decompression and restoration of neurological function, restoration of spine stability, and deformity rectification.<ref name=Ribas></ref>
* The combination of [[Minimally Invasive Surgery]] and [[Radiation]] or [[Chemotherapy]]  is a new, minimally invasive technique, pioneered at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York]] by Dr. Arthur Jenkins *[http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/cancer-spreads-spine-new-operation-cut-hospital-recovery-time-article-1.163951]  This treatment can be tailored to the particular tumor of the [[spine]], either metastatic or primary.

Some suggest that direct decompressive surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy provide better outcomes than treatment with radiotherapy alone for patients with spinal cord compression due to metastatic cancer.<ref name=Patchell>{{cite journal|last=Patchell|first=Dr. Roy A.|coauthors=Tibbs, Phillip A., Regine, William F., Payne, Richard, Saris, Stephen, Kryscio, Richard J., Mohiuddin, Mohammed, and Young, Byron|title=Direct decompressive surgical resection in the treatment of spinal cord compression caused by metastatic cancer: a randomised trial|journal=The Lancet|date=20|year=2005|month=August|volume=366|issue=9486|pages=643–648|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66954-1|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> <ref name=Furlan>{{cite journal|last=Furlan|first=J.C.|coauthors=Chan, K.K., Sandoval, G.A., Lam, K.C., Klinger, C.A., Patchell, R.A., Laporte, A., and Fehlings, M.G.|title=The combined use of surgery and radiotherapy to treat patients with epidural cord compression due to metastatic disease: a cost-utility analysis|journal=Neuro-Oncology|year=2012|month=May|volume=14|issue=5|pages=631–640|doi=10.1093/neuonc/nos062|accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> It is also important to take into consideration the prognosis of the patients and their ambulation status at diagnosis, and treat accordingly.<ref name=Holt></ref>
