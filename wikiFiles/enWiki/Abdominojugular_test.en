The '''abdominojugular test''' (AJR), also known as '''hepatojugular reflux''', is used as an alternate test for measuring [[jugular venous]] [[pressure]] (JVP) through the distension or swelling of the [[internal jugular vein]].  A positive AJR best correlates with the [[pulmonary artery pressure]] and thus is a marker for right heart dysfunction.<ref name="pmid3415106">{{cite journal |author=Ewy G |title=The abdominojugular test: technique and hemodynamic correlates |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=109 |issue=6 |pages=456–60 |year=1988 |pmid=3415106}}</ref>

==Procedure==
The doctor presses firmly over either the [[right upper quadrant (abdomen)|right upper quadrant]] of the abdomen (i.e., over the [[liver]]) or over the center of the abdomen <ref name="pmid3415106"/> for 10–60 seconds with a pressure of 20 to 35&nbsp;mm Hg while observing the [[internal jugular vein]] in the [[neck]] and also observing to be sure the patient does not perform a [[Valsalva maneuver|Valsalva]] maneuver.<ref name="pmid8594245">{{cite journal |author=Cook D, Simel D |title=The Rational Clinical Examination. Does this patient have abnormal central venous pressure? |journal=JAMA |volume=275 |issue=8 |pages=630–4 |year=1996 |pmid=8594245 |doi=10.1001/jama.1996.03530320054034 }}</ref>

On an otherwise healthy individual, the jugular venous pressure remains constant or temporarily rises for a [[Heart rate|heartbeat]] or two, before returning to normal. This ''negative result'' would be indicated by a lack of swelling of the jugular vein. Negative hepatojugular reflux is seen in [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]].

A ''positive result'' is variously defined as either a sustained rise in the JVP of at least 4&nbsp;cm or more <ref name="pmid8594245"/> or a fall of 4&nbsp;cm or more <ref name="pmid3415106"/> after the examiner releases pressure. The AJR has a reported [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of 24% <ref name="pmid2182296">{{cite journal |author=Marantz P, Kaplan M, Alderman M |title=Clinical diagnosis of congestive heart failure in patients with acute dyspnea |journal=Chest |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=776–81 |year=1990 |pmid=2182296 |doi=10.1378/chest.97.4.776}}</ref> to 72% <ref name="pmid3415106"/> and a [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 93% to 96%. The large discrepancy in sensitivity may be explained by the higher value being reported during performance in optimal conditions of a cardiac lab while the lower value was from a study in an emergency room.
