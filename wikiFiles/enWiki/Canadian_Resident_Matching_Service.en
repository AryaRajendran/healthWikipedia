The '''Canadian Resident Matching Service''' (CaRMS) is a national, not-for-profit organization that provides a unique electronic [[matching service]] for [[postgraduate]] medical education training in Canada. CaRMS provides an orderly and transparent process for applicants to decide where to train in Canada and for programs to indicate which applicants they wish to enroll in postgraduate medical training.  

CaRMS administers four matches annually: the Main Residency Match (R-1){{clarify|date=November 2012}}, and three advanced residency matches. These include: the Family Medicine/Emergency Medicine (FM/EM) Match, the Medicine Subspecialty Match (MSM), and the Pediatric Subspecialty Match (PSM). CaRMS also administers the process for Canadian applicants to access the US electronic application system for postgraduate medical training (ERAS).

The R-1 Main Residency Match is open to final year medical students in all 17 Canadian medical schools, as well as prior-year graduates from Canada and the U.S. who meet basic eligibility criteria. The R-1 match is also open to international medical graduates from recognized international medical schools who also meet eligibility requirements. 

The R-1 match is offered in two iterations. To be eligible in the first iteration, graduates must not have had prior postgraduate training in Canada or the United States. The second iteration is for applicants who were not matched in the first iteration, as well as applicants who have had previous Canadian/U.S. postgraduate training (at recognized institutions) and who wish to apply for an R-1 position in Canada. 

A study by Wang et al. (2011) evaluated the factors influencing rank-listing of residency programs by graduating medical students undergoing the R-1 match.<ref>Wang T, Wong B, Huang A, Khatri P, Ng C, Forgie M, Lanphear JH, O'Neill PJ.  Factors affecting residency rank-listing: a Maxdiff survey of graduating Canadian medical students. BMC Med Educ.  2011 Aug; 61(11):1-7</ref>  Program characteristics, such as the variety of clinical experiences and resident morale, were weighed most heavily in terms of overall priority. However, differentiation between the top two choice programs was often influenced by distance to relatives and desirability of the city.
