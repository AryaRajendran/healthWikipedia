The '''International Classification of Primary Care''' ('''ICPC''') is a classification method for [[primary care]] encounters. It allows for the classification of the patientâ€™s [[reason for encounter]] (RFE), the problems/diagnosis managed, primary or general [[health care]] interventions, and the ordering of the data of the primary care session in an episode of care structure. It was developed by the [[WONCA International Classification Committee]] (WICC), and was first published in 1987 by [[Oxford University Press]] (OUP). A revision and inclusion of criteria and definitions was published in 1998. The second revision was accepted within the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) Family of International Classifications.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/adaptations/icpc2/en/ ''International Classification of Primary Care, Second edition (ICPC-2)''.] Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011.</ref>

The classification was developed in a context of increasing demand for quality information on primary care as part of growing worldwide attention to global [[primary health care]] objectives, including the WHO's target of "[[health for all]]".<ref>Bentsen BG. "International classification of primary care." ''Scand J Prim Health Care.'' 1986 Feb;4(1):43-50.</ref>

==History==
The first version of ICPC, which was published in 1987, is referred to as ''ICPC-1''. A subsequent revision which was published in the 1993 publication ''The International Classification of Primary Care in the European Community: With a Multi-Language Layer'' is known as ''ICPC-E''. 

The 1998 publication, of version 2, is referred to as ''ICPC-2''. The [[acronym]] ''ICPC-2-E'', refers to a revised electronic version, which was released in 2000. Subsequent revisions of ICPC-2 are also labelled with a release date.

===Chapters===

The ICPC contains 17 chapters:

* International Classification of Health Problem in Primary Care (ICHPPC-2-d) (1976, 1983)
