The '''pylorus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|p|aɪ|ˈ|l|ɔər|ə|s}} or {{IPAc-en|p|ɨ|ˈ|l|ɔər|ə|s}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πυλωρός, "gate guard") is the region of the [[stomach]] that connects to the [[duodenum]] (the beginning of the small intestines). It is divided into two parts:
* the [[pyloric antrum]], which connects to the body of the stomach.
* the [[pyloric canal]], which connects to the duodenum.

The pyloric [[sphincter]], or [[valve]], is a strong ring of smooth muscle at the end of the pyloric canal which lets food pass from the stomach to the [[duodenum]]. It receives [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] innervation from the [[celiac ganglion]].

The adjectival form of '''pylorus''' is '''pyloric''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|p|aɪ|ˈ|l|ɔər|ɪ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|p|ɨ|ˈ|l|ɔər|ɪ|k}}).

==Clinical significance==
One medical condition associated with the pylorus is [[pyloric stenosis]].<ref>http://www.pyloricspasms.info</ref>  One method of relieving this partial or complete obstruction is the surgical placement of a pyloric stent.  This stent is synthetic tube which maintains patency between the stomach and proximal duodenum.
 
In such conditions as [[stomach cancer]], tumours may partly block the pyloric canal. A special tube can be implanted surgically to connect the stomach to the duodenum so as to facilitate the passage of food from one to the other. This tube is called a [[gastroduodenostomy]].
