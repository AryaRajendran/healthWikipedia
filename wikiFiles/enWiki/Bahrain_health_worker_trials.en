The '''Bahrain health worker trials''' were a series of legal cases in which forty-eight doctors, nurses, and dentists faced charges for their actions during the [[2011-2012 Bahraini uprising]]. In September 2011, twenty of the health workers were convicted by a military court of felonies including "stockpiling weapons" and "plotting to overthrow the government". The remaining twenty-eight were charged with misdemeanors and tried separately.<ref name=PHR /> The following month, the felony sentences were overturned, and it was announced that the defendants would be retried by a civilian court. Retrials began in March 2012, but were postponed until June 14. Convictions against nine of the defendants were quashed and reduced against another nine.<ref name="Reuters 14.6.2012">Samia Nakhoul (14 June 2012).

==Role of health workers in the Bahraini uprising==
Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw sustained pro-democracy protests, centered at [[Pearl Roundabout]] in the capital of [[Manama]], as part of the wider [[Arab Spring]]. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as [[Bloody Thursday (2011)|Bloody Thursday]]), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12490286 |title=Bahrain protests: Police break up Pearl Square crowd |date=17 February 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> 

Health workers played an important role in documenting the injuries, which were at the time downplayed or denied by the [[government of Bahrain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/bahrain-military-court-finds-medics-guilty-2011-09-29 |title=Bahrain military court finds medics guilty |date=29 September 2011 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> [[Rheumatologist]] Fatima Haji, for example, appeared on [[Al Jazeera]] television news in a "hysterical" state, describing Isa Abdul Hasan, a man in his 60s who died in her hospital of a head wound he had received from police: "I just started shouting: 'What the hell did this guy do, he was an old man. What did he do to deserve this?'" She later stated that following her arrest, her interrogations centered on this television appearance.<ref name=AJ212 />

At [[Salmaniya Medical Complex]], doctors joined the protests themselves, speaking to protesters and media from the hospital stairs, after authorities blocked ambulances from bringing injured protesters there for care. The military responded by naming the hospital an opposition stronghold, taking it over and occupying it with masked personnel on 16 March.<ref name=MSF42011>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2011/Bahrain_BP_Final_06042011_2106_FR-EN%20LOGO.pdf |title=Health Services Paralyzed: Bahrain’s Military Crackdown on Patients |date=April 2011 |publisher=Doctors Without Borders |accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref>

==Arrests and charges==
In March and April 2011, twenty health workers were arrested on a variety of felony charges for their actions during the protests, while an additional twenty-eight were arrested for misdemeanors.<ref name=PHR>{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/Bahrain-militarization-may-2012-under-the-gun.pdf |title=Under the Gun: Ongoing Assaults on Bahrain’s Health System |date=May 2012 |publisher=Physicians for Human Rights |accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref> Dr. Ali Al-Ekri was arrested while performing surgery at Salmaniya Medical Complex.<ref name=FLD>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahrainhrd.org/medical_professionals.html |title=Human Rights Defenders at Risk |publisher=Front Line Defenders |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>

Charges against the doctors included "occupying a hospital, stockpiling weapons, spreading lies and false news, inciting hatred of Bahrain's rulers and calling for their overthrow, and withholding treatment of Sunnis". The government additionally alleged that blood from hospital [[blood banks]] had been used to exaggerate wounds, that health workers had transported weapons to the protesters by ambulance,<ref name=Lancet/> and that [[AK-47]]s had been confiscated inside the hospital on a police raid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2011/09/medical-workers-in-bahrain-sentenced-to-up-to-15-years-in-prison.html |title=Medical Workers in Bahrain Sentenced to 15 Years in Prison |author=Talea Miller |date=29 September 2011 |work=PBS Newshour |accessdate=25 May 2012}}</ref> State media described the defendants as having "a terrorist aim".<ref name=AJ229>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119298364868205.html#.ToRfrlwWGd0.facebook |title=Bahrain medical staff sentenced over protests |date=29 September 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>

According to the prosecutor's case, al-Ekri acted as the group's ringleader, organizing staff at Salmaniya to oppose the Bahraini government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/475057 |title=Public Prosecutor’s Statement on Medical Staff Trials |date=2 October 2011 |publisher=Bahrain News Agency |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> Al-Ekri was well known in Bahrain previous to the uprising for a January 2009 trip to the [[Gaza Strip]] to provide aid to Palestinians during the [[Gaza War]]. On his return, he received a number of awards, including one from the king. After his arrest, Al-Ekri stated that he was being persecuted for his comments to the media about police violence: "They know we witnessed all the crimes of the regime and we stood strong by injured people and we talked to the media ...

The defendants denied all charges and maintained that the accusations were politically motivated. In a joint statement, they held that "our only crime was that during the unrest earlier this year, we were outspoken witnesses to the bloodshed and the brutal treatment by the security forces."<ref name=Lancet/> Bahraini MP Jamal Fakhro responded that Bahrain jails only "people who prefer to play politics rather than be doctors", not "doctors who treat people".<ref name=AJ111>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/10/201110183947769184.html |title=Bahrain says charged medics 'attempted coup' |date=1 October 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> A spokesman for Bahrain's Information Affairs Authority stated that the health workers were fabricating their stories and that they were "collaborating with the hard liners" in "an attempted coup d'etat".<ref name=AJ111/>

How could these fine medical men and women have been trying to "topple" the monarchy? The idea that these 48 defendants are guilty of such a vicious charge is not just preposterous.

A [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry|government-appointed commission of inquiry]] composed of international figures supported the government account that medics occupied the first floor of Salmaniya hospital. However it rejected the claim that medics had supplied protesters with weapons and concluded that evidence supporting alleges that medics denied patients of health care was "hardly conclusive," as paraphrased by [[Al Jazeera English]].<ref name="AJE 1.10.2012">[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/10/201210195911177809.html "Bahrain court upholds verdict in medics trial"].

== Reactions ==

=== Domestic ===

==== Bahrain government supporters ====

Many Sunnis supporting the government of Bahrain stood against the doctors, accusing them of "deliberately worsening patient injuries for cameras" as well as "causing the deaths of protesters in order to discredit security personnel".<ref name="Reuters 14.6.2012"/> The government-appointed commission's report said that some of the Shia health workers refused to treat Sunni patients and instead used their positions to support activists by promoting their causes.<ref name="VOA 16.6.2012"/>

==== Doctors ====

Doctor Ghassan Daif gave credit to the international pressure for easing the sentences and demanded dropping all the remaining charges. "I'm sure more continuous pressure from the international community will [result] in acquitting all the medics and clear up this case", he added.<ref name="VOA 16.6.2012"/>
