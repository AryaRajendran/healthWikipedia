==Causes==
There are many causes of neurodevelopmental disorder, which can range from deprivation, [[genetic disease|genetic]] and [[metabolic disease]]s, immune disorders, [[infectious disease]]s, [[nutrition]]al factors, [[physical trauma]], and toxic and environmental factors.

Some neurodevelopmental disorders—such as [[autism]] and other [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s—are considered multifactorial [[syndrome]]s (with many causes but more specific neurodevelopmental manifestation).<ref name=samaco1>{{cite journal |author=Samaco RC, Hogart A, LaSalle JM |title=Epigenetic overlap in autism-spectrum neurodevelopmental disorders: MECP2 deficiency causes reduced expression of UBE3A and GABRB3 |journal=Hum. Mol.

===Deprivation===
{{main|Maternal deprivation|Sensory deprivation}}
Infants and children require loving [[emotional]] [[nurture]] from caregivers—there is a spectrum of problems arising from the lack of it. The most severe deprivation disorder, [[hospitalism]], was described in 1897 as a wasting away to the point of death.<ref name=Crandall>{{cite journal |last=Crandall |first=Floyd M. |title=Hospitalism |journal=Archives of Pediatrics |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=448–54 |month=June |year=1897 |url=http://www.neonatology.org/classics/crandall.html |accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> A sublethal form, [[anaclitic depression]] was first described by [[René Spitz]] in the 1940s. It occurred in infants over the age of six&nbsp;months who suffered the loss of their mothers, who then became depressed and showed behavioral [[Mental retardation|retardation]] (delay in reaching developmental milestones, especially as related to social behaviors).<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anaclitic+depression definition of Anaclitic depression]</ref> Behavioral retardation, as in the [[reactive attachment disorder]]s, has been observed in emotionally deprived children living with their families.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coleman RW, Provence S |title=Environmental retardation (hospitalism) in infants living in families |journal=Pediatrics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=285–92 |date=1 February 1957|pmid=13400604 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/2/285 }}</ref><ref name=newman1>{{cite journal |author=Newman L, Mares S |title=Recent advances in the theories of and interventions with attachment disorders |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=343–8 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17551348 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3281bc0d08 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559998_print}}</ref> However, prominent modern thought attributes other causative mechanisms to autism and autistic spectrum disorders. (see [[Autism]])

However, nurture is not the only cause of deprivation that leads to neurodevelopmental [[wikt:sequella|sequellae]]. A common example of sensory deprivation due to biologic factors is [[blindness]]. Blind infants are at risk for poor developmental outcomes that if left untreated can lead to severe, autistic-like behaviors.<ref name=sonksen1>{{cite journal |author=Sonksen PM, Dale N |title=Visual impairment in infancy: impact on neurodevelopmental and neurobiological processes |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |volume=44 |issue=11 |pages=782–91 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12418621 |doi=10.1017/S0012162201002936 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0012-1622&date=2002&volume=44&issue=11&spage=782}}</ref> Despite its biologic basis, caregivers can [[wikt:amelioration|ameliorate]] blindness-related sensory deprivation.<ref name=warren1>{{cite book |author=Warren, David H. |title=Blindness and children: an individual differences approach |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1994 |pages=323–30 |isbn=0-521-45719-X}}</ref> This can lead to positive neurodevelopmental outcome, as in the cases of author [[Helen Keller]],<ref name=keller1>{{cite book |author=Keller, Helen |title=The story of my life (100th Anniversary Edition) (Signet Classics (Paperback)) |publisher=Signet Classics |year=2002 |isbn=0-451-52825-5 |accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref> who was trained in the use of [[tactile]] [[sign language]], and musicians such as [[Doc Watson|Arthel "Doc" Watson]]<ref name=miller1>{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Dan |title=Doc Watson: flatpicking legend |work=Featured Artist |publisher=Flatpicking Guitar Magazine |date=October 2–8, 2000 |url=http://www.flatpick.com/Pages/Featured_Artist/Doc.html |accessdate = 2008-08-17}}</ref> and [[Ray Charles]] who remained emotionally connected to others via their sense of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]].

===Genetic disorders===
{{main|Genetic disorder}}
[[Image:Child piggyback2.jpg|thumb|right|A child with Down syndrome]]
A prominent example of a genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder is [[Trisomy]] 21, also known as [[Down syndrome]]. This disorder usually results from an extra [[chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]], although in uncommon instances it is related to other [[chromosome abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]] such as [[Down syndrome#Robertsonian translocation|translocation]] of the genetic material. It is characterized by short [[stature]], epicanthal ([[eyelid]]) folds, abnormal [[fingerprint]]s, and [[Simian crease|palm prints]], [[Congenital heart disease|heart defects]], poor [[muscle tone]] (delay of neurological development) and [[mental retardation]] (delay of intellectual development).<ref name=Down1/>

Less commonly known genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorders include [[Fragile X syndrome]], [[Rett syndrome]], and [[Williams syndrome]]. Fragile X syndrome was first described in 1943 by J.P. Martin and J. Bell, studying persons with family history of [[Sex linkage|sex-linked]] "mental defects".<ref name=Martin1>{{cite journal |author=Martin JP, Bell J |title=A pedigree of mental defect showing sex-linkage |journal=J.

===Immune dysfunction===
{{main|Immune-mediated disease}}
Immune reactions during pregnancy, both maternal and of the developing child can produce neurodevelopmental disorders. One typical immune reaction in infants and children is [[PANDAS]],<ref name="Pavone1">{{cite journal |author=Pavone, P. |title=Anti-brain antibodies in PANDAS versus uncomplicated streptococcal infection|journal=Pediatr Neurol |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=107–110|year=2004 |pmid=14984902 |doi=10.1016/S0887-8994(03)00413-2 |display-authors=1 |last2=Bianchini |first2=R |last3=Parano |first3=E |last4=Incorpora |first4=G |last5=Rizzo |first5=R |last6=Mazzone |first6=L |last7=Trifiletti |first7=RR}}</ref> or ''Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infection'' produce abnormal movements of the body, emotional disturbance and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] symptoms.<ref name="Dale1">{{cite journal |author=Dale, RC. |title=Incidence of anti-brain antibodies in children with obsessive–compulsive disorder |journal=Brit J Psychiatry |volume=187 |pages=314–319| year=2005 |pmid=16199788 |doi=10.1192/bjp.187.4.314 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/187/4/314 |accessdate=2008-08-17 |issue=4 |display-authors=1 |last2=Heyman |first2=I |last3=Giovannoni |first3=G |last4=Church |first4=AW}}</ref> Another disorder is [[Sydenham's chorea]], which results in more abnormal movements of the body and fewer psychological sequellae. Both are immune reactions against brain tissue that follow infection by ''[[Streptococcus]]'' bacteria. (Susceptibility to these immune diseases may be genetically determined,<ref name="swedo1">{{cite web |last=Swedo |first=Susan E |title=Genetics of childhood disorders: XXXIII autoimmunity part 6: poststreptoccoal autoimmunity |work=Reprinted from J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 40:12,1479-1482 |month=December |year=2001 |url=http://www.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/plomdevelop/genetics/01decgen.htm |accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref> so sometimes several family members may suffer from one or both of them following an [[epidemic]] of Strep infection.)

===Infectious diseases===
{{main|Infectious disease}}
A number of infectious diseases can be transmitted either congenitally or in early childhood, and can cause serious neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia.<ref name="brown1">{{cite web |url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/32/2/200 |title=Prenatal infection as a risk factor for schizophrenia – Brown 32 (2): 200 – Schizophrenia Bulletin |accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref> Congenital [[Toxoplasmosis#Pregnancy precautions|toxoplasmosis]] may result in formation of cysts in the brain and other organs, causing a variety of neurological deficits. [[Congenital syphilis]] may progress to [[Syphilis#Neurosyphilis|neurosyphilis]] if it remains untreated. [[Measles]] can progress to [[subacute sclerosing panencephalitis]]. [[Congenital rubella syndrome]] can produce [[schizophrenia]] in addition to multiple other symptoms.

===Metabolic disorders===
{{main|Metabolism|Diabetes mellitus|Inborn error of metabolism}}
Metabolic disorders, present in either the mother or the child, can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Two examples are [[diabetes mellitus]] (a [[Genetic disorder#Multifactorial and polygenic disorders|multifactorial disorder]]) and [[phenylketonuria]] (an [[inborn error of metabolism]]). Many such inherited diseases may directly affect the child's [[metabolism]] and neural development<ref name="richardson1">{{Cite journal |last=Richardson |first=A.J. |last2=Ross |first2=M.A. |title=Fatty acid metabolism in neurodevelopmental disorder: a new perspective on associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and the autistic spectrum |journal= Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids |volume=63 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–9 |date=July 2000 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WPH-45BCP10-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4a168193b6c6acc3a36be28198f9bc00 |doi=10.1054/plef.2000.0184 |pmid=10970706}}</ref> but less commonly they can indirectly affect the child during [[gestation]]. (See also [[teratology]]).

In the child, [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] can produce neurodevelopmental damage by the effects of excessive or insufficient [[glucose]]. The problems continue and may worsen throughout childhood if the diabetes is not well controlled.<ref name="nordham1">{{Cite journal |last=Nordham |first=Elizabeth A |last2=et al. |title=Neuropsychological Profiles of Children With Type 1 Diabetes 6 Years After Disease Onset |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=1541–1546 |year=2001 |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/9/1541 |doi=10.2337/diacare.24.9.1541 |pmid=11522696 |first2=PJ |last3=Jacobs |first3=R |last4=Hughes |first4=M |last5=Warne |first5=GL |last6=Werther |first6=GA }}</ref> [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]] may be preceded in its onset by impaired cognitive functioning.<ref name="olsson1">{{Cite journal |last=Olsson |first=Gunilla M. |last2=et al. |title=Cognitive Function in Children and Subsequent Type 2 Diabetes: Response to Batty, Gale, and Deary |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=514–516 |year=2008 |url=http://mail.turkiye-klinikleri.com/cgi/content/full/31/3/514 |doi=10.2337/dc07-1399 |pmid=18083794 |first2=AL |last3=Montgomery |first3=SM |pmc=2453642}}</ref>

However a non-diabetic [[fetus]] can also be subjected to [[glucose]] effects if its mother has undetected [[gestational diabetes]]. Maternal diabetes causes excessive birth size, making it harder for the infant to pass through the birth canal without injury or it can directly produce early neurodevelopmental deficits. However usually the neurodevelopmental symptoms decrease in later childhood.<ref name=Ornoy1>{{cite journal |author=Ornoy A, Wolf A, Ratzon N, Greenbaum C, Dulitzky M |title=Neurodevelopmental outcome at early school age of children born to mothers with gestational diabetes |journal=Arch.

[[Phenylketonuria]], also known as PKU is an [[inborn error of metabolism]] that can induce neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Children with PKU require a strict diet to prevent mental retardation and other disorders. In the maternal form of [[Phenylketonuria|PKU]], excessive maternal [[phenylalanine]] can be absorbed by the fetus even if the fetus has not inherited the disease. This can produce mental retardation and other disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee PJ, Ridout D, Walter JH, Cockburn F |title=Maternal phenylketonuria: report from the United Kingdom Registry 1978–97 |journal=Arch.

===Nutrition===
{{main|Nutrition disorder}}
Nutritional deficits may cause neurodevelopmental disorders, such as [[spina bifida]], which is common, and [[anencephaly]], which is rare. Both disorders are [[neural tube defects]] with malformation and dysfunction of the [[nervous system]] and its supporting structures, leading to serious physical disability as well as its emotional sequellae. The most common nutritional cause of neural tube defects is maternal deficiency of [[folic acid]], a B vitamin usually found in [[fruits]], [[vegetables]], [[whole grains]], and [[milk]] products.<ref name=marchdimes1>{{cite web |url=http://www.marchofdimes.com/professionals/14332_1151.asp |title=Folic Acid - March of Dimes}}</ref><ref name=vegetables1>{{cite web |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/5000/5553.html |title=Folate (Folacin, Folic Acid)}}</ref> (Neural tube defects are also caused by medications and other environmental causes, many of which interfere with folate metabolism, thus they are considered to have multifactorial causes.)<ref name=Folate1>{{cite web |work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Folic scid: topic home |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/ | accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref><ref name=Folate2>{{cite web |work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=The basics about spina bifida |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/ |accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> Another deficiency, [[iodine deficiency]], produces a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders from mild emotional disturbance to severe mental retardation. (see also [[cretinism]])

Excesses in both maternal and infant diets may cause disorders as well, with foods or food supplements proving toxic in large amounts. For instance in 1973 K.L. Jones and D.W. Smith of the [[University of Washington]] Medical School in [[Seattle]] found a pattern of "craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal onset growth deficiency and developmental delay" in children of [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] mothers. This disorder, now called [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], has significant symptom overlap with several other entirely unrelated neurodevelopmental disorders.<ref name=CDC2>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fas/publications/FAS_guidelines_accessible.pdf Fetal alcohol syndrome: guidelines for referral and diagnosis (PDF).] CDC (July 2004). Retrieved on 2007-04-11</ref> It has been discovered that iron supplementation in [[baby formula]] is linked to lowered [[I.Q.]] and other neurodevelopmental delays.<ref name=Kerr1>{{cite news |last=Kerr |first=Martha |coauthors=Désirée Lie |title=Neurodevelopmental delays associated with iron-fortified formula for healthy infants |work=Medscape Psychiatry and Mental Health |year=2008 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/574363 |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

===Trauma===
{{main|Traumatic brain injury}}
[[Image:Epidural hematoma.png|thumb|right|[[CT scan]] showing [[epidural hematoma]], a type of traumatic brain injury (upper left)]]
Brain trauma in the developing human is a common cause (over 400,000 injuries per year in the US alone, without clear information as to how many produce developmental sequellae)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/tbi/FactSheets/Facts_About_TBI.pdf |format=PDF |title=Facts About TBI |accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref> of neurodevelopmental syndromes. It may be subdivided into two major categories, [[Cerebral palsy|congenital injury]] (including injury resulting from otherwise uncomplicated premature birth)<ref name="Murray1"/> and injury occurring in infancy or childhood. Common causes of congenital injury are [[asphyxia]] (obstruction of the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]]), [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (lack of oxygen to the brain) and the [[physical trauma|mechanical trauma]] of the [[childbirth|birth process]] itself.

In industrial nations, the most common causes of childhood brain trauma are overwhelmingly falls and transportation-related incidents.<ref name="12statesTBI">{{cite journal |title=Incidence rates of hospitalization related to traumatic brain injury—12 states, 2002 |journal=MMWR Morb.

===Toxic and environmental factors===
{{main|Environmental toxins and fetal development}}
Prenatal exposure to any amount of alcohol can result in [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]], particularly Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND). One well known environmental toxic cause of neurodevelopmental disorders is [[heavy metal poisoning]], with a prominent 20th&nbsp;century example being [[Minamata disease]]. Developmental [[mercury poisoning]] can cause a spectrum of problems from mild impairment of emotional development to the full blown syndrome of [[nerve]] damage, [[visual impairment]], impaired coordination, and [[ambulation]], [[hallucinations]], mental retardation, [[depression (mood)|depression]], and death. However other metals such as [[lead]], [[manganese]], [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]] and [[iron]], as well as prenatal exposure to [[pesticides]], [[tobacco]], and other environmental toxins are also implicated as causative factors.<ref name=CEHC1>{{cite web |work=Children's Environmental Health Centers (CEHCs) |title=Autism and neurodevelopmental disorders |publisher=U.S. Environmental Health Agency |url=http://epa.gov/ncer/childrenscenters/autism.html|accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>
