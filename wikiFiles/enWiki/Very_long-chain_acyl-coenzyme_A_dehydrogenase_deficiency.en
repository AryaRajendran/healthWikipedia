'''Very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD)''' is a [[fatty acid oxidation disorder]] which prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food. 

Those affected by this disorder have inadequate levels of an enzyme that breaks down a group of fats called very long-chain fatty acids.

==Diagnosis==
Typically, initial signs and symptoms of this disorder occur during infancy and include low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]), lack of energy ([[lethargy]]), and [[muscle]] weakness. There is also a high risk of complications such as [[liver]] abnormalities and life-threatening [[heart]] problems. Symptoms that begin later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood tend to be milder and usually do not involve heart problems. Episodes of very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting, illness, and exercise.

It is common for babies and children with the early and childhood types of [[VLCADD]] to have episodes of illness called metabolic crises. Some of the first symptoms of a metabolic crisis are: extreme sleepiness, behavior changes, irritable mood, poor appetite.
Some of these other symptoms of [[VLCADD]] in infants may also follow: [[fever]], [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], [[vomiting]], [[hypoglycemia]].

==Treatment==
If a metabolic crisis is not treated, a child with [[VLCADD]] can develop: breathing problems, seizures, [[coma]], sometimes leading to death.

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]]

Mutations in the ''[[ACADVL]]'' [[gene]] lead to inadequate levels of an enzyme called very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase. Without this enzyme, very long-chain fatty acids from food and fats stored in the body cannot be degraded and processed. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted into energy, which can lead to characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder, such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Levels of very long-chain fatty acids or partially degraded fatty acids may build up in tissues and can damage the heart, liver, and muscles, causing more serious complications.
