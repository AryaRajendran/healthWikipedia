'''Thymoma''' is a [[tumor]] originating from the [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[thymus]]. Thymoma is an uncommon tumor, best known for its association with the neuromuscular disorder [[myasthenia gravis]].<ref name=Thomas1999>{{cite journal |author=Thomas CR, Wright CD, Loehrer PJ |title=Thymoma: state of the art |journal=J.

Oncol. |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=2280–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10561285 |doi=}}</ref> Thymoma is found in  15% of patients with [[myasthenia gravis]].<ref name="isbn1-4160-2973-7">{{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Robbins basic pathology |edition= |language= |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |location= |year=2007 |origyear= |pages= |quote= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the rare case of a malignant tumor, [[chemotherapy]] may be used.

==Signs and symptoms==
A third of all people with a thymoma have symptoms caused by compression of the surrounding organs by an expansive mass. These problems may take the form of [[superior vena cava syndrome]], [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing), [[cough]], or [[chest pain]].<ref name=Thomas1999/>

One-third of patients have their tumors discovered because they have an associated [[autoimmune disorder]]. As mentioned earlier, the most common of those conditions is [[myasthenia gravis]] (MG); 10–15% of patients with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include [[pure red cell aplasia]] and Good's syndrome (thymoma with [[combined immunodeficiency]] and [[hypogammaglobulinemia]]). Other reported disease associations are with [[acute pericarditis]], [[Addison's disease]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[alopecia areata]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Cushing's disease]], [[hemolytic anemia]], [[limbic encephalopathy]], [[myocarditis]], [[nephrotic syndrome]], [[panhypopituitarism]], [[pernicious anemia]], [[polymyositis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[scleroderma]], sensorimotor radiculopathy, ''[[stiff person syndrome]]'', [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] and [[thyroiditis]].<ref name=Thomas1999/>

One-third to one-half of all persons with thymoma have no symptoms at all, and the mass is identified on a [[chest X-ray]] or [[CT scan|CT/CAT scan]] performed for an unrelated problem.<ref name=Thomas1999/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Anterior mediastinal mass thymoma diagram.jpg|thumb|[[CT scan]] of the chest revealing a large [[necrosis|necrotic]] mass in the left [[anterior]] [[mediastinum]] (indicated by the red line). [[Histology]] later established the diagnosis of a thymoma.]]
[[Image:Tumor Thymoma1.JPG|thumb|Another axial slice of a [[CT scan]] of the chest showing a small thymoma anterior to the heart (marked with the red line).]]

When a thymoma is suspected, a [[Computed axial tomography|CT/CAT scan]] is generally performed to estimate the size and extent of the tumor, and the lesion is sampled with a CT-guided needle [[biopsy]]. Increased vascular enhancement on CT scans can be indicative of malignancy, as can be pleural deposits.<ref name=Thomas1999/>  Limited biopsies are associated with a very small risk of [[pneumomediastinum]] or [[mediastinitis]] and an even-lower risk of damaging the [[heart]] or large blood vessels. The diagnosis is made via histologic examination by a pathologist, after obtaining a tissue sample of the mass.  Final tumor classification and staging is accomplished pathologically after formal surgical removal of the thymic tumor

Selected laboratory tests can be used to look for associated problems or possible tumor spread. These include: [[full blood count]], [[protein electrophoresis]], [[antibodies]] to the [[acetylcholine receptor]] (indicative of myasthenia), [[electrolyte]]s, [[liver enzyme]]s and [[renal function]].<ref name=Thomas1999/>

==Pathology==
Thymoma originates from the [[epithelium|epithelial]] cell population in the thymus, and several microscopic subtypes are now recognized.<ref name=Thomas1999/> There are three principal histological types of thymoma, depending on the appearance of the cells by microscopy:

* Type A if the epithelial cells have an oval or fusiform shape (less lymphocyte count);
* Type B if they have an epithelioid shape (Type B has three subtypes: B1 (lymphocyte-rich), B2 (cortical) and B3 (epithelial).);<ref>Dadmanesh F, Sekihara T, Rosai J. Histologic typing of thymoma according to the new World Health Organization classification. ''Chest Surg Clin N Am'' 2001; 11: 407–420.</ref>
* Type AB if the tumor contains a combination of both cell types.

Thymic cortical epithelial cells have abundant cytoplasm, vesicular nucleus with finely divided chromatin and small nucleoli and cytoplasmic filaments contact adjacent cells.
thymic medullary epithelial cells in contrast are spindle shaped with oval dense nucleus and scant cytoplasm
thymoma if recapitulates cortical cell features more, is thought to be less benign.

==Staging==
The Masaoka Staging System is used widely and is based on the anatomic extent of disease at the time of surgery:<ref name="pmid7296496">{{cite journal |author=Masaoka A, Monden Y, Nakahara K, Tanioka T |title=Follow-up study of thymomas with special reference to their clinical stages |journal=Cancer |volume=48 |issue=11 |pages=2485–92 |year=1981 |pmid=7296496 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112678301/PDFSTART |format=PDF |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19811201)48:11<2485::AID-CNCR2820481123>3.0.CO;2-R}}</ref>

* I:   Completely encapsulated
* IIA: Microscopic invasion through the capsule into surrounding fatty tissue
* IIB: Macroscopic invasion into capsule
* III: Macroscopic invasion into adjacent organs
* IVA: Pleural or pericardial implants
* IVB: Lymphogenous or hematogenous metastasis to distant (extrathoracic) sites

==Treatment==
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for thymoma. If the tumor is apparently invasive and large, preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may be used to decrease the size and improve resectability, before surgery is attempted. When the tumor is an early stage (Masaoka I through IIB), no further therapy is necessary. Removal of the thymus in adults does not appear to induce [[immune deficiency]]. In children, however, postoperative immunity may be abnormal and vaccinations for several infectious agents are recommended. Invasive thymomas may require additional treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy ([[cyclophosphamide]], [[doxorubicin]] and [[cisplatin]]).<ref name=Thomas1999/>{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is much worse for stage III or IV thymomas as compared with stage I and II tumors.  Invasive thymomas uncommonly can also [[metastasis|metastasize]], generally to [[pleura]], [[bone]]s, [[liver]] or [[Human brain|brain]] in approximately 7% of cases.<ref name=Thomas1999/>  Patients with stage III and IV tumors may nonetheless survive for several years with appropriate oncological management.

Patients who have undergone thymectomy for thymoma should be warned of possible severe side effects after yellow fever vaccination. This is probably caused by inadequate T-cell response to live attenuated yellow fever vaccine. Deaths have been reported.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Epidemiology==
Men and women are equally affected by thymomas. The typical age at diagnosis is 30–40, although cases have been described in every age group, including children.<ref name=Thomas1999/>
