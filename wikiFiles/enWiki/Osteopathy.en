'''Osteopathy''' is a philosophy and form of [[alternative medicine|alternative healthcare]] which emphasizes the interrelationship between [[human musculoskeletal system|structure]] and [[disease|function]] of the [[human body|body]], as well as the body's ability to heal itself. Osteopaths claim to facilitate the healing process, principally by the practice of manual and manipulative therapy.<ref name="glossary">{{cite web | url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/Documents/GOT2011ed.pdf | title=Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology | work=Educational Council on Osteopathic Principles (ECOP) | publisher=[[American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine]] (AACOM)|date=November 2011|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref> 

Several international and national organizations exist relating to osteopathic education and political advocacy.  One such organization, the World Osteopathic Health Organization (WOHO),<ref>{{cite web|last=Comeaux |first=Zachary |url=http://www.woho.org/ |title=World Osteopathic Health Organization – World Osteopathic Health Organization |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> permits individual membership by both "restricted scope manual therapist" osteopaths and "full scope of medical practice" osteopathic physicians.  Similarly, there is also an international organization of organizations for national osteopathic and osteopathic medical associations, statutory regulators, and universities/medical schools offering osteopathic and osteopathic medical education, known as the Osteopathic International Alliance (OIA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oialliance.org/ |title=Osteopathic International Alliance |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>

The scope of practice of osteopathic practitioners varies by country. To avoid confusion, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] recommends using the terms ''[[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic physician]]'' (U.S. trained only) and ''osteopathic medicine'' to distinguish individuals trained in [[osteopathic medicine in the United States]] from ''osteopaths'' trained in ''osteopathy'', the restricted-scope form of practice outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Resolution301_A2010_FinalVersion.pdf | title=House of Delegates Resolution H-301 – RE: H229-A/05 Osteopath & Osteopathy – Use of the Terms}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=26191 |title=Crosby J.

Medical physicians may go on to qualify as an osteopath and vice-versa. 

The use of osteopathy is not always based on science, and there is little evidence that osteopathy is effective in treating any medical condition other than lower back pain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=37409 |title=Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment |publisher=NYU Langone Medical Center |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="NHS_osteopathy">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Osteopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Osteopathy – NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Andrew Taylor Still#Osteopathy|l1=Andrew Taylor Still: Osteopathy}}
The practice of osteopathy began in the United States in 1874. The term "osteopathy" was coined by [[Andrew Taylor Still]], MD, DO. Still was a physician and surgeon,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&CISOPTR=693&REC=1 |title='&#39;Medical Registration for Macon County, MO as of March 27, 1874,'&#39; Missouri Digital Heritage, Secretary of State of Missouri |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|{{cite web |url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&CISOPTR=759&CISOBOX=1&REC=2 |title=Medical registration for Adair County, MO dated 28 July 1883 |publisher=Missouri Digital Heritage, Secretary of State of Missouri}}}} Kansas state and territorial legislator,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&CISOPTR=685&REC=2 |title='&#39;Six Survivors of First Free State Legislature in Kansas, Topeka Daily Capital'&#39;, Missouri's Digital Heritage, Secretary of State of Missouri |publisher=Cdm.sos.mo.gov |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> a [[Slave and free states|free state]] leader,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdm.sos.mo.gov/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/atsu&CISOPTR=670&REC=1 |title=Charles E.

==Osteopathic principles==
The osteopathic medical philosophy is defined as the concept of health care that embraces the concept of the unity of the living organism's structure (anatomy) and function (physiology). The following are the four major principles of osteopathic medicine:<ref name="glossary"/>

# The body is a unit. An integrated unit of mind, body, and spirit ("Man is Triune" – A.T. Still<ref>{{cite book |author=Still, A.T. |title=The philosophy and mechanical principles of osteopathy |publisher=American Academy of Osteopathy |year=1902 |isbn=978-99926-967-1-2 |page=16}}</ref>)
# The body possesses [[Homeostasis|self-regulatory mechanisms]], having the inherent capacity to defend, repair, and remodel itself
# Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated
# Rational therapy is based on consideration of the first three principles
These principles are not held by osteopathic physicians to be [[Scientific law|empirical laws]]; they serve, rather, as the underpinnings of the osteopathic philosophy on health and disease.

==Techniques of osteopathic treatment==
{{Main|Osteopathic manipulative medicine}}
Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT in the U.S. or simply "osteopathic treatment" elsewhere) is the therapeutic application of manually guided forces by an osteopathic physician (U.S. usage) to improve physiologic function and/or support homeostasis that has been altered by [[somatic dysfunction]].<ref name="glossary"/> Somatic dysfunction is defined as impaired or altered function of related components of the somatic (body framework) system: skeletal, arthrodial and myofascial structures and their related vascular, lymphatic and neural elements. Acute somatic dysfunction is an immediate or short-term impairment or altered function of related  components of the somatic (body) framework. It is characterized in early stages by vasodilation, oedema, tenderness, pain, and tissue contraction. It is diagnosed by history and palpatory assessment of tenderness, asymmetry of motion and relative position, restriction of motion and tissue texture change.<ref name="glossary"/>  Chronic somatic dysfunction is the impairment or altered function of related components of the somatic (body framework) system. It may be characterized by tenderness, itching, fibrosis, paresthesias, and tissue contraction.<ref name="glossary"/>

While there are many treatment techniques, OMT methods utilized may broadly be classified as active or passive and direct or indirect in nature.<ref name="glossary"/>
*''Active Method:'' A technique in which the person voluntarily performs an osteopathic practitioner-directed motion.
*''Passive Method:'' Based on techniques in which the patient refrains from voluntary muscle contraction.
*''Direct Method (D/DIR):'' An osteopathic treatment strategy by which the restrictive barrier is engaged and a final activating force is applied to correct somatic dysfunction.
*''Indirect Method (I/IND):'' A manipulative technique where the restrictive barrier is disengaged and the dysfunctional body part is moved away from the restrictive barrier until tissue tension is equal in one or all planes and directions

===Scope of manual therapies===
A small subdivision of UK osteopathic practitioners are known as "classical osteopaths". They follow teachings of John Martin Littlejohn and John Wernham. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They refer to their practice as a style of whole or "total" body adjustment. They contend that structural strains and patterns, through effects on circulation, reflexes and sensory feedback, precede pathological tissue states due to the downrating of for example arterial microcirculation or lymphatic drainage. They claim that the treatment lead to successful patient outcomes in a great number of functional and pathological disorders, including infections and degenerative conditions. Traditionally, great emphasis is put on the clearance of the products of metabolism.  The approach is contentious even within osteopathy, in a similar way to cranial osteopathy.

==Research==
Several large studies in the U.K. have produced evidence that demonstrates positive clinical and cost effectiveness of manipulation in the management of lower back pain, the latest being the U.K. Back pain Exercise And Manipulation (UK BEAM) trial. The physical manipulation condition of the U.K. BEAM trial involved "... a package of techniques representative of those used by the U.K. chiropractic, osteopathic, and physiotherapy professions."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.38282.669225.AE |title=United Kingdom back pain exercise and manipulation (UK BEAM) randomised trial: Effectiveness of physical treatments for back pain in primary care |year=2004 |journal=BMJ |volume=329 |issue=7479 |page=1377 |pmid=15556955 |last1=Uk Beam Trial |first1=Team |pmc=535454}}</ref>
 
In a 2005 [[meta-analysis]] and [[systematic review]] of six [[randomized controlled trials]] of [[Osteopathic manipulative medicine|osteopathic manipulative treatment]] (OMT) that involved blinded assessments of lower back pain in ambulatory settings, it was concluded that OMT significantly reduces [[low back pain]], and that the level of pain reduction is greater than expected from [[placebo]] effects alone and persists for at least three months.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2474-6-43 |year=2005 |last1=Licciardone |first1=John C |last2=Brimhall |first2=Angela K |last3=King |first3=Linda N |journal=BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders |volume=6 |page=43 |pmid=16080794 |title=Osteopathic manipulative treatment for low back pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |pmc=1208896}}</ref> A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials concluded that existing evidence suggests that OMT may improve [[lower urinary tract symptoms]] in adult women such as [[urinary incontinence]] (involuntary leakage of urine), [[nocturia]] (waking up at night to urinate), and [[urinary hesitancy]], but called for further study with additional large, rigorous randomized controlled trials.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23294678|last1=Franke|first1=H|last2=Hoesele|first2=K |title=Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in women.|journal=Journal of bodywork and movement therapies |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=11–18 |year=2013 |pmid=23294678 | doi =10.1016/j.jbmt.2012.05.001}}</ref>

==Criticism==
According to the [[National Health Service (England)|U.K. National Health Service]], the use of osteopathy is not always based on science, and there is no good evidence that osteopathy is effective for any health condition other than back pain and helping recovery after hip or knee operations. There is no good evidence that osteopathy is an effective treatment for asthma, painful periods, shoulder pain, headaches or migraines, sinusitis, stress or depression, even though it is sometimes used for these conditions.<ref name="NHS_osteopathy"/>

==Osteopathy around the world==
The osteopathic profession has evolved into two branches, non-physician manual medicine osteopaths and full scope of medical practice [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic physicians]]. These groups are so distinct that in practice they function as separate professions. In recent years, the profession has actively attempted to enhance exchange and dialogue between them. The regulation of non-physician manual medicine osteopaths varies greatly between jurisdictions.  In Australia, the UK, and New Zealand the non-physician manual medicine osteopaths are regulated by statute and practice requires registration with the relevant regulatory authority.  In Canada the Canadian Manual Osteopathy Examining Board administers osteopathic board exams. The International Osteopathy Examining Board (IOEB) administers osteopathic board exams in countries without one such as China, Brazil, India, Iran, Mexico, & Germany. The Osteopathic International Alliance has a country guide with details of registration and practice rights and the International Osteopathic Association has a list of all accredited osteopathic colleges.<ref>{{cite web|title=Directories|url=Http://www.oialliance.org/directories.htm|publisher=Osteopathic International Alliance|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> In certain countries such as Canada and the USA they may not provide diagnosis as this is a regulated act.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Wickless, Larry | title = The Osteopathic International Alliance: Unification of the Osteopathic Profession | publisher = Osteopathic International Alliance Steering Committee | url=http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/oia_article_triad0905.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =19 September 2006}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}
Since 2010 the number of European style osteopaths has increased exponentially worldwide largely due to National Academy of Osteopathy offering an online diploma program in osteopathic manual practice.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In 2012, the National University of Medical Sciences located in Madrid, Spain has started offering an online Doctor of Osteopathy, Master of Science in Osteopathy, Master of Art in History of Osteopathy, PhD in Osteopathic Clinical Rehabilitation, MSc in Geriatric Osteopathy, MSc in Pediatric Osteopathy, MSc in Osteopathic Radiology, and a Bachelor of Science in Osteopathy degree program worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.numss.com/DO.html |title=An Overview of NUMSS Admissions to Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) Program |author= |year= |work= |publisher=National University of Medical Sciences |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.numss.com/BSc.html |title=An Overview of NUMSS Admissions to Bachelor of Science in Osteopathy (BSc) Program |author= |year= |work= |publisher=National University of Medical Sciences |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>

''Osteopaths'' are primary contact health professionals who, in their own practice, make independent judgments in the examination, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and care of conditions of the human body to the extent of their individual competence.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Osteopaths work in private practice, and the majority of private health insurance providers cover treatment performed by osteopaths.<ref>[http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/australia_osteopathy.pdf ''Osteopathy in Australia,'' Osteopathic International Alliance.

Manual (non-medical) osteopathy (also known as European style osteopathy, traditional osteopathy or osteopathic manual practice) is not a regulated profession in Canada yet but the profession is working actively to get manual osteopathy regulated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/canada_osteopathy.pdf |title=Osteopathic  International Alliance Statement Regarding Non-physician Osteopaths in Canada |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> The Canadian Manual Osteopathy Examining Board (CMOEB) aims to "establish and maintain uniform high standards of excellence in the manual osteopathy profession and education, primarily but not exclusively by preparing and administering to qualified applicants examinations of superior quality . . . and to advance the manual osteopathy profession when in the best interests of manual osteopathy testing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmoeb.org/ |title=Canadian Manual Osteopathy Examining Board (CMOEB) |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> Manual osteopaths who pass exams administered by the CMOEB are permitted to join the [[International Osteopathic Association]] (IOA) and receive a certificate of registration.

The first self-identified college of manual (non-medical) osteopathy in Canada opened in 1981. There are now 8 manual osteopathy schools in Canada, teaching in Halifax, Montreal, Quebec City, Toronto, Hamilton, Vancouver, Ottawa, London, Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton. Two of the schools—National Academy of Osteopathy and the National University of Medical Sciences—offer both campus-based and online osteopathic education across Canada.

===European Union===

There is no universal regulatory authority for the practice of ''osteopathy'' or ''osteopathic medicine'' within the European Union; it is on a country by country basis. The UK's [[General Osteopathic Council]], a regulatory body set up under the country's [[Osteopaths Act 1993]] has issued a position paper on European regulation of osteopathy.<ref>European Public Health Alliance [http://www.epha.org/a/1673 UK GOsC Position paper on pan-European regulation]. Retrieved 2 August 2006</ref> 

In [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], osteopathic practitioners are [[Doctor of Medicine|MDs]] or physiotherapists who take additional courses in osteopathy after completing their [[Medical education|medical training]] or physical therapy training.

''Osteopathy'' is a governmentally recognized profession and has title protection, ''autorisation d'utiliser le titre d'ostéopathe.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=E2C6AF0F427389ECA418BB4307239596.tpdjo08v_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000227015&idArticle=&dateTexte=20090604 |title=Article 75, Public Health Law(2002) |language={{fr icon}} |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> The most recent decree regarding osteopathy was enacted in 2007.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000462001&dateTexte= ''Décret n° 2007-435 du 25 mars 2007 relatif aux actes et aux conditions d'exercice de l'ostéopathie'']</ref>

===Germany===

Germany has both ''osteopathy'' and ''osteopathic medicine.'' There is a difference in the osteopathic education between non-physician osteopaths, physiotherapists, and medical physicians. 

Physiotherapists are a recognized health profession and can achieve a degree of "Diploma in Osteopathic Therapy (D.O.T.)." Non-physician ''osteopaths'' are ''not'' medically licensed. They have an average total of 1200 hours of training, roughly half being in manual therapy and osteopathy, with no medical specialization before they attain their degree. Non-physician osteopaths in Germany officially work under the "Heilpraktiker" law. Heilpraktiker is a separate profession within the health care system. There are many schools of Osteopathy in Germany; most are moving toward national recognition although such recognition does not currently exist.<ref>[http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/germany_osteopathy.pdf ''Osteopathy in Germany,'' Osteopathic International Alliance. Retrieved 26 February 2011.]</ref> In Germany there are rules (at the country level) under which persons (non-physicians) may call themselves Osteopath.<ref>Verordnung einer Weiterbildungs- und Prüfungsordnung im Bereich der Osteopathie- Hessen, [http://www.rv.hessenrecht.hessen.de/jportal/portal/page/bshesprod.psml?pid=Dokumentanzeige&showdoccase=1&js_peid=Trefferliste&documentnumber=1&numberofresults=37&fromdoctodoc=yes&doc.id=jlr-OsteoWeitBiPrOHErahmen%3Ajuris-lr00&doc.part=X&doc.price=0.0&doc.hl=1 hier online]</ref>

''Osteopathic physicians'' in Germany achieve a degree of "D.O.- DAAO" or "D.O.M.", from the DAAO and DGOM respectively. Osteopathic physicians in Germany are fully licensed with at least 6,500 hours in medical school 6 years, at least 7,000 hours in specialty training, which is 3 to 6 years, plus at least 680 hours of training in manual medicine and osteopathy before attaining their degree. German physicians who have obtained the degree designation Dr. med., and who have completed their medical education and specialty training in areas such as general practise, orthopaedics, neurology, internal medicine, etc. can earn a Diploma in Osteopathic Medicine, either a DO-DAAO from the DAAO (German-American Academy for Osteopathy), a DOM™ from the DGOM (German Society of Osteopathic Medicine), or an MDO (Medical Doctor of Osteopathy) from the DGCO (German Society for Chirotherapy and Osteopathy) if additional educational requirements are met. The additional education includes a 320-hour program in manual medicine and an additional minimum of 380 hours in osteopathic medicine, which together makes a minimum of 700 hours. The osteopathic medicine course is limited to physicians only.<ref name="oialliance.org">[http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/germany_om.pdf ''Osteopathic Medicine in Germany,'' Osteopathic International Alliance. Retrieved 25 February 2011.]</ref>

The scope of practise for a US-trained osteopathic physician in Germany is unlimited. A foreign physician may apply for licensure with the regional medical authorities, the Health Ministry, which represents the state in which the applicant intends to work. The regional state health ministry has information regarding the types of medical providers needed in that area and therefore grants work permits to licensed physicians depending on the specialty of the foreign physician.<ref name="oialliance.org"/>

===New Zealand===

The practice of ''osteopathy'' is regulated by law, under the terms of the [[Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0048/latest/whole.html |title=Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 No 48 (as at 01 August 2011), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref>  which came into effect on 18 September 2004. Under the Act, it is a legal requirement to be registered with the Osteopathic Council of New Zealand (OCNZ),<ref>[www.osteopathiccouncil.org.nz/ Osteopathic Council of New Zealand]</ref>  and to hold an annual practicing certificate issued by them, in order to practice as an osteopath. Each of the thirteen healthcare professions regulated by the HPCA Act works within the "Scope of Practise" determined and published by its professional Council. Osteopaths in New Zealand are not fully licensed physicians. In New Zealand, in addition to the general scope of practice, osteopaths may also hold the Scope of Practice for Osteopaths using Western Medical Acupuncture and Related Needling Techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.gazette.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/56863e2945a2e287cc25763c004d1a9b?OpenDocument |title=The Department of Internal Affairs: New Zealand Gazette – The New Zealand Gazette|accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>

In New Zealand a course is offered at [[Unitec New Zealand|Unitec]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.unitec.ac.nz/?C7B4901F-385F-44F0-B37B-609CE4CC0E1E| title = Master of Osteopathy courses, postgraduate study for a masters degree |accessdate =26 January 2009| publisher = Unitec| quote = The Master of Osteopathy is the only New Zealand-based programme that enables you to register with the Osteopathic Council of New Zealand, and to enter practice as an osteopath in New Zealand.}}</ref> Australasian courses consist of a bachelor's degree in clinical science (Osteopathy) followed by a master's degree. The [[Unitec New Zealand]] double degree programme is the OCNZ prescribed qualification for registration in the scope of practice: Osteopath, Australian qualifications accredited by the Australian and New Zealand Osteopathic Council are also prescribed qualifications.

Osteopaths registered and in good standing with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency – Osteopathy Board of Australian are eligible to register in New Zealand under the mutual recognition system operating between the two countries. Graduates from programs in every other country are required to complete an assessment procedure.<ref>[http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/newzealand_osteopathy.pdf ''Osteopathy in New Zealand,'' Osteopathic International Alliance. Retrieved 26 February 2011.]</ref>

The scope of practice for US-trained ''osteopathic physicians'' is unlimited on an ''exceptions'' basis. Full licensure to practice medicine is awarded on an ''exceptions'' basis following a hearing before the licensing authorities in New Zealand. Both the Medical Council of New Zealand<ref>{{cite web|author=Medical Council of New Zealand |url=http://www.mcnz.org.nz/ |title=Medical Council of New Zealand |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> and the Osteopathic Council of New Zealand [OCNZ]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathiccouncil.org.nz/ |title=Osteopathic Council of New Zealand |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> regulate osteopathic physicians in New Zealand. Currently, the country has no recognized osteopathic medical schools.<ref>[http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/newzealand_om.pdf ''Osteopathic Medicine in New Zealand,'' Osteopathic International Alliance. Retrieved 26 February 2011.]</ref>

===United Kingdom===
The practice of ''osteopathy'' has a long history in the [[United Kingdom]]. The first school of osteopathy was established in London in 1917 by John Martin Littlejohn, Ph.D., M.D., D.O., a pupil of A.T. Still, who had been Dean of The Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine. After many years of existing outside the mainstream of health care provision, the osteopathic profession in the UK was finally accorded formal recognition by Parliament in 1993 by the Osteopaths Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1993/Ukpga_19930021_en_1.htm |title=Osteopaths Act 1993 |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> This legislation now provides the profession of osteopathy the same legal framework of statutory self-regulation as other healthcare professions such as medicine and dentistry.

The [[General Osteopathic Council]] (GOsC) regulates the practice of osteopathy under the terms of the Osteopaths Act 1993. Under British law, an osteopath must be registered with the GOsC to practice in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osteopathy.org.uk/information/about-osteopathy/ |title=About osteopathy |author= |year= |work= |publisher=General Osteopathic Council |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> The General Osteopathic Council has a statutory duty to promote, develop and regulate the profession of osteopathy in the UK. It fulfills its duty to protect the interests of the public by ensuring that all osteopaths maintain high standards of safety, competence and professional conduct throughout their professional lives. In order to be registered with the General Osteopathic Council an osteopath must hold a recognized qualification that meets the standards as set out by law in the GOsC's Standard of Practice.<ref name="osteopathy.org.uk">[http://www.osteopathy.org.uk/about_gosc/about_standards.php Standards of Osteopathic Training & Practice, General Osteopathic Council]</ref> This Act provides for "protection of title" A person who, whether expressly or implication describes himself as an osteopath, osteopathic practitioner, osteopathic physician, osteopathist, osteotherapist, or any kind of osteopath is guilty of an offence unless he is registered as an osteopath. There are currently approximately four thousand osteopaths registered in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/uk_osteopathy.pdf |title=United Kingdom |author= |year= |work=Osteopathy |publisher=Osteopathic International Alliance |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> 

In the United Kingdom, courses in Osteopathy have recently become integrated into the university system. Instead of receiving a Diploma in Osteopathy (DO), with or without a Diploma in Naturopathy (ND), graduates now become Masters or Bachelors of Osteopathy, or Osteopathic Medicine, (BOst or MOst) or else Bachelors of Science (BSc) in Osteopathy or Osteopathic Medicine, according to the institution attended:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathy.org.uk/practice/becoming-an-osteopath/training-courses |title='&#39;General Osteopathic Council'&#39; 
|accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> in this case osteopathy and osteopathic medicine ''are'' synonymous, but ''these degrees'' do ''not'' lead to prescribing rights. 

The recognition of osteopathy also means that doctors can now refer patients to osteopaths for treatment with the transfer of clinical responsibility rather than simply delegating the responsibility for care, as is the case with other healthcare professionals. It may or may not be a covered benefit under the [[National Health Service]] depending on where in the UK you may live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathy.org.uk/information/nhs-private-treatment/ |title=General Osteopathic Council, accessed 26 February 2011 |date=9 May 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>

''Osteopathic medicine'' is regulated by the [[General Osteopathic Council]] (GOsC) under the terms of the Osteopaths Act 1993 and statement from the GMC.  The London College of Osteopathic Medicine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcom.org.uk/ |title='&#39;London College of Osteopathic Medicine'&#39; |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>  teaches osteopathy only to those who are already physicians.

Foreign-trained osteopathic physicians, who are registered with the GMC and GOsC, hold both a full medical practise and osteopathic license. Each applicant will have to pass the [[Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test]] (PLAB) and work for one supervised year in the National Health Service (NHS). Following that year, the applicants will be able to apply for full registration (unsupervised practice or private practice). If the physician is already a specialist, postgraduate training will need to be separately recognized by the GMC.<ref>[http://www.oialliance.org/pdf/uk_om.pdf "Osteopathic Medicine in the United Kingdom," Osteopathic International Alliance.

===United States===
{{Main|Osteopathic medicine in the United States}}

Licensure or registration of non-physician ''osteopaths'' is not permitted anywhere in the United States. European style osteopaths are prohibited from calling themselves osteopaths. In contrast, osteopathic physicians earn the degree of [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (D.O.), a degree equivalent, though different in certain aspects, to that of [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/40/physician.pdf |title=Medicine |author= |year= |work= |publisher=American Medical Association |accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref><ref name = "Harrisons">Dennis L.

''Osteopathic medicine'' in the United States has always meant a physician trained in and entitled to the full scope of medical practice. ''Osteopathy'' or ''osteopath'' as written in some U.S. state and federal laws refers only to ''osteopathic medicine'' or ''osteopathic physicians,'' respectively.<ref>[http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Resolution301_A2010_FinalVersion.pdf ''Resolution 301, H229-A/05 Osteopath & Osteopathy – Use of the Terms,'' Approved by the AOA House of Delegates, July 2010.]</ref> With the increased internationalization of the profession, these older terms have fallen out of favor as generally accepted use due to the confusion they may cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=24181 |title='&#39;AOA House reasserts preferred terms osteopathic physician, osteopathic medicine,'&#39; Carolyn Schierhorn, The DO, August 4, 2010 |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=26191 |title='&#39;Promoting DOs: Words, medium change, but message stays the same,'&#39; John B.
