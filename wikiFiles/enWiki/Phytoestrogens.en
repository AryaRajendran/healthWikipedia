'''Phytoestrogens''' are plant-derived [[xenoestrogen]]s functioning as the primary [[female]] [[sex hormone]] (see [[estrogen]]) not generated within the [[endocrine system]] but consumed by eating phytoestrogenic plants. Also called "dietary estrogens", they are a diverse group of naturally occurring  nonsteroidal plant compounds that, because of their structural similarity with [[estradiol]] (17-β-estradiol), have the ability to cause [[estrogenic]] or/and antiestrogenic effects.<ref name= "Yil">{{cite book | last = Yildiz| first = Fatih| title = Phytoestrogens in Functional Foods| publisher = Taylor & Francis Ltd |year=2005|pages =  3–5, 210–211 | isbn  = 978-1-57444-508-4}}</ref>

Their name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''phyto'' = plant and ''estrogen'', the hormone which gives fertility to the [[female mammals]]. The word "[[estrus]]" -Greek οίστρος- means [[sexual desire]] and "gene" -Greek γόνο- is "to generate"). It has been proposed that plants use the phytoestrogens as part of their natural defence against the overpopulation of the herbivore animals by controlling the male fertility.<ref name="pmid3203635">{{cite journal | author = Hughes CL | title = Phytochemical mimicry of reproductive hormones and modulation of herbivore fertility by phytoestrogens | journal = Environ.

== Structure ==

Phytoestrogens mainly belong to a large group of substituted [[natural phenol]]ic compounds: the [[coumestan]]s, [[prenylflavonoid]]s and [[isoflavone]]s are three of the most active in estrogenic effects in this class. The best-researched are isoflavones, which are commonly found in [[soy]] and [[red clover]]. [[Lignan]]s have also been identified as phytoestrogens, although they are not flavonoids.<ref name= "Yil"/> [[Mycoestrogens]] have similar structures and effects, but are not components of plants; these are mold metabolites of ''[[Fusarium]]'', a fungus that is frequently found in pastures as well as in [[alfalfa]] and clover. Although mycoestrogens are rarely taken into account in discussions about phytoestrogens, these are the compounds that initially generated the interest on the topic.<ref>{{cite book | last = Naz| first =  Rajesh K.| title = Endocrine Disruptors: Effects on Male and Female Reproductive Systems| publisher = CRC Press Inc|year=1999| isbn  = 978-0-8493-3164-0| page =  90}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==

Phytoestrogens exert their effects primarily through binding to [[estrogen receptor]]s (ER).<ref name="pmid17518366">{{cite journal | author = Turner JV, Agatonovic-Kustrin S, Glass BD | title = Molecular aspects of phytoestrogen selective binding at estrogen receptors | journal = J Pharm Sci | volume = 96 | issue = 8 | pages =  1879–1885 | year = 2007 | month = August | pmid = 17518366 | doi = 10.1002/jps.20987 | url = | issn = }}</ref>  There are two variants of the estrogen receptor, alpha ([[estrogen receptor alpha|ER-α]]) and beta ([[estrogen receptor beta|ER-β]]) and many phytoestrogens display somewhat higher [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor/ligand binding affinity|affinity]] for ER-β compared to ER-α.<ref name="pmid17518366"/>

The key structural elements that enable phytoestrogens to bind with high affinity to estrogen receptors and display estradiol-like effects are:<ref name= "Yil"/>
*The phenolic ring that is indispensable for binding to estrogen receptor
*The ring of isoflavones mimicking a ring of estrogens at the receptors binding site
*Low molecular weight similar to estrogens (MW=272)
*Distance between two hydroxyl groups at the isoflavones nucleus similar to that occurring in estradiol
*Optimal hydroxylation pattern

In addition to interaction with ERs, phytoestrogens may also modulate the concentration of endogenous estrogens by binding or inactivating some enzymes, and may affect the bioavailability of sex hormones by depressing or stimulating the synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).<ref name= "Jon"/>

Emerging evidence shows that some phytoestrogens bind to and transactivate [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]s (PPARs).<ref name="pmid15922618">{{cite journal | author = Dang ZC, Lowik C | title = Dose-dependent effects of phytoestrogens on bone | journal = Trends Endocrinol.

Phytoestrogens are ancient naturally occurring substances, and as dietary phytochemicals they are considered as co-evolutive with mammals. In the human diet, phytoestrogens are not the only source of exogenous estrogens. [[Xenoestrogens]] (novel, man-made), are found as [[food additive]]s <ref>Amadasi A, Mozzarelli A, Meda C, Maggi A, Cozzini P.

== Food sources ==
According to a study by Canadian researchers about the content of nine common phytoestrogens in a Western diet, foods with the highest relative phytoestrogen content were nuts and oilseeds, followed by soy products, cereals and breads, [[legume]]s, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages.  [[Flax]] seed and other oilseeds contained the highest total phytoestrogen content, followed by soybeans and [[tofu]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thompson LU, Boucher BA, Liu Z, Cotterchio M, Kreiger N |title=Phytoestrogen content of foods consumed in Canada, including isoflavones, lignans, and coumestan |journal=[[Nutrition and Cancer]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages= 184–201 |year=2006 |pmid=16898863 |doi=10.1207/s15327914nc5402_5 |url= |issn= |accessdate=2008-12-20}}</ref> The highest concentrations of isoflavones are found in soybeans and soybean products followed by legumes, whereas lignans are the primary source of phytoestrogens found in nuts and oilseeds (e.g. flax) and also found in cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables.

Phytoestrogen content varies in different foods, and may vary significantly within the same group of foods (e.g. soy beverages, tofu) depending on processing mechanisms and type of soybean used.<ref>Fermented soy products have lower phytoestrogen content.

== Health risks and benefits ==
In human beings, phytoestrogens are readily absorbed, circulate in plasma and are excreted in the urine. Metabolic influence is different from that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus monogastric digestive systems.<ref name= "Repro"/>

In the last few years, there has been a great deal of research into the possible beneficial effects of phytoestrogens in both diabetes and coronary heart disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Clinical guidelines from the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] state: "although isolated soy protein-based
formulas may be used to provide nutrition for normal
growth and development, there are few indications
for their use in place of cow milk-based formula.

and hereditary lactase deficiency (rare) and
(b) in situations in which a vegetarian diet is preferred."<ref name="pmid18450914">{{cite journal |author=Bhatia J, Greer F |title=Use of soy protein-based formulas in infant feeding |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages= 1062–1068 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18450914 |doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0564 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18450914 |issn= |accessdate=2008-12-20}}</ref>
