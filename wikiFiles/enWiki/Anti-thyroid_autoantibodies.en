'''Anti-thyroid autoantibodies''' (or simply '''anti-thyroid antibodies''') are [[autoantibodies]] targeted against one or more components of the [[thyroid]]. The most clinically relevant anti-thyroid autoantibodies are anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO antibodies), thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) and thyroglobulin antibodies. TRAbs are subdivided into activating, blocking and neutral antibodies, depending on their effect on the TSH receptor. Anti-sodium/Iodide (Anti–Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sup>−</sup>) symporter antibodies are a more recent discovery and their clinical relevance is still unknown. [[Graves' Disease]] and [[Hashimoto's Thyroiditis]] are commonly associated with the presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies. Although there is overlap, anti-TPO antibodies are most commonly associated with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and activating TRAbs are most commonly associated with Graves' Disease. Thyroid microsomal antibodies were a group of anti-thyroid antibodies, they were renamed after the identification of their target antigen (TPO).<ref name = “doi 10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70189-4”/><ref name="pmid10874533"/><ref name = "pmid8907685"/><ref name = "isbn0781750474"/>

==Subtypes==
Anti-thyroid antibodies can be subdivided into groups according to their target antigen.

===Anti-TPO antibodies===
Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies are specific for the [[autoantigen]] TPO, a 105kDa glycoprotein that catalyses iodine oxidation and thyroglobulin tyrosyl iodination reactions in the thyroid gland.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taurog|first=Alvin|title=Molecular evolution of thyroid peroxidase**Adapted from Taurog A., Wall M., Thyroid 8 (1998) 185–191, with permission from the publisher, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc|journal=Biochimie|date=NaN undefined NaN|volume=81|issue=5|pages=557–562|doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(99)80110-2|pmid=10403190}}</ref> Most antibodies produced are directed to [[conformational epitope]]s of the [[immunogenic]] [[c-terminus|carboxyl-terminal]] region of the TPO protein, although antibodies to [[linear epitope]]s have been seen.<ref name = "isbn0781750474">{{cite book|last=Utiger|first=editors, Lewis E.

===TSH receptor antibodies===
The [[thyrotropin receptor]] (TSH receptor) is the antigen for TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs). It is a [[G protein coupled receptor|seven transmembrane G protein coupled receptor ]] that is involved in thyroid hormone signalling. TRAbs are grouped depending on their effects on receptor signalling; activating antibodies (associated with hyperthyroidism), blocking antibodies (associated with thyroiditis) and neutral antibodies (no effect on receptor). Activating and blocking antibodies mostly bind to conformational epitopes, whereas neutral antibodies bind to linear epitopes. Binding of the antibody to the amino terminus of the TSH receptor shows stimulatory activity, whereas binding to residues 261-370 or 388-403 block the activity. TRAbs are present in 70-100% of Graves' Disease (85-100% for activating antibodies and 75-96% for blocking antibodies) and 1-2% of normal individuals.<ref name = “doi 10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70189-4”/><ref name = "pmid10874533">{{cite journal|last=Orgiazzi|first=J|title=Anti-TSH receptor antibodies in clinical practice|journal=Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America|date=2000 Jun|volume=29|issue=2|pages=339–55, vii|pmid=10874533|doi=10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70135-3}}</ref><ref name="thyroid disorders - an update">{{cite journal|last=Swain|first=Manorama|coauthors=Truptirekha Swain, Binoy Kumar Mohanty|title=Autoimmune thyroid disorders—An update|journal=Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry|year=2005|volume=20|issue=1|pages=9–17|doi=10.1007/BF02893034|pmid=23105486|pmc=3454167}}</ref>

Activating TRAbs  are characteristic of Graves' Disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism). TPO antibody is measured more easily than the TSH receptor antibody, and so is often used as a surrogate in the diagnosis of Graves' Disease. These antibodies activate adenylate cyclase by binding to the TSH receptor. This causes the production of thyroid hormones and subsequent growth and vascularisation of the thyroid.<ref name = “doi 10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70189-4”/> TRAbs are also useful in the diagnosis of [[Graves' Ophthalmopathy]]. Although the exact mechanism of how TRAbs induce Graves' Ophthalmopathy is unknown, it is likely that the antibodies bind to TSH receptors in retro-orbital tissues, causing infiltration of lymphocytes. This inflammatory response leads to [[cytokine]] production that causes [[fibroblast]]s to produce [[glycosaminoglycans]], leading to ophthalmopathy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nayak|first=B|coauthors=Hodak, SP|title=Hyperthyroidism|journal=Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America|date=2007 Sep|volume=36|issue=3|pages=617–56, v|pmid=17673122|doi=10.1016/j.ecl.2007.06.002}}</ref><ref name="pmid22577596">{{cite journal|last=Kamath|first=C|coauthors=Adlan, MA; Premawardhana, LD|title=The role of thyrotrophin receptor antibody assays in graves' disease|journal=Journal of thyroid research|date=2012|volume=2012|pages=525936|pmid=22577596|doi=10.1155/2012/525936|pmc=3345237}}</ref>

Blocking TRAbs (also known as Thyrotropin Binding Inhibitory Immunoglobulins (TBII)) competitively block the activity of TSH on the receptor. This can cause hypothyroidism by reducing the thyrotropic effects of TSH. They are found in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease and may be cause of fluctuation of thyroid function in the latter. During treatment of Graves' disease they may also become the predominant antibody, which can cause hypothyroidism.<ref name="pmid22577596"/><ref name="pmid10874533" />

The clinical and physiological relevance of neutral antibodies remains unclear. However, they may be involved in prolonging the TSH receptor halflife.<ref name="pmid10874533"/>

===Thyroglobulin antibodies===
Thyroglobulin antibodies are specific for thyroglobulin, a 660kDa matrix protein involved in the process of thyroid hormone production. They are found in 70% of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, 60% of idiopathic hypothyroidism, 30% of Graves' Disease, a small proportion of thyroid carcinoma and 3% of normal individuals.<ref name = “doi 10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70189-4”/><ref name = "pmid8907685">{{cite journal|last=Boyd|first=CM|coauthors=Baker JR, Jr|title=The immunology of thyroid cancer|journal=Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America|date=1996 Mar|volume=25|issue=1|pages=159–79|pmid=8907685|doi=10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70317-0}}</ref> Anti-TPO antibodies are present in 99% of cases where thyroglobulin antibodies are present, however only 35% of anti-TPO antibody positive cases also demonstrate thyroglobulin antibodies.<ref name ="pmid12734493">{{cite journal|last=Ai|first=J|coauthors=Leonhardt, JM; Heymann, WR|title=Autoimmune thyroid diseases: etiology, pathogenesis, and dermatologic manifestations|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|date=2003 May|volume=48|issue=5|pages=641–59; quiz 660–2|pmid=12734493|doi=10.1067/mjd.2003.257}}</ref>

===Anti–Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sup>−</sup> symporter===
Anti-Na<sup>+</sup>/I<sup>-</sup> symporter antibodies are a more recent discovery of possible thyroid autoantibodies and their role in thyroid disease remains uncertain. They are present in approximately 20% of Graves' Disease and 24% of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.<ref name = “doi 10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70189-4”/>

==Pathogenesis==
The production of antibodies in Graves' Disease is thought to arise by activation of CD4+ T-cells, followed by B-cell recruitment into the thyroid. These B-cells produce antibodies specific to the thyroid antigens. In Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, activated CD4+ T-cells produce interferon-γ, causing the thyroid cells to display MHC class II molecules. This expands the autoreactive T-cell repertoire and prolongs the inflammatory response.<ref name="pmid11913070">{{cite journal|last=Stassi|first=G|coauthors=De Maria, R|title=Autoimmune thyroid disease: new models of cell death in autoimmunity|journal=Nature reviews. Immunology|date=2002 Mar|volume=2|issue=3|pages=195–204|pmid=11913070|doi=10.1038/nri750}}</ref>

==Effect on human reproduction==
The presence of anti-thyroid antibodies is associated with an increased risk of [[unexplained subfertility]] ([[odds ratio]] 1.5 and 95% [[confidence interval]] 1.1–2.0), miscarriage (odds ratio 3.73, 95% confidence interval 1.8–7.6), [[recurrent miscarriage]] (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.5–3.5), [[preterm birth]] (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.1–3.5) and maternal [[Postpartum thyroiditis]] (odds ratio 11.5, 95% confidence interval 5.6–24).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dmr024}}</ref>

==History==
In 1912 Hashimoto described hypothyroidism and goiter associated with thyroid lymphoid infiltration. In 1956 the anti-Tg antibody was detected in similar cases, elucidating the autoimmune cause of these characteristics. Later the same year, activating TSH recepter antibodies were discovered. Thyroid microsomal antibodies were discovered in 1964, which were subsequently renamed anti-TPO antibodies due to the identification of their autoantigen.<ref name = “doi 10.1016/S0889-8529(05)70189-4”/>
