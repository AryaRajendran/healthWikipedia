The '''patellar reflex''' or '''knee-jerk''' is a [[deep tendon reflex]] and is a [[myotatic reflex]].

==Mechanism==
Striking the [[patellar ligament]] with a [[reflex hammer]] just below the [[patella]] stretches the [[muscle spindle]] in the [[quadriceps  muscle]]. This produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses (without interneurons) at the level of L4 in the spinal cord, completely independent of higher centres. From there, an alpha-[[motor neuron]] conducts an efferent impulse back to the [[quadriceps femoris muscle]], triggering contraction. This contraction, coordinated with the relaxation of the antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle causes the leg to kick. This reflex is a reflex of proprioception which helps maintain [[Neutral spine|posture]] and [[balance (ability)|balance]], allowing to keep one's balance with little effort or conscious thought.

The patellar reflex is a clinical and classic example of the monosynaptic [[reflex arc]]. There is no [[interneuron]] in the pathway leading to contraction of the quadriceps muscle. Instead the bipolar sensory neuron synapses directly on a motor neuron in the spinal cord. However, there ''is'' an inhibitory interneuron used to relax the antagonistic hamstring muscle.

It tests L2, L3, and L4.<ref name="Weiner2010">{{cite book|author=William J.

==Purpose of Testing==

After the tap of a hammer, the leg is normally extended once and comes to rest. The absence or decrease of this reflex is known as [[Westphal's sign]]. On the other hand, multiple oscillation of the leg following the tap may be a sign of a [[cerebellar disease]].  The test itself assesses the nervous tissue between and including the L2 and L4 segments.

==History==
The term ''knee-jerk'' was recorded by Sir [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]] in his Textbook of [[physiology]] in 1877: "Striking the tendon below the patella gives rise to a sudden extension of the leg, known as the knee-jerk."<ref name="phrases">[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/220600.html Knee-jerk reaction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Popular culture ==
The term began to be used figuratively from the early 20th century onwards. [[O. O. McIntyre]], in his New York Day-By-Day column in [[The Coshocton Tribune]], October 1921, wrote: "Itinerant preacher stemming Broadway on a soap box. And gets only an occasional knee-jerk."<ref name="phrases" />
