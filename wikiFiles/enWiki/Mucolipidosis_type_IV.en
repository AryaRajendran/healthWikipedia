'''Mucolipidosis type IV''' (ML IV) is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[lysosomal storage disorder]]. Individuals with the disorder have many symptoms including delayed psychomotor development and various ocular aberrations. The disorder is caused by mutations in the [[MCOLN1]] gene, which encodes a non-selective [[cation]] [[Ion channel|channel]], mucolipin1.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nilius B, Owsianik G, Voets T, Peters JA |title=Transient receptor potential cation channels in disease |journal=Physiol.

==Symptoms and Signs==
Most patients with ML IV show psychomotor retardation (i.e., delayed development of movement and [[coordination (physiology)|coordination]]), [[cornea]]l opacity, [[retina]]l degeneration and other [[ophthamology|ophthalmological]] abnormalities. Other symptoms include [[agenesis of the corpus callosum]], [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] resulting from an absence of acid secretion in the stomach, [[achlorhydria]]. Achlorhydria in these patients results in an increase in blood [[gastrin]] levels. These symptoms typically manifest early in life (within the first year). Retinal degeneration progresses slowly.

==Pathophysiology==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Mucolipidosis type IV has an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

Mucolipin1 is thought to be localized in [[endosome]]s. An important property of mucolipin1 is that decreasing pH (acidification) results in deactivation of the protein, likely through an assembly defect. There are at least 29 known mutations in [[MCOLN1]], located throughout the gene.<ref>Goldin E, Slaugenhaupt SA, Smith J, Schiffmann R (2005) Mucolipidosis IV, GeneReviews at GeneTests: Medical Genetics Information Resource</ref> Many of the known mutations result in no expression of mucolipin1. Milder mutations, such as ΔF408 and V446L, produce a dysfunctioning form of the cation channel.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Altarescu G, Sun M, Moore DF, Smith JA, Wiggs EA, Solomon BI, Patronas NJ, Frei KP, Gupta S, Kaneski CR, Quarrell OW, Slaugenhaupt SA, Goldin E, Schiffmann R |title=The neurogenetics of mucolipidosis type IV |journal=Neurology |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=306–13 |year=2002 |pmid=12182165}}</ref> Mutations that alter only the [[C-terminal]] of the protein also result in a mild phenotype of the disorder, usually sparing the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Goldin E, Caruso RC, Benko W, Kaneski CR, Stahl S, Schiffmann R |title=Isolated ocular disease is associated with decreased mucolipin-1 channel conductance |journal=Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci |volume=49 |issue=7 |pages=3134–42 |year=2008 |pmid=18326692 | doi=10.1167/iovs.07-1649}}</ref>  ML IV causes affected cells to accumulate auto-fluorescent vacuoles considered to be aberrant lysosomes.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Goldin E, Blanchette-Mackie EJ, Dwyer NK, Pentchev PG, Brady RO |title=Cultured skin fibroblasts derived from patients with mucolipidosis 4 are auto-fluorescent |journal=Pediatric Research |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=687–92 |year=1995 |pmid=7651750}}</ref> Several evidences exist for a defect in both [[exocytosis]] and [[endocytosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chen CS, Bach G, Pagano RE |title=Abnormal transport along the lysosomal pathway in Mucolipidosis, type IV disease |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=6373–8 |year=1998 |pmid=9600972 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.11.6373 | pmc=27719}}</ref> There are conflicting indications of abnormal lysosomal pH in MLIV.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} It is not yet clear why these abnormalities will cause incomplete development of the brain, achlorhydria, and failure in the maintenance of retinal tissue.

==Treatment/Management==
There is no specific treatment to this disorder. However, several symptoms may be alleviated. For instance, [[anemia]] is treated by [[iron]] supplements. Some of the movement deficiencies may be corrected with orthopedic intervention. The corneal clouding can be, at least, temporarily corrected by corneal transplantation.

==Epidemiology==
Mucolipidosis type IV is severely under-diagnosed. It is often misdiagnosed as [[cerebral palsy]]. In the  [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish population there are two severe mutations with a higher carrier frequency<ref name="pmid16287144">{{cite journal |author=Bach G, Webb MB, Bargal R, Zeigler M, Ekstein J |title=The frequency of mucolipidosis type IV in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and the identification of 3 novel MCOLN1 mutations |journal=[[Hum.
