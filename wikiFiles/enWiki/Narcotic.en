The term '''narcotic''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|n|ɑr|ˈ|k|ɒ|t|ɨ|k}}, from [[ancient Greek]] ναρκῶ ''narkō'', "Ι benumb") originally referred medically to any [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] compound with any sleep-inducing properties. In the [[United States]] it has since become associated with [[opioids]], commonly [[morphine]] and [[heroin]] and their [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]], such as [[hydrocodone]]. The term is, today, imprecisely defined and typically has negative connotations.<ref>Julien, Robert M. ''A Primer of Drug Action.'' 11th edition. Claire D. Advokat, Joseph E. Comaty, eds. New York: Worth Publishers: 2008. page 537.</ref><ref>Mangione MP, Matoka M:  Improving Pain Management Communication. How Patients Understand the terms "Opioid" and "Narcotic."  Journal of General Internal Medicine 2008; vol 23:9 1336-1338. </ref> When used in a legal context in the U.S., a ''narcotic'' drug is simply one that is totally prohibited, or one that is used in violation of strict governmental regulation, such as heroin or morphine. 

From a pharmacological standpoint it is not a useful term,<ref>Julien, Robert M. ''A Primer of Drug Action''</ref> as is evinced by the historically varied usage of the word.
{{quotation|Alcohol is the principle that gives to ardent spirit and wine their intoxicating power; while the narcotic principle to opium and tobacco imparts similar properties. In popular language, alcohol is classed among the stimulants; and opium and tobacco among the narcotics; which are substances whose ultimate effect upon the animal system is to produce torpor and insensibility; but taken in small quantities they at first exhilarate. And since alcohol does the same, most medical writers, at the present day, class it among the narcotics.

Statutory classification of a drug as a narcotic often increases the penalties for violation of drug control statutes. For example, although federal law classifies both [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]] as "Schedule II" drugs, the penalty for possession of cocaine is greater than the penalty for possession of amphetamines because cocaine, unlike amphetamines, is classified as a narcotic.<ref>{{cite journal |title=NOTE AND COMMENT: Statutory Classification of Cocaine as a Narcotic: An Illogical Anachronism

==United Nations==
===Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961===
The adoption of this Convention is regarded as a milestone in the history of international drug control. [[single convention on narcotic drugs|The Single Convention]] codified all existing multilateral treaties on drug control and extended the existing control systems to include the cultivation of plants that were grown as the raw material of narcotic drugs. The principal objectives of the Convention are to limit the possession, use, trade, distribution, import, export, manufacture and production of drugs exclusively to medical and scientific purposes and to address drug trafficking through international cooperation to deter and discourage drug traffickers. The Convention also established the International Narcotics Control Board, merging the Permanent Central Board and the Drug Supervisory Board.<ref>[http://www.incb.org/incb/convention_1961.html Convention 1961]. Incb.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-24.</ref>

The 1961 Convention exercises control over more than 116 narcotic drugs. They include mainly plant-based products such as opium and its derivatives morphine, codeine and heroin, but also synthetic narcotics such as methadone and pethidine, as well as cannabis, coca and cocaine. The Convention divides drugs into four groups, or schedules, in order to enforce a greater or lesser degree of control for the various substances and compounds. Opium smoking and eating, coca leaf chewing, cannabis resin smoking and the non-medical use of cannabis are prohibited. The 1972 Protocol to this Convention calls for increased efforts to prevent illicit production of, traffic in and use of narcotics. It also highlights the need to provide treatment and rehabilitation services to drug abusers.<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/illicit-drugs/definitions/index.html Illicit Drugs – Drug Definitions].

===UNODC terminology and information on drugs===

narcotic drug

In medicine, a chemical agent that induces stupor, coma, or insensibility to pain
(also called narcotic analgesic).

In the context of international drug control, “narcotic drug” means any drug
defined as such under the 1961 Convention.<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/publications/report_2003-09-01_1.pdf TERMINOLOGY AND INFORMATION ON DRUGS]. (PDF) . Second edition. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 2003. Retrieved on 2011-09-24.</ref>

===Studies on the definition of ''counterfeit medicines'' in WHO member states===

4. Assessment of the definitions of counterfeit medicines (or equivalent) in Member States

4.2 The nature of legal definitions: the unambiguity requirement

In order to avoid room for difference in interpretation, law-makers (''codificators'') sometimes deviate from etymological (definiendum plus definientia) definitions. In doing so, they approach the term from the law enforcement point of view.
The best example is the definition of ''narcotics'' in the United Nations Conventions. Narcotics are substances and preparations that induce drowsiness, sleep, stupor, insensibility, etc., and that these effects (and their rate) are complicated to prove, e.g. during litigation. Thus, the legal definition of a narcotic is whether or not it is listed on the Schedules of the Convention. If it is on some of the Schedules, it is narcotic.<ref>[http://www.who.int/medicines/services/counterfeit/WHO_ACM_Report.pdf PRELIMINARY DRAFT SURVEY ON NATIONAL LEGISLATION ON "COUNTERFEIT MEDICINES"].

===Lexicon of alcohol and drug terms published by the World Health Organization===

No to pain. The term usually refers to opiates or opioids, which are called narcotic analgesics. In common parlance and legal usage, it is often used imprecisely to mean illicit drugs, irrespective of their pharmacology. For example, narcotics control legislation in Canada, USA, and certain other countries includes cocaine and cannabis as well as opioids (see also conventions, international drug). Because of this variation in usage, the term is best replaced by one with a more specific meaning (e.g. opioid).<ref>[http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/who_lexicon/en/ WHO | Lexicon of alcohol and drug terms published by the World Health Organization].

==US v Stieren==
608 F.2d 1135

United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. Decided Oct. 31, 1979. LAY, Circuit Judge.

John Arthur Stieren appeals from the judgment of conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and dispense under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Stieren contends that the statute is unconstitutional because "cocaine is classified as a narcotic under Schedule II of 21 U.S.C. § 812(c), when as a matter of scientific and medical fact cocaine is not a narcotic but is a non-narcotic stimulant."

The sufficiency of the evidence is not disputed. Stieren was convicted after special agents testified that he was in possession of and attempted to sell them a large quantity of cocaine. Defendant urges that the testimony and reports by physicians and scientists demonstrate that cocaine is not a narcotic. He also cites cases which hold that cocaine is not a narcotic under the pharmacological definition of the term. State v. Erickson, 574 P.2d 1 (Alaska 1978).

It is within the legislative prerogative to classify cocaine, which is a non-narcotic central nervous system stimulant, as a narcotic for penalty and regulatory purposes. 21 U.S.C. § 802(16)(A). The use of cocaine poses serious problems for the community and has a high potential for abuse. Congress' choice of penalty reflects a societal policy which must be adhered to by the courts.2 Congress has the power to reclassify cocaine. This power has been delegated to the Attorney General. 21 U.S.C. § 811(a)(1). If cocaine is to be reclassified, defendant's arguments should be made to the legislative branch, not the courts.

We hold that Congress had a rational legislative purpose when it classified cocaine as a Schedule II narcotic drug for the purpose of imposing penalties.

==History==
The term "narcotic" is believed to have been coined by the Greek physician [[Galen]] to refer to agents that numb or deaden, causing loss of feeling or paralysis. It  is based on the Greek word ''ναρκωσις'' (narcosis), the term used by [[Hippocrates]] for the process of numbing or the numbed state. Galen listed [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]] root, altercus (eclata),<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sMlcxiDMzmYC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=altercus&source=web&ots=SRbcmEPBzT&sig=ia0p6gbqd9paYvT7qaEAYfYaSQ4 |title=The Laud Herbal Glossary |author=J.

See ''A Primer of Drug Action'' full citation above.</ref> Now, the term is used in a number of ways. Some people define narcotics as substances that bind at [[opioid receptor]]s (cellular membrane proteins activated by substances like heroin or morphine) while others refer to any illicit substance as a narcotic. From a legal perspective, narcotic refers to opium, opium derivatives, and their semi-synthetic substitutes.<ref>[http://drug-rehab-referral.org/drug_rehab_narcotics.html Narcotics Drug Addiction Help Rehabilitation Recovery Resource]. Drug-rehab-referral.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-24.</ref> Though in U.S. law, due to its numbing properties, cocaine is also considered a narcotic.

Sense of "any illegal drug" first recorded 1926, Amer.Eng. The adj. is first attested c.1600.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=narcotic Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-24.</ref>
