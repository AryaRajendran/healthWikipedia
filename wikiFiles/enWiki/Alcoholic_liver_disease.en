'''Alcoholic liver disease''' is a term that encompasses the hepatic manifestations of alcohol overconsumption, including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and chronic hepatitis with hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.<ref name=AASLD10>{{cite journal |author=O'Shea RS, Dasarathy S, McCullough AJ |title=Alcoholic liver disease |journal=Hepatology |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=307–28 |year=2010 |month=January |pmid=20034030 |doi=10.1002/hep.23258 |url=http://www.aasld.org/practiceguidelines/Documents/Bookmarked%20Practice%20Guidelines/AlcoholicLiverDisease1-2010.pdf |format=PDF |work=AASLD Practice Guidelines}}</ref> It is the major cause of [[liver disease]] in Western countries. Although steatosis (fatty liver) will develop in any individual who consumes a large quantity of alcoholic beverages over a long period of time, this process is transient and reversible.<ref name=AASLD10/> Of all chronic heavy drinkers, only 15–20% develop hepatitis or cirrhosis, which can occur concomitantly or in succession.<ref name=Menon01>{{cite journal |author=Menon KV, Gores GJ, Shah VH |title=Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of alcoholic liver disease |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=76 |issue=10 |pages=1021–9 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11605686 |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/content/76/10/1021.full.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.4065/76.10.1021}}</ref>

How alcohol damages the liver is not completely understood. 80% of alcohol passes through the liver to be detoxified. Chronic consumption of alcohol results in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8), oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and acetaldehyde toxicity. These factors cause inflammation, apoptosis and eventually fibrosis of liver cells. Why this occurs in only a few individuals is still unclear. Additionally, the liver has tremendous capacity to regenerate and even when 75% of hepatocytes are dead, it continues to function as normal.<ref>{{cite web

==Risk factors==
The risk factors presently known are: 
* '''Quantity of alcohol taken''': consumption of 60–80g per day (about 75–100 ml/day) for 20 years or more in men, or 20g/day (about 25 ml/day) for women significantly increases the risk of hepatitis and fibrosis by 7 to 47%,<ref name=AASLD10/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mandayam S, Jamal MM, Morgan TR |title=Epidemiology of alcoholic liver disease |journal=Semin. Liver Dis. |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=217–32 |year=2004 |month=August |pmid=15349801 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-832936 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2004-832936}}</ref>
* '''Pattern of drinking:''' drinking outside of meal times increases up to 2.7 times the risk of alcoholic liver disease.<ref name=Menon01/>
* '''Gender:''' females are twice as susceptible to alcohol-related liver disease, and may develop alcoholic liver disease with shorter durations and doses of chronic consumption. The lesser amount of alcohol dehydrogenase secreted in the gut, higher proportion of body fat in women, and changes in fat absorption due to the with menstrual cycle may explain this phenomenon.<ref name=Menon01/>
* '''Hepatitis C infection''': a concomitant hepatitis C infection significantly accelerates the process of liver injury.<ref name=Menon01/>
* '''Genetic factors:''' genetic factors predispose both to alcoholism and to alcoholic liver disease. Monozygotic twins are more likely to be alcoholics and to develop liver cirrhosis than dizygotic twins. Polymorphisms in the enzymes involved in the metabolism of alcohol, such as ADH, ALDH, CYP4502E1, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine polymorphism may partly explain this genetic component. However, no specific polymorphisms have currently been firmly linked to alcoholic liver disease.
* '''Iron overload (hemochromatosis)'''
* '''Diet''': malnutrition, particularly vitamin A and E deficiencies, can worsen alcohol-induced liver damage by preventing regeneration of hepatocytes. This is particularly a concern as alcoholics are usually malnourished because of a poor diet, anorexia, and encephalopathy.<ref name=Menon01/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Pathogenesis alcoholic liver injury.jpg|thumb|right|Pathogenesis of alcohol induced liver injury]]

===Fatty change===
{{Main|Fatty liver}}
Fatty change, or [[steatosis]] is the accumulation of fatty acids in [[hepatocyte|liver cells]]. These can be seen as fatty globules under the microscope. Alcoholism causes development of large fatty globules ([[Macroscopic|macro]] [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicular]] steatosis) throughout the liver and can begin to occur after a few days of heavy drinking.<ref name=Inaba04>{{cite book |last2=Cohen |first2=William B. |last1=Inaba |first1=Darryl |title=Uppers, downers, all arounders: physical and mental effects of psychoactive drugs |publisher=CNS Publications |location=Ashland, Or |year=2004 |isbn=0-926544-27-6 |edition=5th |ref=harv}}</ref>  Alcohol is metabolized by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] ([[Alcohol dehydrogenase|ADH]]) into [[acetaldehyde]], then further metabolized by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] ([[ALDH]]) into [[acetic acid]], which is finally oxidized into [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) and water ({{H2O}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Inaba|Cohen|2004|p=185}}</ref> This process generates NADH, and increases the [[NADPH]]/[[NADP+]] ratio. A higher NADH concentration induces [[fatty acid synthesis]] while a decreased NAD level results in decreased fatty acid oxidation. Subsequently, the higher levels of fatty acids signal the liver cells to compound it to [[glycerol]] to form [[triglyceride]]s. These triglycerides accumulate, resulting in fatty liver.

===Alcoholic hepatitis===
{{Main|Alcoholic hepatitis}}
Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by the inflammation of hepatocytes. Between 10% and 35% of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis (NIAAA, 1993).  While development of hepatitis is not directly related to the dose of alcohol, some people seem more prone to this reaction than others{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}.  This is called alcoholic [[Fat cell|steato]] [[necrosis]] and the inflammation appears to predispose to liver [[fibrosis]]. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8) are thought to be essential in the initiation and perpetuation of liver injury by inducing apoptosis and necrosis. One possible mechanism for the increased activity of TNF-α is the increased intestinal permeability due to liver disease. This facilitates the absorption of the gut-produced endotoxin into the portal circulation. The Kupffer cells of the liver then phagocytose endotoxin, stimulating the release of TNF-α. TNF-α then triggers apoptotic pathways through the activation of caspases, resulting in cell death.<ref name=Menon01/>

===Cirrhosis ===
{{Main|Cirrhosis}}
[[Cirrhosis]] is a late stage of serious liver disease marked by [[inflammation]] (swelling), [[fibrosis]] (cellular hardening) and damaged membranes preventing detoxification of chemicals in the body, ending in scarring and [[necrosis]] (cell death). Between 10% to 20% of heavy drinkers will develop cirrhosis of the liver (NIAAA, 1993). [[Acetaldehyde]] may be responsible for alcohol-induced fibrosis by stimulating [[collagen]] deposition by hepatic [[stellate cell]]s.<ref name=Menon01/> The production of oxidants derived from NADPH oxi- dase and/or [[cytochrome]] P-450 2E1 and the formation of acetaldehyde-protein adducts damage the [[cell membrane]].<ref name=Menon01/> 

[[Symptom]]s include [[jaundice]] (yellowing), liver enlargement, and pain and tenderness from the structural changes in damaged liver architecture. Without total abstinence from alcohol use,  will eventually lead to [[liver failure]]. Late complications of cirrhosis or liver failure include [[portal hypertension]] (high [[blood pressure]] in the [[portal vein]] due to the increased flow resistance through the damaged liver), [[Coagulopathy|coagulation disorders]] (due to impaired production of coagulation factors), [[ascites]] (heavy abdominal swelling due to build up of fluids in the tissues) and other complications, including [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and the [[hepatorenal syndrome]].

Cirrhosis can also result from other causes than alcohol abuse, such as [[viral hepatitis]] and heavy exposure to [[toxin]]s other than [[ethanol|alcohol]].  The late stages of cirrhosis may look similar medically, regardless of cause. This phenomenon is termed the "final common pathway" for the disease.

Fatty change and alcoholic hepatitis with [[abstinence]] can be reversible. The later stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis tend to be irreversible, but can usually be contained with abstinence for long periods of time.

==Diagnosis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
There are many tests to assess alcoholic liver damage. Besides blood examination, doctors use [[ultrasound]] and a [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] to assess liver damage. In some cases a [[liver biopsy]] is performed. This minor procedure is done under local [[anesthesia]], and involves placing a small needle in the liver and obtaining a piece of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The tissue is then sent to the laboratory to be examined under a [[microscope]]. The differential diagnoses for fatty liver non-alcoholic steatosis, drug-induced steatosis, include [[diabetes]], [[obesity]] and [[starvation]].

==Treatment==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010|reason=Only one fact is sourced in the entire multi-subsection section.}}
The first treatment of alcohol-induced liver disease is cessation of alcohol consumption. This is the only way to reverse liver damage or prevent liver injury from worsening. Without treatment, most patients with alcohol-induced liver damage will develop liver cirrhosis.
Other treatment for alcoholic hepatitis include:

===Nutrition===
Doctors recommend a calorie-rich diet to help the liver in its regeneration process. Dietary fat must be reduced because fat interferes with  alcohol metabolism. The diet is usually supplemented with [[vitamin]]s and [[dietary minerals]] (including [[calcium]] and [[Human iron metabolism|iron]]). {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Many nutritionists recommend a diet high in protein, with frequent small meals eaten during the day, about 5–6 instead of the usual 3. Nutritionally, supporting the liver and supplementing with nutrients that enhance liver function is recommended. These include [[carnitine]], which will help reverse fatty livers, and vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, aids in collagen synthesis, and increases the production of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin, as well as supplementing with the nutrients that have been depleted due to the alcohol consumption. Eliminating any food that may be manifesting as an intolerance and alkalizing the body is also important. There are some supplements that are recommended to help reduce cravings for alcohol, including choline, glutamine, and vitamin C. As research shows glucose increases the toxicity of centrilobular hepatotoxicants by inhibiting cell division and repair, it is suggested fatty acids are used by the liver instead of glucose as a fuel source to aid in repair; thus, it is recommended the patient consumes a diet high in protein and essential fatty acids, e.g. omega 3. Cessation of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, and increasing exercise are lifestyle recommendations to decrease the risk of liver disease caused by alcoholic stress. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Drugs===
Abstinence from alcohol intake and nutritional modification form the backbone in the management of ALD.  Symptom treatment can include: corticosteroids for severe cases, anticytokines ([[infliximab]] and pentoxifylline), [[propylthiouracil]] to modify metabolism and [[colchicine]] to inhibit hepatic fibrosis.

===Antioxidants===
It is widely believed{{By whom|date=June 2010}} that alcohol-induced liver damage occurs via generation of [[oxidant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Thus [[Alternative medicine|alternative health care practitioners]] routinely recommend natural [[antioxidant]] supplements like [[milk thistle]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. Currently, there exists no substantive clinical evidence to suggest that [[milk thistle]] or other [[antioxidant]] supplements are efficacious beyond placebo in treating liver disease caused by chronic alcohol consumption.<ref>

===Transplant===
When all else fails and the liver is severely damaged, the only alternative is a [[liver transplantation|liver transplant]]. While this is a viable option, liver transplant donors are scarce and usually there is a long waiting list in any given hospital. One of the criteria to become eligible for a liver transplant is to discontinue alcohol consumption for a minimum of six months.<ref>{{cite web

==Complications and prognosis==
As the liver scars, the [[blood vessel]]s become noncompliant and narrow. This leads to increased pressure in blood vessels entering the liver. Over time, this causes a backlog of blood (portal hypertension), and is associated with massive bleeding. Enlarged veins, also known as [[varicose veins]], also develop to bypass the blockages in the liver. These veins are very fragile and have a tendency to rupture and bleed. Variceal bleeding can be life-threatening and needs emergency treatment. Once the liver is damaged, fluid builds up in the abdomen and legs. The fluid buildup presses on the diaphragm and can make breathing very difficult.<ref>{{cite web

}} ([http://www.gi.org/patients/cgp/cgpvol2.asp#Alcoholic%20Liver Plain text version] also available.)</ref> As liver damage progresses, the liver is unable to get rid of pigments like [[bilirubin]] and both the skin and eyes turn yellow ([[jaundice]]). The dark pigment also causes the urine to appear dark; however, the stools appear pale. Also with the progression of the disease, the liver can release toxic substances (including [[ammonia]]) which then lead to brain damage. This results in altered mental state, and may cause behavior and personality changes.
