'''[[Reflex]] bradycardia''' is a [[bradycardia]] (decrease in [[heart rate]]) in response to the [[baroreceptor reflex]], one of the body's homeostatic mechanisms for preventing abnormal increases in [[blood pressure]]. In the presence of high [[mean arterial pressure]], the baroreceptor reflex produces a reflex bradycardia as a method of decreasing blood pressure by decreasing [[cardiac output]].

[[Blood Pressure]] (BP) is determined by cardiac output (CO) and [[total peripheral resistance]] (TPR), as represented by the formula BP = CO x TPR. Cardiac output (CO) is affected by two factors, the heart rate (HR) and the [[stroke volume]] (SV), the volume of blood pumped from one [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] of the heart with each beat (CO = HR x SV, therefore BP = HR x SV x TPR). In reflex bradycardia, blood pressure is reduced by decreasing cardiac output (CO) via a decrease in heart rate (HR).

An increase in blood pressure can be caused by increased cardiac output, increased total peripheral resistance, or both.
The [[baroreceptor]]s in the [[carotid sinus]] sense this increase in blood pressure and relay the information to the [[cardiovascular centre]]s in the [[brainstem]]. In order to maintain [[homeostasis]], the cardiovascular centres activate the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. Via the [[vagus nerve]], the parasympathetic nervous system stimulates neurons that release the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) at synapses with [[cardiomyocyte|cardiac muscle cells]]. Acetylcholine then binds to [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2|M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptors]], causing the decrease in heart rate that is referred to as reflex bradycardia. 

The M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptors decrease the heart rate by inhibiting [[depolarization]] of the [[sinoatrial node]] via [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub> protein]]-[[G protein-coupled receptor|coupled receptors]] and through modulation of [[muscarinic potassium channels]]. Additionally, M<sub>2</sub> receptors reduce the contractile forces of the atrial cardiac muscle and reduce the conduction velocity of the [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node). However, M<sub>2</sub> receptors have no effect on the contractile forces of the ventricular muscle.<ref name=doyle>{{cite journal |last=Doyle |first=D. John |last2=Mark |first2=Patrick W.
