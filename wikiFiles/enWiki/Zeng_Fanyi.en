'''Zeng Fanyi''' ({{zh|c=曾凡一|p=Zéng Fányī}}; born January 1968 in Shanghai) is [[stem cell]] [[scientist]] and professor at [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] (SJTU) medical school.

==Biography==
Zeng's father [[Zeng Yitao]] (曾溢滔) is a [[geneticist]] and academician of the [[Chinese Academy of Engineering]]. Both Zengs were students of [[Tan Jiazhen]],<ref>(《科学中国人》) ''Scientific Chinese'', '''11''', 2006: [http://www.gotoread.com/vo/2878/page303290.html A Family of Artists]</ref> who was a founder of modern genetics in China.<ref>Chinese Encyclopedia at [[Baidu]]. com: [http://baike.baidu.com/view/83607.htm The biography of Tan Jiazhen]</ref>

Zeng Fanyi obtained her Bachelor of Science from the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), and [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] and Ph.D. from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (UPenn) [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine|Medical School]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences]], respectively. Zeng also carried-out [[postdoctoral research]] at the University of Pennsylvania.

Zeng joined the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Basic Medicine Division) in Oct 2007. Currently, she is the [[vice-president]] of the Shanghai Institute of Medical Genetics at SJTU, where her father Zeng Yitao is [[director-general]]. Zeng Fanyi is also the Vice-president of the [[Shanghai Stem Cell Institute]].

==Research==
Zeng's research is mainly focused on medical genetics and [[developmental biology]].

In July 2009 Zeng, her co-workers, and her co-operational team published a paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', demonstrating for the first-time that an entire [[mammalian]] body can be generated from [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPSCs). They used [[mouse]] [[embryo]]s and created iPSCs by applying the same method as [[Shinya Yamanaka]]'s team. They further created [[Polyploidy|tetraploid]] embryos by fusing two early-stage [[fertilized]] embryos. They implanted these embryos and some of them finally developed into full mice. Twelve mice even [[mating|mate]]d and produced [[offspring]], which showed no physical deficiencies.<ref>''Nature News'': [http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090723/full/460560a.html Mice made from induced stem cells]</ref><ref>Zhao, X.-Y. et al.
