The '''salivary glands''' in [[mammal]]s are [[exocrine gland]]s, [[gland]]s with ducts, that produce [[saliva]]. They also secrete [[amylase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down [[starch]] into [[maltose]]. In other organisms such as [[insecta|insects]], salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like [[silk]] or glues, and [[fly]] salivary glands contain [[polytene chromosome]]s that have been useful in [[genetics|genetic]] research.

==Histology==
The gland is internally divided into [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobules]]. [[Blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s enter the glands at the [[hilum (anatomy)|hilum]] and gradually branch out into the lobules.

==Ducts==
In the duct system, the lumina are formed by [[intercalated duct]]s, which in turn join to form [[striated duct]]s. These drain into ducts situated between the lobes of the gland (called [[interlobar duct]]s or secretory ducts). 

All of the human salivary glands terminate in the mouth, where the saliva proceeds to aid in digestion. The saliva that salivary glands release is quickly inactivated in the stomach by the acid that is present there but the saliva also contains enzymes that are actually activated by the acid.

==Anatomy==

===Parotid glands===
{{main|Parotid gland}}
The parotid gland is a salivary gland wrapped around the [[mandibular ramus]] in humans. It is one of a pair being the largest of the salivary glands, it secretes saliva through Stensen's ducts into the oral cavity, to facilitate mastication and swallowing and to begin the digestion of starches.
The secretion produced is mainly serous in nature and enters the [[oral cavity]] via [[Stensen's duct]]. It is located posterior to the mandibular ramus and in front of the mastoid process of temporal bone.
This gland is clinically relevant in dissections of [[facial nerve]] branches while exposing the different lobes of it since any [[iatrogenic]] lesion will result in either loss of action or strength of muscles involved in [[facial expression]].

===Submandibular glands===
{{main|Submandibular gland}}
The submandibular glands are a pair of glands located beneath the lower jaws, superior to the [[digastric muscle]]s. The secretion produced is a mixture of both [[serous fluid]] and [[mucus]], and enters the [[oral cavity]] via [[Wharton's duct]]s. Approximately 70% of saliva in the oral cavity is produced by the submandibular glands, even though they are much smaller than the parotid glands.You can usually feel this gland, as it is in the upper neck and feels like a rounded ball. It is located about two fingers above the Adam's apple (on a man) and about two inches apart under the chin.

===Sublingual glands===
{{main|Sublingual gland}}
The sublingual glands are a pair of glands located beneath the tongue, anterior to the submandibular glands. The secretion produced is mainly mucus in nature, however it is categorized as a mixed gland. Unlike the other two major glands, the ductal system of the sublingual glands do not have striated ducts, and exit from 8-20 excretory ducts. Approximately 5% of saliva entering the oral cavity come from these glands.

===Minor salivary glands===
There are 800-1000 minor salivary glands located throughout the oral cavity within the [[submucosa]]<ref name="Ten Cate 2008">A.R TEN CATE, "Oral histology. Development, structure, and function".(1998), 2003, 2008|page=3|Edition=5thISBN=0-8151-2952-1</ref> of the [[oral mucosa]], apart from areas including the anterior third of the hard palate, the attached gingivaand the anterior third of the dorsal surface of the tongue.<ref name="Hupp 2008">{{cite book|last=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR|title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=397–400|edition=5th}}</ref> They are 1-2mm in diameter and unlike the other glands, they are not encapsulated by connective tissue only surrounded by it. The gland is usually a number of [[acini]] connected in a tiny lobule. A minor salivary gland may have a common excretory duct with another gland, or may have its own excretory duct. Their secretion is mainly mucous in nature (except for Von Ebner's glands) and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are sometimes associated with minor salivary glands.<ref name="Ten Cate 2008" />

====Von Ebner's glands====
{{main|Von Ebner's glands}}
Von Ebner's glands are glands found in [[circumvallate papillae]] of the tongue. They secrete a serous fluid that begin lipid hydrolysis. They facilitate the perception of [[taste]].

==Innervation==
Salivary glands are innervated, either directly or indirectly, by the [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] and [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] arms of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. Both result in increased amylase output and volume flow.

* ''Parasympathetic'' innervation to the salivary glands is carried via [[cranial nerve]]s. The parotid gland receives its parasympathetic input from the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (CN IX) via the [[otic ganglion]], while the submandibular and sublingual glands receive their parasympathetic input from the [[facial nerve]] (CN VII) via the [[submandibular ganglion]]. These nerves release acetylcholine and substance P, which activate the IP3 and DAG pathways respectively.

*  Direct ''sympathetic'' innervation of the salivary glands takes place via preganglionic nerves in the thoracic segments T1-T3 which synapse in the [[superior cervical ganglion]] with postganglionic neurons that release norepinephrine, which is then received by β-adrenergic receptors on the acinar and ductal cells of the salivary glands, leading to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and the corresponding increase of saliva secretion. Note that in this regard both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimuli result in an increase in salivary gland secretions.<ref>{{cite book

==Role in disease==

:''See [[mumps]] (parotiditis epidemica), [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[Mucocele]], [[Graft versus host disease]] and [[Salivary gland neoplasm]].''

[[Salivary duct calculus]] may cause blockage of the ducts, causing pain and swelling of the gland  because of [[cyst]]s.
Many anti-[[cancer]] treatments may impair salivary flow. [[Radiation therapy]] may cause permanent [[xerostomia]], whereas [[chemotherapy]] may cause only temporary salivary impairment. [[Graft versus host disease]] after [[allogeneic]] [[bone marrow transplantation]] may manifest as dry mouth and many small [[mucocele]]s.   
[[Tumor]]s of the salivary glands [[Salivary gland neoplasm|may occur]].

A [[sialogram]] is a [[radiocontrast]] study of a salivary duct.

Saliva production may be pharmacologically stimulated by so-called [[sialagogue]]s (e.g., [[pilocarpin]], [[cevimeline]]). It can also be suppressed by so-called [[antisialagogue]]s (e.g., [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, [[SSRI]], [[antihypertensives]], [[polypharmacy]]).

The salivary glands of some species, however, are modified to produce enzymes; salivary amylase is found in many, but by no means all, bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the [[venom]] glands of poisonous [[snake]]s, [[Gila monster]]s, and some [[shrew]]s, are modified salivary glands.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 299–300|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>
