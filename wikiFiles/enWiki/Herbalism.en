'''Herbal medicine''' (or '''"herbalism"''') is the study and use of medicinal properties of [[plant]]s. The scope of herbal [[medicine]] is sometimes extended to include [[fungi|fungal]] and [[bee]] products, as well as [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], [[Animal shell|shells]] and certain animal parts. [[Pharmacognosy]] is the study of all medicines that are derived from natural sources.

Plants have the ability to synthesize a wide variety of chemical compounds that are used to perform important biological functions, and to defend against attack from [[predator]]s such as [[insect]]s, [[fungi]] and [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]]s. Many of these [[phytochemicals]] have beneficial effects on long-term health when consumed by humans, and can be used to effectively treat human [[disease]]s. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total.<ref name="tapsell" /><ref name="lai" /> Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effects on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to be as effective as conventional medicines, but also gives them the same potential to cause harmful side effects.<ref name="tapsell">{{cite journal |author=Tapsell LC, Hemphill I, Cobiac L, ''et al.'' |title=Health benefits of herbs and spices: the past, the present, the future |journal=Med.

The use of plants as medicines predates written human history. [[Ethnobotany]] (the study of traditional human uses of plants) is recognized as an effective way to discover future medicines. In 2001, researchers identified 122 compounds used in modern medicine which were derived from "ethnomedical" plant sources; 80% of these have had an ethnomedical use identical or related to the current use of the active elements of the plant.<ref name=Fabricant2001>{{cite journal |author=Fabricant DS, Farnsworth NR |title=The value of plants used in traditional medicine for drug discovery |journal=Environ.

The use of [[herb]]s to treat [[disease]] is almost universal among non-industrialized societies, and is often more affordable than purchasing expensive modern pharmaceuticals. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that 80 percent of the population of some Asian and African countries presently use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care. Studies in the United States and Europe have shown that their use is less common in clinical settings, but has become increasingly more in recent years as scientific evidence about the effectiveness of herbal medicine has become more widely available.

==History==
The use of plants as medicines predates written human history. Many of the [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s used by humans to season food also yield useful medicinal compounds.<ref name="tapsell" /><ref name="lai" /> The use of herbs and spices in cuisine developed in part as a response to the threat of food-borne pathogens. Studies show that in tropical climates where pathogens are the most abundant, recipes are the most highly spiced.  Further, the spices with the most potent [[antimicrobial]] activity tend to be selected.<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Billing J, Sherman PW. | title = Antimicrobial functions of spices: why some like it hot | journal = Q Rev Biol. | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages =3–49 | year = 1998 | month = March | doi =10.1086/420058 | pmid = 9586227 | author =Billing, Jennifer | last2 =Sherman | first2 =PW  }}</ref> In all cultures vegetables are spiced less than meat, presumably because they are more resistant to spoilage.<ref>{{cite journal  | authorlink = Sherman PW, Hash GA. | title = Why vegetable recipes are not very spicy | journal = Evol Hum Behav. | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–163 |month=May | year=2001|doi =10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00068-4 | pmid = 11384883  | author =Sherman, P | last2 =Hash | first2 =GA  }}</ref> Many of the common weeds that populate human settlements, such as [[nettle]], [[dandelion]] and [[chickweed]], also have medicinal properties.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stepp, John R.|title=The role of weeds as sources of pharmaceuticals|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=92|issue=2–3|pages=163–166|month=June|year=2004|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2004.03.002|pmid=15137997}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Stepp, John R. & Moerman, Daniel E.|title = The importance of weeds in ethnopharmacology|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=75|issue=1|pages=19–23|month=April|year=2001|doi=10.1016/S0378-8741(00)00385-8|pmid=11282438}}</ref>

A large amount of [[archaeological]] evidence exists which indicates that humans were using medicinal plants during the [[Paleolithic]], approximately 60,000 years ago. (Furthermore, other non-human [[primates]] are also known to ingest medicinal plants to treat illness)<ref>{{cite book|author=Sumner, Judith|title=The Natural History of Medicinal Plants|publisher=Timber Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88192-483-0|page=16}}</ref><ref>Plant samples gathered from prehistoric burial sites are an example of the evidence supporting the claim that Paleolithic peoples had knowledge of herbal medicine.

===Early modern era===
{{expand section|date=July 2012}}
The 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries were the great age of herbals, many of them available for the first time in English and other languages rather than Latin or Greek.

The first herbal to be published in English was the anonymous ''Grete Herball'' of 1526. The two best-known herbals in English were ''The Herball or General History of Plants'' (1597) by [[John Gerard]] and ''The English Physician Enlarged'' (1653) by [[Nicholas Culpeper]]. Gerard’s text was basically a pirated translation of a book by the Belgian herbalist [[Rembert Dodoens|Dodoens]] and his illustrations came from a German botanical work. The original edition contained many errors due to faulty matching of the two parts. Culpepper’s blend of traditional medicine with astrology, magic, and folklore was ridiculed by the physicians of his day, yet his book - like Gerard’s and other herbals - enjoyed phenomenal popularity.  The [[Age of Exploration]] and the [[Columbian Exchange]] introduced new medicinal plants to Europe. The ''Badianus Manuscript'' was an illustrated [[Mexico|Mexican]] herbal written in [[Nahuatl]] and [[Latin]] in the 16th century.<ref>Gimmel, Millie. "Reading Medicine In The Codex De La Cruz Badiano." ''Journal Of The History Of Ideas'' 69.2 (2008): 169-192. ''Academic Search Premier.'' Web. 11 Mar. 2013.</ref>

The [[2nd millennium|second millennium]], however, also saw the beginning of a slow erosion of the pre-eminent position held by plants as sources of therapeutic effects. This began with the [[Black Death]], which the then dominant [[Four Element]] medical system proved powerless to stop. A century later, [[Paracelsus]] introduced the use of active chemical [[drug]]s (like [[arsenic]], [[copper sulfate]], [[iron]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulfur]]). These were accepted even though they had toxic effects because of the urgent need to treat [[Syphilis]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Many of the [[pharmaceuticals]] currently available to physicians have a long history of use as herbal remedies, including [[opium]], [[aspirin]], [[digitalis]], and [[quinine]].  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that 80 percent of the population of some Asian and African countries presently use herbal medicine for some aspect of primary health care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs134/en/|title=Traditional medicine}}</ref>  Pharmaceuticals are prohibitively expensive for most of the world's population, half of which lives on less than $2 U.S. per day.<ref name=Developingworld2002/>  In comparison, herbal medicines can be grown from seed or gathered from nature for little or no cost.

The use of, and search for, drugs and dietary supplements derived from plants have accelerated in recent years. [[Pharmacology|Pharmacologists]], [[microbiology|microbiologists]], [[botany|botanists]], and natural-products chemists are combing the Earth for [[phytochemical]]s and leads that could be developed for treatment of various diseases. In fact, according to the World Health Organisation, approximately 25% of modern drugs used in the United States have been derived from plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs134/en/ |title=Traditional medicine. }}</ref>

===Biological background===
[[File:Primula aka.jpg|right|thumb|The [[carotenoids]] in [[Primulaceae|primrose]] produce bright red, yellow and orange shades. People consuming diets rich in carotenoids from [[natural foods]], such as fruits and vegetables, are healthier and have lower mortality from a number of [[chronic illnesses]]]]
All plants produce [[chemical compounds]] as part of their normal [[metabolism|metabolic]] activities. These [[phytochemicals]] are divided into (1) [[primary metabolites]] such as [[sugar]]s and [[fat]]s, which are found in all plants; and (2) [[secondary metabolites]]—compounds which are found in a smaller range of plants, serving a more specific function.<ref name="meskin-2002-p123">{{cite book|author=Meskin, Mark S.|title=Phytochemicals in Nutrition and Health|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=9781587160837|page=123|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cJHsMALUDj0C&pg=PA123}}</ref> For example, some secondary metabolites are [[toxin]]s used to [[Plant defense against herbivory|deter predation]] and others are [[pheromone]]s used to attract insects for [[pollination]]. It is these secondary metabolites and pigments that can have therapeutic actions in humans and which can be refined to produce drugs—examples are [[inulin]] from the roots of [[dahlia]]s, [[quinine]] from the [[cinchona]], [[morphine]] and [[codeine]] from the [[poppy]], and [[digoxin]] from the [[digitalis|foxglove]].<ref name="meskin-2002-p123" />

Plants synthesize a bewildering variety of [[phytochemical]]s but most are derivatives of a few biochemical motifs:<ref>{{cite book|authors=Springbob, Karen & Kutchan, Toni M.|chapter=Introduction to the different classes of natural products|editor=Lanzotti, Virginia|title=Plant-Derived Natural Products: Synthesis, Function, and Application|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9780387854977|page=3|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y8SpVXEng4QC&pg=PA3}}</ref>
*'''[[Alkaloids]]''' are a class of chemical compounds containing a nitrogen ring. Alkaloids are produced by a large variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and are part of the group of natural products (also called secondary metabolites). Many alkaloids can be purified from crude extracts by acid-base extraction. Many alkaloids are toxic to other organisms. They often have pharmacological effects and are used as medications, as recreational drugs, or in entheogenic rituals. Examples are the local anesthetic and stimulant cocaine; the psychedelic psilocin; the stimulant caffeine; nicotine; the analgesic morphine; the antibacterial berberine; the anticancer compound vincristine; the antihypertension agent reserpine; the cholinomimeric galatamine; the spasmolysis agent atropine; the vasodilator vincamine; the anti-arhythmia compound quinidine; the anti-asthma therapeutic ephedrine; and the antimalarial drug quinine. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke a bitter taste.
*'''[[Polyphenol]]s''' (also known as phenolics) are compounds contain [[phenol]] rings. The [[anthocyanin]]s that give grapes their purple color, the [[isoflavone]]s, the [[phytoestrogen]]s from [[soy]] and the [[tannin]]s that give tea its astringency are phenolics.
*'''[[Glycosides]]''' is a molecule in which a sugar is bound to a non-carbohydrate moiety, usually a small organic molecule. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms. Many plants store chemicals in the form of inactive glycosides. These can be activated by enzyme hydrolysis, which causes the sugar part to be broken off, making the chemical available for use. Many such plant glycosides are used as medications. In animals and humans, poisons are often bound to sugar molecules as part of their elimination from the body. An example is the cyanoglycosides in cherry pits that release toxins only when bitten by a [[herbivore]].
* '''[[Terpenes]]''' are a large and diverse class of [[organic compounds]], produced by a variety of plants, particularly [[conifers]], which are often strong smelling and thus may have had a protective function. They are the major components of [[resin]], and of [[turpentine]] produced from resin. (The name "terpene" is derived from the word "turpentine"). Terpenes are major biosynthetic building blocks within nearly every living creature. Steroids, for example, are derivatives of the triterpene squalene. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as ''[[terpenoids]]''. Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. Essential oils are used widely as natural flavor additives for food, as fragrances in perfumery, and in traditional and alternative medicines such as aromatherapy. Synthetic variations and derivatives of natural terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of aromas used in perfumery and flavors used in food additives. [[Vitamin A]] is an example of a terpene. The fragrance of [[rose]] and [[lavender]] is due to [[monoterpene]]s. The [[carotenoid]]s  produce the reds, yellows and oranges of [[pumpkin]], [[Maize|corn]] and [[tomatoes]].

A consortium of plant molecular researchers at [[Washington State University]], the [[Donald Danforth Plant Science Center]], the [[National Center for Genome Resources]], and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] began an NIH-sponsored study of over thirty medicinal plant species late 2009. The initial work, to develop a sequence reference for the [[transcriptome]] of each, has led to the development of the Medicinal Plant Transcriptomics Database.

Herbalists criticize the manner in which many scientific studies make insufficient use of historical knowledge, which has been shown useful in drug discovery and development in the past and present.<ref name=Fabricant2001/>  They maintain that this traditional knowledge can guide the selection of factors such as optimal dose, species, time of harvesting and target population.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eric Yarnell, N.D., R.H., and Kathy Abascal, J.D| coauthors = | title = Dilemmas of Traditional Botanical Research | journal = HerbalGram. | volume = 55 | pages = 46–54 | year = 2002 }}</ref>

===Prevalence of use===
A survey released in May 2004 by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] focused on who used [[alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicines]] (CAM), what was used, and why it was used. The survey was limited to adults, aged 18 years and over during 2002, living in the [[United States]]. According to this survey, herbal therapy, or use of natural products other than [[vitamin]]s and minerals, was the most commonly used CAM therapy (18.9%) when all use of [[prayer]] was excluded.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nccam.nih.gov/news/report.pdf |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults: United States, 2002 |accessdate= September 16, 2006 |author= |last= Barnes |first= P M |authorlink= |coauthors= Powell-Griner E, McFann K, Nahin R L |date= 2004-05-27 |year= |month= |format= PDF |work= Advance data from vital and health statistics; no 343 |publisher= National Center for Health Statistics. 2004 |pages= 20 |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}} (See table 1 on page 8).</ref><ref>[http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2004/052704.htm More Than One-Third of U.S. Adults Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine] Press release, May 27, 2004.

Herbal remedies are very common in [[Europe]]. In [[Germany]], herbal medications are dispensed by apothecaries (e.g., Apotheke). Prescription drugs are sold alongside essential oils, herbal extracts, or [[tisane]]s. Herbal remedies are seen by some as a treatment to be preferred to pure medical compounds which have been industrially produced.<ref>{{cite journal| author = James A. Duke | year =  2000 | month =  Dec/January|title = Returning to our Medicinal Roots|journal = Mother Earth News|pages = 26–33|url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-73088521.html}}</ref>

In India, the herbal remedy is so popular that the Government of India has created a separate department - AYUSH - under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The National Medicinal Plants Board was also established in 2000 by the Govt. of India in order to deal with the herbal medical system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|coauthors=Sajwan|title=Revitalizing Indian systems of herbal medicine by the National Medicinal Plants Board through institutional networking and capacity building|journal=Current Science|year=2007|volume=93|issue=6|pages=797–806}}</ref>

Avid public interest in herbalism in the UK has been recently confirmed by the popularity of the topic in mainstream media, such as the prime-time hit TV series BBC's [[Grow Your Own Drugs]], which demonstrated how to grow and prepare herbal remedies at home.

===Herbal preparations===
There are many forms in which herbs can be administered, the most common of which is in the form of a liquid that is drunk by the patient—either a tisane or a (possibly diluted) plant extract.<ref name="saad-2011-p80" /> Whole herb consumption is also practiced either fresh, in dried form or as fresh [[juice]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Several methods of standardization may be determining the amount of herbs used. One is the ratio of raw materials to solvent. However different specimens of even the same plant species may vary in chemical content.  For this reason, [[thin layer chromatography]] is sometimes used by growers to assess the content of their products before use.  Another method is standardization on a signal chemical.<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Mark Blumenthal and Tara Hall | title = What is Herb Standardization? | journal = HerbalGram. | issue = 52 | pages = 25 | year =  2001

[[Tisane]]s, or "herbal teas", are the resultant liquid of extracting herbs into water, though they are made in a few different ways. [[Infusion]]s are hot water extracts of herbs, such as [[Matricaria recutita|chamomile]] or [[Mentha|mint]], through [[steeping]]. [[Decoction]]s are the long-term boiled extracts, usually of harder substances like roots or bark. [[Maceration (wine)|Maceration]] is the old infusion of plants with high [[mucilage]]-content, such as [[Common sage|sage]], [[thyme]], etc. To make macerates, plants are chopped and added to cold water. They are then left to stand for 7 to 12 hours (depending on herb used). For most macerates 10 hours is used.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

[[Tincture]]s are alcoholic extracts of herbs, which are generally stronger than tisanes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Green, James|title=The Herbal Medicine Maker's Handbook: A Home Manual|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2000|isbn=9780895949905|page=168|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5nxKJ7SocEUC&pg=PT168}}</ref> Usually obtained by combining 100% pure ethanol (or a mixture of 100% ethanol with water) with the herb.

Liquid extracts are liquids with a lower ethanol percentage than tinctures. They can (and are usually) made by vacuum [[Distillation|distilling]] tinctures. Dry extracts are extracts of plant material which are [[Evaporation|evaporated]] into a dry mass. They can then be further refined to a capsule or tablet.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> A nebulisate is a dry extract created by freeze-drying.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Vinegars]] are prepared at the same way as tinctures, except using a solution of [[acetic acid]] as the [[solvent]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Syrup]]s are extracts of herbs made with syrup or [[honey]].

The exact composition of a herbal product is influenced by the method of extraction. A tea will be rich in [[Chemical polarity|polar]] components because [[water]] is a [[polar solvent]]. Oil on the other hand is a [[non-polar]] solvent and it will absorb non-polar compounds.  Alcohol lies somewhere in between.<ref name="saad-2011-p80">{{cite book|authors=Saad, Bashar & Said, Omar|title=Greco-Arab and Islamic Herbal Medicine: Traditional System, Ethics, Safety, Efficacy, and Regulatory Issues|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2011|isbn=9780470474211|page=80|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-WQVF8nhKf4C&pg=PT80}}</ref>

Many herbs are applied topically to the skin in a variety of forms. [[Essential oil]] extracts can be applied to the skin, usually diluted in a carrier oil (many essential oils can burn the skin or are simply too high dose used straight – diluting in olive oil or another food grade oil such as almond oil can allow these to be used safely as a topical).<ref>{{cite web | title = Essential Oil Safety Information | url = http://aromaweb.com/articles/safety.asp}}{{verify credibility|date=July 2012}}</ref>{{verify credibility|date=July 2012}} Salves, oils, [[Liniment|balm]]s, creams and lotions are other forms of topical delivery mechanisms.Most topical applications are oil extractions of herbs. Taking a food grade oil and soaking herbs in it for anywhere from weeks to months allows certain phytochemicals to be extracted into the oil. This oil can then be made into salves, creams, lotions, or simply used as an oil for topical application. Any massage oils, antibacterial salves and wound healing compounds are made this way. One can also make a [[poultice]] or compress using whole herb (or the appropriate part of the plant) usually crushed or dried and re-hydrated with a small amount of water and then applied directly in a bandage, cloth or just as is.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[File:Picking of heads of Arnica montana.JPG|thumb|right|An herbalist gathers the flower heads of ''[[Arnica montana]]'']]
A herbalist is:<ref>''Webster's Unabridged''; 1977</ref><ref>''Webster's New International Dictionary''; 1934</ref><ref>''Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary''; 1971</ref>

#A person whose life is dedicated to the economic or medicinal uses of plants.
#One skilled in the harvesting and collection of medicinal plants (see wildcrafter).
#Traditional Chinese herbalist: one who is trained or skilled in the dispensing of herbal prescriptions; traditional Chinese herb doctor.  Similarly, Traditional Ayurvedic herbalist: one who is trained or skilled in the dispensing of herbal prescriptions in the Ayurvedic tradition.
#One trained or skilled in the therapeutic use of medicinal plants.

Herbalists must learn many skills, including the [[wildcrafting]] or cultivation of herbs, diagnosis and treatment of conditions or dispensing herbal medication, and preparations of herbal medications. Education of herbalists varies considerably in different areas of the world. Lay herbalists and traditional indigenous [[medicine man|medicine people]] generally rely upon apprenticeship and recognition from their communities in lieu of formal schooling. 

In some countries formalised training and minimum education standards exist, although these are not necessarily uniform within or between countries. For example, in Australia the currently self-regulated status of the profession (as of April 2008) results in different associations setting different educational standards, and subsequently recognising an educational institution or course of training. The National Herbalists Association of Australia is generally recognised as having the most rigorous professional standard within Australia.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Breakspear I | year = 2006 | title = Education and Regulation in Herbal Medicine: An Australian Perspective | url = | journal = Journal of the American Herbalists Guild | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 35–38 }}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]], the training of medical herbalists is done by state funded Universities. For example, [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees in herbal medicine are offered at Universities such as [[University of East London]], [[Middlesex University]], [[University of Central Lancashire]], [[University of Westminster]], [[University of Lincoln]] and [[Napier University]] in Edinburgh at the present.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

=== Government regulations ===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health, published ''Quality control methods for medicinal plant materials'' in 1998 in order to support WHO Member States in establishing quality standards and specifications for herbal materials, within the overall context of quality assurance and control of herbal medicines.<ref>[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh1791e/ WHO Quality Control Methods for Herbal Materials]</ref>

In the [[European Union]] (EU), herbal medicines are now regulated under the [[European Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products]].

In the [[United States]], most herbal remedies are regulated as [[dietary supplements]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  Manufacturers of products falling into this category are not required to prove the safety or efficacy of their product, though the FDA may withdraw a product from sale should it prove harmful.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/dshea.html US Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldman P |title=Herbal medicines today and the roots of modern pharmacology |journal=Ann.

The [[National Nutritional Foods Association]], the industry's largest trade association, has run a program since 2002, examining the products and factory conditions of member companies, giving them the right to display the [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]] ([[Good manufacturing practice|Good Manufacturing Practices]]) seal of approval on their products.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Some herbs, such as [[cannabis]] and [[coca]], are outright banned in most countries. Since 2004, the sales of [[ephedra]] as a dietary supplement is prohibited in the United States by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]].,<ref>[http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fpephed6.html FDA Issues Regulation Prohibiting Sale of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids and Reiterates Its Advice That Consumers Stop Using These Products]</ref> and subject to Schedule III restrictions in the United Kingdom.

Some researchers trained in both western and [[traditional Chinese medicine]] have attempted to deconstruct ancient medical texts in the light of modern science.  One idea is that the yin-yang balance, at least with regard to herbs,  corresponds to the pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant balance.  This interpretation is supported by several investigations of the [[Oxygen radical absorbance capacity|ORAC]] ratings of various yin and yang herbs.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1093/ecam/nem054| pmc = 2586310| last1 = Liao| pmid = 18955214| year = 2008| first1 = Hui| pages = 429–34| issue = 4| volume = 5| journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine| last2 = Banbury| first2 = Linda K.| last3 = Leach| first3 = David N.  |title=Antioxidant activity of 45 Chinese herbs and the relationship with their TCM characteristics}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

In [[India]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]] has quite complex formulas with 30 or more ingredients, including a sizable number of ingredients that have undergone "[[alchemy|alchemical processing]]", chosen to balance "[[Vata (dosha)|Vata]]", "[[Pitta]]" or "[[Kapha]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Preserving Ayurvedic herbal formulations by Vaidyas: The traditional healers of the Uttaranchal Himalaya region in India|journal=HerbalGram|year=2006|volume=70|pages=42–50}}</ref> ".<ref>[http://oneearthherbs.squarespace.com/language-of-herbs/ Tillotson Institute of Natural Health - The Language of Herbs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In Ladakh, Lahul-Spiti and Tibet, the [[Tibetan Medicine|Tibetan Medical System]] is prevalent, which is also called as 'Amichi Medical System'. Over 337 species of [[medicinal plant]]s has been documented by C.P. Kala those are used by Amchis - the practitioners of this medical system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Health traditions of Buddhist community and role of amchis in trans-Himalayan region of India|journal=Current Science|year=2005|volume=89|issue=8|pages=1331–1338}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Medicinal plants of Indian trans-Himalaya|year=2003|publisher=Bishen Singh Mahendra Pal Singh|location=Dehradun|pages=200}}</ref> 

In [[Tamil Nadu]], Tamils have their own medicinal system now popularly called the Siddha medicinal system. The Siddha system is entirely in  the [[Tamil language]]. It contains roughly 300,000 verses covering diverse aspects of medicine such as anatomy, sex ("kokokam" is the sexual treatise of par excellence), herbal, mineral and metallic compositions to cure many diseases that are relevant even to-day. Ayurveda is in [[Sanskrit]], but Sanskrit was not generally used as a mother tongue and hence its medines are mostly taken from Siddha and other local traditions.<ref>Theivaththin Kural, Chandrasekarendra saraswathi sankaracharya,Vol.3,pp737</ref>

==Herbal philosophy and spiritual practices==
{{Alternative medical systems}}
As Eisenburg states in his book, Encounters with [[Qi]]: “The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and Western medical models are like two frames of reference in which identical phenomena are studied. Neither frame of reference provides an unobstructed view of health and illness. Each is incomplete and in need of refinement."  Specifically, the traditional Chinese medical model could effect change on the recognized, and expected, phenomena of detachment to patients as people and estrangement unique to the clinical and impersonal relationships between patient and physician of the Western school of medicine.<ref>Eisenberg, David, and Thomas Lee Wright. Encounters with Qi: Exploring Chinese Medicine. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1995.</ref>

Four approaches to the use of plants as medicine include:<ref>{{cite web|last=Hirani|first=Sushma|title=Herbal Therapy|url=http://www.drhiranionline.com/herbal-therapy.htm|publisher=Sushma Hirani|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref>

1. The magical/shamanic—Almost all non-modern societies recognize this kind of use. The practitioner is regarded as endowed with gifts or powers that allow him/her to use herbs in a way that is hidden from the average person, and the herbs are said to affect the spirit or soul of the person.

2. The energetic—This approach includes the major systems of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], [[Ayurveda]], and [[Unani]]. Herbs are regarded as having actions in terms of their energies and affecting the energies of the body. The practitioner may have extensive training, and ideally be sensitive to energy, but need not have [[supernatural power]]s.

3. The functional dynamic—This approach was used by early physiomedical practitioners, whose doctrine forms the basis of contemporary practice in the UK. Herbs have a functional action, which is not necessarily linked to a physical compound, although often to a physiological function, but there is no explicit recourse to concepts involving energy.

4. The chemical—Modern practitioners - called [[Phytotherapist]]s - attempt to explain herb actions in terms of their chemical constituents. It is generally assumed that the specific combination of secondary metabolites in the plant are responsible for the activity claimed or demonstrated, a concept called synergy.

Herbalists tend to use extracts from parts of plants, such as the roots or leaves but not isolate particular phytochemicals.<ref>{{cite journal
