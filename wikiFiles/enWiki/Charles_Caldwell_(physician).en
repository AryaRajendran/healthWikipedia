'''Charles Caldwell''' (May 14, 1772 â€“ July 9, 1853, [[Nashville, Tennessee]]) was a noted 19th century U.S. physician who is best known for starting what would become the [[University of Louisville]] School of Medicine. Born to [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants in Caswell County, North Carolina, he earned an M.D. from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] in 1796 while studying under [[Benjamin Rush]]. After graduating, he practiced medicine in [[Philadelphia]] and was a lecturer at Penn. He also edited the "Port Folio" (one of the day's primary medical magazines) and  published over 200 medical publications.  

In 1819, he left Philadelphia to  join the fledgling medical school at Lexington, Kentucky's [[Transylvania University]], where he quickly turned the school into the region's strongest. In 1821, he convinced the Kentucky General Assembly to purchase $10,000 worth of science and medical books from [[France]], many of which are still held at the university.

Despite his success, his "abrasive" and "arrogant" temperament created enemies at Transylvania. The university's medical program would fold soon afterwards. The school dismissed him in 1837, and he then traveled with several colleagues to Louisville, where they created the [[Louisville Medical Institute]]. As at Transylvania, he made the new school an instant success, with its rapid growth into one of the region's best medical schools. However, he was forced out in 1849 due to a personal rivalry with [[Lunsford Yandell]].

Caldwell was one of the earliest supporters of [[polygenism]] in America. Caldwell attacked the position that environment was the cause of racial differences and argued instead that four races, Caucasian, Mongolian, American Indian, and African, were four different species, created separately by God.<ref>John P.
