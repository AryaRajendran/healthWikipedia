==Etiology and symptoms==

A nasal septal abscess is frequently a result of a secondary bacterial infection of a [[nasal septal hematoma]].  Individuals with this condition may also have [[fever]], general [[malaise]] and nasal pain, including enderness over the dorsum of the nose.  A bilateral persistant [[nasal obstruction]] may also be present.

==Complications==

Potential complications of a nasal septal abscess include cavernous sinus [[thrombophlebitis]], [[Nasal septum perforation|septal perforation]], or [[Saddle nose|saddle deformity]] due to cartilage necrosis.

==Treatment==

Treatment for a nasal septal abscess is similar to that of other bacterial infections. Aggressive [[broad spectrum antibiotics]] may be used after the infected area has been drained of fluids.
