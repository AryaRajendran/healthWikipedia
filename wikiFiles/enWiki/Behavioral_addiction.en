The [[ICD-10]] of the [[World Health Organization]] does not single out behavioural addictions as an independent spectrum of mental disorders. Its recognition among psychiatrists is supposed to be hampered by the fact that the [[aetiology]] and pathogenetic mechanisms of the whole variety of addictive behaviour patterns are as yet undetermined. As a rule, different scientists tackle with different deviations, with the consequence that the results obtained include but fragments of information concerning particular forms of addiction. Few, if any, complex and methodologically validated studies have been made of addiction as such.<ref>{{Ru icon}} Руководство по аддиктологии // Под. ред. проф. В.Д.&nbsp;Менделевича. СПб.: Речь, 2007. — С. 3-4.</ref> The very concept of behavioural addiction is to be explicated. Research workers point out the lack of a definition of addiction which is scientifically useful.<ref name="Goodman A. 1990 1403–8">{{cite journal |author=Goodman A. |title=Addiction: Definition and Implications |journal=Br J Addict |volume=85 |issue=11 |pages=1403–8 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2285834 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1990.tb01620.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119381659/abstract}}</ref>

Current investigations set out to clarify definitions and devise a diagnostic system. [[Patrick Carnes]] attaches paramount importance to a pathological relationship with a mood-altering experience.<ref>{{cite book | last = Carnes | first = Patrick | authorlink = Patrick Carnes |title= Out of the Shadows: Understanding Sexual Addiction |url= | edition   = 3rd | year = 2001 |publisher=[[Hazelden]] |isbn=1-800-328-0094 |pages=14}}</ref> [[Aviel Goodman]] indicates that Carnes’s formulation represents an advance from earlier definitions because it implies that the basis of addiction is not a substance or a behaviour but an alteration of the emotional state. And yet this approach is susceptible to the criticism. Unless Carnes’s definition is followed by a specific definition of “pathological relationship,” it does not provide enough information to be useful in a scientific context. While sharing the advantages of Carnes’s definition, A. Goodman endeavours to propose diagnostic criteria specified in a format similar to that of DSM. He defines addiction as a disorder in which a behaviour that can function both to produce pleasure and to provide escape from internal discomfort is employed in a pattern characterized by:
# recurrent failure to control the behaviour;
# continuation of the behaviour despite significant harmful consequences.<ref name="Goodman A. 1990 1403–8"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Goodman A. |title= Addiction concept involves theoretical and practical issues |journal= Psychiatric Times |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=29–33|year=1991 |month= |pmid= |doi= |url= }}</ref>

Behavioral addiction, which is sometimes referred to as impulse control disorders, are increasingly recognized as treatable forms of addictions.<ref>Grant, Jon: Impulse Control Disorders: A Clinician's Guide to Understanding and Treating Behavioral Addictions</ref>
The type of behaviors which some people have identified as being addictive include [[Problem gambling|gambling]], [[overeating|food]], [[sexual addiction|sex]], viewing of [[pornography addiction|pornography]], use of [[computer addiction|computers]], playing [[Video game addiction|video games]], use of the [[Internet addiction disorder|internet]], [[workaholic|work]], [[Physical exercise#Excessive exercise|exercise]], spiritual obsession (as opposed to religious devotion), [[self-harm|cutting]], and [[Compulsive buying disorder|shopping]]. 

When analyzing the addiction to food for example, a published study in 2009 from The Scripps Research Institute have shown for the first time that the same molecular mechanisms that drive people into drug addiction are behind the compulsion to overeat, pushing people into obesity. In this study, scientists focused on a particular receptor in the brain known to play an important role in vulnerability to drug addiction—the dopamine D2 receptor. The D2 receptor responds to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is released in the brain by pleasurable experiences like food or sex or drugs like cocaine.<ref>Compulsive Eating Shares Addictive Biochemical Mechanism; ScienceDaily (Mar. 29, 2010)</ref>

Behavioral addictions has been proposed as a new class in [[DSM-5]], but the only category included is gambling addiction. Internet addiction and sex addiction are included in the appendix.<ref name="urlNew Diagnostic Guidelines for Mental Illnesses Proposed: MedlinePlus">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_95121.html |title=New Diagnostic Guidelines for Mental Illnesses Proposed: MedlinePlus |work= |accessdate=2010-04-24| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100421072919/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_95121.html| archivedate= 21 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The term '''soft addiction''' was coined by [[Judith Sewell Wright]] to describe activities, [[Mood (psychology)|moods]] or ways of being, avoidances, and things - edible and consumable but which do not pose a grave health disease risk - rather, they have the most effect on personal time and [[productivity]].<ref>{{Cite book | year=2006 | title=The Soft Addiction Solution: Break Free of the Seemingly Harmless Habits that Keep You from the Life You Want | author1=Judith Wright | edition=revised, reprint | publisher=J.P.

==DSM / "Impulse control disorder"==
There is disagreement as to the exact nature of behavioral addiction or dependency.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goodman A |title=Addiction: definition and implications |journal=Br J Addict |volume=85 |issue=11 |pages=1403–8 |year=1990 |month=November |pmid=2285834 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1990.tb01620.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119381659/abstract}}</ref> However, the [[biopsychosocial|biopsychosocial model]] is generally accepted in scientific fields as the most comprehensive model for addiction. Historically, addiction has been defined with regard solely to psychoactive substances (for example [[alcoholism|alcohol]], [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]] and other [[drug addiction|drugs]]) which cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] once ingested, temporarily altering the chemical milieu of the brain. However, "studies on phenomenology, family history, and response to treatment suggest that [[intermittent explosive disorder]], [[kleptomania]], [[problem gambling]], [[pyromania]], and [[trichotillomania]] may be related to [[mood disorders]], alcohol and psychoactive [[substance abuse]], and [[anxiety disorders]] (especially [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]])."<ref>{{cite journal | last = McElroy| first = S.L.| authorlink = | coauthors = J.I.

In the case of pathological gambling, for example, the [[American Psychological Association]] classifies the condition as an [[impulse control disorder]] and not an addiction.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118730844/abstract Should the scope of addictive behaviors be broadened to include pathological gambling?]</ref>

==Dopamine on behaviors==
There are many similarities in the neurobiology of behavior and drug addictions. One of the most important discoveries of addictions has been the drug based reinforcement and, even more important, reward based learning processes. Several structures of the brain are important in the conditioning process of behavior addiction. One of the major areas of study includes the region, called the [[amygdala]], which involves emotional significance and associated learning. Research shows that dopaminergic projections to the amygdala facilitate a motivational or learned association to a specific behavior.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brewer|first=Judson A|coauthors=Marc N. Potenza|title=ScienceDirect - Biochemical Pharmacology : The Neurobiology and Genetics of Impulse Control Disorders: Relationships to Drug Addictions.|journal=ScienceDirect|date=1|year=2008|month=January|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295207004236|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>  The cycle that is created is considered the [[dopamine reward system]]. 

Dopamine neurons take a role in the learning and sustaining of many of the behaviors we acquire. Research specific to Parkinson’s disease has led to identifying the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the immediate actions of dopamine. The most common mechanism of dopamine is to create addictive properties along with certain behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Girault|first=Jean-Antoine|coauthors=Paul Greengard|title=Arch Neurol -- Abstract: The Neurobiology of Dopamine Signaling|journal=Archives of Neurology|year=2004|volume=61|series=5|issue=641|url=http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/61/5/641|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref> There are three stages to the dopamine reward system: bursts of dopamine, triggering of behavior, and further impact to the behavior. Once electronically signaled, possibly through the behavior, dopamine neurons let out a ‘burst-fire’ of elements to stimulate areas along fast transmitting pathways. The behavior response then perpetuates the striated neurons to further send stimuli. The fast firing of dopamine neurons can be monitored over time by evaluating the amount of extracellular concentrations of dopamine through micro dialysis and brain imaging. This monitoring can lead to a model in which one can see the multiplicity of triggering over a period of time.<ref name="dichiara">{{cite journal|last=Di Chiara|first=Gaetano|coauthors=Valentina Bassareo|title=Reward System and Addiction: What Dopamine Does and Doesn’t Do.|journal=Current Opinion in Pharmacology|year=2007|volume=7|issue=1|pages=69–76|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471489206002001#sec2|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>  Once the behavior is triggered, it is hard to work away from the dopamine reward system. 

Behaviors like gambling have been linked to the newfound idea of the brain’s capacity to predict rewards. The reward system can be triggered by early detectors of the behavior, and trigger dopamine neurons to begin stimulating behaviors. But in some cases, it can lead to many issues due to error, or reward-prediction errors. These errors can act as teaching signals to create a complex behavior task over time.<ref name="dichiara"/>

== Research ==
It is estimated that at least 90% of Americans have at least one form of soft addiction in their lives. Nadine Kaslow, PhD, professor of psychology and [[behavioral sciences]] at [[Emory University]] in Atlanta, has commented on the issue, saying that while it is healthy to relieve [[Stress (biology)|stress]] with behaviors like drinking coffee and watching television, when they become habitual they become problematic to one's [[health]] and [[happiness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=52408 |title=Soft addictions - information on |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>

Cyber-psychologist Kimberly Young, director of the Center for Online Addiction, has addressed [[Internet addiction]], one of the most common types of "soft addictions". Young has likened excessive Internet use to pathological gambling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.seacoastonline.com/news/03292007/health-f-m29-softaddictions.html |title=Portsmouth Herald Health News: You can get hooked on 'soft addictions' |publisher=Archive.seacoastonline.com |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>

Research around addictions and [[social media]] sites has been growing. The Retrevo company recently came out with research suggesting that there is an obsessiveness to the way people are checking their pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrevo.com/content/blog/2010/03/social-media-new-addiction%3F|title=Is Social Media a New Addiction?|accessdate=2011-11-18}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
