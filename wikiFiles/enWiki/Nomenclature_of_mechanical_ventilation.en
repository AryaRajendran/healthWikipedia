==Volume Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation==
'''[[Volume Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation]]''' — ('''VC-CMV''') Mechanical ventilation with preset tidal volume and inspiratory flow.

==Volume Controlled Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation==
'''[[Volume Controlled Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation]]''' — ('''VC-IMV''') Mechanical ventilation with preset tidal volume and inspiratory flow.

==Pressure Controlled Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation==
'''[[Pressure Controlled Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation]]''' — ('''PC-IMV''') Mechanical ventilation with preset inspiratory pressure and inspiratory time. Spontaneous breaths (i.e., inspiration is patient triggered and patient cycled) can exist between mandatory breaths.

===Terms replaced by PC-IMV===
* Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation

==Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation==
'''[[Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation]]''' — '''CSV''' is any mode of mechanical ventilation where every breath is spontaneous (i.e., patient triggered and patient cycled).

;Terms no longer in use:
* Spont
* Spontaneous

==Mandatory Breath==
'''[[Mandatory Breath]]''' is a breath type during mechanical ventilation for which inspiration is machine triggered and/or machine cycled. 

;Terms no longer in use:
* Machine breath
* mechanical breath

==Spontaneous Breath==
'''[[Spontaneous Breath]]'''s are a breath type for which inspiration is both patient triggered and patient cycled. Applies to assisted or unassisted breathing.

==Assisted Ventilation or Breath==
'''[[Assisted Ventilation]]''' or assisted breath references ventilation (or breath) for which a machine provides some or all of the [[work of breathing]].

;Terms no longer in use:
* Patient triggered ventilation
* Patient triggered breath

==Patient triggered breath==
'''[[Patient triggered breath]]''' — A breath that is initiated by the patient, independent of ventilator settings for frequency.

;Terms no longer in use
* Patient assisted breath
* assisted breath

==Autotriggering==
'''[[Autotriggering]]''' — Autotriggering is the unintended initiation of breath delivery by the ventilator, e.g., by an external disturbance such as movement of the breathing tube or an inappropriate trigger sensitivity setting.
;Terms no longer in use:
* Autocycling

==Non-standardized terminology==
The following are terms that are included in [[modes of mechanical ventilation]] but are not yet included in the standardized nomenclature.

===Volume related===
* V<sub>t</sub> — [[Tidal volume]]
* V<sub>e</sub> — [[Minute ventilation]]
* Amplitude — [[High-frequency ventilation]] (Active)

===Pressure related===
* P<sub>ip</sub> — [[Peak inspiratory pressure]]
* P<sub>plat</sub> — [[Plateau pressure (airway)]]
* M<sub>paw</sub> — [[Mean airway pressure]]
* E<sub>PAP</sub> — [[Continuous positive airway pressure|Pressure applied to exhalation]]
* I<sub>PAP</sub> — [[Continuous positive airway pressure|Pressure applied to inhalation]]
* P<sub>high</sub> — Highest pressure attained, similar to P<sub>ip</sub>; this is a constant pressure.
* P<sub>low</sub> — Pressure that P<sub>high</sub> drops to during expiratory time (T<sub>low</sub>)
* PEEP — [[Positive end-expiratory pressure]], pressure created by a backpressure valve.
* C<sub>PAP</sub> — [[Continuous positive airway pressure]]
* Δ<sub>p</sub> — [[Δp|Delta-P]], the change in pressure from the highest pressure to the lowest pressure.

===Time related===
* I:E — [[Inspiratory:Expiratory ratio]]
* T<sub>high</sub> — Time set for inhalation.
* T<sub>low</sub> — Time set for exhalation.
