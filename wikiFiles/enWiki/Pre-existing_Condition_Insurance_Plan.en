The '''Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan''' ('''PCIP''') is a form of [[health insurance]] coverage offered to uninsured Americans who have been unable to obtain coverage because of a [[Pre-existing condition|pre-existing health condition]]. The '''PCIP''' will provide coverage to as many as 350,000 people and fill the gap until the [[Affordable Care Act]] goes into effect in 2014. The plan has been funded by congress through the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor and distribute. States are either individually run or administered by HHS with 23 states and the District of Columbia. The plan is open through an Association (GEHA) or Government Employees Health Association. The program has since ceased in order to make certain funding would be sufficient to carry the existing approximately one hundred thousand (100,000) members it has taken on since PCIP inception. Federal states ended February 16, 2013 and the other states end date is March 2, 2013 cutoff.<ref name = ij>"U.S. Launches Pre-Existing Condition Health Insurance Plan." Insurance Journal.

The Affordable Care Act provides federal funding to support Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plans in every state and downloadable applications are available in the states where the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is running the PCIP. In those states, coverage will begin on August 1, 2010 for applicants who apply by July 15, 2010.<ref name = taca>"The Affordable Care Act — What it Means for Those with Pre-Existing Conditions."
