The '''social''' or '''mental hygiene movement''' of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was an attempt by [[Progressive Era|Progressive-era]] reformers to control [[venereal disease]], regulate [[prostitution]] and [[vice]], and disseminate [[sexual education]] through the use of [[scientific method|scientific]] research methods and modern media techniques.

The social hygiene movement represented a rationalized, professionalized version of the earlier [[social purity movement]].<ref name="Simmons1993">{{cite journal

Inspired by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]], they argued for the [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilisation]] of certain groups, even racial groups, in society. This link between [[racial hygiene]] and social hygiene can be seen in Australia, where the [[Racial Hygiene Association of New South Wales]] is now named The Family Planning Association.<ref>[http://www.fpahealth.org.au/news/20061102_80.html Family Planning NSW: News: Announcements: 80 years of Family Planning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Social hygiene as a profession grew alongside [[social work]] and other [[public health]] movements of the era.  Social hygienists emphasized sexual continence and strict self-discipline as a solution to societal ills, tracing prostitution, drug use and [[illegitimacy]] to rapid [[urbanization]].  

The [[American Social Hygiene Association]] was formed in 1913 and later renamed to the [[American Social Health Association]].

The movement remained alive throughout the 20th century and found its way into American schools, where it was transmitted in the form of classroom films about [[menstruation]], sexually transmitted disease, [[drug abuse]] and acceptable sexual behavior in addition to an array of [[pamphlet]]s, [[poster]]s, [[textbook]]s and [[film]]s.
