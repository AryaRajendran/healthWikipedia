'''Child mortality''', also known as '''under-5 mortality''', refers to the death of infants and children under the age of five. In 2011, 6.9 million children under five died,<ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012">[http://www.unicef.org/videoaudio/PDFs/UNICEF_2012_child_mortality_for_web_0904.pdf Levels & Trends in Child Mortality Report 2012 (U.N.)]</ref> down from 7.6 million in 2010,<ref name="UNICEF press release Sept. 2011">[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/15/us-child-mortality-rate-idUSTRE78E42820110915 UNICEF press release Sept. 2011]</ref> 8.1 million in 2009,<ref name="UNICEF press release Sept. 17, 2010">[http://www.unicef.org/media/media_56045.html UNICEF press relief September 17, 2010]</ref> and 12.4 million in 1990.<ref name="UNICEF press release Sept. 17, 2010"/> About half of child deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012"/> Reduction of child mortality is the fourth of the [[United Nations]]' [[Millennium Development Goals]].

Child Mortality Rate is the highest in low-income countries, such as most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. A child's death is emotionally and physically damaging for the mourning parents. Many deaths in the third world go unnoticed since many poor families cannot afford to register their babies in the government registry. <ref> Child Mortality</ref>

== Causes ==
According to UNICEF,<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/health/index_bigpicture.html UNICEF - Health - the big picture]</ref> most child deaths (and 70% in developing countries)<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/health/index_problem.html UNICEF - Health]</ref> result from one the following five causes or a combination thereof: 
*[[acute respiratory infection]]s
*[[diarrhea]]
*[[measles]]
*[[malaria]]
*[[malnutrition]]

== Prevention ==
{{main|Child survival}}

Two-thirds of child deaths are preventable.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index.html UNICEF - Young child survival and development].</ref> Most of the children who die each year could be saved by low-tech, evidence-based, cost-effective measures such as [[vaccine]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets, improved family care and [[breastfeeding]] practices
,<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/mdg/childmortality.html UNICEF MDG Goal 4]</ref> and [[oral rehydration therapy]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/release35/en/ New formula for oral rehydration salts will save millions of lives]</ref> Empowering women, removing financial and social barriers to accessing basic services, developing innovations that make the supply of critical services more available to the poor and increasing local accountability of health systems are policy interventions that have allowed health systems to improve equity and
reduce mortality.<ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012"/>

== Rate ==
The '''under-5 mortality rate''' is the number of children who die by the age of five, per thousand live births per year.  In 2011, the world average was 51 (5.1%), down from 87 (8.7%) in 1990. The average was 7 in developed countries and 57 developing countries, including 109 in sub-saharan Africa.<ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012"/> Likewise, there are disparities between wealthy and poor households in developing countries. According to a [[Save the Children]] paper, children from the poorest households in [[India]] are three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than those from the richest households.<ref>[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm Inequalities in child survival: looking at wealth and other socio-economic disparities in developing countries]</ref> However, there are also limitations in calculating an accurate rate in developing countries, especially in rural areas. An ethnographic study in Pacatuba, Brazil, found that the under-5 mortality rate only accounted for 44.4% of the actual deaths that occurred in the community. High travel costs, lost labor, and a withdrawal of socio-economic benefits are factors as to why deaths may not be reported to government vital statistics agencies within a country.<ref>Nations, Marilyn K., and Mara Lucia Amaral. 1991.

==Highest rates in the world==
In 2009, there were 31 countries reported in which at least 10% of children under five died. All were in [[Africa]], except for Afghanistan. The highest 10 were:<ref>[http://www.childinfo.org/mortality_ufmrcountrydata.php]</ref>

# [[Chad]] - 20.9%
# [[Afghanistan]] - 19.9%
# [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] - 19.9%
# [[Guinea-Bissau]] - 19.3%
# [[Sierra Leone]] - 19.2%
# [[Mali]] - 19.1%
# [[Somalia]] - 18.0%
# [[Central African Republic]] - 17.1%
