[[File:Crocosmia Aurea at Chelsea Physic Garden - geograph.org.uk - 1429573.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] has cultivated medicinal plants since 1673. The plant shown here is [[montbretia]] (''crocosmia aurea''), used as a remedy for [[dysentery]].]]

This is a '''list of plants that have been used as [[herbal medicine]]'''.  

Plants have the ability to synthesize a wide variety of chemical compounds that are used to perform important biological functions, and to defend against attack from predators such as insects, fungi and herbivorous mammals. Many of these [[phytochemicals]] have beneficial effects on long-term health when consumed by humans, and can be used to effectively treat human diseases. At least 12,000 such compounds have been isolated so far; a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total.<ref name="tapsell" /><ref name="lai" /> These [[phytochemicals]] are divided into (1) [[primary metabolites]] such as [[sugar]]s and [[fat]]s, which are found in all plants; and (2) [[secondary metabolites]] &ndash; compounds which are found in a smaller range of plants, serving a more specific function.<ref name="meskin-2002-p123">{{cite book|author=Meskin, Mark S.|title=Phytochemicals in Nutrition and Health|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=9781587160837|page=123|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cJHsMALUDj0C&pg=PA123}}</ref> For example, some secondary metabolites are [[toxin]]s used to [[Plant defense against herbivory|deter predation]] and others are [[pheromone]]s used to attract insects for [[pollination]]. It is these secondary metabolites and pigments that can have therapeutic actions in humans and which can be refined to produce drugs—examples are [[inulin]] from the roots of [[dahlia]]s, [[quinine]] from the [[cinchona]], [[morphine]] and [[codeine]] from the [[poppy]], and [[digoxin]] from the [[digitalis|foxglove]].<ref name="meskin-2002-p123" /> Chemical compounds in plants mediate their effects on the human body through processes identical to those already well understood for the chemical compounds in conventional drugs; thus herbal medicines do not differ greatly from conventional drugs in terms of how they work. This enables herbal medicines to be as effective as conventional medicines, but also gives them the same potential to cause harmful side effects.<ref name="tapsell">{{cite journal |author=Tapsell LC, Hemphill I, Cobiac L, ''et al.'' |title=Health benefits of herbs and spices: the past, the present, the future |journal=Med.

Most cultures have a tradition of using plants medicinally. In Europe, [[apothecary|apothecaries]] stocked herbal ingredients for their medicines. In the [[binomial nomenclature|Latin names for plants]] created by [[Linnaeus]], the word ''[[officinalis]]'' indicates that a plant was used in this way. For example, the [[Althaea officinalis|marsh mallow]] has the classification ''Althaea officinalis'', as it was traditionally used as an [[emollient]] to soothe [[ulcer]]s.<ref name="haubrich">{{Cite book |title=Medical meanings: a glossary of word origins |author=William S. Haubrich |chapter=officina |page=162 | year=2003 |isbn=978-1-930513-49-5 |postscript=.}}</ref> [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic medicine]], [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] and [[traditional Chinese medicine]] are other examples of medical practices that incorporate medical uses of plants. [[Pharmacognosy]] is the branch of modern medicine about medicines from plant sources. Plants included here are those that have been or are being used medicinally, in at least one such medicinal tradition.

[[Modern medicine]] now tends to use the active ingredients of plants rather than the whole plants. The [[phytochemical]]s may be synthesized, compounded or otherwise transformed to make [[pharmaceutical]]s. Examples of such derivatives include [[Digoxin]], from [[digitalis]]; [[capsaicine]], from [[capsicum|chili]]; and [[aspirin]], which is chemically related to the [[salicylic acid]] found in [[white willow]]. The opium poppy continues to be a major industrial source of opiates, including [[morphine]]. Few traditional remedies, however, have translated into modern drugs, although there is continuing research into the efficacy and possible adaptation of traditional herbal treatments.
