'''Bell's palsy''' is a form of [[Facial_nerve_paralysis|facial paralysis]] resulting from a dysfunction of the cranial nerve VII (the [[facial nerve]]) causing an inability to control facial muscles on the affected side. Several conditions can cause facial paralysis, e.g., [[brain tumor]], [[stroke]], [[myasthenia gravis]], and [[Lyme disease]]. However, if no specific cause can be identified, the condition is known as Bell's palsy.  Named after Scottish anatomist [[Charles Bell]], who first described it, Bell's palsy is the most common acute [[Peripheral neuropathy|mononeuropathy]] (disease involving only one [[nerve]]) and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis (>80%). 

Bell's palsy is defined as an [[idiopathic]] [[Wiktionary:Unilateral|unilateral]] facial nerve paralysis, usually self-limiting.  The hallmark of this condition is a rapid onset of partial or complete paralysis that often occurs overnight. In rare cases (<1%), it can occur [[Wiktionary:Bilateral|bilaterally]] resulting in total facial paralysis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Price, Fife|title=Bilateral simultaneous facial nerve palsy|journal=J Laryngol Otol.|year=2002|month=January |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=46–8|pmid=11860653|doi=10.1258/0022215021910113|first1=T|last2=Fife|first2=DG}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Jain V, Deshmukh A, Gollomp S |title=Bilateral facial paralysis: case presentation and discussion of differential diagnosis |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=C7–10 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16808763 |pmc=1924702 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00466.x }}</ref> 

It is thought that an inflammatory condition leads to swelling of the [[facial nerve]].  The nerve travels through the skull in a narrow bone canal beneath the ear.  Nerve swelling and compression in the narrow bone canal are thought to lead to nerve inhibition, damage or death.

[[Corticosteroids]] have been found to improve outcomes, when used early, while anti-viral drugs have not.<ref name="Sullivan-NEJM">{{cite journal |author=Sullivan FM |title=Early treatment with prednisolone or acyclovir in Bell's palsy |journal=N.

Many show signs of improvement as early as 10 days after the onset, even without treatment.

Often the eye in the affected side cannot be closed.  The eye must be protected from drying up, or the [[cornea]] may be permanently damaged resulting in impaired vision. In some cases denture wearers experience some discomfort.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Cranial nerve VII.svg|thumb|[[Facial nerve]]: the facial nerve's nuclei are in the [[brainstem]] (they are represented in the diagram as a „θ“). Orange: nerves coming from the left hemisphere of the brain.　Yellow: nerves coming from the right hemisphere of the brain. Note that the forehead muscles receive innervation from both hemispheres of the brain (represented in yellow and orange).]]

Bell's palsy is characterized by facial drooping on the affected half, due to malfunction of the [[facial nerve]] (VII [[cranial nerve]]), which controls the [[muscle]]s of the face. Facial palsy is typified by inability to control movement in the facial muscles.  The paralysis is of the infranuclear/lower motor neuron type.

The facial nerves control a number of functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, frowning, lacrimation, salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. They also innervate the stapedial ([[stapes]]) muscles of the [[middle ear]] and carry taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.  

Clinicians should determine whether the [[forehead]] muscles are spared. Due to an anatomical peculiarity, forehead muscles receive [[innervation]] from both sides of the [[Human brain|brain]].  The forehead can therefore still be wrinkled by a patient whose facial palsy is caused by a problem in one of the hemispheres of the brain ([[central facial palsy]]).  If the problem resides in the facial nerve itself ([[peripheral neuropathy|peripheral palsy]]) all nerve signals are lost on the ipsilateral (same side of the lesion) half side of the face, including to the forehead (contralateral forehead still wrinkles).

One disease that may be difficult to exclude in the [[differential diagnosis]] is involvement of the facial nerve in infections with the [[herpes zoster]] virus. The major differences in this condition are the presence of small blisters, or ''vesicles'', on the external ear and hearing disturbances, but these findings may occasionally be lacking ([[herpes zoster#Zoster sine herpete|zoster sine herpete]]). Reactivation of existing [[herpes zoster]] infection leading to facial paralysis in a Bell's palsy type pattern is known as [[Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II|Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2]].

[[Lyme disease]] may produce the typical palsy, and may be easily diagnosed by looking for Lyme-specific [[antibodies]] in the blood or [[erythema migrans]]. In endemic areas [[Lyme disease]] may be the most common cause of facial palsy.

The degree of nerve damage can be assessed using the [[House-Brackmann score]].

Because both the [[nerve to the stapedius]] and the [[Chorda tympani|chorda tympani nerve (taste)]] are branches of the facial nerve, patients with Bell's palsy may present with [[hyperacusis]] or loss of taste sensation in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue.

Although defined as a [[mononeuropathy|mononeuritis]]  (involving only one nerve), patients diagnosed with Bell’s palsy may have "myriad neurological symptoms" including "facial tingling, moderate or severe headache/neck pain, memory problems, balance problems, ipsilateral limb paresthesias, ipsilateral limb weakness, and a sense of clumsiness" that are "unexplained by facial nerve dysfunction".<ref name=Morris/> This is yet an enigmatic facet of this condition.

Once the facial paralysis sets in, many people may mistake it as a symptom of a stroke. But there are a few subtle differences. A stroke will usually cause a few additional symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. And unlike Bell's palsy, a stroke will usually let patients control the upper part of their faces. A person with a stroke will usually have some wrinkling of their forehead.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/c-tv-reporter-loses-her-smile-bells-palsy-164432652--abc-news-wellness.html S.C.

==Cause==
Some viruses <!-- "viruses" is correct English, not vira (used as proper pl. Latin in other languages), cf wiki article [[Plural of virus]] --> are thought to establish a persistent (or latent) infection without symptoms, e.g., the [[Herpes zoster#Pathophysiology|varicella-zoster]] virus<ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/facial_nerve_problems/page3.htm Facial Nerve Problems and Bell's Palsy Information on MedicineNet.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Epstein-Barr virus|Epstein-Barr]] viruses, both of the herpes family.  Reactivation of an existing (dormant) viral infection has been suggested<ref name=Furuta/> as a cause behind the acute Bell's palsy.  Studies<ref name=Kasse>{{cite journal |author=Kasse C.A, Ferri R.G, Vietler E.Y.C, Leonhardt F.D, Testa J.R.G, Cruz O.L.M |title=Clinical data and prognosis in 1521 cases of Bell's palsy |journal=International Congress Series |volume=1240 |pages=641–7 |date=October 2003 |doi=10.1016/S0531-5131(03)00757-X |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S053151310300757X}}</ref> suggest that this new activation could be preceded by trauma, environmental factors, and metabolic or emotional disorders, thus suggesting that stress—emotional stress, environmental stress (e.g., cold), physical stress (e.g., trauma)—in short, a host of different conditions, may trigger reactivation.

==Pathology==

[[Image:Gray781.png|thumb|Anatomy of the face.]]

It is thought that as a result of [[inflammation]] of the facial nerve, pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal, blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with facial palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are '''not''' considered to have Bell's palsy ''per se''. Possible causes include [[tumor]], [[meningitis]], [[stroke]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[head injury|head trauma]] and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves ([[sarcoidosis]], [[brucellosis]], etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to the facial nerve. Babies can be born with facial palsy.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001425.htm - MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma] retrieved 10 September 2008</ref> In a few cases, bilateral facial palsy has been associated with [[acute HIV infection]]. 

In some research<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murakami S, Mizobuchi M, Nakashiro Y, Doi T, Hato N, Yanagihara N |title=Bell palsy and herpes simplex virus: identification of viral DNA in endoneurial fluid and muscle |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=124 |issue=1 Pt 1 |pages=27–30 |year=1996 |pmid=7503474 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7503474 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-124-1_Part_1-199601010-00005}}</ref> the [[herpes simplex virus]] type 1 (HSV-1) was identified in a majority of cases diagnosed as Bell's palsy.  This has given hope for anti-inflammatory and anti-viral drug therapy (prednisone and acyclovir).  Other research<ref name=Furuta>{{cite journal |author=Furuta Y, Ohtani F, Chida E, Mesuda Y, Fukuda S, Inuyama Y |title=Herpes simplex virus type 1 reactivation and antiviral therapy in patients with acute peripheral facial palsy |journal=Auris Nasus Larynx |volume=28 |issue=Suppl |pages=S13–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11683332 |doi= 10.1016/S0385-8146(00)00105-X}}</ref> however, identifies HSV-1 in only 31 cases (18 percent),  [[herpes zoster]] (zoster sine herpete) in 45 cases (26 percent) in a total of 176 cases clinically diagnosed as Bell's Palsy.  That infection with herpes simplex virus should play ''a major role'' in cases diagnosed as Bell's palsy therefore remains a hypothesis that requires further research.

In addition, the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection is associated with [[demyelination]] of nerves.  This nerve damage mechanism is ''different'' from the above mentioned - that edema, swelling and compression of the nerve in the narrow bone canal is responsible for nerve damage.  Demyelination may not even be directly caused by the virus, but by an unknown [[immune system]] response.  The quote below captures this hypothesis and the implication for other types of treatment:
<blockquote>
It is also possible that HSV-1 replication itself is not responsible for the damage to the facial nerves and that inhibition of HSV-1 replication by acyclovir does not prevent the progression of nerve dysfunction. Because the demyelination of facial nerves caused by HSV-1 reactivation, via an unknown immune response, is implicated in the pathogenesis of HSV-1-induced facial palsy, a new strategy of treatment to inhibit such an immune reaction may be also effective.<ref name=Furuta/>
</blockquote>

==Diagnosis==
Bell's palsy is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]]; by elimination of other reasonable possibilities. Therefore,  by definition, no specific cause can be ascertained.  Bell's palsy is commonly referred to as [[idiopathic]] or [[cryptogenic disease|cryptogenic]], meaning that it is due to unknown causes.  Being a residual diagnostic category, the Bell's Palsy diagnosis likely spans different conditions that our current level of medical knowledge cannot distinguish.  This may inject fundamental uncertainty into the discussion below of [[etiology]], treatment options, recovery patterns, etc.  See also the section below on Other symptoms.
Studies<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal |author=Morris AM |title=Annualized incidence and spectrum of illness from an outbreak investigation of Bell's palsy |journal=Neuroepidemiology |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=255–61 |year=2002 |pmid=12207155 |doi= 10.1159/000065645|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=ned21255 |author-separator=, |author2=Deeks SL |author3=Hill MD |display-authors=3 |last4=Midroni |first4=Gyl |last5=Goldstein |first5=Warren C. |last6=Mazzulli |first6=Tony |last7=Davidson |first7=Ross |last8=Squires |first8=Susan G. |last9=Marrie |first9=Thomas}}</ref> show that a large number of patients (45%) are not referred to a specialist, which suggests that Bell’s palsy is considered by physicians to be a straightforward diagnosis that is easy to manage.  A significant number of cases are misdiagnosed (Ibid.).  This is unsurprising from a diagnosis of exclusion, which depends on a thorough investigation.

==Treatment==
Bell's palsy affects each individual differently. Steroids have been shown to be effective at improving recovery while antivirals have not.

===Steroids===
[[Corticosteroid]] such as [[prednisone]] significantly improves recovery at 6 months and are thus recommended.<ref name="Salinas RA, Alvarez G, Daly F, Ferreira J 2010 CD001942">{{cite journal |author=Salinas RA, Alvarez G, Daly F, Ferreira J |title=Corticosteroids for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=3 |issue= 3|pages=CD001942 |year=2010 |pmid=20238317 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001942.pub4 |editor1-last=Salinas |editor1-first=Rodrigo A}}</ref> Early treatment (within 3 days after the onset) is necessary for benefit<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hazin|first=R|coauthors=Azizzadeh, B; Bhatti, MT|title=Medical and surgical management of facial nerve palsy|journal=Current opinion in ophthalmology|date=2009 Nov|volume=20|issue=6|pages=440–50|pmid=19696671|doi=10.1097/ICU.0b013e3283313cbf}}</ref> with a 14% greater probability of recovery.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gronseth|first=GS|coauthors=Paduga, R|title=Evidence-based guideline update: Steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: Report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology|journal=Neurology|date=2012 Nov 7|pmid=23136264|volume=79|issue=22|pages=2209–13|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e318275978c}}</ref>

===Antivirals===
[[Antivirals]] (such as [[acyclovir]]) are ineffective in improving recovery from Bell's palsy beyond steroids alone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lockhart P, Daly F, Pitkethly M, Comerford N, Sullivan F |title=Antiviral treatment for Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD001869 |year=2009 |pmid=19821283 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001869.pub4 |editor1-last=Lockhart |editor1-first=Pauline}}</ref>  They were however commonly prescribed due to a theoretical link between Bell's palsy and the [[herpes simplex]] and [[varicella zoster virus]].<ref name="Sullivan-NEJM"/> There is still the possibility that they might result in a benefit less than 7% as this has not been ruled out.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gronseth|first=GS|coauthors=Paduga, R; American Academy of, Neurology|title=Evidence-based guideline update: steroids and antivirals for Bell palsy: report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology|journal=Neurology|date=2012 Nov 27|volume=79|issue=22|pages=2209–13|pmid=23136264|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e318275978c}}</ref>

===Physiotherapy===
[[Physiotherapy]] can be beneficial to some individuals with Bell’s palsy as it helps to maintain [[muscle tone]] of the affected [[facial muscles]] and stimulate the [[facial nerve]].<ref name="ninds">{{cite web | url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/bells/detail_bells.htm| title = Bell's Palsy Fact Sheet | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | first = NINDS | date = 2003-04 | publisher = National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110408004237/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/bells/detail_bells.htm| archivedate= 8 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is important that muscle re-education exercises and [[soft tissue technique]]s be implemented prior to recovery in order to help prevent permanent [[contractures]] of the [[paralyzed]] facial muscles.<ref name="ninds"/> To reduce [[pain]], heat can be applied to the affected side of the face.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The treatment of facial palsy from the point of view of physical and rehabilitation medicine | journal = Europa Medicophysica | date = 2006-03 | first = TS | last = Shafshak | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–7 | pmid = 16565685}}</ref>

===Complementary therapy===
The efficacy of [[acupuncture]] remains unknown because the available studies are of low quality (poor primary study design or inadequate reporting practices).<ref name="acupuncture">{{cite journal |author=He L |title=Acupuncture for Bell's palsy |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD002914 |year=2007 |pmid=17943775 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002914.pub3 |editor1-last=He |editor1-first=Li |author-separator=, |author2=Zhou MK |author3=Zhou D |display-authors=3 |last4=Wu |first4=B |last5=Li |first5=N |last6=Kong |first6=SY |last7=Zhang |first7=DP |last8=Li |first8=QF |last9=Yang |first9=J}}</ref>

== Prognosis==
Most patients with Bell palsy regain normal facial function within 3 weeks—even those who do not receive treatment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Karnath|first=B.|title=Bell Palsy: Updated Guideline for Treatment|url=http://www.consultant360.com/article/bell-palsy-updated-guideline-treatment|work=Consultant|publisher=HMP Communications|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}</ref>  In a 1982 study, when no treatment was available, of 1,011 patients, 85% showed first signs of recovery within 3 weeks after onset. For the other 15%, recovery occurred 3–6 months later. After a follow-up of at least 1 year or until restoration, complete recovery had occurred in more than two-thirds (71%) of all patients. Recovery was judged moderate in 12% and poor in only 4% of patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peitersen E |title=The natural history of Bell's palsy |journal=Am J Otol |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=107–11 |year=1982 |pmid=7148998 }} quoted in {{cite journal |author=Roob G, Fazekas F, Hartung HP |title=Peripheral facial palsy: etiology, diagnosis and treatment |journal=Eur.

Major complications of the condition are chronic loss of taste ([[ageusia]]), chronic facial [[spasm]], facial pain and corneal infections. To prevent the latter, the eyes may be protected by covers, or taped shut during sleep and for rest periods, and tear-like eye drops or eye ointments may be recommended, especially for cases with complete [[paralysis]]. Where the eye does not close completely, the blink reflex is also affected, and care must be taken to protect the eye from injury.

Another complication can occur in case of incomplete or erroneous regeneration of the damaged facial nerve. The nerve can be thought of as a bundle of smaller individual nerve connections that branch out to their proper destinations. During regrowth, nerves are generally able to track the original path to the right destination - but some nerves may sidetrack leading to a condition known as [[synkinesis]]. For instance, regrowth of nerves controlling muscles attached to the eye may sidetrack and also regrow connections reaching the muscles of the mouth. In this way, movement of one also affects the other. For example, when the person closes the eye, the corner of the mouth lifts involuntarily.

Around 9%<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yamamoto E, Nishimura H, Hirono Y |title=Occurrence of sequelae in Bell's palsy |journal=Acta Otolaryngol Suppl |volume=446 |pages=93–6 |year=1988 |pmid=3166596 }}</ref> of patients have some sort of sequelae after Bell's palsy, typically the synkinesis already discussed, or spasm, contracture, [[tinnitus]] and/or hearing loss during facial movement or [[Tears#Diseases and disorders|crocodile tear syndrome]]. This is also called gustatolacrimal reflex or Bogorad’s Syndrome and involves the sufferer shedding tears while eating. This is thought to be due to [[synkinesis|faulty regeneration]] of the facial nerve, a branch of which controls the lacrimal and salivary glands. Gustatorial sweating can also occur.

==History==
{{See also|List of cases of Bell's palsy}}
This lesion was described by Sir [[Charles Bell]], a [[Scot]]tish surgeon. In 1829 he presented three cases at the [[Royal Society of London]]. Two cases were idiopathic and the third was due to a [[tumour]] of the [[parotid gland]].

Although it is named after Sir Charles Bell, the Scottish anatomist who provide the first anatomic basis for trigeminal neuralgia and facial palsy, other European physicians provided earlier clinical descriptions of peripheral cranial nerve 7 palsy. In a recent review article describing history of facial palsy by Greek, Roman, and Persian physicians, <ref>{{cite journal |author=Sajadi MM, Sajadi MR, Tabatabaie SM |title=The history of facial palsy and spasm: Hippocrates to Razi |journal=Neurology |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=174–8 |year=2011 |month=July |pmid=21747074 |pmc=3140075 |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182242d23 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21747074}}</ref> and several previous reports <ref>{{cite journal |author=van de Graaf RC, Nicolai JP |title=Bell's palsy before Bell: Cornelis Stalpart van der Wiel's observation of Bell's palsy in 1683 |journal=Otol.

Cornelis Stalpart van der Wiel (1620–1702) in 1683 gave an account of Bell’s palsy and credited [[Avicenna]] (980–1037) for describing this condition before him.
