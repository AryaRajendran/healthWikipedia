'''Tocolytics''' (also called '''anti-contraction medications''' or '''labor repressants''') are medications used to suppress [[premature labor]] (from the Greek ''tokos'', [[childbirth]], and ''lytic'',  capable of dissolving). They are given when delivery would result in [[premature birth]]. The therapy also buys time for the administration of [[betamethasone]], a [[glucocorticoid]] drug which greatly accelerates fetal lung maturity, but takes one to two days to work.

The suppression of contractions is often only partial and tocolytics can only be relied on to delay birth for several days. Depending on the tocolytic used the mother or fetus may require monitoring, as for instance blood pressure monitoring when [[nifedipine]] is used as it reduces blood pressure. In any case the risk of preterm labor alone justifies hospitalization.

==Types of agents==
There is no clear [[First-line treatment|first-line]] tocolytic agent.<ref name=Tan>{{Cite journal|author=Tan TC, Devendra K, Tan LK, Tan HK |title=Tocolytic treatment for the management of preterm labour: a systematic review |journal=Singapore Med J |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=361–6 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16645683 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19264820">{{Cite journal|author=de Heus R, Mol BW, Erwich JJ, ''et al.'' |title=Adverse drug reactions to tocolytic treatment for preterm labour: prospective cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |issue= |pages=b744 |year=2009 |pmid=19264820 |pmc=2654772 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.b744|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19264820}}</ref>

Various types of agents are used, with varying success rates and side effects.  Some medications are not specifically approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in stopping uterine contractions in preterm labor, instead being used [[off-label use|off label]].

The efficacy of beta-agonists, atosiban and indomethacin is a decreased [[odds ratio]] (OR) of delivery within 24 hours of 0.54 (95 percent [[confidence interval]] (CI): 0.32-0.91) and 0.47 within 48 hours (OR 0.47, 95 percent CI 0.30-0.75).<ref name=Tan/>

Antibiotics may delay the onset of labor in women with [[premature rupture of membranes]], but this is not usually characterized as tocolysis.

==Contraindications to tocolysis==
In addition to drug-specific contraindications,<ref name=ACOG/> several general factors may contraindicate delaying birth with the use of tocolytic medications.

*Fetus is older than 34 weeks gestation <ref name=wong>Wong, Perry, and Hockenberry. Maternal Child Nursing Care. Mosby 2002</ref>
*Fetus weighs less than 2500&nbsp;grams or has [[intrauterine growth restriction]] (IUGR)<ref name=wong/> or [[placental insufficiency]]<ref name=ACOG/>
*Lethal congenital or chromosomal abnormalities<ref name=ACOG/><ref name=wong/>
*[[Cervical dilation]] is greater than 4 centimeters<ref name=wong/>
*[[Chorioamnionitis]] or intrauterine infection is present<ref name=ACOG/><ref name=wong/>
*Mother has severe [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]],<ref name=wong/> [[eclampsia]]<ref name=wong/>/[[preeclampsia]],<ref name=ACOG/> active [[vaginal bleeding]],<ref name=wong/> [[placental abruption]],<ref name=ACOG/> a [[cardiac disease]],<ref name=wong/> or another condition which indicates that the pregnancy should not continue.<ref name=wong/>
