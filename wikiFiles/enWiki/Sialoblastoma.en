A '''sialoblastoma''' is a low-grade [[salivary gland]] [[neoplasm]] that recapitulates primitive salivary gland [[Primordium|anlage]]. It has previously been referred to as ''congenital basal cell adenoma'', ''embryoma'', or ''basaloid adenocarcinoma''.
It is an extremely rare tumor, with less than 100 cases reported worldwide.<ref name="Som">{{cite journal

==Signs and symptoms==
The majority of the tumors are identified in the [[parotid]] salivary gland, although the [[submandibular gland]] can also be affected. The symptoms are non-specific, but include a mass, frequently rapidly expanding, or ulceration of the skin overlying the mass.<ref name="Brandwein">{{cite journal

== Pathology Findings ==
[[File:Salivary Sialoblastoma H & E Histology LDRT.tif|thumb|A hematoxylin and eosin stained image (intermediate power) of a sialoblastoma.]]
The tumors are multinodular or lobular, sometimes showing areas of [[necrosis]] or [[hemorrhage]]. They range in size from 2–7 cm. 
As would be expected, the histologic features under the microscope are similar to what would be seen in [[embryologic development]] at about the third month. There are two major patterns. 
* Favorable pattern:  partially encapsulated with bland basaloid cells and intervening stroma. 
* Unfavorable pattern:  Infiltrating borders with perineural or perivascular invasion. 
Both patterns have basaloid cells arranged in solid nests, nodules or trabecula, with focal peripheral palisading. The nuclei are round to oval with delicate [[chromatin]] and a usually single [[nucleolus]]. [[Ductule]]s can sometimes be seen. The background [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] is loose, immature and sometimes myxoid. [[Necrosis]] can be present. [[Mitoses|Mitotic figures]] are often easy to find.<ref name="Brandwein"/><ref name="Williams"/><ref name="Herrmann">{{cite journal

Tumor cells can be tested by [[immunohistochemistry]] which shows:
Ductal cells: positive with keratins, [[CK7]] and CK19.
Basaloid or myoepithelial cells: positive with [[S100 protein]], [[Actin|muscle specific actin]], [[calponin]] and [[TP73L|p63]].<ref name="Dehner"/><ref name="Williams"/><ref name="Brandwein"/>
The proliferation marker, [[Ki-67 (protein)|Ki-67]], may show increased labelling, and when it does, it is associated with an unfavorable outcome.<ref name=Patil2010>{{cite pmid|20001735|noedit}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
It is important that other tumors such as [[pleomorphic adenoma]], basal cell adenoma, [[adenoid cystic carcinoma]], and [[teratoma]] be excluded before treatment is started.<ref name=Dardick2010>{{cite pmid|19880331|noedit}}</ref><ref name="Herrmann"/><ref name=Seifert1997/>

== Management ==
Treatment includes complete surgical excision. If the tumor cannot be completely removed, then [[chemotherapy]] can be considered. However, chemotherapy may have long term adverse outcomes for patients who are usually very young.<ref name=Mertens2009>{{cite pmid|19167616|noedit}}</ref><ref name=Scott2008>{{cite pmid|16514617|noedit}}</ref><ref name=Mostafapour2000>{{cite pmid|10906522|noedit}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
Most patients are younger than two years, with the majority presenting during the neonatal period. Boys are affected slightly more often than girls (1.2:1).<ref name="Williams">{{cite journal
