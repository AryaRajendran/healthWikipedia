It is normally produced during fetal development, but the production of CEA stops before birth. Therefore, it is not usually present in the blood of healthy adults, although levels are raised in heavy [[smoker]]s. CEA is a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-cell surface anchored glycoprotein whose specialized sialofucosylated glycoforms serve as functional [[colon carcinoma]] [[L-selectin]] and [[E-selectin]] ligands, which may be critical to the metastatic dissemination of [[colon carcinoma]] cells.<ref name="pmid18375392">{{cite journal | author = Thomas SN, Zhu F, Schnaar RL, Alves CS, Konstantopoulos K| title = Carcinoembryonic antigen and CD44 variant isoforms cooperate to mediate colon carcinoma cell adhesion to E- and L-selectin in shear flow| journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 283 | issue = 23 | pages = 15647–55| year = 2008 | month = Jun | pmid = 18375392 | pmc =  2414264| doi = 10.1074/jbc.M800543200| url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid19413512">{{cite journal | author = Konstantopoulos K, Thomas SN| title = Cancer cells in transit: the vascular interactions of tumor cells| journal = Annu Rev Biomed Eng | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 177–202 | year = 2009 | month = | pmid = 19413512 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1146/annurev-bioeng-061008-124949| url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid19581728">{{cite journal | author = Thomas SN, Tong Z, Stebe KJ, Konstantopoulos K| title = Identification, characterization and utilization of tumor cell selectin ligands in the design of colon cancer diagnostics| journal = Biorheology| volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 207–25 | year = 2009 | month = | pmid = 19581728 | pmc =  | doi = 10.3233/BIR-2009-0534| url = | issn = }}</ref>

==History==
CEA was first identified in 1965 by [[Phil Gold]] and [[Samuel O. Freedman]] in human [[colon cancer]] tissue extracts.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14270243 | volume=121 | journal = The Journal of experimental medicine | year=1965 | title = DEMONSTRATION OF TUMOR-SPECIFIC ANTIGENS IN HUMAN COLONIC CARCINOMATA BY IMMUNOLOGICAL TOLERANCE AND ABSORPTION TECHNIQUES. | month=March | pages=439–62 | author=Gold P, Freedman SO | pmc = 2137957}}</ref>

==Diagnostic significance==
It was found that [[blood plasma|serum]] from individuals with [[colorectal carcinoma]],<ref name="urlCancer Diagnosis - Information About Cancer - Stanford Cancer Center">{{cite web |url=http://cancer.stanford.edu/information/cancerDiagnosis/ |title=Cancer Diagnosis - Information About Cancer - Stanford Cancer Center |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref> [[gastric carcinoma]], [[pancreatic carcinoma]], [[lung carcinoma]] and [[breast carcinoma]], as well as individuals with [[medullary thyroid carcinoma]], had higher levels of CEA than healthy individuals (above 2.5&nbsp;ng/ml). 

CEA elevation is known to be affected by multiple factors.  It varies inversely with tumor grade (well-differentiated tumors secrete more CEA).  CEA is elevated more in tumors with lymph node and distant metastasis than in organ-confined tumors (varies directly with tumor stage).  Left-sided tumors tend to have higher CEA levels than right-sided tumors.  Tumors causing obstruction produce higher CEA levels.  Aneuploid tumors produce more CEA than diploid tumors.  Liver dysfunction increases CEA levels as the liver is the primary site of CEA metabolism.  

CEA levels are higher for smokers than for nonsmokers.  Other nonneoplastic causes of elevated CEA include inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, biliary disease, liver dysfunction (as stated above) and hypothyroidism.  <ref> De Mais, Daniel.

Regions of high CEA levels in the body can be detected with the [[monoclonal antibody]] [[arcitumomab]].{{clarify|date=September 2012}}

CEA measurement is mainly used{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} as a [[tumor marker]] to identify recurrences after surgical resection, or localize cancer spread through dosage of biological fluids. The CEA blood test is not reliable for diagnosing cancer or as a screening test for early detection of cancer.<ref>{{Cite pmid|12651195}}</ref> Most types of cancer do not produce a high CEA. Elevated CEA levels should return to normal after successful surgical resection, or within 6 weeks of starting treatment if cancer treatment is successful.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} 

CEA levels may also be raised in some non-neoplastic conditions like [[ulcerative colitis]], [[pancreatitis]], [[cirrhosis]],<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Maestranzi | first1 = S. | last2 = Przemioslo | first2 = R. | last3 = Mitchell | first3 = H. | last4 = Sherwood | first4 = RA. | title = The effect of benign and malignant liver disease on the tumour markers CA19-9 and CEA. | journal = Ann Clin Biochem | volume = 35 ( Pt 1) | issue =  | pages = 99–103 | month = Jan | year = 1998 | doi =  | PMID = 9463746 }}</ref> [[COPD]], [[Crohn's disease]] as well as in [[Tobacco_smoking#Psychology|smokers]].  {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} 

Antibodies to CEA are also commonly used in [[immunohistochemistry]] to identify cells expressing the glycoprotein in tissue samples. In adults, CEA is expressed only in cancer cells, especially [[adenocarcinoma]]s, such as those arising in the colon, lung, breast, stomach, or pancreas. It can therefore be used to distinguish between these and other similar cancers. For example, it can help to distinguish between adenocarcinoma of the lung and [[mesothelioma]], a different type of lung cancer which is not normally CEA positive. Because even [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal]] antibodies to CEA tend to have some degree of cross-reactivity, occasionally giving [[false positive]] results, it is commonly employed in combination with other immunohistochemistry tests, such as those for [[BerEp4]], [[WT1]], and [[calretinin]].<ref name=Leong>{{cite book|author=Leong, Anthony S-Y|author2=Cooper, Kumarason|author3=Leong, F Joel W-M|year=2003|title=Manual of Diagnostic Cytology|edition=2|publisher=Greenwich Medical Media, Ltd.|pages=51–52|isbn=1-84110-100-1}}</ref>

==Genetics==
CEA and related [[genes]] make up the CEA family belonging to the [[immunoglobulin]] superfamily. In humans, the carcinoembryonic antigen family consists of 29 genes, 18 of which are normally expressed.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10202129 | doi=10.1006/scbi.1998.0119 | volume=9 | issue=2 | journal = Seminars in Cancer Biology | year=1999 | title = The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family: structures, suggested functions and expression in normal and malignant tissues*1 | month=April | pages=67–81 | author=Hammarström S}}</ref>
