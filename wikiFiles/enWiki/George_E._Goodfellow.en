Dr. '''George Emory Goodfellow''' (December&nbsp;23,&nbsp;1855 – December&nbsp;7,&nbsp;1910) was a physician and naturalist in the American [[American frontier|Old West]] with a reputation as the United States' foremost expert in treating bullet wounds. As a physician in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, he treated many [[Ballistic trauma|gunshot wound]]s to both lawmen and outlaws.  He performed the first recorded [[laparotomy]] for treating an abdominal gunshot wound and was the first surgeon to perform a [[perineum|perineal]] [[prostatectomy]] to remove an enlarged [[prostate]]. He pioneered the use of spinal anesthesia and sterile techniques in treating gunshot wounds and is regarded as the first civilian trauma surgeon. 

Goodfellow was a pugnacious, "brilliant and versatile"<ref>{{cite book|last=Hinsley|first=Curtis M.|title=The Lost Itinerary of Frank Hamilton Cushing|year=2002|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=978-0816522699|page=324|coauthors=Wilcox, David R.}}</ref> physician with wide-ranging interests. During his life he not only practiced medicine, he studied earthquakes and published the first surface rupture map of an earthquake in North America, interviewed [[Geronimo]], conducted research into the venom of [[Gila monsters]], and played a role in brokering a peace settlement in the [[Spanish–American War]].<ref name=ahsl/>  He was also a skilled boxer and in his first year at the United States Naval Academy he became the Academy boxing champion, but was dismissed for kicking and beating the first African-American to attend the institution. In 1889, he got into a fight with another man and stabbed him, but was found to have acted in self-defense. 

Goodfellow treated [[Virgil Earp]] and [[Morgan Earp]] after they were wounded in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]. His testimony later helped absolve the Earps and [[Doc Holliday]] of murder charges and to prove that they acted within their capacity as lawmen when they shot and killed three outlaw Cowboys. He treated Virgil again when he was maimed in an ambush and rushed to Morgan's side when he was mortally wounded by an assassin.

Goodfellow's father, Milton J. Goodfellow, came to California in 1853 to mine for gold. His mother, Amanda Baskin Goodfellow, followed two years later via boat, mule over the Panama Isthmus, and then on the [[steamship]] ''S.S. Golden Gate'' to San Francisco.<ref name=prescott/> Goodfellow was born on December 23, 1855 in [[Downieville, California]], then one of the largest cities in the state.<ref name=cochise100/> His parents also had two daughters, Kitty and Bessie.<ref name=rootsweb/> His father became a mining engineer and maintained an interest in medicine.<ref name=cochise100/> Goodfellow grew up around [[California Gold Rush]] mining camps and developed a deep interest in both mining and medicine.<ref name=cochise100/> When he was 12, his parents sent him across the country to a private school in Pennsylvania.<ref name=oldwest>{{cite web|title=Dr. George Goodfellow|url=http://societyoftheoldwest.ning.com/forum/topics/dr-george-goodfellow|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref> He returned to California two years later where he attended the California Military Academy in Oakland.

In 1870 he was living with his family in Treasure City, Nevada, where his father was a mining superintendent.<ref name=rootsweb/>

=== Dismissed from Naval Academy ===

Goodfellow declined a [[United States Military Academy#Admission|Congressional appointment]] to West Point and instead accepted an appointment from Nevada congressional representative C. W. Kendall to the [[United States Naval Academy]], arriving there in June 1872.<ref name=prescott/> Goodfellow became the boxing champion at the Academy<ref name=wwg>{{cite web|last=Trimble|first=Marshall|title=The Horse & Buggy Doctors of Territorial Days|url=http://www.wildwestgazette.com/trimbledoctors.htm|publisher=Wild West Gazette|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> and was well accepted by his fellow [[Midshipman|midshipmen]]. Like many of his fellow cadets, he took exception to the presence of the Academy's first black cadet, [[John H. Conyers]]. While marching, Goodfellow and another Cadet began kicking and punching Conyers, who had been shunned and constantly and brutally harassed since his arrival. News of the incident and the constant hazing experienced by Conyers leaked to the newspapers, and a three-man board was convened to investigate the attacks. Goodfellow denied any wrongdoing and Conyers claimed he could not identify any of his attackers. The board nonetheless concluded that "His persecutors are left then without any excuse or palliation except the inadmissible one of prejudice." The review board believed the Academy needed to give Croyden a fair chance at succeeding on his own merits, and recommended that strong measures should be taken. In the end Goodfellow and two others were dismissed from the Academy.<ref name=schneller/>

Goodfellow immediately set about trying to get reinstated. His mother Amanda wrote a personal letter to first lady Julia Grant, who was known to consider blacks as inferior and whose family had owned slaves before the Civil War. Amanda closed her letter by reminding the First Lady of their mutual friends.<ref name=cochise100/><ref name=oldwest/><ref name=schneller>{{cite book|last=Schneller|first=Robert J.|title=Breaking the Color Barrier: the U.S. Naval Academy's First Black Midshipmen And The Struggle for Racial Equality|year=2005|publisher=New York Univ.

Baskin interceded with his friend President [[Ulysses S. Grant|U.S. Grant]], who promised to reinstate Goodfellow, but the uncle left his office and Grant was busy seeking reelection.<ref name=prescott/><ref name=rasmussen/> None of the efforts for reinstatement proved fruitful.

=== Medical education===

Concerned about disappointing his father, Goodfellow sought out his cousin, Dr. T. H. Lashells, in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]], and read for medicine. He found he had a ready aptitude for the medical field and moved to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where an uncle lived.<ref name=oldwest/> He attended [[College of Wooster|Wooster University Medical School]]<ref name=rasmussen/><ref name=nellis>{{cite web |url=http://www.tucsonhouses4you.com/PageManager/Default.aspx/PageID=1095978&NF=1 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061122221650/http://www.tucsonhouses4you.com/PageManager/Default.aspx/PageID=1095978&NF=1 |archivedate=2006-11-22 |title=Doctor George Emory Goodfellow |accessdate=March 5, 2013 |first=Julie |last= Nellis}}</ref> and on February 23, 1876,<ref name=allen/> he graduated with honors.<ref name=oldwest/>

==Family ==

On November 4, 1876, Goodfellow married Katherine ("Kate") Colt, daughter of Henry Tracy Colt, the proprietor of Meadville's Colt House,<ref name=i899>{{cite web | url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=sffamilies&id=I899 |title=San Francisco Families |accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> who he had met while reading medicine in Meadville.<ref name=allen/> Ironically, she was a cousin to [[Samuel Colt]], inventor of the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt revolver]], a weapon that would later play a significant role in Goodfellow's medical practice.<ref name=allen/> The Goodfellows left Meadville immediately after they were married during the week of Nov. 9, 1876,<ref name=rootsweb>{{cite web |url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=95969&id=I725 |title=George Emory Goodfellow |accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref> and traveled to [[Oakland, California]]. 

The Goodfellows had a daughter, Edith,<ref name=azhistbio/> born on October 22, 1879 in [[Oakland, California]]. They also had a son, George Milton, born in May 1882 in Tombstone, who died from "general bleeding" on July 18.<ref name=rootsweb/><ref>{{cite book |title=The Tombstone years, 1879-1887 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=3voRAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=19 March 2013 |publisher= Cochise Classics |edition=Volume II |year=1997 |isbn=978-0965804721}}</ref> Kate Goodfellow died on August 16, 1891, at her mother-in-law's home in Oakland. Goodfellow and his daughter Edith caught the train to Oakland from [[Benson, Arizona]], and when his wife passed away, he and Edith returned to Tombstone before he relocated to Tucson and took over the practice of his deceased friend, Dr. John Handy. Goodfellow remarried Mary Elizabeth sometime before March 1906.<ref name=rootsweb/>

== Early career ==

Goodfellow briefly opened a medical practice in Oakland. Goodfellow was soon invited by his father Milton to join him in [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]], [[Arizona Territory]], where he was a mining executive for Peck, Mine and Mill.<ref name=cochise100>{{cite web |url= http://www.cochise100.org/wp-content/PDF/CENTENNIAL_BOOK.pdf  |title=Come Face to Face With History |pages=8–9 | publisher=Cochise County |work= |chapter=Dr. George Emory Goodfellow |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref> Goodfellow worked as the company physician for the next two years until he joined the U.S. Army as acting assistant surgeon at [[Fort Whipple, Arizona|Ft. Whipple]] in Prescott.<ref name=azhistbio/> In 1879 he became for a brief period the contract surgeon at [[Fort Lowell|Ft. Lowell]] near Tucson.<ref name=allen/>

== Medical practice in Tombstone ==
[[Image:Dr. George E. Goodfellow.png|thumb|George E. Goodfellow practiced in Tombstone, Arizona for 11 years.]]

[[Image:T-Crystal Palace1.jpg|| thumb|The Crystal Palace Hotel in 2012.]]

In November&nbsp;1880 Goodfellow decided to open his own medical practice. He canceled his Army contract and he and his wife relocated to the silver boom town of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory]].<ref name=oldwest/> There were already 12 doctors in the town of 2,000 residents, but only he and three others had medical school diplomas.<ref name=rasmussen/>

The town was less than a year old and its population had exploded from about 100 residents in March 1879 when it consisted mostly of wooden shacks and tents. By the fall of 1879 more than a thousand hardy miners and merchants lived in a canvas and matchstick camp built on top of the richest silver strike in the United States.<ref name=nhlsnom>{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/66000171.pdf|publisher=United States Department of the Interior National Park Service|accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref> On September 9,&nbsp;1880, the richly appointed Grand Hotel was opened, adorned with fine oil paintings, thick Brussels carpets, toilet stands, elegant chandeliers, silk-covered furniture, walnut furniture, and a kitchen with hot and cold running water.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tombstone History - The Grand Hotel|url=http://www.bignosekates.info/history1.html|accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref>

At age 25, Goodfellow opened an office on the second floor of the Crystal Palace Saloon,<ref name=aker/> one of the most luxurious saloons in the West.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tombstone, Arizona|url=http://www.westernmininghistory.com/towns/arizona/tombstone/|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> It was also the location of offices for other notable officials including County Coroner Dr. H. M. Mathews, Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]], attorney George W. Berry,<ref>{{cite web|title=Origins|url=http://www.crystalpalacesaloon.com/history/|publisher=Crystal Palace Saloon|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> Cochise County Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]], and Justice of the Peace [[Wells Spicer]].<ref name=jcs/> When he wasn't busy tending to patients, he walked down the outside stairs to the saloon below, where he spent many hours drinking, playing [[Faro (card game)|Faro]],  and betting on horse races, foot races, wrestling and boxing matches.<ref name=aker/> He got along well with the hardscrabble miners, the elite of Tombstone, and characters like the notoriously drunk lawyer Allen English.<ref name=prescott/>

Goodfellow lost his office when the saloon and most of downtown Tombstone burned to the ground during a large fire on May 26,&nbsp;1882. The building was quickly rebuilt and the Crystal Palace earned a reputation for its gambling, entertainment, food and the best brands of wines, liquors, and cigars available 24 hours a day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origins|url=http://www.crystalpalacesaloon.com/history/fire.html|publisher=Crystal Palace Saloon|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

Tombstone was a dangerous frontier town at the time and the scene of considerable conflict. Most of the leading cattlemen and the numerous [[outlaw]] [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] were [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] from Southern states, especially Missouri and Texas.<ref name="bishop">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vk10VwFJVYgC|last=Bishop |first=William Henry |title=Mexico, California and Arizona |year=1888, 1900 |publisher=Harper and Brothers |location=New York and London |page=468 |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.org/details/mexico.californi00bishrich |archivedate=2007}}</ref> The mine and [[Business|business owners]], miners, townspeople and city lawmen including brothers [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]], [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]], and [[Wyatt Earp]] were largely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Northern states]].

[[Cochise County]] [[Sheriff]] [[Johnny Behan]] favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers.<ref name="swansburg">{{cite web |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2004/review_swansburg_novdec04.msp| title=Wyatt Earp Takes the Stand | first=John |last=Swansburg |date=November/December 2004 |publisher=LegalAffairs.com}}</ref> He was opposed by the [[Earp family|Earps]] who held authority at different times on the federal, county and local level. Relationships and loyalty could and did change quickly. Cowboy [[Frank Stilwell]] was a known [[cattle raiding|cattle rustler]] and was briefly an assistant to Sheriff Behan. Cowboy and outlaw [[Texas Jack Vermillion]] was a friend of the Earps who Wyatt Earp deputized after [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] was maimed in an ambush by other Cowboys.

== Authority on gunshot wounds ==

On July 2, 1881, President [[James Garfield]] was shot by [[Charles J. Guiteau]]. One bullet was thought later to have possibly lodged near his liver but could not be found.<ref>Candace Millard, Destiny of the Republic.

On July 4, two days after the President was shot, a miner outside Tombstone was shot in the abdomen. Nine days later Goodfellow was able to treat the wound. On July 13, 1881 he performed the first [[laparotomy]] to treat a gunshot wound. The man had a perforated [[small intestine|small]] and [[large intestine]]. Goodfellow sutured six holes in the man's organs, wounds very similar to President Garfield's injury.<ref>{{cite book| title=Annual of the Universal Medical Sciences And Analytical Index 1888-1896 |publisher=The F.A.

Goodfellow traveled many hours to treat cowboys miles from Tombstone and performed surgery under primitive conditions.<ref name=wwg/> He once traveled to [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]], {{convert|30|mi}} from Tombstone, to treat an abdominal gunshot wound. He operated on the patient stretched out a billiard table. Goodfellow removed a .45-calibre bullet, washed out the cavity with hot water, folded the intestines back into position, stitched the wound closed with silk thread, and ordered the patient to take to a hard bed for recovery. He wrote about the operation: "I was entirely alone having no skilled assistant of any sort, therefore was compelled to depend for aid upon willing friends who were present—these consisting mostly of hard-handed miners just from their work on account of the fight. The anesthetic was administered by a barber, lamps held, hot water brought and other assistance rendered by others."<ref name=prescott/>

Goodfellow pioneered the use of sterile techniques in treating gunshot wounds,<ref name= cochise100/> washing the patient's wound and his hands with lye soap or whisky.<ref name=prescott>{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Edwards |title=George Goodfellow's Medical Treatment of Stomach Wounds Became Legendary |publisher=The Prescott Courier |date=May 2, 1980|pages=3–5 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&dat=19800502&id=jH8vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vkwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4536,249915}}</ref> He became America's leading authority on gunshot wounds<ref name=oldwest/> and was widely recognized for his skill as a surgeon.

During his career, he published 13 articles about abdominal bullet wounds based on treatments and techniques he developed while practicing medicine in Tombstone. His articles were laced with colorful commentary describing his medical practice in the primitive west, including a description of the bullet wounds he most often treated: "The .44 and .45 caliber [[Colt Manufacturing Company|Colt]] revolver, .45-60 and .44-40 [[Winchester rifle]]s and carbines were the toys with which our festive or obstreperous citizens delight themselves."<ref name=wwg/> The .45 caliber [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt Peacemaker]] round contained 40 grains of [[gunpowder|black powder]] that shot a thumb-sized, 250 [[grain (unit)|grain]] slug at the relatively slow velocity of 910 feet per second. But the large bullet could smash through a {{convert|3.75|in}} pine board at {{convert|50|yd|m}}.<ref name=crane/> The nearly half-inch lead slug used at the time did considerably more damage than modern steel-jacketed bullets.<ref name=packer/> Goodfellow was the first physician known to operate successfully on abdominal gunshot wounds.<ref name=rasmussen>{{cite web|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|title='Gunfighter's Surgeon' Became a Southwest Legend|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/27/local/me-then27|date=October 27, 2002|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>  W. W. Whitmore wrote in an October 9, 1932, article in the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' that Goodfellow "presumably had a greater practice in gunshot wounds of the abdomen than any other man in civil life in the country."<ref name=allen/>

=== Thesis on abdominal wounds ===

Goodfellow saw the effect of these large caliber weapons up close and was very familiar with their powerful impact. In an article "Cases of Gunshot Wound of the Abdomen Treated by Operation" in the ''Southern California Practitioner'' of 1889 he wrote, "the maxim is, shoot for the guts; knowing death is certain, yet sufficiently lingering and agonizing to afford a plenary sense of gratification to the victor in the contest."<ref name=prescott/> His article described five patients with penetrating abdominal wounds, four of whom survived, and the laparotomies he completed on all of them. He wrote, "it is inexcusable and criminal to neglect to operate upon a case of gunshot wound in the abdominal cavity."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rutkow|first=Ira M.|title=The History of Surgery in the United States: 1775-1900|year=1992|publisher=Jeremy Norman Co.|edition=First|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0930405489}}</ref>

He was well known for his colorful and informative writing describing how to treat abdominal gunshot wounds.<ref name=aker/> He wrote, "In the spring of 1881 I was a few feet distant from a couple of individuals <nowiki>[</nowiki>Luke Short and Charlie Storms<nowiki>]</nowiki> who were quarreling. They began shooting. The first shot took effect, as was afterward ascertained, in the left breast of one of them, who, after being shot, and while staggering back some 12 feet, cocked and fired his pistol twice, his second shot going into the air, for by that time he was on his back."<ref name=packer>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Cit-don%E2%80%99t-hurt-much-ma%E2%80%99am%E2%80%9C |first=James |last=Packer| title=It Don’t Hurt Much, Ma’am|publisher=American Heritage|accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref>

Goodfellow learned that the caliber of the bullet determined whether a medical procedure was needed. If the bullet was .32-caliber or larger, it "inflicted enough damage to necessitate immediate operation." He noted, "Given a gunshot wound of the abdominal cavity with one of the above caliber balls <nowiki>[</nowiki>.44 and .45<nowiki>]</nowiki>, if the cavity be not opened within an hour, the patient by reason of hemorrhage is beyond any chance of recovery.”<ref name=packer/>

=== Conceived of bulletproof fabrics ===

On February 25,&nbsp;1881, Faro dealer [[Luke Short]] and professional gambler and gunfighter [[Charlie Storms]] got into an argument. Storms had successfully defended himself several times with his pistol. He had inaccurately sized Short up as someone he could "slap in the face without expecting a return." [[Bat Masterson]] initially defused a confrontation between the two men, but Storms returned, yanked Short off the sidewalk, and pulled his cut-off Colt .45 pistol. Luke Short was quicker and stuck the muzzle of his own pistol against Charlie Storms' chest, shooting him twice before he hit the ground.<ref>{{cite book|last=Erwin|first=Richard E.|title=The Truth about Wyatt Earp|year=2000|publisher=iUniverse|location=San Jose, CA|isbn=978-0595001279}}</ref>  The first shot set fire to Storms' shirt.<ref name=drwin>{{cite book|last=Erwin|first=Richard E.|title=The Truth about Wyatt Earp|year=1993|publisher=O.K. Press|location=Carpinteria, CA|isbn=9780963393029|edition=2nd}}</ref>  Short's actions were ruled self-defense.

Examining Storms afterward, Goodfellow found that he had been shot in the heart, but was surprised to see "not a drop of blood" exiting the wound. He discovered that the bullet had ripped through the man's clothes and into a folded [[silk]] handkerchief in his breast pocket. He extracted the intact bullet from the wound with the silk wrapped around it.<ref name=prescott/> He found two thicknesses of silk wrapped around the bullet and two tears where it had struck the vertebral column.<ref name=oldwest/>

Another case that attracted his attention was an incident when Assistant City Marshal [[Billy Breakenridge]] shot Billy Grounds from {{convert|30|ft}} with a shotgun, killing him. Goodfellow examined Billy and found that two buckshot grains had penetrated Billy's thick Mexican felt hat band embroidered with silver wire. These two buckshot and two others penetrated his head and flattened against the posterior wall of the skull, and others penetrated the face and chest. He also noted that one of the grains had passed through two heavy wool shirts and a blanket-lined canvas coat and vest before coming to rest deep in his chest. But Goodfellow was fascinated to find in the folds of a Chinese silk handkerchief around Grounds' neck two shotgun pellets but no holes.<ref name=prescott/><ref name=oldwest/>

In a third instance, he described a man who was shot through the right side of the neck, narrowly missing his carotid artery. A portion of the silk neckerchief was carried into the wound by the bullet, preventing a more serious injury, but the scarf was undamaged.<ref name=oldwest/>  To Goodfellow, the protection offered by the silk was remarkable. He noted that the bullet that struck Storms would ordinarily have passed through the body. The second case of the buckshot best illustrated the protection afforded by silk.<ref name=oldwest/>

In 1887, Goodfellow documented these cases in an article titled "Notes on the Impenetrability of Silk to Bullets"<ref name=oldwest/><ref>{{cite journal|asin=B00AZQ1H24 |edition=reprint |title= Southern California Practitioner |editor=J.P.

=== Other medical firsts ===

Goodfellow was an innovative physician who was forced to experiment with differing methods than those utilized by physicians in more civilized eastern practices.<ref name=wwg/> He pioneered the idea of treating tuberculosis patients by exposing them to Arizona's dry climate. Goodfellow performed the first [[appendectomy]] in the [[Arizona Territory]]. During 1891 at St. Mary’s Hospital in Tucson, he performed what many consider to be the first<ref name=prescott/><ref name=wwg/><ref>{{cite web|title=George Goodfellow Investigates Earthquake|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/george-goodfellow-investigates-earthquake|publisher=History.com|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> [[perineum|perineal]] [[prostatectomy]], an operation he developed to treat bladder problems by removing the enlarged prostate. He traveled extensively across the United States for several years, training other physicians to perform the procedure. Among these was Dr. [[Hugh H. Young|Hugh Young]], a well-known and respected urology professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Goodfellow completed 78 operations and only two patients died, a remarkable level of success for the time period.<ref name=prescott/> He was among the first surgeons anywhere, let alone on the frontier of the United States, who used spinal [[anesthetic]], which he improvised by crushing [[cocaine]] crystals in spinal fluid and reinjecting the mixture into the patient's spine.<ref name=prescott/>

== Personal reputation ==

Along with being an extremely talented and innovative surgeon, Goodfellow developed a reputation as hard-drinking, irascible ladies-man.<ref name=crane>{{cite web|last=Crane|first=Michael A.|title=Dr. Goodfellow: Gunfighter's Surgeon|url=http://www.doc-holliday.com/article.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2013 |year=2003}}</ref> He was known to keep company with some of the [[prostitutes|courtesans]] who frequented the Crystal Palace saloon. Goodfellow was known to side with the business owners and miners,<ref name=prescott/> but that did not affect his medical practice in Tombstone during the eleven years his office was located there. He delivered babies, set miners' broken bones,<ref name=oldwest/> treated gunshot wounds to cowboys and lawmen alike, and provided medical care to anyone in need. Tombstone had a large number of silver mines during its peak production period, and Goodfellow entered smoke-filled mining shafts on more than one occasion to help treat trapped and injured miners.<ref name=wwg/>

During the Tombstone fire on June&nbsp;1881, George W. Parsons was helping to tear down a balcony to prevent the fire from spreading when he was struck by the falling wood.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Paula Mitchell|title=And Die in the West: The Story of O.K.

Goodfellow devised a wire framework and in a series of treatments successfully restored Parson's nose to his pre-injury profile.<ref name=allen/> He refused payment because Parsons had been hurt as he was assisting others.<ref name=wwg/>

Goodfellow was not a man to be taken lightly. In August, 1889, he got into a fight while drunk during which he stabbed Frank White with a triple-edged, {{convert|4|in}} [[Poignard]] dagger.<ref>{{cite news|title=Territorial Items|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024828/1889-08-17/ed-1/seq-2.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Mohave County Miner|date=August 17, 1889}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XhOgAAAAMAAJ&lpg=RA1-PA130 |title=The Medical Standard |volume=5-6}}</ref> White was seriously injured but Goodfellow was not arrested, as the judge ruled Goodfellow acted in self-defense.<ref name=crane/>

=== Interest in Gila Monsters ===

In addition to his medical practice and related studies, Goodfellow had other scientific interests. He published articles about rattlesnake and [[Gila monster]]  bites in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' and the ''Southern California Practitioner''.<ref name=allen/> He was among the first to research the actual effects of Gila monster venom when the lizard was widely feared for its deadly bit. The ''Scientific American'' reported in 1890 that "The breath is very fetid, and its odor can be detected at some little distance from the lizard. It is supposed that this is one way in which the monster catches the insects and small animals which form a part of its food supply—the foul gas overcoming them." Goodfellow offered to pay local residents $5.00 for Gila monster specimens. He bought several and collected more on his own. In 1891 he purposefully provoked one of his captive lizards into biting him on his finger. The bite made him ill and he spent the next five days in bed, but he completely recovered. When ''Scientific American'' ran another ill-founded report on the lizard's ability to kill people, he wrote in reply and described his own studies and personal experience. He wrote that he knew several people who had been bitten by Gila monsters but had not died from the bite.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lapidus|first=Richard|title=The Gila Monster Had a Killer Reputation|url=http://www.historynet.com/the-gila-monster-had-a-killer-reputation.htm|publisher=Wild West Magazine|accessdate=10 March 2013 |date= June 3, 2011}}</ref>

=== Community activities ===

While Goodfellow lived in Tombstone, he was a founder of the plush Tombstone Club located in the Grand Hotel. Members had access to about 70 periodicals that the club subscribed to. He also helped organize the Tombstone Scientific Society.<ref name=jcs>{{cite web|title=The Old West At Its Best - And Worst: Crystal Palace|url=http://www.jcs-group.com/oldwest/tombstone/best.html|publisher=JCS Group|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> He was active in other community affairs, and invested in the Huachuca Water Company, which in 1881 built a {{convert|23|mi}}-long pipeline from the Huachuca Mountains to Tombstone, along with a community swimming pool.<ref name=nhlsnom/>

=== Cowboy practice ===

Goodfellow treated a number of notorious [[outlaw]] [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|cowboys]] in [[Tombstone, Arizona]] during the 1880s.<ref name=wwg/> He treated [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]] on May 25,&nbsp;1881 when [[Lincoln County War]] veteran Jim Wallace insulted Brocius' friend and ally, Tombstone Deputy Marshal [[Billy Breakenridge]]. Brocius took offense and even though Wallace apologized, Brocius threatened to kill him. Although Wallace left, Curly Bill followed and Wallace shot him, wounding him in the cheek and neck.<ref name=eagle>{{cite web |title=William "Curly Bill" Brocius |url=http://www.eaglefreeenterprises.com/pictures/william_brocius.htm |accessdate=May 17, 2011}}</ref> Marshal Breakenridge arrested Wallace but the court ruled he acted in self-defense.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica/az-tombstonehistoricaltext3.html |title=Tombstone, Arizona – Historical Accounts |publisher=Legends of America |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |date=May 26, 1880}} Quoted from the May 26, 1881 edition of the ''Arizona Daily Citizen''.</ref> Goodfellow treated Brocious, who recovered after several weeks.

Goodfellow was noted for his wry humor. A gambler named McIntire was shot and killed during an argument over a card game. Goodfellow performed an autopsy on the man and wrote in his report that he had done "the necessary assessment work and found the body full of lead, but too badly punctured to hold whiskey."<ref name=rasmussen/><ref>{{cite web|title=This Week In The Old West - Tombstone fits Dr. Goodfellow's lifestyle|url=http://www.wmicentral.com/community_beat/local_entertainment/this-week-in-the-old-west---tombstone-fits/article_f45b1e7a-2cdf-11e1-b17a-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=11 March 2013 |date=December 23, 2011 }}</ref>

Goodfellow treated Virgil Earp again two months later on December&nbsp;28,&nbsp;1881 after he was ambushed. At about 11:30&nbsp;p.m. that night, three men hid in the upper story of an unfinished building across Allen Street from the Cosmopolitan Hotel where the Earps were staying for mutual support and protection.

The next victim of the feud between the Cowboys and the Earps was [[Morgan Earp]]. At 10:50&nbsp;p.m. on March&nbsp;18,&nbsp;1882, Morgan was playing a round of [[pool (game)|billiards]] at the Campbell & Hatch Billiard Parlor against owner Bob Hatch. Dan Tipton, Sherman McMaster, and Wyatt watched, having also received death threats that same day.<ref name=dodge>{{Cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Fred|last2=Lake|first2=Carolyn |title=Under Cover for Wells Fargo The Unvarnished Recollections of Fred Dodge|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, Oklahoma|isbn=978-0-8061-3106-1| page=336|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4n8-tmFvI7wC&pg=PA38|accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref>{{rp|38}}

An unknown assailant shot Morgan through a glass-windowed, locked door that opened onto a dark alley between Allen and Fremont Streets.  Morgan was struck in the right side of his abdomen and the bullet passed through his body<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jcs-group.com/oldwest/tombstone/morgan.html |title=Morgan Seth earp | accessdate=March 10, 2013 |first=Bill |last=O'Neal |work=Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters |location=Norman, Oklahoma |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=1979}}</ref> before lodging in the thigh of bystander George A. B. Berry. Morgan was mortally wounded and could not stand even with assistance. They laid him on a nearby lounge where he died within the hour. Drs. Matthews, Millar, and Goodfellow all examined Morgan. Even Goodfellow, recognized in the United States as the nation's leading expert at treating abdominal gunshot wounds, concluded that Morgan's wounds were fatal.<ref>{{cite book| title=Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters  |isbn=978-0-8061-2335-6 |first=Bill |last=O'Neal}}</ref>{{rp|97}}

As County Coroner, Goodfellow conducted Morgan Earp's autopsy.<ref name=azhistbio/> He found that the bullet, "entering the body just to the left of the spinal column in the region of the left kidney emerging on the right side of the body in the region of the gall bladder. It certainly injured the great vessels of the body causing hemorrhage which undoubtedly causes death. It also injured the spinal column.

== Coroner for John Heath ==
{{main|Bisbee Massacre}}

[[File:JohnHeith.jpg|thumb|upright|Tombstone citizens lynched John Heath (also spelled "Heith") on February 22,&nbsp;1884. As Coroner, Goodfellow ruled he died of "strangulation, self-inflicted or otherwise."]]

On the morning of December 8,&nbsp;1883, a group of outlaw  [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] named Daniel "Big Dan" Dowd, Comer W. "Red" Sample, Daniel "York" Kelly, William E. "Billy" Delaney, and James "Tex" Howard robbed the Goldwater & Castaneda Mercantile which was rumored to be holding the [[US$|$]]7,000 payroll for the [[Copper Queen Mine]].<ref name="legendsofamerica"/><ref name="genealogytrails"/> But the payroll had not yet arrived, and they decided to steal whatever they could take from the safe and the employees and customers. They stole between $900 and $3,000 along with a gold watch and jewelry. As two of the robbers left the store, the three men outside began shooting passersby, killing four people, including a pregnant woman and her unborn child. John Heath (sometimes spelled Heith) had been a [[cattle raiding|cattle rustler]] in Texas, but since arriving in Arizona he had served briefly as a [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] [[deputy sheriff]] and had also opened a saloon. When the five bandits were caught, they quickly implicated Heath as the man who had planned the hold-up.<ref name="legendsofamerica">{{cite web|title=John Heath and the Bisbee Massacre|work=|url=http://www.legendsofamerica/we-johnheath.html|date=|year=|accessdate =June 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name="genealogytrails">{{cite web|title=Arizona Trails: Cochise County, Arizona: The Bisbee Massacre|work=|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ariz/cochise/Bisbee-massacre.htm|date=|year=|accessdate =June 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=R.

Heath was convicted of [[second-degree murder]] and conspiracy to commit robbery, and the judge reluctantly could only sentence him to a [[life imprisonment|life term]] at the [[Yuma Territorial Prison]]. The citizens of Tombstone were outraged and broke into the jail, forcibly removing Heath and stringing him up from a nearby a [[telegraph]] pole. Heath's last words were: "''I have faced death too many times to be disturbed when it actually comes. ... Don{{'}}t mutilate my body or shoot me full of holes!''"  Goodfellow, who had been present at Heath's hanging, was County Coroner and responsible for determining the exact cause of death. His wry conclusion reflected the popular sentiment of the town. He ruled that Heath died from “...emphysema of the lungs which might have been, and probably was, caused by strangulation, self-inflicted or otherwise, as in accordance with the medical evidence.”<ref name=aker>{{cite web | url=http://arizonaoddities.com/2009/10/doc-goodfellow-arizonas-gutsiest-physician-from-the-territorial-days/#sthash.IEkaqdrW.dpuf |title= Doc Goodfellow: Arizona’s Gutsiest Physician from the Territorial Days |date=October 19, 2009 |first=Andrea |last=Aker |accessdate=March 4, 2013}}</ref>

== Later life ==

In 1884, his father was a mining engineer in nearby Fairbank, Arizona, on the railroad line from Tucson to Nogales. His father died in 1887 in San Diego.

In 1886, Goodfellow reportedly rode with the U.S. Army who were attempting to recapture [[Geronimo]]<ref name=aker/> after he left the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos Reservation]] against Army orders. During his escape, he and his warriors killed "fourteen Americans dead in the United States and between 500 and 600 Mexicans dead south of the border." After Geronimo was apprehended, Goodfellow, who spoke fluent Spanish and some Apache,<ref name=allen/> befriended Geronimo.<ref name=nellis/>

Tombstone was by 1890 on the decline.

Shafter relied on Goodfellow’s excellent knowledge of Spanish to help negotiate the final surrender after the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]].

=== Practice in San Francisco ===

In late 1899 he moved to San Francisco and established his practice at 771 Sutter St. and became the surgeon for the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Sante Fe Railroad]].<ref name=satnet1/> He was an active member of the [[Bohemian Club]] and attended their summer camp on the Russian River regularly.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Insider|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1909-07-22/ed-1/seq-6.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Call|date=July 22, 1909}}</ref> On February 15, 1900, Wells Fargo Express Agent [[Jeff Milton]], a friend of Goodfellow, arrived on board a train in Fairbank, near Benson, Arizona. Former lawman-turned-outlaw [[Burt Alvord]] and five other robbers attempted to rob an arriving train of its cash. Milton was seriously wounded in the  left arm and the railroad dispatched a special engine and boxcar to transport Milton from Benson to Tucson for treatment. In Tucson, Dr. H. W. Fenner tied the shattered bone together with piano wire. When the wound wouldn't heal, he sent Milton to San Francisco where he could be seen by experts at the Southern Pacific Hospital there. They wanted to amputate his arm at the elbow, but he refused and got a ride to Dr. Goodfellow's office.<ref name=satnet1>{{cite journal|title=The Southern Arizona Trauma Alert|url=http://www.satnet1.org/images/03_2006_Newsletter.pdf |volume=4 |date=March 2, 2006 |publisher=University Medical Center |location=Tucson, Arizona}}</ref> Goodfellow cleaned and treated Milton's wound but told him he would never gain use of the arm again.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Bob Boze|title=One Man With Courage Makes A Majority|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/history/history/classic-gunfights/4891-jeff-milton-vs-the-burt-alvord-gan|publisher=True West Magazine|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> Milton's left arm healed but was of little use and noticeably shorter than his right arm.

In April 1906, at the time of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], Goodfellow had remarried and was living at the [[St. Francis Hotel]]. He lost all of his records and personal manuscripts in the hotel and his office to the earthquake and subsequent fire.<ref name=rootsweb/> His finances were ruined and Goodfellow returned to the Southern Pacific Railroad where he was Chief Surgeon in [[Guaymas]], Mexico from 1907 to 1910.<ref name=azhistbio/>

== Death ==

Goodfellow fell ill in the summer of 1910 with an illness which he had reportedly been exposed to during the Spanish-American War. He sought treatment from his sister Mary's husband, Dr. Charles W. Fish, in Los Angeles. Over the next six months his health gradually declined, and soon he could no longer practice medicine.<ref name=nellis/> He was hospitalized for several weeks at the end of 1910 at Angelus Hospital in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dr. G.
