'''Gluteoplasty''' (Gr. ''gloutόs'', '''rump''' + ''plassein'', '''to shape''') denotes the [[plastic surgery ]] and the liposculpture procedures for the correction of the [[Congenital defect|congenital]], [[Trauma (medicine)|traumatic]], and acquired defects and deformities of the buttocks and the gluteal region anatomy; and for the aesthetic enhancement (by augmentation or by reduction) of the contour of the [[buttocks]]. The corrective procedures for buttock augmentation and repair include the [[Surgery|surgical]] emplacement of a '''gluteal implant''' (buttock prosthesis); '''liposculpture''' ([[fat transfer]] and [[liposuction]]); and '''body contouring''' (surgery and liposculpture) to resolve the particular defect or deformity of the gluteal region. Moreover, in the praxis of [[Sexual reassignment surgery male-to-female|sexual reassignment surgery]], the prosthetic and liposclupture augmentation of the buttocks can be performed on [[Transsexualism|transsexual]] and [[transgender]] women to enhance the anatomic curvature of the gluteal region in order to establish the markedly feminine buttocks and hips that project more (to the rear and to the side) than do masculine hips.

== Background ==
The functional purpose of the '''buttocks musculature''' is to establish a stable [[gait]] so that the man or woman possesses a balanced manner of walking; therefore, the restoration of anatomic functionality is the therapeutic consideration that determines which '''gluteoplasty''' procedure will effectively correct the damaged muscles of the buttocks. The applicable techniques for [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] and [[Fat transfer|fat-transfer]] correction include the surgical emplacement of [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] gluteal implants; [[Flap (surgery)|autologous tissue-flaps]]; the cutting and removal of damaged tissue (excision); lipoinjection augmentation; and [[liposuction]] reduction — to resolve the defect or deformity caused by a traumatic injury ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]) to the buttocks muscles ([[gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]], [[gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]], [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]), and any deformation of the anatomic contour of the buttocks. Likewise, the corrective techniques apply to resolving the sagging skin of the body, and the muscle and bone deformities presented by the formerly [[Obesity|obese]] patient, after a massive weight loss (MWL) [[bariatric surgery]] procedure; and for resolving [[congenital defects]] and [[congenital deformity|congenital deformities]] of the gluteal region.<ref>Reisman N, Madjidi A, Caputy G, Talavera Fco., Matarasso A, Slenkovich N.

== Surgical anatomy of the buttocks ==
;Muscular origins and insertions
[[Image:Gluteus_maximus_muscle.PNG|thumb|right|185px|'''Gluteoplasty:''' The surgical anatomy of the gluteus maximus muscle, as considered for a buttock-lift surgery.]]
Anatomically, the mass of each [[buttocks|buttock]] principally comprises two (2) muscles — the [[gluteus maximus muscle]] and the [[gluteus medius muscle]] — which are covered by a layer of [[adipose tissue|adipose body fat]]. The upper aspects of the buttocks end at the [[iliac crest]] (the upper edges of the wings of the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], and the upper lateral margins of the [[greater pelvis]]), and the lower aspects of the buttocks end at the [[Gluteal sulcus|horizontal gluteal crease]], where the buttocks anatomy joins the rear, upper portion of the thighs. The gluteus maximus muscle has two (2) points of insertion: (i) the one-third (1/3) superior portion of the (coarse line) [[linea aspera]] of the thigh bone ([[femur]]), and (ii) the superior portion of the [[iliotibial tract]] (a long, fibrous reinforcement of the deep [[fascia lata]] of the thigh). The left and the right gluteus maximus muscles (the butt cheeks) are vertically divided by the [[intergluteal cleft]] (the butt-crack) which contains the [[Human anus|anus]].<ref>Reisman N, Madjidi A, Caputy G, Talavera Fco., Matarasso A, Slenkovich N. Buttocks Contouring. (21 march 2011) emedicine.com</ref>

[[Image:Posterior_Hip_Muscles_3.PNG|thumb|left|170px|'''Gluteoplasty:''' the relative anatomic locations of the buttocks muscles, considered for buttocks augmentation.]]
The [[gluteus maximus muscle]] is a large and very thick muscle (6–7 cm) located on the [[sacrum]], which is the large, triangular bone located at the base of the [[vertebral column]], and at the upper- and back-part of the [[pelvic cavity]], where it is inserted (like a wedge) between the two [[hip bone]]s. The upper part of the sacrum is connected to the final [[lumbar vertebrae|lumbar vertebra]] (L5), and to the bottom of the [[coccyx]] (tailbone). At its origin, the gluteus maximus muscle extends to include parts of the [[ilium (bone)|iliac bone]], the sacrum, the coccyx, the [[sacrosciatic ligament]], and the [[tuberosity of the ischium]]. Like every pelvic-area muscle, the gluteus maximus muscle originates from the pelvis; nonetheless, it is the sole pelvic muscle not inserted to the [[Human trochanter|trochanter]] (head of the femur), and is approximately aligned to the [[femur]] and the [[fascia lata]] (the [[deep fascia]] of the thigh); its tissues cover only the rear lateral face of the [[Human trochanter|trochanter]], and there form a bursa (purse) that faces the interior of the [[thigh]].<ref name="Gluteoplasty">González R. Augmentation Gluteoplasty: the XYZ Method. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. 2004;28:417–425.</ref>

;Innervation
The motor innervation of the gluteus maximus muscle is performed by the [[inferior gluteal nerve]] (a branch nerve of the [[sacral plexus]]) and extends from the pelvis to the gluteal region, then  traverses the [[greater sciatic foramen]] (opening) from behind and to the middle to then join the [[sciatic nerve]]. The inferior gluteal nerve divides into three (3) collateral branches: (i) the '''gluteus branch''', (ii) the '''perineal branch''', and (iii) the '''femoral branch'''. The first ramification — the gluteus branch — is a branch nerve that is very close to the emergence of the inferior gluteal nerve to the area, next to the inferior border of the [[pyramidalis muscle]].<ref>Reid RW. Motor Points in Relation the Surface of the Body. Journal of Anatomy. 1920 Volume 54;271–275.</ref> As it arises, the inferior gluteal nerve then divides into four (4) or more '''ﬁllets''' (bands of nerve fibres) that travel (in a crow’s-foot configuration) between the gluteus maximus muscle and its (front) anterior fascia; the thickest nerve-bands are the superior-most and the inferior-most ﬁllets. The superior-most ﬁllet runs almost vertically, near the sacrum, and innervates the superior portion of the gluteus muscle; the inferior-most fillet, which has the greatest calibre, travels very close and parallel to the [[sacrotuberous ligament]]; the inferior-most fillet provides fine-gauge branch-nerve ramifications that innervate the gluteus muscle through its anterior (front) face.

* In surgical and body contouring praxis, the plastic surgeon creates the '''implant-pocket''' — either for the gluteal prosthesis or for the [[Fat transfer|injections of autologous fat]] — by undermining the gluteus maximus muscle with a dissection technique that avoids the [[sacrum]], the [[sacrotuberous ligament]], and the [[tuberosity of the ischium]]; which, if accidentally cut, might isolate the posterior (back) portion of the muscle and lead to denervation, the loss of nerve function and of innervation.<ref name="Gluteoplasty"/>

;Vascularization
The [[superior gluteal artery]], the [[inferior gluteal artery]], the [[superior gluteal veins]], and the [[inferior gluteal veins]] irrigate the gluteus maximus muscle with [[arterial blood|arterial]] and [[venous blood|venous]] blood. The vascularization, the entrance of the blood vessels to the muscle tissues, occurs at the anterior (front) face of the muscle, very close to the [[sacrum]]. As the arteries and the veins enter the mass of the gluteal muscle, they divide into narrower blood-vessel ramifications (configured like the horizontal branches of a tree), most of which travel parallel to the muscle fibres.

* In surgical and body contouring praxis, the plastic surgeon effects the implant-pocket undermining of the gluteus maximus muscle by carefully separating the muscle fibres to avoid severing the pertinent blood vessels, which would interfere with the blood irrigation of the muscle tissue. Therefore, to create an implant-pocket, either for a gluteal prosthesis or for [[Fat transfer|lipoinjection]], a low-angle muscle-dissection is performed in order to avoid the risk of severing any major branch — [[Superior gluteal artery|superior]] or [[Inferior gluteal artery|inferior]] — of the gluteal artery, which travels very close to the [[sacrum]] and to the [[sacrotuberous ligament]].<ref name="Gluteoplasty"/>

== Surgical procedures ==
; Medical therapy
The resolution of the defects and deformities of the muscles of the gluteal region (the buttocks and the thighs) of the human body cannot be realized with medical therapy; thus, for example, a treatment with cellulite-diminishing cream is ineffective for correcting the corresponding physical faults respectively presented by the man and by the woman patient.

; Surgical therapy
The resolution of the defects and deformities of the '''gluteal region''' can be realized surgically; yet, the assessment of the degree of severity of the injury organizes treatment therapies into three types: (i) buttocks augmentation,  (ii) buttocks reduction, and (ii) contour irregularity treatments that combine surgery and liposculpture (fat-removal and fat-injection).<ref name="Reisman">Reisman NL, Azita M. Buttocks Contouring Treatment & Management (23 Augustust 2011) eMedicine.medscape.com</ref>

; I. — Buttocks augmentation treatments
; Gluteal implants
The augmentation of the buttocks is realized with a '''gluteal implant''', which is emplaced under each [[gluteus maximus muscle]]; the insertion of the buttock prosthesis is through a midline incision (5–8-cm-wide) over the tailbone ([[coccyx]]). Augmentation with a gluteal implant is the method most effective for enlarging the buttocks of the man or of the woman whose body possesses few stores of excess [[adipose fat]] in the lower portion of the trunk, the [[buttocks]] and [[Thigh|thighs]], the anatomic regions where the human body usually stores excess body fat. Post-operatively, because of the cutting (incising) into the flesh of the tailbone muscles, the full healing of the augmented tissues can be approximately 6–8 months, in the course of which the gluteal-muscle tissues relax, and the settled buttocks prostheses are integrated to the gluteal region.<ref>Flores–Lima G, Eppley BL. Body Contouring with Solid Silicone Implants. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. March 2009;33(2):140–146.</ref> The implantation procedure can be performed upon a patient who is either [[sedation|sedated]] or [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetized]], either under [[general anaesthesia]] or under [[local anaesthesia]]. The usual operating-room time for a buttocks augmentation procedure is approximately 2 hours; and the medical procedure can be managed either as an overnight in-patient treatment, or as a hospital outpatient treatment. Given the nature of the surgical incisions to the gluteus maximus muscles, the therapeutic management of post-surgical pain (at the surgical-wound sites) and normal tissue-healing usually require a 4-6-week convalescence, after which, the patient resumes his or her normal-life activities.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Lipoinjection
[[image:Buttock Augmentation Before & After.JPG|thumb|right|200px|'''Body contouring:''' The pre-operative posterior and right-oblique aspects (left), and the like post-operative aspects (right) of a lipoinjection butt lift and a lipectomy reduction of the lower abdomen, upper back, hips, thigh interior, and the mons pubis.]]
The augmentation and contouring of the buttocks with [[Fat transfer|autologous-fat transfer]] (lipoinjection) therapy is realized with the excess [[Adipose fat|adipose-fat tissue]] harvested from the [[abdomen]], flanks, and [[thigh]]s of the patient. The gentle liposuction applied to harvest the autologous fat minimally disturbs the local tissues, especially the [[Connective tissue|connective-tissue layer]] between the skin and the immediate subcutaneous muscle tissues. Then, the harvested fat is injected to the pertinent body area of the gluteal region, through a fine-gauge cannula inserted through a small incision, which produces a short and narrow [[scar]]. Lipoinjection contouring and augmentation with the patient’s own body fat avoids the possibility of tissue rejection, and is physically less invasive than buttocks-implant surgery. Therefore, depending upon the health of the patient, the convalescence period allows him or her to resume daily, normal-life activities at 2-days post-operative, and the full spectrum of physical activity at 2-weeks post-operative. Furthermore, the liposuction harvesting of the patient’s excess body fat improves the aesthetic appearance of the body fat donor-sites. Nonetheless, [[Physiology|physiologically]], the human body’s normal, health-management chemistry does resorb (break down and eliminate) some of the injected adipose-fat tissue, and so might diminish the augmentation. According to the degree of diminishment of the volume and contour caused by the fat-resorption, the patient might require additional sessions of fat-transfer therapy to achieve the desired size, shape, and contour of the buttocks.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Body contouring
The augmentation of the buttocks, by rearranging and enhancing the pertinent muscle and fat tissues of the gluteal region, is realized with a combined gluteoplasty procedure of '''surgery''' (subcutaneous [[Flap (surgery)|dermal-fat flaps]]) and '''liposculpture''' (fat-suction, fat-injection). Therapeutically, such a combined correction-and-enhancement procedure is a realistic and feasible lower-body-lift treatment for the man and for the woman patient who has undergone massive weight loss (MWL) in the course of resolving [[obesity]] with [[bariatric surgery]].<ref>Sozer SO, Agullo FJ, Palladino H. Autologous Augmentation Gluteoplasty with a Dermal Fat flap. Aesthetic Surgery Journal. January–February 2008;28(1):70–76.</ref><ref>Le Louarn C, Pascal JF. Autologous Gluteal Augmentation after Massive Weight Loss. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. April 2008;121(4):1515–1516; the author’s reply 1516–1517.</ref> In the case of the man or woman who presents under-projected, flat buttocks ([[Hypoplasia|gluteal hypoplasia]]), and a degree of gluteal-muscle ptosis (prolapsation, falling forward), wherein neither gluteal-implant surgery nor lipoinjection would be adequate to restoring the natural anatomic contour of the gluteal region, the application of a combined treatment of autologous dermal-fat flap surgery and lipoinjection can achieve the required functional correction and aesthetic contour.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; II. — Buttocks reduction treatments
The methods for reducing the size of the buttocks include the varieties of [[liposuction]], such as '''lipectomy''' (with and without [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic]] enhancement) to reduce excess body fat, and '''superficial liposculpture''', to reshape, refine, and re-establish the natural contour of the body. The usual buttocks-reduction treatment is lipectomy with applied [[tumescence]] and [[anaesthesia]], wherein the body fat is harvested by aspiration (suction) through a small-gauge cannula (2-4 mm) that is inserted through a small incision, either to the [[Intergluteal cleft|intergluteal sulcus]] (the butt-crack), or to the upper area of the [[gluteus maximus muscle]] proper.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Ultrasonic lipectomy
Ultrasonically-assisted liposuction can quickly remove a large volume of [[Adipose fat|body fat]] for the correction of a notable occurrence of [[lipodystrophy]], a deposit of adipose fat to the buttocks and related anatomic areas. The [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic]] liposuction machine liquefies the excess fat tissue, and so more readily facilitates its removal with conventional suction-lipectomy. The quick fat-harvesting allowed by the ultrasonic lipectomy technique has eliminated the larger (long and wide) surgical incisions that once were required for removing a large volume of adipose tissue. Nonetheless, because of the sensitivity of the gluteal-region tissues, the skin of the pertinent donor-site is cooled in order to prevent ultrasonic heat damage caused by the liquefying and removal of the excess adipose fat.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Superficial liposculpture
Reshaping the buttocks with liposculpture is performed with a small cannula (2 mm) specifically for contouring superficial body fat, the configuration of which (number of open ports) is determined by the type and the degree of gluteal correction to be realized. To sculpt rounded contours to square-shaped buttocks muscles, superficial liposculpture allows the plastic surgeon to control the injection-rate of the fat-volume. Moreover, superficial liposuction can be combined with other treatment methods for contouring the gluteal region to achieve the required functional, anatomic correction, and the aesthetic enhancement sought by the patient, such as reshaping the lateral area of the buttocks into an athletic form.<ref>Centeno RF, Young VL.

Combined with any buttocks-correction method, superficial liposculpture facilitates the treatment of contour irregularities, the surgical revision of scars, and the correction of gluteal-region contour depressions.<ref>Ali A.

=== Surgical technique ===
; Surgical contouring of the gluteal region
; Pre-operative matters
To meet the functional requirements and the aesthetic expectations ([[body image]]) of the patient, the plastic surgeon establishes a realistic and feasible surgery plan by which to correct the anatomic contour deficiencies of the gluteal region. The surgeon and the patient determine the location of the surgical-wound [[scar]]s, and determine the best operative position, to allow the proper exposure of the pertinent anatomy to be corrected. Because the surgical procedure requires the [[tumescence]] and [[anaesthesia]] of the gluteal-region area to be corrected, the physician and the [[anaesthesiologist]] determine the volumes of the anaesthetic and [[tumescent]] fluids to be administered to the patient during the procedure, and so avoid the risks of drugs overdose and toxicity.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Intra-operative matters
Once the patient is atop the operating table, the surgeon positions him or her to best expose the pertinent gluteal-region area that is to be corrected or contoured, or both; the usual operative position is the prone (face down) position, but the patient can also be positioned laterally (on his or her side). The surgical correction plan can be delineated and marked to the patient’s body when he or she is awake (before sedation or anaesthesia) or it can be delineated when the patient is on the operating table (already [[Sedation|sedated]] or [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetized]]). In operative praxis, the second option allows the plastic surgeon greater freedom to properly manipulate the patient into the position best suited for performing the body-contouring surgery.

; Operative matters
Once the patient is in the operative position, the surgeon begins the liposuction correction by making incisions to the marks of the surgical-correction plan, and then infiltrates (injects) a solution of anaesthesia- and tumescence-inducing drugs, usually a combination of [[lidocaine]] and [[epinephrine]]. The volume of the anaesthetic-tumescent solution is gradually infiltrated to the pertinent gluteal area, in order to avoid the nerves and the deeper anatomic structures of the gluteus maximus muscle. The particular anatomic features to be contoured determine the types of cannula (gauge, size, grade) used to effect and control the harvesting of excess adipose fat from the patient’s body.

For a lipoinjection augmentation, the surgeon first dissects and prepares the augmentation-pocket to which will be injected the autologous fat-tissue. The surgical creation (muscle dissection) of the augmentation-pocket avoids the gluteal innervation ([[superior gluteal nerve]] and [[inferior gluteal nerve]]) and the vascular system ([[Venous blood|venous]] and [[Arterial blood|arterial]]) of the [[gluteus maximus muscle]]. Afterwards, the surgeon [[Surgical suture|sutures]] the dissection-incision and secures it with adhesive tape to ensure that the augmentation-pocket remains open, as dissected, ready to receive the injections of adipose fat. For the revision of scars, with surgery and injections of autologous fat, or with allopathic synthetic fillers, the surgeon applies subcuticular closures to the incision wounds, which then are bandaged.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Post-operative matters
After completing the surgical corrections and the lipoinjection contouring of the pertinent area(s) of the gluteal region, the surgeon thoroughly examines the patient to ensure his or her general recovery from the operation; and examines each surgical incision to ascertain that it is correctly sutured and taped, in order to facilitate the uneventful healing of the gluteus-muscle tissues, without medical complications. The patient is advised to avoid exercise and strenuous physical activity until 3-weeks post-operative; how to properly care for surgical-incision wounds; and how to wear a compression garment that will keep in place the surgically corrected tissues, and so ensure their healing as a whole anatomic unit of the gluteal region.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Follow-up and convalescence
The physician advises the patient who has undergone a '''surgical contouring''' of the buttocks with gluteal implants, that, although immediate results can be observed, the final, corrected body contour usually is observed at 6-months post-operative, and at 1-year post-operative, depending upon the tissue-healing capabilities of the patient’s body. The '''liposculpture''' patient usually requires approximately 6 months, and occasionally 1 year before producing the final, corrected body contour. For both procedures, at approximately 1-month post-operative, marked aesthetic improvement is noticeable in the corrected body areas, as is the elimination of the initial, post-operative weight gain caused by the body’s retention of the infiltrated, [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetic]] and [[Tumescence|tumescent]], fluids. The patient is advised to wear a compression garment to contain swelling and to immobilize the corrected tissues, so that they heal as one anatomic unit of the gluteal region. Moreover, throughout the convalescence, to facilitate shrinking the skin to the new, corrected body contour, and to resolve unevenness, wrinkles to the skin, and localized swelling, the continual application of massage and (occasional) ultrasound treatments can facilitate the diminishment of the post-operative conditions.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Complications
The surgical and liposculpture contouring of the human body presents possible medical complications such as: the psychological — unmet [[body image]] expectations of aesthetic improvement; the physical — uneven contour, local and general; the physiologic — toxic reactions to the [[Allergic reactions to anaesthesia|anaesthesic]] and the [[tumescence|tumescent]] drugs; and the nervous — [[paresthesia]], localized areas of perduring numbness in the corrected portion(s) of the gluteal region.<ref name="Reisman"/> The medical complications possible to a '''surgical buttocks augmentation''' procedure, the submuscular emplacement of a gluteal implant, include [[infection]], [[Wound dehiscence|surgical-wound dehiscence]] that exposes the implant, revision surgery, rupture of the implant, [[seroma]] (a pocket of clear serous fluid), [[capsular contracture]], asymmetry of the corrected area, shifting of the implant, surgical over-correction, injury to the [[sciatic nerve]], and [[paresthesia]] (tingling skin). The medical complications possible to a '''liposclupture buttocks augmentation''' include the bodily resorption of some of the injected adipose fat, asymmetric contour of the corrected body area, an irregular contour to the body, seroma, [[abscess]] (pus enclosed by inflamed tissue), [[cellulitis]] (subcutaneous connective-tissue inflammation), and paresthesia.<ref name="Reisman"/>

* '''Unmet expectations'''
In the surgical praxis of body contouring therapy, the patient’s [[Body image|body-image]] expectations can be different from the contoured body that is the outcome of the performed surgical operation. Such unmet aesthetic expectations can be avoided at the pre-operative consultation stage, whereby, with informed consent, the physician and the patient jointly establish a realistic and feasible surgery plan to achieve a mutually satisfactory corrective outcome (functional and aesthetic) of the operation to the gluteal region, the buttock- and thigh-areas.<ref name="Reisman"/>

* '''Contour problems'''
Contour problems of the corrected gluteal region can be prevented with the operational use of small-gauge cannulas (ca. 2.0 mm) specifically for superficial liposuction; and with the application of cross-pattern harvesting of the excess body fat, to avoid removing too much [[adipose fat]] tissue, which might disfigure the contour of the patient’s fat-donor area. The possible contour problems that might arise from ultrasonic liposuction are skin burns and hypertrophic scarring, which might occur if the fat-donor area skin is not cooled and protected during the fat harvest. To that end, the infusion of a tumescence-inducing solution to the fat-donor area(s) assists in cooling the patient’s skin during the ultrasonic lipo-harvesting; likewise, the application of moist towels, a skin protector, and the constant cooling-fluid infiltration of the cannula in an integrated sheath.<ref name="Reisman"/>

* '''Drug complications (anaesthetic and tumescent)'''
The infiltration of a solution of [[anaesthesia]]- and [[tumescence]]-inducing drugs can present medical complications such as a fluid overload of the tissues, the inadequate replacement of the infiltrated solution, and the partitioning (separation) of a single infiltration into several pools, which  then are removed by suction lipectomy. Moreover, during anaesthesia, maintaining the patient’s stable blood pressure can be difficult, which increases the possibility of bleeding, and the possibility that [[Allergic reactions to anaesthesia|anaesthetic toxicity]] can occur if excessive doses are administered by infiltration; the symptoms are manifested as [[central nervous system]] (CNS) occurrences of drug-induced [[anxiety]], apprehension, restlessness, nervousness, disorientation, confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, nausea, vomiting, shivering, and seizures; likewise, as manifestations of drowsiness, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and respiratory arrest. Furthermore, the toxicity symptoms of a tumescence-inducing drug (e.g. [[epinephrine]]) might cause such CNS symptoms, for which reason the operative application of a tumescent drug is limited throughout the operation.<ref name="Reisman"/>

* '''Numbness (paresthesia)'''
Post-operatively, local areas of numbness ([[paresthesia]]) might occur in the contoured portion(s) of the gluteal region, and might perdure for a long time after the surgery. Hence, the patient is advised to facilitate the re-sensitizing of the numb area(s) with applications of gentle massage, to prevent the development of a [[neuroma]] complication, and to alleviate pain. Nonetheless, depending upon the tissue-healing capabilities of the patient, he or she can recover in full at 2-years post-operative.<ref name="Reisman"/>

; Outcome
The outcome of a buttocks-contouring procedure depends upon the specific defect or deformity that can be effectively corrected with liposculpture, [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic]] or not. Nonetheless, depressed scars and deep [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] defects are difficult to correct because of the curvature of the buttocks as an anatomic unit, and because of the scar-contracting elements of the tissues across the gluteal curvature. In such a case, although the injection of (autologous or artificial) tissue fillers to correct the defect or the deformity might be impermanent — it usually will remedy the functional and aesthetic shortcoming(s) required by the patient, which is the therapeutic purpose of gluteoplasty.<ref name="Reisman"/>
