'''Claude's syndrome''' is a form of [[brainstem stroke syndrome]] characterized by the presence of an [[oculomotor nerve palsy]], contralateral [[hemiparesis]], contralateral [[ataxia]], and contralateral [[hemiplegia]] of the lower face, tongue, and shoulder.

==Cause and presentation==
[[Image:Human brainstem blood supply description.JPG|thumb|Human brainstem blood supply description. [[Posterior cerebral artery]] is #6, and [[midbrain]] is behind it.]]
Claude's syndrome is caused by [[midbrain]] [[infarction]] as a result of occlusion of a branch of the [[posterior cerebral artery]].<ref>{{GPnotebook|691339295}}</ref>  This lesion is usually a unilateral infarction of the [[red nucleus]] and [[cerebral peduncle]], affecting several structures in the midbrain including:

! Structure damaged
! Effect
|-
| [[dentatorubral]] fibers
| contralateral ataxia
|-
| [[corticospinal tract]] fibers 
| contralateral hemiparesis
|-
| [[corticobulbar tract]] fibers 
| contralateral hemiplegia of lower facial muscles, tongue, and shoulder
|-
| [[oculomotor nerve]] fibers 
| [[ipsilateral]] [[oculomotor nerve palsy]] with a drooping eyelid and fixed wide pupil pointed down and out; probable [[diplopia]]
|}

It is very similar to [[Benedikt's syndrome]].

===Other causes===
It has been reported that posterior cerebral artery [[stenosis]] can also precipitate Claude's syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dhanjal T, Walters M, MacMillan N | title=Claude's syndrome in association with posterior cerebral artery stenosis | journal=Scottish Medical Journal | year=2003 | volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=91–92 |url=http://www.smj.org.uk/0803/claude.htm |pmid=12968516}}</ref>

==History==
It carries the name of [[Henri Claude|Henri Charles Jules Claude]], a French psychiatrist and neurologist, who described the condition in 1912.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Claude H, Loyez M | title=Ramollissement du noyau rouge | journal=Rev Neurol (Paris) | year=1912 | volume=24 | pages=49–51}}</ref>
