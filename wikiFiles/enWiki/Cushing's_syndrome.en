'''Cushing's syndrome''' describes the signs and symptoms associated with prolonged exposure to inappropriately high levels of the hormone [[cortisol]]. This can be caused by taking [[glucocorticoid]] drugs, or diseases that result in excess cortisol, [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] ([[ACTH]]), or CRH levels.<ref>Kumar, Abbas, Fausto. ''Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease'', 7th ed. Elsevier-Saunders; New York, 2005.</ref>

[[Cushing's disease]] refers to a [[pituitary]]-dependent cause of Cushing's syndrome: a tumor ([[adenoma]]) in the pituitary gland produces large amounts of [[ACTH]], causing the [[adrenal gland]]s to produce elevated levels of cortisol. It is the most common non-[[iatrogenic]] cause of Cushing's syndrome, responsible for 70% of cases excluding glucocorticoid related cases.<ref>''Schwartz's principles of surgery'', 8th ed., p.1455.</ref><ref name="endocrine.niddk">[http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/cushings/cushings.htm#1 Cushing's Syndrome] at The National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service.

Cushing's syndrome is not confined to humans and is also a relatively common condition in domestic [[dog]]s and [[horse]]s. It also occurs in [[cat]]s, but rarely.


==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms include rapid [[obesity|weight gain]], particularly of the trunk and face with sparing of the limbs ([[central obesity]]). A common sign is the growth of fat pads along the collar bone and on the back of the neck and a round face often referred to as a "[[moon face]]." Other symptoms include [[hyperhidrosis]] (excess sweating), [[telangiectasia]] (dilation of capillaries), thinning of the skin (which causes easy bruising and dryness, particularly the hands) and other mucous membranes, purple or red [[Stretch marks|striae]] (the weight gain in Cushing's syndrome stretches the skin, which is thin and weakened, causing it to hemorrhage) on the trunk, buttocks, arms, legs or breasts, proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), and [[hirsutism]] (facial male-pattern hair growth), [[baldness]] and/or extremely dry and brittle hair.  In rare cases, Cushing's can cause [[hypercalcemia]], which can lead to skin necrosis. The excess cortisol may also affect other endocrine systems and cause, for example, [[insomnia]], inhibited [[aromatase]], reduced [[libido]], [[impotence]] in men, [[amenorrhoea]]/[[oligomenorrhea]] and [[infertility]] in women due to elevations in [[androgens]]. Studies have also shown that the resultant amenorrhea is due to hypercortisolism, which feeds back onto the hypothalamus resulting in decreased levels of [[GnRH]] release.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9745407</ref> Patients frequently suffer various psychological disturbances, ranging from [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] to [[psychosis]]. [[clinical depression|Depression]] and [[anxiety]] are also common.<ref>{{cite book |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences |last=Yudofsky |first=Stuart C. |coauthors=Robert E. Hales |edition=5th |year=2007 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub, Inc. |isbn=1-58562-239-7 }}</ref>

Other striking and distressing skin changes that may appear in Cushing's syndrome include facial acne, susceptibility to superficial [[dermatophyte]] and [[malassezia]] infections, and the characteristic purplish, atrophic striae on the abdomen.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{rp|500}}

Other signs include [[polyuria]] (and accompanying [[polydipsia]]), persistent [[hypertension]] (due to cortisol's enhancement of [[epinephrine]]'s vasoconstrictive effect) and [[insulin resistance]] (especially common in [[Ectopic hormone|ectopic]] ACTH production), leading to [[hyperglycemia]] (high [[blood sugar]]) and insulin resistance which can lead to [[diabetes mellitus]].  Insulin resistance is accompanied by skin changes such as [[acanthosis nigricans]] in the [[axilla]] and around the neck, as well as [[skin tag]]s in the axilla. Untreated Cushing's syndrome can lead to [[heart disease]] and increased [[death|mortality]]. Cushing's disease due to excess [[ACTH]] may also result in [[hyperpigmentation]]. This is due to Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). Cortisol can also exhibit [[mineralcorticoid]] activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypertension and leading to [[hypokalemia]] (common in ectopic ACTH secretion). Furthermore, [[gastrointestinal]] disturbances, opportunistic infections and impaired wound healing (cortisol is a stress hormone, so it depresses the immune and inflammatory responses). [[Osteoporosis]] is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome since osteoblast activity is inhibited. Additionally, Cushing's may cause sore and aching joints, particularly in the hip, shoulders, and lower back.  Cushing’s syndrome includes all the causes of increased cortisol leading to the diseased state.  Cushing’s disease is a subset of Cushing’s syndrome that refers to Cushing’s syndrome caused by a pituitary tumor.  When this occurs, ACTH levels are high which ultimately leads to increased cortisol production by the adrenal glands.  Ectopic ACTH production (e.g. by a small cell lung cancer) is another cause of Cushing’s syndrome that has high ACTH.  When Cushing's syndrome is caused by an increase of cortisol at the level of the adrenal glands (via an adenoma or hyperplasia), this causes negative feedback which ultimately reduces ACTH production in the pituitary. This type of Cushing's syndrome doesn't cause hyperpigmentation because there is no excess of ACTH. Again, Cushing's disease is an excess of ACTH at the pituitary level which causes increase cortisol release from the adrenals. This increased ACTH may cause hyperpigmentation as previously described. While all Cushing’s disease is Cushing’s syndrome, not all Cushing’s syndrome is Cushing’s disease.

In summary:
* Extreme weight gain
* Moodiness, irritability, or depression
* Muscle and bone weakness
* [[Osteoporosis]]
* [[Diabetes mellitus]]
* [[Hypertension]]
* Immune suppression
* Sleep disturbances
* Menstrual disorders such as [[amenorrhea]] in women and decreased fertility in men
* [[Hirsutism]]
* [[Baldness]]
* [[Hypercholesterolemia]]

==Cause==
There are several possible causes of Cushing's syndrome.

===Exogenous vs. endogenous===

The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome is [[Exogeny|exogenous]] administration of [[glucocorticoid]]s prescribed by a health care practitioner to treat other diseases (called ''[[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] Cushing's syndrome''). This can be an effect of steroid treatment of a variety of disorders such as [[asthma]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], or in [[immunosuppression]] after an organ transplant. Administration of synthetic ACTH is also possible, but ACTH is less often prescribed due to cost and lesser utility. Although rare, Cushing's syndrome can also be due to the use of medroxyprogesterone.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Siminoski | first1 = K | last2 = Goss | first2 = P | last3 = Drucker | first3 = DJ | title = The Cushing syndrome induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate | journal = Annals of internal medicine | volume = 111 | issue = 9 | pages = 758–60 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2552887}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.301.6747.345-a | last1 = Merrin | first1 = PK | last2 = Alexander | first2 = WD | title = Cushing's syndrome induced by medroxyprogesterone | journal = BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | volume = 301 | issue = 6747 | pages = 345 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2144198 | pmc = 1663616}}</ref> In this form of Cushing's, the adrenal glands atrophy due to lack of stimulation by ACTH, since glucocorticoids downregulate production of ACTH.

[[Endogeny|Endogenous]] Cushing's syndrome results from some derangement of the body's own system of secreting cortisol. Normally, [[ACTH]] is released from the [[pituitary gland]] when necessary to stimulate the release of cortisol from the [[adrenal gland]]s.

* In ''pituitary Cushing's'', a benign pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH. This is also known as ''Cushing's disease'' and is responsible for 70% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome.<ref name="endocrine.niddk" />

* In ''adrenal Cushing's'', excess cortisol is produced by adrenal gland tumors, hyperplastic adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia.

* Tumors outside the normal pituitary-adrenal system can produce ACTH (occasionally with CRH) that affects the adrenal glands. This etiology is called ''ectopic'' or ''[[paraneoplasia|paraneoplastic]] Cushing's disease'' and is seen in diseases like [[small cell carcinoma|small cell]] [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schteingart DE, Lloyd RV, Akil H, Chandler WF, Ibarra-Perez G, Rosen SG, Ogletree R.|title=Cushing's syndrome secondary to ectopic corticotropin-releasing hormone-adrenocorticotropin secretion.|journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab.|year=1989|pmid=3525603|volume=63|issue=3|pages=770–5}}</ref>
* Finally, rare cases of CRH-secreting tumors (without ACTH secretion) have been reported, which stimulates pituitary ACTH production.<ref name="Voyadzis JM, Guttman-Bauman I, Santi M, Cogen P. 2004 212–6">{{cite journal|author=Voyadzis JM, Guttman-Bauman I, Santi M, Cogen P.|title=Hypothalamic hamartoma secreting corticotropin-releasing hormone.

===Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome===
Elevated levels of total cortisol can also be due to estrogen found in oral contraceptive pills that contain a mixture of estrogen and progesterone, leading to [[Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome]]. Estrogen can cause an increase of [[transcortin|cortisol-binding globulin]] and thereby cause the total cortisol level to be elevated. However, the total free cortisol, which is the active hormone in the body, as measured by a 24 hour urine collection for urinary free cortisol, is normal.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jcp.s1-3.1.11 | journal = J Clin Pathol | year =  1969 | volume = 3 | pages = 11–18 | title = The effect of oral contraceptives on cortisol metabolism | author = C. W. Burke | pmc = 1436049 | pmid = }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[Iatrogenic]] Cushing's syndrome (caused by treatment with [[corticosteroid]]s) is the most common form of Cushing's syndrome. The incidence of pituitary tumors may be relatively high, as much as one in five people,<ref name="pmid15274075">{{cite journal |author=Ezzat S, Asa SL, Couldwell WT, ''et al.'' |title=The prevalence of pituitary adenomas: a systematic review |journal=Cancer |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=613–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15274075 |doi=10.1002/cncr.20412}}</ref> but only a minute fraction are active and produce excessive hormones.

==Pathophysiology==
The [[hypothalamus]] is in the brain and the [[pituitary gland]] sits just below it. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus releases [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropin ([[ACTH]]).  ACTH travels via the blood to the adrenal gland, where it stimulates the release of [[cortisol]]. Cortisol is secreted by the cortex of the [[adrenal gland]] from a region called the ''[[zona fasciculata]]'' in response to ACTH. Elevated levels of cortisol exert [[negative feedback]] on the pituitary, which decreases the amount of ACTH released from the pituitary gland.

Strictly, '''Cushing's ''syndrome''''' refers to excess cortisol of any etiology (as [[Syndrome]] means a group of symptoms). One of the causes of Cushing's syndrome is a cortisol secreting adenoma in the cortex of the adrenal gland (''primary'' hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). The adenoma causes cortisol levels in the blood to be very high, and negative feedback on the pituitary from the high cortisol levels causes ACTH levels to be very low.

On the other hand, '''[[Cushing's disease|Cushing's ''disease'']]''' refers only to hypercortisolism secondary to excess production of ACTH from a corticotroph [[pituitary adenoma]] (''secondary'' hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH ([[Corticotropin releasing hormone]]) (''tertiary'' hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). This causes the blood ACTH levels to be elevated along with cortisol from the adrenal gland. The ACTH levels remain high because the tumor is unresponsive to negative feedback from high cortisol levels.

Cushing's ''disease'' is not to be confused with [[Ectopic Cushing syndrome]]<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001443/ Ectopic Cushing syndrome] at A.D.A.M. Medical Encyclopedia, PubMedHealth, National Institute of Health</ref> (a.k.a. Ectopic ACTH syndrome), which is often seen in [[Paraneoplastic syndrome]]. See [http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/E24.0 its ICD-10 classification].

Cushing's Syndrome was also the first autoimmune disease identified in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1293286|year=1991|last1=Medvei|first1=VC|title=The history of Cushing's disease: A controversial tale|volume=84|issue=6|pages=363–366|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|pmid=2061905}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
When Cushing's syndrome is suspected, either a [[dexamethasone suppression test]] (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level), or a 24-hour urinary measurement for cortisol offer equal detection rates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Raff H, Findling JW |title=A physiologic approach to diagnosis of the Cushing syndrome |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=138 |issue=12 |pages=980–91 |year=2003 |pmid=12809455 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12809455}}</ref> Dexamethasone is a [[glucocorticoid]] and simulates the effects of cortisol, including [[negative feedback]] on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, cortisol levels >50nmol/L would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome because there is an ectopic source of cortisol or ACTH (such as adrenal adenoma) that is not inhibited by the dexamethasone. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in [[saliva]] over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late night levels of salivary cortisol are high in Cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels may need to be ascertained.  Performing a [[physical examination]] to determine any [[visual field]] defect may be necessary if a pituitary lesion is suspected, which may compress the [[optic chiasm]] causing typical [[bitemporal hemianopia]].

When any of these tests are positive, [[CT scan]]ning of the adrenal gland and [[MRI]] of the [[pituitary gland]] are performed to detect the presence of any adrenal or pituitary [[adenoma]]s or [[incidentaloma]]s (the incidental discovery of harmless lesions). [[Scintigraphy]] of the adrenal gland with [[iodocholesterol scan]] is occasionally necessary. Very rarely, determining the ACTH levels in various veins in the body by venous catheterization, working towards the pituitary ([[Inferior petrosal sinus|petrosal sinus]] sampling) is necessary.

Plasma CRH levels are inadequate at diagnosis (with the possible exception of tumors secreting CRH) because of peripheral dilution and binding to [[CRHBP]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Jr|first=edited by Lewis S.

==Treatment==
Most Cushing's syndrome cases are caused by steroid medications ([[iatrogenic]]).  Consequently, most patients are effectively treated by carefully tapering off (and eventually stopping) the medication that causes the symptoms.

If an adrenal [[adenoma]] is identified it may be removed by surgery. An ACTH-secreting corticotrophic [[pituitary adenoma]] should be removed after diagnosis. Regardless of the adenoma's location, most patients will require steroid replacement postoperatively at least in the interim as long-term suppression of pituitary ACTH and normal adrenal tissue does not recover immediately. Clearly, if both adrenals are removed, replacement with [[hydrocortisone]] or [[prednisolone]] is imperative.

In those patients not suitable for or unwilling to undergo surgery, several drugs have been found to inhibit cortisol synthesis (e.g. [[ketoconazole]], [[metyrapone]]) but they are of limited efficacy. [[Mifepristone]] is a powerful glucocorticoid receptor antagonist has also rarely been used, but the medication faces considerable controversy due to its use as an [[abortifacient]]. In February 2012 the FDA approved mifepristone in order to control high blood sugar level ([[hyperglycemia]]) in adult patients who are not candidates for surgery, or who did not respond to prior surgery, with the warning that mifepristone should never be used by pregnant women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salutedomani.com/il_weblog_di_antonio/2012/02/fda-approves-mifepristone-korlym-for-patients-with-endogenous-cushing-s-syndrome.html |title=FDA approves mifepristone (Korlym*) for patients with endogenous Cushing' s syndrome |date=February 18, 2012}}</ref>

Removal of the adrenals in the absence of a known tumor is occasionally performed to eliminate the production of excess cortisol. In some occasions, this removes negative feedback from a previously occult pituitary adenoma, which starts growing rapidly and produces extreme levels of ACTH, leading to hyperpigmentation. This clinical situation is known as [[Nelson's syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nelson DH, Meakin JW, Thorn GW |title=ACTH-producing pituitary tumors following adrenalectomy for Cushing syndrome |journal=Ann.
