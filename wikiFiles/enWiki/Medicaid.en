''' Medicaid''' is the [[United States]] [[American health care system|health]] program for families and individuals with low income and resources. It is a [[means test|means-test]]ed program that is jointly funded by the state and federal governments, and is managed by the states.<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ Medicaid General Information] from the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] . (CMS) website</ref>  People served by Medicaid are [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]] or legal permanent residents, including low-income adults, their children, and people with certain [[Disability|disabilities]]. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify someone for Medicaid. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States. According to the Health Insurance Association of America, Medicaid is defined as a “government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care. Medicaid is state-administered and financed by both the states and the federal government” (HIAA, pg. 232).

== Features ==

Beginning in the 1990s, many states received waivers from the federal government to create [[Medicaid managed care]] programs. Under managed care, Medicaid recipients are enrolled in a private health plan, which receives a fixed monthly premium from the state. The health plan is then responsible for providing for all or most of the recipient's healthcare needs. Today, all but a few states use managed care to provide coverage to a significant proportion of Medicaid enrollees. Nationwide, roughly 60% of enrollees are enrolled in managed care plans.<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidManagCare/ Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Core eligibility groups of poor children and parents are most likely to be enrolled in managed care, while the aged and disabled eligibility groups more often remain in traditional "[[fee for service]]" Medicaid.

==Benefits==

Medicaid is for people who have low incomes. This means that the only people who are covered include: low income children, pregnant women, mothers (when children are young), and people with disabilities who do not have a work history (receiving a Supplemental Security Income, or [[SSI]]). Persons with a disability, including blindness or physical disability, deafness, mental illness can apply for SSI which comes with Medicaid. However, one must be unable to work in order to qualify for SSI. So, in order to get Medicaid, one has to declare that one is disabled and then prove that one is so disabled to the point that one could not work (NAMI). In recent years, a substantial liberalization occurred in the field of individual disability income insurance, which provides benefits when an insured is unable to work because of illness or injury (HIAA, pg.13).
Some states operate a program known as the [[Health Insurance Premium Payment Program (HIPP)]].  This program allows a Medicaid recipient to have private health insurance paid for by Medicaid. As of 2008 relatively few states had premium assistance programs and enrollment was relatively low. Interest in this approach remained high, however.<ref>Joan Alker, [http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/7782.pdf "Choosing Premium AssistanceH: What does State experience tell us?,"] The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], 2008</ref>

Included in the Social Security program under Medicaid are dental services. These dental services are an optional service for adults above the age of 21; however, this service is a requirement for those eligible for Medicaid and below the age of 21.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Benefits/Dental-Care.html Medicaid Dental Coverage Overview]</ref>
Minimum services include pain relief, restoration of teeth and maintenance for dental health. Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) is a mandatory Medicaid program for children that aims to focus on prevention on early diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> Oral screenings are not required for EPSDT recipients and they do not suffice as a direct dental referral.  If a condition requiring treatment is discovered during an oral screening, the state is responsible for taking care of this service, regardless of whether it is covered on that particular Medicaid plan.<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidDentalCoverage/Downloads/dentalguide.pdf CMS.hhs.gov]</ref>

== History ==
{{Healthcare in the United States}}

Medicaid was created by the [[Social Security Amendments of 1965]] which added Title XIX to the [[Social Security Act]]. Medicaid was created as an entitlement program to help states provide medical coverage for low-income families and other categorically related individuals who meet eligibility requirements.  Candidates include the blind, aged, disabled and pregnant women.  In essence, Medicaid serves as the nation’s primary source of health insurance coverage for low-income populations. Each state administers its own Medicaid program, establishes their own eligibility standards, determines the scope and types of services they will cover, and sets the rate of payment.  Benefits vary from state to state, and because someone qualifies for Medicaid in one state, it does not mean they will qualify in another.<ref>U.S. Social Security Administration, Office of Retirement and Disability Policy, Annual Statistical Supplement, 2011; http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2011/medicaid.html, retrieved October 19, 2012.  </ref> The federal [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) monitors the state-run programs and establishes requirements for service delivery, quality, funding, and eligibility standards. 

The [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]] and the [[Health Insurance Premium Payment Program]] (HIPP) were created by the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]] (OBRA-90).  This act helped to add Section 1927 to the Social Security Act of 1935 which became effective on January 1, 1991.  This program was formed due to the costs that Medicaid programs were paying for outpatient drugs at their discounted prices.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidDrugRebateProgram/ Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] (OBRA-93) amended Section 1927 of the Act as it brought changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,<ref name="autogenerated3" /> as well as requiring states to implement a [[Medicaid estate recovery]] program to sue the estate of decedents for medical care costs paid by Medicaid.<ref>[http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/estaterec.htm "Medicaid Estate Recovery", "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", April 2005]</ref>

There is also a [http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Delivery-Systems/Fee-for-Service.html Fee for Service (Direct Service) Program] that is offered to schools throughout the United States for the reimbursement of costs associated with the services delivered to special education students. Federal law mandates that every disabled child in America receive a “free appropriate public education.” Decisions by the United States Supreme Court and subsequent changes in federal law make it clear that Medicaid must pay for services provided for all Medicaid eligible disabled children. 

In 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] expanded Medicaid eligibility starting in 2014; people with income up to 133% of the [[Poverty line in the United States#Measures of poverty|poverty line]] qualify for coverage, including adults without dependent children. However, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in [[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius]] that states do not have to agree to this expansion in order to continue to receive Medicaid funding. As of March 27, 2013, fifteen [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governors have declared that their states will not participate in Medicaid eligibility expansion and three Republican governors have said their states are leaning toward not participating in Medicaid eligibility expansion.<ref>{{cite web|author=American Health Line|date=March 28, 2013|title=Medicaid: Where each state stands on the Medicaid expansion|work=AHLAlerts: American Health Line’s Blog|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=The Advisory Board Company|url=http://ahlalerts.com/2012/07/03/medicaid-where-each-state-stands-on-the-medicaid-expansion/#more-7798|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref> The federal government will pay 100% of the cost of Medicaid eligibility expansion in 2014, 2015 and 2016; 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% in 2020 and all subsequent years.<ref>{{cite news|author=HHS Press Office|date=March 29, 2013|title=HHS finalizes rule guaranteeing 100 percent funding for new Medicaid beneficiaries|location=Washington, D.C.||publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|url=http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/03/20130329a.html|accessdate=April 23, 2013|quote=effective January 1, 2014, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost of certain newly eligible adult Medicaid beneficiaries.

== State implementations ==

States may bundle together the administration of Medicaid with other programs such as the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIP), so the same organization that handles Medicaid in a state may also manage the additional programs. Separate programs may also exist in some localities that are funded by the states or their political subdivisions to provide health coverage for indigents and minors.

State participation in Medicaid is voluntary; however, all states have participated since 1982 when Arizona formed its [[Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System]] (AHCCCS) program. In some states Medicaid is subcontracted to private health insurance companies, while other states pay providers (i.e., doctors, clinics and hospitals) directly.  There are many services that can fall under Medicaid and some states support more services than other states.  The most provided services are intermediate care for mentally retarded, prescription drugs and nursing facility care for under 21-year-olds.  The least provided services include institutional religious (non-medical) health care, respiratory care for ventilator dependent and PACE (inclusive elderly care).<ref>{{cite book|last=Dáil|first=Paula vW.|title=Women and Poverty in 21st Century America|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=NC, USA|isbn=978-0-7864-4903-3|page=137|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4903-3}}</ref> 

Most states administer Medicaid through their own programs. A few of those programs are listed below:

* California: [[Medi-Cal]]
* Maine: MaineCare
* Massachusetts: [[MassHealth]]
* Oregon: [[Oregon Health Plan]]
* Oklahoma: [[Soonercare]]
* Tennessee: [[TennCare]]
* Wisconsin: [[BadgerCare]]

As of January 2012, Medicaid and/or CHIP funds could be obtained to help pay employer health care premiums in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, and Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/chipmodelnotice.pdf|title=Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Offer Free Or Low-Cost Health Coverage To Children And Families|publisher=United States Department of Labor/Employee Benefits Security Administration}}</ref>

== Enrollment ==
According to CMS, the Medicaid program provided health care services to more than 46.0 million people in 2001.<ref>CMS, [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareProgramRatesStats/02_SummaryMedicareMedicaid.asp Medicaid and Medicare Summaries]</ref><ref>CMS, [http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ Medicaid General Information]</ref> In 2002, Medicaid enrollees numbered 39.9 million Americans, the largest group being children <ref>{{cite web|last=CMS|title=A Profile of Medicaid: Chartbook 2000|url=https://www.cms.gov/TheChartSeries/downloads/2Tchartbk.pdf|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> (18.4 million or 46 percent). Some 43 million Americans were enrolled in 2004 (19.7 million of them children) at a total cost of $295 billion. In 2008, Medicaid provided health coverage and services to approximately 49 million low-income children, pregnant women, elderly people, and disabled people. In 2009 Medicaid provided health care for approximately 50.1 million Americans and 62.9 million Americans, or about one of every five persons in the U.S., were enrolled in Medicaid for at least one month.<ref>http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Research/ActuarialStudies/downloads/MedicaidReport2010.pdf</ref> In [[California]], about 23% of the population was enrolled in [[Medi-Cal]] for at least 1 month in 2009-10.<ref>[http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/dataandstats/statistics/Documents/2_1_Reporting_Year_FY2009-10.pdf Medi-Cal Program Enrollment Totals for Fiscal Year 2009-10], [[California Department of Health Care Services]] Research and Analytic Studies Section, June 2011</ref>

Medicaid payments currently assist nearly 60 percent of all nursing home residents and about 37 percent of all childbirths in the United States. The federal government pays on average 57 percent of Medicaid expenses.

Loss of income and medical insurance coverage during the [[2008 recession|2008-2009 recession]] resulted in a substantial increase in Medicaid enrollment in 2009. Nine U.S. states showed an increase in enrollment of 15% or more, resulting in heavy pressure on state budgets.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/health/policy/01medicaid.html "Recession Drove Many to Medicaid Last Year"] article by Kevin Sack in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 30, 2010, accessed October 1, 2010</ref>

== Comparisons with Medicare ==
Unlike Medicaid, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is a [[social insurance]] program funded at the federal level<ref>[http://www.medicare.gov/LongTermCare/Static/Home.asp Medicare.gov - Long-Term Care<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and focuses primarily on the older population.  As stated in the CMS website,<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareGenInfo/ Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Medicare is a [[health insurance]] program for people age 65 or older, people under age 65 with certain disabilities, and people of all ages with [[End Stage Renal Disease (US Federal Program)|end stage renal disease]].  The Medicare Program provides a Medicare part A which covers hospital bills, Medicare Part B which covers medical insurance coverage, and Medicare Part D which covers prescription drugs.

Medicaid is a program that is not solely funded at the federal level. States provide up to half of the funding for the Medicaid program. In some states, counties also contribute funds. Unlike the Medicare entitlement program, Medicaid is a [[means-tested]], [[needs-based]] [[Social welfare provision|social welfare]] or [[Social security#Social protection|social protection]] program rather than a [[social insurance]] program. Eligibility is determined largely by income. The main criterion for Medicaid eligibility is limited income and financial resources, a criterion which plays no role in determining Medicare coverage. Medicaid covers a wider range of health care services than Medicare.
Some people are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare and are known as [[Medicare dual eligible]]s.<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/DualEligible/ Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2001, about 6.5 million Americans were enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid.

== Eligibility ==
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage or nursing home coverage to certain categories of low-asset people, including children, pregnant women, parents of eligible children, people with disabilities and elderly needing nursing home care. Medicaid was created to help low-asset people who fall into one of these eligibility categories "pay for some or all of their medical bills."<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidEligibility/ "Medicaid Eligibility: Overview," ] from the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) website</ref>

There are two general types of Medicaid coverage.  "Community Medicaid" helps people who have little or no medical insurance. Medicaid nursing home coverage pays all of the costs of nursing homes for those who are eligible except that the recipient pays most of his/her income toward the nursing home costs, usually keeping only $66.00 a month for expenses other than the nursing home.

While Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) set out the general rules under which Medicaid operates, each state runs its own program. Under certain circumstances, an applicant may be denied coverage. As a result, the eligibility rules differ significantly from state to state, although all states must follow the same basic framework.

=== Poverty ===
Having limited assets is one of the primary requirements for Medicaid eligibility, but poverty alone does not qualify people to receive Medicaid benefits unless they also fall into one of the defined eligibility categories.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ Overview - What is Not Covered], U.S. Department of Health & Human Services</ref> According to the CMS website, "Medicaid does not provide medical assistance for all poor persons. Even under the broadest provisions of the Federal statute (except for emergency services for certain persons), the Medicaid program does not provide health care services, even for very poor persons, unless they are in one of the designated eligibility groups."<ref name="autogenerated1" /> In 2010, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] expanded Medicaid eligibility starting in 2014; people with income up to 133% of the [[Poverty line in the United States#Measures of poverty|poverty line]] qualify for coverage, including adults without dependent children.<ref name="ksr_hlth">{{cite news|url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2010/March/22/consumers-guide-health-reform.aspx|first=Phil |last=Galewitz|title=Consumers Guide To Health Reform|date=March 26, 2010|newspaper=Kaiser Health News}}</ref><ref name="cnn_ref1">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/03/25/health.care.law.basics/index.html|title=5 key things to remember about health care reform|publisher=CNN|date=March 25, 2010 | accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref>. However, the [[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius|United States Supreme Court ruled]] that the Federal government must make participation in the expanded Medicaid program voluntary, and several state governments have declared that they will not participate.<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Lawmaker-says-Neb-must-move-quickly-on-health-law-3670166.php#page-1</ref>

=== Categories ===
There are a number of Medicaid eligibility categories; within each category there are requirements other than income that must be met. These other requirements include, but are not limited to, assets, age, pregnancy, disability, blindness, income and resources, and one's status as a U.S. citizen or a lawfully admitted immigrant.<ref name="autogenerated4">[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidEligibility/ Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]] (DRA) requires that anyone seeking Medicaid must produce documents to prove that he or she is a United States citizen or resident alien. An exception is made for Emergency Medicaid where payments are allowed for the pregnant and disabled regardless of immigration status.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pregnant Illegal Aliens Overwhelming Emergency Medicaid|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/14/95414.shtml|publisher=Newsmax.com|accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Healthcare for Wisconsin Residents|url=http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/medicaid/Publications/p-10164.pdf|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services
|accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref> Special rules exist for those living in a nursing home and disabled children living at home. A child may be covered under Medicaid if they are a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident.

A child may be eligible for Medicaid regardless of the eligibility status of its parents or guardians.  Thus, a child can be covered by Medicaid based on its individual status even if its parents are not eligible. Similarly, if a child lives with someone other than a parent, it may still be eligible based on its individual status.<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidEligibility/Downloads/MedicaidataGlance05.pdf CMS.hhs.gov]</ref>

=== Coverage and Use ===
One-third of children and over half (59%) of low-income children are insured through Medicaid or [[SCHIP]].  The insurance provides them with access to preventive and primary services which are used at a much higher rate than for the uninsured, but still below the utilization of privately insured patients.  As of February 2011, a record 90% of children have coverage. However, 8 million children remain uninsured, including 5 million who are eligible for Medicaid and [[SCHIP]] but not enrolled.<ref>[http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/7698-05.pdf KFF.org]</ref>

=== Dental ===
Children enrolled in Medicaid are individually entitled under the law to comprehensive preventive and restorative dental services, but dental care utilization for this population is low. The reasons for low use are many, but a lack of
dental providers who participate in Medicaid is a key factor.<ref>[http://www.cdhp.org/system/files/TrendNotesOctober2009.pdf CDHP.org]</ref><ref>U.S. General Accountability Office.

Columbia University. 2009.</ref>

=== HIV ===
Medicaid provided the largest portion of federal money spent on health care for people living with [[HIV]]/AIDS until the implementation of Medicare Part D when the prescription drug costs for those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid shifted to Medicare.  Unless low income people who are HIV positive meet some other eligibility category, they are not eligible for Medicaid assistance unless they can qualify under the "disabled" category to receive Medicaid assistance — as, for example, if they progress to [[AIDS]] ([[T-cell]] count drops below 200).<ref>"Medicaid and HIV/AIDS," Kaiser Family Foundation, fact sheet, [http://www.kff.org/hivaids/upload/7172_04.pdf kkf.org]</ref> The Medicaid eligibility policy contrasts with the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA) guidelines which recommend therapy for all patients with T-cell counts of 350 or less, or in certain patients commencing at an even higher T-cell count.  Due to the high costs associated with HIV medications, many patients are not able to begin [[antiretroviral]] treatment without Medicaid help.  More than half of people living with AIDS in the US are estimated to receive Medicaid payments. Two other programs that provide financial assistance to people living with HIV/AIDS are the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)]] and the [[Supplemental Security Income]].

===Supplemental Security Income Beneficiaries===
Once someone is approved as a beneficiary in the [[Supplemental Security Income]] program they may automatically be eligible for Medicaid coverage (depending on the laws of the state they reside in).

=== Assets ===
Both the federal government and state governments have made changes to the eligibility requirements and restrictions over the years. The [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]] (DRA) significantly changed the rules governing the treatment of asset transfers and homes of nursing home residents.<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NewFreedomInitiative/downloads/LTC%20Roadmap%20to%20Reform.pdf CMS.hhs.gov]</ref> The implementation of these changes proceeded state-by-state over the next few years and has now been substantially completed.

====Five year "look-back"====
The DRA created a five-year "look-back period."  That means that any transfers without fair market value (gifts of any kind) made by the Medicaid applicant during the preceding five years are penalizable, dollar for dollar.  All transfers made during the five-year look-back period are totaled, and the applicant is penalized that amount after having already dropped below the Medicaid asset limit.  This means that after dropping below the asset level ($2,000 limit in most states), the Medicaid applicant then has to re-pay all transfers during the preceding five years by private-paying for nursing home costs.  Since the person has less than $2,000, there is no source of funds to pay the penalty.  Elders who gift or transfer assets can be caught in the situation of having no money but still not being eligible for Medicaid.

====No gifting====
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2013}}
The annual IRS gifting exclusion is $13,000 a year as of 2009.  But this gift exclusion is only a federal [[gift tax]] rule: if a person gifts $13,000 or less during a year, that gift is not required to be reported and does not generate gift tax liability for the donor or the recipient. However, Medicaid has never honored the annual gift tax exclusion.  Gifts of any size during the five years preceding a Medicaid application are totaled and penalized dollar for dollar.

Medicaid planners typically advise retirees and other people facing high nursing home costs to adopt strategies that will protect their financial assets in the event of nursing home admission. State Medicaid programs do not consider the value of one's home in calculating eligibility, therefore it is often recommended that retirees pursue home ownership.  By adopting the recommended strategies, many seniors hope they will quickly qualify for Medicaid benefits if the need for long-term care arises.

A cottage industry has developed with attorneys providing "Medicaid planning" for those in a nursing home or likely to be admitted.  The attorneys develop plans to convert countable assets to exempt assets, thereby making an elder with excess assets eligible.  Planning techniques can also prevent the homestead from being lost to a Medicaid lien.  Legal asset protection can be done at any point since a conversion of a countable asset to an exempt asset is not a transfer without fair market value and is therefore not subject to the five-year look-back period.

Unlike Medicare, which is solely a federal program, Medicaid is a joint federal-state program. Each state operates its own Medicaid system, but this system must conform to federal guidelines in order for the state to receive matching funds and grants.<ref>[[Puerto Rico]] is considered a “state” for Medicaid purposes. Id. § 1301(a)(1).</ref> The matching rate provided to states is determined using a federal matching formula (called [[Federal Medical Assistance Percentages]]), which generates payment rates that vary from state to state, depending on each state's respective per capita income.<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title11/1101.htm SSA.gov], Social Security Act. Title IX, Sec. 1101(a)(8)(B)</ref> The wealthiest states only receive a federal match of 50% while poorer states receive a larger match.

Medicaid funding has become a major budgetary issue for many states over the last few years, with states, on average, spending 16.8% of state general funds on the program. If the federal match expenditure is also counted, the program, on average, takes up 22% of each state's budget.<ref>[http://www.nasbo.org/Publications/PDFs/Fiscal%20Survey%20of%20the%20States%20June%202007.pdf Microsoft Word - Final Text.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://ccf.georgetown.edu/index/medicaid-and-state-budgets-looking-at-the-facts "Medicaid and State Budgets: Looking at the Facts"], Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, May 2008.</ref> Some 43 million Americans were enrolled in 2004 (19.7 million of them children) at a total cost of $295 billion.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In 2008, Medicaid provided health coverage and services to approximately 49 million low-income children, pregnant women, elderly people, and disabled people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Federal Medicaid outlays were estimated to be $204 billion in 2008.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hhs.html "Budget of the United States Government, FY 2008"], Department of Health and Human Services, 2008.</ref>

Medicaid does not pay benefits to individuals directly; Medicaid sends benefit payments to health care providers. In some states Medicaid beneficiaries are required to pay a small fee (co-payment) for medical services.<ref name="autogenerated4" /> Medicaid is limited by federal law to the coverage of "medically necessary services".<ref name="Adler">Peter W. Adler. [http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/pdf/2011-12_Adler.pdf ''Is it lawful to use Medicaid to pay for circumcision?''] 19 J Law Med 335-353 (2011). PMID 22320007.</ref> 

Medicaid payments currently assist nearly 60 percent of all nursing home residents and about 37 percent of all childbirths in the United States. The federal government pays on average 57 percent of Medicaid expenses.

On November 25, 2008, a new federal rule was passed that allows states to charge premiums and higher co-payments to Medicaid participants.<ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/ search: 42 CFR Parts 447 and 457]</ref> This rule will enable states to take in greater revenues, limiting financial losses associated with the program. Estimates figure that states will save $1.1 billion while the federal government will save nearly $1.4 billion. However, this means that the burden of financial responsibility will be placed on 13 million Medicaid recipients who will face a $1.3 billion increase in co-payments over 5 years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/us/27medicaid.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=medicaid&st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Pear | title=New Medicaid Rules Allow States to Set Premiums and Higher Co-Payments | date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> The major concern is that this rule will create a disincentive for low-income people to seek healthcare. It is possible that this will force only the sickest participants to pay the increased premiums and it is unclear what long term effect this will have on the program.

A 2011 paper by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard School of Public Health, “The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment: Evidence from the First Year,” use Oregon’s 2008 decision to hold a randomized lottery for the provision of Medicaid insurance in order to measure the impact of health insurance on an individual’s health and well-being. The study examined the outcomes of the 10,000 lower-income people eligible for Medicare who were chosen by this randomized system, which helped eliminate potential bias in the data produced. The study's authors caution that the survey sample is relatively small and "estimates are therefore difficult to extrapolate to the likely effects of much larger health insurance expansions, in which there may well be supply side responses from the health care sector." Nevertheless, the study finds evidence that: 1) Hospital use increased by 30% for those with insurance, with the length of hospital stays increasing by 30% and the number of procedures increasing by 45% for the population with insurance; 2) Medicaid recipients proved more likely to seek preventive care. Women were 60% more likely to have mammograms, and recipients overall were 20% more likely to have their cholesterol checked; 3) In terms of self-reported health outcomes, having insurance was associated with an increased probability of reporting one’s health as “good,” “very good,” or “excellent” — overall, about 25% higher than the average; 4) Those with insurance were about 10% less likely to report a diagnosis of depression.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/oregon-health-insurance-experiment/ |title = Oregon Health Insurance Experiment: Evidence from the First Year |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>
