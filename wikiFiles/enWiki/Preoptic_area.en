The '''preoptic area''' is a region of the [[hypothalamus]]. According to the [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] classification, it is considered part of the anterior hypothalamus. There are four [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] in this region, according to [[Terminologia Anatomica]] (Medial, Median, Lateral, and Paraventricular).

==Functions==
The preoptic area is responsible for [[thermoregulation]] and receives nervous stimulation from [[thermoreceptors]] in the skin, [[mucous membrane]]s, and hypothalamus itself.<ref>{{cite book | title = Neuroanatomy: Text and Atlas | author = Martin, John Harry | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2003}}</ref>

This area propagates stimuli to either the heat-losing or the heat-promoting centers of the hypothalamus.

==Nuclei==

===Median preoptic nucleus===
The median preoptic nucleus is located along the midline in a position significantly dorsal to the other 3 preoptic nuclei, at least in the macaca fascicularis brain. It wraps around the top (dorsal), front, and bottom (ventral) surfaces of the [[anterior commissure]].

The median preoptic nucleus generates [[thirst]]. Drinking decreases [[noradrenaline]] release in the median preoptic nucleus.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6SYP-48JK5V6-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=98f2049c170f9f5eca0cfe489545ac60 Drinking decreases the noradrenaline release in the median preoptic area caused by hypovolemia in the rat] Hiroko Miyakubo, Kazuo Yamamoto, Satoko Hatakenaka, Yasushi Hayashi and Junichi Tanaka </ref>

===Medial preoptic nucleus=== <!--Median preoptic nucleus redirects here-->
{{Main|Sexually dimorphic nucleus}}
The medial preoptic nucleus is bounded laterally by the lateral preoptic nucleus, and medially by the preoptic periventricular nucleus. It releases [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH), controls copulation in males, and is larger in males than in females.

===Lateral preoptic nucleus===
The lateral preoptic nucleus is lateral to the medial preoptic nucleus.  It also mediates non-REM sleep onset.

===Preoptic periventricular nucleus===
The preoptic periventricular nucleus is located along the midline and is medial to the medial preoptic nucleus.

==Aging==
Studies in female mice have shown that estrogen receptor-alpha declines in the pre-optic [[hypothalamus]] as they grow old. The female mice that were given a [[Calorie_restriction|calorie-restricted]] diet during the majority of their lives, maintained higher levels of ERα in the pre-optic hypothalamus than their non-calorie-restricted counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yaghmaie F, Saeed O, Garan SA, Freitag W, Timiras PS, Sternberg H. |title=Caloric restriction reduces cell loss and maintains estrogen receptor-alpha immunoreactivity in the pre-optic hypothalamus of female B6D2F1 mice. |journal=Neuro Endocrinol Lett. |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=197–203 |year=2005  |pmid=15990721}}</ref>
