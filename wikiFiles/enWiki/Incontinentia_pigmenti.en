'''Incontinentia Pigmenti''' (also known as "Bloch–Siemens syndrome,"<ref name="Bolognia" /> "Bloch–Sulzberger disease,"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=M. B.

It is named due to its microscopic appearance.

==Presentation==

[[File:Maculae Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome.jpg|Incontinentia pigmenti forming along [[Blaschko's lines]] in a 3-year-old girl.|thumb]]
The skin [[lesion]]s evolve through characteristic stages: 
# blistering (from birth to about four months of age),
# a [[wart]]-like rash (for several months),
# swirling macular [[hyperpigmentation]] (from about six months of age into adulthood), followed by
# linear [[hypopigmentation]].

[[Alopecia]], [[hypodontia]], abnormal tooth shape, and dystrophic nails are observed. Some patients have retinal vascular abnormalities predisposing to retinal detachment in early childhood. Cognitive delays/mental retardation are occasionally seen.

Discolored skin is caused by excessive deposits of [[melanin]] (normal skin [[pigment]]). 
Most newborns with IP will develop discolored skin within the first two weeks. 
The pigmentation involves the [[torso|trunk]] and [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]], is slate-grey, blue or brown, and is distributed in irregular marbled or wavy lines. 
The discoloration sometimes fades with age. 

Neurological problems can include: [[cerebral atrophy]], the formation of small cavities in the central white matter of the brain, and the loss of [[neurons]] in the [[cerebellar cortex]]. 
About 20% of children with IP will have slow [[motor development]], muscle weakness in one or both sides of the body, mental retardation, and seizures. 
They are also likely to have visual problems, which can include: [[crossed eyes]], [[cataracts]], and severe visual loss. 
Dental problems are common, and include missing or peg-shaped teeth - patients with IP often keep milk teeth into adult life.

Breast anomalies can occur in 1% of patients; anomalies can include [[hypoplasia]] and supernumerary nipples.

Skeletal and structural anomalies can occur in approximately 14% of patients, including:
[[Somatic asymmetry]],
[[Hemivertebrae]],
[[Scoliosis]],
[[Spina bifida]],
[[Syndactyly]],
[[Acheiria]] ([[congenital]] absence of the hands - note: other limbs may be affected),
Ear anomalies,
Extra ribs,
Skull deformities,
Primary pulmonary hypertension,
and Cardiopulmonary failure

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of IP is established by clinical findings and occasionally by corroborative skin biopsy. Molecular genetic testing of the NEMO [[IKBKG]] gene (chromosomal locus Xq28) reveals disease-causing mutations in about 80% of probands. Such testing is available clinically. 

In addition, females with IP have skewed X-[[chromosome]] inactivation; testing for this can be used to support the diagnosis.

Many people in the past were misdiagnosed with a second type of IP, called IP2. This has now been given its own name - ''''Hypomelanosis of Ito'''' ([[incontinentia pigmenti achromians]]). This has a slightly different presentation: swirls or streaks of hypopigmentation and depigmentation.

It is ''not'' inherited.  It does not involve skin stages 1 or 2. Some 33–50% of patients have multisystem involvement — eye, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities. 

Its chromosomal locus is at Xp11, not Xp28.

==Genetics==
IP is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner.<ref name="pmid11098039">{{cite journal |author=Pettigrew R |title=A pregnancy following PGD for X-linked dominant [correction of X-linked autosomal dominant] incontinentia pigmenti (Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome): case report |journal=Hum.

DermNet NZ">{{cite web |url=http://dermnetnz.org/systemic/incontinentia-pigmenti.html |title=Incontinentia pigmenti. DermNet NZ |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> IP is lethal in most, but not all, males. A female with IP may have inherited the IKBKG mutation from either parent or have a new gene mutation. Parents may either be clinically affected or have germline [[mosaicism]]. Affected women have a 50% risk of transmitting the mutant IKBKG allele at conception; however, most affected male conceptuses miscarry. Thus, the expected ratio for liveborn children is 33% unaffected females, 33% affected females, and 33% unaffected males. [[Genetic counseling]], prenatal testing, and [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] is available.  

In females, the cells expressing the mutated IKBKG gene due to [[lyonization]] selectively die around the time of birth so the X-inactivation is extremely skewed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smahi A |title=Genomic rearrangement in NEMO impairs NF-kappaB activation and is a cause of incontinentia pigmenti.

IP is caused by mutations in a gene called NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator).

==History==
This disorder was first reported by [[Bruno Bloch]], a [[Germany|German]] [[dermatologist]] in 1926 and [[Marion Sulzberger]], an [[United States|American]] dermatologist in 1928.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1762|Bloch-Sulzberger pigment dermatosis (Bruno Bloch)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bloch, B. |title=Eigentümliche, bisher nicht beschriebene Pigmentaffektion (incontinentia pigmenti) |journal=Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift |volume=56 |issue= |pages=404–5 |year=1926 |location=Basel }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sulzberger, M.B. |title=Über eine bisher nicht beschriebene kongenitale Pigmentanomalie (incontinentia pigmenti) |journal=Archiv für Dermatologie und Syphilis |volume=154 |pages=19–32 |year=1927 |location=Berlin}}</ref>
