==Biography==
Chao is a native of [[Yanshui District|Yanshui Township]] in [[Tainan County]] (now part of [[Tainan City]]) and graduated from [[National Taiwan University]]'s School of Medicine in 1998. After graduation, he did not serve his military service, as he was excused on account of [[gout]]. Chao worked as a resident doctor in the [[National Taiwan University Hospital]] (NTUH) [[Orthopaedic Surgery]] department from 1998 to 2003.

===Scandals===
Chao was taken into custody on 24 May 2006 by Taipei Municipal Court on charges of insider stock trading and embezzlement. After his arrest, the NTUH suspended his hospital privileges.  On 10 July 2006, Chao was officially charged with [[insider trading]], and the prosecutors sought to have him imprisoned for eight years.<ref name=indict>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2006/07/11/85670/Chao-Chien-ming.htm "Chao Chien-ming indicted, released on NT$10 mil. bail"], China Post</ref>  As per the ROC criminal procedure, Chao was then allowed to post bail of 10,000,000 [[New Taiwan dollar]]s.<ref name=indict/>  His father Chao Yu-chu (趙玉柱), who was not taken into custody, was also charged with similar offences and prosecutors sought to have him imprisoned for ten years.<ref name=indict/>  Chao issued a public apology for "careless behavior" but indicated that he believed himself to be innocent and intended to fight the charges.<ref name=apology/>  (DPP chairman [[Yu Shyi-kun]] and Vice President [[Annette Lu]] have both said that they found Chao's apology to be insufficient.)  The NTUH administration has indicated that it believed that laws and internal regulations require the NTUH to restore Chao's privilege should Chao apply for reinstatement, but Chao has not done so so far, although he had been seen at the hospital frequently since his release.  In response, on 14 July, NTU ordered that Chao not be allowed to be in the hospital except when escorted by security guards.

On 27 December 2006, the Taipei Municipal Court sentenced Chao Yu-chu to 8 years and 4 months, and Chao Chien-ming to 6 years in prison for their insider trading; each was also given a fine of [[NT$]]30 million.  The Chaos' attorneys indicated that they will appeal.

In February 2008, a patient accused Chao of malpractice and indicated he will sue in court.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
