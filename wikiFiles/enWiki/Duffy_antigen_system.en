'''Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor''' ('''DARC''') also known as '''Fy glycoprotein''' (FY) or  '''CD234''' ('''C'''luster of '''D'''ifferentiation 234) is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''DARC'' [[gene]].<ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: DARC Duffy blood group, chemokine receptor| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=2532| accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="pmid8248172">{{cite journal | author = Chaudhuri A, Polyakova J, Zbrzezna V, Williams K, Gulati S, Pogo AO | title = Cloning of glycoprotein D cDNA, which encodes the major subunit of the Duffy blood group system and the receptor for the Plasmodium vivax malaria parasite | journal = Proc.

The Duffy antigen is located on the surface of [[red blood cell]]s, and is named after the patient in which it was discovered. The protein encoded by this gene is a [[glycoprotein|glycosylated]] [[membrane protein]] and a non-specific [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] for several [[chemokine]]s. The protein is also the receptor for the human malarial parasites ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi]]''. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] in this gene are the basis of the Duffy blood group system.<ref name="entrez_2532">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: Duffy antigen| url =http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=2532 | accessdate = }}</ref>

== History ==

It was noted in the 1920s that black Africans had some intrinsic resistance to infection with malaria, but the basis for this remained unknown. The Duffy antigen gene was the fourth gene associated with the resistance after the genes responsible for [[sickle cell anaemia]], [[thalassemia]] and [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]]. 

In 1950, the Duffy [[antigen]] was discovered in a multiply-transfused [[hemophiliac]] whose serum contained the first example of anti-Fya [[antibody]].<ref>

In 1951, the antibody to a second antigen, Fyb, was discovered in [[blood plasma|serum]]. Using these two antibodies, three common [[phenotypes]] were defined: Fy(a+b+), Fy(a+b-), and Fy(a-b+).

Several other types were later discovered bringing the current total up to 6: Fya, Fyb, Fy3, Fy4, Fy5 and Fy6. Only Fya, Fyb and Fy3 are considered clinically important. Reactions to Fy5 have also rarely been reported.

== Genetics and genomics ==

The Duffy antigen /chemokine [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] gene (gp-Fy; CD234) is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 1]] (1.q22-1.q23) and was cloned in 1993.<ref name="pmid8248172"/> The gene was first localised to chromosome 1 in 1968 and was the first blood system antigen to be localised. It is a single copy gene spanning over 1500 bases and is in two [[exon]]s. It encodes a 336 amino acid acidic [[glycoprotein]]. The gene carries the antigenic determinants of the Duffy blood group system which consist of four codominant [[allele]]s—FY*A and FY*B—coding for the Fy-a and Fy-b antigens respectively, FY*X and FY*Fy, five [[phenotype]]s (Fy-a, Fy-b, Fy-o, Fy-x and Fy-y) and five antigens. Fy-x is a form of Fy-b where the Fy-b gene is poorly expressed. Fy-x is also known as Fy-b<sup>weak</sup> or Fy-b<sup>Wk</sup>.

Fy-a and Fy-b differ by in a single [[amino acid]] at position 42: [[glycine]] in Fy-a and [[aspartic acid]] in Fy-b ([[guanine]] in Fy-a and  [[adenosine]] in Fy-b at position 125). A second mutation causing a Duffy negative phenotype is known: the responsible mutation is G -> A at position 298. The genetic basis for the Fy(a-b-) phenotype is a [[point mutation]] in the erythroid specific [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] (a T -> C mutation at position -33 in the [[GATA box]]). This mutation occurs in the Fy-b allelle and has been designated Fy-b<sup>Es</sup> (erythroid silent). Two isotypes have been identified. The Fy-x allelle is characterized by a weak anti-Fy-b reaction and appears to be the result of two separate [[Transition (genetics)|transitions]]: [[Cytosine]]265[[Threonine]] ([[Arginine]]89[[Cysteine]]) and [[Guanine]]298[[Adenosine]] ([[Alanine]]100[[Threonine]]). A third mutation (a [[transversion (genetics)|transversion]]) in this gene has also been described - G145T ([[Alanine]]49[[Serine]]) - that has been associated with the Fy-x phenotype. 

Most Duffy negative blacks carry a silent Fy-b [[allele]] with a single T to C substitution at [[nucleotide]] -46, impairing the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] activity in erythroid cells by disrupting a binding site for the [[GATA1]] erythroid [[transcription factor]]. The gene is still transcribed in non erythroid cells in the presence of this [[mutation]].

The Duffy negative phenotype occurs at low frequency among whites (~3.5%) and is due to a third mutation that results in an unstable protein (Arg89Cys: [[cytosine]] -> [[thymidine]] at position 265).<ref name="pmid10738032">{{cite journal | author = Yazdanbakhsh K, Rios M, Storry JR, Kosower N, Parasol N, Chaudhuri A, Reid ME | title = Molecular mechanisms that lead to reduced expression of duffy antigens | journal = Transfusion | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 310–20 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10738032 | doi = 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40030310.x | url =   }}</ref>

Three exons are present in humans and chimpanzees while only two exons occur in the other species. This additional exon is located at the 5' end and is entirely non coding. Both intron and exon size vary considerably between the species examined. Between the chimpanzee and the human 24 differences in the nucleotide sequence were noted. Of these 18 occurred in non coding regions. Of the remaining 6, 3 were synonymous and 3 non synonymous mutations. The significance of these mutations if any is not known.

The mouse ortholog has been cloned and exhibits 63% homology to the human gene at the amino acid level. The mouse gene is located on chromosome 1 between the genetic markers Xmv41 and D1Mit166. The mouse gene has two exons (100 and 1064 nucleotides in length respectively), separated by a 461 base pair intron. In the mouse DARC is expressed during embryonic development between days 9.5 and 12.

Consequently the Fy protein is also known as DARC (Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines). The chemokine binding site on the receptor appears to be localised to the [[N-terminus|amino terminus]].<ref name="Lu1995">{{cite journal |author=Lu ZH, Wang ZX, Horuk R, ''et al.'' |title=The promiscuous chemokine binding profile of the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines is primarily localized to sequences in the amino-terminal domain |journal=J.

Alignment with other seven transmembrane [[G-protein-coupled receptor]]s shows that DARC lacks the highly conserved DRY motif in the second intracellular loop of the [[protein]] that is known to be associated with G-protein signaling. Consistent with this finding ligand binding by DARC does not induce G-protein coupled signal transduction nor a Ca2+ flux unlike other chemokine receptors. Based on these alignments the Duffy antigen is considered to be most similar to the [[interleukin 8 receptor, beta|interleukin-8B receptor]]s.

[[Scatchard analysis]] of competition binding studies has shown high affinity binding to the Duffy antigen with dissociation constants (KD) binding values of 24 ± 4.9, 20 ± 4.7, 41.9 ± 12.8, and 33.9 ± 7 nanoMoles for MGSA, interleukin-8, RANTES and monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 respectively.<ref name="Chaudhuri1994">{{cite journal | author = Chaudhuri A, Zbrzezna V, Polyakova J, Pogo AO, Hesselgesser J, Horuk R | title = Expression of the Duffy antigen in K562 cells.

In DARC-transfected cells, DARC is internalized following ligand binding and this led to the hypothesis that expression of DARC on the surface of erythrocytes, [[endothelial]], neuronal cells and [[epithelial]] cells may act as a sponge and provide a mechanism by which inflammatory chemokines may be removed from circulation as well as their concentration modified in the local environment.<ref name="Fukuma2003">{{cite journal |author=Fukuma N, Akimitsu N, Hamamoto H, Kusuhara H, Sugiyama Y, Sekimizu K |title=A role of the Duffy antigen for the maintenance of plasma chemokine concentrations |journal=Biochem.

The Duffy antigen has been shown to exist as a constitutive homo-oligomer and that it hetero-oligomerizes with the CC chemokine receptor CCR5 ([[CD195]]).

=== Pregnancy ===

Duffy antigen has rarely been implicated in haemolytic disease of the newborn.

=== Prostate cancer ===

Experimental work has suggested that DARC expression inhibits prostate tumor growth. Men of black African descent are at greater risk of prostate cancer than are men of either Causcasian or Asian descendant (60% greater incidence and double the mortality compared to Caucasians). The reasons for this increased risk are not known. The contribution of DARC to this increased risk has been tested in [[Jamaica]]n males of black African descent.<ref name="pmid20596779">{{cite journal | author = Elson JK, Beebe-Dimmer JL, Morgenstern H, Chilkuri M, Blanchard J, Lentsch AB | title = The Duffy Antigen/Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) and Prostate-Cancer Risk among Jamaican Men | journal = J Immigr Minor Health | volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 36–41| year = 2010 | month = July | pmid = 20596779 | doi = 10.1007/s10903-010-9330-z | pmc = 3017736 }}</ref> It was found that none of the increased risk could be attributed to the DARC gene.

=== Transfusion medicine ===

A Duffy negative blood recipient may have a transfusion reaction if the donor is Duffy positive.<ref name="pmid10439320" /> Since most Duffy-negative people are of African descent, blood donations from people of black African origin are important to transfusion banks.

==Transfusion data==
International Society for Blood Transfusion (ISBT) symbol: FY

ISBT number: 008

Gene symbol: FY

Gene name: Duffy blood group

Number of Duffy antigens: 6 

=== Antibody Type ===
Almost entirely IgG. IgG1 usually predominates.  IgM does occur but is rare. 

=== Antibody Behavior ===
Anti-Fy<sup>a</sup> is a common antibody while anti-Fy<sup>b</sup> is approximately 20 times less common.<ref> Roback JD et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda: AABB Press, 2008. </ref>, <ref>Klein HG, Anstee DJ. Mollison's Blood Transfusion in Clinical Medicine. 11th Ed. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2005.</ref> They are reactive at body temperature and are therefore clinically significant, although they do not typically bind complement.  Antibodies are acquired through exposure (pregnancy or history of blood transfusion) and subsequent alloimmunization. They display dosage (react more strongly to homozygous cells versus heterozygous cells). <ref> Roback JD et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda: AABB Press, 2008. </ref> 

=== Transfusion reactions === 
Typically mild but may be serious, even fatal. Although these usually occur immediately they may occur after a delay (up to 24 hours). These reactions are usually caused by anti-Fy<sup>a</sup> or anti-Fy<sup>b</sup>. anti-Fy3 may cause acute or delayed [[hemolytic transfusion reactions]] (HTRs), but only rarely.<br/> Anti-Fy5 may also cause delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions.<ref> Roback JD et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda: AABB Press, 2008. </ref>

=== [[Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn]] (HDFN) === 
This is typically mild but rarely may be serious. Almost always due to anti-Fy<sup>a</sup> and rarely anti-Fyb or Fy3.
