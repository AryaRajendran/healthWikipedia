The '''Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging''' at [[University College London]] (incorporating the Leopold Muller Functional Imaging Laboratory and the Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience) is an interdisciplinary centre for [[neuroimaging]] research based in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]].

Principal investigators working at the Centre include Professors [[Ray Dolan]], [[Jon Driver]], [[Richard Frackowiak]], [[Chris Frith]], [[Karl Friston]], [[Eleanor Maguire]], [[Cathy Price]], and [[Geraint Rees]]. The Centre is located in [[Queen Square, London|Queen Square]] in the [[Bloomsbury]] area of [[Central London]], adjacent to the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]]. 

==History==

'The Functional Imaging Laboratory (FIL)', was founded in 1994 following a major grant award from the [[Wellcome Trust]]. This provided for a new building, capital equipment and core staff support. The award enabled a core group of scientists, based at the Medical Research Council Cyclotron Unit, at the [[Hammersmith Hospital]] to relocate their activity to a central London site, within UCL.

In 1994 the principal neuroimaging research tool was [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). Over the next decade [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) became the primary investigative tool of the FIL, leading to PET decommissioning in 2004. Currently, the investigative tools of the laboratory include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [[magneto-encephalography]] (MEG) and [[electro-encephalography]] (EEG). The laboratory has continued to enjoy core Wellcome Trust infrastructure support through major grant awards in 1999 and 2004.

In 2006, following a successful bid for a Strategic Award the laboratory was awarded Wellcome Trust Centre status, and is now known as the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at UCL. In January 2007 a team from the Centre published research in the ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' which concluded that some people with amnesia may not only have difficulty recalling the past but also have difficulty imagining future experiences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/19/AR2007011901077.html|title=Past, Future May Have Common Link in Brain|accessdate=7 December 2010|publisher=The Washington Post|date=19 January 2007}}</ref> In May 2007 a team led by Ben Seymour of the Centre published research in the ''Journal of Neuro-science'' which showed that that losing money, or anticipating such a loss, stimulates the striatum in the brain, a circuit involved in the processing of pain and fear.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article1733805.ece|title=Why losing money isnâ€™t just a pain in the wallet|accessdate=7 December 2010|publisher=The Times|date=2 May 2007}}</ref> In June 2008 a team from the Centre published research in the journal ''Neuron'' showing that the ventral striatum region of the brain is more active when subjects chose unusual objects in controlled tests.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINL2540332420080625|title=Brain scientists discover why adventure feels good|accessdate=7 December 2010|publisher=Reuters|date=26 June 2008}}</ref> In December 2010 a team from the Centre published research in the journal ''Nature Neuroscience'' which showed that humans see the world differently according to the size of the visual cortex in their brain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/science/Why-you-spy-with-your.6650903.jp|title=Why you spy with your little eye, big differences|accessdate=7 December 2010|publisher=The Scotsman|date=6 December 2010}}</ref>
