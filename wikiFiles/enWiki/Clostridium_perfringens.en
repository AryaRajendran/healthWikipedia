'''''Clostridium perfringens''''' (formerly known as ''C. welchii'') is a [[Gram-positive]], rod-shaped, [[anaerobic bacterium|anaerobic]], [[Endospore|spore-forming]] [[bacterium]] of the genus ''[[Clostridium]]''.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004|isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}</ref> ''C. perfringens'' is ever present in nature and can be found as a normal component of decaying vegetation, marine sediment, the [[Intestine|intestinal tract]] of [[human]]s and other [[vertebrate]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[soil]].

Infections due to ''C. perfringens'' show evidence of tissue [[necrosis]], [[bacteremia]], [[emphysema]]tous [[cholecystitis]], and [[gas gangrene]], which is also known as clostridial [[myonecrosis]]. The toxin involved in [[gas gangrene]] is known as [[Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin|α-toxin]], which inserts into the plasma membrane of cells, producing gaps in the membrane that disrupt normal cellular function.<ref name=O.T.M>{{cite book | author = Warrell et al. | title = Oxford Textbook of Medicine | edition = 4th | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-19-262922-0 }}{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}</ref> ''C. perfringens'' can participate in polymicrobial [[anaerobic infection]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=171–7 |doi=10.1016/j.anaerobe.2007.08.004 |title=The role of anaerobic bacteria in cutaneous and soft tissue abscesses and infected cysts |year=2007 |last1=Brook |first1=I |journal=Anaerobe |volume=13 |issue=5–6 |pmid=17923425}}</ref>  ''Clostridium perfringens ''is commonly encountered in [[infection]]s as a component of the normal [[flora (microbiology)|flora]].<ref name=Barron>{{cite book | author = Wells CL, Wilkins TD | title = Clostridia: Sporeforming Anaerobic Bacilli.

The action of ''C. perfringens'' on dead bodies is known to [[mortuary]] workers as [[tissue gas]] and can be halted only by [[embalming]].

==Food poisoning==
In the United Kingdom and United States, ''C. perfringens'' bacteria are the third most common cause of foodborne illness, with poorly prepared meat and poultry, or food properly prepared but left to stand too long, the main culprits in harboring the bacterium.<ref name=O.T.M/> The [[clostridium perfringens enterotoxin]] (CPE) mediating the disease is heat-labile (inactivated at 74&nbsp;°C) and can be detected in contaminated food, if not heated properly, and feces.<ref name=M.D.T>{{cite book | author = Murray et al. | title = Medical Microbiology | edition = 6th | publisher = Mosby Elsevier | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-323-05470-6 }}{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}</ref> Incubation time is between six and 24 (commonly 10-12) hours after ingestion of contaminated food.

Since ''C. perfringens'' forms spores that can withstand cooking temperatures, if cooked food is let stand for long enough, germination can ensue and infective bacterial colonies develop. Symptoms typically include abdominal cramping, diarrhea; vomiting and fever are usual. The whole course usually resolves within 24 hours. Very rare, fatal cases of [[clostridial necrotizing enteritis]] (also known as pigbel) have been known to involve "Type C" strains of the organism, which produce a potently ulcerative [[Clostridium perfringens beta toxin|β-toxin]]. This strain is most frequently encountered in [[Papua New Guinea]].

Many cases of ''C. perfringens'' food poisoning likely remain [[subclinical]], as [[antibody|antibodies]] to the toxin are common among the population. This has led to the conclusion that most of the population has experienced food poisoning due to ''C. perfringens''.<ref name="O.T.M"/>

Despite its potential dangers, ''C. perfringens'' is used as the [[leavening agent]] in [[salt rising bread]]. The baking process is thought to reduce the bacterial contamination, precluding negative effects.<ref name="autogenerated26"/>

== Infection ==
''Clostridium perfringens'' is the most common bacterial agent for [[gas gangrene]], which is necrosis, putrefaction of tissues, and gas production. It is caused primarily by [[Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin]].  The gases form bubbles in muscle (crepitus) and the characteristic smell in decomposing tissue.  After rapid and destructive local spread (which can take only hours), systemic spread of bacteria and bacterial toxins may cause death. This is a problem in major trauma and in military contexts. ''C. perfringens'' grows readily on blood agar plate in anaerobic conditions, and often produces a double zone of beta hemolysis.

== Diagnosis ==
''C. perfringens'' can be diagnosed by Nagler's Reaction where the suspect organism is cultured on an egg yolk media plate. One side of the plate contains anti-alpha-toxin, while the other side does not. A streak of suspect organism is placed through both sides. An area of turbidity will form around the side that does not have the anti-alpha-toxin, indicating uninhibited [[lecithinase]] activity.

== Treatment ==
If detected on clinical ground, treatment should begin without waiting for lab results. Traumatic wounds should be cleaned. Wounds that cannot be cleaned should not be stitched shut. Penicillin prophylaxis kills many clostridia, and is thus useful for dirty wounds and lower leg amputations.  A high infectious dose is required; the carrier state persists for several days.

==Food poisoning incidents==
In May 2011, a man died after allegedly eating food contaminated with the bacteria on a [[Transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] [[American Airlines]] flight. The man's wife and daughter are suing American and [[LSG Sky Chefs]], the German company that prepared the inflight food.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mohn |first=Tanya |url=http://overheadbin.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/12/01/9146822-passenger-dies-in-flight-family-says-airline-to-blame |title=Overhead Bin - Passenger dies in-flight, family says airline to blame |publisher=Overheadbin.msnbc.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}</ref>

In December 2012, a 46-year-old woman died two days after eating a Christmas Day meal at a pub in [[Hornchurch]], [[Essex]], [[England]]. She was among about 30 people to fall ill after eating the meal. Samples taken from the victims contained ''C.perfringens''. The woman's husband said that he intended to take legal action over his wife's death. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2256746/They-sent-home-lay-arms-dying-Husbands-anger-hospital-pub-wife-dies-suspected-Christmas-Day-food-poisoning.html|title=Husband's anger at hospital and pub after his wife dies from suspected Christmas Day food poisoning|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=4 January 2012}}</ref>
