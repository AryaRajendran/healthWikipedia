This is a list of people, living or dead, accompanied by verifiable source citations associating them with [[bipolar disorder]] (formerly known as "manic depression"), either based on their own public statements, or (in the case of dead people only) reported contemporary or posthumous diagnoses of bipolar disorder. 

Regarding posthumous diagnoses: many famous people are believed to have been affected by bipolar disorder. Most of these listed have been diagnosed based on evidence in their own writings and contemporaneous accounts by those who knew them.  It is often suggested that [[genius]] (or, at least, creative talent) and mental disorder (specifically, the [[mania]] and [[hypomania]] of bipolar disorder) are linked; the connection was widely publicized by [[Kay Redfield Jamison]] in ''[[Touched with Fire]]'', although many of the diagnoses in the book are made by Jamison herself.  Also, persons prior to the 20th century may have incomplete or [[retrospective diagnosis|speculative diagnoses]] of bipolar disorder (e.g. [[Vincent van Gogh]].)
