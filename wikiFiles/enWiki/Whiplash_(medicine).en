Before the invention of the car, whiplash injuries were called "railroad spine" as they were noted mostly in connection with train collisions. The first case of severe neck pain arising from a train collision was documented around 1919.<ref name=Des10>{{cite book|last=Desapriya|first=Ediriweera|title=Head restraints and whiplash : the past, present, and future|year=2010|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-61668-150-0}}</ref> The number of whiplash injuries has since risen sharply due to rear-end motor vehicle collisions. Given the wide variety of symptoms are associated with whiplash injuries, the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash-Associated Disorders coined the phrase 'Whiplash-Associated Disorders'.<ref name=Des10/>

==Epidemiology==
Whiplash is the term commonly used to describe hyperflexion and hyperextension,<ref name="Lippincott Williams Wilkins">{{Cite book  | last1 = Foreman | first1 = Stephen M. | last2 = Croft | first2 = Arthur C. | title = Whiplash injuries : the cervical acceleration/deceleration syndrom | year = 2002 | publisher = Lippincott Williams  Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 0-7817-2681-6 | pages =  }}</ref> and is one of the most common nonfatal car crash injuries. More than one million whiplash injuries occur each year due to car crashes. This is an estimate because not all cases of whiplash are reported. In a given year, an estimated 3.8 people per 1000 experience whiplash symptoms.<ref name="Barnsley-1994">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Barnsley | first1 = L. | last2 = Lord | first2 = S. | last3 = Bogduk | first3 = N. | title = Whiplash injury. | journal = Pain | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–307 | month = Sep | year = 1994 | doi =  | PMID = 7838578 }}</ref> “Freeman and co-investigators estimated that 6.2% of the US population have late whiplash syndrome”.<ref name="Freeman-1999">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Freeman | first1 = MD. | last2 = Croft | first2 = AC. | last3 = Rossignol | first3 = AM. | last4 = Weaver | first4 = DS. | last5 = Reiser | first5 = M. | title = A review and methodologic critique of the literature refuting whiplash syndrome. | journal = Spine (Phila Pa 1976) | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–96 | month = Jan | year = 1999 | doi =  | PMID = 9921598 }}</ref> The majority of cases occur in patients in their late fourth decade. Unless a cervical strain has occurred with additional brain or spinal cord trauma mortality is rare.<ref name="Barnsley-1994"/>

Whiplash can occur at speeds of fifteen miles per hour or less; it is the sudden jolt, as one car hits another, that causes ones head to be abruptly thrown back and sideways. The more sudden the motion, the more bones, discs, muscles and tendons in ones neck and upper back will be damaged. Spinal cord injuries are responsible for about 6,000 deaths in the U.S. each year and 5,000 whiplash injuries per year result in quadriplegia.<ref name="Lippincott Williams Wilkins"/>

Most cases of whiplash occur among Caucasians 66.1%, as compared to 27.1% for African Americans, 8.1% for Hispanics, and 2% for Asians, as seen in figure A. After 12 months, only 1 in 5 patients remain symptomatic, only 11.5% of individuals were able to return to work a year after the injury, and only 35.4% were able to get back to work at a similar level of performance after 20 years. Estimated indirect costs to industry are $66,626 per year, depending on the level and severity. Lastly, the total cost per year was $40.5 billion in 2008, a 317% increase over 1998.<ref name="Lippincott Williams Wilkins"/>

==Anatomy==
Whiplash can be described as a sudden strain to the muscles, bones and nerves in the neck. The neck is made up of seven bones and they make up the cervical vertebrae (Floyd, Thompson). The first two cervical vertebrae are distinctive because they are not shaped like the rest. The first cervical vertebra is the atlas and the axis follows. The atlas and axis are responsible for movement from side to side (cervical rotation to the right and left); also moving forward and backward (cervical flexion and extension) (Floyd, Thompson). Excessive extension and flexion can disrupt the vertebrae. 

There are four phases that occur during “whiplash”: Initial position (before the collision), retraction, extension and rebound.  In the initial position there is no force on the neck it is stable due to inertia.<ref>Stemper, D. B., Yoganandan, N., Pintar, A.F., and Rao D.R. (2006)</ref> Anterior longitudinal ligament injuries in whiplash may lead to cervical instability.<ref>Medical Engineering And Physics, 28(6), 515-524.</ref> They explain that during the retraction phase that is when the actual “whiplash” occurs, since there is an unusual loading of soft tissues. The next phase is the extension, the whole neck and head switches to extension, and it is stopped or limited by the head restraint.  The rebound phase transpires as result of the phases that are mentioned.  

During the refraction phase the spine forms an S-Shaped curve, and this caused by the flexion in the upper planes and hyperextension at the lower planes and this exceed their physiological limits this phase the injuries occur to the lower cervical vertebrae. At the extension phase all cervical vertebrae and the head are fully extended, but do not surpass their physiological limits. Most of the injuries happen in C-5 and C-6.<ref>Panjabi, M.M., Cholewicki, J., Nibu,K., Grauer,N.J, Babat, B.L., and Dvorack,J.(1998) Mechanism of whiplash injury. Clinical Biomechanics, 13(4-5), 239-249.</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms reported by sufferers include: pain and aching to the neck and back, [[referred pain]] to the shoulders, sensory disturbance (such as [[Parasthesia|pins and needles]]) to the arms and legs, and [[headaches]]. Symptoms can appear directly after the injury, but often are not felt until days afterwards.<ref name="vv-folksam" />  Whiplash is usually confined to the spine.  The most common areas of the spine affected by whiplash are the neck and middle of the spine.

"Neck" pain is very common between the shoulder and the neck. It may be beneficial to rename this region the “shneck” because the neck may not be the primary or only cause.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Gorski| first = Jerrold M.| title = A New "Pain in the Neck"| accessdate = 2012-12-22| date = 2007-08| url = http://www.aaos.org/news/bulletin/aug07/clinical5.asp}}</ref> The “missing link” of whiplash may be towards or inside the shoulder and this would explain why neck therapy alone frequently does not give lasting relief.<ref name="Bismil">Bismil QMK,Bismil MSK, .

==Cause==
The exact [[injury]] mechanism that causes whiplash injuries is unknown. A whiplash injury may be the result of impulsive stretching of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]], mainly the ligament: [[anterior longitudinal ligament]] which is stretched or tears, as the head snaps forward and then back again causing a whiplash injury.<ref name="Medline">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000025|Whiplash}}</ref>

A whiplash injury from an automobile accident is called a cervical acceleration-deceleration injury. Cadaver studies have shown that as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and cervical spine. This forces the cervical spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower cervical spine is forced into a [[kyphosis]] while the upper cervical spine maintains its [[lordosis]]. As the injury progresses, the whole cervical spine is finally hyper-extended. 

Whiplash may be caused by any motion similar to a [[rear-end collision]] in a [[motor vehicle]], such as may take place on a [[roller coaster]]<ref>[http://www.spinalinjuryfoundation.org/research%20PDF/rollercoasterneckpain.pdf Roller Coaster Neck Pain], from the Spinal Injury Foundation</ref> or other rides at an [[amusement park]], [[sports]] injuries such as skiing accidents, other modes of transportation such as airplane travel, or from being hit, kicked or shaken.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.montazem.de/english/html/whiplash_injury.html | title = Whiplash injury | date = 2006-08-23  }}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} [[Shaken baby syndrome]] can result in a whiplash injury.<ref name="Medline" />

Whiplash associated disorders sometimes includes injury to the cerebrum. In a severe cervical acceleration-deceleration syndrome, a brain injury known as a coup-contra-coup injury occurs. A coup-contra-coup injury occurs as the brain is accelerated into the cranium as the head and neck hyperextend, and is then accelerated into the other side as the head and neck rebound to hyper-flexion or neutral position. 

"Volunteer studies of experimental, low-velocity rear-end collisions have shown a percentage of subjects to report short-lived symptoms",<ref>{{cite pmid|11508796}}</ref> 

From this type of research it has been inferred that whiplash symptoms might not always have any pathological (injury) explanation.  However, over the last decade, academic surgeons in the UK and US have sought to unravel the whiplash enigma.  A 1000 case four year observational study published in 2012 said that the "missing link" in whiplash injuries is the [[trapezius muscle]] which may be damaged through eccentric [[muscle contraction]] during the whiplash mechanism described above and below.<ref name="Bismil"/>  Another study<ref>Gorski JM and Schwartz LH,  Shoulder Impingement Presenting as Neck Pain. THE JOURNAL OF BONE & JOINT SURGERY VOL 85-A · NUMBER 4 · APRIL 2003  p635-638</ref> suggested that “shneck pain” was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulder impingement is commonly asymptomatic<ref>Yamaguchi K, Ditsios K, Middleton WD, Hildebolt CF, Galatz LM, Teefey SA. The demographic and morphological features of rotator cuff disease. A comparison of asymptomatic and symptomatic shoulders. J Bone Joint Surg Am. 2006;88:1699-704</ref> and the shoulder may be injured along with the neck in a motor vehicle accident.  Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated.  All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients' pain sources may be missed.  Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis occurs through a patient history, head and neck examination, [[X-ray]]s to rule out [[bone fracture]]s and may involve the use of [[medical imaging]] to determine if there are other injuries.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/tc/whiplash-topic-overview | title =Whiplash — Topic Overview | publisher = [[WebMD]] | date = 2006-11-16 | accessdate = 2008-01-18 }}</ref>

===Québec Task Force===
The ''Québec Task Force'' (''QTF'') has divided whiplash-associated disorders into five grades.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.maa.nsw.gov.au/getfile.aspx?Type=document&ID=1917&ObjectType=3&ObjectID=436 | format = PDF | title = Update Quebec Task Force Guidelines for the Management of Whiplash-Associated Disorders | accessdate = 2007-09-18 | date = 2001-01-01}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

* Grade 0: no neck pain, stiffness, or any physical signs are noticed
* Grade 1: neck complaints of pain, stiffness or tenderness only but no physical signs are noted by the examining physician.
* Grade 2: neck complaints and the examining physician finds decreased range of motion and point tenderness in the neck.
* Grade 3: neck complaints plus neurological signs such as decreased deep tendon reflexes, weakness and sensory deficits.
* Grade 4: neck complaints and fracture or dislocation, or injury to the spinal cord.

==Prevention==
The focus of preventive measures to date has been on the design of [[car seat]]s, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called [[headrest]]s. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crash-worthiness  of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.<ref name="vv-folksam" />{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}
 
For the last 40 years, vehicle safety researchers have been designing and gathering information on the ability of head restraints to mitigate injuries resulting from rear-end collisions. As a result, different types of head restraints have been developed by various manufactures to protect their occupants from whiplash.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zuby DS, Lund AK |title=Preventing minor neck injuries in rear crashes—forty years of progress |journal=J. Occup. Environ. Med. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=428–33 |year=2010 |month=April |pmid=20357685 |doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181bb777c |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1076-2752&volume=52&issue=4&spage=428}}</ref> 
Below are definitions of different types of head restraints.<ref>{{cite book|last=Desapriya|first=Ediriweera|title=Head restraints and whiplash : the past, present, and future|year=2010|publisher=Nova Science |location=New York|isbn=978-1-61668-150-0}}</ref> 
 
'''Head restraint''' — refers to a device designed to limit the rearward displacement of an adult occupant’s head in relation to the torso in order to reduce the risk of injury to the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear impact. The most effective head restraint must allow a backset motion of less than 60&nbsp;mm to prevent the hyperextension of the neck during impact.<ref name="Stemper-2006">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Stemper | first1 = BD. | last2 = Yoganandan | first2 = N. | last3 = Pintar | first3 = FA. | title = Effect of head restraint backset on head-neck kinematics in whiplash. | journal = Accid Anal Prev | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 317–23 | month = Mar | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.aap.2005.10.005 | PMID = 16289336 }}</ref>
 
'''Integrated head restraint''' or fixed head restraint — refers to a head restraint formed by the upper part of the seat back, or a head restraint that is not height adjustable and cannot be detached from the seat or the vehicle structure except by the use of tools or following the partial or total removal of the seat furnishing”. 
 
'''Adjustable head restraint''' — refers to a head restraint that is capable of being positioned to fit the morphology of the seated occupant. The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment. 
 
'''Active head restraint''' — refers to a device designed to automatically improve head restraint position and/or geometry during an impact”. 
 
'''Automatically adjusting head restraint''' — refers to a head restraint that automatically adjusts the position of the head restraint when the seat position is adjusted. 
 
A major issue in whiplash prevention is the lack of proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement of the head and neck during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant’s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Farmer CM, Wells JK, Lund AK |title=Effects of head restraint and seat redesign on neck injury risk in rear-end crashes |journal=Traffic Inj Prev |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=83–90 |year=2003 |month=June |pmid=16210192 |doi=10.1080/15389580309867 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389580309867?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Farmer CM, Zuby DS, Wells JK, Hellinga LA |title=Relationship of dynamic seat ratings to real-world neck injury rates |journal=Traffic Inj Prev |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=561–7 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19058103 |doi=10.1080/15389580802393041 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15389580802393041?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref>
 
In contrast to a properly adjusted head restraint, research suggests that there may be an increased risk of neck injuries if the head restraint is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the head restraint and seat-back systems. 
 
In most passenger vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, the height of the head restraint is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.
In a sitting position, the minimum height of the restraint should correspond to the top of the driver’s ear or even higher. In addition, there should be minimal distance between the back of head and the point where it first meets the restraint. 
 
Due to low public awareness of the consequence of incorrect positioning of head restraints, some passenger vehicle manufactures have designed and implemented a range of devices into their models to protect their occupants.

The [http://www.iihs.org/ Insurance Institute for Highway Safety] (IIHS) and other testing centers around the world have been involved in testing the effectiveness of head restraint and seat systems in laboratory conditions to assess their ability to prevent or mitigate whiplash injuries. They have found that over 60% of new motor vehicles on the market have “good” rated head restraints. Various organisations exist which list such vehicles

==Rehabilitation==
The potential injury to the cervical spine from [[hyper-flexion]] or [[hyperextension]] may be debilitating, and pain was reported to be the biggest stressor event experienced in daily living, so it is important to begin rehabilitation immediately to prevent future pain.<ref name="Bring-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bring | first1 = A. | last2 = Soderlund | first2 = A. | last3 = Wasteson | first3 = E. | last4 = Asenlöf | first4 = P. | title = Daily stressors in patients with acute whiplash associated disorders. | journal = Disabil Rehabil | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = 1783–9 | month =  | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3109/09638288.2012.662571 | PMID = 22512410 }}</ref> In most clinical cases, cervical collars are recommended until the pain ceases.<ref name="Schnabel-2004">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schnabel | first1 = M. | last2 = Ferrari | first2 = R. | last3 = Vassiliou | first3 = T. | last4 = Kaluza | first4 = G. | title = Randomised, controlled outcome study of active mobilisation compared with collar therapy for whiplash injury. | journal = Emerg Med J | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 306–10 | month = May | year = 2004 | doi =  | PMID = 15107368 }}</ref> If adequate treatment and rest is not taken until the injury is fully healed it can grow into a chronic pain.

==Treatment==
According to the recommendations made by the Quebec Task Force, treatment for individuals with whiplash associated disorders grade 1–3 should include manipulation, mobilizations and range of motion exercises. Non-narcotic analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be prescribed in the case of WAD 2 and WAD 3, but their use should be limited to a maximum of three weeks. A [[cervical collar]] should not be used for longer than 72 hours as it may lead to prolonged inactivity. Return to normal activities of daily living should be encouraged as soon as possible to maximize and expedite full recovery.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gurumoorthy D, Twomey L |title=The Quebec Task Force on Whiplash-Associated Disorders |journal=Spine |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=897–8 |year=1996 |pmid=8779026}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

A different approach is taken by the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who suggest that treatment for individuals with whiplash may include pain medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and a cervical collar (usually worn for two to three weeks). Range of motion exercises, physical therapy, and cervical traction may also be prescribed. Supplemental heat application may relieve muscle tension.<ref>{{NINDS|whiplash}}</ref>

Treatment for whiplash is dependent on the grade category. It can be categorized as grade 0 being no pain to grade 4 being very severe pain.  A physical examination can help identify what type of treatment is most suitable. For the most part, we{{Who|date=February 2013}} will be looking at treatment for grade 1 and 2.<ref>Suijlekom, Mekhail, N.,  H., Patel N., Van Zundert, J., Van Kleef, M., & Patijn, J. (2010)</ref> Whiplash Associated Disorders. Pain Practice, 10 (2), 131–136 states that there are two treatment options: conservative management and interventional management.  Conservative management includes active and passive treatments.  Interventional management is medical treatments and interventions this includes:  steroid treatments and botulinum toxin injections.  

Active treatments are light repetitive exercises that work the area to maintain normality.  Basic information is used to teach the patient about their injury.  These exercises are done at home or under the care of a health professional.<ref>Lundmark, H & Persson, A.L. (2006)</ref> Physiotherapy and Management in early whiplash associated disorders (WAD). Advances in Physiotherapy, 8, 98-105 suggested using three types of exercises to improve mobility: looking over each shoulder, moving the arms up and down anteriorly, and taking a deep breath while lifting the shoulders upwards and exhaling while relaxing the shoulders.  Active treatments and are usually preferred.  

Passive treatments are physiotherapy techniques such as acupuncture, massage therapy, and stimulation. These techniques all involve physical agents.<ref>SoÈderlund, A. & Lindberg P. (2001). Cognitive behavioural components in physiotherapy
management of chronic whiplash associated disorders (WAD) a randomised group study. ''Physiotherapy Theory and Practice'', 17,</ref> used physiotherapy techniques such as acupuncture, stimulation, and heat treatments in their study and the results showed that patients showed significantly less pain.  
Botulinum toxin type-A is used to treat involuntary muscle contraction and spasms.  Botulinum toxin type-A is only temporary and repeated injections need to take place in order to feel the effects <ref name="Juan-2004">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Juan | first1 = FJ. | title = Use of botulinum toxin-A for musculoskeletal pain in patients with whiplash associated disorders [ISRCTN68653575]. | journal = BMC Musculoskelet Disord | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 5 | month = Feb | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2474-5-5 | PMID = 15018625 }}</ref>

For chronic whiplash patients, rehabilitation is recommended.  Patients who entered a rehabilitation program said they were able to control their pain, they continued to use strategies that were taught to them, and were able to go back to their daily activities
