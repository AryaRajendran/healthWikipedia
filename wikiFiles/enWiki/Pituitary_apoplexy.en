'''Pituitary apoplexy''' or '''pituitary tumor apoplexy''' is [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] into or [[infarction|impaired blood supply]] of the [[pituitary gland]] at the base of the brain. This usually occurs in the presence of a [[pituitary adenoma|tumor of the pituitary]], although in 80% of cases this has not been diagnosed previously. The most common initial symptom is a [[thunderclap headache|sudden headache]], often associated with a rapidly worsening [[visual field defect]] or [[diplopia|double vision]] caused by compression of nerves surrounding the gland. This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones, predominantly [[adrenal insufficiency]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/>

The diagnosis is achieved with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[blood test]]s. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, and in many cases [[Hypophysectomy|surgical decompression]] is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop [[hypopituitarism|pituitary hormone deficiencies]] and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/>

==Signs and symptoms==
===Acute symptoms===
The initial symptoms of pituitary apoplexy are related to the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland. The most common symptom, in over 95% of cases, is a sudden-onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples. It is often associated with [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol>{{cite journal | author=Rajasekaran S, Vanderpump M, Baldeweg S, ''et al'' | title=UK guidelines for the management of pituitary apoplexy | journal=Clin Endocrinol (Oxf) | year=2011 | month=Jan | volume=74 | issue=1 | pages=9–20 | pmid=21044119 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.2010.03913.x | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2010.03913.x/full}}</ref><ref name=Murad>{{cite journal | author=Murad-Kejbou S, Eggenberger E | title=Pituitary apoplexy: evaluation, management, and prognosis | journal=Curr Opin Ophthalmol | year=2009 | month=Nov | volume=20 | issue=6 | pages=456–61 | doi=10.1097/ICU.0b013e3283319061 | pmid=19809320}}</ref><ref name=MelmedJameson>{{cite book |author=Melmed S, Jameson JL |editor=Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, ''et al.'' |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|edition=16th |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-07-139140-1 |pages=2076–97 |chapter=Disorders of the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus}}</ref> Occasionally, the presence of blood leads to [[meningism|irritation of the lining of the brain]], which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light, as well as a decreased [[level of consciousness]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Murad/><ref name=MelmedJameson/> This occurs in 24% of cases.<ref name=Nawar>{{cite journal | author=Nawar RN, AbdelMannan D, Selman WR, Arafah BM | title=Pituitary tumor apoplexy: a review | journal=J.

Pressure on the part of the [[optic nerve]] known as the [[Optic chiasm|chiasm]], which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the [[Bitemporal hemianopsia|outer side of the visual field on both sides]], as this corresponds to areas on the [[retina]]s supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect.<ref name=Murad/><ref name=Nawar/> The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, [[Homonymous hemianopsia|visual loss on one side of the visual field]] occurs.<ref name=Murad/>

Adjacent to the pituitary lies a part of the skull base known as the [[cavernous sinus]]. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the [[oculomotor nerve]] (the third [[cranial nerve]]), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a [[mydriasis|dilated pupil]]. The [[Trochlear nerve|fourth]] (trochlear) and [[Abducens nerve|sixth]] (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary.<ref name=Murad/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Bruce BB, Biousse V, Newman NJ | title=Third nerve palsies | journal=Semin Neurol | year=2007 | month=Jul | volume=27 | issue=3 | pages=257–68 | pmid=17577867 | doi=10.1055/s-2007-979681}}</ref> The cavernous sinus also contains the [[carotid artery]], which supplies blood to the [[brain]]; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to [[hemiplegia|one-sided weakness]] and other symptoms of [[stroke]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Murad/><ref name=Nawar/>

===Endocrine dysfunction===
{{main|hypopituitarism}}

[[File:Illu adrenal gland.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Schematic drawing of the kidneys and adrenal glands| The adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, are typically the first to be affected in pituitary apoplexy. When the stimulating hormone ACTH is not secreted, the adrenals cease to produce cortisol.]]
The pituitary gland consists of two parts, the [[Anterior pituitary|anterior]] (front) and [[posterior pituitary|posterior]] (back) pituitary. Both parts release [[hormone]]s that control numerous other organs. In pituitary apoplexy, the main initial problem is a lack of secretion of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH, corticotropin), which stimulates the secretion of [[cortisol]] by the [[adrenal gland]]. This occurs in 70% of those with pituitary apoplexy. A sudden lack of cortisol in the body leads to a constellation of symptoms called "adrenal crisis" or "Addisonian crisis" (after a complication of [[Addison's disease]], the main cause of adrenal dysfunction and low cortisol levels).<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> The main problems are [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] (particularly on standing), [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugars]] (which can lead to [[coma]]) and [[abdominal pain]]; the low blood pressure can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.<ref name=AdrenalCrisis>{{cite journal | author=de Herder WW, van der Lely AJ | title=Addisonian crisis and relative adrenal failure | journal=Rev Endocr Metab Disord | year=2003 | month=May | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=143–7 | doi=10.1023/A:1022938019091 | pmid=12766542}}</ref>

[[Hyponatremia]], an unusually low level of [[sodium]] in the blood that may cause [[mental confusion|confusion]] and [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], is found in 40% of cases. This may be caused by low cortisol levels or by [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion|inappropriate release]] of [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) from the posterior pituitary.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), leading to undersecretion of [[thyroid hormone]] by the [[thyroid gland]] and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to [[gonadotropin]]s ([[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted [[menstrual cycle]], [[infertility]] and decreased [[libido]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/>

==Causes==
Almost all cases of pituitary apoplexy arise from a [[pituitary adenoma]], a [[benign tumor]] of the pituitary gland. In 80%, the patient has been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms).<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but this has not been confirmed.<ref name=Murad/> In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10&nbsp;mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a [[meta-analysis]], not all these associations achieved [[statistical significance]].<ref name=Fernández>{{cite journal |author=Fernández-Balsells MM, Murad MH, Barwise A, ''et al.'' |title=Natural history of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas and incidentalomas: a systematic review and metaanalysis |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=905–12 |year=2011 |month=April |pmid=21474687 |doi=10.1210/jc.2010-1054}}</ref>

The majority of cases (60–80%) are not precipitated by a particular cause.<ref name=Murad/> A quarter has a history of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]],<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> but this is a common problem in the general population, and it is not clear whether it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy.<ref name=Swearingen/> A number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative.<ref name=Swearingen/> Amongst reported associations are [[surgery]] (especially [[coronary artery bypass graft]], where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure), [[Coagulopathy|disturbances in blood coagulation]] or [[anticoagulant|medication that inhibits coagulation]], [[radiation therapy]] to the pituitary, [[traumatic brain injury]], [[pregnancy]] (during which the pituitary enlarges) and treatment with [[estrogen]]s. Hormonal stimulation tests of the pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes. Treatment of [[prolactinoma]]s (pituitary adenomas that secrete [[prolactin]]) with [[dopamine agonist]] drugs, as well as withdrawal of such treatment, has been reported to precipitate apoplexy.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Murad/><ref name=Nawar/>

Hemorrhage from a [[Rathke's cleft cyst]], a remnant of [[Rathke's pouch]] that normally regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy.<ref name=Nawar/> Pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some as distinct from [[Sheehan's syndrome]], where the pituitary undergoes infarction as a result of [[Shock (circulatory)|prolonged very low blood pressure]], particularly when caused by [[Postpartum hemorrhage|bleeding after childbirth]]. This condition usually occurs in the absence of a tumor.<ref name=Nawar/> Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy.<ref name=MelmedJameson/><ref name=Thorner>{{cite book | author=Thorner MO, Vance ML, Horvath E, Kovacs K | chapter=The anterior pituitary | editor=Wilson JD, Foster DW | title=Williams Textbook of Endocrinology, 8th edition | year=1992 | pages=294–5 | location=Philadelpha | publisher=W.B. Saunders | isbn=0-7216-9514-0}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
The pituitary gland is located in a recess in the [[base of skull|skull base]] known as the [[sella turcica]] ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the [[hypothalamus]], a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage.<ref name=Murad/> The pituitary gland normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby [[inferior hypophyseal artery]] that generates a higher [[blood pressure]], possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue).<ref name=Nawar/> Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein [[Proliferating cell nuclear antigen|PCNA]]) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.<ref name=Murad/>

After an apoplexy, the pressure inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding structures such as the optic nerve and the contents of the cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to [[necrosis|tissue death]] due to insufficient blood supply.<ref name=Murad/>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Hypophyse MRT sag.png|thumb|Normal pituitary gland on MRI (T1 sagittal without contrast enhancement). The arrow points at the posterior pituitary (intense signal), and the arrowhead at the anterior pituitary.]]
It is recommended that [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate [[infarction]] (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or [[hemorrhage]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> Different MRI sequences can be used to establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction).<ref name=Murad/> If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to [[claustrophobia]] or the presence of metal-containing implants), a [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]] (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Nawar/>

In some instances, [[lumbar puncture]] may be required if there is a suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems ([[meningitis]] or [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]). This is the examination of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the [[subarachnoid space]].<ref name=Murad/><ref name=Nawar/> If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a [[magnetic resonance angiography|magnetic resonance angiogram]] (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify [[Cerebral aneurysm|aneurysms]] of the brain blood vessels, the most common cause of SAH.<ref name=Loftus>{{cite book |author=Post KD, Shiau JS, Walsh J | chapter=Pituitary apoplexy | pages=78–83 | editor=Loftus CM |title=Neurosurgical Emergencies | edition=2nd edition |publisher=Thieme Publishing Group |location=New York, NY |year=2008 |isbn=3-13-135052-0 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ccY3lNkU9gC&pg=PA78}}</ref>

Professional guidelines recommend that if pituitary apoplexy is suspected or confirmed, the minimal blood tests performed should include a [[complete blood count]], [[urea]] (a measure of [[renal function]], usually performed together with creatinine), [[electrolyte]]s (sodium and potassium), [[liver function tests]], routine [[coagulation]] testing, and a hormonal panel including [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]], [[growth hormone]], [[prolactin]],  [[luteinizing hormone]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]], [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]], [[thyroxine|thyroid hormone]], and either [[testosterone]] in men or [[estradiol]] in women.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/>

[[Visual field test]]ing is recommended as soon as possible after diagnosis,<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Nawar/> as it quantifies the severity of any optic nerve involvement, and may be required to decide on surgical treatment.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/>

==Treatment==
The first priority in suspected or confirmed pituitary apoplexy is stabilization of the [[circulatory system]]. Cortisol deficiency can cause severe [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=AdrenalCrisis/> Depending on the severity of the illness, admission to a [[Intensive-care medicine|high dependency unit]] (HDU) may be required.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/>

Treatment for acute adrenal insufficiency requires the administration of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[glucose|dextrose]] solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult.<ref name=AdrenalCrisis/> This is followed by the administration of [[hydrocortisone]], which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]] or [[intramuscular injection|into a muscle]].<ref name=Nawar/><ref name=AdrenalCrisis/> The drug [[dexamethasone]] has similar properties,<ref name=AdrenalCrisis/> but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce [[Cerebral edema|swelling in the brain]] around the area of hemorrhage.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9:00&nbsp;AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A level below 550&nbsp;[[Concentration#Molar_concentration|nmol/l]] indicates a need for replacement.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/>

The decision on whether to [[Hypophysectomy|surgically decompress]] the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If [[visual acuity]] is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the [[level of consciousness]] falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through [[transsphenoidal surgery]]. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the [[nose]] towards the [[sphenoid bone]], which is opened to give access to the [[sella turcica|cavity that contains the pituitary gland]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Nawar/> Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery,<ref name=Nawar/> and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.<ref name=Nawar/><ref name=Adams>{{cite book | author=Adams CB | chapter=The surgery of pituitary tumours | editor=Wass JA, Shalet SM | title=Oxford Textbook of Endocrinology and Diabetes | pages=161–2 | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2003 | isbn=0-19-263045-8}}</ref>

Those with relatively mild visual field loss or double vision only may be managed conservatively, with close observation of the level of consciousness, visual fields, and results of routine blood tests. If there is any deterioration, or expected spontaneous improvement does not occur, surgical intervention may still be indicated.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Nawar/> If the apoplexy occurred in a prolactin-secreting tumor, this may respond to [[dopamine agonist]] treatment.<ref name=Nawar/><ref name=Adams/>

After recovery, people who have had pituitary apoplexy require follow-up by an [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] to monitor for long-term consequences. MRI scans are performed 3–6&nbsp;months after the initial episode and subsequently on an annual basis.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> If after surgery some tumor tissue remains, this may respond to medication, further surgery, or [[radiation therapy]] with a "[[Radiosurgery|gamma knife]]".<ref name=Nawar/>

==Prognosis==
In larger case series, the mortality was 1.6% overall. In the group of patients who were unwell enough to require surgery, the mortality was 1.9%, with no deaths in those who could be treated conservatively.<ref name=Swearingen>{{cite book |author=Russell SJ, Miller K | chapter=Pituitary apoplexy | editor=Swearingen B, Biller BM | title=Diagnosis and management of pituitary disorders |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2008 |pages=368 |isbn=1-58829-922-8 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lqhYhpvFlTMC&pg=PA368}}</ref>

After an episode of pituitary apoplexy, 80% of people develop [[hypopituitarism]] and require some form of [[Hormone therapy|hormone replacement therapy]].<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Murad/> The most common problem is [[growth hormone deficiency]], which is often left untreated<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Nawar/> but may cause decreased [[muscle]] mass and strength, [[obesity]] and fatigue.<ref name=VanAken>{{cite journal |author=van Aken MO, Lamberts SW |title=Diagnosis and treatment of hypopituitarism: an update |journal=Pituitary |volume=8 |issue=3-4 |pages=183–91 |year=2005 |pmid=16508719 |doi=10.1007/s11102-006-6039-z}}</ref> 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop [[diabetes insipidus]], the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys due to a lack of the pituitary [[antidiuretic hormone]]. This may be treated with the drug [[desmopressin]],<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/> which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.<ref name=Jane>{{cite journal | author=Jane JA Jr, Vance ML, Laws ER | title=Neurogenic diabetes insipidus | journal=Pituitary | year=2006 | volume=9 | issue=4 | pages=327–9 | doi=10.1007/s11102-006-0414-7 | pmid=17080264}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Pituitary apoplexy is rare.<ref name=ClinEndocrinol/><ref name=Murad/> Even in people with a known pituitary tumor, only 0.6–10% experience apoplexy; the risk is higher in larger tumors.<ref name=Murad/> Based on extrapolations from existing data, one would expect 18 cases of pituitary apoplexy per one million people every year; the actual figure is probably lower.<ref name=Swearingen3/>

The average age at onset is 50; cases have reported in people between 15 and 90 years old.<ref name=Swearingen3>{{cite book |author=Russell SJ, Miller K | chapter=Pituitary apoplexy | editor=Swearingen B, Biller BM | title=Diagnosis and management of pituitary disorders |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2008 |pages=356 |isbn=1-58829-922-8 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lqhYhpvFlTMC&pg=PA356}}</ref> Men are affected more commonly than women,<ref name=Murad/> with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6.<ref name=Nawar/> The majority of the underlying tumors are "null cell" or nonsecretory tumors, which do not produce excessive amounts of hormones; this might explain why the tumor has often gone undetected prior to an episode of apoplexy.<ref name=Nawar/>

==History==
The first case description of pituitary apoplexy has been attributed to the American neurologist [[Pearce Bailey (neurologist)|Pearce Bailey]] in 1898.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Bailey P | title=Pathological report of a case of akromegaly, with special reference to the lesions in the hypophysis cerebri and in the thyroid gland; and a case of haemorrhage into the pituitary | journal=Phila Med J | year=1898 | volume=1 | pages=789–92}}</ref><ref name=Swearingen2>{{cite book |author=Russell SJ, Klahr Miller K | chapter=Pituitary apoplexy | editor=Swearingen B, Biller BM | title=Diagnosis and management of pituitary disorders |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2008 |page=354 |isbn=1-58829-922-8 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lqhYhpvFlTMC&pg=PA354}}</ref> This was followed in 1905 by a further report from the German physician Bleibtreu.<ref name=Nawar/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Bleibtreu L | title=Ein Fall von Akromegalia (Zerstorung der Hypophysis durch Blutung) | language=German | journal=Munch Med Wochenschr | year=1905 | volume=41| pages=2079–80}}</ref> Surgery for pituitary apoplexy was described in 1925.<ref name=Swearingen2/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Dott NM, Bailey P, Cushing H | title=A consideration of the hypophyseal adenomata | journal=Br J Surg | year=1925 | volume=13 | pages=314–66 | doi=10.1002/bjs.1800135009}}</ref> Before the introduction of steroid replacement, the mortality from pituitary apoplexy approximated 50%.<ref name=Nawar/>
