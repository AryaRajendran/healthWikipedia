'''Scientific consensus''' is the collective judgment, position, and [[opinion]] of the [[scientific community|community]] of [[scientist]]s in a [[Scientific discipline|particular field]] of study. Consensus implies general agreement, though not necessarily [[unanimity]].  Scientific consensus is not by itself a scientific argument, and it is not part of the [[scientific method]]. Nevertheless, consensus may be based on both scientific arguments and the scientific method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/consensus.htm|title=consensus|ref=harv}}</ref>

[[Consensus]] is normally achieved through communication  at conferences, the  publication process, replication (reproducible results by others) and [[peer review]]. These lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often recognize such a consensus where it exists, but communicating to outsiders that consensus has been reached can be difficult, because the 'normal' debates through which science progresses may seem to outsiders as contestation.<ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010">{{cite journal|author=Shwed Uri and Peter Bearman |url= http://asr.sagepub.com/content/75/6/817.full.pdf+html |title=The Temporal Structure of Scientific Consensus Formation |journal=American Sociological Review|volume=75|issue=6 |month=December |year=2010)|pages= 817–840.|accessdate= 18 December 2010|ref=harv}}</ref> On occasion, scientific institutes issue position statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the "inside" to the "outside" of the scientific community.  In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing what the consensus is can be quite straightforward. 

Scientific consensus may be invoked in popular or political debate on subjects that are controversial within the public sphere but which may not be controversial within the scientific community, such as [[evolution]]<ref>{{Cite web| title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2008-05-02|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title=NSTA Position Statement: The Teaching of Evolution|url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/evolution.aspx|publisher=National Science Teacher Association |accessdate=2008-05-02|ref=harv}}</ref> or the claimed linkage of [[MMR vaccine controversy|MMR vaccinations and autism]].<ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" />

== How consensus can change over time ==
{{Seealso|Theories and sociology of the history of science}}
There are many philosophical and historical theories as to how scientific consensus changes over time. Because the history of scientific change is extremely complicated, and because there is a tendency to project "winners" and "losers" onto the past in relation to our ''current'' scientific consensus, it is very difficult to come up with accurate and rigorous models for scientific change.<ref name="Pickering 1993">{{Cite book | last = Pickering| first= Andrew| authorlink=Andrew Pickering |title = The Mangle of Practice | year = 1995 |publisher = Chicago University Press | location = IL | isbn = 0-226-66802-9 |ref=harv }}</ref> This is made exceedingly difficult also in part because each of the various branches of science functions in somewhat different ways with different forms of evidence and experimental approaches. 

Most models of scientific change rely on new data produced by scientific [[experiment]]. The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] proposed that since no amount of experiments could ever ''prove'' a scientific theory, but a single experiment could ''disprove'' one, all scientific progress should be based on a process of [[falsifiability|falsification]], where experiments are designed with the hope of finding empirical data that the current theory could not account for, indicating its falseness and the requirement for a new theory.<ref name="PopperLSR">{{Cite book | last = Popper| first= Karl Raimund| authorlink=Karl Popper |title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | year = 1934 | edition = 2002|  publisher = Routledge Classics | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-415-27844-7 | ref=harv }} Originally published in German as {{cite book |title=Logik der Forschung : zur Erkenntnistheorie der modenen Naturwissenschaft |series-title=Schriften zur Wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung |year=1935 |publisher=Springer | location=Vienna |oclc=220936200|ref=harv}}</ref>

Among the most influential challengers of this approach was the historian [[Thomas Kuhn]], who argued instead that experimental data always provide some data which cannot fit completely into a theory, and that falsification alone did not result in scientific change or an undermining of scientific consensus. He proposed that scientific consensus worked in the form of "[[paradigm]]s", which were interconnected theories and underlying assumptions about the nature of the theory itself which connected various researchers in a given field. Kuhn argued that only after the accumulation of many "significant" anomalies would scientific consensus enter a period of "crisis". At this point, new theories would be sought out, and eventually one paradigm would triumph over the old one &mdash; a cycle of [[paradigm shift]]s rather than a linear progression towards truth. Kuhn's model also emphasized more clearly the social and personal aspects of theory change, demonstrating through historical examples that scientific consensus was never truly a matter of pure logic or pure facts.<ref name="KuhnSSR">{{Cite book | last = Kuhn| name= Thomas S.| title = The Structure of Scientific Revolutions| year = 1962 | edition = 1996| pages=| publisher = University of Chicago Press, Chicago| isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | ref=harv }}</ref> However, these periods of 'normal' and 'crisis' science are not mutually exclusive. Research shows that these are different modes of practice, more than different historical periods.<ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" />

Lastly, some more radical philosophers, such as [[Paul Feyerabend]], have maintained that scientific consensus is purely idiosyncratic and maintains no relationship to any outside truth.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul K. |last=Feyerabend |title=Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge|publisher=Atlantic Highlands : Humanities Press|year=1975|ref=harv}}</ref>

== Politicization of science ==
{{Main|Politicization of science}}

In public policy debates, the assertion that there exists a consensus of scientists in a particular field is often used as an argument for the validity of a theory and as support for a course of action by those who stand to gain from a policy based on that consensus. Similarly arguments for a ''lack'' of scientific consensus are often encouraged by sides who stand to gain from a more ambiguous policy.

For example, the [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on the causes of global warming]] is that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower">{{Cite journal| last = Oreskes| first = Naomi| authorlink = Naomi Oreskes| title = BEYOND THE IVORY TOWER: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change| journal = Science| volume = 306| page = 1686| date = December 2004| url =http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686| doi = 10.1126/science.1103618| pmid = 15576594| issue = 5702}}</ref><ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel">{{Cite book| publisher=The National Academies Press| isbn = 0-309-14588-0| last = America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council| title = Advancing the Science of Climate Change| location = Washington, D.C.| year = 2010| url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}</ref><ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices">{{cite web | title = Understanding and Responding to Climate Change| url = http://dels-old.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/climate_change_2008_final.pdf|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=30 May 2010|year=2008}}</ref> The [[history of science and technology|historian of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reporting that a survey of the abstracts of 928 science articles published between 1993 and 2003 showed none which disagreed explicitly with the notion of [[anthropogenic global warming]].<ref name="Oreskes_science">Naomi Oreskes, "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686 The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change.]" ''Science'' 306:5702 (3 December 2004): p. 1686. Accessed 7 July 2006.</ref> In an editorial published in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Oreskes stated that those who opposed these scientific findings are amplifying the normal range of scientific uncertainty about any facts into an appearance that there is a great scientific disagreement, or a lack of scientific consensus.<ref name="Oreskes_washpost">Naomi Oreskes, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26065-2004Dec25.html Undeniable Global Warming.]" ''Washington Post'' (26 December 2004): B07.</ref> Oreskes's findings were replicated by other methods that require no interpretation.<ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" />

The theory of [[evolution|evolution through natural selection]] is also supported by a strong scientific consensus; it is one of the most reliable and empirically tested theories in science.<ref name="NAS">{{cite book |author=National Academy of Science Institute of Medicine | title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism | publisher=National Academy Press | year=2008|isbn=0-309-10586-2 | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876}}</ref><ref>"That this controversy is one largely manufactured by the proponents of creationism and intelligent design may not matter, and as long as the controversy is taught in classes on current affairs, politics, or religion, and not in science classes, neither scientists nor citizens should be concerned."

The inherent uncertainty in science, where theories are never ''proven'' but can only be ''disproven'' (see [[falsifiability]]), poses a problem for politicians, policymakers, lawyers, and business professionals. Where scientific or philosophical questions can often languish in uncertainty for decades within their disciplinary settings, policymakers are faced with the problems of making sound decisions based on the currently available data, even if it is likely not a final form of the "truth". The tricky part is discerning what is close enough to "final truth". For example, social action against smoking probably came too long after science was 'pretty consensual'.<ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /> 

Certain domains, such as the approval of certain technologies for public consumption, can have vast and far-reaching political, economic, and human effects should things run awry of the predictions of scientists. However, insofar as there is an expectation that policy in a given field reflect knowable and pertinent data and well-accepted models of the relationships between observable phenomena, there is little good alternative for policy makers than to rely on so much of what may fairly be called 'the scientific consensus' in guiding policy design and implementation, at least in circumstances where the need for policy intervention is compelling. While science cannot supply 'absolute truth' (or even its complement 'absolute error') its utility is bound up with the capacity to guide policy in the direction of increased public good and away from public harm. Seen in this way, the demand that policy rely only on what is proven to be "scientific truth" would be a prescription for policy paralysis and amount in practice to advocacy of acceptance of all of the quantified and unquantified costs and risks associated with policy inaction.<ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" />

No part of policy formation on the basis of the ostensible scientific consensus precludes persistent review either of the relevant scientific consensus or the tangible results of policy. Indeed, the same reasons that drove reliance upon the consensus drives the continued evaluation of this reliance over time—and adjusting policy as needed.
