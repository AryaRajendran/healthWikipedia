'''Rupture of membranes''' ('''ROM''') or amniorrhexis is a term used during [[pregnancy]] to describe a rupture of the [[amniotic sac]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000003756|amniorrhexis}}</ref> Normally, it occurs spontaneously at [[full term]] either during or at the beginning of [[Childbirth|labor]].  Rupture of the membranes is known colloquially as "breaking the water." A [[premature rupture of membranes]] (PROM) is a rupture of  the [[amnion]] that occurs prior to the onset of labor.

==Effects==
When the amniotic sac ruptures, production of [[prostaglandins]] increases and the cushioning between the fetus and uterus is decreased, both of which processes increase the frequency and intensity of contractions.<ref name=apa>[http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/inducinglabor.html American Pregnancy Association > Inducing Labor] Last Updated: 01/2007</ref>

On occasion, with the rupture of membranes, particularly if the head is not engaged, the [[umbilical cord]] may prolapse. A [[cord prolapse]] is an [[medical emergency|obstetrical emergency]], as the descending head may block fetal-placental circulation.

Once the membranes are ruptured, bacteria may ascend and could lead to [[amnionitis]] and fetal infection.

==Types==
*'''SROM''':  spontaneous rupture of membranes. This term describes the normal, spontaneous rupture of the membranes at [[full term]]. The rupture is usually at the bottom of the [[uterus]], over the [[cervix]], causing a gush of fluid. This gush may be quite small (such as 50ml), or it can be significantly large (200-300ml) depending upon amount of fluid in the amniotic sac, and to what extent the fetal head is plugging the hole and retaining fluid in the sac.<ref name=skelton>[http://www.kiwifamilies.co.nz/Topics/Birth/Spontaneous-Rupture-of-Membranes.html kiwifamilies.co.nz > Birth > Spontaneous Rupture of Membranes] By Paula Skelton, midwife</ref>

*'''PROM''' : [[premature rupture of membranes]].  This term describes a rupture of the membranes that occurs before the onset of labor.
**'''PPROM''' : preterm, premature rupture of membranes.  This term describes a rupture of the membranes that occurs before 37 weeks gestation.

*'''AROM''' : [[artificial rupture of membranes]]. This term describes a rupture of the membranes by a third party, usually a [[midwife]] or [[obstetrician]] in order to [[labor induction|induce]] or accelerate labor.

==Detection==
Detection of rupture of membranes mainly include:<ref>{{cite pmid|8476469}}</ref>
*''Pooling test'': visualization of amniotic fluid pooling in the vagina
*[[Nitrazine]] paper test
*[[Fern test]]
