'''Human papillomavirus''' ('''HPV''') is a [[virus]] from the [[papillomavirus]] family that is capable of infecting humans. Like all papillomaviruses, HPVs establish productive infections only in [[keratinocyte]]s of the [[human skin|skin]] or [[mucous membrane]]s. While the majority of the known types of HPV cause no symptoms in most people, some types can cause [[wart]]s (verrucae), while others can – in a minority of cases – lead to cancers of the [[cervix]], [[vulva]], [[vagina]], [[human penis|penis]], [[oropharynx]] and [[anus]].<ref name="CDC-HPV-Fact">{{cite web

More than 30 to 40 types of HPV are typically transmitted through sexual contact and infect the [[genital|anogenital region]]. Some sexually transmitted HPV types may cause [[genital wart]]s.

This process usually takes 10–15 years, providing many opportunities for detection and treatment of the pre-cancerous lesion. Progression to invasive cancer can be almost always prevented when standard prevention strategies are applied, but the lesions still cause considerable burden necessitating preventive surgeries, which do in many cases involve loss of fertility.

In more developed countries, cervical screening using a [[Papanicolaou test|Papanicolaou]] (Pap) test or liquid-based cytology is used to detect abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. If abnormal cells are found, women are invited to have a [[colposcopy]]. During a colposcopic inspection, biopsies can be taken and abnormal areas can be removed with a simple procedure, typically with a [[Loop electrical excision procedure|cauterizing loop]] or, more commonly in the developing world — [[Cervical conization|by freezing]] (cryotherapy). Treating abnormal cells in this way can prevent them from developing into cervical cancer.

Pap smears have reduced the incidence and fatalities of cervical cancer in the developed world, but even so there were 11,000 cases and 3,900 deaths in the U.S. in 2008. Cervical cancer has substantial mortality in resource-poor areas; worldwide, there are an estimated 490,000 cases and 270,000 deaths each year.<ref name=Kahn>

Worldwide in 2002, an estimated 561,200 new cancer cases (5.2% of all new cancers) were attributable to HPV, making HPV one of the most important infectious causes of cancer.<ref name=Parkin06/> 84% of new cervical cancers were in the developing world, compared with about 50% of all new cancers.<ref name=Parkin06 /> High-risk oncogenic HPV types (including HPV 16 and HPV 18) are associated with 99.7% of all cervical cancers.<ref name="Ault_2006">{{cite journal|last=Ault|first=K.

About a dozen HPV types (including types 16, 18, 31, and 45) are called "high-risk" types because they can lead to [[cervical cancer]], as well as [[anal cancer]], [[vulvar cancer]], [[vaginal cancer]], and [[penile cancer]]<ref name=Parkin06>{{cite journal |author=Parkin DM |title=The global health burden of infection-associated cancers in the year 2002 |journal=Int.

Some of the HPV "early" genes, such as E6 and E7, are known to act as [[oncogene]]s that promote tumor growth and [[malignant|malignant transformation]]. Oral infection with HPV increased the risk of [[oropharyngeal cancer|HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer]] independent of [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] use.<ref name=ridge/> In the United States, HPV is expected to replace tobacco as the main causative agent for oral cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdha.org/downloads/PDFOralCancer.pdf|title=Oral Cancer on the rise among non-smokers under 50|publisher=California Dental Hygienists’ Association|accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>

The [[p53]] protein prevents cell growth and stimulates [[apoptosis]] in the presence of DNA damage. The p53 also upregulates the p21 protein, which blocks the formation of the [[Cyclin D/Cdk4]] complex, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of RB and, in turn, halting cell cycle progression by preventing the activation of [[E2F]]. In short, p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that arrests the cell cycle when there is DNA damage.

E6 has a close relationship with the cellular protein E6-AP (E6-associated protein). E6-AP is involved in the [[ubiquitin ligase]] pathway, a system that acts to degrade proteins. E6-AP binds ubiquitin to the p53 protein, thereby flagging it for proteosomal degradation.

Most HPV infections are cleared rapidly by the [[immune system]] and do not progress to cervical cancer (see Clearance subsection in Virology). Because the process of transforming normal cervical cells into cancerous ones is slow, cancer occurs in people having been infected with HPV for a long time, usually over a decade or more (persistent infection).<ref>Greenblatt R.J. 2005.

===Skin warts===
[[Image:Papilloma 2009 G1.jpg|thumb|Papilloma]]
Some HPV infections can cause [[warts]] (verrucae), which are noncancerous skin growths. Infection with these types of HPV causes a rapid growth of cells on the outer layer of the skin.<ref>Mayo Clinic.com, Common warts, http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/common-warts/DS00370/DSECTION=all&METHOD=print</ref> Types of warts include:
* [[Wart|Common wart]]s: Some "cutaneous" HPV types cause ''common'' skin warts. Common warts are often found on the hands and feet, but can also occur in other areas, such as the elbows or knees. Common warts have a characteristic [[cauliflower]]-like surface and are typically slightly raised above the surrounding skin. Cutaneous HPV types can cause genital warts but are not associated with the development of cancer.
* [[Plantar wart]]s are found on the soles of the feet. Plantar warts grow inward, generally causing pain when walking.
* Subungual or [[periungual wart]]s form under the [[fingernail]] (subungual), around the fingernail or on the [[cuticle]] (periungual). They may be more difficult to treat than warts in other locations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lountzis NI, Rahman O |title=Images in clinical medicine. Digital verrucae |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=2 |page=177 |year=2008 |pmid=18614785 |doi=10.1056/NEJMicm071912 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=18614785&promo=ONFLNS19}}</ref>
* [[Flat wart]]s: Flat warts are most commonly found on the arms, face or forehead. Like common warts, flat warts occur most frequently in children and teens. In people with normal immune function, flat warts are not associated with the development of cancer.<ref>MedlinePlus, Warts, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/warts.html#cat42 (general reference with links). Also, see</ref>
Genital warts are quite contagious, while common, flat, and plantar warts are much less likely to spread from person to person.

===Genital warts===
[[Genital wart|Genital or anal warts]] (condylomata acuminata or venereal warts) are the most easily recognized sign of genital HPV infection. Although a wide variety of HPV types can cause genital warts, types 6 and 11 account for about 90% of all cases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Greer CE, Wheeler CM, Ladner MB |title=Human papillomavirus (HPV) type distribution and serological response to HPV type 6 virus-like particles in patients with genital warts |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=2058–63 |year=1995 |pmid=7559948 |doi= |pmc=228335}}</ref><ref name=EMed/>

Most people who acquire genital wart-associated HPV types clear the infection rapidly without ever developing warts or any other symptoms. People may transmit the virus to others even if they do not display overt symptoms of infection.

HPV types that tend to cause genital warts are not those that cause cervical cancer.<ref name="CDC-HPV-Fact" /> Since an individual can be infected with multiple types of HPV, the presence of warts does not rule out the possibility of high-risk types of the virus also being present.

The types of HPV that cause genital warts are usually different from the types that cause warts on other parts of the body, such as the hands or inner thighs.

===Respiratory papillomatosis===
HPV types 6 and 11 can cause a rare condition known as recurrent [[Laryngeal papillomatosis|respiratory papillomatosis]], in which warts form on the larynx<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voicemedicine.com/papilloma.htm |title=Photos of larynx Papillomas — Voice Medicine, New York |publisher=Voicemedicine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> or other areas of the respiratory tract.<ref name=Sinal_2005 /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wu R, Sun S, Steinberg BM |title=Requirement of STAT3 activation for differentiation of mucosal stratified squamous epithelium |journal=Mol. Med. |volume=9 |issue=3–4 |pages=77–84 |year=2003 |pmid=12865943|doi=10.2119/2003-00001.Wu |pmc=1430729}}</ref>

These warts can recur frequently, may require repetitive surgery, may interfere with breathing, and in extremely rare cases can progress to cancer.<ref name=Sinal_2005 /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Moore CE, Wiatrak BJ, McClatchey KD |title=High-risk human papillomavirus types and squamous cell carcinoma in patients with respiratory papillomas |journal=Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=698–705 |year=1999 |pmid=10229596 |doi=10.1053/hn.1999.v120.a91773}}</ref>

===In the immunocompromised===
In very rare cases, HPV may cause [[epidermodysplasia verruciformis]] in immunocompromised individuals. The virus, unchecked by the immune system, causes the overproduction of keratin by skin cells, resulting in lesions resembling warts or [[cutaneous horn]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/11/12/wtree112.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Matthew | last=Moore | title=Tree man 'who grew roots' may be cured | date=12 November 2007}}</ref>

For instance, [[Dede Koswara]], an Indonesian man developed warts that spread across his body and became root-like growths. Attempted treatment by both Indonesian and American doctors included surgical removal of the warts.

==Transmission==

===Prenatal===
Although genital HPV types can be transmitted from mother to child during birth, the appearance of genital HPV-related diseases in newborns is rare. Perinatal transmission of HPV types 6 and 11 can result in the development of juvenile-onset recurrent [[respiratory papillomatosis]] (JORRP). JORRP is very rare, with rates of about 2 cases per 100,000 children in the United States.<ref name=Sinal_2005 /> Although JORRP rates are substantially higher if a woman presents with genital warts at the time of giving birth, the risk of JORRP in such cases is still less than 1%.

===Genital infections===
Since cervical and female genital infection by specific HPV types is highly associated with cervical cancer, those types of HPV infection have received most of the attention from scientific studies.

HPV infections in that area are transmitted primarily via sexual activity.<ref name="cite pmid|16950018">{{cite pmid|16950018}}</ref>

Of the 120 known human papillomaviruses, 51 species and three subtypes infect the genital mucosa.<ref>Schmitt M, Depuydt C, Benoy I, Bogers J, Antoine J, Arbyn M, Pawlita M; on behalf of the VALGENT study group (201) Prevalence and viral load of 51 genital human papillomavirus types and 3 subtypes. Int J Cancer doi: 10.1002/ijc.27891</ref> Of these 31 are considered to present a low risk of carcinogensis; 17 are considered to be high risk and 6 are of intermediate risk. 

If a college woman has at least one different partner per year for four years, the probability that she will leave college with an HPV infection is greater than 85%.<ref name=Egendorf2007>Egendorf, Laura. Sexually Transmitted Diseases (At Issue Series). New York: Greenhaven Press, 2007.</ref> Condoms do not completely protect from the virus because the areas around the genitals including the inner thigh area are not covered, thus exposing these areas to the infected person’s skin.<ref name=Egendorf2007 />

===Hands===
Studies have shown HPV transmission between hands and genitals of the same person and sexual partners. Hernandez tested the genitals and dominant hand of each person in 25 couples every other month for an average of 7 months. She found 2 couples where the man's genitals infected the woman's hand with high risk HPV, 2 where her hand infected his genitals, 1 where her genitals infected his hand, 2 each where he infected his own hand, and she infected her own hand.<ref name="Hernandez Transmission">{{cite pmid|18507898}}</ref><ref name="Hernandez App">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600292/bin/07-0616_appT-s1.pdf Appendix Table. HPV transmission events in male-female couples by anatomic site]</ref> Hands were not the main source of transmission in these 25 couples, but they were significant. 

Partridge  reports men's fingertips became positive for high risk HPV at more than half the rate (26% per 2 years) as their genitals (48%).<ref name="Giuliano Optimal">{{cite pmid|17955432}}</ref>  Winer reports 14% of fingertip samples from sexually active women were positive.<ref name="Winer Detection">{{cite pmid|20570905}}</ref> None of these studies reports whether participants were asked to wash or not wash their hands before testing.

Non-sexual hand contact seems to have little or no role in HPV transmission. Winer found all 14 fingertip samples from virgin women negative at the start of her fingertip study.<ref name="Winer Detection">{{cite pmid|20570905}}</ref> In a separate report on genital HPV infection, 1% of virgin women (1 of 76) with no sexual contact tested positive for HPV, while 10% of virgin women reporting non-penetrative sexual contact were positive (7 of 72).<ref name="Winer Genital">{{cite pmid|12543621}}</ref>

===Shared objects===
Sharing of possibly contaminated objects may transmit HPV.<ref name="pmid8849195">{{cite pmid|8849195}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|8389707}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|2256864}}</ref> Although possible, transmission by routes other than sexual intercourse is less common for female genital HPV infection.<ref name="cite pmid|16950018"/> Fingers-genital contact is a possible way of transmission but unlikely to be a significant source.<ref>{{cite pmid|10616355}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|20570905}}</ref>

===Blood===
Though it has traditionally been assumed that HPV is not transmissible via blood—as it is thought to only infect cutaneous and mucosal tissues—recent studies have called this notion into question. Historically, HPV DNA has been detected in the blood of cervical cancer patients.<ref name="KruegerStuart2010">{{cite book | author1 = Hans Krueger | author2 = Gavin Stuart | author3 = Richard Gallagher | coauthors = Dan Williams, Jon Kerner | title = HPV and Other Infectious Agents in Cancer:Opportunities for Prevention and Public Health: Opportunities for Prevention and Public Health | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=engBMqjQ6SQC&pg=PA34 | accessdate = 24 December 2012 | date = 12 April 2010 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-973291-3 | page = 34}}</ref> In 2005, a group reported that, in frozen blood samples of 57 sexually naive pediatric patients who had [[vertical transmission|vertical]] or [[transfusion transmitted infection|transfusion-acquired]] HIV infection, 8 (14.0%) of these samples also tested positive for HPV-16.<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal | author = Bodaghi S, Wood LV, Roby G, Ryder C, Steinberg SM, Zheng ZM | title = Could human papillomaviruses be spread through blood? | journal = J.

However, as non-sexual transmission of HPV by other means is not uncommon, this could not be definitively proven.

As such, it remains to be determined whether HPV can or cannot be transmitted via blood.<ref name="KruegerStuart2010" /> This is of concern, as blood donations are not currently screened for HPV, and at least some organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]] and other Red Cross societies do not presently appear to disallow HPV-positive individuals from donating blood.<ref name="RedCross 2012">{{cite web | title = Eligibility Criteria by Topic - American Red Cross | url = http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-topic}}</ref>

HPV infection is limited to the [[basal cell]]s of [[Epithelium#Stratified epithelium|stratified epithelium]], the only tissue in which they replicate.<ref name="mechanism">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ygyno.2010.04.004 }}</ref> The virus cannot bind to live tissue; instead, it infects [[epithelial]] tissues through micro-abrasions or other epithelial trauma that exposes segments of the [[basement membrane]].<ref name="mechanism"/> The infectious process is slow, taking 12–24 hours for initiation of transcription. It is believed that involved antibodies play a major neutralizing role while the [[virion]]s still reside on the basement membrane and cell surfaces.<ref name="mechanism"/>

HPV lesions are thought to arise from the proliferation of infected basal [[keratinocytes]]. Infection typically occurs when basal cells in the host are exposed to infectious virus through a disturbed epithelial barrier as would occur during sexual intercourse or after minor skin abrasions. HPV infections have not been shown to be [[cytolytic]]; rather, viral particles are released as a result of degeneration of desquamating cells. The HPV virus can survive for many months and at low temperatures without a host; therefore, an individual with plantar warts can spread the virus by walking barefoot.<ref name=EMed>{{EMedicine|article|219110|Human Papillomavirus}}</ref>

HPV is a small DNA virus with a genome of approximately 8000 base pairs.<ref name="Scheurer_2005">{{cite journal|last=Scheurer|first=M. E.|coauthors=Torlorero-Luna, G.; Adler-Storthz, K.|title=Human papillomavirus infection: biology, epidemiology, and prevention|journal=International Journal of Gynecological Cancer|year=2005|volume=15|pages=727–746}}</ref> The HPV life cycle strictly follows the differentiation program of the host [[keratinocyte]]. It is thought that the HPV [[virion]] infects [[epithelial]] tissues through micro-abrasions, whereby the virion associates with putative receptors such as alpha [[integrin]]s and [[laminin]]s, leading to entry of the virions into [[basal lamina|basal]] epithelial cells through [[clathrin]]-[[receptor-mediated endocytosis|mediated endocytosis]] and/or [[caveolin]]-mediated endocytosis depending on the type of HPV. At this point, the viral [[genome]] is transported to the nucleus by unknown mechanisms and establishes itself at a copy number between 10-200 viral genomes per cell. A sophisticated [[transcription (genetics)|transcriptional cascade]] then occurs as the host keratinocyte begins to divide and become increasingly differentiated in the upper layers of the epithelium.

The phylogeny of the various strains of HPV generally reflects the migration patterns of Homo sapiens, and suggests that HPV may have diversified along with the human population. Studies suggest that HPV evolved along five major branches that reflect the ethnicity of human hosts, and diversified along with the human population.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Z.|coauthors=Schiffman, M.; Herrero, R.; Dessalle, R.; Anastos, K.; Segondy, M.; Sahasrabuddhe, V.

===E6/E7 proteins===
The two primary oncoproteins of high risk HPV types are E6 and E7. The “E” designation indicates that these two proteins are expressed early in the HPV life cycle, while the "L" designation indicates late expression.<ref name="Ault_2006" /> The HPV genome is composed of six early (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) ORFs, two late (L1 and L2) ORFs, and a non-coding long control region (LCR).<ref name="Ganguly">{{cite pmid|19430123}}</ref> After the host cell is infected viral early promoter is activated and a polycistronic primary RNA containing all six early ORFs is transcribed. This polycistronic RNA then undergoes active RNA splicing to generate multiple isoforms of mRNAs.<ref name="Zheng">{{ cite pmid|16720315}}</ref> One of the spliced isoform RNAs, E6*I, serves as an E7 mRNA to translate E7 protein.<ref name="Tang">{{cite pmid|16611884}}</ref> However, viral early transcription subjects to viral E2 regulation and high E2 levels repress the transcription. HPV genomes integrate into host genome by disruption of E2 ORF, preventing E2 repression on E6 and E7. Thus, viral genome integration into host DNA genome increases E6 and E7 expression to promote cellular proliferation and the chance of malignancy. The degree to which E6 and E7 are expressed is correlated with the type of cervical lesion that can ultimately develop.<ref name="Scheurer_2005" />

;Role in cancer
The E6/E7 proteins inactivate two tumor suppressor proteins, [[p53]] (inactivated by E6) and [[pRb]] (inactivated by E7).<ref name="anil">{{cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Anil|coauthors=Maura L. Gillison|title=Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, and Prevention of Head and Neck Cancer|editor=Andrew F. Olshan |publisher=Springer|location=New York|date=March 4, 2010|edition=1st |chapter=Human Papillomavirus and Head and Neck Cancer |isbn=978-1-4419-1471-2|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q676132t254373n5/}}</ref>
The viral [[oncogene]]s E6 and E7<ref>{{cite pmid|12445661}}</ref> are thought to modify the cell cycle so as to retain the differentiating host keratinocyte in a state that is favourable to the amplification of viral genome replication and consequent late gene expression. E6 in association with host E6-associated protein, which has ubiquitin ligase activity, acts to ubiquitinate p53, leading to its proteosomal degradation. E7 (in oncogenic HPVs) acts as the primary transforming protein. E7 competes for [[retinoblastoma protein]] (pRb) binding, freeing the transcription factor [[E2F]] to transactivate its targets, thus pushing the cell cycle forward. All HPV can induce transient proliferation, but only strains 16 and 18 can immortalize cell lines ''in vitro''. It has also been shown that HPV 16 and 18 cannot immortalize primary [[rat]] cells alone; there needs to be activation of the [[ras (protein)|ras]] oncogene. In the upper layers of the host epithelium, the late genes L1 and L2 are transcribed/translated and serve as structural proteins that encapsidate the amplified viral genomes. Once the genome is encapsidated, the capsid appears to undergo a redox-dependent assembly/maturation event, which is tied to a natural redox gradient that spans both suprabasal and cornified epithelial tissue layers. This assembly/maturation event stabilizes virions, and increases their specific infectivity.<ref>

=== E2 Research ===
Human Papillomaviruses are DNA viruses that cause skin lesions [[keratinocytes]]. There are two categories of HPVs, high and low risk. High-risk papillomaviruses are HPVs-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 55, 58, and 59, which are often found on cancer cells. HPVs that produce skin lesions are low risk HPVs, but HPV-6 and HPV-11 are associated with genital warts. The mechanism of infection of these viruses has been widely researched, particularly the [[oncogene]] protein [[Papillomaviridae]] E2/E1 and E6/E7, since they are considered the essential part for the development of cancer cells.<ref name="Hou.et. al. 2002">{{cite journal|last=Hou|first=Samuel Y|coauthors=Shwu-Yuan Wu, and Cheng-Ming Chiang|title=Transcriptional Activity among High and Low Risk Human Papillomavirus E2 Proteins Correlates with E2 DNA Binding|journal=Journal of Biologycal Chemistry|year=2002|volume=277|pages=45619–45629|doi=10.1074/jbc.M206829200|issue=47}}</ref> 

In a recent study, 99.7% of one thousand cases of invasive cervical cancer were HPV positive to HPV16, being the most common followed by HPV-18 DNA. High Risk HPV E6 and E7 are more active than E2 in cellular [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] than low risk HPVs.<ref name="Hou.et. al. 2002" /> The oncogenes E7 and E6 have been found to change Keratinocytes by altering their cell cycle. E6 binds to [[P53]] and degrades it preventing cell death [[apoptosis]] and promoting the [[DNA replication|replication]] of viral DNA. P53 is a repair mechanism that destroys any abnormal cells or arrests the cell cycle. Genetic changes in the DNA, such as, the introduction of viral DNA, which transforms and destabilizes the cell. Additional research has been performed in the apoptotic effects of papillomavirus E2. The research findings that the E2 protein in [[HeLa]] cells induce p53, causing arrest of the cell cycle and apoptosis. But, the induce p53 accumulation was not correlated to the cell growth arrest at [[G1 phase]]. This suggests that apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are independent of each other.<ref name="Hou.et. al. 2002" /><ref name=Desaintes,1999>{{cite journal|last=Desaintes|first=Christian|coauthors=Sylvain Goyat, Serge Garbay, Moshe Yaniv and FrancË oise Thierry|title=Papillomavirus E2 induces p53-independent apoptosis in HeLa cells|journal=Oncogene|year=1999|issue=18|pages=4538±4545|url=http://www.nature.com/onc/journal/v18/n32/abs/1202818a.htm|accessdate=22 march 2012|doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1202818|volume=18}}</ref> Researchers used biochemical and genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that apoptosis by BPVI and HPV18 E2 proteins in HeLa cells is independent of p53.

A comparative research study was conducted to study the transcription activity of high and low risk papillomaviruse E2 protein and affinity of the E2 binding regions of high and low risk HPVs. The study used protein encoded in HPV 16, HPV18, and HPV11 and Bovine -1, along with comparative DNA binding shift assays, cell free transcription systems, [[Cofactors and coenzymes|cofactors]], to determine the affinity the oncoprotein E2 of both types of HPVs.<ref name="Hou.et. al. 2002" /> The BPV1 has been used to model the replication of papillomaviruse.

The less efficient E6/E7 oncoproteins are expressed all lower levels in low risks HPVs. The regulation of the E6 promoter of the high risk E2 protein of the HPVs can lead to the development of cancer due to the viral integration.<ref name="Hou.et. al. 2002" /><ref name=Desaintes,1999 />

===Latency period===
Once an HPV virion invades a cell, an active infection occurs, and the virus can be transmitted. Several months to years may elapse before squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) develop and can be clinically detected. The time from active infection to clinically detectable disease may make it difficult for epidemiologists to establish which partner was the source of infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Richard A.|title=Human Papillomavirus: Confronting the Epidemic—A Urologist's Perspective|journal=Reviews in Urology|year=2005|volume=7|issue=3|pmc=1477576|pmid=16985824|pages=135–44}}</ref>

===Clearance===
Most HPV infections are cleared up by most people without medical action or consequences. The table provides data for high-risk types (i.e. the types found in cancers).

Clearing an infection does not always create immunity if there is a new or continuing source of infection. Hernandez' 2005-6 study of 25 couples reports "A number of instances indicated apparent reinfection [from partner] after viral clearance."<ref name="Hernandez Transmission"/>

==Prevention==
<!-- anchor — linked to from CIN -->

HPV infection is the most frequent [[sexually transmitted disease]] in the world.<ref>{{cite pmid|20189438}}</ref> Methods of prevention include abstinence, [[condom]]s, [[vaccination]] and microbicides.

===Vaccines===
{{Main|HPV vaccine}}

Two vaccines are available to prevent infection by some HPV types: [[Gardasil]], marketed by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]], and [[Cervarix]], marketed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. Both protect against initial infection with HPV types 16 and 18, which cause most of the HPV associated cancer cases. Gardasil also protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause 90% of genital warts.

The vaccines provide little benefit to women having already been infected with HPV types 16 and 18, which includes most sexually active females{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. For this reason, the vaccine is recommended primarily for those women not yet having been exposed to HPV during sex. The [[World Health Organization]] position paper on HPV vaccination clearly outlines appropriate, cost-effective strategies for using HPV vaccine in public sector programs.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Human papillomavirus vaccines. WHO position paper |journal=Wkly. Epidemiol. Rec. |volume=84 |issue=15 |pages=118–31 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19360985 |url=http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8415.pdf |format=PDF |author1=}}</ref>

Both vaccines are delivered in three shots over six months. In most countries, they are approved only for female use, but are approved for male use in countries like USA and UK. The vaccine does not have any therapeutic effect on existing HPV infections or cervical lesions.<ref name=CDC_gardasil_reccomendations/> In 2010, 49% of teenage girls in the US got the HPV vaccine, while in comparison around two-thirds of teens received shots for [[meningitis]] and [[DPT vaccine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=720725&publicationSubCategoryId=200 |title=Teen vaccinations against cervical cancer lagging |date=August 26, 2011}}</ref>

Women should continue to seek cervical screening, such as Pap smear testing, even after receiving the vaccine. Cervical cancer screening recommendations have not changed for females who receive HPV vaccine.<ref name=CDC_gardasil_reccomendations>{{cite journal |author=Markowitz LE, Dunne EF, Saraiya M, Lawson HW, Chesson H, Unger ER |title=Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) |journal=MMWR Recomm Rep |volume=56 |issue=RR–2 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17380109 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5602a1.htm |chapter=Cervical Cancer Screening Among Vaccinated Females |pages=1–24 [17]}}</ref> Without continued screening, the number of cervical cancers preventable by vaccination alone is less than the number of cervical cancers prevented by regular screening alone.<ref name="harperreview"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marcia-g-yerman/an-interview-with-dr-dian_b_405472.html|title=An Interview with Dr. Diane M.

===Condoms===
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] says that male "[[condom]] use may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection" but provides a lesser degree of protection compared with other sexual transmitted diseases "because HPV also may be transmitted by exposure to areas (e.g., infected skin or mucosal surfaces) that are not covered or protected by the condom."<ref>

===Cervical testing===
In March 2003, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a test manufactured by [[Qiagen]]/Digene,<ref>[http://www1.qiagen.com/Products/digeneHPVTesthc2.aspx Digene HPV HC2 DNA Test] Qiagen HPV test</ref> which is a "hybrid-capture" test<ref>

According to the National Cancer Institute, "testing samples of cervical cells is an effective way to identify high-risk types of HPV that may be present. The FDA has approved an HPV test as a follow-up for women who have an ambiguous Pap test and, for women over the age of 30, for general cervical cancer screening. This HPV test can identify at least 13 of the high-risk types of HPV associated with the development of cervical cancer. The test can detect high-risk types of HPV even before there are any conclusive visible changes to the cervical cells."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/risk/HPV |title=National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet |publisher=Cancer.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>

The recent outcomes in the identification of molecular pathways involved in cervical cancer provide helpful information about novel bio- or oncogenic markers that allow monitoring of these essential molecular events in cytological smears, histological, or cytological specimens. These bio- or onco- markers are likely to improve the detection of lesions that have a high risk of progression in both primary screening and triage settings. E6 and E7 mRNA detection PreTect HPV-Proofer, ([[HPV OncoTect]]) or p16 cell-cycle protein levels are examples of these new molecular markers. According to published results, these markers, which are highly sensitive and specific, allow to identify cells going through malignant transformation.<ref>

In October  2011 the US Food and Drug Administration approved the Aptima HPV Assay test for RNA created when and if any HPV strains start creating cancers (see virology).<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm278520.htm FDA approval of APTIMA HPV Assay - P100042]</ref><ref name="Dockter Clinical">{{cite pmid|19651370}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gen-probe.com/news/PressReleaseText.asp?compid=135117&releaseID=1623562 FDA Approves Gen-Probe's Aptima HPV Assay]</ref>

The vulva/vagina has been sampled with Dacron swabs and shows more HPV than the cervix. Among women who were HPV positive in either place, 90% were positive in the vulvovaginal region, 46% in the cervix.<ref name="Winer Genital"/>

===Oral testing===
In February 2010 Quest Diagnostics released OraRisk, a test to identify which HPV types are present in saliva.<ref>[http://www.adha.org/publications/strive/11-2011-strive.htm Posorski, “Oral Cancer Screening and Diagnostic Techniques” in  ADHA Strive, Nov 2011]</ref><ref>[http://www.oraldna.com/pdf/PR-OralDNA-OraRiskHPV-26feb2010.pdf OralDNA Labs Introduces OraRisk]</ref>

Saliva was positive for HPV in Iran in 41% of 22 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, and in 25% of 20 people without cancer.<ref name="SahebJamee">{{cite pmid|19680210}}</ref>  Studies have found heightened HPV in mouth cell samples from people with oral squamous cell carcinoma.<ref name="Syrjanen">{{cite pmid|21382139}}</ref> Studies have not found significant HPV in mouth cells after sampling with toothbrushes (5 of 2,619 samples)<ref name="Winer Genital"/> and cytobrushes (no oral transmission found).<ref name="Hernandez Transmission"/>

===Testing men===
Research studies have tested for and found HPV, including high-risk types (i.e. the types found in cancers), on fingers, mouth, saliva, anus, urethra, urine, semen, blood, scrotum and penis. However most research tests have used Dacron swabs and custom analysis not available to the general public.<ref name="Dunne">{{cite pmid|16991079}}</ref>

A Brazilian study used the readily available Qiagen/Digene test mentioned above ([[Off-label use|off label]]) to test men's penis, scrotum and anus.<ref name="Nicolau"/> Each of the 50 men had been a partner for at least 6 months of a woman who was positive for high risk HPV. They found high risk HPV on 60% of these men, primarily the penis. "The specimens were obtained using a vigorous motion of the conical brush included in the Digene kit" "after spraying the anogenital region with saline solution."<ref name="Nicolau">{{cite pmid|15708032}}</ref>

A slightly different method also used cytobrushes (but custom lab analysis) and found 37% of 582 Mexican army recruits positive for high risk HPV.<ref name="Aguilar">{{cite pmid|16461598}}</ref> They were told not to wash genitals for 12 hours before sampling. (Other studies are silent on washing, a particular gap in studies of hands). They included the urethra as well as scrotum and penis, but the urethra added less than 1% to the HPV rate. Studies like this led Giuliano to recommend sampling the glans, shaft and crease between them and scrotum, since sampling the urethra or anus added very little to diagnosis.<ref name="Giuliano Optimal">{{cite pmid|17955432}}</ref> Dunne recommends glans, shaft, their crease, and foreskin.<ref name="Dunne"/>

A small study of cytobrushes on 10 US men where the brush was wet, rather than the skin, found 2 of 10 men were positive for HPV (type not reported).<ref name="Weaver">{{cite pmid|14767822}}</ref>  Their lab analysis was not the same as either study above. This small study found 4 of 10 men positive for HPV when skin was rubbed with 600 grit emery paper, then swabbed with a wet Dacron swab. Since emery paper and brush were analyzed together at the lab, it is not known if the emery paper collected viruses or loosened them for the swab to collect.

Studies have found collection by men from their own skin (with emery paper and Dacron swabs) as effective as by a clinician, sometimes more so, since patients were more willing to scrape vigorously.<ref name="Hernandez Comparison">{{cite pmid|16455906}}</ref><ref name="Ogilvie">{{cite pmid|19066196}}</ref><ref name="Petignat">Women had similar success in self-sampling, using tampons, swabs, cytobrush and lavage. {{cite pmid|17335880}}</ref>

Other studies analyzed urine, semen and blood and found varying amounts of HPV,<ref name="Dunne"/> but there is no publicly available test for them.

There is not a wide range of tests even though HPV is common. Clinicians depend on the vaccine among young people and high clearance rates (see Clearance subsection in Virology) to create a low risk of disease and mortality, and treat the cancers when they appear. Others believe that reducing HPV infection in more men and women, even when it has no symptoms, is important (herd immunity) to prevent more cancers rather than just treating them.<ref name="Burchell Modeling">{{cite pmid|16421235}}</ref><ref name="Kim">{{cite pmid|17955427}}</ref> Where tests are used, negative test results show safety from transmission, and positive test results show where shielding (condoms, gloves) is needed to prevent transmission until the infection clears.<ref>[http://www.thehpvtest.com/about-hpv/faqs-for-men/#Should-you-stop-having-sex-with-your-partner-if-she-finds-out Digene faqs for men]</ref>

Genital warts are the only visible sign of low-risk genital HPV, and can be identified with a visual check. These visible growths, however, are the result of non-carcinogenic HPV types. Five percent acetic acid (vinegar) is used to identify both warts and squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (SIL) lesions with limited success{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} by causing abnormal tissue to appear white, but most doctors have found this technique helpful only in moist areas, such as the female genital tract.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} At this time, HPV test for males are used only in research.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Epidemiology==

===Cutaneous HPVs===
Infection with cutaneous HPVs is ubiquitous.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Antonsson A, Forslund O, Ekberg H, Sterner G, Hansson BG |title=The ubiquity and impressive genomic diversity of human skin papillomaviruses suggest a commensalic nature of these viruses |journal=J. Virol. |volume=74 |issue=24 |pages=11636–41 |year=2000 |pmid=11090162|doi=10.1128/JVI.74.24.11636-11641.2000 |pmc=112445}}</ref> Some HPV types, such as HPV-5, may establish infections that persist for the lifetime of the individual without ever manifesting any clinical symptoms. Other cutaneous HPVs, such as HPV types 1 or 2, may cause common warts in some infected individuals.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Skin warts are most common in childhood and typically appear and regress spontaneously over the course of weeks to months. About 10% of adults also suffer from recurring skin warts.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} All HPVs are believed to be capable of establishing long-term "latent" infections in small numbers of [[stem cell]]s present in the skin. Although these latent infections may never be fully eradicated, immunological control is thought to block the appearance of symptoms such as warts. Immunological control is HPV type-specific, meaning that an individual may become resistant to one HPV type while remaining susceptible to other types.

===Lung cancer===
There has been evidence linking HPV to benign and malignant tumors of the upper respiratory tract. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have found that people with lung cancer were significantly more likely to have several high-risk forms of HPV antibodies compared to those who did not have lung cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lung Cancer Risk Rises in the Presence of HPV Antibodies|url=http://www.aacr.org/home/public--media/aacr-in-the-news.aspx?d=2328|work=Lung Cancer Risk Rises in the Presence of HPV Antibodies}}</ref> Researchers looking for HPV among 1,633 lung cancer patients and 2,729 people without the lung disease found that people with lung cancer had more types of HPV than non-cancer patients did, and among lung cancer patients, the chances of having eight types of serious HPV were significantly increased.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lung Cancer Patients More Likely to Have High-Risk Human Papillomavirus|url=http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/display/NewsDisplay.asp?NewsNbr=57349|work=NPIN}}</ref> In addition, there has been expression of HPV structural proteins by immunohistochemistry and in vitro studies that suggests HPV presence in bronchial cancer and its precursor lesions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Syrjänen|first=K|coauthors=Syrjänen, S, Kellokoski, J, Kärjä, J, Mäntyjärvi, R|title=Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 6 and 16 DNA sequences in bronchial squamous cell carcinomas demonstrated by in situ DNA hybridization|journal=Lung|year=1989|volume=167|issue=1|pages=33–42|pmid=2537916|doi=10.1007/BF02714928}}</ref> Another study detected HPV in the EBC, bronchial brushing and neoplastic lung tissue of cases, and found a presence of an HPV infection in 16.4% of the subjects affected by non-small cell lung cancer, but in none of the controls.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carpagnano|first=GE|coauthors=Koutelou, A, Natalicchio, MI, Martinelli, D, Ruggieri, C, Di Taranto, A, Antonetti, R, Carpagnano, F, Foschino-Barbaro, MP|title=HPV in exhaled breath condensate of lung cancer patients|journal=British journal of cancer|date=2011-10-11|volume=105|issue=8|pages=1183–90|pmid=21952627|doi=10.1038/bjc.2011.354|pmc=3208494}}</ref> The reported average frequencies of HPV in lung cancers were 17% and 15% in Europe and the America, respectively, and the mean number of HPV in Asian lung cancer samples was 35.7%, with a considerable heterogeneity between certain countries and regions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=F|coauthors=Amin Kotb, WF, Petersen, I|title=Incidence of human papilloma virus in lung cancer|journal=Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)|date=2009 Jul|volume=65|issue=1|pages=13–8|pmid=19019488|doi=10.1016/j.lungcan.2008.10.003}}</ref>

In recent years, the United States has experienced an increase in the number of cases of throat cancer caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) Type 16. Throat cancers associated with HPV have been estimated to have increased from 0.8 cases per 100,000 people in 1988 to 2.6 per 100,000 in 2004.<ref name="pmid21969503">{{cite journal |author=Chaturvedi AK |title=Human Papillomavirus and Rising Oropharyngeal Cancer Incidence in the United States |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology : Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology |volume= 29|issue= 32|pages= 4294–301|year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21969503 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2011.36.4596 |url= |pmc=3221528 |author-separator=, |author2=Engels EA |author3=Pfeiffer RM |display-authors=3 |last4=Hernandez |first4=B.

===Genital HPVs===
A large increase in the incidence of genital HPV infection occurs at the age when individuals begin to engage in sexual activity. The great majority of genital HPV infections never cause any overt symptoms and are cleared by the immune system in a matter of months. As with cutaneous HPVs, immunity is believed to be HPV type-specific. Some infected individuals may fail to bring genital HPV infection under immunological control.

==History==
In 1972, the association of the human papilloma viruses with [[skin cancer]] in [[epidermodysplasia verruciformis]] was proposed by [[Stefania Jabłońska]] in Poland. In 1978, Jabłońska and Gerard Orth at the [[Pasteur Institute]] discovered HPV-5 in [[skin cancer]].<ref>{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Human papillomaviruses |trans_title= |url= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2007 |month= |origyear= |publisher=World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer |location= |language= |isbn=978-92-832-1290-4 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |trans_chapter= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}</ref> In 1976 [[Harald zur Hausen]] published the hypothesis that human papilloma virus plays an important role in the cause of [[cervical cancer]].
