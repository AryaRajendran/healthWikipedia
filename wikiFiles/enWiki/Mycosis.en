A '''mycosis''' (plural: '''mycoses''') is a [[fungal]] [[infection]] of animals, including humans.<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:mycosis">{{cite web |url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/five/000069303.htm |title=Dorlands Medical Dictionary:mycosis |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Mycoses are common and a variety of environmental and physiological conditions can contribute to the development of fungal diseases. Inhalation of fungal [[spore]]s or localized colonization of the [[skin]] may initiate persistent infections; therefore, mycoses often start in the [[lungs]] or on the skin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fungalinfections.us/| title=What Is a Fungal Infection?|date=|accessdate= May 26, 2010}}</ref>

==Causes==
People are at risk of fungal infections when they are taking strong [[antibiotics]] for a long period of time because antibiotics kill not only damaging [[bacteria]], but healthy bacteria as well. This alters the balance of microorganisms in the [[mouth]], [[vagina]], [[intestines]] and other places in the body, and results in an overgrowth of fungus.
 
Individuals with weakened [[immune system]]s are also at risk of developing fungal infections. This is the case of people with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], people under [[steroid]] treatments, and people taking [[chemotherapy]].  People with [[diabetes]] also tend to develop fungal infections. Very young and very old people, also, are groups at risk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/f/fungal_infections/intro.htm| title=Fungal infections: Introduction|date=|accessdate= May 26, 2010}}</ref>

==Classification==
Mycoses are classified according to the [[Biological tissue|tissue]] levels initially colonized.

===Superficial mycoses===
Superficial mycoses are limited to the outermost layers of the skin and hair. 

An example of such a fungal infection is [[Tinea versicolor]], a fungus infection that commonly affects the skin of young people, especially the chest, back, and upper arms and legs. Tinea versicolor is caused by a fungus that lives in the skin of some adults. It does not usually affect the face. This fungus produces spots that are either lighter than the skin or a reddish-brown. This fungus exists in two forms, one of them causing visible spots. Factors that can cause the fungus to become more visible include high humidity, as well as immune or hormone abnormalities. However, almost all people with this very common condition are healthy.

===Cutaneous mycoses===
Cutaneous mycoses extend deeper into the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], and also include invasive hair and nail diseases. These diseases are restricted to the keratinized layers of the skin, hair, and nails. Unlike the superficial mycoses, host immune responses may be evoked resulting in pathologic changes expressed in the deeper layers of the skin. The organisms that cause these diseases are called [[dermatophyte]]s. The resulting diseases are often called [[ringworm]] (even though there is no worm involved) or [[tinea]].  Cutaneous mycoses are caused by ''[[Microsporum]]'', ''[[Trichophyton]]'', and ''[[Epidermophyton]]'' fungi, which together comprise 41 species.

One common disease is the [[athlete's foot]] which most commonly affects men and children before [[puberty]]. It is divided in three categories: chronic interdigital athlete's foot, chronic scaly athlete's foot, and acute vesicular athlete's foot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dermatology.about.com/cs/fungalinfections/a/athletesfoot.htm| title=Athlete's Foot|date=|accessdate= May 26, 2010}}</ref>

===Subcutaneous mycoses===
Subcutaneous mycoses involve the dermis, subcutaneous tissues, muscle and fascia. These infections are chronic and can be initiated by piercing trauma to the skin which allows the fungi to enter. These infections are difficult to treat and may require surgical interventions such as [[debridement]].

===Systemic mycoses due to primary pathogens===
Systemic mycoses due to primary pathogens originate primarily in the [[lung]]s and may spread to many organ systems. Organisms that cause systemic mycoses are inherently virulent. In general primary pathogens that cause systemic mycoses are [[Phenotypic dimorphism|dimorphic]].

===Systemic mycoses due to opportunistic pathogens===
Systemic mycoses due to opportunistic pathogens are infections of patients with immune deficiencies who would otherwise not be infected. Examples of immunocompromised conditions include [[AIDS]], alteration of normal flora by antibiotics, [[immunosuppressive therapy]], and [[metastatic cancer]]. Examples of opportunistic mycoses include [[Candidiasis]], [[Cryptococcosis]] and [[Aspergillosis]].

==Treatment==
[[Antifungal drug]]s are used to treat mycoses. Depending on the nature of the infection, a topical or systemic agent may be used. [[Photochemotherapy]] or [[photopheresis]] is a technique used at  medical centers for the treatment of mycosis fungoides.

An example of antifungal is [[fluconazole]], or [[Diflucan]], which is the basis of many [[over-the-counter]] antifungal treatments. Another example is  [[amphotericin B]] (the A form being toxic) which is more potent. It is used in the treatment of the most severe fungal infections that show resistance to other forms of treatment  and it is administered [[intravenously]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/family/mycosisfungusi_syfq.htm| title=What is a mycosis? causes, symptoms and treatments|date=|accessdate= May 26, 2010}}</ref>

Drugs to treat skin infections are Tolnaftate ([[Tinactin]]), an over the counter topical; [[Ketoconazole]], especially used to treat tinea versicolor and other dermatophytes; [[Itraconazole]]; Terbinafine ([[Lamisil]]); [[Echinocandins]] (caspofungin); [[Griseofulvin]], commonly used for infections involving the scalp and nails.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mycology/mycology-4.htm| title=Therapy|date=|accessdate= May 26, 2010}}</ref> 

Yeast infections in the vagina, caused by [[candida albicans]], can be treated with medicated suppositories such as [[tioconazole]] and  pessaries whereas skin yeast infections are treated with medicated ointments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/fungal-infections-skin?page=3| title=How Are Yeast Infections Treated?|date=|accessdate= May 26, 2010}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Keeping the skin clean and dry, as well as maintaining good [[hygiene]], will help larger topical mycoses. Because fungal infections are contagious, it is important to wash after touching other people or animals. Sports clothing should also be washed after use.
