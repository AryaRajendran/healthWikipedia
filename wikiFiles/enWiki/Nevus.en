'''Nevus''' (or '''naevus''', plural '''nevi''' or '''naevi''', from ''n√¶vus'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for "[[birthmark]]") is the medical term for sharply circumscribed<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000072214|nevus}}</ref> and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[lesion]]s of the [[skin]]. These lesions are commonly named '''birthmarks'''. Nevi are [[benign tumor|benign]] by definition. However, 50% of malignant melanomas (a skin cancer) arise from pre-existing nevi.<ref>{{cite book |last= Sam |first= Amir H. |coauthors= James T.H. Teo |title= [[Rapid Medicine]] |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 2010 |isbn= 1405183233}}</ref> Using the term nevus and nevi loosely, most physicians and dermatologists are actually referring to a variant of nevus called the "[[melanocytic nevus]]", which are composed of [[melanocyte]]s. Histologically, melanocytic nevi are differentiated from [[lentigo|lentigines]] (also a type of benign pigmented [[macule]]) by the presence of nests of melanocytes, which lentigines (plural form of lentigo) lack.

==Classification==
[[epidermis (skin)|Epidermal]] nevi are derived from [[keratinocyte]]s or derivatives of keratinocytes. [[Connective tissue]] nevi are derived from connective tissue cells like [[adipocyte]]s and [[fibroblasts]]. [[vascular tissue|Vascular]] nevi are derived from structures of the blood vessels. ''See [[birthmark]] for a more complete discussion''

===Melanocytic nevus===
{{main|Melanocytic nevus}}
*[[Congenital nevus]]: a melanocytic nevus present at birth or near birth.
*Acquired melanocytic nevus: a melanocytic nevus acquired later in life, and not at or near birth.  Most melanocytic nevi are of the acquired variety.
*Melanocytic nevus (nevomelanocytic nevus, nevocellular nevus): benign proliferation of [[melanocyte]]s, the skin cells that make the brown pigment [[melanin]]. Hence, most nevi are brown to black. They are very common; almost all adults have at least one, usually more. They may be [[congenital]] or acquired (usually at puberty).
*[[Dysplastic nevus]]: usually an acquired melanocytic nevus with abnormal features making it difficult to distinguish from a [[melanoma]].  It can be a marker for an individual at risk for developing melanomas.

===Epidermal nevus===
* Epidermal nevus: congenital, flesh-colored, raised or warty, often linear lesion, usually on the upper half of the body.
* [[Nevus sebaceus]]: variant of epidermal nevus on the scalp presenting as a hairless, fleshy or yellowish area.

===Connective tissue nevus===
* Connective tissue nevus: fleshy, deep nodules. Rare.

===Vascular nevus===
* [[Hemangioma]] (strawberry mark or nevus).

== Diagnosis of nevi ==
[[Image:Dermatoscope1.JPG|thumb|A [[dermatoscope]]]]
[[Image:Dermatoscope.jpg|thumb|A modern polarized dermatoscope]]
Clinical diagnosis of a melanocytic nevus from other nevi can be made with the naked eye using the [[ABCD guideline]], or using [[dermatoscopy]].  The main concern is distinguishing between a benign nevus, a [[dysplastic nevus]], and a [[melanoma]].  Other skin tumors can resemble a melanocytic nevus clinically, such as a [[seborrheic keratosis]], pigmented [[basal cell cancer]], [[hemangiomas]], and [[sebaceous hyperplasia]].  A [[skin biopsy]] is required when clinical diagnosis is inadequate or when malignancy is suspected.

== Normal evolution or maturation of melanocytic nevi ==

All melanocytic nevi will change with time - both congenital and acquired nevi.  The "normal" maturation is evident as elevation of the lesion from a flat macule to a raised papule.  The color change occurs as the melanocytes clump and migrate from the surface of the skin (epidermis) down deep into the dermis.  The color will change from even brown, to speckled brown, and then losing the color and becomes flesh colored or pink.  During the evolution, uneven migration can make the nevi look like melanomas, and [[dermatoscopy]] can help in differentiation between the benign and malignant lesions.<ref>[http://www.pathologyresources.com/AFIP/melanocytic/chap02.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>
