Symptoms occur in over 90% of people withdrawing from a long-term [[opioid]] (such as [[heroin]] habit){{citation needed|date=June 2011}}, three-quarters of persons recovering from long-term use of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[methamphetamine]], or [[benzodiazepines]] and to a lesser degree other [[psychotropic]] drugs{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome as a result of [[GABA]]-[[agonist]] (benzodiazepine, barbiturate, ethanol) dependence and opioid dependence can last from a year to several decades, or indefinitely, with the symptoms entering into periods of relative remission between periods of instability{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}. Symptoms include [[mood swing]]s resembling an [[affective disorder]], [[anhedonia]] (the inability to feel pleasure from anything beyond use of the drug), [[insomnia]], extreme drug craving and obsession, [[anxiety]] and [[panic attacks]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicidal ideation]] and [[suicide]] and general [[cognitive]] impairment.

==Background==
Drug abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs, can induce symptomatology which resembles mental illness. This can occur both in the intoxicated state and during the [[withdrawal]] state. In some cases these substance induced psychiatric disorders can persist long after detoxification, such as prolonged psychosis or [[major depression|depression]] after amphetamine or cocaine abuse. A protracted withdrawal syndrome can also occur with symptoms persisting for months after cessation of use. [[Benzodiazepines]] are the most notable drug for inducing prolonged withdrawal effects with symptoms sometimes persisting for years after cessation of use. Severe anxiety and depression are commonly induced by sustained alcohol abuse which in most cases abates with prolonged abstinence. Even moderate alcohol sustained use may increase anxiety and depression levels in some individuals. In most cases these drug induced psychiatric disorders fade away with prolonged abstinence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Katie |last2=Sullivan |first2=Michael J. |title=Dual Diagnosis: Counseling the Mentally Ill Substance Abuser |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lvUzR0obihEC |edition=2nd |date=1 March 2001 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-446-8 |pages=75–76 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}</ref>

==Cause==
The syndrome may be in part due to persisting physiological adaptions in the central nervous system manifested in the form of continuing but slowly reversible [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], disturbances in [[neurotransmitters]] and resultant hyperexcitability of neuronal pathways.<ref>{{cite journal | author =Rimondini R | coauthors=Sommer WH, Dall'Olio R, Heilig M | year =2008 | month=March | title =Long-lasting tolerance to alcohol following a history of dependence | journal =Addict Biol | volume =13 | issue =1 | pages =26–30 | pmid =17850416 | doi =10.1111/j.1369-1600.2007.00079.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author =Ahveninen J |coauthors=Jääskeläinen IP, Pekkonen E, Hallberg A, Hietanen M, Näätänen R, Sillanaukee P | date = June 8, 1999 |  title =Post-withdrawal changes in middle-latency auditory evoked potentials in abstinent human alcoholics | journal =Neurosci Lett | volume =268 | issue =2 | pages =57–60 | pmid =10400077 | doi =10.1016/S0304-3940(99)00378-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Kiefer F |coauthors=Andersohn F, Jahn H, Wolf K, Raedler TJ, Wiedemann K | year=2002 | month=January | title=Involvement of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in protracted alcohol withdrawal | journal =Acta Psychiatr Scand | volume=105 | issue=1 | pages=65–70 | pmid=12086228 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0447.2002.0_011.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Bruijnzeel AW |coauthors=Gold MS | year=2005 | month=November | title=The role of corticotropin-releasing factor-like peptides in cannabis, nicotine, and alcohol dependence | journal=Brain Res Brain Res Rev | volume=49 | issue=3 | pages=505–28 | pmid=16269317 | doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2005.01.007 }}</ref> Stressful situations arise in early recovery, and the symptoms of post acute withdrawal syndrome produce further distress. It is important to avoid or to deal with the triggers that make post acute withdrawal syndrome worse. The types of symptomology and impairments in severity, frequency, and duration associated with the condition vary depending on the drug of use.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms can sometimes come and go with wave-like reoccurrences or fluctuations in severity of symptoms. Common symptoms include impaired cognition, irritability, depressed mood, and anxiety; all of which may reach severe levels which can lead to relapse.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Stojek A | coauthors = Madejski J, Dedelis E, Janicki K | year = 1990 | month = May-Jun | title = [Correction of the symptoms of late substance withdrawal syndrome by intra-conjunctival administration of 5% homatropine solution (preliminary report)] | journal = Psychiatr Pol | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–201 | pmid = 2084727 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author =Bokhan NA | coauthors =Abolonin AF, Krylov EN, Vetlugina TP, Ivanova SA | year =2003 | month = | title =Comparative Efficiency of Proproten-100 during the Therapy of Patients with Alcoholism in the Stage of Therapeutic Remission | journal =Bull Exp Biol Med | volume =135 | issue =Suppl 1 | pages =171–5 | pmid =12949690 | doi =10.1023/A:1024709014483 }}</ref>

The protracted withdrawal syndrome from [[benzodiazepine]]s can produce symptoms identical to generalised anxiety disorder as well as panic disorder.

===Post-acute benzodiazepine withdrawal===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}
Disturbances in mental function can persist for several months or years after [[withdrawal from benzodiazepines]]. Psychotic depression persisting for more than a year following benzodiazepine withdrawal has been documented in the medical literature. The patient had no prior psychiatric history. The symptoms reported in the patient included, [[major depressive disorder]] with [[psychotic]] features, including persistent depressed mood, poor concentration, decreased [[appetite]], [[insomnia]], [[anhedonia]], anergia and [[psychomotor retardation]]. The patient also experienced paranoid ideation (believing she was being poisoned and persecuted by co-employees), accompanied by sensory hallucinations. Symptoms developed after abrupt withdrawal of chlordiazepoxide and persisted for 14 months. Various psychiatric medications were trialed which were unsuccessful in alleviating the symptomatology. Symptoms were completely relieved by recommending chlordiazepoxide for irritable bowel syndrome 14 months later.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Psychosomatics | year = 1997 | month = Mar-Apr | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–1 | title = Protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome mimicking psychotic depression | author = Modell JG | pmid = 9063050 | publisher = Psychiatry Online | url = http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/38/2/160.pdf | format = PDF | doi=10.1016/S0033-3182(97)71493-2}}</ref> Another case report, reported similar phenomenon in a female patient who abruptly reduced her diazepam dosage from 30&nbsp;mg to 5&nbsp;mg per day.

A clinical trial of patients taking the benzodiazepine alprazolam ([[Xanax]]) for as little as 8 weeks triggered protracted symptoms of memory deficits which were still present after up to 8 weeks post cessation of alprazolam.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7892364 |year=1994 |month= November|author=Curran, Hv; Bond, A; O'Sullivan, G; Bruce, M; Marks, I; Lelliot, P; Shine, P; Lader, M |title=Memory functions, alprazolam and exposure therapy: a controlled longitudinal study of agoraphobia with panic disorder. |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=969–76 |issn=0033-2917 |journal=Psychological Medicine |url= |format= |doi=10.1017/S0033291700029056 }}</ref>
