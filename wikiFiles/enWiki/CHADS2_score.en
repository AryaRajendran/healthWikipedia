The '''CHADS<sub>2</sub> score''' is a [[clinical prediction rule]] for estimating the risk of [[stroke]] in patients with [[rheumatic fever|non-rheumatic]] [[atrial fibrillation|atrial&nbsp;fibrillation]] (AF), a common and serious [[heart arrhythmia]] associated with thromboembolic stroke.  It is used to determine whether or not treatment is required with [[anticoagulation]] therapy or antiplatelet therapy,<ref name="pmid15477396 ">{{cite journal | title=Selecting patients with atrial fibrillation for anticoagulation: stroke risk stratification in patients taking aspirin | journal=Circulation | year=2004 | volume=110 | issue=16 | pages=2287&ndash;92 | author=Gage BF, van Walraven C, Pearce L, ''et al.'' | pmid=15477396 | doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000145172.55640.93 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/110/16/2287}}</ref> since AF can cause stasis of blood in the upper [[heart chamber]]s, leading to the formation of a [[mural thrombus]] that can dislodge into the blood flow, reach the brain, cut off  supply to the brain, and cause a stroke.  A high CHADS<sub>2</sub> score corresponds to a greater risk of stroke, while a low CHADS<sub>2</sub> score corresponds to a lower risk of stroke. The CHADS<sub>2</sub> score is simple and has been validated by many studies.<ref name=Gage2001>{{cite journal |author=Gage BF, Waterman AD, Shannon W, Boechler M, Rich MW, Radford MJ |title=Validation of clinical classification schemes for predicting stroke: results from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation |journal=JAMA |volume=285 |issue=22 |pages=2864–70 |year=2001 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/22/2864 |pmid=11401607 |doi=10.1001/jama.285.22.2864}}</ref>

In clinical use, the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score has been superseded by the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score that gives a better stratification of low-risk patients.

According to the findings of the initial validation study, the risk of stroke as a percentage per year for the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score is shown in the table.

The CHADS<sub>2</sub> score does not include some common stroke risk factors and its various pros/cons have been carefully discussed.<ref>Karthikeyan G, Eikelboom JW. The CHADS2 score for stroke risk stratification in atrial fibrillation--friend or foe? Thromb Haemost. 2010 Jul 5;104(1):45-8.</ref> Nonetheless, this score is simple and thus it has become widely used.

To complement the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score, by the inclusion of additional 'stroke risk modifier' risk factors, the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score has been proposed.<ref>Lip GY, Nieuwlaat R, Pisters R, Lane DA, Crijns HJ. Refining clinical risk stratification for predicting stroke and thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation using a novel risk factor-based approach: the euro heart survey on atrial fibrillation. Chest. 2010 Feb;137(2):263-72.</ref>  These additional non-major stroke risk factors include age 65-74, female gender and vascular disease.  In the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score score, 'age 75 and above' also has extra weight, with 2 points.   

The CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score has been used in the new European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation.<ref>European Heart Rhythm Association; European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P, Lip GY, Schotten U, Savelieva I, Ernst S, Van Gelder IC, Al-Attar N, Hindricks G, Prendergast B, Heidbuchel H, Alfieri O, Angelini A, Atar D, Colonna P, De Caterina R, De Sutter J, Goette A, Gorenek B, Heldal M, Hohloser SH, Kolh P, Le Heuzey JY, Ponikowski P, Rutten FH. Guidelines  for the management of atrial fibrillation: the Task Force for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Eur Heart J. 2010 Oct;31(19):2369-429.</ref><ref name="escardio.org">http://www.escardio.org/guidelines-surveys/esc-guidelines/Pages/atrial-fibrillation.aspx</ref>

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend that if the patient has a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 2 and above, oral anticoagulation therapy (OAC) such as warfarin (target [[Prothrombin time|INR]] of 2-3) or one of the new OAC drugs (such as dabigatran) should be prescribed.  

If the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score is 0-1, other stroke risk modifiers could be considered: (i) If there are 2 or more risk factors (essentially a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score score of 2 or more), OAC is recommended; and (ii) If there is 1 risk factor (essentially a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score score=1), antithrombotic therapy with OAC or aspirin (OAC preferred) is recommended, and patient values and preferences should be considered. 

A CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score score=0 corresponds to a 'truly low risk,’<ref>Olesen JB, Lip GY, Hansen ML, Hansen PR, Tolstrup JS, Lindhardsen J, Selmer C, Ahlehoff O, Olsen AM, Gislason GH, Torp-Pedersen C.

Stroke risk assessment should always include an assessment of bleeding risk.  This can be done using validated bleeding risk scores, such as the HEMORR<sub>2</sub>HAGES or HAS-BLED scores.  The latter is recommended in the ESC and Canadian guidelines.<ref>Cairns JA, Connolly S, McMurtry S, Stephenson M, Talajic M; CCS Atrial Fibrillation Guidelines Committee. Canadian Cardiovascular Society atrial fibrillation guidelines 2010: prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation and flutter. Can J Cardiol. 2011 Jan-Feb;27(1):74-90. PMID 21329865.</ref>  If the patient is taking warfarin, then knowledge of INR control is needed to assess the 'labile INR' criterion in HAS-BLED; otherwise for a non-warfarin patient, this scores zero.

The CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score is a refinement of CHADS<sub>2</sub> score and extends the latter by including additional common stroke risk factors, as discussed below.

The maximum CHADS<sub>2</sub> score is 6, whilst the maximum CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score is 9.

Based on the ESC guidelines on Atrial Fibrillation, oral anticoagulation is recommended or preferred for patients with one or more stroke risk factors (i.e. a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1 and above).  This is consistent with a recent decision analysis model showing how the 'tipping point' on the decision to anticoagulate has changed with the availability of new 'safer' OAC drugs.<ref name="escardio.org"/><ref>Eckman MH, Singer DE, Rosand J, Greenberg SM. Moving the tipping point: the decision to anticoagulate patients with atrial fibrillation. Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2011 Jan 1;4(1):14-21.</ref>

===Limitations of stroke risk prediction tools===
Current stroke risk prediction tools including the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc models are helpful in clinical practice. However, these are limited within the context of complex cardiogeriatric syndromes. Expanding such models to consider frailty, cognitive and functional decline, or nonadherence to anticoagulant therapy is warranted. Although avoiding stroke is an important consideration, the potential adverse effects of treatment needs to be balanced within the context of best available evidence, clinical expertise, and the individual patient’s circumstances. Developing metrics that consider the combination of these factors are likely to shed light on the issues of adherence in this population.<ref>Ferguson C, Inglis SC, Newton PJ, Middleton S, Macdonald PS, Davidson PM. Atrial fibrillation and thromboprophylaxis in heart failure: the need for patient-centered approaches to address adherence.
