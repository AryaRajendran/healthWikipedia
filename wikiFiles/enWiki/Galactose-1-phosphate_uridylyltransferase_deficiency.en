'''Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency''', also called '''galactosemia type 1''', '''classic galactosemia''' or '''GALT deficiency''', is the most common type of [[galactosemia]], an inborn error of [[galactose]] metabolism, caused by a deficiency of the [[enzyme]] [[galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]].<ref name=omim>{{cite web|title=Galactosemia OMIM #230400|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|url=http://omim.org/entry/230400|accessdate=2011-11-24}}</ref> It is an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[inborn errors of metabolism|metabolic disorder]] that can cause liver disease and death if untreated.  Treatment of galactosemia is most successful if initiated early, and includes dietary restriction of lactose intake.  Because early intervention is key, galactosemia is included in [[newborn screening]] programs in many areas.  On initial screening, which often involves measuring the concentration of galactose in blood, classic galactosemia may be indistinguishable from other inborn errors of galactose metabolism, including [[galactokinase deficiency]] and [[galactose epimerase deficiency]].  Further analysis of metabolites and enzyme activities are needed to identify the specific metabolic error.

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
In undiagnosed and untreated children, the accumulation of precursor metabolites due to the deficient activity of galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) can lead to feeding problems, [[failure to thrive]], liver damage, bleeding and infections.  The first presenting symptom in an infant is often prolonged [[jaundice]].  Without intervention in the form of galactose restriction, infants can develop [[hyperammonemia]] and [[sepsis]], possibly leading to shock.  The accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) can lead to [[cataracts]] which are similar to those seen in [[galactokinase deficiency]].<ref name=genereviews>{{cite web|title=Galactosemia|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1518/|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref>  Long-term consequences of continued galactose intake can include [[developmental delay]], [[verbal dyspraxia]] and motor abnormalities.  Galactosemic females frequently suffer from ovarian failure, regardless of treatment in the form of galactose restriction.<ref name=genereviews />

In most regions, galactosemia is diagnosed as a result of [[newborn screening]], most commonly by determining the concentration of galactose in a dried blood spot.  Some regions will perform a second-tier test of GALT enzyme activity on samples with elevated galactose, while others will immediately initiate confirmatory testing.  While awaiting confirmatory testing for classic galactosemia, the infant is typically fed a soy-based formula, as human and cow milk contains galactose.<ref name=actsheet>{{cite web|title=Newborn Screening ACT Sheet [Absent/Reduced Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridyltransferase (GALT)]
Classical Galactosemia|url=http://www.acmg.net/StaticContent/ACT/Galactose+GALT.pdf|publisher=American College of Medical Genetics|accessdate=2011-11-05}}</ref>  Confirmatory testing would include measurement of enzyme activity in red blood cells, determination of Gal-1-P levels in the blood, and genetic testing.  The differential diagnosis for elevated galactose concentrations in blood on a newborn screening result can include other disorders of galactose metabolism, including [[galactokinase deficiency]] and [[galactose epimerase deficiency]].  Enzyme assays are commonly done using [[fluorometry|fluorometric detection]] or [[scintillation counter|radioactively]] labeled substrates.

==Cause==
[[Lactose]] is a [[disaccharide]] consisting of [[glucose]] and [[galactose]].  After the ingestion of lactose, most commonly from breast milk for an infant or cow milk, the enzyme [[lactase]] hydrolyzes the sugar into its monosaccharide constituents, glucose and galactose.  In the first step of galactose metabolism, galactose is converted to [[galactose 1-phosphate]] (Gal-1-P) by the enzyme [[galactokinase]].  Gal-1-P is converted to uridine diphosphate (UDP) galactose by the enzyme [[galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]], with UDP-glucose acting as a UDP donor.  UDP-galactose can then be converted to lactose, by the enzyme [[lactose synthase]], or to UDP-glucose by [[UDP galactose epimerase]].<ref name=pathways>{{cite book|title=Metabolism at a Glance|last=Salway|first=J.G.|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, MA|page=102|year=2004|edition=3rd

In classic galactosemia, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase activity is reduced or absent, leading to an accumulation of galactose and Gal-1-P.<ref name=pathways />

==Treatment==
There is no cure for GALT deficiency, in the most severely affected patients, treatment involves a galactose free diet for life.  Early identification and implementation of a modified diet greatly improves the outcome for patients.  The extent of residual GALT enzyme activity determines the degree of dietary restriction.  Patients with higher levels of residual enzyme activity can typically tolerate higher levels of galactose in their diets.  As patients get older, dietary restriction is often relaxed.<ref name=genereviews>{{cite web|title=Galactosemia|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1518/|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2011-11-24}}</ref>  With the increased identification of patients, and their improving outcomes, the management of patients with galactosemia in adulthood is still being understood. 

After diagnosis, patients are often supplemented with [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D3]].  Long-term manifestations of the disease, including ovarian failure in females, [[ataxia]] and growth delays are not fully understood.<ref name=genereviews />  Routine monitoring of patients with GALT deficiency includes determining metabolite levels (galactose 1-phosphate in red blood cells, and galactitol in urine) to measure the effectiveness and adherence of dietary therapy, opthalmologic examination for the detection of cataracts and assessment of speech, with the possibility of speech therapy if [[verbal dyspraxia]] is evident.<ref name=genereviews />

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Classic galactosemia has an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern of inheritance.]] 

All forms of galactosemia are inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] manner, meaning individuals affected with classic galactosemia must have inherited a mutated copy of the ''GALT'' gene from both parents.  Each child from two carrier parents would have a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting normal versions of the gene from each parent. 

There are several variants in the GALT gene, which have different levels of residual enzyme activity.  A patient homozygous for the one of the severe mutations in the GALT gene (commonly referred to as G/G) will typically have less than 5% of the enzyme activity expected in an unaffected patient.<ref name=genereviews />  Duarte galactosemia is caused by mutations that produce an unstable form of the GALT enzyme, with reduced promoter expression.  Patients who are homozygous for Duarte mutations (D/D) will have reduced levels of enzyme activity compared to normal controls, but can often maintain a normal diet.  Compound heterozygotes (D/G) will often be detected by newborn screening, and treatment is based on the extent of residual enzyme activity.<ref name=genereviews />
