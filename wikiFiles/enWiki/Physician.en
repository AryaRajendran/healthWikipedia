A '''physician''' is a [[professional]] who practices [[medicine]], which is concerned with promoting, maintaining or restoring human [[health]] through the study, [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], and [[therapy|treatment]] of [[disease]], [[injury]], and other physical and mental impairments. They may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients, or methods of treatment – known as [[Specialty (medicine)|specialist medical practitioners]] – or assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communities – known as [[general practitioner]]s.<ref>World Health Organization: ''Classifying health workers''. Geneva, 2010.</ref> Medical practice properly requires both a detailed [[knowledge]] of the [[academic discipline]]s (such as [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]) underlying diseases and their treatment – the ''[[science]]'' of medicine – and also a decent [[Competence (human resources)|competence]] in its applied practice – the art or ''[[craft]]'' of medicine.

Both the role of the '''physician''' and the meaning of the word itself vary around the world, including a wide variety of qualifications and degrees, but there are some common elements.  For example, the [[medical ethics|ethics of medicine]] require that physicians show consideration, compassion and benevolence for their [[patient]]s.

==Modern meanings==
[[File:Typhoid inoculation2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A medical doctor performing a [[typhoid]] vaccination, 1943]]
In modern English, the term ''physician'' is used in two main ways, with relatively broad and narrow meanings respectively. This is the result of history and is often confusing. These meanings and variations are explained below.

===Specialist in internal medicine===
{{Main|Internal medicine}}
Around the world the term physician refers to a [[Medical specialist|specialist]] in [[internal medicine]] or one of its many sub-specialties (especially as opposed to a specialist in [[surgery]]). This meaning of physician conveys a sense of expertise in treatment by drugs or medications, rather than by the procedures of surgeons.<ref name="Fowler">{{cite book |author= H.W. Fowler.|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (Wordsworth Collection) |publisher=NTC/Contemporary Publishing Company |year= 1994|pages= |isbn=1-85326-318-4 |doi=}}</ref>

This term is at least nine hundred years old in English: physicians and surgeons were once members of separate professions, and traditionally were rivals. The [[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]], third edition, gives a Middle English quotation making this contrast, from as early as 1400:

{{bquote|O Lord, whi is it so greet difference betwixe a cirugian and a physician.<ref name="newSOED"/>}}

[[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]] granted a charter to the London [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1518. It was not until 1540 that he granted the Company of Barber/Surgeons (ancestor of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]]) its separate charter. In the same year, the English monarch established the [[Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)|Regius Professorship of Physic]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/about/history.html | title = University of Cambridge: History of the School of Clinical Medicine | publisher = [[University of Cambridge]] | accessdate = 2008-02-05 }}</ref>  Newer universities would probably describe such an academic as a professor of [[internal medicine]]. Hence, in the 16th century, ''physic'' meant roughly what internal medicine does now.

Currently, a specialist [[physician in the United States]] may be described as an ''internist''. Another term, ''[[hospitalist]]'', was introduced in 1996,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wachter R, Goldman L |title=The emerging role of "hospitalists" in the American health care system |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=335 |issue=7 |pages=514–7 |year=1996 |pmid=8672160 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199608153350713}}</ref> to describe US specialists in [[internal medicine]] who work largely or exclusively in hospitals. Such 'hospitalists' now make up about 19% of all US '' general internists'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuo Y.-F. ''et al.'' |title=Growth in the care of older patients by hospitalists in the United States|journal=N Engl J Med |volume=360 |issue=11 |pages=1102–1112 |year=2009|comment=See also editorial by Hamel M. B. ''et al.'' on pp1141–1143 of same issue |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0802381 |pmc=2977939 |pmid=19279342 |last1=Kuo |first1=YF |last2=Sharma |first2=G |last3=Freeman |first3=JL |last4=Goodwin |first4=JS}}</ref> who are often called ''general physicians'' in [[Commonwealth of nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

This original use, as distinct from surgeon, is common in most of the world including the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (such as [[Australia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Zimbabwe]]), as well as in places as diverse as [[Brazil]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Taiwan]]. In such places, the  more general English terms ''doctor'' or ''medical practitioner'' are prevalent, describing any practitioner of medicine (whom an American would likely call a physician, in the broad sense).<ref>{{cite web

|archivedate=2008-03-06}}</ref> In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, specialist [[pediatrics|pediatricians]] and [[geriatrics|geriatricians]] are also described as specialist physicians who have sub-specialized by age of patient rather than by [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] system.

===Physician and surgeon===
Around the world, the combined term "Physician and Surgeon" is used to describe either a general practitioner or any medical practitioner irrespective of specialty.<ref name="Fowler"/><ref name="newSOED">{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |doi=}}</ref> This usage still shows the original meaning of physician and preserves the old difference between a physician, as a practitioner of ''physic'', and a [[surgeon]]. The term may be used by state medical boards in the United States of America, and by equivalent bodies in provinces of Canada, to describe any medical practitioner.

===North America===
{{Further|Physician in the United States}}
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the term ''physician'' describes all medical practitioners holding a professional medical degree.  The [[American Medical Association]], established in 1847, as well as the [[American Osteopathic Association]], founded in 1897, both currently use the term ''physician'' to describe members. However, the [[American College of Physicians]], established in 1915, does not: its title uses ''physician'' in its original sense.

===American Physicians===
A [[physician in the United States|physician trained in the United States]] has either a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree, and uses the initials 'M.D.' or has a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree and uses the initials 'D.O.' After finishing their medical school education both a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) and Doctor of Medicine (MD), with licensure, have the same unlimited practicing rights in all specialties and subspecialties of medicine. United States [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic medical schools]] have a curriculum almost identical to MD schools with the addition of [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]], which focuses on extra instruction in the musculoskeletal system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002020.htm |title=Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine of National Institutes of Health |accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref> 

Graduates of osteopathic medical schools in the United States should not be confused with [[osteopaths]], who are trained in the European and Commonwealth nations. Osteopaths (the term used for non-American-trained practitioners who practice osteopathic manipulation) are not physicians. Their training is similar to physical therapy and they are not licensed to prescribe medications or perform surgeries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aacom.org/about/osteomed/Pages/TheDifference.aspx |title=The Difference Between U.S.-Trained Osteopathic Physicians and Osteopaths Trained Abroad |author= |year=2012 |work= |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine |accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/Pages/osteopathic-style-guide.aspx |title=Style Guide for Reporting on Osteopathic Medicine |author= |year= |work= |publisher=American Osteopathic Association |accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref>

===Podiatric physicians===
Also in the United States, the American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) defines [[podiatrists]] as physicians and surgeons that fall under the department of surgery in hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apma.org/MainMenu/AboutPodiatry.aspx |title=About Podiatry |publisher=Apma.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref> They undergo training with the [[Doctor of Podiatric Medicine]] (DPM) degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.education.nih.gov/lifeworks.nsf/alphabetical+list/Podiatrist?OpenDocument&ShowTab=All& |title=Podiatrist |author= |year= |work= |publisher=Office of Science Education |accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref>

==Social role and world view==
{{Main|Medical anthropology|Medical history}}

===Biomedicine===
Within [[Western culture]] and over recent centuries, [[Medicine|conventional Western medicine]] has become increasingly based on scientific [[reductionism]] and [[materialism]]. This style of medicine is now dominant throughout the industrialized world, and is often termed ''[[biomedicine]]'' by [[Medical anthropology|medical anthropologists]].<ref name="hahn1">{{cite book |editor1-first= R.A. Hahn|editor1-last= A. Gaines|title= Physicians of western medicine  |year= 1985|publisher=  D. Reidel|location=   Dordrecht (Netherlands)|isbn= 90-277-1790-7|pages= 3–22| chapter= Chapter 1: Introduction (by editors)}}</ref>  Biomedicine "formulates the human body and disease in a culturally distinctive pattern",<ref name="Good94">{{cite book |author=Good, Byron J |title=Medicine, rationality, and experience: an anthropological perspective (based on the Lewis Henry Morgan Lectures, at the University of Rochester, NY, in March 1990)|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1994 |pages= 65, 65–87 | chapter= Chapter 3 |isbn=0-521-42576-X (pbk) |doi=}}</ref> and is a [[world view]] learnt by medical students. Within this tradition, the [[medical model]] is a term for the complete "set of procedures in which all doctors are trained" (R. D. Laing, 1972),<ref name="Laing71">{{cite book |author=Laing, R.D. |title=The politics of the family and other essays |publisher=Tavistock Publications |location=London |year=1971 |isbn= |doi=}}</ref> including mental attitudes. A particularly clear expression of this world view, currently dominant among conventional physicians, is [[evidence-based medicine]]. Within conventional Western medicine, most physicians still pay heed to their ancient traditions:
<blockquote> The critical sense and sceptical attitude of the citation of medicine from the shackles of priestcraft and of caste; ''secondly'', the conception of medicine as an art based on accurate observation, and as a science, an integral part of the science of man and of nature; ''thirdly'', the high moral ideals, expressed in that most "memorable of human documents" (Gomperz), the [[Hippocratic oath]]; and ''fourthly'', the conception and realization of medicine as the profession of a cultivated gentleman.<br />
— [[William Osler|Sir William Osler]], ''Chauvanism in Medicine'' (1902)<ref name="osler1">{{cite journal |author=Osler, Sir William|title=Chauvanism in medicine: address to the Canadian Medical Association, Montreal (17 September 1902)|journal=The Montreal Medical Journal |volume=XXXI |issue= |pages= |year=1902}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In this [[Western culture|Western]] tradition, physicians are considered to be members of a learned [[profession]], and enjoy high [[social status]], often combined with expectations of a high and stable income and [[job security]]. However, medical practitioners often work long and inflexible hours, with shifts at unsociable times. Their high status is partly from their extensive training requirements, and also because of their occupation's special [[Medical ethics|ethical]] and [[Medical jurisprudence|legal]] duties. The term traditionally used by physicians to describe a person seeking their help is the word ''patient'' (although one who [[Doctor's visit|visits]] a physician for a routine [[check-up]] may also be so described). This word [[wikt:patient|patient]] is an ancient reminder of medical duty, as it originally meant 'one who suffers'. The English noun comes from the [[Latin]] word ''patiens'', the [[present participle]] of the [[deponent verb]], [[wikt:patior|patior]], meaning 'I am suffering,' and akin to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb πάσχειν (= ''paskhein'', to suffer) and its cognate noun [[wikt:πάθος|πάθος]] (= [[wikt:pathos|pathos]]).<ref name="newSOED"/><ref name="Partridge">{{cite book |author=Partridge, Eric |title=Origins: a short etymological dictionary of modern English |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1966 |pages= |isbn=0-02-594840-7 |doi=}}</ref>

Physicians in the original, narrow sense (specialist physicians or internists—see above) are commonly members or fellows of professional organizations, such as the [[American College of Physicians]] or the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in the United Kingdom, and such hard-won membership is itself a mark of status.

===Complementary and alternative medicine===
While contemporary [[Medicine|biomedicine]] has distanced itself from its ancient roots in religion and magic, many forms of [[traditional medicine]]<ref name="galdston63tradmed">{{cite book |editor1-first= Iago|editor1-last= Galdston|title= Man's image in medicine and anthropology: Monograph&nbsp; IV, Institute of social and historical medicine, New York Academy of Medicine|year= 1963 |publisher=International Universities Press |location=New York |pages=43–334 |chapter=Part 1: Medicine and primitive man (five chapters); Part 2: Medical man and medicine man in three North American Indian societies (three chapters) }}</ref> and [[Alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM) continue to espouse [[vitalism]] in various guises: 'As long as life had its own secret properties, it was possible to have sciences and medicines based on those properties' ([[Richard Grossinger|Grossinger]] 1980).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grossinger, Richard |title=Planet medicine: from stone age shamanism to post-industrial healing |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=116–131 |year=1980, 1982 (revised edition) |publisher= North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, CA, US |isbn= 978-1-55643-369-6|pmid= |doi= }}</ref> The US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) classifies [[Complementary and alternative medicine|CAM]] therapies into five categories or domains, including:<ref name="titleComplementary and Alternative Medicine - U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine&nbsp;– U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual |accessdate=2008-03-31 |work=}}</ref> alternative medical [[system]]s, or complete systems of therapy and practice; [[bodymind|mind-body]] interventions, or techniques designed to facilitate the mind's effect on bodily functions and symptoms; biologically based systems including [[herbalism]]; and manipulative and body-based methods such as chiropractic and massage therapy.

In considering these alternate traditions that differ from biomedicine (see above), [[medical anthropology|medical anthropologists]] emphasize that ''all'' ways of thinking about health and disease have a significant cultural content, including conventional western medicine.<ref name="hahn1" /><ref name="Good94" /><ref name="galdston63biomed">{{cite book |editor1-first= Iago|editor1-last= Galdston|title= Man's image in medicine and anthropology: Monograph&nbsp;IV, Institute of social and historical medicine, New York Academy of Medicine|year= 1963 |publisher=International Universities Press |location=New York |pages=477–520 |chapter=Part V: Culture and the practice of modern medicine (two chapters)}}</ref><ref name="Joralemon99">{{cite book |author=Joralemon, DonaldJ |title=Exploring medical anthropology|publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Needham Heights, MA, US |year=1999 |pages= 1–15 |chapter= chapter 1: What's so cultural about disease? |isbn=0-205-27006-9 (pbk) |doi=}}</ref>

[[Ayurveda]], [[Unani medicine]] and [[Homeopathy]] are popular complementary systems of medicine. They are included in national system of medicine in many countries including India and neighbouring countries. The practitioners of these medicine in these countries are generally referred to as Ved, Hakim and homeopathic doctor/homeopath/homeopathic physician, respectively.

===Physicians' own health===
Some commentators have argued that physicians have duties to serve as role models for the general public in matters of health, for example by not smoking cigarettes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Appel JM |title=Smoke and mirrors: one case for ethical obligations of the physician as public role model |journal=Camb Q Healthc Ethics |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=95–100 |year=2009 |pmid=19149049 |doi=10.1017/S0963180108090142}}</ref> Indeed, in most western nations relatively few physicians smoke, and their professional knowledge does appear to have a beneficial effect on their health and lifestyle.

Causes of death less likely in physicians than the general population include respiratory disease (including [[pneumonia]], [[pneumoconioses]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], but excluding [[emphysema]] and other [[chronic airway obstruction]]), alcohol-related deaths, rectosigmoidal and anal cancers, and bacterial diseases.<ref name=frank/>

However&nbsp;...

==Education and training==
{{Main|Medical education}}
[[Medical education]] and career pathways for doctors vary considerably across the world.

===All medical practitioners===
In all developed countries, entry-level medical education programs are [[Tertiary education|tertiary]]-level [[Course (education)|courses]], undertaken at a [[medical school]] attached to a [[university]]. Depending on jurisdiction and university, entry may follow directly from [[secondary school]] or require pre-requisite [[undergraduate education]]. The former commonly takes five or six years to complete. Programs that require previous undergraduate education (typically a three- or four-year degree, often in Science) are usually four or five years in length. Hence, gaining a basic medical degree may typically take from five to eight years, depending on jurisdiction and university.

Following completion of entry-level training, newly graduated medical practitioners are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before full registration is granted, typically one or two years. This may be referred to as "[[medical intern|internship]]", "Foundation" years in the UK, or "conditional registration".  Some jurisdictions, including the United States, require [[Residency (medicine)|residencies]] for practice.

Medical practitioners hold a medical degree specific to the university from which they graduated. This degree qualifies the medical practitioner to become [[medical license|licensed]] or registered under the laws of that particular country, and sometimes of several countries, subject to requirements for internship or conditional registration.

===Specialists in internal medicine===

In some jurisdictions, specialty training is begun immediately following completion of entry-level training, or even before. In other jurisdictions, junior medical doctors must undertake generalist (un-streamed) training for one or more years before commencing specialization. Hence, depending on jurisdiction, a specialist physician (internist) often does not achieve recognition as a specialist until twelve or more years after commencing basic medical training—five to eight years at university to obtain a basic medical qualification, and up to another nine years to become a specialist.

==Regulation==
In most jurisdictions, physicians (in either sense of the word) need government permission to practice. Such permission is intended to promote public safety, and often to protect the public purse, as medical care is commonly subsidized by national governments.

In some jurisdictions (e.g. [[Singapore]]), it is common for physicians to inflate their qualifications with the title "Dr" in correspondence or namecards, even if their qualifications are limited to a basic (e.g. bachelor level) degree. In other countries (e.g. [[Germany]]), only physicians holding an academic doctorate may call themselves doctor.

===All medical practitioners===
Among the English-speaking countries, this process is known either as [[licensure]] as in the United States, or as [[Registration (occupational)|registration]] in the [[United Kingdom]], other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, and [[Ireland]]. Synonyms in use elsewhere include ''colegiación'' in [[Spain]], ''ishi menkyo'' in [[Japan]], ''autorisasjon'' in [[Norway]], ''Approbation'' in [[Germany]], and "άδεια εργασίας" in Greece. In [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]], civilian physicians must be members of the Order of Physicians to practice medicine.

In some countries, including the United Kingdom and Ireland, the profession largely regulates itself, with the government affirming the regulating body's authority. The best known example of this is probably the [[General Medical Council]] of Britain. In all countries, the regulating authorities will revoke permission to practice in cases of [[malpractice]] or serious misconduct.

In the large English-speaking federations ([[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]]), the licensing or registration of medical practitioners is done at a state or provincial level or nationally as in New Zealand. Australian states usually have a "Medical Board" which has now been replaced by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulatory Authority (AHPRA) in most states, while Canadian provinces usually have a "College of Physicians and Surgeons." All American states have an agency which is usually called the "Medical Board", although there are alternate names such as "Board of Medicine," "Board of Medical Examiners", "Board of Medical Licensure", "Board of Healing Arts" or some other variation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/2645.html|title=AMA Links to state medical boards|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> After graduating from a first-professional school, physicians who wish to practice in the U.S. usually take standardized exams, such as the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|USMLE]] for [[Doctor of Medicine|MDs]] and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|DO]]s or the [[COMLEX-USA]] for [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|DOs]], which is not available to MDs (although most DOs in the U.S. also take the USMLE exams and undergo the same residency training as MDs).

===Specialists in internal medicine===
Most countries have some method of officially recognizing specialist qualifications in all branches of medicine, including internal medicine. Sometimes, this aims to promote public safety by restricting the use of hazardous treatments.  Other reasons for regulating specialists may include standardization of recognition for hospital employment and restriction on which practitioners are entitled to receive higher insurance payments for specialist services.

=== Performance and professionalism supervision ===
The issue of medical errors, drug abuse, and other issues in physician professional behavior received significant attention across the world,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lim MK |title=Quest for quality care and patient safety: the case of Singapore |journal=Qual Saf Health Care |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=71–5 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14757804 |pmc=1758053 |doi=10.1136/qshc.2002.004994  |url=}}</ref> particularly following a critical 2000 report<ref>Committee on Quality of Health Care in America, Institute of Medicine.

In Switzerland, students since 2008 have the option of studying in the [[University of Zurich]] medical school earning a Bachelor of Medicine (with a focus on chiropractic) and a Masters in Chiropractic Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uzh.ch/studies/application/medicine.html |title=UZH - Universität Zürich - Medizinstudium |publisher=Uzh.ch |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balgrist.ch/en/Home/Weitere_Kompetenzen/Chiropraktik.aspx |title=Uniklinik Balgrist - Chiropractic medicine |publisher=Balgrist.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=FlicFlacFilms |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd_pGKQwntY |title=Chiropractic Studies at the University of Zurich (with English subtitles) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref> By attending medical school they become "physicians" in the more traditional sense.

===Nurse practitioners===
[[Nurse practitioner]]s (NPs) in the United States are advance practice registered nurses holding a post-graduate degree such as a [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]].<ref>[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1300/1300_01.htm#b28 Section 1300.01 Definitions relating to controlled substances.]</ref> Nurse practitioners are not considered Physicians but may practice in similar fields as physicians with an emphasis on [[primary care]].  Nurse practitioners are educated in [[nursing theory]] and nursing practice rather than pure medical practice.  The scope of practice for a nurse practitioner in the United States is defined by regulatory boards of nursing, as opposed to boards of medicine which regulate medical doctors.
