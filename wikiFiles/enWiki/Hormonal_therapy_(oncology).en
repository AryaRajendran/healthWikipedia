'''Hormonal therapy''' is one of the major modalities of medical treatment for cancer, others being [[chemotherapy|cytotoxic chemotherapy]] and [[targeted therapy]] (biotherapeutics). It involves the manipulation of the [[endocrine system]] through exogenous administration of specific [[hormone]]s, particularly [[steroid hormone]]s, or drugs which inhibit the production or activity of such hormones ([[hormone antagonist]]s). Because steroid hormones are powerful drivers of [[gene expression]] in certain cancer [[cell (biology)|cells]], changing the levels or activity of certain hormones can cause certain cancers to cease growing, or even undergo [[cell death]]. Surgical removal of endocrine organs, such as [[orchiectomy]] and [[oophorectomy]] can also be employed as a form of hormonal therapy. 

Hormonal therapy is used for several types of [[cancer]]s derived from hormonally responsive [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], including the [[breast cancer|breast]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]], [[endometrial cancer|endometrium]], and [[adrenocortical carcinoma|adrenal cortex]]. Hormonal therapy may also be used in the treatment of [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]s or to ameliorate certain cancer- and [[chemotherapy]]-associated [[symptom]]s, such as [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]]. Perhaps the most familiar example of hormonal therapy in [[oncology]] is the use of the ''selective estrogen-response modulator'' [[tamoxifen]] for the treatment of [[breast cancer]], although another class of hormonal agents, [[aromatase inhibitor]]s, now have an expanding role in that disease.

One effective strategy for starving tumor cells of growth- and survival-promoting hormones is to use drugs which inhibit the production of those hormones in their organ of origin.

===Aromatase inhibitors
[[Aromatase inhibitor]]s are an important class of drugs used for the treatment of [[breast cancer]] in [[menopause|postmenopausal]] women. At menopause, [[estrogen]] production in the ovaries ceases, but other tissues continue to produce estrogen through the action of the enzyme [[aromatase]] on [[androgen]]s produced by the [[adrenal gland]]s. When the action of aromatase is blocked, estrogen levels in post-menopausal women can drop to extremely low levels, causing growth arrest and/or apoptosis of hormone-responsive cancer cells. [[Letrozole]] and [[anastrozole]] are aromatase inhibitors which have been shown to be superior to [[tamoxifen]] for the first-line treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.<ref name="DeVita"/> [[Exemestane]] is an irreversible "aromatase inactivator" which is superior to [[megestrol]] for treatment of [[tamoxifen]]-refractory metastatic breast cancer, and does not appear to have the [[osteoporosis]]-promoting side effects of other drugs in this class.<ref name="DeVita">{{cite book |author=edited by Vincent T. DeVita, Samuel Hellman, Steven A. Rosenberg |title=Cancer: principles & practice of oncology |publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott Company|Lippincott-Raven]] |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-4865-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

[[Aminoglutethimide]] inhibits both [[aromatase]] and other enzymes critical for steroid hormone synthesis in the [[adrenal gland]]s. It was formerly used for [[breast cancer]] treatment, but has since been replaced by more selective aromatase inhibitors. It can also be used for the treatment of hyperadrenocortical syndromes, such as [[Cushing's syndrome]] and [[Conn's syndrome|hyperaldosteronism]] in [[adrenocortical carcinoma]].<ref name="DeVita"/>

===GnRH analogs===
Analogs of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) can be used to induce a [[chemical castration]], that is, complete suppression of the production of estrogen and progesterone from the female [[ovary|ovaries]], or complete suppression of [[testosterone]] production from the male [[testis|testes]]. This is due to a negative feedback effect of continuous stimulation of  the [[pituitary]] gland by these hormones. [[Leuprolide]] and [[goserelin]] are GnRH analogs which are used primarily for the treatment of hormone-responsive [[prostate cancer]]. Because the initial [[endocrine]] response to GnRH analogs is actually hypersecretion of gonadal steroids, hormone receptor antagonists such as [[flutamide]] are typically used to prevent a transient boost in tumor growth.<ref name="DeVita">{{cite book |author=edited by Vincent T. DeVita, Samuel Hellman, Steven A. Rosenberg |title=Cancer: principles & practice of oncology |publisher=Lippincott-Raven |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-4865-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

==Hormone receptor antagonists==
[[Hormone antagonists|Hormone receptor antagonists]] bind to the normal receptor for a given hormone and prevent its activation. The target recepetor may be on the cell surface, as in the case of peptide and glycoprotein hormones, or it may be intracellular, as in the case of [[steroid hormone]] receptors.

===Selective estrogen receptor modulators===
[[File:Tamoxifen.svg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tamoxifen]]]]

''Selective estrogen receptor modulators'' (SERM's) are an important class of hormonal therapy agents which act as antagonists of the estrogen receptor and are used primarily for the treatment and [[chemoprevention]] of [[breast cancer]]. Some members of this family, such as [[tamoxifen]], are actually [[partial agonist]]s, which can actually ''increase'' estrogen receptor signalling in some tissues, such as the [[endometrium]]. Tamoxifen is currently first-line treatment for nearly all [[menopause|pre-menopausal]] women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.<ref name="DeVita"/> [[Raloxifene]] is another partial agonist SERM which does not seem to promote [[endometrial cancer]], and is used primarily for [[chemoprevention]] of breast cancer in high-risk individuals, as well as to prevent [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="DeVita"/> [[Toremifene]] and [[fulvestrant]] are SERM's with little or no agonist activity, and are used for treatment of [[metastasis|metastatic]] breast cancer.<ref name="DeVita"/>

===Antiandrogens===
Antiandrogens are a class of drug which bind and inhibit the [[androgen receptor]], blocking the growth- and survival-promoting effects of [[testosterone]] on certain [[prostate cancer]]s. [[Flutamide]] and [[bicalutamide]] are antiandrogens which are frequently used in the treatment of prostate cancer, either as long-term monotherapy, or in the initial few weeks of GnRH analog therapy.<ref name="DeVita"/>

==Hormone supplementation==
[[File:Megestrol.svg|thumb|150px|left|[[Megestrol]]]]

While most hormonal therapy strategies seek to block hormone signalling to cancer cells, there are some instances in which supplementation with specific hormone agonists may have a growth-inhibiting, or even cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. Because many hormones can produce antagonism and feedback inhibition of the synthesis of other hormones, there is significant overlap between this concept and those discussed above.

===Progestogens===
[[Progestin]]s ([[progesterone]]-like drugs) such as [[megestrol acetate]] and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] have been used for the treatment of hormone-responsive, advanced [[breast cancer]], [[endometrial cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]]. Progestins are also used in the treatment of [[endometrial hyperplasia]], a precursor to endometrial adenocarcinoma. The exact mechanism of action of these hormones is unclear, and may involve both direct effect on the tumor cells (suppression of estrogen receptor levels, alteration of hormone metabolism, direct cytotoxicity) and indirect endocrine effects (suppression of adrenal androgen production and plasma estrone sulfate formation).<ref name="DeVita"/>

===Androgens===
The [[androgen]] ([[testosterone]]-like drug) [[Fluoxymesterone]] is occasionally used for the treatment of advanced [[breast cancer]]. The mechanism of the anticancer effects of this androgen in breast cancer are unclear, but may be analogous to those of progestins.<ref name="DeVita"/>

===Estrogens===
The [[estrogen]] agonist [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) is occasionally used to treat [[prostate cancer]] through suppression of testosterone production. It was previously used in the treatment of [[breast cancer]], but has been replaced by more effective and less toxic agents. [[Estrace]] is an estrogen which was also formerly used for anti-[[androgen]] therapy of prostate cancer.<ref name="G&G">{{cite book |author=Laurence L. Brunton, editor-in-chief;

Parker, Associate Editors |title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th Edition |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. |location=United States of America |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-07-142280-3 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref> [[Polyestradiol phosphate]] is a long-actig derivative of estradiol that is applied as an intramuscular injection.

===Somatostatin analogs===
[[Octreotide]] is an analog of the peptide hormone [[somatostatin]], which inhibits the production of the growth hormone as well as numerous peptide hormones of the gastrointestinal system, including [[insulin]], [[glucagon]], [[pancreatic polypeptide]], ''gastric inhibitory polypeptide'', and [[gastrin]]. Octreotide is used for suppression of the hormonal syndromes which accompany several pancreatic [[islet cell tumor]]s, including the [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]] of [[gastrinoma]] and the chronic [[hypoglycemia]] of [[insulinoma]]. It is also effective in suppression of the [[carcinoid syndrome]], caused by advanced or extra-[[gastrointestinal system|gastrointestinal]] [[carcinoid]] tumors. Octreotide may also be used for treatment of severe diarrhea caused by [[5-fluorouracil]] [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiation therapy]].<ref name="DeVita"/>

==Non-medical hormonal interventions==
In addition to the use of medication to produce tumor-suppressing endocrine alterations, destruction of endocrine organs through [[surgery]] or [[radiation therapy]] are also possible. Surgical [[castration]], or removal of the [[testes]] in males and [[ovaries]] in females, have been widely used in the past to treat hormone-responsive [[prostate cancer]] and [[breast cancer]] respectively. However, these invasive methods have been widely supplanted by the use of GnRH agonists, and other forms of pharmacologic castration.<ref name="Oxford">{{cite book |author=Edited by Robert Leon Souhami |title=Oxford Textbook of Oncology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-19-262926-3 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref>

There are still situations in which surgical castration may be beneficial such as in special cases for women with high risk [[BRCA mutation]]s.

==Hormonal immunotherapy==
''For more information on this topic, see [[Immunotherapy]]''

Hormonal stimulation of the immune system with [[interferon]]s and [[cytokines]] has been used to treat specific cancers, including [[renal cell carcinoma]] and [[melanoma]].
