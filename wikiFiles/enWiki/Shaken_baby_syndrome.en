'''Shaken baby syndrome''' ('''SBS''') is a triad of medical findings: [[subdural hematoma]], [[retinal hemorrhage]], and [[cerebral edema]] from which some doctors, consistent with current medical understanding, infer [[child abuse]] caused by intentional shaking. In a majority of cases there is no visible sign of external trauma.

SBS is often fatal and can cause severe [[brain damage]], resulting in lifelong disability. Estimated death rates ([[mortality rate|mortality]]) among infants with SBS range from 15% to 38%; the median is 20%–25%. Up to half of deaths related to child abuse are reportedly due to shaken baby syndrome.<ref>{{Cite book| author= Montelenone JA, Brodeur AE. | title= Child Maltreatment: A Clinical Guide and Reference | year=1994 | publisher= GW Medical Publishing |location= St Louis}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2011}}  Nonfatal consequences of SBS include varying degrees of visual impairment (including [[blindness]]), motor impairment (e.g. [[cerebral palsy]]) and [[cognitive deficit|cognitive impairment]]s. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Trauma subdural arrow.jpg|right|thumb|[[Subdural hematoma]] (arrow), bleeding between the [[dura mater]] and the brain, commonly occurs in SBS.]]
  
Characteristic injuries associated with SBS include [[retinal hemorrhage]]s, multiple fractures of the long bones, and [[subdural hematoma]]s (bleeding in the brain).<ref name="NINDS_info">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/shakenbaby/shakenbaby.htm |title=NINDS Shaken Baby Syndrome Information Page |accessdate=2008-06-23 |date=2007-02-14 |publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] }}</ref> These signs have evolved through the years as the accepted and recognized signs of child abuse and the shaken baby syndrome. Medical professionals strongly suspect shaking as the cause of injuries when a baby or small child presents with retinal hemorrhage, [[bone fracture|fractures]], [[soft tissue]] injuries or subdural hematoma, that cannot be explained by accidental trauma or other medical conditions.  About three quarters of cases involve retinal hemorrhaging.<ref name="Miehl">{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/515880|title=Shaken Baby Syndrome | accessdate=2011-04-27 | publisher=[[Journal of Forensic Nursing]] }}</ref>  Additional effects of SBS are [[diffuse axonal injury]], [[hypoxia (medical)|oxygen deprivation]] and [[cerebral edema|swelling of the brain]],<ref name="Miehl"/> which can raise [[intracranial pressure]] and damage delicate brain tissue.

Victims of SBS may display irritability, [[failure to thrive]], alterations in eating patterns, [[lethargy]], [[vomiting]], [[seizure]]s, bulging or tense [[fontanel]]s (the soft spots on an infant's head), increased size of the head, altered breathing, and dilated [[pupil]]s.<ref name="biausa">[http://www.biausa.org/Pages/types_of_brain_injury.html#shaken Types of brain injury: Shaken baby syndrome].

==Mechanism==
Rotational injury is especially damaging and likely to occur in shaking trauma.<ref name="Oral"/>
The type of injuries caused by shaking injury are usually not caused by falls and impacts from normal play, which are mostly linear forces.<ref name="Oral"/>    It has been suggested that the mechanism of ocular abnormalities is related to vitreoretinal traction, with movement of the [[Vitreous humour|vitreous]] contributing to development of the characteristic retinal hemorrhages.  These ocular findings correlate well with intracranial abnormalities.<ref>[http://www.ajo.com/article/S0002-9394(02)01628-8/abstract] Post Mortem Findings </ref>

==Prevention==
Prevention is similar to the prevention of [[child abuse]] in general.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Hydrocephalus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hydrocephalus]], an accumulation of [[cerebrospinal fluid]], can accompany SBS.<ref name="Miehl"/>  CT scanning is one technique used to diagnose the condition.]]

==Treatment==
Treatment involves monitoring of [[intracranial pressure]] (the pressure within the skull), draining of fluid from the [[cerebral ventricles]], and, if an [[intracranial hematoma]] is present, draining of the hematoma.<ref name="Miehl"/>

==History==
In 1946, the concept of SBS and the term "whiplash shaken infant syndrome" was introduced by Dr. John Caffey, a pediatric radiologist.<ref>http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/54/4/396</ref> The term described a set of symptoms found with little or no external evidence of head trauma, including retinal hemorrhages and intracranial hemorrhages with subdural or [[Subarachnoid hemorrhage|subarachnoid bleeding]] or both.<ref name="Caffey J 1972 161–9">{{Cite journal|author=Caffey J |title=On the theory and practice of shaking infants.

===Concerns raised by SBS pioneer===
Dr. Norman Guthkelch stated in 2011,"I don't think that the famous triad, however well some people think it's defined, can ever be so well-defined that you can say that and nothing else cause it — that meaning shaking." He is also concerned by the number of cases similar to one he reviewed in Arizona that he concluded that child likely died of natural causes not SBS stating, "I think I used the expression in my report, 'I wouldn't hang a cat on the evidence of shaking, as presented.' "<ref>http://www.npr.org/2011/06/29/137471992/rethinking-shaken-baby-syndrome</ref>  In 2012, Guthkelch went further, publishing an article "after 40 years of consideration," which is harshly critical of shaken baby prosecutions based solely on the triad of injuries.<ref>http://globalwrong.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/guthkelch-an-preface-to-narang-hous-j-health-law-poly-2012.pdf</ref>

==Legal issues==
In July 2005, the Court of Appeals in the [[United Kingdom]] heard four appeals of SBS convictions: one case was dropped, the sentence was reduced for one, and two convictions were upheld.<ref name="Leeuw07">{{Cite journal|author=De Leeuw M, Jacobs W |title=Shaken baby syndrome: The classical clinical triad is still valid in recent court rulings |journal=Critical Care |volume= 11|issue=Supplement 2 |page=416 |year= 2007|pmid=<!--none found--> |doi= 10.1186/cc5576|url=http://ccforum.com/content/11/S2/P416}}</ref>  The court found that the classic triad of retinal hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and acute [[encephalopathy]] are not 100% diagnostic of SBS and that clinical history is also important. In the Court's ruling, they upheld the clinical concept of SBS but dismissed one case and reduced another from murder to manslaughter.<ref name="Leeuw07"/> In their words: "Whilst a strong pointer to NAHI [non-accidental head injury] on its own we do not think it possible to find that it must automatically and necessarily lead to a diagnosis of NAHI. All the circumstances, including the clinical picture, must be taken into account."<ref>{{Cite news| author= | title=Shaken baby convictions overturned | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/child/story/0,,1533200,00.html  | work=Special Reports | date=Thursday July 21, 2005  | publisher=Guardian Unlimited | accessdate=2006-10-15}}</ref>

The court invalidated the "unified hypothesis", proposed by British physician J. F. Geddes and colleagues, as an alternative mechanism for the subdural and retinal hemorrhage found in suspected cases of SBS.<ref name="Leeuw07"/>  The unified hypothesis proposed that the hemorrhage was not caused by shearing of subdural and retinal veins but rather by cerebral [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], increased [[intracranial pressure]], and increased pressure in the brain's blood vessels.<ref name="Leeuw07"/>  The court reported that "the unified hypothesis [could] no longer be regarded as a credible or alternative cause of the triad of injuries": subdural haemorrhage, retinal bleeding and [[encephalopathy]] due to [[hypoxemia]] (low blood oxygen) found in suspected SBS.<ref name="Leeuw07"/>

On January 31, 2008, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals granted Audrey A. Edmonds a new trial based on "competing credible medical opinions in determining whether there is a reasonable doubt as to Edmunds's guilt." Specifically, the appeals court found that "Edmunds presented evidence that was not discovered until after her conviction, in the form of expert medical testimony, that a significant and legitimate debate in the medical community has developed in the past ten years over whether infants can be fatally injured through shaking alone, whether an infant may suffer head trauma and yet experience a significant lucid interval prior to death, and whether other causes may mimic the symptoms traditionally viewed as indicating shaken baby or shaken impact syndrome."<ref>{{Cite news| author= | title=Court of Appeals decision - State of Wisconsin v.

===Force===
There has been controversy regarding the amount of force required to produce the brain damage seen in shaken baby syndrome. A biomechanical experiment in 2005 demonstrated that "forceful shaking can severely injure or kill an infant, this is because the cervical spine would be severely injured and not because subdural hematomas would be caused by high head rotational accelerations... an infant head subjected to the levels of rotational velocity and acceleration called for in the SBS literature, would experience forces on the infant neck far exceeding the limits for structural failure of the cervical spine.
