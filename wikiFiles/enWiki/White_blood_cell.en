'''White blood cells''', or '''leukocytes''' (also spelled "leucocytes") are [[cell (biology)|cells]] of the [[immune system]] involved in defending the body against both [[infectious disease]] and foreign materials.

The number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of [[disease]]. There are normally approximately 7000 white blood cells per [[microliter]] of blood. They make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult.<ref name="alberts table">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=leukocyte,functions&rid=mboc4.table.4143|title=Leukocyte functions and percentage breakdown|accessdate=2007-04-14|publisher=NCBI Bookshelf|year=2005|author=Alberts, B.|work=Molecular Biology of the Cell}}</ref> An increase in the number of leukocytes over the [[Reference ranges for blood tests#White blood cells 2|upper limits]] is called [[leukocytosis]], and a decrease below the lower limit is called [[leukopenia]]. The physical properties of leukocytes, such as volume, [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], and [[granularity]], may change due to activation, the presence of immature cells, or the presence of [[Malignancy|malignant]] leukocytes in [[leukemia]], and may be reported as [[Cell Population Data]].

==Etymology==
The name "white blood cell" derives from the fact that after [[centrifugation]] of a blood sample, the white cells are found in the ''[[buffy coat]]'', a thin, typically white layer of nucleated cells between the sedimented [[red blood cells]] and the [[blood plasma]]. The scientific term ''leukocyte'' (from the [[Greek language|Greek word]] ''leuko-'' meaning "white" and ''kytos'' meaning "hollow vessel", with -cyte translated as "cell" in modern usage) directly reflects this description. [[Buffy coat]] may sometimes be green if there are large amounts of [[neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophils]] in the sample, due to the [[heme]]-containing enzyme [[myeloperoxidase]] that they produce.

==Types==
There are several different types of white blood cells. They all have many things in common, but are all distinct in form and function. A major distinguishing feature of some leukocytes is the presence of [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]]; white blood cells are often characterized as [[granulocyte]]s or [[agranulocyte]]s:
* '''Granulocytes''' (polymorphonuclear leukocytes): leukocytes characterized by the presence of differently staining [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] in their cytoplasm when viewed under light microscopy. These granules (usually [[lysozyme]]s) are [[Lipid membrane|membrane-bound]] enzymes that act primarily in the digestion of [[endocytosis|endocytosed]] particles. There are three types of granulocytes: [[Neutrophil granulocyte|neutrophil]]s, [[Basophil granulocyte|basophil]]s, and [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophil]]s, which are named according to their staining properties.
* '''Agranulocytes''' (mononuclear leukocytes): leukocytes characterized by the apparent absence of [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] in their [[cytoplasm]]. Although the name implies a lack of granules these cells do contain non-specific [[azurophilic granules]], which are [[lysosome]]s.<ref>{{Cite book

===Neutrophil===
{{Main|Neutrophil granulocyte}}
[[Image:Neutrophil with anthrax copy.jpg|210px|right|thumb|Neutrophil engulfing [[Bacillus anthracis|anthrax bacteria]].]]
Neutrophils defend against [[bacterial]] or [[fungal]] infection and other very small inflammatory processes that are usually first responders to microbial infection; their activity and death in large numbers forms [[pus]]. They are commonly referred to as polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, although, in the technical sense, PMN refers to all granulocytes. They have a multi-lobed nucleus that may appear like multiple nuclei, hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac. Neutrophils are very active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds. These cells are not able to renew their [[lysosome]]s (used in digesting microbes) and die after having phagocytosed a few pathogens.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wheater, Paul R.; Stevens, Alan |title=Wheater's basic histopathology: a colour atlas and text |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-443-07001-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=http://www.ecc-book.com/ACINFLMPDF1.pdf}}</ref> Neutrophils are the most common cell type seen in the early stages of acute inflammation, and make up 60-70% of total leukocyte count in human blood.<ref name="alberts table"/> The life span of a circulating human neutrophil is about 5.4 days.<ref>Pillay J, den Braber I, Vrisekoop N, Kwast LM, de Boer RJ, Borghans JA, Tesselaar K, Koenderman L. [http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/full/116/4/625 In vivo labeling with 2H2O reveals a human neutrophil lifespan of 5.4 days] Blood. 2010 Jul 29;116(4):625-7.</ref>

===Eosinophil===
{{Main|Eosinophil granulocyte}}
Eosinophils primarily deal with [[parasitic]] infections. Eosinophils are also the predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and also parasitic infections. In general, their nucleus is bi-lobed. The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with eosin stain.

===Basophil===
{{Main|Basophil granulocyte}}
Basophils are chiefly responsible for [[allergy|allergic]] and [[antigen]] response by releasing the chemical [[histamine]] causing [[vasodilation]]. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, but it is hard to see because of the number of coarse granules that hide it. They are characterized by their large blue granules.

===Lymphocyte===
{{Main|Lymphocyte}}
Lymphocytes are much more common in the lymphatic system. Lymphocytes are distinguished by having a deeply staining nucleus that may be eccentric in location, and a relatively small amount of cytoplasm. The blood has three types of lymphocytes:
* [[B cell]]s make [[antibody|antibodies]] that bind to [[pathogens]] to enable their destruction.
* [[T cell]]s:
**[[CD4|CD4+]] [[helper T cells]]: T cells having [[co-receptor]] [[CD4]] are known as CD4+ T cells. These cells bind [[antigens|antigen]] presented by [[antigen-presenting cells]] via [[T-cell receptor]] interacting with [[MHC II]] complex on [[Antigen-presenting cell|APC]]. Helper T cells coordinate the [[immune response]]. In  acute [[HIV]] infection, these T cells are the main index to identify the individual's immune system activity.
**[[CD8|CD8+]] [[cytotoxic T cells]]: T cells having co-receptor [[CD8]] are known as CD8+ T cells.  These cells bind antigens presented on [[MHC I]] complex of virus-infected or tumour cells and kill them. All nucleated cells possess MHC I on their surfaces.
**[[gamma/delta T cells|γδ T cell]]s possess an alternative [[T cell receptor]] as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ αβ T cells and share characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells.
* [[Natural killer cell]]s are able to kill cells of the body that have lost [[MHC I]] molecule, as they have been infected by a virus or have become cancerous.

===Monocyte===
{{Main|Monocyte}}
Monocytes share the "vacuum cleaner" ([[phagocytosis]]) function of neutrophils, but are much longer lived as they have an additional role: they present pieces of [[pathogen]]s to T cells so that the pathogens may be recognized again and killed, or so that an antibody response may be mounted. Monocytes eventually leave the bloodstream to become tissue macrophages, which remove dead cell debris as well as attacking microorganisms. Neither of these can be dealt with effectively by the neutrophils. Unlike neutrophils, monocytes are able to replace their [[lysosome|lysosomal]] contents and are thought to have a much longer active life. They have the kidney shaped nucleus and are typically agranulated. They also possess abundant cytoplasm.

Once monocytes move from the bloodstream out into the body tissues, they undergo changes (differentiate) allowing [[phagocytosis]] and are then known as [[macrophage]]s.

==Medication causing leukopenia==
Some medications can have an impact on the number and function of white blood cells. [[Leukopenia]] is the reduction in the number of white blood cells, which may affect the overall white cell count or one of the specific populations of white blood cells. For example, if the number of [[neutrophil]]s is low, the condition is known as [[neutropenia]]. Likewise, low [[lymphocyte]] levels are termed [[lymphopenia]]. Medications that can cause leukopenia include [[clozapine]], an [[antipsychotic]] medication with a rare adverse effect leading to the total absence of all granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils). Other medications include [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] drugs, such as [[sirolimus]], [[mycophenolate mofetil]], [[tacrolimus]], and [[cyclosporine]]. [[Interferons]] used to treat [[multiple sclerosis]], like [[Rebif]], [[Avonex]], and [[Betaseron]], can also cause leukopenia.

==Fixed leukocytes==
[[Image:Hematopoiesis simple.svg|thumb|420px|HSC=[[Hematopoietic stem cell]], Progenitor=[[Progenitor cell]], L-blast=[[Lymphoblast]], [[Lymphocyte]], Mo-blast=[[Monoblast]], [[Monocyte]], [[Myeloblast]], Pro-M=[[Promyelocyte]], [[Myelocyte]],  Meta-M=[[Metamyelocyte]], [[Neutrophil]], [[Eosinophil]], [[Basophil]], Pro-E=[[Proerythroblast]], Baso-E=[[Basophilic erythroblast]], poly-E=[[Polychromatic erythroblast]], Ortho-E=[[Orthochromatic erythroblast]], [[Erythrocyte]], [[Promegakaryocyte]], [[Megakaryocyte]], [[Platelet]]]]
Some leukocytes migrate into the tissues of the body to take up a permanent residence at that location rather than remaining in the blood. Often these cells have specific names depending upon which tissue they settle in, such as fixed macrophages in the liver, which become known as [[Kupffer cell]]s. These cells still serve a role in the immune system.
* [[Histiocyte]]s
* [[Dendritic cell]]s (Although these will often migrate to local lymph nodes upon ingesting antigens)
* [[Mast cell]]s
* [[Microglia]]
