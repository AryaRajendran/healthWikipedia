'''Situs ambiguus''' or '''situs ambiguous''' (the former spelling is more correct etymologically, but the latter spelling is very common), also known as '''heterotaxy''' or '''heterotaxia''', is a rare [[congenital]] defect in which the major [[viscera]]l [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] are distributed abnormally within the [[chest]] and [[abdomen]].  

The normal position of the organs is known as [[situs solitus]]; [[situs inversus]] is a condition in which the usual positions of the organs are reversed from left to right as a [[mirror image]] of the normal condition. If these are the two extreme positions on a continuum of asymmetric thoracic and abdominal organ formation, situs ambiguus covers everything in between.

==Presentation==
Classically, it comprises:
* [[heart|Cardiac]] looping malformations – commonly [[Tetralogy of Fallot|Fallot’s tetralogy]], [[transposition of the great vessels]], [[pulmonary valve stenosis]], and [[ventricular septal defect|ventricular]] and [[atrial septal defect]]s.
* Deranged abdominal organ asymmetry - the [[stomach]] and [[spleen]] are particularly prone to isolated reversal, and the stomach, [[liver]], and a single [[adrenal gland]] are occasionally found in the midline.
* Organ malformations - chiefly [[asplenia]]-[[polysplenia]], and more rarely a failure of the head of the [[pancreas]] to form, and horseshoe adrenals and [[horseshoe kidney|kidneys]].
* Rotation errors, causing [[volvulus]] and/or faulty [[peritoneum|peritoneal]] attachments.

More rarely, vascular abnormalities are found, including interrupted inferior vena cava, bilateral superior or inferior venae cavae, intrahepatic interruption of the inferior vena cava with connection to the [[azygos vein|azygos]] or [[hemiazygos vein]]s, and aberrant [[portal vein]]s.
