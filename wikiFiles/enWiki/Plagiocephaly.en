Plagiocephaly is the word that is used to describe a diagonal asymmetry across the head shape. This word particularly describes a flattening which is to one side at the back of the head and there is often some facial asymmetry. [[Brachycephaly]] describes a very wide head shape with a flattening across the whole back of the head.<ref>"Plagiocephaly and Brachycephaly" [http://www.technologyinmotion.com/plagiocephaly Technology in Motion Plagiocephaly Clinic]</ref>

==Causes==
Slight Plagiocephaly is routinely diagnosed at birth and may be the result of a restrictive [[uterus|intrauterine]] environment giving a "diamond" shaped head when seen from above. If there is premature union of skull bones, this is more properly called [[craniosynostosis]].

The incidence of plagiocephaly has increased dramatically since the advent of anti-[[Sudden infant death syndrome|Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] recommendations for parents to keep their babies on their backs.<ref name="PedView">"Plagiocephaly and related cranial deformities" Pediatric Views, April 2010 available online from  [http://www.childrenshospital.org/views/april10/plagiocephaly_and_related_cranial_deformities.html Children's Hospital Boston] accessed May 14, 2010</ref> Treatments range from a simple repositioning of babies below the age of 5 months to more involved treatment with a helmet for children under the age of 18 months.<ref name="Pediatrics 128"/>

==Prognosis==
Preliminary research indicates that babies with plagiocephaly tend to have learning difficulties later on in school, however these studies are still early, and do not yet represent a scientific consensus.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/12/03/flat-headed-babies-development.html | work=CBC News | title=Flat-headed babies may face learning problems | date=December 3, 2010}}</ref>  Other more complete studies suggest that there is no evidence to suggest that plagiocephaly is harmful to brain development, vision, or hearing.<ref name=PedView/>

==Treatment==
The condition will sometimes improve as the baby grows, but in many cases, treatment can significantly improve the shape of a baby’s head. Initially, treatment usually takes the form of reducing the pressure on the affected area through repositioning of the baby onto his or her abdomen for extended periods of time throughout the day.
<ref>{{cite web|title=What is tummy time?|url=http://steeperclinic.com/starband/tummy_time|work=RSLSteeper}}</ref>  
Other treatments include repositioning the child's head throughout the day so that the rounded side of the head is placed dependent against the mattress, repositioning cribs and other areas that infants spend time in so that they will have to look in a different direction to see their parents, or others in the room, repositioning mobiles and other toys for similar reasons, and avoiding extended time sleeping in car-seats (when not in a vehicle), bouncy seats, or other supine seating which is thought to exacerbate the problem.  If the child appears to have discomfort or cries when they are repositioned, they may have a problem with the neck.<ref name="Pediatrics 112">{{cite journal|pmid=12837890 | volume=112 | issue=1 Pt 1 | title=Prevention and management of positional skull deformities in infants.

For years, infants have been successfully treated with cranial remolding orthoses.
A cranial remolding orthosis (helmet) provides painless total contact over the prominent areas of the skull and leaves voids over the flattened areas to provide a pathway for more symmetrical skull growth. Treatment generally takes 3–4 months, but varies depending on the infant's age and severity of the cranial asymmetry.
