He trained as a doctor at the [[University of Delhi]] and then the Central Institute for Advanced Medical Studies in [[Moscow]] from 1973 to 1982 where he studied [[iridology]], tongue diagnosis, [[pulse diagnosis]], fasting therapy and [[naturopathy]].<ref name=Telegraph/> After a stint in rural India studying [[homeopathy]], [[herbalism]] and medical [[fasting]], and working in [[Hong Kong]] at the Vital Life Centre from 1988 until May 1991, he came to [[London]] to work at the Hale Clinic where his therapies reportedly proved successful for patients such as [[Sarah Miles]] and [[Ava Gardner]].
