In 1999, a study by the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] examined the definition of sex based on a 1991 random sample of 599 college students from 29 U.S. states; it reported that while "virtually every college student they surveyed considered penile-vaginal intercourse to be sex," and only 19–20&nbsp;percent said that anal intercourse was not sex, 60%<!--Note: First news source says nearly 600 college students and 59%; second news source says 599 college students and 60%.--> said oral-genital contact ([[fellatio]], [[cunnilingus]]) did not constitute having sex.<ref name="McAnulty"/><ref name="Kauth">{{cite book | title = True Nature: A Theory of Sexual Attraction | publisher = [[Springer Publishing|Springer]] | year = 2000 | page = 74 | accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0306463903,| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=PzDKr-qCdTAC&pg=PA74&dq=Stephanie+Sanders+students+sex&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QoaDUf3LBMXG0gHukYDYDA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Stephanie%20Sanders%20students%20sex&f=false|quote=| author = Michael R Kauth}}</ref><ref name="Cox"/><ref name="Jayson">{{cite news|first=Sharon|last=Jayson| title='Technical virginity' becomes part of teens' equation|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=2005-10-19|accessdate=2009-08-07|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-10-19-teens-technical-virginity_x.htm}}</ref> Similarly, a 2003 study published in the ''[[Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality]]'' focusing on definitions of having sex and noting studies concerning university students from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia reported that "[w]hile the vast majority of respondents (more than 97%) in these three studies included penile-vaginal intercourse in their definition of sex, fewer (between 70% and 90%) respondents considered penile-anal intercourse to constitute having sex" and that "oral-genital behaviours were defined as sex by between 32% and 58% of respondents".<ref name="Randall"/> 

A different study by the Kinsey Institute sampled 484 people, ranging in ages 18–96. "Nearly 95 percent of people in the study agreed that penile-vaginal intercourse meant 'had sex.' But the numbers changed as the questions got more specific." 11 percent of respondents based "had sex" on whether the man had achieved an [[orgasm]], concluding that absence of an orgasm does not constitute "having had" sex. "About 80 percent of respondents said penile-anal intercourse meant 'had sex.' About 70 percent of people believed oral sex was sex."<ref name="Cox"/>

===Bonding and affection===
In animals, copulation ranges from a purely reproductive activity to one of emotional bonding between mated pairs. Sexual intercourse and other sexual activity typically play a strong role in [[human bonding]]. For example, in many societies, it is normal for couples to have frequent intercourse while using some method of [[birth control]] (contraception), sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy.<ref name="Diamond"/>

In humans and [[bonobo]]s, the female undergoes relatively [[concealed ovulation]] so that both male and female partners commonly do not know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One possible reason for this distinct biological feature may be formation of strong emotional bonds between sexual partners important for social interactions and, in the case of humans, long-term partnership rather than immediate sexual reproduction.<ref name="Diamond"/>

Humans, bonobos, [[dolphin]]s, and [[chimpanzee]]s are all intelligent social animals, whose cooperative behavior proves significantly more successful than that of any individual alone. In these animals, the use of sex has evolved beyond reproduction, to apparently serve additional social functions.<ref name=FransDeWaal/><ref name="Bailey"/><ref name="Bagemihl"/> Sex reinforces intimate social bonds between individuals to form larger social structures. The resulting cooperation encourages collective tasks that promote the survival of each member of the group.<ref name="Diamond"/>

===Duration and sexual difficulties===
{{see also|Intravaginal ejaculation latency time}}
Sexual intercourse often ends when the man has ejaculated, and thus the partner might not have time to reach [[orgasm]]. In addition, [[premature ejaculation]] (PE) is common, and women often require a substantially longer duration of stimulation with a sexual partner than men do before reaching an orgasm.<ref name="Weiten, 2011"/><ref name="Premature ejaculation">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/premature-ejaculation/DS00578|title=Premature ejaculation|publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]].com|accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref><ref name="Anorgasmia">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/anorgasmia/DS01051 |title=Anorgasmia in women|publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]].com|date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}</ref> [[Masters and Johnson]] found that men took about 4 minutes to reach orgasm with their partners; women took about 10–20 minutes to reach orgasm with their partners, but 4 minutes to reach orgasm when they masturbated.<ref name="Weiten, 2011"/> Scholars state "many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse [vaginal sex]" and that "[e]ven the word ''foreplay'' suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event.'... ...Because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men, they are more likely than men to have faked an orgasm".<ref name="Weiten, 2011"/>  

In 1991, scholars from the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]] stated, "The truth is that the time between penetration and ejaculation varies not only from man to man, but from one time to the next for the same man." They added that the appropriate length for intercourse is the length of time it takes for both partners to be mutually satisfied, emphasizing that Kinsey "found that 75 percent of men ejaculated within two minutes of penetration. But he didn't ask if the men or their partners considered two minutes mutually satisfying" and "more recent research reports slightly longer times for intercourse".<ref name="Reinisch">{{cite book | title = The Kinsey Institute New Report On Sex| publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | year = 1991 | pages = 129–130| accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0312063865,| url = http://books.google.com/?id=KsW6wPiXEd0C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=The+truth+is+that+the+time+between+penetration+and+ejaculation+varies+not+only+from+man+to+man,+but+from+one+time+to+the+next+for+the+same+man.#v=onepage&q=The%20truth%20is%20that%20the%20time%20between%20penetration%20and%20ejaculation%20varies%20not%20only%20from%20man%20to%20man%2C%20but%20from%20one%20time%20to%20the%20next%20for%20the%20same%20man.&f=false | author = June M.

Premature ejaculation is more common than erectile dysfunction. "Estimates vary, but as many as 1 out of 3 men may be affected by [premature ejaculation] at some time."<ref name="Premature ejaculation"/> "Masters and Johnson speculated that premature ejaculation is the most common sexual dysfunction, even though more men seek therapy for erectile difficulties." This is because "although an estimated 15 percent to 20 percent of men experience difficulty controlling rapid ejaculation, most do not consider it a problem requiring help, and many women have difficulty expressing their sexual needs".<ref name="Reinisch"/> The [[American Urological Association]] (AUA) estimates that premature ejaculation could affect 21 percent of men in the United States.<ref>Erectile Dysfunction Guideline Update Panel.

===Reproduction, reproductive methods and pregnancy ===
Reproduction among humans usually occurs with penile-vaginal penetration.<ref name="Evan Jones">{{cite book|title=Human Reproductive Biology|isbn =0120884658,|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|year=2006|pages=604 pages|accessdate=November 8, 2012|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pfiZfui2XLIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Reproduction+in+humans#v=onepage&q=Reproduction%20in%20humans&f=false|author=Richard Evan Jones, Kristin H. López}}</ref> Male orgasm usually includes [[ejaculation]], a series of muscular [[Muscle contraction|contractions]] that deliver [[semen]] containing male gametes known as [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] cells or spermatozoa from the penis into the vagina. The subsequent route of the sperm from the vault of the vagina is through the [[cervix]] and into the [[uterus]], and then into the [[fallopian tube]]s. Millions of sperm are present in each ejaculation, to increase the chances of one fertilizing an egg or [[ovum]] (see [[sperm competition]]). When a fertile ovum from the female is present in the fallopian tubes, the male gamete joins with the ovum, resulting in [[fertilisation|fertilization]] and the formation of a new [[embryo]]. When a fertilized ovum reaches the uterus, it becomes implanted in the lining of the uterus – known as the [[endometrium]] – and a [[pregnancy]] begins.<ref name="Evan Jones"/> Unlike most species, human sexual activity is not linked to periods of [[estrus]] and can take place at any time during the reproductive cycle, even during pregnancy.<ref>{{Cite book| author = [[Jared Diamond]] | title = [[Why Is Sex Fun?]] | year = 1997 | publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 0-465-03127-7}}</ref> Where a [[sperm donor]] has sexual intercourse with a woman who is not his partner, for the sole purpose of impregnating the woman, this may be known as natural [[insemination]], as opposed to [[artificial insemination]].

In 2005, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimated that 123 million women become pregnant world-wide each year, and around 87 million of those pregnancies or 70.7% are unintentional.

Surrogacy is an arrangement in which a woman carries and delivers a child for another couple or person. The woman may be the child's genetic mother (traditional surrogacy) or she may carry a pregnancy to delivery after having another woman's eggs transferred to her uterus (gestational surrogacy). Gay or lesbian pairings who want the host to have no genetic connection to the child may choose gestational surrogacy and enter into a contract with an [[Egg donation|egg donor]]. Gay male couples might decide that they should both contribute semen for the [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF) process, which further establishes the couple's joint intention to become parents.<ref name="Burda"/> Lesbian couples often have contracts drafted to extinguish the legal rights of the sperm donor, while creating legal rights for the parent who is not biologically related to the child.<ref name="Schaffner">{{Cite book| title = Regulating sex: the politics of intimacy and identity.

===Safe sex and contraception ===
{{See also|Coitus interruptus}}
There are a variety of [[safe sex]] practices, including non-penetrative sex acts,<ref name="Durham"/><ref name="aids.gov"/> and heterosexual couples may use oral or anal sex (or both) as a means of [[birth control]] (contraception).<ref name="Crooks"/><ref name="Regnerus"/><ref>{{Cite pmid|12401976}}</ref> Safe sex is a relevant [[harm reduction]] philosophy,<ref name="Who"/><ref>{{cite web| title = STI Epi Update: Oral Contraceptive and Condom Use| url = http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/std-mts/std511_e.html| publisher = [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]| date = 1998-04-23| accessdate = 2007-07-11}}</ref> and [[condom]]s are used as a form of safe sex and contraception.

===Prevalence of sexual activity===
In 2003, Michael Bozon of the French [[Institut national d'études démographiques]] conducted a cross-cultural study titled ''At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?.'' In the first group of the contemporary cultures he studied, which included [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (listing [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Ethiopia]]), the data indicated that the age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital; the study considered the [[Indian subcontinent]] to also fall into this group, though data was only available from [[Nepal]].<ref name="Bozon">{{cite journal |last=Bozon |first=Michael|year=2003 |title=At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?

However, sons are encouraged to gain experience with older women or prostitutes before marriage. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at lower ages than that of women; this group includes Latin cultures, both from [[southern Europe]] ([[Portugal]], [[Greece]] and [[Romania]] are noted) and from [[Latin America]] ([[Brazil]], [[Chile]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]). The study considered many Asian societies to also fall into this group, although matching data was only available from [[Thailand]].<ref name="Bozon"/> In the third group, age of men and women at sexual initiation was more closely matched; there were two sub-groups, however. In non-Latin, Catholic countries ([[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] are mentioned), age at sexual initiation was higher, suggesting later marriage and reciprocal valuing of male and female virginity. The same pattern of late marriage and reciprocal valuing of virginity was reflected in [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The study considered [[China]] and [[Vietnam]] to also fall into this group, though data were not available.<ref name="Bozon"/> In northern and eastern European countries, age at sexual initiation was lower, with both men and women involved in sexual activity before any union formation; the study listed [[Switzerland]], Germany and the [[Czech Republic]] as members of this group.<ref name="Bozon"/>

===Risks===
[[Sexually transmitted disease|Sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) can be spread by person-to-person sexual contact, especially penetrative sexual intercourse. There are 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted infections every year in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|title=STD Trends in the United States: 2010 National Data for Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and Syphilis|url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/trends.htm|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> and, in 2005, the World Health Organization estimated that 448 million people aged 15–49 were being infected a year with curable STIs such as [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]].<ref name=WHO-2011>{{cite web|title=Sexually transmitted infections|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs110/en/index.html|work=Fact sheet N° 110|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=8 September 2012|month=August|year=2011}}</ref> In 2006, ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper reported that the biggest rise in sexually transmitted infections was in syphilis, which rose by more than 20%, while increases were also seen in cases of [[genital warts]] and [[herpes]].<ref name="Thompson">{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Jonathan|title=New safe sex ads target teens 'on the pull'|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=November 12, 2006|accessdate=March 27, 2013|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/new-safe-sex-ads-target-teens-on-the-pull-423977.html}}</ref> 

STIs are caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[parasite]]s, which are passed from person to person during sexual contact. Some, in particular [[HIV]] and syphilis, can also be passed in other ways including from mother to child during pregnancy and [[childbirth]], through [[blood product]]s, and by shared [[hypodermic needle]]s.<ref name=WHO-2011/> [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|Gonococcal]] or chlamydial infections often produce no symptoms at all. Untreated chlamydial infection can lead to female infertility and [[ectopic pregnancy]]. [[Human papillomavirus]] can lead to genital and [[cervical cancer]]s. [[Syphilis]] can result in [[stillbirth]]s and neonatal deaths. Untreated gonococcal infections result in miscarriages, [[preterm birth]]s and [[perinatal death]]s. Infants born to mothers with untreated gonorrhoea or chlamydia can develop [[Neonatal conjunctivitis|serious eye infections]], which can lead to blindness.<ref name=WHO-2011/> [[Hepatitis B]] can also be transmitted through sexual contact.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/HBVfaq.htm#treatment CDC Hepatitis B Information for Health Professionals] Accessed May 27, 2010</ref> Globally, there are about 350 million chronic carriers of hepatitis B.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hepatitis B|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index1.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>

Some STIs can cause [[Genital ulcer|ulceration]], but even if they do not, they increase the risk of both acquiring and passing on HIV up to ten-fold.<ref name=WHO-2011/> HIV is one of the world's leading infectious killers, and, in 2010, approximately 30 million people were estimated to have died because of it since the beginning of the epidemic. Of the 2.7 million new [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV infections]] estimated to occur worldwide in 2010, 1.9 million (70%) were in [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|Africa]].

The most effective way to avoid sexually transmitted infections is to abstain from sexual intercourse, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex, or to have sexual intercourse only with one long-term, uninfected partner who also remains entirely [[Monogamy|monogamous]]. The World Health Organization states, "Male latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in reducing the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and [[trichomoniasis]]."<ref name=WHO-2011/> In cases where infection is suspected, early medical intervention is highly beneficial in all cases.

People, especially those who get little or no physical exercise, have a slightly increased risk of triggering [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] or [[sudden cardiac death]] when they engage in sexual intercourse, or any other vigorous physical exercise which is engaged in on a sporadic basis. Increased risk is temporary with incidents occurring within a few hours of the activity. Regular exercise reduces but does not eliminate the increased risk.<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors=Dahabreh IJ, Paulus JK |date= |year=2011 |month=March |title=Association of episodic physical and sexual activity with triggering of acute cardiac events: Systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=JAMA |volume=305 |series= |issue= 12 |pages= 1225–1233|chapter= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link=  |isbn= |issn= |pmid= 21427375|pmc= |bibcode= |doi=10.1001/jama.2011.336 |accessdate=March 23, 2011 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/305/12/1225.abstract |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=Acute cardiac events were significantly associated with episodic physical and sexual activity; this association was attenuated among persons with high levels of habitual physical activity |ref= |last1= Dahabreh |first1= I.

Some researchers, such as [[Alex Comfort]], posit three potential advantages of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational.<ref name="Diamond"/><ref name="Comfort">''[[The Joy of Sex]]'': A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking (1972)</ref> While the development of the birth-control pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid- and late 20th century increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, they still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have sexual intercourse while contracepting not only to experience sexual pleasure (recreational), but also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of sexual intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).<ref name="Comfort"/>

====Adolescents====
With regard to [[adolescent sexuality]], sexual intercourse is often for relational and recreational purposes as well.

One group of [[Canada|Canadian]] researchers found a relationship between self-esteem and sexual activity. They found that students, especially girls, who were verbally abused by teachers or rejected by their peers were more likely than other students to engage in sex by the end of the Grade 7. The researchers speculate that low self-esteem increases the likelihood of sexual activity: "low self-esteem seemed to explain the link between peer rejection and early sex. Girls with a poor self-image may see sex as a way to become 'popular', according to the researchers".<ref name="Peer rejection">{{cite web|title=Peer rejection tied to early sex in pre-teens|format=PDF |work=Issue Update|publisher=[[MedlinePlus]]|year=2002 |month=October|accessdate=August 5, 2011|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_55689.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011012252/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_55689.html|archivedate=2007-10-11}}</ref>

In [[India]], there is growing evidence that adolescents are becoming more sexually active outside of marriage, which is feared to lead to an increase in the spread of HIV/AIDS among adolescents, as well as the number of [[Unintended pregnancy|unwanted pregnancies]] and abortions, and add to the conflict between contemporary social values. In India, adolescents have relatively poor access to health care and education, and with cultural norms opposing extramarital sexual behavior, "these implications may acquire threatening dimensions for the society and the nation".<ref name="india girls">{{cite web|url=http://iussp2005.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=50332|title=Socio-psychological Constructs of Premarital Sex Behavior among Adolescent Girls in India|publisher=Princeton University|author=R.S.Goya, Indian Institute of Health Management Research, Jaipur, India|work=Abstract|format=PDF|year=2005|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>

Not all views on adolescent sexual behavior are negative, however. Psychiatrist [[Lynn Ponton]] writes, "All adolescents have sex lives, whether they are sexually active with others, with themselves, or seemingly not at all," and that viewing adolescent sexuality as a potentially positive experience, rather than as something inherently dangerous, may help young people develop healthier patterns and make more positive choices regarding sexual activity.<ref name="sex lives3" /> Similarly, others state that long-term romantic relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life<ref>Madsen S., Collins W. A. (2005). Differential predictions of young adult romantic relationships from transitory vs. longer romantic experiences during adolescence. Presented at ''Biennial Meeting of the Society for Research on Child Development'', Atlanta, GA.</ref> and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits.

While sexual intercourse is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to [[religion and sexuality|religious]] and governmental laws. Some governments and religions also have strict designations of "appropriate" and "inappropriate" sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible. A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex.<ref>William N. Eskridge Jr. Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America, 1861–2003. (2008) Viking Adult.

Most developed countries have [[age of consent]] laws specifying the minimum legal age a person may engage in sexual intercourse with substantially older persons, usually set at about 16–18, while the legal age of consent ranges from 12–20 years of age or is not a matter of law in other countries.<ref>Karen L.

The expression "sexual intercourse" has been used as a term of art in [[England and Wales]] and [[New York State]]. In England and Wales, from its enactment to its repeal on the 1 May 2004,<ref>The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2004]] (S.I. 2004/874)</ref> [[Sexual Offences Act 1956#Section 44|section 44]] of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] read:

;Penetration
According to cases decided on the meaning of the statutory definition of [[carnal knowledge]] under the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], which was in identical terms to this definition, the slightest penetration was sufficient.<ref>R v R'Rue (1838) 8 C & P 641; R v Allen (1839) 9 C & P 31</ref> The book "Archbold" said that it "submitted" that this continued to be the law under the new enactment.<ref>[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 20–24</ref>

For most definitions of rape, there is a broad "conceptualization of sex, including many kinds of sexual penetration (e.g., penile-vaginal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, anal intercourse, or penetration of the genitals or rectum by an object)".<ref name="Francoeur"/>

Section 7(2) of the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976]] contained the following words: "In this Act . . . references to sexual intercourse shall be construed in accordance with section 44 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 so far as it relates to natural intercourse (under which such intercourse is deemed complete on proof of penetration only)". The Act made provision, in relation to rape and related offences, for England and Wales, and for courts-martial elsewhere.

From 3 November 1994 to 1 May 2004, section 1(2)(a) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (as substituted by section 142 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]) referred to "sexual intercourse with a person (whether vaginal or anal)". This section created the offence of [[Rape in English law#History|rape in England and Wales]].

The penal code in New York State provides: § 130.00 Sex offenses; definitions of terms: 1.

===Romantic relationships===

====Sexual orientation and gender====
There are various legal positions regarding the definition and legality of sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex or gender. For example, in the 2003 [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] case [[Blanchflower v. Blanchflower]], it was held that [[Lesbian sexual practices|female same-sex sexual relations]] did not constitute sexual intercourse, based on a 1961 definition from ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]''; and thereby an accused wife in a divorce case was found not guilty of [[adultery]]. Some countries, such as [[LGBT topics and Islam|Islamic countries]], consider homosexual behavior to be an offense punishable by imprisonment or execution.<ref>Janet Afary. Sexual Politics in Modern Iran. (2009) [[Cambridge University Press]]. ISBN 0-521-89846-3</ref>

====Marriage and relationships====
Sexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a [[marriage]]; many religious customs required [[consummation]] of the marriage by sexual intercourse, and the failure for any reason to consummate the marriage was a ground for [[annulment]], which did not require a divorce process. Annulment declaration implied that the marriage was void from the start – i.e. there was in law no marriage. Furthermore, continuing sexual relations between the marriage partners is commonly considered a 'marital right' by many religions, permissible to married couples, generally for the purpose of reproduction. Today, there is wide variation in the opinions and teachings about sexual intercourse relative to marriage and other intimate relationships by the world's religions. Examples:
*Most denominations of [[Christianity]], including [[Catholicism]],<ref name=Akin/> have strict views or rules on what sexual practices are acceptable or, more specifically, what are not.<ref name=ChristianView1>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Janet E|title=The Christian View of Sex:  A Time for Apologetics, Not Apologies – by Janet E Smith, University of Dallas|url=http://www.nfpoutreach.org/sex.htm|publisher=Natural Family Planning Outreach|accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> Most Christian views on sex are formed or influenced by various interpretations of the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Jim and Carrie|title=Christian Views on Sex|url=http://www.the-intimate-couple.com/christian-views-on-sex.html|publisher=The Intimate Couple|accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> Sex outside of marriage is considered a [[sin]] in some churches, and sex may be referred to as a "sacred covenant" between husband and wife. Historically, Christian teachings often promoted [[celibacy]],<ref name=Family>{{cite web|title=Christianity and Sex|url=http://www.thefamilyinternational.org/dossier/books/book5/main.htm|work=Books and Articles: Scholarly Publications on The Family|publisher=The Family International (in Family Dossier)|accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> although today usually only certain members (for example certain [[celibacy of the clergy|religious leaders]]) of some groups take a vow of celibacy, forsaking both marriage and any type of sexual or romantic activity. Some Christians view sex, particularly sexual intercourse between a married couple, as "holy" or a "holy sacrament".<ref name=Akin /><ref name=Family /> Some Christians interpret the Bible to forbid the "misuse of sexual organs" and take that to mean that only penile-vaginal penetration is acceptable, while some argue that the Bible is not clear on oral sex and that it is a personal decision as to whether its acceptable within marriage.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Ross|title=Oral Sex Within Marriage|url=http://www.apocalipsis.org/masturbation.htm#oral|work=Masturbation and Oral Sex: A Christian Approach|accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref>
* In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], or [[Mormonism]], sexual relations within the bonds of matrimony are seen as beautiful and sacred. Mormons consider sexual relations to be ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife.  Members are encouraged to not have any sexual relations before marriage, and be completely faithful to their spouse after marriage.<ref>''[https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/sexual-purity?lang=eng For the Strength of Youth: Sexual Purity]''</ref>
* In [[Judaism]], a married Jewish man is required to provide his wife with sexual pleasure called ''onah'' (literally, "her time"), which is one of the conditions he takes upon himself as part of the Jewish marriage contract, ''[[ketubah]]'', that he gives her during the Jewish wedding ceremony.  In [[Jewish views on marriage]], sexual desire is not evil, but must be satisfied in the proper time, place and manner.<ref>{{cite web|last=Judaism 101:|title=Kosher Sex|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm|accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

Shi'ia women are allowed to enter only one marriage at a time, whether temporary or permanent.
* [[Wicca]]ns believe that, as declared within the [[Charge of the Goddess]], to "''Let my'' [the Goddess] ''worship be within the heart that rejoiceth; for behold, all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals.''" This statement appears to allow one freedom to explore sensuality and pleasure, and mixed with the final maxim within the [[Wiccan Rede]] – "''26. Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill – an’ it harm none, do what ye will.''"<ref>Thompson, Lady Gwen; ''Wiccan-Pagan Potpourri''; Green Egg, №69; Ostara 1974</ref> – Wiccans are encouraged to be responsible with their sexual encounters, in whatever variety they may occur.<ref>Hans Holzer.

* [[Shakers]] believe that sexual intercourse is the root of all sin and that all people should therefore be celibate, including married couples. Predictably, the original Shaker community that peaked at 6,000 full members in 1840 dwindled to [[Shakers#Modern-day Shakers|three members by 2009]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Last Ones Standing|author=Chase, Stacey|date=July 23, 2006|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2006/07/23/the_last_ones_standing/?page=full}}</ref>

In some cases, the sexual intercourse between two people is seen as counter to religious law or doctrine. In many religious communities, including the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Bhikkhu|Mahayana Buddhists]], religious leaders are expected to refrain from sexual intercourse in order to devote their full attention, energy, and loyalty to their religious duties.<ref>William Skudlarek.

[[File:Housefly mating.jpg|thumb|Mating [[Housefly|houseflies]]]]
With regard to [[zoology]], ''copulation'' is often termed as the process in which a male introduces [[sperm]] into the female's body.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="Copulation1"/> [[Spider]]s have separate male and female sexes. Before mating and copulation, a male spins a small web and [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]]s on to it. He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large [[pedipalp]]s, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals. Females can store sperm indefinitely.<ref name="RFB2004Spiders">{{cite book | author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7|isbn=0-03-025982-7| year=2004|pages=571–584 | chapter=Chelicerata: Araneae}}</ref>

Many animals which live in water use [[external fertilization]], whereas [[internal fertilization]] may have developed from a need to maintain [[gamete]]s in a liquid medium in the [[Late Ordovician]] epoch. Internal fertilization with many vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) occur via [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]), while [[mammal]]s copulate vaginally, and many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s reproduce sexually with external fertilization.

However, some [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[arthropod]]s do use external fertilization. For primitive [[insect]]s, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure; [[courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening, but there is no actual copulation. In groups such as [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]] and spiders, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female. In dragonflies, it is a set of modified [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]] on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male pedipalps. In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its [[aedeagus]], a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a "[[spermatophore]]") into the female's reproductive tract.

Humans, bonobos,<ref name = "FransDeWaal">[[Frans de Waal]], "Bonobo Sex and Society", ''[[Scientific American]]'' (March 1995)  82–86.</ref> chimpanzees and dolphins<ref name=Bailey/> are species known to engage in heterosexual behaviors even when the female is not in estrus, which is a point in her reproductive cycle suitable for successful impregnation. These species, and others, are also known to engage in homosexual behaviors.<ref name=Bagemihl/> Humans, bonobos and dolphins are all intelligent social animals, whose cooperative behavior proves far more successful than that of any individual alone. In these animals, the use of sexual intercourse has evolved beyond reproduction, to apparently serve additional social functions. Sexual activity reinforces intimate social bonds between individuals to form larger social structures. The resulting cooperation encourages collective tasks that promote the survival of each member of the group.<ref name="Diamond"/>
