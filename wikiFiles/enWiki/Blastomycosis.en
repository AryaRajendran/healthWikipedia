'''Blastomycosis''' (also known as "North American blastomycosis," "Blastomycetic dermatitis," and "Gilchrist's disease"<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|page=319}}</ref>) is a fungal infection caused by the organism ''[[Blastomyces dermatitidis]]''. [[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]] to portions of [[North America]], blastomycosis causes clinical symptoms similar to [[histoplasmosis]].<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | pages = 676&ndash;8 |publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref>

== Cause ==
''B. dermatitidis'' is asexual form of Ajellomyces dermatitidis. (These can be differentiated on basis of presence or absence of "A Antigen", ''B. dermatitidis'' being positive for it.) It is a dimorphic fungus.

==Pathogenesis==
[[Image:Blastomycosis cropped.JPG|thumb|Blastomyces dermatitidis from a lesion in dog.]]
Inhaled conidia of ''B. dermatitidis'' are [[phagocytosed]] by neutrophils and macrophages in alveoli. Some of these escape phagocytosis and transform into yeast phase rapidly. Having thick walls, these are resistant to phagocytosis and express glycoprotein '''BAD-1''', which is a virulence factor as well as an epitope. In lung tissue, they multiply and may disseminate through blood and [[lymphatics]] to other organs, including the skin, bone, genitourinary tract, and brain. The incubation period is 30 to 100 days, although infection can be asymptomatic.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Blastomycosis can present in one of the following ways:

* a flu-like illness with fever, chills, [[arthralgia]] (joint pain), [[myalgia]] (muscle pain), headache, and a nonproductive cough which resolves within days.
* an acute illness resembling bacterial [[pneumonia]], with symptoms of high fever, chills, a productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain.
* a chronic illness that mimics tuberculosis or lung cancer, with symptoms of low-grade fever, a productive cough, night sweats, and weight loss.
* a fast, progressive, and severe disease that manifests as [[ARDS]], with fever, shortness of breath, [[tachypnea]], [[hypoxemia]], and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.
* skin lesions, usually asymptomatic, can be verrucous (wart-like) or ulcerated with small pustules at the margins.
* bone lytic lesions can cause bone or joint pain.
* [[prostatitis]] may be asymptomatic or may cause pain on urinating.
* laryngeal involvement causes hoarseness.
* 40% immunocompromised individuals have [[Central nervous system|CNS]] involvement and present as [[brain abscess]], epidural abscess or [[meningitis]].

== Diagnosis ==

Once suspected, the diagnosis of '''blastomycosis''' can usually be confirmed by demonstration of the characteristic broad based budding organisms<ref name="pmid12375640">{{cite journal |author=Veligandla SR, Hinrichs SH, Rupp ME, Lien EA, Neff JR, Iwen PC |title=Delayed diagnosis of osseous blastomycosis in two patients following environmental exposure in nonendemic areas |journal=Am. J. Clin. Pathol. |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=536–41 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12375640 |doi=10.1309/JEJ0-3N98-C3G8-21DE |url=http://ajcp.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=0002-9173&volume=118&issue=4&spage=536}}</ref> in  sputum or tissues by KOH prep, cytology, or histology. Tissue biopsy of skin or other organs may be required in order to diagnose extra-pulmonary disease. Blastomycosis is histologically associated with granulomatous nodules. Commercially available urine antigen testing appears to be quite sensitive in suggesting the diagnosis in cases where the organism is not readily detected. While culture of the organism remains the definitive diagnostic standard, its slow growing nature can lead to delays in treatment of up to several weeks.

However, sometimes blood and sputum cultures may not detect blastomycosis;<ref>{{cite web

== Treatment ==

[[Itraconazole]] given orally is the treatment of choice for most forms of the disease.  [[Ketoconazole]] may also be used.  Cure rates are high, and the treatment over a period of months is usually well tolerated. [[Amphotericin B]] is considerably more toxic, and is usually reserved for immunocompromised patients who are critically ill and those with central nervous system disease. Patients who cannot tolerate deoxycholate formulation of Amphotericin B can be given lipid formulations. [[Fluconazole]] has excellent CNS penetration and is useful where there is CNS involvement after initial treatment with Amphotericin B.

== Prognosis ==

Mortality rate in treated cases

* 0-2% in treated cases among immunocompetent patients
* 29% in immunocompromised patients
* 40% in the subgroup of patients with AIDS
* 68% in patients presenting as [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] ([[ARDS]])

== Epidemiology ==

In the United States, blastomycosis is endemic in the [[Mississippi river]] and [[Ohio river]] basins and around the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]]. The annual incidence is less than 1 case per 100,000 people in [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Arkansas]]. The cases are greater in northern states such as [[Wisconsin]], where from 1986 to 1995 there were 1.4 cases per 100,000 people.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Blastomycosis--Wisconsin, 1986-1995 |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=45 |issue=28 |pages=601–3 |year=1996 |pmid=8676851 |doi= |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> It also frequently affects hunting dogs in northern Wisconsin and the upper Mississippi and Wisconsin Rivers.<ref>Pet Center [http://www.thepetcenter.com/gen/blasto.html Blasto in Dogs]</ref>

In [[Canada]], most cases of blastomycosis occur in [[Northwestern Ontario]], particularly around the [[Kenora]]  and areas like Killarney (Georgian Bay) Area. The moist, acidic soil in the surrounding woodland harbors the fungus.

Blastomycosis is distributed internationally; cases are sometimes reported from [[Africa]].<ref name = Alvarez_2006>{{cite journal |author=Alvarez G, Burns B, Desjardins M, Salahudeen S, AlRashidi F, Cameron D |title=Blastomycosis in a young African man presenting with a pleural effusion |journal=Can Respir J |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=441–4 |year=2006 |pmid=17149463 |pmc=2683332}}</ref>

== History ==

Blastomycosis was first described by Thomas Casper Gilchrist<ref name="urlThomas Caspar Gilchrist (www.whonamedit.com)">{{cite web |url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2763.html |title=Thomas Caspar Gilchrist (www.whonamedit.com) |work= |accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref> in 1894 and sometimes goes by the eponym ''Gilchrist's disease''.<ref name="urlGilchrists disease (www.whonamedit.com)">{{cite web |url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/3327.html |title=Gilchrist's disease (www.whonamedit.com) |work= |accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref> It is also sometimes referred to as Chicago Disease.
