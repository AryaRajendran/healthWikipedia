'''Specific language impairment''' ('''SLI''') is diagnosed when a child's language does not develop normally and the difficulties cannot be accounted for by generally slow development, physical abnormality of the speech apparatus, autistic disorder, acquired brain damage or hearing loss.

==Classification==
Specific language impairment (SLI) is diagnosed when a child has delayed or disordered language development for no apparent reason.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bishop, D ; Norbury, C. F. |chapter=Speech and language impairments |editors=Anita Thapar; Sir Michael Rutter; Bishop, Dorothy ; Daniel Pine; Scott, Steven M.; Jim Stevenson; Taylor, Eric; Eds |title=Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2008 |pages=782–801 |isbn=1-4051-4549-8 |oclc=473789535}}</ref> Usually the first indication of SLI is that the child is later than usual in starting to speak and subsequently is delayed in putting words together to form sentences. [[Spoken language]] may be immature throughout corresponds to an ''expressive'' language impairment. In many children with SLI, understanding of [[language]], or ''receptive'' language, is also impaired, though this may not be obvious unless the child is given a formal assessment.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bishop, D. |title=Uncommon understanding: development and disorders of language comprehension in children |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-86377-260-9 |oclc=776282908 |accessdate=}}</ref> Although difficulties with use and understanding of complex sentences are a common feature of SLI, the diagnostic criteria encompass a wide range of problems, and for some children other aspects of language are problematic (see below). In general, the term SLI is reserved for children whose language difficulties persist into school age, and so it would not be applied to toddlers who are late to start talking, most of whom catch up with their peer group after a late start.<ref>{{cite book |author=Donna J. Thal; Jeanette Katich; | chapter=Predicaments in early identification of specific language impairment : does the early bird always catch the worm? | title=Assessment of Communication and Language (Communication and Language Intervention Series) |editors=Donna J. Thal; Kevin N. Cole; Dale, Philip S. | publisher=Brookes Publishing Company |location= |year=1996 |pages=1–28 |isbn=1-55766-193-6 |oclc=34772171 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Terminology===
The terminology for children’s language disorders is extremely wide-ranging and confusing, with many labels that have overlapping but not necessarily identical meanings. In part this confusion reflects uncertainty about the boundaries of SLI, and the existence of different subtypes.
Historically, the terms ‘’developmental dysphasia’’ or ‘’developmental aphasia’’ were used to describe children with the clinical picture of SLI.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ingram TT, Reid JF |title=Developmental aphasia observed in a department of child psychiatry |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=31 |issue=157 |pages=161–72 |year=1956 |month=June |pmid=13328151 |pmc=2011959 |doi= |url=}}</ref> These terms have, however, largely been abandoned, as they suggest parallels with adult acquired [[aphasia]]. This is misleading, as SLI is not caused by brain damage. In medical circles, terms such as ''specific developmental language disorder'' are often used, but this has the disadvantage of being wordy, and is also rejected by some people who think SLI should not be seen as a ‘disorder’. In the [[Education in the United Kingdom|UK educational system]], ''speech, language and communication needs'' (SLCN) is currently the term of choice, but this is far broader than SLI, and includes children with speech and language difficulties arising from a wide range of causes.

===Subtypes (Rapin and Allen 1983)===
Although most experts agree that children with SLI are quite variable, there is little agreement on how best to subtype them.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bishop, D. V. M |chapter=Specific language impairment: diagnostic dilemma |editors=Hans Van Balkom; Verhoeven, Ludo Th |title=Classification of developmental language disorders: theoretical issues and clinical implications |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=2004 |pages= 309–326 |isbn=1-4106-0902-2 |oclc=53721852}}</ref> There is no widely accepted classification system. In 1983 Rapin and Allen <ref>Rapin, I., & Allen, D. (1983). Developmental language disorders: nosologic considerations. In U. Kirk (Ed.), Neuropsychology of language, reading, and spelling (pp. 155–184). New York: Academic Press.</ref> proposed a classification of developmental language disorders based on the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] features of language impairment, which was subsequently updated by Rapin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rapin I |title=Practitioner review: developmental language disorders: a clinical update |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=643–55 |year=1996 |month=September |pmid=8894945 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1996.tb01456.x |url=}}</ref> Note that Rapin is a child neurologist, and she refers to different subtypes as ‘syndromes’; many of those coming from the perspective of education or [[Speech-Language Pathology|speech-language therapy]] reject this kind of medical label, and argue that there is not a clear dividing line between SLI and normal variation.<ref>Dale, P. S., & Cole, K. N. (1991). What's normal? Specific language impairment in an individual differences perspective. Language, Speech and Hearing Services in Schools, 22, 80–83.</ref> Also, although most experts would agree that children with characteristics of the Rapin subtypes can be identified, there are many cases who are less easy to categorise, and there is also evidence that categorisation can change over time.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Conti-Ramsden G, Botting N |title=Classification of children with specific language impairment: longitudinal considerations |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=1195–204 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10515515 |doi= |url=http://jslhr.asha.org/cgi/content/abstract/42/5/1195}}</ref>

Rapin's subgroups fall into three broad categories:

====Receptive/expressive developmental language disorder====
'''Receptive/expressive phonologic/syntactic deficit syndrome'''. This is the most common form of SLI, in which the child’s most obvious problems are a tendency to speak in short, simplified sentences, with omission of some [[Grammar|grammatical]] features, such as past tense -ed.<ref>{{cite book |author=Leonard, Laurence B. |title=Children with specific language impairment |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-585-27859-8 |oclc=45728290 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> It is common also to see simplified [[speech production]] when the child is young. For instance, clusters of [[consonant]]s may be reduced, so that ‘string’ is pronounced as ‘ting’. Vocabulary is often limited, with a tendency to use ‘general all-purpose’ terms, rather than more specific words.<ref name="RiceBode1993">{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=M. L.|last2=Bode|first2=J. V.|title=GAPS in the verb lexicons of children with specific language impairment|journal=First Language|volume=13|issue=37|year=1993|pages=113–131 |issn=0142-7237 |doi=10.1177/014272379301303707}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Leonard LB |title=Is expressive language disorder an accurate diagnostic category? |journal=Am J Speech Lang Pathol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=115–23 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19029534 |pmc=2718760 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2008/08-0064) |url=}}</ref>

[[Auditory verbal agnosia|Verbal auditory agnosia]]. This is a very rare form of language impairment, in which the child appears unable to make sense of speech sounds. It typically occurs as a symptom of [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], in which case a diagnosis of SLI would not be appropriate, as there is a known neurological origin of the language difficulties.

====Expressive developmental language disorder syndromes====
'''Developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD)'''. In the child with DVD, comprehension is adequate; the onset of speech is very delayed and extremely limited with impaired production of speech sounds and short utterances. The poor speech production cannot be explained in terms of structural or neurological damage of the [[Speech organ|articulators]]. There is much disagreement about diagnostic criteria, but the label most often used for children whose intelligibility declines markedly when they attempt complex utterances, compared to when they are producing individual sounds or [[syllable]]s. Another key feature is inconsistency of speech sound production from one occasion to another.  Although the term [[Developmental dyspraxia|'dyspraxia']] suggests a pure output disorder,<ref name="Hill EL 2001 149–71">{{cite journal |author=Hill EL |title=Non-specific nature of specific language impairment: a review of the literature with regard to concomitant motor impairments |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=149–71 |year=2001 |pmid=11344592 |doi= |url=}}</ref> many – perhaps all- of these children have difficulty in doing tasks that involve mentally manipulating speech sounds, such as [[phonological awareness]] tasks. Children with verbal dyspraxia also typically have major literacy problems, and [[receptive language]] levels may be poor on tests of [[vocabulary]] and grammar<ref>{{cite book |author=Wells, Bill; Stackhouse, Joy |title=Children's speech and literacy difficulties: a psycholinguistic framework |publisher=Singular Pub. Group |location=San Diego, Calif |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=1-86156-030-3 |oclc=246491090 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

'''Phonologic programming deficit syndrome'''. The child speaks in long but poorly intelligible utterances, producing what sounds like [[neologism|jargon]]. Outside Rapin’s group, little has been written about this subtype, which is not generally recognised in diagnostic frameworks.

====Higher order processing disorders====
'''Lexical deficit disorder'''. The child has word finding problems and difficulty putting ideas into words. There is poor comprehension for connected speech. Again, there is little research on this subtype, which is not widely recognised.

'''[[Pragmatic language impairment|Semantic-pragmatic deficit disorder]]'''. The child speaks in fluent and well-formed utterances with adequate articulation; content of language is unusual; comprehension may be over-literal; language use is odd; the child may chatter incessantly, be poor at turn-taking in conversation and maintaining a topic. There has been a great deal of controversy about this category, which is termed ''pragmatic language impairment (PLI)'' in the UK. Debate has centred over the question of whether it is a subtype of SLI, part of the autistic spectrum, or a separate condition.<ref>Bishop, D. V. M. (2000). Pragmatic language impairment: a correlate of SLI, a distinct subgroup, or part of the autistic continuum? In D. V. M. Bishop & L. B. Leonard (Eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, Characteristics, Intervention and Outcome (pp. 99–113). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.</ref>

===Relationship with other neurodevelopmental disorders===
Although textbooks draw clear boundaries between different neurodevelopmental disorders, there is much debate about overlaps between them.<ref>Bishop, D., & Rutter, M. (2008). Neurodevelopmental disorders: conceptual approaches. In M. Rutter, D. Bishop, D. Pine, S. Scott, J. Stevenson, E. Taylor & A. Thapar (Eds.), Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (pp. 32–41). Oxford: Blackwell.</ref> Many children with SLI meet diagnostic criteria for [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV, Snowling MJ |title=Developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment: same or different? |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=130 |issue=6 |pages=858–86 |year=2004 |month=November |pmid=15535741 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.6.858 |url=}}</ref> and others have features of [[autism]].<ref>Bishop, D. V. M. (2008). Specific language impairment, dyslexia, and autism: Using genetics to unravel their relationship. In C. F. Norbury, J. B. Tomblin & D. V. M. Bishop (Eds.), Understanding developmental language disorders: from theory to practice (pp. 67–78). Hove: Psychology Press.</ref>

==Diagnosis==
SLI is defined purely in behavioural terms: there is no biological test for SLI. There are three points that need to be met for a diagnosis of SLI:
*The child has language difficulties that interfere with daily life or academic progress
*Other causes are excluded: the problems cannot be explained in terms of hearing loss, general developmental delay, [[autism]], or physical difficulty in speaking
*Performance on a standardized language test (see Assessment, below) is significantly below age level
There is considerable variation in how this last criterion is implemented. Tombin et al. (1996) proposed the EpiSLI criterion, based on five composite scores representing performance in three domains of language (vocabulary, grammar, and narration) and two modalities (comprehension and production). Children scoring in the lowest 10% on two or more composite scores are identified as having language disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tomblin JB, Records NL, Zhang X |title=A system for the diagnosis of specific language impairment in kindergarten children |journal=J Speech Hear Res |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1284–94 |year=1996 |month=December |pmid=8959613 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Assessment===
Assessment will usually include an interview with the child’s caregiver, observation of the child in an unstructured setting, a hearing test, and standardized tests of language and nonverbal ability. There is a wide range of language assessments in English. Some are restricted for use by [[Speech-Language Pathology#National approaches to speech and language pathology|speech and language professionals]] (therapists or SALTs in the UK, speech-language pathologists, SLPs, in the US and Australia).
A commonly used test battery for diagnosis of SLI is the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF).
Assessments that can be completed by a parent or teacher can be useful to identify children who may require more in-depth evaluation. The Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test is a quick (ten minute) simple and accurate screening test developed and standardized in the UK. It is suitable for children from 3;4 to 6;8 years;months and can be administered by professionals and non-professionals (including parents) alike,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gardner H, Froud K, McClelland A, van der Lely HK |title=Development of the Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test to assess key markers of specific language and literacy difficulties in young children |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=513–40 |year=2006 |pmid=17050469 |doi=10.1080/13682820500442644 |url=}}</ref> and has been demonstrated to be highly accurate (98% accuracy) in identifying impaired children who need specialist help vs non-impaired children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=van der Lely HK, Payne E, McClelland A |title=An investigation to validate the grammar and phonology screening (GAPS) test to identify children with specific language impairment |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e22432 |year=2011 |pmid=21829461 |pmc=3145645 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022432 |url=}}</ref> This makes it potentially a feasible test for widespread screening. 'The Children’s Communication Checklist CCC–2' is a parent questionnaire suitable for testing language skills in school-aged children.

==Prevalence==
Epidemiological surveys, in the US<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tomblin JB, Records NL, Buckwalter P, Zhang X, Smith E, O'Brien M |title=Prevalence of specific language impairment in kindergarten children |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=1245–60 |year=1997 |month=December |pmid=9430746 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and Canada,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson CJ, Beitchman JH, Young A, ''et al.'' |title=Fourteen-year follow-up of children with and without speech/language impairments: speech/language stability and outcomes |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=744–60 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10391637 |doi= |url=}}</ref> estimated the prevalence of SLI in 5-year-olds at around 7 per cent. However, neither study adopted the stringent 'discrepancy' criteria of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] or [[ICD-10]]; SLI was diagnosed if the child scored below cut-off on standardized language tests, but had a nonverbal IQ of 90 or above and no other exclusionary criteria.

==Developmental course and outcome==
Longitudinal studies indicate that problems are largely resolved by 5 years in around 40% of 4-year-olds with SLI.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV, Edmundson A |title=Language-impaired 4-year-olds: distinguishing transient from persistent impairment |journal=J Speech Hear Disord |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=156–73 |year=1987 |month=May |pmid=3573746 |doi= |url=}}</ref> However, for children who still have significant language difficulties at school entry low levels of literacy are common, even for children who receive specialist help,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Catts HW, Fey ME, Tomblin JB, Zhang X |title=A longitudinal investigation of reading outcomes in children with language impairments |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1142–57 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12546484 |doi= 10.1044/1092-4388(2002/093)|url=}}</ref>
and educational attainments are typically poor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Snowling MJ, Adams JW, Bishop DV, Stothard SE |title=Educational attainments of school leavers with a preschool history of speech-language impairments |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=173–83 |year=2001 |pmid=11344593 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Poor outcomes are most common in cases where comprehension as well as expressive language is affected.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Simkin|first1=Z.|last2=Conti-Ramsden|first2=G.|title=Evidence of reading difficulty in subgroups of children with specific language impairment|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|volume=22|issue=3|year=2006|pages=315–331|issn=0265-6590|doi=10.1191/0265659006ct310xx}}</ref>

SLI is associated with a high rate of [[psychiatric disorder]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Cohen, Nancy |title=Language impairment and psychopathology in infants, children, and adolescents |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-7619-2025-0 |oclc=45749780 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> For instance, Conti-Ramsden and Botting (2004) found that 64% of a sample of 11-year-olds with SLI scored above a clinical threshold on a questionnaire for psychiatric difficulties, and 36% were regularly bullied, compared with 12% of comparison children.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Conti-Ramsden G, Botting N |title=Social difficulties and victimization in children with SLI at 11 years of age |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=145–61 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=15072535 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/013) |url=}}</ref> In the longer-term, studies of adult outcomes of children with SLI find elevated rates of unemployment, social isolation and psychiatric disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clegg J, Hollis C, Mawhood L, Rutter M |title=Developmental language disorders—a follow-up in later adult life. Cognitive, language and psychosocial outcomes |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=128–49 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15679523 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00342.x |url=}}</ref> However, most studies focused on children with severe problems, where comprehension as well as expressive language was affected. Better outcomes are found for children who have milder difficulties and do not require special educational provision.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Snowling MJ, Bishop DV, Stothard SE, Chipchase B, Kaplan C |title=Psychosocial outcomes at 15 years of children with a preschool history of speech-language impairment |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=8 |pages=759–65 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16898989 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2006.01631.x |url=}}</ref>

==Genetic and environmental risks==
It is now generally accepted that SLI is a strongly [[genetic disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bishop DV |title=What Causes Specific Language Impairment in Children? |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=217–221 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=19009045 |pmc=2582396 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00439.x |url=}}</ref> The best evidence comes from studies of twins. Two twins growing up together are exposed to the same home environment, yet may differ radically in their language skills. Such different outcomes are, however, seen almost exclusively in fraternal (non-identical) twins, who are genetically different. Identical twins share the same genes and tend to be much more similar in language ability.  There can be some variation in the severity and persistence of SLI in identical twins, indicating that environmental factors affect the course of disorder, but it is unusual to find a child with SLI who has an identical twin with normal language.
SLI is not usually caused by a [[mutation]] in a single gene.  Current evidence suggests that there are many different genes that can influence language learning, and SLI results when a child inherits a particularly detrimental combination of risk factors, each of which may have only a small effect.<ref>Bishop, D. V. M. (2009). Genes, cognition and communication: insights from neurodevelopmental disorders. The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1156, 1–18.</ref>
Only a handful of non-genetic factors have been found selectively to impact on [[language development]] in children. Later-born children in large families are at greater risk than earlier born.<ref>{{cite book |author=Garside, Roger F.; Fundudis, Trian; Kolvin, Israel |title=Speech retarded and deaf children : their psychological development |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-12-270150-X |oclc=6308388 |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Causal theories==
Much research has focussed on trying to identify what makes language learning so hard for some children.  A major divide is between theories that attribute the difficulties to a low-level problem with auditory temporal processing,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ceponiene R, Cummings A, Wulfeck B, Ballantyne A, Townsend J |title=Spectral vs. temporal auditory processing in specific language impairment: a developmental ERP study |journal=Brain Lang |volume=110 |issue=3 |pages=107–20 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19457549 |pmc=2731814 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2009.04.003 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tallal P |title=Improving language and literacy is a matter of time |journal=Nat.

==Associated factors==
Males are more affected by SLI than females. In clinical samples, the sex ratio of affected males: females is around 3 or 4:1.<ref>Robinson, R. J. (1991). Causes and associations of severe and persistent specific speech and language disorders in children. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 33, 943–962.</ref> The reason for this association is not known: no linkage has been found to [[genes]] on the [[sex chromosomes]].
Poor [[motor skills]] are commonly found in children with SLI.<ref name="Hill EL 2001 149–71"/> [[Brain scans]] do not usually reveal any obvious abnormalities in children with SLI, although quantitative comparisons have found differences in brain size or relative proportions of [[White matter|white]] or [[grey matter]] in specific regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jernigan TL, Hesselink JR, Sowell E, Tallal PA |title=Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children |journal=Arch.

==Intervention==
Intervention is usually carried out by speech and language therapists, who use a wide range of techniques to stimulate language learning. In the past, there was a vogue for drilling children in grammatical exercises, using [[imitation]] and [[elicitation]] methods, but such methods fell into disuse when it became apparent that there was little generalisation to everyday situations. Contemporary approaches to enhancing development of language structure are more likely to adopt 'milieu' methods, in which the intervention is interwoven into natural episodes of communication, and the therapist builds on the child's utterances, rather than dictating what will be talked about. In addition, there has been a move away from a focus solely on [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] toward interventions that develop children's social use of [[language]], often working in small groups that may include typically developing as well as language-impaired peers.<ref>Gallagher, T. (1996). Social-interactional approaches to child language intervention. In J. Beitchman, N. J. Cohen, M. M. Konstantareas & R. Tannock (Eds.), Language, Learning and Behavior Disorders: Developmental, Biological and Clinical Perspectives (pp. 493–514). New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Another way in which modern approaches to remediation differ from the past is that parents are more likely to be directly involved, particularly with preschool children.<ref>Tannock, R., & Girolametto, L. (1992). Reassessing parent-focused intervention programs. In S. F. Warren & J. Reichle (Eds.), Causes and effects in communication and language intervention (pp. 49–81). Baltimore MD: Paul Brooks.</ref>
A radically different approach has been developed by [[Paula Tallal|Tallal]] and colleagues, who have devised a computer-based intervention, [[Fast Forword]], that involves prolonged and intensive training on specific components of language and auditory processing.<ref>Tallal, P. (2000). Experimental studies of language learning impairments: From research to remediation. In D. V. M. Bishop & L. B. Leonard (Eds.), Speech and Language Impairments in Children: Causes, Characteristics, Intervention and Outcome (pp. 131–155). Hove, UK: Psychology Press.</ref> The theory underlying this approach maintains that language difficulties are caused by a failure to make fine-grained auditory discriminations in the temporal dimension, and the computerised training materials are designed to sharpen perceptual acuity.
For all these types of intervention, there are few adequately controlled trials that allow one to assess clinical efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Law J, Garrett Z, Nye C |title=The efficacy of treatment for children with developmental speech and language delay/disorder: a meta-analysis |journal=J.
