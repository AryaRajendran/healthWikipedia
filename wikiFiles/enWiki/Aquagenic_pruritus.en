'''Aquagenic pruritus''' is a [[List of cutaneous conditions|skin condition]] characterized by the development of severe, intense, prickling-like [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] itching that is without observable skin [[lesion]]s and that is evoked by contact with [[water]].<ref name="Fitz2">{{cite book |editor1-first=Irwin M. |editor1-last=Freedberg |editor2-first=Arthur Z. |editor2-last=Eisen |editor3-first=Klaus |editor3-last=Wolff |editor4-first=K.

==Presentation==
Symptoms may be felt immediately after contact with water or may be delayed for up to fifteen minutes; duration of an attack is typically between ten and 120 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(85)70149-1 |title=Aquagenic pruritus |year=1985 |last1=Steinman |first1=Howard K. |last2=Greaves |first2=Malcolm W. |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=13 |pages=91–6 |pmid=2411768 |issue=1}}</ref> However, sensitivity varies among sufferers, and since water is always present to some extent in the air (via atmospheric [[humidity]]), those with greater sensitivity who live in moister regions will be symptomatic almost constantly, while perspiration can cause frequent symptoms even in the driest climates.

==Diagnosis==
There is no definitive medical test for Aquagenic Pruritus. Rather, the diagnosis is made by excluding all other possible causes of the patient's itching. Since [[pruritus]] is a symptom of many serious diseases, it is important to rule out other causes before making a final diagnosis.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from Latin: Aquagenic, meaning ''water-induced'', and Pruritus, meaning ''[[itch]]''.

==Pathogenesis==
The exact mechanism of the condition is unknown, though some studies have suggested that the itching occurs in response to increased [[fibrinolytic]] activity in the skin.<ref name=pmid21965864>{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0019-5154.84734 |title=Aquagenic pruritus: Beneath water 'lies' |year=2011 |last1=Sekar |first1=Cshanmuga |last2=Jacob |first2=Sheja |last3=Srinivas |first3=CR |journal=Indian Journal of Dermatology |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=446–7 |pmid=21965864 |pmc=3179019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4362.1986.tb00863.x |title=Increased Cutaneous Fibrinolytic Activity in Aquagenic Pruritus |year=1986 |last1=Lotti |first1=T. |last2=Steinman |first2=H.

==Treatment==
Since the cause of the condition cannot be fully avoided in all cases, treatment is usually focused on topical itch management. This can be effected by the application of anti-pruritic lotions or creams, utilizing [[phototherapy]], or the application of heat or cold packs to the skin after water contact.<ref name=pmid21965864/><ref name=pmid11260176>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2230.2001.00757.x |title=Aquagenic pruritus responding to intermittent photochemotherapy |year=2001 |last1=Holme |first1=S. A. |last2=Anstey |first2=A. V. |journal=Clinical and Experimental Dermatology |volume=26 |pages=40–1 |pmid=11260176 |issue=1}}</ref> Paradoxically, hot baths or showers help many patients, possibly due to the fact that heat causes [[mast cells]] in the skin to release their supply of [[histamine]] and to remain depleted for up to 24 hours afterward.<ref>{{cite web|last=People's Pharmacy|title=Hot Water for Itches|url=http://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2005/10/18/hot-water-for-itches/|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> However, it is not clear that the itching associated with Aquagenic Pruritis is caused by histamine; other neurotransmitters, such as [[substance P]], may be involved.

H1 and H2 blockers such as [[loratadine]], [[doxepin]] or [[cimetidine]] have historically been the first line of pharmacological treatment, but not all sufferers find relief with these medications. When antihistamines do work, loratadine seems to be the most effective for mild cases and doxepin most effective for more severe cases. 

Various studies have shown that [[Naltrexone]], [[hydrocortisone]] or [[propranolol]] may relieve itching for some people.<ref name="pmid16502200">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10227-005-0144-x |title=Successful Treatment of Refractory Aquagenic Pruritus with Naltrexone |year=2006 |last1=Ingber |first1=Sarah |last2=Cohen |first2=Paul D. |journal=Journal of Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=215–6 |pmid=16502200}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2011.05.001 |title=Treatment with propranolol of 6 patients with idiopathic aquagenic pruritus |year=2011 |last1=Nosbaum |first1=Audrey |last2=Pecquet |first2=Catherine |last3=Bayrou |first3=Olivier |last4=Amsler |first4=Emmanuelle |last5=Nicolas |first5=Jean F. |last6=Bérard |first6=Frédéric |last7=Francès |first7=Camille |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=128 |issue=5 |pmid=21616525 |pages=1113}}</ref><ref name=pmid11260176/>
