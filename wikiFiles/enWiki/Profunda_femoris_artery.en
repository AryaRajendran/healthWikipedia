The '''profunda femoris artery''' (also known as the '''deep femoral artery''', or the '''deep artery of the thigh''') is a branch of the [[femoral artery]] that, as its name suggests, travels more deeply (posteriorly) than the rest of the femoral artery.

==Structure==
The profunda femoris branches off the [[femoral artery]] soon after its origin.  It travels down the thigh closer to the [[femur]] than the femoral artery, running between the [[pectineus]] and the [[adductor longus]], and running on the posterior side of [[adductor longus]].  The deep femoral artery does not leave the [[thigh]].

===Branches===
The profunda femoris gives off the following branches:
* [[Lateral femoral circumflex artery]] 
* [[Medial femoral circumflex artery]]
* [[Perforating arteries]] - perforate the [[adductor magnus]] muscle to the posterior and medial [[fascial compartment|compartment]]s of the thigh.
