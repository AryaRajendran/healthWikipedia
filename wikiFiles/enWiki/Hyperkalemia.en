'''Hyperkalemia''' ('''hyperkalaemia''' in [[British English]], ''hyper-'' high; ''kalium'', potassium; ''-emia'', "in the blood") refers to the condition in which the concentration of the electrolyte [[potassium]] (K<sup>+</sup>) in the blood is elevated. Extreme hyperkalemia is a [[medical emergency]] due to the risk of potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythms ([[arrhythmia]]).

Normal serum potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 [[mEq/L]];<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kratz | first1 = A | last2 = Ferraro | first2 = M | last3 = Sluss | first3 = PM | last4 = Lewandrowski | first4 = KB | last5 = Ellender | first5 = Stacey M. | last6 = Peters | first6 = Christine C. | last7 = Kratz | first7 = Alexander | last8 = Ferraro | first8 = Maryjane | last9 = Sluss | first9 = Patrick M. | title = Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital.

Membrane potential is maintained principally by the [[concentration gradient]] and membrane permeability to potassium with some contribution from the [[Na+/K+ pump]].

==Symptoms==
Symptoms are fairly nonspecific and generally include [[malaise]], [[palpitations]] and [[muscle weakness]]; mild hyperventilation may indicate a compensatory response to [[metabolic acidosis]], which is one of the possible causes of hyperkalemia. Often, however, the problem is detected during screening [[blood test]]s for a medical disorder, or it only comes to medical attention after complications have developed, such as [[cardiac arrhythmia]] or [[Cardiac arrest|sudden death]].

During the medical-history intake, physicians focus on [[Nephrology|kidney disease]] and [[medication]] use (see below), as these are the main causes. The combination of [[abdominal pain]], [[hypoglycemia]], and [[hyperpigmentation]], often in the context of other [[Autoimmune diseases|autoimmune disorders]], may be signs of [[Addison's disease]], which is a medical emergency.

==Causes==
===Ineffective elimination===
* [[Renal insufficiency]]
* [[Medication]] that interferes with urinary excretion:
** [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist|angiotensin receptor blockers]]
** Potassium-sparing [[diuretic]]s (e.g. [[amiloride]] and [[spironolactone]])
** [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]], or [[Celebrex|celecoxib]]
** The [[calcineurin inhibitor]] immunosuppressants [[ciclosporin]] and [[tacrolimus]]
** The antibiotic [[trimethoprim]]
** The antiparasitic drug [[pentamidine]]
* [[Mineralocorticoid]] deficiency or resistance, such as:
** [[Addison's disease]]
** [[Hypoaldosteronism|Aldosterone deficiency]]
** Some forms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]
** Type IV [[renal tubular acidosis]] (resistance of renal tubules to aldosterone)
* Gordon's syndrome ([[pseudohypoaldosteronism]] type II) (“familial hypertension with hyperkalemia”), a rare genetic disorder caused by defective modulators of salt transporters, including the [[thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter]].

===Excessive release from cells===
* [[Rhabdomyolysis]], [[burn (injury)|burns]] or any cause of rapid tissue [[necrosis]], including [[tumor lysis syndrome]]
* Massive [[blood transfusion]] or massive [[hemolysis]]
* Shifts/transport out of cells caused by [[acidosis]], low [[insulin]] levels, [[beta-blocker]] therapy, [[digoxin]] overdose, or the paralyzing agent [[succinylcholine]]
*[[Box jellyfish]] venom.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/12/13/3653150.htm Box jelly venom under the microscope] - By Anna Salleh - Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Retrieved 26 January 2013.</ref>

===Excessive intake===
* Excessive intake with salt-substitute, potassium-containing dietary supplements, or [[potassium chloride]] (KCl) infusion.  Note that, for a person with normal kidney function and normal elimination (see above), hyperkalemia by potassium intake would be seen only with large infusions of KCl or oral doses of several hundred milliequivalents of KCl.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Su M, Stork C, Ravuri S, ''et al.'' |title=Sustained-release potassium chloride overdose |journal=J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=641–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11762675 |doi=10.1081/CLT-100108499}}</ref>

===Lethal injection===
In the United States of America, hyperkalemia is induced by lethal injection in [[capital punishment|capital-punishment]] cases.  [[potassium chloride|Potassium chloride]] is the last of the three drugs administered and actually causes death.

===Pseudohyperkalemia===
Pseudohyperkalemia is a rise in the amount of potassium that occurs due to excessive leakage of potassium from cells, during or after blood is drawn.  It is a laboratory artifact rather than a biological abnormality and can be misleading to caregivers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sevastos |first=N |coauthors=Theodossiades, G; Efstathiou, S; Papatheodoridis, GV; Manesis, E; Archimandritis, AJ |title=Pseudohyperkalemia in serum: the phenomenon and its clinical magnitude |journal=J. Lab. Clin. Med. |volume=147 |issue=3 |pages=139–144 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16503244 |doi=10.1016/j.lab.2005.11.008 |url=}}</ref>  Pseudohyperkalemia is typically caused by [[hemolysis]] during [[venipuncture]] (by either excessive vacuum of the blood draw or by a collection needle that is of too fine a gauge); excessive tourniquet time or fist clenching during [[phlebotomy]] (which presumably leads to efflux of potassium from the muscle cells into the bloodstream);<ref>{{cite journal |last=Don |first=BR |coauthors=Sebastian, A; Cheitlin, M; Christiansen, M; Schambelan, M |title=Pseudohyperkalemia caused by fist clenching during phlebotomy |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=322 |issue=18 |pages=1290–1292 |year=1990 |month=May |pmid=2325722 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199005033221806|url=}}</ref> or by a delay in the processing of the blood specimen.  It can also occur in specimens from patients with abnormally high numbers of [[platelet]]s (>500,000/mm³), [[leukocyte]]s (> 70 000/mm³), or [[erythrocyte]]s (hematocrit > 55%). People with "leakier" [[cell membrane]]s have been found, whose blood must be separated immediately to avoid pseudohyperkalemia.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Iolascon |first=A |coauthors=Stewart, GW; Ajetunmobi, JF; ''et al.'' |title=Familial pseudohyperkalemia maps to the same locus as dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (hereditary xerocytosis) |journal=Blood |volume=93 |issue=9 |pages=3120–3123 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10216110 |doi= |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10216110}}</ref>

===Familial pseudohyperkalaemia===

A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia occurs,<ref name=Andolfo2012>Andolfo I, Alper SL, Delaunay J, Auriemma C, Russo R, Asci R, Esposito MR, Sharma AK, Shmukler BE, Brugnara C, Franceschi LD, Iolascon A (2012) Missense mutations in the ABCB6 transporter cause dominant familialpseudohyperkalemia. Am J Hematol  doi: 10.1002/ajh.23357 </ref> which is a dominant red-cell trait  characterized by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at or below room temperature, without additional hematological abnormalities. It appears to be due to mutations in Langereis [[blood group antigen]], which encodes an erythrocyte membrane [[porphyrin]] transporter. The gene, known as ''[[ABCB6]]'', is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 2]] (2q36).

==Pathophysiology==
Potassium is the most abundant [[intracellular]] [[cation]].  It is critically important for many physiological processes, including maintenance of cellular [[membrane potential]], [[homeostasis]] of cell volume, and transmission of [[action potential]]s in [[nerve cell]]s. Its main dietary sources are [[vegetable]]s ([[tomato]] and [[potato]]), fruits ([[orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[banana]]) and [[meat]]. Elimination is through the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and the [[kidney]].

The renal elimination of potassium is passive (through the [[glomeruli]]), and reabsorption is active in the [[proximal tubule]] and the ascending limb of the [[loop of Henle]]. There is active excretion of potassium in the [[distal tubule]] and the [[collecting duct]]; both are controlled by [[aldosterone]].

Hyperkalemia develops when there is excessive production (oral intake, tissue breakdown) or ineffective elimination of potassium. Ineffective elimination can be hormonal (in [[aldosterone]] deficiency) or due to causes in the renal parenchyma that impair excretion.

Increased extracellular potassium levels result in [[depolarization]] of the membrane potentials of cells.  This depolarization opens some [[sodium channel|voltage-gated sodium channel]]s, but not enough to generate an action potential. After a short while, the open sodium channels inactivate and become [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory]]. It raises the charge closer to the action potential threshold, thus less sodium entry is needed to produce an action potential.  This leads to the impairment of neuromuscular, [[cardiac]], and [[gastrointestinal]] organ systems.  Of most concern is the impairment of cardiac conduction which can result in [[ventricular fibrillation]] or [[asystole]].  

During extreme exercise, potassium is released from active muscle, and the serum potassium rises to a point that would be dangerous at rest.  High levels of [[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]] have a protective effect on the cardiac electrophysiology because they bind to beta 2 adrenergic receptors, which, when activated, extracellularly decrease potassium concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lindinger |first=MI |title=Potassium regulation during exercise and recovery in humans: implications for skeletal and cardiac muscle |journal=J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1022 |year=1995 |month=April |pmid=7563098 |doi= 10.1016/0022-2828(95)90070-5|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022-2828(95)90070-5}}</ref>

Patients with the rare hereditary condition of [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] appear to have a heightened muscular sensitivity that is associated with transient elevation of potassium levels.  Episodes of muscle weakness and spasms can be precipitated by exercise or fasting in these subjects.

==Diagnosis==
To gather enough information for diagnosis, the measurement of potassium needs to be repeated, as the elevation can be due to [[hemolysis]] in the first sample. The normal serum level of potassium is 3.5 to 5 mEq/L. Generally, blood tests for [[renal function]] ([[creatinine]], [[blood urea nitrogen]]), [[glucose]] and occasionally [[creatine kinase]] and [[cortisol]] will be performed.  Calculating the [[trans-tubular potassium gradient]] can sometimes help in distinguishing the cause of the hyperkalemia.

In many cases, [[medical ultrasonography|renal ultrasound]] will be performed, since hyperkalemia is highly suggestive of renal failure.

Also, [[electrocardiography]] (EKG/ECG) may be performed to determine if there is a significant risk of cardiac [[arrhythmias]].

===ECG findings===
With mild to moderate hyperkalemia, there is reduction of the size of the [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P wave]] and development of peaked [[T wave]]s. Severe hyperkalemia results in a widening of the [[QRS complex]], and the [[ECG]] complex can evolve to a [[sinusoidal]] shape.  There appears to be a direct effect of elevated potassium on some of the potassium channels that increases their activity and speeds membrane repolarization.  Also, (as noted [[#Pathophysiology|above]]), hyperkalemia causes an overall membrane depolarization that inactivates many sodium channels.  The faster repolarization of the cardiac [[action potential]] causes the tenting of the T waves, and the inactivation of sodium channels causes a sluggish conduction of the electrical wave around the heart, which leads to smaller P waves and widening of the QRS complex.

The serum K<sup>+</sup> concentration at which electrocardiographic changes develop is somewhat variable.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wrenn | first1 = KD | last2 = Slovis | first2 = CM | last3 = Slovis | first3 = BS | title = The ability of physicians to predict hyperkalemia from the ECG. | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 1229–32 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1952310 | doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(05)81476-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aslam | first1 = S | last2 = Friedman | first2 = EA | last3 = Ifudu | first3 = O | title = Electrocardiography is unreliable in detecting potentially lethal hyperkalaemia in haemodialysis patients. | journal = Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 1639–42 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12198216 | doi = 10.1093/ndt/17.9.1639 }}</ref>  Although the factors influencing the effect of serum potassium levels on cardiac electrophysiology are not entirely understood, the concentrations of other electrolytes, as well as levels of catecholamines, play a major role.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Surawicz | first1 = B | title = Relationship between electrocardiogram and electrolytes | journal = American heart journal | volume = 73 | issue = 6 | pages = 814–34 | year = 1967 | pmid = 5338052 | doi = 10.1016/0002-8703(67)90233-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leitch | first1 = SP | last2 = Patterson | first2 = DJ | title = Interactive effects of K+, acidosis, and catecholamines on isolated rabbit heart: implications for exercise | journal = Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985) | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 1164–71 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7836118 }}</ref>

==Treatment==
When arrhythmias occur, or when potassium levels exceed 6.5&nbsp;mmol/l, emergency lowering of potassium levels is mandated. Several agents are used to transiently lower K<sup>+</sup> levels. Choice depends on the degree and cause of the hyperkalemia, and other aspects of the patient's condition.

===Myocardial excitability===
Calcium ([[calcium chloride]] or [[calcium gluconate]]) increases [[threshold potential]] through a mechanism that is still unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in hyperkalemia. One ampule of calcium chloride has about three times more calcium than calcium gluconate. Onset of action is less than five minutes and lasts about 30-60 min. Doses should be titrated with constant monitoring of ECG changes during administration and the dose should be repeated  if ECG changes do not normalize within 3-5 mins.

===Lowering K<sup>+</sub> temporarily===
Several medical treatments shift potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cellular compartment, thereby reducing the risk of complications. The effect of these measures tends to be short-lived, but may temporize the problem until potassium can be removed from the body.<ref name="pmid20855477">{{cite journal |author=Elliott MJ, Ronksley PE, Clase CM, Ahmed SB, Hemmelgarn BR |title=Management of patients with acute hyperkalemia |journal=CMAJ |volume=182 |issue=15 |pages=1631–5 |year=2010 |month=October |pmid=20855477 |pmc=2952010 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.100461 |url=}}</ref>
* [[Insulin]] (e.g. intravenous injection of 10-15 units of regular insulin along with 50 ml of 50% dextrose to prevent hypoglycemia) will lead to a shift of potassium ions into cells, secondary to increased activity of the [[sodium-potassium ATPase]].<ref name=AHA2010>{{cite journal|last=Vanden Hoek|first=TL|coauthors=Morrison, LJ, Shuster, M, Donnino, M, Sinz, E, Lavonas, EJ, Jeejeebhoy, FM, Gabrielli, A|title=Part 12: cardiac arrest in special situations: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care|journal=Circulation|date=2010-11-02|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S829–61|pmid=20956228|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971069}}</ref> Its effects last a few hours, so it sometimes needs to be repeated while other measures are taken to suppress potassium levels more permanently. The insulin is usually given with an appropriate amount of glucose in order to prevent hypoglycemia following the insulin administration.
* [[Bicarbonate]] therapy (e.g. 1 ampule (50 mEq) infused over 5 min) is effective in shifting potassium into the cell.<ref name=AHA2010/>  The bicarbonate ion will stimulate an exchange of cellular H<sup>+</sup> for Na<sup>+</sup>, thus leading to stimulation of the [[sodium-potassium ATPase]].
* [[Salbutamol]] (albuterol, Ventolin), a β<sub>2</sub>-selective catecholamine, is administered by nebulizer (e.g. 10–20&nbsp;mg).  This drug also lowers blood levels of K<sup>+</sup> by promoting its movement into cells.<ref name=AHA2010/>

===Increasing elimination===
Severe cases require [[hemodialysis]] or [[hemofiltration]], which are the most rapid methods of removing potassium from the body.<ref name=AHA2010/> These are typically used if the underlying cause cannot be corrected swiftly while temporizing measures are instituted or there is no response to these measures.

[[Sodium polystyrene sulfonate]] with [[sorbitol]] (Kayexalate) either orally or rectally is widely used with the goal to lower potassium over several hours.<ref name=AHA2010/>  Removal of potassium is assumed to require [[defecation]].  However, careful clinical trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of Kayexalate are lacking, and there are small risks of [[necrosis]] of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sterns RH, Rojas M, Bernstein P, Chennupati S |title=Ion-exchange resins for the treatment of hyperkalemia: are they safe and effective? |journal=J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=733–5 |year=2010 |month=May |pmid=20167700 |doi=10.1681/ASN.2010010079 |url=}}</ref>

[[Furosemide]] may also be used to promote excretion of potassium in the urine.<ref name=AHA2010/>

===Long-term prevention===
Preventing recurrence of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or the addition of oral bicarbonate or a [[diuretic]] (such as [[furosemide]] or [[hydrochlorothiazide]]). [[Sodium polystyrene sulfonate]] and [[sorbital]] (combined as Kayexalate) are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium.  Concerns regarding its use are noted in the previous section.
