'''Traumatic asphyxia''', or '''Perte's syndrome''', is a medical emergency caused by an intense compression of the [[thoracic cavity]], causing [[venous]] back-flow.<ref name=ChestJournal>{{cite journal |pmid=5082045 |year=1972 |last1=Moore |first1=J. D. |last2=Mayer |first2=John H. |last3=Gago |first3=Otto |title=Traumatic Asphyxia |volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=634–6 |journal=Chest |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/62/5/634 |doi=10.1378/chest.62.5.634}}</ref>

==Causes==
Traumatic asphyxia occurs when a powerful compressive force is applied to the thoracic cavity. This is most often seen in [[motor vehicle accident]]s, as well as industrial and farming accidents. However, it can present anytime a significant pressure is applied to the thorax.

==Signs and symptoms==
Traumatic asphyxia is characterized by [[cyanosis]] in the upper extremities, neck, and head as well as [[petechiae]] in the [[conjunctiva]].  Patients can also display [[jugular venous pressure|jugular venous distention]] and facial [[edema]].<ref name=PPT>{{cite book |last1=Aehlert |first1=Barbara J. |year=2010 |title=Paramedic Practice Today: Above and Beyond |page=472 |isbn=978-0-323-08537-3}}</ref> Associated injuries include [[pulmonary contusion]], [[myocardial contusion]], [[hemothorax|hemo]]/[[pneumothorax]], and [[broken rib]]s.<ref name=PMC /><ref name=PubMedLee>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0003-4975(91)90456-Z |title=Traumatic asphyxia |year=1991 |last1=Lee |first1=Ming-Chung |last2=Wong |first2=Sing-Sieng |last3=Chu |first3=Jaw-Ji |last4=Chang |first4=Jen-Ping |last5=Lin |first5=Pyng-Jing |last6=Shieh |first6=Ming-Jang |last7=Chang |first7=Chau-Hsiung |journal=The Annals of Thoracic Surgery |volume=51 |pages=86–8 |pmid=1985583 |issue=1}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
The sudden impact on the thorax causes an increase in [[thoracic pressure|intrathoracic pressure]].<ref name=PMC>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12245-009-0115-x |title=Traumatic asphyxia: A rare syndrome in trauma patients |year=2009 |last1=Eken |first1=Cenker |last2=Yıgıt |first2=Ozlem |journal=International Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=255–6 |pmid=20436897 |pmc=2840592}}</ref>  In order for traumatic asphyxia to occur, a [[Valsalva maneuver]] is required when the traumatic force is applied.<ref name=Barakat>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.annfar.2003.10.011 |title=Syndrome d'asphyxie traumatique ou syndrome de Perthes.

Instead, the air causes increased venous back-pressure, which is transferred back to through the [[right atrium]], to the [[superior vena cava]] and to the head and neck veins and capillaries.<ref name=PMC />
==Prognosis==
For individuals who survive the initial crush injury, survival rates are high for traumatic asphyxia.<ref name=PMC /><ref name=JEMS>{{cite journal |first1=Bryan E. |last1=Bledsoe |first2=Ross.
