'''Female hysteria''' was a once-common [[medical diagnosis]], made exclusively in women, which is today no longer recognized by modern medical authorities as a medical disorder. Its diagnosis and treatment were routine for many hundreds of years in Western Europe. Hysteria was widely discussed in the medical literature of the 19th century. Women considered to be suffering from it exhibited a wide array of [[symptoms]] including faintness, nervousness, sexual desire, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, muscle spasm, shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and "a tendency to cause trouble".<ref name=Maines>{{cite book |author=Maines, Rachel P. |title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-8018-6646-4}}</ref>

==Early history==
{{see|Wandering womb}}
The history of the notion of hysteria can be traced to ancient times; in ancient Greece it was described in the gynecological treatises of the [[Hippocratic corpus]], which date from the 5th and 4th centuries BC.  [[Plato]]'s dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']] compares a woman's [[uterus]] to a living creature that wanders throughout a woman’s body, "blocking passages, obstructing breathing, and causing disease."<ref name="HippocratesBeyondFreud">{{cite book |last=King | first=Helen| editor1-last=Gilman| editor2-last=King| editor3-last=Porter |editor-first4=G.S. | editor4-last=Rousseau |editor-first5=Elaine | editor-last5=Showalter | title=Hysteria beyond Freud |publisher=University of California Press |year=1993 |pages=3–90 |chapter=Once upon a text: Hysteria from Hippocrates |isbn=0-520-08064-5 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=LdxmV5J0pPkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Freud#v=onepage&q&f=false |editor-first=Sander |editor3-first=Helen |editor8-first=Roy}}</ref>  The concept of a pathological, [[wandering womb]] was later viewed as the source of the term ''hysteria'',<ref name="HippocratesBeyondFreud"/> which stems from the Greek cognate of uterus, ὑστέρα (''hystera'').

Another cause was thought to be the retention of female semen, thought to mingle with male semen during intercourse. This was believed to be stored in the womb. Hysteria was referred to as "the widow's disease", since the female semen was believed to turn venomous if not released through regular climax or intercourse.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roach|first=Mary|title=Bonk : the curious coupling of science and sex|year=2009|publisher=W.W.

==Nineteenth century==

During the early 20th century, the number of women diagnosed with female hysteria declined sharply. Many reasons have been attributed to this decline. Many medical authors claim that the decline was due to laypeople gaining a greater understanding of the psychology behind [[conversion disorder]]s such as hysteria.<ref name=Micale/>

With so many possible symptoms, hysteria was always considered a [[catchall diagnosis]] where any unidentifiable ailment could be assigned. As diagnostic techniques improved, the number of cases were pared down until nothing was left. For instance, before the introduction of [[electroencephalography]], [[epilepsy]] was frequently confused with hysteria.<ref name=Micale2000>{{cite journal|title=The Decline of Hysteria|author=Micale, Mark S.|journal=Harvard Mental Health Letter|volume=17|issue=1|date=July 2000|pages=4–6|pmid=10877868}}</ref> Many cases that had previously been labeled hysteria were reclassified by [[Sigmund Freud]] as anxiety neuroses.<ref name=Micale2000/>

Today, female hysteria is no longer a recognized illness, but different manifestations of hysteria are recognized in other conditions such as [[schizophrenia]], [[conversion disorder]], and [[anxiety attack]]s.
