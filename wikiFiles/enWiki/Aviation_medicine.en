'''Aviation medicine''', also called '''flight medicine''' or '''aerospace medicine''', is a [[preventive medicine|preventive]] or [[occupational medicine]] in which the patients/subjects are pilots, aircrews, or persons involved in spaceflight.<ref name=Dehart>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals Of Aerospace Medicine: Translating Research Into Clinical Applications, 3rd Rev Ed. |last=Dehart |first=R. L. |coauthors=J. R. Davis |year=2002 |publisher=Lippincott Williams And Wilkins |location=United States |isbn=978-0-7817-2898-0 |page=720 }}</ref> The specialty strives to treat or prevent conditions to which aircrews are particularly susceptible, applies medical knowledge to the [[human factors]] in [[aviation]] and is thus a critical component of [[aviation safety]].<ref name=Dehart/>  A military practitioner of aviation medicine may be called a [[flight surgeon]] and a civilian practitioner is an [[aviation medical examiner]].<ref name=Dehart/> 

==Overview==
Broadly defined, this subdiscipline endeavors to discover and prevent various adverse physiological responses to hostile biologic and physical stresses encountered in the [[aerospace]] environment.<ref name=Dehart/>  Problems range from life support measures for astronauts to recognizing an ear block in an infant traveling on an [[airliner]] with elevated cabin pressure altitude. Aeromedical certification of pilots, [[aircrew]] and patients is also part of Aviation Medicine. A final subdivision is the AeroMedical Transportation Specially. These military and civilian specialists are concerned with protecting aircrew and patients who are transported by AirEvac aircraft (helicopters or fixed-wing airplanes). 

Atmospheric physics potentially affect all air travelers regardless of the aircraft.<ref name=Dehart/> As humans ascend  through the first 9100&ndash;18,300 m (30,000&ndash;40,000 ft), temperature decreases linearly at an average rate of 2°C (3.6°F) per 305 m (1000 ft). If sea-level temperature is 16°C (60°F), the outside [[air temperature]] is approximately &minus;57°C (&minus;70°F) at 10,700 m (35,000 ft). Pressure and humidity also decline, and aircrew are exposed to radiation, vibration and acceleration forces (the latter are also known as "g" forces). Aircraft life support systems such as oxygen, heat and pressurization are the first line of defense against most of the hostile aerospace environment. Higher performance aircraft will provide more sophisticated life support equipment such as "G-suits" to help the body resist acceleration, and pressure [[rebreather|breathing apparatus]] or [[ejection seat]]s or other escape equipment.

Every factor contributing to a safe flight has a failure rate. The crew of an aircraft is no different. Aviation medicine aims to keep this rate in the humans involved equal to or below a specified risk level. This standard of risk is also applied to [[airframe]], [[avionics]] and systems associated with flights.

AeroMedical examinations aim at screening for elevation in risk of sudden incapacitation, such as a tendency towards [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attacks), [[epilepsy]] or the presence of metabolic conditions [[diabetes]], etc. which may lead to hazardous condition at altitude.<ref name=Dehart/>  The goal of the AeroMedical Examination is to protect the life and health of pilots and passengers by making reasonable medical assurance that an individual is fit to fly.<ref name=Dehart/> Other screened conditions such as [[colour blindness]] can prevent a person from flying because of an inability to perform a function that is necessary.<ref name=Dehart/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Squire TJ, Rodriguez-Carmona M, Evans AD, Barbur JL |title=Color vision tests for aviation: comparison of the anomaloscope and three lantern types |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=421–9 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15892538 |doi= |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2005/00000076/00000005/art00001 |accessdate=2008-07-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080704141255/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2005/00000076/00000005/art00001| archivedate= 4 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In this case to tell green from red.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Birch J |title=Performance of red-green color deficient subjects on the Holmes-Wright lantern (Type A) in photopic viewing |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=70 |issue=9 |pages=897–901 |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10503756 |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> These specialized medical exams consist of physical examinations performed by an [[Aviation Medical Examiner]] or a military [[Flight Surgeon]], doctors trained to screen potential aircrew for identifiable medical conditions that could lead to problems while performing airborne duties.<ref name=Dehart/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Baker DP, Krokos KJ |title=Development and validation of Aviation Causal Contributors for Error Reporting Systems (ACCERS) |journal=Hum Factors |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=185–99 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17447662 |doi= 10.1518/001872007X312432|url= |accessdate= }}</ref>  In addition, this unique population of aircrews is a high-risk group for several diseases and harmful conditions due to irregular work shifts with irregular sleeping and irregular meals (usually carbonated drinks and high energy snacks) and work-related stress.<ref name=Dehart/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Dongen HP, Caldwell JA, Caldwell JL |title=Investigating systematic individual differences in sleep-deprived performance on a high-fidelity flight simulator |journal=Behav Res Methods |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=333–43 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16956110 |doi= 10.3758/BF03192785|url= |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Grósz A, Tóth E, Péter I |title=A 10-year follow-up of ischemic heart disease risk factors in military pilots |journal=Mil Med |volume=172 |issue=2 |pages=214–9 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17357781 |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Buja A, Lange JH, Perissinotto E, ''et al.'' |title=Cancer incidence among male military and civil pilots and flight attendants: an analysis on published data |journal=Toxicol Ind Health |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=273–82 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16463960 |doi= 10.1191/0748233705th238oa|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0748-2337&volume=21&issue=10&spage=273&aulast=Buja |accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lurie, O; Zadik, Y; Tarrasch, R; Raviv, G; Goldstein, L |title=Bruxism in Military Pilots and Non-Pilots: Tooth Wear and Psychological Stress |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=137–9 |year=2007 |month=February |pmid=17310886 |doi= |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2007/00000078/00000002/art00010 |accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref>
