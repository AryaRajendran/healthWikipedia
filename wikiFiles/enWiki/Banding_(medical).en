'''Banding''' is a [[medical procedure]] which uses elastic bands for constriction.  Banding may be used to tie off blood vessels in order to stop bleeding, as in the treatment of bleeding [[esophageal varices]].<ref>{{cite journal | unused_data = American Journal of Gastroenterology | title = Diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension | journal = American College of Gastroenterology Practice Parameters Committee | author = Grace ND | date = 1997 July| volume = 92 | issue = 7 | pages = 1081–91}}</ref> The band restricts blood flow to the ligated tissue, so that it eventually dies and sloughs away from the supporting tissue. This same principle underlies banding as treatment for [[hemorrhoids]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10350-004-0591-2 | title = Long-term outcome of rubber band ligation for symptomatic primary and recurrent internal hemorrhoids. | author =  Iyer VS; Shrier I; Gordon PH | journal = Dis Colon Rectum | date = 2004 August| volume = 47 | number = 8 | pages = 1364–70 | pmid = 15484351 | issue = 8}}</ref> 

Banding may also be used to restrict the function of an organ without killing it. In [[Adjustable gastric band|gastric banding]] to treat obesity,<ref>{{cite journal | author = NIH conference, Consensus Development Conference Panel | title = Gastrointestinal surgery for severe obesity. | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | year= 1991 | volume = 115 | issue = 12 | page = 956 | pmid=1952493}}</ref> the size of the stomach is reduced so that digestion is slowed and the patient feels full more quickly.
