The '''erythrocyte sedimentation rate''' (ESR), also called a '''sedimentation rate''' or '''Westergren ESR''', is the rate at which [[red blood cells]] sediment in a period of one hour. It is a common [[hematology]] test, and is a non-specific measure of [[inflammation]].
To perform the test, anticoagulated [[blood]] is placed in an upright tube, known as a Westergren tube, and the rate at which the [[red blood cell]]s fall is measured and reported in mm/h.

Since the introduction of [[automated analyser|automated analyzers]] into the clinical laboratory, the ESR test has been automatically performed.

The ESR is governed by the balance between pro-sedimentation factors, mainly [[fibrinogen]], and those factors resisting sedimentation, namely the negative charge of the erythrocytes ([[zeta potential]]).  When an inflammatory process is present, the high proportion of fibrinogen in the blood causes red blood cells to stick to each other. The red cells form stacks called '[[rouleaux]],' which settle faster. Rouleaux formation can also occur in association with some lymphoproliferative disorders in which one or more [[immunoglobulins]] are secreted in high amounts. Rouleaux formation can, however, be a normal physiological finding in horses, cats, and pigs.

The ESR is increased by any cause or focus of inflammation. The ESR is increased in [[pregnancy]], inflammation, anemia or [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and decreased in [[polycythemia]], [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle cell anemia]], [[hereditary spherocytosis]], and [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]]. The basal ESR is slightly higher in females.<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003638.htm</ref>

==History==
This test was invented in 1897 by the Polish doctor [[Edmund Biernacki]].<ref>{{WhoNamedIt2|doctor|2783|Edmund Faustyn Biernacki}} and eponymously named {{WhoNamedIt|synd|3352|Biernacki's test}}</ref> In some parts of the world the test continues to be referred to as ''Biernacki's Reaction''  (Polish abbreviation: OB = ''Odczyn Biernackiego''.) In 1918 the Swedish pathologist [[Robert Sanno Fåhræus]] declared the same and, along with [[Alf Vilhelm Albertsson Westergren]], are eponymously remembered for the Fåhræus-Westergren test (abbreviated as FW test; in the UK, usually termed Westergren test),<ref>{{WhoNamedIt2|doctor|2788|Robert (Robin) Sanno Fåhræus}} and {{WhoNamedIt2|doctor|2791|Alf Vilhelm Albertsson Westergren}} who are eponymously named for the {{WhoNamedIt|synd|3359|Fåhræus-Westergren test (aka Westergren test)}}</ref> which uses  sodium citrate-coagulated specimens.<ref name="pmid8463411">{{cite journal |author=International Council for Standardization in Haematology (Expert Panel on Blood Rheology) |title=ICSH recommendations for measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

==Uses==

===Diagnosis===
It can sometimes be useful in diagnosing some diseases, such as [[multiple myeloma]], [[temporal arteritis]], [[polymyalgia rheumatica]], various auto-immune diseases, [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and chronic kidney diseases.  In many of these cases, the ESR may exceed 100&nbsp;mm/hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sedimentation Rate |url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/sedimentation-rate |date=2006-06-16 |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>

It is commonly used for a differential diagnosis for [[Kawasaki's disease]] and it may be increased in some chronic infective conditions like [[tuberculosis]] and infective [[endocarditis]].

===Disease severity===
It is a component of the [[PCDAI]] (Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index), an index for assessment of severity of inflammatory bowel disease in children.

===Monitoring response to therapy===
The clinical usefulness of ESR is limited to monitoring the response to therapy in certain inflammatory diseases such as temporal arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be used as a crude measure of response in [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. Additionally, ESR levels are used to define one of the several possible adverse prognostic factors in the staging of Hodgkin's lymphoma.

===Adults===
The widely used<ref>{{GPnotebook|389349443|Reference range (ESR)}}</ref> rule for calculating normal maximum ESR values in adults (98% confidence limit) is given by a formula devised in 1983:<ref name="pmid6402065">{{cite journal |author=Miller A, Green M, Robinson D |title=Simple rule for calculating normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate |journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) |volume=286 |issue=6361 |pages=266 |year=1983 |pmid=6402065 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.286.6361.266|pmc=1546487}}</ref>
:<math>{\rm ESR}\ (mm/hr) \le \frac {{\rm Age}\ ({\it in\ years}) + 10\ ({\it if\ female})}{2}</math>

This formula is no longer credited. Other studies show only a small dependence of ESR on age and much lower values, as seen in the following:

==Relation to C-reactive protein==
[[C-reactive protein]] is an [[acute phase protein]] produced by the liver during an inflammatory reaction. Since C-reactive protein levels in the blood rise more quickly after the inflammatory or infective process begins, ESR is often replaced with C-reactive protein measurement. There are specific drawbacks, however: for example, both tests for ESR and CRP were found to be independently associated with a diagnosis of [[acute maxillary sinusitis]] <ref name="sinusitis">{{cite journal |author=Jens Georg Hansen, Henrik Schmidt, Jorn Rosborg,  Elisabeth Lund |title=Predicting acute maxillary sinusitis in a general practice population |journal=BMJ |volume=311 |pages=233–236 |date=22 July 1995|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/311/6999/233 |pmid=7627042 |issue=6999 |pmc=2550286 }}</ref> so in some cases the combination of the two measurements may improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
