'''Brighton and Sussex Medical School''' (BSMS) is a medical school formed as a partnership of the [[University of Brighton]] and the [[University of Sussex]]. Like other UK medical schools it is based on the principles and standards of 'Tomorrow's Doctor', an initiative by the [[General Medical Council]] outlining the role of British practitioners. As of 2008 the school accepts some 138 British medical students and an additional 10 from overseas, at 16 applications per place it is one of the most popular courses in the UK.<ref name="statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmedicalschools.com/index.php?pageid=stats|title=www.ukmedicalschools.com British Medical School Statistics|publisher=ukmedicalschools.com|accessdate=2008-09-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==History==
The school is one of a number of new medical schools formed in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] following the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]]s 1997 election victory. Students are technically full members of both universities with access to both sets of facilities. The school gained its license in 2002, its initial course being a heavily modified version of the [[University of Southampton]] course. It admits approximately 136 students per year with all of them being based for the first two years on the split campus at [[Falmer]].

==Introduction==
The first intake of students began their five-year medical degree programmes in September 2003. The school was opened as a part of the British Government's attempts to train more doctors, which also saw [[Peninsula Medical School]], [[University of East Anglia Medical School]], [[Hull York Medical School]] and [[Keele University Medical School]] open their doors. Since then, it has become one of the most popular medical schools in the country. According to UCAS statistics, 2005 saw BSMS as the most competitive medical school to gain a place at, largely due to the low number of places offered.

==Falmer==

The University of Sussex is situated in [[Falmer]], just out of Brighton and has direct pedestrian access into the [[South Downs National Park]]. Falmer is roughly 9 minutes away from Brighton City Centre. The campus is situated across the A27 and South Coast railway line from the Sussex Falmer site. Both the Brighton and Sussex Falmer sites have accommodation, shopping facilities and other ancillary services.

==Teaching==

The curriculum is a blend of both progressive and traditional teaching methods, based around lectures, practicals and small group based learning. BSMS does not use [[Problem Based Learning]].

The University of Brighton provides the professional aspects of the course through its faculties of health, sciences and engineering using experience from other healthcare courses such as nursing and midwifery. In contrast Sussex provides primarily biological science and anatomy teaching for which it is better suited due to the close proximity of the Sussex portion of the medical school to the University of Sussex school of life sciences 'John Maynard Smith' building. Also located close by are the medical research building and the genome damage stability and control centre (an MRC research facilitiy).

The medical school requires dissection of human [[cadavers]] as a compulsory part of the course. This means the course is more anatomically based than that of many other modern UK medical schools.<ref name="anatomy">{{Citation | journal = Anat Rec B New Anat | date = May 2005 | pages = 22–27 | volume = 284 | issue = 1 | title = Provision of anatomical teaching in a new British medical school: getting the right mix. | author = Evans DJ, Watt DJ. | pmid = 15898082 }}</ref> As well as the emphasis on anatomy, BSMS also gives early clinical exposure, with students from preclinical years regularly going on placements in both the primary and secondary care sectors.

BSMS is notable for giving advice on PDAs and offers discounted software for students.

===The intercalated degree===
Although BSMS does not offer an accelerated graduate entry programme, subject to performance students may be offered the opportunity to study subjects of their choice in greater depth by taking an intercalated Bachelors or Masters level degree, resulting in an extended 6 year course. This is taken between the third and fourth years of the BM BS programme, and provides the necessary academic background for those who wish to embark on a career combining medical practice with medical research or teaching. It is possible to transfer to another university to undertake the degree, and then return to complete the medical course at BSMS.

==Teaching hospitals and clinical placements==

Students will undertake a range of clinical placements, mainly at the Royal Sussex but extending into other trust and primary care settings. The University Hospitals NHS Trust provides a full range of clinical specialties with major centres in cardiology/cardiovascular surgery, cancer, renal dialysis, neurosurgery and HIV medicine.

The clinical placements are served in the [[teaching hospital]]s throughout the south-east, including many in Kent, and all Sussex hospitals, such as the [[Royal Sussex County Hospital]].
