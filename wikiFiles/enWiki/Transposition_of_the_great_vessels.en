'''Transposition of the great vessels''' ('''TGV''') is a group of [[congenital]] [[congenital heart defect|heart defects]] ('''CHD'''s) involving an abnormal spatial arrangement of any of the [[great vessel]]s: [[superior vena cava|superior]] and/or [[inferior vena cava|inferior]] [[venae cavae]] ('''SVC''', '''IVC'''), [[pulmonary artery]], [[pulmonary vein]]s, and [[aorta]]. CHDs involving only the primary [[artery|arteries]] (pulmonary artery and aorta) belong to a sub-group called '''transposition of the great arteries''' ('''TGA''').

==History==
TGV was first described in 1797 by [[Matthew Baillie]].<ref>''The Morbid Anatomy of Some of the Most Important Parts of the Human Body'' (1793)</ref>

== Etiologies ==
Preexisting diabetes mellitus of an expectant mother is a risk factor that has been described for the fetus having TGV.<ref name="pmid18851735">{{cite journal |author=Martins P, Castela E |title=Transposition of the great arteries |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=3 |issue= |pages=27 |year=2008 |pmid=18851735 |pmc=2577629 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-3-27 |url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/3//27}}</ref>  Additionally, the children of [[diabetic]] mothers are more likely to have [[aortic coarctation]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

[[wiktionary:Transpose|Transpose]]d vessels can present a large variety of [[wiktionary:atriovenous|atriovenous]], [[wiktionary:ventriculoarterial|ventriculoarterial]] and/or [[wiktionary: arteriovenous|arteriovenous]] [[wiktionary:discordant|discordance]]. The effects may range from a change in [[blood pressure]] to an interruption in [[circulatory system|circulation]], depending on the nature and degree of the misplacement and which vessels are involved.

Although "transposed" literally means "swapped", many types of TGV involve vessels that are in abnormal positions, while not actually being swapped with each other. The terms TGV and TGA are most commonly used in reference to '''[[dextro-Transposition of the great arteries|dextro-TGA]]''' ('''d-TGA''') – in which the arteries ''are'' in swapped positions; however, both terms are also commonly used, though to a slightly lesser extent, in reference to '''[[Levo-Transposition of the great arteries|levo-TGA]]''' ('''l-TGA''') – in which both the arteries and the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] are swapped; while other defects in this category are almost never referred to by either of these terms.

===Dextro-Transposition of the great arteries===

{{Main|dextro-Transposition of the great arteries}}
In [[dextro-Transposition of the great arteries]] (dextro-TGA) deoxygenated blood from the right heart is pumped immediately through the aorta and circulated to the body and the heart itself, bypassing the lungs altogether, while the left heart pumps oxygenated blood continuously back into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. In effect, two separate "[[logical fallacy|circular]]" (parallel) circulatory systems are created. It is called a [[cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic]] [[congenital]] [[congenital heart defect|heart defect]] ('''CHD''') because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen.

===Levo-Transposition of the great arteries===
{{Main|Levo-Transposition of the great arteries}}
Levo-Transposition of the great arteries is an [[acyanotic heart defect|acyanotic]] heart defect in which the primary arteries are transposed, with the aorta anterior and to the left of the pulmonary artery, and the morphological left and right ventricles are also transposed.

==Simple and complex TGV==
In many cases, TGV is accompanied by other heart defects, the most common type being [[wiktionary:intracardiac|intracardiac]] [[shunt (medical)|shunts]] such as [[atrial septal defect]] ('''ASD''') including [[patent foramen ovale]] ('''PFO'''), [[ventricular septal defect]] ('''VSD'''), and [[patent ductus arteriosus]] ('''PDA'''). [[Stenosis]], or other defects, of [[valve]]s and/or [[Blood vessel|vessels]] may also be present.

When no other heart defects are present it is called 'simple' TGV; when other defects are present it is called 'complex' TGV.

==Treatment==
For newborns with transposition, [[prostaglandins]] can be given to keep the [[ductus arteriosus]] [[Patent ductus arteriosus|open]] which allows mixing of the otherwise isolated pulmonary and systemic circuits. Thus oxygenated blood that recirculates back to the lungs can mix with blood that circulates throughout the body.  Surgical correction is the definitive treatment for a transposition.
