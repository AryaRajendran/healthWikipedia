In the human brain, the '''solitary nucleus''' ('''nucleus of the solitary tract''', '''''nucleus tractus solitarii''''', '''NTS''') is a series of [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] (clusters of nerve cell bodies) forming a vertical column of grey matter embedded in the [[medulla oblongata]]. Through the center of the NTS runs the [[solitary tract]], a white bundle of nerve fibers, including fibers from the [[facial nerve|facial]], [[glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]] and [[vagus nerve]]s that [[synapse]] on neurons of the NTS. The NTS projects to, among other regions, the [[reticular formation]], [[Preganglionic nerve fibers|parasympathetic preganglionic neuron]]s, [[hypothalamus]] and [[thalamus]], forming circuits that contribute to autonomic regulation. Cells within the NTS are arranged according to function; for instance, cells involved in taste are located in the higher, more forward ("rostral") part, while those regulating cardio-respiratory processes are found in the lower, more posterior ("caudal") part.<ref name="Haines2004">{{cite book|author=Duane E.

==Inputs to the NTS==

* Taste information from the facial nerve (anterior 2/3 of the tongue), glossopharyngeal nerve (posterior 1/3) and vagus nerve (small area on the epiglottis)
* Chemoreceptors in the [[carotid body]] via glossopharyngeal nerve, and [[Aortic body|aortic bodies]] via the vagus nerve  
* Chemically and mechanically sensitive neurons with endings located in the heart, lungs, airways, gastrointestinal system, and liver via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves

Neurons that synapse in the NTS mediate the [[gag reflex]], the carotid sinus reflex, the aortic reflex, the cough reflex, the baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, several respiratory reflexes and reflexes within the gastrointestinal system regulating [[motility]] and secretion. 

Information about the gut wall, the stretch of the [[lungs]], and the dryness of [[mucous membrane]]s also [[synapse]] at the NTS. The first central neurons within the NTS can participate in simple autonomic reflexes.

==Outputs from the NTS==

Information goes from the NTS to a large number of other regions of the brain including the [[paraventricular nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]] and the central nucleus of the [[amygdala]], as well as to other nuclei in the brainstem (such as the [[parabrachial area]] and other visceral motor or respiratory networks).<ref>{{cite book |first1=Neil R. |last1=Carlson |title=Physiology of Behavior |edition=10th |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |year=2010 |page=253 |isbn=978-0-205-66627-0}}</ref> The signals projected from the NTS to the parabrachial area originate in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. The pathways for gastric and gustatory (taste) processes are believed to terminate in different subdivisions of the parabrachial area, but still interact in the NTS.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(02)03438-8 |title=Oral and gastric input to the parabrachial nucleus of the rat |year=2002 |last1=Karimnamazi |first1=Hamid |last2=Travers |first2=Susan P |last3=Travers |first3=Joseph B |journal=Brain Research |volume=957 |issue=2 |pages=193–206 |pmid=12445962}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(98)00951-2 |title=Differential projections from gustatory responsive regions of the parabrachial nucleus to the medulla and forebrain |year=1998 |last1=Karimnamazi |first1=Hamid |last2=Travers |first2=Joseph B. |journal=Brain Research |volume=813 |issue=2 |pages=283–302 |pmid=9838165}}</ref> Some neuronal subpopulations in the NTS, such as the [[noradrenergic]] A2 neurons and the aldosterone-sensitive [[HSD2 neurons]] project as far rostrally as the [[bed nucleus of the stria terminalis]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16705681}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18853414}}</ref>
