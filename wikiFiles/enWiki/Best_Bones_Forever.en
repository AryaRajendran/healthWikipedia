''Best Bones Forever!'' is a national bone health campaign that encourages girls ages 9–14 to adopt healthy habits for bone growth and [[osteoporosis]] prevention. The campaign was created by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]’ Office on Women’s Health in 2009. The campaign uses popular language, bright colors and images, and energetic messages to express a focus on fun and friendship. ''Best Bones Forever!'' aims to improve girls’ bone health behaviors, which include eating foods with [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] and participating in regular [[physical activity]].

==Bone Health==
By the end of high school, girls develop up to 90% of their [[bone mass]].<ref>[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Juvenile/default.asp “Kids and Their Bones: A Parent’s Guide.”] Retrieved August 16, 2011.</ref> Therefore, it is critical that girls ages 9 to 18 build strong, healthy bones that will remain strong for life.<ref>[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Juvenile/default.asp “Kids and Their Bones: A Parent’s Guide.”] Retrieved August 16, 2011.</ref> Foods high in [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] and 60 minutes of daily bone-strengthening activity will help lower girls’ risk of developing [[Bone fractures|fractures]] or [[osteoporosis]] later in life.

=== Bone Healthy Foods ===
* '''Calcium:''' Girls ages 9 to 18 need 1,300 [[Milligrams|milligrams (mg)]] of calcium every day. One serving of low-fat or fat-free milk (1 cup) has about 300&nbsp;mg. Other foods with calcium include calcium-[[Food fortification|fortified]] orange juice (500&nbsp;mg), low-fat or fat-free yogurt (up to 450&nbsp;mg), cheese, fortified cereals, broccoli, and almonds.
* '''Vitamin D:''' In addition to calcium, adolescents need 600 [[International units|international units (IU)]] of vitamin D a day. The body needs vitamin D in order to absorb calcium.<ref>[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Nutrition/ “Calcium and Vitamin D: Important at Every Age.”] Retrieved August 16, 2011.</ref>
* '''Check labels:'''  Reading the [[Food label|Nutrition Facts Panel]] (otherwise known as the food label) on a package can reveal how healthy or unhealthy a food item is.
* '''Adding Up the Calcium:''' Nutrition Facts labels don't show how many milligrams of calcium are in a food item. Instead, they show the amount of calcium in a food as a percentage of the Daily Value (written as %Daily Value or %DV). To figure out milligrams on a food label, look at % Daily Value for calcium, and then add 0 to the end of that number. For example, girls need 130% DV for calcium every day. 130% Daily Value is the same amount as 1,300 milligrams of calcium. Note: This calculation works only for calcium, not for other nutrients on the food label.<ref>[http://bestbonesforever.gov/best_foods/food_labels.cfm “Foolin' Around with Food Labels.”] Retrieved August 18, 2011.</ref>
* '''Calcium Calculator:''' The ''Best Bones Forever!'' website offers a calcium calculator to help girls understand and increase their daily calcium intake.<ref>[http://bestbonesforever.gov/best_foods/calculator.cfm “Calcium Calculator.”] Retrieved August 18, 2011.</ref>

=== Physical Activity ===
Girls between the ages of 9 and 18 need 60 minutes of [[physical activity]] a day, including bone-strengthening activities at least three times a week such as running, jumping, hiking, playing soccer, and dancing.<ref>[http://bestbonesforever.gov/physical_activity/index.cfm “How Much Physical Activity Do You Need?”] Retrieved August 18, 2011.</ref>

Activity levels decrease as girls enter their teenage years.<ref>[http://www.girlshealth.gov/parents/bones/activity/index.cfm “Powerful Girls Need Physical Activity.”] Retrieved August 18, 2011.</ref> Encouraging girls to adopt physical activity as a lifelong habit or lifestyle may help them remain active throughout life.<ref>[http://www.girlshealth.gov/parents/bones/activity/index.cfm “Powerful Girls Need Physical Activity.”] Retrieved August 18, 2011.</ref>

==Campaign Highlights==
* '''The Let’s Dance Contest:''' In 2011, to encourage girls to get active, ''Best Bones Forever!'' teamed up with teen recording pop group Savvy to launch a national dance contest for girls between the ages of 9 and 18. To enter, girls were required to choreograph a 70 second dance to one of Savvy’s songs and upload it to the contest website. Submissions were judged based on creativity, how well they represented ''Best Bones Forever!'', how well they moved all the bones in their bodies, and for how well they worked as a team. Weekly prizes were awarded, and the grand prize was a trip to Los Angeles to appear in a Savvy music video.<ref>[http://bbfletsdance.com “Best Bones Forever!

* '''''Best Bones Forever!'' went to the White House:''' In 2011, the ''Best Bones Forever!'' team taught [[First Lady Michelle Obama]] how to do “the BBF,” a dance choreographed by ''Best Bones Forever!''. Representatives from Hager Sharp and OWH led a dance demonstration on the South Lawn of the [[White House]].

Event participants went home with free bone-health materials that included campaign journals, magnets, and playing cards.
* '''Atlanta Dance Contest & Weekend Jam:''' The ''Best Bones Forever!'' Weekend Jam was a weekend-long event for girls in 2010 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The event began with a dance competition featuring finalists from the ''Best Bones Forever!'' Atlanta Dance Contest, performances by Atlanta-based hip hop group Swagger Crew, and appearances from members of the Atlanta Dream Shooting Stars and Olympic gold medalist [[Allyson Felix]]. The winning team was dubbed Best Dancers Ever! and went home with prizes such as Wiis and Just Dance 2 games.
