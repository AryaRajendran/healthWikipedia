'''Physical fitness''' comprises two related concepts: general fitness (a state of [[health]] and well-being), and specific fitness (a task-oriented definition based on the ability to perform specific aspects of [[Outline of sports|sports]] or occupations). Physical fitness is generally achieved through correct [[nutrition]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], hygiene and [[rest]].

==Definitions==

Physical fitness has been defined as a set of attributes or characteristics that people have or achieve that relates to the ability to perform physical activity.The above definition from Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General is the most common currently used definition of physical fitness. It was originally used by Caspersen and has been used extensively. An alternative definition by Howley and Frank that provides additional descriptive information is: Physical fitness is a state of well-being with low risk of premature health problems and energy to participate in a variety of physical activities. While either is a good definition, most experts agree that physical fitness is both multidimensional and hierarchical.

In previous years{{When|date=June 2010}}, ''fitness'' was commonly defined as the capacity to carry out the day’s activities without undue fatigue. However, as automation increased leisure time, changes in lifestyles following the industrial revolution rendered this definition insufficient. In current contexts, ''physical fitness'' is considered a measure of the body’s ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be [[health]]y, to resist [[hypokinetic diseases]], and to meet emergency situations.<ref>{{cite web|title = President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Definitions for Health, Fitness, and Physical Activity|url = http://www.fitness.gov/digest_mar2000.htm|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.fitness.gov/digest_mar2000.htm|archivedate=August 25, 2012}}</ref>

The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports — a study group sponsored by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]]—declines to offer a simple definition of physical fitness.  Instead, it developed the following chart:

A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,<ref>{{cite web|title=Skill-related physical fitness essential for sports success|url=http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110617084150/http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archivedate=June 2011}}</ref> and on age-<ref>{{cite web|title = The elderly have specific fitness requirements|url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020201/419.html}}</ref> or health-related needs such as bone health.<ref>{{cite web|title=A targeted fitness program can increase Bone Integrity|url = http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Exercise/default.asp}}</ref>  Many sources{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} also cite [[mental health|mental]], [[social health|social]] and [[emotional health]] as an important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a [[triangle]] made up of three points, which represent physical, emotional, and mental fitness. Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many chronic health conditions brought on by unhealthy [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or aging.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/physicalactivity/| title = US Department of Health and Human Services Presentation: Physical Activity Fundamental to Preventing Disease}}</ref> Working out can also help people sleep better. To stay healthy it is important to engage in physical activity.<ref>{{cite web| title = How much physical activity do adults need?| url = http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html| authorlink = CDC}}</ref>

The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] encourages the adult public, ages 18 to 64, to engage each week in at least one and a quarter hours of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or two and a half hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity; that time can be met in any increments.<ref>{{cite web | title=How much physical activity do adults need?  | work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | url=http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html  | accessdate=2013-04-29 }}</ref>

Diet is an important component to overall health that works best in combination with exercise.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

==Training==
Specific or task-oriented fitness is a person's ability to perform in a specific activity with a reasonable efficiency: for example, sports or [[military service]]. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in their sports.

Examples are:
* [[100 m sprint]]: in a sprint the athlete must be trained to work anaerobically throughout the race, an example of how to do this would be interval training.
* [[Marathon]]: in this case the athlete must be trained to work aerobically and their endurance must be built-up to a maximum.
* Many fire fighters and police officers undergo regular [[Physical fitness test|fitness testing]] to determine if they are capable of the physically demanding tasks required of the job.<ref>{{cite web|title = Physical Fitness requirements for Santa Clara County firefighters| url = http://www.sccfd.org/physical_fitness.html#appendix2}}</ref>
* Soldiers of the [[United States Army]] must be able to pass the [[Army Physical Fitness Test]] (APFT).<ref>{{cite web|title=APFT Requirements|url =http://www.army.com/enlist/APFT.html}}</ref>
*Hill sprints, this training requires a level of fitness to begin with, the exercise is particularly good for the leg muscles. The army often trains doing mountain climbing and races.

==Menopause and Physical Fitness==
The menopausal period in women is frequently associated with many subjective complaints including vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbance, alteration in mood, lowered libido, and musculoskeletal pain. All of these symptoms could lead to a lower quality of life. Physical Fitness has the ability to alleviate or even eliminate the effect of most of these. Women experiencing their menopausal period should engage in regular exercise to achieve better physical fitness. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Allison MD|title=Menopause and physical fitness|journal=The North American Menopause Society|year=2009|month=September/October|volume=16|issue=5|pages=856–857|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>
