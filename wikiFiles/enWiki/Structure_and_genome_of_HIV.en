==Structure==
[[Image:HIV Virion-en-2.png|thumb|200px|Figure 1. Diagram of HIV]]

HIV is different in structure from other [[retrovirus]]es. It is around 120 [[nanometer|nm]] in diameter (around 60 times smaller than a [[red blood cell]]) and roughly spherical.

HIV-1 is composed of two copies of non-covalently linked positive single-stranded RNA enclosed by a conical capsid comprising the viral protein [[p24 capsid protein|p24]], typical of [[lentivirus]]es (Figure 1).<ref name="Montagnier, Luc 1999">Montagnier, Luc.

The single-strand RNA is tightly bound to the [[nucleocapsid]] proteins, [[p6 protein|p6]], [[p7 protein|p7]] and [[enzymes]] that are indispensable for the development of the virion, such as [[reverse transcriptase]] and [[integrase]]. The nucleocapsid (p7 and p6) associates with the genomic RNA (one molecule per hexamer) and protects the RNA from digestion by [[nuclease]]s. A matrix composed of an association of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid, ensuring the integrity of the virion particle. Also enclosed within the virion particle are [[Viral infectivity factor|Vif]], [[Vpr]], [[Nef (protein)|Nef]], p7 and viral [[Hiv protease|Protease]] (Figure 1). The envelope is formed when the capsid buds from the host cell, taking some of the host-cell membrane with it. The envelope includes the glycoproteins [[gp120]] and [[gp41]].

As a result of its role in virus-cell attachment, the structure of the virus envelope spike, consisting of gp120 and gp41, is of particular importance. It is hoped that determining the envelope spike's structure will contribute to scientific understanding of the virus and its replication cycle, and help in the creation of a cure.<ref name="urlBBC_NEWS_Health_3D_structure">{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4642940.stm | title =  3D structure of HIV is 'revealed' | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2006-01-24| format = | work = Health | publisher = BBC NEWS | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-08-06}}</ref> The first model of its structure was compiled in 2006 using [[cryo-electron tomography]] and suggested that each spike consists of a [[protein trimer|trimer]] of three gp120–gp41 [[heterodimer]]s.<ref name="Zhu1">{{cite journal |author=Zhu P |title=Distribution and three-dimensional structure of AIDS virus envelope spikes |journal=Nature |volume=15 |pages=817–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16728975 |doi=10.1038/nature04817 |issue=7095 |author-separator=, |author2=Liu J |author3=Bess J Jr |display-authors=3 |last4=Chertova |first4=Elena |last5=Lifson |first5=Jeffrey D. |last6=Grisé |first6=Henry |last7=Ofek |first7=Gilad A. |last8=Taylor |first8=Kenneth A. |last9=Roux |first9=Kenneth H.|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..847Z }}</ref> However, published shortly after was evidence for a single-stalk "mushroom" model, with a head consisting of a trimer gp120s and a gp41 stem, which appears as a compact structure with no obvious separation between the three monomers, anchoring it to the envelope.<ref name="Zanetti">{{cite journal |author=Zanetti G |title=Cryo-Electron Tomographic Structure of an Immunodeficiency Virus Envelope Complex In Situ |journal=PLoS Pathology |volume=2 |pages=e83 |year=2006 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0020083 |pmid=16933990 |issue=8 |pmc=1557830 |author-separator=, |author2=Briggs JAG |author3=Grunewald K |display-authors=3 |last4=Sattentau |first4=Quentin J. |last5=Fuller |first5=Stephen D.}}</ref> There are various possibilities as to the source of this difference, as it is unlikely that the viruses imaged by the two groups were structurally different.<ref name="Subramaniam">{{cite journal |author=Sriram Subramaniam |title=The SIV Surface Spike Imaged by Electron Tomography: One Leg or Three? |journal=PLoS Pathogens |volume=2 |pages=e91 |year=2006 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0020091 |pmid=16933994 |issue=8 |pmc=1557834}}</ref> More recently, further evidence backing up the heterodimer trimer-based model has been found.<ref name="Zhu2">{{cite journal |author=Zhu P |title=Cryoelectron Tomography of HIV-1 Envelope Spikes: Further Evidence for Tripod-Like Legs |journal=PLoS Pathogens |volume=4 |pages=e1000203 |year=2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000203 |url= |pmid=19008954 |issue=11 |pmc=2577619 |author-separator=, |author2=Winkler H |author3=Chertova E |display-authors=3 |editor1-last=Farzan |editor1-first=Michael |last4=Taylor |first4=Kenneth A. |last5=Roux |first5=Kenneth H.}}</ref>

==Genome organization==

HIV has several major genes coding for structural proteins that are found in all retroviruses, and several nonstructural ("accessory") genes that are unique to HIV. HIV has three major genes, 5'gag-pol-env-3', encoding major structural proteins as well as essential enzymes.<ref name="Mushahwar, Isa K. 2007">Mushahwar, Isa K. (2007) Human Immunodeficiency Viruses: Molecular Virology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. Perspectives in Medical Virology. 13:75-87</ref> These are synthesized as polyproteins which produce proteins for virion interior, called Gag, group specific antigen; the viral enzymes (Pol, polymerase) or the glycoproteins of the virion ''env'' (envelope).<ref name="Votteler, J 2008">Votteler, J. and Schubert, U. (2008) Human Immunodeficiency Viruses: Molecular Biology. Encyclopedia of Virology. (3rd ed.) 517-525</ref> In addition to these, HIV encodes for proteins which have certain regulatory and auxiliary functions as well.<ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/> HIV-1 has two important regulatory elements: Tat and Rev and few important accessory proteins such as Nef, Vpr, Vif and Vpu which are not essential for replication in certain tissues.<ref>Votteler, J. and Schubert, U. (2008) Human Immunodeficiency Viruses: Molecular Biology. Encyclopedia of Virology (3rd Ed) 517-525</ref> The ''gag'' gene provides the basic physical infrastructure of the virus, and ''pol'' provides the basic mechanism by which retroviruses reproduce, while the others help HIV to enter the host cell and enhance its reproduction. Though they may be altered by mutation, all of these genes except ''tev'' exist in all known variants of HIV; see [[HIV#Genetic_variability|Genetic variability of HIV]].

* ''gag'' ([[group-specific antigen]]):encodes for the precursor gag polyprotein, which is processed by viral protease during maturation to MA (matrix protein, p17); CA (capsid protein, [[P24 capsid protein|p24]]); SP1 (spacer peptide 1, p2); NC (nucleocapsid protein, [[p7 protein|p7]]); SP2 (spacer peptide 2, p1) and [[P6 protein|p6]].<ref name="King, Steven R. 1994">King, Steven R. (1994) HIV: Virology and Mechanisms of disease.  Annals of Emergency Medicine. 24:443-449</ref>
* ''[[Pol (HIV)|pol]]'': encodes for viral [[enzyme]]s [[reverse transcriptase]](RT) and RNase H, [[integrase]] (IN), and [[Hiv protease|HIV protease]] (PR).<ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/> HIV protease is required to cleave the precursor gag polyprotein to produce structural proteins, RT required to transcribe DNA from RNA template as well as IN to integrate the ds viral DNA into the host genome.<ref name="Mushahwar, Isa K. 2007"/>
* ''[[Env (gene)|env]]'' (for "envelope"): codes for gp160, which is cleaved by cellular protease rather than viral to produce the surface (SU) lipoprotein [[gp120]](SU)which attaches to the CD4 receptors present on lymphocytes and [[gp41]](transmembrane, TM), proteins embedded in the viral envelope that enable the virus to attach to and fuse with target cells.<ref name="Mushahwar, Isa K. 2007"/><ref name="King, Steven R. 1994"/>
* Essential regulatory elements: Tat and Rev

*'''Tat'''- HIV trans-activator(Tat)plays an important role in regulating the reverse transcription of viral genome RNA ensuring efficient synthesis of viral mRNAs as well as regulating the release of the virions from the infected cells.<ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/> Tat is expressed as 72-amino acid one-exon Tat as well as the 86-101 amino-acid two-exon Tat playing an important role early in HIV infection.Tat(14-15kDa) binds to the bulged genomic RNA stem-loop secondary structure near the 5' LTR region forming the Tat Responsive element (TAR).<ref name="Montagnier, Luc 1999"/><ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/>
*['''[Regulator of expression of Virion proteins (Rev)''''': The Rev protein binds to an arginine rich RNA-binding motif of the viral genome which acts as NLS (nuclear localization signals), required for the transport of Rev to the nucleus from cytosol during viral replication.<ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/> Rev recognizes a complex stem-loop structure of the mRNA ''env'' located in the intron separating coding exon of Tat and Rev which is known as the Rev response element (RRE).<ref name="Montagnier, Luc 1999"/><ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/> Rev is important for the synthesis of major viral proteins, hence essential for viral replication.
  
* Accessory regulatory proteins: Nef, Vpr, Vif and Vpu.
*"[[The lentivirus protein R (vpr)]]'': Vpr is a virion-associated, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling regulatory protein.<ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/> It is believed to play an important role in replication of the virus. It is believed to play an important role in nuclear import of preintegration complex as well as inducing arrest in G2 of cycling cells which activates the DNA repair machinery which could be used by the virus for the integration of the viral DNA.<ref name="Montagnier, Luc 1999"/>  HIV-2 and SIV encode an additional Vpr related protein called Vpx which functions sin association with Vpr.<ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/>

*''[[Viral infectivity factor|vif]]'',- Vif is a highly conserved, 23 kDa phosphoprotein important for the infectivity of HIV-1 virions depending on the cell-type.<ref name="Montagnier, Luc 1999"/> Some cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and  cell lines like H9 cells require Vif for synthesis of fully infectious viruses where as other cells such as Hela, Cos and others do not require Vif.<ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/>

*''[[Nef (protein)|nef]]''- Nef, negative factor, is a N-terminal myristoylated membrane-associated phosphoprotein. It is involved in multiple functions during the replication cycle of the virus. It is believed to play an important role in cell apoptosis and increase in virus infectivity.<ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/>  

*''[[vpu,Virus protein U]]''- Vpu is specific to HIV-1, is a class I oligomeric integral membrane phosphoprotein with numerous biological functions. It is involved in the CD4 degradation involving the ubiquitin proteasome pathway as well as in the successful release of the virions from the infected cells.<ref name="Montagnier, Luc 1999"/><ref name="Votteler, J 2008"/>

* ''tev'': This gene is only present in a few HIV-1 isolates. It is a fusion of parts of the ''tat'', ''env'', and ''rev'' genes, and codes for a protein with some of the properties of [[tat (HIV)|tat]], but little or none of the properties of [[Regulator of Virion|rev]].

HIV employs a sophisticated system of differential RNA splicing to obtain nine different gene products from a less than 10kb genome.<ref name="Feinberg 1992">Feinberg, Mark B and Greene, Warner C. (1992) Molecular Insights into human immunodeficiency virus type1 pathogenesis. Current Opinion in Immunology. 4:466-474.</ref> HIV has a 9.2kb unspliced genomic transcript which encodes for gag and pol precursors; a singly spliced, 4.5 kb encoding for env, Vif, Vpr and Vpu and a multiply spliced mRNA,2kb encoding for Tat, Rev and Nef.<ref name="Feinberg 1992"/>
