==Early life==
'''Julius Wagner''' was born on 7 March 1857 in Wels, Austria, the son of Adolph Johann Wagner.<ref name=PM>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7IjPkFIoz4C&pg=PA170&dq=Julius+Wagner-Jauregg,+born&lr=&cd=7#v=onepage&q=Julius%20Wagner-Jauregg%2C%20born&f=false "Physiology or medicine, 1922-1941"], Jan Lindsten. World Scientific, 1999. p. 170. ISBN 981-02-3410-4, ISBN 978-981-02-3410-2.</ref>  He attended the Schottengymnasium in Vienna before going on to study [[Medicine]] at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1874 to 1880, where he also studied with [[Salomon Stricker]] in the Institute of General and Experimental Pathology. He obtained his doctorate in 1880 with the thesis "L'origine et la fonction du cœur accéléré."<ref name=PM /> He left the institute in 1882.

==Later years==
After leaving the clinic, he conducted laboratory experiments with animals, which was practiced very little at this time.<ref name=PM /> From 1883 to 1887 he worked with [[Maximilian Leidesdorf]] in the Psychiatric Clinic, although his original training was not in the pathology of the nervous system. In 1889 he succeeded the famous [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] at the Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic of the [[University of Graz]], and started his research on [[Goitre]], [[cretinism]] and [[iodine]]. In 1893 he became Extraordinary Professor of Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases, and Director of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Nervous Diseases in [[Vienna]], as successor to [[Theodor Meynert]]. A student and assistant of Wagner-Jauregg during this time was [[Constantin von Economo]]. 

Ten years later, in 1902, Wagner-Jauregg moved to the psychiatric clinic at the General Hospital and in 1911 he returned to his former post.

===Nobel prize===
[[File:Pyrotherapy 1934 image.jpg|thumb|right|Wagner-Jauregg (center right in black jacket) watching a transfusion from a malaria patient (rear of the group) to a neurosyphilis victim (center) in 1934]]
The main work pursued by Wagner-Jauregg throughout his life was related to the treatment of [[mental disease]] by inducing a [[fever]], an approach known as [[pyrotherapy]]. In 1887 he investigated the effects of febrile diseases on [[psychoses]], making use of [[erisipela]] and [[tuberculin]] (discovered in 1890 by [[Robert Koch]]). Since these methods of treatment did not work very well, he tried in 1917 the inoculation of [[malaria]] parasites, which proved to be very successful in the case of dementia paralytica (also called [[general paresis of the insane]]), caused by [[neurosyphilis]], at that time a [[Terminal illness|terminal disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Raju T | title = Hot brains: manipulating body heat to save the brain | doi= 10.1542/peds.2005-1934 | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = e320–1 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16452338 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/117/2/e320}}</ref> It had been observed that some who develop high fevers could be cured of syphilis. Thus, for a brief time malaria was used as treatment for tertiary syphilis because it produced prolonged and high fevers (a form of pyrotherapy). This was considered an acceptable risk because the malaria could later be treated with quinine, which was available at that time. This discovery earned him the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1927. His main publication was a book titled ''Verhütung und Behandlung der progressiven Paralyse durch Impfmalaria'' (Prevention and treatment of progressive paralysis by malaria inoculation) in the Memorial Volume of the Handbuch der experimentellen Therapie, (1931).

===Sex treatment for psychosis===
Wagner-Jauregg administered thyroid and ovarian preparations to young psychotic patients who had experienced delayed puberty, which led to the development of their secondary sexual characteristics and diminished psychosis. Other patients were deemed [[schizophrenic]] because of excessive [[masturbation]], where Wagner-Jauregg sterilized them, resulting in an "improved" condition.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=naio6fyEWiEC&pg=PA23&dq=Wagner-Jauregg,+sterilization&hl=en&ei=117yS4KvFsP_lgfFlvitDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q&f=false "Endocrine Psychiatry: Solving the Riddle of Melancholia"], Edward Shorter, Max Fink. Oxford University Press US, 2010. p. 23. ISBN 0-19-973746-0, ISBN 978-0-19-973746-8.</ref>

==Retirement==
In 1928, Wagner-Jauregg retired from his post but remained active and in good health until his death on 27 September 1940. In his retirement he published nearly 80 scientific papers.<ref name=PM /> Many schools, roads and hospitals are named after him in Austria.

==Nazi ideology and affiliation==

Wagner-Jauregg advocated a racial hygiene ideology,<ref name=VM /> influencing students such as [[Alexander Pilcz]], who went on to author a standard handbook on racial psychiatry critical of Jews for being prone to mental illness.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=xZbcZm3JXggC&pg=PA105&dq=Julius+Wagner-Jauregg,+racial&lr=&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Julius%20Wagner-Jauregg%2C%20racial&f=false "Love+marriage: and other essays on representing difference"], Sander L.
