'''Eye surgery''', also known as '''ocular surgery''', is [[surgery]] performed on the [[human eye|eye]] or its [[Accessory visual structures|adnexa]], typically by an [[ophthalmologist]].<ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/La-Pa/Ophthalmologic-Surgery.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Ophthalmologic surgery]</ref>

==Preparation and precautions==
{{main|Anaesthesia for ocular surgery}}
The eye is a fragile organ, and requires extreme care before, during, and after a surgical procedure.  An expert eye surgeon is responsible for selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient, and for taking the necessary safety precautions.   

Since the eye is heavily supplied by nerves, anesthesia is essential.  Local anesthesia is most commonly used.  Topical [[anesthesia]] using [[lidocaine]] topical gel are often used for quick procedures.  Since topical anesthesia requires cooperation from the patient, [[general anesthesia]] is often used for children, traumatic eye injuries, major orbitotomies and for apprehensive patients.  The [[Anesthesiologist|physician administering anesthesia]] monitors the patient's cardiovascular status.  Sterile precautions are taken to prepare the area for surgery and lower the risk of infection.  Sterile precautions include the use of antiseptics like [[povidone-iodine]], sterile drapes, gowns and gloves.

==Laser eye surgery ==
Although the terms laser eye surgery and [[refractive surgery]] are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear), while [[radial keratotomy]] is an example of refractive surgery without the use of a laser.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/health-and-beauty/laser-eye-surgery-in-ireland/ | work=The Irish Times | title=Laser Eye Surgery | first=Stephen | last=Maguire}}</ref> Laser eye surgery or laser corneal sculpting is a medical procedure that uses a laser to reshape the surface of the eye. This is done to improve or correct myopia (short-sightedness), hypermetropia (long sightedness) and astigmatism (uneven curvature of the eye's surface).

==Cataract surgery==
{{Main|Cataract surgery}}
[[Image:Cataract surgery.jpg|thumb|216px|right|Cataract surgery, using a temporal approach phacoemulsification probe (in right hand) and "chopper"(in left hand) being done under operating microscope at a Navy medical center]]
A [[cataract]] is an opacification or cloudiness of the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] due to aging, disease, or trauma that typically prevents light from forming a clear image on the [[retina]]. If [[visual loss]] is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost [[optical power]] usually replaced with a plastic [[intraocular lens]] (IOL). Owing to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery. Rest after surgery is recommended.<ref>Uhr, Barry W. ''History of ophthalmology at Baylor University Medical Center''. Hi Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent). 2003 October; 16(4): 435–438. PMID 16278761</ref>

==Glaucoma surgery==
{{Main|Glaucoma surgery}}
[[Glaucoma]] is a group of diseases affecting the [[optic nerve]] that results in [[vision loss]] and is frequently characterized by raised [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP). There are many types of glaucoma surgery, and variations or combinations of those types, that facilitate the escape of excess [[aqueous humor]] from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, and a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous humor.

=== Canaloplasty ===
Canaloplasty is an advanced, nonpenetrating procedure designed to enhance drainage through the eye’s natural drainage system to provide sustained reduction of IOP. Canaloplasty utilizes microcatheter technology in a simple and minimally invasive procedure. 
To perform a canaloplasty, an Ophthalmologist creates a tiny incision to gain access to a canal in the eye. A microcatheter circumnavigates the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened. By opening up the canal, the pressure inside the eye can be reduced. Long-term results are available, published in the ''Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.''[https://mediamillinc.com/vjo.php?display=video&id=013] [http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(08)00004-7/abstract,][http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(07)00697-9/abstract][http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(09)00139-4/abstract]

==Oculoplastic surgery==
{{Main|Oculoplastics}}
Oculoplastic surgery, or oculoplastics, is the subspecialty of ophthalmology that deals with the reconstruction of the eye and associated structures. Oculoplastic surgeons perform procedures such as the repair of droopy eyelids ([[blepharoplasty]])[http://www.plasticsurgery.org/public_education/procedures/Blepharoplasty.cfm], repair of tear duct obstructions, orbital fracture repairs, removal of tumors in and around the eyes, and facial rejuvenation procedures including laser skin resurfacing, eye lifts, brow lifts, and even facelifts. Common procedures are:

===Eyelid surgery===
*Blepharoplasty (Eyelift)
**'''[[Blepharoplasty]]''' is [[plastic surgery]] of the [[eyelid]]s to remove excessive skin or subcutaneous fat.<ref>[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/A-Ce/Blepharoplasty.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Blepharoplasty]</ref>
***'''[[Asian blepharoplasty]]'''
*[[ptosis (eyelid)|Ptosis]] repair for droopy eyelid
**[[Ectropion]] repair [http://www.stlukeseye.com/Conditions/Ectropion.asp]
*[[Entropion]] repair
*Canthal resection
**A '''[[canthectomy]]''' is the surgical removal of tissue at the junction of the upper and lower eyelids.<ref name="Cline">Cline D; Hofstetter HW; Griffin JR. ''Dictionary of Visual Science''. 4th ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston 1997. ISBN 0-7506-9895-0</ref>
**'''[[Cantholysis]]''' is the surgical division of the canthus.<ref name="Cline"/>
**'''[[Canthopexy]]'''
**A '''[[canthoplasty]]''' is plastic surgery at the canthus.<ref name="Cline"/>
**A '''[[canthorrhaphy]]''' is suturing of the outer canthus to shorten the [[palpebral fissure]].<ref name="Cline"/>
**A '''[[canthotomy]]''' is the surgical division of the canthus, usually the outer canthus.<ref name="Cline"/>
***A '''[[lateral canthotomy]]''' is the surgical division of the outer canthus.
*'''[[Epicanthoplasty]]'''
*'''[[Tarsorrhaphy]]''' is a procedure in which the [[eyelid]]s are partially sewn together to narrow the opening (i.e. [[palpebral fissure]]).

===Orbital surgery===
*Orbital reconstruction / [[Ocular prosthetic]]s (False Eyes)
*Orbital decompression for Grave's Disease. Grave's Disease is a condition (often associated with over-active thyroid problems) in which the eye muscles swell. Because the eye socket is bone, there is nowhere for the swelling to be accommodated and as a result the eye is pushed forward into a protruded position. In some patients this is very pronounced. Orbitial decompression involves removing some bone from the eye socket to open up one or more [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]]es and so make space for the swollen tissue and allowing the eye to move back into normal position.

===Other oculoplastic surgery===
*[[Botox]] injections
*Ultrapeel [[Microdermabrasion]]
*Endoscopic forehead and browlift
*Face lift ([[Rhytidectomy]])
*[[Liposuction]] of the face and neck
*'''[[Browplasty]]''' [http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic100.htm]

==Other surgery==
Many of these described procedures are historical and are not recommended due to a risk of complications.
