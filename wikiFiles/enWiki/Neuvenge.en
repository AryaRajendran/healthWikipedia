'''Neuvenge''', Lapuleucel-T (APC 8024), is a therapeutic [[cancer vaccine]] (TCV) in development ([[clinical trial]]) by [[Dendreon]] (DNDN). It uses the "[[immunotherapy]] platform approach" first successfully demonstrated on the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)-approved TCV [[Provenge]]. It was first tested on [[breast cancer]] patients with tumors expressing [[HER2/neu]],<ref>{{cite press release |title=Phase 1 Study Of Lapuleucel-T In Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Is Promising |publisher=Dendreon Corporation |date=August 21, 2007 |url=http://www.emaxhealth.com/98/15164.html |accessdate=January 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peethambaram |first1=P.

==History==

The concept of immunotherapy for cancer has been known for hundreds of years and was used by Dr William Coley et al. in the 1800s.<ref>http://www.oncbiz.com/documents/OBR_JAN10_CV.pdf</ref> [[Coley's Toxins]] are still available outside of the US. The idea of harnessing the [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC)'s to recognize cancer and target tumor cells for [[apoptosis]] (cell death) by the [[CD8]] ([[cytotoxic]] cells) is a common approach to cancer vacine researchers.
This 1997 example article describes targeting [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|EGFR]] and other cell products and attaching their antigens to the [[CD64 (biology)|CD64]] receptor cells also using [[GM-CSF]] to grow more cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Curnow |first1=Randall T. |title=Clinical experience with CD64-directed immunotherapy. An overview |journal=Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy |volume=45 |pages=210–5 |year=1997 |doi=10.1007/s002620050435 |pmid=9435876}}</ref> The NIH calls this topic "Biological response modifiers (BRMs) occur naturally in the body and can be produced in the laboratory. BRMs alter the interaction between the body's immune defenses and cancer cells to boost, direct, or restore the body's ability to fight the disease." <ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/biological Biological Therapies for Cancer: Q & A - National Cancer Institute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Immunocompromising diseases have caused many deaths in human history. An ongoing example is [[Karposi's sarcoma]] (KS) caused by the [[Human herpesvirus 8]] virus normally controlled by the body's immune system. KS is normally a rare  diseaae but [[AIDS]] has made it all to commonplace. AIDS patients, whose immune system has been compromised, fall victim to serious [[opportunistic infections]] such as ([[Tuberculosis|TB]]) and KS. The movie "[[Philadelphia (film)]]" gives a dramatic representation of AIDS and KS. A good method of preventing some cancers is to stop the viruses that lead to them. This is known as prophylatic treatment.
The current cancer prophylactic vaccines are for [[HVB]] (hepatitus "B" virus), [[HPV]] ([[cervical cancer]], [[vaginal]], [[vulvar cancer]], [[penile]], [[anal cancer]]) and [[HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer]] are all defenses utilizing immunotherapy against viruses that lead to cancer.

==Milestones==

"A successful (TCV) is considered a milestone for cancer immunotherapy." <ref>[http://www.brighthub.com/health/cancer/articles/84333.aspx Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy - The Provenge Prostate Cancer Vaccine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The only approved TCVs, as of 2010, are Provenge in the US and [[Oncogene]] in Russia.{{fact|date=January 2013}} DNDN's future will require a different skill set to manage the [[mass production]] of this first-of-a-kind product.{{fact|date=January 2013}}  There are 32,000+/yr deaths from [[prostate cancer]] (CaP) in the US and that is only those with metastatic [[Castration-resistant prostate cancer|CRPC]].{{fact|date=January 2013}}  If most of these patients were to receive this product that would increase current 2,000 output 16X.{{fact|date=January 2013}}  When (If) the project is expanded to those whose CaP is still controlled by hormone therapy that number could easily quadruple for the US alone.{{fact|date=January 2013}}  Were this therapy to be used on ALL Prostate cancer patients as a [[monotherapy]] that's (120,000+/yr.in the US).{{fact|date=January 2013}}  If those who are still on hormone therapy the numbers are in the millions.{{fact|date=January 2013}}  There are currently 2,000,000+ CaP patients in the US.{{fact|date=January 2013}} 
DNDN is busy building plants, which all require FDA approval, in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey]], [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and ([[Los Angeles County, California]] area) [[Seal Beach, California]] (actually in [[Orange County, California]]) for large scale Provenge production.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ApprovedProducts/ucm213732.htm Review Memo of the 483 Responses for the 2010 PLI at Dendreon’s Manufacturing Facility for Sipuleucel-T at Morris Plains, New Jersey - Provenge<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They are still seeking overseas partners for development offshore.

==Prospects==
DNDN have stated that their therapy is not a one-hit wonder and they plan to "move forward one Provenge-like new cancer treatment every year". This will demonstrate that they really have an immunotherapy platform approach to cancer.<ref>[http://www.xconomy.com/seattle/2009/09/24/dendreon-to-turn-in-provenge-application-to-fda-in-mid-november/ Dendreon to Turn in Provenge Application to FDA in Mid-November | Xconomy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Combinational therapy==
Involves using:
*Primary care
**surgery
**radiation
*[[Adjuvant]] care
**hormone deprevation for those cancers effected by [[sex steroids]]
**[[chemotherapy]]
**therapeutic vaccine therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doehn |first1=Christian |last2=Böhmer |first2=Torsten |last3=Kausch |first3=Ingo |last4=Sommerauer |first4=Martin |last5=Jocham |first5=Dieter |title=Prostate cancer vaccines: current status and future potential |journal=BioDrugs |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=71–84 |year=2008 |pmid=18345705 |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?issn=1173-8804&volume=22&issue=2&spage=71}}</ref> Immunotherapy has added another tool or leg for [[Oncologist]] to fight cancer. This therapy could be a part of all the other therapys listed.

==Neuvenge history==
Neuvenge is still in preliminary clinical trials and is evolving as of 2011. First Neuvenge trials were performed on patients with metastatic breast, ovarian or colorectal cancer that expressed HER-2 (HER2/neu). Some patients with stable disease after week 48 received an additional "booster" treatment using the identical protocol. Lapuleucel-T is an investigational active immunotherapy product consisting of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including antigen presenting cells, which are cultured ex vivo with BA7072, a recombinant fusion antigen consisting of portions of the intracellular and extracellular regions of HER-2/neu linked to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
In a change of course, DNDN is planning a bladder cancer clinical trial using Neuvenge to begin 2011.
<ref>[http://www.dendreon.com/research-development/lapuleucel-t/ Cancer Treatment, Active Cellular Immunotherapy - Dendreon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> DNDN is also using ACI technology Active cellular immunotherapy <ref>[http://www.dendreon.com/research-development/ACIproductcandidate/ ACI Product Candidate - Ovarian, Colon Cancer Treatment - Dendreon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "This is  a therapuetic platform using the patient's own cells to simulate an immune response." These are two major candidates:
*Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) for kidney, colon, cervical cancers
*Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for breast, lung and colon cancers
