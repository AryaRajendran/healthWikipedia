'''The National Institute for Medical Research''', commonly abbreviated to '''NIMR''', is a [[medical research]] [[Research institute|institute]] based in [[Mill Hill]], on the outskirts of [[London]], [[England]]. It is principally funded by the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), and is its largest establishment and one of only three designated as an 'Institute'. 

In 2015 the NIMR is planned to move to the new [[Francis Crick Institute]] being constructed next to [[St Pancras railway station]] in the [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] area of [[Central London]].

==History==
===Foundation===
[[File:Henry Dale nobel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Hallett Dale]]]]
The Medical Research Council, founded in 1913, was immediately charged with establishing a central research institute in London. Later that year, premises at [[Hampstead]] were acquired and the National Institute for Medical Research was founded.

However, the outbreak of [[World War I]] soon after postponed occupation of the building, although senior staff were appointed and began work. By 1920 the Institute at [[Mount Vernon Hospital]] was fully operational and remained so for 30 years until the move to its current location at Mill Hill. The original Institute, under the directorship of Sir [[Henry Hallett Dale|Henry Dale]], had three divisions:

* [[Bacteriology]]
* [[Biochemistry]] and [[Pharmacology]]
* Applied [[Physiology]]

Dale oversaw a period of considerable success at NIMR, including the discovery of the human [[influenza virus]] in 1933 and the discovery of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]], for which Dale himself received the 1936 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].

===Moving to Mill Hill===
In the 1930s the decision was made to move the Institute to new premises. An imposing copper-roofed building at Mill Hill was designed by [[Maxwell Ayrton]], also the architect of the original [[Wembley Stadium]], and construction began in 1937. Once again, occupation was delayed when [[World War II|war]] broke out in 1939 and the building was given to the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]. The building was returned to the MRC in autumn 1949 but Sir Henry Dale had retired in 1942 and so was never director on the new site, that job falling to his successor Sir [[Charles Robert Harington|Charles Harington]].

The official [[opening ceremony]] took place on the 5 May 1950, with their Majesties [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and [[Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] present. Harington expanded the research programme into ten divisions during his 20 year tenure and guided researchers at the Institute to, amongst other achievements, the development of [[gas chromatography]] and the discovery of [[interferon]]. From 1950-55 [[Albert Neuberger]] was Head of Biochemistry at the Institute.

In 1962, Nobel Prize winner Sir [[Peter Medawar]] became director and, consistent with his research interests, established NIMR as a major centre for [[immunology|immunological research]]. Following an illness, Medawar retired as director in 1971 to be replaced by Sir [[Arnold Burgen]]. Burgan had an interest in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] techniques and formed the MRC Biomedical NMR Centre at the Institute in 1980. Sir Dai Rees became director in 1982 to be replaced by Sir [[John Skehel]] in 1987. Since then NIMR has continued to excel scientifically reporting, perhaps most famously, the discovery of the [[sex]] determining gene [[SRY]], in 1991.

===2000 to present===
In 2003, as part of their Forward Investment Strategy, the MRC announced plans to consider moving NIMR from its current location to a university/medical school site, to enhance its ability "to translate its biomedical research into practical health outcomes."

Some staff at the NIMR, including [[Robin Lovell-Badge]] and John Skehel, expressed opposition to a move. In response to accusations of "[[coercion]]" during the review process, a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] investigation criticised both the MRC for losing the confidence of NIMR workers, and unnamed NIMR staff for "undermining [[Colin Blakemore|[Colin] Blakemore's]] position as MRC chief executive." <ref>http://www.the-scientist.com/news/20050208/01/</ref><ref>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmsctech/6/608.htm</ref>

In September 2006, Sir John Skehel retired as NIMR director <ref>http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/news/2006/skehel_model/</ref> and Sir [[Keith Peters (Medicine)|Keith Peters]] became acting director <ref>http://www.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/about/orgstructure/list/</ref> until the future structure of the new institute could be finalised. In July of that year the MRC announced that [[Scott Fraser (scientist)|Scott Fraser]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] had been invited to take over the directorship. <ref>http://www.mrc.ac.uk/consumption/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=5869&dDocName=MRC002982&allowInterrupt=1</ref> According to Blakemore, negotiations were ongoing as of December 2006.<ref name="parliament"/> However, finally, in October 2008, Jim Smith of the [[Gurdon Institute]], [[University of Cambridge]] (who worked at the NIMR from 1984 to 2000), accepted the Directorship, with effect from January 2009.

The construction of the new NIMR facility is scheduled to begin in July 2011. The new centre is to be called the [[Francis Crick Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crick.ac.uk/news/press-releases/a-new-name-for-ukcmri|title=A new name for UKCMRI|date=25 May 2011|work=crick.ac.uk|publisher=The Francis Crick Institute|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref>

==Activities==
[[File:NIMR building.JPG|thumb|right|The main building of the National Institute for Medical Research]]
===Research===
The National Institute for Medical Research specialises in the following four main research areas:

* [[Genetics]] and Development;
* [[Infections]] and [[immunity (medical)|Immunity]];
* [[Neuroscience]]s; and
* [[Structural biology|Structural Biology]].

There are 18 divisions, over 200 scientists and at least 200 other trained personnel, including postgraduate students. The NIMR's annual research budget is Â£25 million.

===Mill Hill Essays===
A yearly collection of essays are produced by guest authors and staff at the Institute, under the title [[Mill Hill Essays]]. They are written to be accessible and informative to the lay reader. Or are they?

==Animal testing==
Some scientists at NIMR perform [[Animal testing|research on animals]]. Because of this, and the perception that the Institute is the MRC's [[flagship]] facility,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} there were weekly protests by members of [[animal rights]] groups outside the complex. These protests usually took place on a Wednesday evening,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and normally had a low attendance (5 people or less).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==In fiction==
The rooms and other locations in the building were used in the film ''[[Batman Begins]]'', for the [[Arkham Asylum]] scenes.<ref>http://www.edgwaretimes.co.uk/display.var.606532.0.0.php?utag=8269</ref>
