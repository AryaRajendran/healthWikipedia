The '''2009 flu pandemic vaccines''' are the set of [[influenza vaccine]]s that have been developed to protect against the [[pandemic H1N1/09 virus]]. These vaccines either contain inactivated (killed) influenza virus, or weakened live virus that cannot cause influenza. The killed vaccine is injected, while the live vaccine is given as a nasal spray. Both these types of vaccine are usually produced by growing the virus in chicken eggs. Around three billion doses will be produced annually, with delivery from November 2009.<ref name=AFP_WHO20090924>

Early results (pre-25 December 2009) from an observational cohort of 248,000 individuals in Scotland have shown the vaccine to be effective at preventing H1N1 influenza (95.0% effectiveness [95% confidence intervals (CI) 76.0–100.0]) and influenza related hospital admissions (64.7% [95%CI 12.0–85.8]).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simpson CR, Ritchie LD, Robertson C, Sheikh A, McMenamin J. |title=Vaccine effectiveness in pandemic influenza – primary care reporting (VIPER): an observational study to assess the effectiveness of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)v vaccine |journal=Health Technol Assess |volume=14 |issue=34 |pages=313–46|year=2010 |pmid=20630126 |doi=10.3310/hta14340-05 |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/fullmono/mon1434.pdf |layurl=http://www.netscc.ac.uk/pandemicflu/reports/summ1434-05.pdf| accessdate=23 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Developing, testing, and manufacturing sufficient quantities of a vaccine is a process that takes many months. According to Keiji Fukuda of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), "There's much greater vaccine capacity than there was a few years ago, but there is not enough vaccine capacity to instantly make vaccines for the entire world's population for influenza."<ref name=Economist>{{cite news |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/printer/news/455987/ |title=Preparing for the worst |newspaper=[[The Financial Express]] |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=6 December 2009}}</ref> Nasal mist version of the vaccine started shipping on 1 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=First round of swine flu vaccine shipped to Texas, other states |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/100109dnmetswinevaccine.1d4b92c27.html |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kGGfFAUR |archivedate=3 October 2009 |deadurl=no |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref>

==Types of vaccine==
Two types of influenza vaccines are available:

*TIV (flu shot ([[Injection (medicine)|injection]]) of '''t'''rivalent (three strains; usually A/H1N1, A/[[H3N2]], and B) '''i'''nactivated (killed) '''v'''accine) or
*LAIV (nasal spray (mist) of [[live attenuated influenza vaccine|'''l'''ive '''a'''ttenuated '''i'''nfluenza '''v'''accine]].)

TIV works by putting into the bloodstream those parts of three strains of flu virus that the body uses to create antibodies; while LAIV works by inoculating the body with those same three strains, but in a modified form that cannot cause illness.

LAIV is not recommended for individuals under age 2 or over age 49,<ref>{{cite web

==Manufacturing methods==
For the inactivated vaccines, the virus is grown by injecting it, along with some [[antibiotic]]s, into fertilized chicken eggs. About one to two eggs are needed to make each dose of vaccine.<ref name=GSKcellcult>[http://www.gsk.com/press_archive/press2005/flu_backgrounder.pdf Egg-based vs. cell-based influenza vaccine production]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}. [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. 2005</ref> The virus replicates within the [[allantois]] of the embryo, which is the equivalent of the [[placenta]] in mammals. The fluid in this structure is removed and the virus purified from this fluid by methods such as [[filtration]] or [[centrifugation]]. The purified viruses are then inactivated ("killed") with a small amount of a disinfectant. The inactivated virus is treated with detergent to break up the virus into particles, and the broken capsule segments and released proteins are concentrated by centrifugation. The final preparation is suspended in sterile [[phosphate buffered saline]] ready for injection.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm181950.htm Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent] [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).</ref> This vaccine mainly contains the killed virus but might also contain tiny amounts of egg protein and the antibiotics, disinfectant and detergent used in the manufacturing process. In multi-dose versions of the vaccine, the preservative [[thimerosal]] is added to prevent growth of bacteria. In some versions of the vaccine used in Europe and Canada, such as ''Arepanrix'' and ''Fluad'', an [[immunologic adjuvant|adjuvant]] is also added, this contains a fish oil called [[squalene]], [[vitamin E]] and an [[emulsifier]] called [[polysorbate 80]].<ref name=QuickRef>[http://www.wrha.mb.ca/professionals/influenza/files/orientation/Orientation_4-A.pdf Pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) Influenza Vaccine Quick Reference Guide]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}. Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. 2009.</ref>

For the live vaccine, the virus is first adapted to grow at {{convert|25|°C|°F}} and then grown at this temperature until it loses the ability to cause illness in humans, which would require the virus to grow at our normal body temperature of {{convert|37|°C|°F}}. Multiple mutations are needed for the virus to grow at cold temperatures, so this process is effectively irreversible and once the virus has lost [[virulence]] (become "attenuated"), it will not regain the ability to infect people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Murphy BR, Coelingh K |title=Principles underlying the development and use of live attenuated cold-adapted influenza A and B virus vaccines |journal=Viral Immunol. |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=295–323 |year=2002 |pmid=12081014 |doi=10.1089/08828240260066242}}</ref> To make the vaccine, the attenuated virus is grown in chicken eggs as before. The virus-containing fluid is harvested and the virus purified by filtration; this step also removes any contaminating bacteria. The filtered preparation is then diluted into a solution that stabilizes the virus. This solution contains [[monosodium glutamate]], [[potassium phosphate]], [[gelatin]], the antibiotic [[gentamicin]], and sugar.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm181970.htm Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine (MedImmune LLC)] [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).</ref>

A new method of producing influenza virus is used to produce the [[Novartis]] vaccine [[Optaflu]]. In this vaccine the virus is grown in [[cell culture]] instead of in eggs.<ref>[http://emc.medicines.org.uk/document.aspx?documentId=20429 Optaflu Vaccine]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} Electronic Medicines Compendium 2009</ref> This method is faster than the classic egg-based system and produces a purer final product. Importantly, there are no traces of egg proteins in the final product, so the vaccine is safe for people with egg allergies.<ref>[http://www.novartisvaccines.com/downloads/diseases-products/flu-cell-culture-fact-sheet.pdf Flu Cell Culture Manufacturing and the Novartis Proprietary Cell Line] ''Novartis'' June 2009</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Doroshenko A, Halperin SA |title=Trivalent MDCK cell culture-derived influenza vaccine Optaflu (Novartis Vaccines) |journal=Expert Rev Vaccines |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=679–88 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19485748 |doi=10.1586/erv.09.31}}</ref>

==Production questions and decisions==
===Questions===
There was concern in mid-2009 that, should a second, deadlier wave of this new H1N1 strain appear during the northern autumn of 2009, producing pandemic vaccines ahead of time could turn out to be a serious waste of resources as the vaccine might not be effective against it, and there would also be a shortage of seasonal flu vaccine available if production facilities were switched to the new vaccine.<ref name=Economist/> Seasonal flu vaccine was being made as of May 2009, according to [[WebMD]]. The news site added that although vaccine makers would be ready to switch to making a swine flu vaccine, many questions remained unanswered, including: "Should we really make a swine flu vaccine? Should we base a vaccine on the current virus, since flu viruses change rapidly? Vaccine against the current virus might be far less effective against a changed virus – should we wait to see if the virus changes? If vaccine production doesn't start soon, swine flu vaccine won't be ready when it's needed."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20090526/cdc-preparing-for-swine-flu-surge-in-fall |title=CDC prepares for swine flu surge in fall |work= [[WebMD]] |date=26 May 2009 | author = Daniel J.

The costs of producing a vaccine also became an issue, with some U.S. lawmakers questioning whether a new vaccine was worth the unknown benefits. Representatives [[Phil Gingrey]] and [[Paul Broun]], for instance, were not convinced that the U.S. should spend up to US$2 billion to produce one, with Gingrey stating "We can't let all of our spending and our reaction be media-driven in responding to a panic so that we don't get Katrina-ed. ... It's important because what we are talking about as we discuss the appropriateness of spending $2 billion to produce a vaccine that may never be used – that is a very important decision that our country has to make."<ref name=Gingrey>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0509/22205.html |title=Republican doctors question virus vaccine |work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |date=7 May 2009 | quote = We can't let all of our spending and our reaction be media-driven in responding to a panic so that we don't get Katrina-ed. ...

Before the pandemic was declared, the WHO said that if a pandemic was declared it would attempt to make sure that a substantial amount of vaccine was available for the benefit of developing countries. Vaccine makers and countries with standing orders, such as the U.S. and a number of European countries, would be asked, according to WHO officials, "to share with developing countries from the moment the first batches are ready if an H1N1 vaccine is made" for a pandemic strain.<ref name=Vaccine>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iDCW8up896awdNRubgB9LXBs0WcQ |title=Developing countries should share first batches of swine flu vaccine: WHO |agency=The Canadian Press |date=6 May 2009| accessdate=25 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> The global body stated that it wanted companies to donate at least 10% of their production or offer reduced prices for poor countries that could otherwise be left without vaccines if there is a sudden surge in demand.<ref name=AP-vaccine-2>{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gzz357patY4-QaJFvo9O95zMM_EQD989H17O1 |title=WHO seeks swine flu vaccine help for poor nations |agency=[[Associated Press]] |place=Geneva, |date=19 May 2009| accessdate=25 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref>

[[Gennady Onishchenko]], Russia's chief doctor, said on 2 June 2009 that swine flu was not aggressive enough to cause a worldwide pandemic, noting that the current mortality rate of confirmed cases was 1.6% in Mexico and only 0.1% in the United States. He stated at a press conference, "So far it is unclear if we need to use vaccines against the flu because the virus that is now circulating throughout Europe and North America does not have a pandemic nature." In his opinion, a vaccine could be produced, but said that preparing a vaccine now would be considered "practice," since the world would soon need a new vaccine against a new virus. "What's 16,000 sick people? During any flu season, some 10,000 a day become ill in Moscow alone," he said.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2009/06/sec-090602-rianovosti01.htm "Russia's chief doctor rules out chance of swine flu pandemic"] GlobalSecurity.org, 2 June 2009</ref>

===Production timelines===
After a meeting with the WHO on 14 May 2009, pharmaceutical companies said they were ready to begin making a swine flu vaccine. According to news reports, the WHO's experts will present recommendations to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, who was expected to issue advice to vaccine manufacturers and the Sixty-second World Health Assembly.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2009/wha62/en/index.html Sixty-second World Health Assembly] [[World Health Organization]]</ref><ref>

|date=14 May 2009
|accessdate=6 December 2009}}</ref> WHO's [[Keiji Fukuda]] told reporters "These are enormously complicated questions, and they are not something that anyone can make in a single meeting." Most flu vaccine companies can not make both seasonal flu vaccine and pandemic flu vaccine at the same time. Production takes months and it is impossible to switch halfway through if health officials make a mistake. If the swine flu mutates, scientists aren't sure how effective a vaccine made now from the current strain will remain.<ref name=Vaccine_AP/> Rather than wait on the WHO decision, however, some countries in Europe have decided to go ahead with early vaccine orders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=a_2jDXJCigho&refer=uk |agency=Bloomberg |date=15 May 2009 |title=Glaxo to make flu vaccine, gets U.K., France orders (update2)| accessdate=25 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

On 20 May 2009, AP reported: "Manufacturers won't be able to start making the [swine flu] vaccine until mid-July at the earliest, weeks later than previous predictions, according to an expert panel convened by WHO. It will then take months to produce the vaccine in large quantities. The swine flu virus is not growing very fast in laboratories, making it difficult for scientists to get the key ingredient they need for a vaccine, the 'seed stock' from the virus [...] In any case, mass producing a pandemic vaccine would be a gamble, as it would take away manufacturing capacity for the seasonal flu vaccine for the flu that kills up to 500,000 people each year. Some experts have wondered whether the world really needs a vaccine for an illness that so far appears mild."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-05-19-who-swine-flu_N.htm |title=WHO seeks swine flu vaccine help for poor nations |work=USA Today |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref>

Another option proposed by the CDC was an "earlier rollout of seasonal vaccine," according to the CDC's Dr. Daniel Jernigan. He said the CDC would work with vaccine manufacturers and experts to see if that would be possible and desirable. Flu vaccination usually starts in September in the United States and peaks in November. Some vaccine experts agree it would be better to launch a second round of vaccinations against the new H1N1 strain instead of trying to add it to the seasonal flu vaccine or replacing one of its three components with the new H1N1 virus.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/20/idUSN20521380 |title=U.S. officials consider bumping up flu shot season |agency=Reuters |date=20 May 2009 | first=Maggie | last=Fox| accessdate=13 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110203004640/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/20/idUSN20521380| archivedate= 3 February 2011| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Adverse events==
A review by the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 ("swine flu") vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of seasonal vaccine.<ref name=NYT_GRADY />

In an initial clinical trial in Australia, non-serious adverse events were reported by about half of the 240 people vaccinated, with these events including tenderness and pain at the site of injection, headache, malaise, and muscle pain.<ref name=Greenberg/> Two people had more severe events, with a much longer spell of nausea, muscle pain and malaise that lasted several days. The authors stated that the frequency and severity of these adverse events were similar to those normally seen with seasonal influenza vaccines.<ref name=Greenberg/> A second trial involved 2,200 people ranging from 3 to 77 years of age.<ref name=Zhu>{{cite journal |author=Zhu FC, Wang H, Fang HH, ''et al.'' |title=A Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Vaccine in Various Age Groups |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]]|volume= 361|issue= 25|pages= 2414–23|year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19846844 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0908535}}</ref> In this study no patients reported serious adverse events, with the most commonly observed events being pain at the injection site and fever, which occurred in 10–25% of people.<ref name=Zhu/> Although this trial followed up patients individually, the Government has been criticized for relying on voluntary reporting for post-vaccination evaluation in other circumstances, since this is "unlikely to accurately measure the percentage of people who get adverse effect".<ref name=ap01>{{cite journal |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/upload/pdf/articles/1084.pdf |title=H1N1 immunisation: Too much, too soon? |author=Collignon, P |journal=Aust Prescr |pages=30–31 |volume=33 |issue=2 |year=2010 |month=April |issn=0312-8008 | accessdate=13 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

{{As of|2009|11|19}}, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that 65 million doses of vaccine had been administered and that it had a similar safety profile to the seasonal flu vaccine, with no significant differences in the adverse events produced by the different types of vaccine.<ref name=Kieny>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/vpc_transcript_19_november_09_kieny.pdf Transcript of virtual press conference with Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, Director, Initiative for Vaccine Research] [[World Health Organization]]. 19 November 2009.</ref> There has been one report of an adverse event per 10,000 doses of vaccine, with only five percent of these adverse events being serious, an overall rate of serious events of one in 200,000 doses.<ref name=Kieny/>

In Canada, after 6.6 million doses of vaccine had been distributed between 21 October and 7 November, there were reports of mild adverse events in 598 people vaccinated including: nausea, dizziness, headache, fever, vomiting, and swelling or soreness at the injection site. There were reports of tingling lips or tongue, difficulty breathing, hives, and skin rashes. Thirty six people had serious adverse events, including [[anaphylaxis]] and febrile convulsions. The rate of serious adverse events is one in 200,000 doses distributed, which according to Canada's chief public health officer, is less than expected for the seasonal flu vaccine. GlaxoSmithKline recalled a batch of vaccine in Canada after it appeared to cause higher rates of adverse events than other batches.<ref name=Smith/>

In the USA 46 million doses had been distributed {{As of|2009|11|20|lc=on}} and 3182 adverse events were reported. The CDC stated that the "vast majority" were mild, with about one serious adverse event in 260,000 doses.<ref>[http://vaers.hhs.gov/resources/2009H1N1Summary_Nov25.pdf Summary of 2009 Monovalent H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Data – Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System].

In Japan around 15 million people had been vaccinated by 31 December 2009. 1,900 cases of side effects and 104 cases of death were reported from medical institutions. The health ministry announced that it will conduct epidemiologic investigation.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20091231a7.html H1N1 vaccine death probe set]. ''[[The Japan Times]]''. 31 December 2009.</ref>

In France, around five million people had been vaccinated by 30 December 2009. 2,657 cases of side effects, eight cases of intrauterine death and five cases of miscarriages were reported after vaccination by [[afssaps]].<ref>{{cite web

Rare potential adverse events are temporary bleeding disorders and [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]] (GBS), a serious condition involving the [[peripheral nervous system]], from which most patients recovery fully within a few months to a year. Some studies have indicated that influenza-like illness is itself associated with an increased risk of GBS, suggesting that vaccination might indirectly protect against the disorder by protecting against flu.<ref name=BBC20090928/> According to Marie-Paule Kieny of WHO assessing the side-effects of large-scale influenza vaccination is complicated by the fact that in any large population a few people will become ill and die at any time.<ref name="Kieny"/> For example in any six-week period in the UK six sudden deaths from unknown causes and 22 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome would be expected, so if everyone in the UK were vaccinated, this background rate of illness and death would continue as normal and some people would die simply by chance soon after the vaccination.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61877-8

A 2009 review of the use of influenza vaccines in pregnant women stated that influenza infections posed a major risk during pregnancy and that multiple studies had shown that the inactivated vaccine was safe in pregnant women, concluding that this vaccine "can be safely and effectively administered during any trimester of pregnancy" and that high levels of immunization would avert a "a significant number of deaths".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tamma PD, Ault KA, Del Rio C, Steinhoff MC, Halsey NA, Omer SB |title=Safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy |journal=Am.

===Children vaccine recall===
On 15 December 2009, One of the five manufacturers supplying the H1N1 vaccine to the United States recalled thousands of doses because they were not as potent as expected. The French manufacturer [[Sanofi Pasteur]] voluntarily recalled about 800,000 doses of vaccine meant for children between the ages of six months and 35 months. The company and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) emphasized that the recall was not prompted by safety concerns, and that even though the vaccine is not quite as potent as it is supposed to be, children who received it do not need to be immunized again. The CDC emphasized that there is no danger for any child who received the recalled vaccine. When asked what parents should do, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said, "absolutely nothing." He said if children receive this vaccine, they will be fine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/12/15/flu.vaccine.recall/index.html|title=800,000 H1N1 vaccine doses for young children recalled; safety not a concern|accessdate=16 September 2009|last=Falco |first=Mariam |date=15 December 2009 |publisher=CNN}}</ref><ref>

===Pandemrix-related increase of narcolepsy in Finland and Sweden===
{{Main article|Pandemrix}}
In 2010, [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|The Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA)]] and [[National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Finland|The Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL)]] received reports from Swedish and Finnish health care professionals regarding [[narcolepsy]] as suspected adverse drug reaction following [[Pandemrix]] flu vaccination. The reports concern children aged 12–16 years where symptoms compatible with [[narcolepsy]], diagnosed after thorough medical investigation, have occurred one to two months after vaccination.

THL concluded in February 2011 that there is a clear connection between the Pandemrix vaccination campaign of 2009 and 2010 and narcolepsy epidemic in Finland: there was a nine times higher probability to get narcolepsy with vaccination than without it.<ref>http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/2011/02/1265779/thl-pandemrixilla-ja-narkolepsialla-on-selva-yhteys</ref><ref>http://www.thl.fi/en_US/web/en/pressrelease?id=24103</ref>

At the end of March 2011, an MPA press release stated: "Results from a Swedish registry based cohort study indicate a 4-fold increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents below the age of 20 vaccinated with Pandemrix, compared to children of the same age that were not vaccinated."<ref>http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/english/All-news/NYHETER-2011/A-Swedish-registry-based-cohort-study-provides-strengthened-evidence-of-an-association-between-vaccination-with-Pandemrix-and-narcolepsy-in-children-and-adolescents-/</ref>
The same study found no increased risk in adults who were vaccinated with Pandemrix.

{{Quotation |
* Pregnant women, because they are at higher risk of complications and can potentially provide protection to infants who cannot be vaccinated;
* Household contacts and caregivers for children younger than 6 months of age, because younger infants are at higher risk of influenza-related complications and cannot be vaccinated. Vaccination of those in close contact with infants younger than 6 months old might help protect infants by "cocooning" them from the virus;
* Healthcare and emergency medical services personnel, because infections among healthcare workers have been reported and this can be a potential source of infection for vulnerable patients. Also, increased absenteeism in this population could reduce healthcare system capacity;
* All people from 6 months through 24 years of age:
** Children from 6 months through 18 years of age, because cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza have been seen in children who are in close contact with each other in school and day care settings, which increases the likelihood of disease spread, and
**Young adults 19 through 24 years of age, because many cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza have been seen in these healthy young adults and they often live, work, and study in close proximity, and they are a frequently mobile population; and,
* Persons aged 25 through 64 years who have health conditions associated with higher risk of medical complications from influenza.
*Once the demand for these groups has been met at a local level, everyone from the ages of 25 through 64 years should be vaccinated too.}}

This excludes the large majority of individuals aged six months to 24 years, a group for which the CDC recommends vaccination.

The NHS notes that:
* Healthy people over 65 years of age seem to have some natural immunity.
* Children, while disproportionately affected, tend to make full recoveries.
* The vaccine is ineffective in young infants.

The United Kingdom began its administration program 21 October 2009.

General political issues, not restricted to the 2009 outbreak, arose regarding the distribution of vaccine. In many countries supplies are controlled by national or local governments, and the question of how the vaccine will be allocated should there be an insufficient supply for everyone is critical, and will likely depend on the patterns of any pandemic, and the age groups most at risk for serious complications, including death. In the case of a lethal pandemic people will be demanding access to the vaccine and the major problem will be making it available to those who need it.<ref>{{cite pmid|14569657}}</ref>

While it has been suggested that [[compulsory vaccination]] may be needed to control a pandemic, many countries do not have a legal framework that would allow this. The only populations easily compelled to accept vaccination are military personnel (who can be given routine vaccinations as part of their service obligations), health care personnel (who can be required to be vaccinated to protect patients),{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and school children, who (under United States constitutional law) could be required to be vaccinated as a condition of attending school.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mariner, Wendy K, Annas, George J, Parmet, Wendy E | date = 2 May 2009 | title = Pandemic Preparedness: A Return to the Rule of Law | work = Drexel Law Review | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | month = Spring/Summer | pages = 341–82 | url = http://www.earlemacklaw.drexel.edu/law/lawreview/v1n2/mariner.pdf | ssrn = 1399066 | accessdate=5 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

In August 2010, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' printed an article that stated that "a third of the experts advising the World Health Organisation about the swine flu pandemic had ties to drugs firms" and that of the 20 members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which advised the British Government on swine flu, 11 had done work for the pharmaceutical industry or were linked to it through their universities. A spokesman for the WHO is stated as having "denied that the experts' work gave rise to a conflict of interest".<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu advisers' ties to drug firms: Five WHO experts linked with vaccine producers |author=Sophie Borland |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=13 August 2010 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1302505/WHO-swine-flu-advisers-ties-drug-firms-Experts-linked-vaccine-producers.html |location=London| accessdate=5 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>
