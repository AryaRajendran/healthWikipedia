'''Health care in [[Israel]]''' is [[Universal health care|universal]] and participation in a medical insurance plan is compulsory. Health care coverage is administered by a small number of organizations, with funding from the government. All [[Israel]]i citizens are entitled to the same Uniform Benefits Package, regardless of which organization they are a member of, and treatment under this package is government-funded for all citizens regardless of their financial means. Additional coverage for non-essential treatments can be arranged for a fee, which is generally shared between a citizen and their employer.
Generally, health care in Israel is of high-quality and is delivered in an efficient and effective manner. Partly as a result of this,{{pov-inline|date=May 2013}} at an overall 82 years, Israelis enjoy the [[List of countries by life expectancy|fourth-longest]] [[life expectancy]] in the world as of 2012.

==History==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 646 Health in Israel בית מרקחת .jpg|thumb|230px|Pharmacy in [[Petah Tikva]], 1930s]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4422 School of Nursing in.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hadassah]] nursing students, 1948]]
With the start of the [[British Mandate for Palestine]], measures were taken to improve public health in the area. In [[Jerusalem]], accumulated refuse heaps were removed, public rubbish bins were installed; the entire population was vaccinated against [[smallpox]], and pools and cisterns were covered with mosquito repellent as part of the campaign to eradicate [[malaria]]. <ref>[http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_12.html Life throughout the ages in a holy city]</ref>In 1929, the [[Zionist Commission]] and the British authorities sent the Jewish epidemiologist [[Gideon Mer]] to [[Rosh Pina]] to establish a laboratory for malaria research. Mer's laboratory was instrumental in eradicating the disease. <ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-88230633.html Galilee cornerstone, [[Jerusalem Post]]]</ref>The public health care system in Israel was built on the foundations of the system introduced at this time. 

Health insurance is administered by the [[Health maintenance organization]]s ({{lang-he-n|קופת חולים}}, {{transl|he|kupat holim}}, ''lit.'' sick fund, derived from the [[German language|German]] [[:de:Krankenkasse|Krankenkasse]]), most of which were set up by the [[Trade union|labour union]]s before the founding of the State. These Health Maintenance Organizations are membership-based. Originally, the members paid membership fees to these funds {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, and received in return a set guarantee of health services. 

In 1973 a special law was enacted which forced all employers in Israel to participate in the medical insurance of their workers, by means of a direct payment to the Health Maintenance Fund in which the workers were members. The duty of participation was eventually changed and diminished as part of the arrangements law (חוק הסדרים במשק המדינה) f 1991. 

In 1988 the government appointed a Commission of Inquiry to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the Israeli health care system. The commission handed in the final report in 1990. The main recommendation of this report was to enact a National Health Insurance law in Israel.

In the late 2000s, a future shortage of doctors and nurses became a concern, as the rate of doctors graduating from Israel's medical schools annually had dropped to 300, 200 less than needed, and many Soviet immigrant doctors and nurses began to retire. That number was estimated to eventually rise to 520 with the opening of a fifth medical school, but still below the 900 graduates that will be needed in 2022. This caused concerns of a shortage of medical personnel, which would imperil the quality and speed of medical care in the country. As a result, Israel begin offering incentives to Jewish doctors to immigrate from abroad and practice medicine in Israel. Initially, it only absorbed about 100 doctors from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] annually, but has now also absorbed immigrant doctors from [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. An investigative committee looking into the issue also called for incentives to be offered to Israeli medical students who had not been accepted in Israel and had gone to study medicine abroad to return to Israel, and for a program that involves 150 international students studying medicine in Israel to be shut down. In addition, the Israeli Health Ministry announced the launching of a new nursing assistants' profession, and increased nursing education programs in colleges.<ref>http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=180540</ref><ref>http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/israel-looks-cure-doctor-shortage</ref>

In 1995 the National Health Insurance Law  came into effect, which made membership in one of the four existing Health Maintenance Organizations compulsory for all Israeli citizens. The law determined a uniform benefits package (סל בריאות) for all citizens - a list of medical services and treatments which each of the Health Maintenance Organizations is required to fund for its members. Additionally, certain services were brought under the direct administration of the State, usually by means of the [[Health Minister of Israel|Health Ministry]]. In addition, the law set out a system of public funding for health care services by means of a progressive health tax, administered by ''[[Bituah Leumi]]'', Israel's social security organization, which transfers funding to the Health Maintenance Organizations according to a certain formula based on the number of members in each fund, the age distribution of members, and a number of other indices. The Health Maintenance Organizations also receive direct financing from the states money.

Before enactment the Health Insurance Law, the only Health Maintenance Organization to accept members without discrimination based on age or medical situation was the [[Clalit]] HMO which was then in the ownership of the [[Histadrut]] labour federation. After enactment of the 1995 law, membership in any of the four Health Maintenance Organizations was guaranteed for all citizens, and Israelis were given the right to transfer between Organizations once per year.

The 1995 law also imposed a system of financial and medical oversight of HMOs by the State. In addition to the uniform benefits package provided to all citizens, which provides coverage for basic and essential health care, every HMO fund provides their members with the option to acquire "supplementary insurance" (ביטוח משלים), which includes services and treatments that are not covered by the publicly funded system.

The four nationwide HMOs are: [[Clalit]] (the largest with about 54% of the population belonging to it), [[Maccabi Sherutei Briut|Maccabi]], [[Kupat Holim Meuhedet]] and [[Leumit Health Fund|Leumit]].

Israel has maintained a system of socialized health care since its establishment in 1948, although the National Health Insurance law was passed only on January 1, 1995. <ref>[http://www.physiciansnews.com/2009/10/01/can-universal-healthcare-work-a-look-at-israels-successful-model/ Can Universal Healthcare Work? A Look at Israel's Successful Model]</ref> The state is  responsible for providing health services to all residents of the country, who can register with one of the four health service funds. To be eligible, a citizen must pay a health insurance tax. Coverage includes medical diagnosis and treatment, preventive medicine, hospitalization (general, maternity, psychiatric and chronic), surgery and transplants, preventive dental care for children, first aid and transportation to a hospital or clinic, medical services at the workplace, treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism, medical equipment and appliances, obstetrics and fertility treatment, medication, treatment of chronic diseases and paramedical services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.<ref>{{cite web | title = history of Israel health care| url = http://www.israel.org/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Israel%20at%2050/The%20Health%20Care%20System%20in%20Israel-%20An%20Historical%20Pe}}</ref>

==Safety and quality==
Israel has one of the most technologically advanced and highest-quality healthcare systems in the world. Hospitals in Israel are equipped with modern facilities and high-quality medical technology. Medical staff are trained from four to six years in one of the country's five university medical schools, or are immigrants who have been trained abroad and accredited in Israel. The country is a world leader in advanced infrastructure of medical and paramedical research, and [[bioengineering]] capabilities. [[Biotechnology]], [[medical research|medical]], and [[clinical research]] account for over half of Israel's scientific publications, and the industrial sector uses this extensive knowledge to develop new pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and treatment therapies.<ref>http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts+About+Israel/Science+-+Technology/SCIENCE+AND+TECHNOLOGY-+Medical+R-amp-D.htm</ref>

Seven Israeli hospitals have received accreditation from the [[Joint Commission International]], an organization that sets safety standards for medical care: [[Soroka Medical Center]] in [[Beersheba]], [[HaEmek Medical Center]] in [[Afula]], [[Meir Hospital]] in [[Kfar Saba]], [[Rabin Medical Center]] in [[Petah Tikva]], [[Kaplan Medical Center]] in [[Rehovot]], Carmel Medical Center in [[Haifa]] and [[Assuta Medical Center]] in [[Tel Aviv]].<ref>[http://english.themarker.com/seven-hospitals-receive-prestigious-int-l-safety-accreditation-1.352000 Seven hospitals receive prestigious international safety accreditation]</ref>

==Health care providers==
[[Image:Mda motorcycle.JPG|thumb|150px|A [[first responder]] unit of [[Magen David Adom]] in Jerusalem's [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]]]
Providers in the Israeli [[healthcare systems|healthcare system]] consist of a mixture of private, semi-private and public entities. Generally, [[family medicine|family]] and [[General practitioner|primary]] medicine facilities are run directly by Clalit for its members while the other HMOs operate their own family practice clinics in the larger cities and contract with privately operated family practice clinics in smaller communities. As with primary practice, Clalit tends to provide specialty and outpatient care in their own clinics while the other HMOs generally contract with outside, private care physicians and facilities for this sort of service. In addition to these, the ministry of health in conjunction with various local authorities also runs a network of public well care and [[prenatal care|prenatal]] and infant care clinics throughout the country.

==Doctors==
In 2010, there were 25,542 doctors in Israel - 3.36 doctors for every 1,000 people. This ratio is one of the highest of all industrialized countries.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/health-ministry-warns-of-shortage-of-doctors-nurses-1.300230 Health Ministry warns of shortage of doctors, nurses ]</ref>

== Emergency services ==
[[Emergency medical services in Israel]] are provided by the [[Magen David Adom]] (MDA) organization, which staffs approximately 1,200 [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, and [[emergency physician]]s, and 10,000 volunteers. The organizations operates 95 stations and a fleet of over 700 ambulances. The majority of the fleet consists of [[Basic life support|Basic Life Support]] ambulances. There are also smaller numbers of [[Advanced life support|Advanced Life Support]] ambulances and [[Mobile Intensive Care Ambulance|Mobile Intensive Care Unit]]s. For [[air ambulance]] services, MDA relies primarily on [[Unit 669]] of the [[Israeli Air Force]]. There are also four [[MBB Bo 105]] utility helicopters staffed with MDA paramedics owned by Lahak Aviation operating as air ambulances throughout the country. Non-emergency and repatriation air ambulance services are normally provided by private charter carriers.
[[File:MDA Armoured Ambulance.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Magen David Adom]] armored mobile intensive care unit]]
Magen David Adom is supplemented in some areas by [[Hatzalah]], an emergency ambulance services network serving Jewish communities worldwide, and [[ZAKA]], a series of [[community emergency response team]]s staffed by Orthodox Jews, who in addition to providing medical services and evacuation, also aid in the identification of terrorism victims and gather spilled blood and body parts for burial. The [[Palestine Red Crescent Society]] also provides services to Arab neighborhoods in [[Jerusalem]]. It gained access to Jerusalem after signing a 2005 Memorandum of Understanding with Magen David Adom.

The ambulance system, for the most part, conforms to the Franco-German model of EMS care, and the presence of physicians at high-acuity emergencies is not uncommon. In addition, emergency ambulance services is bolstered by a variety of private carriers tasked with interfacility transfers only.

==Medical tourism==

Medical tourists choose Israel for several reasons. Some come from nations such as [[Romania]] and [[Cyprus]] where certain procedures are not available. Others come to Israel, perhaps most commonly from the US, because they can receive quality health care at a fraction of the cost it would be at home, for both surgeries and [[in-vitro fertilization]] procedures. 

Other medical tourists come to Israel to visit the [[Dead Sea]], a world-famous therapeutic resort.<ref name="Haaretz"/> The Israel Ministry of Tourism and several professional medical services providers have set out to generate awareness of Israel's medical capabilities.<ref>[http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Euk/Tourist+Information/Discover+Israel/Medical+Tourism.htm Medical Tourism Israel]</ref>

===Palestinian medical tourism===

A significant number of residents of the [[Palestinian territories]] seek medical treatment in Israel, often for sophisticated tests or treatments not available at Palestinian hospitals. Their treatment is paid for under a financial arrangement with the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]], or in some cases, at their own expense. Medical treatment for [[Gaza Strip]] residents is paid for by the Palestinian Authority or organizations such as the [[Peres Center for Peace]].<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Health/Article.aspx?id=292503 Israel’s hospitals continue to treat Gazan patients, [[Jerusalem Post]]]</ref>

Palestinians who apply for medical treatment in Israel must obtain a humanitarian entry permit from Israel, of which thousands are issued annually. In January 2009, following the [[Gaza War]], the Palestinian Authority canceled financial coverage for all medical care for Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, including coverage for the chronically ill and those in need of complex care not available in the Palestinian territories.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/world/middleeast/10patients.html Palestinians Stop Paying Israeli Hospitals for Gaza and West Bank Patients ]</ref><ref>[http://reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/CJAL-7PYM36?OpenDocument ReliefWeb, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel and human rights organizations in a joint position paper on the decision to stop covering Palestinians' medical care]</ref> In 2012, The Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Health reported spending approximately $42 million in 2011 to finance medical coverage of Palestinians in Israeli hospitals and the Arab World. <ref>http://www.canada.com/health/Wrangling+between+rival+Palestinian+governments+leaves+Gaza+medical/6971890/story.html</ref> [[Arab citizens of Israel]] belong to the same health care system as that of all other citizens of the country.

The quality of medical care in Israel is significantly better than anywhere in the West Bank and Gaza. Irwin Mansdorf, a member of ''Task Force on Medical and Public Health Issues, Scholars for Peace in the Middle East'' wrote about routine care that Palestinians continue to receive in Israeli hospitals and from Israeli physicians.<ref>[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/329/7474/1102-a?ck=nck BMJ journal] Derek Summerfield article in reply to Simon Fellerman</ref>

''Saving Children'', established by the Peres Peace Center, enables hundreds of Palestinian children to receive free medical care, in particular cardiac surgery, from Israeli surgeons.<ref>[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/329/7474/1110?ck=nck BMJ journal] Simon Fellerman in reply to BMJ article by [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/329/7471/924?ijkey=a8226af1022ebb0cadde58e68d909f684dd5c9b3&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha Derek Summerfield]</ref>

"Save A Child's Heart" is a program in which any child with heart problems can receive free medical attention and surgery from select doctors and hospitals within Israel. From 1996 to 2007, 4,591 children had been examined world wide, of the 1848 children treated 828 (45%) were Palestinian.<ref>[http://www.saveachildsheart.com/success_rate/success.html Save a Child's Heart.com] Success rates</ref>

==Hospitals and medical centers==
{{main|List of hospitals in Israel}}
There are around 60 hospitals and medical centers in Israel.<ref>http://wiki.ifmsa.org/scope/index.php?title=Israel#Our_medical_education</ref> In addition to general hospitals, there are a number of specialized hospitals throughout the country. Most of the hospitals are government-owned and operated by the Ministry of Health, although some are fully private. Most of the private hospitals in Israel belong to [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] or [[charitable organization|charitable]] organizations. Many of the private hospitals are run by [[Clalit Health Services]].

==Medical research==
Israel is one of the world leaders in [[stem cell]] research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/stem-cell-tourism-prepares-for-take-off.premium-1.490387 Stem cell tourism prepares for take-off, [[Haaretz]]]</ref>
