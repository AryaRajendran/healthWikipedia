'''Ty21a''' is a live [[attenuated]] bacterial vaccine that protects against [[typhoid]]. It is one of two typhoid vaccines currently recommended by the [[World Health Organization]].<ref name="WHO2007">{{cite journal|author=World Health Organization|year=2008|journal=Weekly Epidemiological Record|volume=83|issue=6|pages=49–60|title=Typhoid vaccines: WHO position paper|url=http://www.who.int/wer|pmid=18260212}}</ref> The vaccine offers a statistically significant protection for the first three years, with between 8% to 54% effectiveness for the first year and between 40% to 71% for the second year.<ref name="pmid17636661">{{cite journal |author=Fraser A, Goldberg E, Acosta CJ, Paul M, Leibovici L |title=Vaccines for preventing typhoid fever |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=3 |pages=CD001261 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001261.pub2 |pmid=17636661 |editor1-last=Fraser |editor1-first=Abigail}}</ref> The vaccine is most commonly used to protect travellers to endemic countries, but there is no reason why the vaccine could not be used in large scale public prevention programmes.<ref name="WHO2007"/>

The vaccine is given by mouth.  The vaccine is presented either as capsules or a liquid suspension.  The vaccine must be stored at 2 to 8 °C, but will retain its potency for 14 days at 25°C.<ref name="WHO2007"/>

==Dosing==
The recommended dose varies according to country.

In the US and Canada, an initial course of 4 doses on alternate days is recommended. Full protection is achieved 7 days after the last dose. In the US, a booster dose is recommended after 5 years.  In Canada, a booster dose is recommended after 7 years.

In Australia and Europe, an initial course of 3 doses on alternate days is recommended.  Protection is achieved 7 days after the last dose.  A booster is recommended every 3 years for people living in endemic areas, but every year for people travelling from non-endemic to endemic areas.<ref name="GreenBook">{{cite book
