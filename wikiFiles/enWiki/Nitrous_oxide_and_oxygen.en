A mix of '''[[nitrous oxide]] 50% and [[oxygen]] 50%''' is a medical [[anaesthetic|anaesthesia]] gas, commonly known as '''Entonox''' (a registered trademark of [[British Oxygen Company|BOC]]) or '''Nitronox''',<ref name=jrcalc>{{cite book|publisher=Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee|title=UK Ambulance Service Clinical Practice Guidelines|year=2006|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/hsri/emergencycare/prehospitalcare/jrcalcstakeholderwebsite/guidelines/clinical_guidelines_2006.pdf|coauthors=Fisher, J;Brown, S;Cooke, M|ISBN=1-84690-060-3}}</ref> or colloquially as ''''gas and air'''',<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Baby Centre|title=Entonox (gas and air)|url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/labourandbirth/painrelief/entonox/}}</ref> and is frequently used in pre-hospital care, [[childbirth]] and [[emergency medicine]] situations by medical professionals such as [[physician|doctors]], [[nurse]]s, [[midwife|midwives]] and [[paramedic]]s.<ref name=frca/>

==History==
Nitrous oxide as a single gas was first used as a medical analgesic in 1844 by American dentist Horace Wells, growing in popularity in the late 1800s.<ref name="Discovery of Wells">{{cite web |url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/picrender.cgi?artid=1703729&blobtype=pdf|author=Erving HW|title=The Discoverer of Anæsthesia: Dr. Horace Wells of Hartford|work=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, May 1933; v.5, n.5, p.421–430|year=1933}}</ref><ref name=boc>{{cite web|publisher=BOC Gases|title=History of Entonox|url=http://www.entonox.co.uk/en/discover_enotonox/story_and_heritage/index.shtml}}</ref>  Negative side effects were found from the hypoxia caused by a lack of oxygen, and the requirement to have at least 21% oxygen content in the gas was discovered (the same percentage as in air).<ref name=boc/>

In 1911, the anaesthetist [[Arthur Ernest Guedel]] first described the use of self-administration of a nitrous oxide and oxygen mix.  

It was not until 1961 that the first paper was published by Michael Tunstall et al. describing the administration of a pre-mixed 50:50 nitrous oxide and oxygen mix, which led to the commercialisation of the product.<ref name=boc/>

==Composition==

The gas is made of a mixture of fifty percent [[nitrous oxide]] (''N<sub>2</sub>O'' or ''laughing gas'') and fifty percent [[oxygen]] (''O<sub>2</sub>'').<ref name=jrcalc/><ref name=frca/>  The ability to combine nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide is the common name; dinitrogen monoxide, systematic name) and oxygen at high pressure while remaining in the gaseous form is caused by the [[Poynting effect]] (after [[John Henry Poynting]], an English physicist).<ref name=frca/>

The Poynting effect involves the dissolution of gaseous O<sub>2</sub> when bubbled through liquid N<sub>2</sub>O, with vaporisation of the liquid to form a gaseous O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O mixture.<ref name=frca/>

Inhalation of pure nitrous oxide over a continued period would render a human [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]],<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Nitrous Oxide Supplies|title=Breathing Nitrous Oxide|url=http://www.nitrousoxidesupplies.co.uk/automotive/breathing.phtml}}</ref> and the 50% oxygen content prevents this from occurring.  The two gases will separate at low temperatures (<4 [[Celsius|°C]]), which would permit administration of hypoxic mixtures. Therefore, it is not given from a cold cylinder without being shaken (usually by cylinder inversion) to remix the gases.

==Administration==
The gas is self administered through a [[demand valve]], using a mouthpiece, bite block or face mask.<ref name=jrcalc/>  Self-administration of Entonox remains safe because if enough is inhaled to start to induce anaesthesia, the patient becomes unable to hold the valve, and so will drop it and soon exhale the residual gas.  This means, that unlike with other anesthetic gases, it does not require the presence of an [[anesthesiologist|anaesthetist]] for administration.  The 50% oxygen in Entonox ensures the patient will have sufficient oxygen in their system for a short period of [[apnoea]] to be safe.

==Action on the patient==
Nitrous oxide is itself active (does not require any changes in the body to become active), and so has an onset in roughly the [[lung]]&ndash;[[brain]] circulation time. This gives it a peak action 30 seconds after the start of administration;<ref name=frca/> Entonox should thus be used accordingly, e.g. use should begin 30 seconds before a contraction becomes painful in labour. It is removed from the body unchanged via the lungs, and does not accumulate under normal conditions, explaining the rapid offset of around 60 seconds.<ref name=frca/>

Nitrous oxide is more soluble than oxygen and nitrogen, so will tend to diffuse into any air spaces within the body. This makes it dangerous to use in patients with [[pneumothorax]] or who have recently been [[scuba diving]], and there are cautions over its use with any bowel obstruction.

Its analgesic effect is strong (equivalent to 15&nbsp;mg of [[subcutaneous]] route [[morphine]]<ref name=frca>{{cite web|title=Entonox|publisher=Anaesthesia UK|url=http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=100364|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref>) and characterised by rapid onset and offset (i.e. it is very fast-acting and wears off very quickly).

==Contraindications and cautions==
Nitrous oxide should not be used in patients with bowel obstruction, pneumothorax, middle ear or sinus disease,<ref name=frca/> and should also not be used on any patient who has been [[scuba diving]] within the preceding 24 hours<ref name=SPUMS1998>{{cite journal |author=Komesaroff, D |title=Oxygen administration in diving accidents. |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal]] |year=1998 |volume=28 |issue=3 Supplement |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5974 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref> or in violently disturbed psychiatric patients.<ref name=jrcalc/>  There are also clinical cautions in place for the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy and in patients with decreased levels of consciousness.<ref name=frca/>
