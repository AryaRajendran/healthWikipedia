'''Kussmaul breathing''' is a deep and [[labored breathing]] pattern often associated with severe metabolic [[acidosis]], particularly [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA) but also renal failure. It is a form of [[hyperventilation]], which is any breathing pattern that reduces carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased rate or depth of respiration. 

In [[metabolic acidosis]], breathing is first rapid and shallow<ref>{{EMedicine|article|768268|Metabolic Acidosis}}
</ref> but as acidosis worsens, breathing gradually becomes deep, labored and gasping. It is this latter type of breathing pattern that is referred to as Kussmaul breathing.

==Terminology==
[[Adolph Kussmaul]], who introduced the term, referred to breathing when metabolic acidosis was sufficiently severe for the respiratory rate to be normal or reduced.<ref name='wni'>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|570|Kussmaul's respiration}}</ref> This definition is also followed by several other sources,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O62-Kussmaulbreathing.html |title=Kussmaul breathing |publisher=encyclopedia.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref><ref name='tfd'>{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/breathing,+Kussmaul |title=Kussmaul breathing |publisher=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref> including for instance Merriam-Webster, which defines Kussmaul breathing as "abnormally slow deep respiration characteristic of air hunger and occurring especially in acidotic states".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medical.merriam-webster.com/medical/kussmaul |title=Kussmaul breathing |work=Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary |accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref>  Other sources, however, use the term Kussmaul respiration also when acidosis is less severe, in which case breathing is rapid.<ref name='tfd'/><ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000956511|Kussmaul respiration}}</ref>

Note that Kussmaul breathing occurs only in advanced stages of acidosis, and is fairly rarely reached. In less severe cases of acidosis, rapid, shallow breathing is seen. Kussmaul breathing is a kind of very deep, gasping, desperate breathing. Occasionally, medical literature refers to any abnormal breathing pattern in acidosis as Kussmaul breathing; however, this is inaccurate.

==History==
Kussmaul breathing is named for [[Adolph Kussmaul]],<ref name='wni'/> the 19th century [[German people|German]] [[Physician|doctor]] who first noted it among patients with advanced [[diabetes mellitus]]. [[Kussmaul's sign]] is also an eponymous finding attributable to Kussmaul, and should be distinguished from Kussmaul breathing.

He published his finding in a classic 1874 paper.<ref>A. Kussmaul: ''Zur Lehre vom Diabetes mellitus. Über eine eigenthümliche Todesart bei Diabetischen, über Acetonämie, Glycerin-Behandlung des Diabetes und Einspritzungen von Diastase in’s Blut bei dieser Krankheit.'', ''Deutsches Archiv für klinische Medicin, Leipzig'', 1874, 14: 1-46. English translation in Ralph Hermon Major (1884-1970), Classic Descriptions of Disease. Springfield, C. C. Thomas, 1932. 2nd edition, 1939, 3rd edition, 1945.</ref>

==Mechanism==
Kussmaul breathing is [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] compensation for a [[metabolic acidosis]], most commonly occurring in [[diabetic]]s in [[diabetic ketoacidosis]]. Blood gases on a patient with Kussmaul breathing will show a low partial pressure of [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] in conjunction with low [[bicarbonate]] because of a forced increased [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] (blowing off the [[carbon dioxide]]). Base excess is severely negative. The patient feels an [[urge to breathe]] deeply, an "air hunger", and it appears almost involuntary.

A metabolic acidosis soon produces hyperventilation, but at first it will tend to be rapid and relatively shallow. Kussmaul breathing develops as the acidosis grows more severe. Indeed, Kussmaul originally identified this type of breathing as a sign of coma and imminent death in diabetic patients.

Duration of fasting, presence or absence of [[hepatomegaly]] and Kussmaul breathing provide clues to the [[differential diagnosis]] of [[hyperglycemia]] in the inborn errors of metabolism.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robin R Deterding; Hay, William Winn; Myron J.
