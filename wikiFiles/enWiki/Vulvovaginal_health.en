'''Vulvovaginal health''' is the health and sanitation of the [[human]] [[female]] [[vulva]] and [[vagina]].

==Conditions==
Problems affecting this area include:  
*Infection with ''[[Candida albicans]]'' ([[candidiasis]] or "yeast infection")
*[[Bacterial vaginosis]] (BV) associated with the ''[[Gardnerella]]'', formerly called "nonspecific [[vaginitis]]"
*[[Trichomoniasis]]
*[[Vulvodynia]]
*[[Vestibulodynia]]
*[[Urinary bladder]] [[infection]], [[urinary tract infection]] (UTI), cystitis, [[Urethritis]]
*Various types of [[prolapse]] (where another pelvic organ protrudes into the vagina)
*[[Lichen Sclerosis]] (auto-immune disorder)
*[[Cervical cancer]] (may be prevented by [[Pap smear]] screening and [[HPV vaccine]]s)
*[[Genital warts]] (may be prevented by [[HPV vaccine]]s)
*[[Vulvar cancer]]

===Vulvo-Perineal Localization of Dermatologic Disorders===
Systemic disorders may be localized in the vulvo-perineal region.<ref name=AMN1>{{cite journal | author = Dominique Hamel-Teillac  sara catanzaro| title = Vulvo-Perineal Localization of Dermatologic Disorders, 2005. | url = http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/vulvo-perineal-localization-of-dermatologic-disorders/| journal =Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology - Vulvo-Vaginal Disorders | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2005}}</ref>

* In [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]], lesions initially are [[erythema]]tous, [[Purpura|purpuric]] [[papule]]s and they then become scaly, crusted and sometimes confluent.
* In [[Kawasaki disease]], an erythematous, [[Squamous epithelium|desquamating]] perineal rash may occur in the second week of symptom onset, almost at the same time as palmoplantar desquamation.
* [[Acrodermatitis enteropathica]] is a biochemical disorder of zinc metabolism.

===Infectious diseases===

* [[Vaginitis]]
* [[Perineum|Perineal]] [[dermatitis]]
* [[Virus|Viral]] infections
* Infestations with [[pinworm]]s (rare), [[scabies]] and [[Louse|lice]].<ref name=AMN3>{{cite journal | author = Dominique Hamel-Teillac  | title = Infectious Diseases (Except Sexually Transmitted Diseases) |url=http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/infectious-diseases-except-sexually-transmitted-diseases/  | journal =Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology - Vulvo-Vaginal Disorders | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2005}}</ref>

===Obstruction===
A vaginal obstruction is often caused by an [[imperforate hymen]] or, less commonly, a [[transverse vaginal septum]]. A sign of vaginal obstruction is [[hydrocolpos]], that is, accumulation of watery fluid within the vagina. It may extend to become ''hydrometrocolpos'', that is, accumulation of watery fluid within the vagina as well as within the [[uterus]].<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hydrometrocolpos Farlex dictionary > hydrometrocolpos], citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers.

==Causes==
The vulva and vagina have a "normal [[vaginal flora|flora]]" of "friendly" microorganisms which help to keep the area healthy. When the normal balance is disturbed, an infection can result.

==Symptoms==
The generic term for infection of the vagina is ''[[vaginitis]]''. Symptoms may include an unusual or unpleasant discharge, itching, or pain during [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]]. But vaginal infections may also be present without any noticeable symptoms.

==Maintaining health==

The following measures are advisable for keeping the [[vulva]] and [[vagina]] healthy:

* Washing once a day or so with [[water]] but without [[soap]], since soap disturbs the natural [[pH]] balance of the vagina. Some, so called ''[[pH balanced]]'' soaps exist, but their effects remain unclear. Other measures are seldom necessary or advisable. Two notable examples: so-called "feminine hygiene sprays" are unnecessary, may be generally harmful, and have been known to cause severe [[allergy|allergic]] reactions. Vaginal [[douche|douching]] is generally not necessary and has been implicated in helping to cause [[bacterial vaginosis]] (BV) and [[candidiasis]] ("yeast infections").
* After using the [[toilet]], wipe from the front toward the back to avoid introducing [[bacteria]] from the [[anus|anal]] area into the [[vulva]]. Use non-perfumed, undyed toilet paper.
* Drink plenty of water and urinate frequently and as soon as possible when you feel the need, to help flush bacteria out of the urinary tract and avoid [[urinary tract infection]]s. For the same reason, try to urinate before and after [[Human sexual activity|sex]].
* Change out of a wet [[swimsuit]] or other wet clothes as soon as possible.
* Avoid fragrances, colours, and "deodorants" in products that contact the vulva/vagina: [[sanitary napkin]]s, [[tampon]]s, and [[toilet paper]]. Some women who are sensitive to these substances should also avoid bubble baths and some fabric detergents and softeners.
* Use a [[menstrual cup]] instead of [[sanitary pad]]s or [[tampons]]. Menstrual cups are a new form of menstrual product that has recently been rapidly gaining in popularity as a greener, more cost-effective and healthier alternative to tampons and sanitary pads.
* Avoid wearing [[leather]] trousers, tight [[jeans]], [[panties]] made of [[nylon]] or other synthetic fabrics, or [[pantyhose]] without an all-[[cotton]] [[crotch]] (not cotton covered by nylon - cut out the nylon panel if necessary).
* Anything which has been in contact with the anal area (see [[anal sex]]) should be thoroughly washed with soap and water or a similar disinfectant before coming in contact with the vulva or vagina.
* Use [[condoms]] during heterosexual intercourse, practise [[safer sex]], know your sex partners, ask sex partners to practise basic hygiene of their genitals. Use artificial lubrication during the intercourse if the amount naturally produced is not enough.
* Be careful with objects inserted inside the vagina. Improper insertion of objects into any body opening can cause damage: infection, cutting, piercing, trauma, blood loss, etc.
* Avoid letting any contaminants inside the vagina, including dirt but especially sand.

Women who are [[disability|unable to walk]] are more likely to have infections. The problem can be prevented according to above-mentioned and following measures:
* Wash crotch and rectal areas (with a soap-substitute if desired) and large amount of warm running water, every morning and evening. The disabled person can sit on a shower chair with an open seat or on a toilet. Use a [[shower head]] or water container to wash more directly.
* Use towel to dry.
* DO NOT use talcum/body powder, if desired use corn starch powder (corn-flour) on the skin of the genital area to absorb perspiration.
* Avoid sitting on plastic or synthetic materials for extended lengths of time.
* Wear loose underpants and change if soilage or wetness occurs.
