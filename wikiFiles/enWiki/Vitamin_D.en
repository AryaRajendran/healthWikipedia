'''Vitamin D''' is a group of fat-soluble [[secosteroids]] responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.

Although vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin, it is not actually an [[vitamin|essential dietary vitamin]] in the strict sense, as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight. (Cats and dogs cannot synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in their diet.) An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is only scientifically called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from their diet. However, as with other compounds commonly called vitamins, vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease, namely, [[rickets]], the childhood form of [[osteomalacia]].<ref name="Wolf_2004">{{cite journal | author = Wolf G | title = The discovery of vitamin D: the contribution of Adolf Windaus | journal = J Nutr | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 1299–302 | year = 2004 | month = June | pmid = 15173387 }}</ref>  Additionally, like other compounds called vitamins, in the [[developed world]] vitamin D is added to staple foods, such as milk, to avoid disease due to deficiency.

Measures of [[blood serum|serum]] levels reflect [[Endogeny|endogenous]] synthesis from exposure to [[sunlight]] as well as intake from the diet, and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrations. The evidence indicates that the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure works in a feedback loop that prevents toxicity but, because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the [[Institute of Medicine]], USA, for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirements. Accordingly, the [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s for vitamin D assume that no synthesis occurs and that all of a person's vitamin D is from their diet, although that will rarely occur in practice.

In the liver vitamin D is converted to [[calcidiol]], which is also known as calcifediol (INN), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D—abbreviated 25(OH)D; and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is [[Vitamin D3 blood test|measured]] in serum to determine a person's vitamin D status.<ref name="url25-hydroxy vitamin D test: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia">{{cite web | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003569.htm | title = 25-hydroxy vitamin D test | work = MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine }}</ref><ref name="Hollis_1996">{{cite journal | author = Hollis BW | title = Assessment of vitamin D nutritional and hormonal status: what to measure and how to do it | journal = Calcif.

University of California Riverside</ref> The structural difference between vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is in their [[side chain]]s. The side chain of D<sub>2</sub> contains a [[double bond]] between carbons 22 and 23, and a [[methyl group]] on carbon 24.

Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) is produced by [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet irradiation]] (UV) of its precursor [[7-dehydrocholesterol]]. Our skin makes vitamin D3 and supplies about 90 percent of our vitamin D.<ref name="Holick_2006"/> This molecule occurs naturally in the skin of animals and in milk. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> can be made by exposure of the skin to UV, or by exposing milk directly to UV (one commercial method). Vitamin D3 is also found in oily fish and cod liver oil.<ref name="Holick_2006"/><ref name="Norman_2008"/><ref name="Holick_2007"/>

Vitamin D<sub>2</sub> is a derivative of [[ergosterol]], a membrane [[sterol]] named for the [[ergot]] fungus, which is produced by some kinds of [[phytoplankton]], [[invertebrate]]s, [[yeast]]s, and higher [[fungi]] such as mushrooms. The vitamin [[ergocalciferol]] (D<sub>2</sub>) is produced in all of these organisms from ergosterol, in response to UV irradiation. Like all forms of vitamin D, it cannot be produced without UV irradiation. D<sub>2</sub> is not produced by green land plants or [[vertebrate]]s, because they lack the [[chemical precursor|precursor]] ergosterol.<ref>http://www.aspergillus.org.uk/pdfs/18191972.pdf</ref> The biological fate for producing 25(OH)D from vitamin D<sub>2</sub> is expected to be the same as for 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>,<ref name=holick2011>{{cite journal | author = Holick MF, Binkley NC, Bischoff-Ferrari HA, Gordon CM, Hanley DA, Heaney RP, Murad MH, Weaver CM | title = Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 96 | issue = 7 | pages = 1911–30 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21646368 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2011-0385 }}</ref> although some controversy exists over whether or not D<sub>2</sub> can fully substitute for vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in the human diet.<ref name="pmid17023693">{{cite journal | author = Houghton LA, Vieth R | title = The case against ergocalciferol (vitamin D<sub>2</sub>) as a vitamin supplement | journal = [[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 694–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 17023693 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/84/4/694.full.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

===Photosynthesis of vitamin D in primitive species.===
Photosynthesis of vitamin D in the ocean by phytoplankton (such as [[coccolithophore]] and ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'') has existed for more than 500 million years and continues to the present.  Although primitive vertebrates in the ocean could absorb calcium from the ocean into their skeletons and eat plankton rich in vitamin D, land animals required another way to satisfy their vitamin D requirement for a calcified skeleton without relying on plants.  Land vertebrates have been making their own vitamin D for more than 350 million years.<ref name="isbn0-452-29688-9">{{cite book | author = Holick MF | title = The Vitamin D Solution: A 3-Step Strategy to Cure Our Most Common Health Problems | publisher = Plume | location = New York | year = 2011 | pages = | isbn = 0-452-29688-9 | page = 27 }}</ref>

Vitamin D can be synthesized only via a photochemical process, so land vertebrates had to ingest foods that contained vitamin D or had to be exposed to sunlight to photosynthesize vitamin D in their skin to satisfy their body's vitamin D requirement.<ref name="Holick_2004">{{cite journal | author = Holick MF | title = Vitamin D: importance in the prevention of cancers, type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis | journal = [[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 362–71 | year = 2004 | month = March | pmid = 14985208 }}</ref>

===Production in the skin===
[[File:Skinlayers.png|thumb|In the epidermal strata of the skin, production is greatest in the stratum basale (colored red in the illustration) and stratum spinosum (colored light brown).]]

Vitamin D<sub>3</sub form> (cholecalciferol) is produced photochemically in the [[skin]] from [[7-dehydrocholesterol]]. 7-Dehydrocholesterol is produced in relatively large quantities, 10,000 to 20,000 IU of vitamin D are produced in 30 minutes of whole-body exposure, in the skin of most vertebrate animals, including humans.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Crissey SD, Ange KD, Jacobsen KL, Slifka KA, Bowen PE, Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis M, Langman CB, Sadler W, Kahn S | title = Serum concentrations of lipids, vitamin D metabolites, retinol, retinyl esters, tocopherols and selected carotenoids in twelve captive wild felid species at four zoos | journal = The Journal of nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 160–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12514284 }}</ref> [[7-dehydrocholesterol]] reacts with [[ultraviolet light]] of [[Ultraviolet light#Subtypes|UVB]] type at [[wavelengths]] between 270 and 300&nbsp;nm, with peak synthesis occurring between 295 and 297&nbsp;nm.<ref name="Hume Lucas Smith 1927 362-367">{{cite journal | author = Hume EM, Lucas NS, Smith HH | title = On the Absorption of vitamin D from the Skin | journal = Biochemical Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 362–367 | year = 1927 | pmid = 16743844 | pmc = 1251921 }}</ref> These wavelengths are present in sunlight when the [[UV index]] is greater than three, as well as in the light emitted by the UV lamps in [[tanning bed]]s (which produce ultraviolet primarily in the [[Ultraviolet light#Subtypes|UVA]] spectrum, but typically produce 4% to 10% of the total UV emissions as UVB). At a UV index greater than three, which occurs daily within the [[tropics]], daily during the spring and summer seasons in [[temperate region]]s, and almost never within the [[arctic circle]]s, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> can be made in the skin. Even if the UV index is high enough, exposure to light through windows is insufficient because UV light cannot pass through windows.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/17/science/17qna.html |title=  Sunshine Vitamin D |author= C.

Depending on the intensity of UVB rays and the minutes of exposure, an equilibrium can develop in the skin, and vitamin D degrades as fast as it is generated.<ref name="Holick_1995">{{cite journal | author = Holick MF | title = Environmental factors that influence the cutaneous production of vitamin D | journal = [[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 638S–645S | year = 1995 | month = March | pmid = 7879731 | format = PDF | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/61/3/638S.full.pdf }}</ref>

The skin consists of two primary layers: the inner layer called the [[dermis]], composed largely of [[connective tissue]], and the outer, thinner [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. Thick epidermis in the soles and palms consists of five ''strata''; from outer to inner they are: the [[stratum corneum]], [[stratum lucidum]], [[stratum granulosum]], [[stratum spinosum]], and [[stratum basale]]. Vitamin D is produced in the two innermost strata, the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.

The [[naked mole rat]] appears to be naturally cholecalciferol deficient, as serum 25-OH vitamin D levels are undetectable.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yahav S, Buffenstein R | title = Cholecalciferol supplementation alters gut function and improves digestibility in an underground inhabitant, the naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), when fed on a carrot diet | journal = The British journal of nutrition | volume = 69 | issue = 1 | pages = 233–41 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8384476 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19930025 }}</ref>
In some animals, the presence of fur or feathers blocks the UV rays from reaching the skin. In birds and fur-bearing mammals, vitamin D is generated from the oily secretions of the skin deposited onto the feathers or fur and is obtained orally during grooming.<ref>{{cite book  | author = Stout SD, Agarwal SC | title = Bone loss and osteoporosis: an anthropological perspective | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-306-47767-X }}</ref>

====Sunscreen====
[[Sunscreen]] absorbs ultraviolet light and prevents it from reaching the skin. It has been reported that sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 8 based on the UVB spectrum can decrease vitamin D synthetic capacity by 95 percent, whereas sunscreen with an SPF of 15 can reduce synthetic capacity by 98 percent (Matsuoka et al., 1987).<ref>{{cite book |author=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D and Calcium |chapter=8, Implications and Special Concerns |chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56078/ |editor=Ross AC, Taylor CL, Yaktine AL, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington DC |year=2011 |isbn=0-309-16394-3 |pmid=21796828 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56070/}}</ref>

Vitamin D is carried in the bloodstream to the liver, where it is converted into the [[prohormone]] [[calcidiol]]. Circulating calcidiol may then be converted into [[calcitriol]], the biologically active form of vitamin D, either in the kidneys or by [[monocyte]]-[[macrophages]] in the [[immune system]]. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages, calcitriol acts locally as a [[cytokine]], defending the body against microbial invaders.<ref name="Adams&Hewison2010">{{cite journal | author = Adams JS, Hewison M | title = Update in Vitamin D | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism | volume = 95 | issue = 2 | pages = 471–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20133466 | pmc = 2840860 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2009-1773 }}</ref>
Following the final converting step in the kidney, calcitriol (the physiologically active form of vitamin D) is released into the circulation. By binding to [[vitamin D-binding protein]] (VDBP), a carrier protein in the [[blood plasma|plasma]], calcitriol is transported to various target organs.<ref name="River" />

Calcitriol mediates its biological effects by binding to the [[vitamin D receptor]] (VDR), which is principally located in the [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] of target cells.<ref name="River" /> The binding of calcitriol to the VDR allows the VDR to act as a [[transcription factor]] that modulates the [[gene expression]] of transport proteins (such as [[TRPV6]] and [[calbindin]]), which are involved in calcium absorption in the intestine.<ref name=Bouillon2003>{{cite journal | author = Bouillon R, Van Cromphaut S, Carmeliet G | title = Intestinal calcium absorption: Molecular vitamin D mediated mechanisms | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 332–9 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12520535 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.10360 }}</ref>

The vitamin D receptor belongs to the [[nuclear receptor]] superfamily of [[steroid hormone receptor|steroid/thyroid hormone receptors]], and VDRs are expressed by cells in most [[organ (biology)|organs]], including the [[brain]], [[heart]], skin, [[gonads]], [[prostate]], and [[breast]]. VDR activation in the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland cells leads to the maintenance of [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]] levels in the [[blood]] (with the assistance of parathyroid hormone and [[calcitonin]]) and to the maintenance of [[bone]] content.<ref name="Sun">{{cite journal | author = Holick MF | title = Sunlight and vitamin D for bone health and prevention of autoimmune diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular disease | journal = [[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume = 80 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 1678S–88S | year = 2004 | pmid = 15585788 | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/80/6/1678S.long }}</ref>

The VDR is known to be involved in [[cell proliferation]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Vitamin D also affects the immune system, and VDRs are expressed in several [[white blood cell]]s, including monocytes and activated [[T cell|T]] and [[B cell]]s.<ref name="PDR">[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/vit_0265.shtml Vitamin D]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} The Physicians Desk Reference. 2006 Thompson Healthcare.</ref>

Apart from VDR activation, various alternative mechanisms of action are known. An important one of these is its role as a natural inhibitor of signal transduction by [[hedgehog signaling pathway|hedgehog]] (a hormone involved in morphogenesis).<ref name=Sarkar2010>{{cite journal | author = Sarkar FH, Li Y, Wang Z, Kong D | title = The role of nutraceuticals in the regulation of Wnt and Hedgehog signaling in cancer | journal = Cancer Metastasis Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 383–64 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20711635 | pmc = 2974632 | doi = 10.1007/s10555-010-9233-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/713649_3 |title=Hedgehog signaling and Vitamin D |publisher=Medscape.com |date=2009-12-18|accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref>

One of the most important roles of vitamin D is to maintain skeletal calcium balance by promoting [[Calcium metabolism|calcium absorption]] in the intestines, promoting [[bone resorption]] by increasing [[osteoclast]] number, maintaining calcium and [[phosphate]] levels for [[bone formation]], and allowing proper functioning of [[parathyroid hormone]] to maintain serum calcium levels. [[Vitamin D deficiency]] can result in lower [[bone mineral density]] and an increased risk of reduced bone density ([[osteoporosis]]) or [[Fracture (bone)|bone fracture]] because a lack of vitamin D alters mineral metabolism in the body.<ref name=BellTD>{{cite journal | author = Bell TD, Demay MB, Burnett-Bowie SAM | title = The biology and pathology of vitamin D control in bone | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 111 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–13 | year = 2010 | month = April | pmid = 20506379 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.22661 }}</ref>  Thus, although it may initially appear paradoxical, vitamin D is critical for proper bone formation despite its role as a potent stimulator of bone resorption.<ref>American Academy of Periodontology 2010 In-Service Exam, question A-27</ref>

=====Comment=====
The [[Dietary Reference Intake]] for vitamin D issued by the [[Institute of Medicine|American (U.S.) Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) in 2010 superseded a previous recommendation which had Adequate Intake status. The recommendations were formed assuming the individual has no skin synthesis of vitamin D because of inadequate sun exposure. The reference intake for vitamin D refers to total intake from food, beverages and supplements, is intended for the North American population, and assumes that calcium requirements are being met.<ref name="Ross_2011"/>{{rp|5}}

One school of thought contends that human physiology is fine tuned to an intake of 4000–12,000&nbsp;IU/day from sun exposure with concomitant serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 40 to 80&nbsp;ng/mL<ref name="Heaney_Holick_2011"/> and that this is required for optimal health. Proponents of this view, who include some members of the panel that drafted a now superseded 1997 report on vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine, contend that the IOM's warning about serum concentrations above 50&nbsp;ng/mL lacks biological plausibility. They suggest that for some people reducing the risk of preventable disease requires a higher level of vitamin D than that recommended by the IOM.<ref name=Holick2011>{{cite journal | author = Holick MF | title = Evaluation, treatment and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 96 | issue = 7 | pages = 1911–30 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21646368 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2011-0385 }}</ref><ref name="Heaney_Holick_2011">{{cite journal | author = Heaney RP, Holick MF | title = Perspective: Why the IOM Recommendations for Vitamin D are Deficient | journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 455–7 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21337617 | doi = 10.1002/jbmr.328 }}</ref>

===Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D===
US labs generally report 25(OH)D levels as ng/mL. Other countries often use nmol/L. 

A U.S. Institute of Medicine committee concluded that a [[serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D]] level of 20&nbsp;ng/mL (50 nmol/L) is desirable for bone and overall health. The [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s for vitamin D are chosen with a margin of safety and 'overshoot' the targeted serum value to ensure that the specified levels of intake achieve the desired serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in almost all persons. It is assumed there are no contributions to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level from sun exposure and the recommendations are fully applicable to people with dark skin or negligible exposure to sunlight.{{rp|1}}

The Institute found that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations above 30&nbsp;ng/mL (75 nmol/L) are "not consistently associated with increased benefit". Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels above 50&nbsp;ng/mL (125 nmol/L) may be cause for concern.<ref name="Ross_2011"/> However, the desired range of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is between 20-50&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref name="Ross_2011"/> 

There is a lower risk of cardiovascular disease when vitamin D ranged from 20 to 60 nmol/L (8 to 24&nbsp;ng/mL). There appears to be a "threshold effect" once 60 nmol/L (24&nbsp;ng/mL) have been reached i.e., levels of vitamin D over 60 nmol/L did not show added benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wang L, Song Y, Manson JE, et al. | title = Circulating 25-hydroxy-vitamin d and risk of cardiovascular disease.

==History==
American researchers [[Elmer McCollum]] and [[Marguerite Davis]] in 1914<ref name="Wolf_2004"/> discovered a substance in [[cod liver oil]] which later was called "vitamin A". British doctor [[Edward Mellanby]] noticed dogs that were fed cod liver oil did not develop rickets and concluded vitamin A, or a closely associated factor, could prevent the disease. In 1922, Elmer McCollum tested modified cod liver oil in which the vitamin A had been destroyed.<ref name="Wolf_2004"/> The modified oil cured the sick dogs, so McCollum concluded the factor in cod liver oil which cured rickets was distinct from vitamin A. He called it vitamin D because it was the fourth vitamin to be named.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/printarticle/239341 |title=Age-old children's disease back in force |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2007-07-25|accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/24/health/he-esoterica24|author = Elena Conis|title=Fortified foods took out rickets |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author = McClean FC, Budy AM |chapter=Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Cartilage, Bones, and Teeth | title = Vitamins and Hormones | chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?id=gGb7vm2SapcC&pg=PA51 | date = 28 January 1964 | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-709821-0 | volume = 21 | pages = 51–52 }}</ref> It was not initially realized that, unlike other vitamins, vitamin D can be synthesised by humans through exposure to UV light.

In 1925,<ref name="Wolf_2004"/> it was established that when [[7-Dehydrocholesterol|7-dehydrocholesterol]] is irradiated with light, a form of a [[fat-soluble]] vitamin is produced (now known as D<sub>3</sub>). [[Alfred Fabian Hess]] showed "light equals vitamin D."<ref>[http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 "Unraveling The Enigma Of Vitamin D"] [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]</ref> [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus|Adolf Windaus]], at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany, received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1928, for his work on the constitution of [[sterol]]s and their connection with vitamins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1928/windaus-bio.html | title = Adolf Windaus&nbsp;– Biography|publisher=Nobelprize.org|date=2010-03-25 | accessdate = 2010-03-25 }}</ref> In 1929 a group at [[National Institute for Medical Research|NIMR]] in Hampstead, London, were working on the structure of vitamin D, which was still unknown, as well as the structure of steroids. A meeting took place with [[J.B.S. Haldane]], [[John Desmond Bernal|J.D. Bernal]] and [[Dorothy Hodgkin|Dorothy Crowfoot]] to discuss possible structures, which contributed to bringing a team together. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that [[sterol]] molecules were flat, not as proposed by the German team led by [[Adolf Windaus|Windaus]]. In 1932 Otto Rosenheim and Harold King published a paper putting forward structures for sterols and bile acids which found immediate acceptance.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rosenheim O, King H | title = The Ring-system of sterols and bile acids.
