'''Sinus Buster''' is a brand of [[nasal spray]] that is available over-the-counter in the United States.  It is used to ease nasal congestion, sinus pressure, and sinus headache. It is a capsaicin-based nasal spray.

==Mechanism of Action==
The active ingredient in Sinus Buster is [[capsaicin]].  With respect to relief of [[nasal congestion]], sinus pressure, and [[sinus headache]], [[capsaicin]]:

#  Desensitizes the mucus membrane and blocks [[Substance P]], the chemical messenger that relays pain signals to the brain.
#  Increases mucus secretions to help the body to flush out [[bacteria]]. 
#  Dilates constricted blood vessels that can cause headaches.

==Clinical History==

===Sinus Buster===
In early 2010, Sinus Buster was evaluated in a double-blind study. The study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Sinus Buster for the treatment of sinus and nasal congestion in patients suffering from non-allergic rhinitis.  The study included 42 subjects and measured the improvement in nasal congestion, sinus pressure, and headache over 2 weeks.  It also evaluated speed of action and key safety parameters. The study showed that subjects who received Sinus Buster experienced onset of relief in under one minute per a stopwatch assessment (average of 52 seconds).  Sinus Buster subjects showed a statistically significant improvement over the placebo in nasal congestion, sinus pressure and headache at each of the measured time points after first use (5, 10, 15, 30, 60 minutes).  The study also showed Sinus Buster to have a favorable safety profile.  There was no negative effect on sense of smell or indication of rebound effect.  Although this pilot trial was small, Bernstein et al. concluded that Sinus Buster works quickly to effectively treat chronic rhinitis patients with a significant non-allergic component, and is safe to use continuously over 2 weeks.  Additional clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings in a larger patient population.

===Capsaicin===
Capsaicin-based nasal sprays have been tested clinically for over 10 years.  Key clinical findings are summarized below, as they relate to the use of capsaicin as a treatment option for sinusitis, allergic [[rhinitis]], and [[cluster headaches]]:

#  In another study, not using Sinus Buster, of hyperreactive rhinopathy with 84 patients, intranasal capsaicin was used for four weeks and resulted in marked reductions of symptoms without significant side effects in the majority of patients.<ref>Eberle L, Glück U., (1994). Clinical experiences with local capsaicin treatment of chronic rhinopathy. HNO. Nov; 42(11):665-9.</ref>
#  In a study of 50 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, topical, nasal capsaicin was shown to reduce Substance P content in nasal secretions by 43% (with statistical significance) and to result in a total effective rate of 94%.<ref>Zhang R, Jiang D, Li Z., (1995). Clinical observation and therapeutic mechanism of blocking agent of substance P nerves in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis. Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Ke Za Zhi. 30(3):163-5.</ref>
#  When studied as a treatment for cluster headache, nasal applications of capsaicin resulted in symptom amelioration in 70% of those patients who applied the drug on the same side as their cluster headache.<ref>Fusco BM, Marabini S, Maggi C, et al. (1994). Preventative effect of repeated nasal applications of capsaicin in cluster headache. Pain. 59:321–5.</ref>
#  In a study treating non-allergic non-infectious perennial rhinitis, intranasal capsaicin spray caused significant and long-term (up to 9 months post-therapy) reductions in overall nasal symptoms, rhinorrhea and nasal blockage.  No significant changes in safety (smell, blood pressure, heart rate) were seen.<ref>Van Rijswijk JB, Boeke EL, Keizer JM, Mulder PG, Blom HM, Fokkens WJ. (2003).

#  In a placebo-controlled study of 25 patients with non-allergic non-infectious perennial rhinitis, intranasal capsaicin was shown to have no significant impact on inflammatory markers (leukotriene (LT) C4/D4/E4, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and tryptase) in the nasal mucosa.<ref>Blom HM, Van Rijswijk JB, Garrelds IM, Mulder PG, Timmermans T, Gerth van Wijk R.

#  When used to treat non-allergic non-infectious perennial rhinitis, capsaicin aqueous nasal spray reduced nasal complaints without affecting cellular homeostasis or overall neurogenic staining up to 9 months after treatment.<ref>Blom HM, Severijnen LA, Van Rijswijk JB, Mulder PG, Van Wijk RG, Fokkens WJ. (1998). The long-term effects of capsaicin aqueous spray on the nasal mucosa. Clin Exp Allergy. Nov; 28(11):1351-8.</ref>
#  When used to treat allergic rhinitis, nasally applied capsaicin provided symptom relief, and resulted in a statistically significant 35% reduction in nasal airflow resistance.  At one-year follow-up, the total effective rate was 89%.<ref>Zhang F, Zhu X, Han D, Wang H, Wang L. (1999). Clinical study of capsaicin in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

==Media coverage==
Sinus Buster was the first commercial [[capsaicin]] nasal spray sold in stores, starting in 2003. It was invented by Wayne Perry, a frequent guest on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] during the 1990s. Since 2004, Sinus Buster has been featured in lots of media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]], Mike & Juliet, First Magazine, The Big Idea, the [[Howard Stern Show]] and more. [[J. R. Gach]] famously performed a commercial for the product describing it as "the best [[shit]] that ever was," which was advertised as the first radio commercial to feature profanity.<ref>http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/9/prweb444486.htm</ref> According to [Biz Journals],<ref>http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2008/07/28/story10.html</ref> the inventor sold the company to Dynova Laboratories in 2008 and created a new nasal spray that uses capsaicin and horseradish called Sinus Plumber.  In 2012, Sinus Buster has garnered a small testimonial reputation for curing cancer pain.<ref>http://www.amazon.com/The-Doctor-Cures-Cancer-ebook/dp/B0063916KK/</ref>
