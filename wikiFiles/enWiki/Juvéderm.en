'''Juvéderm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː|v|ɨ|d|ɜr|m}}), an injectable [[dermal filler]], is used by cosmetic, dermatological, and [[plastic surgeons]] to soften deep folds and reduce [[wrinkles]] in the [[face]]s of patients. The substance is largely [[hyaluronic acid]], a substance normally found in the skin, muscles, and tendons of [[mammals]]. Approved in June 2006 by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]], Juvéderm’s prime use is removing nasolabial folds, or “smile lines,” creases of skin which run from the corners of the [[nose]] to the corners of the [[mouth]]. It is also used as a lip augmentation agent, and to fill in hollow places and [[scars]] on the face. However, all hyaluronic acid facial filler products are eventually absorbed by the body, usually within six to nine months, causing the [[patient]] to undergo repeat injections to maintain the younger look. Juvéderm is also used by physicians to plump lips, which also lose [[fat]] and internal shape with normal [[aging]].

==FDA testing==
Before being released onto the U.S. [[market]], Juvéderm was compared with [[Zyplast]] dermal filler, a [[bovine]]-based injectable facial filler made from [[collagen]]. In clinical studies conducted at several [[U.S.]] medical centers to evaluate [[safety]] and [[efficacy]], or effectiveness, 146 subjects were followed for 24 weeks. The subjects had Juvéderm injected into one nasolabial fold and Zyplast in the other. Using [[scientific]] measuring scales, Juvéderm was deemed to provide a more persistent correction in the subjects’ facial folds. At the end of the study, the researchers asked subjects to judge which fold looked better to them. Eighty-eight percent chose the [[area]] treated with Juvéderm.<ref>http://www.dermatologytimes.com/dermatologytimes/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=390574&searchString=Juvéderm</ref>
Before FDA approval, two other clinical studies on Juvéderm were done on a total of 293 subjects in the United States. The safety profile and effectiveness was found to be similar to the first test.

==History==
In 1934, medical researchers Karl Meyer and John Palmer, [[scientists]] at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York]], found that one of the chief functions of hyaluronic acid is maintaining skin [[volume]] and hydration, along with other body [[Preventive maintenance|maintenance]] functions and tasks.

Meyer and Palmer first isolated the [[Chemical substance|substance]] from the [[eye]] of a [[cow]] and named hyaluronic acid by combining the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[glass]] -- hyalos—and the uronic sugar contained in hyaluronic acid.

Hyaluronic acid later found uses in the [[baking]] and [[food industry]] in the 1940s and, by the 1990s, found its way into the medical field for use in [[joint pain]], treating [[wounds]], [[eye surgery]] and, finally, in 1996, for facial tissue augmentation in [[Europe]].

==Current usage==
Juvéderm’s current [[competitive]] edge in [[cosmetic surgery]] is possible because, according to the manufacturers, Juvéderm is “cross linked.” In hyaluronic acid’s natural form, the substance is a [[liquid]] which the body [[metabolism|metabolizes]] in about half a day. Cross linking is a process that chemically binds the individual chains of the acid so that it is changed into a [[gel]] that lasts much longer once injected inside the face. Several other facial fillers used in Europe and the U.S. -- like Restylane, Belotero and Hylaform—are also cross-linked, with [[competition]] driving the other fillers toward even more highly cross linked [[Chemical compound|compounds]], according to Professor Berthold Rzany, professor of [[dermatology]] at the [[Charité]] Universitätsmedizin Berlin Germany.

Much of Juvederm's competitive edge is actually its ease of use for physician injectors. A free-flowing product for injecting into sensitive areas makes the process much more pleasant for doctor and patient. The new addition of lidocaine integration has subjectively improved the experience for the patient. Nissan Pilest, board certified dermatologist, associate professor at UCI School of Dermatology, medical director of a private practice and Juvederm training physician in Irvine, Ca., relates that Juvederm is a prime selection for most patients.

In a recent study by Allergan in 2012 (Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, Volume 11, Issue 4, pages 279–289, December 2012), the manufacturer of Juvéderm, has also successfully proven the value of hyaluronic acid in midface volume restoration including the malar region, periorbital regions, and the tear trough areas.

==Mechanism of action==
Juvéderm works well for [[plastic surgery|cosmetic and plastic surgery]] applications because hyaluronic acid can absorb up to 1,000 times its own weight in [[water]], thereby adding new volume under the surface of sagging skin. Older faces take on more youthful aspects because hyaluronic acid is known to bind with collagen—the material that supports human facial skin—and [[elastin]] to move more basic [[nutrients]] into the skin. 

When the [[University of Michigan]] organized a study on the dermal filler [[Restylane]] -- a close chemical sibling of Juvéderm—researchers found that hyaluronic acid stretches [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in skin known as [[fibroblasts]] in a way that causes the skin to create new collagen. The new collagen helps decrease the appearance of facial creases and wrinkles.  An unexpected—and welcome—finding cropped up: hyaluronic acid also seems to stop the breakdown of existing collagen.<ref>[http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2007/restylane.htm UMHS Press Release: The science behind a wrinkle-filler<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Potential risks and side effects==
[[Patients]], physicians and researchers say usual, expected side effects include temporary redness, pain and tenderness during injections and swelling and bruising at the injection sites. The more serious side effects include [[immune system]] reactions that result in  facial lumps and bumps known as [[granulomas]], bothersome reactions that are very difficult for physicians to treat.<ref>T. Lombardi, J. Samson, F. Plantier, C. Husson, R. Kuffer. Orofacial granulomas after injection of cosmetic fillers. Histopathologic and clinical study of 11 cases. Journal of Oral Path & Medicine, 33 (2), 115-120.</ref> According to [[Allergan]], Juvéderm should not be used in patients with severe allergies, particularly those who have allergies to bacterial proteins or patients with a history of [[anaphylaxis]], which is a potentially life threatening [[hypersensitivity]] to some drugs and [[proteins]].
