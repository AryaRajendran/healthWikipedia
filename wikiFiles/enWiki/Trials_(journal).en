{{Italic title}}
'''''Trials''''' is an [[open access]] [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] online journal regarding performance and outcomes of [[randomized controlled trial]]s.<ref name="About">{{cite web|url=http://www.trialsjournal.com/info/about/ |title=About Trials |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> The journal is published by [[BioMed Central]] and the [[editors-in-chief]] are [[Doug Altman]], Curt Furberg, Jeremy Grimshaw, and Peter Rothwell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trialsjournal.com/edboard/ |title=Editorial board |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> The journal encourages both authors and peer reviewers to make use of the [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT]] and [[QUOROM flow chart|QUOROM]] checklists for randomized trials and [[systematic review]]s, respectively.

== Contents ==
''Trials'' publishes several types of articles, including regular research articles (detailing trial results), [[book review]]s, commentaries on topics of contemporary interest that are usually commissioned by the journal, letter articles, articles on new experimental or computational methods, tests, or procedures, [[literature review|reviews]] including [[systematic review]]s, and articles in the form of study protocols.<ref name="Instructions">{{cite web|url=http://www.trialsjournal.com/info/instructions/ |title=Instructions for Trials authors |accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref>

=== Study protocols ===
''Trials'' also publishes study protocols.<ref name="Protocol">{{cite web|url=http://www.trialsjournal.com/info/instructions/?txt_jou_id=10096&txt_mst_id=61789 |title=Instructions for Trials authors - Study protocol |date=2009-02-15}}</ref> The publication of study protocols has been proposed by some, including ''Trials''' editor-in-chief Doug Altman, as a way to improve medical research on at least four areas:<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fiona Godlee |coauthors= |year=2001 |title=Publishing study protocols: making them visible will improve registration, reporting and recruitment |journal=[[BMC journals|BMC News and Views]] |volume=2 |issue= |pages=4 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-8219/2/4/ |accessdate= 2009-02-15}}</ref> Publishing protocols before they are finalised will allow others to provide constructive criticism, potentially improving the suggested trial; readers of scientific articles will be able to compare what was intended with the trial to what was actually done, in order to identify inappropriate [[data dredging]]; in general, protocol publication lets people know what is underway, reducing the risk of wasteful duplication of research effort and ensures that results from all trials are published, reducing the risk of [[publication bias]] in [[systematic review]]s; and finally, efforts to increase publication of protocols may also improve trial registration in registers such as [[ClinicalTrials.gov]].
