The modern '''history of hypertension''' begins with the understanding of the cardiovascular system with the work of physician [[William Harvey]] (1578–1657), who  described the circulation of blood in his book "''De motu cordis''". The English clergyman [[Stephen Hales]] made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733.<ref name="pmid1744849"/><ref name=Kotchen2011>{{cite journal|author=Kotchen TA |title=Historical trends and milestones in hypertension research: a model of the process of translational research |journal=Hypertension |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=522–38 |year=2011 |month=October |pmid=21859967|doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.177766}}</ref> Descriptions of hypertension as a disease came among others from [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1808 and especially [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]] in 1836.<ref name="pmid1744849"/> The first report of elevated blood pressure in a person without evidence of kidney disease was made by [[Frederick Akbar Mahomed]] (1849–1884).<ref>{{cite book |editor=Swales JD|title=Manual of hypertension|publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=1995 |pages=xiii |isbn=0-86542-861-1}}</ref>  However hypertension as a clinical entity came into being in 1896 with the invention of the cuff-based [[sphygmomanometer]] by [[Scipione Riva-Rocci]] in 1896.<ref>{{cite book | title=A century of arterial hypertension 1896–1996 | editor=Postel-Vinay N |page=213 | location=Chichester | publisher=Wiley | year=1996 | isbn=0-471-96788-2}}</ref> This allowed [[blood pressure]]to be measured in the clinic. In 1905, [[Nikolai Korotkoff]] improved the technique by describing the [[Korotkoff sounds]]that are heard when the artery is ausculated with a stethoscope while the sphygmomanometer cuff is deflated.<ref name=Kotchen2011/>

The concept of [[essential hypertension]] ('hypertonie essential') was introduced in 1925 by the physiologist [[Otto Frank (physiologist)|Otto Frank]] to describe elevated blood pressure for which no cause could be found. In 1928, the term [[malignant hypertension]] was coined by physicians from the [[Mayo Clinic]] to describe a syndrome of very high blood pressure, severe retinopathy and adequate kidney function which usually resulted in death within a year from [[stroke]]s, [[heart failure]] or [[kidney failure]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Keith NM, Wagener HP, Kernohan JW | title=The syndrome of malignant hypertension | journal=Arch.

Consequently, hypertension was often classified into "malignant" and "benign". In 1931, John Hay, Professor of Medicine at [[Liverpool University]], wrote that "there is some truth in the saying that the greatest danger to a man with a high blood pressure lies in its discovery, because then some fool is certain to try and reduce it".<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hay JH | title=A British Medical Association Lecture on THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A RAISED BLOOD PRESSURE| journal=Br.

Historically  the treatment for what was called the "hard pulse disease" consisted in reducing the quantity of blood by [[blood letting]] or the application of [[leech]]es.<ref name="pmid1744849">{{cite journal |author=Esunge PM |title=From blood pressure to hypertension: the history of research |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=84 |issue=10 |pages=621 |year=1991|month=October |pmid=1744849 |pmc=1295564}}</ref> This was advocated by The [[Yellow Emperor]] of China, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Cornelius Celsus]], [[Galen]], and [[Hippocrates]].<ref name="pmid1744849"/>

==Medications==
In the 19th and 20th centuries, before effective pharmacological treatment for hypertension became possible, three treatment modalities were used, all with numerous side-effects: strict sodium restriction (for example the rice diet<ref name="pmid1744849"/>), [[sympathectomy]] (surgical ablation of parts of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]), and pyrogen therapy (injection of substances that caused a fever, indirectly reducing blood pressure).<ref name="pmid1744849"/><ref name=Dustan/> The first chemical for hypertension, [[sodium thiocyanate]], was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular.<ref name="pmid1744849"/> Several other agents were developed after the [[World War II|Second World War]], the most popular and reasonably effective of which were [[tetramethylammonium chloride]] and its derivative [[hexamethonium]], [[hydralazine]] and [[reserpine]] (derived from the medicinal plant ''[[Rauwolfia serpentina]]''). A major breakthrough was achieved with the discovery of the first well-tolerated orally available agents. The first was[[chlorothiazide]], the first [[thiazide]] [[diuretic]] and developed from the antibiotic [[sulfanilamide]], which became available in 1958;<ref name="pmid1744849"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Novello FC, Sprague JM | title=Benzothiadiazine dioxides as novel diuretics | journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. | year=1957 | volume=79 | pages=2028 |doi=10.1021/ja01565a079|issue=8}}</ref> it increased salt excretion while preventing fluid accumulation. A [[randomized controlled trial]]  sponsored by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] comparing[[hydrochlorothiazide]] plus reserpine plus hydralazine versus placebo had to be stopped early in a high blood pressure group because those not receiving treatment developed many more complications and it was deemed unethical to withhold treatment from them. The study continued in people with lower blood pressures and showed that treatment even in people with mild hypertension more than halved the risk of cardiovascular death.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Freis ED | title=The Veterans Administration Cooperative Study on Antihypertensive Agents.

These measures appear to have contributed at least in part to the observed 50% fall in stroke and ischemic heart disease between 1972 and 1994.<ref name=Dustan/>

Soon more drugs became available to treat hypertension. The British physician [[James W. Black]] developed [[beta blocker]]s in the early 1960s;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Black JW, Crowther AF, Shanks RG, Smith LH, Dornhorst AC |title=A new adrenergic beta receptor antagonist|journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=7342 |pages=1080–1 |year=1964 |month=May|pmid=14132613 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(64)91275-9}}</ref> these were initially used for [[angina pectoris|angina]], but turned out to lower blood pressure. Black received the 1976 [[Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award|Lasker Award]] and in 1988 the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery.<ref name=Dustan/> The next class of antihypertensives to be discovered were [[calcium channel blockers]]. The first member was [[verapamil]], a derivative of [[papaverine]] that was initially thought to be a beta blocker and used for angina, but then turned out to have a different mode of action and was shown to lower blood pressure.<ref name=Dustan/> The [[renin-angiotensin system]] was known to play an important role in blood pressure regulation, and [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE) inhibitors were developed through [[Drug design|rational drug design]]. In 1977 [[captopril]], an orally active agent, was described;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ondetti MA, Rubin B, Cushman DW |title=Design of specific inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme: new class of orally active antihypertensive agents |journal=Science |volume=196 |issue=4288 |pages=441–4 |year=1977|month=April |pmid=191908 |doi=10.1126/science.191908}}</ref> this led to the development of a number of other ACE inhibitors.<ref name=Dustan/> More recently [[angiotensin receptor blockers]] and [[renin inhibitors]] have also been introduced as antihypertensive agents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wexler RR, Greenlee WJ, Irvin JD, ''et al.''|title=Nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonists: the next generation in antihypertensive therapy |journal=J.
