It is considered by public safety authorities, medical practice, and [[emergency services]] to be a [[medical emergency]], requiring immediate [[suicide intervention]] and emergency medical treatment.
== Nature of a suicide crisis ==

Most cases of potential suicide have warning signs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Attempting to kill oneself or [[Self-harm|harming oneself]], [[suicidal ideation|talking about or planning suicide]], writing a [[suicide note]], talking or thinking frequently about death, exhibiting a death wish by expressing it verbally or by taking potentially deadly risks, are all indicators of a suicide crisis.  More subtle clues include preparing for death for no apparent reason (such as putting affairs in order, changing a will, etc.), writing goodbye letters,  and visiting or calling family members or friends to say farewell.  The person may also start giving away previously valued items (because he or she "no longer needs them"). In other cases, the person who seemed depressed and suicidal may become normal again; these people particularly need to be watched because the return to normalcy could be because they have come to terms with whatever act is next.

[[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is a major causative factor of suicide, and individuals suffering from depression are considered a high-risk group for suicidal behavior. However, suicidal behaviour is not just restricted to patients diagnosed with some form of depression.<ref> Barker, P. (2003). Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing ''The craft of caring.'' pp 227.

Suicide is often committed in response to a cause of depression, such as the cessation of a romantic relationship, serious illness or injury (like the loss of a limb or blindness), the death of a loved one, financial problems or poverty, guilt or fear of getting caught for something the person did, drug abuse, old age, concerns with sexual identity (that is, wanting to be a member of the opposite sex), among others.<ref>{{cite web |title=Suicide |url=https://www.healthforums.com/library/1,1258,article~6229,00.html |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=22 August 2009}}</ref>

In 2006, WHO conducted a study on suicide around the world. The results in Canada showed that 80-90% of attempts failed (an estimation, due to the complications of predicting attempted suicide). 90% of failed suicides investigated lead to hospitalizations. 12% of attempts were in hospitals.
