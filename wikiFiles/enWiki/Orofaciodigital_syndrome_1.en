'''Orofaciodigital syndrome 1''' (OFD1), also called '''Papillon-League and Psaume syndrome''',<ref name=omim>{{OMIM|311200}}</ref> is an [[X-linked]] [[congenital disorder]] characterized by malformations of the [[face]], [[oral cavity]], and [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] with [[polycystic kidney disease]] and variable involvement of the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="badano2006">{{cite journal

==Cause and Genetics==
Orofaciodigital syndrome type 1 is caused by mutations in the [[OFD1]] gene.  OFD1 localizes to both [[centrosome]]s and [[basal bodies]] within the [[human]] [[cell (biology)|genetic cellular structure]].  This suggests that this syndrome may fall into a broad category of [[cilium|ciliary]] [[ciliopathy|diseases]]. The ciliary [[organelle]]s are present in many cellular types throughout the [[human]] body.  The cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential to cellular development.<ref name="badano2006"/>

*{{OMIM3|258860}} {{RareDiseases|816|Orofaciodigital syndrome 4}}
*{{OMIM3|300238}} {{RareDiseases|4119|Orofaciodigital syndrome, Shashi type}}
*{{OMIM3|277170}} {{RareDiseases|5458|Varadi Papp syndrome; OFD6}}

=== Relation to other rare genetic disorders ===

Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of [[genetic disorder]]s, both [[Syndrome|genetic syndromes]] and [[Disease|genetic diseases]], that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related, may be, in fact, highly related in the [[genotype|genetypical]] root cause of the widely-varying, [[phenotype|phenotypically]]-observed [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]].  Thus, orofaciodigital syndrome is a [[ciliopathy]].  Other known ciliopathies include [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[Bardet-Biedl syndrome]], [[polycystic kidney disease]] and [[polycystic liver disease]], [[nephronophthisis]], [[Alstrom syndrome]], [[Meckel-Gruber syndrome]] and some forms of [[retinal degeneration]].<ref name="badano2006"/>
