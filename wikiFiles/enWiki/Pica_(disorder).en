'''Pica''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|p|aɪ|k|ə}} {{respell|PY|kə}}) is characterized by an [[appetite]] for substances largely non-nutritive, such as clay, chalk, dirt, or sand.<ref name=Span04/> For these actions to be considered pica, they must persist for more than one month at an age where eating such objects is considered [[Intellectual development|developmentally]] inappropriate. There are different variations of pica, as it can be from a cultural tradition, acquired taste or a neurological mechanism such as an [[iron deficiency]], or chemical imbalance. It can lead to intoxication in children which can result in an impairment in both physical and mental development.<ref name=Blinder>{{cite journal|last=Blinder|first=Barton, J.|coauthors=Salama, C.|title=An update on Pica: prevelance, contributing causes, and treatment|journal=Psychiatric Times|year=2008|month=may|volume=25|issue=6}}</ref> In addition, it can also lead to surgical emergencies due to an intestinal obstruction as well as more subtle symptoms such as nutritional deficiencies and [[parasitosis]].<ref name=Blinder /> Pica has been linked to mental disorders and they often have psychotic comorbidity.  Stressors such as maternal deprivation, family issues, parental neglect, pregnancy, poverty, and a disorganized family structure are strongly linked to pica.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Pica is more commonly seen in women and children,<ref name=Rose00>{{cite journal | author = Rose, E. A., Porcerelli, J. H., & Neale, A. V. | title = Pica: Common but commonly missed | journal = The Journal of the American Board of Family Practice | year = 2000 | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–8 | pmid = 11001006 }}</ref> where it affects people of all ages in these subgroups. Particularly it is seen in [[pregnancy|pregnant women]], small children, and those with [[developmental disabilities]] such as [[autism]]. Children eating painted plaster containing [[lead]] may suffer brain damage from [[lead poisoning]]. There is a similar risk from eating dirt near roads that existed prior to the phaseout of [[tetraethyllead]] in petrol (in some countries) or prior to the cessation of the use of contaminated oil (either used or containing toxic [[PCBs]] or [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]) to settle dust. In addition to poisoning, there is also a much greater risk of [[bowel obstruction|gastro-intestinal obstruction]] or tearing in the [[stomach]].<ref name=Karl>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1375586/Comfort-food-The-woman-stop-eating-sofas.html | title = Comfort food: The woman who suffers from a rare disorder that means she cannot stop herself from eating... sofas | author = Karl, Peter | publisher = Daily Mail Online | accessdate = April 21, 2011 | location=London | date=11 April 2011}}</ref>{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2012}} Another risk of dirt-eating is the ingestion of animal feces and accompanying [[parasitism|parasites]]. Pica can also be found in other animals and is most commonly found in dogs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Pica stone.jpg|thumb|Chalky stone composed of [[kaolinite]] with traces of [[quartz]] ingested by a person with pica.]]
Pica is the consumption of substances with no significant nutritive value such as earth or ice.<ref name=Span04>{{cite journal|last=López|first=LB|coauthors=Ortega Soler, CR, de Portela, ML|title=Pica during pregnancy: a frequently underestimated problem|journal=Archivos latinoamericanos de nutricion|date=2004 Mar|volume=54|issue=1|pages=17–24|pmid=15332352}}</ref> Subtypes are characterized by the substance eaten for example:

* [[Amylophagia]] (consumption of [[starch]])
* [[Coprophagy]] (consumption of [[feces]])
* [[Geophagy]] (consumption of [[soil]], [[clay]], or [[chalk]])
* [[Hyalophagia]] (consumption of [[glass]])
* Consumption of dust or sand has been reported among iron-deficient patients.
* Lithophagia (a subset of geophagia, consumption of [[pebble]]s or [[rock (geology)|rocks]])<ref>{{cite journal|last=Somalwar|first=Ashutosh|coauthors=Keyur Kishor Dave|title=Lithophagia: Pebbles in and Pebbles out|journal=Journal of the Association of Physicians of India|date=March 2011|accessdate=22 July 2012|volume=59|page=170|url=http://japi.org/march_2011/article_07.pdf}}</ref>
* [[Mucophagia]] (consumption of [[mucus]])
* Odowa (soft stones eaten by pregnant women in [[Kenya]])<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7596067.stm Why Kenyan women crave stones] BBC News</ref>
* Consumption of paint.
* [[Pagophagia]] (pathological consumption of [[ice]])
* [[Self-cannibalism]] (rare condition where body parts may be consumed; see also [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]])
* [[Trichophagia]] (consumption of [[hair]] or [[wool]])
* [[Urophagia]] (consumption of [[urine]])
* [[Xylophagia]] (consumption of [[wood]] or [[paper]])

This pattern of eating should last at least one month to fit the diagnosis of pica.<ref name="Pica">[http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/pica/overview.html Pica] New York Times Health Guide</ref>

===Complications===
Complications may occur due to the substance consumed. For example [[lead poisoning]] may result from the ingestion of paint or paint-soaked [[plaster]], [[hairball]]s may cause intestinal obstruction and [[Toxoplasma]] or [[Toxocara]] infections may follow ingestion of feces or dirt.<ref name="Spitzer, Robert L 1986">[Spitzer, Robert L. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: (DSM III). Cambridge: Univ. of Cambridge, 1986. Print.]</ref>

==Diagnosis==
There is no single test that confirms pica. However, because pica can occur in people who have lower than normal nutrient levels and poor nutrition (malnutrition), the health care provider should test blood levels of iron and zinc.
Hemoglobin can also be checked to test for [[anemia]]. Lead levels should always be checked in children who may have eaten paint or objects covered in lead-paint dust. The health care provider should test for infection if the person has been eating contaminated soil or animal waste.<ref name="Pica"/>

===DSM===
#Persistent eating of nonnutritive substances for a period of at least one month<ref name= Susic>{{cite web|last=Susic MA licensed psychologist|first=Paul|title=Pica Sympotms and DSV-IV Overview|url=http://www.psychtreatment.com/mental_health_pica.htm|work=psychtreatment.com|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>
#Does not meet the criteria for either having autism, schizophrenia, or Kleine-Levin syndrome.<ref name="Spitzer, Robert L 1986"/>
#The eating behavior is not culturally sanctioned<ref name=Susic/>
#If the eating behavior occurs exclusively during the course of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia), it is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.<ref name=Susic/>

===Differential diagnosis===
In individuals with [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], and certain physical disorders (such as [[Kleine-Levin syndrome]]), nonnutritive substances may be eaten. In such instances, Pica should not be noted as an additional diagnosis.<ref name="Spitzer, Robert L 1986"/>

==Causes==
The scant research that has been done on the causes of pica suggests that the disorder is a [[specific appetite]] caused by [[mineral deficiency]] in many cases, such as [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]], which sometimes is a result of [[celiac disease]]<ref name=Rose00 /> or [[hookworm]] infection.<ref>{{cite book |title=Advances in parasitology, Volume 17 |editor= William Hepburn Russell Lumsden|year=1979 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-031717-2 |page=337 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZIxHuhf_MEcC&pg=PA337&dq=pica+hookworm#v=onepage&q=pica%20hookworm&f=false}}</ref>  Often the substance eaten by someone with pica contains the mineral in which that individual is deficient.<ref name=Sayetta>Sayetta RB: Pica: an overview. Am Fam Physician 1986;7:174-5.</ref>  More recently, cases of pica have been tied to the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]], and there is a move to consider OCD in the [[etiology]] of pica.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hergüner, S., Ozyildirim, I., & Tanidir, C. | year = 2008 | title = Is Pica an eating disorder or an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder? | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 2010–1 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.09.011 | pmid = 18848964 }}</ref> However, pica is currently recognized as a mental disorder by the widely used ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV). Sensory, physiological, cultural and psychosocial perspectives have also been used by some to explain the causation of pica.

It has been proposed that mental-health conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia, can sometimes cause pica.<ref>Gull WW: Anorexia nervosa (apepsia hysterica, anorexia hysterica). Tras.Clin.Soc.Lond.1874;7:22</ref>

However, pica can also be a cultural practice not associated with a deficiency or disorder. Ingestion of [[kaolin]] (white dirt) among [[African-American]] women in the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] shows the practice there to be a DSM-IV "[[culture-bound syndrome]]" and "not selectively associated with other psychopathology".<ref>R.

==Treatment==

Treatment for pica may vary by patient and suspected cause (e.g., child, developmentally disabled, pregnant or psychotic) and may emphasize [[psychosocial]], environmental and family-guidance approaches, (iron deficiency) may be treatable though iron supplement through dietary changes. An initial approach often involves screening for and, if necessary, treating any mineral deficiencies or other [[Comorbidity|comorbid conditions]].<ref name=Rose00/> For pica that appears to be of psychotic etiology, therapy and medication such as [[SSRIs]] have been used successfully.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bhatia, M. S., & Gupta, R. | date = 2007-05-11 | title = Pica responding to SSRI: An OCD spectrum disorder? | journal = The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry }} Online publication ahead of print. PMID 17853279</ref>  However, previous reports have cautioned against the use of medication until all non-psychotic etiologies have been ruled out.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fotoulaki, M., Panagopoulou, P., Efstratiou, I., & Nousia-Arvanitakis, S. | year = 2007 | title = Pitfalls in the approach to pica | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 166 | issue = 6 | pages = 623–4 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-006-0282-1 | pmid = 17008997 }}</ref>

Looking back at the different causes of Pica related to assessment, the clinician will try to develop a treatment. First, there is Pica as a result of social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person’s behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their Pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual’s communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If Pica is a way for a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If Pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other non-medication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. These things can be placed in a “Pica Box” which should be easily accessible to the individual when they feel like engaging in Pica.<ref name="Blinder"/>

Behavior-based treatment options can be useful for developmentally disabled and mentally ill individuals with pica. These may involve using positive reinforcement normal behavior. Many use aversion therapy, where the patient learns through positive reinforcement which foods are good and which ones they should not eat. Often treatment is similar to the treatment of obsessive compulsive or addictive disorders (such as exposure therapy). In some cases treatment is as simple as addressing the fact they have this disorder and why they may have it. A recent study classified nine such classes of behavioral intervention:  Success with treatment is generally high and generally fades with age, but it varies depending on the cause of the disorder. Developmental causes tend to have a lower success rate. Pregnancy craving causes tend to have higher success rates.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McAdam, D.B., Sherman, J.A., Sheldon, J.B., & Napolitano, D.A. | year = 2004 | title = Behavioral interventions to reduce the pica of persons with developmental disabilities | journal = Behavior Modification | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–72 | doi = 10.1177/0145445503259219 | pmid = 14710707 }}</ref>

Treatment techniques include:<ref name="Blinder"/>
* Presentation of attention, food or toys, not contingent on pica being attempted
* Differential reinforcement, with positive reinforcement if pica is not attempted and consequences if pica is attempted
* Discrimination training between edible and inedible items, with negative consequences if pica is attempted
* Visual screening, with eyes covered for a short time after pica is attempted
* Aversive presentation, contingent on pica being attempted:
# oral taste (e.g., lemon)
#smell sensation (e.g., [[ammonia]])
#physical sensation (e.g., water mist in face)
* Physical restraint:
#self-protection devices that prohibit placement of objects in the mouth
#brief restraint contingent on pica being attempted
#Time-out contingent on pica being attempted
#Overcorrection, with attempted pica resulting in required washing of self, disposal of nonedible objects and chore-based punishment
#Negative practice (non-edible object held against patient's mouth without allowing ingestion)

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of pica is difficult to establish because of differences in definition and the reluctance of patients to admit to abnormal cravings and ingestion.<ref name= Blinder/> Thusly leading to the [[prevalence]] recordings of pica being in the range of 8% and 65% depending on the study.<ref name=Span04/> A study published in 1994 found that 8.1% of pregnant [[African-American]] women in the United States self-reported pagophagia, the ingestion of large quantities of ice and freezer frost.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Edwards | title = Pica in an urban environment | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | year = 1994 | volume = 124 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 954S–962S | pmid = 8201446 | author-separator = , | author2 = C.

This is due to different cultural norms as well as greater levels of [[malnutrition]]. Two studies of [[mentally retarded]] adults living in [[Psychiatric hospital|institutions]] found that 21.8%<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ashworth, M., Hirdes, J.P., & Martin, L. | year = 2009 | title = The social and recreational characteristics of adults with intellectual disability and pica living in institutions | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 512–20 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2008.07.010 | pmid = 18789647 }}</ref> and 25.8%<ref>{{cite journal | author = Danford, D.E., & Huber, A.M. | year = 1982 | title = Pica among mentally retarded adults | journal = American Journal of Mental Deficiency | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–6 | pmid = 7124824 }}</ref> of these groups suffered from pica. Prevalence rates for children with and without developmental disabilities are unknown.

==History==
The term pica originates from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[magpie]]'', a bird that is reputed for its unusual eating behaviors where they are known to eat almost anything.<ref name="MentalHealth">{{cite book
| last = Thyer| first = Bruce A. |last2 = Wodarski |first2 = John S

Even today, what can be classified as pica behavior is a normative practice in some cultures as part of magical beliefs, healing methods, or religious ceremonies.<ref name=Rose00 />

==In other animals==
Unlike in humans, pica in dogs or cats may be a sign of [[Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia|immune-mediated hemolytic anemia]], especially when it involves eating substances such as tile [[grout]], [[concrete]] dust and [[sand]]. Dogs exhibiting this form of pica should be tested for anemia with a [[Complete blood count|CBC]] or at least [[hematocrit]] levels.<ref>{{cite book | last = Plunkett | first = Signe J. | year = 2000 | title = Emergency Procedures for the Small Animal Veterinarian | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | pages = 11 | isbn = 0-7020-2487-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Feldman | first = Bernard F. | coauthors = Joseph G. Zinkl, Nemi Chand Jain, Oscar William Schalm | year = 2000 | title = Schalm's Veterinary Hematology | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | pages = 506 | isbn = 0-683-30692-8}}</ref>  However since it may be an evolved natural mechanism to increase micronutrient levels this type of [[geophagia]] may not be accurately described as pica since it is not actually a diseased behaviour.
