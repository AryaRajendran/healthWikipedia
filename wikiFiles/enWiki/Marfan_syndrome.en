'''Marfan  syndrome''' (also  called '''Marfan's  syndrome''') is  a [[genetic disorder]] of  the [[connective tissue]]. People with Marfan tend to be unusually tall, with long [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s and long, thin fingers.

The syndrome is inherited as a [[Autosomal dominant|dominant]] trait, carried by the gene ''[[FBN1]]'', which encodes the connective protein [[fibrillin]]-1.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kainulainen K, Karttunen L, Puhakka L, Sakai L, Peltonen L |title=Mutations in the fibrillin gene responsible for dominant [[ectopia lentis]] and neonatal Marfan syndrome |journal=Nat.

Because it is [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]], people who have inherited one affected ''FBN1'' gene from either parent will have Marfan syndrome.

Marfan syndrome has a range of expressions, from mild to severe.  The most serious complications are defects of the [[heart valves]] and [[aorta]]. It may also affect the [[human lung|lung]]s, the eyes, the [[Dura mater|dural]] sac surrounding the [[spinal cord]], the skeleton and the [[hard palate]].

In addition to being a connective protein that forms the structural support for tissues outside the cell, the normal fibrillin-1 protein binds to another protein, [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-β).<ref name="ReferenceA"/> TGF-β has deleterious effects on vascular smooth muscle development and the integrity of the extracellular matrix. Researchers now believe, secondary to mutated fibrillin, excessive TGF-β at the lungs, heart valves, and aorta weakens the tissues and causes the features of Marfan syndrome.<ref>Robbins and Cotran Pathological Basis of Disease, Kumar et al; 8th Edition, Saunders Elsevier Publishing, 2010</ref> Since [[angiotensin II receptor antagonists]] (ARBs) also reduce TGF-β, ARBs ([[losartan]], etc.) have been tested in a small sample of young, severely affected Marfan syndrome patients.

Marfan syndrome does not adversely affect intelligence. On the contrary, patients are often very smart.<ref>http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A3065140</ref>  One study finds that the average [[IQ]] of children with Marfan Syndrome is 109.3, which is higher than average.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajmg.1320310210/full</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
More than 30 different [[Medical sign|signs]] and [[symptom]]s are variably associated with Marfan syndrome.  The most prominent of these, affecting the skeletal system, are found in numerous other diseases (see Differential Diagnosis, below).  Thus, it is not possible to make a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome simply by the person's appearance.  Instead, distinguishing Marfan syndrome from other "marfanoid" syndromes (without recourse to DNA testing) requires the assessment of non-skeletal clinical and laboratory findings, especially of the eyes, aorta, and heart.  Complicating the physical assessment of such persons, considerable clinical variability occurs within families carrying an identical DNA variant.

===Skeletal system===
Most of the readily visible signs are associated with the skeletal system.  Many individuals with Marfan syndrome grow to above-average height. Some have long, slender limbs ([[dolichostenomelia]]) with long fingers and toes ([[arachnodactyly]]). An individual's arms may be disproportionately long, with thin, weak wrists. In addition to affecting height and limb proportions, Marfan syndrome can produce other skeletal anomalies. Abnormal curvature of the [[Vertebral column|spine]] ([[scoliosis]]), abnormal indentation ([[pectus excavatum]]) or protrusion ([[pectus carinatum]]) of the [[Human sternum|sternum]] are not uncommon. Other signs include abnormal joint flexibility, a high [[palate]], [[malocclusions]], [[flat feet]], [[hammer toe]]s, stooped shoulders, and unexplained [[stretch marks]] on the skin. It can also cause pain in the joints, bones and muscles in some patients. Some people with Marfan have [[speech disorder]]s resulting from symptomatic high palates and small jaws.  Early [[osteoarthritis]] may occur. Other signs include limited range of motion in the hips due to the [[femur|femoral head]] protruding into abnormally deep hip sockets ([[protrusio acetabuli]]).<ref name="Van de Velde 2006">{{cite journal|last=Van de Velde|first=S|coauthors=Fillman, R; Yandow, S|title=Protrusio acetabuli in Marfan syndrome. History, diagnosis, and treatment.|journal=The Journal of bone and joint surgery. American volume|date=2006 Mar|volume=88|issue=3|pages=639–46|pmid=16510833}}</ref>

===Eyes===
[[Image:Lens marfan.gif|thumb|[[Lens dislocation]] in Marfan syndrome; the lens was kidney-shaped and was resting against the [[ciliary body]].]]
Marfan syndrome can also seriously affect the eyes and vision. [[myopia|Nearsightedness]] and [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]] are common, but farsightedness can also result. [[Subluxation]] (dislocation) of the crystalline [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] in one or both eyes (''[[ectopia lentis]]'') (in 80% of patients) also occurs and may be detected by an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] using a [[Slit lamp|slit-lamp]] biomicroscope. In Marfan the dislocation is typically superotemporal whereas in the similar condition [[homocystinuria]], the dislocation is inferonasal.  Sometimes eye problems appear only after the weakening of connective tissue has caused [[retinal detachment|detachment of the retina]].<ref name="mayo-gen">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/marfan-syndrome/DS00540/DSECTION=2|title=Marfan Syndrome|accessdate=January 12, 2007|publisher=Mayo Clinic}}</ref> Early onset [[glaucoma]] can be another related problem.

===Cardiovascular system===
The most serious signs and symptoms associated with Marfan syndrome involve the cardiovascular system: undue fatigue, shortness of breath, [[heart palpitations]], [[tachycardia|racing heartbeats]], or [[angina pectoris]] with pain radiating to the back, shoulder, or arm.  Cold arms, hands and feet can also be linked to Marfan syndrome because of inadequate circulation. A [[heart murmur]], abnormal reading on an [[electrocardiogram|EKG]], or symptoms of angina can indicate further investigation. The signs of regurgitation from [[prolapse]] of the mitral or aortic [[heart valve|valves]] (which control the flow of blood through the heart) result from cystic medial degeneration of the valves, which is commonly associated with Marfan syndrome (see [[mitral valve prolapse]], [[aortic regurgitation]]). However, the major sign that would lead a doctor to consider an underlying condition is a [[Annuloaortic ectasia|dilated aorta]] or an [[aortic aneurysm]].  Sometimes, no heart problems are apparent until the weakening of the connective tissue (cystic medial degeneration) in the [[aorta|ascending aorta]] causes an [[aortic aneurysm]] or [[aortic dissection]], a surgical emergency. An aortic dissection is most often fatal and presents with pain radiating down the back, giving a tearing sensation.

Because  underlying connective tissue abnormalities cause Marfan syndrome, there is an increased incidence of [[dehiscence]] of prosthetic mitral valve.<ref name="Braunwald-2005">{{cite book | coauthors=Zipes, Libby Bonow Braunwald | title=Braunwald's Heart Disease ~ A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, Seventh Edition | publisher=Elseview Saunders | year=2005 | location=United States of America | pages=1894 | isbn=0-7216-0509-5}}</ref>  Care should be taken to attempt repair of damaged heart valves rather than replacement.

During pregnancy, even in the absence of preconception cardiovascular abnormality, women with Marfan syndrome are at significant risk of [[aortic dissection]], which is often fatal even when rapidly treated. Women with Marfan syndrome, then, should receive a thorough assessment prior to conception, and [[echocardiography]] should be performed every six to 10 weeks during pregnancy, to assess the aortic root diameter. For most women, safe vaginal delivery is possible.<ref name="emed">{{Cite web|author=Chen H|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/946315-print|title=Marfan Syndrome|publisher=eMedicine|date=June 4, 2007|accessdate=June 25, 2007}}</ref>

===Lungs===
[[Pulmonary]] symptoms are not a major feature of Marfan syndrome,<ref name="Dyhdalo 2011">{{cite journal|last=Dyhdalo|first=K|coauthors=Farver, C|title=Pulmonary histologic changes in Marfan syndrome: a case series and literature review.|journal=American journal of clinical pathology|date=2011 Dec|volume=136|issue=6|pages=857–63|pmid=22095370}}</ref><!-- listed as a review on pubmed --> but spontaneous [[pneumothorax]] is common.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siepe|first=M|coauthors=Löffelbein, F|title=[The Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders].|journal=Medizinische Monatsschrift fur Pharmazeuten|date=2009 Jun|volume=32|issue=6|pages=213–9|pmid=19554831}}</ref> In spontaneous unilateral pneumothorax, air escapes from a lung and occupies the [[pleural]] space between the chest wall and a lung. The lung becomes partially compressed or collapsed.  This can cause pain, shortness of breath, [[cyanosis]], and, if not treated, it can cause death. Other possible pulmonary manifestations of Marfan syndrome include [[sleep apnea]] and [[idiopathic]] obstructive lung disease.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}} Pathologic changes in the lungs have been described such as [[cyst]]ic changes, [[emphysema]], [[pneumonia]], [[bronchiectasis]], [[bulla]]e, apical [[fibrosis]] and congenital malformations such as middle lobe hypoplasia.<ref name="Dyhdalo 2011" />

===Central nervous system===
[[Dural ectasia]], the weakening of the connective tissue of the dural sac encasing the [[spinal cord]], though not life-threatening, can reduce the quality of life for an individual.  It can be present for a long time without producing any noticeable symptoms.  Symptoms that can occur are lower [[back pain]], leg pain, [[abdominal pain]], other neurological symptoms in the lower extremities, or [[headache]]s. Such symptoms usually diminish when the individual lies flat on his or her back.  These types of symptoms might lead a doctor to order an [[X-ray]] of the [[lumbar|lower spine]].  Dural ectasia is usually not visible on an X-ray in the early phases. A worsening of symptoms and the lack of finding any other cause could eventually lead a doctor to order an [[MRI]] of the lower spine.  Dural ectasia that has progressed to the point of causing these symptoms would appear in an MRI image as a dilated pouch wearing away at the [[lumbar vertebrae]].<ref name="mayo-gen" /> Other spinal issues associated with Marfan syndrome include degenerative disk disease, spinal cysts and [[dysautonomia]].

== Pathogenesis ==
Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the ''FBN1'' [[gene]] on [[Chromosome 15 (human)|chromosome 15]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = McKusick V | title = The defect in Marfan syndrome | journal = Nature | volume = 352 | issue = 6333 | pages = 279–81 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1852198 | doi = 10.1038/352279a0|bibcode = 1991Natur.352..279M }}</ref> which [[Genetics|encodes]] the [[glycoprotein]] [[fibrillin]]-1, a component of the extracellular matrix. Fibrillin-1 protein is essential for the proper formation of the extracellular matrix, including the biogenesis and maintenance of [[elastic fibers]].  The extracellular matrix is critical for both the structural integrity of connective tissue, but also serves as a reservoir for growth factors.<ref name="robspath">{{cite book | title=Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease| last=Cotran| coauthors=Kumar, Collins| publisher=W.B Saunders Company| location=Philadelphia| isbn=0-7216-7335-X | year=1998}}</ref> [[Elastin]] fibers are found throughout the body, but are particularly abundant in the [[aorta]], [[ligament]]s and the [[Zonule of Zinn|ciliary zonule]]s of the eye; consequently, these areas are among the worst affected.

A [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic]] mouse has been created carrying a single copy of a mutant fibrillin-1, a mutation similar to that found in the human gene known to cause Marfan syndrome.  This mouse strain recapitulates many of the features of the human disease and promises to provide insights into the [[pathogenesis]] of the disease.  Reducing the level of normal fibrillin 1 causes a Marfan-related disease in mice.<ref name="micefib">{{cite journal |author=Pereira L, Lee SY, Gayraud B, ''et al.'' |title=Pathogenetic sequence for aneurysm revealed in mice underexpressing fibrillin-1 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=3819–23 |year=1999 |month=March |pmid=10097121 |pmc=22378 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.7.3819|bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.3819P }}</ref>

[[Transforming growth factor]] beta ([[TGF beta|TGFβ]]) plays an important role in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin-1 directly binds a latent form of TGFβ, keeping it sequestered and unable to exert its biological activity. The simplest model of Marfan syndrome suggests reduced levels of fibrillin-1 allow TGFβ levels to rise due to inadequate sequestration.  Although it is not proven how elevated TGFβ levels are responsible for the specific pathology seen with the disease, an inflammatory reaction releasing proteases that slowly degrade the elastin fibers and other components of the extracellular matrix is known to occur.  The importance of the TGFβ pathway was confirmed with the discovery of the similar [[Loeys-Dietz syndrome]] involving the  ''TGFβR2'' gene on [[Chromosome 3 (human)|chromosome 3]], a [[receptor protein]] of TGFβ.<ref name="tgf2beta">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=gene&dopt=full_report&list_uids=7048|title=TGFBR2 transforming growth factor, beta receptor II|accessdate=January 11, 2007|publisher=NCBI|year=2007|author=Entrez Gene|format=Entrez gene entry}}</ref> Marfan syndrome has often been confused with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, because of the considerable clinical overlap between the two pathologies.<ref name="loeysdietz">{{Cite web|url=http://www.marfan.org/nmf/GetContentRequestHandler.do?menu_item_id=84|title=Related Disorders: Loeys-Dietz |accessdate=January 11, 2007|publisher=National Marfan Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060925143304/http://www.marfan.org/nmf/GetContentRequestHandler.do?menu_item_id=84 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 25, 2006}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnostic criteria of Marfan syndrome were agreed upon internationally in 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |author=De Paepe A, Devereux RB, Dietz HC, Hennekam RC, Pyeritz RE |title=Revised diagnostic criteria for the Marfan syndrome |journal=Am.

===Revised Ghent Nosology===

According to the US National Marfan Foundation, in 2010 the Ghent Nosology was revised, and new diagnostic criteria superseded the previous agreement made in 1996.  The seven new criteria can lead to a diagnosis:{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2011}}<ref>{{Unreliable medical source|date=February 2011}}{{cite web

|year=2007}}
</ref>  Distinguishing among these "marfanoid" disorders can be facilitated by genetic testing, and by evaluating signs and symptoms other than body habitus.  Among the disorders capable of producing a marfanoid body habitus are:

* [[Arachnodactyly|Congenital contractural arachnodactyly]] or Beals syndrome
* [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]]
* [[Homocystinuria]]
* [[Loeys–Dietz syndrome]]

==Management==
There is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but [[life expectancy]] has increased significantly over the last few decades and is now similar to that of the average person.<ref>http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/marfan_syndrome/</ref> Clinical trials are also under way for a promising new treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Freeman, Elaine |title=A Silver Bullet for Blake |journal=Johns Hopkins Magazine |year=2007 |month=Fall |url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hmn/F07/feature1.cfm}}</ref> At present (2013), the syndrome is treated by simply addressing each issue as it arises and, in particular, preventive medication even for young children to slow progression of aortic dilation if such exists.

Marfan syndrome is passed on to offspring dominantly. This means a child with one parent a bearer of the gene has a 50% probability of getting the syndrome. However, as the gene causing Marfan syndrome is known, arduous genetic techniques are able to circumvent this. In 1996, the first [[preimplantation genetic testing]] therapy for Marfan was conducted,<ref name="PGT">{{cite journal |author=Harton GL, Tsipouras P, Sisson ME, ''et al.'' |title=Preimplantation genetic testing for Marfan syndrome |journal=Mol. Hum. Reprod. |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=713–5 |year=1996 |month=September |pmid=9239687 |url=http://molehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/9/713.long |doi=10.1093/molehr/2.9.713}}</ref> in essence PGT means conducting a genetic testing on early stage [[in vitro fertilization|IVF]] embryo cells and discarding those embryos affected by the Marfan mutation.

Regular checkups by a [[cardiologist]] are needed to monitor the health of the heart valves and the aorta. The goal of treatment is to slow the progression of aortic dilation and damage to heart valves by eliminating [[Cardiac arrhythmia|arrythmias]], minimizing the [[heart rate]], and minimizing [[blood pressure]].  [[Beta blocker]]s have been used to control arrythmias and slow the heart rate.  Other medications might be needed to further minimize blood pressure without slowing the heart rate, such as [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s.  If the dilation of the aorta progresses to a significant diameter [[aneurysm]], causes a dissection or a rupture, or leads to failure of the aortic or other valve, then surgery (possibly a [[Bentall procedure|composite aortic valve graft]] or [[valve-sparing aortic root replacement]]) becomes necessary.  Although aortic graft surgery (or any vascular surgery) is a serious undertaking it is generally successful if undertaken on an elective basis.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF6852573E1005A0BDC |title=Elective Aortic Root Surgery in Marfan Syndrome Appears Safe and Durable: Presented at STS|date=January 31, 2008 |publisher=Doctor's Guide|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}<br/>See also:

The skeletal and ocular manifestations of Marfan syndrome can also be serious, although not life-threatening. These symptoms are usually treated in the typical manner for the appropriate condition, such as with various kinds of pain medication or [[muscle relaxant]]s.  It is also common for patients to receive treatment from a physiotherapist, using [[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|TENS therapy]], [[ultrasound]] and skeletal adjustment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This can also affect height, arm length, and life span. A physiotherapist can also help improve function and prevent injuries in individuals with Marfan syndrome. The [[Nuss procedure]] is now being offered to people with Marfan syndrome to correct 'sunken chest' or ([[pectus excavatum]]).<ref name="chkd">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chkd.org/services/nussprocedure/Overview.aspx|title=Overview of the Nuss Procedure for Pectus Excavatum|accessdate=January 12, 2007|publisher=Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters}}</ref> Because Marfan syndrome may cause asymptomatic spinal abnormalities, any spinal surgery contemplated on a Marfan patient should only follow detailed imaging and careful surgical planning, regardless of the indication for surgery.

Treatment of a spontaneous [[pneumothorax]] is dependent on the volume of air in the pleural space and the natural progression of the individual's condition.  A small pneumothorax might resolve without active treatment in one to two weeks.  Recurrent pneumothoraces might require chest surgery.  Moderately sized pneumothoraces might need [[Chest tube|chest drain]] management for several days in a hospital.  Large pneumothoraces are likely to be medical emergencies requiring emergency decompression.
