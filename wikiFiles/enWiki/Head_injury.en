The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (number of new cases) of head injury is 300 of every 100,000 per year (0.3% of the population), with a mortality rate of 25 per 100,000 in [[North America]] and 9 per 100,000 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Head trauma is a common cause of childhood hospitalization.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Classification==
Head injuries include both injuries to the brain and those to other parts of the head, such as the [[scalp]] and [[human skull|skull]].

Head injuries can be closed or open. A closed (non-missile) head injury is where the [[dura mater]] remains intact. The skull can be fractured, but not necessarily. A [[penetrating head injury]] occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater. Brain injuries may be [[Focal and diffuse brain injury|diffuse]], occurring over a wide area, or focal, located in a small, specific area.  

A head injury may cause [[skull fracture]], which may or may not be associated with injury to the brain. Some patients may have linear or depressed skull fractures. 

If [[intracranial hemorrhage]] occurs, a [[hematoma]] within the skull can put pressure on the brain. Types of intracranial hemorrage include [[subdural hemorrhage|subdural]], [[subarachnoid hemorrhage|subarachnoid]], [[extradural hematoma|extradural]], and [[intraparenchymal hematoma]]. [[Craniotomy]] surgeries are used in these cases to lessen the pressure by draining off blood. 

[[Brain damage|Brain injury]] can be at the site of impact, but can also be at the opposite side of the skull due to a ''[[contrecoup]]'' effect (the impact to the head can cause the brain to move within the skull, causing the brain to impact the interior of the skull opposite the head-impact). 

If the impact causes the head to move, the injury may be worsened, because the brain may ricochet inside the skull causing additional impacts, or the brain may stay relatively still (due to inertia) but be hit by the moving skull (both are contrecoup injuries).

===Concussion===
{{main|Concussion}}

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an exchangeable word used for the word concussion. This term refers to a mild brain injury. This injury is a result due to a blow to the head that could make the person’s physical, cognitive, and emotional behaviors irregular.

Symptoms may include:
Clumsiness, Fatigue, Confusion, Nausea, Blurry Vision, Headaches, and others.

Mild concussions are associated with [[sequela]]e. Severity is measured using various [[concussion grading systems]]. 

A slightly greater injury is associated with both anterograde and retrograde [[amnesia]] (inability to remember events before or after the injury). The amount of time that the amnesia is present correlates with the severity of the injury. In all cases the patients  develop [[postconcussion syndrome]], which  includes memory problems, dizziness, tiredness, sickness and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].

Cerebral [[concussion]] is the most common head injury seen in children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Intracranial hemorrhage===
{{Main|Intracranial hemorrhage}}
Types of intracranial hemorrhage are roughly grouped into intra-axial and extra-axial.  The hemorrhage is considered a [[focal and diffuse brain injury|focal brain injury]]; that is, it occurs in a localized spot rather than causing diffuse damage over a wider area.

====Intra-axial hemorrhage====
{{Main|cerebral hemorrhage}}
Intra-axial hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain itself, or [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. This category includes [[intraparenchymal hemorrhage]], or bleeding within the brain tissue, and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]], bleeding within the brain's [[ventricular system|ventricle]]s (particularly of [[Premature birth|premature infants]]). Intra-axial hemorrhages are more dangerous and harder to treat than extra-axial bleeds.<ref name="Brant07">{{cite book |author= Seidenwurm DI |editor=Brant WE, Helms CA |chapter=Introduction to brain imaging |title=Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology |publisher=Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2007 |pages= 53 |isbn=0-7817-6135-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-11-17 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Sossht2t5XwC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=extra-axial+intra-axial}}</ref>

====Extra-axial hemorrhage====
{{Epidural vs. subdural hematoma}}
Extra-axial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs within the skull but outside of the brain tissue, falls into three subtypes:
*[[Epidural hemorrhage]] (extradural hemorrhage)  which occur between the [[dura mater]] (the outermost [[meninx]]) and the skull, is caused by trauma.  It may result from laceration of an artery, most commonly the [[middle meningeal artery]]. This is a very dangerous type of injury because the bleed is from a high-pressure system and deadly increases in [[intracranial pressure]] can result rapidly. However, it is the least common type of meningeal bleeding and is seen in 1% to 3% cases of head injury .
**Patients have a loss of consciousness (LOC), then a [[lucid interval]], then sudden deterioration (vomiting, restlessness, LOC)
**Head CT shows lenticular (convex) deformity.
*[[Subdural hemorrhage]] results from tearing of the bridging veins in the [[subdural space]] between the [[dura mater|dura]] and [[arachnoid mater]].
**Head CT shows crescent-shaped deformity
*[[Subarachnoid hemorrhage]], which occur between the arachnoid and [[pia mater|pia]] meningeal layers, like intraparenchymal hemorrhage, can result either from trauma or from ruptures of [[aneurysm]]s or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.  Blood is seen layering into the brain along [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] and [[fissure]]s, or filling [[Cistern (neuroanatomy)|cistern]]s (most often the [[suprasellar cistern]] because of the presence of the [[blood vessel|vessel]]s of the [[circle of Willis]] and their branchpoints within that space). The classic presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage is the sudden onset of a severe headache (a [[thunderclap headache]]). This can be a very dangerous entity, and requires emergent neurosurgical evaluation, and sometimes urgent intervention.

=== Cerebral contusion ===
{{main|Cerebral contusion}}
Cerebral contusion is bruising of the brain tissue. The majority of contusions occur in the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[temporal lobe]]s. Complications may include cerebral [[edema]] and transtentorial herniation. The goal of treatment should be to treat the increased [[intracranial pressure]]. The prognosis is guarded.

=== Diffuse axonal injury ===
{{main|Diffuse axonal injury}}
[[Diffuse axonal injury]], or DAI, usually occurs as the result of an [[acceleration]] or deceleration motion, not necessarily an impact. [[Axon]]s are stretched and damaged when parts of the brain of differing density slide over one another. Prognoses vary widely depending on the extent of damage.

==Signs and symptoms==
Presentation varies according to the injury. Some patients with head trauma stabilize and other patients deteriorate. A patient may present with or without [[neurologic deficit]]. 

Patients with concussion may have a history of seconds to minutes unconsciousness, then normal arousal. Disturbance of vision and equilibrium may also occur. 

Common symptoms of head injury include [[coma]], confusion, drowsiness, personality change, [[seizure]]s, [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[headache]] and a [[lucid interval]], during which a patient appears conscious only to deteriorate later.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.seattlechildrens.org/child_health_safety/health_advice/head_injury.asp | title = Head Injury: Description | publisher = Seattle Children's Hospital | accessdate = 2008-01-07 }}</ref>

Symptoms of skull fracture can include:
*leaking [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (a clear fluid drainage from [[human nose|nose]], [[mouth]] or [[ear]]) may be and is strongly indicative of [[basilar skull fracture]] and the tearing of sheaths surrounding the brain, which can lead to secondary brain [[infection]].
*visible deformity or depression in the head or face; for example a sunken eye can indicate a [[maxilla]]r fracture
*an eye that cannot move or is deviated to one side can indicate that a broken facial bone is pinching a [[nerve]] that innervates eye muscles
*[[wound]]s or bruises on the scalp or face.
*[[Basilar skull fracture]]s, those that occur at the base of the [[human skull|skull]], are associated with [[Battle's sign]], a [[subcutaneous]] bleed over the [[mastoid]], [[hemotympanum]], and [[cerebrospinal fluid]] [[rhinorrhea]] and [[otorrhea]].

Because brain injuries can be life threatening, even people with apparently slight injuries, with no noticeable signs or complaints, require close observation; They have a chance for severe symptoms later on. The caretakers of those patients with mild trauma who are released from the hospital are frequently advised to rouse the patient several times during the next 12 to 24 hours to assess for worsening symptoms.

The [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] is a tool for measuring degree of unconsciousness and is thus a useful tool for determining severity of injury. The [[Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale]] is used in young children.

==Causes==
Common causes of head injury are [[traffic collisions|motor vehicle traffic collisions]], home and occupational accidents, falls, and [[assault]]s. [[Wilson's disease]] has also been indicative of head injury.<ref name="NSKC">{{cite web | url=http://www.preventinjury.org/PDFs/BICYCLE_INJURY.pdf | title=Bicycle injury fact sheet| author=National Safe Kids Campaign (NSKC) | year=2004 | format = pdf | publisher=NSKC | accessdate=2006-12-19 }}</ref>

According to the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], 32% of [[traumatic brain injuries]] (another, more specific, term for head injuries) are caused by falls, 10% by assaults, 16.5% by being struck or against something, 17% by motor vehicle accidents, 21% by other/unknown ways. In addition, the highest rate of injury is among children ages 0&ndash;14 and adults age 65 and older.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shulman|first=Joshua|title=Traumatic Brain Injury Infographic |url=http://www.portlandpersonalinjuryaccidentlawyer.com/practice_areas/brain-injury/brain-injury-infographic/|publisher=Shulman DuBois LLC |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
{{see also|Head injury criterion}}''''''Bold text''''''
The need for imaging in patients who have suffered a minor head injury is debated. A non-contrast CT of the head should be performed immediately in all those who have suffered a moderate or severe head injury,an [[MRI]] is also an option.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG56NICEGuideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format=PDF |work=NHS |accessdate=December 12, 2008}}

Computed tomography (CT) has become the diagnostic modality of choice for head trauma due to its accuracy, reliability, safety, and wide availability. The changes in microcirculation, impaired auto-regulation, cerebral edema, and axonal injury start as soon as head injury occurs and manifest as clinical, biochemical, and radiological changes.</ref> http://www.jpmsonline.com/jpms-vol1-issue3-pages78-82-oa.html

==Management==
{{see also|Traumatic_brain_injury#Treatment}}
Most head injuries are of a benign nature and require no treatment beyond [[analgesics]] and close monitoring for potential complications such as [[intracranial bleeding]].  If the brain has been severely damaged by trauma, neurosurgical evaluation may be useful.  Treatments may involve controlling elevated intracranial pressure. This can include sedation, paralytics, cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Second line alternatives include decompressive craniectomy (Jagannathan et al. found a net 65% favorable outcomes rate in pediatric patients), barbiturate coma, hypertonic saline and hypothermia. Although all of these methods have potential benefits, there has been no randomized study that has shown unequivocal benefit.

==Prognosis==
In children with uncomplicated minor head injuries the risk of intra cranial bleeding over the next year is rare at 2 cases per 1 million.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hamilton M, Mrazik M, Johnson DW |title=Incidence of delayed intracranial hemorrhage in children after uncomplicated minor head injuries |journal=Pediatrics |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=e33–9 |year=2010 |month=July |pmid=20566618 |doi=10.1542/peds.2009-0692 |url=}}</ref>

In some cases transient neurological disturbances may occur, lasting minutes to hours. Malignant post traumatic cerebral swelling can develop unexpectedly in stable patients after an injury, as can post traumatic [[seizure]]s. Recovery in children with neurologic deficits will vary. Children with neurologic deficits who improve daily are more likely to recover, while those who are vegetative for months are less likely to improve. Most patients without deficits have full recovery. However, persons who sustain head trauma resulting in unconsciousness for an hour or more have twice the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease later in life.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Small | first=Gary W | title=What we need to know about age related memory loss | journal=British Medical Journal | pages=1502–1507 | date=2002-06-22 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/324/7352/1502#B21 | accessdate=2008-11-13 | pmid=12077041 | doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7352.1502 | volume=324 | issue=7352 | pmc=1123445 }}</ref>

Head injury may be associated with a neck injury. Bruises on the back or neck, neck pain, or pain radiating to the arms are signs of cervical spine injury and merit spinal immobilization via application of a [[cervical collar]] and possibly a long board. 

If the [[neurological exam]] is normal this is reassuring. Reassessment is needed if there is a worsening [[headache]], [[seizure]], one sided weakness, or has persistent vomiting.
