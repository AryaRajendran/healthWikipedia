The '''Glasgow-Blatchford''' bleeding score (GBS) is a [[Screening (medicine)|screening tool]] to assess the likelihood that a patient with an acute [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding]] (UGIB) will need to have medical intervention such as a [[blood transfusion]] or [[Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy|endoscopic]] intervention.<ref name="A risk score to predict need for treatment for uppergastrointestinal haemorrhage">{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)02816-6/abstract |title=A risk score to predict need for treatment for uppergastrointestinal haemorrhage|work= |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> A recent study published in the [[The Lancet|Lancet]] showed that the tool may be able to identify patients who do not need to be admitted to hospital after a UGIB. Advantages of the GBS over the [[Rockall score]], which assesses the risk of mortality in patients with UGIB, include a lack of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] variables such as the severity of systemic diseases and the lack of a need for [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]] (EGD) to complete the score, a feature unique to the GBS.

In a study  published in ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' on January 3, 2009, 16% of patients presenting with UGIB had a GBS score of "0", considered low. Among these patients there were no deaths or interventions needed and the patients were able to be effectively treated in an outpatient setting.<ref name="Outpatient management of patients with low-risk upper-gastrointestinal haemorrhage: multicentre validation and prospective evaluation

In the validation group, scores of 6 or more were associated with a greater than 50% risk of needing an intervention.

===Score===

Score is equal to "0" if the following are all present:

* [[Hemoglobin]] level >12.9 g/dL (men) or >11.9 g/dL (women)

* [[Systolic blood pressure]] >109&nbsp;mm Hg

* [[Pulse]] <100/minute

* Blood urea nitrogen level <18.2&nbsp;mg/dL

* No [[melena]] or [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]]

* No past or present [[liver disease]] or [[heart failure]]
