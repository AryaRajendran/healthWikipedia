In [[human geography]], '''McNeill's law''' is the process outlined in [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill's]] book ''Plagues and Peoples''.  The process described concerns the role of [[pathogens|microbial disease]] in the conquering of people-groups.<ref>{{cite book |title=Plagues and People |last= McNeill |first=William |isbn=978-1439503133 |page=340}}</ref>

According to McNeill's Law, the microbiological aspect of conquest and invasion has been the deciding principle or one of the deciding principles in both the expansion of certain [[empire]]s (as during the emigration to the Americas) and the containment in others (as during the [[crusades]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1008/features/a-germ-of-an-idea.shtml |title = A germ of an idea |author = Robert Goodier |date = 2010 |work = University of Chicago Magazine |accessdate = June 21st, 2012 }}</ref>

==Instances in history==
The first people-group fully [[genocide|wiped out]] due to [[Age of Exploration|European expansion]] (with the possible exception of the [[Arawaks]]) was the [[Guanches]] of the [[Canary Islands]].  Despite an inbred ferocity, superior knowledge of the land and even a possible tactical superiority, they were eventually wiped out through the concentrated efforts of the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]].  McNeill's Law would place the deciding factor squarely on the introduction of deadly diseases and parasites from the mainland to the previously geographically isolated islanders.  

This is the likely explanation, as what records still exist show numerous deaths by disease on the islands and a declining birth-rate, leading eventually to the almost complete end of the Guanches as a race.

Other instances include the devastation of the [[Incas]] by [[smallpox]].
