'''Heart failure''' ('''HF'''), often called '''congestive heart failure''' ('''CHF''') or '''congestive cardiac failure''' ('''CCF'''), occurs when the [[heart]] is unable to provide sufficient pump action to maintain [[blood flow]] to meet the needs of the body.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000047501|heart failure}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Heart failure |date=23 December 2009 |work=Health Information |id=DS00061 |publisher=Mayo Clinic |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/heart-failure/DS00061}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Definition of Heart failure |date=27 April 2011 |work=Medical Dictionary |publisher=MedicineNet |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3672}}</ref> Heart failure can cause a number of symptoms including [[shortness of breath]], [[peripheral edema|leg swelling]], and [[exercise intolerance]].

In a chronic patient already in a stable situation, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle measures such as [[smoking cessation]], light exercise, dietary changes, and medications. Sometimes, depending from etiology, it is treated with implanted devices ([[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] or [[ventricular assist device]]s) and occasionally a [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]] is required.

==Terminology==
Heart failure is a global term for the physiological state in which [[cardiac output]] is insufficient in meeting the needs of the body and lungs. Often termed "congestive heart failure" or CHF, this is most commonly caused when cardiac output is low and the body becomes congested with fluid due to an inability of heart output to properly match venous return.<ref name=dorlandsNine>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000953448|congestive heart failure}}</ref>

It may also occur in situations of high output, (termed "[[high output cardiac failure]]") where the ventricular systolic function is normal but the heart can't deal with an important augmentation of blood volume.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/000953450|high-output heart failure}}</ref> This can occur in overload situation (blood or serum infusions), renal diseases, chronic severe [[anemia]], [[beriberi]] (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>/thiamine deficiency), [[thyrotoxicosis]], [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[arteriovenous fistula]]e, or [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.

Fluid overload is a common problem for people with heart failure but is not synonymous with it.  Patients with treated heart failure will often be euvolaemic (a term for normal fluid status), or more rarely, [[dehydration|dehydrated]].

Medical professionals use the words "acute" to mean of rapid onset and "chronic" of long duration. Chronic heart failure is therefore a long term situation, usually with stable treated symptomatology.

[[Acute decompensated heart failure]] is exacerbated or decompensated heart failure, referring to episodes in which a patient can be characterized as having a change in heart failure signs and symptoms resulting in a need for urgent therapy or hospitalization.<ref name="Jessup2009">{{cite journal |author=Jessup M, Abraham WT, Casey DE, ''et al.'' |title=2009 focused update: ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Heart Failure in Adults: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines: developed in collaboration with the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation |journal=Circulation |volume=119 |issue=14 |pages=1977–2016 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19324967 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.192064 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19324967}}</ref>

There are several terms which are closely related to heart failure, and may be the cause of heart failure, but should not be confused with it:
*[[Cardiac arrest]] and [[asystole]] refer to situations in which there is ''no'' cardiac output at all. Without urgent treatment these result in sudden death.
*[[Myocardial infarction]] ("Heart attack") refers to heart muscle damage due to insufficient blood supply, usually as a result of a blocked [[coronary artery]].
*[[Cardiomyopathy]] refers specifically to problems within the heart muscle, and these problems can result in heart failure. Ischemic cardiomyopathy implies that the cause of muscle damage is [[coronary artery disease]]. [[Dilated cardiomyopathy]] implies that the muscle damage has resulted in enlargement of the heart. [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] involves enlargement and ''thickening'' of the heart muscle.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:Elevated JVP.JPG|thumb|A man with congestive heart failure and marked [[jugular venous distension]].  External jugular vein marked by an arrow.]]
Heart failure symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into "left" and "right" sided, recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the heart supply different portions of the circulation. However, heart failure is not exclusively ''backward failure'' (in the part of the circulation which drains to the ventricle).

There are several other exceptions to a simple left-right division of heart failure symptoms. Left sided ''forward'' failure overlaps with right sided ''backward'' failure. Additionally, the most common cause of right-sided heart failure is left-sided heart failure. The result is that patients commonly present with both sets of signs and symptoms.

===Left-sided failure===
Common respiratory signs are tachypnea (increased ''rate'' of breathing) and increased ''work'' of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). [[Rales]] or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the [[alveoli]]). [[Cyanosis]] which suggests severe hypoxemia, is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema.

Additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced [[apex beat]] (which occurs if the heart is enlarged) and a [[gallop rhythm]] (additional heart sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow, or increased intra-cardiac pressure. [[Heart murmur]]s may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease, either as a cause (e.g. [[aortic stenosis]]) or as a result (e.g. [[mitral regurgitation]]) of the heart failure.

''Backward'' failure of the left ventricle causes congestion of the pulmonary vasculature, and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature. Backward failure can be subdivided into failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The patient will have [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath) on exertion (''dyspnée d'effort'') and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called [[orthopnea]], occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, and in severe cases, the patient may resort to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]] a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy fatigueability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise.

"[[Cardiac asthma]]" or [[wheezing]] may occur.

Compromise of left ventricular ''forward'' function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as [[dizziness]], [[confusion]] and cool extremities at rest.

===Right-sided failure===
Physical examination may reveal pitting peripheral [[edema]], [[ascites]], and [[hepatomegaly]]. [[Jugular venous pressure]] is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status, which can be accentuated by eliciting [[Abdominojugular test|hepatojugular reflux]]. If the right ventricular pressure is increased, a [[parasternal heave]] may be present, signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength.

''Backward'' failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (termed [[peripheral edema]] or [[anasarca]]) and usually affects the dependent parts of the body first (causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up, and [[Sacrum|sacral]] edema in people who are predominantly lying down). [[Nocturia]] (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, [[ascites]] (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and [[hepatomegaly]] (enlargement of the [[liver]]) may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function, and jaundice and even [[coagulopathy]] (problems of decreased blood clotting) may occur.

===Biventricular failure===
Dullness of the lung fields to finger percussion and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a [[pleural effusion]] (fluid collection in between the lung and the chest wall). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided heart failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain both into the systemic and pulmonary venous system. When unilateral, effusions are often right sided.

==Causes==
===Congestive heart failure===
The predominance of causes of heart failure are difficult to analyze due to challenges in diagnosis, differences in populations, and changing prevalence of causes with age.

A 19 year study of 13000 initially healthy adults ("A total of 13 643 men and women without a history of CHF at baseline examination were included in this prospective cohort study") in the United States (the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] (NHANES I) found the following causes ranked by Population Attributable Risk score:<ref>{{cite journal |author=He J; Ogden LG; Bazzano LA; Vupputuri S, ''et al.'' |title=Risk factors for congestive heart failure in US men and women: NHANES I epidemiologic follow-up study|journal=Arch.

*Pharmaceutical drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents

==Pathophysiology==
{{Ref improve section|date=September 2010}}

Heart failure is caused by any condition which reduces the efficiency of the myocardium, or heart muscle, through damage or overloading. As such, it can be caused by a diverse array of conditions, including myocardial infarction (in which the heart muscle is starved of oxygen and dies), hypertension (which increases the force of contraction needed to pump blood) and [[amyloidosis]] (in which protein is deposited in the heart muscle, causing it to stiffen). Over time these increases in workload will produce changes to the heart itself:
* Reduced force of contraction, due to overloading of the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. In a  healthy heart, increased filling of the ventricle results in increased force of contraction (by the [[Frank–Starling law of the heart]]) and thus a rise in cardiac output. In heart failure this mechanism fails, as the ventricle is loaded with blood to the point where heart muscle contraction becomes less efficient. This is due to reduced ability to cross-link [[actin]] and [[myosin]] filaments in over-stretched heart muscle.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Walter F. |last1=Boron |first2=Emile L. |last2=Boulpaep |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular and Molecular Approach |publisher=Saunders |edition=Updated |year=2005  |isbn=0-7216-3256-4 |page=533 }}</ref>
* A reduced stroke volume, as a result of a failure of [[systole (medicine)|systole]], [[diastole]] or both. Increased [[end systolic volume]] is usually caused by reduced contractility. Decreased [[end diastolic volume]] results from impaired ventricular filling – as occurs when the compliance of the ventricle falls (i.e. when the walls stiffen).
* Reduced spare capacity. As the heart works harder to meet normal metabolic demands, the amount cardiac output can increase in times of increased oxygen demand (e.g. exercise) is reduced. This contributes to the exercise intolerance commonly seen in heart failure. This translates to the loss of one's cardiac reserve, or the ability of the heart to work harder during strenuous physical activity. Since the heart has to work harder to meet the normal metabolic demands, it is incapable of meeting the metabolic demands of the body during exercise.
* Increased heart rate, stimulated by increased sympathetic activity<ref>{{cite book |author=Rang HP |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |pages=127 |isbn=0-443-07145-4}}</ref> in order to maintain cardiac output. Initially, this helps compensate for heart failure by maintaining blood pressure and perfusion, but places further strain on the myocardium, increasing coronary perfusion requirements, which can lead to worsening of ischemic heart disease. Sympathetic activity may also cause potentially fatal [[arrhythmias]].
* [[Hypertrophy]] (an increase in physical size) of the myocardium, caused by the terminally differentiated heart muscle fibres increasing in size in an attempt to improve contractility. This may contribute to the increased stiffness and decreased ability to relax during diastole.
* Enlargement of the ventricles, contributing to the enlargement and spherical shape of the failing heart. The increase in ventricular volume also causes a reduction in stroke volume due to mechanical and contractile inefficiency.<ref>{{GPnotebook|617611316|cardiac pathophysiology in heart failure}}</ref>

The general effect is one of reduced cardiac output and increased strain on the heart. This increases the risk of cardiac arrest (specifically due to ventricular dysrhythmias), and reduces blood supply to the rest of the body. In chronic disease the reduced cardiac output causes a number of changes in the rest of the body, some of which are physiological compensations, some of which are part of the disease process:
* Arterial blood pressure falls. This destimulates [[baroreceptors]] in the [[carotid sinus]] and [[aortic arch]] which link to the nucleus tractus solitarius. This center in the brain increases sympathetic activity, releasing catecholamines into the blood stream. Binding to alpha-1 receptors results in systemic arterial [[vasoconstriction]]. This helps restore blood pressure but also increases the total peripheral resistance, increasing the workload of the heart. Binding to beta-1 receptors in the myocardium increases the heart rate and make contractions more forceful, in an attempt to increase cardiac output. This also, however, increases the amount of work the heart has to perform.
* Increased sympathetic stimulation also causes the [[hypothalamus]] to secrete [[vasopressin]] (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH), which causes fluid retention at the kidneys. This increases the blood volume and blood pressure.
* Reduced [[perfusion]] (blood flow) to the kidneys stimulates the release of [[renin]] – an enzyme which catalyses the production of the potent vasopressor [[angiotensin]]. Angiotensin and its metabolites cause further vasoconstriction, and stimulate increased secretion of the steroid [[aldosterone]] from the [[adrenal glands]]. This promotes salt and fluid retention at the kidneys.
* The chronically high levels of circulating neuroendocrine hormones such as [[catecholamines]], renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone affects the myocardium directly, causing structural remodelling of the heart over the long term. Many of these remodelling effects seem to be mediated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which is a common downstream target of the signal transduction cascade. initiated by catecholamines<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shigeyama J, Yasumura Y, Sakamoto A, ''et al.'' |title=Increased gene expression of collagen Types I and III is inhibited by beta-receptor blockade in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy |journal=Eur.

* Reduced perfusion of skeletal muscle causes atrophy of the muscle fibres. This can result in weakness, increased fatigueability and decreased peak strength - all contributing to exercise intolerance.<ref>{{GPnotebook|919601204|systemic pathophysiology in heart failure}}</ref>

The increased peripheral resistance and greater blood volume place further strain on the heart and accelerates the process of damage to the myocardium. Vasoconstriction and fluid retention produce an increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries. This shifts the balance of forces in favour of [[interstitial fluid]] formation as the increased pressure forces additional fluid out of the blood, into the tissue. This results in [[edema]] (fluid build-up) in the tissues. In right-sided heart failure this commonly starts in the ankles where venous pressure is high due to the effects of gravity (although if the patient is bed-ridden, fluid accumulation may begin in the sacral region.) It may also occur in the abdominal cavity, where the fluid build-up is called ascites. In left-sided heart failure [[edema]] can occur in the lungs — this is called cardiogenic [[pulmonary edema]]. This reduces spare capacity for ventilation, causes stiffening of the lungs and reduces the efficiency of gas exchange by increasing the distance between the air and the blood. The consequences of this are [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), [[orthopnea]] and [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]].

The symptoms of heart failure are largely determined by which side of the heart fails. The left side pumps blood into the systemic circulation, whilst the right side pumps blood into the [[pulmonary circulation]]. Whilst left-sided heart failure will reduce cardiac output to the systemic circulation, the initial symptoms often manifest due to effects on the pulmonary circulation. In systolic dysfunction, the ejection fraction is decreased, leaving an abnormally elevated volume of blood in the left ventricle. In diastolic dysfunction, end-diastolic ventricular pressure will be high. This increase in volume or pressure backs up to the left atrium and then to the pulmonary veins. Increased volume or pressure in the pulmonary veins impairs the normal drainage of the alveoli and favors the flow of fluid from the capillaries to the lung parenchyma, causing pulmonary edema. This impairs gas exchange. Thus, left-sided heart failure often presents with respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

In severe cardiomyopathy, the effects of decreased cardiac output and poor perfusion become more apparent, and patients will manifest with cold and clammy extremities, cyanosis, claudication, generalized weakness, dizziness, and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].

The resultant hypoxia caused by pulmonary edema causes vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation, which results in pulmonary hypertension. Since the right ventricle generates far lower pressures than the left ventricle (approximately 20 mmHg versus around 120 mmHg, respectively, in the healthy individual) but nonetheless generates cardiac output exactly equal to the left ventricle, this means that a small increase in pulmonary vascular resistance causes a large increase in amount of work the right ventricle must perform. However, the main mechanism by which left-sided heart failure causes right-sided heart failure is actually not well understood. Some theories invoke mechanisms that are mediated by neurohormonal activation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hunter JG, Boon NA, Davidson S, Colledge NR, Walker B |title=Davidson's principles & practice of medicine |publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone |year=2006 |page=544  |isbn=0-443-10057-8}}</ref> Mechanical effects may also contribute. As the left ventricle distends, the intraventricular septum bows into the right ventricle, decreasing the capacity of the right ventricle.

===Systolic dysfunction===
Heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is more readily recognized. It can be simplistically described as failure of the pump function of the heart. It is characterized by a decreased ejection fraction (less than 45%). The strength of ventricular contraction is attenuated and inadequate for creating an adequate stroke volume, resulting in inadequate cardiac output. In general, this is caused by dysfunction or destruction of cardiac myocytes or their molecular components. In congenital diseases such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], the molecular structure of individual myocytes is affected. Myocytes and their components can be damaged by inflammation (such as in [[myocarditis]]) or by infiltration (such as in amyloidosis). Toxins and pharmacological agents (such as [[ethanol]], [[cocaine]], [[doxorubicin]], and [[amphetamines]]) cause intracellular damage and oxidative stress. The most common mechanism of damage is ischemia causing infarction and [[Myocardial scarring|scar formation]]. After myocardial infarction, dead myocytes are replaced by scar tissue, deleteriously affecting the function of the myocardium. On echocardiogram, this is manifest by abnormal wall motion (hypokinesia) or absent wall motion (akinesia).

Because the ventricle is inadequately emptied, ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volumes increase. This is transmitted to the atrium. On the left side of the heart, the increased pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature, and the resultant hydrostatic pressure favors extravassation of fluid into the lung parenchyma, causing pulmonary edema. On the right side of the heart, the increased pressure is transmitted to the systemic venous circulation and systemic capillary beds, favoring extravassation of fluid into the tissues of target organs and extremities, resulting in dependent [[peripheral edema]].

===Diastolic dysfunction===
Heart failure caused by diastolic dysfunction is generally described as the failure of the ventricle to adequately relax and typically denotes a stiffer ventricular wall. This causes inadequate filling of the ventricle, and therefore results in an inadequate stroke volume. The failure of ventricular relaxation also results in elevated end-diastolic pressures, and the end result is identical to the case of systolic dysfunction (pulmonary edema in left heart failure, peripheral edema in right heart failure.)

Diastolic dysfunction can be caused by processes similar to those that cause systolic dysfunction, particularly causes that affect cardiac remodeling.

Diastolic dysfunction may not manifest itself except in physiologic extremes if systolic function is preserved. The patient may be completely asymptomatic at rest. However, they are exquisitely sensitive to increases in heart rate, and sudden bouts of tachycardia (which can be caused simply by physiological responses to exertion, fever, or dehydration, or by pathological tachyarrhythmias such as [[atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response]]) may result in [[flash pulmonary edema]]. Adequate rate control (usually with a pharmacological agent that slows down AV conduction such as a calcium channel blocker or a beta-blocker) is therefore key to preventing decompensation.

Left ventricular diastolic function can be determined through echocardiography by measurement of various parameters such as the [[E/A ratio]] (early-to-atrial left ventricular filling ratio), the E (early left ventricular filling) deceleration time, and the [[isovolumic relaxation time]].

===Imaging===
[[Echocardiography]] is commonly used to support a clinical diagnosis of heart failure. This modality uses [[ultrasound]] to determine the [[stroke volume]] (SV, the amount of blood in the heart that exits the ventricles with each beat), the [[end-diastolic volume]] (EDV, the total amount of blood at the end of diastole), and the SV in proportion to the EDV, a value known as the ''[[ejection fraction]]'' (EF). In pediatrics, the [[shortening fraction]] is the preferred measure of systolic function. Normally, the EF should be between 50% and 70%; in systolic heart failure, it drops below 40%. Echocardiography can also identify valvular heart disease and assess the state of the [[pericardium]] (the connective tissue sac surrounding the heart). Echocardiography may also aid in deciding what treatments will help the patient, such as medication, insertion of an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] or [[cardiac resynchronization therapy]]. Echocardiography can also help determine if acute myocardial ischemia is the precipitating cause, and may manifest as regional wall motion abnormalities on echo.

[[Chest X-ray]]s are frequently used to aid in the diagnosis of CHF. In the compensated patient, this may show [[cardiomegaly]] (visible enlargement of the heart), quantified as the ''cardiothoracic ratio'' (proportion of the heart size to the chest). In left ventricular failure, there may be evidence of vascular redistribution ("upper lobe blood diversion" or "cephalization"), [[Kerley lines]], [[peribronchial cuffing|cuffing of the areas around]] the [[bronchi]], and interstitial edema.

===Electrophysiology===
An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG/EKG) may be used to identify arrhythmias, [[ischemic heart disease]], [[Right ventricular hypertrophy|right]] and [[left ventricular hypertrophy]], and presence of conduction delay or abnormalities (e.g. [[left bundle branch block]]). Although these findings are not specific to the diagnosis of heart failure a normal ECG virtually excludes left ventricular systolic dysfunction.<ref>{{cite book |author=Loscalzo, Joseph; Fauci, Anthony S.; Braunwald, Eugene; Dennis L. Kasper; Hauser, Stephen L; Longo, Dan L. |title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |edition=17 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |year=2008 |pages=1447 |isbn=978-0-07-147693-5 }}</ref>

===Blood tests===
[[Blood test]]s routinely performed include [[electrolyte]]s ([[sodium]], [[potassium]]), measures of [[renal function]], [[liver function tests]], [[thyroid function test]]s, a [[complete blood count]], and often [[C-reactive protein]] if infection is suspected. An elevated [[Brain natriuretic peptide|B-type natriuretic peptide]] (BNP) is a specific test indicative of heart failure. Additionally, BNP can be used to differentiate between causes of dyspnea due to heart failure from other causes of dyspnea. If myocardial infarction is suspected, various [[cardiac marker]]s may be used.

According to a [[meta-analysis]] comparing BNP and N-terminal pro-BNP (NTproBNP) in the diagnosis of heart failure, BNP is a better indicator for heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  In groups of symptomatic patients, a diagnostic [[odds ratio]] of 27 for BNP compares with a [[Sensitivity and specificity#Sensitivity|sensitivity]] of 85% and [[Sensitivity and specificity#Specificity|specificity]] of 84% in detecting heart failure.<ref name="pmid18290826">{{cite journal |author=Ewald B, Ewald D, Thakkinstian A, Attia J |title=Meta-analysis of B type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro B natriuretic peptide in the diagnosis of clinical heart failure and population screening for left ventricular systolic dysfunction |journal=Intern Med J |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=101–13 |year=2008 |pmid=18290826 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-5994.2007.01454.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1445-5994.2007.01454.x}}</ref>

===Angiography===
Heart failure may be the result of coronary artery disease, and its prognosis depends in part on the ability of the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] to supply blood to the [[myocardium]] (heart muscle). As a result, [[coronary catheterization]] may be used to identify possibilities for revascularisation through [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] or [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

===Monitoring===
Various measures are often used to assess the progress of patients being treated for heart failure. These include [[fluid balance]] (calculation of fluid intake and excretion), monitoring [[body weight]] (which in the shorter term reflects fluid shifts).

===Classification===
There are many different ways to categorize heart failure, including:
* the side of the heart involved (left heart failure versus right heart failure). Right heart failure compromises pulmonary flow to the lungs. Left heart failure compromises aortic flow to the body and brain. Mixed presentations are common; left heart failure often leads to right heart failure in the longer term.
* whether the abnormality is due to insufficient [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] ([[systolic dysfunction]]), or due to insufficient relaxation of the heart ([[diastolic dysfunction]]), or to both.
* whether the problem is primarily increased venous back pressure ([[Preload_(cardiology)|preload]]), or failure to supply adequate arterial perfusion ([[afterload]]).
* whether the abnormality is due to low cardiac output with high [[systemic vascular resistance]] or high cardiac output with low vascular resistance (low-output heart failure vs. high-output heart failure).
* the degree of functional impairment conferred by the abnormality (as reflected in the [[New York Heart Association Functional Classification]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Criteria Committee, New York Heart Association |title=Diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Nomenclature and criteria for diagnosis |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1964 |page=114 |edition=6th}}</ref>)
* the degree of coexisting illness: i.e. heart failure/systemic hypertension, heart failure/pulmonary hypertension, heart failure/diabetes, heart failure/renal failure, etc.
''Functional'' classification generally relies on the New York Heart Association functional classification. The classes (I-IV) are:
* Class I: no limitation is experienced in any activities; there are no symptoms from ordinary activities.
* Class II: slight, mild limitation of activity; the patient is comfortable at rest or with mild exertion.
* Class III: marked limitation of any activity; the patient is comfortable only at rest.
* Class IV: any physical activity brings on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest.
This score documents severity of symptoms, and can be used to assess response to treatment. While its use is widespread, the NYHA score is not very reproducible and doesn't reliably predict the walking distance or exercise tolerance on formal testing.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Raphael C, Briscoe C, Davies J, ''et al.'' |title=Limitations of the New York Heart Association functional classification system and self‐reported walking distances in chronic heart failure |journal=Heart|volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=476–82 |year=2007 |pmid=17005715 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2006.089656 |pmc=1861501}}</ref>

In its 2001 guidelines the [[American College of Cardiology]]/[[American Heart Association]] working group introduced four stages of heart failure:<ref name="Hunt-2005">{{cite journal |author=Hunt SA, Abraham WT, Chin MH, ''et al.''|title=ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult|journal=Circulation |volume=112 |issue=12 |pages=e154–235 |year=2005 |pmid=16160202|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.167586 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/112/12/e154.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>
* Stage A: Patients at high risk for developing HF in the future but no functional or structural heart disorder.
* Stage B: a structural heart disorder but no symptoms at any stage.
* Stage C: previous or current symptoms of heart failure in the context of an underlying structural heart problem, but managed with medical treatment.
* Stage D: advanced disease requiring hospital-based support, a heart transplant or [[palliative care]].

The ACC staging system is useful in that Stage A encompasses "pre-heart failure" — a stage where intervention with treatment can presumably prevent progression to overt symptoms. ACC Stage A does not have a corresponding NYHA class. ACC Stage B would correspond to NYHA Class I. ACC Stage C corresponds to NYHA Class II and III, while ACC Stage D overlaps with NYHA Class IV.

===Algorithms===
There are various [[algorithm]]s for the diagnosis of heart failure. For example, the algorithm used by the [[Framingham Heart Study]] adds together criteria mainly from physical examination. In contrast, the more extensive algorithm by the [[European Society of Cardiology]] (ESC) weights the difference between supporting and opposing parameters from the [[medical history]], [[physical examination]], further medical tests as well as response to therapy.

====Framingham criteria====
By the Framingham criteria, diagnosis of congestive heart failure (heart failure with impaired pumping capability)<ref name=dorlandsNine/> requires the simultaneous presence of at least 2 of the following major criteria or 1 major criterion in conjunction with 2 of the following minor criteria:

Major criteria:<ref name=medicalcriteria>{{cite web |title=Framingham Criteria for Congestive Heart Failure |date=2005 |publisher=MedicalCRITERIA.com |url=http://www.medicalcriteria.com/criteria/framingham.htm}} In turn citing: {{harvnb|Framingham study|1971}}</ref>
*[[Cardiomegaly]] on [[chest radiography]]
*S3 gallop (a [[third heart sound]])
*[[Acute pulmonary edema]]
*[[Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]]
*[[Crackles]] on lung [[auscultation]]
*[[Central venous pressure]] of more than 16&nbsp;cm {{chem|H|2|O}} at the right atrium
*[[Jugular vein distension]]
*Positive [[abdominojugular test]]
*[[Weight loss]] of more than 4.5&nbsp;kg in 5 days in response to treatment (sometimes classified as a minor criterium<ref>[http://www.amc.edu/amr/archives/200201/review01.html Topic Review - Heart Failure] By Osama Gusbi, MD. Albany Medical Review - January 2002</ref>)

Minor criteria:<ref name=medicalcriteria/>
*[[Tachycardia]] of more than 120 beats per minute
*[[Nocturnal cough]]
*[[Dyspnea]] on ordinary exertion
*[[Pleural effusion]]
*Decrease in [[vital capacity]] by one third from maximum recorded
*[[Hepatomegaly]]
*Bilateral [[ankle edema]]

Minor criteria are acceptable only if they can not be attributed to another medical condition such as pulmonary hypertension, chronic lung disease, cirrhosis, ascites, or the nephrotic syndrome.<ref name=medicalcriteria/> The Framingham Heart Study criteria are 100% sensitive and 78% specific for identifying persons with definite congestive heart failure.<ref name=medicalcriteria/>

==Management==
{{main|Management of heart failure}}
Treatment focuses on improving the symptoms and preventing the progression of the disease.  Reversible causes of the heart failure also need to be addressed (e.g. [[infection]], [[alcohol]] ingestion, anemia, [[thyrotoxicosis]], [[arrhythmia]], hypertension). Treatments include lifestyle and pharmacological modalities.

===Acute decompensation===
{{main|Acute decompensated heart failure}}
In [[acute decompensated heart failure]] (ADHF), the immediate goal is to re-establish adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to end organs. This entails ensuring that [[ABC (medicine)|airway, breathing, and circulation]] are adequate.  Immediated treatments usually involve some combination of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, diuretics such as furosemide, and possibly [[non invasive positive pressure ventilation]] (NIPPV).

===Chronic management===
The goal is to prevent the development of acute decompensated heart failure, to counteract the deleterious effects of cardiac remodeling, and to minimize the symptoms that the patient suffers. First-line therapy for all heart failure patients is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.  [[ACE inhibitor]]s (i.e., [[enalapril]], [[captopril]], [[lisinopril]], [[ramipril]]) improve survival and quality of life in heart failure patients, and have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction in numerous randomized trials.<ref name="CONSENSUS">{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM198706043162301|author=The CONSENSUS Trial Study Group. |title=Effects of enalapril on mortality in severe congestive heart failure. Results of the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS) |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=316 |pages=1429–35 |year=1987 |pmid=2883575|issue=23 }}</ref><ref name="SOLVD">{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM199108013250501|author=The SOLVD Investigators. |title=Effect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and congestive heart failure |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=325 |pages=293–302 |year=1991 |pmid=2057034|issue=5 }}</ref>  In addition to pharmacologic agents (oral loop diuretics, [[beta-blockers]], ACE inhibitors or [[angiotensin]] receptor blockers, vasodilators, and in severe cardiomyopathy [[Aldosterone antagonist|aldosterone receptor antagonists]]), behavioral modification should be pursued, specifically with regard to dietary guidelines regarding fluid intake. Exercise should be encouraged as tolerated, as sufficient conditioning can significantly improve quality-of-life. A [[low salt diet]] appears to increase the risk of death in those with systolic dysfunction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dinicolantonio|first=JJ|coauthors=Pasquale, PD; Taylor, RS; Hackam, DG|title=Low sodium versus normal sodium diets in systolic heart failure: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Heart (British Cardiac Society)|date=2013 Jan 24|pmid=22914535}}</ref>

[[Anemia]] is an independent factor in mortality in people with chronic heart failure; it may also impact on quality of life.<ref name=He2009>{{cite journal |author=He SW, Wang LX |title=The impact of anemia on the prognosis of chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis and systemic review |journal=Congest Heart Fail |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=123–30 |year=2009 |pmid=19522961 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-7133.2008.00030.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-7133.2008.00030.x/full}}</ref> Treatment of anaemia improves quality of life and decreases mortality rates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peraira-Moral J. Roberto, Núñez-Gil Ivan J. |title=Anaemia in heart failure: intravenous iron therapy |journal=e-journal of the ESC Council for Cardiology Practice |volume=10 |issue=16 |year=19 January 2012 |url=http://www.escardio.org/communities/councils/ccp/e-journal/volume10/Pages/anemia-in-heart-failure-intravenous-iron-therapy-Peraira-Moral-J-Roberto-Nunez-Gil-Ivan-J.aspx}}</ref>

In patients with severe cardiomyopathy, implantation of an [[Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator]] (AICD) should be considered. A select population will also probably benefit from [[Artificial_pacemaker#Biventricular pacing .28BVP.29|ventricular resynchronization]].

In select cases, [[cardiac transplantation]] can be considered. While this may resolve the problems associated with heart failure, the patient generally must remain on an immunosuppressive regimen to prevent rejection, which has its own significant downsides.

===Palliative care===
Patients with CHF often have significant symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pain. Both palliative care and cardiology are trying to get palliative care involved earlier in the course of patients with heart failure, and some would argue any patient with NYHA class III CHF should have a palliative care referral. Palliative care can not only provide symptom management, but also assist with advanced care planning, goals of care in the case of a significant decline, and making sure the patient has a medical [[power of attorney]] and discussed his or her wishes with this individual.

===Hospice===
Without transplantation, heart failure may not be reversible and cardiac function typically deteriorates with time.  The growing number of patients with Stage IV heart failure (intractable symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain at rest despite optimal medical therapy) should be considered for palliative care or hospice, according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis in heart failure can be assessed in multiple ways including clinical prediction rules and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Clinical prediction rules use a composite of clinical factors such as lab tests and blood pressure to estimate prognosis. Among several [[clinical prediction rule]]s for prognosing acute heart failure, the 'EFFECT rule' slightly outperformed other rules in  stratifying patients and identifying those at low risk of death during hospitalization or within 30 days.<ref name="pmid17449141">{{cite journal |author=Auble TE, Hsieh M, McCausland JB, Yealy DM |title=Comparison of four clinical prediction rules for estimating risk in heart failure |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=127–35, 135.e1–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17449141 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2007.02.017}}</ref> Easy methods for identifying low risk patients are:
* ADHERE Tree rule indicates that patients with [[blood urea nitrogen]] < 43&nbsp;mg/dl and [[systolic blood pressure]] at least 115&nbsp;mm Hg have less than 10% chance of inpatient death or complications.
* BWH rule indicates that patients with systolic blood pressure over 90&nbsp;mm Hg, respiratory rate of 30 or less breaths per minute, serum sodium over 135&nbsp;mmol/L, no new ST-T wave changes have less than 10% chance of inpatient death or complications.

A very important method for assessing prognosis in advanced heart failure patients is cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX testing). CPX testing is usually required prior to heart transplantation as an indicator of prognosis. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing involves measurement of exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide during exercise. The peak oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is used as an indicator of prognosis. As a general rule, a VO2 max less than 12–14 cc/kg/min indicates a poor survival and suggests that the patient may be a candidate for a heart transplant. Patients with a VO2 max<10 cc/kg/min have clearly poorer prognosis. The most recent International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mehra MR, Kobashigawa J, Starling R, ''et al.'' |title=Listing criteria for heart transplantation: International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the care of cardiac transplant candidates–2006 |journal=J. Heart Lung Transplant. |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=1024–42 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16962464 |doi=10.1016/j.healun.2006.06.008 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053-2498(06)00460-8}}</ref> also suggest two other parameters that can be used for evaluation of prognosis in advanced heart failure, the heart failure survival score and the use of a criterion of VE/VCO2 slope > 35 from the CPX test. The heart failure survival score is a score calculated using a combination of clinical predictors and the VO2 max from the cardiopulmonary exercise test.

==Epidemiology==
Mostly as a result of the costs of hospitalization, it is associated with a high health expenditure; costs have been estimated to amount to 2% of the total budget of the [[National Health Service]] in the United Kingdom, and more than $35 billion in the United States.<ref name="pmid12034163">{{cite journal |author=Stewart S, Jenkins A, Buchan S, McGuire A, Capewell S, McMurray JJ |title=The current cost of heart failure to the National Health Service in the UK |journal=Eur.

In developing countries, two to three percent of the population suffers from heart failure, but in those 70 to 80 years old, it occurs in 20—30 percent.

Heart failure affects close to 5 million people in the USA and each year close to 500,000 new cases are diagnosed. What is of more concern is that more than 50% of patients seek re-admission within 6 months after treatment and the average duration of hospital stay is 6 days.

In tropical countries, the most common cause of HF is [[valvular heart disease]] or some type of [[cardiomyopathy]]. As underdeveloped countries have become more affluent, there has also been an increase in the incidence of [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]] and [[obesity]], which have in turn raised the incidence of heart failure.

In the USA, HF is much higher in African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans and recent immigrants from the eastern bloc countries like Russia. This high prevalence in these ethnic minority populations has been linked to high incidence of diabetes and hypertension. In many new immigrants to the USA the high prevalence of heart failure has largely been attributed to lack of [[preventive health care]] or substandard treatment.<ref name="Heart Failure Information">[http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/heart-failure/3 Heart Failure Information], Retrieved on 2010-01-21.</ref>

===Sex===
Men have a higher incidence of heart failure, but the overall prevalence rate is similar in both sexes, since women survive longer after the onset of heart failure.<ref name=Stromberg>{{cite journal|author=Strömberg A, Mårtensson J.|title=Gender differences in patients with heart failure|journal=Eur.
