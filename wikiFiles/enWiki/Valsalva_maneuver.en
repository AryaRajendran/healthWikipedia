The '''Valsalva maneuver''' or '''Valsalva manoeuvre''' is performed by moderately forceful  attempted [[exhalation]] against a closed [[airway]], usually done by closing one's mouth, pinching one's nose shut while pressing out as if blowing up a balloon. Variations of the maneuver can be used either in [[medicine|medical]] examination as a test of cardiac function and [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic nervous]] control of the [[heart]], or to "clear" the [[ear]]s and [[Aerosinusitis|sinuses]] (that is, to equalize pressure between them) when ambient pressure changes, as in [[Scuba diving|diving]], [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], or [[aviation]].

The technique is named after [[Antonio Maria Valsalva]],<ref>{{whonamedit|synd|2316}}</ref> a 17th-century physician and anatomist from [[Bologna]] whose principal scientific interest was the human ear. He described the [[Eustachian tube]] and the maneuver to test its patency (openness). He also described the use of this maneuver to expel [[pus]] from the middle ear.

A modified version is done by expiring against a closed [[glottis]]. This will elicit the cardiovascular responses described below but will not force air into the Eustachian tubes. 

==Physiological response==
[[File:valsalva3.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Blood pressure (systolic) and pulse rate during a normal response to Valsalva’s maneuver. Forty millimeter mercury pressure is applied at 5 seconds and relieved at 20 seconds.]]

The normal physiological response consists of four phases.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8900980 |year=1996 |last1=Luster |first1=EA |last2=Baumgartner |first2=N |last3=Adams |first3=WC |last4=Convertino |first4=VA |title=Effects of hypovolemia and posture on responses to the Valsalva maneuver |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=308–13 |journal=[[Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine]]}}</ref>
# Initial pressure rise
#: On application of expiratory force, pressure rises inside the chest forcing blood out of the [[pulmonary circulation]] into the [[left atrium]]. This causes a mild rise in [[stroke volume]].
# Reduced venous return and compensation
#: Return of systemic blood to the heart is impeded by the pressure inside the chest. The output of the heart is reduced and stroke volume falls. This occurs from 5 to about 14 seconds in the illustration. The fall in stroke volume reflexively causes blood vessels to constrict with some rise in pressure (15 to 20 seconds). This compensation can be quite marked with pressure returning to near or even above normal, but the [[cardiac output]] and blood flow to the body remains low. During this time the pulse rate increases (compensatory tachycardia).
# Pressure release
#: The pressure on the chest is released, allowing the pulmonary vessels and the [[aorta]] to re-expand causing a further initial slight fall in stroke volume (20 to 23 seconds) due to decreased [[left ventricular]] return and increased aortic volume, respectively.  Venous blood can once more enter the chest and the heart, cardiac output begins to increase.
# Return of cardiac output
#: Blood return to the heart is enhanced by the effect of entry of blood which had been dammed back, causing a rapid increase in cardiac output (24 seconds on). The stroke volume usually rises above normal before returning to a normal level. With return of blood pressure, the pulse rate returns towards normal.

Deviation from this response pattern signifies either abnormal heart function or abnormal [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic nervous control]] of the heart.
Valsalva is also used by dentists following extraction of a [[maxillary molar]] tooth.  The maneuver is performed to determine if a [[wikt:perforation|perforation]] or [[antral communication]] exists.

==Normalizing middle-ear pressures==
When rapid ambient pressure increase occurs as in diving or aircraft descent, this pressure tends to hold the [[Eustachian tubes]] closed, preventing pressure equalization across the ear drum, with painful results.<ref name=Brubakk>{{cite book |title=Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving, 5th Rev ed. |last=Brubakk |first=A.

If this fails, then the Valsalva maneuver may be used. It should be noted this maneuver, when used as a tool to equalize middle ear pressure, carries with it the risk of auditory damage from over pressurization of the middle ear.<ref name=kay/><ref name=roydhouse>{{cite journal |author=Roydhouse, N |title=The squeeze, the ear and prevention |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1978 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6169 |accessdate=2008-06-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=D |title=The Valsalva Manoeuvre: A critical review |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1996 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6264 |accessdate=2008-06-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Roydhouse, N and Taylor, D |title=The Valsalva Manoeuvre.

The effectiveness of the "yawning" method can be improved with practice; some people are able to achieve release or opening by moving their [[jaw]] forward or forward and down, rather than straight down as in a classical yawn.<ref name=kay/>  Opening can often be clearly heard by the practitioner, thus providing feedback that the maneuver was successful. 

During swallowing or yawning, several muscles in the pharynx (throat) act to elevate the soft palate and open the throat. One of these muscles, the [[tensor veli palatini]], also acts to open the eustachian tube. This is why swallowing or yawning is successful in equalizing middle ear pressure. Contrary to popular belief, the jaw does not pinch the tubes shut when it is closed. In fact, the eustachian tubes are not located close enough to the mandible to be pinched off. People often recommend chewing gum during ascent/descent in aircraft, because chewing gum increases the rate of salivation, and swallowing the excess saliva opens the eustachian tubes. 

In a clinical setting the Valsalva maneuver will commonly be done either against a closed glottis, or against an external pressure measuring device, thus eliminating or minimizing the pressure on the Eustachian tubes. Straining or blowing against resistance as in blowing up balloons has a Valsalva effect and the fall in blood pressure can result in dizziness and even fainting.

==Diving==
In diving, the Valsalva maneuver is often used on descent to equalise the pressure in the middle ear to the ambient pressure. If the Valsalva maneuver is conducted during ascent, residual air overpressure in the middle-ear can potentially be released through the Eustachian tubes. During decompression stops at the end of a dive, if the diver unwittingly slightly descends again and makes a Valsalva to relieve his ears, there exists a non-negligible risk to transfer nitrogen bubbles from one side of the heart to the other one if the [[Foramen ovale (heart)|foramen]] membrane is permeable. If some of the inert gas-laden blood passes through the [[Atrial septal defect#Decompression_sickness|patent foramen ovale]] (PFO), it avoids the lungs and the inert gas is more likely to form large bubbles in the arterial blood stream, causing [[decompression sickness]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} 

A Valsalva maneuver at the end of a diving must never be attempted as it can cause a [[Decompression sickness|decompression accident]] with severe neurological consequences (gas bubbles in the [[brain]] or damages to the [[spinal cord]]). Repeated Valsalva maneuvers are also suspected to increase the permeability of the foramen for divers at risk. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Cardiology==
The Valsalva maneuver may be used to arrest episodes of [[supraventricular tachycardia]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=30–5 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(98)70277-X |title=Comparison of Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia by Valsalva Maneuver and Carotid Sinus Massage |year=1998 |last1=Lim |first1=SH |last2=Anantharaman |first2=V |last3=Teo |first3=WS |last4=Goh |first4=PP |last5=Tan |first5=ATH |journal=[[Annals of Emergency Medicine]] |volume=31 |pmid=9437338 |issue=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16573413 |year=2002 |last1=Nagappan |first1=R |last2=Arora |first2=S |last3=Winter |first3=C |title=Potential dangers of the Valsalva maneuver and adenosine in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia--beware preexcitation |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=107–11 |journal=Critical care and resuscitation}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2011}}</ref>  The maneuver can sometimes be used to diagnose heart abnormalities, especially when used in conjunction with [[echocardiogram]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=222–5 |doi=10.1080/14017430801932832 |title=Is transesophageal echocardiography still necessary to exclude patent foramen ovale? |year=2008 |last1=Zuber |first1=M. |last2=Cuculi |first2=F. |last3=Oechslin |first3=E. |last4=Erne |first4=P. |last5=Jenni |first5=R. |journal=Scandinavian Cardiovascular Journal |volume=42 |issue=3 |pmid=18569955}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2011}}</ref>  For example, the Valsalva maneuver classically increases the intensity of [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] murmurs, viz. those of dynamic subvalvular left ventricular outflow obstruction; whereas it decreases the intensity of most other murmurs, including [[aortic stenosis]] and [[atrial septal defect]].

The Valsalva maneuver works by decreasing preload to the heart. A complementary maneuver for differentiating disorders is the [[Handgrip maneuver]], which increases afterload.

The Valsalva maneuver alters heart rate through [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] stimulation (e.g. the [[accelerator nerve]]). Neuro-muscular junctions at the [[sinoatrial node]] (SAN) release the neurotransmitter [[norepinephrine]]([[noradrenaline]]), which increases the SAN's depolarisation rate.

These effects decrease the time between pacemaker action potentials, which results in a faster heartbeat. In later phases of the Valsalva maneuver (phases II and III), heart rate is reduced due to [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] interplay.

==Neurology==
The Valsalva maneuver is used to aid in the clinical diagnosis of problems or injury in the nerves of the cervical spine.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=5783806 |year=1969 |last1=Johnson |first1=RH |last2=Smith |first2=AC |last3=Spalding |first3=JM |title=Blood pressure response to standing and to Valsalva's manoeuvre: Independence of the two mechanisms in neurological diseases including cervical cord lesions |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=77–86 |journal=[[Clinical Science (journal)|Clinical Science]] }}</ref>  Upon performing the Valsalva maneuver, intraspinal pressure slightly increases. Thus, neuropathies or radicular pain may be felt or exacerbated, and this may indicate impingement on a nerve by an intervertebral disc or other part of the anatomy. Headache and pain upon performing the Valsalva maneuver is also one of the main symptoms in [[Arnold–Chiari_malformation]]. 
The Valsalva maneuver may be of use in checking for a dural tear following certain spinal operations such as a microdiscectomy. An increase in intra-spinal pressure will cause CSF to leak out of the dura causing a headache.{{Citation needed| date=June 2012}}

==Urogenital==
The Valsalva maneuver is used to aid diagnosis of intrinsic sphincteric deficiency (ISD) in urodynamic tests. Valsalva leak point pressure is the minimum vesicular pressure that is associated with urine leakage. Although there is no consensus on the threshold value, values >&nbsp;60&nbsp;cm&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O are commonly considered to indicate hypermobility of the bladder neck and normal sphincter function.<ref>{{cite web | first = Michael | last = O'Shaughnessy | title = Urinary incontinence, medical and surgical aspects | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/257260-overview }}</ref> Also, when examining women with [[female genital prolapse|pelvic organ prolapse]], asking the patient to perform the Valsalva maneuver is used to demonstrate maximum pelvic organ descent.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=10–7 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70243-0 |title=The standardization of terminology of female pelvic organ prolapse and pelvic floor dysfunction |year=1996 |last1=Bump |first1=Richard C. |last2=Mattiasson |first2=Anders |last3=Bø |first3=Kari |last4=Brubaker |first4=Linda P. |last5=Delancey |first5=John O.L. |last6=Klarskov |first6=Peter |last7=Shull |first7=Bob L. |last8=Smith |first8=Anthony R.B. |journal=[[American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] |volume=175 |pmid=8694033 |issue=1}}</ref>

==Valsalva retinopathy==
A pathologic syndrome associated with the Valsalva maneuver is Valsalva retinopathy.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=701–2 |doi=10.1136/bjo.2006.104935 |pmc=1954736 |title=Changes in the retinal inner limiting membrane associated with Valsalva retinopathy |year=2007 |last1=Gibran |first1=S K |last2=Kenawy |first2=N |last3=Wong |first3=D |last4=Hiscott |first4=P |journal=[[British Journal of Ophthalmology]] |volume=91 |issue=5 |pmid=17446519 }}</ref> It presents as preretinal hemorrhage (bleeding in front of the retina) in people with a history of transient increase in the intrathoracic pressure. The bleeding may be associated with a history of heavy lifting, a forceful coughing, straining on the toilet, or vomiting. The bleeding may cause a reduction of vision if it obstructs the visual axis. Patients may also note floaters in their vision. Usually a full recovery of vision is made.

==Valsalva device in spacesuits==
On 25 May 2011, [[NASA]] reported that during the second spacewalk of [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-134]], astronaut [[Drew Feustel]] was able to clear tears from his eye by wiggling down far enough in his [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (spacesuit) to make use of "a spongy device called a Valsalva that is typically used to block the nose in case a pressure readjustment is needed."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.space-travel.com/reports/US_astronaut_grapples_with_tears_in_space_999.html | title = US astronaut grapples with 'tears in space' | work = spacedaily.com | date= 25 May 2011 | accessdate = 27 May 2011 }}</ref>  The tears came about because some of a film of anti-fogging agent (liquid soap) came free from the inside of the helmet and floated into his eye.

In November 2011 [[ESA]] astronaut [[Samantha Cristoforetti]] posted on Twitter a picture of her demonstrating the use of the Valsalva device in the [[Sokol space suit]].<ref>{{Twitter status | user = AstroSamantha | statusid = 138912801153490944 | title = It's a Valsalva device, to equalize ears as pressure in suit increases |name = Sam Cristoforetti | date = 22 November 2011 | accessdate = 22 November 2012 }}</ref>
