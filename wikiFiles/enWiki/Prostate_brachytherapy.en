[[Brachytherapy]] is a type of [[radiotherapy]], or radiation treatment, offered to certain cancer patients. There are two types of brachytherapy – high dose-rate (HDR) and low dose-rate (LDR). LDR brachytherapy is the type that is most commonly used to treat [[prostate cancer]]; it may sometimes be referred to as ‘seed implantation’ or it may also be called ‘pinhole surgery’.

In LDR brachytherapy, tiny radioactive particles the size of a grain of rice (see [[:Image:seedimplantsize.jpg|Figure 1]]) are implanted directly into the site of the [[tumour]]. These particles are known as ‘seeds’, and they can be inserted linked together as strands, or individually. Because the seeds are inserted or implanted directly into, or very close to, the tumour, they deliver high doses of radiation to the tumour without affecting the normal healthy tissues around it. This means that the procedure is less damaging than conventional radiation therapy, where the radioactive beam is delivered from outside the body and must pass through other tissues before reaching the tumour. 

LDR prostate brachytherapy (seed implantation) is a proven treatment for early, localised prostate cancer (when the cancer is contained within the prostate). <ref name="Kupelian PA, Potters L, Khuntia D et al.

The seeds are permanently implanted, so they remain in place but gradually become inactive as the radioactivity decays naturally and safely over time.<ref>The American Brachytherapy Society: www.americanbrachytherapy.org</ref> Unlike traditional surgery, LDR brachytherapy requires no incisions and is normally carried out as a day-case procedure. Sometimes a single overnight stay in hospital is required. Patients usually recover quickly from LDR brachytherapy, which means that most men can return to work or normal daily activities within a few days. As described below, LDR brachytherapy has a good side-effect profile with less risk of [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] or [[impotence]] than other treatment options,<ref name="Frank SJ, Pisters LL, Davis J et al.

==What does LDR prostate brachytherapy treatment involve?==
[[File:Prostategrid.jpg|thumb|268px|right|Figure 2. Grid for inserting needles into the perineum]][[File:Seedplace.jpg|thumb|268px|right|Figure 3. Diagram showing where the seeds are placed in the prostate after insertion]][[File:Computerimage.jpg|thumb|268px|right|Figure 4. Computer image illustrating how the prostate (orange/red) is completely covered with radiation (green). The radiation does not affect the back passage (rectum, blue) at all.]]

When LDR prostate brachytherapy (seed implantation) is carried out, an [[ultrasound]] probe is inserted into the back passage ([[rectum]]), and images from this probe are used to assess the size and shape of the [[prostate gland]]. This is done so that the doctor can identify how to best deliver the right radiation dose for each patient. Then the seeds are inserted in the exact locations identified at the beginning of the procedure. This usually takes 1–2 hours.<ref name="Salembier C, Lavagnini P, Nickers P et al.

Radiotherapy and Oncology 2007;83:3–10">Salembier C, Lavagnini P, Nickers P et al. Tumour and target volumes in permanent prostate brachytherapy: a supplement to the ESTRO/EAU/EORTC recommendations on prostate brachytherapy. Radiotherapy and Oncology 2007;83:3–10</ref> No surgical incision is required; instead, the radioactive seeds are inserted into the prostate gland using needles which pass through the skin between the [[scrotum]] and the rectum (the [[perineum]]) and an ultrasound probe is used to accurately guide them to their final position. The needles are put in to the target positions and between 70 and 150 seeds are placed into the prostate. The needles are then removed. [[:Image:Prostategrid.jpg|Figure 2]] shows the grid-like device used to guide the needles into the perineal area; co-ordinates or ‘map references’ on this grid or template are used to pinpoint the exact positions in the prostate where the seeds are to be placed. [[:Image:Seedplace.jpg|Figure 3]] shows how the seeds are positioned to target the tumour. The doctor uses ultrasound and X-ray pictures to make sure the seeds are in the right place. A special computer software program is used to make sure the prostate gland is completely covered by just the right dose of radiation (see [[:Image:Computerimage.jpg|Figure 4]]) to ensure that all cancer cells present in the prostate have been completely treated.  

Once in place, the seeds slowly begin to release their radiation. While the seeds are active, the patient must observe some basic precautions. Travel and contact with adults are fine; however, for the first two months following seed implantation, small children and pregnant women should not be in direct contact with the patient for prolonged periods – for example children should not sit on the patient’s knee for any length of time. Sexual intercourse can start again within a few weeks. Very occasionally a seed can be expelled in the semen on ejaculation; if this does happen, it will usually occur in the first few ejaculations, so it is advisable to use a condom for the first two or three occasions of intercourse following LDR brachytherapy. <ref name="Ash D, Flynn A, Batterman J et al.

Patients can usually get back to normal activities and work within a few days. They should expect to be seen for follow-up after four to six weeks, and then every three months for a year, six-monthly up to five years, then annually.<ref name="Salembier C, Lavagnini P, Nickers P et al.

== Indications ==
LDR prostate brachytherapy (seed implantation) is recommended as a treatment for patients whose cancer is at an early stage (cancer stages T1 to T2), and which has not spread beyond the prostate (localised disease).<ref name="Ash D, Flynn A, Batterman J et al.

==Risks and benefits==
Since its introduction in the mid-1980s, prostate brachytherapy (seed implantation) has become a well-established treatment option for patients with early, localised disease. In the US alone, over 50,000 eligible prostate cancer patients a year are treated using this method.<ref name="The Prostate Brachytherapy Advisory Group: www.prostatebrachytherapyinfo.net">The Prostate Brachytherapy Advisory Group: www.prostatebrachytherapyinfo.net</ref> Awareness of this treatment choice has now spread to other parts of the world, and there is widespread and rapidly growing use of the technique. In the UK alone, brachytherapy has been used for over 10 years and thousands of patients have been treated.

===Clinical benefits===
LDR prostate brachytherapy (seed implantation) on its own has been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of early prostate cancer.<ref>Khaksar SJ, Laing RW, Henderson A et al. Biochemical (prostate-specific antigen) relapse-free survival and toxicity after <sup>125</sup>I low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy. BJU International 2006;98:1210–1215</ref> The rate of survival with no increase in average PSA levels after LDR brachytherapy is similar to that achieved with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy.<ref name="Kupelian PA, Potters L, Khuntia D et al.

The Journal of Urology 2007;177:2151–2156</ref> It is important to remember that many men in this age group die from diseases unrelated to their prostate cancer.

===Side-effects===
[[File:side effects 800.jpg|thumb|268px|right|Table 1. Side-effects and effects on recovery of treatments for newly diagnosed prostate cancer.<ref name="The Prostate Brachytherapy Advisory Group: www.prostatebrachytherapyinfo.net">The Prostate Brachytherapy Advisory Group: www.prostatebrachytherapyinfo.net</ref>]]

LDR prostate brachytherapy (seed implantation) is a very effective treatment for early, localised prostate cancer, with patients rapidly returning to normal activities.<ref>Langley SE, Laing R. Prostate brachytherapy has come of age: a review of the technique and results. BJU International 2002;89:241–249</ref> Although patients may experience problems ([[urinary incontinence]] or difficulty with [[urination]]) for the first 6 months or so after their implant, these usually settle down and lasting problems are rare, only occurring in about 1–2% of patients.<ref>Crook J, Fleshner N, Roberts C, Pond G. Long-term urinary sequelae following 125Iodine prostate brachytherapy. The Journal of Urology 2008;179:141–146</ref> Some patients (less than 10%) report an increase in bowel problems (diarrhoea or urgency of the bowels), but again this usually settles down without further treatment.<ref name="Buron C, Le Vu B, Cosset JM et al. Brachytherapy versus prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer: Results of a French multicenter prospective medico-economic study.

Brachytherapy versus prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer: Results of a French multicenter prospective medico-economic study. International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics 2007;67:812–822</ref> 

[[Erectile dysfunction]] (difficulty getting and/or keeping an erection; impotence) is another side-effect associated with all treatments for prostate cancer. Other treatments for prostate cancer cause problems with erectile dysfunction in 30–60% of men (as seen in [[:Image:side effects 800.jpg|Table 1]]), but these problems are much less common after LDR brachytherapy, and only occur in about 10–30% of men under the age of 60 years, who were potent before treatment.<ref name="The Prostate Brachytherapy Advisory Group: www.prostatebrachytherapyinfo.net">The Prostate Brachytherapy Advisory Group: www.prostatebrachytherapyinfo.net</ref>

In a recent study looking at patients’ quality of life, LDR brachytherapy compared favourably with other treatment options.<ref name="Buron C, Le Vu B, Cosset JM et al. Brachytherapy versus prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer: Results of a French multicenter prospective medico-economic study. International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics 2007;67:812–822">Buron C, Le Vu B, Cosset JM et al. Brachytherapy versus prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer: Results of a French multicenter prospective medico-economic study. International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics 2007;67:812–822</ref> [[:Image:side effects 800.jpg|Table 1]] summarises the more common side-effects related with each form of treatment and how these may affect patient recovery.

==Summary==
In summary, LDR prostate brachytherapy (seed implantation) as a treatment for early, localised prostate cancer is as effective as other recommended treatments, but has fewer serious side-effects. Since it does not involve major surgery, LDR brachytherapy may be preferred by patients because it preserves their quality of life, notably their sex life and urinary control, and limits their time in hospital after the procedure allowing them to return quickly to their everyday lives.
