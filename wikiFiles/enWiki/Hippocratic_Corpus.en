The '''Hippocratic Corpus''' (Latin: ''Corpus Hippocraticum''), or '''Hippocratic Collection''', is a collection of around 60 early Ancient Greek medical works strongly associated with the physician [[Hippocrates]] and his teachings. They are, however, varied in content, age and style, and are largely of unknown authorship.

==Authorship, name, origin==
Of the texts in the corpus, none is proven to be by Hippocrates himself.<ref name=singer27>{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=27}}.</ref> The works of the corpus range from Hippocrates' time and school to many centuries later and rival points of view. [[Franz Zacharias Ermerins]] identifies the hands of at least nineteen authors in the Hippocratic Corpus.{{sfn|Tuke|1911|p=518}} However, the varied works of the corpus have gone under Hippocrates' name since antiquity. The corpus may be the remains of a library of [[Kos|Cos]], or a collection compiled in the third century B.C. in [[Alexandria]]. It was not, however, only the [[Kos|Coan]] school of [[Ancient Greek medicine]] that contributed to it; the [[Knidos|Cnidian]] did, too.<ref name=margotta64>{{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=64}}.</ref><ref name=marti86>{{Harvnb|Martí-Ibáñez|1961|pp=86–87}}.</ref> Only a fraction of the Hippocratic writings have survived.  The lost medical literature is sometimes referred to in the surviving treatises, as at the beginning of ''Regimen''.<ref name=Gillispie>{{harvnb|Gillispie|1972|p=420}}.</ref> Some Hippocratic works are known only in translation. "Hippocratic" texts survive in [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]], [[Syriac]], and [[Latin]].

==Dates and groupings==
The majority of the works in the Hippocratic Corpus date from the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], the last decades of the 5th century BC and the first half of the 4th century BC. Among the later works, ''The Law'', ''On the Heart'', ''On the Physician'', and ''On Sevens'' are all [[Hellenistic]], while ''Precepts'' and ''On Decorum'' are from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD.<ref name=Gillispie/>

Some of the earliest works of the corpus (mid-fifth century) are connected to the Cnidian school: ''On Diseases'' II–III and the early layer within ''On the Diseases of Women'' I–II and ''On Sterile Women''.<ref name=jouanna-collection>{{Harvnb|Jouanna|1999|pp=373–416}} (Appendix 3: The Treatises of the Hippocratic Collection).</ref> ''Prorrhetics'' I is also mid-fifth century.<ref name=jouanna-collection/>  In the second half of the fifth century, a single author likely produced the treatises ''On Airs, Waters, Places''; ''Prognostics''; ''Prorrhetics'' II; and ''On the Sacred Disease''.<ref name=jouanna-collection/> Other fifth-century works include ''On Fleshes'', ''Epidemics'' I and III (ca. 410 BC), ''On Ancient Medicine'', ''On Regimen in Acute Diseases'', and Polybus' ''On the Nature of Man''/''Regimen in Health'' (410–400 BC).<ref name=jouanna-collection/>

At the end of the fifth or the beginning of the fourth century, one author likely wrote ''Epidemics'' II–IV–VI and ''On the Humors''. The coherent group of surgical treatises (''On Fractures'', ''On Joints'', ''On Injuries of the Head'', ''Surgery'', ''Mochlicon'') is of similar date.<ref name=jouanna-collection/>

The gynecological treatises ''On the Nature of the Woman'', ''On the Diseases of Women'', ''Generation'', ''On the Nature of the Child'', and ''On Sterile Women'' constitute a closely related group. {{ill|de|Hermann Grensemann}} identified five layers of material in this group, from the mid-fifth century to the mid-fourth century.<ref name=hanson>
{{harvnb|Hanson|1991|p=77}}.</ref> The oldest stratum is found in ''On the Nature of the Woman'' and ''On the Diseases of Women'' II.<ref name=hanson/> ''Generation'' and ''On the Nature of the Child'' constitute a single work by a late-fifth-century author,{{sfn|Lonie|1981|p=71}} who may also be identified as the author of ''On Diseases'' IV and of sections of ''On the Diseases of Women'' I.{{sfn|Lonie|1981|p=71}} The latest layer is ''On Sterile Women'', which was composed after the other gynecological treatises were in existence.<ref name=hanson/>

A single fourth-century author probably wrote ''On Fistulae'' and ''On Hemorrhoids''.<ref name=jouanna-collection/>

==Content==
The Hippocratic Corpus contains textbooks, lectures, research, notes and philosophical essays on various subjects in medicine, in no particular order.<ref name=singer27/><ref name=rutkow23>{{Harvnb|Rutkow|p=23}}.</ref> These works were written for different audiences, both specialists and laymen, and were sometimes written from opposing view points; significant contradictions can be found between works in the Corpus.<ref name=sing28>{{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=28}}.</ref>

===Case histories===
One significant portion of the corpus is made up of [[Medical history|case histories]].  Books I and III of ''Epidemics'' contain forty-two case histories, of which 60% (25) ended in the patient's death.<ref name=gar95>{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=95}}.</ref> Nearly all of the diseases described in the Corpus are [[endemic disease]]s: colds, consumption, pneumonia, etc.{{sfn|Jones|1923|p=lvi}}

===Theoretical and methodological reflections===
In several texts of the corpus, the ancient physicians develop theories of illness, sometimes grappling with the methodological difficulties that lie in the way of effective and consistent diagnosis and treatment: "One of the great merits of the physicians of the Hippocratic Corpus is that they are not content to practice medicine and to commit their experience to writing, but that they have reflected on their own activity".{{sfn|Jouanna|1988|p=83}}

====Reason and experience====
While the approaches range from [[empiricism]] to a [[rationalism]] reminiscent of the physical theories of the [[Presocratic]]s, these two tendencies can exist side-by-side: "The close association between knowledge and experience is characteristic of the Hippocratics," despite "the [[Plato]]nic attempt to drive a wedge between the two".{{sfn|Schiefsky|2005|p=117}}

The author of ''[[On Ancient Medicine]]'' launches immediately into a critique of opponents who posit a single "cause in all cases" of disease, "having laid down as a [[hypothesis]] for their account hot or cold or wet or dry or anything else they want".<ref>''On Ancient Medicine'' 1.1, trans. {{harvnb|Schiefsky|2005|p=75}}</ref> The method put forward in this treatise "could certainly be characterized as an empirical one," preferring the effects of diet as observed by the senses to cosmological speculations, and it was seized upon by Hellenistic [[Empiric school|Empiricist]] doctors for this reason.{{sfn|Schiefsky|2005|pp=65–66}} However, "unlike the Empiricists, the author does not claim that the doctor's knowledge is ''limited'' to what can be observed by the senses. On the contrary, he requires the doctor to have quite extensive knowledge of aspects of the human constitution that cannot be observed directly, such as the state of the patient's humors and internal organs".{{sfn|Schiefsky|2005|p=345}}

====Epistemology and the scientific status of medicine====
The author of ''The Art'' is at pains to defend the status of medicine as an art (''[[techne]]''), against opponents who (perhaps following [[Protagoras]]' critique of expert knowledge{{sfn|Jouanna|1999|p=244}}) claim it produces no better results against disease than chance (an attack served by the fact that doctors refused to treat the serious and difficult cases they judged to be incurable by their art{{sfn|Jouanna|1999|p=108}}). The treatise may be considered "the first attempt at general [[epistemology]] bequeathed to us by antiquity," although this may only be because we have lost fifth-century [[rhetoric]]al works that took a similar approach.{{sfn|Jouanna|1999|pp=246–248, 255–256}}

For this writer, as for the author of ''On the Places in Man'', the art of medicine has been wholly discovered. While for the author of ''On the Places in Man'' "the principles discovered in it clearly have very little need of good luck," the author of ''The Art'' acknowledges the practical limitations that arise in the therapeutic application of these principles.{{sfn|Jouanna|1999|p=238}} Likewise for the author of ''On Regimen'', the "knowledge and discernment of the nature of man in general—knowledge of its primary constituents and discernment of the components by which it is controlled" may be completely worked out, and yet in practice it is difficult to determine and apply the correct and proportionate diet and exercise to the individual patient.<ref>''Regimen'' 1.2 {{Harv|Jones|1959|pp=[http://www.archive.org/stream/hippocrates04hippuoft#page/226/mode/2up 227]–229}}</ref>

====Natural vs. divine causality====
Whatever their disagreements, the Hippocratic writers agree in rejecting divine and religious causes and remedies of disease in favor of natural mechanisms. Thus ''[[On the Sacred Disease]]'' considers that [[epilepsy]] (the so-called "sacred" disease) "has a natural cause, and its supposed divine origin is due to men's inexperience and to their wonder at its peculiar character." An exception to this rule is found in ''Dreams'' (''Regime'' IV), in which prayers to the gods are prescribed alongside more typically Hippocratic interventions. Though [[materialism|materialistic]] [[determinism]] goes back in Greek thought at least to [[Leucippus]], "One of the greatest virtues of the physicians of the Hippocratic Collection is to have stated, in its most universal form, what was later to be called the principle of determinism. All that occurs has a cause. It is in the treatise of ''The Art'' that the most theoretical statement of this principle is to be found: 'Indeed, under a close examination spontaneity disappears; for everything that occurs will be found to do so through something [''dia ti''].'"<ref name=causality>{{Harvnb|Jouanna|1999|pp=254–255}}.</ref> In a famous passage of ''On Ancient Medicine'', the author insists on the importance of knowledge of causal explanations: "It is not sufficient to learn simply that cheese is a bad food, as it gives a pain to one who eats a surfeit of it; we must know what the pain is, the reasons for it [''dia ti''], and which constituent of man is harmfully affected."<ref name=causality/>

===Medical ethics and manners===
The duties of the physician are an object of the Hippocratic writers' attention. A famous maxim (''Epidemics'' I.11) advises: "As to diseases, make a habit of two things—to help, [[primum non nocere|or at least to do no harm]]."

The most famous work in the Hippocratic Corpus is the [[Hippocratic Oath]], a landmark declaration of medical ethics. The Hippocratic Oath is both philosophical and practical; it not only deals with abstract principles but practical matters such as removing [[kidney stones|stones]] and aiding one's teacher financially. It is a complex and probably not the work of one man.{{sfn|Jones|1923|p=291}}<ref name=garrison96>{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=96}}.</ref> It remains in use, though rarely in its original form.<ref name="garrison96"/>

The preamble of ''On the Physician'' offers "a physical and moral portrait of the ideal physician," and the ''Precepts'' also concern the physician's conduct.{{sfn|Jouanna|1999|pp=404–405}} Treatises such as ''On Joints'' and ''Epidemics'' VI are concerned with the provision of such "courtesies" as providing a patient with cushions during a procedure,{{sfn|Jouanna|1999|p=133}} and ''Decorum'' includes advice on good manners to be observed in the doctor's office or when visiting patients.

==Style==
The writing style of the Corpus has been remarked upon for centuries, being described by some as, "clear, precise, and simple".<ref name=gar99>{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}}.</ref> It is often praised for its objectivity and concisesness, yet some have criticised it as being "grave and austere".{{sfn|Jones|1923|p=xv}} [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]], a translator of the Corpus, goes further and calls it sometimes “obscure”. Of course, not all of the Corpus is of this “laconic” style, though most of it is. It was Hippocratic practice to write in this style.<ref name=adams18>{{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=18}}.</ref>

The whole corpus is written in [[Ionic dialect|Ionic Greek]], though the island of Cos was in a region that spoke [[Doric Greek]].

''The Art'' and ''On Breaths'' show the influence of [[Sophist]]ic rhetoric; they "are characterized by long introductions and conclusions, [[antithesis|antitheses]], [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphoras]], and sound effects typical of [[Gorgias|Gorgianic]] style." Other works also have rhetorical elements.{{sfn|Schironi|2010|p=350}} In general, it can be said that "the Hippocratic physician was also an orator," with his role including public speeches and "verbal wrestling matches".{{sfn|Jouanna|1999|p=79–85}}

==Printed editions==
The entire Hippocratic Corpus was first printed as a unit in 1525. This edition was in [[Latin]] and was edited by [[Marcus Fabius Calvus]] in [[Rome]]. The first complete [[Greek language|Greek]] edition followed the next year from the [[Aldine Press]] in [[Venice]]. A significant edition was that of [[Émile Littré]] who spent twenty-two years (1839–1861) working diligently on a complete Greek edition and French translation of the Hippocratic Corpus. This was scholarly, yet sometimes inaccurate and awkward.<ref name=Jones68f>{{Harvnb|Jones|1923|pp=lxviii–lxix}}.</ref> Another edition of note was that of [[Franz Zacharias Ermerins]], published in Utrecht between 1859 and 1864.<ref name=Jones68f/> Kühlewein's [[Teubner]] edition (1894–1902) "mark[ed] a distinct advance".<ref name=Jones68f/>

Beginning in 1967, an important modern edition by {{ill2|Jacques Jouanna|de|Jacques Jouanna|fr|Jacques Jouanna}} and others began to appear (with Greek text, French translation, and commentary) in the [[Collection Budé]]. Other important bilingual annotated editions (with translation in German or French) continue to appear in the ''Corpus medicorum graecorum'' published by the [[Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften]].

===English translations===
The first English translation from the Hippocratic Corpus, [[Peter Lowe (surgeon)|Peter Lowe]]'s ''Chirurgerie'' ("Surgery"), was published in 1597, but a complete English translation of a dozen and a half "genuine" works was not offered in English until Francis Adams' publication of 1849. Other works of the corpus remained untranslated into English until the resumed publication of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition beginning in 1988.<ref>[[Vivian Nutton]], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1036007/pdf/medhist00056-0106a.pdf review] of Loeb vols. 5–6 (1988).</ref> The first four Loeb volumes were published in 1923–1931, and six further volumes between 1988 and 2012.
