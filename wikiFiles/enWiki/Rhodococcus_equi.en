'''''Rhodococcus equi''''' is a [[Gram-positive]] [[coccobacillus]] bacterium. The organism is commonly found in dry and dusty soil and can be important for diseases of domesticated animals (horses and goats). The frequency of infection can reach near 60 percent.<ref>G. Muscatello, D. P. Leadon, M. Klay, A. Ocampo-Sosa, D. A. Lewis, U. Fogarty, T. Buckley, J. R. Gilkerson, W. G. Meijer, and J. A. Vázquez-Boland. (2007) Rhodococcus equi infection in foals: the science of 'rattles'. Equine Vet.J. 39:470-478. In: PMID 17910275</ref> ''R. equi'' is an important pathogen causing [[pneumonia]] in [[foal]]s. Since 2008, it is known that ''R. equi'' can infect [[wild boar]] as well as [[domestic pig]]s.<ref>Makrai, L. ''et al.'' (2008): ''Isolation and characterisation of Rhodococcus equi from submaxillary lymph nodes of wild boars (Sus scrofa).'' In: ''Vet Microbiol.'' PMID 18499361 {{DOI|10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.04.009}}</ref> In addition, ''R. equi'' can infect humans. At risk groups are [[immunocompromised]] people, such as [[HIV-AIDS]]-patients or [[organ transplant|transplant]] recipients. ''Rhodococcus'' infection in these groups of patients resemble clinical and pathological signs of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]]. It is [[facultative intracellular]].<ref>{{cite pmid|11882714}}</ref>

Taxonomically, ''R. equi'' has been categorized as ''Corynebacterium equi'', ''Bacillus hoagii'', ''Corynebacterium purulentus'', ''Mycobacterium equi'', ''Mycobacterium restrictum'', ''Nocardia restricta'' and ''Proactinomyces restrictus''.

* [[Pig]]s (wild and domestic)
* [[Goat]]s
* [[Horse]]s
* [[Sheep]]
* [[Cow|Cattle]]
* [[Human]]s

== Virulence ==
The most common route of infection in horses is likely via inhalation of contaminated dust particles. Inhaled [[virulent]] strains of ''R. equi'' are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] by [[alveolar]] [[macrophages]]. During normal [[phagocytosis]], bacteria are enclosed by the [[phagosome]], which fuses with the [[lysosome]] to become a [[phagolysosome]]. The internal environment of the phagolysosome contains [[nuclease]]s and [[protease]]s, which are activated by the low pH of the compartment. The macrophage produces [[bacteriocidal]] compounds (e.g., [[oxygen radical]]s) following the [[respiratory burst]]. However, like its close relative ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', ''R. equi'' prevents the fusion of the phagosome with the lysosome and acidification of the phagosome. Additionally, the respiratory burst is inhibited. This allows ''R. equi'' to multiply within the phagosome where it is shielded from the immune system by the very cell that was supposed to kill it.<ref>M. K. Hondalus and D. M. Mosser. Survival and replication of Rhodococcus equi in macrophages. Infect.Immun. 62:4167-4175, 1994. In: PMID 7927672</ref> After about 48 hours, the macrophage is killed by [[necrosis]], not [[apoptosis]].<ref>A. Lührmann, N. Mauder, T. Sydor, E. Fernandez-Mora, J. Schulze-Luehrmann, S. Takai, and A. Haas. Necrotic death of Rhodococcus equi-infected macrophages is regulated by virulence-associated plasmids. Infect.Immun. 72 (2):853-862, 2004. In: PMID 14742529</ref> Necrosis is pro-inflammatory attracting additional phagocytic cells to the site of infection, eventually resulting in massive tissue damage.

== Virulence plasmid==
All strains isolated from foals and the majority of human, cattle and pig isolates contain a large [[plasmid]]. This plasmid has been shown to be essential for infection of foals, and presumably plays a similar role for [[infection]] of other hosts, although this has not been established yet. Strains that lack the virulence plasmid are unable to proliferate in macrophages. This virulence plasmid has been characterised in detail from equine (horse) and porcine (pig) strains, although only the former has been functionally characterised.<ref>M. Letek, A. A. Ocampo-Sosa, M. Sanders, U. Fogarty, T. Buckley, D. P. Leadon, P. Gonzalez, M. Scortti, W. G. Meijer, J. Parkhill, S. Bentley, and J. A. Vázquez-Boland. Evolution of the Rhodococcus equi vap pathogenicity island seen through comparison of host-associated vapA and vapB virulence plasmids. J.Bacteriol. 190 (17):5797-5805, 2008. In: PMID 18606735</ref><ref>S. Takai, S. A. Hines, T. Sekizaki, V. M. Nicholson, D. A. Alperin, M. Osaki, D. Osaki, M. Nakamura, K. Suzuki, N. Ogino, T. Kakuka, H. Dan, and J. F. Prescott. DNA sequence and comparison of virulence plasmids from Rhodococcus equi ATCC 33701 and 103. Infect.Immun. 68:6840-6847, 2000. In: PMID 11083803</ref> These circular plasmids consist of a conserved backbone that is responsible for replication and [[bacterial conjugation]] of the plasmid. This portion of the plasmid is highly conserved and found in non-pathogenic ''Rhodococci'' plasmids. In addition to the conserved region, the virulence plasmids contain a highly variable region that has undergone substantial genetic rearrangements, including [[Chromosomal inversion|inversion]] and [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]]s. This region has a different [[GC-content]] from the rest of the plasmid, and is flanked by genes associated with [[mobile genetic elements]]. It is therefore assumed to be derived from a different bacterial species than the backbone of the plasmid via [[lateral gene transfer]].

== Pathogenicity island ==
The variable region of the virulence plasmid contain genes that are highly expressed following phagocytosis of ''R. equi'' by macrophages.<ref>J. Ren and J. F. Prescott. Analysis of virulence plasmid gene expression of intra-macrophage and in vitro grown Rhodococcus equi ATCC 33701. Vet.Microbiol. 94 (2):167-182, 2003. In: 12781484</ref> It is believed that this variable region is a [[pathogenicity island]] that contains genes that are essential for virulence.<br />
<br />
A hallmark of the [[pathogenicity island]] (PAI) is that many genes within it do not have [[homology (biology)|homologues]] in other species. The most notable of these are the virulence associated protein (''vap'') genes. All foals infected with ''R. equi'' produce high levels of [[antibody|antibodies]] specific for ''vapA'', the first ''vap'' gene to be characterised. Deletion of ''vapA'' renders the resulting strain avirulent.<ref>S. Jain, B. R. Bloom, and M. K. Hondalus. Deletion of ''vapA'' encoding Virulence Associated Protein A attenuates the intracellular actinomycete Rhodococcus equi. Mol.Microbiol 50 (1):115-128, 2003. In: PMID 14507368</ref> In addition to ''vapA'', the pathogenicity island encodes a further five full length ''vap'' homologues, one truncated ''vap'' gene and two [[pseudogene|pseudo ''vap'' genes]]. The porcine pathogenicity island contains five full length ''vap'' genes, including the ''vapA'' homologue, ''vapB''. In addition to these unique genes, the pathogencity island contains genes that have a known function, in particular two regulatory genes encoding the LysR-type regulator VirR and the response regulator Orf8. These two proteins have been shown to control expression of a number of pathogenicity island genes including ''vapA''.<ref>D. A. Russell, G. A. Byrne, E. P. O'Connell, C. A. Boland, and W. G. Meijer. The LysR-Type transcriptional regulator VirR is required for expression of the virulence gene vapA of Rhodococcus equi ATCC 33701. J.Bacteriol. 186:5576-5584, 2004. In: PMID 15317761</ref> Other genes have homology to transport proteins and enzymes. However, the functionality of these genes has not yet been established, nor how the proteins encoded within pathogenicity island subvert the macrophage.
