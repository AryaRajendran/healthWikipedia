'''''Mycoplasma''''' refers to a [[genus]] of [[bacteria]] that lack a [[cell wall]].<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ, Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | pages=409–12 |edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9}}</ref> Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common [[antibiotics]] such as [[penicillin]] or other [[beta-lactam]] antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. They can be [[parasitic]] or [[saprotrophic]]. Several species are [[pathogen]]ic in humans, including ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'', which is an important cause of [[atypical pneumonia]] and other respiratory disorders, and ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'', which is believed to be involved in [[pelvic inflammatory diseases]]. Mycoplasma is the smallest known cell and is about 0.1&nbsp;[[µm]] in diameter.

== Origin of the name ==
The name ''Mycoplasma'', from the Greek ''mykes'' (fungus) and ''plasma'' (formed), was first used by [[Albert Bernhard Frank]] in 1889. He thought it was a fungus, due to fungus-like characteristics.<ref name="Krass_1973">{{cite journal | author = Krass CJ, Gardner MW | title =  Etymology of the Term Mycoplasma| journal = Int. J. Of Syst. Bact. | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 62–64 | year = 1973 | month = January | pmid = | doi =  10.1099/00207713-23-1-62| url = http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/1/62.pdf }}</ref>

An older name for ''Mycoplasma'' was '''Pleuro pneumonia-Like Organisms''' (PPLO), referring to organisms similar to the causative agent of [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]] (CBPP).<ref name="Edward">{{cite journal | author = Edward DG, Freundt EA | title = The classification and nomenclature of organisms of the pleuropneumonia group | journal = J. Gen. Microbiol. | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 197–207 | year = 1956 | month = February | pmid = 13306904 | doi = | url = http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/1/197.pdf }}</ref> It was later found that the fungus-like growth pattern of ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides|M. mycoides]]'' is unique to that species.

== Characteristics ==

There are over 100 recognized species of the genus ''Mycoplasma'', one of several genera within the bacterial [[Class (biology)|class]] ''[[Mollicutes]]''. Mollicutes are [[parasite]]s or [[commensal]]s of humans, other animals (including insects), and plants; the genus ''Mycoplasma'' is by definition restricted to [[vertebrate]] hosts. [[Cholesterol]] is required for the growth of species of the genus ''Mycoplasma'' as well as certain other genera of mollicutes. Their optimum growth temperature is often the temperature of their host if warmbodied (e. g. 37° [[Celsius|C]] in humans) or ambient temperature if the host is unable to regulate its own internal temperature. Analysis of 16S [[ribosomal RNA]] sequences as well as [[gene]] content strongly suggest that the mollicutes, including the mycoplasmas, are closely related to either the ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' or the ''[[Clostridium]]'' branch of the phylogenetic tree ([[Firmicutes]] ''sensu stricto'').

=== Cell morphology ===

The [[bacteria]] of the genus ''Mycoplasma'' (trivial name: mycoplasmas) and their close relatives are characterized by lack of a [[cell wall]]. Despite this, the cells often present a certain shape, with a characteristic small size, with typically about 10% of the volume of an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cell. These cell shapes presumably contribute to the ability of mycoplasmas to thrive in their respective environments. Most are [[pseudococcoidal]], but there are notable exceptions. Species of the ''M. fastidiosum'' cluster are rod-shaped. Species of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster, including ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'', possess a polar extension protruding from the pseudococcoidal cell body. This tip structure, designated an attachment organelle or terminal organelle, is essential for adherence to host cells and for movement along solid surfaces (gliding motility), and is implicated in normal cell division. ''M. pneumoniae'' cells are pleomorphic, with an attachment organelle of regular dimensions at one pole and a trailing filament of variable length and uncertain function at the other end, whereas other species in the cluster typically lack the trailing filament. Other species like ''[[Mycoplasma mobile|M. mobile]]'' and ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'' have similar structures with similar functions.

Mycoplasmas are unusual among bacteria in that most require [[sterols]] for the stability of their [[cytoplasmic membrane]]. Sterols are acquired from the environment, usually as cholesterol from the animal host. Mycoplasmas generally possess a relatively small [[genome]] of 0.58-1.38 megabases, which results in drastically reduced biosynthetic capabilities and explains their dependence on a host. Additionally they use an alternate [[genetic code]] in which the [[codon]] UGA encodes the amino acid [[tryptophan]] instead of the usual [[stop codon]]. They have a low [[GC-content]] (23-40 [[Mole (unit)|mol]] %).

== First isolation ==

In 1898 Nocard and Roux reported the cultivation of the causative agent of CBPP, which was at that time a grave and widespread disease in cattle herds.<ref name="Nocard_Roux_1898">{{cite journal | author = Nocard EIE , Roux E | title = The microbe of pleuropneumonia. 1896 | journal = Rev.

Cultivation was, and still is difficult because of the complex growth requirements.

These researchers succeeded by inoculating a semi-permeable pouch of sterile medium with pulmonary fluid from an infected animal and depositing this pouch intraperitoneally into a live rabbit. After fifteen to twenty days, the fluid inside of the recovered pouch was opaque, indicating the growth of a microorganism. Opacity of the fluid was not seen in the control. This turbid broth could then be used to inoculate a second and third round and subsequently introduced into a healthy animal, causing disease. However, this did not work if the material was heated, indicating a biological agent at work. Uninoculated media in the pouch, after removal from the rabbit, could be used to grow the organism [[in vitro]], demonstrating the possibility of cell-free cultivation and ruling out viral causes, although this was not fully appreciated at the time .<ref name="Nocard_Roux_1898"/>

== Small genome ==

Recent advances in [[molecular biology]] and [[genomics]] have brought the genetically simple mycoplasmas, particularly ''M. pneumoniae'' and its close relative ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'', to a larger audience. The second published complete bacterial genome sequence was that of ''M. genitalium'', which has one of the smallest genomes of free-living organisms.<ref name="Fraser">{{cite journal | author = Fraser CM, Gocayne JD, White O, Adams MD, Clayton RA, Fleischmann RD, Bult CJ, Kerlavage AR, Sutton G, Kelley JM, Fritchman RD, Weidman JF, Small KV, Sandusky M, Fuhrmann J, Nguyen D, Utterback TR, Saudek DM, Phillips CA, Merrick JM, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Bott KF, Hu PC, Lucier TS, Peterson SN, Smith HO, Hutchison CA, Venter JC | title = The minimal gene complement of Mycoplasma genitalium | journal = Science | volume = 270 | issue = 5235 | pages = 397–403 | year = 1995 | month = October | pmid = 7569993 | doi = 10.1126/science.270.5235.397 }}</ref> The ''M. pneumoniae'' genome sequence was published soon afterwards and was the first genome sequence determined by [[primer walking]] of a [[cosmid]] library instead of the [[whole-genome shotgun]] method.<ref name="pmid8948633">{{cite journal | author = Himmelreich R, Hilbert H, Plagens H, Pirkl E, Li BC, Herrmann R | title = Complete sequence analysis of the genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 24 | issue = 22 | pages = 4420–49 | year = 1996 | month = November | pmid = 8948633 | pmc = 146264 | doi = 10.1093/nar/24.22.4420 }}</ref> ''Mycoplasma'' genomics and [[proteomics]] continue in efforts to understand the

== Taxonomy ==

The medical and agricultural importance of members of the genus ''Mycoplasma'' and related genera has led to the extensive cataloging of many of these organisms by culture, [[serology]], and small subunit [[ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] gene and whole genome sequencing. A recent focus in the sub-discipline of [[molecular phylogenetics]] has both clarified and confused certain aspects of the organization of the class ''Mollicutes''.<ref>{{cite book | author = Johansson K-E, Pettersson B | chapter = Taxonomy of Mollicutes | title=Molecular Biology and Pathogenicity of Mycoplasmas (Razin S, Herrmann R, eds.)| pages=1–30 | publisher = Kluwer Academic/Plenum | location=New York |year = 2002 | url = | isbn = 0-306-47287-2 }}</ref>

Originally the [[Bacterial taxonomy#Vernacular names|trivial name]] "mycoplasmas" has commonly denoted all members of the class [[Mollicutes]]. The name "Mollicutes" is derived from the Latin mollis (soft) and cutes (skin), and all of these bacteria do lack a cell wall and the genetic capability to synthesize [[peptidoglycan]]. Now Mycoplasma is a genus in Mollicutes. Despite the lack of a cell wall,  many [[taxonomists]] have classified ''Mycoplasma'' and relatives in the phylum ''[[Firmicutes]]'', consisting of low G+C [[Gram-positive bacteria]] such as ''[[Clostridium]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus]]'' based on [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] gene analysis. The order ''Mycoplasmatales'' contains a single family, ''[[Mycoplasmataceae]]'', comprising two genera: ''Mycoplasma'' and ''[[Ureaplasma]]''.

Historically, the description of a bacterium lacking a cell wall was sufficient to classify it to the genus ''Mycoplasma'' and as such it is the oldest and largest genus of the class with about half of the class' species (107 validly described), each usually limited to a specific host and with many hosts harboring more than one species, some pathogenic and some commensal. In later studies, many of these species were found to be phylogenetically distributed among at least three separate orders.

A limiting criterion for inclusion within the genus ''Mycoplasma'' is that the organism have a vertebrate host. In fact, the type species, ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides|M. mycoides]]'', along with other significant mycoplasma species like ''M. capricolum'', is evolutionarily more closely related to the genus ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' in the order ''Entomoplasmatales'' than to the other members of the ''Mycoplasma'' genus. This and other discrepancies will likely remain unresolved because of the extreme confusion that change could engender among the medical and agricultural communities.

The remaining species in the genus ''Mycoplasma'' are divided into three non-taxonomic groups, hominis, pneumoniae and fermentans, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.<br />The hominis group contains the phylogenetic clusters of ''[[Mycoplasma bovis|M. bovis]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pulmonis|M. pulmonis]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma hominis|M. hominis]]'', among others. ''[[Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae|M. hyopneumoniae]]'' is a primary bacterial agent of the porcine respiratory disease complex.

The pneumoniae group contains the clusters of ''[[Mycoplasma muris|M. muris]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma fastidiosum|M. fastidiosum]]'', ''[[Ureaplasma urealyticum|U. urealyticum]]'', the currently unculturable [[haemotrophic mollicutes]], informally referred to as [[haemoplasmas]] (recently transferred from the genera ''Haemobartonella'' and ''Eperythrozoon''), and the ''M. pneumoniae'' cluster. This cluster contains the species (and the usual or likely host) ''[[Mycoplasma alvi|M. alvi]]'' (bovine), ''[[Mycoplasma amphoriforme|M. amphoriforme]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma gallisepticum|M. gallisepticum]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'' (human), ''[[Mycoplasma imitans|M. imitans]]'' (avian), ''[[Mycoplasma pirum|M. pirum]]'' (uncertain/human), ''[[Mycoplasma testudinis|M. testudinis]]'' (tortoises), and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'' (human). Most if not all of these species share some otherwise unique characteristics including an attachment organelle, homologs of the ''M. pneumoniae'' cytadherence-accessory proteins, and specialized modifications of the cell division apparatus.

A study of 143 genes in 15 species of ''Mycoplasma'' suggests that the genus can be grouped into four clades: the ''M. hyopneumoniae'' group, the ''M. mycoides'' group, the ''M. pneumoniae'' group and a ''Bacillus''-''Phytoplasma'' group.<ref name="pmid17687503">{{cite journal | author = Oshima K, Nishida H | title = Phylogenetic relationships among mycoplasmas based on the whole genomic information | journal = J. Mol. Evol. | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–58 | year = 2007 | month = September | pmid = 17687503 | doi = 10.1007/s00239-007-9010-3 }}</ref> The ''M. hyopneumoniae'' group is more closely related to the ''M. pneumoniae'' group than the ''M. mycoides'' group.

== Laboratory contaminant ==

''Mycoplasma'' species are often found in research laboratories as contaminants in [[cell culture]]. Mycoplasmal cell culture contamination occurs due to contamination from individuals or contaminated cell culture [[Growth_medium|medium]] ingredients{{clarify|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. ''Mycoplasma'' cells are physically small – less than 1&nbsp;µm – and they are therefore difficult to detect with a conventional [[microscope]]. Mycoplasmas may induce cellular changes, including [[chromosome]] aberrations, changes in [[metabolism]] and cell growth. Severe ''Mycoplasma'' infections may destroy a cell line. Detection techniques include DNA Probe, [[ELISA|enzyme immunoassays]], [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], plating on sensitive [[agar]] and staining with a [[DNA]] stain including [[DAPI]] or [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]].

It has been estimated that at least 11 to 15% of U.S. laboratory cell cultures are contaminated with mycoplasma. <ref>http://www.labmanager.com/?articles.view/articleNo/4618/title/Cell-Culture-Contamination/</ref>
A [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] study showed that half of U.S. scientists did not test for mycoplasma contamination in their cell cultures. The study also stated that, in former Czechoslovakia, 100% of cell cultures that were not routinely tested were contaminated while only 2% of those routinely tested were contaminated (study page 6). Since the U.S. contamination rate was based on a study of companies that routinely checked for mycoplasma, the actual contamination rate may be higher. European contamination rates are higher and that of other countries are higher still (up to 80% of Japanese cell cultures).<ref name=Corning>{{cite news | author = John Ryan | title = Understanding and Managing Cell Culture Contamination | pages= 24 |edition = | publisher = Corning Incorporated | year = 2008 | url = http://catalog2.corning.com/Lifesciences/media/pdf/cccontamination.pdf}}</ref>

==== Possible intracellular mechanisms of mycoplasmal malignant transformation ====
'''Karyotypic changes related to mycoplasma infections'''

Cells infected with mycoplasma for an extended period of time show significant chromosomal abnormalities. These include the addition of chromosomes, the loss of entire chromosomes, partial loss of chromosomes and [[chromosomal translocation]]. All of these genetic abnormalities may contribute to the process of malignant transformation. Chromosomal translocation and extra chromosomes help create abnormally high activity of certain [[proto-oncogenes]]. Proto-oncogenes with increased activity caused by these genetic abnormalities include those encoding [[c-myc]], [[HRAS]], <ref name="pmid 11575494 ">{{cite journal | author = Cimolai N  | title = Do mycoplasmas cause human cancer? | journal = Canadian Journal of Microbiology | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 691-697| year = 2001| month = August | pmid = 11575494 }}</ref> and [[vav]]. <ref name="pmid22076306">{{cite journal | author = Sinkovics JG | title = Molecular biology of oncogenic inflammatory processes.

;Partial reversibility of malignant transformations

The malignant transformation induced by mycoplasma is also different from that caused by other pathogens in that the process is reversible. The state of reversal is, however, only possible up to a certain point during the infection. The window of time that reversibility is possible varies greatly; it depends primarily on the mycoplasma involved. In the case of M. fermentans, the transformation is reversible up until around week 11 of infection and starts to become irreversible between week 11 and 18. <ref name="pmid7479753">{{cite journal | author = Tsai S, Wear DJ, Shih JW, Lo SC | title = Mycoplasmas and oncogenesis: Persistent infection and multistage malignant transformation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 22 | pages = 10197-10201 | year = 1995 | month = October | pmid = 7479753}}</ref> If the bacteria are killed using [[antibiotics]] <ref name="pmid7479753">{{cite journal | author = Tsai S, Wear DJ, Shih JW, Lo SC | title = Mycoplasmas and oncogenesis: Persistent infection and multistage malignant transformation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 22 | pages = 10197-10201 | year = 1995 | month = October | pmid = 7479753}}</ref>  (i.e. [[ciprofloxacin]] <ref name="pmid22076306">{{cite journal | author = Sinkovics JG | title = Molecular biology of oncogenic inflammatory processes.

==== Connections to cancer in vivo and future research ====
Though mycoplasmas are confirmed to be carcinogenic in vitro, it is not yet confirmed whether mycoplasma might be an actual cause of cancer [[in vivo]]. <ref name="pmid19721714">{{cite journal | author =  Namikil K, Goodison S, Porvasnik S, Allan RW, Iczkowski KA, Urbanek C, Reyes L, Sakamoto N, Rosser CJ | title = Persistent exposure to mycoplasma induces malignant transformation of human prostate cells | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 1-9 | year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19721714}}</ref> The uncertainties regarding the bacteria’s potential to cause malignancies is mostly due to the fact that the cells used for the studies are most often from [[immortalised cell line]]s  like the [[BEAS-2B cells]]. These are essentially cells on the verge of becoming cancer cells. One big problem with using these cells to confirm carcinogenic properties is that they will transform spontaneously after 32 [[passaging]]s (when a small number of cells are transferred into a new vessel to extend culture duration). <ref name="pmid19721714">{{cite journal | author =  Namikil K, Goodison S, Porvasnik S, Allan RW, Iczkowski KA, Urbanek C, Reyes L, Sakamoto N, Rosser CJ | title = Persistent exposure to mycoplasma induces malignant transformation of human prostate cells | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 1-9 | year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19721714}}</ref> This, and the fact that no malignant transformation has been detected in non-immortalised “normal” cells that have been infected, might be an indication that mycoplasmas accelerates a cell’s progression towards malignancy, rather than actually causing it. No mycoplasma-generated cancer has yet to be documented in in vivo cultures. It might, however, be possible that very long, chronic infections of mycoplasma are able to cause cancer in non-immortalised cells. This is not yet known since non-immortalised cells can only divide for a limited number of times, and therefore it has not been possible to keep culturing them long enough to develop cancer. <ref name="pmid19721714">{{cite journal | author =  Namikil K, Goodison S, Porvasnik S, Allan RW, Iczkowski KA, Urbanek C, Reyes L, Sakamoto N, Rosser CJ | title = Persistent exposure to mycoplasma induces malignant transformation of human prostate cells | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 1-9 | year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19721714}}</ref> More research is needed to confirm that mycoplasma infections cause cancer or initiate malignancies in human cells. This might be an important step to treat and prevent cancer. <ref name="pmid19721714">{{cite journal | author =  Namikil K, Goodison S, Porvasnik S, Allan RW, Iczkowski KA, Urbanek C, Reyes L, Sakamoto N, Rosser CJ | title = Persistent exposure to mycoplasma induces malignant transformation of human prostate cells | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 1-9 | year = 2009 | month = September | pmid = 19721714}}</ref>

==== Types of cancer associated with mycoplasma ====
[[Colon cancer]]: In a study to understand the effects of mycoplasma contamination on the quality of cultured human colon cancer cells, it was found that there is a positive correlation between the amount of M. hyorhinis present in the sample and the percentage of CD133 positive cells (a glycoprotein with an unknown function). Further tests and analysis are required to determine the exact reason for this phenomenon. <ref name="pmid 20353562">{{cite journal | author = Mariotti E, Gemei M, Mirabelli P, D’Alessio F, Di Noto R, Fortunato G, Del Vecchio L | title = The percentage of CD133+ cells in human colorectal cancer cell lines is influenced by Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 10 | pages = 120-125 | year = 2010 | month =  Mars | pmid = 20353562}}</ref>

[[Gastric cancer]]: There are strong indications that the infection of M. hyorhinis contributes to the development of cancer within the stomach and increases the likelihood of malignant cancer cell development. <ref name="pmid21062494">{{cite journal | author = Yang H, Qu L, Ma H, Chen L, Liu W, Liu C, Meng L, Wu J, Shou C | title = Mycoplasma hyorhinis infection in gastric carcinoma and its effects on the malignant phenotypes of gastric cancer cells | journal = BMC Gastroenterology | volume = 10 | pages = 132-140 | year = 2010 | month = November | pmid = 21062494}}</ref>

[[Lung cancer]]: Studies on lung cancer have supported the belief that there is more than a coincidental positive correlation between the appearance of Mycoplasma strains in patients and the infection with tumorigenesis. Because this is a such a new area of research, more studies must be performed to further understand the correlation and determine possible preventative steps for lung cancer involving mycoplasma. <ref name="pmid21999143">{{cite journal | author =  Tsantsaridou A, Apostolou P, Papasotiriou I, Toloudi M, Chatziloannou M, Glamouzis G | title = Bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically removed lung cancer samples | journal = Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery | volume = 6 | pages = 137 | year = 2011 | month = October | pmid = 21999143}}</ref>

[[Prostate cancer]]:  p37, a protein encoded for by M. hyorhinis, has been found to promote the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The protein also causes the growth, morphology, and the gene expression of the cells to change, causing them to become a more aggressive phenotype. <ref name="pmid21663671">{{cite journal | author = Urbanek C, Goodison S, Chang M, Porvasnik S, Sakamoto N, Li C, Boehlein SK, Rosser CJ | title = Detection of antibodies directed at M. hyorhinis p37 in the serum of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 233-238 | year = 2011 | month = June  | pmid = 21663671}}</ref>

[[Renal Cancer]]: Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) exhibited a significantly high amount of Mycoplasma sp. compared with the healthy control group. This suggests that mycoplasma may play a role in the development of RCC. <ref name="pmid15708077">{{cite journal | author = Pehlivan M, Pehlivan S, Onay H, Koyuncuoglu M | title =  Can mycoplasma-mediated oncogenesis be responsible for formation of conventional renal cell carcinoma? | journal = Urology | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 411-414 | year = 2005 | month = February | pmid = 15708077}}</ref>
