Dr. '''Sven Ivar Seldinger''' (1921–1998), was a  [[radiology|radiologist]] from [[Mora Municipality, Sweden]]. In 1953, he introduced the [[Seldinger technique]] to obtain safe access to [[blood vessel]]s and other hollow [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s.<ref name=Seldinger>{{cite journal |author=Seldinger SI |title=Catheter replacement of the needle in percutaneous arteriography; a new technique |journal=Acta radiologica |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=368–76 |year=1953 |pmid=13057644 |doi=10.3109/00016925309136722}}</ref>

==Biography==
Sven Ivar Seldinger was born on 19 April 1921 in [[Dalarna|Dalarna, Sweden]]. He was born to a family who had long ran the local Mora Mechanical Workshop. He first began his medical training in 1940 at the [[Karolinska Institute]]. After graduating medical school in 1948, he went on to specialize in radiology. While attending at the [[Karolinska Hospital]] he came up with an idea of how to administer a [[catheter]] that would be able to reach every human [[artery]]. He was qualified with the title of Docent in Radiology in 1967 after successfully defending his thesis on percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.<ref name=ajr>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/142/1/4|title=Sven-lvar Seldinger: Biography and Bibliography |publisher=American Journal of Roentgenology|accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref> He was later able to demonstrate, using "phantom experiments", how one could insert a catheter into the [[femoral artery]] and reach both the [[parathyroid artery|parathyroid]] and [[renal artery|renal arteries]].

In 1975, the New York Academy of Medicine awarded Seldinger the Valentine award. The Swedish Association of Medical Radiology and the German Roentgen Association both awarded him an honorary membership to their organizations.<ref name=ajr/> Seldinger died at home in Dalecarlia, Sweden on 21 February 1998. He is survived by his wife and three daughters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/content/full/20/6/1180|title=Sven Ivar Seldinger |last=Greitza |first=Torgny|year=1999|publisher= The American Society of Neuroradiology|pages=20:1180–1181 (6 1999)|accessdate=12 December 2009}}</ref>

==The Seldinger technique==
{{Main|Seldinger technique}}
The Seldinger technique is a medical procedure to obtain safe access to blood vessels and other hollow organs. It is used for [[angiography]], insertion of [[chest drain]]s and [[central venous catheters]], insertion of [[percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy|PEG]] tubes using the push technique, insertion of the leads for an [[artificial pacemaker]] or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]], and numerous other interventional medical procedures. Seldinger first published this technique for obtaining access to the percutaneous vessels in 1953 for the publication ''Acta Radiologica''. This has been described as a "substantial refinement" of a procedure first described by Dr. P.L. Farinas in 1942. This new technique introduced the practice of using a flexible wire to guide a catheter to previous unreachable vascular areas of the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=introduced the use of a flexible, round-ended wire to facilitate catheterinsertion|title=“Wire-Target” Technique for Precise Vascular Access|last=Hamzeh|first=Rabih K. |coauthors=Danon, Saar; Shah, Sanjay; Levi, Daniel; Moore, John|year=2009|work=Volume 326 Number 4|publisher=Texas Heart Institute Journal|accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref>
