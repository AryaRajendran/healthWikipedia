'''Ozone therapy''' is a form of [[alternative medicine]] treatment that purports to increase the amount of oxygen to the body through the introduction of [[ozone]] into the body.  Various methods have been suggested on the method of introducing the ozone into the body, and the purported benefits of this therapy include the treatment of various diseases including [[cancer]], [[AIDS]], [[multiple sclerosis]], among others.  The [[American Cancer Society]] has concluded there is no evidence to support the use of this treatment in any disease.<ref name=ACS>{{cite web|title=Oxygen Therapy|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/oxygen-therapy|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

== Historical uses ==

In 1856, just 16 years after its discovery, ozone was first used in a health care setting to disinfect operating rooms and sterilize surgical instruments.<ref name="Chemical Technology Encyclopedia pp 82-3">Chemical Technology Encyclopedia; Barnes & Noble 1968 vol 1 pp 82-3</ref>  By the end of the 19th century the use of ozone to disinfect drinking water of bacteria and viruses was well established in mainland Europe.<ref name="Chemical Technology Encyclopedia pp 82-3"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Suchkov BP |title=[Study of the Ozonization of Drinking Water Containing Pathogenic Bacteria and Viruses] |language=Russian |journal=Gig Sanit |volume=29 |issue= |pages=22–9 |year=1964 |month=June |pmid=14235449 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  In 1892 ''[[The Lancet]]'' published an article describing the administration of ozone for treatment of [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Internal Administration of Ozone in the Treatment of Phthisis | journal = Lancet II | year = 1892 | pages = 1180–1181}}</ref> Ozone was used during the [[World War I|First World War]] to disinfect [[wound]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stoker |first=George | title=The Surgical Uses of Ozone| journal =Lancet II | year = 1916 | page = 712 }}</ref>

== Proposed use and scientific evaluation ==

Ozone therapy consists of the introduction of ozone into the body via various methods, usually involving mixing of the ozone with various gases and liquids and injecting this into the body, including the [[vagina]], [[rectum]], [[intramuscular]] (in a muscle) or [[subcutaneously]] (under the skin).  Ozone can also be introduced via [[autohemotherapy]], in which blood is drawn from the patient, exposed to ozone and re-injected into the patient.<ref name=ACS/>

This therapy has been proposed for use in various diseases, including cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, [[arthritis]], [[heart disease]], [[Alzheimer's dementia]], among others. One proposed mechanism for its use in treating cancer comes from the proposed theory that cancer does not thrive or grow in a high oxygen environment, and the ozone therapy will increase oxygen in the body and therefore help treat the cancer.  There is no evidence to support this theory.<ref name = ACS/>  For treatment of HIV/AIDS, although ozone deactivates the viral particles [[in vitro|outside the body]], there is no evidence of benefits to living patients.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/oxygen.html | authorlink=Saul Green| title=Oxygenation Therapy: Unproven Treatments for Cancer and AIDS| publisher=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine | year = 1997 | last = Green | first = S }}</ref>

Summarizing the substantial and growing body of study results showing deleterious health effects of breathing ozone, in 1976, and reiterated in 2006, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) reflects the scientific consensus that ozone is a toxic gas which has, as yet, no demonstrated safe medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy. One possible reason, noted by the FDA, is that in order for ozone to be effective as a germicide, it must be present in a concentration far greater than can be safely tolerated by man or other animals.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=801.415 | title = Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Vol 8 section 801.415 | date = 2011-04-01 | accessdate = 2011-10-04 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food & Drug Administration]]}}</ref>

It is also noted that cinema projectionists who were exposed to excessive levels of ozone as a byproduct of the carbon arc lamps used in the projectors developed what was known as "Projectionists Lung". Ozone caused a deterioration of the lower lung membranes.<ref> {{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/apti/ozonehealth/population.html | title = Health Effects of Ozone in the General Population | accessdate= 2012-11-17 | publisher = US Environmental Protection Agency}}</ref>

A 1999 review concluded that "In the age of molecular medicine it is a real ‘act of [[faith]]’ to believe that ozone therapy might be a valid therapeutic option." <ref name=BCEO>{{cite journal|last=Bocci|first=V|title=Biological and clinical effects of ozone.

Ozone has been suggested for use in [[dentistry]], but the existing evidence does not support its use.<ref>{{cite pmid | 18166260}}</ref>

==Safety==

Much of the concern related to ozone therapy revolves around the safety of blood ozonation. It is well established that when inhaled by mammals, ozone reacts with compounds in tissues lining the lungs and triggers a cascade of pathological effects.  Saul Green has argued that since ozone has the capacity to oxidize organic compounds in an atmospheric environment, it should also logically oxidize blood components and [[endogenous]] human tissues.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/oxygen.html | authorlink=Green S | title=Oxygenation therapy: Unproven treatments for Cancer and AIDS | publisher=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine 1997}}</ref>  When infused into human blood, ozone produces [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) or [[free radical]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bocci V |title=Studies on the biological effects of ozone: 7.

High levels of inhaled ozone is known to be toxic, though single-dose inhalation of lower levels is not.<ref>{{cite pmid | 19260079}}</ref>

Serious complications reported from the use of this therapy include the development of [[hepatitis]] and also include five reported fatalities.<ref name=MJA/>
