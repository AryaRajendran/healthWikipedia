The '''European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)''' study is a [[Europe]]-wide prospective [[cohort study]] of the relationships between [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[cancer]], as well as other chronic diseases, such as [[cardiovascular disease]]. With over half a million participants, it is the largest study of diet and disease to be undertaken. 

EPIC is coordinated by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), part of the [[World Health Organization]], and funded by the 'Europe Against Cancer' programme of the [[European Commission]] as well as multiple nation-specific grants and charities. 

521,457 healthy adults, mostly aged 35–70 years, were enrolled in 23 centres in ten European countries: [[Denmark]] (11%), [[France]] (14%), [[Germany]] (10%), [[Greece]] (5%), [[Italy]] (9%), [[The Netherlands]] (8%), [[Norway]] (7%), [[Spain]] (8%), [[Sweden]] (10%) and the [[United Kingdom]] (17%). One UK centre (Oxford) recruited 27,000 [[vegetarian]]s and [[vegan]]s; this subgroup forms the largest study of this dietary group. Recruitment to the study took place between 1993 and 1999, and follow up is planned for at least ten years, with repeat interview/questionnaires every three to five years. The main prospective data collected are standardised dietary [[questionnaire]]s (self administered or interview based), seven-day food diaries, blood samples and [[anthropometric]] measurements, such as [[body mass index]] and [[Waist-hip ratio|waist-to-hip ratio]]. Additionally, the GenAir [[case-control study]] is studying the relationship of [[passive smoking]] and [[air pollution]] with cancers and [[respiratory disease]]s.

Up to 2004, there were over 26,000 new cases of cancer recorded among participants, with the most common being cancers of the breast, colorectum, prostate and lung. Current analyses are focusing particularly on [[stomach cancer|stomach]], [[colorectal cancer|colorectal]], [[breast cancer|breast]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]] and [[lung cancer|lung]] cancers. The different dietary patterns in the different countries should enable reliable associations to be made between particular diets and cancers. The analysis of stored blood samples should also allow dissection of genetic factors involved in cancers, as well as the effects of [[hormone]]s and hormone-like factors.

== Key findings ==
The study and its analysis is ongoing, but [http://www.srl.cam.ac.uk/epic/findings key results] of the study retrieved in 2008 are:
*Lowered sodium from salt intake, high potassium from fruit and vegetable consumption promote healthy blood pressure levels.
*High physical activity, involving some high impact activities is a good indicator of longevity and low risk of bone fractures
*High dietary fibre protects against bowel cancer
*Obesity increases a number of cancer risks
*High levels of sex hormones increase risk of breast cancer
*Increased fat intake increases the risk of breast cancer
*Increases in eating fruit and vegetables reduces the risk from all causes of an early death
*High blood glucose levels are associated with increased risk of heart disease.
*The combined impact of four behaviours – not smoking, being physically active, moderate alcohol intake and the consumption of at least five fruit and vegetable servings a day – was estimated to amount to 14 additional years of life (Khaw ''et al.'' 2008).

===2013===
A massive study conducted by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition and published in 2013 which followed over 400,000 subjects showed increased mortality among subjects that consumed [[processed meat]] regularly, and a smaller increase in mortality in those who consumed [[red meat]]. There was an increase in cardiovascular diseases, but also in cancer deaths.
