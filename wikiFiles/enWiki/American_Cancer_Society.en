The '''American Cancer Society''' ('''ACS''') is a nationwide voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer.

Established in 1913, the society is organized into twelve<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/AA/content/AA_1_2_ACS_Fact_Sheet.asp  American Cancer Society: Fact Sheet]</ref> geographical divisions of both medical and lay volunteers operating in more than 900 offices throughout the [[United States]], including [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name="charitynavigator.org">{{cite web|title=American Cancer Society|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=6495|publisher=Charity Navigator|accessdate=2007-12-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071219213310/http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=6495| archivedate= 19 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Its home office is located in the [[American Cancer Society Center]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. As the official journals the ACS publishes ''[[Cancer (journal)|Cancer]]'', ''CA: A Cancer Journal For Clinicians'' and ''Cancer Cytopathology''. <ref>{{cite web|title=Books and Journals|url=http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/BooksandJournals/index|accessdate=2011-07-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110623033247/http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/BooksandJournals/index| archivedate= 23 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The society was originally founded in 1913 by 15 physicians and businessmen in [[New York City]] under the name ''American Society for the Control of Cancer'' (''ASCC''). The current name was adopted in 1945.<ref> name="charitynavigator.org"</ref>

The sword symbol, adopted by the American Cancer Society in 1928, was designed by George E. Durant of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]]. According to Durant, the two serpents forming the handle represent the [[scientific]] and [[medical]] focus of the society’s mission and the blade expresses the “crusading spirit of the cancer control movement."<ref>{{cite web|title=ACS History|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/AA/content/AA_1_4_ACS_History.asp? |accessdate=2008-01-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080112014957/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/AA/content/AA_1_4_ACS_History.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-12}}</ref>

Its activities include providing grants to researchers, running public health [[advertising campaign]]s, and organizing projects such as the [[Relay For Life]] and the [[Great American Smokeout]].  It operates a series of thrift stores to raise money for its operations. Notable endorsements include the [[ 4K for Cancer]], a 4000-mile bike ride from [[Baltimore]] to [[San Francisco]] to raise money for the society's Hope Lodge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hope Lodge Baltimore|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/subsite/hopelodge/MD_Baltimore/bm_news_one.asp |accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref>

In 1994, the [[Chronicle of Philanthropy]], an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility conducted by  [[Nye Lavalle]] & Associates.  The study showed that the American Cancer Society was ranked as the 10th "most popular charity/non-profit in America" of over 100 charities researched with 38% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing Love and Like A lot for the American Cancer Society.<ref>The Charities Americans Like Most And Least, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, December 13, 1996 And USA Today, December 20, 1994, "Charity begins with health", FINAL 01D</ref>

The society’s allocation of funds for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2010, lists 72% of funds for Program Services (Patient Support 28%, Research 16%, Prevention 16%, Detection and Treatment 12%). The remaining 28% are allocated for supporting services (Fundraising 21%, and Management, General administration 7%) meeting the [[Better Business Bureau|Better Business Bureau's]] Standards for Charity Accountability (At least 65% to program services and no more than 35% to overhead and fundraising expenses).<ref>{{cite web|title=American Cancer Society Annual Report 2010|url=http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/WhoWeAre/AnnualReport/index|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>

John R. Seffrin, CEO of the American Cancer Society, received $2,401,112 salary/compensation from the charity for the 2009-2010 fiscal year.<ref>{{cite web|title= American Cancer Society - Charity Reports|url=http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/cancer/american-cancer-society-in-atlanta-ga-186/governance-and-staff| publisher=BBB|accessdate=2013-05-02| deadurl= no}}</ref> This is the second most money given by any charity to the head of that charity, according to [[Charity Watch]]. The money included $1.5 million in a retention benefit approved in 2001, “to preserve management stability.”<ref>{{citation | title=Charity Rating Guide and Watchdog Report | volume=59 |date=Dec 2011 | publisher=[[American Institute of Philanthropy]], "Charity Watch"}}</ref> 

The society has funded 46 [[Nobel Prize]] laureates including [[James D. Watson]], [[Mario Capecchi]], [[Oliver Smithies]], [[Paul Berg]], [[E. Donnall Thomas]], and [[Walter Gilbert]].<ref>{{cite web|title=American Cancer Society|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/RES/content/RES_7_6_Nobel_Prize_Winners.asp| publisher= Nobel Prize Winners|accessdate=2009-02-18| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090213201417/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/RES/content/RES_7_6_Nobel_Prize_Winners.asp| archivedate= 13 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Evaluations==

[[Charity Navigator]] rates the society two of four stars.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Cancer Society|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=6495|publisher=Charity Navigator|accessdate=2009-04-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090420082912/http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=6495| archivedate= 20 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> According to Charity Navigator the society is directed to "eliminating cancer" and destroying it.   The American Cancer Society's website contains a chronological listing of specific accomplishments in the fight against cancer, for example the unipod technological device of UTD, that the ACS had a hand in, including the funding of various scientists who went on to discover life-saving cancer treatments, and advocating for increased use of preventative techniques.<ref>{{cite web|title=ACS: Milestones|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/AA/content/AA_1_3_Milestones.asp?sitearea=&level=|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=2008-11-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081119194249/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/AA/content/AA_1_3_Milestones.asp?sitearea=&level=| archivedate= 19 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Scandals==

===New York embezzlement===
In the 1980s, an employee of a New York branch was indicted for a tax fraud scheme that allowed individuals to fraudulently claim contributions, much of which had been returned to them.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9504E6D9153BF93AA25751C1A963948260 Ex-Fund-Raiser At Cancer Society Indicted In $4 MillionTax Fraud].

===Ohio embezzlement===
In 2000, Dan Wiant, the chief administrative officer of the American Cancer Society of Ohio, pled guilty to embezzling $7 million from the organization.<ref name="birthplace">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=990CEFD7163EF932A25755C0A9669C8B63&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fA%2fAmerican%20Cancer%20Society Cancer Society Executive Surrenders to the F.B.I.].

===Lack of control over state affiliates===
[[File:Universal North Building.JPG|thumb|ACS offices in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In 1995, the Arizona chapter of the American Cancer Society was targeted for its extremely high overhead. Two economists, James Bennett and [[Thomas DiLorenzo]], issued a report analyzing the chapter's [[Form 990|financial statements]] and demonstrating that the Arizona chapter used about 95% of its donations for paying salaries and other overhead costs, resulting in a 22 to 1 ratio of overhead to actual money spent on the cause.  The report also asserted that the Arizona chapter's annual report had grossly misrepresented the amount of money spent on patient services, inflating it by more than a factor of 10.  The American Cancer Society responded by alleging that the two economists issuing the report were working for a group funded by the [[tobacco]] industry.<ref>{{citation | last= Dougherty | first = John | title=Charitable taking the Arizona division of the American Cancer Society eats up 95 percent of its budget with salaries and overhead.

==Criticisms==

===Declined participation of atheist organization in Relay For Life National Team program ===
The American Cancer Society was criticized for turning down participation from the Foundation Beyond Belief in its Relay For Life "National Team" program, worth more than $500,000. The ACS responded to the criticism by stating the "National Team" was to become a corporate sponsorship program and that non-profits and advocacy groups were no longer going to be included in this sponsorship program. This change in policy occurred after the ACS had already agreed that Foundation Beyond Belief could have a team under the Relay non-corporate National Team program. At least one non-profit organization was still on the National Team list after the ACS refused to allow the Foundation Beyond Belief to participate.<ref>http://www.proofform.com/en/component/content/article/204-atheism/16338-american-cancer-society-refuses-500000-from-atheists</ref><ref> {{citation | first = Piet | last = Levy | title = Atheists say cancer volunteering thwarted. | date = 3 Oct 2011 | magazine = [[The Christian Century]] | url = http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2011-10/atheists-say-cancer-volunteering-thwarted | publisher = Christian Century Foundation | issn = 0009-5281 | agency = [http://www.religionnews.com/ Religious News Service] | format = news article}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last=Christina | first=Greta | author-link=Greta Christina | title=Is atheist money too controversial for the American Cancer Society? | url=http://www.alternet.org/story/152685/is_atheist_money_too_controversial_for_the_american_cancer_society? | date=10 Oct 2011 | publisher=Independent Media Institute | magazine=[[AlterNet]] | format=news article |quote=The American Cancer Society may have turned down a potential half-million dollar donation because it came from a non-theistic organization. | accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last=Christina | first=Greta | author-link=Greta Christina | title=Atheism’s new clout. | url=http://www.salon.com/2012/05/11/atheisms_new_clout/ | date=11 May 2012 | magazine=[[Salon (website) | Salon]] | publisher=Salon Media Group, Inc. | quote=Non-believers are becoming increasingly successful fundraisers -- and cultural forces to be reckoned with. | accessdate=2 May 2013 | format=news article}}</ref>
