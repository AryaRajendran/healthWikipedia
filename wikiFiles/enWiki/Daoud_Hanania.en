== Family Background and Education ==
Daoud Hanania was born into a Greek Orthodox Christian [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian]] family originally hailed from Jerusalem, Palestine. His father, [[Anastas Hanania]], was a [[lawyer]] and [[politician]]. The Hananias lived in West Jerusalem until 1948. In the early 1950s they permanently moved to Amman, Jordan, where Hanania's father came to hold several cabinet positions in the Jordanian [[government]], including Foreign Minister, Minister of Justice, Minister for Refugees and Minister of Finance. Anastas Hanania was also Jordan's Ambassador to Great Britain from 1960–1966 and a Senator from 1968 to 1989 in Jordan's Upper House of Parliament.   

After completing his primary and secondary [[education]] in Jerusalem at al-Ummah College and the College des Frères, Daoud Hanania joined the Jordanian [[army]] at age 17. He was sent on a military [[scholarship]] to study [[medicine]] in [[England]] in 1951. Hanania earned his M.B.B.S. medical degree from St. Mary's Hospital Medical School of the [[University of London]] in 1957 (St. Mary's has since been incorporated into Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, also at the University of London).

Hanania subsequently became House Surgeon and Surgical Registrar at the Royal Northern Hospital in London from 1959-1961. He specialized in cardiovascular surgery and became a Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] in 1961 (F.R.C.S.), the [[American College of Surgeons]] in 1971 (F.A.C.S.), the [[American College of Cardiology]] in 1977 (F.A.C.C.), the International College of Angiology in 1979 (F.I.C.A.) and the Royal Society of Medicine in 1980. He also became an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] in 1980 (Hon. F.R.C.S.I.), the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]] in 1988 (Hon. F.R.C.S. Glasg) and the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] in 1989. 

Hanania trained under [[Dr. Michael DeBakey]] and [[Dr. Denton Cooley]] in Houston, Texas in the late 1960s while he was a Fellow in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery at Baylor University College of Medicine.

==Career==

Daoud Hanania performed the first open-heart surgery procedure in Jordan in 1970, the first heart-valve replacement in the country in 1972 as well as the first kidney transplant in the Arab world in the same year and the first coronary artery bypass in Jordan in 1973 and in Iraq some years later. But his most important achievement came in 1985 after performing the first ever successful cardiac transplant in the Middle East and the Arab world at the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=goQ1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=vjQDAAAAIBAJ&dq=daoud%20hanania&pg=4761%2C1817435 "Jordanian surgeon transplants heart", ''Associated Press''/''Rome News-Tribune,'' 11 August, 1985.]</ref> 

On the administrative level, Hanania was the Director of the King Hussein Medical Center (KHMC) from 1973-1976.

He was also Chief of Cardiovascular Surgery at KHMC from 1973–1992 and the Director General of the National Medical Institution from 1987-1989.

Today, Hanania has a private practice. He sees patients regularly at the new Hanania Center in Amman and performs cardiovascular surgery operations mostly at the Arab Medical Center and the Khalidi Medical Center and occasionally at the Islamic Hospital and the Amman Surgical Hospital.

== ''Newsweek'' Profile About Hanania (1982) ==
"Among Palestinians in Jordan, Dr. Daoud Hanania personifies Palestinian success. As director of medical services in the Jordanian armed forces and as chief of cardiovascular surgery at the King Hussein Medical Center, Hanania, 48, is one of the pre-eminent specialists in his field in the Middle East. He is one of the first in the region to perform open-heart surgery, a technique he learned under Dr. Michael E. DeBakey in Houston. He is distraught by the fighting in Beirut—partly because his sister lives there and refuses to move. "As a medical man, I am appalled by the suffering the Israelis are inflicting on an innocent population in Beirut," Hanania says. "I am a moderate, but seeing what the Israelis do makes people like me less moderate.

Hanania says that even if a Palestinian state were established on the West Bank, he would remain in Amman. But at heart he remains an exile. On clear nights, from the heart institute on the edge of Amman, he can see the lights of Jerusalem just 40 miles away. A Yemeni Jewish family now lives in the house where Hanania grew up, but like most Palestinians he has almost total recall of his former home. It had 13 rooms, was built of rose-colored stone and had a large garden containing an orchard and a vegetable patch. "Our house was just outside the city, and in 1948 there were skirmishes nearby," he recalls. "Many Palestinians around us left and finally we seemed to be the only ones around, so we left too, thinking we would be back soon." Hanania's two young children were born in Amman, but like their father they have no doubt about their roots. "If you ask my young son where he is from," says the doctor, "he will tell you, 'From Jerusalem'."
