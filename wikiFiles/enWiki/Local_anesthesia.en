'''Local anesthesia''' is any technique to induce the absence of [[sense|sensation]] in part of the body,<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/local+anesthesia thefreedictionary.com > local anesthesia] In turn citing: Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. Copyright 2009</ref> generally for the aim of inducing '''local analgesia''', that is, local insensitivity to [[pain]], although other local senses may be affected as well. It allows patients to undergo surgical and [[dentistry|dental]] procedures with reduced pain and distress.  In many situations, such as [[caesarean section|cesarean section]], it is safer and therefore superior to [[general anesthesia]].  It is also used for relief of non-surgical pain and to enable diagnosis of the cause of some chronic pain conditions.  [[Anesthetist]]s sometimes combine both general and local anesthesia techniques.

The following terms are often used interchangeably:

* ''Local anesthesia'', in a strict sense, is [[anesthesia]] of a small part of the body such as a tooth or an area of skin.
* ''[[Regional anesthesia]]'' is aimed at anesthetizing a larger part of the body such as a leg or arm.
* ''Conduction anesthesia'' is a comprehensive term, which encompasses a great variety of local and regional anesthetic techniques.

{{Main|Local anesthetic}}
A local anesthetic is a [[medication|drug]] that causes reversible local anesthesia and a loss of [[nociception]]. When it is used on specific nerve pathways ([[nerve block]]), effects such as [[analgesia]] (loss of [[pain]] sensation) and [[paralysis]] (loss of [[muscle]] power) can be achieved. Clinical local anesthetics belong to one of two classes: aminoamide and aminoester local anesthetics. Synthetic local anesthetics are structurally related to [[cocaine]]. They differ from cocaine mainly in that they have no abuse potential and do not act on the [[sympathoadrenergic system]], i.e. they do not produce [[hypertension]] or local [[vasoconstriction]], with the exception of [[Ropivacaine]] and [[Mepivacaine]] that do produce weak vasoconstriction.

Local anesthetics vary in their [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] properties and they are used in various techniques of local anesthesia such as:
* [[Topical anesthetic|Topical anesthesia]] (surface)
* [[Infiltration (medical)|Infiltration]]
* Plexus block
* [[Epidural|Epidural (extradural) block]]
* [[Spinal anaesthesia|Spinal anesthesia]] (subarachnoid block)

Adverse effects depend on the [[local anesthetic]] agent, method, and site of administration and is discussed in depth in the [[local anesthetic]] sub-article, but overall, adverse effects can be:
#localized prolonged [[anesthesia]] or [[paresthesia]] due to infection, [[hematoma]], excessive fluid pressure in a confined cavity, and severing of nerves & support tissue during injection,
#systemic reactions such as depressed [[central nervous system|CNS]] syndrome, allergic reaction, [[vasovagal episode]], and [[cyanosis]] due to [[local anesthetic toxicity]].
#lack of anesthetic effect due to infectious pus such as an [[abscess]].

==Non-medical local anesthetic techniques==
Local [[pain management]] that uses other techniques than [[analgesic]] medication include:
*[[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]], which has been found to be ineffective for [[lower back pain]], however, it might help with [[diabetic neuropathy]].<ref name=pmid20042705>{{Cite journal |author=Dubinsky RM, Miyasaki J |title=Assessment: efficacy of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in the treatment of pain in neurologic disorders (an evidence-based review): report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology |journal=Neurology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=173–6 |date=January 2010|pmid=20042705 |doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c918fc |url=}}</ref>
*[[Pulsed radiofrequency]], [[neuromodulation]], direct introduction of medication and nerve [[ablation]] may be used to target either the tissue structures and organ/systems responsible for persistent [[nociception]] or the [[nociceptors]] from the structures implicated as the source of chronic pain.<ref name="Varrassi G, Paladini A">{{cite journal |author=Varrassi G, Paladini A, Marinangeli F, Racz G |title=Neural modulation by blocks and infusions |journal=Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=34–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17309707 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-2500.2006.00056.x}}</ref><ref name="Meglio M.">{{cite journal |author=Meglio M |title=Spinal cord stimulation in chronic pain management |journal=Neurosurg.
