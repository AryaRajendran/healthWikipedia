'''Meningism''' is the triad of nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness), [[photophobia]] (intolerance of bright light) and [[headache]]. It is a [[medical sign|sign]] of irritation of the [[meninges]], such as seen in [[meningitis]], [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]s and various other diseases. ''"Meningismus"'' is the term used when the above listed symptoms are present without actual infection or inflammation; usually it is seen in concordance with other acute illnesses in the pediatric population.<ref>[http://www.icd9data.com/2007/Volume1/780-799/780-789/781/781.6.htm ICD9Data.com] - Diagnosis Codes, Meningismus</ref> Related clinical signs include Kernig's sign and three signs all named [[Brudzinski's sign]].

== Clinical signs ==
The main clinical signs that indicate meningism are ''nuchal rigidity'', ''Kernig's sign'' and ''Brudzinski's signs''. None of the signs are particularly sensitive; in adults with meningitis, nuchal rigidity was present in 30% and Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign only in 5%.<ref name=Thomas>{{cite journal |author=Thomas KE, Hasbun R, Jekel J, Quagliarello VJ |title=The diagnostic accuracy of Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's sign, and nuchal rigidity in adults with suspected meningitis |journal=Clin.

===Nuchal rigidity===
Nuchal rigidity is the inability to flex the [[neck]] forward due to rigidity of the neck muscles; if flexion of the neck is painful but full range of motion is present, nuchal rigidity is absent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Kernig's sign===
Kernig's sign (after [[Woldemar Kernig|Waldemar Kernig]] (1840–1917), a [[Baltic German]] neurologist) is positive when the thigh is bent at the hip and knee at 90 degree angles, and subsequent extension in the knee is painful (leading to resistance).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kernig VM | year=1882 | title=Ein Krankheitssymptom der acuten Meningitis | journal=St Petersb Med Wochensch | volume=7 | pages=398}}</ref> This may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis.<ref>{{cite book |author=O'Connor, Simon; Talley, Nicholas Joseph |title=Clinical Examination: A Systematic Guide to Physical Diagnosis |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2001|isbn=0-632-05971-0 | page=363}}</ref> Patients may also show [[opisthotonus]]—spasm of the whole body that leads to legs and head being bent back and body bowed backwards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===Brudzinski's signs===
{{See also|Brudziński neck sign}}
[[Józef Brudziński|Jozef Brudzinski]] (1874–1917), a [[Poles|Polish]] pediatrician, is credited with several signs in meningitis. The most commonly used sign ([[Brudzinski's neck sign]]) is the appearance of involuntary lifting of the legs when lifting a patient's head off the examining couch, with the patient lying [[Supine position|supine]].<ref name=Thomas/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Brudzinski J | year=1909 | title=Un signe nouveau sur les membres inférieurs dans les méningites chez les enfants (signe de la nuque) | journal=Arch Med Enf | volume=12 | pages=745–52}}</ref>

Other signs attributed to Brudzinski:<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|2299}}</ref>
* The symphyseal sign, in which pressure on the [[pubic symphysis]] leads to abduction of the leg and reflexive hip and knee flexion.<ref name=Brudzinski1916>{{cite journal | author=Brudzinski J | year=1916 | title=Über neue Symptome von Gehirnhautentzündung und -reizung bei Kindern, insbesondere bei tuberkulösen | journal=Berl Klin Wochensch | volume=53 | pages=686–90}}</ref>
* The cheek sign, in which pressure on the cheek below the [[zygoma]] leads to rising and flexion in the forearm.<ref name=Brudzinski1916/>
* Brudzinski's reflex, in which passive flexion of one knee into the abdomen leads to involuntary flexion in the opposite leg, and stretching of a limb that was flexed leads to contralateral extension.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Brudzinski J | year=1908 | title=Über die kontralateralen Reflexe an den unteren Extremitäten bei Kindern | journal=Wien Klin Wochensch | volume=8 | pages=255–61}}</ref>
