'''FOXP3''' ([[fork head domain|forkhead]] box P3) also known as '''scurfin''' is a [[protein]] involved in [[immune system]] responses. A member of the [[FOX proteins|FOX protein]] family, FOXP3 appears to function as a master [[Gene regulation|regulator]] (transcription factor) in the development and function of [[regulatory T cells]].<ref name="pmid17311282">{{cite journal | author = Zhang L, Zhao Y | title = The regulation of Foxp3 expression in regulatory CD4(+)CD25(+)T cells: multiple pathways on the road | journal = J.

While the precise control mechanism has not yet been established, FOX proteins belong to the forkhead/[[winged-helix]] family of [[transcriptional regulators]] and are presumed to exert control via similar [[DNA]] binding interactions during [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].  In regulatory T cell model systems, the FOXP3 transcription factor occupies the promoters of many important for regulatory T-cell function, and may repress transcription of key genes following stimulation of T cell receptors.<ref name="pmid17237765">{{cite journal | author = Marson A, Kretschmer K, Frampton GM, Jacobsen ES, Polansky JK, MacIsaac KD, Levine SS, Fraenkel E, von Boehmer H, Young RA | title = Foxp3 occupancy and regulation of key target genes during T-cell stimulation | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = 7130 | pages = 931–5 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17237765 | pmc = 3008159 | doi = 10.1038/nature05478  }}</ref>

== Structure ==

The human FOXP3 [[gene]]s contain 11 coding [[exons]]. Exon-[[intron]] boundaries are identical across the [[coding region]]s of the mouse and human genes. By genomic sequence analysis, the FOXP3 gene maps to the [[Locus (genetics)|''p'' arm]] of the [[X chromosome|X]] [[chromosome]] (specifically, X''p''11.23).<ref name="pmid10677306">{{cite journal | author = Bennett CL, Yoshioka R, Kiyosawa H, Barker DF, Fain PR, Shigeoka AO, Chance PF | title = X-Linked syndrome of polyendocrinopathy, immune dysfunction, and diarrhea maps to Xp11.23-Xq13.3 | journal = Am.

== Physiology ==

The discovery of Foxp3 as a specific marker of natural T regulatory cells ([[suppressor-inducer T cell|nTregs]], a lineage of [[T cell]]s) and adaptive/induced T regulatory (a/iTregs) T cells gave a molecular anchor to the population of regulatory T cells (Tregs), previously identified by non-specific markers such as CD25 or CD45RB.<ref name="pmid12522256">{{cite journal | author = Hori S, Nomura T, Sakaguchi S | title = Control of regulatory T cell development by the transcription factor Foxp3 | journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5609 | pages = 1057–61 | year = 2003 | month = February | pmid = 12522256 | doi = 10.1126/science.1079490 }}</ref><ref name="pmid12612578">{{cite journal | author = Fontenot JD, Gavin MA, Rudensky AY | title = Foxp3 programs the development and function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells | journal = Nat.

The induction or administration of Foxp3 positive T cells has, in animal studies, led to marked reductions in (autoimmune) disease severity in models of [[diabetes]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[asthma]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[thyroiditis]] and [[renal disease]].<ref name="pmid16838180">{{cite journal | author = Suri-Payer E, Fritzsching B | title = Regulatory T cells in experimental autoimmune disease | journal = Springer Semin.

Unfortunately recent T cell biology investigations revealed that T cell nature is much more plastic than initially thought. Thus the regulatory T cell therapy may in fact be very risky as the T regulatory cell transferred to the patient may reverse and become another proinflammatory T cell.(see recent papers from Romagnani, Stockinger etc.). Th17 (T helper 17) cells are proinflammatory and are produced under very similar environments as a/iTregs. Th17 cells are produced under the influence of TGF-β and IL-6 (or IL-21) whereas a/iTregs are produced under the influence of solely TGF-β and as such the difference between a proinflammatory and a pro-regulatory scenario is the presence of a single interleukin (IL-6 or IL-21 is being debated by immunology laboratories as the definitive signaling molecule). It seems so far that murine studies point to IL-6 whereas human studies have shown IL-21.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Pathophysiology ==

In human disease, alterations in numbers of regulatory T cells – and in particular those that express Foxp3 – are found in a number of disease states.  For example, patients with tumors have a local relative excess of Foxp3 positive T cells which inhibits the body's ability to suppress the formation of cancerous cells.<ref name="pmid16861339">{{cite journal | author = Beyer M, Schultze JL | title = Regulatory T cells in cancer | journal = Blood | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 804–11 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 16861339 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2006-02-002774  }}</ref> Conversely, patients with an [[autoimmune disease]] such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE) have a relative dysfunction of Foxp3 positive cells.<ref name="pmid16890406">{{cite journal | author = Alvarado-Sánchez B, Hernández-Castro B, Portales-Pérez D, Baranda L, Layseca-Espinosa E, Abud-Mendoza C, Cubillas-Tejeda AC, González-Amaro R | title = Regulatory T cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus | journal = J.

Genet. | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–1 | year = 2001 | month = January | pmid = 11137993 | doi = 10.1038/83713 }}</ref> These mutations were in the forkhead domain of FOXP3, indicating that the mutations may disrupt critical [[DNA]] interactions.

In mice, a Foxp3 mutation (a [[frameshift mutation]] that result in protein lacking the forkhead domain) is responsible for 'Scurfy', an X-linked recessive mouse mutant that results in lethality in hemizygous males 16 to 25 days after birth.<ref name="Brunkow_2001"/> These mice have overproliferation of [[Cluster of differentiation|CD]]4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes, extensive multiorgan infiltration, and elevation of numerous [[cytokine]]s. This [[phenotype]] is similar to those that lack expression of [[CTLA-4]], [[TGF-beta|TGF-β]], human disease IPEX, or deletion of the Foxp3 gene in mice ("scurfy mice"). The pathology observed in scurfy mice seems to result from an inability to properly regulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activity. In mice overexpressing the Foxp3 gene, fewer T cells are observed. The remaining T cells have poor proliferative and cytolytic responses and poor [[interleukin-2]] production, although [[Thymus|thymic]] development appears normal. [[Histology|Histologic]] analysis indicates that [[Lymphatic system#Lymphoid tissue|peripheral lymphoid organs]], particularly [[lymph node]]s, lack the proper number of cells.
