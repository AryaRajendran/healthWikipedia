== Medical uses ==
[[File:Seroquel-25mg.jpg|thumb|Quetiapine (Seroquel) 25 mg tablets, next to [[Penny (United States coin)|US one-cent]] coin for comparison.]]
Quetiapine fumarate is used to treat either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=quetiapine-fumarate|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/quetiapine-fumarate.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

Quetiapine is one of the most well tolerated neuroleptics of other atypical antipsychotics by reducing the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. In low doses (50-100 milligrams), the drug acts as a selective histamine H1 blocker as well as antagonizing the alpha-adrenoreceptors. In higher doses, quetiapine attaches to autoreceptors.    

In the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has approved quetiapine for the treatment of [[schizophrenia]] and of acute [[mania|manic]] episodes associated with [[bipolar disorder]] ([[Bipolar disorder#Manic episodes|bipolar mania]]) and for treatment of [[Bipolar disorder#Depressive episodes|bipolar depression]].<ref name = "Off-label">{{cite web | url = http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/April/10-civ-487.html | title = Pharmaceutical Giant AstraZeneca to Pay $520 Million for Off-label Drug Marketing | publisher = Justice news, US Department of Justice | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}</ref> In 2009, quetiapine XR was approved as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guzman|first=F|title=Quetiapine Indications: FDA-Approved and Off-label Uses|url=http://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/antipsychotics/quetiapine/quetiapine-indications/|publisher=Psychopharmacology Institute|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>

Quetiapine is also used  [[off-label]] for [[aggression]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[anger management]], [[anxiety]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[Bipolar disorder#Management|bipolar maintenance]], [[dementia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[mood disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[suicidal ideation]] and [[sleeplessness]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In April 2010, AstraZeneca settled a longstanding U. S. Department of Justice investigation into its aggressive marketing of Seroquel for such off-label uses with a $520 million dollar fine.<ref name="Off-label"/> According to the Department of Justice, "the company recruited doctors to serve as authors of articles that were ghostwritten by medical literature companies and about studies the doctors in question did not conduct. AstraZeneca then used those studies and articles as the basis for promotional messages about unapproved uses of Seroquel."<ref name="Off-label"/>

===Schizophrenia===
It is debatable whether, as a class, [[typical antipsychotics|typical]] or [[atypical antipsychotics]] are better.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Kane JM, Correll CU |title=Pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia |journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci |volume=12|issue=3 |pages=345–57 |year=2010 |pmid=20954430}}</ref> Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages.<ref name=AFP07>{{vcite journal |author=Schultz SH, North SW, Shields CG |title=Schizophrenia: a review |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=75 |issue=12 |pages=1821–9 |year=2007 |month=June|pmid=17619525}}</ref>

===Bipolar disorder===
In those with [[bipolar disorder]], it is used for depressive episodes, acute manic episodes associated with [[bipolar I disorder]] (as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]], [[Valproic acid|valproate]] or [[lamotrigine]]), and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (as adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex).<ref name="Thase MacFadden Weisler Chang et al : Efficacy of Quetiapine Monotherapy in Bipolar I and II Depression">{{cite doi|10.1097/01.jcp.0000248603.76231.b7}}</ref>

===Alzheimer's===
Quetiapine is ineffective in reducing agitation among people with [[Alzheimer's]], whose usage of the drug once constituted 29% of sales. Quetiapine worsens cognitive functioning in the elderly with dementia<ref name="Ballard Margallo-Lana Juszczak Douglas et al : Quetiapine and rivastigmine and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial">{{cite doi|10.1136/bmj.38369.459988.8F}}</ref> and therefore is not recommended.

===Other===
It is sometimes used [[off-label]], often as an augmentation agent, to treat conditions such as [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[autism]], [[alcoholism]], [[borderline personality disorder]], [[Charles Bonnet Syndrome]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]],<ref name="Croissant Klein Gehrlein Kniest et al : Quetiapine in relapse prevention in alcoholics suffering from craving and affective symptoms: a case series">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.eurpsy.2006.04.007

==Adverse effects==
The most common [[adverse effect|side-effect]] of quetiapine is [[somnolence]]. Other common side-effects include: sluggishness, fatigue, dry mouth, sore throat, dizziness, abdominal pain, constipation, upset stomach, [[orthostatic hypotension]], inflammation or swelling of the sinuses or pharynx, blurred vision, increased appetite, and weight gain.  [[Hypothyroidism]] has been seen in up to 5% of patients with various effects on levels of [[TSH]], [[T4]] and [[T3]].<ref name = Seroquel>{{Cite journal|author=[[AstraZeneca]]|id=276521 |title=Seroquel (quietapine fumarate) tablets |url=http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/Seroquel.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref>

Uncommon side effects include bruises, disturbance in speech and language, and/or frightening hallucinations. Mouth ulcers are a rare side effect. Very rare side effects reported were rapid swelling of the skin around the eyes, which increased the appearance of skin ageing.<ref>http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/Seroquel.pdf</ref>

There is an emerging controversy regarding quetiapine fatalities. The deaths of at least six U.S. military veterans who were given drug cocktails including quetiapine<ref>{{cite web|author=AlterNet / By Martha Rosenberg |url=http://www.alternet.org/world/145892/are_veterans_being_given_deadly_cocktails_to_treat_ptsd?page=entire |title=Are Veterans Being Given Deadly Cocktails to Treat PTSD? &#124; World |publisher=AlterNet |date=2010-03-06 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref> have been attributed to its inclusion by military doctors to treat PTSD.

It is marketed as one of the most sedating of all anti-psychotics, although those claims are contested.<ref name="WSP">{{cite news|title=A Silenced Drug Study Creates An Uproar|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2009-03-18|author=Shankar Vedantam|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/17/AR2009031703786.html}}</ref> Beginning users may feel extremely tired and 'out of it' for the first few days, and sometimes longer. Quetiapine's newest indication, for bipolar depression, usually specifically calls for the entire dose to be taken before bedtime due to its sedative effects. The sedative effects may disappear after some time on the drug, or with a change of dosage, and with possibly different, non-sedative side-effects emerging.

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause [[tardive dyskinesia]].<ref name=TD08>{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=CU|coauthors=Schenk, EM|title=Tardive dyskinesia and new antipsychotics.|journal=Current opinion in psychiatry|date=2008 Mar|volume=21|issue=2|pages=151–6|pmid=18332662|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3282f53132}}</ref> According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%.<ref name=TD08/> Although Quetiapine and Clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Aia P.G. | year = 2011 | title = Tardive Dyskinesia | url = | journal = Current treatment options in neurology | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 231–241 }}</ref>

Weight gain can be a problem for some patients. Quetiapine has been found to cause more weight gain than [[fluphenazine]], [[haloperidol]], [[loxapine]], [[molindone]], [[olanzapine]], [[pimozide]], [[risperidone]], [[thioridazine]], [[thiothixene]], [[trifluoperazine]], and [[ziprasidone]], but less than [[chlorpromazine]], [[clozapine]], [[perphenazine]], and [[sertindole]] when calculated according to a [[fixed effects model]].<ref>[http://altcancerweb.com/bipolar/weight-gain/antipsychotic-induced-weight-gain-1999.pdf Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain: A Comprehensive Research Synthesis] Am J Psychiatry 1999;156:1686-1696.</ref>

Studies conducted on [[beagle]]s have resulted in the formation of [[cataract]]s.  While there are reports of cataracts occurring in humans, controlled studies including thousands of patients have not demonstrated a clear causal association between quetiapine therapy and this side-effect.{{Citation needed|reason=Reference needed to April 2006 results of CATIE study.|date=September 2011}} However, the Seroquel website<ref>[http://www.seroquel.com/ Seroquel website]</ref> still recommends users have eye examinations every six months.

As with some other anti-psychotics, quetiapine may lower the [[seizure threshold]],<ref>[http://www.astrazeneca-us.com/cgi-bin/az_pi.cgi?product=seroquel&country=us&popup=no Seroquel Prescribing Information]</ref> and should be taken with caution in combination with drugs such as [[bupropion]].

A recent comparative study of anti-psychotics drugs has found that quetiapine mono treatment was associated with increased risk of death relative to the other analyzed treatments (but still better than no anti-psychotics drug treatment at all).<ref name="Tiihonen Lönnqvist Wahlbeck Klaukka et al : 11-year follow-up of mortality in patients with schizophrenia: a population-based cohort study (FIN11 study)">{{cite doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60742-X}}</ref>

===Discontinuation===
Quetiapine should be discontinued gradually, with careful consideration from the prescribing doctor, to avoid withdrawal symptoms or relapse.

The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing anti-psychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.<ref name="Group 2009 192"/> Due to compensatory changes at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic and histamine receptor sites in the central nervous system, withdrawal symptoms can occur during abrupt or over-rapid reduction in dosage. However, despite increasing demand for safe and effective antipsychotic withdrawal protocols or dose-reduction schedules, no specific guidelines with proven safety and efficacy are currently available.

Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of antipsychotics include nausea, [[emesis]], lightheadedness, [[diaphoresis]], [[dyskinesia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], [[insomnia]], nervousness, dizziness, headache, excessive non-stop crying, and [[anxiety]].<ref name="Kim-2005"/><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Michaelides | first1 = C. | last2 = Thakore-James | first2 = M. | last3 = Durso | first3 = R. | title = Reversible withdrawal dyskinesia associated with quetiapine | journal = Mov Disord | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 769–70 | month = Jun | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1002/mds.20427 | pmid = 15747370 }}</ref> According to Eli Lilly internal documents, discontinuation of atypical neuroleptics similar to seroquel can also cause psoriasis, gingivitis and other inflammatory conditions, dyspepsia, headache, high blood sugar and other health conditions unrelated to psychiatric condition.[http://nonpsychiatry.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/7-zy397116.pdf][http://nonpsychiatry.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/8-zy621218.pdf] Some have argued that additional somatic and psychiatric symptoms associated with dopaminergic super-sensitivity, including dyskinesia and acute psychosis, are common features of withdrawal in individuals treated with neuroleptics.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Chouinard | first1 = G. | last2 = Jones | first2 = BD. | title = Neuroleptic-induced supersensitivity psychosis: clinical and pharmacologic characteristics | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=157922  |

===Overdosage===
Most instances of acute overdosage result only in sedation, hypotension and tachycardia, but cardiac arrythmia, coma and death have occurred in adults. Serum or plasma quetiapine concentrations are usually in the 1–10&nbsp;mg/L range in overdose survivors, while postmortem blood levels of 10–25&nbsp;mg/L are generally observed in fatal cases.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1355–1357.</ref>

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Pregnancy risk factor C. Drug is toxic to fetus and embryo but have not shown any effect with animals. Long term exposure on infant development is still very unknown, however use in third trimester has risk for abnormal muscle movements and withdrawal symptoms. In newborns, symptoms that may occur are agitation, feeding disorder, hypertonia, hypotonia, respiratory distress, somnolence, and tremor. Hospitalization may be required. During lactation, drug enters breast milk and is not recommended to be taken.<ref>{{cite web|title=QUEtiapine|url=http://0-online.lexi.com.wildpac.wne.edu/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/7598#f_pregnancy-and-lactation|publisher=Lexi-Comp|accessdate=18 October 2012|location=Hudson, OH|year=2012}}</ref>

This means Quetiapine is a [[dopamine antagonist|dopamine]], [[serotonin antagonist|serotonin]], and [[adrenergic antagonist|adrenergic]] antagonist, and a potent [[antihistamine]] with clinically negligible [[anticholinergic]] properties. Quetiapine binds strongly to serotonin receptors,the drug acts as [[partial agonist]] at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guzman|first=F|title=Mechanism of action of quetiapine|url=http://psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/antipsychotics/quetiapine/mechanism-of-action/|publisher=Psychopharmacology Institute|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref> Serial PET scans evaluating the D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy of quetiapine have demonstrated that quetiapine very rapidly disassociates from the D<sub>2</sub> receptor.<ref>{{Cite journal| title =Does fast dissociation from the dopamine d(2) receptor explain the action of atypical antipsychotics?:a new hypothesis| url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/3/360| pmid =11229973| doi =10.1176/appi.ajp.158.3.360| year =2001| author =Kapur, S.| journal =American Journal of Psychiatry| volume =158| pages =360&ndash;369| last2 =Seeman| first2 =P| issue =3}}</ref> Theoretically, this allows for normal physiological surges of dopamine to elicit normal effects in areas such as the [[nigrostriatal]] and [[tuberoinfundibular]] pathways, thus minimizing the risk of side-effects such as pseudo-parkinsonism as well as elevations in [[prolactin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Seeman P |title=Atypical antipsychotics: mechanism of action |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=47|issue=1| pages=27–38 |year=2002 |pmid=11873706}}</ref>
Some of the antagonized receptors (serotonin, norepinephrine) are actually [[autoreceptor]]s whose blockade tends to increase the release of neurotransmitters.

Norquetiapine is the active metabolite of quetiapine. It has most of the effects of quetiapine with similar potencies, and is also a potent [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] and [[muscarinic antagonist]]. Note that the data below is from another source (the official prescribing info for Seroquel), and the measure is different from the above (Ki vs. IC<sub>50</sub>). There are still order-of-magnitude discrepancies for D<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>1</sub>, H<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>1</sub>.

==Synthesis==

The synthesis of quetiapine begins with a dibenzothiazepinone. The [[lactam]] is first treated with [[phosphoryl chloride]] to produce a [[dibenzothiazepine]]. A [[nucleophilic substitution]] is used to introduce the sidechain.<ref>Warawa, E. J.; Migler, B. M.; 1988, {{US Patent|4879288}}.</ref>
[[File:Quetiapine syn.png|600px|center]]

==Dosage==
At very low doses quetiapine acts primarily as a histamine receptor blocker (antihistamine) and [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]] blocker. When the dose is increased quetiapine activates the adrenergic system and binds strongly to serotonin receptors and [[autoreceptor]]s. At high doses quetiapine starts blocking significant amounts of dopamine receptors.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(00)00911-5|title=Binding of antipsychotic drugs to human brain receptors focus on newer generation compounds|journal=Life Sciences|date=November 2000|volume=68|issue=1|pages=29–39|author=E.

Due to compensatory changes at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic and histamine receptor sites in the central nervous system, a gradual reduction in dosage is recommended to minimise or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of quetiapine include: [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], [[emesis]], [[lightheadedness]], [[diaphoresis]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], as well as [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[dizziness]], [[headache]], and [[anxiety]]. The present evidence suggests that these symptoms affect a small number of susceptible individuals treated with quetiapine.<ref name="Kim-2005">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = DR. | last2 = Staab | first2 = JP. | title = Quetiapine discontinuation syndrome | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/162/5/1020 | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 162 | issue = 5 | page = 1020 | month = May | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.1020 | pmid = 15863814 }}</ref>

===Sustained-release===
AstraZeneca submitted a [[new drug application]] for a [[sustained-release]] version of quetiapine in the [[United States of America|United States]], [[Canada]], and the [[European Union]] in the second half of 2006 for treatment of schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=[[AstraZeneca]]|url=http://www.astrazeneca.com/pressrelease/5256.aspx|title=AstraZeneca Submits an NDA For Sustained Release Formulation Seroquel XR.

The sustained-release quetiapine is marketed mainly as Seroquel XR. Other marketing names are Seroquel Prolong and Seroquel Depot.

On May 18, 2007, AstraZeneca announced that the U.S. FDA approved Seroquel XR for acute treatment of schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=[[AstraZeneca]]|url=http://www.astrazeneca.com/pressrelease/5330.aspx|title=FDA Approves AstraZeneca’s Once-Daily SEROQUEL XR Extended-Release Tablets For The Treatment Of Schizophrenia|date=2007-05-18|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> During its 2007 Q2 earnings conference, AstraZeneca announced plans to launch Seroquel XR in the U.S. during August 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=[[AstraZeneca]]|url=http://www.astrazeneca.com/pressrelease/5341.aspx|title=Second Quarter and Half Year Results 2007|date=2007-07-26|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> However, Seroquel XR has only become available in U.S. pharmacies after the FDA approved Seroquel XR for use as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia, in addition to acute treatment of the illness, on November 16, 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=[[AstraZeneca]]|url=http://www.astrazeneca.com/pressrelease/5360.aspx|title=Seroquel XR Receives Approval from FDA for Maintenance Treatment of Schizophrenia|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> The company has not provided a reason for the delay of Seroquel XR's launch.

[[Health Canada]] approved sale of Seroquel XR on September 27, 2007.<ref>[http://cpe0013211b4c6d-cm0014e88ee7a4.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com/NocWeb/viewnoce.jsp?noc=kilh Notice of Compliance Information - Seroquel XR] September 27, 2007, retrieved December 3, 2007</ref>

The FDA approved Seroquel XR for the treatment of bipolar depression and bipolar mania in early October, 2008. According to AstraZeneca, Seroquel XR is "the first medication approved by the FDA for the once-daily acute treatment of both depressive and manic episodes associated with bipolar."

On July 31, 2008, Handa Pharmaceuticals, based in Fremont, California, announced that its abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets, the generic version of AstraZeneca’s SEROQUEL XR, has been accepted by the FDA.

On December 1, 2008, [[Biovail]] announced that the FDA had accepted the company's ANDA to market its own version of sustained-release quetiapine.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=[[Biovail]]|url=http://www.biovail.com/english/Investor%20Relations/Latest%20News/default.asp?s=1&state=showrelease&releaseid=1230930|title=Biovail Announces Filing of ANDA for Quetiapine XR Tablets|date=2008-12-01|date=2008-12-28}}</ref> Biovail's sustained-release tablets will compete with AstraZeneca's Seroquel XR.

On December 24, 2008, AstraZeneca notified shareholders that the FDA had asked for additional information on the company's application to expand the use of sustained-release quetiapine for treatment of depression.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=[[AstraZeneca]]|url=http://www.astrazeneca.com/media/latest-press-releases/seroquel-MDD-FDA-response?itemId=4477598|title=AstraZeneca Receives FDA Complete Response Letter on Seroquel XR for Major Depressive Disorder|date=2008-12-24|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref>

==Legal status==

Quetiapine received its initial indication from U.S. FDA for treatment of schizophrenia in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=QUETIAPINE FUMARATE|work=Electronic Orange Book|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|date=April 2007|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=020639&TABLE1=OB_Rx|accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>  In 2004, it received its second indication for the treatment of mania-associated bipolar disorder.<ref>{{cite press release| publisher=[[AstraZeneca]]|date=2004-01-13

}}</ref> In 2007 and 2008, studies were conducted on quetiapine’s efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. In April 2009, the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA held a public meeting to discuss whether study results supported the FDA's approval for anxiety and depression, with risks of metabolic side-effects and of tardive dyskinesia and sudden cardiac death.<ref>{{cite web| title = April 7–8, 2009: Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting Announcement| url = http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/ucm136250.htm| accessdate = 2009-08-27}}</ref>

===Controversy===
AstraZeneca has been sued by the U.S. (resulting from a [[Qui Tam]] lawsuit filed by [[Stefan P. Kruszewski]]) government over the marketing of quetiapine. A $520 million settlement was reached on October 29, 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|last = Wilson | first = Duff | title = AstraZeneca Pays Millions to Settle Seroquel Cases | newspaper = New York Times | date = 2009-10-29 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/30/business/30drug.html | accessdate = 2010-03-09}}</ref>

In Australia, Professor [[Patrick McGorry]], a key mental health adviser proposed a trial in Melbourne in 2011. It was to investigate whether Seroquel would decrease or delay the risk of people aged between 15 and 40 with early signs of mental illness, developing a later psychotic disorder. However in July 2011 psychiatrists, psychologists and researchers from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Britain and the US lodged a complaint with the ethics committee of Melbourne Health. They opposed the trial<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/mcgorry-aborts-teen-drug-trial-20110820-1j3k1.html Sydney Morning Herald]</ref> as "unethical" and "dangerous".

In 2009, documents unsealed in litigation against AstraZeneca indicated that Dr. Charles Schulz, Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Minnesota and a consultant for AstraZeneca, had misrepresented the benefits of Seroquel in research presentations and press releases.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maura Lerner and Janet Moore|title=Once-secret drug-company records put U on the spot|url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=41470522|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=March 19, 2009}}</ref>

===Recreational use===
Quetiapine is not classified as a controlled substance, "abusive self-administration seems to be driven by quetiapine’s sedative and [[anxiolytic]] effects (to help with sleep or to 'calm down') rather than by its antipsychotic properties."<ref>{{cite web|title=Intranasal Quetiapine Abuse|author=Joseph M.

Wirshing, M.D.|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/161/9/1718|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}</ref> Reports of quetiapine abuse have emerged in the medical literature. In addition to oral administration, the drug is also taken intranasally by snorting pulverized tablets ([[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]]). There have been reports of intravenous abuse and intravenous co-administration with [[cocaine]] as well.<ref name="Brian M. Waters and Kaustubh G.

A letter to the editor that appeared in the January 2007 ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' has proposed a “need for additional studies to explore the addiction-potential of quetiapine”. The letter reports that its authors are physicians who work in the Ohio correctional system. They report that “prisoners ... have threatened legal action and even [[suicide]] when presented with discontinuation of quetiapine” and that they have “not seen similar drug-seeking behavior with other second-generation antipsychotics of comparable efficacy”. It has also been reported that when Seroquel is used with [[methadone]] it causes the user to experience a buzz, or opioid euphoria.<ref name="Pinta Taylor : Quetiapine Addiction?">{{cite doi|10.1176/appi.ajp.164.1.174}}</ref>

===Nurofen Plus tampering case===
In August 2011 the UK's [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) issued a class 4 drug alert following reports that some batches of [[Nurofen|Nurofen plus]] contained Seroquel XL instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON126226 |title=Press releases |publisher=MHRA |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref>

Following the issue of the Class 4 Drug Alert, Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd received further reports of rogue blister strips in cartons of two additional batches of Nurofen Plus tablets. One of the new batches contained Seroquel XL 50&nbsp;mg tablets and one contained the Pfizer product [[Neurontin]] 100&nbsp;mg capsules.

Following discussions with the MHRA's Defective Medicines Report Centre (DMRC), Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd decided to recall all remaining unexpired stock of Nurofen Plus tablets in any pack size leading to a Class 1 Drug Alert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/Safetywarnings/DrugAlerts/CON126268 |title=Drug Alerts |publisher=MHRA |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref>
