==Etymology==
[[File:Dermatology treatment.jpg|thumb|Student performing a simple dermatological treatment at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]].]]
Coined in English 1819, the word ''dermatology'' originated in the form of the words ''dermologie'' (in French, 1764) and, a little later, ''dermatologia'' (in Latin, 1777).<ref name="Fitz">Freedberg, et al. (2003). ''Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine''. (6th ed.).  McGraw-Hill Professional. Page 3. ISBN 0-07-138076-0.</ref> The term derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "δέρματος" (''dermatos''), genitive of "δέρμα" (''derma''), "skin"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dde%2Frma δέρμα],

== History ==
{{Main|History of dermatology}}
Readily visible alterations of the skin surface have been recognized since the dawn of history, with some being treated, and some not.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  In 1801 the first great school of dermatology became a reality at the famous [[Hôpital Saint-Louis]] in Paris, while the first textbooks (Willan's, 1798–1808) and atlases ([[Jean-Louis-Marc Alibert|Alibert's]], 1806–1814) appeared in print during the same period of time.<ref name="Fitz" />

== Training ==
 {{globalize/USA|date=November 2012}}
After earning a medical degree ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]), the length of training in the United States for a general dermatologist to be eligible for Board Certification by the American Academy of Dermatology, [[American Board of Dermatology]] or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology]] is a total of four years.  This training consists of an initial medical or surgical intern year followed by a three-year dermatology residency.<ref name="aad.org" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abderm.org/residency.html |title=American Board of Dermatology |publisher=Abderm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Creative Innovations |url=http://www.aocd.org/qualify/board_certification.html |title=American Osteopathic College of Dermatology - Qualifications Overview |publisher=Aocd.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>
Following this training, one- or two- year post-residency fellowships are available in [[immunodermatology]], [[phototherapy]], [[laser medicine]], [[Mohs micrographic surgery]], [[cosmetic surgery]] or [[dermatopathology]].  For the past several years, dermatology residency positions in the United States have been one of the most competitive to obtain.<ref name="most competitive">{{cite web|url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/93/editorial/residency/wu2.html|title="...has been the most competitive of all specialties for at least the last 5-6 years."

== Subspecialties ==
=== Cosmetic dermatology ===
[[File:Obagijf1938.JPG|thumb|A Cosmetic dermatology in [[SM City North Edsa]], Philippines]]
Dermatologists have been leaders in the field of cosmetic surgery.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology'' (10th ed.). Saunders. Page 895. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>  Some dermatologists complete fellowships in surgical dermatology.  Many are trained in their residency on the use of [[botox]], fillers, and laser surgery.  Some dermatologists perform cosmetic procedures including [[liposuction]], [[blepharoplasty]], and [[face lift]]s.<ref>[http://www.derm.net/sv_cosmetic_surgery.shtml ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daytonskinsurgery.org/fellowship.html |title=Dayton Skin Care Specialists: Fellowship Information |publisher=Daytonskinsurgery.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UC Davis Health System, Department of Dermatology |url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/dermatology/education/fellowship.html |title=ACGMC Procedural Dermatology Fellow |publisher=Ucdmc.ucdavis.edu |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> Most dermatologists limit their cosmetic practice to minimally invasive procedures.  Despite an absence of formal guidelines from the [[American Board of Dermatology]], many cosmetic fellowships are offered in both surgery and laser medicine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=== Dermatopathology ===
A dermatolopathologist is a [[pathologist]] or dermatologist who specializes in the [[pathology]] of the skin.  This field is shared by dermatologists and pathologists.  Usually a dermatologist or pathologist will complete one year of dermatopathology fellowship.  This usually includes six months of general pathology, and six months of dermatopathology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uwpathology.org/academics/residency/fellowship/DermGoals.pdf |title=DRAFT |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>  Alumni of both specialties can qualify as dermatopathologists.  At the completion of a standard residency in dermatology, many dermatologists are also competent at dermatopathology.  Some dermatopathologists qualify to sit for their examinations by completing a residency in dermatology and one in pathology.<ref name="abderm.org">[http://www.abderm.org/qualification.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

=== Immunodermatology ===
This field specializes in the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases such as [[lupus]], [[bullous pemphigoid]], [[pemphigus vulgaris]], and other immune-mediated skin disorders.<ref name="abderm.org" /><ref>[http://www.mayo.edu/msgme/immunderm-rch.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>  Specialists in this field often run their own immunopathology labs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Mohs surgery===
The dermatologic subspecialty called [[Mohs surgery]] focuses on the excision of skin cancers using a tissue-sparing technique that allows intraoperative assessment of 100% of the peripheral and deep tumor margins developed in the 1930s by Dr. [[Frederic E. Mohs]].  The procedure is defined as a type of [[CCPDMA]] processing. Physicians trained in this technique must be comfortable with both pathology and surgery, and dermatologists receive extensive  training in both during their residency.  Physicians who perform Mohs surgery can receive training in this specialized technique during their dermatology residency, but many will seek additional training either through preceptorships to join the American Society for Mohs Surgery<ref>http://www.mohssurgery.org/New/Patient_publicResources/PhysicianTraining.html</ref> or through formal one- to two-year Mohs surgery fellowship training programs administered by the American College of Mohs Surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mohscollege.org/acms/difference.php |title=The Mohs College Difference |publisher=Mohscollege.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>

=== Pediatric dermatology ===
Physicians can qualify for this specialization by completing both a pediatric residency and a dermatology residency.  Or they might elect to complete a post-residency fellowship.<ref>[http://www.abderm.org/subspecialties/pediatric.htm ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>  This field encompasses the complex diseases of the [[neonate]]s, hereditary skin diseases or [[genodermatosis|genodermatoses]], and the many difficulties of working with the [[pediatric]] population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=== Teledermatology ===
[[Teledermatology]] is a form of dermatology where telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information via all kinds of media (audio, visual and also data communication, but typically photos of dermatologic conditions) usually made by non-dermatologists for evaluation off-site by dermatologists).<ref>Burg G, Soyer H.P, Chimenti S.

Brown, M.L.S., OregonHealthSciencesUniversity [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=225996&blobtype=pdf Teledermatology: one application of telemedicine]</ref>
This subspecialty deals with options to view skin conditions over a large distance to provide [[knowledge exchange]],<ref>[http://www.dermnetnz.org/ DermNet NZ: the dermatology resource]</ref> to establish second-opinion services for experts<ref>[http://www.telederm.org/ The Community for Dermatology | Teledermatology]</ref> or to use this for follow-up of individuals with chronic skin conditions.<ref>Ebner et al. 2006 e&i</ref><ref>H.

== Therapies ==
[[File:Dermatology treatment.jpg|thumb|Facial cleansing pores in Meditec at ITESM CCM(2012)]]
Therapies provided by dermatologists include, but not restricted to:
* Cosmetic filler injections
* [[Hair removal]] with [[laser]] or other modalities
* Hair [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]] – a cosmetic procedure practiced by many dermatologists.
* Intralesional treatment – with steroid or [[chemotherapy]].
* [[Laser therapy]] – for both the management of birth marks, skin disorders (like [[vitiligo]]), [[Tattoo removal]], and cosmetic resurfacing and rejuvenation.
* [[Photodynamic therapy]] – for the treatment of [[skin cancer]] and precancerous growths.
* [[Phototherapy]] – including the use of narrowband UVB, broadband UVB, psoralen and UVB.
* [[Tattoo removal]] with laser.
* [[Tumescent technique|Tumescent liposuction]] – liposuction was invented by a [[gynecology|gynecologist]].  A dermatologist (Dr. [[Jeffrey A. Klein]]) adapted the procedure to local infusion of dilute anesthetic called tumescent liposuction.  This method is now widely practiced by dermatologists, plastic surgeons and gynecologists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/lstartinventions/a/liposuction.htm |title=Liposuction - Who Invented Liposuction? |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>
* [[Cryosurgery]] – for the treatment of warts, skin cancers, and other dermatosis.
* [[Radiation therapy]] – although rarely practiced by dermatologists, many dermatologist continue to provide radiation therapy in their office.
* [[Vitiligo surgery]] – Including procedures like autologous melanocyte transplant, suction blister grafting and punch grafting.
* [[Allergy testing]] –  'Patch testing' for contact dermatitis.
* Systemic therapies – including antibiotics, immunomodulators, and novel injectable products.
* Topical therapies – dermatologists have the best understanding of the numerous products and compounds used topically in medicine.

Most dermatologic pharmacology can be categorized based on the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]], specifically the [[ATC code D]].
