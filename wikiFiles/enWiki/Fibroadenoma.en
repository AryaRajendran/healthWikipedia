'''Fibroadenomas''' of the [[breast]], are lumps composed of fibrous and glandular tissue. Because [[breast cancer]] can also appear as a lump, doctors may recommend a tissue sample ([[biopsy]]) to rule out cancer in older patients. Unlike typical lumps from breast cancer, fibroadenomas are easy to move, with clearly defined edges.<ref>{{MerckHome|22|251|c||Fibroadenomas}}</ref><ref name=WHO>{{cite book |editor=Tavassoli, F.A., Devilee, P. |title=World Health Organization Classification of Tumours: Pathology & Genetics: Tumours of the breast and female genital organs |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |year=2003 |isbn=92-832-2412-4 |url=}}</ref>

Fibroadenomas are sometimes called '''breast mice''' or a '''breast mouse''' owing to their high mobility in the breast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott-Conner|first=edited by Carol E.H.|title=Breast surgery office management and surgical techniques|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-6075-7|pages=71|coauthors=Dirbas, Frederick}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical case is the presence of a painless, firm, solitary, mobile, slowly growing [[Breast lump|lump]] in the breast of a woman of childbearing years.<ref name=WHO/><ref name = DeMay>{{cite book |author=DeMay, M. |title=Practical Principles of Cytopathology |publisher=ASCP Press |isbn=0-89189-549-3 |pages=2007 |edition=Revised}}</ref><ref name = POW>Pathology Outlines Website. [http://pathologyoutlines.com/breast.html#fibroadenoma] Accessed 12 February 2009.</ref>

In the male breast, [[fibroepithelial tumor]]s are very rare, and are mostly [[phyllodes tumor]]s.  Exceptionally rare case reports exist of fibroadenomas in the male breast, however these cases may be associated with [[antiandrogen]] treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shin SJ, Rosen PP |title=Bilateral presentation of fibroadenoma with digital fibroma-like inclusions in the male breast |journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. |volume=131 |issue=7 |pages=1126–9 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17617003 |doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2007)131[1126:BPOFWD]2.0.CO;2 |url=http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/full/10.1043/1543-2165(2007)131[1126:BPOFWD]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Fibroadenom.jpg|thumb|Fibroadenoma in ultrasound]]
A fibroadenoma is usually diagnosed through clinical examination, [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] or [[mammography]], and often a [[FNAB|needle biopsy]] sample of the lump.<ref name = DeMay/>

==Etiology and epidemiology==
Fibroadenomas arise in the terminal duct lobular unit of the [[breast]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  They are the most common breast tumor in adolescent women.  They also occur in a small number of [[menopause|post-menopausal]] women.  Their incidence declines with increasing age, and, in general, they appear before the age of thirty years. Fibroadenomas are partially hormone-dependent and frequently regress after menopause. They are hypovascular compared to typical (especially malignant) [[neoplasm]]s.<ref name = WHO/><ref name = POW/><ref name = Rosen>{{cite book |author=Rosen, PP. |title=Rosen's Breast Pathology |isbn=978-0-7817-7137-5 |edition=3rd}}</ref>

Higher intake of fruits and vegetables, higher number of live births, use of oral contraceptives and moderate exercise are associated with lower frequency of fibroadenomas.<ref name=Nelson_2010>{{cite pmid|20484549}}</ref>

==Pathology==
[[File:FibroAdenoma of the breast.JPG|thumb|Macroscopic view of fibroadenoma of the breast]]

===Cytology===
The diagnostic findings on [[needle biopsy]] consist of abundant stromal cells, which appear as bare bipolar nuclei, throughout the aspirate; sheets of fairly uniform-size epithelial cells that are typically arranged in either an antler-like pattern or a honeycomb pattern.  These epithelial sheets tend to show typical [[metachromatic]] blue staining on DiffQuick staining.  [[Foam cell]]s and [[apocrine]] cells may also be seen, although these are less diagnostic features.<ref name = DeMay/><ref name = Rosen/>  The gallery images below demonstrate these features.

===Macroscopic===
Approximately ninety percent of fibroadenomas are less than three centimetres in diameter.  The vast majority of the remaining ten percent that are four centimetres or larger occur mostly in women under twenty years of age.  The tumor is round or ovoid, elastic, and nodular, and has a smooth surface.  The cut surface usually appears [[wikt:homogenous|homogenous]] and firm, and is grey-white or tan in colour.
The pericanalicular type (hard) has a whorly appearance with a complete capsule, while the intracanalicular type (soft) has an incomplete capsule.<ref name = Rosen/>

===Microscopic===
Fibroadenoma of the breast is a benign tumor composed of two elements : epithelium and stroma. It is nodular and encapsulated, included in breast. The epithelial proliferation appears in a single terminal ductal unit and describes duct-like spaces surrounded by a fibroblastic stroma. Depending on the proportion and the relationship between these two components, there are two main histological features : intracanalicular and pericanalicular. Often, both types are found in the same tumor.
A) Intracanalicular fibroadenoma : stromal proliferation predominates and compresses the ducts, which are irregular, reduced to slits.
B) Pericanalicular fibroadenoma : fibrous stroma proliferates around the ductal spaces, so that they remain round or oval, on cross section.
The basement membrane is intact <ref name="titleFibroadenoma of the breast">{{cite web |url=http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/fibroadenoma-breast-pathology.php |title=Fibroadenoma of the breast |accessdate=2007-12-15 }}</ref>  The gallery image below demonstrates both morphological subtypes.

==Treatment==
Most fibroadenomas are left in situ and monitored by a doctor, or the patient in question.  Some are treated by surgical excision.  They are removed with a small margin of normal breast tissue if the preoperative clinical investigations are suggestive of the diagnosis.  A small amount of normal tissue must be removed in case the lesion turns out to be a [[phyllodes tumour]] on microscopic examination.<ref name = Rosen/><ref name = Rosai>{{cite book |author=Rosai, J. |title=Rosai and Ackerman's Surgical Pathology |year=2004 |isbn=0-323-01342-2 |edition=9th}}</ref>

Because [[needle biopsy]] is often a reliable diagnostic investigation, some doctors may decide not to operate to remove the lesion, and instead opt for clinical follow-up to serially observe the lesion over time using clinical examination and [[mammography]] to determine the rate of growth, if any, of the lesion.  A growth rate of less than sixteen percent per month in women under fifty years of age, and a growth rate of less than thirteen percent per month in women over fifty years of age have been published as safe growth rates for continued non-operative treatment and clinical observation.<ref name = Gordon>
{{cite journal |author=Gordon PB, Gagnon FA, Lanzkowsky L |title=Solid breast masses diagnosed as fibroadenoma at fine-needle aspiration biopsy: acceptable rates of growth at long-term follow-up |journal=Radiology |volume=229 |issue=1 |pages=233–8 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14519878 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2291010282 |url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14519878}}</ref>

Some fibroadenomas respond to treatment with [[ormeloxifene]].<ref name=Dhar_2007>{{cite pmid|17431715}}</ref>

Fibroadenomas have not been shown to recur following complete excision or transform into [[phyllodes tumour]]s following partial or incomplete excision.<ref name = Rosen/>

There are also natural treatments being touted to diminish fibroadenomas, such as Fibrosolve, but no definite studies have been made as to prove their effectiveness.

===Ultrasound Treatment===
Europe recently recognized an alternative treatment that is called echotherapy and that uses [[high-intensity focused ultrasound]] to treat breast fibroadenoma.<ref>http://www.medgadget.com/2012/12/theraclion-echopulse-ultrasound-therapy-for-breast-fibroadenomas-cleared-in-eu.html</ref>
This method is non-invasive and relies on tissue heating to destroy fibroadenoma cells. Focused ultrasounds have been used for a long time in the treatment of different tumors such as prostate, liver or uterus, where they proved their efficacy.<ref>Jolesz FA, Hynynen K, McDannold N, Tempany C. MR imaging-controlled focused ultrasound ablation: a non-invasive image-guided surgery. Magn Reson Imaging Clin N Am 2005;13(3):545-60.</ref><ref>Gombos EC, Kacher DF, Furusawa H, Namba K.

A French company, Theraclion, develops an echotherapy device for benign tumors treatment especially breast fibroadenoma.

===Cryoablation Treatment===

The FDA has approved [[cryoablation]] (the use of extreme cold to destroy tissue) of a fibroadenoma as a safe, effective and minimally-invasive alternative to open surgical removal.<ref name="Breast Surgeons">[http://www.breastsurgeons.org/statements/PDF_Statements/Fibroadenoma.pdf Management of Fibroadenomas of the Breast]</ref> In the procedure, [[ultrasound imaging]] is used to guide a probe into the mass of breast tissue. Extremely cold temperatures are then used to destroy the abnormal cells,<ref name="WebMD">[http://women.webmd.com/news/20031204/cryotherapy-shrinks-benign-breast-lumps WebMD — Cryotherapy Shrinks Benign Breast Lumps]</ref> and over time the cells are reabsorbed into the body. The procedure can be performed in an office setting with local anesthesia only, and leaves substantially less scarring than open surgical procedures.<ref name="WebMD"/>

[[The American Society of Breast Surgeons]] recommends the following criteria to establish a patient as a candidate for cryoablation of a fibroadenoma:<ref name="Breast Surgeons"/>
#The lesion must be sonographically visible.
#The diagnosis of fibroadenoma must be confirmed histologically.
#Lesions should be less than 4&nbsp;cm in diameter.
