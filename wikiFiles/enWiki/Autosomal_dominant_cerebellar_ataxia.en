'''Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia''' (ADCA) is a form of [[spinocerebellar ataxia]] inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] manner. ADCA is a genetically [[Heredity|inherited]] [[Disease#Medical_condition|condition]] that causes deterioration of the [[nervous system]] leading to disorder and a decrease or loss of function to regions of the body. Degeneration occurs at the cellular level and in certain subtypes results in cellular death. Cellular death or dysfunction causes a break or faulty signal in the line of communication from the central nervous system to target muscles in the body. When there is impaired communication or a lack of communication entirely, the muscles in the body do not function correctly. Muscle control complications can be observed in multiple balance, speech, and motor or movement impairment symptoms. ADCA is divided into three types and further subdivided into subtypes known as SCAs (spinocerebellar ataxias).<ref name="ojrd">{{cite journal|last=Whaley|first=Nathaniel|coauthors=Fujioka, Shinsuke; Wszolek, Zbigniew K|title=Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I: A review of the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|date=1 January 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=33|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-6-33}}</ref>

==ADCA Types==
===Type 1===
Type 1 ADCA is characterized by different symptoms of [[ataxia]] as well as other conditions that are dependent on the subtype. Type 1 ADCA is divided into 3 subclasses based on pathogenesis of the subtypes each contain. <ref name="ojrd" />

====Subtype 1====
Subtypes in the first subclass are caused by CAG [[nucleotide]] repeats in the [[DNA]], which code for the [[amino acid]] [[glutamine]].<ref name="ojrd"></ref> This glutamine is toxic to the cell on the level of [[proteins]] and has degenerative effects.<ref name="ojrd"></ref> Within the first subclass of Type 1 are SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA17, and DRPLA. This first subclass is the most common of Type 1 ADCAs with SCA3 being the most common subtype of all of Type 1. SCA3, Machado-Joesph disease, is the most common because the [[mutation]] repeats more than 56 times while the regular length is around 13 to 31. <ref name="ojrd" />

====Subtype 2====
The second subclass of Type 1 ADCA is also caused by the same nucleotide repeats but instead in [[RNA]] and in a region that does not code for proteins. [[Gene expression]] is affected instead of proteins in subtype two SCAs because of this. Subtype 2 contains SCA8, SCA10, and SCA12.<ref name="ojrd" />

====Subtype 3====
The third subclass of Type 1 ADCA is caused by different [[mutations]] and deletions in genes. It comprises SCA13, SCA14, SCA15, SCA16, SCA27, and SCA28.<ref name="ojrd" />

===Spinocerebellar Ataxia===
The designated loci, SCA, portrays the involvement of two systems: the cerebellum and the spinal cord. 11 to 18 known genes are mutated within this region. All other SCAs are caused by conventional mutations or rearrangement in genes with different functions, such as: calcium signaling (SCA15/16), glutamate signaling (SCA5/SPTBN2), channel functioning (SCA13/KCNC3, SCA27), tau regulation (SCA11/TTBK2), mitochondial activity (SCA28) and RNA alteration (SCA 31).  
===Type 2/3===
Type II ADCA is composed of SCA7 and syndromes associated with pigmentary maculopathies<ref name="ojrd" /> (see [[Retinitis pigmentosa]]). SCA7 is a disease that specifically displays [[retinal]] degeneration, along with the common degeneration of the [[cerebellum]]. Moving further into SCA7's pathology, a similar genetic process is described. The function of ATXN7 (an ataxin gene) is much like a component of the SAGA complex. The SAGA complex uses two [[histone]]-modifiying techniques to regulate [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. These activities are the Gcn5 histone [[acetyltransferase]] and the Usp22 deubiquitinase. Mutant ATXN7 in HAT activity causes an increase in activity, which was reported from an [[in-vivo]] analysis in the [[retina]]. There are also studies that show a loss in activity when human ATXN7 in yeast was used.
The SCA7 autosomal-dominant [[inheritance]] pattern is similar to a mutant ATXN5-induced gain in Gcn5 HAT.<ref name="tjcb">{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=H.

Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 15 has been classified as an ADCA Type 3 as it has been noted to have affects not only cerebellar ataxia but also postural and action tremor. <ref name="ojrd" /> Additionally, Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 20 (SCA20) is organized in ADCA III that often exhibits disease-like symptoms at an earlier age, sometime starting at fourteen years old. <ref name="ojrd" /> Classifying these ataxia [[syndromes]] into three major categories allows [[clinicians]] to better treat patients presented with defined SCA [[phenotypes]] and focus in on potential diagnostic possibilities. <ref name="ojrd" />

'''Frequecy:''' 

SCA3, MJD, is the most frequent with 57,8% of affected families, followed by DRPLA with 11.2%, and those patients  were characterized by prominent anticipation and a variable combination of epilepsy, extra-pyramidal symptoms and dementia.Patients with SCA1 and SCA7 had African ancestry.

'''Genetics:'''11 of 18 known genes are caused by repeated expansions in corresponding proteins, sharing the same mutational mechanism. SCAs can be caused by conventional mutations or large rearrangements in genes that make glutamate and calcium signaling, channel function, tau regulation and mitochondrial activity or RNA alteration.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms typically are onset between the ages of twenty-five to forty-five years, although, childhood cases have also been observed. Common symptoms include a loss of coordination which is often seen in walking, and slurred speech.<ref name="cirrie.buffalo" /> ADCA primarily affects the [[cerebellum]], as well as, the [[spinal cord]]. There are several kinds of ataxias which are grouped depending on how the specific disorder partners with cerebellar ataxia. Type I ataxia, the most common disorder displays the symptoms of motor impairment, [[optic atrophy]], oculomotor [[paralysis]], and intelligence disorders.<ref name="cirrie.buffalo">{{cite web|url=http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/327/ |title=Autosomal Dominant Cerebellar Ataxias &#124; International Encyclopedia of Rehabilitation |publisher=Cirrie.buffalo.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref> Equilibrium disorders also indicate the presence of the disease. Speech production disorders are also another sign of cerebellum damage. Impairment of proprioreception resulting in the inability for a patient to precieve the position and orientation of their limbs is also observed.<ref name="cirrie.buffalo" /> Certain eye muscles can also become paralyzed, along with some swallowing disorders, and impairment of the [[sphincter]] function. These symptoms vary from different individuals and usually develop over a long period of time, around 20 to 30 years.<ref name="cirrie.buffalo" /> Individuals with dominant cerebellar ataxia have a late onset of narcolepsy and deafness around the age of 30 to 40 years old.

==Diagnosis==
Three main approaches of diagnosing the condition are the patients clinical history or their past health examinations, a current physical examination to check for any physical [[Abnormalities]], and a genetic screening of the patients genes and the genealogy of the family. The large category of cerebellar ataxia is caused by a deterioration of [[neurons]] in the cerebellum. [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) is used to detect any structural abnormality such as [[lesions]] and [[tumors]] which are the primary cause of the ataxia. [[Computed tomography]] (CT) scans can also be used to view neuronal deterioration, but the [[MRI]] provides a more accurate and detailed picture. ADCA is a genetically inherited condition so a family screening and genealogy test are done to look for a pattern or lineage of the disease. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17204042</ref> 
==Treatments and Management==
There is not a lot of information about treatments or therapies at this time. There are some ideas that give hope for future treatments. For the disease to manifest itself, these diseases require mutant [[protein expression]].<ref name="tjcb"></ref> Manipulating the use of protein homoestasis regulators can be therapuetic agents. Also, a treatment to try and correct an altered function that makes up the [[pathology]] is one current idea.<ref name="tjcb"></ref> There is evidence that for SCA1 and two other polyQ disorders that the pathology can be reversed after the [[disease]] is underway.<ref name="tjcb" />  There no effective treatments that could alter the progression of this disease. Therefore care is given, like occupational and physical therapy for gait dysfunction and speech therapy for impaired articulatory ability.
