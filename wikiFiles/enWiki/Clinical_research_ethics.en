'''Clinical research ethics''' are the set of relevant [[ethics]] considered in the conduct of a [[clinical trial]] in the field of [[clinical research]]. It borrows from the broader fields of [[research ethics]] and [[medical ethics]].

==Governance==
{{main|Guidelines for human subject research}}
Most directly a local [[institutional review board]] oversees the clinical research ethics of any given clinical trial. The institutional review board understands and acts according to local and national law. Each countries national law is guided by international principles, such as the [[Belmont Report]]'s directive that all study participants have a right to "respect for persons", "beneficence", and "justice" when participating in clinical research.

==Study participant rights==
Participants in clinical research have rights which they should expect, including the following:<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196606162742405|last=Beecher 1966;|first=Henry K.|title=Ethics and Clinical Research|journal=N Engl J Med|date=June 16, 1966|issue=24|pages=1354â€“1360|accessdate=11 January 2012|doi=10.1056/NEJM196606162742405|pmid=5327352|volume=274}}</ref>

==Vulnerable populations==
There is a range of autonomy which study participants may have in deciding their participation in clinical research. Researchers refer to populations which have low autonomy as "vulnerable populations"; these are groups which may not be able to fairly decide for themselves whether to participate in clinical trials. Examples of groups which are vulnerable populations include [[Incarceration|incarcerated persons]], children, persons exhibiting [[insanity]] or any other condition which precludes their autonomy, and to a lesser extent, any population for which there is reason to believe that the research study could seem particularly or unfairly persuasive or misleading. There are particular [[ethical problems using children in clinical trials]].
