One of the most common locations for a '''[[foreign body]]''' is the [[alimentary tract]]. 

It is possible for foreign bodies to enter the tract from the [[mouth]],<ref name="urlPediatrics, Foreign Body Ingestion: Overview - eMedicine">{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/801821-overview |title=Pediatrics, Foreign Body Ingestion: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> or from the [[rectum]].<ref name="pmid18666334">{{cite journal |author=Koornstra JJ, Weersma RK |title=Management of rectal foreign bodies: description of a new technique and clinical practice guidelines |journal=World J. Gastroenterol. |volume=14 |issue=27 |pages=4403–6 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18666334 |doi= 10.3748/wjg.14.4403|url=http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/14/4403.asp |pmc=2731197}}</ref>

The objects most commonly swallowed by children are [[coin]]s.<ref name="pmid11548183">{{cite journal |author=Arana A, Hauser B, Hachimi-Idrissi S, Vandenplas Y |title=Management of ingested foreign bodies in childhood and review of the literature |journal=Eur.

Swallowed objects are more likely to lodge in the [[esophagus]] or [[stomach]] than in the [[pharynx]] or [[duodenum]].<ref name="pmid16996336">{{cite journal |author=Li ZS, Sun ZX, Zou DW, Xu GM, Wu RP, Liao Z |title=Endoscopic management of foreign bodies in the upper-GI tract: experience with 1088 cases in China |journal=Gastrointest. Endosc. |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=485–92 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16996336 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2006.01.059 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016-5107(06)00221-5}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
If the person who swallowed the foreign body is doing well, usually a [[x-ray]] image will be taken which will show any metal objects, and this will be repeated a few days later to confirm that the object has passed all the way through the digestive system. Also it needs to be confirmed that the object is not stuck in the airways, in the bronchial tree.

==Treatment==
Most objects that are swallowed will, if they have passed the [[pharynx]], pass all the way through the [[gastrointestinal tract]] unaided.<ref name="pmid17766213">{{cite journal |author=Lin CH, Chen AC, Tsai JD, Wei SH, Hsueh KC, Lin WC |title=Endoscopic removal of foreign bodies in children |journal=Kaohsiung J. Med. Sci. |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=447–52 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17766213 |doi= 10.1016/S1607-551X(08)70052-4|url=http://ajws.elsevier.com/ajws_pubmed/pubmed_switch.asp?journal_issn=1607-551X&art_pub_year=2007&%20art_pub_month=09&art_pub_vol=23&art_sp=447 |format=}} {{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

However, sometimes an object becomes arrested (usually in the terminal [[ileum]] or the [[rectum]]) or a sharp object penetrates the [[intestine|bowel]] wall. 

If the foreign body causes problems like pain, vomiting or bleeding it must be removed. 

Swallowed [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] can be associated with additional damage,<ref name="urlBattery Ingestion">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/battery_ingestion/article_em.htm |title=Battery Ingestion |work= |accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref><ref name="pmid15221361">{{cite journal |author=Yardeni D, Yardeni H, Coran AG, Golladay ES |title=Severe esophageal damage due to button battery ingestion: can it be prevented? |journal=Pediatr.

One technique used is [[endoscopic foreign body retrieval]].
