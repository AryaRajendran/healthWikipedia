'''Phlegm''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|f|l|ɛ|m}}; {{lang-el|φλέγμα}} "inflammation, humour caused by heat") is a [[liquid]] secreted by the [[mucous membrane]]s of [[mammal]]ians. Its definition is limited to the [[mucus]] produced by the [[respiratory system]], excluding that from the [[human nose|nasal]] passages, and particularly that which is expelled by [[cough]]ing ([[sputum]]). Phlegm is in essence a water-based gel consisting of [[glycoproteins]], [[immunoglobulins]], [[lipids]] and other substances. Its composition varies depending on [[climate]], [[genetics]], and state of the [[immune system]]. Its color can vary from transparent to pale or dark yellow and green, from light to dark brown, and even to dark grey depending on the constituents.

==Distinction between mucus and phlegm==
Contrary to popular misconception and misuse, mucus and phlegm are not always the same.

===Mucus===
Mucus is a normal protective layering around the airway, eye, [[nasal turbinate]], and [[urogenital tract]]. Mucus is an adhesive [[viscoelastic gel]] produced in the airway by [[submucosal glands]] and [[goblet cells]] and is principally water. It also contains high-molecular weight mucous [[glycoproteins]] that form [[linear polymers]].

===Phlegm===
Phlegm is more related to disease than is mucus. Phlegm is a secretion in the airway during disease and inflammation. Phlegm usually contains mucus with bacteria, debris, and sloughed-off inflammatory cells. Once phlegm has been expectorated by a cough it becomes [[sputum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Bruce|title=The Role of Mucus in Cough Research|journal=Lung|month=January|year=2010|pmid=19936981|doi=10.1007/s00408-009-9198-7}}</ref>

==Excessive phlegm creation==
There are multiple factors that can contribute to an excess of phlegm in the throat or [[larynx]].

*Vocal abuse: Vocal abuse is the misuse or overuse of the voice in an unhealthy fashion such as clearing the throat, yelling, screaming, talking loudly, or singing incorrectly.
**Clearing the throat: Clearing the throat removes or loosens phlegm but the vocal cords hit together causing inflammation and therefore more phlegm.<ref>[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=b55fc8ad-870c-4c29-8ca9-529f67885780%40sessionmgr104&vid=2&hid=111]</ref>
**Yelling/screaming: Yelling and screaming both cause the vocal chords to hit against each other causing inflammation and phlegm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892199708000878#ref_bib11 |title=Elsevier |publisher=Sciencedirect.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref><ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/866872-overview#aw2aab6b3 ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceteacher.com/mathis.html |title=Singers, Let's Prevent Vocal Problems! |publisher=Voiceteacher.com |date=1987-08-01 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ent-consult.com/loedingger.html |title=Vocal Survival Techniques For Singers Who Abuse And Overuse Their Voices |publisher=Ent-consult.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entandallergy.com/vas/services/voice_disorders_visit.php |title=Voice & Swallowing Center - Voice Disorders |publisher=Entandallergy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>
**Nodules: Excessive yelling, screaming, and incorrect singing as well as other vocal abusive habits can cause vocal nodules. See [[vocal fold nodule]] for more information on nodules.

*Smoking: Heat from smoking dries out the vocal cords. With each breath in of smoke, the larynx is polluted with toxins that inhibit it from rehydrating for about 3 hours.<ref>Davies, Shela, [http://www.shelaghdavies.com/soundadvice/ "Sound Advice: Your guide to a strong, clear, easy voice"]</ref> The vocal cords need a fair amount of lubrication and swell from inflammation when they do not have enough of it. When the vocal folds swell and are inflamed, phlegm is often created to attempt to ease the dryness.<ref>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/172/3984/741.full.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2009/01/01/ntr.ntp015.abstract |title=Symptoms of cough and shortness of breath among occasional young adult smokers |publisher=Ntr.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>
**Experiment on smoking correlations: In 2002, an experiment was done and published by the [[American College of Chest Physicians]] to find if there was a correlation of smokers with coughing and phlegm. In the study, 117 participants were studied, a mix of current smokers, ex-smokers, non-smokers, and a positive control of participants with a disease, COPD ([[Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease]].) At the end of the experiment, experimenters found that there was a high correlation between phlegm and cough with smoking of 0.49 (p<.001.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.erl.lib.byu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=1dec7f0a-c4d8-4938-839c-34653897a520%40sessionmgr113&vid=1&hid=127 |title=Brigham Young University Sign-in Service |publisher=Web.ebscohost.com.erl.lib.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>

*Illness: During illness like the [[flu]] and [[Common cold|cold]], phlegm becomes more excessive as an attempt to get rid of the bacteria or viral particles within the body. A major illness associated with excess phlegm is [[acute bronchitis]]. A major symptom of acute bronchitis is an excess amount of phlegm and is often treated with an antibiotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/bronchitis-000019.htm |title=Bronchitis |publisher=Umm.edu |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref><ref>[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&hid=111&sid=b3387fad-2fe1-4ede-a963-0b5087cc9e5b%40sessionmgr115]</ref>

*Hay fever, asthma: In hay fever and asthma, inner lining in [[bronchioles]] become inflamed and create an excess amount of phlegm that can clog up air pathways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/asthma.htm |title=Asthma |publisher=Netdoctor.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>

*Air pollution: In studies of children, air pollutants have been found to increase phlegm by drying out and irritating parts of the throat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.erl.lib.byu.edu/ehost/detail?sid=9f5c9302-e123-4697-af82-f0c56f213953%40sessionmgr115&vid=1&hid=127&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=aph&AN=66646265 |title=Brigham Young University Sign-in Service |publisher=Web.ebscohost.com.erl.lib.byu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>

==Illnesses related to phlegm==
Phlegm may be a carrier of [[larva]]e of [[intestinal parasite]]s (see [[hookworm]]). [[Hemoptysis|Bloody sputum]] can be a symptom of serious disease (such as [[tuberculosis]]), but can also be a relatively benign symptom of a minor disease (such as [[bronchitis]]). In the latter case, the sputum is normally lightly streaked with blood. Coughing up any significant quantity of blood is always a serious medical condition, and any person who experiences this should seek medical attention.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Phlegm and humourism==
[[Humourism]] is an ancient theory that the human body is filled with four basic substances, called the [[four humours]], which are held in balance when a person is healthy. It is closely related to the ancient theory of the [[Classical element|four elements]] and states that all diseases and disabilities result from an excess or deficit in [[Melancholia|black bile]], [[yellow bile]], phlegm, and [[blood]]. [[Hippocrates]], an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] medical doctor, is credited for this theory, about 400 BC. It influenced medical thinking for more than 2,000 years, until finally discredited in the 1800s.

Phlegm was thought to be associated with [[apathetic]] behaviour; this old belief is preserved in the word "[[phlegmatic]]". This adjective always refers to behaviour, and is pronounced differently, giving full weight to the  "g": not  /ˈflɛmatɪk/ but  /flɛgˈmatɪk/.<ref><http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/142540>; accessed 27 May 2012.</ref>

==Other concepts==
Sir [[William Osler]]’s 1889 [http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/osler/aequessay.htm Aequanimitas] discusses the imperturbability or calmness in a storm required of physicians. "'Imperturbability means coolness and presence of mind under all circumstances, calmness amid storm, clearness of judgment in moments of grave peril, immobility, impassiveness, or, to use an old and expressive word, phlegm."'' This was his farewell speech at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1889 before becoming Physician-in-Chief at the recently founded [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. This is from [http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/osler/osler150.htm ''"Celebrating the Contributions of William Osler"''] in the [http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/ Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives] of the [http://www.jhmi.edu/  Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions]."
