'''Neutropenia''', from [[Latin language|Latin]] [[prefix]] ''neutro-'' (neither, for neutral staining) and [[Greek language|Greek]] [[suffix]] ''-πενία'' (deficiency), is a [[granulocyte disorder]] characterized by an abnormally low number of [[neutrophil]]s. Neutrophils usually make up 50-70% of circulating [[white blood cell]]s and serve as the primary defense against [[infection]]s by destroying [[bacteria]] in the [[blood]]. Hence, patients with neutropenia are more susceptible to bacterial infections and, without prompt medical attention, the condition may become life-threatening ([[neutropenic sepsis]]).

Neutropenia can be [[Acute (medical)|acute]] or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] depending on the duration of the illness. A patient has chronic neutropenia if the condition lasts for longer than three months. It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term [[leukopenia]] ("deficit in the number of white blood cells"), as neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes, but neutropenia is more properly considered a subset of leukopenia as a whole.

There are numerous causes of neutropenia that can roughly be divided between either problems in the production of the cells by the [[bone marrow]] and destruction of the cells elsewhere in the body. Treatment depends on the nature of the cause, and emphasis is placed on the prevention and treatment of infection.

==Classification==
There are three general guidelines used to classify the severity of neutropenia based on the [[absolute neutrophil count]] (ANC) measured in cells per [[microliter]] of blood:<ref name="pmid17404350">{{cite journal |author=Hsieh MM, Everhart JE, Byrd-Holt DD, Tisdale JF, Rodgers GP |title=Prevalence of neutropenia in the U.S. population: age, sex, smoking status, and ethnic differences |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=146 |issue=7 |pages=486–92 |year=2007 |pmid=17404350 |doi= |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/146/7/486 |month=Apr |issn=0003-4819}}</ref>
* Mild neutropenia (1000 ≤ ANC &lt; 1500) &mdash; minimal risk of infection
* Moderate neutropenia (500 ≤ ANC &lt; 1000) &mdash; moderate risk of infection
* Severe neutropenia (ANC &lt; 500) &mdash; severe risk of infection.

==Signs and symptoms==
Neutropenia can go undetected, but is generally discovered when a patient has developed severe [[infection]]s or [[sepsis]]. Some common infections can take an unexpected course in neutropenic patients; formation of [[pus]], for example, can be notably absent, as this requires circulating neutrophil granulocytes.

Some common symptoms of neutropenia include [[fever]]s and frequent [[infections]].  These infections can result in conditions such as [[Oral ulcer|mouth ulcers]], [[diarrhea]], a [[burning sensation when urinating]], unusual redness, pain, or [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] around a wound, or a [[sore throat]].

==Diagnosis==
Low neutrophil counts are detected on a [[full blood count]]. Generally, other investigations are required to arrive at the right diagnosis. When the diagnosis is uncertain, or serious causes are suspected, [[bone marrow biopsy]] is often necessary.

Other investigations commonly performed: serial neutrophil counts for suspected [[cyclic neutropenia]], tests for antineutrophil antibodies, [[autoantibody]] screen and investigations for [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] and [[folate]] assays and acidified serum ([[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria|Ham's]]) test.<ref>{{cite book |author=Levene, Malcolm I.; Lewis, S.

==Causes==
Causes can be divided into the following groups:
* Decreased production in the [[bone marrow]] due to:
** [[aplastic anemia]]
** [[arsenic poisoning]]<ref>American Society of Hematology Trisenox (arsenic trioxide) in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS): Preliminary Results of a Phase I/II Study.
Norbert Vey, MD1,*, Francois Dreyfus, MD1,*, Agnes Guerci, MD1,*, Pierre Fenaux, MD1, Herve Dombret, MD1, Alan K. Burnett, MD2, Andre Bosly, MD3, Walter Feremans, MD4, David T. Bowen, MD5 and Marja Heiskala, MD6</ref>
** [[cancer]], particularly [[blood cancers]]
** certain medications
** [[hereditary disorder]]s (e.g. [[Kostmann syndrome|congenital neutropenia]], [[cyclic neutropenia]])
** [[radiation]]
** [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], [[folate]] or [[Copper in health|copper]] deficiency.
* Increased destruction:
** [[autoimmune neutropenia]].
** [[chemotherapy]] treatments, such as for cancer and autoimmune diseases
* Marginalisation and sequestration:
** [[dialysis|Hemodialysis]]
* Medications
** [[Flecainide]] (a class 1C cardiac anti-arrhythmic drug)
** phenytoin
** indomethacin
** propylthiouracil
** carbimazole
** chlorpromazine
** trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole)
** clozapine
** ticlodipine
There is often a mild neutropenia in [[viral infection]]s. Additionally, there is a condition called [[morning pseudoneutropenia]] which might be a side effect of certain anti-psychotic medications.

==Therapy==
There is no ideal therapy for neutropenia, but recombinant [[Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor|G-CSF]] (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) such as [[filgrastim]] can be effective in chemotherapy patients, in patients with congenital forms of neutropenia including severe congenital neutropenia, autosomal recessive Kostmann's syndrome, cyclic neutropenia, and myelokathexis.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=February 2008}}

The relationship between a low neutrophil count and increased risk of infection was first demonstrated in patients with [[leukemia]].<ref name="pmid5216294">{{cite journal |author=Bodey GP, Buckley M, Sathe YS, Freireich EJ |title=Quantitative relationships between circulating leukocytes and infection in patients with acute leukemia |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=328–40 |year=1966 |pmid=5216294 |doi= |month=Feb |issn=0003-4819}}</ref>

==Diet==
Guidelines given to neutropenic patients regarding diet are currently being studied.<ref>http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/16/5/704.abstract Jubelirer, S., The Benefit of the Neutropenic Diet: Fact or Fiction?, ''Oncologist'', 2011;16(5):704-7. Epub 6 April 2011</ref>  As of 2011, the Neutropenic Diet Guideline includes the following recommendations:<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00726934 The Effectiveness of the Neutropenic Diet in Pediatric Oncology Patients, Montefiore Medical Center, Last updated 4 March 2010, Accessed 15 June 2011.</ref>
