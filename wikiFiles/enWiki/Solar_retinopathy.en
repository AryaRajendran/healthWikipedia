'''Solar retinopathy''' is damage to the [[human eye|eye]]'s [[retina]], particularly the [[macula]], from prolonged exposure to [[solar radiation]] or other bright light. It usually occurs due to [[sungazing|staring at the sun]], watching a [[solar eclipse]] or viewing at [[UV]], [[Illuminant D65]] or bright light.<ref>Midwest Eye Care, P.C.[http://www.midwesteyecare.com/SubSection/index.php?SectionID=7&SubSectionID=183&ParentID=60 "Solar retinopathy".]</ref><ref name="Chen">Chen JC, Lee LR.

==Pathophysiology==
Although it is frequently claimed that the retina is burned by looking at the sun, retinal damage appears to occur primarily due to photochemical injury rather than thermal injury and it appears that central serous retinopathy can be a result of a depression in a treated solar damaged eye.<ref name="Chen"/><ref>Dobson R.

*Long-term reduced [[visual acuity]]<ref name="Sefic">Sefic-Kasumovic S, Firdus H, Alimanovic E, Ljaljevic S, Sefic M. "[Eye injuries caused by an eclipse of the sun]." ''Med Arh.'' 2000;54(1):41-4.

*Central or paracentral [[scotoma]]<ref name="Sefic"/><ref name="Kallmark"/>

[[Vision loss]] due to solar retinopathy is typically reversible,<ref name="Chen"/> lasting for as short as one month<ref name="Sefic"/> to over one year.<ref name="Kallmark"/> The fundus changes are variable and usually bilateral, mild cases often show no alteration and moderate to severe cases show a foveal yellow spot on the first days after exposure. After a few days it is replaced by a reddish dot often surrounded by pigment.
