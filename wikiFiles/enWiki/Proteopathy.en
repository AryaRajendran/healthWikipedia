The concept of proteopathy can trace its origins to the mid-19th century, when, in 1854, [[Rudolf Virchow]] coined the term [[amyloid]] ("starch-like") to describe a substance in cerebral [[corpora amylacea]] that exhibited a chemical reaction resembling that of [[cellulose]].  In 1859, [[Friedreich]] and [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Kekulé]] demonstrated that, rather than consisting of cellulose, "amyloid" actually is rich in protein.<ref name="Sipe">{{cite journal | author = Sipe JD, Cohen AS | title = Review: History of the amyloid fibril | journal = J Struct Biol | volume = 130 | pages = 88–98 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10940217 | doi = 10.1006/jsbi.2000.4221 | issue = 2–3}}</ref>  Subsequent research has shown that many different proteins can form amyloid, and that all amyloids have in common [[birefringence]] in cross-[[polarized light]] after staining with the dye [[Congo red|Congo Red]], as well as a fibrillar [[ultrastructure]] when viewed with an [[electron microscope]].<ref name="Sipe"/>  However, some proteinaceous lesions lack birefringence and contain few or no classical amyloid fibrils, such as the diffuse deposits of Aβ protein in the brains of Alzheimer patients.<ref name="Wisniewski">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00005072-199807000-00004 | author = Wisniewski HM, Sadowski M, Jakubowska-Sadowska K, Tarnawski M, Wegiel J | title = Diffuse, lake-like amyloid-beta deposits in the parvopyramidal layer of the presubiculum in Alzheimer disease | journal = J Neuropath Exp Neurol | volume = 57 | pages = 674–683 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9690671 | issue = 7}}</ref>  Furthermore, evidence has emerged that small, non-fibrillar protein aggregates known as [[oligomers]] are toxic to the cells of an affected organ, and that amyloidogenic proteins in their fibrillar form may be relatively benign.<ref name="Glabe">{{cite journal | author = Glabe CG | title = Common mechanisms of amyloid oligomer pathogenesis in degenerative disease | journal = Neurobiol Aging | volume = 27 | pages = 570–575 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16481071 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2005.04.017}}</ref><ref name="Gadad">{{cite journal | author = Gadad BS, Britton GB, Rao KS | title = Targeting oligomers in neurodegenerative disorders: lessons from α-synuclein, tau, and amyloid-β peptide  |journal = J Alzheimers Dis | volume = 24 Suppl 2 | pages = 223–232 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21460436 | doi = 10.3233/JAD-2011-110182 | journal = Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

In most, if not all proteopathies, a change in 3-dimensional folding (conformation) increases the tendency of a specific protein to bind to itself.<ref name="Carrell"/>  In this aggregated form, the protein is resistant to clearance and can interfere with the normal capacity of the affected organs.  In some cases, misfolding of the protein results in a loss of its usual function. For example, [[cystic fibrosis]] is caused by a defective [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] (CFTR) protein,<ref name="Luheshi"/> and in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis / frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), certain gene-regulating proteins inappropriately aggregate in the cytoplasm, and thus are unable to perform their normal tasks within the nucleus.<ref name="ItoSuzuki">{{cite journal | author = Ito D, Suzuki N | title = Conjoint pathologic cascades mediated by ALS/FTLD-U linked RNA-binding proteins TDP-43 and FUS | journal = Neurology | volume = Epub ahead of print Sept 28 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21956718 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182343365}}</ref> Because proteins share a common structural feature known as the [[polypeptide]] backbone, all proteins have the potential to misfold under some circumstances.<ref name="Dobson">{{cite journal | author = Dobson CM | title = Protein misfolding, evolution and disease | journal = TIBS | volume = 24 | pages = 329–332 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10470028 | issue = 9 | doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(99)01445-0}}</ref>  However, only a relatively small number of proteins are linked to proteopathic disorders, possibly due to structural idiosyncrasies of the vulnerable proteins.  For example, proteins that are relatively unstable as [[monomers]] (that is, as single, unbound protein molecules) are more likely to misfold into an abnormal conformation.<ref name="Carrell"/><ref name="Dobson"/>  In nearly all instances, the disease-causing molecular configuration involves an increase in [[beta-sheet]] secondary structure of the protein.<ref name="Carrell"/><ref name="Dobson"/><ref name="Selkoe">{{cite journal | author = Selkoe DJ | title = Folding proteins in fatal ways | journal = Nature | volume = 426 | pages = 900–904 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1038/nature02264 | pmid = 14685251 | issue = 6968}}</ref>  The abnormal proteins in some proteopathies have been shown to fold into multiple 3-dimensional shapes; these variant, proteinaceous structures are defined by their different pathogenic, biochemical, and conformational properties.  They have been most thoroughly studied with regard to [[prion disease]], and are referred to as protein [[Strain (biology)|strains]].<ref name="Collinge">{{cite journal | author = Collinge J, Clarke AR | title = A general model of prion strains and their pathogenicity | journal = Science | volume = 318 | pages = 930–936 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17991853 | issue = 5852 | doi = 10.1126/science.1138718}}</ref><ref name="Colby">{{cite journal | author = Colby DW, Prusiner SB | title = De novo generation of prion strains | journal = Nat Rev Microbiol | volume = Epub ahead of print Sept 26 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21947062 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2650 | issue = 11 | pages = 771–7}}</ref>

The likelihood that proteopathy will develop is increased by certain [[risk factors]] that promote the self-assembly of a protein.  These include destabilizing changes in the primary [[amino acid]] sequence of the protein, [[post-translational modifications]] (such as [[hyperphosphorylation]]), changes in temperature or [[pH]], an increase in production of a protein, or a decrease in its clearance.<ref name="Walker1">{{cite journal | author = Walker LC and LeVine H | title = The cerebral proteopathies | journal = Neurobiol Aging | volume = 21 | pages = 559–561 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10924770 | doi = 10.1016/S0197-4580(00)00160-3 | issue = 4}}</ref><ref name="Carrell"/><ref name="Dobson"/>  Advancing age is a strong risk factor,<ref name="Walker1"/> as is traumatic brain injury.<ref name="DeKosky">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1007051 | author = DeKosky ST, Ikonomovic MD and Gandy S | title = Traumatic brain injury--football, warfare, and long-term effects | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | pages = 1293–1296 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20879875 | issue = 14}}</ref>  In the aging brain, multiple proteopathies can overlap.  For example, in addition to [[tauopathy]] and Aβ-amyloidosis (which coexist as key pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease), many Alzheimer patients have concomitant synucleinopathy ([[Lewy bodies]]) in the brain.<ref name="Mrak">{{cite journal | author = Mrak RE, Griffin WS | title = Dementia with Lewy bodies: Definition, diagnosis, and pathogenic relationship to Alzheimer's disease | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 3 | pages = 619–625 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19300591 | issue = 5 | pmc = 2656298}}</ref>

==Seeded Induction of Proteopathy==

Some proteins can be induced to form abnormal assemblies by exposure to the same (or similar) protein that has folded into a disease-causing conformation, a process called 'seeding' or 'permissive templating'.<ref name="Hardy">{{cite journal | author = Hardy J | title = Expression of normal sequence pathogenic proteins for neurodegenerative disease contributes to disease risk: 'permissive templating' as a general mechanism underlying neurodegeneration | journal = Biochem Soc Trans | volume = 33 | pages = 578–581 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16042548 | doi = 10.1042/BST0330578 | issue = Pt 4}}</ref><ref name="Walker3">{{cite journal | author = Walker LC, LeVine H, Mattson MP, Jucker M | title = Inducible proteopathies | journal = TINS | volume = 29 | pages = 438–443 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16806508 | issue = 8 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2006.06.010}}</ref>  In this way, the disease state can be brought about in a susceptible [[host (biology)|host]] by the introduction of diseased tissue extract from an afflicted donor.

In all of these instances, an aberrant form of the protein itself appears to be the pathogenic agent. In some cases, the deposition of one type of protein can be experimentally induced by aggregated assemblies of other proteins that are rich in β-sheet structure, possibly because of structural complementarity of the protein molecules.
