'''Non-obese diabetic''' or '''NOD''' [[mouse|mice]], like the [[Biobreeding rat]], are used as an [[model organism|animal model]] for [[type 1 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) Mouse BAC Library | work=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases | url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dait/NODmice.htm | accessdate=2006-05-15}}</ref>

== History ==
Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice exhibit a susceptibility to spontaneous development of autoimmune [[insulin dependent diabetes mellitus]] (IDDM).<ref name="pmid1323922">{{cite journal

== Characteristics ==
Diabetes develops in NOD mice as a result of insulitis, a leukocytic infiltrate of the [[pancreatic islet]]s.  Onset of [[diabetes]] is associated with a moderate glycosuria and a non-fasting hyperglycaemia.  It is recommended to monitor for development of [[glycosuria]] from 10 weeks of age; this can be carried out using urine glucose [[dipsticks]]. The incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse is 60-80% in females and 20-30% in males. Onset of diabetes also varies between males and females: commonly, onset is delayed in males by several weeks.

== Susceptibility ==
The susceptibility to IDDM is [[polygenic]] and environment exerts a strong effect on [[gene]] penetrances. Environment including housing conditions, health status, and diet all affect development of diabetes in the mice. For instance, NOD mice maintained in different laboratories can have different levels of incidence.  Interestingly, the incidence of disease is much higher if the mice are maintained in a relatively germ-free environment.<ref name="pmid18806780">{{cite journal |author=Wen L, Ley RE, Volchkov PY, Stranges PB, Avanesyan L, Stonebraker AC, Hu C, Wong FS, Szot GL, Bluestone JA, Gordon JI, Chervonsky AV |title=Innate immunity and intestinal microbiota in the development of Type 1 diabetes |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1109–13 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18806780 |doi=10.1038/nature07336 |pmc=2574766}}</ref>

NOD mice are also susceptible to developing other [[autoimmune]] syndromes, including autoimmunine sialitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy, a [[Lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]]-like disease that develops if mice are exposed to killed mycobacterium, and prostatitis.

== Identifying IDDM susceptibility loci ==
Genetic Loci associated with susceptibility to IDDM have been identified in the NOD mouse strain through the development of congenic mouse strains, which have identified several insulin dependent diabetes (Idd) loci.  
  
NOD mice have polymorphisms in the [[Idd3]] locus which are linked to IL-2 production. IL-2 promotes either immunity or tolerance in a concentration dependent fashion by acting on T helper cells, CTL and NK cells. Low amounts of IL-2 may be needed to promote survival of Treg in mice. Loss of IL-2 can thereby contribute to the development of autoimmunity in NOD mice.<ref name="pmid18468463">{{cite journal |author=Tang Q, Adams JY, Penaranda C, ''et al.'' |title=Central role of defective interleukin-2 production in the triggering of islet autoimmune destruction |journal=Immunity |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=687–97 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18468463 |pmc=2394854 |doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2008.03.016 |url=}}</ref>

NOD mice have a mutation in exon 2 of the CTLA-4 gene, which causes it to be spliced incorrectly. CTLA-4 plays a major role in suppressing the T-cell immune response. Without the proper functioning of CTLA-4 T-cells attack the insulin producing cells. This results in Type 1 Diabetes.<ref name="pmid:12724780">{{cite journal |author=Hironori Ueda, Joanna M, M.
