'''Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)''' are methods of [[birth control]] that provide effective [[contraception]] for an extended period of time without requiring user action. They include [[intrauterine devices]] (IUDs) and [[subdermal]] implants. They are the most effective reversible methods of contraception because they do not depend on patient compliance. So their 'typical use' failure rates, at less than 1% per year, are about the same as 'perfect use' failure rates.<ref name=pmid21668037>{{Cite pmid|21668037|noedit}}</ref> 

In addition to being long-lasting, convenient, and well liked by users, they are very cost effective.<ref name=pmid21668037 /> Typically, LARC users can save thousands of dollars over a five-year period compared to the use of [[condom]]s and [[birth control pill]]s.<ref name=pmid20634208>{{Cite pmid|20634208|noedit}}</ref> Despite their safety and effectiveness LARCs are underutilized: only 15.5% of women worldwide use IUDs, and only 3.4% use subdermal implants.<ref name=pmid20634208 />

Long-acting reversible contraception is recommended for [[adolescents]] to help decrease the teen pregnancy rate.<ref name=pmid22764557>{{Cite pmid|22764557|noedit}}</ref> LARCs are recommended for women of any age no matter how many times they have given birth.<ref name=pmid19641264>{{Cite pmid|19641264|noedit}}</ref> Women considering using LARCs should obtain [[family planning|contraceptive counseling from reproductive health professionals]] because those who do are more satisfied with them and use them for longer periods of time.<ref name=pmid20634208 />

==LARC methods==

Available LARC methods include IUDs and the subdermal implant:
* Hormonal intrauterine device ([[IUD with progestogen|Mirena]] - also known as IUC or IUS)
* Nonhormonal [[IUD with copper|intrauterine device with copper]] (US - [[Paragard|ParaGard]])
* Subdermal [[contraceptive implant]] (US - [[Nexplanon|Nexplanon/Implanon/Implanon NXT]]; internationally - [[Norplant|Norplant/Jadelle]])
Some shorter-acting methods are sometimes considered LARC:
* Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (DMPA; US - [[Depo Provera]] shot)
* [[Combined injectable contraceptive]]

==Efficacy==
The effectiveness of LARC methods has been shown to be superior to other types of birth control.<ref name=Mavranezouli2008>{{citation

A study in 2012, with the largest cohort of IUD and implant users to date, found that the risk of contraceptive failure for those using oral contraceptive pills, the birth control patch, or the vaginal ring was 20 times higher than the risk for those using long-acting reversible contraception.<ref name=Winner2012 /> For those under 21, who typically have lower adherence to drug regimens, the risk is twice as high as the risk among older participants.<ref name=Winner2012 /> 

The discrepancy between LARC methods and other forms of birth control lies in the difference between "perfect use" and "typical use". Perfect use indicates complete adherence to medication schedules and guidelines. Typical use describes effectiveness in real-world conditions, where patients may not fully adhere to medication regimens. LARC methods require little to no user action after insertion; therefore, LARC perfect use failure rates are the same as their typical use failure rates.<ref name=Trussel2007>{{citation

LARC failure rates rival that of sterilization, but unlike sterilization LARC methods are reversible.<ref name=Trussel2007 /> Other reversible methods, such as oral contraceptive pills, the birth control patch, or the vaginal ring require daily, weekly, or monthly action by the user. While the perfect use failure rates of those methods may equal LARC methods, the typical use failure rates are significantly higher.<ref name=Kost2008>{{citation

Even methods such as the DMPA injection require users to return to their provider every 12 weeks for the intramuscular shot or every 4 weeks for the subcutaneous shot. So, DMPA typical use failure rates are also higher than perfect use failure rates as more than 40% of women discontinue DMPA in the first year.<ref name=Peipert2011>{{citation

In both effectiveness and continuation, LARC methods are considered the first-line option for contraception.<ref name=Winner2012 />

==Cost==
LARC methods traditionally have a higher up-front cost as compared to other methods such as oral contraceptive pills, the patch, and the vaginal ring. However, LARC methods are some of the most cost-effective in the long term.<ref name=Cleland2011>{{citation

Regardless, the initial cost is still too high for many patients and is one of the biggest barriers to LARC use. Two recent studies done in California and St. Louis have shown that rates of LARC usage are dramatically higher when the costs of the methods are either covered or removed.<ref name=Post2007>{{citation

Like all contraceptive methods, access to LARC methods can reduce the rate of unintended pregnancy and result in significant cost savings to publicly funded health systems.<ref name=Cleland2011 /> A program geared toward increasing use of LARC among adolescents in Iowa demonstrated a significant decrease in the unintended pregnancy and abortion rate in that state along with a projected savings of $17.23 for every dollar spent on contraception for 14-19 year-olds.<ref name=Udeh2009>{{citation

==Promotion==
The United Kingdom Department of Health has actively promoted LARC use since 2008, particularly for young people;<ref>{{cite news |title=Increasing use of long-acting reversible contraception |publisher=Nursing Times.net |url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/increasing-use-of-long-acting-reversible-contraception/1902643.article |date=21 October 2008 |accessdate=23009-06-19}}</ref> following on from the October 2005 [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] guidelines, which promoted LARC provision in the United Kingdom, accurate and detailed counseling for women about these methods, and training of healthcare professionals to provide these methods.<ref>{{cite web |title=CG30 Long-acting reversible contraception: quick reference guide |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg030quickrefguide.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> Giving advice on these methods of contraception has been included in the 2009 [[Quality and Outcomes Framework]] "good practice" for primary care.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sexual Health Ruleset |work=New GMS Contract Quality and Outcome Framework - Implementation Dataset and Business Rules |url=http://www.pcc.nhs.uk/uploads/QOF/Business%20Rules%20v14/sexual_health_ruleset_r4_v14_0.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Primary Care Commissioning |date=01-May-2009 |accessdate=2009-06-19}}<br/>'''Sumarised at'''<br/>* {{cite web |title=Contraception - Management QOF indicators |url=http://cks.library.nhs.uk/contraception/management/goals_and_outcome_measures/qof_indicators |work = NHS Clinical  Knowledge Summaries |publisher= NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref>

According to other guildines released in 2009 by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, LARC methods are considered to be the first-line option for birth control in the United States, and are recommended for the majority of women.<ref>{{cite web |author= ACOG Committee Opinion 450 |title=Increasing the Use of Contraceptive Implants and Intrauterine Devices To Reduce Unintended Pregancy |publisher= American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |url=http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Gynecologic_Practice/Increasing_Use_of_Contraceptive_Implants_and_Intrauterine_Devices_To_Reduce_Unintended_Pregnancy |date= December 2009 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref>
According to the CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, LARC methods are recommended for the majority of women who are post-menarche (i.e. have had their first menstruation), regardless of parity.<ref>{{cite web

Increasing access to long-acting reversible contraceptives was listed by the CDC as one of the top public health priorities for reducing teen pregnancy and unintended pregnancy in the United States.<ref>{{cite web
