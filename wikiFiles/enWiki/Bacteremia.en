'''Bacteremia''' (also '''bacteraemia''' or '''bacteræmia''') is the presence of [[bacteria]] in the [[blood]]. The blood is normally a [[Asepsis|sterile]] environment{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, so the detection of bacteria in the blood (most commonly accomplished by [[blood culture]]s) is always abnormal.

Bacteria can enter the bloodstream as a severe complication of [[infection]]s (like [[pneumonia]] or [[meningitis]]), during surgery (especially when involving [[mucous membranes]] such as the [[gastrointestinal tract]]), or due to [[catheters]] and other [[foreign bodies]] entering the [[arteries]] or [[veins]] (including [[intravenous]] [[drug abuse]]).

Bacteremia can have several consequences. The [[immune response]] to the bacteria can cause [[sepsis]] and [[septic shock]], which has a relatively high [[mortality rate]]. Bacteria can also use the blood to spread to other parts of the body (which is called [[hematogenous]] spread), causing infections away from the original site of infection. Examples include [[endocarditis]] or [[osteomyelitis]]. Treatment is with [[antibiotics]], and prevention with [[Antimicrobial prophylaxis|antibiotic prophylaxis]] can be given in situations where problems are to be expected.

==Definition==
Bacteremia is the presence of viable bacteria in the blood stream. 
Bacteremia is different from [[sepsis]] (so-called blood poisoning or toxemia), which is a condition where bacteremia is associated with an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] response from the body (causing [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]], characterised by [[tachypnea|rapid breathing]], [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[fever]], etc.). Common oral hygiene, such as [[toothbrush|brushing teeth]] or flossing, can cause transient but harmless bacteremia.<ref name="Forner">{{cite journal| author=Forner L, Larsen T, Kilian M, Holmstrup P| title=Incidence of bacteremia after chewing, tooth brushing and scaling in individuals with periodontal inflammation | journal=J Clin Periodontol | year= 2006 | volume= 33 | issue= 6 | pages= 401–7 | pmid=16677328 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-051X.2006.00924.x }}</ref> Some patients with [[prosthetic heart valve]]s however need [[antibiotic]] prophylaxis for dental surgery because bacteremia might lead to [[endocarditis]] ([[infection]] causing inflammation of the interior lining of the [[heart]]).

[[Septicemia]] is an ill-defined non-scientific term introducing more confusion between sepsis and bacteremia: it misleadingly suggests there is something in the bloodstream causing sepsis.

==Causes==
In the hospital, indwelling [[catheter]]s are a frequent cause of bacteremia and subsequent [[nosocomial]] infections, because they provide a means by which bacteria normally found on the skin can enter the bloodstream. Other causes of bacteremia include dental procedures (occasionally including simple tooth brushing), [[herpes]] (including [[herpetic whitlow]]), [[urinary tract infection]]s, [[peritonitis]], [[Clostridium difficile colitis|''Clostridium difficile'' colitis]], intravenous drug use, and [[colorectal cancer]]. Bacteremia may also be seen in [[oropharyngeal]], [[gastrointestinal]] or [[genitourinary]] [[surgery]] or exploration. [[Salmonella]] infection, despite mainly only resulting in gastroenteritis in the developed world, is a common cause of bacteremia in Africa. It principally affects children who lack antibodies to Salmonella and HIV+ patients of all ages.

==Consequences==
Bacteremia, as noted above, frequently elicits a vigorous immune system response. The constellation of findings related to this response (such as [[fever]], chills, or [[hypotension]]) is referred to as [[sepsis]]. In the setting of more severe disturbances of temperature, respiration, heart rate or [[white blood cell]] count, the response is characterized as [[septic shock]], and may result in ''[[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]]''.

Bacteremia is the principal means by which local [[infection]]s are spread to distant organs (referred to as ''hematogenous spread''). Bacteremia is typically transient rather than continuous, due to a vigorous [[immune system]] response when bacteria are detected in the blood. Hematogenous dissemination of bacteria is part of the pathophysiology of [[meningitis]] and [[endocarditis]], and of [[Pott's disease]] and many other forms of [[osteomyelitis]].

==Diagnosis==
Bacteremia is most commonly diagnosed by [[blood culture]], in which a sample of blood is allowed to [[Incubator (microbiology)|incubate]] with a [[microbiological medium|medium]] that promotes bacterial growth. Since blood is normally sterile, this process does not normally lead to the isolation of bacteria. If, however, bacteria are present in the bloodstream at the time the sample is obtained, the bacteria will multiply and can thereby be detected. Any bacteria that incidentally find their way to the culture medium will also multiply. For this reason, blood cultures must be drawn with great attention to sterile process. Occasionally, blood cultures will reveal the presence of bacteria that represent contamination from the [[skin]] through which the culture was obtained. Blood cultures must be repeated at intervals to determine if persistent &mdash; rather than transient &mdash; bacteremia is present.
