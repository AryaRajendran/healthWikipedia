'''Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome''', '''CAPS''', also known as '''Asherson’s syndrome''', is an [[Acute (medical)|acute]] and complex biological process that leads to [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]] of small vessels of various organs. It was first described by [[Ronald Asherson]] in 1992. The syndrome exhibits [[thrombosis|thrombotic]] [[microangiopathy]], [[multiple organ thrombosis]], and in some cases  [[tissue necrosis]] and is considered an [[extreme value|extreme]] or catastrophic variant of the [[antiphospholipid syndrome]]. Two other variants are primary antiphospholipid syndrome and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome as discovered in 1983 by Dr Graham Hughes and his team in London.  To better understand what differentiates the three according the doctor who discovered them please go to http://www.hughes-syndrome.org/overview.htm .

CAPS has a mortality rate of about 50%. With the establishment of a CAPS-Registry more has been learned about this syndrome, yet the cause remains elusive. Infection, trauma, medication, or surgery can be identified in about half the cases as a “trigger”. It is thought that cytokines are activated leading to a [[cytokine storm]] with the potentially fatal consequences of organ failure. [[Thrombocytopenia]] is a common finding.  Patients exhibit a positive test to antilipid antibodies, typically IgG, and may or may not have a history of [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]] or another [[connective tissue disease]]  Association with another disease such as lupus is called a secondary APS. Unless it includes the defining criteria for CAPS. 

Clinically, the syndrome affects at least three organs and may affect many organs systems. Peripheral thrombosis may be encountered affecting veins & arteries. Intraabdominal thrombosis may lead to pain. Cardiovascular, Nervous, Heart, Renal and Pulmonary system complications are common. The patient may exhibit skin purpura and necrosis. Cerebral manifestations may lead to encephalopathy and seizures.  Myocardial infarctions may occur. Strokes may occur due to the arterial clotting involvement.  Death may result from multiple organ failure. 

Treatments may involve the following steps:
* Prevention includes the use of [[antibiotic]]s for infection and parenteral [[anticoagulation]] for susceptible patients.
* Specific therapy includes the use of  intravenous [[heparin]] and [[corticosteroid]]s,<ref>[http://www.mdconsult.com/das/pdxmd/body/141051084-2/0?type=med&eid=9-u1.0-_1_mt_1011037 MD Consult] Retrieved on 2009-06-02</ref> and possibly [[plasma exchange]]s, intravenous [[immunoglobulin]].
* Additional steps may have to be taken to manage circulatory problems, [[renal failure]], and [[respiratory distress]].
