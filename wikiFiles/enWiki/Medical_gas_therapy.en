==Nitric oxide==
'''Nitric oxide''' — [[Nitric oxide]] is a gas that is inhaled.<ref name="pmid10450191"/> It works by relaxing [[smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] to widen (dilate) [[blood vessels]], especially in the lungs.<ref name="pmid10450191"/>  [[Nitric oxide]] is used together with a [[mechanical ventilator]] to treat [[respiratory failure]] in [[premature infants]].<ref name="pmid10450191"/>

==Helium and oxygen==
'''Heliox''' —  In medicine [[heliox]] generally refers to a mixture of 21% O<sub>2</sub> (the same as [[air]]) and 79% He, although other combinations are available.

[[Heliox]] generates less airway resistance than air and thereby requires less mechanical energy to [[ventilate]] the lungs.<ref name="BOCheox21">{{cite web |url=http://www.bochealthcare.co.uk/en/products/heliox/index.shtml |title=Heliox21 |publisher=Linde Gas Therapeutics |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref> "Work of Breathing" (WOB) is reduced. It does this by two mechanisms:
# increased tendency to [[laminar flow]];
# reduced resistance in [[turbulent flow]].
Heliox has a similar [[viscosity]] to air but a significantly lower [[density]] (0.5&nbsp;g/l versus 1.2&nbsp;5g/l at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]). Flow of gas through the [[airways]] comprises [[laminar flow]], transitional flow and [[turbulent flow]]. The tendency for each type of flow is described by the [[Reynolds number]]. [[Heliox]]'s low density produces a lower [[Reynolds number]] and hence higher probability of laminar flow for any given airway. [[Laminar flow]] tends to generate less resistance than turbulent flow.

In the small airways where flow is laminar, resistance is proportional to gas [[viscosity]] and is not related to [[density]] and so [[heliox]] has little effect. The [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]] describes laminar resistance. In the large airways where flow is turbulent, resistance is proportional to density, so [[heliox]] has a significant effect.

Heliox has been used medically since the early 1930s. It was the mainstay of treatment in acute [[asthma]] before the advent of [[bronchodilators]]. Currently, heliox is mainly used in conditions of large airway narrowing (upper airway obstruction from tumors or foreign bodies and [[vocal cord dysfunction]]). There is also some use of heliox in conditions of the medium airways ([[croup]], asthma and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]).

Patients with these conditions may suffer a range of symptoms including [[dyspnea]] (breathlessness), [[hypoxemia]] (below-normal oxygen content in the arterial blood) and eventually a weakening of the respiratory muscles due to [[exhaustion]], which can lead to [[respiratory failure]] and require [[intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]]. Heliox may reduce all these effects, making it easier for the patient to breathe.<ref name="BOCMdata">{{cite web |url=http://www.bocmedical.co.uk/product_information/Medical_Helium_Oxygen_Mix_172.pdf |title=Heliox data sheet |author=BOC Medical}}</ref> Heliox has also found utility in the weaning of patients off mechanical ventilation, and in the nebulization of inhalable drugs, particularly for the elderly.<ref name="AnaesUK">{{cite journal |author=Lee DL, Hsu CW, Lee H, Chang HW, Huang YC |title=Beneficial effects of albuterol therapy driven by heliox versus by oxygen in severe asthma exacerbation |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=820–7 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16141015 |doi=10.1197/j.aem.2005.04.020 |url=http://www.anaesthesiauk.com/article.aspx?articleid=100375 |accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Research has also indicated advantages in using helium–oxygen mixtures in delivery of [[anaesthesia]].<ref name="BJA">{{cite journal |author=Buczkowski PW, Fombon FN, Russell WC, Thompson JP |title=Effects of helium on high frequency jet ventilation in model of airway stenosis |journal=Br J Anaesth |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=701–5 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16143576 |doi=10.1093/bja/aei229 |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16143576 |accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>
