'''Chromium deficiency''' is a proposed disorder that results from an insufficient dietary intake of [[chromium]]. It is an unlikely condition.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1999.tb06909.x |last=Jeejeebhoy |first=Khursheed N. |title=The role of chromium in nutrition and therapeutics and as a potential toxin |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=57 |issue=11 |pages=329–335 |year=1999 |pmid=10628183}}</ref><ref name=Porter>{{cite journal |last=Porter |first=David J. |coauthors=Raymond, Lawrence W.; Anastasio, Geraldine D. |title=Chromium: friend or foe? |journal=Archives of Family Medicine |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=386–390 |year=1999 |pmid=10500510 |url=http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10500510 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050109213713/http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/8/5/386.pdf |archivedate=January 9, 2005 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref> Clear cases of deficiency have only been observed in hospital patients who were fed defined liquid diets intravenously for long periods of time.<ref name=Expert>{{cite web|title=Review of Chromium|year=2002|month=August|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/reviewofchrome.pdf|accessdate=February 24, 2013|author=Expert group on Vitamins and Minerals}}</ref>

==Dietary guidelines==
The US dietary guidelines for adequate daily chromium intake were lowered in 2001 from 50–200&nbsp;µg for an adult to 30–35&nbsp;µg (adult male) and to 20–25&nbsp;µg (adult female).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Trumbo |first=Paula |coauthors=Yates, Allison A.; Schlicker, Sandra; Poos, Mary |title=Dietary reference intakes: vitamin A, vitamin K, arsenic, boron, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, vanadium, and zinc |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=294–301 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11269606 |doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(01)00078-5}}</ref> These amounts were set to be the same as the average amounts consumed by healthy individuals. Consequently, it is thought that few Americans are chromium deficient.<ref name=Vincent>{{cite journal|last=Vincent|first=John B.|title=Chromium: celebrating 50 years as an essential element?|journal=Dalton Transactions|year=2010|volume=39|issue=16|pages=3787–3794|doi=10.1039/B920480F|pmid=20372701}}</ref>

Chromium may fall in the same category as manganese, where it is likely that many people get too much.

Approximately 2% of ingested chromium(III) is absorbed, with the remainder being excreted in the feces.  Amino acids, vitamin C and niacin may enhance the uptake of chromium from the intestinal tract.<ref name=Lukaski>{{cite journal |last=Lukaski |first=Henry C.|title=Chromium as a supplement |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=279–302 |year=1999 |pmid=10448525 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.19.1.279}}</ref> After absorption, this metal accumulates in the liver, bone, and spleen.

Trivalent chromium is found in a wide range of foods, including: whole-grain products, processed meats, high-bran breakfast cereals, coffee, nuts, green beans, broccoli, spices, and some brands of wine and beer.<ref name=Lukaski/> Most fruits and vegetables and dairy products only contain low amounts.<ref name=Expert/> Most of the chromium in people's diet comes from processing or storing food in pans and cans made of [[stainless steel]], which can contain up to 18% chromium.<ref name=Expert/>

The amount of chromium in the body can be decreased as a result of a diet high in [[simple sugar]]s, which increases the excretion of the metal through urine.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kozlovsky |first=Adriane S. |coauthors=Moser, Phylis B.; Reiser, Sheldon; Anderson, Richard A.|title=Effects of diets high in simple sugars on urinary chromium losses |journal=Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=515–518 |year=1986 |pmid=3713513 |doi=10.1016/0026-0495(86)90007-7}}</ref> Because of the high excretion rates and the very low absorption rates of most forms of chromium, [[acute toxicity]] is uncommon.

==Symptoms==
The symptoms of chromium deficiency caused by long-term [[total parenteral nutrition]] are severely [[impaired glucose tolerance]], a loss of weight, and confusion.<ref name=Freund/> Another patient also developed nerve damage ([[peripheral neuropathy]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jeejeebhoy |first=Khursheed N. |coauthors=Chu, Richard C.; Marliss, Errol B.; Greenberg, Gordon R.; Bruce-Robertson, Alan|title=Chromium deficiency, glucose intolerance, and neuropathy reversed by chromium supplementation, in a patient receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=531–538 |month=April |year=1977 |pmid=192066 |url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/30/4/531.full.pdf}}</ref>

==Supplementation==

In a mouse model, Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF) was found to exert remarkable beneficial insulin-mimetic and insulin-potentiating effects, both in vivo and in vitro.  It was seen to produce an insulin-like effect by acting on cellular signals downstream of the insulin receptor. These beneficial results suggest Glucose Tolerance Factor as a potential source for a novel oral medication for diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weksler-Zangen|first=Sarah|coauthors=Mizrahi, Tal; Raz, Itamar; Mirsky, Nitsa|title=Glucose tolerance factor extracted from yeast: oral insulin-mimetic and insulin-potentiating agent: in vivo and in vitro studies|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|year=2012|month=September|volume=108|issue=5|pages=875–882|doi=10.1017/S0007114511006167|pmid=22172158}}</ref> Similar favorable blood sugar changes as well as markers for resistance to oxidative stress when compared to controls were observed in an experimental group of human volunteers receiving chromium-enriched yeast (yeast grown on chromium-rich nutrients).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Racek|first=Jaroslav|coauthors=Trefil, Ladislav; Rajdl, Daniel; Mudrova, Vlasta; Hunter, Douglas; Senft, Václav|title=Influence of chromium-enriched yeast on blood glucose and insulin variables, blood lipids, and markers of oxidative stress in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus|journal=Biological Trace Element Research|year=2006|month=March|volume=109|issue=3|pages=215–230|doi=10.1385/BTER:109:3:215|pmid=16632892}}</ref>  

Although it is controversial whether supplements should be taken by healthy adults eating a normal diet,<ref name=Porter/> chromium is needed as a component of the defined liquid diet that is given to patients receiving [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN), since deficiency can occur after many months of this highly restricted diet.<ref name=Freund>{{cite journal |last=Freund |first=Herbert |coauthors=Atamian, Susan; Fischer, Josef E. |title=Chromium deficiency during total parenteral nutrition |journal=JAMA |volume=241 |issue=5 |pages=496–498 |year=1979 |month=February |pmid=104057 |doi=10.1001/jama.241.5.496}}</ref> As a result chromium is added to normal TPN solutions,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=R. A. |title=Chromium and parenteral nutrition |journal=Nutrition |volume=11 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=83–86 |year=1995 |pmid=7749258}}</ref> although the trace amounts from even in "chromium free" preparations may be enough to prevent deficiency in some individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kien |first=C. L. |coauthors=Veillon, C.; Patterson, K. Y.; Farrell, P. M. |title=Mild peripheral neuropathy but biochemical chromium sufficiency during 16 months of "chromium-free" total parenteral nutrition |journal=Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=662–664 |year=1986 |pmid=3099015 |doi=10.1177/0148607186010006662}}</ref> Indeed, a 1992 paper in ''[[The Lancet]]'' suggested that adding chromium to feeding solutions given to children produces excessive levels of this metal in their bodies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moukarzel |first=A. A. |coauthors=Song,  M. K.; Buchman, A. L.; ''et al.'' |title=Excessive chromium intake in children receiving total parenteral nutrition |journal=Lancet |volume=339 |issue=8790 |pages=385–388 |year=1992 |pmid=1346659 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(92)90078-H}}</ref>

[[Image:Chromium picolinate.png|thumb|[[Chromium picolinate]]]]  
A proprietary synthetic biomolecule containing chromium is [[chromium polynicotinate]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Preuss|first=H. G.|coauthors=Bagchi, D.; Bagchi, M.; Rao, C. V. S.; Dey, D. K.; Satyanarayana, S.|title=Effects of a natural extract of (–)-hydroxycitric acid (HCA-SX) and a combination of HCA-SX plus niacin-bound chromium and Gymnema sylvestre extract on weight loss|journal=Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism|year=2004|month=May|volume=6|issue=3|pages=171–180|doi=10.1111/j.1462-8902.2004.00328.x|pmid=15056124}}</ref> This patented proprietary formulation is purported to correct imbalances in [[glucose metabolism]] due to chromium deficiency, even though the occurrence of such a deficiency is extremely rare in countries where the supplement is sold. The mechanism by which this complex enters the cells in the body differs from that for the introduction of trivalent chromium found naturally in food does, and for this reason the safety of this supplement is debatable, since chromium is toxic at high levels.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bagchi |first=Debasis |coauthors=Stohs, Sidney J.; Downs, Bernard W.; Bagchi, Manashi; Preuss, Harry G. |title=Cytotoxicity and oxidative mechanisms of different forms of chromium |journal=Toxicology |volume=180 |issue=1 |pages=5–22 |year=2002 |pmid=12324196 |doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00378-5}}</ref> Moreover, recent studies "have concluded that chromium supplements have no demonstrated effects on healthy individuals" and chromium picolinate in particular is described as a "poor choice" as a supplement.<ref name="Vincent" /> A [[meta-analysis]] in 2002 found no effect on blood [[glucose]] or [[insulin]] in healthy people, and the data were inconclusive for diabetics.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Althuis |first=Michelle D. |coauthors=Jordan, Nicole E.; Ludington, Elizabeth A.; Wittes, Janet T.|title=Glucose and insulin responses to dietary chromium supplements: a meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=148–155 |month=July |year=2002 |pmid=12081828 |url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/76/1/148.full.pdf |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref> Subsequent trials gave mixed results, with one finding no effect in people with impaired glucose tolerance,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gunton |first=Jenny E. |coauthors=Cheung, N.
