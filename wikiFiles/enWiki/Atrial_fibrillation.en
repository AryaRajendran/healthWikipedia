'''Atrial fibrillation''' ('''AF''' or '''A-fib''') is the most common [[cardiac arrhythmia]] (irregular heart beat). It may cause [[asymptomatic|no symptoms]], but it is often associated with [[palpitations]], [[fainting]], [[Angina pectoris|chest pain]], or [[congestive heart failure]]. However, in some people atrial fibrillation is caused by otherwise [[idiopathic]] or benign conditions.

AF increases the risk of [[stroke]]; the degree of stroke risk can be up to seven times that of the average population, depending on the presence of additional risk factors (such as [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]). It may be identified clinically when taking a [[pulse]], and the presence of AF can be confirmed with an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG or EKG) which demonstrates the absence of [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P waves]] together with an irregular ventricular rate.

In AF, the normal regular electrical impulses generated by the [[sinoatrial node]] are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical impulses usually originating in the roots of the [[pulmonary veins]], leading to irregular conduction of impulses to the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] which generate the heartbeat. AF may occur in episodes lasting from minutes to days ("paroxysmal"), or be permanent in nature. A number of medical conditions increase the risk of AF, particularly [[mitral stenosis]] (narrowing of the [[mitral valve]] of the heart).

Atrial fibrillation may be treated with medications to either slow the heart rate to a normal range ("rate control") or revert the heart rhythm back to normal ("rhythm control"). Synchronized electrical [[cardioversion]] can be used to convert AF to a normal heart rhythm. Surgical and catheter-based therapies may be used to prevent recurrence of AF in certain individuals. Depending on the risk of stroke and systemic embolism, people with AF may use [[anticoagulant]]s such as [[warfarin]], which substantially reduces the risk but may increase the risk of major bleeding, mainly in geriatric patients. The prevalence of AF in a population increases with age, with 8% of people over 80 having AF. Chronic AF leads to a small increase in the risk of death.

The [[American College of Cardiology]] (ACC), [[American Heart Association]] (AHA), and the [[European Society of Cardiology]] (ESC) recommend in their guidelines the following classification system based on simplicity and clinical relevance.<ref name="pmid16908781">{{cite journal |author=Fuster V |title=ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology Committee for Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Revise the 2001 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society |journal=Circulation |volume=114 |issue=7 |pages=e257–354 |year=2006 |pmid=16908781 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.177292 |author-separator=, |author2=Rydén LE |author3=Cannom DS |display-authors=3 |last4=Crijns |first4=HJ |last5=Curtis |first5=AB |last6=Ellenbogen |first6=KA |last7=Halperin |first7=JL |last8=Le Heuzey |first8=JY |last9=Kay |first9=GN}}</ref>

All atrial fibrillation patients are initially in the category called ''first detected AF''. These patients may or may not have had previous undetected episodes. If a first detected episode self-terminates in less than 7&nbsp;days and then another episode begins later on, the case has moved into the category of ''paroxysmal AF''. Although patients in this category have episodes lasting up to 7&nbsp;days, in most cases of paroxysmal AF the episodes will self-terminate in less than 24&nbsp;hours. If instead the episode lasts for more than 7&nbsp;days, it is unlikely to self-terminate,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Levy S | title=Classification system of atrial fibrillation | journal=Curr Opin Cardiol | year=2000 | pages=54–7 | volume=15 | issue=1  | doi=10.1097/00001573-200001000-00007 | pmid = 10666661 }}</ref> and it is called ''persistent AF''. In this case, the episode may be still terminated by cardioversion. If cardioversion is unsuccessful or it is not attempted, and the episode is ongoing for a long time (e.g., a year or more), the patient's AF is called ''permanent''.

Episodes that last less than 30&nbsp;seconds are not considered in this classification system. Also, this system does not apply to cases where the AF is a secondary condition that occurs in the setting of a primary condition that may be the cause of the AF.

Using this classification system, it's not always clear what an AF case should be called. For example, a case may fit into the paroxysmal AF category some of the time, while other times it may have the characteristics of persistent AF. One may be able to decide which category is more appropriate by determining which one occurs most often in the case under consideration.

In addition to the above four AF categories, which are mainly defined by episode timing and termination, the ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines describe additional AF categories in terms of  other characteristics of the patient.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>
* ''Lone atrial fibrillation'' (LAF) – absence of clinical or [[echocardiographic]] findings of other [[cardiovascular disease]] (including [[hypertension]]), related pulmonary disease, or cardiac abnormalities such as enlargement of the left atrium, and age under 60&nbsp;years
* ''Nonvalvular AF'' – absence of [[rheumatic heart disease|rheumatic]] mitral valve disease, a [[prosthetic heart valve]], or [[mitral valve repair]]
* ''Secondary AF'' – occurs in the setting of a primary condition which may be the cause of the AF, such as [[acute myocardial infarction]], [[cardiac surgery]], [[pericarditis]], [[myocarditis]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[pneumonia]], or other acute pulmonary disease

==Signs and symptoms==
Atrial fibrillation is usually accompanied by symptoms related to a rapid heart rate. Rapid and irregular heart rates may be perceived as [[palpitations]], [[exercise intolerance]], and occasionally produce [[Angina pectoris|angina]] (if the rate is faster and puts the heart under strain) and [[heart failure|congestive]] symptoms of [[shortness of breath]] or [[edema]]. Sometimes the arrhythmia will be identified only with the onset of a stroke or a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA). It is not uncommon for a patient to first become aware of AF from a routine physical examination or [[electrocardiogram|ECG]], as it may be asymptomatic in many cases.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

As most cases of atrial fibrillation are secondary to other medical problems, the presence of [[chest pain]] or [[angina]], symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]] (an overactive [[thyroid gland]]) such as [[weight loss]] and [[diarrhea]], and symptoms suggestive of [[lung disease]] would indicate an underlying cause. A history of stroke or TIA, as well as [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[heart failure]] and [[rheumatic fever]], may indicate whether someone with AF is at a higher risk of complications.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

===Rapid heart rate===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
Presentation is similar to other forms of rapid heart rate ([[tachycardia]]), and in some cases may actually be asymptomatic. The patient may complain of [[palpitations]] or chest discomfort. The rapid heart rate may result in the heart being unable to provide adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the rest of the body. Therefore, common symptoms may include shortness of breath which often worsens with exertion ([[dyspnea on exertion]]), shortness of breath when lying flat ([[orthopnea]]), and sudden onset of shortness of breath during the night ([[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea]]), and may progress to swelling of the lower extremities ([[peripheral edema]]). Owing to inadequate blood flow, patients may also complain of [[light-headedness]], may feel like they are about to faint ([[presyncope]]), or may actually lose consciousness ([[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]]).

The patient may be in significant [[respiratory distress]]. Because of inadequate oxygen delivery, the patient may appear blue ([[cyanosis]]). By definition, the heart rate will be greater than 100 beats per minute. Blood pressure will be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital (oscillometric) [[Sphygmomanometer|non-invasive blood pressure]] monitors. It is most worrying if consistently lower than usual ([[hypotension]]). Respiratory rate will be increased in the presence of respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may confirm the presence of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] related to any precipitating factors such as [[pneumonia]].
Examination of the [[jugular veins]] may reveal elevated [[jugular venous pressure|pressure]] (jugular venous distention).
Lung exam may reveal [[rales]] or crackles, which are suggestive of [[pulmonary edema]]. Heart exam will reveal an irregular but rapid rhythm.

===Association with other conditions===
* [[Central sleep apnea]] (CSA) – A study found that  the prevalence of atrial fibrillation among patients with idiopathic central sleep apnea was significantly higher than the prevalence among patients with [[obstructive sleep apnea]] or no [[sleep apnea]] (27%, 1.7%, and 3.3%, respectively). There was a total of 180 subjects with  60 people in each of the 3 groups. Possible explanations for the association between CSA and AF are a causal relationship between the two conditions, or an abnormality of central cardiorespiratory regulation.<ref name='Leung2005'>{{cite journal | title = Association between atrial fibrillation and central sleep apnea | journal = Sleep | date = 2005-12-01 | first = RS | last = Leung | coauthors = Huber MA, Rogge T, Maimon N, Chiu KL, Bradley TD | volume = 28 | issue = 12 | pages = 1543–6| pmid = 16408413 | url = http://www.journalsleep.org/Articles/281210.pdf}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[File:RapidAFib150.jpg|thumb|A 12 lead ECG showing atrial fibrillation at approximately 150 beats per minute]]
The evaluation of atrial fibrillation involves diagnosis, determination of the [[etiology]] of the arrhythmia, and classification of the arrhythmia.  The minimal evaluation of atrial fibrillation is a history and physical examination, ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram, and case specific bloodwork.  Depending upon given resources, afflicted individuals may benefit from an in-depth evaluation which may include correlation of the heart rate response to exercise, exercise stress testing, chest X-ray, trans-esophageal echocardiography, and other studies.

If a patient presents with a sudden onset of severe symptoms other forms of [[tachyarrhythmia]] must be ruled-out, as some may be immediately life threatening, such as [[ventricular tachycardia]]. While most patients will be placed on continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, an [[electrocardiogram]] is essential for diagnosis.

Provoking causes should be sought out. A common cause of any tachycardia is [[dehydration]], as well as other forms of [[hypovolemia]]. [[Acute coronary syndrome]] should be ruled out. Intercurrent illness such as [[pneumonia]] may be present.

===Screening===
[[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] for atrial fibrillation is not generally performed, although a study of routine pulse checks or ECGs during routine office visits found that the annual rate of detection of AF in elderly patients improved from 1.04% to 1.63%; selection of patients for prophylactic anticoagulation would improve stroke risk in that age category.<ref name="pmid17673732">{{cite journal |author=Fitzmaurice DA |title=Screening versus routine practice in detection of atrial fibrillation in patients aged 65 or over: cluster randomised controlled trial |journal= BMJ|volume= 335|issue=  7616|pages=383|year=2007 |pmid=17673732 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39280.660567.55 |pmc=1952508 |author-separator=, |author2=Hobbs FD |author3=Jowett S |display-authors=3 |last4=Mant |first4=J. |last5=Murray |first5=E. T |last6=Holder |first6=R. |last7=Raftery |first7=J P |last8=Bryan |first8=S |last9=Davies |first9=M.}}</ref>

This estimated [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] of the routine primary care visit is 64%. This low result probably reflects the pulse not being checked routinely or carefully.<ref name="pmid17673732"/>

When ECGs are used for screening, the SAFE trial found that electronic software, [[primary care physician]]s and the combination of the two had the following sensitivities and specificities:<ref name="pmid17604299">{{cite journal |author=Mant J |title=Accuracy of diagnosing atrial fibrillation on electrocardiogram by primary care practitioners and interpretative diagnostic software: analysis of data from screening for atrial fibrillation in the elderly (SAFE) trial |journal= BMJ|volume= 335|issue=  7616|pages=380|year=2007 |pmid=17604299 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39227.551713.AE |pmc=1952490 |author-separator=, |author2=Fitzmaurice DA |author3=Hobbs FD |display-authors=3 |last4=Jowett |first4=S. |last5=Murray |first5=E. T |last6=Holder |first6=R. |last7=Davies |first7=M. |last8=Lip |first8=G. Y H}}</ref>
* Interpreted by software: [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] = 83%, [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] = 99%
* Interpreted by a primary care physician: sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 92%
* Interpreted by a primary care physician with software: sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 91%

===Minimal evaluation===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
The minimal evaluation of atrial fibrillation should generally be performed in all individuals with AF.  The goal of this evaluation is to determine the general treatment regimen for the individual.  If results of the general evaluation warrant it, further studies may then be performed.

====History and physical examination====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
The history of the individual's atrial fibrillation episodes is probably the most important part of the evaluation.  Distinctions should be made between those who are entirely asymptomatic when they are in AF (in which case the AF is found as an incidental finding on an ECG or physical examination) and those who have gross and obvious symptoms due to AF and can pinpoint whenever they go into AF or revert to sinus rhythm.

====Routine bloodwork====
While many cases of AF have no definite cause, it may be the result of various other problems (see below). Hence, [[renal function]] and [[electrolyte]]s are routinely determined, as well as [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (commonly suppressed in [[hyperthyroidism]] and of relevance if [[amiodarone]] is administered for treatment) and a [[complete blood count|blood count]].<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

In acute-onset AF associated with [[chest pain]], [[troponin|cardiac troponins]] or other markers of damage to the heart muscle may be ordered. [[Coagulation]] studies ([[International normalized ratio|INR]]/aPTT) are usually performed, as [[anticoagulant]] medication may be commenced.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

====Electrocardiogram====
[[File:Afib ecg.jpg|thumb|400px|right|[[electrocardiogram|ECG]] of atrial fibrillation (top) and normal sinus rhythm (bottom). The purple arrow indicates a P wave, which is lost in atrial fibrillation.]]

Atrial fibrillation is diagnosed on an electrocardiogram (ECG), an investigation performed routinely whenever an irregular heart beat is suspected. Characteristic findings are the absence of P waves, with disorganized electrical activity in their place, and irregular R-R intervals due to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles.<ref name="pmid16908781"/> At very fast heart rates atrial fibrillation may look more regular which may make it more difficult to separate from SVT or ventricular tachycardia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zipes|first=Ziad F. Issa, John M. Miller, Douglas P.|title=Clinical arrhythmology and electrophysiology : a companion to Braunwald's heart disease|year=2009|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-5998-1|page=221|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=a8s8nd2JAiwC&pg=PA221}}</ref>

[[QRS complex]]es should be narrow, signifying that they are initiated by normal conduction of atrial electrical activity through the [[Electrical conduction system of the heart|intraventricular conduction system]]. Wide QRS complexes are worrisome for [[ventricular tachycardia]], although in cases where there is disease of the conduction system, wide complexes may be present in A-Fib with rapid ventricular response.

If paroxysmal AF is suspected but an ECG during an office visit only shows a regular rhythm, AF episodes may be detected and documented with the use of ambulatory [[Holter monitor]]ing (e.g. for a day). If the episodes are too infrequent to be detected by Holter monitoring with reasonable probability, then the patient can be monitored for longer periods (e.g. a month)  with an ambulatory [[cardiac event monitor|event monitor]].<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

====Echocardiography====
A non-invasive transthoracic [[echocardiogram]] (TTE) is generally performed in newly diagnosed AF, as well as if there is a major change in the patient's clinical state. This ultrasound-based scan of the heart may help identify [[valvular heart disease]] (which may greatly increase the risk of stroke), left and right atrial size (which indicates likelihood that AF may become permanent), left ventricular size and function, peak right ventricular pressure ([[pulmonary hypertension]]), presence of left atrial thrombus (low sensivity), presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and pericardial disease.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

Significant enlargement of both the left and right atria is associated with long-standing atrial fibrillation and, if noted at the initial presentation of atrial fibrillation, suggests that the atrial fibrillation is likely to be of a longer duration than the individual's symptoms.

===Extended evaluation===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
An extended evaluation is generally not necessary in most individuals with atrial fibrillation, and is only performed if abnormalities are noted in the limited evaluation, if a reversible cause of the atrial fibrillation is suggested, or if further evaluation may change the treatment course.

====Chest X-ray====
A [[chest X-ray]] is generally only performed if a pulmonary cause of atrial fibrillation is suggested, or if other cardiac conditions are suspected (particularly [[congestive heart failure]].) This may reveal an underlying problem in the lungs or the blood vessels in the chest.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>  In particular, if an underlying pneumonia is suggested, then treatment of the pneumonia may cause the atrial fibrillation to terminate on its own.

====Transesophageal echocardiogram====
A normal echocardiography (transthoracic or TTE) has a low sensitivity for identifying [[thrombus|thrombi]] (blood clots) in the heart.  If this is suspected (e.g., when planning urgent electrical cardioversion) a [[Echocardiogram#Transesophageal echocardiogram|transesophageal echocardiogram]] (TEE or TOE where British spelling is used) is preferred.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

The TEE has much better visualization of the [[left atrial appendage]] than transthoracic echocardiography.  This structure, located in the [[left atrium]], is the place where thrombus is formed in more than 90% of cases in non-valvular (or non-rheumatic) atrial fibrillation or [[Atrial Flutter|flutter]].<ref name="pmid8572814"/> TEE has a high sensitivity for locating thrombi in this area<ref name='Acar1991'>{{cite journal|title=Diagnosis of left atrial thrombi in mitral stenosis – usefulness of ultrasound techniques compared with other methods|journal=European Heart Journal|year=1991|author= Acar J |volume=12 (Supplement B)|issue=Jul|pages=70–6|pmid=1936030 |url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/suppl_B/70|format=|accessdate=2009-10-20|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/12.suppl_B.70|doi_brokendate=2010-07-27|author-separator=,|author2=Cormier B|author3=Grimberg D <!-- Kawthekar G, Iung B, Scheur B, Farah E -->|display-authors=3|last4=Kawthekar|first4=G|last5=Iung|first5=B|last6=Scheuer|first6=B|last7=Farah|first7=E }}</ref> and can also detect sluggish bloodflow in this area that is suggestive of thrombus formation.<ref name='Fatkin1994'>{{cite journal|title=Relations between left atrial appendage blood flow velocity, spontaneous echocardiographic contrast and thromboembolic risk in vivo|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|year=1994|author= Fatkin D, Kelly RP, and Feneley MP|volume=23|issue=4|pages=961–9|pmid=8106703 |url=http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/abstract/23/4/961|format=|accessdate=2009-10-21|doi=10.1016/0735-1097(94)90644-0 }}</ref>

If no thrombus is seen on TEE, the incidence of stroke, (immediately after cardioversion is performed), is very low.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

====Ambulatory Holter monitoring====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
A [[Holter monitor]] is a wearable ambulatory heart monitor that continuously monitors the heart rate and heart rhythm for a short duration, typically 24 hours.  In individuals with symptoms of significant shortness of breath with exertion or palpitations on a regular basis, a holter monitor may be of benefit to determine if rapid heart rates (or unusually slow heart rates) during atrial fibrillation are the cause of the symptoms.

====Exercise stress testing====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
Some individuals with atrial fibrillation do well with normal activity but develop shortness of breath with exertion.  It may be unclear if the shortness of breath is due to a blunted heart rate response to exertion caused by excessive AV node blocking agents, a very rapid heart rate during exertion, or due to other underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease or coronary ischemia.  An [[cardiac stress test|exercise stress test]] will evaluate the individual's heart rate response to exertion and determine if the AV node blocking agents are contributing to the symptoms.

==Causes==
AF is linked to several cardiac causes, but may occur in otherwise normal hearts. Known associations include:
* [[Hypertension]] (High blood pressure)
* Primary heart diseases including [[coronary artery disease]], [[mitral stenosis]] (e.g., due to [[rheumatic heart disease]] or [[mitral valve prolapse]]), [[mitral regurgitation]], [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] (HCM), [[pericarditis]], [[congenital heart disease]], previous [[heart surgery]]
* Lung diseases (such as [[pneumonia]], [[lung cancer]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[sarcoidosis]])
* Excessive [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] consumption ("[[binge drinking]]" or "[[holiday heart syndrome]]"). Even otherwise healthy middle-aged women who consumed more than 2 drinks daily were 60% more likely to develop AF.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Conen D, Tedrow UB, Cook NR, Moorthy MV, Buring JE, Albert CM |title=Alcohol Consumption and Risk of Incident Atrial Fibrillation in Women |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=21 |pages=2489–96 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=19050192 |doi=10.1001/jama.2008.755 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/300/21/2489 |pmc=2630715}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

===Morphology===
The primary pathologic change seen in atrial fibrillation is the progressive fibrosis of the atria.  This fibrosis is primarily due to atrial dilation, however genetic causes and inflammation may have a cause in some individuals.  One study found that atrial dilation can occur as a consequence of AF,<ref name='Sanfilippo1990'>{{cite journal|title=Atrial enlargement as a consequence of atrial fibrillation  A prospective echocardiographic study|journal=Circulation|year=1990 |volume=82|issue=3|pages=792–7|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/82/3/792|format=|accessdate=2009-12-02|author= Sanfilippo AJ, Abascal VM, Sheehan M, Oertel LB, Harrigan P, Hughes RA and Weyman AE|pmid=2144217|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.82.3.792 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091201131903/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/82/3/792| archivedate= 1 December 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  although another study found that AF by itself does not cause it.<ref name='Osranek2005'>{{cite journal|title=Left atrial volume predicts cardiovascular events in patients originally diagnosed with lone atrial fibrillation: three-decade follow-up|journal=European Heart Journal|date=2005 Dec|volume=26|issue=23|pages=2556–61|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehi483|url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/ehi483|format=|accessdate=2009-12-27|author=Osranek M, Bursi F, Bailey KR, Grossardt BR, Brown RD Jr, Kopecky SL, Tsang TS, Seward JB.|pmid=16141257 }}</ref>

Dilation of the atria can be due to almost any structural abnormality of the heart that can cause a rise in the intra-cardiac pressures.  This includes valvular heart disease (such as mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation), hypertension, and congestive heart failure.  Any inflammatory state that affects the heart can cause fibrosis of the atria.  This is typically due to sarcoidosis but may also be due to autoimmune disorders that create autoantibodies against myosin heavy chains.  Mutation of the ''[[lamin]] AC'' gene is also associated with fibrosis of the atria that can lead to atrial fibrillation.

Once dilation of the atria has occurred, this begins a chain of events that leads to the activation of the [[renin-angiotensin system|renin aldosterone angiotensin system]] (RAAS) and subsequent increase in matrix metaloproteinases and disintegrin, which leads to atrial remodeling and fibrosis, with loss of atrial muscle mass. This process is not immediate, and experimental studies have revealed patchy atrial fibrosis may precede the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and may progress with prolonged durations of atrial fibrillation.

Fibrosis is not limited to the muscle mass of the atria, and may occur in the [[sinus node]] (SA node) and [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node), correlating with [[sick sinus syndrome]].  Prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation have been shown to correlate with prolongation of the sinus node recovery time,<ref name="pmid16908781"/><ref name="pmid8941126">{{cite journal |author=Elvan A, Wylie K, Zipes D |title=Pacing-induced chronic atrial fibrillation impairs sinus node function in dogs.

The normal [[electrical conduction system of the heart]] allows the impulse that is generated by the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node) of the heart to be propagated to and stimulate the [[myocardium]] (muscle of the heart). When the myocardium is stimulated, it contracts. It is the ordered stimulation of the myocardium that allows efficient contraction of the heart, thereby allowing blood to be pumped to the body.

There are multiple theories about the etiology of atrial fibrillation. An important theory is that in  atrial fibrillation, the regular impulses produced by the sinus node for a normal heartbeat, are overwhelmed by rapid electrical discharges produced in the atria and adjacent parts of the [[pulmonary veins]]. Sources of these disturbances are  either automatic foci, often localized at one of the pulmonary veins, or a small number of localized sources in the form of either reentrant electrical spiral waves (rotors) or repetitive focal beats; these localized sources may be found in the left atrium near the pulmonary veins or in a variety of other locations through both the left or right atrium. 

Because recovery of the atria from excitation is heterogeneous, the electrical waves generated by the AF sources undergo repetitive, spatially distributed breakup and fragmentation in a process known as "fibrillatory conduction".
Another theory is the multiple [[wavelet]] theory first formulated by Moe,<ref name =AHA2001>{{cite journal |author=Fuster V |title=ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: Executive Summary A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology Committee for Practice Guidelines and Policy Conferences (Committee to Develop Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) Developed in Collaboration With the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology |journal=Circulation |volume=104 |issue=17 |pages=2118–50 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11673357 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/104/17/2118 |author-separator=, |author2=Rydén LE |author3=Asinger RW |display-authors=3 |last4=Cannom |first4=DS |last5=Crijns |first5=HJ |last6=Frye |first6=RL |last7=Halperin |first7=JL |last8=Kay |first8=GN |last9=Klein |first9=WW}}</ref> which was experimentally proven by Allessie et al.

AF can be distinguished from [[atrial flutter]] (AFL), which appears as an organized electrical circuit usually in the right atrium. AFL produces characteristic saw-toothed F-waves of constant amplitude and frequency on an [[electrocardiogram|ECG]] whereas AF does not. In AFL, the discharges circulate rapidly at a rate of 300&nbsp;beats per minute (bpm) around the atrium. In AF, there is no regularity of this kind, except at the sources where the local activation rate can exceed 500 bpm.

Although the electrical impulses of AF occur at a high rate, most of them do not result in a heart beat. A heart beat results when an electrical impulse from the atria passes through the [[Atrioventricular node|atrioventricular (AV) node]] to the ventricles and causes them to contract. During AF, if all of the impulses from the atria passed through the AV node, there would be severe [[ventricular tachycardia]] resulting in severe reduction of [[cardiac output]]. This dangerous situation is prevented by the AV node since its limited conduction velocity reduces the rate at which impulses reach the ventricles during AF.<ref name='Klabunde2005'>{{cite book | last = Klabunde | first = Richard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year = 2005 | location = | pages = 25, 28 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7817-5030-1 }}</ref>

==Management==
{{Main|Management of atrial fibrillation}}
The main goals of treatment are to prevent [[Shock (circulatory)|circulatory instability]] and [[stroke]]. Rate or rhythm control are used to achieve the former, while [[anticoagulation]] is used to decrease the risk of the latter.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Prystowsky EN | title=Management of atrial fibrillation: therapeutic options and clinical decisions | journal=Am J Cardiol | year=2000 | pages=3D–11D | volume=85 | issue=10A  | doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(00)00908-5 | pmid = 10822035 }}</ref> If cardiovascularly unstable due to uncontrolled [[tachycardia]], immediate cardioversion is indicated.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

===Anticoagulation===
[[Anticoagulation]] can be achieved through a number of means including the use of [[heparin]], [[warfarin]], [[dabigatran]]  and [[rivaroxaban]] .  Which method is used depends on a number issues including: cost, risk of stroke, risk of falls, compliance, and speed of desired onset of anticoagulation.<ref name='Singer2004'>{{cite journal | title = Antithrombotic Therapy in Atrial Fibrillation : The Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy | journal = Chest | date = Sep 2004 | volume = 126 | issue = 3_suppl | pages = 429S–456S | url = http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1082822 | accessdate = 2012-10-02 | pmid = 15383480 | author = Singer DE, Albers GW, Dalen JE, Go AS, Halperin JL, Manning WJ | doi = 10.1378/chest.126.3_suppl.429S}}</ref> Some other anticoagulants  were discussed in a 2012 state-of-the-art paper but were not generally approved at that time for stroke prevention in AF: [[apixaban]], and [[edoxaban]].<ref name='DeCaterina2012'>{{cite journal | title = New oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes: ESC Working Group on Thrombosis-Task Force on Anticoagulants in Heart Disease position paper | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | date = 17 Apr 2012 | volume = 59 | issue = 16 | pages = 1413–25 | url = http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1203105 | accessdate = 2012-10-02 | pmid = 22497820 | author = De Caterina R, Husted S, Wallentin L, Andreotti F, et. al. | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2012.02.008}}</ref>

===Rate control versus rhythm control using drugs===
AF can cause disabling and bothersome symptoms. [[Palpitations]], chest discomfort, anxiety, and decreased exercise tolerance are related to rapid heart rate and inefficient cardiac output caused by AF. Furthermore, AF with a persistent rapid rate can cause a form of [[heart failure]] called [[tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy]]. This can significantly increase mortality and morbidity, which can be prevented by early and adequate treatment of the AF.

There are two ways to approach these symptoms using drugs: rate control and rhythm control. ''Rate control'' lowers the heart rate closer to normal, usually 60 to 100&nbsp;bpm, without trying to convert to a regular rhythm. ''Rhythm control'' restores normal heart rhythm in a process called cardioversion and maintains the normal rhythm with drugs. Studies suggest that rhythm control is most important in the acute setting AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase.  As far as [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] is concerned, the AFFIRM trial showed that there is lower mortality using rate control with anticoagulation treatment versus rhythm control treatment and the difference increases up to 5 years (end of study).<ref name=pmid12466506>{{cite journal | author=Wyse DG, Waldo AL, DiMarco JP, Domanski MJ, Rosenberg Y, Schron EB, Kellen JC, Greene HL, Mickel MC, Dalquist JE, Corley SD | title=A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2002 | pages=1825–33 | volume=347 | issue=23 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa021328  | pmid = 12466506 }}</ref>

There is no difference in risk of stroke in patients who have converted to a normal rhythm with anti-arrhythmic treatment compared to those who have only rate control.<ref name=pmid12466506/> AF is associated with a reduced quality of life, and while some studies indicate that rhythm control leads to a higher quality of life, some did not find a difference.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thrall G, Lane D, Carroll D, Lip GY |title=Quality of life in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review |journal=Am.

A further study focused on rhythm control in patients with AF with concomitant heart failure, based on the hypothesis that AF confers a higher mortality risk in heart failure. In this setting, rhythm control offered no advantage compared to rate control.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Roy D | title=Rhythm control versus rate control for atrial fibrillation and heart failure | journal=N Engl J Med | year=2008 | month=June | volume=358 | number=25 | pages=2667–2677 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0708789 | pmid=18565859 | issue=25 | author-separator=, | author2=Talajic M | author3=Nattel S | display-authors=3 | last4=Wyse | first4=D.

Malcolm O. | last9=Buxton | first9=Alfred E.}}</ref> However, the diagnosis and progression of atrial fibrillation and other cardiovascular disease requires further investigation.

In patients with a fast ventricular response, intravenous [[magnesium]] significantly increases the chances of successful rate and rhythm control in the urgent setting without major side-effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Onalan O, Crystal E, Daoulah A, Lau C, Crystal A, Lashevsky I |title=Meta-analysis of magnesium therapy for the acute management of rapid atrial fibrillation |journal=Am.

This is based on a number of criteria that includes whether or not symptoms persist with rate control.

===Rate control===
Rate control is achieved with medications that work by increasing the degree of block at the level of the AV node, effectively decreasing the number of impulses that conduct into the ventricles. This can be done with:<ref name="pmid16908781"/><ref name= NICE2006>{{Cite book| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=Atrial fibrillation: national clinical guideline for management in primary and secondary care| title=National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions| editor-first=| editor-last=| coeditors=| publisher=Royal College of Physicians| place=London| date=| year=2006| id= | contribution-url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg036fullguideline.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2009-05-05 }}</ref>

* Non-dihydropyridine [[calcium channel blocker]]s (e.g., [[diltiazem]] or [[verapamil]])
* [[Cardiac glycosides]] (e.g., [[digoxin]]) – have limited use, apart from in the sedentary elderly patient

In addition to these agents, amiodarone has some AV node blocking effects (particularly when administered intravenously), and can be used in individuals when other agents are contraindicated or ineffective (particularly due to hypotension).

Diltiazem has been shown to be more effective than either digoxin or amiodarone.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Siu CW, Lau CP, Lee WL, Lam KF, Tse HF |title=Intravenous diltiazem is superior to intravenous amiodarone or digoxin for achieving ventricular rate control in patients with acute uncomplicated atrial fibrillation |journal=Crit.

===Cardioversion===
[[Cardioversion]] is a noninvasive conversion of an irregular heartbeat to a normal heartbeat using electrical or chemical means.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>
* ''Electrical cardioversion'' involves the restoration of normal heart rhythm through the application of a DC electrical shock.
* ''Chemical cardioversion'' is performed with drugs, such as [[amiodarone]], [[dronedarone]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Singh BN |title=Dronedarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation or flutter |journal=N.

After successful cardioversion the heart may be in a stunned state, which means that there is a normal rhythm but restoration of normal atrial contraction has not yet occurred.<ref name='Watson2009'>{{cite journal | title = Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation: Virchow's triad revisited | journal = Lancet | date = 10 Jan 2009 | volume = 373 | issue = 9658 | pages = 155–66 | pmid = 19135613 | author = Watson T, Shantsila E, Lip GY | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60040-4}}</ref>

=== Ablation===
In young patients where rhythm control is desired and cannot be maintained by medication or cardioversion then [[ablation of atrial fibrillation|radiofrequency ablation]] may be attempted and is preferred over years of drug therapy.<ref name="pmid16908781"/>

===Maze Procedure===
The [[Maze procedure]], first performed in 1987, is an effective invasive surgical treatment that is designed to create electrical blocks or barriers in the atria of the heart, forcing electrical impulses that stimulate the heartbeat to travel down to the ventricles. The idea is to force abnormal electrical signals to move along one, uniform path to the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles), thus restoring the normal heart rhythm.<ref>Northwestern Surgery for Atrial Fibrillation. [http://www.nmh.org/nm/atrial-fibrillation-surgery Atrial Fibrillation Surgery]</ref>

===Following surgery===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
AF often occurs after cardiac surgery and is usually self-limiting. It is strongly associated with age, pre-operative hypertension, and the number of vessels grafted. Measures should be taken to control hypertension pre-operatively to reduce the risk of AF. Also, patients with a higher risk of AF, e.g., patients with pre-operative hypertension, more than 3 vessels grafted, or greater than 70 years of age, should be considered for prophylactic treatment. Postoperative pericardial effusion is also suspected to be the cause of atrial fibrillation. Prophylaxis may include prophylactic post-operative rate and rhythm management. Some authors perform posterior pericardiotomy to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF.<ref name="pmid22235005">{{cite journal |author=Kaleda VI, McCormack DJ, Shipolini AR |title=Does posterior pericardiotomy reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery? |journal=Interact.

However, cardioversion may be employed if the patient is haemodynamically unstable, highly symptomatic, or persists for 6 weeks after discharge. In persistent cases anticoagulation should be used.

==Prognosis==

===Thromboembolism===
{{See also| CHADS score }}
In atrial fibrillation, the lack of an organized atrial contraction can result in some stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA) or [[left atrial appendage]] (LAA). This lack of movement of blood can lead to [[thrombus]] formation ([[coagulation|blood clotting]]). If the clot becomes mobile and is carried away by the blood circulation,  it is called an [[embolus]].   An  embolus proceeds through smaller and smaller [[artery|arteries]] until it plugs one of them and prevents blood from flowing through the artery. This process results in end-organ damage due to loss of nutrients, oxygen, and removal of cellular waste products. Thrombus can form anywhere in the body, while emboli follow the blood circulation to specific points in the body. Emboli in the brain may result in an [[ischemic stroke]] or a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA).

More than 90% of cases of thrombi associated with non-valvular atrial fibrillation evolve in the left atrial appendage.<ref name="pmid8572814">{{cite journal |author=Blackshear JL, Odell JA |title=Appendage obliteration to reduce stroke in cardiac surgical patients with atrial fibrillation |journal=Ann.

If the LA is enlarged, there is an increased risk of thrombi that originate in the LA. Moderate to severe, non-[[Rheumatic fever|rheumatic]], [[mitral regurgitation]] (MR) reduces this risk of stroke.<ref name='Nakagami1998'>{{cite journal|title=Mitral regurgitation reduces the risk of stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation|journal=Americal Heart Journal|year=1998|volume=136|issue=3|pages=528–32|pmid=9736148 |url=http://www.ahjonline.com/article/S0002-8703(98)70231-5/abstract|format=|accessdate=2010-02-23|author=Nakagami H, Yamamoto K, Ikeda U, Mitsuhashi T, Goto T, Shimada K|doi=10.1016/S0002-8703(98)70231-5 }}</ref> This risk reduction may be due to a beneficial stirring effect of the MR blood flow into the LA.<ref name='Cheng1999'>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0002-8703(99)70045-1 | title = Reduced risk for thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation | journal = American Heart Journal | date = 1999-11 | first = TO | last = Cheng | volume = 138 | issue = 5 Pt 1 | pages = 998–9| pmid = 10539836}}</ref>

===Mitral valve===
Atrial fibrillation and a corresponding enlargement of the left atrium may cause an increase in the perimeter of the [[mitral valve]]. The somewhat circular perimeter of the mitral valve is  defined by the [[Mitral valve#Anatomy|mitral annulus]].<ref name='Pai2003'>{{cite journal|title=Effect of Atrial Fibrillation on the Dynamics of Mitral Annular Area|journal=The Journal of Heart Valve Disease|date=2003-01|first1=RG |last1=Pai |first2=P |last2=Varadarajan |first3=M |last3=Tanimoto|volume=12|issue=1|pages=31–7|url=http://www.icr-heart.com/journal/content/2003/jan/abstracts/article.php?id=135|format=|accessdate=2009-12-20|pmid=12578332 }}</ref>

With a [[normal sinus rhythm]], the mitral annulus undergoes dynamic changes during the [[cardiac cycle]]. For example, at the end of [[diastole]]  the annular area is smaller than at the end of [[Systole (medicine)|systole]]. A possible reason for this dynamic size difference is that the coordinated contraction of the [[left atrium]] acts like a [[sphincter]] about the mitral annulus and  reduces its size. This may be important for mitral valve competence so that it does not leak when the left ventricle pumps blood. However, when the left atrium fibrillates, this sphincter action is not possible and may contribute to, or result in, mitral regurgitation in some cases.<ref name='Pai2003' />

*non-familial AF associated with genetic backgrounds (polymorphism in the ACE gene) that may predispose to atrial fibrillation

==History==
Because the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation requires measurement of the electrical activity of the heart, atrial fibrillation was not truly described until 1874, when [[Edmé Félix Alfred Vulpian]] observed the irregular atrial electrical behavior that he termed ''"fremissement fibrillaire"'' in dog hearts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vulpian | first1 = A. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1874 | title = Note sur les effets de la faradisation directe des ventricules du coeur chez le chien | url = | journal = Archives de Physiologie Normale et Pathologique | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 975 }}</ref> In the mid-eighteenth century, [[Jean-Baptiste de Sénac]] made note of dilated, irritated atria in people with [[mitral stenosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McMichael | first1 = J. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1982 | title = History of atrial fibrillation 1628–1819 Harvey – de Senac – Laënnec | url = | journal = Br Heart J | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 193–7 | pmid = 7049202 | doi = 10.1136/hrt.48.3.193 | pmc = 481228 }}</ref> The irregular pulse associated with AF was first recorded in 1876 by [[Carl Nothnagel|Carl Wilhelm Hermann Nothnagel]] and termed ''"delirium cordis"'', stating that "[I]n this form of arrhythmia the heartbeats follow each other in complete irregularity. At the same time, the height and tension of the individual pulse waves are continuously changing".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nothnagel | first1 = H. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1876 | title = Ueber arythmische Herzthatigkeit | url = | journal = Deutsches Archiv fur Klinische Medizin | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 190–220 }}</ref> Correlation of delirium cordis with the loss of atrial contraction as reflected in the loss of ''a waves'' in the [[Jugular venous pressure|jugular venous pulse]] was made by Sir James MacKenzie in 1904.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = MacKenzie | first1 = J. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1904 | title = Observations on the Inception of the Rhythm of the Heart by the Ventricle: As the cause of Continuous Irregularity of the Heart | url = | journal = Br Med J | volume = 1 | issue = 2253| pages = 529–36 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.2253.529 | pmid = 20761393 | pmc = 2353402 }}</ref> [[Willem Einthoven]] published the first ECG showing AF in 1906.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einthoven | first1 = W. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1906 | title = Le telecardiogramme | url = | journal = Archives Internationales de Physiologie | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 132–64 }}</ref> The connection between the anatomic and electrical manifestations of AF and the irregular pulse of delirium cordis was made in 1909 by  Carl Julius Rothberger, Heinrich Winterberg, and Sir Thomas Lewis.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rothberger | first1 = CJ | last2 = Winterberg | first2 = H. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1909 | title = Vorhofflimmern und Arhythmia perpetua | url = | journal = Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 839–44 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = T | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1909 | title = Auricular fibrillation: a common clinical condition | url = | journal = Br Med J | volume = 2 | issue = 2552| page = 1528 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.2552.1528 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Flegel KM |title=From delirium cordis to atrial fibrillation: historical development of a disease concept |journal=Ann.
