The '''carotid triangle''' (or '''superior carotid triangle''') is a portion of the [[anterior triangle of the neck]].

==Coverings and boundaries==
It is bounded:
* posteriorly by the [[Sternocleidomastoideus]];
* inferiorly, by the superior belly of the [[Omohyoideus]]
* superiorly, by the [[Stylohyoideus]] and the posterior belly of the [[Digastricus]].

It is covered by the integument, superficial fascia, [[Platysma]] and deep fascia; ramifying in which are branches of the facial and cutaneous cervical nerves.

Its floor is formed by parts of the [[Thyrohyoideus]], [[Hyoglossus]], and the [[Constrictores pharyngis medius]] and inferior.

==Arteries==
This space when dissected is seen to contain the upper part of the [[common carotid artery]], which bifurcates opposite the upper border of the [[thyroid cartilage]] into the external and internal carotid. These vessels are somewhat concealed from view by the anterior margin of the Sternocleidomastoideus, which overlaps them.

The external and internal carotids lie side by side, the external being the more anterior of the two.

The following branches of the external carotid are also met with in this space:
* the [[superior thyroid artery]], running forward and downward;
* the [[lingual artery]], directly forward;
* the [[facial artery]], forward and upward;
* the [[occipital artery]], backward and upward;
* the [[ascending pharyngeal artery]], directly upward on the medial side of the internal carotid.

==Veins==
The veins met with are:
* the [[internal jugular]], which lies on the lateral side of the common and internal carotid arteries;
* and veins corresponding to the above-mentioned branches of the external carotidâ€”viz.,
** the [[superior thyroid vein]],
** the [[lingual veins]],
** [[common facial]],
** [[ascending pharyngeal]],
** and sometimes the [[occipital vein]]

...all of which end in the internal jugular.

==Nerves==
Superficial to the [[carotid sheath]] lies the [[hypoglossal nerve]] and [[ansa cervicalis]] of the [[cervical plexus]].

The [[hypoglossal nerve]] crosses both the internal and external carotids, curving around the origin of the [[occipital artery]].

Within the sheath, between the artery and vein, and behind both, is the [[vagus nerve]]; behind the sheath, the [[sympathetic trunk]].

On the lateral side of the vessels, the [[accessory nerve]] runs for a short distance before it pierces the [[Sternocleidomastoideus]]; and on the medial side of the [[external carotid]], just below the [[hyoid bone]], the internal branch of the [[superior laryngeal nerve]] may be seen; and, still more inferiorly, the external branch of the same nerve.

==Other contents==
The upper portion of the larynx and lower portion of the pharynx are also found in the front part of this space.
