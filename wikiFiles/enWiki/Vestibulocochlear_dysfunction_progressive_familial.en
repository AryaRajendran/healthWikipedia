'''Vestibulocochlear dysfunction progressive familial''', known also as '''familial progressive vestibulocochlear dysfunction''' is an autosomal dominant disease that results in [[sensorineural hearing loss]] and vestibular areflexia.  Patients report feelings of vague dissiness, blurred vision, dysequilibrium in the dark, and progressive hearing impairment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verhagen|first=Wim|coauthors=Steven J.H.

* [[Sensorineural hearing loss]]
* Vestibular areflexia
* [[Hearing impairment]]
* [[Vertigo]]
* [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]]
* Head movement-dependent [[oscillopsia]]

== Cause ==
The disease is an inherited [[autosomal dominant]] disease, but the physiological cause of the dysfunction is still unclear. An [[Acidophile (organisms)|acidophyllic]] [[mucopolysaccharide]]-containing substance was discovered, especially in [[cochlea]]s, [[Otolithic organs|maculas]], and [[crista ampullaris]] of patients with DFNA9 (a [[Locus (genetics)|chromosome locus]]), as well as severe degeneration of vestibular and cochlear sensory axons and dendrites. It is suggested that the mucopolysaccharide deposit could cause strangulation of nerve endings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verhagen|first=Wim|coauthors=Steven J.H. Bom, Patrick L.M.

The [[Otolithic organs|maculas]] and [[crista ampullaris]] are what allow for non-visual sensation of head movements.  The crista ampullaris resides in the [[semicircular canals]] of the inner ear and detects angular acceleration, while the maculas are housed within the [[Vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] of the inner ear and detect linear acceleration.  When affected, these organs can lead to vertigo and nausea because the body would always feel off-balance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth|title=Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-337825-1|pages=596–609}}</ref>
