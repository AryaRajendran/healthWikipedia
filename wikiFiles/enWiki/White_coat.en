A '''white coat''' or '''laboratory coat''' (often abbreviated to '''lab coat''') is a knee-length overcoat/[[smock]] worn by professionals in the [[medicine|medical]] field or by those involved in [[laboratory]] work. The coat protects their street clothes and also serves as a simple uniform. The garment is made from white or light-colored [[cotton]], [[linen]], or cotton [[polyester]] blend, allowing it to be washed at high temperature and make it easy to see if it is clean. Similar coats are a symbol of learning in [[Argentina]], where they are worn by students. In [[Tunisia]] and [[mozambique]], teachers wear white coats to protect their street clothes from chalk.

When used in the laboratory, they protect against accidental spills, e.g. acids. In this case they usually have long sleeves and are made of an absorbent material, such as cotton, so that the user can be protected from the chemical. Some lab coats have buttons at the end of the sleeves, to secure them around the wrist so that they do not hang into beakers of chemicals. Short-sleeved lab coats also exist where protection from substances such as acid is not necessary, and are favoured by certain scientists, such as microbiologists, avoiding the problem of hanging sleeves altogether, combined with the ease of washing the forearms (an important consideration in microbiology).

Like the word "[[suit (clothing)|suit]]", the phrase "white coat" is sometimes used to denote the wearer, ''ex.' the scientific personnel in a [[biotechnology]] or [[chemistry|chemical]] company.

== In medicine ==
White coats are sometimes seen as the distinctive dress of [[physician]]s, who have worn them for over 100 years.  In the nineteenth century, respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the [[quackery]] and [[Medieval medicine|mysticism]] of nineteenth century medicine.  To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientists, and began to wear the most recognizable symbol of the scientist, the white laboratory coat.<ref>Jones VA, "The White Coat: Why not Follow Suit?" JAMA. 1999;281:478. [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/281/5/478 Full Text].</ref>

Recently, [[white coat ceremony|white coat ceremonies]] have become popular amongst those starting [[medical school]].

The modern white coat was introduced to medicine in the late 1800s as a symbol of cleanliness<ref>{{cite news|author=Andre Picard |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/why-do-physicians-wear-white-lab-coats/article4384866/ |title=Why do physicians wear white lab coats? |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2012-07-02 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref>

A recent study conducted in the United Kingdom found that the majority of patients prefer their doctors to wear white coats, but the majority of doctors prefer other clothing, such as [[scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]].<ref name="bbc">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3706783.stm | title=Doctors 'should wear white coats' | publisher=BBC News | date=2004-05-13 | accessdate=2006-07-18}}</ref> The study found that psychiatrists were among the least likely to wear white coats. Some medical doctors view the coats as hot and uncomfortable, and many feel that they spread infection.<ref name="bbc"/>

Some doctors in institutions such as the [[Mayo Clinic]] are instructed to wear business attire, to convey professionalism, as the clinic dislikes the message that white coats represent to the patient.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berry |first=Leonard L. |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/pubitem.jhtml?id=3380&t=marketing |title=Clueing in Customers - Why Docs Don't Wear White Coats or Polo Shirts at the Mayo Clinic - HBS Working Knowledge |publisher=Hbswk.hbs.edu |date=2003-03-17 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref>

=== White coat hypertension ===
Some patients who have their blood pressure measured in a clinical setting have higher readings than they do when measured in a home setting. This is apparently a result of patients feeling more relaxed when they are at home. The phenomenon is sometimes called "[[white coat hypertension]]," in reference to the traditional white coats worn in a clinical setting, though the coats themselves may have nothing to do with the elevated readings.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Pierdomenico S, Mezzetti A, Lapenna D, Guglielmi M, Mancini M, Salvatore L, Antidormi T, Costantini F, Cuccurullo F | title='White-coat' hypertension in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension: evaluation of prevalence by ambulatory monitoring and impact on cost of health care. | journal=Eur Heart J | volume=16 | issue=5 | pages=692â€“7 | year=1995 | pmid=7588903}}</ref>

=== In psychiatry ===
The term is also used as verbal shorthand for psychiatric [[orderly|orderlies]] or other personnel and may be used, in a usually jocular manner, to imply someone's [[lunacy]]. In the 1966 song, ''[[They're Coming to Take Me Away Ha-Haaa!]]'', [[Napoleon XIV]] fictionalized the public's view of the symbolic relationship between such institutions and white coats in the following lyrics:

<blockquote>
They're coming to take me away ho ho hee hee ha haaa!<br/>
To the funny farm,<br/>
Where life is beautiful all the time.<br/>
And I'll be happy to see those nice young men<br/>
In their clean white coats,<br/>
And they're coming to take me away ha haaa!
</blockquote>

=== White versus black ===
Until the mid-1920s, students who were examining cadavers would wear black lab coats to show respect for the dead. Black lab coats were used in early biomedical and microbiology laboratories because any dust (i.e., contamination) that settled on them was easily visible{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

=== White coat ceremony ===
{{main|White coat ceremony}}
A [[white coat ceremony]] is a relatively new ritual that marks one's entrance into [[medical school]] and, more recently, into a number of related health-related schools and professions. It originated in [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in 1993<ref name=huber>Huber SJ, "The white coat ceremony: a contemporary medical ritual". J Med Ethics 2003;29:364-366. [http://jme.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/29/6/364 Full Text].</ref> and involves a formal "robing" or "cloaking" in white lab coats.

== Biology ==
In industries and institutions related to biology, white and green coats are used. Typically, white coats are used in laboratory work.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

== Howie coats ==
For added safety, a variant of the lab coat, called a "Howie" style lab coat is often adopted . It is called that after an 1978 report commissioned by the UK department of Health and Social Security to codify standard clinical laboratory practices, chaired by a [[Sir James Howie|JW Howie]]. Among the codified standards was protective clothing - the type of wrap around full-coverage lab coat which had been in use in the UK for over a hundred years was nicknamed the "Howie-Style" coat to indicate its compliance with the provisions of this report. It has the buttons on the left flank, elasticated wrists and a [[mandarin collar]] and is quite similar to a [[chef's uniform]]  and designed to minimize pathogen contact with street clothes.

== Argentina and Spain ==
[[Image:Delantales blancos 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ubiquitous white uniform of Argentine school children is a national symbol of learning.]]
In [[Argentina]] white coats which resemble lab coats are worn by students and teachers of most public primary schools as a daily uniform.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
