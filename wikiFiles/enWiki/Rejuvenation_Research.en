'''''Rejuvenation Research''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] bimonthly [[scientific journal]] published by [[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.|Mary Ann Liebert]] that investigates [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]].

The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Aubrey de Grey]]. The journal addresses such issues as [[circulatory system|cardiovascular]] aging, [[Biological immortality|cell immortalization]] and [[senescence]], [[cloning]]/[[embryonic stem cell]]s, [[DNA repair|DNA damage/repair]], [[growth factor]]s, [[immunology]], [[invertebrate]] [[Maximum life span|lifespan]], [[neurodegeneration]], [[tissue engineering]], [[public policy]], [[gene targeting]], [[gene therapy]], and [[genomics]].

Appreciations of the journal have been rather divergent, with [[editorial board]] member [[Michael R. Rose]] calling it "a heroic effort to jump-start research on postponing or slowing human aging",<ref>Michael Robertson Rose (2005). The long tomorrow: how advances in evolutionary biology can help us postpone aging. Page 148. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-517939-0.</ref> whereas others judge it as being "somewhat fringy"<ref>Joseph Hooper (2005) The prophet of immortality. ''Popular Science'' '''266'''(1): 72.</ref> or "situated admittedly at the fringe of gerontology by taking the controversial stance that aging is ameliorable while demanding to be taken as serious science."<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaging.2008.05.004 |title=Medicalizing the optimal: Anti-aging medicine and the quandary of intervention |year=2008 |last1=Mykytyn |first1=Courtney E. |journal=Journal of Aging Studies |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=313}}</ref>
