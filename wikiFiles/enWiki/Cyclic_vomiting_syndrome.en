'''Cyclic vomiting syndrome''' (US English) or '''cyclical vomiting syndrome''' (UK English) ('''CVS''') is a condition the [[symptoms]] of which are recurring attacks of intense [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] and sometimes [[abdominal pain]], [[headaches]] or [[migraine]]s. Cyclic vomiting typically develops during [[childhood]], usually between ages 3 and 7; although it often remits during [[adolescence]], it can persist into adult life.<ref name="Lindley 2005">{{cite journal |pmid=16131963 |year=2005 |last1=Lindley |first1=Keith J |last2=Andrews |first2=Paul L |title=Pathogenesis and Treatment of Cyclical Vomiting |volume=41 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S38–40 |journal=[[Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition]] |doi=10.1097/01.scs.0000180299.04731.cb}}</ref><ref name=Li2008>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/MPG.0b013e318173ed39 |title=North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Management of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome |year=2008 |last1=Li |first1=B UK |last2=Lefevre |first2=Frank |last3=Chelimsky |first3=Gisela G |last4=Boles |first4=Richard G |last5=Nelson |first5=Susanne P |last6=Lewis |first6=Donald W |last7=Linder |first7=Steven L |last8=Issenman |first8=Robert M |last9=Rudolph |first9=Colin D |journal=Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=379–93 |pmid=18728540}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2982.2008.01113.x |title=Cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults |year=2008 |last1=Abell |first1=T.

==Patient characteristics==
The average age at onset is 3–7 years, but CVS has been seen in infants who are as young as 6 days and in adults who are as old as 73 years.<ref name=LM2003>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0889-8553(03)00045-1 |title=Cyclic vomiting syndrome: A brain–gut disorder |year=2003 |last1=Li |first1=B U.K |last2=Misiewicz |first2=Larry |journal=Gastroenterology Clinics of North America |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=997–1019 |pmid=14562585}}</ref> Typical delay in diagnosis from onset of symptoms is 2.7 – 3 years.<ref name=LM2003 /> Females show a slight predominance over males; the female-to-male ratio is 57:43.<ref name="LM2003" /> CVS occurs in all races but seems to disproportionately affect Caucasians.

==Genetics==
Many affected individuals have a family history of related conditions, such as migraines, in their mothers and maternal relatives, suggesting mitochondrial inheritance. Single [[base-pair]] and DNA rearrangements in the [[mitochondrial]] DNA have been associated with these traits. <ref>{{cite web| title=What is cyclic vomiting syndrome? | url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome}}</ref> It has been suggested that Charles Darwin's adult illnesses may have been due to this syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b4968 |title=Darwin's illness revisited |year=2009 |last1=Hayman |first1=J. A |journal=BMJ |volume=339 |pages=b4968 |pmid=20008377}}</ref>

==Background==
Sufferers may vomit or retch six to twelve times an hour, and an episode may last from a few hours to well over three weeks, and in some cases months, with a median episode duration of 41 hours.<ref name=Li1999>{{cite journal |pmid=10490033 |year=1999 |last1=Li |first1=BU |last2=Fleisher |first2=DR |title=Cyclic vomiting syndrome: Features to be explained by a pathophysiologic model |volume=44 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=13S–18S |journal=Digestive diseases and sciences}}</ref>  Acid, bile and (if the vomiting is severe) blood may be vomited.  Some sufferers will ingest water to reduce the irritation of bile and acid on the esophagus during emesis. Between episodes the sufferer is usually normal and healthy otherwise but can be in a weak state of fatigue or suffer from muscle pain. In approximately half of cases the attacks, or episodes, occur in a time-related manner. Each attack is stereotypical: that is, in any given individual, the timing, frequency and severity of attacks is similar.

Episodes may happen every few days, every few weeks or every few months. For some there is not a pattern in time that can be recognized. Some sufferers have a warning of an attack: They may experience a [[prodrome]], usually intense nausea and [[pallor]], heightened sensitivity, especially to light, though sensitivity to smell, sound, pressure, and temperature, as well as oncoming muscle pain and fatigue, are also reported by some patients. The majority of sufferers can identify triggers that may precipitate an attack.   The most common are various foods, [[infection]]s (such as [[colds]]), menstruation, extreme physical exertion, lack of sleep, and psychological [[stress (biological)|stress]]es both positive and negative.

A sufferer may also be light sensitive ([[photophobia|photophobic]]) during an attack, as well as sound sensitive ([[phonophobia|phonophobic]]) and, less frequently, temperature or pressure sensitive.<ref name="Lindley 2005" />   Some sufferers also have a strong urge to bathe in warm or cold water. Some sufferers report that they experience a restless sensation or stinging pain along the spine, hands, and feet followed by weakness in both legs.  Some of these symptoms may be due to dehydration rather than the underlying cause of CVS.

==Diagnostic criteria and investigations==
The cause of CVS has not been determined; there are no diagnostic tests for CVS. Several other medical conditions can mimic the same symptoms, and it is important to rule these out. If all other possible causes have been excluded, a diagnosis of CVS may be appropriate.

There are established criteria to aid in diagnosis of CVS; essential criteria are:

#A history of three or more periods of intense, acute nausea and unremitting vomiting, as well as pain in some cases, lasting hours to days and even weeks or months
#Intervening symptom-free intervals, lasting weeks to months
#Exclusion of metabolic, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system structural or biochemical disease, e.g., individuals with specific physical causes (such as intestinal malrotation)

Once formal investigations to rule out gastrointestinal or other etiologies have been conducted, these tests do not need to be repeated in the event of future episodes.<ref name="Lindley 2005" />

The prevalence of the condition is not clear. Two published studies on childhood CVS suggest nearly 2% of school-age children may have CVS. However, diagnosis is problematic and, as knowledge of CVS has increased in recent years, more and more cases are emerging. This suggests a tendency toward under-diagnosis, and thus the true figure may be higher.

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for CVS, but there are medications that can be used for treatment, intervention, and prevention.  There is a growing body of publications on both individual cases and the experiences of the CVS cohort. Treatment is usually on an individual basis, based on trial and error.

The most common therapeutic strategies for those already in an attack are maintenance of salt balance by appropriate intravenous fluids and, in some cases, sedation. Having vomited for a long period prior to attending a hospital, patients are typically severely dehydrated. For a number of patients, potent anti-emetic drugs such as [[ondansetron]] (Zofran) or [[granisetron]] (Kytril), and [[dronabinol]] (Marinol) may be helpful in either preventing an attack, aborting an attack, or reducing the severity of an attack. Lifestyle changes may be recommended, such as extended rest and reduction of stress. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Because the symptoms of CVS are similar (or perhaps identical) to those of the disease well-identified as "[[ICHD_classification_and_diagnosis_of_migraine#Abdominal_migraine|abdominal migraine]]," treatment of CVS with a regimen of anti-migraine drugs, such as Topirimate and amitryptiline, is showing promise in preventing recurrent attacks.

== Course and outcome ==
Fitzpatrick et al. (2007) identified 41 children with cyclic vomiting. The mean age of the sample was 6 years at the onset of the syndrome, 8 years at first diagnosis, and 13 years at follow-up. As many as 39% of the children had resolution of symptoms immediately or within weeks of the diagnosis. Vomiting had resolved at the time of follow-up in 61% of the sample. Many children, including those in the remitted group, continued to have somatic symptoms such as headaches (in 42%) and abdominal pain (in 37%).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Most children who have this disorder miss on average 24 school days a year.<ref name="Li2008" />  The frequency of episodes is higher for some people during times of excitement.<ref name="Li2008"/>  Charitable organizations to support sufferers and their families and to promote knowledge of CVS exist in several countries.

==Mortality==
There is little hard evidence of death as a result of the condition. However, in severe cases the fluid loss can lead to potentially life-threatening salt imbalances, and extremely high blood pressure often develops during an attack. The patient can also become undernourished or underfed if the attacks last too long. In underdeveloped countries it remains probable that CVS may contribute to mortality. In developed countries with adequate medical interventions, most sufferers can be supported during an attack and will recover from the episode.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
