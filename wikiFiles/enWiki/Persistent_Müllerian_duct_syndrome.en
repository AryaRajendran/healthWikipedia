'''Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome''' ('''PMDS''') refers to the presence of a [[uterus]] and sometimes other [[Müllerian duct]] derivatives in a genetically [[male]] animal.  In humans, PMDS typically is due to an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8872466 |year=1996 |month=September |author=Imbeaud, S; Belville, C; Messika-Zeitoun, L; Rey, R; Di, Clemente, N; Josso, N; Picard, Jy |title=A 27 base-pair deletion of the anti-müllerian type II receptor gene is the most common cause of the persistent müllerian duct syndrome |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=1269–77 |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8872466 |format=Free full text |doi=10.1093/hmg/5.9.1269}}</ref> [[congenital disorder]] and is considered by some to be a form of [[pseudohermaphroditism]] due to the presence of uterine tissue.<ref name="laphysto" />

Typical features include undescended testes ([[cryptorchidism]]) and the presence of a small, underdeveloped uterus in a genetically male infant or adult. This condition is usually caused by deficiency of fetal [[anti-Müllerian hormone]] (AMH) effect due to [[mutation]]s of the [[gene]] for AMH or the [[anti-Müllerian hormone receptor]].

==Background==
AMH (Anti Müllerian Hormone) is produced by the primitive [[Sertoli cell]] as one of the earliest Sertoli cell products and induces regression of the Müllerian ducts. Müllerian ducts are only sensitive to AMH action around the 8th week of amenorrhea and Müllerian regression is completed by the end of the 9th week. The AMH induced regression of the Müllerian duct occurs in cranio-caudal direction via apoptosis. The AMH receptors are located on the Müllerian duct mesenchyme and transfer the apoptotic signal to the Müllerian epithelial cell presumably via paracrine actors. The Wolffian ducts differentiate into epididymides, vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles under the influence of testosterone, produced by the fetal Leydig cell<ref>{{cite journal| last = Rey| first = Rodolfo | date = 2005-02-01 | title = Anti-Müllerian hormone in disorders of sex determination and differentiation | journal = Arq. Bras. Endocrinol. Metabol. | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–36 | pmid = 16544032}}</ref>

==Presentation==
Because both the [[Wolffian duct]]s and [[Müllerian duct]]s begin to develop, the tissues are often intertwined, resulting in obstruction or nonpatency of the [[vas deferens]] or other parts of the male excretory ducts. This can result in [[infertility]], the most serious potential problem caused by this condition.

Cryptorchidism in AMH deficiency suggests that AMH may play a role in transabdominal [[testicular descent]], perhaps by facilitating contraction of the [[gubernaculum]].

Other Müllerian derivatives which may be present in at least a rudimentary form are the [[cervix]], upper part of the [[vagina]], and [[fallopian tube]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

The condition can come to attention because of a bulge in the [[inguinal canal]] of a genetically male infant due to [[hernia]]tion of the uterus. The presence of a uterus may be noticed if an [[ultrasound]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of the [[pelvis]] is performed to locate the testes or for other reasons. Occasionally the uterus is discovered during [[abdomen|abdominal]] [[surgery]] for some other purpose in later childhood or adult life.

Although persistent Müllerian duct syndrome is classified as an [[intersex]] condition, it does not involve ambiguity or malformation of the external [[genitalia]], which appear typically male (apart from [[cryptorchidism]] if present).

Apart from humans, this syndrome has been reported in dogs.<ref name="pmid18954385">{{cite journal

==Treatment==
Surgery ([[orchiopexy]]) to retrieve the testes and position them in the [[scrotum]] is the primary treatment. Occasionally they are unsalvageable if located high in the [[retroperitoneum]]. During this surgery, the uterus is usually removed and attempts made to dissect away Müllerian tissue from the [[vas deferens]] and [[epididymis]] for the purpose of improving the chance of fertility. If the person has male gender identity and the testes cannot be retrieved, [[testosterone]] replacement will be necessary at [[puberty]] {{citation needed|date=March 2012}}. Lately, [[laparascope|laparascopic]] [[hysterectomy]] is offered to patients as a solution to both improve the chances of fertility and to prevent the occurrences of [[neoplastic]] tissue formation.<ref name="laphysto">{{cite journal| last = Colacurci| first = N.| coauthors = A.Cardone, P.De Franciscis, E.Landolfi, T.Venditto, A.A.Sinisi | date = 1997-12-02| title = Laparoscopic hysterectomy in a case of male pseudohermaphroditism with persistent Müllerian duct derivatives | journal = European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 272–274 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | issn = 1460-2350 | url = http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/12/2/272.pdf | accessdate = 2009-05-17| doi = 10.1093/humrep/12.2.272 }}</ref>

==Molecular genetics and inheritance==
PMDS type I results from [[mutation]]s of the gene (''AMH'') for AMH on [[chromosome]] 19p3.3.<ref name="titleOMIM - ANTI-MULLERIAN HORMONE; AMH">{{OMIM|600957}}</ref>

PMDS type II results from mutations of the gene (''AMH-RII'') for the AMH receptor on 12q13.<ref name="titleOMIM - ANTI-MULLERIAN HORMONE TYPE II RECEPTOR; AMHR2">{{OMIM|600956}}</ref>

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

Both types of disorders are inherited as [[autosomal recessive]] conditions with expression usually limited to genetic males.
