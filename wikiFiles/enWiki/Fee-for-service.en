'''Fee-for-service''' ('''FFS''') is a payment model where services are unbundled and paid for separately. In health care, it gives an [[incentive]] for physicians to provide more treatments because payment is dependent on the quantity of care, rather than quality of care. Similarly, when patients are shielded from paying ([[cost-sharing]]) by [[health insurance]] coverage, they are incentivized to welcome any medical service that might do some good. FFS is the dominant physician payment method in the United States,<ref name="USapproaches"/> it raises costs, discourages the efficiencies of [[integrated care]], and a variety of reform efforts have been attempted, recommended, or initiated to reduce its influence (such as moving towards [[bundled payment]]s and [[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation]]). In capitation, physicians are discouraged from performing procedures, including necessary ones, because they are not paid anything extra for performing them.  In the [[Japanese health care system]], FFS is mixed with a nationwide price setting mechanism ([[all payer]]) to control costs.<ref name="Sick">{{cite episode |title=Sick around the world |series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |network=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |airdate=April 15, 2008 |minutes=17 |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundtheworld/}}</ref> 

==Health care==
In the health insurance and the health care industries, FFS occurs when doctors and other [[health profession|health care providers]] receive a fee for each service such as an office visit, test, procedure, or other health care service.<ref name="FEHB">[http://www.opm.gov/insure/glossary/index.asp FEHB Glossary.] Retrieved May 31, 2006.</ref> Payments are issued retrospectively, after the services are provided.<ref name="Realignment"/> FFS is inflationary, raising health care costs.<ref name="Realignment">{{Cite journal | author=[[Winnie Chi-Man Yip]], [[William Hsiao]], [[Qingyue Meng]], [[Wen Chen]] & [[Xiaoming Sun]] | title = Realignment of incentives for health-care providers in China | journal=[[The Lancet]] | volume = 375 | issue = 9720 | pages = 1120–1130 | year = 2010 | month = March | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60063-3 | pmid = 20346818}}</ref> It creates a potential financial [[conflict of interest]] with patients, as it [[Incentive|incentivizes]] [[overutilization]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Ronald M.

Private-practice physicians and small group practices are particularly vulnerable to declining reimbursement for patient services by government and third-party payers. Rising regulatory demands, such as the purchase and implementation of costly [[Electronic health record|EHR]] systems, and increasing vigilance by government agencies tasked with identifying and recouping Medicare fraud and abuse, have bloated overhead and cut into revenue.

While most practices have succumbed to the need to see more patients and increase FFS procedures to maintain revenue, rising numbers of physicians are looking to alternate practice models as a better solution. In addition to value-based reimbursement models, such as pay-for-performance programs and accountable care organizations, there is a resurgence of interest in concierge and direct-pay practice models.<ref>[http://www.physicianspractice.com/great-american-physician-survey/content/article/1462168/2100106 "Healthcare Reform Influencing Physicians' Career Choices"] Aubrey Westgate, Physicians Practice, September 2012.</ref> When patients have greater access to their physicians and physicians have more time to spend with patients, utilization of services such as imaging and testing declines.

FFS is a barrier to coordinated care, or [[integrated care]]—exemplified by the [[Mayo Clinic]]—because it rewards individual clinicians for performing separate treatments.<ref>{{cite book |title=Building a Better Delivery System: A New Engineering/Health Care Partnership – Bridging the Quality Chasm |last=Lawrence |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-309-65406-8 |page=99 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22832/pdf/TOC.pdf#page=114}}</ref><ref name="Episodes"/> FFS also does not pay providers to pay attention to the most costly patients,<ref name="Mass"/> ones that could benefit from interventions such as phone calls that can make some hospital stays and 911 calls unnecessary.<ref name="Mass"/><ref>{{cite news |title=The Hot Spotters: Can we lower medical costs by giving the neediest patients better care? |author=[[Atul Gawande]] |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |date=January 24, 2011 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/01/24/110124fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}</ref> In the United States, FFS is familiar to doctors and patients, as it is the main payment method.<ref name="USapproaches"/> Executives regret the changes to managed care, believing it, FFS, turned "industrious, productivity-oriented physicians into complacent, salaried employees."<ref name="CommentOn">{{cite journal| author=Chernew ME| title=Reforming payment for health care services: comment on "physicians' opinions about reforming reimbursement". | journal=[[Arch Intern Med]] | year= 2010 | volume= 170 | issue= 19 | pages= 1742–4 | pmid=20975021 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2010.377 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=20975021}}</ref><ref name="USapproaches">{{Cite journal | author=[[Robert A.

When physicians cannot bill for a service, it serves as a disincentive to perform that service if other billable options exist. [[Electronic referral]], when a specialist evaluates medical data (such as laboratory tests or photos) to diagnose a patient instead of seeing the patient in person, would often improve health care quality and lower costs. However, "in the private fee-for-service context, the loss of specialist income is a powerful barrier to e-referral, a barrier that might be overcome if health plans compensated specialists for the time spent handling e-referrals".<ref>{{Cite journal | author=[[Thomas Bodenheimer]] | title = Coordinating care – a perilous journey through the health care system | journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 358 | issue = 10 | pages = 1064–1071 | year = 2008 | month = March | doi = 10.1056/NEJMhpr0706165 | pmid = 18322289 | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhpr0706165}}</ref>
