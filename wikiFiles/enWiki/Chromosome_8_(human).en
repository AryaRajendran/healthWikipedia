'''Chromosome 8''' is one of the 23 pairs of [[chromosome]]s in [[human]]s. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. Chromosome 8 spans about 145 million [[base pair]]s (the building material of [[DNA]]) and represents between 4.5 and 5.0% of the total DNA in [[cell (biology)|cells]].<ref name=Tabares-Seisdedos/>

The chromosome has two arms, 8p and 8q. The short arm, 8p, has about 45 million base pairs, about 1.5% of the genome, and includes 484 genes and 110 [[pseudogene]]s; about 8% of its genes are involved in [[brain development]] and function, and about 16% are involved in [[cancer]]. A unique feature of 8p is a big region of about 15 megabases that appears to have a high mutation rate, and which shows an immense divergence between human and [[chimpanzee]], suggesting that its high mutation rates have contributed to the evolution of the human brain.<ref name=Tabares-Seisdedos>{{cite journal |author= Tabarés-Seisdedos R, Rubenstein JL |title= Chromosome 8p as a potential hub for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders: implications for schizophrenia, autism and cancer |journal= Mol Psychiatry |volume= 14|issue= 6|pages= 563–89|year=2009 |pmid=19204725 |doi=10.1038/mp.2009.2}}</ref>

Identifying [[gene]]s on each chromosome is an active area of genetic research. Because researchers use different approaches to predict the number of genes on each chromosome, the estimated number of genes varies. Chromosome 8 is likely to contain between 700 and 1,000 genes.

==Genes==
The following are some of the genes located on chromosome 8:
* [[AEG1]] : Astrocyte Elevated Gene (linked to hepatocellular carcinoma and neuroblastoma)
* [[Arc (protein)|Arc/Arg3.1]]
* [[COH1]]
* [[FGFR1]]: [[fibroblast growth factor]] receptor 1 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 2, [[Pfeiffer syndrome]])
* [[GDAP1]]: ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1
* [[Lipoprotein lipase|LPL]]: [[lipoprotein lipase]]
* [[microcephalin|MCPH1]]: [[microcephaly]], primary autosomal recessive 1
* [[NDRG1]]: N-myc downstream regulated gene 1
* [[NEF3]]: neurofilament 3 (150kDa medium)
* [[NEFL]]: neurofilament, light polypeptide 68kDa
* [[SNAI2]]: snail homolog 2 (Drosophila)
* [[Thyroglobulin|TG]]: [[thyroglobulin]]
* [[tissue plasminogen activator|TPA]]: [[tissue plasminogen activator]]
* [[VMAT1]]: [[vesicular monoamine transporter]] protein
* [[WRN (gene)|WRN]]: [[Werner syndrome]]
* [[L-gulonolactone oxidase|GULOP]] pseudogene: responsible for human inability to produce our own Vitamin C
