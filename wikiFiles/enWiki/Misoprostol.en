'''Misoprostol''' is a synthetic [[prostaglandin E1|prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>]] (PGE<sub>1</sub>) [[structural analog|analog]] that is used for the prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ([[NSAID]]) induced [[peptic ulcer|gastric ulcer]]s, to treat [[missed miscarriage]], to [[labour induction|induce labor]], and as an [[abortifacient]]. The latter use is controversial in the [[United States]].  Misoprostol was invented and marketed by [[G.D. Searle & Company]] (now [[Pfizer]]) under the trade name '''Cytotec''', but other [[brand|brand-name]] and [[generic drug|generic]] formulations are now available as well.

==Ulcer prevention==
Misoprostol is approved for use in the prevention of [[NSAID]] induced gastric ulcers.  It acts upon gastric [[parietal cell]]s, inhibiting the secretion of [[gastric acid]] via [[G-protein coupled receptor]] mediated inhibition of [[adenylate cyclase]], which leads to decreased intracellular [[cyclic AMP]] levels and decreased [[proton pump]] activity at the [[apical membrane|apical]] surface of the parietal cell.  Because other classes of drugs, especially [[H2-receptor antagonists]] and [[proton pump inhibitors]], are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, Misoprostol is only indicated for use by people who are both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications.  Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of [[gastric ulcer]]ation (e.g. with [[diclofenac]] in '[[Arthrotec]]').

Misoprostol has other protective actions, but is only clinically effective at doses high enough to reduce gastric acid secretion.  For instance, at lower doses, misoprostol may stimulate increased secretion of the protective [[mucus]] that lines the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and increase mucosal blood flow, thereby increasing mucosal integrity. However, these effects are not pronounced enough to warrant prescription of misoprostol at doses lower than those needed to achieve gastric acid suppression.

However, even in the treatment of NSAID induced ulcers, [[omeprazole]] proved to be at least as effective as misoprostol,<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199803123381105 | pmid = 9494149 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199803123381105 | volume=338 | issue=11 | title=Omeprazole compared with misoprostol for ulcers associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

Med. | pages=727–34}}</ref> but significantly better tolerated, and therefore misoprostol should not be considered a first choice treatment. Misoprostol-induced diarrhea and the need of multiple daily doses (typically four) are the main issues impairing compliance with therapy.

==Labor induction==
Misoprostol is commonly used for [[labor induction]]. It causes [[uterine]] contractions and the ripening ([[effacement]] or thinning) of the [[cervix]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440107 |title=Misoprostol and Pregnancy |year=2001 |last1=Wood |first1=Alastair J.J. |last2=Goldberg |first2=Alisa B. |last3=Greenberg |first3=Mara B. |last4=Darney |first4=Philip D. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=344 |pages=38–47 |pmid=11136959 |issue=1}}</ref> It is significantly less expensive than the other commonly used ripening agent, [[Prostaglandin E2|dinoprostone]] (trade names ''Cervidil'' and ''Prepidil'').<ref name="summers"/>

[[Oxytocin]] (trade names ''Pitocin'' and ''Syntocinon'') has long been used as the standard agent for labor induction, but doesn't work well when the cervix is not yet ripe.  In addition to being used alone to induce labor, misoprostol may be used in conjunction with oxytocin.<ref name="summers">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0091-2182(96)00138-3 |title=Methods of cervical ripening and labor induction |year=1997 |last1=Summers |first1=L |journal=Journal of Nurse-Midwifery |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=71–85 |pmid=9107114}}</ref> 

Protocols for inducing labor with misoprostol typically call for 25&nbsp;μg to be administered vaginally.<ref name="goldberg"/> In countries where the only approved use of misoprostol is ulcer prevention, misoprostol is not sold in tablets smaller than 100&nbsp;μg.  When used for induction, the 100&nbsp;μg tablet is commonly split into two or four pieces.<ref name="briggs"/>

As of October 2012, misoprostol was not approved by the United States FDA for use as a labor-induction drug; however, an NDA for that purpose has been filed and is under review.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ferring announces FDA acceptance of NDA filing for controlled release Misoprostol Vagincal Insert for decreasing time to vaginal delivery in women|url=http://www.ferringusa.com/news_and_events/view/88/}}</ref>

===Controversy===

When Cytotec first came on the market, the label listed a contraindication that it not be used on pregnant women. In August 2000, due to increase of "off label" usage, [[G. D. Searle & Company|Searle]] (the manufacturer of Cytotec) distributed a letter warning against the use of misoprostol in pregnant women.  In addition to citing the [[abortifacient]] nature of the drug, the letter cited reports of [[uterine rupture]] and death associated with using misoprostol to induce labor.  All cervical ripening and induction agents can cause [[uterine hyperstimulation]], which can negatively affect the blood supply to the fetus and increases the risk of complications such as uterine rupture.<ref name="briggs">{{cite journal |doi=10.2146/ajhp050265.p2 |title=Drug therapy during labor and delivery, part 2 |year=2006 |last1=Briggs |first1=G.

==Induced abortion==
===Earlier pregnancy===
Misoprostol is one of the drugs used for [[medical abortion]]s in lieu of surgical evacuation.  The advantages of medical abortion over [[vacuum aspiration|surgical abortion]] include reduced invasiveness of the procedure, lack of risks from [[general anesthesia]] (which is sometimes used for surgical abortions), and lack of risk of secondary [[infertility]] due to scarring and [[intrauterine adhesions]] ([[Asherman's Syndrome]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Furthermore, it is less complicated to administer and less expensive.

In many countries,{{Which?|date=February  2009}} including China, it is used in conjunction with [[mifepristone]] (RU-486).{{cn|date=February 2013}} After mifepristone is taken orally, misoprostol is taken 24&ndash;72 hours later, causing the expulsion of the embryo and associated matter in approximately 92% of the cases.  No large studies have established a protocol for the use of misoprostol alone,<ref>{{cite web|title=Annotated Bibliography on Misoprostol Alone for Early Abortion|publisher=Gynuity Health Projects|url=http://www.rhtp.org/news/publications/documents/Miso%20for%20Pregnancy%20Termination.Bibliography.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-08-22}}</ref> and the range of efficacy is 65%&ndash;93% depending on sample size, gestational age, and other test variables;<ref>{{cite web|title=Medication Abortion: Misoprostol Alone|publisher=Ibis|accessdate=2006-09-08|url=http://www.medicationabortion.com/misoprostol/index.html}}</ref> Misoprostol alone may be more effective in earlier gestation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instructions for Use: Abortion Induction with Misoprostol in Pregnancies up to 9 Weeks LMP|publisher=Gynuity Health Projects|format=PDF|year=2003|url=http://www.rhtp.org/news/publications/documents/Miso%20for%20Pregnancy%20Termination.IFU.English.pdf#search=%22%20site%3Awww.rhtp.org%20misoprostol%20abortion%20success%20rate%22|accessdate=2006-08-24}}</ref> The side effects associated with the misoprostol only regimen are generally much more severe than those associated with the combined regimens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Misoprostol is used for [[self-induced abortion]]s in Brazil, where [[black market]] prices exceed US $100 per dose. Illegal medically unsupervised misoprostol abortions in Brazil are associated with a lower complication rate than other forms of illegal self-induced abortion, but are still associated with a higher complication rate than legal, medically supervised surgical and chemical abortions. Failed misoprostol abortions are associated with birth defects in some cases.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)91156-G |title=Misoprostol and illegal abortion in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |year=1993 |last1=Costa |first1=S.H |last2=Vessey |first2=M.P |journal=The Lancet |volume=341 |issue=8855 |pmid=8098402 |pages=1258–61}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-7824(94)90084-1 |title=Misoprostol: The experience of women in Fortaleza, Brazil |year=1994 |last1=Coêlho |first1=Helena Lutéscia |last2=Teixeira |first2=Ana Cláudia |last3=De Fátima Cruz |first3=Maria |last4=Gonzaga |first4=Sandra Luzia |last5=Arrais |first5=Paulo Sérgio |last6=Luchini |first6=Laura |last7=La Vecchia |first7=Carlo |last8=Tognoni |first8=Gianni |journal=Contraception |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=101–10 |pmid=8143449}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Regina Maria |last1=Barbosa |first2=Margareth |last2=Arilha |year=1993 |title=The Brazilian Experience with Cytotec |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=236–40 |jstor=2939191 |doi=10.2307/2939191 |pmid=8212093}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6957.757a |title=Brazil investigates drug's possible link with birth defects |year=1994 |last1=Rocha |first1=J |journal=BMJ |volume=309 |issue=6957 |pmid=7950553 |pages=757–8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320470113 |title=Limb deficiency with or without Möbius sequence in seven Brazilian children associated with misoprostol use in the first trimester of pregnancy |year=1993 |last1=Gonzalez |first1=Claudette Hajaj |last2=Vargas |first2=Fernando R. |last3=Perez |first3=Ana Beatriz Alvarez |last4=Kim |first4=Chong Ae |last5=Brunoni |first5=Decio |last6=Marques-Dias |first6=Maria Joaquina |last7=Leone |first7=Clea R. |last8=Neto |first8=Jordão Correa |last9=Llerena |first9=Juan C. |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=47 |pages=59–64 |pmid=8368254 |issue=1}}</ref> Poor immigrant populations in [[New York]] have also been observed to use self administered misoprostol to induce abortions, as this method is much cheaper than a surgical abortion (about $2 per dose).<ref>[[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]]: "[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/weekinreview/02leland.html Abortion Might Outgrow Its Need for Roe v. Wade]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 2, 2005</ref>

===Later pregnancy===
Misoprostol can also be used to dilate the cervix in preparation for a surgical abortion, particularly in the second trimester (either alone or in combination with [[laminaria]] stents).

==Missed miscarriage==
Misoprostol is sometimes used to treat early fetal death in the absence of spontaneous [[miscarriage]], but further research is needed to establish a safe, effective protocol.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002253.pub3 |title=Medical treatment for early fetal death (less than 24 weeks) |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2006 |last1=Neilson |first1=James P |last2=Hickey |first2=Martha |last3=Vazquez |first3=Juan C |editor1-last=Neilson |editor1-first=James P |pmid=16855990 |issue=3 |pages=CD002253}}</ref>

Misoprostol is regularly used in some Canadian hospitals for labour induction for fetal deaths early in pregnancy, and for termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies.  A low dose is used initially, then doubled for the remaining doses until delivery.  In the case of a previous Caesarian Section, however, lower doses are used.

==Post-partum hemorrhage==
Misoprostol is also used to prevent and treat [[post-partum hemorrhage]]. Orally administered misoprostol at a dosage of 600 ug was tested versus [[oxytocin]] 10iu in a large randomised controlled study. The study which involved a substantial number of patients receiving either oral or intravenous [[oxytocin]] showed that misoprostol is  marginally less effective for this purpose.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(02)02371-2 |title=Systematic review of randomized controlled trials of misoprostol to prevent postpartum hemorrhage |year=2002 |last1=Villar |first1=J |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=100 |issue=6 |pmid=12468178 |pages=1301–12 |last2=Gülmezoglu |first2=AM |last3=Hofmeyr |first3=GJ |last4=Forna |first4=F}}</ref>  The use of rectally administered misoprostol is optimal in cases of haemorrhage; it was shown to be associated with lower incidence of side effects compared to other routes for this particular indication. Rectally administered misoprostol at dosages of 800ug or 1000 ug was reported in a variety of case reports and randomised controlled trials.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(98)00161-6 |title=Rectally administered misoprostol for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage unresponsive to oxytocin and ergometrine: A descriptive study |year=1998 |last1=O'Brien |first1=P |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=92 |issue=2 |pmid=9699753 |pages=212–4 |last2=El-Refaey |first2=H |last3=Gordon |first3=A |last4=Geary |first4=M |last5=Rodeck |first5=CH}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0412.2001.080009835.x |title=A randomized study comparing rectally administered misoprostol versus Syntometrine combined with an oxytocin infusion for the cessation of primary post partum hemorrhage |year=2001 |last1=Lokugamage |first1=Amali U. |last2=Sullivan |first2=Keith R. |last3=Niculescu |first3=Iosif |last4=Tigere |first4=Patrick |last5=Onyangunga |first5=Felix |last6=Refaey |first6=Hazem El |last7=Moodley |first7=Jagidesa |last8=Rodeck |first8=Charles H. |journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica |volume=80 |issue=9 |pages=835–9 |pmid=11531635}}</ref>  However, it is inexpensive and thermostable (thus does not require refrigeration like oxytocin) making it a cost effective and valuable drug to use in the developing world.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2006.12.005 |title=Cost-effectiveness of misoprostol to control postpartum hemorrhage in low-resource settings |year=2007 |last1=Bradley |first1=S.E.K. |last2=Prata |first2=N. |last3=Young-Lin |first3=N. |last4=Bishai |first4=D.M. |journal=International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics |volume=97 |pmid=17316646 |pages=52–6 |issue=1}}</ref> A randomised control trial of misoprostol use found a 38% reduction in maternal deaths due to post-partum haemorrhage in resource-poor communities.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69522-6 |title=Oral misoprostol in preventing postpartum haemorrhage in resource-poor communities: A randomised controlled trial |year=2006 |last1=Derman |first1=Richard J |last2=Kodkany |first2=Bhalchandra S |last3=Goudar |first3=Shivaprasad S |last4=Geller |first4=Stacie E |last5=Naik |first5=Vijaya A |last6=Bellad |first6=MB |last7=Patted |first7=Shobhana S |last8=Patel |first8=Ashlesha |last9=Edlavitch |first9=Stanley A |journal=The Lancet |volume=368 |issue=9543 |pmid=17027730 |pages=1248–53}}</ref> Misoprostol is recommended due to its cost, effectiveness, stability, and low rate of side effects.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Harshad |last1=Sanghvi |first2=Mohammad |last2=Zulkarnain |first3=Gail Fraser |last3=Chanpong |editor1-first=Ann |editor1-last=Blouse |editor2-first=Dana |editor2-last=Lewison |year=2009 |title=Prevention of Postpartum Hemorrhage at Home Birth: A Program Implementation Guide |publisher=[[United States Agency for International Development]] |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADX368.pdf}}{{pn|date=September 2012}}</ref> Oxytocin must also be given by injection, while misprostol can be given orally or rectally for this use, making it much more useful in areas where nurses and physicians are less available.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/heapol/czs068 |title=New hope: community-based misoprostol use to prevent postpartum haemorrhage|year=2012 |last1=Prata |first1=Ndola |last2=Passano |first2=Paige |last3=Bell |first3=Suzanne |last4=Rowen |first4=Tami |last5=Potts |first5=Malcolm |journal=Health Policy and Planning |volume=368 |issue=2012 Aug 9.

==Other gynecological uses==
Although the practice remains uncommon, some gynecologists are now using low doses of misoprostol to soften the cervix prior to the insertion of [[intrauterine device]]s (especially in [[nulliparous]] women where insertion may be challenging).

==Erectile dysfunction==
A 1998 study found misoprostol to be helpful as a supplement to a vacuum pump (VED) in the treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]], but not effective by itself.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1460-2679.1998.00030.x |title=Intraurethral misoprostol: A different agent in the treatment of erectile dysfunction |year=1998 |last1=Ekmekcioglu |last2=Demirci |last3=Yilmaz |last4=Tatlisen |journal=Sexual Dysfunction |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=161}}</ref> The paper concluded "The intraurethral application of misoprostol significantly improves the quality of VED-induced erections. This agent seems to be a cheap intraurethral adjunct to VED with mild to moderate local side-effects".

==Pharmacology==
Misoprostol, a prostaglandin, binds to myometrial cells to cause strong myometrial contractions leading to expulsion of tissue. This agent also causes cervical ripening with softening and dilation of the cervix.

==Side effects and contraindications==
The most commonly reported [[adverse effect]] of taking a misoprostol 200&nbsp;µg tablet by mouth four times a day to reduce the risk of NSAID induced gastric ulcers is [[diarrhea]]. In clinical trials, an average 13% of patients reported diarrhea, which was dose-related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days) and was usually self-limiting (often resolving within 8 days), but sometimes (in 2% of patients) required discontinuation of misoprostol.<ref name="Cytotec USPI">{{cite web |author=[[Pfizer]] |month=September |year=2006 |title=Cytotec US Prescribing Information |url=http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_cytotec.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

The next most commonly reported adverse effects of taking a misoprostol 200&nbsp;µg tablet by mouth four times a day to reduce the risk of NSAID induced gastric ulcers are: [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[flatulence]], [[headache]], [[dyspepsia]], [[vomiting]], and [[constipation]], but none of these adverse effects occurred significantly more often than when taking [[placebo]]s.<ref name="Cytotec USPI"/>   In practice, fever is almost universal when multiple doses are given every 4 to 6 hours.
 
Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of NSAID induced gastric ulcers because it increases uterine tone and contractions in pregnancy which may cause partial or complete abortions, and because its use in pregnancy has been associated with birth defects.<ref name="Cytotec USPI"/><ref name="Cytotec UK SPC">{{cite web |author=[[Pharmacia]] |month=July |year=2004 |title=Cytotec UK SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics) |url=http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=9352 |accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>
