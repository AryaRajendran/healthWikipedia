==History==
The organization grew out of an "informal coalition" of support groups and families called together in 1982 to advocate legislation supporting development of [[orphan drug]]s, or drugs for treating rare diseases.<ref name=retirement>{{Cite web| url=http://www.eurordis.org/article.php3?id_article=1498 | title=Abbey Meyers, President of NORD, announces her retirement | publisher=European Organization for Rare Disorders | accessdate=14 February 2009 |date = July 2007| first=Jerome | last=Parisse-Brassens}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  They succeeded in getting the [[United States Congress]] to pass the [[Orphan Drug Act]] (ODA) in early 1983.<ref name=about/><ref name=retirement/><ref name=millions>{{Cite web| url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/health-care-hospitals/20090213/DC7071513022009-1.html | title=Millions Around World to Observe Rare Disease Day | accessdate=14 February 2009 | date=13 February 2009 | publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref><ref name=henkel>{{Cite web| url=http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/1999/399_orph.html | last=Henkel | first=John | title=Orphan Drug Law Matures into Medical Mainstay | year=1999 | work=[[FDA Consumer]] | publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate=14 February 2009}}</ref>

The initial coalition was led by Abbey Meyers, whose son had [[Tourette syndrome]].<ref name=pp>{{Cite web| url=http://powerfulpatient.org/archive/2008/08b_diagnosis.php | work=Powerful Patient | year=2008 | title=Abbey Meyers and the National Organization for Rare Disorders | publisher=VHL Family Alliance | first=Joyce | last=Graff | accessdate=14 February 2009}}</ref>  Tourette syndrome is not a rare disorder, but Meyers' son was helped by an orphan drug.  After passage of the Orphan Drug Act the coalition founded NORD with Meyers as its president.  In 2007 Meyers announced her retirement from the NORD presidency;<ref name=retirement/> the president is now Peter Saltonstall.<ref name=reuters/>

Since its founding NORD continued to grow with the help of [[Federal government|federal]] [[grant (money)|grant]]s<ref name=retirement/> and donations.

NORD's operations include funding research on treatment and cures for rare diseases; lobbying for legislation to benefit the rare diseases community (in addition to the Orphan Drug Act, NORD has helped bring about legislation on publicizing clinical trials on the [[Internet]], and on the development of [[medical device]]s<ref name=retirement/>); spreading information about rare diseases; and helping individuals with rare diseases afford medication and treatment.<ref name=about/><ref name=rare>{{Cite web| url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090202/LIFE/902020307/-1/ENTERTAIN | title='Rare' diseases aren't rare to those who suffer them | accessdate=14 February 2009 | date=2 February 2009 | first=Paul G. | last=Donohue | work=[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|The Standard-Times]]}}</ref>    In February 2009, NORD sponsored [[Rare Disease Day]] in the United States; this was the first time Rare Disease Day was observed in the United States (it was first observed in [[Europe]] in February 2008).<ref name=millions/><ref name=mystery>{{Cite web| url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/television/20090209/PH6815409022009-1.html | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | accessdate=14 February 2009 | title=National Organization for Rare Disorders To Partner With Discovery Health and 'MYSTERY DIAGNOSIS' for Rare Disease Day 2009 | date=9 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=pharmi>{{Cite web| url=http://www.pharmiweb.com/pressreleases/pressrel.asp?ROW_ID=5655 | title=February 28th is Rare Disease Day | date=12 February 2009 | accessdate=14 February 2009 | work=PharmiWeb.com}}</ref>
