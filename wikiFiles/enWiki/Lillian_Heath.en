'''Lilian Heath''' (December 29, 1865 &ndash; August 5, 1962) was the first female [[Physician|medical doctor]] in the state of [[Wyoming]] and one of the first to practice medicine west of the [[Mississippi River]]. After the outlaw [[Big Nose George]] Parrott was lynched she was given the top of his skull which she called a "brain bowl" and used alternately as a doorstop and pen jar.

Heath was born in [[Burnett, Wisconsin|Burnett Junction, Wisconsin]], on December 29, 1865. Her family moved to [[Aplington, Iowa]], and later to [[Laramie, Wyoming]], before moving to [[Rawlins, Wyoming]], where her father got a job as a locomotive painter for the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].<ref name=NIH>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_354.html Dr. Lillian Heath Nelson], [[National Institutes of Health]].

Accessed June 8, 2010.</ref>  She observed the [[solar eclipse of July 29, 1878]], along with scientist [[Henry Draper]] and inventor [[Thomas Edison]], who had come to Wyoming to conduct experiments and had stayed in the Rawlins House, where the Heaths were living at the time.<ref name=MIW>[http://www.madeinwyoming.net/profiles/timelines/LillianHeathtimeline.pdf Dr. Lillian Heath Timeline], Made in Wyoming.

In the early 1880s, Heath's father obtained a job for her as an assistant to Dr. Thomas Maghee, a physician employed by the Union Pacific Railroad. Heath would wear men's clothing and carried a gun as protection. She assisted Maghee, helping treat his patients, including one who had attempted suicide by shooting himself in the chin. Maghee and Heath performed an early example of [[plastic surgery]] on the man, recreating a nose from a section of his forehead.<ref name=NIH/> After the March 22, 1881, lynching of infamous outlaw [[Big Nose George]] Parrott for the murder of Robert Widdowfield, Heath was a witness at the autopsy performed by Maghee and was given the skull cap that had been sawn off Parrott's head as a souvenir, while other portions of his body were made into a pair of shoes.<ref>Van Pelt, Lori.[http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_edbf3ef2-6813-5fbe-86e4-69ff78f6ef15.html "Unburied bones"], ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'', March 23, 2003.

The skull cap was put on display at the [[Union Pacific railroad#Union Pacific Railroad Museum|Union Pacific Railroad Historical Museum]] in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]], while the remainder of the skull is on display at the Carbon County Museum in Rawlins.<ref name=MIW/><ref>[http://www.historicomaha.com/upmusm.htm Union Pacific Railroad Historical Museum], HistoricOmaha.com.

Heath graduated from [[Rawlins High School]] in 1888. She enrolled in the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] for a year, and then transferred to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in [[Keokuk, Iowa]], where she was one of three women in the entering class of 22 students. She graduated from medical school in 1893 and came back to Rawlins, where she established a medical office in her parents' house.<ref name=MIW/>

On October 24, 1898, she married Louis J. Nelson of Rawlins, a painter and decorator.<ref name=MIW/> Her husband used the top part of the skull cap as a tobacco pipe ashtray.<ref>Stoner, Sarah.

Heath retired from practicing medicine about 1909. She died at Rawlins Memorial Hospital on August 5, 1962, of complications of a broken hip caused by a fall.<ref name=MIW/>
