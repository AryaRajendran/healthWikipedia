'''Sinus [[bradycardia]]''' is a heart rhythm that originates from the [[sinus node]] and has a rate of under 60 [[beats per minute]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The decreased heart rate can cause a decreased cardiac output resulting in symptoms such as [[lightheadedness]], [[dizziness]], [[hypotension]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].  The slow heart rate may also lead to [[atrial]], junctional, or [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] ectopic rhythms.

Bradycardia is not necessarily problematic. People who regularly practice sports may have sinus bradycardia, because their trained hearts can pump enough blood in each contraction to allow a low [[resting heart rate]].

Sinus Bradycardia can aid in the sport of [[Freediving]], which includes any of various aquatic activities that share the practice of breath-hold underwater diving.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  Bradycardia aids in this process due to drop in blood rate pulse.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  These adaptations enable the human body to endure depth and lack of oxygen far beyond what would be possible without the [[mammalian diving reflex]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Sinus bradycardia is a sinus rhythm of less than 60 bpm. It is a common condition found in both healthy individuals and those who are considered well conditioned athletes.

=Causes=
*This rhythm may be caused by one of the following:
**Increased [[vagal]] [[Muscle tone|tone]].
**[[Sleep]]
**[[Hypothermia]]
**[[Hypothyroidism]]
**Intrinsic disease of the [[SA node]] (E.g. [[sick sinus syndrome]]).
**An effect of [[drugs]], such as the use of [[digitalis]], [[beta-blockers]], [[quinidine]], [[Adenosine]], [[Calcium channel blocker]].
**[[Seizure]].
**It could also be a normal finding in a healthy, well-conditioned person.
**It may be secondary to infections like [[Diphtheria]], acute [[rheumatic fever]], viral [[myocarditis]]. It is physiologic in trained athletes.
**Increased intracranial pressure.
**[[Grayanotoxin|Rhodotoxin]] poisoning.

==Diagnosis==
ECG Characteristics
*Rate:  Less than 60 beats per minute.
*Rhythm:  Regular.
*[[P waves]]:  Upright, consistent, and normal in morphology and duration.
*[[P-R Interval]]:  Between 0.12-0.20 seconds in duration.
*[[QRS Complex]]:  Less than 0.12 seconds in width, and consistent in morphology.
