'''Aniridia'''  is the absence of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. Aniridia usually involves both eyes. It can be  congenital or caused by a penetrant injury.<ref  name="Lang2">{{cite book |title=Ophthalmology: A Pocket  Textbook Atlas  (2nd ed.) |page=208 |author=Lang, K |year=2007  |publisher=Thieme  |isbn=1-58890-555-1}}</ref>  Isolated aniridia is a [[congenital]] disorder which is not limited to a defect in iris development,  but is a  panocular condition with [[macular hypoplasia|macular]] and [[optic nerve hypoplasia]], [[cataract]],  and [[cornea]]l changes.<ref name="eMedicine">{{cite  web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1208379-overview  |title=Aniridia |publisher=eMedicine |first=Daljit |last=Singh |coauthors=Arun Verma  |accessdate=2 February 2010 |date=17 January 2008}}</ref> Vision  may be severely compromised and the disorder is frequently  associated with a number of ocular complications: [[nystagmus]], [[amblyopia]], [[buphthalmos]], and [[cataract]].<ref  name="Lang2" /> Aniridia in some individuals is associated with [[Wilms tumor|kidney nephroblastoma]] (Wilms tumor), genitourinary anomalies, or mental retardation and [[cerebellar ataxia]] ([[Gillespie syndrome]]), resulting in the [[WAGR syndrome]].

==PAX6==

[[File:023-p-039-9426.jpg|thumb|left|Phenotypic  expression of aniridia with [[PAX6]] gene mutation. The aniridic  probands showed typical features of [[sclerocornea]] with nystagmus in proband 28–1 (A); Foveal hypoplasia in  proband 27–1 (B);  Ptosis, microcornea with dislocated cataractous lens in proband 10–1 (C); Ectopia lentis in  proband 16–1 (D).]]

The AN2 region of the short  arm of [[chromosome 11]]  (11p13) includes the [[PAX6]]  gene (named for its PAired boX status), whose gene product helps  regulate a cascade of other genetic processes involved in the  development of the eye (as well as other nonocular structures).<ref>{{cite  journal |author=Lee H, Khan R, O'Keefe M |title=Aniridia:  current pathology and management |journal=Acta Ophthalmol |volume=86  |issue=7  |pages=708–15 |year=2008  |month=November  |pmid=18937825  |doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.2008.01427.x  |url=}}</ref>  This PAX6 gene is around 95% similar to the pax gene found in [[zebrafish]], a creature whose ancestors diverged from human evolutionary development around 400 million years ago. Thus the PAX6 gene is  highly conserved across [[evolution]]ary  lineages.

Defects in the PAX6 gene cause aniridia-like ocular  defects in [[mice]]  (as well as ''[[Drosophila]]'').   Aniridia is a [[heterozygous]]  disorder, meaning that only one of the two [[chromosome 11]] copies is affected.  When both  copies are altered ([[homozygous]]  condition), the result is a uniformly fatal condition with near  complete failure of entire eye formation. In 2001, two cases of  homozygous aniridia patients were reported; the fetuses died prior to  birth and had severe brain damage. In mice, homozygous ''small eye'' defect (mouse Pax-6) leads to loss of the eyes and nose and the murine fetuses suffer severe brain damage.<ref>{{cite  journal |last=Gehring |first=W.

==Types==
Aniridia may be broadly divided  into hereditary and sporadic forms.  Hereditary aniridia is usually  transmitted in an [[autosomal dominant]] manner (each offspring has a 50%  chance of being affected), although rare [[autosomal recessive]] forms (such  as [[Gillespie syndrome]]) have also been reported.   Sporadic aniridia [[mutations]]  may affect the WT1 region adjacent to the AN2 aniridia region, causing a  kidney cancer called [[nephroblastoma]]  ([[Wilms tumor]]).   These patients often also have genitourinary abnormalities and [[mental retardation]] ([[WAGR syndrome]]).

Several different  mutations may affect the PAX6 gene. Some mutations appear to inhibit  gene function more than others, with subsequent variability in the  severity of the disease. Thus, some aniridic individuals are only  missing a relatively small amount of iris, do not have [[foveal hypoplasia]],  and retain relatively normal [[Visual perception|vision]].   Presumably, the genetic defect in these individuals causes less  "heterozygous insufficiency," meaning they retain enough gene function  to yield a milder [[phenotype]].

==Mutational Analysis==
Molecular ([[DNA]]) testing for PAX6 gene mutations (by [[sequencing]] of the entire [[coding region]] and [[deletion/duplication analysis]]) is available for isolated aniridia and the Gillespie syndrome. For the WAGR syndrome, [[high-resolution cytogenetic analysis]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) can be utilized to identify deletions within chromosome band 11p13, where both the PAX6 and WT1 genes are located.
