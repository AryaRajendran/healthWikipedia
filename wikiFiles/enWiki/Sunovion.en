'''Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.''' ( former NASDAQ: '''SEPR''' ), known until October 12, 2010 as '''Sepracor, Inc.''' prior to its acquisition by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma of Japan,<ref name="PR">[http://www.sunovion.com/news/pressReleases/20101012.pdf Company press release]</ref> is a [[pharmaceutical company]] founded in 1984 by Timothy J. Barberich, Steve Matson, and Bob Bratzler. It was originally located in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]] and then re-located to [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=sepr SEPR: Profile for SEPRACOR INC - Yahoo! Finance]</ref>

==Company history==
The company's initial focus was on the development of single isomers and active metabolites. This concept allowed Barberich and Doug Reedich to generate a patent estate that served the company well for many years. Therapeutically, Sepracor's products were focused on the treatment of central nervous system and respiratory disorders, under the direction of Gunnar Aberg, and John McCullough.  The primary source of its revenue is the approximately $600 million annually from its [[Xopenex]] franchise of drugs, launched under the marketing leadership of John Simon, with the direct involvement of Medical Communications, under Dean Handley. It is available as a multi-dose inhaler (MDI) or nebulized (UDV) form.  However, the insomnia drug [[Lunesta]] (eszopiclone), which was discovered by Tom Jerussi, approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in December 2004 and launched in April 2005 under the marketing leadership of Tim Healy, is on pace to exceed $1 billion in annual sales.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} On February 13, 2006, Sepracor filed a new drug application for [[Brovana]], patented by Gunnar Aberg and John Morley, (also launched under John Simon) to treat [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]. All of the launch drugs were manufactured under the leadership of Walter Piskorski.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Sepracor has broad exposure to generic competition, as both Xopenex inhalation solution and Lunesta brands will face expiring patents at nearly the same time in March 2012, leaving [[Omnaris]], [[Alvesco]], [[Brovana]] and [[Stedesa]] to fill in the revenue gaps.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Sepracor suffered five recent{{When|date=February 2011}} setbacks. The first was the announcement that it had completed the analysis and validation of the preliminary results of a Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of SEP-225289 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder where Sepracor determined that SEP-225289 did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint (a reduction in symptoms of depression following eight weeks of treatment). However, the positive control in the study (venlafaxine extended-release)did achieve separation from placebo that was statistically significant on the primary endpoint. Dr Corrigan, responsible for the study, could not explain why clinical study of his design has failed. Secondly, Sepracor has announced patent interference between Sepracor and Wyeth.<ref>[http://www.newsrx.com/newsletters/Medical-Patent-Law-Weekly/2009-05-06/370506200984ML.html]</ref> The interference seeks to determine the priority of invention claims directed to racemic O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODMV) succinate. Wyeth markets racemic ODMV succinate (the active racemic metabolites of venlafaxine) in the US under the brand name PRISTIQ for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. Thirdly, the FDA has notified Sepracor that two clinical studies on eszopiclone in children have been put on clinical hold due the FDAs concerns regarding non-clinical data that could be relevant to the administration of eszopiclone in children.<ref name="phx.corporate-ir.net">[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=90106&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1304044&highlight=]</ref> Fourthly, the European Medicines Agency, the European Union’s version of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has approved Lunesta for sale, but didn’t grant the request by Sepracor to designate it as a new active substance. Because of the EMA decision, Sepracor and GSK are terminating completely their plan to market the drug in the EU.<ref>[http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2009/05/11/daily48-Sepracor-GSK-call-off-Lunesta-marketing-deal-in-EU.html]</ref> Lastly, Sepracor recently announced it has reached a licensing agreement and settled litigation with a division of Teva Pharmaceuticals USA to make a generic version of Sepracor’s inhaled asthma drug Xopenex.<ref>[http://boston.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2009/03/09/daily37.html]</ref>

===Acquisition by Dainippon Sumitomo===
On September 2, 2009, shares of Sepracor were halted on the [[Nasdaq]] due to pending news of a takeover bid by Japanese drugmaker [[Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma|Dainippon Sumitomo]]. According to the [[Associated Press]], Dainippon planned to offer $2.6 billion for Sepracor, a nearly 28% premium over the stock's closing price on September 1.<ref>http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Dainippon-of-Japan-acquires-apf-3135825802.html?x=0&sec=topStories&pos=3&asset=&ccode=</ref> Aside from acquiring such drugs as [[Lunesta]] and [[Xopenex]], analysts said the acquisition would give Dainippon access to "Sepracor's sales force of roughly 1,200", which would open an avenue for the Japanese company to market its drugs in the United States.<ref name="reuters.com">http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINN0254527320090902?rpc=44</ref> Sepracor was set to face stiff generic competition from its expiring patents (Xopenex in 2012 and Lunesta in 2014), and had failed to discover any viable drugs in nearly 10 years.<ref>[http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2009/09/03/drugmaker-sepracor-accepts-26b-buyout-offer-from-japans-dainippon/]</ref><ref>[http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2009/09/03/sepracor-gets-a-healthy-buyout/]</ref>

Sepracor shareholders planned to block the deal, arguing the initial offer was below Sepracor's true market value and that the management team at Sepracor had breached their fiduciary responsibilities and agreed to terms designed to prevent anyone from making a superior offer.<ref>[http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/sepracor-shareholders-sue-block-deal/2009-09-09]</ref><ref>[http://www.classactionfaq.com/class-action-faq/sepracor/]</ref> They claimed Sepracor directors had failed to conduct an appropriate sales process and implemented precluding deal protections that inhibit an alternate transaction and further that Sepracor directors "did not undertake to canvas the market prior to entering into the proposed merger and thus failed to inform themselves of the inherent fair value of the company."<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=aJ0k9vv49mx8]</ref>

Despite the opposition, a formal announcement of the acquisition was made on October 12, 2010, which stated that Sunovion would be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of [[Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma]] Co. Ltd.<ref name="PR"/>

In December 2012, Sunovion announced it would be closing the plant in mid-2013, with operations moving to other plants.<ref>{{cite news|title=Windsor pharmaceutical company closing mid-2013|url=http://www.hantsjournal.ca/News/2012-12-05/article-3134074/Windsor-pharmaceutical-company-closing-mid-2013/1|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Hants Journal]]|date=December 8, 2012}}</ref>

===GlaxoSmithKline===
On September 11, 2007, Sepracor signed a marketing deal with British pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] for the rights to sell Eszopiclone (under the name '''Lunivia''' rather than Lunesta) in [[Europe]].<ref name=autogenerated1>http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070911/sepracor_contract.html?.v=1</ref> Sepracor was expected to receive approximately 155 million dollars if the deal went through.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 2008 Sepracor submitted an application to the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] (the European Union's equivalent to the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]) for authorization to market the drug in the EU, and initially received a favourable response.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2010/02/WC500070840.pdf COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USEm SUMMARY OF POSITIVE OPINION for LUNIVIA] - [[European Medicines Agency]]/[[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]], 23 Oct 2010</ref>  However Sepracore withdrew its authorization application in 2009 after the EMA stated it would not be granting eszopiclone 'new active substance' status, as it was essentially pharmacologically and therapeutically too similar to [[zopiclone]].<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2009/11/news_detail_000083.jsp&jsenabled=true Sepracor Pharmaceuticals Ltd withdraws its marketing authorisation application for Lunivia (eszopiclone)] - [[European Medicines Agency]], 15 May 2009</ref> Since zopiclone's [[patent]] has expired, this ruling would have allowed rival companies to also legally produce cheaper [[Generic drug|generic]] versions of eszopiclone for the European market.<ref>[http://www.twobirds.com/English/News/Articles/Pages/Data_exclusivity_definition_new_active_substance.Aspx Data exclusivity and definition of a new active substance: suspension of generic escitalopram-containing medicines by CHMP] - Bird and Bird Commercial Law 23 Apr 2010</ref> {{As of|2011|1}}, Sepracor has not resubmitted its authorization application and Lunesta/Lunivia is not available in Europe.

===Nycomed===

===Omnaris and Alvesco===
The company recently acquired [[Omnaris]] and [[Alvesco]] for $150M upfront and an addition $280M in potential milestones. Alvesco revenues for Q4'08 were -$0.3 million because returns from the "stocking" in Q3'08 exceeded the demand in Q4'08. The company disclosed a 2009 forecast of $25–$40M for Omnaris and $10–15M for Alvesco; yielding a combined total of $35M-$55M in year 2 of a launch. However, revenues continue to be dismal, prompting criticisms and concerns over the purchase price relative to minuscule income.

==2009 layoffs and stock incentive plan==
In January 2009, Sepracor announced a series of layoffs due to the challenging economic environment for both the country and the pharmaceutical industry.<ref>http://laidoffnation.com/2009/02/sepracor-layoffs/</ref> However, current CEO, Mr. Adrian Adams, accepted a pay increase to put him at around $6.5 million annually, and was the seventh highest paid CEO in Massachusetts in 2007.<ref>[http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/10001632/sepracor-ceo-got-44-raise-as-he-planned-940-layoffs/]</ref> Furthermore, the management has awarded top executives with a new 2009 stock incentive plan that will allow executives to receive a maximum of 500,000 shares per year before any performance objectives are reached. The exact number of shares for each executive will be determined by the board compensation committee, but typical grants for a company this size are 50,000 to 125,000 for each executive and could be a mixture of [[stock]] and [[stock options]].
