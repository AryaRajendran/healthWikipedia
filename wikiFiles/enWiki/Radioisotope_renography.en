'''Radioisotope renography''' is a form of kidney imaging involving [[radioisotope]]s. Different radiolabelled pharmaceuticals are used, and the most commonly used agent is 99mTc-DTPA (Diethylene Triamine Pentacaetic Acid). The other agents are 99mTc-labelled MAG3, EC (Ethyl Cysteine), 131-Iodine labelled OIH (Ortho Iodo Hippurate) etc. DTPA is by far the most frequently used agent.  However, EC is preferred when the serum Creatinine is high. MAG3 is ideal for assessment of ERPF (Effective Renal Plasma Flow).

A '''MAG3 scan''' is a diagnostic imaging procedure that allows a [[nuclear medicine]] physician or [[radiologist]] to visualize the [[kidney]]s and learn more about how they are functioning. MAG3 is an acronym for [[thiol|mercapto]] [[acetyl]] tri [[glycine]], a compound that is [[chelate]]d with a radioactive element - [[technetium-99m]].

'''''NOTE:'''  A MAG3 scan, along with a [[DTPA#Uses|DTPA scan]], are both types of renograms.<ref>{{cite web  |title=Renogram |work=patient leaflet |url=http://www.southend.nhs.uk/NR/rdonlyres/3939B135-F307-43B1-8DDE-1A6AC987577C/0/Renogram.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Southend Hospital |accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref>  This article only deals with MAG3 scans.''

==Scan procedure==
After injection into the venous system, the compound is excreted by the kidneys and its progress through the renal system can be tracked with a [[gamma camera]]. If the kidney is not getting blood for example, it will not be viewed at all, even if it looks structurally normal in [[medical ultrasonography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. If the kidney is getting blood, but there is an obstruction lower down, the contrast will not pass beyond the level of the obstruction, whereas if there is a partial obstruction then there is a delayed transit time for the MAG3 to pass.<ref name="pmid7854921">{{cite journal |author=González A, Jover L, Mairal LI, Martin-Comin J, Puchal R |title=Evaluation of obstructed kidneys by discriminant analysis of 99mTc-MAG3 renograms |journal=Nuklearmedizin |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=244–7 |year=1994 |pmid=7854921 |doi=}}</ref> More information can be gathered by calculating time activity curves; with normal kidney perfusion, peak activity should be observed after 3–5 minutes. The relative quantitative information gives the differential function between each kidney's filtration activity.a

==Clinical use==
The technique is very useful in evaluating the functioning of kidneys. It is widely used before renal [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] to assess the vascularity of the kidney to be transplanted and with a test dose of [[captopril]] to highlight possible [[renal artery stenosis]] in the donor's other kidney,<ref name="pmid1534577">{{cite journal |author=Dubovsky EV, Diethelm AG, Keller F, Russell CD |title=Renal transplant hypertension caused by iliac artery stenosis |journal=J.

The use of the test to identify reduced renal function after test doses of captopril (an [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] inhibitor drug) has also been used to identify the cause of hypertension in patients with renal failure.<ref name="pmid8294993">{{cite journal |author=Datseris IE, Bomanji JB, Brown EA, ''et al.'' |title=Captopril renal scintigraphy in patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure |journal=J.
