'''Black pox''' is a [[symptom]] of [[smallpox]] that is caused by [[bleeding]] under the [[skin]] which makes the skin look [[char]]red or black. It was more common in adults. This symptom usually indicates that a [[patient]] with smallpox is going to [[death|die]].

A [[Physician|doctor]] who encountered black pox stated that "Doctors separate black pox into two forms&mdash;flat [[smallpox]] and [[Hemorrhage|hemorrhagic]] smallpox. In a case of flat smallpox, the skin remains smooth and doesn't [[pustulate]], but it darkens until it looks charred, and it can slip or fall off the body in sheets, sometimes all of it, causing instant death, though that is very rare. In hemorrhagic smallpox, black, [[clot|unclotted]] [[blood]] oozes or runs from the mouth and other [[body orifice]]s. Black pox is close to one hundred percent [[wiktionary:fatal|fatal]]. If any sign of it appears in the body, the victim will almost certainly die. In the hemorrhagic cases, the [[virus]] destroys the linings of the [[throat]], the [[stomach]], the [[intestines]], the [[rectum]], and the [[vagina]], and these [[mucous membrane|membrane]]s disintegrate. Fatal smallpox can destroy the body's entire [[skin]] &mdash; both the exterior skin and the interior skin that lines the passages of the body." <ref>Richard Preston, [http://cryptome.org/smallpox-wmd.htm ''The Demon in the Freezer''], The New Yorker, July 12, 1999, pp. 44-61.</ref>
