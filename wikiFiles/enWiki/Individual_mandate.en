An '''individual mandate''' is a requirement by law that certain persons purchase or otherwise obtain a good or service.

==Health insurance in the US==
In the [[United States]], the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] signed in 2010 imposes a [[health insurance mandate]] to take effect in 2014. In 2010, a number of states joined litigation in federal court arguing that Congress did not have the power to pass this law and that power to "regulate" commerce does not include an affirmative power to compel commerce by penalizing inaction.  On June 28, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld the health insurance mandate as a valid tax, and thus within Congress' tax and spend powers.

In 2011, two of four [[United States courts of appeals|federal appellate courts]] upheld the individual mandate; a third declared it [[ultra vires#Constitutional law|unconstitutional]], and a fourth said the federal [[Anti-Injunction Act (1867)|Anti-Injunction Act]] prevents the issue from being decided until taxpayers begin paying penalties in 2015.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904006104576504383685080762.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Brent | last=Kendall | title=Health Overhaul Is Dealt Setback | date=August 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.startribune.com/nation/127629713.html</ref><ref name="cnn.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/12/13/health.care/?hpt=T1 | work=CNN | title=Virginia judge rules health care mandate unconstitutional | date=December 13, 2010}}</ref>  In 1994, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] issued a report describing an individual mandate to buy insurance as "an unprecedented form of federal action...

==Historical examples==
In 2012, [[Eliot Spitzer]] credited what he called "spectacular historical reporting by Professor Einer Elhauge," who is employed by the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|campaign to re-elect President Obama]],<ref>http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/elhauge/cv.php</ref> for finding 18th century legislation that Spitzer and Elhauge called individual mandates.<ref>http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/may/06/founders-would-like-obamacare/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/102620/individual-mandate-history-affordable-care-act|title=If Health Insurance Mandates Are Unconstitutional, Why Did the Founding Fathers Back Them?|first=Einer|last=Elhauge|publisher=''[[The New Republic]]''}}

The Militia Acts had been reported in 2010 by [[Joe Conason]],<ref>http://www.salon.com/2010/03/25/militia/</ref> but were never federally enforced, so their constitutionality was never litigated.<ref>http://www.slate.com/id/2278063/</ref> 

[[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]], signed into law by President John Adams in 1798, required employers of seamen to pay to the federal Treasury 20 cents per seaman per month, and authorized the President to use the money to pay for "the temporary relief and maintenance of sick or disabled seamen," and to build hospitals to accommodate sick and disabled seamen.<ref>http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=728</ref>  The Act authorized the employer to deduct the monies from the seamen's wages.  (See [[Workers%27_compensation#United_States|Workers' compensation]] and [[Social Security Disability Insurance]].)  Others have called the 1798 statute a tax like [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and said it cannot be called an individual mandate, because it does not require anyone to purchase anything.<ref>http://volokh.com/2010/04/02/an-act-for-the-relief-of-sick-and-disabled-seamen/</ref>

== Economics ==

Given that insurance companies are restricted by law in their ability to alter insurance rates based on [[pre-existing condition]]s, they must set their rates to at least cover their costs. This means that the rates on healthier individuals will be greater than what they would pay otherwise, while reducing the rates on less healthy individuals (e.g., those with pre-existing conditions). The healthier individuals (e.g. the young) will be under economic pressure to opt out of the system, which will cause the insurance companies to raise rates on those remaining insured in order to cover the lost revenue. This will further increase the pressure on healther individuals to opt out of buying health insurance, which will further increase rates, until the market collapses. Mandated insurance is intended to prevent this downward spiral.<ref name="Tanner2006">{{cite book |title=Individual Mandates for Health Insurance: Slippery Slope to National Health Care |first=Michael |last=Tanner |publisher=Cato Institute |year=2006}}</ref>

== Other countries ==

In Australia all States and Territories now have legislation that requires home and building owners to install smoke alarms.  Thus, where these have not been installed, for example, in older homes and buildings, owners must procure or purchase, and install, smoke alarms.<ref>choice.com.au/reviews-and-tests/household/living-and-bedroom/home-safety/buying-guide-smoke-alarms.aspx</ref>  A further example in Australia of legal compulsion to buy a good or service is compulsory third-party personal injury insurance in relation to the ownership of a motor vehicle.<ref>http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/registration/regorenewal/greenslip.html</ref>
