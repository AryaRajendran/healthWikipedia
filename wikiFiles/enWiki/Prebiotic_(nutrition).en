'''Prebiotics''' are non-digestible food ingredients that stimulate the growth and/or activity of bacteria in the digestive system in ways claimed to be beneficial to health. They were first identified and named by Marcel Roberfroid in 1995.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Gibson GR, Roberfroid MB |title=Dietary modulation of the human colonic microbiota: introducing the concept of prebiotics |journal=J Nutr. |year=1995 |month=Jun |volume=125 |issue=6 |pages=1401–1412 |pmid=7782892}}</ref> As a [[functional food]] component, prebiotics, like [[probiotics]], are conceptually intermediate between foods and drugs. Depending on the jurisdiction, they typically receive an intermediate level of regulatory scrutiny, in particular of the [[Health claims on food labels|health claims]] made concerning them.

Roberfroid offered a refined definition in the 2007 Journal of Nutrition<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Roberfroid MB |title=Prebiotics: The Concept Revisited |journal=J Nutr. |year=2007 |volume=137 |pages=830S–7S |pmid=17311983 |issue=3 Suppl 2}}</ref> stating: <blockquote>
A prebiotic is a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well-being and health"</blockquote>

Additionally, in his 2007 revisit of Prebiotics, Roberfroid stated that only two particular prebiotics then fully met this definition: trans-[[galactooligosaccharide]] and [[inulin]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal |author=Roberfroid M |title=Prebiotics: The Concept Revisited |journal=J Nutr. |year=2007 |volume=137 |pages=830S–7S |pmid=17311983 |issue=3 Suppl 2 |quote=Presently there are only 2 food ingredients that fulfill these criteria, i.e., inulin and trans-galactooligosaccharides (TOS). }}</ref> Other authorities also classify [[fructooligosaccharide]] (FOS) and [[lactulose]] as prebiotics. [[Mannan Oligosaccharide based nutritional supplements (MOS)|Mannan Oligosaccharides]] (MOS) have been termed as prebiotics but would more correctly be termed immunosaccharides

Researchers now also focus on the distinction between short-chain, long-chain, and full-spectrum prebiotics. "Short-chain" prebiotics, e.g. oligofructose, contain 2-8 links per saccharide molecule and are typically fermented more quickly in the [[ascending colon|right-side]] of the colon providing nourishment to the bacteria in that area. Longer-chain prebiotics, e.g. inulin, contain 9-64 links per saccharide molecule, and tend to be fermented more slowly, nourishing bacteria predominantly in the [[descending colon|left-side colon]]. Full-spectrum prebiotics provide the full range of molecular link-lengths from 2-64 links per molecule, and nourish bacteria throughout the colon, e.g. Oligofructose-Enriched Inulin (OEI). The majority of research done on prebiotics is based on full-spectrum prebiotics, typically using OEI as the research substance.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Kleessen B, Hartmann L, Blaut M |title=Oligofructose and long-chain inulin: influence on the gut microbial ecology of rats associated with a human faecal flora |journal=British Journal of Nutrition |year=2001 |volume=86 |pages=291–300 |doi=10.1079/BJN2001403 |pmid=11502244 |issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Femia AP, Luceri C, Dolara P, Giannini A, Biggeri A, Salvadori M, Clune Y, Collins KJ, Paglierani M, Caderni G |title=Antitumorigenic activity of the prebiotic inulin enriched with oligofructose in combination with the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium lactis on azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis in rats |journal=Carcinogenesis |volume=23 |pages=1953–1960 |month=Nov |year=2002 |issue=11 |doi=10.1093/carcin/23.11.1953 |pmid=12419846}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Hughes R, Rowland IR |title=Stimulation of apoptosis by two prebiotic chicory fructans in the rat colon |journal=Carcinogenesis |volume=22 |pages=43–47 |month=Jan |year=2001 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/carcin/22.1.43 |pmid=11159739}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Bouhnik Y, Vahedi K, Achour L, Attar A, Salfati J, Pochart P, Marteau P, Flourié B, Bornet F, Rambaud JC |title=Short-chain fructo-oligosaccharide administration dose-dependently increases fecal bifidobacteria in healthy humans |journal=J Nutr. |year=1999 |month=Jan |volume=129 |pages=113–116 |pmid=9915885 |issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Tahiri M, Tressol JC, Arnaud J, Bornet F, Bouteloup-Demange C, Feillet-Coudray C, Ducros V, Pépin D, Brouns F, Rayssiguier AM, Coudray C |title=Five-week intake of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides increases intestinal absorption and status of magnesium in postmenopausal women |journal=J Bone Miner Res. |year=2001 |month=Nov |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=2152–2160 |pmid=11697813 |doi=10.1359/jbmr.2001.16.11.2152}}</ref>

==Function==
The prebiotic definition does not emphasize a specific bacterial group. Generally, however, it is assumed that a prebiotic should increase the number and/or activity of [[bifidobacteria]] and [[lactic acid bacteria]]. The importance of the bifidobacteria and the lactic acid bacteria (LABs) is that these groups of bacteria may have several beneficial effects on the host, especially in terms of improving digestion (including enhancing mineral absorption<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Coxam V |title=Current data with inulin-type fructans and calcium, targeting bone health in adults |journal=J Nutr. |year=2007 |month=Nov |volume=137 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=2527S–2533S |pmid=17951497}}</ref>) and the effectiveness and intrinsic strength of the immune system.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Seifert S, Watzl B |title=Inulin and oligofructose: review of experimental data on immune modulation |journal=J Nutr. |year=2007 |month=Nov |volume=137 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=2563S–2567S |pmid=17951503}}</ref> A product that stimulates bifidobacteria is considered a bifidogenic factor. Some prebiotics may thus also act as a [[Bifidus factor|bifidogenic factor]] and vice versa, but the two concepts are not identical.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/ff/prebiotics.htm |title=Prebiotics |work=Food-Info.net |publisher=Wageningen University}}</ref>

==Sources==
Traditional dietary sources of prebiotics include [[soybeans]], [[inulin]] sources (such as [[Jerusalem artichoke]], [[jicama]], and [[chicory]] root), raw [[oat]]s, unrefined wheat, unrefined [[barley]], and [[yacon]]. Some of the oligosaccharides that naturally occur in [[breast milk]] are believed to play an important role in the development of a healthy [[immune system]] in infants.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Frank|title=Breast Milk|url=http://www.prebiotin.com/breast-milk/|publisher=Jackson GI Medical|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref> 

It is becoming more common to properly distinguish between prebiotic substances and the food that contains them. References to almonds, honey and other foods (most commonly in promotional materials from growers or producers of those foods) as "a prebiotic" are not accurate. No plant or food ''is'' a prebiotic; wheat, honey and many other foods ''contain'' prebiotics to a greater or lesser extent, ranging from fairly large portions ([[chicory root]], [[Jerusalem artichoke]]) to only trace quantities (thousands of other plant-based foods). Referring to a food as "a prebiotic" is no more accurate than calling a food "a vitamin".

While there is no broad consensus on an ideal daily serving of prebiotics, recommendations typically range from {{convert|4|to(-)|8|g}} for general digestive health support, to {{convert|15|g}} or more for those with active digestive disorders. Given an average {{convert|6|g}} serving, below are the amounts of prebiotic foods required to achieve a daily serving of prebiotic fiber:

Those wishing to ensure sufficient prebiotic intake should carefully consider the prebiotic content of their diet, as well as what caloric/nutritive load comes along with it: e.g., eating {{convert|600|g|lb}} of bananas daily is likely to provide an excess of calories and sugars/carbohydrates to the diet. Prebiotic fiber supplements with minimal caloric/fat/sugar load are also available.

Prebiotic oligosaccharides are increasingly added to foods for their health benefits. Some oligosaccharides that are used in this manner are [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS), [[xylooligosaccharide]]s (XOS), [[polydextrose]], and [[galactooligosaccharides]] (GOS). Moreover disaccharids like [[lactulose]] or some monosaccharides such as [[tagatose]] are also used sometimes as prebiotics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Also in petfood, [[mannooligosaccharide]]s are being used for prebiotic purposes.

While research does clearly demonstrate that prebiotics lead to increased production of these SCFA,<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Macfarlane S, Macfarlane GT, Cummings JH |title=Review article: prebiotics in the gastrointestinal tract |journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther. |year=2006 |month=Sep |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=701–714 |pmid=16918875 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03042.x}}</ref> more research is required to establish a direct causal connection. It has been argued{{By whom?|date=August 2012}} that prebiotics are beneficial to Crohn's disease through production of SCFAs to nourish the colon walls, and beneficial to ulcerative colitis through reduction of hydrogen sulfide gas due to reduction of sulfate-producing bacteria, which do not thrive in the slightly acidic environment SCFAs create.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The immediate addition of substantial quantities of prebiotics to the diet may result in an increase in gas, bloating or bowel movement. It has been argued{{By whom?|date=August 2012}} that chronically low consumption of prebiotic-containing foods in the typical [[Western diet]] may exaggerate this effect.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
