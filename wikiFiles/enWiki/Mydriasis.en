'''Mydriasis''' {{IPAc-en|m|i-|ˈ|d|r|aɪ|.|ə|s|ɪ|s|}} is a [[Pupillary dilation|dilation]] of the [[pupil]], usually defined as when having a non-physiological cause,<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mydriasis Mydriasis] in Farlex medical dictionary. In turn citing:
*The American Heritage® Medical Dictionary. Copyright 2007
*Mosby's Dental Dictionary, 2nd edition.</ref> but sometimes defined as potentially being a physiological [[pupillary response]].<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mydriasis Mydriasis] in Farlex medical dictionary. In turn citing: Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.</ref> Non-physiological causes of mydriasis include [[disease]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or the use of [[drug]]s. Normally, the pupil dilates in the [[dark]] and [[constriction|constricts]] in the [[light]] to respectively improve vividity at night and to protect the [[retina]] from sunlight damage during the day. A ''mydriatic'' pupil will remain excessively large even in a bright environment. The excitation of the radial fibres of the iris which increases the pupillary aperture is referred to as a mydriasis. More generally, mydriasis also refers to the natural dilation of pupils, for instance in low light conditions or under sympathetic stimulation. 

An informal term for mydriasis is '''blown pupil''',<ref name=AANS>{{cite web|title=Traumatic Brain Injury|url=http://www.aans.org/Patient%20Information/Conditions%20and%20Treatments/Traumatic%20Brain%20Injury.aspx|publisher=American Association of Neurological Surgeons|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> and is used by medical providers. It is usually used to refer to a fixed, unilateral mydriasis, which could be a symptom of raised [[intracranial pressure]].

The opposite, constriction of the pupil, is referred to as [[miosis]]. Both mydriasis and miosis can be physiological. [[Anisocoria]] is the condition of one pupil being more dilated than the other.

==Mechanism==
There are two types of [[muscle]] that control the size of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]: the iris [[Iris sphincter muscle|sphincter]], composed of circularly arranged muscle fibers, and the iris [[Iris dilator muscle|dilator]], composed of radially arranged muscle fibers. The former is [[innervate]]d by the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]; the latter by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Sympathetic stimulation of the [[adrenergic receptors]] causes the  [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of the [[radial muscle]] and subsequent dilation of the pupil. Conversely, parasympathetic stimulation causes contraction of the circular muscle and constriction of the pupil. 

The mechanism of mydriasis depends on the agent being used. It usually involves either a disruption of the [[parasympathetic nerve]] supply to the eye (which normally constricts the pupil) or overactivity of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS).

==Causes==
===Effects===
Natural release of the hormone [[oxytocin]] can cause mild to moderate mydriasis. Strong [[sexual arousal]] can often lead to very enlarged pupils, rather than the minor dilation observed during sexual affection. [[Orgasm]] has been reported to lead to pupillary block<ref>{{Citation

Here the parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation lead to sphincter muscle stimulation during pupillary dilation in the dark, while ciliary contraction caused zonular relaxation leading to pupillary block and angle-closure in combination with pre-existing narrow [[Anterior chamber|chamber angle]].

===Autonomic neuropathy===
The [[parasympathetic]] nervous supply, which causes constriction of the pupil, or [[miosis]], is supplied by [[cranial nerve]] III, the [[oculomotor nerve]]. Damage to this nerve typically manifests itself as mydriasis, because the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] supply to the pupil, which causes mydriasis, remains unaffected, and therefore unopposed.

Multiple [[central nervous system]] disorders e.g. [[epilepsy]], [[stroke]], and impending [[brain herniation]] are known to lead to temporal mydriasis as well. A brain catastrophe, or a rapidly increasing brain mass, can cause compression of the oculomotor nerve.

===Traumatic===
[[Image:Eye dilate.gif|thumb|250px|right|Pupillary response.]]
In cases of [[head injury]] or [[eye injury|orbit trauma (eye injury)]], the [[Iris sphincter muscle|iris sphincter]] (the muscle responsible for closing the pupil) or the nerves controlling it can be damaged, reducing or eliminating [[pupillary light reflex|consensual]] reactivity to light.

===Drugs===
[[Anticholinergic]]s such as [[atropine]], [[hyoscyamine]], and [[scopolamine]] antagonize the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s in the eye. By blocking these receptors, the pupils are no longer capable of constriction and dilation results.  Such [[alkaloids]] present in many plants of the family ''[[Solanaceae]]'' may also induce mydriasis when used recreationally{{mcn|date=January 2013}} 

[[Serotonergic psychedelic]]s such as [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], and [[mescaline]] all produce mydriasis by agonizing to the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]]s in the brain. [[Dissociative]]s such as [[ketamine]], [[dextromethorphan|DXM]], and [[phencyclidine|PCP]] do so as well via antagonism of the [[NMDAR|NMDA]] glutamate receptors. There have also been reports that the ''atypical'' psychedelic ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' and its active constituent [[salvinorin A]] causes mydriasis. It works via agonism of the [[kappa-Opioid|κ-opioid]] receptors in the brain. How the neurological changes induced by these drugs ultimately causes pupil dilation is unknown.

Drugs that increase overall [[serotonin]] levels in general are capable of causing mydriasis in the same way as the 5-HT2A-mediated psychedelics. This is because serotonin itself is naturally responsible for normal 5-HT2A stimulation. Hence, in sufficient quantities serotonin is mydriatic and can even be mildly psychedelic, though the potentially fatal [[serotonin syndrome]] usually ensues before the psychedelia becomes overly-pronounced. Examples of such drugs include [[MDMA]] (as well as other [[MDxx]] compounds), [[fenfluramine]], [[chlorphentermine]], [[stimulants]] (including [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]]), and some [[antidepressants]] (such as [[SSRIs]], [[Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRI]]s, and [[MAOI]]s).  Natural serotonin-boosting supplements such as [[L-Tryptophan]] and [[5-HTP]] are also capable of this, but usually only in excessive doses.

The [[neurotransmitter]] [[norepinephrine]] regulates many physiological processes in the body and brain. One of them is the autonomic constriction and contraction of certain muscles. The psychoactive drug [[cocaine]] potently inhibits the normal [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|reuptake of norepinephrine]] into [[Chemical synapse|presynaptic nerve terminals]], resulting in an increased level of [[extracellular]] norepinephrine. [[Amphetamines]] also potently release and prevent the reuptake of norepinephrine. The released norepinephrine then proceeds to bind to [[Adrenergic receptor|adrenergic]] receptors, and the biological effects of norepinephrine finally occur. When a solution of cocaine is dropped into the eye, this process takes place and the end result is dilation of the pupil. Cocaine itself is not typically used for this task, however. Any potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor or release agent should be capable of such an effect.

[[Opioids]] such as [[morphine]] and [[heroin]] do ''not'' cause pupil dilation. Instead they cause [[miosis]] (pupil contraction). Mydriasis occasionally occurs during [[Opioid dependency#Symptoms of withdrawal|opioid rebound and withdrawal]].<ref>http://www.nd.gov.hk/chapter_4b2_eng.pdf</ref>

===Mydriatics===
[[Image:Dilated pupil.gk.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pupil dilated using the [[anticholinergic]] drug [[tropicamide]].]]
A '''mydriatic''' is an agent that induces [[Pupillary dilation|dilation]] of the [[pupil]]. Drugs such as [[tropicamide]] are used in [[medicine]] to permit examination of the [[retina]] and other deep structures of the eye, and also to reduce painful [[ciliary muscle]] [[muscle spasm|spasm]] (see [[cycloplegia]]). [[Phenylephrine]] (e.g. Cyclomydril<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pro/cyclomydril.html Cyclomydril]</ref>) is used if strong mydriasis is needed for a surgical intervention.<ref>"Common eye diseases and their management", Galloway/Amoako/Browning, Springer science 2006, 3rd edition, p196</ref> One effect of administration of a mydriatic is intolerance to bright light ([[Photophobia]]). Purposely-induced mydriasis via mydriatics is also used as a [[diagnostic test]] for [[Horner's Syndrome]].
