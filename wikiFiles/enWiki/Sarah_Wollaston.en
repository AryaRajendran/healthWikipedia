'''Sarah Wollaston''' (born 17 February 1962) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[general practitioner]] and politician who has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Totnes]] for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]]. She was selected as a candidate to follow the retiring MP [[Anthony Steen]] through an '[[open primary]]' in which the Conservative Party posted ballot papers to every voter in the constituency. 

Wollaston has portrayed herself as a politician who has worked a "real job", and has campaigned for restrictions on alcohol sales to combat alcohol-related crime.

==Family and early life==
Wollaston was born in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]], and moved frequently in her early life as her father Ken was serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] and was posted to different bases.

==Totnes selection==
{{Main|Totnes Conservative primary, 2009}}
Wollaston joined the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 2006,<ref name="Class of 2010" /> having been spurred into politics by her opposition to the threatened closure of [[Moretonhampstead]] Community Hospital.<ref>"Three candidates for pioneering public vote are named", ''Western Morning News'', 15 July 2009, p. 3.</ref> However Wollaston accepted that she had "no background in politics" when in 2009 she put her name forward for the selection of a candidate for the [[Totnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Totnes]] constituency, citing as qualifications "only real life experience, approachability and enthusiasm".<ref name="Choosing">"Choosing your Tory candidate", ''Herald Express'', 23 July 2009, p. 10.</ref> The Conservative Association placed her on the shortlist of three to succeed [[Anthony Steen]], who had announced his retirement after criticism as part of the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal]] in 2009; the Conservatives had already decided that the selection would be made by an 'open primary' in which non-members would have a vote.<ref>Allan Tudor, "Party workers backing under-fire Teign MP", ''Herald Express'', 2 June 2009, p. 6.</ref> On 9 July the Conservative Party leader [[David Cameron]] announced that the party would, for the first time, send a postal ballot paper to every voter instead of holding the selection at an open meeting.<ref>Steve Peacock, "
Voters will choose new Tory candidate", ''Herald Express'', 10 July 2009, p. 5.</ref>

During the selection process, Wollaston campaigned on the problems of alcohol-related crime, citing also the 8,000 annual deaths from alcohol.<ref name="Choosing" /> She later supported curbs on low priced alcoholic drinks.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/8386096.stm Call for 50p-per-unit alcohol tax]</ref> Wollaston said that she might not have put her name forward had she known that the selection was to be by open primary,<ref>Olivier Vergnault, "Tories face 400 voters in first open primary", ''Western Morning News'', 27 July 2009, p. 8.</ref> but highlighted that the selection offered voters a choice between a career politician and "someone with a real job".<ref>Louise Vennells, "All constituents can select new Tory candidate", ''Western Morning News'', 25 July 2009, p. 11.</ref> At a public hustings, she was asked whether her lack of political experience would make it difficult for her to throw and take political punches; she replied that this was not what politics was about for her, and that she would not indulge in it. Her reply prompted spontaneous applause.<ref>[[Matthew Parris]], "It's queer, this letter from Coutts", ''The Times'', 30 July 2009, p. 22; "I am proud to have joined the Totnes Tories in a pioneering political evening", ''The Spectator'', 1 August 2009.</ref>

The primary was conducted under the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] ("first past the post") method used in national elections. In the selection result, Wollaston was proclaimed the winner with 7,914 votes (48%), ahead of Sara Randall Johnson (leader of [[East Devon]] District Council) who had 5,495 (33%), and [[Nick Bye]] (Mayor of [[Torbay]]) who had 3,088 (19%). Nearly a quarter of all voters returned their ballots, a higher turnout than was expected.<ref>Louise Vennells, "Doctor victorious in historic public vote", ''Western Morning News'', 5 August 2009, p. 5.</ref>

==Parliament==
As the general election approached, Wollaston made clear her anger at suggestions that she would be a part-time MP, saying that she would not continue her medical practice if elected. The local Liberal Democrats denied that they were behind rumours that Wollaston intended to continue to practice part-time.<ref>"'I won't be a part-time MP' vows GP running for election", ''Western Morning News'', 10 March 2010, p. 8.</ref> She accepted that the scandal over Anthony Steen's expenses claims had damaged the Conservative Party's chances,<ref>"Tory candidate admits fears over expenses", ''Western Morning News'', 16 April 2010, p. 5.</ref> and declined his offer of the use of his home to run the Conservative campaign.<ref>"Election Diary", ''Western Morning News'', 19 April 2010, p. 6.</ref> She pledged to vote in a [[eurosceptic]] direction and to support a bypass for [[Kingskerswell]].<ref>Constituency profile, ''Herald Express'', 29 April 2010, p. 7.</ref>

On election day, Wollaston was elected with a majority more than double the previous election.<ref>"'Rollercoaster' campaign doubles majority", ''Herald Express'', 8 May 2010, p. 3.</ref> She supported the formation of a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government as being the most appropriate for her constituency in the circumstances after the election,<ref>Matt Chorley, "Cameron leads first coalition for 70 years", ''Western Morning News'', 12 May 2010, p. 1.</ref> explaining that voters wanted to see politicians working together.<ref>Tina Crowson, "Parties reject truce plea", ''Herald Express'', 13 May 2010, p. 1.</ref> Her [[maiden speech]] on 2 June further outlined her concerns about alcohol-related crime and alcoholic drink pricing, and also mentioned issues of concern in her constituency including [[bovine tuberculosis]].<ref>"New MP targets cheap alcohol and badgers in maiden speech", ''Herald Express'', 4 June 2010, p. 5.</ref>

In July, Wollaston referred to her experience working with sexual assault victims in warning the Government against its plans to introduce anonymity for people suspected of or charged with rape. She argued that it would constitute a "further barrier" for victims to report their crime and that the vast majority of sexual assaults already went unreported.<ref>Francis Elliott, "Tory women MPs attack rape suspect anonymity plan", ''The Times'', 9 July 2010, p. 8.</ref> She successfully pressed the Government to take up the way the [[European Union]]'s [[Working Time Directive]] applied to junior doctors' training, saying that it was causing patient care to suffer.<ref>Rebecca Smith, Robert Winnett, "EU law harming doctors' training", ''The Daily Telegraph'', 8 September 2010, p. 1.</ref> Wollaston declared in October 2010 that she would not vote to repeal the [[Hunting Act 2004]] because "the overwhelming majority" in her constituency were opposed to hunting.<ref>Owen Bowcott, "Countryside Alliance outfoxed by new generation of Tory MPs", ''The Guardian'', 29 October 2010, p. 20.</ref>

Wollaston broke the Conservative whip in November 2010 to support an amendment setting a threshold of 40% turnout for the result of the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|referendum on voting systems]] to be valid,<ref>Division 109. ''[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101102/debtext/101102-0003.htm#101102101000691 Hansard]'', HC 6ser vol 517 col 855.</ref> and later that month supported a Labour amendment to allow more policyholders to claim compensation over the collapse in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Equitable Life]] dividends.<ref>Division 114. ''[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101102/debtext/101102-0003.htm#101102101000691 Hansard]'', HC 6ser vol 518 col 323.</ref>

In March 2011, Wollaston warned [[David Cameron]] that the NHS reforms would result in the NHS going "belly up."<ref name=belly>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8392556/David-Camerons-health-reforms-risk-destroying-the-NHS-says-Tory-doctor.html|title=David Cameron's health reforms risk destroying the NHS, says Tory doctor 
|author=[[Melissa Kite]]|publisher=Sunday Telegraph|date=20 March 2011|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref> Wollaston warned that the reorganisation would result in confusion with doctors being overwhelmed. She said there was a risk that [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]], the new regulator would be filled with "competition economists" who would change the NHS beyond recognitition.<ref name= belly/>  There was no point  'liberating' the NHS from political control only to shackle it to an unelected economic regulator.<ref name= belly/> However, her opposition to the NHS reforms calmed after party leadership changed certain clauses at her suggestions.
