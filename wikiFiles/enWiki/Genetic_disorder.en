A '''genetic disorder''' is an [[illness]] caused by one or more [[Chromosome abnormality|abnormalities in the genome]], especially a condition that is present from birth ([[congenital]]).  Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions. 

Genetic disorders are [[heritable]], and are passed down from the parents' genes. Other defects may be caused by new [[mutation]]s or changes to the DNA. In such cases, the defect will only be heritable if it occurs in the [[germ line]]. The same [[disease]], such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and by nongenetic causes in still other people.  

Some types of [[recessive gene]] disorders confer an [[Heterozygote advantage|advantage in certain environments]] when only one copy of the gene is present.<ref>[http://www.teachersdomain.org/resources/tdc02/sci/life/gen/lp_disorder/index.html WGBH Educational Foundation]</ref>

A '''single gene disorder''' is the result of a single [[mutation|mutated]] gene. Over 4000 human diseases are caused by single gene defects. Single gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. [[Genomic imprinting]] and [[uniparental disomy]], however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive and dominant]] types are not "hard and fast", although the divisions between [[autosome|autosomal]] and [[Sex linkage|X-linked]] types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, [[achondroplasia]] is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes  for achondroplasia have a severe skeletal disorder of which achondroplasics could be viewed as carriers. [[Sickle-cell anemia]] is also considered a recessive condition, but [[Zygosity#Heterozygous|heterozygous]] carriers have increased resistance to [[malaria]] in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition.<ref name="Williams">{{cite journal | author = Williams T.

===Autosomal dominant===
{{Main|Autosomal dominant#Autosomal dominant gene}}
Only one mutated copy of the gene will be necessary for a person to be affected by an autosomal dominant disorder. Each affected person usually has one affected parent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Anthony J.F.|title=Introduction to Genetic Analysis|year=2012|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-2943-8|pages=57|author=Griffiths, Anthony J.F.|edition=10|coauthors=Wessler, Susan R., Carroll, Sean B., Doebley, John|chapter=2}}</ref>  The chance a child will inherit the mutated gene is 50%.  Autosomal dominant conditions sometimes have reduced [[penetrance]], which means although only one mutated copy is needed, not all individuals who inherit that mutation go on to develop the disease.  Examples of this type of disorder are [[Huntington's disease]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Anthony J.F.|title=Introduction to Genetic Analysis|year=2012|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-2943-8|pages=58|author=Griffiths, Anthony J.F.|edition=10|coauthors=Wessler, Susan R., Carroll, Sean B., Doebley, John}}</ref>  [[neurofibromatosis type 1]], [[neurofibromatosis type 2]], [[Marfan syndrome]], [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]], and [[hereditary multiple exostoses]], which is a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder. Birth defects are also called congenital anomalies.

===Autosomal recessive===
{{Main|Autosomal dominant#Autosomal recessive allele}}
Two copies of the gene must be mutated for a person to be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder. An affected person usually has unaffected parents who each carry a single copy of the mutated gene (and are referred to as carriers). Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene have a 25% chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. Examples of this type of disorder are [[cystic fibrosis]], [[sickle-cell disease]], [[Tay-Sachs disease]], [[Niemann-Pick disease]], [[spinal muscular atrophy]], and [[Roberts syndrome]].  Certain other phenotypes, such as wet versus dry [[earwax]], are also determined in an autosomal recessive fashion.<ref name=Wade>{{ cite journal  | author= Wade, Nicholas  | title=Japanese Scientists Identify Ear Wax Gene  | journal=New York Times | date= January 29, 2006 }}</ref><ref name=Yoshiura>{{cite journal |author=Yoshiura K, Kinoshita A, Ishida T, ''et al.'' |title=A SNP in the ABCC11 gene is the determinant of human earwax type |journal=Nat.

===X-linked dominant===
{{Main|X-linked dominant}}
X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the [[X chromosome]]. Only a few disorders have this inheritance pattern, with a prime example being [[X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets]].  Males and females are both affected in these disorders, with males typically being more severely affected than females.  Some X-linked dominant conditions, such as [[Rett syndrome]], [[incontinentia pigmenti]] type 2 and [[Aicardi syndrome]], are usually fatal in males either ''in utero'' or shortly after birth, and are therefore predominantly seen in females.  Exceptions to this finding are extremely rare cases in which boys with [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (47,XXY) also inherit an X-linked dominant condition and exhibit symptoms more similar to those of a female in terms of disease severity.  The chance of passing on an X-linked dominant disorder differs between men and women.  The sons of a man with an X-linked dominant disorder will all be unaffected (since they receive their father's Y chromosome), and his daughters will all inherit the condition. A woman with an X-linked dominant disorder has a 50% chance of having an affected fetus with each pregnancy, although it should be noted that in cases such as incontinentia pigmenti, only female offspring are generally viable.  In addition, although these conditions do not alter fertility ''per se'', individuals with Rett syndrome or Aicardi syndrome rarely reproduce.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===X-linked recessive===
{{Main|X-linked recessive}}
X-linked recessive conditions are also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected than females, and the chance of passing on the disorder differs between men and women. The sons of a man with an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene.  A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder (X<sup>R</sup>X<sup>r</sup>) has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene and are therefore carriers.  X-linked recessive conditions include the serious diseases [[hemophilia A]], [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], and [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]], as well as common and less serious conditions such as [[Androgenic alopecia|male pattern baldness]] and  red-green [[color blindness]].  X-linked recessive conditions can sometimes manifest in females due to [[skewed X-inactivation]] or [[Turner syndrome|monosomy X (Turner syndrome)]].

===Y-linked===
{{Main|Y linkage}}
Y-linked disorders are caused by mutations on the Y chromosome.  Because males inherit a Y chromosome from their fathers, every son of an affected father will be affected.  Because females only inherit an X chromosome from their fathers, and never a Y chromosome, female offspring of affected fathers are never affected.

Since the Y chromosome is relatively small and contains very few genes, relatively few Y-linked disorders occur.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  Often, the symptoms include infertility, which may be circumvented with the help of some fertility treatments. Examples are [[infertility|male infertility]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Mitochondrial===
{{Main|Mitochondrial disease}}
This type of inheritance, also known as maternal inheritance, applies to genes in [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Because only egg cells contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only mothers can pass on mitochondrial conditions to their children. An example of this type of disorder is [[Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy]].

==Multifactorial and polygenic (complex) disorders==

Genetic disorders may also be complex, multifactorial, or polygenic, meaning they are likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyles and environmental factors. Multifactorial disorders include [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, they do not have a clear-cut pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person’s risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified.

On a pedigree, polygenic diseases do tend to "run in families", but the inheritance does not fit simple patterns as with [[Mendelian]] diseases.  But this does not mean that the genes cannot eventually be located and studied.  There is also a strong environmental component to many of them (e.g., blood pressure).
