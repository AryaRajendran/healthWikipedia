Triflin is a toxin derived from snake venom. The toxin is produced in the gland of the Habu snake, ''[[Trimeresurus flavoviridis]]''.<ref name=pmid15953617/>

== Chemistry ==
Triflin is a cysteine-rich secretory protein, which means it belongs to the CRISP family.  This is a group of single chain polypeptides found in various organisms.
Triflin weighs 25 kDa and consists of 221 [[Amino acids|amino-acid]] residues. 
The first 163 residues of the [[N-terminal]] domain forms an α-β-α sandwich core. This domain is comparable with group 1 plant [[pathogenesis-related protein]] (PR-1).
The [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] domain, has five [[Disulfide bond|disulfide bridges]]. This domain is responsible for the selectivity of the protein and consists of two subdomains: N-terminal subdomain (Cys 167 to Cys 179) and C-terminal subdomain (42 amino-acids residues).
The N-terminal subdomain is connected with N-terminal domain through two main-chain [[hydrogen bond]]s between β11 and β2 and is thereby part of the PR-1 domain. 
The C-terminal subdomain is stabilized by three disulfide bridges and it is remarkable that this domain does not interact with either the PR-1 domain or the N-terminal sub-domain. The C-terminal subdomain consists of particles, including some hydrophobic residues that are exposed to the solvent. These hydrophobic residues might mediate the interaction with the target proteins and therefore receptor recognition.<ref name=pmid15953617/>

There are some homologous toxins to Triflin with different percentages of amino-acid sequence similarity, such as [[Ablomin]], [[Latisemin]], Stecrip (88%), Helothermine (49%),<ref name=pmid12047379/> Pseudechetoxin (62%), Pseudesin (61%).<ref name=pmid16511147>{{cite journal |author=N, Suzuki |year=2005 |last2=Yamazaki |first2=Y |last3=Fujimoto |first3=Z |last4=Morita |first4=T |last5=Mizuno |first5=H |title= Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analyses of pseudechetoxin and pseudecin, two snake-venom cysteine-rich secretory proteins that target cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels|journal=Acta Crystallogr F |volume=61 |issue=Pt 8|pages=750–752|pmid=16511147 |pmc=1952345 |doi=10.1107/S1744309105020439}}</ref> The snake venoms which belong to CRISP family seem to be homologous to each other, however there are differences in their protein targets.<ref name=pmid15953617/>

== Target ==
Triflin reduces high potassium induced smooth muscle contraction, suggesting a blocking effect on [[L-type calcium channel]]s.<ref name=pmid12047379/>

== Treatment ==
One of the small serum proteins (SSP-2), a substance produced by ''[[Trimeresurus flavoviridis]]'' itself, has high affinity for Triflin, and may thus work as a defensive mechanism against accidental self-poisoning, suggesting a possible role for SSP-2 as an antidote to triflin.<ref name=pmid17543280>{{cite journal |last1=Aoki |first1=N |last2=Sakiyama |first2=A |last3=Deshimaru |first3=M |last4=Terada |first4=S |title=Identification of novel serum proteins in a Japanese viper: homologs of mammalian PSP94 |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=359 |issue=2 |pages=330–4 |year=2007 |pmid=17543280 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.05.091}}</ref>
