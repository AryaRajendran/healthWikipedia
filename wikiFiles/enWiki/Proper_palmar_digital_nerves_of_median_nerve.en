In the palm of the [[hand]] the [[median nerve]] is covered by the skin and the [[palmar aponeurosis]], and rests on the tendons of the [[Flexor muscles]]. Immediately after emerging from under the [[transverse carpal ligament]] the [[median nerve]] becomes enlarged and flattened and splits into a smaller, lateral, and a larger, medial portion. 

The ''lateral portion'' supplies a short, stout branch to certain of the muscles of the ball of the [[thumb]], viz., the [[Abductor brevis]], the [[Opponens]], and the superficial head of the [[Flexor brevis]], and then divides into three '''proper palmar digital nerves of median nerve''' ('''proper volar digital nerves'''):

* two of these supply the sides of the thumb, 
* while the third gives a twig to the first [[Lumbricalis]] and is distributed to the radial side of the index finger.

It also divides into two common palmar digital nerves:

* The first of these divides into two proper digital nerves for the adjoining sides of the [[index finger|index]] and [[middle finger]]s; 

* the second common palmar digital nerve splits into two proper digital nerves for the adjoining sides of the third and forth digits; 

Each '''proper digital nerve''', opposite the base of the first phalanx, gives off a dorsal branch which joins the [[dorsal digital nerve]] from the [[superficial branch of the radial nerve]], and supplies the [[integument]] on the dorsal aspect of the last phalanx. 

At the end of the digit, the proper digital nerve divides into two branches, 
* one of which supplies the pulp of the finger, 
* the other ramifies around and beneath the nail. 

The proper digital nerves, as they run along the fingers, are placed superficial to the corresponding arteries.
