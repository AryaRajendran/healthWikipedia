'''Harrison (Hap) Farber''' is currently Professor of Medicine and Director of the [[Pulmonary Hypertension]] Center at [[Boston University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bumc.bu.edu/pulmonary/people/faculty/harrisonfarber/ |title=Harrison W. Farber, M.D. |publisher=Boston University School of Medicine |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref>

He attended undergraduate at [[Duke University]] before moving to [[Belgium]] and became a member of the Belgium cycling team. He then went on to attend medical school at [[George Washington University]] and entered into residency at the [[Medical College of Virginia]]. He completed a fellowship in pulmonary and critical care medicine at Boston University and Boston City Hospital Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scleroderma.org/national_conference/2010/farber.htm |title=About Harrison Farber, M.D |publisher=Scleroderma Foundation |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref>  Dr. Farber completed an additional research year at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in basic science.  At present, Dr. Farber is a Professor in the Department of Medicine and attends in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and on the Pulmonary Consultation Service at [[Boston Medical Center]]. He also oversees the care of all patients with Pulmonary Hypertension at Boston Medical Center.<ref name="Wachter(MD.)2005">{{cite book|author1=Robert M.

Dr. Farber’s research focuses on the response of the pulmonary vasculature (''the disposition or arrangement of blood vessels in an organ or part''<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/vasculature http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/vasculature]</ref>) to injury and [[endothelial]] cell biology. He has extensive government and private funding. He is a member of several research groups both within the Pulmonary Center and in other divisions within the Department of Medicine: the Pulmonary Vascular Biology Group (Pulmonary Center); the Center for Excellence in Sickle Cell Disease (Hematology), the Scleroderma Vascular Disease Group ([[Rheumatology]]) and Pulmonary Vascular/Left [[Ventricle (heart)|Ventricular]] Study Group ([[Cardiology]]). Dr. Farber’s laboratory is investigating the response of the pulmonary vasculature in different [[etiologies]] of pulmonary hypertension using genomic and proteomic approaches to identify unique molecules as potential targets for new therapies for pulmonary [[hypertension]] associated.

Farber is not only a doctor. He is also a keen athlete and has covered a lot of distance in his running career. Originally a distance cyclist, he got hooked on [[triathlon]]s about 20 years ago, completing his first [[marathon]] in 1983 at the end of an [[Ironman Triathlon|ironman]]-length triathlon on [[Cape Cod]]. Since then he's ticked off about 45 marathons, a few [[ultramarathon]]s (50 miles), numerous triathlons, and the [[Vermont]] 100-miler. In 2004, Farber and nine other ultradistance runners ran a combined 3,372 miles from [[San Francisco]] to [[Boston]] in 24 days to raise money for five local children's charities.
