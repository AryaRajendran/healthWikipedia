The '''Monell Chemical Senses Center''' is a non-profit independent scientific institute located at the [[University City Science Center]] research campus in [[Philadelphia]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. Monell conducts and publishes interdisciplinary basic research on taste, smell, and chemesthesis (chemically mediated skin senses, such as the burn of [[capsaicin]] or the tingle of carbonation). 

==Overview==
Founded in 1968, the center's mission is to advance knowledge of the mechanisms and functions of the chemical senses to benefit human health and well-being. Knowledge gained from Monell’s basic research provides insight and solutions for issues related to public health, national health policy, and quality of life, including studies of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, pediatric health, occupational safety, environmental interactions, and homeland security.

Monell has a scientific staff of more than 50 Ph.D.-level scientists. Situated in the academic heart of Philadelphia’s University City Science Center, the center occupies two buildings with a total of {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}}.  The institute is operated as a non-profit organization and receives funding from government grants, primarily from the National Institutes of Health through the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, as well as from foundations and unrestricted corporate sponsorships.

==Leadership==
Gary K. Beauchamp was appointed in 1990 as the center's second Director, a position he holds today.  Dwight Riskey is Board Chair. Many eminent scientists, academicians and business executives have served the center as board members and members of advisory committees.
