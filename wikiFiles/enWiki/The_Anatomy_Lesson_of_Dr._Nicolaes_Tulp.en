'''''The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp''''' is a 1632 [[oil painting]] by [[Rembrandt]] housed in the [[Mauritshuis]] museum in [[The Hague]], the [[Netherlands]]. Dr. [[Nicolaes Tulp]] is pictured explaining the [[muscle|musculature]] of the [[arm]] to medical professionals. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid commissions to be included in the painting. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner ''Rembrant. f[ecit] 1632''. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogramme ''RHL'' (Rembrant Harmenszoon of [[Leiden]]), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.

The event can be dated to 16 January 1632: the [[Amsterdam]] Guild of [[Surgeon]]s, of which Tulp was official City Anatomist, permitted only one public [[dissection]] a year, and the body would have to be that of an executed criminal.<ref name="Rachlin">{{cite book|last=Rachlin|first=Harvey |title=Scandals, Vandals and Da Vincis|publisher=Chrysalis Books|year=2007|pages=55&ndash;61|isbn=978-1-86105-878-2|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3VoL3-rMmZQC&pg=PA55}}</ref>

[[Anatomy]] lessons were a social event in the 17th century, taking place in lecture rooms that were actual [[theatre]]s, with students, colleagues and the general public being permitted to attend on payment of an entrance fee. The spectators are appropriately dressed for a solemn social occasion. It is thought that the uppermost (not holding the paper) and farthest left figures  were added to the picture later.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaney|first=Samuel R.|title=Silent Interviews: On Language, Race, Sex, Science Fiction, and Some Comics--A Collection of Written Interviews|year=2011|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=98|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0alRH-n1SpYC&pg=PA98&dq=%22Adriaan+Adriaanszoon%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rC5nUYumJo31iQKdi4GACQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Adriaan%20Adriaanszoon%22&f=false}}</ref> 

One person is missing: the Preparator, whose task it was to prepare the body for the lesson. In the 17th century an important [[scientist]] such as Dr. Tulp would not be involved in menial and bloody work like [[dissection]], and such tasks would be left to others. It is for this reason that the picture shows no cutting instruments. Instead we see in the lower right corner an enormous open [[textbook]] on anatomy, possibly the 1543 ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''Fabric of the Human Body'') by [[Vesalius|Andreas Vesalius]].

Medical specialists have commented on the accuracy of [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s painted by the 26-year-old Rembrandt. It is not known where he obtained such knowledge; it is possible that he copied the details from an anatomical textbook. However, in 2006 Dutch researchers recreated the scene with a male cadaver, revealing several discrepancies of the exposed left forearm compared to that of a real corpse.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = F.

It is the common extensor origin that originates at the lateral epicondyle.

==The corpse==
The corpse is that of the criminal Aris Kindt (alias of Adriaan Adriaanszoon), who was convicted for armed robbery and sentenced to [[Capital punishment|death]] by hanging. He was [[Strangling#Ligature strangulation|strangled]] earlier on the same day of the scene.<ref name="carnal_art">{{cite book|last=O'Bryan|first=C. Jil|title=Carnal Art |publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2005|pages=64&ndash;67|isbn=978-0-8166-4322-6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x1KEO_H34EcC&pg=PA64}}</ref> The face of the corpse is partially shaded,<ref name="Rachlin" /> a suggestion of ''umbra mortis'' (shadow of death), a technique that Rembrandt was to use frequently.

The French art historian Jean-Marie Clarke points out that the navel of the corpse has the shape of a capital R and connects this observation to the fact that Rembrandt worked intensively on his signatures in 1632, using three types consecutively before settling on the final, first name form in 1633.<ref>Michiel Koolbergen, "De R van Rembrandt. Waarheen wijst de tang van dokter Tulp?" ''Trouw'', 31 January 1992, 13; this article appeared on the 360th anniversary of the original anatomy lesson by Dr. Tulp.

Kindt was discussed in the 1999 novel ''[[The Rings of Saturn]]'' by [[W. G. Sebald]], and plays a significant role in [[Laird Hunt]]'s 2006 novel ''The Exquisite''.

Deijman was Tulp's immediate successor in the post of praelector chirugic et anatomie. The painting was damaged by fire in 1723, and only a central fragment survives.

Around 1856 [[Édouard Manet]] visited The Hague and made a small [[oil sketch|oil on panel]] copy of ''The Anatomy Lesson''. Broadly painted in a limited palette, Manet gave the painting to his physician, Dr. Siredey.<ref>''Christie's Impressionist & Nineteenth Century Art''. Catalog, p. 62, 24 June 1988.</ref>

''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' of 1875 and ''[[The Agnew Clinic]]'' of 1889 are paintings by the American artist [[Thomas Eakins]] which treat a similar subject, operations on live patients in the presence of medical students.

In 2010, Yiull Damaso created a [[parody]] of the painting depicting prominent [[South Africa]]ns. [[Nelson Mandela]] was the cadaver, [[Nkosi Johnson]] was the instructor, and the students were [[Desmond Tutu]], [[F.

The 2011 videogame [[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]] references the painting in both in-game portraits that can be found on the wall and in a certain cinematic trailer, featuring the main protagonist Adam Jensen as the cadaver as Dr. Nicolaes and his students study his charred and ruined arms, which in the actual story become amputated and replaced with mechanical limbs.
