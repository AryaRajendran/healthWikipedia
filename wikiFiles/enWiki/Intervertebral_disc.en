'''Intervertebral discs''' (or '''intervertebral fibrocartilage''') lie between adjacent [[vertebra]]e in the [[vertebral column|spine]]. Each disc forms a cartilaginous [[joint]] to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a [[ligament]] to hold the vertebrae together.

==Structure==
Discs consist of an outer ''[[annulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis|annulus fibrosus]]'', which surrounds the inner ''[[nucleus pulposus]]''. The ''annulus fibrosus'' consists of several layers of [[fibrocartilage]].  The strong annular fibers contain the ''nucleus pulposus'' and distribute pressure evenly across the disc.  The ''nucleus pulposus'' contains loose fibers suspended in a mucoprotein gel with the consistency of [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]].  The nucleus of the disc acts as a shock absorber, absorbing the impact of the body's daily activities and keeping the two vertebrae separated. The disc can be likened to a jelly doughnut: whereby the annulus fibrosis is similar to the dough and the nucleus pulposis is the jelly. If one presses down on the front of the doughnut the jelly moves posteriorly or to the back. When one develops a [[prolapsed disc]] the jelly/nucleus pulposus is forced out of the doughnut/disc and may put pressure on the nerve located near the disc. This can give one the symptoms of [[sciatica]].

There is one disc between each pair of vertebrae, except for the first cervical segment, the ''[[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]]''. The ''atlas'' is a ring around the roughly cone-shaped extension of the ''[[Axis (anatomy)|axis]]'' (second cervical segment).  The axis acts as a post around which the atlas can rotate, allowing the neck to swivel.  There are 23 discs in the human spine: 6 in the neck (cervical region), 12 in the middle back (thoracic region), and 5 in the lower back (lumbar region). For example, the disc between the fifth and sixth cervical vertabrae is designated "C5-6".

==Medical conditions related to the intervertebral disc==
{{main|Intervertebral disc disorder}}
During development and at birth, vertebral discs have some vascular supply to the cartilage end plates and the annulus fibrosus.  These quickly deteriorate leaving almost no direct blood supply in healthy adults.<ref name=Roberts06>{{cite journal |author=Roberts S, Evans H, Trivedi J, Menage J |title=Histology and pathology of the human intervertebral disc |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=88 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=10–4 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16595436 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.F.00019 |url=http://www.jbjs.org/article.aspx?volume=88%20Suppl%202&page=10}}</ref>
 
Before age 40 approximately 25% of people show evidence of disc degeneration at one or more levels.  Beyond age 40, more than 60% of people show evidence of disc degeneration at one or more levels on a MRI.<ref>{{cite web |title=Intervertebral Disc Disorders |date=1 December 2012 |work=MDGuidelines |publisher=Reed Group |url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/intervertebral-disc-disorders}}</ref>

One effect of aging and disc degeneration is the nucleus pulposus begins to dehydrate and the concentration of proteoglycans in the matrix decreases, thus limiting the ability of the disc to absorb shock.  This general shrinking of disc size is partially responsible for the common decrease in height as humans age.  The annulus fibrosus also becomes weaker with age and has an increased risk of tearing.  In addition, the cartilage end plates begin thinning, fissures begin to form, and there is sclerosis of the subchondral bone.<ref name=Roberts06/>
While this may not cause pain in some people, in others one or both of these may cause chronic pain.  Other spinal disorders can affect the morphology of intervertebral discs.  For example, patients with scoliosis commonly have calcium deposits (ectopic calcification) in the cartilage end plate and sometimes in the disc itself.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giachelli CM |title=Ectopic calcification: gathering hard facts about soft tissue mineralization |journal=Am. J. Pathol. |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=671–5 |year=1999 |month=March |pmid=10079244 |pmc=1866412 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65313-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9440(10)65313-8}}</ref>
Herniate discs are also found to have a higher degree of cellular senescence than non-herniated discs.<ref name=Roberts06/>
