The '''Bristol stool scale''' or '''Bristol stool chart''' is a [[medical]] aid designed to classify the form of [[human faeces]] into seven categories. Sometimes referred to in the UK as the "Meyers scale",<ref>http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=x20100606160645260465</ref> it was developed by Dr. Ken Heaton at the [[University of Bristol]] and was first published in the ''Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology'' in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lewis SJ, Heaton KW |title=Stool form scale as a useful guide to intestinal transit time |journal=Scand.

Gastroenterol. |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=920–4 |year=1997 |pmid=9299672 |doi=10.3109/00365529709011203}}</ref>  The authors of that paper concluded that the form of the stool is a useful surrogate measure of [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] transit time. That conclusion has since been challenged as having limited validity, and only in types 1 and 2 when the subject is not constipated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rao SS, Camilleri M, Hasler WL, Maurer AH, Parkman HP, Saad R, Scott MS, Simren M, Soffer E, Szarka L. |title=Evaluation of gastrointestinal transit in clinical practice: position paper of the American and European Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societies. |journal=Neurogastroenterol Motil. |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=8–23 |year=2011 |pmid=21138500 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2982.2010.01612.x}}</ref> However, it remains in use as a research tool to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for various diseases of the bowel, as well as a clinical communication aid.

The seven types of stool are:
* Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)
* Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy
* Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface
* Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft
* Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily)
* Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool
* Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely liquid

Types 1–2 indicate [[constipation]], with 3 and 4 being the ideal stools (especially the latter), as they are easy to [[Defecation|defecate]] while not containing any excess liquid, and 5, 6 and 7 tending towards <!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF DIARRHOEA, THE BRISTOL STOOL SCALE ORIGINATED IN BRITAIN AND SHOULD THEREFORE ADOPT THE BRITISH SPELLING - SEE WP:ENGVAR -->[[diarrhea|diarrhoea]].

==Limitations==
Assessment of fecal morphology using only the Bristol scale can miss important diagnostic markers of digestive health, and if used on its own, it can mislead in cases of [[keriorrhea]], [[rectal bleeding]], mucus in the rectum, problems in [[bile]] or ingestion of waxy esters, etc.
