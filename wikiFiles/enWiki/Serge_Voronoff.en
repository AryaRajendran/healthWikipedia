'''Serge Abrahamovitch Voronoff''' ({{lang-ru|Сергей Абрамович Воронов}}; c. July 10, 1866 &ndash; September 3, 1951) was a [[France|French]] [[surgeon]] of [[Russian Empire|Russian]] extraction who gained fame for his technique of [[Medical grafting|grafting]] [[monkey]] [[testicle]] tissue on to the testicles of men for purportedly therapeutic purposes while working in France in the 1920s and 1930s. The technique brought him a great deal of money, although he was already independently wealthy. As his work fell out of favour, he went from being highly respected to a subject of ridicule. Other doctors, and the public at large, quickly distanced themselves from Voronoff, pretending they had never had any interest in the grafting techniques. By the time of his death in 1951 at the age of 85, few newspapers noted his passing, and those that did acted as if Voronoff had always been ridiculed for his beliefs. In 1999, some speculated that the [[AIDS]] virus discovered in the 1980s entered the human population through Voronoff's transfer of monkey parts into humans in the 1920s. Presently, however, his efforts and reputation have been somewhat rehabilitated.

==Early life==
Serge (Samuel) Voronoff was born in [[Subbotniks|Subbotnik]] to a Jewish family in a village close to [[Voronezh]] in [[Russia]] shortly before July 10, 1866, the date of his [[circumcision]] in a [[synagogue]]. He emigrated to [[France]] at the age of 18, where he studied [[medicine]]. In 1895 at the age of 29, Voronoff became a [[naturalized]] French citizen. Voronoff was a student of [[French people|French]] surgeon, biologist, [[eugenicist]], and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize recipient]] [[Alexis Carrel]], from whom he learnt surgical techniques of [[Organ transplant|transplantation]]. Between 1896 and 1910, he worked in [[Egypt]], studying the retarding effects that [[castration]] had on [[eunuch]]s, observations that would lead to his later work on [[Rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]].

==Monkey-gland transplant work==
[[Image:Voronoff She Goat.JPG|200px|right|thumb|<center>Pre-1920s doe with grafted testicles.</center>]]
In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, trends in [[xenotransplantation]] included the work of [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]].<ref>Musitelli, S. (June 1, 2004) [http://www.crcjournals.com/pdf/aging-male.asp The Aging Male] ''Welcome born-again Dr Faust!'' Volume 7; Issue 2; Page 170.</ref><ref>Bynum, W. F. (June 30, 2006) [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]] ''Dig for gland of hope and glory;Books;History of science.'' Section: Features; Page 29.</ref> In 1889, Voronoff injected himself under the skin with extracts from ground-up [[dog]] and [[guinea pig]] [[testicle]]s. These experiments failed to produce the desired results of increased hormonal effects to retard aging.

Voronoff's experiments launched from this starting point. He believed glandular transplants would produce more sustained effects than mere injections. Voronoff's early experiments in this field included transplanting [[thyroid gland]]s from [[chimpanzee]]s to humans with thyroid deficiencies. He moved on to transplanting the testicles of executed [[criminal]]s into [[millionaire]]s, but, when demand outstripped supply, he turned to using monkey testicle tissue instead.<ref>Winegar, Karin. (February 5, 1989) ''[[Star Tribune]]'' ''Youth is a disease that time cures. - Goethe.'' Section: Variety; Page 01E.</ref>

In 1917, Voronoff began being funded by Evelyn Bostwick, a wealthy American socialite and the daughter of [[Bostwick family|Jabez Bostwick]].{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=30}} The money allowed him to begin transplantation experiments on animals. Bostwick, also acting as his laboratory assistant at the [[Collège de France]] in Paris, and consequently became the first woman admitted to that institution.{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=29}} They married in 1920.

Between 1917 and 1926, Voronoff carried out over five hundred transplantations on [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s, and also on a [[bull]], grafting testicles from younger animals to older ones. Voronoff's observations indicated that the transplantations caused the older animals to regain the vigor of younger animals.<ref name="Lancet">''[[The Lancet]]'' (November 30, 1991) ''New glands for old.'' Volume 338; Issue 8779; Page 1367. PMID 1682744. {{doi|10.1016/0140-6736(91)92244-V}}.</ref> He also considered monkey-gland transplantation an effective treatment to counter [[senility]].<ref>Sengoopta, Chandak. (September 22, 1993 [[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] ''Rejuvenation and the prolongation of life: science or quackery?'' Volume 37; Issue 1; Page 55.</ref>

His first official transplantation of a monkey gland into a human took place on June 12, 1920.<ref name="Cummings">Gillyboeuf, Thierry. (October 2000) The Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society. ''[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/issue9/Gillybo9.htm The Famous Doctor Who Inserts Monkeyglands in Millionaires.]'' Pg. 44-45.</ref> Thin slices (a few millimetres wide) of testicles from chimpanzees and [[baboon]]s were implanted inside the patient's [[scrotum]], the thinness of the tissue samples allowing the foreign tissue to fuse with the human tissue eventually.<ref name="Cummings"/> By 1923, 700 of the world's leading surgeons at the [[International Congress of Surgeons]] in [[London]], [[England]], applauded the success of Voronoff's work in the "rejuvenation" of old men.<ref>[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine (July 30, 1923) ''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727231-1,00.html Voronoff and Steinach.]''</ref>

In his book ''Rejuvenation by Grafting'' (1925),<ref>Voronoff, Serge. (1925) ''Rejuvenation by grafting.'' Publisher: Adelphi. Translation edited by Fred. F. Imianitoff. ASIN B000OSQH5K</ref> Voronoff describes what he believes are some of the potential effects of his surgery. While "not an aphrodisiac", he admits the sex drive may be improved. Other possible effects include better memory, the ability to work longer hours, the potential for no longer needing glasses (due to improvement of muscles around the eye), and the prolonging of life. Voronoff also speculates that the grafting surgery might be beneficial to people with "dementia praecox", the mental illness known today as [[schizophrenia]].

Voronoff's monkey-gland treatment was in vogue in the 1920s.<ref>Ferris, Paul.

By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated in France by his rejuvenation technique, and thousands more around the world, such as in a special clinic set up in [[Algiers]].<ref>Common, Laura. (April 25, 2000) [[The Medical Post]][http://www.mdpassport.com/] ''Great balls of fire: from prehistory, men have tried implants and extracts from macho animals to cure impotence, but it was only relatively recently that they began to understand why they did so.''</ref> Noteworthy people who had the surgery included [[Harold Fowler McCormick|Harold McCormick]], chairman of the board of [[International Harvester Company]],<ref>Grossman, Ron.

Section: Features; Page 15.</ref>

Voronoff's later work included transplants of monkey [[ovaries]] into women. He also tried the reverse experiment, transplanting a human ovary into a female monkey, and then tried to [[Insemination|inseminate]] the monkey with human [[Spermatozoon|sperm]]. The notoriety of this experiment resulted in the novel ''Nora, la guenon devenue femme'' (''Nora, the Monkey Turned Woman'') by [[Félicien Champsaur]]. In 1934, he was the first to officially recognise scientific work done by Greek Professor [[Skevos Zervos]].

==Falling out of favour==
Voronoff's experiments ended following pressure from a skeptical scientific community and a change in public opinion.<ref>Illman, John. (August 4, 1998) [[Rocky Mountain News]] ''Pre-viagra men given monkey cells in the 1930s, Russian doctor grafted glands.'' Section: News/National/International; Page 26A. (from [[The Observer]]</ref> It became clear that Voronoff's operations did not produce any of the results he claimed.  

In his book ''The Monkey Gland Affair'', David Hamilton, an experienced transplant surgeon, discusses how animal tissue inserted into a human would not be absorbed, but instantly rejected.  At best, it would result in scar tissue, which might fool a person into believing the graft is still in place.  Interestingly, this means the many patients who received the surgery and praised Voronoff were "improved" solely by the [[placebo effect]].

Part of the basis of Voronoff's work was that testicles are glands, much like the thyroid and adrenal glands. Voronoff believed that at some point, scientists would discover what substance the testicular glands secrete, making grafting surgery unnecessary.

Eventually, it was determined that the substance emitted by the testicles is [[testosterone]]. Voronoff expected that this new discovery would prove his theories. Testosterone would be injected into animals and they would grow young, strong, and virile. Experiments were performed, and this was not the case. Besides an increase in some secondary sexual characteristics, testosterone injections did little. Testosterone did not prolong life, as Voronoff expected. In the 1940s, [[Kenneth Walker (surgeon)|Dr. Kenneth Walker]], an eminent British surgeon, dismissed Voronoff's treatment as "no better than the methods of witches and magicians."<ref name="monkey">[[The Cincinnati Post|''The Cincinnati-Kentucky Post'']] (November 5, 1998) ''Medical monkey business.'' Section:News; Page 22A</ref>

In the 1940s, his treatment was widely used by [[association football|football]] players at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], although it eventually fell out of favor.<ref name="football">{{cite news | author = Norrish, Mike | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/arsenal/5202158/Andrei-Arshavins-feat-throws-spotlight-on-ultimate-case-of-monkey-business.html | title = Andrei Arshavin's feat throws spotlight on ultimate case of monkey business | date = 2009-04-22 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 2009-04-23}}</ref>

==Death and burial==
Voronoff died on September 3, 1951, in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], from complications following a fall.<ref name="Hamilton">Hamilton, David. (1986) ''The Monkey Gland Affair.'' Publisher: Chatto & Windus. ISBN 0-7011-3021-0</ref> While recovering from a broken leg, Voronoff suffered chest difficulties, thought either to be [[pneumonia]] or possibly a blood clot from his leg that moved to his lungs.<ref name="Hamilton"/>

As Voronoff was no longer respected, few newspapers ran obituaries,<ref name="Hamilton"/> and those that did acted as if Voronoff had always been ridiculed for his beliefs.<ref name="Hamilton"/> For example, ''[[The New York Times]]'', once one of his supporters, spelt his name incorrectly and stated that "few took his claims seriously".<ref name="Hamilton"/>

Voronoff is buried in the Russian section of the Caucade Cemetery in [[Nice]].

==Reputation and legacy==
In the 1990s, Voronoff's negative reputation was softened. In November 1991, one of the oldest peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, ''[[The Lancet]]'', suggested that the file on Voronoff's work be reopened and in particular that "the Medical Research Council should fund further studies on monkey glands."<ref name="Lancet"/> By 1994, there were calls for a qualified apology from the orthodox medical establishment for dismissing Voronoff's work.<ref name="secret"/> In particular, since modern medicine has established that the Sertoli cells of the testes constitute a barrier to the immune system, rendering the testes an immunologically privileged site for the transplantation of foreign tissue, the thin slices of monkey testicles Voronoff implanted into the patient's testicles may in theory have survived to produce some benefit. There have recently been successful experiments reducing insulin requirements in diabetics by implanting into them pancreatic islet cells from pigs coated in Sertoli cells to insulate them from attack by the immune system.  No immunosuppressive drugs were required.<ref>R. A. Valdez-Gonzalez, "Xenotransplantation of porcine neonatal Islets of Langerhans and Sertoli cells: A 4-year study," European Journal of Endocrinology, vol. 153, no. 3 (September, 2005), pp. 419-427.</ref> In 1998, the sweeping popularity of [[Viagra]] brought forth references to Voronoff.<ref name="monkey"/><ref>Campbell-Johnston, Rachel. (August 5, 1998) ''[[The Times]]'' ''The price of priapic paradise.'' Section: Features; Page 16.</ref> However, in 1999, some speculated that the [[AIDS]] virus discovered in the 1980s entered the human population through Voronoff's transfer of monkey parts into humans in the 1920s.<ref>Scanlon, Jim. (June 1999) The Coastal Post. ''[http://www.coastalpost.com/99/6/9.htm Did Transplanted Chimpanzee Testicles Start AIDS Epidemic in 1920s?]'' (reviewing a letter in the April, 1999 issue of the scientific journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']])</ref>

By 2003, Voronoff's efforts in the 1920s reached trivia [[factoid]] status for newspapers.<ref>[[mX (newspaper)|mX]] (February 27, 2003) ''It's true.'' Section: News; Page 7. (printing, "Russian transplant pioneer Serge Voronoff made headlines in 1920 by grafting monkey testicles onto human males.")</ref> However, as recently as 2005, Voronoff's work in the 1920s and 1930s was noted for setting the basis for the modern anti-aging strategy of replacing hormones—the internally secreted substances that decline with age—to regain the vitality and physical attributes associated with youth.<ref>Kahn, Arnold. (February 1, 2005) [[The Gerontological Society of America|Journals of Gerontology, Series A, Biological Science & Medical Science]] ''Regaining lost youth: the controversial and colorful beginnings of hormone replacement therapy in aging.''

==Popular culture==
[[Image:Sobachye.jpg|thumb|right|Screen shot from the 1988 Russian movie ''Heart of a Dog''. <!--Preobrazhensky on the left and Sharikov on the right.-->]]

As Voronoff's work became famous in the 1920s, it began to be featured in popular culture. The song "Monkey-Doodle-Doo", written by Irving Berlin and featured in the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[The Coconuts]]'', contains the line: "If you're too old for dancing/Get yourself a monkey gland". Strange-looking [[ashtray]]s depicting monkeys protecting their private parts, with the phrase (translated from [[French language|French]]) "No, Voronoff, you won't get me!" painted on them began showing up in Parisian homes.<ref>Nugent, Karen. (April 9, 2000) [[Telegram & Gazette]] ''"Xeno-grafting" explored \ Clinton doctor writes the book.'' Section: Local news; Page B1.</ref> At about this same time, a new cocktail containing gin, orange juice, grenadine and absinthe was named [[The Monkey Gland]].<ref>Hirst, Christopher. (October 8, 2005) [[The Independent]] ''101 cocktails that shook the world #37: The Monkey Gland.'' Section: Features; Page 57.</ref>

Voronoff was the prototype for Professor Preobrazhensky in [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[Heart of a Dog]]'', published in 1925.<ref>[http://life.orthomed.ru/zhizn/etika/00003.htm Tatiana Bateneva. ''In the quest for longevity humans are ready to become relatives with any animals''] {{ru icon}}</ref> In the novel, Preobrazhensky implants human testicles and [[pituitary gland]] into a stray dog named [[Heart of a Dog|Sharik]]. Sharik then proceeds to become more and more human as time passes, picks himself the name Polygraph Polygraphovich Sharikov, makes himself a career with the "department of the clearing of the city from cats and other vile animals", and turns the life in the professor's house into a nightmare until the professor reverses the procedure.

The Sherlock Holmes story ''[[The Adventure of the Creeping Man]]'' seems to have been inspired by Voronoff's work. Written in 1923 but set in 1903, it is about a distinguished, elderly, Cambridge Professor who experiences bizarre side-effects after secretly taking a drug, derived in an unspecified manner from monkeys, in order to produce rejuvenation.

==Personal life==
Voronoff married his first wife, Marguerite Barbe, in 1897; she died in 1910. He married his second, Evelyn Bostwick in 1920 (Bostwick's daughter from a previous marriage was [[Joe Carstairs]]). Evelyn translated into English Voronoff's book ''Life: a means of restoring vital energy and prolinging life''. She died on March 3, 1921, at the age of 48. Her legacy gave Voronoff a large income for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=34}}

Ten years later, Voronoff married Gerti Schwartz, believed by some to be the illegitimate daughter of [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol of Romania]].{{sfn|Summerscale|1997|p=35}} She outlived him and became the [[Countess|Condesa]] [[da Foz]] upon Voronoff's death.
