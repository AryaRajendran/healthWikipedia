'''Plasma proteins''', also termed '''serum proteins''' or '''blood proteins''', are [[protein]]s present in [[blood plasma]]. They serve many different functions, including transport of lipids, hormones, vitamins and metals in the circulatory system and the regulation of [[Non-cellular life|acellular]] activity and functioning and in the [[immune system]]. Other blood proteins act as enzymes, complement components, [[protease inhibitors]] or [[kinin precursor]]s. Contrary to popular belief, [[hemoglobin]] is not a blood protein, as it is carried within [[red blood cell]]s, rather than in the blood serum.

[[Serum albumin]] accounts for 55% of blood proteins, and is a major contributor to maintaining the osmotic pressure of plasma to assist in the transport of lipids and steroid hormones. Globulins make up 38% of blood proteins and transport ions, hormones and lipids assisting in immune function. [[Fibrinogen]] comprise 7% of blood proteins; conversion of fibrinogen to insoluble [[fibrin]] is essential for blood clotting. The remainder of plasma proteins (1%) is made up of regulatory proteins such as enzymes, proenzymes and hormones. All blood proteins are synthesized in liver except for the [[gamma globulin]]s.  

Separating [[blood serum|serum]] proteins by [[serum protein electrophoresis|electrophoresis]] is a valuable diagnostic tool as well as a way to monitor clinical progress. Current research regarding [[blood plasma]] proteins is centered on performing [[proteomics]] analyses of serum/plasma in the search for biomarkers. These efforts started with [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]]<ref name=Anderson_1977>{{cite journal | author=Anderson NL and Anderson NG | title=High Resolution Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis of Human Plasma Proteins | journal=Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences | year=1977 | pages=5421–5425 | volume=74 | pmid=271964 | doi=10.1073/pnas.74.12.5421 | issue=12 | pmc=431746}}</ref> efforts in the 1970s and in more recent times this research has been performed using LC-[[Mass spectrometry#Tandem MS .28MS.2FMS.29|tandem MS]]<ref name=Adkins_2002>{{cite journal | author=Adkins JN ''et al.'' | title=Toward a human blood serum proteome: analysis by multidimensional separation coupled with mass spectrometry | journal=Molecular and Cellular Proteomics | year=2002 | pages=947–955 | volume=1 | pmid=12543931 | doi=10.1074/mcp.M200066-MCP200 | issue=12 }}</ref><ref name=Jacobs_2005>{{cite journal | author=Jacobs JM ''et al.'' | title=Utilizing human blood plasma for proteomic biomarker discovery | journal=Journal of Proteome Research | year=2005 | pages=1073–1085 | volume=4 | pmid=16083256 | doi=10.1021/pr0500657 | issue=4}}</ref>  based proteomics. The normal laboratory value of [[serum total protein]] is around 7 g/dL.
