'''Health administration''' or '''healthcare administration''' is the field relating to leadership, management, and administration of [[hospital]]s, [[hospital network]]s, [[health care systems]], and public health systems. Health care administrators are considered [[health care professional]]s.  

The discipline is known by many names, including '''health management''', '''healthcare management''', '''health systems management''', health care systems management, and '''medical and health services management'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/management/en|title=World Health Organization - Management}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://healthmanagementcareers.org|title=ACHE Health Management Careers website}}</ref> There are two types of administrators, generalists and specialists. Generalists are individuals who are responsible for managing or helping to manage an entire facility. Specialists are individuals who are responsible for the efficient operations of a specific department such as policy analysis, finance, accounting, budgeting, human resources, or marketing.

==Education and training==
Although many colleges and universities are offering a [[bachelor's degree]] in healthcare administration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/bachelors-degree-healthcare-administration/|title=Bachelor's of Science Degree in Healthcare Administration}}</ref> a [[master's degree]] is considered the "standard credential"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos014.htm|title= Bureau of Labor Statistics - Occupational Outlook Handbook entry}}</ref> for most health administrators in the United States.  There are multiple recognized degree types that are considered equivalent from the perspective of professional preparation. 

The [[Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education]] (CAHME) is the [[Educational accreditation|accrediting body]] overseeing master's-level programs in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on behalf of the [[United States Department of Education]]. It accredits several degree program types, including [[Master of Health Services Administration]] (MHSA), [[Master of Business Administration in Hospital Management]] (MBA-HM), [[Master of Health Administration]] (MHA), [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH, MSPH, MSHPM), [[Master of Science]] (MS-HSM, MS-HA), and [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA).

== Professional Organizations ==
There are numerous professional associations related to health systems management, which can be subcategorized as either personal or institutional membership groups. Personal membership groups are joined by individuals, and typically have individual skill and career development as their focus. Larger personal membership groups include the American College of Healthcare Executives, the Healthcare Financial Management Association, and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society. Institutional membership groups are joined by organizations; they typically focus on organizational effectiveness, and may also include data-sharing agreements and other best-practice sharing vehicles for member organizations. Prominent examples include the American Hospital Association and the University Healthsystems Consortium.
