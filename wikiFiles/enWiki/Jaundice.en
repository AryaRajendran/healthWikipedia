Jaundice is often seen in liver disease such as [[hepatitis]] or [[liver cancer]]. It may also indicate [[leptospirosis]] or obstruction of the [[biliary tract]], for example by [[gallstones]] or [[pancreatic cancer]], or less commonly be congenital in origin (e.g., [[biliary atresia]]).

Yellow discoloration of the [[skin]], especially on the palms and the soles, but not of the [[sclera]] and [[mucous membranes]] (i.e. oral cavity) is due to [[carotenemia]]—a harmless condition<ref>Carotenemia, Author: Robert A Schwartz, MD, MPH; Chief Editor: Dirk M Elston, MD, http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1104368-overview#showall</ref> important to differentiate from jaundice.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Jaundice.jpg|thumb| A 4-year-old boy with icteric (jaundiced) sclera which later proved to be a manifestation of [[hemolytic anemia]] due to [[G6PD deficiency]] following [[fava bean]] consumption.]]
The main symptom of jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the white part of the eyes and of the skin.

The conjunctiva of the eye are one of the first [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] to change color as bilirubin levels rise in jaundice. This is sometimes referred to as ''scleral icterus''. However, the sclera themselves are not "icteric" (stained with [[Bilin (biochemistry)|bile pigment]]) but rather the conjunctival membranes that overlie them. The yellowing of the "white of the eye" is thus more properly termed ''conjunctival icterus''.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3225/is_1_71/ai_n8702953 Findarticles.com], accessed Nov. 22, 2008</ref> The term "icterus" itself is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to jaundice that is noted in the [[sclera]] of the eyes, however its more common and more correct meaning is entirely synonymous with jaundice.<ref name=medicinenet /><ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/icterus</ref>

== Differential diagnosis ==
When a pathological process interferes with the normal functioning of the metabolism and excretion of bilirubin just described, jaundice may be the result. Jaundice is classified into three categories, depending on which part of the physiological mechanism the pathology affects. The three categories are:

|}

=== Pre-hepatic ===
''Pre-hepatic'' jaundice is caused by anything which causes an increased rate of [[hemolysis]] (breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s). In tropical countries, [[malaria]] can cause jaundice in this manner. Certain [[Genetic disorder|genetic diseases]], such as [[sickle cell anemia]], [[spherocytosis]], [[thalassemia]] and [[glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] can lead to increased red cell lysis and therefore hemolytic jaundice. Commonly, diseases of the kidney, such as [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]], can also lead to coloration. Defects in [[bilirubin metabolism]] also present as jaundice, as in [[Gilbert's syndrome]] (a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism which can result in mild jaundice, which is found in about 5% of the population) and [[Crigler-Najjar syndrome]].

In jaundice secondary to hemolysis, the increased production of bilirubin, leads to the increased production of urine-urobilinogen. Bilirubin is not usually found in the urine because unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, so, the combination of increased urine-urobilinogen with no bilirubin (since, unconjugated) in urine is suggestive of hemolytic jaundice.

Laboratory findings include:
* Urine: no bilirubin present, urobilinogen > 2 units (i.e., hemolytic anemia causes increased heme metabolism; exception: infants where [[gut flora]] has not developed).
* Serum: increased unconjugated bilirubin.
* [[Kernicterus]] is associated with increased unconjugated bilirubin, neonates are especially vulnerable to this due to increase permeability of the [[blood brain barrier]].

=== Hepatocellular ===
''Hepatocellular (hepatic)'' jaundice can be caused by acute or chronic [[hepatitis]], [[hepatotoxicity]], [[cirrhosis]], drug induced hepatitis and [[alcoholic liver disease]]. Cell [[necrosis]] reduces the liver's ability to metabolize and excrete bilirubin leading to a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Other causes include [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] leading to an increase in plasma conjugated bilirubin because there is impairment of excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile. The blood contains abnormally raised amount of conjugated bilirubin and bile salts which are excreted in the urine. Jaundice seen in the newborn, known as ''[[neonatal jaundice]]'', is common in newborns<ref>{{cite book |author=Collier J, Longore M, Turmezei T, Mafi AR |title=Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialties | chapter=Neonatal jaundice |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-19-922888-1}}</ref> as [[hepatic]] machinery for the conjugation and excretion of bilirubin does not fully mature until approximately two weeks of age. Rat fever ([[leptospirosis]]) can also cause hepatic jaundice. In hepatic jaundice, there is invariably [[cholestasis]].

Laboratory findings depend on the cause of jaundice.

* Urine: Conjugated bilirubin present, urobilirubin > 2 units but variable (except in children). Kernicterus is a condition not associated with increased conjugated bilirubin.
* Plasma protein show characteristic changes.
* Plasma albumin level is low but plasma globulins are raised due to an increased formation of antibodies.

Bilirubin transport across the hepatocyte may be impaired at any point between the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin into the cell and transport of conjugated bilirubin into biliary canaliculi. In addition, swelling of cells and [[oedema]] due to inflammation cause mechanical obstruction of intrahepatic biliary tree. Hence in hepatocellular jaundice, concentration of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin rises in the blood. In hepatocellular disease, there is usually interference in all major steps of [[bilirubin]] metabolism—uptake, conjugation and excretion. However, excretion is the rate-limiting step, and usually impaired to the greatest extent. As a result, conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia predominates.<ref>Medicine: Prep Manual for Undergraduates, 3/e By Mathew K.G. pages 296-297</ref>

The unconjugated bilirubin still enters the liver cells and becomes conjugated in the usual way. This conjugated bilirubin is then returned to the blood, probably by rupture of the congested bile canaliculi and direct emptying of the bile into the lymph leaving the liver. Thus, most of the bilirubin in the plasma becomes the conjugated type rather than the unconjugated type, and this conjugated bilirubin which did not go to intestine to become urobilinogen gives the urine the dark color.<ref>Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology: with STUDENT CONSULT Online Access, 12e. page 841, ISBN  1416045740</ref>

=== Post-hepatic ===
''Post-hepatic'' jaundice, also called obstructive jaundice, is caused by an interruption to the drainage of [[bile]] in the biliary system. The most common causes are [[gallstone]]s in the [[common bile duct]], and [[pancreatic cancer]] in the head of the [[pancreas]].  Also, a group of parasites known as "[[liver fluke]]s" can live in the common bile duct, causing obstructive jaundice.  Other causes include strictures of the common bile duct, [[biliary atresia]], [[cholangiocarcinoma]], [[pancreatitis]] and [[pancreatic pseudocyst]]s. A rare cause of obstructive jaundice is [[Mirizzi's syndrome]].

In complete obstruction of the bile duct, no urobilinogen is found in the urine, since bilirubin has no access to the intestine  and it is in the intestine that bilirubin gets converted to urobilinogen to be later released into the general circulation. In this case, presence of bilirubin (conjugated) in the urine without urine-urobilinogen suggests obstructive jaundice, either intra-hepatic or post-hepatic.

The presence of pale stools and dark urine suggests an obstructive or post-hepatic cause as normal feces get their color from [[bile pigment]]s. However, although pale stools and dark urine are a feature of biliary obstruction, they can occur in many intra-hepatic illnesses and are therefore not a reliable clinical feature to distinguish obstruction from hepatic causes of jaundice.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1119305|title=Investigation of liver and biliary disease|year=2001|volume=322|issue=7277|pmid=11141153|last1=Beckingham|first1=IJ|last2=Ryder|first2=SD|pages=33–6|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7277.33}}</ref>

Patients also can present with elevated serum cholesterol, and often complain of severe itching or "pruritus" because of the deposition of bile salts.

No single test can differentiate between various classifications of jaundice. A combination of liver function tests is essential to arrive at a diagnosis.

=== Neonatal jaundice ===
{{main|Neonatal jaundice}}
''Neonatal jaundice'' is usually harmless: this condition is often seen in [[infants]] around the second day after birth, lasting until day 8 in normal births, or to around day 14 in [[premature birth]]s. Typical causes for neonatal jaundice include normal physiologic jaundice, jaundice due to breast feeding, and hemolytic disorders that include [[hereditary spherocytosis]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], pyruvate kinase deficiency, ABO/Rh blood type autoantibodies, or infantile [[pyknocytosis]]. Serum bilirubin normally drops to a low level without any intervention required: the jaundice is presumably a consequence of metabolic and physiological adjustments after birth. In  cases where bilirubin rises higher, a brain-damaging condition known as [[kernicterus]] can occur, leading to significant lifelong disability;<ref name="family"/> there are concerns that this condition has been rising in recent years due to inadequate detection and treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. A [[Bili light]] is often the tool used for early treatment, which often consists of exposing the baby to intensive phototherapy. However, in third world countries where procuring such treatment is prohibitively expensive, parents often subject their children to regular daily sunbathing. Bilirubin count is lowered through bowel movements and urination so regular and proper feedings are especially important.<ref>{{cite journal| last=O'Keefe|first=Lori| title = Increased vigilance needed to prevent kernicterus in newborns  | journal= American Academy of Pediatrics|volume=18|issue=5|pages=231|publisher=|year=2001|month=May|url=http://aapnews.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/18/5/231| doi=}}</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
Jaundice itself is not a disease, but rather a sign of one of many possible underlying pathological processes that occur at some point along the normal physiological pathway of the metabolism of bilirubin in blood.

When red blood cells have completed their life span of approximately 120 days, or when they are damaged, their membranes become fragile and prone to rupture. As each red blood cell traverses through the [[reticuloendothelial system]], its cell membrane ruptures when its membrane is fragile enough to allow this. Cellular contents, including [[hemoglobin]], are subsequently released into the blood. The hemoglobin is phagocytosed by [[macrophages]], and split into its [[heme]] and [[globin]] portions. The globin portion, a [[protein]], is degraded into [[amino acids]] and plays no role in jaundice. Two reactions then take place with the heme molecule. The first [[oxidation]] reaction is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme heme oxygenase and results in biliverdin (green color pigment), iron and carbon monoxide. The next step is the reduction of biliverdin to a yellow color tetrapyrol pigment called bilirubin by cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase. This bilirubin is "unconjugated," "free" or "indirect" bilirubin. Approximately 4&nbsp;mg of bilirubin per kg of blood is produced each day.<ref name="PedRev">{{cite journal

However approximately 20 percent comes from other heme sources, including ineffective [[erythropoiesis]], and the breakdown of other heme-containing proteins, such as muscle [[myoglobin]] and [[cytochrome]]s.<ref name="PedRev" />

=== Hepatic events ===
The unconjugated bilirubin then travels to the [[liver]] through the bloodstream. Because this bilirubin is not soluble, however, it is transported through the blood bound to [[serum albumin]]. Once it arrives at the liver, it is conjugated with [[glucuronic acid]] (to form bilirubin diglucuronide, or just "conjugated bilirubin") to become more water soluble. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase.

This conjugated bilirubin is excreted from the liver into the biliary and cystic ducts as part of [[bile]]. Intestinal bacteria convert the bilirubin into [[urobilinogen]]. From here  urobilinogen can take two pathways. It can either be further converted into [[stercobilinogen]], which is then [[oxidized]] to [[stercobilin]] and passed out in the [[feces]], or it can be reabsorbed by the intestinal cells, transported in the blood to the [[kidneys]], and passed out in the [[urine]] as the oxidised product [[urobilin]]. Stercobilin and urobilin are the products responsible for the coloration of feces and urine, respectively.

== Diagnostic approach ==
[[File:Obstructivebiliarydilation.png|thumb|Biliary tract dilation due to obstruction as seen on CAT scan]]
[[File:Obstructivebiliarydilation2.png|thumb|Biliary tract dilation due to obstruction]]
Most patients presenting with jaundice will have various predictable patterns of liver panel abnormalities, though significant variation does exist.  The typical liver panel will include blood levels of enzymes found primarily from the liver, such as the aminotransferases (ALT, AST), and [[alkaline phosphatase]] (ALP); bilirubin (which causes the jaundice); and protein levels, specifically, total protein and albumin.  Other primary lab tests for liver function include [[gamma glutamyl transpeptidase]] (GGT) and [[prothrombin time]] (PT).

Some bone and heart disorders can lead to an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which will only be elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver (hepatic) causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. The former typically indicates a surgical response, while the latter typically leans toward a medical response. ALP and GGT levels will typically rise with one pattern while [[aspartate aminotransferase]] (AST) and [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10–45 IU/L) and GGT (18–85) levels rise proportionately about as high as the AST (12–38 IU/L) and ALT (10–45 IU/L) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. On the other hand, if the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, this indicates an hepatic problem.  Finally, distinguishing between hepatic causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful.  AST levels will typically be higher than ALT.  This remains the case in most hepatic disorders except for hepatitis (viral or hepatotoxic).  Alcoholic liver damage may see fairly normal ALT levels, with AST 10x higher than ALT.  On the other hand, if ALT is higher than AST, this is indicative of hepatitis.  Levels of ALT and AST are not well correlated to the extent of liver damage, although rapid drops in these levels from very high levels can indicate severe necrosis.  Low levels of albumin tend to indicate a chronic condition, while it is normal in hepatitis and [[cholestasis]].

Lab results for liver panels are frequently compared by the magnitude of their differences, not the pure number, as well as by their ratios.  The AST:ALT ratio can be a good indicator of whether the disorder is alcoholic liver damage (10), some other form of liver damage (above 1), or hepatitis (less than 1).  Bilirubin levels greater than 10x normal could indicate neoplastic or intrahepatic cholestasis.  Levels lower than this tend to indicate hepatocellular causes.  AST levels greater than 15x tends to indicate acute hepatocellular damage.  Less than this tend to indicate obstructive causes.  ALP levels greater than 5x normal tend to indicate obstruction, while levels greater than 10x normal can indicate drug (toxic) induced cholestatic hepatitis or Cytomegalovirus.  Both of these conditions can also have ALT and AST greater than 20× normal.  GGT levels greater than 10x normal typically indicate cholestasis.  Levels 5–10× tend to indicate viral hepatitis.  Levels less than 5× normal tend to indicate drug toxicity.  Acute hepatitis will typically have ALT and AST levels rising 20–30× normal (above 1000), and may remain significantly elevated for several weeks.  Acetaminophen toxicity can result in ALT and AST levels greater than 50x normal.

== Complications ==
Complications of jaundice include sepsis especially cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, renal and liver failure. Other complications are related to the underlying disease and the procedures employed in the diagnosis and management of individual diseases. Cholangitis especially the suppurative type (Charcot’s triad or Raynaud’s pentad) is usually secondary to choledocholithiasis. It may also complicate procedures like [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]]. Treatment should include correction of coagulopathy, fluid/electrolyte anomaly, antibiotics and biliary drainage with ERCP where available or trans-hepatic drainage or surgery.
