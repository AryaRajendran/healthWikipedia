[[Image:Fast food 01 ebru.jpg|thumb|[[Fast food]] is a typical example of food consumed in a Western pattern diet.]]

The '''Western pattern diet''', also called '''Western dietary pattern''' or the '''meat-sweet diet''', is a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary habit]] chosen by many people in some developed countries, and increasingly in developing countries.  It is characterized by high intakes of [[red meat]], sugary [[dessert]]s, high-fat foods, and [[refined grain]]s.<ref name=Medscape /> It also typically contains high-fat [[dairy product]]s, [[high-sugar drink]]s,<ref name=pmid16469985 /> and higher intakes of [[processed meat]].

The term is used to describe this pattern of diet in medical literature, regardless of where the diet is found, and is often contrasted with the "prudent" diet,{{Vague|date=July 2011}} which has higher levels of fruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods, poultry and fish.<ref name="pmid11124751" />  Other dietary patterns described in the medical research include "drinker" and "meat-eater" patterns.<ref name="pmid16990408" />  Because of the variability in diets, individuals are usually classified not as simply "following" or "not following" a given diet, but instead by ranking them according to how closely their diets line up with each pattern in turn.  The researchers then compare the outcomes between the group that most closely follows a given pattern to the group that least closely follows a given pattern.

== Standard American Diet ==
The "Standard American Diet" (S.A.D.) is a similar term, specifically used to denigrate what some authors say is the stereotypical diet of Americans. The typical American diet is about 50%&nbsp;carbohydrate, 15%&nbsp;protein, and 35%&nbsp;fat<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Last |first1=Allen R. |last2=Wilson |first2=Stephen A. |title=Low-Carbohydrate Diets |journal=American Family Physician |volume=73 |issue=11 |year=2006 |pages=1942–8 |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=16770923 |pmid=16770923}}</ref> which is over the dietary guidelines for the amount of fat (below&nbsp;30%), below the guidelines for carbohydrate (above&nbsp;55%), and at the upper end of the guidelines for the amount of protein (below&nbsp;15%) recommended in the diet.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Donald K. |last1=Layman |first2=Richard A. |last2=Boileau |first3=Donna J. |last3=Erickson |first4=James E. |last4=Painter |first5=Harn |last5=Shiue |first6=Carl |last6=Sather |first7=Demtra D. |last7=Christou |title=A Reduced Ratio of Dietary Carbohydrate to Protein Improves Body Composition and Blood Lipid Profiles during Weight Loss in Adult Women |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=133 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=411–7 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12566476 |pmid=12566476}}</ref>

The quality of the carbohydrate, protein, and fat is at least as important as the quantity. [[Polysaccharide|Complex carbohydrates]] such as [[starch]] are believed to be more healthy than the [[sugar]] so frequently consumed in the Standard American Diet. [[Laboratory rat|Fischer&nbsp;344 rats]] fed cornstarch ''[[Ad_libitum#Biology|ad libitum]]'' lived nearly 10% longer than Fischer&nbsp;344 rats fed sucrose ''ad libitum''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/gerona/50A.3.B148 |title=Source of Dietary Carbohydrate Affects Life Span of Fischer 344 Rats Independent of Caloric Restriction |year=1995 |last1=Murtagh-Mark |first1=Carol M. |last2=Reiser |first2=Karen M. |last3=Harris |first3=Robert |last4=McDonald |first4=Roger B. |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=50A |issue=3 |pages=B148–54 |pmid=7743394}}</ref>

The Standard American Diet is high in [[saturated fat]], but it is estimated that for every 1% of saturated fat energy that is replaced with [[polyunsaturated fat]] there would be more than a 2-3% reduction in [[Coronary disease|coronary heart disease]] incidence<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3945/ajcn.110.004622 |title=The role of reducing intakes of saturated fat in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: Where does the evidence stand in 2010? |year=2011 |last1=Astrup |first1=Arne |last2=Dyerberg |first2=Jørn |last3=Elwood |first3=Peter |last4=Hermansen |first4=Kjeld |last5=Hu |first5=Frank B |last6=Jakobsen |first6=Marianne Uhre |last7=Kok |first7=Frans J |last8=Krauss |first8=Ronald M |last9=Lecerf |first9=Jean Michel |journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=684–8 |pmid=21270379 |pmc=3138219}}</ref> And even for [[polyunsaturated fat]], the high levels of [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s compared to [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s in the Western diet is believe to contribute to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as well as cancer and cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3181/0711-MR-311 |title=The Importance of the Omega-6/Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio in Cardiovascular Disease and Other Chronic Diseases |year=2008 |last1=Simopoulos |first1=Artemis P. |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |volume=233 |issue=6 |pages=674–88 |pmid=18408140}}</ref>

A review of eating habits in the United States in 2004 found that about 3/4 of restaurant meals were from fast-food restaurants, whereas only 1% were fine food dining restaurants. Nearly half of the meals ordered from a menu were hamburger, [[French fries]], or [[poultry]] &mdash; and about one third of orders included a [[Soft drink|carbonated beverage drink]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lobb |first=Annelena |title=Eating Habits -- A Look At the Average U.S. Diet |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=September 17, 2005 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB112671039063140472.html |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> From 1970 to 2008, the per capita consumption of calories increased by nearly one-quarter in the United States and about 10% of all calories were from [[high-fructose corn syrup]].<ref name="Grist">{{cite web |last=Philpott |first=Tom |title=The American diet in one chart, with lots of fats and sugars |work=Industrial Agriculture |publisher=Grist |date=April 5, 2011 |url=http://www.grist.org/industrial-agriculture/2011-04-05-american-diet-one-chart-lots-of-fats-sugars |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref>

==Health concerns==
Compared to the "prudent" diet,{{Vague|date=July 2011}} the Western pattern diet, based on epidemiological studies of Westerners, is  positively correlated with an elevated incidence of [[obesity]],<ref name="pmid11124751" /> death from heart disease, cancer (especially [[colon cancer]]),<ref name="pmid16990408" /> and other 'Western pattern diet' related diseases.<ref name="pmid18574045" />

Physicians [[John A. McDougall]], [[Caldwell Esselstyn]], [[Neal D. Barnard]], [[Dean Ornish]], [[Michael Greger]], and nutritional biochemist [[T. Colin Campbell]], argue that high animal fat and protein diets, such as the standard American diet, are detrimental to health, and that a low-fat [[veganism|vegan]] diet can both prevent and reverse degenerative diseases such as [[coronary artery disease]] and diabetes.<ref name=disease>For [[T.
