Anti-cardiolipin antibodies can be classified in two ways. 
* As IgM, IgG or IgA
* As β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein dependent or independent
** In autoimmune disease ACA are beta-2 glycoprotein dependent
** [[syphilis]] ACA<ref name="pmid5346419"/> are beta-2 glycoprotein independent and can be assayed using the [[Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test]]

==Apolipoprotein H involvement==
