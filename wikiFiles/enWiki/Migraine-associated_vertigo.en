'''Migraine-associated vertigo''' (MAV) is [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] associated with a [[migraine]], either as a symptom of migraine or as a related but [[neurological disorder]]; when referred to as a [[disease]] unto itself, it is also termed '''vestibular migraine''', '''migrainous vertigo''', or '''migraine-related vestibulopathy'''.  

A 2010 report from the [[University of British Columbia]] published in the journal ''[[Headache (journal)|Headache]]'' said that it "...&nbsp;is emerging as a popular diagnosis for patients with recurrent vertigo. Even though some authors believe that 'migraine associated vertigo,' is neither clinically nor biologically plausible as a migraine variant."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phillips J, Longridge N, Mallinson A, Robinson G |title=Migraine and Vertigo: A Marriage of Convenience? |journal=Headache |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20738416 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01745.x |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=1362–1365}}</ref> Epidemiological studies leave no doubt that there is a strong link between vertigo and migraine. <ref>{{cite journal|last=von Brevern|first=M|coauthors=Baloh RW, Bisdorff A, Brandt T, Bronstein AM, Furman JM, Goadsby PJ, Neuhauser H, Radtke A, Versino M|title=Response to: Migraine and Vertigo: A Marriage of Convenience?|journal=Headache|volume=51|pages=308–309|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01834.x|year=2011|issue=2|pmid=21284614}}</ref>

== Classification ==
'''[[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]]''' - Migraine is commonly associated with BPPV, the most common [[vestibular disorder]] in patients [[presenting]] with dizziness. The two may be linked by genetic factors or by vascular damage to the labyrinth.<ref name="Lempert JN" /> 

'''Ménière's disease''' - There is an increased prevalence of migraine in patients with [[Ménière's disease]] and migraine leads to a greater susceptibility of developing Ménière’s disease.  But they can be distinguished.  Ménière's disease may go on for days or even years, while migraines typically do not last longer than 24 hours.<ref name="Lempert JN" /> 

'''Motion sickness''' is more prevalent in patients with migraine.<ref name="Lempert JN" />  

'''Psychiatric syndromes''' Dizziness and spinning vertigo are the second most common symptom of [[panic attack]]s, and they can also present as a symptom of [[major depression]].  Migraine is a risk factor for developing major depression and panic disorder and vice versa.<ref name="Lempert JN" />

== Signs and symptoms ==
Vertigo is a medically recognized term for the symptom of [[vestibular system]] disturbance.  It may include a feeling of rotation or illusory sensations of motion or both.  The general term dizziness is used by nonmedical people for those symptoms but often refers to a feeling of light-headedness, giddiness, drowsiness, or faintness, all of which must be differentiated from true vertigo,<ref name=PMID16026673>{{cite journal |author=Lempert T, Neuhauser H |title=Migrainous vertigo |journal=Neurol Clin |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=715–30, vi |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16026673 |doi=10.1016/j.ncl.2005.01.003}}</ref> since the latter symptoms might have other causes.

Motion sickness occurs more frequently in migraine patients (30-50%) than in controls.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neuhauser H, Lempert T |title=Vertigo and dizziness related to migraine: a diagnostic challenge |journal=Cephalalgia |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=83–91 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14728703 |doi= 10.1111/j.1468-2982.2004.00662.x|url=}}</ref> Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is an example of migraine-associated vertigo in which headache does not often occur.<ref name="Lempert JN" />  [[Migraine#Classification|Basilar migraine]] consists of two or more symptoms (vertigo, tinnitus, decreased hearing, [[ataxia]], [[dysarthria]], visual symptoms in both hemifields or both eyes, [[diplopia]], bilateral [[paresthesia]]s, [[paresis]], decreased consciousness and/or loss of consciousness) followed by throbbing headache. Auditory symptoms are rare.  However, a study showed a fluctuating low-tone [[sensorineural hearing loss]] in more than 50% of patients with BAM with a noticeable change in hearing just before the onset of a migraine headache. The attacks of vertigo are usually concurrent with the headache and the family history is usually positive. The diagnostician must rule out:  [[Transient ischemic attack|TIAs]], and [[paroxysmal vestibular disorder]] accompanied by headache.

There is also a familial vestibulopathy, familial [[benign recurrent vertigo]] (fBRV), where episodes of vertigo occur with or without migraine headache.  Testing may show profound vestibular loss.  The syndrome responds to [[acetazolamide]]. [[Familial hemiplegic migraine]] (FHM) has been linked to mutations in the [[calcium channel]] gene. (Ophoff et al. 1966 cf. Lempert et al.)<ref name="Lempert JN" />

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of MAV is not completely understood; both central and peripheral defects have been observed.<ref name=CalBahmad>{{cite journal |author=Cal R, Bahmad Jr F |title=Migraine associated with auditory-vestibular dysfunction |journal=Braz J Otorhinolaryngol |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=606–12 |year=2008 |pmid=18852990 |url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rboto/v74n4/en_a20v74n4.pdf}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
MAV is not recognized a distinct diagnostic entity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Felisati G, Pipolo C, Portaleone S |title=Migraine and vertigo: two diseases with the same pathogenesis? |journal=[[Neurol. Sci.]] |volume=31 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S107–9 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20464597 |doi=10.1007/s10072-010-0299-0 }}</ref> Lembert and Neuhauser propose criteria for definite and probable migraine-associated vertigo.<ref name=PMID16026673/> 

A diagnosis of ''definite migraine-associated vertigo'' includes a case history of: 
*[[episodic vestibular symptoms]] of at least moderate severity;
*current or previous history of migraine according to the 2004 ''[[International Classification of Headache Disorders]]'';
*one of the following migrainous symptoms during two or more attacks of vertigo: migrainous headache, [[photophobia]], [[phonophobia]], [[aura (symptom)|visual or other auras]]; and
*other causes ruled out by appropriate investigations.

A diagnosis of ''probable migraine-associated vertigo'' includes a case history of episodic vestibular symptoms of at least moderate severity and one of the following:
*current or previous history of migraine according to the 2004 ''International Classification of Headache Disorders'';
*migrainous symptoms during vestibular symptoms;
*migraine precipitants of vertigo in more than 50% of attacks, such as [[food sensitivity|food triggers]], sleep irregularities, or hormonal change;
*response to migraine medications in more than 50% of attacks; and
*other causes ruled out by appropriate investigations.

Note that, in both of the above criteria, headache is not required to make the diagnosis of migraine-associated vertigo.<ref name=PMID16026673/><ref name=emed>{{cite web |author= Benson AG, Chark DW, Djalilian HR, Robbins WK, Battista RA |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/884136-overview |title= Migraine-associated vertigo |publisher=WebMd |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2010}}</ref>  

They add that, in patients with a clear-cut history, no vestibular tests are required. Other historical criteria which are helpful in making the diagnosis of migraine-associated vertigo are vertiginous symptoms throughout the patient’s entire life, a long history of motion intolerance, sensitivity to environmental stimuli, illusions of motion of the environment, and vertigo that awakens the patient.<ref name=emed/>

== Treatment ==
Treatment of migraine-associated vertigo is the same as the treatment for migraine in general.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fotuhi M, Glaun B, Quan SY, Sofare T |title=Vestibular migraine: a critical review of treatment trials |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=256 |issue=5 |pages=711–6 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19252785 |doi=10.1007/s00415-009-5050-5 }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of migraine and vertigo is 1.6 times higher in 200 dizziness clinic patients than in 200 age- and sex-matched controls from an orthopaedic clinic.  Among the patients with unclassified or idiopathic vertigo, the prevalence of migraine was shown to be elevated. In another study, migraine patients reported 2.5 times more vertigo and also 2.5 more dizzy spells during headache-free periods than the controls.<ref name="Lempert JN">{{cite journal |author=Lempert T, Neuhauser H |title=Epidemiology of vertigo, migraine and vestibular migraine |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=256 |issue=3 |pages=333–8 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=19225823 |doi=10.1007/s00415-009-0149-2}}</ref>

MAV may occur at any age with a female:male ratio of between 1.5 and 5:1.  Familial occurrence is not uncommon.  In most patients, migraine headaches begin earlier in life than MAV with years of headache-free periods before MAV manifests.<ref name="Lempert JN" />

In a diary study, the 1-month prevalence of MAV was 16%, frequency of MAV was higher and duration longer on days with headache, and MAV was a risk factor for co-morbid anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salhofer|first=S|coauthors=Lieba-Samal D, Freydl E, Bartl S, Wiest G, Wöber C|title=Migraine and vertigo--a prospective diary study|journal=Cephalalgia|date=2010|volume=30|pages=821–828|pmid=20647173|doi=10.1177/0333102409360676|issue=7}}</ref>
