The mission of ACOFP is "To promote excellence in osteopathic family medicine through quality education, visionary leadership and responsible advocacy."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acofp.org/About_ACOFP/Mission_History/ |title=Mission & History |author= |date= |work=ACOFP |publisher=American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians |accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
ACOFP was founded on February 11, 1950 in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It is headquartered in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois]].<ref name=ACOFPhx>{{cite book |last = |first = |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2003 |title=The Continuing History of the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians |publisher=ACOFP |url=http://www.acofp.org/uploadedFiles/ACOFP/About_ACOFP/ACOFP_History_Book.pdf|location = Arlington Heights, Illinois |id = }}</ref>

ACOFP was originally founded as the American College of General Practitioners in Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery. The organization quickly assumed the unofficial name of American College of Osteopathic General Practitioners. In 1993, the organization's name was officially changed to the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians. The first educational meeting was held in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] in 1958. The original headquarters and treasury office were located in California. After the merger between the California Osteopathic Association and the [[California Medical Association]] the funds possessed by ACOFP were turned over to the California Medical Society. ACOFP subsequently relocated its headquarters to Chicago.<ref name=ACOFPhx />

In the mid-1960s, about 4% of osteopathic physicians in the United States were members of the ACOFP. By 2003, membership rates were at 27% of osteopathic physicians. Since 1955, ACOFP has presented the award Family Practitioner of the Year.<ref name=ACOFPhx />

In March of 2012, ACOFP announced that they partnered with the company MDdatacor to provide physicians with the tools necessary to develop their practices into official patient-centered medical homes.<ref name=MarketWatch>{{cite news |title=MDdatacor and ACOFP Partner to Position Members for Medical Home |author= |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mddatacor-and-acofp-partner-to-position-members-for-medical-home-2012-03-27 |newspaper=MarketWatch |date=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=April 9, 2012}}
