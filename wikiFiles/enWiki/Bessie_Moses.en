'''Bessie Louise Moses''', M.D. (1893-1965) was a U.S. [[gynecologist]] and [[obstetrician]] who advocated [[birth control]] practices for women.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Maryland State Archives|title=Bessie Moses, M.D. (1893-1965)|work=Maryland Women’s Hall of Fame|url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/educ/exhibits/womenshall/html/moses.html|accessdate=September 22, 2009}}</ref>

Born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Moses graduated [[Goucher College]] in 1915<ref>http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/moses-bessie-louise</ref> and began her public career after graduating from [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]] in 1922.<ref>{{cite news|author=Melissa R. Klapper|title=Bessie Louise Moses: 1893-1965|title=Jewish Women’s Archive|url=http://qa.jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/moses-bessie-louise|accessdate=November 24, 2009}}</ref> She began private practice as an obstetrician, but this path proved ill-suited when she became emotionally attached to the outcome of every birth she attended, so she instead chose to pursue gynecology.<ref>Lucille Liberless Letter About Dr. Moses Personal Life, Not Dated, Planned Parenthood Collection, University of Baltimore Langsdale Library Special Collections, Baltimore, MD.</ref>  It was at this juncture of her career that Moses found her niche and her calling as Director of the Baltimore Bureau for Contraceptive Advice, which became the Baltimore Birth Control Clinic.

The Baltimore Bureau for Contraceptive Advice was incorporated in 1926, opened its doors to patients in 1927, and operated until 1932.<ref>Lauren P. Morton, “Baltimore’s First Birth Control Clinic: The Bureau for Contraceptive Advice, 1927-1932,” Maryland Historical Magazine 102, no. 4 (2007): 300.</ref>  The Bureau originally was set up as a public health research venture with strict rules about referral of patients for its services.<ref>Morton, pp. 302-305.</ref>  In order to avoid controversy and prosecution, the women who were referred to the clinic for participation in the study had to be married and their health in such a deteriorated state that further pregnancies could prove fatal.<ref>Morton, pp. 305-306.</ref>  As the social stigma and [[Comstock laws|legal proscription]] of disseminating contraceptive information and devices eased during the [[Great Depression]], the Bureau became the Baltimore Birth Control Clinic, which eventually became part of the [[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood Federation of America]].

From the inception of the Baltimore Bureau for Contraceptive Advice in 1927, through to her retirement in 1956, Moses was the medical director for these community resources.<ref>Maryland State Archives</ref>  Moses fought to expand contraceptive services to additional communities and lobbied for inclusion of contraceptive instruction in medical school curricula.<ref>Bessie L. Moses, Contraception as a Therapeutic Measure, (Baltimore, MD: Williams & Wilkins, 1936), 1-2.</ref>  She was integral in the fight for legislative reform of the prohibition of sending contraceptive information and materials through the mail.<ref>  Moses testified in a confidential hearing before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee of the Judiciary on a proposed amendment to the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act|Tariff Act of 1930]], which, among other things, made it illegal to send contraceptive devices and information through the mail.  See Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Birth Control: Hearings on S. 4436, 72nd Cong., 1st sess., 1932, 4-12, 14.</ref>  As a result of her contributions to legitimizing birth control through the avenue of public health, Moses was honored with the [[Lasker Award|Lasker Foundation Award]] in 1950, which she received along with [[Margaret Sanger]]. In 1991, she was posthumously added to the Maryland Women’s Hall of Fame.<ref>Klapper.</ref>
