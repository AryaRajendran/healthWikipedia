The '''apothecaries' system''' of weights is a historical system of [[mass]] units that were used by [[physician]]s and [[apothecary|apothecaries]] for medical recipes, and also sometimes by scientists.<ref name="riemann186">"Medicinal-Gewicht, Apotheker-Gewicht ist dasjenige Gewicht, nach welchem Aerzte und Apotheker die Quantitäten der Arzneimittel bestimmen. Nur an wenigen Orten werden beide Arten der Gewichte unterschieden und Medicinalgewicht bei dem Einkauf der Arzneiwaaren im Großen von dem Apothekergewicht bei der Anfertigung und dem Einzel-Verkauf in den Apotheken getrennt. In diesem Fall ist das Medicinalgewicht dem gewöhnlichen Landesgewicht beinahe oder völlig gleich und das Pfund wird dann in 16 Unzen getheilt.

The apothecaries' system often used the same ounces as the precious metals system, although even then the number of ounces in a pound could be different. The apothecaries' pound was divided into its own special units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]] and [[Galen]], 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries' weights and the normal commercial weights were different, it was not always clear which of the two systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it.<ref name=civilwar>"The writing and preparation of prescriptions employed the apothecary system of weights and measures.

The traditional English apothecaries' system of weights is as shown in the table, the pound, ounce and grain being identical to the [[troy pound]], ounce and grain.
In the United Kingdom, a reform in 1824 made the troy pound the primary weight unit (a role in which it was superseded half a century later by the Avoirdupois pound), but this had no effect on apothecaries' weights. However, the Medicinals Act of 1858 completely abolished the apothecaries' system in favour of the standard Avoirdupois system. In the United States, the apothecaries' system remained official until it was abolished in 1971 in favour of the metric system.

From the pound down to the scruple, the English apothecaries' system was a subset of the [[#Roman weight system|Roman weight system]] except that the troy pound and its subdivisions were slightly heavier than the Roman pound and its subdivisions. Similar systems were used all over Europe, but with considerable local variation described below under [[#Variants|Variants]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Zupko | first=Ronald Edward | authorlink=Ronald Edward Zupko | location=Maddison | year=1977 | title=British Weights & Measures: A History from Antiquity to the Seventeenth Century |publisher= The University of Wisconsin Press | isbn= 0-299-07340-8 | page=5 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pWUgAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> 

The English-speaking countries also used a system of units of fluid measure, or in modern terminology [[volume]] units, based on the apothecaries' system. A volume of liquid that was approximately that of an apothecaries' ounce of water was called a fluid ounce, and was divided into fluid drachms and sometimes also fluid scruples. The analogue of the grain was called a [[minim (unit)|minim]].
The [[imperial unit|Imperial]] and US systems differ in the size of the basic unit (the [[gallon]] or the [[pint]], one gallon being equal to eight pints), and in the number of fluid ounces per pint. Apothecaries' systems for volumes were internationally much less common than those for weights.<ref>E.g. a German handbook of medicine prescription from 1835 when describing the English system mentioned that no such system was in current use in Germany: "Von Maassen ist in Deutschland gegenwärtig […] fast nur noch das Quart […] gebräuchlich." {{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=rWcOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA99 | last=Phoebus | first=P. | title=Handbuch der Arzneiverordnungslehre | year=1836 | location=Berlin | volume=Vol. I | page=99}}</ref> Before introduction of the Imperial Units in the UK, all apothecaries' measures were based on the [[wine gallon]], which survived in the US under the name ''liquid gallon'' or ''wet gallon''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Brande | first=W.T. | title=A manual of chemistry | year=1830 | volume=Vol. I | url=http://books.google.com/?id=u79wbv8_TaEC&pg=RA1-PA490 | page=490 }}</ref>

The wine gallon was abolished in Britain in 1824, and this system was replaced by a new one based on the newly introduced Imperial gallon.<ref>{{cite book | last=Skinner | first=F.G. | location=London | year=1967 | title=Weights and Measures: their ancient origins and their development in Great Britain up to AD&nbsp;1855 | publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office | pages=106&ndash;109.}}</ref> Since the Imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, the same is true for the Imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% ''less'' than the US fluid ounce, and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.<ref name=medicaltimes>{{cite journal | year=1853 | journal=Medical Times | title=Weights and Measures | url=http://books.google.com/?id=uxsCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA312 }}</ref>

Apothecaries' measures eventually fell out of use in the UK and were officially abolished in 1971. In the US, they are still occasionally used, for example with prescribed medicine being sold in four ounce ({{unicode|℥}} iv) bottles.<ref>In 2002, the FDA recalled medicine sold in four ounce bottles because the measuring cup enclosed only had metric units.

==Medical recipes==
Until around 1900, medical recipes and most European [[pharmacopoeia]]s were written in Latin. Here is a typical example from the middle of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book | last=Ellis | first=Benjamin | year=1854 | edition=10th | title=Medical Formulary | location=Philadelphia | url=http://books.google.com/?id=AEgVrVQl9McC&pg=PA69 }}</ref>

The use of Latin ensured that the recipes could be read by an international audience. There was a technical reason why ''{{unicode|3&nbsp;ʒ}}'' was written ''{{unicode|ʒiij,}}'' and ''{{unicode|{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;ʒ}}'' as ''{{unicode|ʒß}}'' or ''{{unicode|ʒss}}'': The letters "ss" are an abbreviation for the Latin "semis" meaning "half", while the [[Sharp S]] ("ß") is an abbreviation for "ss".
In Apothecaries' Latin, numbers were generally written, in Roman numerals, immediately following the symbol. Since only the units of the apothecaries' system were used in this way, this made it clear that the civil weight system was not meant.<ref name=6000recipes>"As this abbreviation [referring to ''Lb.''] is used to represent both the avoirdupois, and troy or apothecaries' pound, it is necessary to observe, that the ''former'' is indicated when this sign is ''preceded'' by ''Arabic figures''; and the ''latter'', when it is followed by Roman numerals." {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=A cyclopaedia of six thousand practical receipts | last=Cooley | first=A.J. | year=1850 | title=Weights | pages=560 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f38EAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA561 }}</ref>

The basic form of the apothecaries' system is essentially a subset of the Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the ''marco'', a [[mark (mass)|mark]] of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of a pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight of a physical grain.

[[Image:Apothecaries weights 1800.png|thumb|300px|Map showing examples of the weight of 1 apothecaries' ounce in grammes around 1800, before metrication and the Prussian weight reform. The dashed lines indicate three different ways to subdivide the ounce.]]
It is most convenient to compare the various local weight standards by the metric weights of their ounces. The actual mass of an ounce varied by ±17% (5&nbsp;g) around the typical value of 30&nbsp;g. The table only shows approximate values for the most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25&nbsp;g to 31&nbsp;g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28&nbsp;g. But there is a relatively large gap between the troy ounces of 31&nbsp;g and the Habsburg ounce of 35&nbsp;g. The latter is the product of an 18th century weight reform.

Even in Turkey a system of weights similar to the European apothecaries' system was used for the same purpose. For medical purposes the tcheky (approx. 320&nbsp;g) was divided in 100 drachms, and the drachm in (16 killos or) 64 grains.<ref>{{cite book | last=Beasley | first=Henry | title=The Druggist's general receipt book | location=London| year=1850 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=DHYFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA396 | page=396 }}</ref><ref name=noback>{{cite book | location=Leipzig | title=Vollständiges Taschenbuch der Münz-, Maass- und Gewichtsverhältnisse | last=Noback | first=C. | coauthors=Noback, F. | year=1851 }} [http://books.google.com/books?id=GIMBAAAAQAAJ Volume 1] and [http://books.google.com/books?id=OYMBAAAAQAAJ Volume 2].</ref> This is close to the classical Greek weight system, where a ''mina'' (corresponding roughly to a Roman ''libra'') was also divided into 100 drachms.<ref>"The Greek weights, mentioned by Roman authors, are chiefly the ''talent'', divided into 60 ''minæ'', and the ''mina'' into 100 ''drachmæ.''

With the beginning of metrication, some countries standardized their apothecaries' pound to an easily remembered multiple of the French [[gramme]].<ref>"Bayern […] hat schon im Jahre 1811 nicht nur sein Civilgewicht in eine sehr zweckmäßige Übereinstimmung mit dem französischen Grammengewicht gebracht, sondern auch sein Medicinalgewicht genau nach dem neu eingeführten Civilgericht reguliert […], wonach das Medicinalpfund (= 360 Grammes) sich zu dem Civilpfunde (= 560 Grammes) […] wie 9:14 verhält […]." "[…] ob es nicht besser wäre, das Medicinalgewicht nach diesem zu reguliren und das Apothekerpfund auf genau drei Viertheile des Zollpfunds festzustellen?" {{cite journal | url=http://books.google.com/?id=CJIDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA715#PPA713,M1 | last=Seeger | title=Vorschlag zu Abänderung unseres gegenwärtigen bestehenden und zu Einführung eines gemeinsamen teutschen Medicinalgewichts | pages=p. 713–724 | journal=Vereinigte deutsche Zeitschrift für die Staatsarzneikunde | year=1847 }}</ref> E.g. in the Netherlands the Dutch troy pound of 369.1&nbsp;g was standardized in 1820 to 375.000&nbsp;g, to match a similar reform in France. The British troy pound retained its value of 373.202&nbsp;g until in 2000 it was legally defined in metric terms, as 373.2417216&nbsp;g.<ref>Schedule 1 of [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=weights+and+measures+act&Year=1985&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&TYPE=QS&NavFrom=0&activeTextDocId=2191980&PageNumber=1&SortAlpha=0 Weight and Measurements Act 1985], as amended in 2000 by the Units of Measurement Regulations 1994.</ref> (At this time its use was already illegal for all purposes except trading precious metals.)

===Basic variants===
In the [[Romance language|Romance]] speaking part of Europe the scruple was divided in 24&nbsp;grains, in the rest of Europe in 20&nbsp;grains.

The Sicilian apothecaries' ounce was divided in 10&nbsp;drachms. Since the scruple was divided in only 20&nbsp;grains, like in the northern countries, an ounce consisted of 600&nbsp;grains. This was not too different from the situation in most of the other mediterranean countries, where an ounce consisted of 576&nbsp;grains.<ref name=phoebus />

In France, at some stage the apothecaries' pound of 12&nbsp;ounces was replaced by the larger civil pound of 16&nbsp;ounces. The subdivisions of the apothecaries' ounce were the same as in the other Romance countries, however, and were different from the subdivisions of the otherwise identical civil ounce.

{{See also|Ancient Roman units of measurement}}
The basic apothecaries' system consists of the units pound, ounce and scruple from the classical Roman weight system, together with the originally Greek drachm and a new subdivision of the scruple into either 20 ("barley") or 24 ("wheat") grains ({{lang-la|grana}}). In some countries other units of the original system remained in use, for example in Spain the ''obolo'' and ''siliqua''. In some cases the apothecaries' and civil weight systems had the same ounces ("an ounce is an ounce"), but the civil pound consisted of 16 ounces. ''Siliqua'' is Latin for the seed of the [[carob]] tree.

Many attempts were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45&nbsp;g, but one should keep in mind that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was reformed by [[Charlemagne]], but in the [[Byzantine Empire]] it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to [[Scandinavia]], the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.

The history of mediaeval medicine started roughly around the year 1000 with the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|school of medicine in Salerno]], which combined elements of Latin, Greek, Arabic and Jewish medicine. [[Galen]] and [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]] (who had used the Graeco-Roman weight system) were among the most important authorities, but also Arabic physicians, whose works were systematically translated into Latin.

According to ''De ponderibus et mensuris'', a famous 13th century text that exists in numerous variations and is often ascribed to [[Dino di Garbo]], the system of weights used in Salerno was different from the systems used in Padua and Bologna. As can be seen from the table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides and from all modern apothecaries' systems: The ounce was divided into 9&nbsp;drachms, rather than 8&nbsp;drachms.

Centuries later, the region around [[Salerno]] was the only exception to the rule that (except for skipping units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple in exactly the same way as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10&nbsp;drachms.

==Romance countries==
While there will naturally have been some changes throughout the centuries, this section only tries to give a general overview over the situation that was recorded in detail in numerous 19th century merchants' handbooks.

;Iberian Peninsula
On the [[Iberian Peninsula]], apothecaries' weights in the 19th century were relatively uniform, with 24&nbsp;grains per scruple (576&nbsp;grains per ounce), the standard in Romance countries. The weight of an apothecaries' pound was 345.1&nbsp;g in [[Spain]] and 344.2&nbsp;g in [[Portugal]]. As in Italy, some of the additional subdivisions of the Roman system, such as the ''obolo'', were still in use there. It was standard to use the ''marco'', defined as 8&nbsp;ounces, instead of the pound.<ref name=phoebus /><ref name=hille>{{cite journal | last=Hille | first=K.C. | title=Medicinal-Gewicht | pages=p. 268 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=BfI3AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA268 | journal=Magazin für Pharmacie und die dahin einschlagenden Wissenschaften | year=1831 | location=Heidelberg }}</ref>

;France
In 18th century [[France]], there was a national weight standard, the ''marc de Paris'' of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, and it was also used as the apothecaries' pound.<ref>Skinner (1967), Page 88, gives the pound as 489.41 gm.</ref> With 30.6&nbsp;g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under [[#Weight standards named after Troyes|Weight standards named after Troyes]].

;Italy
Due in part to the political conditions in what would become a united [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] only in 1861, the variation of apothecaries' systems and standard weights in this region was enormous. (For background information, see [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification]].) The ''libbra'' (pound) generally consisted of the standard twelve ounces, however.

The civil weight systems were generally very similar to the apothecaries' system, and since the ''libbra'' (or the ''libbra sottile'', where different systems were in use for light and heavy goods) generally had a suitable weight for an apothecaries' pound it was often used for this purpose. Extreme cases were [[Rome]] and [[Genoa]], where the same system was used for everything, including medicine. On the other hand there were relatively large differences even between two cities in the same state. E.g. [[Bologna]] (in the [[Papal States]]) had an apothecaries' pound that was less than the local civil pound, and 4% lighter than the pound used in Rome.

The weight of an apothecaries' pound ranged generally between 300&nbsp;g and 320&nbsp;g, slightly less than that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]] was under rule of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' pound of 420&nbsp;g. (See below under [[#Habsburg standard|Habsburg standard]].) E.g. in the large city of [[Milan]] the apothecaries' system based on a pound of 326.8&nbsp;g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]]. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in [[France]] the ''système usuel'' had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.<ref name=noback /><ref name=alexander>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=LnUAAAAAMAAJ | title=Universal Dictionary of Weights and Measures, Ancient and Modern | last=Alexander | first=J.H. | year=1850 | location=Baltimore }}</ref>

The apothecaries' pound in [[Venice]] had exactly the same subdivisions as those in the non-Romance countries, but its total weight of 301&nbsp;g was at the bottom of the range. During the Habsburg reign of 1814–1859 an exception was made for Venice; as a result the extreme weights of 301&nbsp;g and 420&nbsp;g coexisted within one state and in immediate proximity. The Venice standard was also used elsewhere, for example in [[Udine]]. In [[Dubrovnik]] (called "Ragusa" until 1909) its use was partially continued for a long time in spite of the official Habsburg weight reform.<ref name=noback />

The measure and weight systems for the large mainland part of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the [[Italian Peninsula]] and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries' weight in the unified system was essentially the same as that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the ounce was divided in 10&nbsp;drachms, rather than the usual&nbsp;8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike in the rest of the Romance region, was divided into 20&nbsp;grains. The existence of a unit called ''aureo'', the equivalent of 1½ ''dramme'', is interesting because 6 ''aurei'' were 9 ''dramme''. In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an ''aureo'' would have been ⅙ of an ounce.<ref name=noback /><ref name=loephoe />

As early as 1147 in [[Troyes]] in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] (in the Middle Ages an important trading town) a unit of weight called ''marc de Troyes'' was used.<ref>"Par ailleurs, une unité de poids, le marc de Troyes, apparaît en 1147." {{cite web | url=http://lamop.univ-paris1.fr/baudin/foires/foires.htm | last=Baudin | first=Arnaud | title=Le comté de Champagne et de Brie au Moyen Âge – Les foires de Champagne | publisher=Laboratoire de Médiévistique Occidentale de Paris }}</ref>

The national [[France|French]] standard until 1799 was based on a famous artefact called the ''Pile de Charlemagne'', which probably dates back to the second half of the 15th century. It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238&nbsp;''kg''. The set is now shown in the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris.<ref>A photograph of the ''Pile de Charlemagne'' is shown on the website of the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]], under the rubric [http://arts-et-metiers.net/musee.php?P=37&id=43&lang=ang School visits / L'aventure du mètre].</ref> The total nominal value of the set is 50 ''marcs de Troyes'' or ''marcs de Paris'', a mark being 8&nbsp;ounces.

It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the [[French Revolution]], the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries' pound in the French apothecaries' system, which otherwise remained a standard system of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.

In [[Bruges]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Antwerpen]] and other [[Flanders|Flemish]] cities, a "troy" unit ("trooisch pond") was also in use as a standard for valuable materials and medicine. As in France, the way in which the Flemish troy ounce was subdivided depended on what was weighed. Unlike the French, the Flemish apothecaries divided the scruple in 20 grains. The Flemish troy pound became the standard for the gold and apothecaries' system in the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]; it was also used in this way in [[Lübeck]]. (The London troy pound was referred to as the 'trooisch pond', after metrification.) 

The Dutch troy mark consisted <ref>Merchant's Assistant Or Mercantile Instructer (1834)</ref> of 8 Flemish troy ounces, with each ounce of 20 engels, and each engel divided into 32 assen. The Amsterdam Pound of two marks, used in commerce, weighed 10,280 assen, while the Amsterdam Troy pound weighed 10,240 assen, i.e. exactly two troy marks.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica volume 20, 1823</ref><ref>A course of lectures on natural philosophy and the mechanical arts - Thomas Young 1807</ref>

In 1414, six years before the [[Treaty of Troyes]], a statute of [[Henry V of England]] gave directions to the goldsmiths in terms of the [[troy pound]]. (In 1304 it had apparently not yet been introduced, since it did not appear in the statute of weights and measures.) There is evidence from the 15th century that the troy pound was used for weighing metals and spices.<ref name=wms /> After the abolishment of the [[Tower pound]] in 1527 by [[Henry VIII of England]], the troy pound was the official basis for English coin weights. The British apothecaries' system was based on the troy pound until metrication, and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.

Since the modern (English, American and Imperial) troy ounces are roughly 1.5% heavier than the late Paris ounce, the exact historical relations between the original ''marc de Troyes'', the French ''poids de marc'', the Flemish trooisch pond and the English troy pound are unclear. It is known, however, that the numerical relation between the English and French troy ounces was ''exactly'' 64:63 in the 14th century.<ref name=wms /><ref name=troy18>{{cite journal | last=Simpson | first=A.D.C. | coauthors=Connor, R.D. | title=The mass of the English troy pound in the eighteenth century | journal=Annals of Science | year=2004 | pages=321–349 | doi=10.1080/0003379032000159431 | volume=61 | issue=3 }}</ref>

In the Middle Ages the [[Imperial Free City]] of [[Nuremberg]], an important trading place in the south of Germany, produced large amounts of nesting weight pieces to various European standards.<ref name=wms /> In the 1540s, the first [[pharmacopoeia]] in the modern sense was also printed there.

However, some cities kept local copies of the standard.

As of 1800 all German states and cities except [[Lübeck]] (which had the Dutch troy standard) followed the Nuremberg standard. It was also the standard for [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], the [[Russian Empire]] and most cantons of [[Switzerland]]. [[Poland]] and [[Sweden]] had their own variants of the standard, which differed from each other by 0.6%.

In 1811, [[Bavaria]] legally defined the apothecaries' pound as 360.00&nbsp;g (an ounce of 30.00&nbsp;g). In 1815, [[Nuremberg]] lost its status as a free city and became part of Bavaria. From now on the Nuremberg apothecaries' pound was no longer the official apothecaries' pound in Nuremberg; but the difference was only 0.6%.

Empress [[Maria Theresia of Austria]] reformed the measures and weights of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] in 1761.<ref name=hille /> The weight of an apothecaries' pound of 12 ounces was increased to a value that was later (after the kilogramme was defined) found to be 420.009&nbsp;g; this was called the ''libra medicinalis major''. It was defined as <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of the unusually heavy Habsburg civil pound (defined as <sup>6</sup>/<sub>5</sub> of the civil pound of [[Cologne]]) and corresponded to a record ounce weight of 35&nbsp;g.

Before the reform, in the north of the empire the Nuremberg standard had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the [[pharmacopoeia]] ''Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense'' still used the Nuremberg standard ''libra medicinalis minor'', indicating that even in the [[Austria]]n capital [[Vienna]] it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the ''Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis'' used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.<ref name="oeaz" />

Venice was not part of these reforms and kept its standard of approximately 25&nbsp;g per ounce.

When Austria started producing scales and weight pieces to the new standard with an excellent quality/price ratio, these were occasionally used by German apothecaries as well.

==Metrication==

At the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the fact that each state had its own system of weights and measures became increasingly problematic. Serious work on a "scientific" system was started in [[France]] under [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and completed in 1799 (after the [[French Revolution]]) with its implementation. The French population, however, was initially unhappy with the new system. In 1812, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] reintroduced some of the old measures and weights, but in a modified form that was defined with respect to the metric system. This ''système usuel'' was finally abolished in 1837 and became illegal in 1840.

Due to the large expansion of the [[First French Empire]] under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], French metrication also affected what would be (parts of) France's neighbour countries after the [[Congress of Vienna]].

The Netherlands were partially metricated when they were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full metrication, effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the trooisch pond. The apothecaries' new pound was 375.00&nbsp;g. Apart from rounding issues concerning the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French ''système usuel''. (The reform was not followed in the north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the trooisch pond.) In Belgium, apothecaries' weight was metricized effective 1856.<ref name=upton>{{cite paper | last=Upton | first=J.K. | year=1878 | url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/upton-1878-03-06.html | title=Report on worldwide state of metrication to the US House of Representatives }}</ref>

Between 1803 and 1815 all German regions west of the [[River Rhine]] were French, organised in the ''[[département]]s'' [[Roer (department)|Roer]], [[Sarre (department)|Sarre]], [[Rhin-et-Moselle]], and [[Mont-Tonnerre]]. As a result of the Congress of Vienna these became part of various German states. A large part of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] fell to [[Bavaria]], but having the metric system it was excepted from the Bavarian reform of weights and measures.

In [[Prussia]], a reform in 1816 defined the Prussian civil pound in terms of the Prussian foot and distilled water. It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, of the civil pound: 350.78&nbsp;g.<ref name=hille /><ref name="trommsdorff" /><ref>"Im Preußischen ist der Unterschied zwischen Civil- und Medicinalgewicht durch eine Verordnung vom 16. Mai 1816 aufgehoben." {{cite book | year=1829 | page=151 | title=Encyclopädisches Wörterbuch der medicinischen Wissenschaften | url=http://books.google.com/?id=OhoDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA151 | author1=Wörterbuch, EnzyklopäDisches }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://books.google.com/?id=eDgDAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA594 | journal=Allgemeine preussische Staatszeitung | year=1838 | title=Ueber Maasse und Gewichte, veranlasst durch die Schrift des Herrn Adelfeld über die Maasse und Gewichte der deutschen Zollvereinsstaaten | last=Hoffmann | first=Johann Gottfried}}</ref> This reform was not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries' pound in Germany at a time when a German national state was beginning to form. It seems that many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Archiv und Zeitung des Apotheker-Vereins in Norddeutschland | year=1848 | author=Geffcken | pages=p. 217–226 | title=Bericht über die Lübecker Kreisversammlung des norddeutschen Apotheker-Vereins am 6. August 1848 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=Kfc3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA217 }} (The relevant passage is in a quoted summary of an earlier report.)</ref>

Another reform in 1856 increased the civil pound from 467.711&nbsp;g to 500.000&nbsp;g (the German civil pound defined by the [[Zollverein]]), as a first step towards [[metrication]]. As a consequence the official apothecaries' pound was now 375.000&nbsp;g, i.e. it was increased by 7%, and it was now very close to the troy standards. §4 of the law that introduced this reform said: "Further, a pharmaceutical weight deviating from the civil weight does not take place." But this paragraph was suspended until further notice.<ref>"§4. Ein von dem Handelsgewichte abweichendes Medizinalgewicht findet ferner nicht statt. […] §8. […] Der Zeitpunkt, mit welchem die Vorschrift im §4. in Kraft treten soll, wird durch Königliche Verordnung festgesetzt werden." [http://books.google.com/books?id=gLkNAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA113 Gesetz, betreffend die Einführung des allgemeinen Landesgewichts in den Hohenzollernschen Landen. Vom 26. März 1860.]</ref>

The abolishment of the apothecaries' system meant that doctors' prescriptions had to take place in terms of the current civil weight: grammes and kilograms. This was considered unfeasible by many, and the state received numerous protests and asked for expertises.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://books.google.com/?id=3wkDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA82 | title=Die Normalgaben der Arzneien nach dem Unzen- und Grammen-Gewicht, zugleich als Repetitorium der Arzneimittellehre, von Dr. F.L.

Britain was initially involved in the development of the metric system, and the US was among the 17 initial signatories of the [[Metre Convention]] in 1875. Yet in spite of enthusiastic support for the new system by intellectuals such as [[Charles Dickens]], these two countries were particularly slow to implement it.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Dickens | first=Charles | title=At your fingers' ends | year=1863 | journal=All the year round | url=http://books.google.com/?id=RdUNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA233 }}</ref>

To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 introduced a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound.<ref name=dublin /> To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35&nbsp;g, the proposed system was very similar to that in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk).<ref name=6000recipes /><ref>{{cite book | title= A manual of chemistry | last=Brande | first=W.T. | year=1830 | edition=3rd | volume=Vol. I | location=London | url=http://books.google.com/?id=u79wbv8_TaEC&pg=RA1-PA489 | page=489 }}</ref> Therefore it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.<ref name=medicaltimes /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Medical lexicon – A dictionary of medical science | location=Philadelphia | title=Weight | page=979 | year=1860 | last=Dunglison | first=Robley | authorlink=Robley Dunglison | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zgqN7_Kn3tEC&pg=RA11-PA979 }}</ref>

The Irish proposal was not widely adopted, but British legislation, in the form of the Medicinals Act 1858, was more radical: It prescribed the use of the avoirdupois system for the United Kingdom (then including Ireland), with none of the traditional subdivisions. This innovation was first used in the united British pharmacopœia of 1864.<ref>{{cite book | last=Squire | first=P. | year=1867 | title=A companion to the British pharmacopœia | page=xvi | url=http://books.google.com/?id=pRgDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP20 | nopp=true }}</ref> In practice the old apothecaries' system based on the troy pound was still widely used, however, until it was abolished by the Weights and Measures Act of 1976. Since then it can only be used to measure precious metals and stones. (The [[troy pound]] was already declared illegal for most other uses by the Weights and Measures Act of 1878.)

In the US, the metric system replaced the apothecaries' system in the US Pharmacopoeia of 1971.
