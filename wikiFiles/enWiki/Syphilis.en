'''Syphilis''' is a [[sexually transmitted infection]] caused by the [[spirochete]] bacterium ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' subspecies ''pallidum''. The primary route of transmission is through [[Human sexual activity|sexual contact]]; it may also be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in [[congenital syphilis]]. Other human diseases caused by related ''Treponema pallidum'' include [[yaws]] (subspecies ''pertenue''), [[Pinta (disease)|pinta]] (subspecies ''carateum''), and [[Nonvenereal endemic syphilis|bejel]] (subspecies ''endemicum'').

The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single [[chancre]] (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration), secondary syphilis with a diffuse rash which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, latent syphilis with little to no symptoms, and tertiary syphilis with [[Gumma (pathology)|gummas]], neurological, or cardiac symptoms. It has, however, been known as "the great imitator" due to its frequent atypical presentations. Diagnosis is usually via [[serological testing|blood tests]]; however, the bacteria can also be detected using [[dark field microscopy]]. Syphilis can be effectively treated with [[antibiotics]], specifically the preferred intramuscular [[penicillin G]] (given intravenously for neurosyphilis), or else [[ceftriaxone]], and in those who have a severe penicillin allergy, oral [[doxycycline]] or [[azithromycin]].

Syphilis is thought to have infected 12 million people worldwide in 1999, with greater than 90% of cases in the [[developing world]]. After decreasing dramatically since the widespread availability of penicillin in the 1940s, rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries, often in combination with [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). This has been attributed partly to unsafe sexual practices among [[men who have sex with men]], increased [[promiscuity]], [[prostitution]], and decreasing use of [[condoms]].<ref name="Coffin2010">{{cite journal|last=Coffin|first=LS|coauthors=Newberry, A, Hagan, H, Cleland, CM, Des Jarlais, DC, Perlman, DC|title=Syphilis in Drug Users in Low and Middle Income Countries|journal=The International journal on drug policy|date=January 2010|volume=21|issue=1|pages=20–7|pmid=19361976|doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2009.02.008|pmc=2790553}}</ref><ref name="Gao2009">{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=L|coauthors=Zhang, L, Jin, Q|title=Meta-analysis: prevalence of HIV infection and syphilis among MSM in China|journal=Sexually transmitted infections|date=September 2009|volume=85|issue=5|pages=354–8|pmid=19351623|doi=10.1136/sti.2008.034702}}</ref><ref name="Karp2009">{{cite journal|last=Karp|first=G|coauthors=Schlaeffer, F, Jotkowitz, A, Riesenberg, K|title=Syphilis and HIV co-infection|journal=European journal of internal medicine|date=January 2009|volume=20|issue=1|pages=9–13|pmid=19237085|doi=10.1016/j.ejim.2008.04.002}}</ref>

[[image:2ndsyphil2.jpg|thumb|Reddish [[papules]] and [[Nodule (dermatology)#Primary lesions|nodules]] over much of the body due to secondary syphilis]]
Secondary syphilis occurs approximately four to ten weeks after the primary infection.<ref name=Kent08/> While secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest, symptoms most commonly involve the skin, [[mucous membranes]], and [[lymph nodes]].<ref name=Sec2010/> There may be a symmetrical, reddish-pink, non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities, including the palms and soles.<ref name=Kent08/><ref name=2darySyphilis>{{cite journal | author=Dylewski J, Duong M | title=The rash of secondary syphilis | journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal | date= 2 January 2007 | volume=176 | issue=1 | pages=33–5 | doi= 10.1503/cmaj.060665 | pmid=17200385 | pmc=1764588}}</ref> The rash may become [[maculopapular]] or [[Abscess|pustular]].<!-- Kent08 --> It may form flat, broad, whitish, wart-like lesions known as [[condyloma latum]] on [[mucous membrane]]s.<!-- Kent08 --> All of these lesions harbor bacteria and are infectious.<!-- Kent08 --> Other symptoms may include [[fever]], [[sore throat]], [[malaise]], [[weight loss]], [[hair loss]], and [[headache]].<ref name=Kent08/> Rare manifestations include [[hepatitis]], [[kidney]] disease, [[arthritis]], [[periostitis]], [[optic neuritis]], [[uveitis]], and [[interstitial keratitis]].<ref name=Kent08/><ref name=Eye07/> The acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks;<ref name=Eye07/> however, about 25% of people may present with a recurrence of secondary symptoms.<!-- Sec2010 --> Many people who present with secondary syphilis (40–85% of women, 20–65% of men) do not report previously having had the classic chancre of primary syphilis.<ref name=Sec2010>{{cite journal|last=Mullooly|first=C|coauthors=Higgins, SP|title=Secondary syphilis: the classical triad of skin rash, mucosal ulceration and lymphadenopathy|journal=International journal of STD & AIDS|date=August 2010|volume=21|issue=8|pages=537–45|pmid=20975084|doi=10.1258/ijsa.2010.010243}}</ref>

===Latent===
Latent syphilis is defined as having [[serology|serologic]] proof of infection without symptoms of disease.<ref name=RedBookSyphilis/> It is further described as either early (less than 1&nbsp;year after secondary syphilis) or late (more than 1&nbsp;year after secondary syphilis) in the United States.<ref name=Eye07/> The United Kingdom uses a cut-off of two years for early and late latent syphilis.<ref name=Pri2008/> Early latent syphilis may have a relapse of symptoms.<!-- Eye07 --> Late latent syphilis is [[asymptomatic]], and not as contagious as early latent syphilis.<ref name=Eye07/>

===Tertiary===

Tertiary syphilis may occur approximately 3 to 15 years after the initial infection, and may be divided into three different forms: gummatous syphilis (15%), late [[neurosyphilis]] (6.5%), and cardiovascular syphilis (10%).<ref name=Kent08/><ref name=Eye07/> Without treatment, a third of infected people develop tertiary disease.<ref name=Eye07/> People with tertiary syphilis are not infectious.<ref name=Kent08/>
[[File:Tertiary syphilis head.JPG|thumb|left |upright |Patient with tertiary (gummatous) syphilis. Bust in [[Musée de l'Homme]], Paris.]]
Gummatous syphilis or late [[benignity|benign]] syphilis usually occurs 1 to 46&nbsp;years after the initial infection, with an average of 15&nbsp;years.<!-- Kent08 --> This stage is characterized by the formation of chronic [[Gumma (pathology)|gummas]], which are soft, tumor-like balls of inflammation which may vary considerably in size.<!-- Kent08 --> They typically affect the skin, bone, and liver, but can occur anywhere.<ref name=Kent08/>

[[Neurosyphilis]] refers to an infection involving the [[central nervous system]]. It may occur early, being either asymptomatic or in the form of syphilitic [[meningitis]], or late as meningovascular syphilis, [[general paresis]], or [[tabes dorsalis]], which is associated with poor balance and lightning pains in the lower extremities.<!-- Kent08 --> Late neurosyphilis typically occurs 4 to 25 years after the initial infection.<!-- Kent08 --> Meningovascular syphilis typically presents with apathy and [[seizure]], and general paresis with [[dementia]] and [[tabes dorsalis]].<ref name=Kent08/> Also, there may be [[Argyll Robertson pupil]]s, which are bilateral small pupils that constrict when the person focuses on near objects, but do not constrict when exposed to bright light.

Cardiovascular syphilis usually occurs 10–30&nbsp;years after the initial infection.<!-- Kent08 --> The most common complication is [[syphilitic aortitis]], which may result in [[aortic aneurysm|aneurysm]] formation.<ref name=Kent08/>

===Congenital===
[[Congenital syphilis]] may occur during pregnancy or during birth.<!-- Wood09 --> Two-thirds of syphilitic infants are born without symptoms.<!-- Wood09 --> Common symptoms that then develop over the first couple years of life include: [[hepatosplenomegaly]] (70%), rash (70%), fever (40%), neurosyphilis (20%), and [[pneumonitis]] (20%).<!-- Wood09 --> If untreated, [[late congenital syphilis]] may occur in 40%, including: [[saddle nose]] deformation, [[Higoumenakis sign]], [[saber shin]], or [[Clutton's joints]] among others.<ref name=Wood09/>

==Cause==
===Bacteriology===
[[File:Treponema pallidum 01.png|thumb|Histopathology of ''Treponema pallidum'' spirochetes using a modified Steiner silver stain]]
{{Main|Treponema pallidum}}
''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies'' pallidum'' is a spiral-shaped, [[Gram-negative]], highly mobile bacterium.<ref name=Pri2008/><ref name=Music08/> Three other human diseases are caused by related ''Treponema pallidum'', including [[yaws]] (subspecies ''pertenue''), [[Pinta (disease)|pinta]] (subspecies ''carateum'') and [[Nonvenereal endemic syphilis|bejel]] (subspecies ''endemicum'').<ref name=Kent08/> Unlike subtype ''pallidum'', they do not cause neurological disease.<ref name=Wood09>{{cite journal |author=Woods CR|title=Congenital syphilis-persisting pestilence|journal=Pediatr.

===Transmission===
Syphilis is transmitted primarily by sexual contact or during [[pregnancy]] from a mother to her [[fetus]]; the spirochaete is able to pass through intact mucous membranes or compromised skin.<ref name=Kent08/><ref name=ST10>{{cite journal |author=Stamm LV |title=Global Challenge of Antibiotic-Resistant Treponema pallidum |journal=Antimicrob.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Syphilis false shame and fear may destroy your future.png|thumb|right|Poster for testing of syphilis, showing a man and a woman bowing their heads in shame (''circa'' 1936)]]
Syphilis is difficult to diagnose clinically early in its presentation.<ref name=Pri2008/> Confirmation is either via [[blood tests]] or direct visual inspection using [[microscopy]].<!-- Kent08 --> Blood tests are more commonly used, as they are easier to perform.<ref name=Kent08/> Diagnostic tests are, however, unable to distinguish between the stages of the disease.<ref name= Orgin10/>

===Blood tests===
Blood tests are divided into [[Nontreponemal tests for syphilis|nontreponemal]] and treponemal tests.<ref name=Pri2008/> Nontreponemal tests are used initially, and include [[venereal disease research laboratory]] (VDRL) and [[rapid plasma reagin]] tests. However, as these tests are occasionally [[False positive#Type I error|false positives]], confirmation is required with a treponemal test, such as [[treponemal pallidum particle agglutination]] (TPHA) or [[fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test]] (FTA-Abs).<ref name=Kent08/> False positives on the nontreponemal tests can occur with some viral infections such as [[varicella]] and [[measles]], as well as with [[lymphoma]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], [[endocarditis]], [[connective tissue disease]], and [[pregnancy]].<ref name=RedBookSyphilis/> Treponemal antibody tests usually become positive two to five weeks after the initial infection.<ref name=Pri2008/> Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of [[leukocytes]] (predominately [[lymphocytes]]) and high protein levels in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] in the setting of a known syphilis infection.<ref name=Kent08/><ref name=RedBookSyphilis/>

===Direct testing===
[[Dark field microscopy|Dark ground microscopy]] of [[serous fluid]] from a chancre may be used to make an immediate diagnosis.<!-- Pri2008 --> However, hospitals do not always have equipment or experienced staff members, whereas testing must be done within 10&nbsp;minutes of acquiring the sample.<!-- Pri2008 --> [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] has been reported to be nearly 80%, thus can only be used to confirm a diagnosis but not rule one out.<!-- Pri2008 --> Two other tests can be carried out on a sample from the chancre: [[direct fluorescent antibody]] testing and [[Polymerase chain reaction|nucleic acid amplification]] tests.<!-- Pri2008 --> Direct fluorescent testing uses [[antibodies]] tagged with [[fluorescein]], which attach to specific syphilis proteins, while nucleic acid amplification uses techniques, such as the [[polymerase chain reaction]], to detect the presence of specific syphilis genes.<!-- Pri2008 --> These tests are not as time-sensitive, as they do not require living bacteria to make the diagnosis.<ref name=Pri2008/>

==Prevention==
{{As of|2010}}, there is no vaccine effective for prevention.<ref name=ST10/> Abstinence from intimate physical contact with an infected person is effective at reducing the transmission of syphilis, as is the proper use of a [[latex condom]]. Condom use, however, does not completely eliminate the risk.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Koss CA, Dunne EF, Warner L |title=A systematic review of epidemiologic studies assessing condom use and risk of syphilis |journal=Sex Transm Dis |volume=36 |issue=7 |pages=401–5 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19455075 |doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181a396eb |url=}}</ref><ref name="CDC Fact Sheet" /> Thus, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner and the avoidance of substances such as [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and other drugs that increase risky sexual behavior.<ref name="CDC Fact Sheet" />

Syphilis was very common in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries.<!-- Music08 --> In the developed world during the early 20th century, infections declined rapidly with the widespread use of [[antibiotic]]s, until the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=Music08/> Since the year 2000, rates of syphilis have been increasing in the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia and Europe, primarily among men who have sex with men.<ref name=ST10/> Rates of syphilis among American women have, however, remained stable during this time, and rates among UK women have increased, but at a rate less than that of men.<ref name=AOP08>{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=ME|coauthors=Romanelli, F|title=Reexamining syphilis: an update on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management|journal=The Annals of pharmacotherapy|date=February 2008|volume=42|issue=2|pages=226–36|pmid=18212261|doi=10.1345/aph.1K086}}</ref> Increased rates among heterosexuals have occurred in China and Russia since the 1990s.<ref name=ST10/> This has been attributed to unsafe sexual practices, such as sexual promiscuity, prostitution, and decreasing use of barrier protection.<ref name=ST10/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ficarra|first=G|coauthors=Carlos, R|title=Syphilis: The Renaissance of an Old Disease with Oral Implications|journal=Head and neck pathology|date=September 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=195–206|pmid=20596972|doi=10.1007/s12105-009-0127-0|pmc=2811633}}</ref><ref name=AOP08/>

Untreated, it has a mortality of 8% to 58%, with a greater death rate in males.<ref name=Kent08/> The symptoms of syphilis have become less severe over the 19th and 20th&nbsp;centuries, in part due to widespread availability of effective treatment and partly due to decreasing [[virulence]] of the spirochaete.<ref name=Sec2010/> With early treatment, few complications result.<ref name=Pri2008/> Syphilis increases the risk of HIV transmission by two to five times, and coinfection is common (30–60% in a number of urban centers).<ref name=Kent08/><ref name=ST10/>

The exact origin of syphilis is disputed.<ref name=Kent08/>  Syphilis was indisputably present in the Americas before European contact.  The dispute is over whether or not syphilis was also present elsewhere in the world at that time.  One of the two primary hypotheses proposes that syphilis was carried from the Americas to Europe by the returning crewmen from [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyage to the [[Americas]].  The other hypothesis says that syphilis existed in Europe previously, but went unrecognized until shortly after Columbus' return.<!-- Orgin10 --> These are referred to as the ''Columbian'' and ''pre-Columbian'' hypotheses, respectively.<ref name=Orgin10>{{cite journal|last=Farhi|first=D|coauthors=Dupin, N|title=Origins of syphilis and management in the immunocompetent patient: facts and controversies |journal=Clinics in Dermatology |date=September 2010-Oct |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=533–8 |pmid=20797514 |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2010.03.011}}</ref> The Columbian hypothesis is best supported by the available evidence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rothschild|first=BM |title=History of syphilis |journal=Clinical infectious diseases: an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=15 May 2005 |volume=40|issue=10|pages=1454–63 |pmid=15844068 |doi=10.1086/429626}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Harper|first=KN|coauthors=Zuckerman, MK; Harper, ML; Kingston, JD; Armelagos, GJ |title=The origin and antiquity of syphilis revisited: an appraisal of Old World pre-Columbian evidence for treponemal infection.|journal=American journal of physical anthropology|year=2011|volume=146 Suppl 53|pages=99–133|pmid=22101689}}</ref> The first written records of an outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1494 or 1495 in [[Naples|Naples, Italy]], during a French invasion.<ref name=Music08>{{cite journal|last=Franzen|first=C|title=Syphilis in composers and musicians--Mozart, Beethoven, Paganini, Schubert, Schumann, Smetana|journal=European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases |date=December 2008|volume=27|issue=12|pages=1151–7|pmid=18592279|doi=10.1007/s10096-008-0571-x}}</ref><ref name=Orgin10/> Due to its being spread by returning French troops, it was initially known as the "French disease."

===Arts and literature===
[[File:400Behandlung der Syphilis.jpg|thumb|The earliest known medical illustration of patients suffering from syphilis, Vienna, 1498]]
The earliest known depiction of an individual with syphilis is [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''Syphilitic Man'', a woodcut believed to represent a [[Landsknecht]], a Northern European [[mercenary]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eisler|first=CT|title=Who is Dürer's "Syphilitic Man"?|journal=Perspectives in biology and medicine|date=2009 Winter|volume=52|issue=1|pages=48–60|pmid=19168944|doi=10.1353/pbm.0.0065}}</ref> The myth of the ''[[femme fatale]]'' or "poison women" of the 19th century is believed to be partly derived from the devastation of syphilis, with classic examples in literature including [[John Keats]]' ''[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=Things I didn't know : a memoir|year=2007|publisher=Vintage|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-38598-7|pages=346|edition=1st Vintage Book}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=[ed]: Joanne Entwistle, Elizabeth|title=Body dressing|year=2005|publisher=Berg Publishers|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-85973-444-5|pages=205|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}</ref>

The artist [[Jan van der Straet]] painted a scene of a wealthy man receiving treatment for syphilis with the tropical wood [[guaiacum]] sometime around 1580.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Basil A.|title=Myths and realities of Caribbean history|year=2009|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=978-0-8173-5534-0|pages=113|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KtT0_P-9xiAC&pg=PA113|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}</ref> The title of the work is "Preparation and Use of Guayaco for Treating Syphilis". That the artist chose to include this image in a series of works celebrating the New World indicates how important a treatment, however ineffective, for syphilis was to the European elite at that time. The richly colored and detailed work depicts four servants preparing the concoction while a physician looks on, hiding something behind his back while the hapless patient drinks.<ref name="ALLPOSTERS">[http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Preparation-and-Use-of-Guayaco-for-Treating-Syphilis-Posters_i1587366_.htm "Preparation and Use of Guayaco for Treating Syphilis"].

===Tuskegee and Guatemala studies===
{{See also|Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Syphilis experiments in Guatemala}}
One of the most infamous United States cases of questionable [[medical ethics]] in the 20th&nbsp;century was the [[Tuskegee syphilis study]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Katz RV|title=The Tuskegee Legacy Project: Willingness of Minorities to Participate in Biomedical Research |journal=J Health Care Poor Underserved |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=698–715|year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17242525 |pmc=1780164 |doi=10.1353/hpu.2006.0126 |url= |author-separator=, |author2=Kegeles SS |author3=Kressin NR |display-authors=3 |last4=Green |first4=B.

By 1947, penicillin had been validated as an effective cure for syphilis and was becoming widely used to treat the disease.<!-- CDCTime --> Study directors, however, continued the study and did not offer the participants treatment with penicillin.<ref name=CDCTime/> This is debated, and some have found that penicillin was given to many of the subjects.<ref name="TUS00"/> The study did not end until 1972.<ref name=CDCTime/>

Syphilis experiments were also carried out in [[Guatemala]] from 1946 to 1948. They were [[United States]]-sponsored [[human subject research|human experiments]], conducted during the government of [[Juan José Arévalo]] with the cooperation of some Guatemalan health ministries and officials. Doctors infected soldiers, prisoners, and [[mental patient]]s with syphilis and other [[sexually transmitted diseases]], without the [[informed consent]] of the subjects, and then treated them with [[antibiotic]]s. In October 2010, the U.S. formally apologized to Guatemala for conducting these experiments.<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=U.S. apologizes for newly revealed syphilis experiments done in Guatemala|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100104457.html |quote=The United States revealed on Friday that the government conducted medical experiments in the 1940s in which doctors infected soldiers, prisoners and mental patients in Guatemala with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases.|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>
