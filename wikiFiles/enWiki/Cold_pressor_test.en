'''Introduction of "cold pressor test"''' - The '''cold pressor''' test is a [[cardiovascular]] test performed by immersing the hand into an [[ice water]] container, usually for one minute, and measuring changes in [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]]. Its response is clinically indicative concerning [[vascular]] response and [[pulse]] excitability. 

Other measures can also be obtained from the cold pressor such as [[pain threshold]] and [[pain tolerance]].<ref name="SexDiffsPain">{{cite journal|last=Daniel Lowery, Roger B. Fillingim, and Rex A.

Once [[pain]] is present, they let the researcher know.  Once the pain is unbearable, the participant removes his/her hand.  This provides a measure of threshold (first feeling pain) and tolerance (total time minus threshold).  This method is the most frequently used application of the cold pressor task. Comparable in terms of pain elicitation is the [[hot water immersion test]], the equivalent to the cold pressor using hot water. The hot water immersion test (HIT) is equally capable of triggering a pain response without the [[confounding]] of [[baroreflex]] activation.<ref name=" painful hand immersion">{{cite journal|last=Anouk Streff, Linn K.

== Physiology ==

Sensory afferent nerves trigger a systemic sympathetic activation leading to marked [[vasoconstriction]]. The result is an elevated [[pulse pressure]] (normal is 40mm Hg), due to [[catecholamine]] release.  This increased pressure fills the ventricle to a greater extent, but [[stroke volume]] decreases due to an increase in [[afterload]].
