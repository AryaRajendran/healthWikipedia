'''Light therapy''' or '''phototherapy''' (classically referred to as '''heliotherapy''') consists of exposure to daylight or to specific wavelengths of light using [[laser]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[fluorescent lamp]]s, [[dichroic]] lamps or very bright, [[full-spectrum light]], usually controlled with various devices. The light is administered for a prescribed amount of time and, in some cases, at a specific time of day.

Common use of the term is associated with the treatment of skin disorders (chiefly [[psoriasis]]), sleep disorder and some psychiatric disorders. Light therapy directed at the skin is also used to treat [[acne vulgaris]], [[eczema]] and [[neonatal jaundice]]. Light therapy which strikes the [[retina]] of the eyes is used to treat [[circadian rhythm]] disorders such as [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] and can also be used to treat [[seasonal affective disorder]], with some support for its use also with non-seasonal psychiatric disorders.

Other medical applications of light therapy also include accelerated [[wound healing]], [[hair growth]]{{fact|date=August 2012}}, improvement in blood properties and [[blood circulation]], and [[sinus]]-related diseases and disorders. Many of these use [[low level laser therapy]] and red light therapy in the 620–660&nbsp;nm range.

==Indications==
===Skin conditions===

Two forms of phototherapy exist, non-targeted phototherapy (from sunlight, a tanning booth or a light box), and targeted-phototherapy, in which light is administered to a specific, localized area of the skin.  Current targeted phototherapy is administered via excimer laser, elemental gas lamp, or via LED light. Current FDA cleared devices on the market include XTRAC excimer laser,<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf4/k041943.pdf</ref> BClear,<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf2/k020591.pdf</ref> Theralight,<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf2/k024020.pdf</ref> and Psoria-Light LED phototherapy.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf10/K103540.pdf</ref>  Targeted phototherapy is only administered to the affected skin, not the entire body, thus sparing healthy skin from UV rays which may lead to other health issues including [[skin cancer]].  With targeted phototherapy only being administered to the affected area of skin, more intense dosages of light can be administered, allowing skin conditions to be repaired in less time.  As of early 2012, the only FDA-cleared device to offer both UVA and NB-UVB treatment within one device is the Psoria-Light.

====Psoriasis====
{{main|Psoriasis}}
Three percent of the population suffer from psoriasis, and UVB phototherapy has been shown to effectively treat the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Diffey BL | year = 1980 | title = Ultraviolet radiation physics and the skin | url = | journal = Phys. Med. Biol. | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 405–426 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/25/3/001 | pmid = 6996006 }}</ref>
A feature of psoriasis is localized inflammation mediated by the [[immune system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalbug.com/what-is-psoriasis-what-causes-psoriasis/|title=What is Psoriasis: What Causes Psoriasis?|date=29 January 2012|accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref> [[Ultraviolet]] radiation is known to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammatory responses. Light therapy for skin conditions like psoriasis use [[UV-A]] (315–400&nbsp;nm wavelength) or [[UV-B]] (280–315&nbsp;nm wavelength) light waves. UV-A, combined with [[psoralen]], a drug taken orally, is known as [[PUVA]] treatment. In UVB Phototherapy the exposure time is very short (1–2 minutes with Broadband UVB lamps and 5–15 minutes with Narrowband UVB lamps). The time must be controlled with a timer that turns off the lamps after the treatment time ends. Too-long exposure results in burning of the skin; this is analogous to over exposure to sunlight.

====Vitiligo====
One percent of the population suffer from [[vitiligo]], and Narrowband UVB Phototherapy is an effective treatment.
"NB-UVB phototherapy results in satisfactory repigmentation in our vitiligo patients and should be offered as a treatment option."
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21901949

====Acne vulgaris====
{{main|Acne vulgaris}}
Sunlight was long known to improve acne, and this was thought to be due to antibacterial and other effects of the ultraviolet spectrum which cannot be used as a long-term treatment due to the likelihood of skin damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/uv/health/en/ |title=Health effects of UV radiation |accessdate=2010-02-23 |work=Ultraviolet radiation and the INTERSUN Programme |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>

It was found that some of the visible violet light present in sunlight (in the range 415–430&nbsp;nm) activates a [[porphyrin]] (Coproporphyrin III) in ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'' which damages and ultimately kills the bacteria by releasing singlet oxygen. A total of 320&nbsp;[[Fluence|J/cm<sup>2</sup>]] of light within this range renders the bacteria non-viable.<ref name="british">{{cite journal |author= Papageorgiou P, Katsambas A, Chu A |title=Phototherapy with blue (415 nm) and red (660 nm) light in the treatment of acne vulgaris |journal=Br.

Dr. Yoram Harth ''et al.''  were the first  that  issued a patent  on the use  of  UV  free high  intensity Blue light  for the  treatment of  acne.  (United States Patent; 6,835,202
Harth,   et al., December 28, 2004, Filed January 9, 2001, Apparatus and method for high energy photodynamic therapy of acne vulgaris and seborrhea).  Based on this patent, and  a clinical study, the FDA  approved for the first time a medical device for the treatment of  mild to moderate  acne (Clearlight, by CureLIght Medical inc., FDA approval, 510K 013623, August 7, 2002).  In 2003,  a group at  Bar Ilan University  in Israel,  proved  in  lab condition the  eradication of  the  acne bacteria  by  exposure  to blue light. (	Eradication of Propionibacterium acnes by its endogenic porphyrins after illumination with high intensity blue light. Ashkenazi H, Malik Z, Harth Y, Nitzan Y. FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol 2003 Jan 21 35:1 17–24.)  Later  in 2003  a  peer reviewed clinical  study  proved  in the  first  time  the clinical  effect  of  blue light on  acne  lesions. (The effective treatment of acne vulgaris by a high-intensity, narrow band 405–420&nbsp;nm light source. Elman M, Harth Y, Slatkine M. J Cosmet Laser Ther. 2003 Jun;5(2):111-7.) 

Since there are few porphyrins naturally found in the skin, the treatment is believed safe except in patients with [[porphyria]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/DERM/topic145.htm |publisher=[[eMedicine]] |title=Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria |last=Hebel |first=JL |coauthors=Poh-Fitzpatrick, MB |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref> although eye protection is used due to light-sensitive chemicals in the retina. The first FDA approved blue light system, Clearlight, by CureLIght Medical Inc., was  based on metal halide lamps custom made to emit most of its energy at 405–420&nbsp;nm; other  blue light systems use LEDs.  Overall improvements of on average 76% for 80% of patients occurs over three months; most studies show that it performs better than [[benzoyl peroxide]] and the treatment is far better tolerated. However, approximately 10% of users see no improvement.<ref name="british"/>

====Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma====
The use of ultraviolet light therapy has been proven to be effective in treating [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]], including [[mycosis fungoides]].<ref name="ACS">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/HerbsVitaminsandMinerals/light-therapy?sitearea=ETO|title=Light Therapy|date=14 April 2011|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref>

====Other skin conditions====
Phototherapy can be effective in the treatment of [[eczema]], [[atopic dermatitis]], [[polymorphous light eruption]] and [[lichen planus]]. 
Narrowband UVB lamps, 311–313 nanometer is the most common treatment.

====Wound healing====
{{main|Wound healing}}
Some case studies<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.WON.0000308628.60958.d9 |author=Sutterfield R |title=Light therapy and advanced wound care for a neuropathic plantar ulcer on a Charcot foot |journal=J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=113–115 |date=2008 Jan–Feb |pmid=18199948}}[http://www.nursingcenter.com/Library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=767846]</ref> have found low-level laser light to be possibly helpful as an adjunctive treatment in wound healing, although a review of the overall scientific literature<ref name="laser therapy">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.2005.31086 |author=Posten W, Wrone DA, Dover JS, Arndt KA, Silapunt S, Alam M |title=Low-level laser therapy for wound healing: mechanism and efficacy |journal=Dermatol Surg |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=334–40 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15841638}}</ref> does not support the use of low-level laser therapy for this purpose.

===Mood and sleep related===
====Seasonal affective disorder====
{{main|Seasonal affective disorder}}
While full [[sunlight]] is preferred for [[seasonal affective disorder]] (SAD){{citation needed|date=January 2011}}, light boxes may be effective for the treatment of the condition.

====Circadian rhythm sleep disorder====
{{main|Circadian rhythm sleep disorder}}
;Chronic CRSD
In the management of [[circadian rhythm]] disorders such as [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] (DSPS), the timing of light exposure is critical. For DSPS, the light must be provided to the retina as soon after spontaneous awakening as possible to achieve the desired effect, as shown by the [[phase response curve]] for light in humans. Some users have reported success with lights that turn on shortly ''before'' awakening ([[dawn simulation]]). Morning use may also be effective for [[non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome]], while evening use is recommended for [[advanced sleep phase syndrome]].

A common treatment of neonatal jaundice is the [[bili light]].

==Techniques==
===Photodynamic therapy===
{{main|Photodynamic therapy}}

Photodynamic therapy is a form of phototherapy using nontoxic light-sensitive compounds that are exposed selectively to light, whereupon they become toxic to targeted malignant and other diseased cells

One of the treatments is using blue light with [[photodynamic therapy|aminolevulinic acid]] for the treatment of [[actinic keratosis]]. This is not a U.S. FDA-approved treatment for acne vulgaris.<ref>[http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/600_699/0656.html Aetna policy bulletin re: Phototherapy for Acne]</ref>

===Light boxes===
[[File:Light therapy lamp and sunlight.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The brightness and [[color temperature]] of light from a lightbox are quite similar to daylight.]]

The production of the hormone melatonin, a sleep regulator, is inhibited by light and permitted by darkness as registered by [[photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina. To some degree, the reverse is true for [[serotonin]], which has been linked to mood disorders. Hence, for the purpose of manipulating [[melatonin]] levels or timing, light boxes providing very specific types of artificial [[lighting|illumination]] to the retina of the eye are effective.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Light therapy either uses a lightbox which emits up to 10,000 [[lux]] of light, much brighter than a customary incandescent lamp, or a lower intensity of specific wavelengths of light from the blue (470 [[nanometer|nm]]) to the green (525&nbsp;nm) areas of the [[visible spectrum]].<ref name="pmid14962066">{{cite journal |author=Wright HR, Lack LC, Kennaway DJ. |title=Differential effects of light wavelength in phase advancing the melatonin rhythm |journal=J.

In treatment, the patient's eyes are to be at a prescribed distance from the light source with the light striking the retina. This does not require looking directly into the light.

Considering three major factors – clinical efficacy, ocular and dermatologic safety, and visual comfort – CET recommends the following criteria for light box selection:<ref>{{cite web|title=Light Box Selection|url=http://www.cet.org/eng/Therapy_LightboxSelection_ENG.html|work=Center for Environmental Therapeutics|publisher=CET|accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> 
* Light boxes should have been tested successfully in peer-reviewed clinical trials.
* The box should provide 10,000 LUX of illumination at a comfortable sitting distance. Product specifications are often missing or unverified.
* Fluorescent lamps should have a smooth diffusing screen that filters out ultraviolet (UV) rays. UV rays are harmful to the eyes and skin.
* The lamps should give off white light rather than colored light. "Full spectrum" lamps and blue (or bluish) lamps provide no known therapeutic advantage.
* The light should be projected downward toward the eyes at an angle to minimize aversive visual glare.
* Smaller is not better; when using a compact light box, even small head movements will take the eyes out of the therapeutic range of the light.

==Risks and complications==
[[Ultraviolet]] light causes progressive damage to human skin.{{cn|date=January 2013}} This is mediated by genetic damage, collagen damage, as well as destruction of [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin C]] in the skin and free radical generation.{{cn|date=January 2013}} Ultraviolet light is also known to be a factor in formation of [[cataract]]s.{{cn|date=January 2013}} Researchers have questioned whether limiting blue light exposure could reduce the risk of [[Macular degeneration#Age-related macular degeneration|age-related macular degeneration]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Glazer-Hockstein C, Dunaief JL |title=Could blue light-blocking lenses decrease the risk of age-related macular degeneration? |journal=Retina (Philadelphia, Pa.) |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16395131 |doi=10.1097/00006982-200601000-00001}}</ref>

Modern phototherapy lamps used in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder and [[sleep disorder]]s either filter out or do not emit ultraviolet light and are considered safe and effective for the intended purpose, as long as photosensitizing drugs are not being taken at the same time and in the absence of any existing eye conditions. Light therapy is a mood altering treatment, and just as with drug treatments, there is a possibility of triggering a manic state from a depressive state, causing anxiety and other side effects. While these side effects are usually controllable, it is recommended that patients undertake light therapy under the supervision of an experienced clinician, rather than attempting to self-medicate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Terman M, Terman JS |title=Light therapy for seasonal and nonseasonal depression: efficacy, protocol, safety, and side effects |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=647–63; quiz 672 |date=August 2005 |pmid=16041296}}</ref>

There are few absolute contraindications to light therapy, although there are some circumstances in which caution is required. These include when a patient has a condition that might render his or her eyes more vulnerable to [[phototoxicity]], has a tendency toward mania, has a photosensitive skin condition, or is taking a photosensitizing herb (such as [[St. John's wort]]) or medication.<ref>{{cite web |title=Light Therapy Diagnostic Indications and Contraindications |url=http://www.health.am/psy/more/light_therapy1/ |publisher=American Medical Network |accessdate=2009-06-09 |date=2007-12-08 |last=Gagarina |first=AK}}</ref> Patients with [[porphyria]] should avoid most forms of light therapy. Patients on certain drugs such as [[methotrexate]] or [[chloroquine]] should use caution with light therapy as there is a chance that these drugs could cause porphyria.

===Side effects===
Side effects of light therapy for sleep phase disorders include jumpiness or jitteriness, headache, and nausea{{fact|date=August 2012}}. Some nondepressive physical complaints (such as poor vision and skin rash or irritation) may improve with light therapy.<ref name=AMN1>{{cite web |author=Roger DR |url=http://www.health.am/psy/more/light_therapy4/ |title=Practical aspects of light therapy |accessdate=2009-06-09 |date=2007-12-04 |publisher=American Medical Network}}</ref>

==History==
Many ancient cultures practiced various forms of heliotherapy, including people of the [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]], and [[Ancient Rome]].<ref>F. Ellinger ''Medical Radiation Biology'' Springfield 1957</ref> The [[Inca]], [[Assyria]]n and early [[German people|German]] settlers also worshipped the sun as a health bringing deity. Indian medical literature dating to 1500 BC describes a treatment combining herbs with natural sunlight to treat non-pigmented skin areas. Buddhist literature from about 200 AD and 10th-century Chinese documents made similar references.

Faroese physician [[Niels Ryberg Finsen|Niels Finsen]] is believed to be the father of modern phototherapy. He developed the first artificial light source for this purpose, and used his invention to treat [[lupus vulgaris]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1903.

Since then a large array of treatments have been developed from the use of controlled light. Though the popular consumer understanding of "light therapy" is associated with treating [[seasonal affective disorder]] and skin conditions like [[psoriasis]], other applications include the application of [[low level laser therapy|low level laser]], [[red]] light, near-[[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] lights for [[pain management]], [[hair growth]]{{fact|date=August 2012}}, skin treatments, and accelerated wound healing.
