Sometimes called ''South American blastomycosis'', paracoccidioidomycosis is caused by a different fungus than that which causes [[blastomycosis]].

== Agent==
''P. brasiliensis'' is a thermally-dimorphic fungus distributed in [[Brazil]] and [[South America]]. The habitat of the infectious agent is not known but appears to be aquatic. In [[biopsies]] the fungus appears as a polygemulating<!-- not a real word? --> yeast with a pilot's wheel-like appearance.

== Disease==
Paracoccidioidomycosis is a [[systemic mycosis]] caused by the dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides. It frequently involves [[mucous membrane]]s, [[lymph node]]s, bone and lungs. Unlike other systemic mycoses, it can cause disease in immunocompetent hosts, although immunosuppression increases the aggressiveness of the fungus. Also uniquely, it rarely causes disease in fertile-age women, probably due to a protective effect of estradiol.<ref name="pmid17655417">{{Citation |author=Severo LC, Roesch EW, Oliveira EA, Rocha MM, Londero AT |title=Paracoccidioidomycosis in women |journal=Rev Iberoam Micol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=88–9 |year=1998 |month=June |pmid=17655417 |doi= |url=http://www.reviberoammicol.com/pubmed_linkout.php?15p88 |postscript=.}}</ref>

Primary infection is thought to be autolimited and almost asymptomatic as [[histoplasmosis]] or [[coccidioidomycosis]] (Valley Fever). In young people, there is a progressive form of the disease (akin of tuberculous [[septicemia]] in tuberculous priminfection) with high prostrating fever, generalized [[lymphadenopathy]] and pulmonary involvement with milliary lesions. This juvenile form has a more severe prognosis even with treatment. The most common form is the so called adult form of paracoccidioidomycosis that is almost certainly a reactivation of the disease.

Painful lesions with a violaceous hue in lips and oral mucosa are common as is cervical lymphadenitis teeming with polygemulating yeasts in the biopsy. In this form, differential diagnosis must be made with mucocutaneous [[leishmaniasis]], [[yaws]] and [[Tuberculosis|TB]].

[[Pulmonary]] involvement is also common, it starts as [[lobar pneumonia]] or [[pleurisy]] but without remission at ninth day; the patient remains [[febrile]], [[cough]]s, [[loses weight]] and the [[X rays]] reveal milliary shadows throughout lung fields. Other organs can be involved, like bones, [[meninges]], arteries and [[spleen]] but this is very rare.

Diagnosis is made with a biopsy of affected tissue, this shows the characteristic helm-shaped yeasts and culture shows the agent. Serology is also used in endemic areas.

== Treatment==
[[sulfonamide (medicine)|Sulfonamides]] are the traditional remedies to paracoccidiodomycosis. They were introduced by Oliveira Ribeiro and used for more than fifty years with good results. The most used [[sulfa drugs]] in this infection are sulfadimethoxime, [[sulfadiazine]] and [[co-trimoxazole]]. This treatment is generally safe but several adverse effects can appear, the most severe of which are the [[Stevens Johnson Syndrome]] and [[agranulocytosis]]. Similarly to [[tuberculosis]] treatment, it must be continued for up to 3 years to eradicate the fungus, and relapse and treatment failures aren't unusual.

Antifungal drugs like [[amphotericin B]] or [[itraconazole]] and [[ketoconazole]] are more effective in clearing the infection but limited by their cost when compared with sulfonamides.

During therapy [[fibrosis]] can appear and a surgery be needed to correct this. Other possible complication is Addisonian crisis. The death rate is approximately ten percent.
