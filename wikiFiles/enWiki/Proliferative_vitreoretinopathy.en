'''Proliferative Vitreo Retinopathy''' ('''PVR''') is a disease that develops as a complication, secondary to rhegmatogenous [[retinal detachment]]. PVR occurs in about 8–10% of patients undergoing primary retinal detachment surgery and prevents the successful surgical repair of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. PVR can be treated with surgery to reattach the detached [[retina]] but the visual outcome of the surgery is very poor.<ref>

PVR was originally referred to as '''massive vitreous retraction''' and then as '''massive periretinal proliferation'''. The name Proliferative vitreo retinopathy was provided in 1989 by the [[Silicone Oil Study group]]. The name is derived from ''proliferation'' (by the [[retinal pigment epithelium|retinal pigment epithelial]] and [[glial cell]]s) and ''vitreo retinopathy'' to include the tissues which are affected, namely the [[vitreous humor]] (or simply vitreous) and the [[retina]].<ref>

==Pathology==

During rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, fluid from the [[vitreous humor]] enters a retinal hole. The mechanisms by which retinal holes or tears form are not fully understood yet. The accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space and the tractional force of the vitreous on the retina result in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. During this process the retinal cell layers come in contact with vitreous cytokines. These cytokines trigger the ability of the [[retinal pigmented epithelium]] (RPE) to proliferate and migrate. The process involved resembles fibrotic wound healing by the RPE cells. The RPE cells undergo [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]] (EMT) and develop the ability to migrate out into the vitreous. During this process the RPE cell layer-neural retinal adhesion and RPE-ECM ([[extracellular matrix]]) adhesions are lost. The RPE cells lay down fibrotic membranes while they migrate and these membranes contract and pull at the retina. All these finally lead to secondary retinal detachment after primary retinal detachment surgery.

PVR is graded as Grade A, B, or C by the Silicone Oil Study and as Grade A, B, C, or D by the [[Retina Society Terminology Committee]].<ref>

*Grade A is characterized by the appearance of vitreous haze and RPE cells in the vitreous.
*Grade B is characterized by wrinkling of the edges of the retinal tear or the inner retinal surface.
*Grade C is characterized by the presence of retinal membranes.

==Retinal membranes==

The RPE cells migrate out into the vitreous, proliferate excessively and lay down ECM on both side sides of the detached retina. The ECM laid on the vitreous side of the retina are referred to as [[epiretinal membrane|epiretinal]] or [[preretinal membrane]]s and those laid down between the RPE layer and the photoreceptors are referred to as [[subretinal membrane|subretinal]] or [[retroretinal membrane]]s. The two membranes differ in composition in that the ERM is composed of RPE cells, glial cells, [[macrophage]]s and [[fibrocyte]]s, while the SRM is rich in RPE cells. The subretinal membranes are of two types. One forms as diffuse sheets, which are not contractile and either lack or contain very little ECM. The presence of this type of membrane does not usually affect retinal reattachment surgery. The retina can be reattached even with the membrane in place. The other type forms as very thick contractile membranes which pull at the retina. These are opaque and block the light falling on the retina so the retinal reattachment surgery needs to be performed after manually peeling the membrane off.<ref>

==Cytokines involved in PVR==

A number of cytokines such as [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNFα), [[transforming growth factor]] beta 2 (TGFβ<sub>2</sub>), [[platelet derived growth factor]] (PDGF) and [[interleukins]] have been shown to play a role in PVR progression.

TGFβ<sub>2</sub> levels have been shown to be elevated up to three times normal during the progression of PVR. TGFβ<sub>2</sub> is the most predominant [[isoform]] in the eye and is secreted as a latent inactive [[peptide]] into the vitreous by epithelial cells of the [[ciliary body]] and the [[lens epithelium]] and is also produced by the RPE cells and the [[Muller cell]]s of the retina. TGFβ<sub>2</sub> is known to induce EMT in RPE cells and fibrosis in the eye.<ref>
