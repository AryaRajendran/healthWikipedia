'''Corneal Perforation''' is an anomaly in the cornea resulting from damage to the corneal surface.  A corneal perforation means that the cornea has been penetrated, thus leaving the cornea damaged.<br />
The [[cornea]] is a clear part of the eye which controls and focuses the entry of light into the eye.  Damage to the cornea due to corneal perforation can cause decreased visual acuity.  

==Causes==
*Diseases that cause progressive corneal thinning.
*Accidents during eye surgery, that results in scraping or injury of the cornea.
*Infection of the cornea post eye surgery.

==Indications==
*Difficulty in seeing.
*Discoloration of the cornea.
*Persistent eye pain.

==Diagnosis==
Corneal perforation can be diagnosed by using the [[Seidel test]].  Any aqueous leakage is revealed during the Seidel test confirms corneal perforation.  A fluorescence strip is wiped over the wound.   If the clear aqueous humor from the eye runs through the yellow stain, the patient tests positive for corneal perforation.

==Treatment==
The treatment of corneal perforation depends on the location, severity and the cause of damage
*Tissue adhesive can be used to seal small perforation, but this method cannot be used to treat perforations larger than 1&nbsp;mm.
*Non infected corneal perforation generally heals when a pressure bandage is used.
*For certain types of corneal perforations, [[lamellar keratoplasty]] is used as treatment.
