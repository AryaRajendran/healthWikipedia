'''Poikiloderma vasculare atrophicans''' (PVA), sometimes referred to as '''parapsoriasis variegata'''<ref name="Howard"/> or '''parapsoriasis lichenoides'''<ref>{{DiseasesDB|10208}}</ref> is a cutaneous condition ([[skin disease]]) characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation (diminished or heightened skin [[pigment]]ation, respectively), [[telangiectasia]] and skin [[wikt:atrophy|atrophy]].<ref name=pva75>{{cite pmid|1103107}}</ref><ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author=Rapini, Ronald P.; Bolognia, Jean L.; Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0}}</ref><ref name="pmid7026622">{{cite journal |author=Lambert WC, Everett MA |title=The nosology of parapsoriasis |journal=J.

Mycosis fungoides, a type of skin [[lymphoma]], may be a cause of PVA. The condition may also be caused by, associated with or accompany any of the following conditions or disorders: other skin [[lymphoma]]s, [[dermatomyositis]], [[lupus erythematosus]], [[Rothmund-Thompson syndrome]], [[Kindler syndrome]], [[dyskeratosis congenita]], and [[chronic radiodermatitis]].<ref name="Bolognia"/> Rare causes include [[arsenic]] ingestion, and the condition can also be [[idiopathic]].<ref name="Howard">{{cite journal |author=Howard MS, Smoller BR |title=Mycosis fungoides: classic disease and variant presentations |journal=Seminars in cutaneous medicine and surgery |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=91–99  |month=Jun |year=2000  |pmid=10892710 |doi=10.1016/S1085-5629(00)80005-X |pmc= }}</ref><ref name=pva75/><ref name="pmid7026622"/><ref name="pmid7026622"/> 

PVA may be considered a rare variant of [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]], a [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma|non-Hodgkin's]] form of [[lymphoma]] affecting the skin.<ref name=pvalymph/> It may also be included among a number of similar conditions that are considered as precursors to [[mycosis fungoides]]. PVA is believed to be a syndrome closely associated with [[large-plaque parapsoriasis]] and its cohort [[retiform parapsoriasis]]; including PVA, all three conditions fit within an updated view of the once ambiguous classification scheme known as [[parapsoriasis]].<ref name="pmid7026622"/>

== Classification ==
Poikiloderma vasculare atrophicans, or PVA, indicates that extra or altered skin pigmentation ("[[poikiloderma]]")<ref name=pdef>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15908 |title=A definition of the term "poikiloderma" from Medterms.com |accessdate=Dec. 28, 2009}}</ref> is occurring, associated with heightened visibity of [[capillary|capillaries]] ("[[wikt:vascularity|vasculare]]", referring to telangiectasia) under the skin, related to thinning and wasting away ("[[wikt:atrophy|atrophicans]]") of the skin and its [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]. Telangiectasia is an enlargement of capillaries underneath the skin.<ref name=pdef/> 

PVA also has common names that include parapsoriasis-related terminology (i.e. parapsoriasis variagata, or "[[wikt:variegated|variegated]]" parapsoriasis).<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Parapsoriasis is a term first used by Brocq in 1902,<ref name=brocq>{{cite journal |author=Brocq L |title=Les parapsoriasis |journal=Ann Dermatol Syphiligr (Paris) |volume=3 |pages=433–468 |year=1902}}</ref> intended to represent a group comprising a number of uncommon skin disorders, under a once used, now antiquated classification scheme for all inflammatory dermatoses (skin diseases known to be associated with or cause inflammation).<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Brocq chose the term "parapsoriasis" to illustrate that the dermatoses placed in this group had or would have commonalities with psoriasiasis, including appearance and chronicity (lifelong or indefinite duration).<ref name="pmid7026622"/>  This poorly designated grouping has led to confusion in establishing a [[nosology]] (a method of classifying diseases and disorders) that associated or distinguished these disorders, and through the years differing opinions and uses regarding parapsoriasis by both authors and physicians has caused further confusion.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> In more recent times, after much discussion and growing consensus, parapsoriasis and its terminology has been revisited and re-examined often. Newer thought on parapsoriasis, such as by Sutton (1956)<ref name=s56>{{cite book |author=Sutton RL |title=Diseases of the skin |publisher=The C. V. Mosby Co. |year=1956 |location=St. Louis, Mo. |pages=936–941}}</ref>  all the way to that by Sehgal, ''et al.'' (2007)<ref name=se07>{{cite pmid|17975354}}</ref> has cleared much of the confusion and has sparked increased understanding of parapsoriasis and its constituents.

PVA fits within this updated view of parapsoriasis as a syndrome often associated with large plaque parapsoriasis and, or including its variant form, retiform parapsoriasis.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Additionally, it may be considered a precursor or variant of the lymphomatous skin disorder mycosis fungoides, which is also associated with large plaque parapsoriasis.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Large plaque parapsoriasis consists of inflamed, oddly discolored (such as yellow or blue), web-patterned and scaling plaques on the skin, {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} or larger in diameter.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> When the condition of the skin encompassed by these plaques worsens and becomes atrophic, it is typically considered retiform parapsoriasis.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> PVA can occur in either the large plaque or retiform stage, but it can only be considered PVA when its three constituents (poikiloderma, telangiectasia, atrophy) are present.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> PVA is therefore considered an independent syndrome identified by its constituents, wherever it occurs.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> 

In modern consideration and usage, the solitary term "poikiloderma" has also come to represent all three elements of PVA.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> When skin diseases and disorders or skin conditions described as dermatoses contain the term poikiloderma in their assessment or diagnosis (such as with [[Bloom syndrome]]), this can sometimes be an erroneous usage of the term.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Discretion has been advised.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Usage of the entire term "poikiloderma vasculare atrophicans" may also be reserved to indicate it as the primary condition affecting the skin in cases where the disorder associated with it is secondary.<ref name="pmid7026622"/>

== Characteristics ==
{{Double image|right|Skinlayers.png|200|Illu_skin02.jpg|250|The layers of the epidermis (left). Melanocytes (rlght), located in the bottom epidermal layer, produce melanin.|||}} 
PVA can be characterized by speckled, combined hyper- and hypopigmentation in the plaques or patches of affected skin.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Hyperpigmentation is excess coloration, or darkening of the skin,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/hyperpigmentation.html |accessdate=Feb. 6, 2010 |title=A definition of the term "hyperpigmentation" from Aocd.com }}</ref> while hypopigmentation is a diminished or palid coloring to the skin. Pigmentation changes in PVA, apparent in the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] (outermost) skin layer, may be attributed to incontinence (leaking out) of [[melanin]] from [[melanocyte]]s into the [[dermis|dermal]] skin layer below.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Inflammation of the skin and cutaneous tissue, common with PVA,<ref name=pvalymph/> also contributes to color changes in the skin, typified by redness. Telangiectasia, the visible [[circulatory system|"vascular"]] element of PVA, is the [[wikt:dilation|dilation]] of small blood vessels near the skin surface.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Skin atrophy, a wasting-away of the tissue comprising the skin, is a prominent part of PVA and effects the dermal, and particularly the epidermal layer.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> This, in part, is the result of degenerative [[wikt:liquefaction|liquefaction]] of the [[Stratum germinativum|stratum basale]] (bottom cell-layer) of the epidermis.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Atrophy of the skin gives it a thin, dry and wrinkled appearance, which in PVA-affected individuals has been described as "cigarette paper".<ref name=pvalymph/> [[Hyperkeratosis]], a thickening of the [[stratum corneum]] (top cell-layer of the epidermis), has also been reported.<ref name="pmid7026622"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-information/hyperkeratosis-what-is-it.aspx |title=A definition of the term "hyperkeratosis" from Everydayhealth.com |accessdate=Feb. 6, 2010}}</ref>

== Cause ==
PVA usually always has an underlying cause, attributed to existing skin diseases and disorders associated with a cutaneous lymphoma or inflammation.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Mycosis fungoides is the common lymphoma believed to cause PVA, although it may be considered a precursor when the lymphoma is [[wikt:occult|occult]] (hidden) and undiagnosed.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Large plaque parapsoriasis and [[dermatomyositis]] (an inflammatory disorder of the skin and muscle) are other common causes of PVA.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Less common causes include autoimmune-related [[connective tissue disease]]s such as [[lupus erythematosus|lupus]] and [[scleroderma]].<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Dermatoses and those that are genetically inspired, called [[genodermatosis|genodermatoses]], may also be an underlying cause of PVA. Among them, [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] and [[Rothmund-Thomson syndrome]] (poikiloderma congenita) are thought to be the most prominent.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> Ingestion of substances containing [[arsenic]], such as [[arsphenamine]], has also been suggested as a least common cause.<ref name="pmid7026622"/> PVA can also be [[idiopathic]] (of unknown cause), as seen in a small number of cases.<ref name="pmid7026622"/>
