A '''cell bank''' is a facility that stores cells of specific [[Genome|genetic lines]] for the purpose of future use in a product or medicinal needs. They often contain expansive amounts of [[Cellular material|base cell material]] that can be utilized for various projects. The advantages of cell banks is that the facilities will include a "detailed characterization of the cell line" and will have a "decrease in the likelihood and an increase in the detection" of [[Cell_culture#Cell_line_cross-contamination|cross-contamination]] of a [[cell line]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Novel vaccination strategies |last=Kaufmann |first=Stefan H.E. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |location= |isbn= |page=283 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3eH950PyUQYC&pg=PA283&dq=%22cell+bank%22&hl=en&ei=8LNETqSkFMnd0QH4g7SOCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22cell%20bank%22&f=false |accessdate=August 12, 2011}}</ref>

==Storage==
Before putting the donated cell lines into storage, they are first [[Cell proliferation|proliferated]] and multiplied into a large number of identical cells before being stored in a number of [[Vial|cryovials]]. These cryovials are then placed into a tray, which is labeled with the genetic line data and then they are all frozen in "the liquid or vapor phase of liquid nitrogen typically between -196 and -70 degrees Celsius."<ref name="Behme"/> This temperature serves to stop all cell growth within the cryovials and preserves the cell lines. This stopping of the genetic line's growth is especially important for "non-continuous" cell lines that have a "limited number of cell divisions" before dying out.<ref name="Behme">{{cite book |title=Manufacturing of pharmaceutical proteins: from technology to economy |last=Behme |first=Stefan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=46–47 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wiUBBra9ebUC&pg=PA46&dq=%22cell+bank%22&hl=en&ei=8LNETqSkFMnd0QH4g7SOCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22cell%20bank%22&f=false |accessdate=August 12, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
Originally, scientists kept collections of cellular material for their own use, but not for the scientific community at large. The first person accredited with making a cell bank for widespread use was Kral, a [[Czechoslovakian]] scientist who created his cell bank collection in the late 1890s.<ref name="Hug">{{cite book |title=Translational Stem Cell Research: Issues Beyond the Debate on the Moral Status of the Human Embryo |last=Hug |first=Kristina |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=225–237 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=955hap0emMUC&pg=PA226&dq=%22cell+bank%22&hl=en&ei=ggdLTqqoNar-sQKYsNSJDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22cell%20bank%22&f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>

Currently, there are a large number of "culture collections and bioresource centers" that serve an individual part of the process of [[bioengineering]]. Some examples of these include the [[World Federation for Culture Collections]] and the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories.<ref name="Hug"/> In January 2003, the [[UK Stem Cell Bank]] was established to serve as a central unit for specimen collection and human testing.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stem Cell Wars: Inside Stories from the Frontlines |last=Herold |first=Eve |authorlink= |coauthors=Daley, George |year=2007 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location= |isbn= |page=205 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tBQgMTqIseQC&pg=PA205&dq=%22stem+cell+bank%22&hl=en&ei=IzRLTsSTDqKqsALH76i3CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22stem%20cell%20bank%22&f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref> The National Stem Cell Bank was established in October 2005 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in order to serve as a repository specifically for stem cell lines. It currently hosts 13 of the 21 stem cell lines that exist in the world and are listed on the Stem Cell Registry hosted by the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of stem cell research, Volume 2 |last=Svendsen |first=Clive |authorlink= |coauthors=Ebert, Allison D. |year=2008 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=369–370 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UhvtbMmxXeAC&pg=PA370&dq=%22stem+cell+bank%22&hl=en&ei=IzRLTsSTDqKqsALH76i3CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22stem%20cell%20bank%22&f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>
