'''Warfarin-induced skin necrosis''' (or, more generally, '''coumadin-induced skin necrosis''' or '''Anticoagulant-induced skin necrosis''') is a condition in which [[skin]] and [[subcutaneous tissue]] [[necrosis]] (tissue death) occurs due to acquired [[protein C deficiency]] following treatment with [[Vitamin K antagonist|anti-vitamin K]] [[anticoagulant]]s ([[coumarin]]s, such as [[warfarin]]).<ref name="pmid1341581">{{cite journal | author=McKnight JT, Maxwell AJ, Anderson RL | title=Warfarin necrosis | journal=Arch Fam Med | year=1992 | pages=105–8 | volume=1 | issue=1  | pmid=1341581 | doi=10.1001/archfami.1.1.105}}</ref>

==Disease mechanism==
[[Image:Coagulation full.svg|thumb|400px|The [[coagulation]] cascade.]]
Warfarin [[necrosis]] usually occurs three to five days after drug therapy is begun, and a high initial dose increases the risk of its development.<ref name="Andrews" />{{rp|122}}  Heparin-induced necrosis can develop both at sites of local [[injection (medicine)|injection]] and - when [[infusion|infused]] [[intravenous]]ly - in a widespread pattern.<ref name="Andrews" />{{rp|123}}

In warfarin's initial stages of action, inhibition of [[protein C]] and [[Factor VII]] is stronger than inhibition of the other [[vitamin K]]-dependent [[coagulation factor]]s [[Factor II|II]], [[Factor IX|IX]] and [[Factor X|X]]. This results from the fact that these proteins have different [[half-life|half-lives]]: 1.5 to six hours for factor VII and eight hours for protein C, versus one day for factor IX, two days for factor X and two to five days for factor II. The larger the initial dose of vitamin K-antagonist, the more pronounced these differences are. This coagulation factor imbalance leads to paradoxical activation of coagulation, resulting in a [[hypercoagulable state]] and [[thrombosis]]. The blood clots interrupt the blood supply to the skin, causing necrosis. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant, and as warfarin further decreases protein C levels, it can lead to massive thrombosis with necrosis and gangrene of limbs.

Notably, the [[prothrombin time]] (or [[international normalized ratio]], INR) used to test the effect of coumarins is highly dependent on factor VII, which explains why patients can have a therapeutic INR (indicating good anticoagulant effect) but still be in a hypercoagulable state.<ref name="pmid1341581"/>

In one third of cases, warfarin necrosis occurs in patients with an underlying, innate and previously unknown deficiency of protein C. The condition is related to [[purpura fulminans]], a complication in infants with [[sepsis]] (blood stream infection) which also involves skin necrosis. These infants often have protein C deficiency as well. There have also been cases in patients with other deficiency, including [[protein S deficiency]],<ref name="pmid9885367">{{cite journal |author=Sallah S, Abdallah JM, Gagnon GA |title=Recurrent warfarin-induced skin necrosis in kindreds with protein S deficiency |journal=Haemostasis |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=25–30 |year=1998 |pmid=9885367 |doi= |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=hae28025}}</ref><ref name="pmid2522326">{{cite journal |author=Grimaudo V, Gueissaz F, Hauert J, Sarraj A, Kruithof EK, Bachmann F |title=Necrosis of skin induced by coumarin in a patient deficient in protein S |journal=BMJ |volume=298 |issue=6668 |pages=233–4 |year=1989 |month=January |pmid=2522326 |pmc=1835547 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.298.6668.233|url=}}</ref> [[activated protein C resistance]] (Factor V Leiden)<ref name="pmid8701423">{{cite journal |author=Makris M, Bardhan G, Preston FE |title=Warfarin induced skin necrosis associated with activated protein C resistance |journal=Thromb.

Although the above theory is the most commonly accepted theory, others believe that it is a [[hypersensitivity reaction]] or a direct toxic effect.<ref name="pmid1341581"/>

==Treatment and prevention==
The first element of treatment is usually to discontinue the offending drug, although there have been reports describing how the eruption evolved little after it had established in spite of continuing the medication.<ref name="pmid14284863">{{cite journal |author=Nalbandian RM, Mader IJ, Barrett JL, Pearce JF, Rupp EC |title=Petechiae, ecchymoses, and necrosis of skin induced by coumarin congeners: rare, occasionally lethal complication of anticoagulant therapy |journal=JAMA |volume=192 |issue= |pages=603–8 |year=1965 |month=May |pmid=14284863 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid13171021"/> Vitamin K can be used to reverse the effects of coumarins, and [[heparin]] or its [[low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH) can be used in an attempt to prevent further clotting. None of these suggested therapies have been studied in [[clinical trial]]s.

Heparin and LMWH act by a different mechanism than warfarin, so these drugs can also be used to prevent clotting during the first few days of warfarin therapy and thus prevent warfarin necrosis (this is called 'bridging').

Because low levels of protein C are involved in the underlying mechanism, [[fresh frozen plasma]] or pure [[activated protein C]] has been used in this setting.<ref name="pmid8507079">{{cite journal |author=Schramm W |title=Treatment of coumarin-induced skin necrosis with a monoclonal antibody purified protein C concentrate |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=753–6 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=8507079 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.129.6.753|url= |author-separator=, |author2=Spannagl M |author3=Bauer KA |display-authors=3 |last4=Rosenberg |first4=RD |last5=Birkner |first5=B |last6=Linnau |first6=Y |last7=Schwarz |first7=HP}}</ref>

The necrotic skin areas are treated as in other conditions, sometimes healing spontaneously with or without scarring, sometimes going on to require surgical [[debridement]] or [[skin graft]]ing.<ref name="pmid1341581"/> The risk of death is mainly related to underlying disorders for which anticoagulation is started (for example, recurrent [[pulmonary embolism]]).

Since the clot-promoting effects of coumarins are transitory, patients with protein C deficiency or previous warfarin necrosis can still be restarted on these drugs if appropriate measures are taken.<ref name="pmid3754407">{{cite journal |author=Zauber NP, Stark MW |title=Successful warfarin anticoagulation despite protein C deficiency and a history of warfarin necrosis |journal=Ann.

Med. |volume=104 |issue=5 |pages=659–60 |year=1986 |month=May |pmid=3754407 |doi= |url=}}</ref> These include gradual increase starting from low doses and supplemental administration of protein C (pure or from fresh frozen plasma).<ref name="pmid8236128">{{cite journal |author=De Stefano V |title=Replacement therapy with a purified protein C concentrate during initiation of oral anticoagulation in severe protein C congenital deficiency |journal=Thromb.

==Differential diagnosis==
Many conditions mimic or may be mistaken for warfarin necrosis, including [[pyoderma gangrenosum]] or [[necrotizing fasciitis]]. Warfarin necrosis is also different from another drug eruption associated with warfarin, [[purple toe syndrome]], which usually occurs three to eight weeks after the start of anticoagulation therapy. No report has described this disorder in the immediate postpartum period in patients with protein S deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheng | first1 = A | last2 = Scheinfeld | first2 = NS | last3 = McDowell | first3 = B | last4 = Dokras | first4 = AA | title = Warfarin skin necrosis in a postpartum woman with protein S deficiency | journal = Obstetrics and gynecology | volume = 90 | issue = 4 Pt 2 | pages = 671–2 | year = 1997 | pmid = 11770590 | doi = 10.1016/S0029-7844(97)00393-1 }}</ref>

==History==
While skin necrosis in patients had been previously described, Verhagen was the first to publish a paper on this relationship in the medical literature, in 1954.<ref name="pmid13171021">{{cite journal |author=Verhagen H |title=Local haemorrhage and necrosis of the skin and underlying tissues, during anti-coagulant therapy with dicumarol or dicumacyl |journal=Acta Med Scand |volume=148 |issue=6 |pages=453–67 |year=1954 |pmid=13171021 |doi= 10.1111/j.0954-6820.1954.tb01741.x|url=}}</ref>
