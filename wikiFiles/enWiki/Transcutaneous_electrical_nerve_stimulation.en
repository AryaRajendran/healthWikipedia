'''Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)''' is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. TENS by definition covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain.<ref>Robetson et al., 4th ed.</ref> The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity.  Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (>50&nbsp;Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (<10&nbsp;Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.<ref>{{Cite book| edition = Third| publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins| isbn = 0781744849| last = Robinson| first = Andrew J| coauthors = Lynn Snyder-Mackler| title = Clinical Electrophysiology: Electrotherapy and Electrophysiologic Testing| date = 2007-09-01}}</ref> The benefit of TENS for pain is controversial.

==Medical uses==
===Pain===
TENS is a non-invasive, low-risk nerve stimulation intended to reduce [[pain]], both acute and chronic. Controversy exists as to its effectiveness in the treatment of chronic pain. One review from 2007 felt that the evidence supports a benefit in chronic musculoskeletal pain<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Johnson M, Martinson, M |title=Efficacy of electrical nerve stimulation for chronic musculoskeletal pain: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=Pain |volume=130|issue=1 |pages=157–165 |year=2006 |pmid= 17383095|doi=10.1016/j.pain.2007.02.007|url=http://www.painjournalonline.com/article/S0304-3959(07)00073-5/abstract}}</ref> while another review from the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] in 2008 deemed the evidence of poor quality and thus no conclusions were possible regarding chronic pain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nnoaham|first=KE|coauthors=Kumbang, J|title=Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for chronic pain.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2008 Jul 16|issue=3|pages=CD003222|pmid=18646088|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003222.pub2}}</ref> Results from a task force on neck pain, in 2008, found no clinically significant benefit to TENS for the treatment of neck pain when compared to placebo treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=|title=The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders: Executive Summary|journal=Spine |volume=33 |issue=4S Supplement |pages=S5–7 |date=15 February 2008|url=http://www.spinejournal.com/pt/re/spine/fulltext.00007632-200802151-00004.htm;jsessionid=JnnRzQxYsPbn2R14TVybSpYpR4yD9z2PG9TQl6Rcdh4HgpJwSJ9v!1173332523!181195629!8091!-1|doi= 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181643f40 |last1= Haldeman |first1= Scott |pmid= 18204400 |last2= Carroll |first2= L |last3= Cassidy |first3= JD |last4= Schubert |first4= J |last5= Nygren |first5= A |author6= Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders}}</ref> A 2010 review did not find evidence to support the use of TENS for chronic low back pain.<ref name=Review2010>{{cite journal|last=Dubinsky|first=RM|coauthors=Miyasaki, J|title=Assessment: efficacy of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in the treatment of pain in neurologic disorders (an evidence-based review): report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.|journal=Neurology|date=2010 Jan 12|volume=74|issue=2|pages=173–6|pmid=20042705|doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c918fc}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Khadilkar|first=A|coauthors=Odebiyi, DO; Brosseau, L; Wells, GA|title=Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) versus placebo for chronic low-back pain.|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=2008 Oct 8|issue=4|pages=CD003008|pmid=18843638|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003008.pub3}}</ref> There is tentative evidence that it may be useful for painful [[diabetic neuropathy]].<ref name=Review2010/> and knee osteoarthritis;[17][18][19]

===Labour pain===
A significant number of TENS machine brands have been targeted for use for labour pain, although a 1997 report of a study done by the [[University of Oxford]] said that TENS "has been shown not to be effective in postoperative and labour pain."<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Health Technology Assessment|author=McQuay HJ, Moore RA, Eccleston C, Morley S, de C Williams AC |url=http://www.hta.ac.uk/913 |title=Systematic review of outpatient services for chronic pain control|date=July 1997}}</ref>
Use is documented in the attached references: in [[obstetrics|obstetric]] care, particularly in [[childbirth|labour]];<ref>{{Cite journal|author=van der Spank JT, Cambier DC, De Paepe HM, Danneels LA, Witvrouw EE, Beerens L |title=Pain relief in labour by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) |journal=Arch. Gynecol. Obstet. |volume=264 |issue=3 |pages=131–6 |year=2000 |month=Nov|pmid=11129512|url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00404/bibs/0264003/02640131.htm|doi=10.1007/s004040000099}}</ref>

==History==
Electrical stimulation for pain control was used in [[ancient Rome]], 63 A.D. It was reported by [[Scribonius Largus]] that pain was relieved by standing on an electrical fish at the seashore.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jensen JE, Conn RR, Hazelrigg G, Hewett JE |title=The use of transcutaneous neural stimulation and isokinetic testing in arthroscopic knee surgery |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=27–33 |year=1985 |pmid=3872082 |url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/27 |doi=10.1177/036354658501300105}}</ref> In the 16th through the 18th century various [[electrostatic]] devices were used for headache and other pains. [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a proponent of this method for pain relief. In the nineteenth century a device called the electreat, along with numerous other devices were used for pain control and cancer cures. Only the electreat survived into the twentieth century, but was not portable, and had limited control of the stimulus.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Modern===
The first modern, patient-wearable TENS was patented in the United States in 1974.<ref>{{US patent|3817254}}</ref> It was initially used for testing the tolerance of [[chronic pain]] patients to electrical stimulation before [[spinal Cord Stimulator|implantation of electrodes in the spinal cord dorsal column]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Burton C |title=Instrumentation for dorsal column stimulator implantation |journal=Surg Neurol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=39–40 |year=1974 |month=Jan |pmid=4810453 }}</ref> The electrodes were attached to an implanted receiver, which received its power from an antenna worn on the surface of the skin. Although intended only for testing tolerance to electrical stimulation, many of the patients said they received so much relief from the TENS itself that they never returned for the implant.

A number of companies began manufacturing TENS units after the commercial success of the [[Medtronic]] device became known. The neurological division of Medtronic, founded by Don Maurer, Ed Schuck and Dr. Charles Ray, developed a number of applications for implanted electrical stimulation devices for treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the nervous system.

Today many people confuse TENS with [[Electro Muscle Stimulation]] (EMS). EMS and TENS devices look similar, with both using long electric lead wires and electrodes. TENS is for blocking pain, where EMS is for stimulating muscles.

==Safety==
{{howto|section|date=March 2012}}
TENS electrodes should never be placed:
*Over the eyes due to the risk of increasing [[intraocular pressure]]<ref name=safe/>
*Transcerebrally<ref>Alfred G. Bracciano, ''Physical Agent Modalities: Theory and Application for the Occupational Therapist'', Edition 2, SLACK Incorporated, 2008, ISBN	1556426496 [http://books.google.com/books?id=aOjp8mbRTn4C&pg=PA232, p. 232]</ref>
*On the front of the neck due to the risk of an acute hypotension (through a [[vasovagal reflex]]) or even a [[laryngospasm]]<ref name=safe/><ref name=val159/>
*Through the chest using an anterior and posterior electrode positions,<ref name=safe/> or other transthoracic applications understood as "across a thoracic diameter"; this does not preclude coplanar applications<ref name=val159/>
*Internally, except for specific applications of dental, vaginal, and anal stimulation that employ specialized TENS units<ref name=safe/>
*On broken skin areas or wounds, although it can be placed around wounds.<ref name=safe>Watson, 12th ed., [http://books.google.com/books?id=1IPj7rYI2u0C&pg=PA266 p. 266]</ref>
* Over a [[tumour]]/[[malignancy]] (based on [[in vitro]] experiments where electricity promotes cell growth)<ref name=safe/><ref name=val159/>
* Directly over the spinal column

TENS should not be used across an artificial [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]] (or other indwelling stimulator, including across its leads) due to risk of interference and failure of the implanted device. Serious accidents have been recorded in cases when this principle was not observed.<ref name=val159/> A 2009 review in this area suggests that electrotherapy, including TENS, "are best avoided" in patients with pacemakers or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s (ICDs). They add that "there is no consensus and it may be possible to safely deliver these modalities in a proper setting with device and patient monitoring", and recommend further research. The review found several reports of ICDs administering inappropriate treatment due to interference with TENS devices, but notes that the reports on pacemakers are mixed: some non-programmable pacemakers were inhibited by TENS, but others were unaffected or auto-reprogrammed.<ref>{{cite pmid|19411677}}</ref>

On areas of numb skin/decreased sensation TENS should be used with caution because it's likely less effective due to nerve damage. It may also cause skin irritation due to the inability to feel currents until they are too high.<ref name=safe/> There's an unknown level of risk when placing electrodes over an [[infection]] (possible spreading due to muscle contractions), but cross contamination with the electrodes themselves is of greater concern.<ref>Roberston et al., 4th ed., [http://books.google.com/books?id=XBUEfp5ZfcgC&pg=PA160 p. 160]</ref> TENS should also be used with caution in people with epilepsy or pregnant women; do not use over area of the uterus as the effects of electrical stimulation over the developing fetus are not known.<ref name=val159>Roberston et al., 4th ed., [http://books.google.com/books?id=XBUEfp5ZfcgC&pg=PA159 p. 159]</ref><ref>Watson, 12th ed., [http://books.google.com/books?id=1IPj7rYI2u0C&pg=PA265 p. 265]</ref>
