First and second year podiatry students take the same courses as the osteopathic medical students from the [[College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific|medical college on campus]].<ref name=AACPMcollegeBook>{{cite web|title=Podiatric Medical College Information Book|url=http://www.aacpm.org/html/careerzone/pdfs/AACPM%20CIB-2013%20Entering%20Class.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Podiatric Medicine|pages=54-57|accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> The first two years of coursework focus on the basic sciences with a systems-based approach to basic clinical sciences.  Subjects include biochemistry, pharmacology, immunology, hematology, oncology, neuroscience, psychiatry, rheumatology, endocrinology, cardiology, nephrology, pulmonology, reproductive medicine, dermatology, and gastroenterology.

The curriculum at the College of Podiatric Medicine includes [[Interprofessional education|Interprofessional Education]] (IPE), a program that involves 9 colleges at [[Western University of Health Sciences|WesternU]].  The IPE program aims to demonstrate an understanding of other health professions and to provide and promote a team approach to patient care and health care management, leading to improved patient care.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.westernu.edu/interprofessional-about | title= About IPE | author= Pumerantz PhD, Philip | work= Western University of Health Sciences | accessdate= December 21, 2011 }}</ref> While a debate exists on the effectiveness of interprofessional education in encouraging collaborative practice, IPE is becoming a more common component of medical school curriculum in the United States, and many groups, including the [[World Health Organization]], view it as a means of reducing medical errors and improving the health care system.<ref name=USNews>{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2012/03/19/medical-schools-push-teamwork |title=Medical Schools Push Teamwork |author=Kathryn Roethel |date=March 19, 2012 |work= |publisher=US News & World Report |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

Students also have the option of pursuing clinical rotations outside of California for their fourth year.
