'''Vitiligo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|v|ɪ|t|ɨ|ˈ|l|aɪ|ɡ|oʊ}}) is a condition that causes [[depigmentation]] of sections of skin. It occurs when [[melanocyte]]s, the cells responsible for [[Human skin color|skin pigmentation]], die or are unable to function. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but research suggests that it may arise from [[autoimmune]], genetic, [[oxidative stress]], neural, or viral causes.<ref name="halder">{{cite journal | last1 = Halder | first1 = RM | last2 = Chappell | first2 = JL | title = Vitiligo update | journal = Seminars in cutaneous medicine and surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19608058 | doi = 10.1016/j.sder.2009.04.008 }}</ref> The incidence worldwide is less than 1%.<ref name=pmid7977362>{{cite journal |author=Nath SK, Majumder PP, Nordlund JJ |title=Genetic epidemiology of vitiligo: multilocus recessivity cross-validated |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=981–90 |year=1994 |pmid=7977362 |pmc=1918341}}</ref> The most common form is non-segmental vitiligo, which tends to appear in symmetric patches, sometimes over large areas of the body.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most notable symptom of vitiligo is depigmentation of patches of skin that occurs on the extremities.<ref name="niams">{{cite web |title=What Is Vitiligo?

==Treatment==
There are a number of treatments for vitiligo.  Treatment options generally fall into four groups:<ref name="UK">{{cite web|url=http://www.patient.co.uk/health/Vitiligo.htm|title=What are the treatment options for vitiligo?|last=Anon|work=Patient UK|publisher=EMIS & PiP|accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref>

===UVB phototherapy===
Exposing the skin to UVB light from UVB lamps is the most common treatment for vitiligo.  The treatments can be done at home with a domestic UVB lamp or in a clinic. It is important to control the exposure time, so that the skin does not burn from over exposure. The UVB lamp should have a timer that turns off the lamp. Normally a small lamp is needed if the spot is small. Treatment can take a few weeks if the spots are on the neck and face and if they existed not more than 3 years. If the spots are on the hands and legs and have been there more than 3 years, it can take a few months. In a clinic the treatments are done 2–3 times a week, and at home every day, which makes the home treatments more effective.  Spots on a large area of the body may require full body treatment in a clinic or hospital. Both UVB broadband and UVB narrowband lamps can be used.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 11369913 | year = 2001 | last1 = Scherschun | first1 = L | last2 = Kim | first2 = JJ | last3 = Lim | first3 = HW | title = Narrow-band ultraviolet B is a useful and well-tolerated treatment for vitiligo | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 999–1003 | doi = 10.1067/mjd.2001.114752 | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2005.02447.x | title = Treatment of vitiligo with broadband ultraviolet B and vitamins | year = 2006 | last1 = Don | first1 = Philip | last2 = Iuga | first2 = Aurel | last3 = Dacko | first3 = Anne | last4 = Hardick | first4 = Kathleen | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 45 | pages = 63–5 | pmid = 16426381 | issue = 1}}</ref> However these treatments are unreliable at best.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  There is no treatment that totally repigments the skin.

Studies have shown that [[immunomodulator]] creams such as [[Protopic]] and [[Elidel]] also cause repigmentation in some cases, when used with UVB narrowband treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tanghetti EA |title=Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% produces repigmentation in patients with vitiligo: results of a prospective patient series |journal=Cutis |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=158–62 |year=2003 |pmid=12635898}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Silverberg NB, Lin P, Travis L, ''et al.'' |title=Tacrolimus ointment promotes repigmentation of vitiligo in children: a review of 57 cases |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=760–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15523355 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2004.05.036}}</ref>  A 1997 report suggests that combining [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] and [[folic acid]] supplements with sun exposure caused repigmentation in 52% of cases.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9394983 | volume=77 | issue=6 | title=Improvement of vitiligo after oral treatment with vitamin B12 and folic acid and the importance of sun exposure | year=1997 |  author=Juhlin L, Olsson MJ | journal=Acta Derm. Venereol. | pages=460–2}}</ref>

===PUVA phototherapy===
Ultraviolet light ([[Ultraviolet A|UVA]]) treatments are normally carried out in a hospital clinic. [[Psoralen]] and ultraviolet A light ([[PUVA]]) treatment involves taking a drug that increases the skin's sensitivity to ultraviolet light, then exposed to high doses of ultraviolet A light. Treatment is required twice a week for 6–12 months or longer. Because of the high doses of UVA and psoralen, PUVA may cause side effects such as sunburn-type reactions or skin freckling.<ref name="UK"/>

Narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy is now used more commonly than PUVA as it is less damaging to the skin. As with PUVA, treatment is carried out twice weekly in a clinic or every day at home, and there is no need to use psoralen.<ref name="UK"/>

===Transplanting melanocytes===
In October 1992, a scientific report was published of successfully transplanting [[melanocyte]]s to vitiligo affected areas, effectively repigmenting the region.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olsson MJ, Juhlin L |title=Melanocyte transplantation in vitiligo |journal=Lancet |volume=340 |issue=8825 |page=981 |year=1992 |pmid=1357390 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(92)92875-G}}</ref> The procedure involved taking a thin layer of pigmented skin from the patient's [[Gluteal muscles|gluteal]] region. Melanocytes were then separated out to a [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] suspension that was expanded in culture. The area to be treated was then denuded with a [[Dermabrasion|dermabrader]] and the melanocytes [[Skin grafting|graft]] applied. Between 70 and 85 percent of patients experienced nearly complete repigmentation of their skin. The longevity of the repigmentation differed from person to person.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olsson MJ, Juhlin L |title=Long-term follow-up of leucoderma patients treated with transplants of autologous cultured melanocytes, ultrathin epidermal sheets and basal cell layer suspension |journal=The British Journal of Dermatology |volume=147 |issue=5 |pages=893–904 |year=2002 |pmid=12410698 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.2002.04837.x}}</ref>

===Skin camouflage===
In mild cases, vitiligo patches can be hidden with makeup or other [[cosmetic camouflage]] solutions. If the affected person is pale-skinned, the patches can be made less visible by avoiding both [[sunlight]] and the [[sun tanning|tanning]] of unaffected skin.<ref name="halder07"/>

===Reversal===
The traditional treatment is the application of [[corticosteroid]] cream.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kwinter J, Pelletier J, Khambalia A, Pope E |title=High-potency steroid use in children with vitiligo: a retrospective study |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=236–41 |year=2007|pmid=17224367 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.08.017}}</ref>

===De-pigmenting===
In cases of extensive vitiligo the option to de-pigment the unaffected skin with topical drugs like [[monobenzone]], [[mequinol]] or [[hydroquinone]] may be considered to render the skin an even colour. The removal of all the skin pigment with [[monobenzone]] is permanent and vigorous.  Sun-safety must be adhered to for life to avoid severe [[sun burn]] and [[melanomas]]. Depigmentation takes about a year to complete.<ref name="UK"/>

===Non-segmental===
In non-segmental vitiligo (NSV), there is usually some form of [[symmetry]] in the location of the patches of depigmentation. New patches also appear over time and can be generalized over large portions of the body or localized to a particular area. Vitiligo where little pigmented skin remains is referred to as ''vitiligo universalis''. NSV can come about at any age, unlike segmental vitiligo, which is far more prevalent in teenage years.<ref name="huggins"/>

Classes of non-segmental vitiligo include:
*Generalized Vitiligo: the most common pattern, wide and randomly distributed areas of depigmentation<ref name="halder07">Halder RM, et al. Vitiligo. In: Wolff K, et al. Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. 7th ed. New York, N.Y.: McGraw-Hill Professional; 2007</ref>
*Universal Vitiligo: depigmentation encompasses most of the body<ref name="halder07"/>
*Focal Vitiligo: one or a few scattered macules in one area, most common in children<ref name="halder07"/>
*Acrofacial Vitiligo: fingers and periorificial areas<ref name="halder07"/>
*Mucosal Vitiligo: depigmentation of only the mucous membranes<ref name="halder07"/>

===Segmental===
Segmental vitiligo (SV) differs in appearance, [[etiology]] and prevalence from associated illnesses. Its treatment is different from that of NSV. It tends to affect areas of skin that are associated with [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] roots from the spine and is most often unilateral. It spreads much more rapidly than NSV and, without treatment, it is much more stable/ static in course and is not associated with auto-immune diseases. It is a very treatable condition that responds to topical treatment.<ref name="huggins"/>

==Pathogenesis==
Vitiligo is a disorder characterized by patchy loss of skin pigmentation due to immune attacks on melanocytes. Although there is no significant proof or evidence, many doctors believe that it can be caused by defects in many genes.{{cn|date=September 2012}} Variations in genes that are part of the immune system or part of melanocytes have both been associated with vitiligo. The immune system genes are associated with other autoimmune disorders.

In one case, the gene TYR, which makes the melanocyte more susceptible to the immune system in vitiligo, also makes the melanocyte more susceptible to the immune system in the skin cancer [[malignant melanoma]]. So people with vitiligo caused by the TYR gene are less likely to have malignant melanoma.

A genomewide association study found 10 independent susceptibility loci for generalized vitiligo, responsible for 7.4% of the genetic risk. Some patients had vitiligo alone; others had generalized vitiligo with other autoimmune diseases. Most loci were associated with both forms. (The exception was PTPN22, which was only associated with generalized vitiligo.) In the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) region, which controls the immune system, major association signals were identified in the class I gene region (between HLA-A and HLA-HGC9) and class II gene region (between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1). Outside the MHC region, association signals were identified near RERE, PTPN22, LPP, IL2RA, GZMB, UBASH3A and C1QTNF6 genes, which are associated with other autoimmune diseases. TYR encodes tyrosinase, which is not a component of the immune system, but is an enzyme of the melanocyte that catalyzes melanin biosynthesis, and a major autoantigen in generalized vitiligo. The major alleles of TYR are associated with vitiligo, and the minor alleles are associated with malignant melanoma. Vitiligo-associated 402R tyrosinase may be more efficiently presented to the immune system. Melanoma-associated 402Q may fail to be identified by the immune system.<ref name="Jin">{{cite journal |author=Jin Y, Birlea SA, Fain PR, ''et al.'' |title=Variant of TYR and Autoimmunity Susceptibility Loci in Generalized Vitiligo |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=362 |issue=18 |pages=1686–97 |year=2010|pmid=20410501 |pmc=2891985 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0908547 }}</ref>

The transcriptional profile of melanocytes from vitiligo patients have been studied. Oligonucleotide microarrays containing approximately 16,000 unique genes were used to analyse mRNA expression in melanocytes from vitiligo patients and age-matched healthy controls. In total, 859 genes were identified as differentially expressed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Strömberg S, Björklund MG, Asplund A, ''et al.'' |title=Transcriptional profiling of melanocytes from patients with vitiligo vulgaris |journal=Pigment Cell & Melanoma Research |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=162–71 |year=2008 |pmid=18426409 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-148X.2007.00429.x}}</ref>

Vitiligo is sometimes associated with [[autoimmune]] and [[inflammatory disease]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hedstrand H, Ekwall O, Olsson MJ, ''et al.'' |title=The transcription factors SOX9 and SOX10 are vitiligo autoantigens in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=276 |issue=38 |pages=35390–5 |year=2001 |pmid=11423552 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M102391200}}</ref> commonly [[thyroid]] overexpression and underexpression. A study comparing 656 people with and without vitiligo in 114 families found several mutations ([[single nucleotide polymorphism|single-nucleotide polymorphisms]]) in the [[Pattern recognition receptor|NALP1]] gene. The NALP1 gene, which is on [[chromosome]] 17 located at 17p13, is on a cascade that regulates [[inflammation]] and [[cell death]], including [[myeloid]] and [[lymphoid]] cells, which are white cells that are part of the [[immune response]]. NALP1 is expressed at high levels in [[T cell]]s and [[Langerhan cell]]s, [[white blood cell]]s that are involved in skin autoimmunity. Polymorphisms of CD4 were shown to be associated with the vitiligo and other autoimmune diseases like type I Diabetes Mellitus.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mashaghi A ''et al.'' | year = 2010 | title = Possible association of the CD4 gene polymorphism with vitiligo | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2230.2009.03667.x/pdf | journal = Clin Exp Dermatol | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 521–4 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2230.2009.03667.x | pmid=19843086}}</ref>

Among the inflammatory products of NALP1 are [[caspase 1]] and [[caspase 7]], which activate the inflammatory [[cytokine]] interleukin-1β. Interleukin-1β is expressed at high levels in patients with vitiligo. Some compounds inhibit caspase and interleukin-1β, and so might be useful drugs for vitiligo and associated autoimmune diseases. In one of the mutations, the [[amino acid]] leucine in the NALP1 protein was replaced by histidine (Leu155->His). The original protein and sequence is highly conserved in evolution, and found in humans, [[chimpanzee]], [[Rhesus Macaque|rhesus monkey]], and [[Galago|bush baby]], which means that it is an important protein and an alteration is likely to be harmful. [[Addison's disease]] (typically an autoimmune destruction of the [[adrenal gland]]s) may cause vitiligo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gregersen PK |title=Modern genetics, ancient defenses, and potential therapies |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=12 |pages=1263–6 |year=2007|pmid=17377166 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe078017}}</ref><ref name=NALP2>{{cite journal |author=Jin Y, Mailloux CM, Gowan K, ''et al.'' |title=NALP1 in vitiligo-associated multiple autoimmune disease |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=12 |pages=1216–25 |year=2007|pmid=17377159 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa061592}}</ref>
