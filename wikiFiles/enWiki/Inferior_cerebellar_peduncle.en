The upper part of the posterior district of the [[medulla oblongata]] is occupied by the '''inferior cerebellar peduncle''' (restiform body), a thick rope-like strand situated between the lower part of the [[fourth ventricle]] and the roots of the [[glossopharyngeal]] and [[vagus nerve]]s. 

Each cerebellar inferior peduncle connects the [[medulla spinalis]] and medulla oblongata with the [[cerebellum]], and comprises the [[juxtarestiform body]] and restiform body.

Important fibers running through the inferior cerebellar peduncle include the [[spinocerebellar tract]] and axons from the [[inferior olivary nucleus]], among others.

==Function==
The inferior cerebellar peduncle carries many types of input and output fibers that are mainly concerned with integrating [[proprioceptive]] sensory input with motor [[vestibular]] functions such as [[balance (ability)|balance]] and [[neutral spine|posture]] maintenance. 

[[Proprioceptive]] information from the body is carried to the [[cerebellum]] via the [[posterior spinocerebellar tract]]. 

This tract passes through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and synapses within the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions | spinocerebellum]] (also known as the paleocerebellum). 

Vestibular information projects onto the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions | vestibulocerebellum]] (also known as the archicerebellum). 

This peduncle also carries information directly from the [[Purkinje cells]] to the vestibular nuclei in the dorsal [[brainstem]] located at the junction between the [[pons]] and [[medulla oblongata]].
