Strictly speaking, the free radical theory is only concerned with free radicals such as superoxide ( O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ), but it has since been expanded to encompass oxidative damage from other [[reactive oxygen species]] such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), or [[peroxynitrite]] (OONO<sup>-</sup>).<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

[[Denham Harman]] first proposed the free radical theory of aging in the 1950s,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Harman, D | title=Aging: a theory based on free radical and radiation chemistry | journal=Journal of Gerontology | volume=11 | issue=3 | year=1956 | pages=298–300 | pmid=13332224 }}</ref> and in the 1970s extended the idea to implicate [[mitochondria]]l production of reactive oxygen species.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Harman, D | title=A biologic clock: the mitochondria? | journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |volume=20 |issue=4 |year=1972 |pages=145–147 |pmid=5016631 }}</ref>

In some model organisms, such as [[yeast]] and ''[[Drosophila]]'', there is evidence that reducing oxidative damage can extend lifespan.<ref>Fontana L, Partridge L, Longo VD.

== Background ==
The free radical theory of aging was conceived by [[Denham Harman]] in the 1950s, when prevailing scientific opinion held that free radicals were too unstable to exist in biological systems.<ref name="ReferenceC">Harman D. Aging: a theory based on free radical and radiation chemistry. J Gerontol. 1956 Jul;11(3):298-300.</ref>  This was also before anyone invoked free radicals as a cause of degenerative diseases.<ref name="Harman D 2009">Harman D. Origin and evolution of the free radical theory of aging: a brief personal history, 1954–2009. Biogerontology. 2009;10(6):773-81.</ref> Two sources inspired Harman: 1) the rate of living theory, which holds that lifespan is an inverse function of metabolic rate which in turn is proportional to oxygen consumption, and 2) Rebbeca Gershman's observation that hyperbaric oxygen toxicity and [[radiation toxicity]] could be explained by the same underlying phenomenon: oxygen free radicals.<ref name="ReferenceC"/><ref>Speakman JR, Selman C. The free-radical damage theory: Accumulating evidence against a simple link of oxidative stress to ageing and lifespan. BioEssays. 2011;33(4):255-9.</ref> Noting that radiation causes "mutation, cancer and aging", Harman argued that oxygen free radicals produced during normal respiration would cause cumulative damage which would eventually lead to organismal loss of functionality, and ultimately death.<ref name="ReferenceC"/><ref>Speakman JR, Selman C. The free-radical damage theory: Accumulating evidence against a simple link of oxidative stress to ageing and lifespan. BioEssays. 2011;33(4):255-9.</ref> 

In later years, the free radical theory was expanded to include not only aging ''per se'', but also age-related diseases.<ref name="Harman D 2009"/> Free radical damage within cells has been linked to a range of disorders including [[cancer]], [[arthritis]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[diabetes]].<ref>Clancy D, Birdsall J. Flies, worms and the Free Radical Theory of ageing. Ageing Research Reviews. (0).</ref> There has been some evidence to suggest that free radicals and some reactive nitrogen species trigger and increase cell death mechanisms within the body such as [[apoptosis]] and in extreme cases [[necrosis]].<ref>Chatterjee S, Lardinois O, Bhattacharjee S, Tucker J, Corbett J, Deterding L, et al. Oxidative stress induces protein and DNA radical formation in follicular dendritic cells of the germinal center and modulates its cell death patterns in late sepsis. Free Radical Biology and Medicine. 2011;50(8):988-99.</ref>

In 1972, Harman modified his original theory to what became known as the mitochondrial theory of aging.<ref name="Harman D 2009"/> In its current form, this theory proposes that reactive oxygen species that are produced in the [[mitochondria]], causes damage to certain [[macromolecules]] including [[lipids]], [[proteins]] and most importantly mitochondrial DNA.<ref>Jang YC, Remmen HV. The mitochondrial theory of aging: Insight from transgenic and knockout mouse models. Experimental Gerontology. 2009;44(4):256-60.</ref> This damage then causes mutations which leads to an increase of [[Reactive Oxygen Species|ROS]] production and greatly enhances the accumulation of free radicals within cells.<ref>Jang YC, Remmen HV. The mitochondrial theory of aging: Insight from transgenic and knockout mouse models. Experimental Gerontology. 2009;44(4):256-60.</ref> This mitochondrial theory has been more widely accepted that it could play a major role in contributing to the aging process.<ref>Gruber J, Schaffer S, Halliwell B. The mitochondrial free radical theory of ageing--where do we stand? Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library. 2008;13:6554-79.</ref>

Since Harman first proposed the free radical theory of aging, there have been continual modifications and extensions to his original theory.<ref>Gruber J, Schaffer S, Halliwell B. The mitochondrial free radical theory of ageing--where do we stand? Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library. 2008;13:6554-79.</ref>

==Processes==
Free radicals are atoms or molecules containing unpaired electrons.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> [[Electron]]s normally exist in pairs in specific [[orbital]]s in atoms or molecules.<ref name="Orchin M 2005">Orchin M, Macomber RS, Pinhas A, Wilson RM, editors. The Vocabulary and Concepts of Organic Chemistry. 2 ed: John Wiley & Sons; 2005.</ref> Free radicals, which contain only a single electron in such any orbital, are usually unstable toward losing or picking up an extra electron, so that all electrons in the atom or molecule will be paired.<ref name="Orchin M 2005"/> 

Note that the unpaired electron does not imply charge - free radicals can be positively charged, negatively charged, or neutral. 

Damage occurs when the free radical encounters another molecule and seeks to find another electron to pair its unpaired electron. The free radical often pulls an electron off a neighboring molecule, causing the affected molecule to become a free radical itself. The new free radical can then pull an electron off the next molecule, and a chemical [[chain reaction]] of radical production occurs.<ref>Hang Cui, Yahui Kong, Hong Zhang [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3184498/?tool=pubmed “Oxidative Stress, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, and Aging”] “Journal of Signal Transduction, 2011.</ref> The free radicals produced in such reactions often terminate by removing an electron from a molecule which becomes changed or cannot function without it, especially in biology. Such an event causes damage to the molecule, and thus to the cell that contains it (since the molecule often becomes dysfunctional).

The chain reaction caused by free radicals can lead to cross-linking of atomic structures. In cases where the free radical-induced chain reaction involves [[base pair]] molecules in a strand of DNA, the DNA can become cross-linked.<ref>Crean C, Geacintov NE, Shafirovich V. Intrastrand G-U cross-links generated by the oxidation of guanine in 5′-d(GCU) and 5′-r(GCU). Free Radical Biology and Medicine. 2008;45(8):1125-34.</ref> 

[[Crosslinking of DNA|DNA cross-linking]] can in turn lead to various effects of aging, especially [[cancer]].<ref>Dizdaroglu M, Jaruga P. Mechanisms of free radical-induced damage to DNA. Free Radical Research. [Article]. 2012;46(4):382-419.</ref>  Other cross-linking can occur between [[fat]] and [[protein]] molecules, which leads to wrinkles.<ref>Pageon H, Asselineau D. An in Vitro Approach to the Chronological Aging of Skin by Glycation of the Collagen: The Biological Effect of Glycation on the Reconstructed Skin Model. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. 2005;1043(1):529-32.</ref>  Free radicals can oxidize [[LDL]], and this is a key event in the formation of plaque in arteries, leading to [[heart disease]] and [[stroke]].<ref>Bamm VV, Tsemakhovich VA, Shaklai N. Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein by hemoglobin–hemichrome. The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology. 2003;35(3):349-58.</ref> These are examples of how the free-radical theory of aging has been used to neatly "explain" the origin of many [[chronic disease]]s.<ref>C. Richter, JW Park, BN Ames [http://www.pnas.org/content/85/17/6465.short “Normal oxidative damage to mitochondrial and nuclear DNA is extensive”] “PNAS”, 1988.</ref>

Free radicals that are thought to be involved in the process of aging include super oxide and nitric oxide.<ref>Afanas'ev IB. Free radical mechanisms of aging processes under physiological conditions. Biogerontology. 2005;6(4):283-90.</ref>  Specifically, an increase in super oxide affects aging whereas a decrease in nitric oxide formation, or its bioavailability, does the same.<ref>Afanas'ev IB. Free radical mechanisms of aging processes under physiological conditions. Biogerontology. 2005;6(4):283-90.</ref>

[[Antioxidants]] are helpful in reducing and preventing damage from free radical reactions because of their ability to donate electrons which neutralize the radical without forming another. [[Ascorbic acid]], for example, can lose an electron to a free radical and remain stable itself by passing its unstable electron around the antioxidant molecule.<ref>Bagchi D. et al [http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/9090754 “Oxygen free radical scavenging abilities of vitamins C and E, and a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract in vitro”] “Research Communications in Molecular Pathology and Pharmacology” 1997.</ref> 

This has led to the hypothesis that large amounts of antioxidants,<ref>Biesalski H. Free radical theory of aging. Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care. 2002 January 2002;5(1):5 -10.</ref> with their ability to decrease the numbers of free radicals, might lessen the radical damage causing chronic diseases, and even radical damage responsible for aging.

== Evidence ==
Numerous studies have demonstrated a role for [[free radical]]s in the aging process and thus tentatively support the free radical theory of aging. Studies have shown a significant increase in [[superoxide radical]] (SOR) formation and [[lipid peroxidation]] in aging rats.<ref>Sawada M, Carlson JC. Changes in superoxide radical and lipid peroxide formation in the brain, heart and liver during the lifetime of the rat.

The Choksi et al. experiment with Ames dwarf (DW) mice suggests the lower levels of endogenous ROS production in DW mice may be a factor in their resistance to oxidative stress and long life.<ref>Choksi KB, Roberts LJ, 2nd, DeFord JH, Rabek JP, Papaconstantinou J.

==Modifications of the free radical theory of aging==
One of the main criticisms of the free radical theory of aging is the idea free radicals are responsible for the damage of [[biomolecule]]s resulting in changes to the biology of the cell and thus organismal aging.<ref>Afanas'ev I. Signaling and Damaging Functions of Free Radicals in Aging-Free Radical Theory, Hormesis, and TOR. Aging And Disease. 2010;1(2):75-88.</ref> Thus several modifications have been proposed to integrate current research into the overall theory.

===Mitochondrial theory of aging ===

Mitochondrial theory of aging was first proposed in 1978.<ref>Lobachev A.N.{{citation | title = Role of mitochondrial processes in the development and aging of organism.

Aging And Disease. 2010;1(2):75-88.</ref> This theory has been widely debated<ref>Poovathingal SK, Gruber J, Halliwell B, Gunawan R. Stochastic drift in mitochondrial DNA point mutations: a novel perspective ex silico. Plos Computational Biology. 2009;5(11):e1000572-e.</ref> and it is still unclear how ROS induced mtDNA mutations develop.<ref>Afanas'ev I. Signaling and Damaging Functions of Free Radicals in Aging-Free Radical Theory, Hormesis, and TOR.

In vivo and in vitro iron-replaced zinc finger generates free radicals and causes DNA damage. The Journal Of Biological Chemistry. 1996;271(9):5125-30.</ref>

Afanas'ev suggests the superoxide dismutation activity of CuZnSOD demonstrates an important link between life span and free radicals.<ref>Afanas'ev I. Signaling and Damaging Functions of Free Radicals in Aging-Free Radical Theory, Hormesis, and TOR. Aging And Disease. 2010;1(2):75-88.</ref> The link between CuZnSOD and life span was demonstrated by Perez et al. who indicated mice life span was affected by the deletion of the Sod1 gene which encodes CuZnSOD.<ref>Pérez VI, Bokov A, Van Remmen H, Mele J, Ran Q, Ikeno Y, et al. Is the oxidative stress theory of aging dead? Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta. 2009;1790(10):1005-14.</ref>

===Epigenetic Oxidative Redox Shift (EORS) Theory of Aging===
Brewer proposed a theory which integrates the free radical theory of aging with the [[insulin]] signalling effects in aging.<ref>Brewer GJ. Epigenetic oxidative redox shift (EORS) theory of aging unifies the free radical and insulin signaling theories. Experimental Gerontology. 2010;45(3):173-9.</ref> Brewer’s theory suggests “sedentary behaviour associated with age triggers an oxidized [[redox]] shift and impaired mitochondrial function”.<ref>Brewer GJ. Epigenetic oxidative redox shift (EORS) theory of aging unifies the free radical and insulin signaling theories. Experimental Gerontology. 2010;45(3):173-9.</ref>  This mitochondrial impairment leads to more sedentary behaviour and accelerated aging.<ref>Brewer GJ. Epigenetic oxidative redox shift (EORS) theory of aging unifies the free radical and insulin signaling theories. Experimental Gerontology. 2010;45(3):173-9.</ref>

===Metabolic stability theory of aging===
The metabolic stability theory of aging suggests it is the cells ability to maintain stable concentration of ROS which is the primary determinant of lifespan.<ref>Brink TC, Demetrius L, Lehrach H, Adjaye J. Age-related transcriptional changes in gene expression in different organs of mice support the metabolic stability theory of aging. Biogerontology. 2009;10(5):549-64.</ref>  This theory criticizes the free radical theory because it ignores that ROS are specific signalling molecules which are necessary for maintaining normal cell functions.<ref>Brink TC, Demetrius L, Lehrach H, Adjaye J. Age-related transcriptional changes in gene expression in different organs of mice support the metabolic stability theory of aging. Biogerontology. 2009;10(5):549-64.</ref>

=== Mitohormesis ===
Oxidative stress may promote life expectancy of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' by inducing a secondary response to initially increased levels of reactive oxygen species.<ref name="Glucose Restriction">{{cite journal |author=Schulz TJ, Zarse K, Voigt A, Urban N, Birringer M, Ristow M |title=Glucose restriction extends Caenorhabditis elegans life span by inducing mitochondrial respiration and increasing oxidative stress |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=280–93 |year=2007 |pmid=17908557 |url=http://www.cellmetabolism.org/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS1550413107002562 |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.08.011}}</ref> This observation was initially named [[mitohormesis]], or [[mitochondria]]l [[hormesis]] on a purely [[hypothetical]] basis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tapia PC |title=Sublethal mitochondrial stress with an attendant stoichiometric augmentation of reactive oxygen species may precipitate many of the beneficial alterations in cellular physiology produced by caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary phytonutrients: "Mitohormesis" for health and vitality |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=832–43 |year=2006/2005(epub) |pmid=16242247 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.009}}</ref> In mammals, the question of the net effect of reactive oxygen species on aging is even less clear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sohal R, Mockett R, Orr W |title=Mechanisms of aging: an appraisal of the oxidative stress hypothesis |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=575–86 |year=2002 |pmid=12208343 |doi=10.1016/S0891-5849(02)00886-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sohal R |title=Role of oxidative stress and protein oxidation in the aging process |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |year=2002 |pmid=12086680 |doi=10.1016/S0891-5849(02)00856-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Rattan S |title=Theories of biological aging: genes, proteins, and free radicals |journal=Free Radic Res |volume=40 |issue=12 |pages=1230–8 |year=2006 |pmid=17090411 |doi=10.1080/10715760600911303}}</ref> Recent [[epidemiological]] findings support the process of mitohormesis in humans, and even suggest that the intake of exogenous antioxidants may increase disease [[prevalence]] in humans (according to the theory, because they prevent the stimulation of the organism's natural response to the oxidant compounds which not only neutralizes them but provides other benefits as well).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/297/8/842 |author=Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Gluud LL, Simonetti RG, Gluud C |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842}}.

=== Effects of calorie restriction ===

The increase in life expectancy observed during some calorie restriction studies which can occur with lack of decreases or even increases in O2 consumption is often inferred as opposing the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging.<ref>Afanas'ev I.

Thus, mitochondrial ROS production must be regulated independently of O2 consumption in a variety of species, tissues and physiologic states.<ref>Barja G.

== Antioxidant therapy ==
The free radical theory of aging implies that [[antioxidant]]s such as [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin E]] [[Alpha-Tocopherol|(alpha-tocopherol)]], [[Beta-Carotene|beta-carotene]] and [[Superoxide dismutase]] will slow the process of aging by preventing free radicals from [[Oxidative stress|oxidizing]] sensitive biological molecules or reducing the formation of free radicals. The antioxidant chemicals found in many foods are frequently cited as the basis of claims for the benefits of a high intake of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s in the diet.

Nonetheless, some recent studies tend to show that antioxidant therapy have no effect and can even increase [[mortality]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotine Cancer Prevention Study Group |title=The effect of vitamin E and beta carotine on the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers in male smokers |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |year=1994 |issue=  15|pages=1029–35 |pmid=8127329 |volume=330 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199404143301501}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Omenn GS, Goodman GE, Thornquist MD, Balmes J, Cullen MR, Glass A, et.al. |title=Effects of a combination of beta carotine and vitamin A on lung cancer and cardiovascular disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=1996|issue= 18|pages=1150–5|pmid=8602180 |volume=334 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199605023341802}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C|title=Antioxidant supplements for prevention of gastrointestinal cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Lancet|year=2004|issue= 9441|pages=1219–28|pmid=15464182 |volume=364 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17138-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller ER 3rd, Pastor-Barriuso R, Dalal D, Riemersma RA, Appel LG, Guallar E.|title=Meta-analysis: High-dosage vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=2005|issue= 1|pages=37–46|url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/142/1/37?ijkey=d086242f145a60d2f0e8541e1a5e5a726f66c1c0&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |pmid=15537682 |volume=142}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group|title=MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in 20,356 high-risk individuals: a randomised placebo-controlled trial|journal=Lancet|year=2002|issue= 9326|pages=23–33|pmid=12114037 |volume=360 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09328-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group|title=A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Clinical Trial of High-Dose Supplementation With Vitamins C and E and Beta Carotene for Age-Related Cataract and Vision Loss: AREDS Report No. 9|journal=Arch Ophthalmol|year=2001|issue= 10|pages=1439–52|pmid=11594943 |volume=119 |pmc=1472812 |doi=10.1001/archopht.119.10.1439}}</ref> 

Since many different substances operate synergistically in anti-oxidant defence, its complicated process may require more sophisticated approaches to determine if antioxidant therapy may benefit the aging process.

Proponents of the theory claim that this phenomenon can be explained by [[hormesis]]: The addition of antioxidants can lead to a decrease of normal biological response to free radicals and lead to a more sensitive environment to oxidation.<ref>Calabrese V, Cornelius C, Trovato A, Cavallaro M, Mancuso C, Di Rienzo L, et al. The hormetic role of dietary antioxidants in free radical-related diseases. Current Pharmaceutical Design. 2010;16(7):877-83.</ref> Furthermore, a recent study tracking the eating habits of 478,000 Europeans suggests that consuming lots of fruits and vegetables has little if any effect on preventing cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Boffetta P, Couto E, Wichmann J et al. |title=Fruit and vegetable intake and overall cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC|journal=J Natl Cancer Inst|year=2010|volume=102 |pages=529–37|pmid=20371762|issue=8 |doi=10.1093/jnci/djq072}}</ref>
