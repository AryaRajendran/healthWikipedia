'''Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor''' ('''GM-CSF''') is a [[protein]] secreted by [[macrophage]]s, [[T cell]]s, [[mast cells]], [[NK cells]], [[endothelial cell]]s and [[fibroblast]]s.

==Functions==
GM-CSF is a [[cytokine]] that functions as a [[white blood cell]] [[growth factor]]. GM-CSF stimulates [[stem cell]]s to produce [[granulocyte]]s ([[neutrophil]]s, [[eosinophil]]s, and [[basophil]]s) and [[monocyte]]s. Monocytes exit the circulation and migrate into tissue, whereupon they mature into [[macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, it is part of the [[immune system|immune]]/[[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[biochemical cascade|cascade]], by which activation of a small number of macrophages can rapidly lead to an increase in their numbers, a process crucial for fighting [[infection]]. The active form of the protein is found extracellularly as a [[homodimer]].

==Genetics==
The human gene has been localized to a cluster of related genes at chromosome region 5q31, which is known to be associated with interstitial deletions in the [[5q- syndrome]] and [[acute myelogenous leukemia]]. Genes in the cluster include those encoding [[Interleukin 4|interleukins 4]], [[Interleukin 5|5]], and [[Interleukin 13|13]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Entrez Gene: CSF2 colony stimulating factor 2 (granulocyte-macrophage)| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=1437| accessdate = }}</ref>

==Glycosylation==
Human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor is glycosylated in its mature form.

==Clinical significance==
GM-CSF is also known as [[molgramostim]] or, when the protein is expressed in [[yeast]] cells, [[sargramostim]] ('''Leukine''').

GM-CSF is used as a medication to stimulate the production of white blood cells following [[chemotherapy]].

GM-CSF has also recently been evaluated in clinical trials for its potential as a vaccine [[adjuvant]] in HIV-infected patients. The preliminary results have been promising<ref name=Natureref>{{Cite journal  | author=Breitbach CJ, et al. |title=Intravenous delivery of a multi-mechanistic cancer-targeted oncolytic poxvirus in humans |journal=Nature |volume=477 |issue= 7362 |pages= 99–102 |year= 2011 |pmid= 21886163 |doi= 10.1038/nature10358 }}</ref> but GM-CSF is not presently FDA-approved for this purpose.

===Leukine===

''Leukine'' is the trade name of sargramostim, recombinant yeast-derived GM-CSF developed at Immunex (now Amgen) and first given to six humans in 1987 as part of a compassionate-use protocol for the victims of the Goiânia cesium irradiation accident.<ref>{{cite web|author=By HAROLD M.

Its use was approved by U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for acceleration of white blood cell recovery following autologous [[bone marrow transplantation]] in patients with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[acute lymphocytic leukemia]], or [[Hodgkin's disease]] in March 1991.<ref name="urlDetails of Approved Claims by Line of Therapy">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/onctools/yearlistclaim.cfm?Approv_Date=1991 |title=Approval Summary for sargramostim |accessdate=20 September 2009 |date=5 March 1991 |work=Oncology Tools |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070624223312/www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/onctools/summary.cfm?ID=353 |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}</ref> In November 1996, the FDA also approved sargramostim for treatment of [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]]s and replenishment of  white blood cells following chemotherapy.<ref name="urlNewly Approved Drug Therapies (179): Leukine (sargramostim), Immunex">{{cite web| url = http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/drugs/dru179.html | title = Newly Approved Drug Therapies (179): Leukine (sargramostim), Immunex | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | work = | publisher = CenterWatch  | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 12 October 2008}}</ref>

=== Controversy ===

Berlex funded a study that ran in the May 26, 2005 issue of the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', which concluded that GM-CSF did produce significantly more remissions in [[Crohn's disease]] than those having received a placebo in the study, and it also decreased disease severity and improved [[quality of life]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Korzenik J, Dieckgraefe B, Valentine J, Hausman D, Gilbert M |title=Sargramostim for active Crohn's disease |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=352 |issue=21 |pages=2193–201 |year=2005 |pmid=15917384 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa041109}}</ref>

The study's lead author, Joshua Korzenik of [[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], is a paid consultant for Berlex, and co-inventor of the patent, which is owned by Washington University - St. Louis.<ref name="phoenix">{{cite web| url = http://www.thephoenix.com/Article.aspx?id=8920&page=1 | title = Med school drug pushers: How scientists are selling out to drug companies | author =  Bernstein DS| authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2006-04-12 | work = | publisher = The Boston Phoenix | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-10-12}}</ref>

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
GM-CSF is found in high levels in joints with [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and blocking GM-CSF may reduce the inflammation or damage. Some drugs (e.g. [[MOR103]]) are being developed to ''block'' GM-CSF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugdevelopment-technology.com/projects/mor103/ |title=MOR103 - Antibody for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Germany |year=2010 }}</ref>
