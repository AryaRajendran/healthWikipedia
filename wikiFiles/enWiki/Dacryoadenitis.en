'''Dacryoadenitis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[lacrimal gland]]s (the tear-producing glands).

==Causes, incidence, and risk factors==   
[[Acute (medical)|Acute]] dacryoadenitis is most commonly due to [[virus|viral]] or [[bacterium|bacteria]]l [[infection]]. Common causes include [[mumps]], [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[staphylococcus]], and [[gonococcus]].

Chronic dacryoadenitis is usually due to noninfectious inflammatory disorders. Examples include [[sarcoidosis]], thyroid eye disease, and orbital pseudotumor.

==Symptoms ==  

* Swelling of the outer portion of the upper lid, with possible redness and tenderness
* [[Pain]] in the area of swelling
* Excess tearing or discharge
* Swelling of [[lymph node]]s in front of the [[ear]]

==Signs and tests==   

Dacryoadenitis can be diagnosed by examination of the [[human eye|eye]]s and lids. Special tests such as a [[CT scan]] may be required to search for the cause. Sometimes [[biopsy]] will be needed to be sure that a [[tumor]] of the lacrimal gland is not present.

==Treatment==   

If the cause of dacryoadenitis is a viral condition such as mumps, simple rest and warm compresses may be all that is needed. For other causes, the treatment is specific to the causative disease.

==Prognosis==   

Most patients will fully recover from dacryoadenitis. For conditions with more serious causes, such as sarcoidosis, the [[prognosis]] is that of the underlying condition.

==Complications==

Swelling may be severe enough to put pressure on the eye and distort [[Visual perception|vision]]. Some patients first thought to have dacryoadenitis may turn out to have a [[malignancy]] of the lacrimal gland.

==Prevention==   

Mumps can be prevented by [[immunization]]. Gonococcus, bacteria can be avoided by the use of [[condom]]s. Most other causes cannot be prevented.
