A '''portosystemic shunt (PSS)''', also known as a '''liver shunt''', is a bypass of the [[liver]] by the body's [[circulatory system]].  It can be either a [[congenital disorder|congenital]] (present at birth) or acquired condition.  

Congenital PSS is a hereditary condition in [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, its frequency varying depending on the breed. The shunts found mainly in small dog breeds such as [[Shih Tzu]]s, [[Tibetan Spaniel]]s, [[Miniature Schnauzer]]s and [[Yorkshire Terrier]]s, and in cats such as [[Persian (cat)|Persian]]s, [[Himalayan (cat)|Himalayan]]s, and mixed breeds are usually extrahepatic (outside the liver), while the shunts found in large dog breeds such as [[Irish Wolfhound]]s and [[Labrador Retriever]]s tend to be intrahepatic (inside the liver).<ref name=Ettinger_1995>{{cite book|author=Ettinger, Stephen J.;Feldman, Edward C.|title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B. Saunders Company|year=1995|isbn=0-7216-6795-3}}</ref>  

Acquired PSS is uncommon and is found in dogs and cats with liver disease such as [[cirrhosis]] causing [[portal hypertension]], which is high blood pressure in the [[portal vein]].

==Pathology==
Congenital PSS is caused by the failure of the [[fetus|fetal]] circulatory system of the liver to change.  Normally, the blood from the [[placenta]] bypasses the liver and goes into circulation via the [[ductus venosus]], a blood vessel found in the fetus.  A failure of the ductus venosus to close causes an intrahepatic shunt, while extrahepatic shunts are usually a developmental abnormality of the [[vitelline veins]], which connect the [[portal vein]] to the [[inferior vena cava|caudal vena cava]].  Thus in the juvenile and adult animal with PSS, blood from the intestines only partly goes through the liver, and the rest mixes into general circulation.  Toxins such as [[ammonia]] are not cleared by the liver.  Most commonly, extrahepatic shunts are found connecting the portal vein or [[left gastric vein]] to the caudal vena cava.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller J, Fowler J |title=Laparoscopic Portosystemic Shunt Attenuation in Two Dogs |journal=J Am Anim Hosp Assoc |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=160–164 |year=2006 |pmid=16527918}}</ref>

Congenital shunts are usually solitary.  Acquired shunts are usually multiple, and are caused by portal hypertension in dogs with liver disease.  This is most commonly seen in older dogs with cirrhosis, but may also be seen in younger dogs with liver [[fibrosis]] caused by lobular dissecting [[hepatitis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Agg E |title=Acquired extrahepatic portosystemic shunts in a young dog |journal=Can Vet J |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=697–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16898115 |pmc=1482449}}</ref>

==Symptoms and diagnosis==
Symptoms of congenital PSS usually appear by six months of age<ref name=Ettinger_1995/> and include failure to gain weight, vomiting, and signs of [[hepatic encephalopathy]] (a condition where toxins normally removed by the liver accumulate in the blood and impair the function of brain cells) such as [[seizure]]s, depression, tremors, drooling, and head pressing.  Urate [[bladder stone (animal)|bladder stone]]s may form because of increased amounts of [[uric acid]] in circulation and excreted by the [[kidney]]s.  Initial diagnosis of PSS is through laboratory bloodwork showing either elevated serum [[bile acid]]s after eating or elevation of fasting blood ammonia levels, which has been shown to have a higher [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] than the bile acids test.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerritzen-Bruning M, van den Ingh T, Rothuizen J |title=Diagnostic value of fasting plasma ammonia and bile acid concentrations in the identification of portosystemic shunting in dogs |journal=J Vet Intern Med |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=13–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16496918 |doi=10.1892/0891-6640(2006)20[13:DVOFPA]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>  Rectal portal [[nuclear medicine|scintigraphy]] using [[technetium|<sup>99m</sup>technetium pertechnetate]], a technique of imaging involving detection of [[gamma ray]]s emitted by [[radionuclide]]s absorbed through the rectum and into the bloodstream, demonstrates the blood vessel bypassing the liver.  Surgery definitively shows the shunt if it is extrahepatic.

==Treatment==
Surgical treatment is best, when it can be performed.  Pressure within the portal vein is measured as the shunt is closed, and it must be kept below 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or else portal hypertension will ensue.<ref name=Ettinger_1995/>  Complete closure of extrahepatic shunts results in a very low recurrence rate, while incomplete closure results in a recurrence rate of about 50 percent.  However, not all dogs with extrahepatic shunts tolerate complete closure (16 to 68 percent).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frankel D, Seim H, MacPhail C, Monnet E |title=Evaluation of cellophane banding with and without intraoperative attenuation for treatment of congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts in dogs |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=228 |issue=9 |pages=1355–60 |year=2006 |pmid=16649938 |doi=10.2460/javma.228.9.1355}}</ref>  Intrahepatic shunts are much more difficult to surgically correct than extrahepatic shunts due to their hidden nature, large vessel size, and greater tendency toward portal hypertension when completely closed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Adin C, Sereda C, Thompson M, Wheeler J, Archer L |title=Outcome associated with use of a percutaneously controlled hydraulic occluder for treatment of dogs with intrahepatic portosystemic shunts |journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc |volume=229 |issue=11 |pages=1749–55 |year=2006 |pmid=17144820 |doi=10.2460/javma.229.11.1749}}</ref>  When surgery is not an option, PSS is treated as are other forms of [[liver failure]].  Dietary protein restriction is helpful to lessen signs of hepatic encephalopathy, and [[antibiotic]]s such as [[neomycin]] or [[metronidazole]] and other medicines such as [[lactulose]] can reduce ammonia production and absorption in the intestines.  The [[prognosis]] is guarded for any form of PSS.

==Heredity==
The intrahepatic shunts found in large dog breeds are passed on in a simple autosomal recessive way, while the extrahepatic shunts of the small breeds are inherited on a polygenic basis.<ref name=VIN>{{cite web | last = Rothuizen | first = Jan | title = Molecular Genetics-Diseases of the Liver | work = Proceedings of the 27th WSAVA Conference | date = 2002 | url = http://www.vin.com/proceedings/Proceedings.plx?CID=WSAVA2002&PID=2623 | accessdate = 2006-11-14 }}</ref>
