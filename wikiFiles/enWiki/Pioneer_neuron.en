'''Pioneer neuron''' is a cell that is a derivative of [[preplate]] in the early stages of [[corticogenesis]] of the brain. Pioneer neurons settle in the marginal zone of the cortex and project to sub-cortical levels. In the rat, pioneer neurons are only present in prenatal brains. Unlike [[Cajal-Retzius cell]]s, these neurons are [[Reelin|Reln]]-negative.

Pioneer neurons are born in the ventricular [[neuroepithelium]] all over the cortical [[primordium]]. In the rat cortex, they appear at embryonic day (E) 11.5 in the lateral aspect of the [[telencephalic]] vesicle and cover its whole surface on E12. These cells, which show intense immunoreactivity for [[calbindin]] and [[calretinin]], are characterized by their large size and axonal projection. They remain in the marginal zone after the formation of the [[cortical plate]]; they project first into the ventricular zone, and then into the [[subplate]] and the [[internal capsule]]. Therefore, these cells are the origin of the earliest efferent pathway of the developing cortex. 

== Function ==

It is thought that axons of pioneer neurons serve as a pathway for additional neurons that develop later in the embryo and project their axons to the appropriate target. In many systems pioneer neurons are eliminated by programmed cell-death and are not present in the adult.
