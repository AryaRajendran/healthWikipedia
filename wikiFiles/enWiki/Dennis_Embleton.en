==Early life==
Dennis Embleton was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] on 1 October 1810.

His father, Thomas Embleton was born in [[East Chevington]] and his mother Anne (née Cawood) from [[Alwinton]] village which is west of [[Alnwick]] and at the head of the [[River Coquet]]. He had an elder brother Thomas William Embleton,<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas William Embleton - Yorkshire Geological Society|url=http://pygs.lyellcollection.org/content/12/4/335.extract}}</ref> was trained as a mining engineer and moved in 1831 to [[Middleton, Leeds|Middleton]], [[Leeds]], to the position of colliery viewer<ref>{{cite web|title=mining occupations|url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/educate/mineocc.htm}}</ref>

His father died in 1820, and Dennis and his brother Thomas were brought up by an uncle, George Hill, also a colliery viewer, of [[Kenton]], Newcastle.<ref name=AAelObitMisc>{{cite web|title= Archaeologia aeliana – Obituary notice of Dennis Embleton|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiaael06unkngoog/archaeologiaael06unkngoog_djvu.txt}}</ref>

Both he and his brother Thomnas William were educated at [[Witton-le-Wear]] Grammar School, [[County Durham]], under the Rev. George Newby.

After leaving Witton School, he started his apprenticeship on 23 April 1827, bound to a Mr. T. Leighton, the Senior Surgeon at [[Royal Victoria Infirmary|Newcastle Infirmary]] for a period of five years, the cost of which to his guardian, was £500, not an inconsiderately sum in those days. He left Newcastle before the end of his apprenticeship, with the permission and consent of Mr. Leighton, to complete his studies in [[London]] at [[Guy's Hospital]], [[St Thomas' Hospital]], [[Edward Grainger|Grainger's anatomical school]] at Maze Pond (in London), and probably also at [[George Pilcher|Pilcher's School of Anatomy]].

He qualified in 1834 and after working for around a year, he went off with another medical student, William Croser, to spend the next two years travelling, mainly on foot, around Europe, both of course speaking French and Italian very well.

==Marriage & family==
He was married in 1847 in in [[Whickham]] to Miss Elizabeth Turner (died 1869), who also had a great interest in nature and the sciences; They had three children :-

==Dialect==
Dr Dennis Embleton had a keen interest in languages, and also in the local Geordie dialect, and wrote a document on the peculiarities of the local dialect in 1887, followed by a “canny little poem” called “The Ahd Pitman's Po'try tiv ees Marrah”. This poem appeared in the Newcastle Courant around 1890 with no indication of authorship, but [[Thomas Allan (publisher)|Thomas Allan]] in his [[Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings|Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs]] attributed it to Embleton. This was later shown to be correct when details of his works were produced and printed with his bibliography details in his official obituary.
