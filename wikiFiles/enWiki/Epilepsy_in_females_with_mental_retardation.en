'''Epilepsy in Females with Mental Retardation (EFMR)''' has been identified through the incidence of female seizure sufferers in a family over several generations. The first family was reported in 1971 in the ''[[Journal of Pediatrics]]''. The striking pattern of onset at a young age, seizure patterns, test and laboratory results, potential developmental delays or developmental regression and associated disorders, eases diagnosis. Through the identification of genetic markers, diagnosis can be made through genetic testing.<ref name=scheffer>{{ cite journal| author= Scheffer, Ingrid, et. al. | title= Epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females: an under-recognized disorder |year=2007 |journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology | publisher=Oxford Journals | volume=131 | issue=4 | pages=918–927 | url= http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/4/918.full }}</ref>

Based on a study conducted by the Epilepsy Research Center at the [[University of Melbourne]]'s Department of Medicine estimated in 2007<ref>''Brain: A Journal of Neurology''</ref> that two thirds of EFMR patients have [[borderline intellectual functioning]] or [[intellectual disability]]. There appears to be a connection to [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[autism]], [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]] and [[aggressive behavior]]s and other psychiatric disorders.<ref name=scheffer/>

== Studies ==

=== Initial study ===

EFMR was first described in a family in [[North America]] in 1971 in the ''[[Journal of Pediatrics]]'' and twice in the 1990s.{{#tag:ref|EFMR was first described in three consecutive reports: 1) Juberg, R.C.; Hellman, C.D. "A new familial form of convulsive disorder and mental retardation limited to females." ''[[Journal of Pediatrics]]'' 1971;79:726-32.; 2) Fabisiak, K.; Erickson, R.P. "A familial form of convulsive disorder with or without mental retardation limited to females: extension of a pedigree limits possible genetic mechanisms.''Clinical Genetics.'' 1990;38:353-8.; 3) Ryan SG, et. al. "Epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females: an X-linked dominant disorder with male sparing." ''Nature Genetics'' 1997;17:92-5.|group="nb"}} The [[syndrome]] in this family was characterized by the occurrence of childhood seizures. Some of the girls showed developmental regression with intellectual disabilities that ranged from mild to profound. The disorder has an unusual inheritance pattern. It is considered [[X-linked]] dominant with male carriers. Women and men with the affected gene can transmit the disease. The men expressed a normal [[phenotype]]. The disorder was shown to be linked to [[mutation]]s via Xq22 [[microsatellite]] markers.{{#tag:ref|The disorder that affected the families was shown to be linked to genetic mutations via Xq22 markers. The discovery was reported in two publications: 1) Ryan, S.G.; et al. "Epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females: an X-linked dominant disorder with male sparing." ''Nature Genetics'' 1997;17:92-5. 2) Dibbens, L.M (2010).

=== University of Melbourne study ===

Published in 2007, a study was completed of four families with 58 individuals by the Epilepsy Resource Center at the University of Melbourne. The study included [[CT Scan]] and [[MRI]] imaging, [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) testing, neurological exams, intellectual assessment and questionnaires to identify seizure history. It was found that the EFMR seizures generally began in females when they were infants, with mean onset at 14 months. They were likely to include an accompanying fever and may include convulsions. Seizures were of various types{{#tag:ref|included [[partial seizures|partial]], tonic, [[tonic-clonic seizures|tonic-clonic]], [[myoclonus]], [[absence seizure|absences]] and [[atonic seizures]].<ref name=scheffer/>|group="nb"}} and appeared in clusters. Many seizures of short duration occur over a period of several days. The EEG test results showed "[[generalized epilepsy|generalized]] and [[focal epilepsy|focal epileptiform]] abnormalities."  [[Fixation (psychology)|Obsessive]] and aggressive behavioral characteristics and [[Autistic spectrum|autistim]] were common associated disorders.<ref name=scheffer/><ref name=Reutens>{{cite journal |author= Reutens, D.C; et. al. |title=Validation of a questionnaire for clinical seizure diagnosis. |journal=Epilepsia |publisher=| date=Nov/Dec 1992 | volume=33 | issue=6 | pages=1065–71| pmid=1464265 }}</ref>

Over the course of the female patients' childhoods, intellectual development was delayed in some cases, normal and then regressive in others and in some cases there was normal intellectual development. 67% of the females had mild to profound intellectual disability (ID) or [[borderline intellectual functioning]]. Some of the patients in the study were also with [[Angelman syndrome]], [[sodium channel]]opathies or forms of [[Rett syndrome]]. The EFMR seizures generally ended later in the girl's childhood (mean age of 12 years), yet some continued into adulthood. Men and women are carriers of the disorder, although men do not generally exhibit EFMR history such as seizures and intellectual development issues, although 5 fathers in the 4 families had obsessive and controlling tendencies. The linkage of chromosome Xq22.1 to EFMR was confirmed in all of the families.<ref name=scheffer/>

A study in Florence, Italy by Dr. Carla Marini of 116 individuals, published in 2010, found a causal relationship between the PCDH19 gene and early onset female seizures,<ref name=Marini>{{cite journal |author= Marini C |title=Infantile onset focal epilepsy and epilepetic encephalopathies associated with PCDH19 gene mutations: New de novo and familial mutations. |date=June 29, 2010 |page= 1| journal=9th European Congress on Epileptology |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2010.02658.x/pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2010.02658.x}}</ref> as did Dr. N.

Other recent studies, such as L.M. Dibbens's work as reported in ''Neurology'' in 2011 that found instances where patients had PCDH19 mutation, but their parents did not. They found that "[[gonadal mosaicism]] of a PCDH19 mutation in a parent is an important molecular mechanism associated with the inheritance of EFMR.<ref name="Dibbens et col">{{cite journal |author= Dibbens, L.M.; et.al. |title=Recurrence risk of epilepsy and mental retardation in females due to parental mosaicism of PCDH19 mutations |year=2010 |journal= Neurology | date=April 26, 2011 | volume=76 | issue=17 | pages=1514–1519 |url= http://www.neurology.org/content/76/17/1514.abstract| doi=10.1212/WNL.0b013e318217e7b6  }}</ref>

A study in Denmark of 18 unrelated females was reported in 2011 in ''Epilepsia'' by Dr. Hellen Hjalrim and others. One-third of subjects who exhibited early-onset EFMR-like symptoms had the PCDH19 mutations. Four men and women had the mutation but no symptoms. Most (15/18) had tested negative for SCN1A previously. They discovered a correlation between some females with early onset seizures and EFMR, based upon the presence of PCDH19 mutations.<ref name=Denmark-study>{{cite journal |author=Hjalgrim, Hellen |title= Expansion of the Phenotype associated with PCDH19 mutations |journal=Epilepsia  | volume=52 | issue=Supplement s6 | date=August 24, 2011| page= 18 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03206.x/pdf | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03206.x}}</ref>  A study in Japan of 116 individuals was reported with similar findings.<ref name=Higurashi>{{cite journal |author= Higurashi, N.|title= PCDH19 mutation in Japanese females with epilepsy |date=November 1, 2011 |journal=Epilepsy Research | pmid=22050978 |doi=10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2011.10.014 |volume=99 |issue=1-2 |pages=28–37}}</ref>

==Causes==
===Genetics===
Men and women can transmit the PCDH19 mutation, although women but not men usually exhibit symptoms. Women with a mutation have a 50% chance of having children who are carriers. Males have a 100% chance of transmitting the mutation to a daughter and 0% chance to a son.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Scheffer, Ingrid.; et. al. | title= Epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females: an under-recognized disorder: Genetic tree diagram  |year=2007 |journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology | publisher=Oxford Journals | volume=131 | issue=4 | pages=918–927 | url= http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/4/918/F1.large.jpg }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Scheffer, Ingrid.; et. al. |title= Epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females: an under-recognized disorder: Family tree of genealogical study |year=2007 |journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology | publisher=Oxford Journals | volume=131 | issue=4 | pages=918–927 | url= http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/4/918/T1.expansion.html}}</ref>  The striking pattern of onset at a young age, seizure patterns, test and laboratory results, potential developmental delays or developmental regression and associated disorders, ease diagnosis. Through the identification of the genetic markers in studied families, diagnosis of an individual can be made through genetic testing.<ref name=scheffer/>

===Possible association with immunizations===
There appears to be an association in some cases between [[vaccination]]s and seizures with patients with [[Dravet syndrome]] (DS), [[Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus]] (GEFS+)<ref name=vac-Petrelli/> and seizures in females with mental retardation (EFMR).<ref name=firessyndrome>{{ cite journal| author= Specchio, Nichola| title= Acute-onset epilepsy triggered by fever mimicking FIRES febrile infection–related epilepsy syndrome: The role of protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) gene mutation |journal= Epilepsia | volume=52 | issue=11 | pages=e172–e175 | date=November 2011 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03193.x/abstract | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03193.x}}</ref>  An Italian multicentric study of the relationship between vaccinations and seizure occurrence found that vaccines were a trigger for seizures in 25% of the studied cases, but do not appear to affect the progression of seizures over time.<ref name=vac-Petrelli>{{cite journal | author=Petrelli C; et. al |title= Relation between vaccination and occurrence of seizures in SCN1A mutation positive patients: the first Italian multicentric study |journal=Epilepsia  | volume=52 | issue=Supplement s6 |page=7 |date=24 AUG 2011 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03206.x/pdf | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03206.x}}</ref>

New vaccines that have emerged in the past 10 years have reduced the incidence of seizures following vaccination. [[Acellular]] [[pertussis vaccine]] is an example of one such vaccine.<ref name=vacunaygenetica>{{cite journal |author=Brown, Natasha; Berkovic, Samuel F.; Scheffer, Ingrid E | title= Vaccination, seizures and 'vaccine damage' |journal= Current Opinion in Neurology |url= http://journals.lww.com/co-neurology/Abstract/2007/04000/Vaccination,_seizures_and__vaccine_damage_.11.aspx | date=April 2007 | volume=20 | issue=2  | pages=181–187 | doi=10.1097/WCO.0b013e3280555160}}</ref>

==Classification==
Due to its recent discovery, EFMR does not have a specific classification according to the [[International League Against Epilepsy]]. Scheffer proposed at the XXIX International Congress of Epilepsy in Rome in August 2011 that this form of epilepsy be grouped with genetic epilepsies.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

EFMR is thought to develop based upon a deficiency of the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion PCDH19 (protocadherin 19) gene.<ref name=PCHD19>{{cite journal |title= PCDH19 Gene |journal= Genetic Home Reference |url= http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PCDH19 | publisher=Genetics Home Reference, U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=December 30, 2011. }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Cell adhesion is mediated by cell surface proteins.|group="nb"}} Its [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]] and [[pathophysiology]] (cause and mechanisms by which damage occurs) are different from other epilepsies, although the symptoms are very similar to other epileptic syndromes, such as [[Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus]] (GEFS+), [[Dravet's syndrome|Dravet syndrome]] with [[SCN1A]] negative, FIRES (febrile infection–related epilepsy syndrome) [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] or epilepsy of unknown origin.<ref name=firessyndrome/>

==Treatment==
===Clinical diagnosis===
It occurs almost exclusively in girls, has been associated with febrile seizures or following immunization in the first stage of life, normally before three years old.<ref name=scheffer/> Vaccines can trigger (not cause) seizures, especially the vaccine for [[pertussis vaccine|pertussis]]-[[diphtheria]]-[[tetanus vaccine|tetanus]], as happens with [[Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus]] (Dravet Syndrome).<ref name=Vaccine>{{cite journal |author= Berg, Anne T. |title= Seizure Risk with Vaccination  |journal=Epilepsy Currents  | publisher=American Epilepsy Society | date=January, 2002 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=15–16 | doi=10.1046/j.1535-7597.2002.00002.x | pmc=320893 | pmid=15309176}}</ref>

Seizures often occur with fever and/or convulsions and manifests in episodes of cluster seizures (many seizures in a day) and onset is usually before three years of age. Reversal of acquired intellectual capability over the course of childhood is possible, generally within three years of EFMR onset. Individuals with EFMR as GEFS+ present with a range of [[seizure types]] ([[partial seizures|partial]], tonic, [[tonic-clonic seizures|tonic-clonic]], [[myoclonus]], [[absence seizure|absences]] and [[atonic seizures]]).<ref name=scheffer/><ref name=Denmark-study/>

===Diagnostic test===
The test is particularly indicated in girls who have had cluster seizures in series. It is also recommended for patients who are diagnosed GEFS+ and when the seizures are associated with fever, infection, experienced regression, delayed cognitive growth or behavioral problems. The test is ordered by [[neurologist]]s. The diagnostic test can be done by drawing blood or saliva of the patient and their immediate family. It is analyzed in laboratories that specialize in [[Genetic testing]]. Genetic testing can aid in a firmer diagnosis and understanding of the disorder, may aid in identifying the optimal treatment plan and if positive, testing of the parents can determine if they are carriers. (See [[Genetic Counseling]]){{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Developmental problems===
From the University of Melbourne study, two thirds of EFMR patients have [[borderline intellectual functioning]] or [[intellectual disability]], while one third have normal intelligence. A connection to [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[autism]], [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]] and [[aggressive behavior]]s and other disorders has been observed.<ref name=scheffer/>

It is not yet clear why some people experience delayed intellectual growth and others regress with epilepsy. Currently researchers disagree, some believing that the genetic load is responsible for developmental disorders and that seizures in themselves are not capable of causing brain damage if they are not prolonged.<ref name=scheffer/><ref name=epilepsycare>{{cite web| title=Seizures and Epilepsy: Hope Through Research |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/epilepsy/detail_epilepsy.htm | publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |accessdate=December 30, 2011 }}</ref>

===Drug therapy===
[[Antiepileptic drugs]] (AEDs) are used in most cases to control seizures, but severe cases express high drug resistance. Patients may respond well to treatment with [[levetiracetam]] and in cases of drug resistance, an alternative treatment is [[stiripentol]]. [[Galaxolona]] is a [[neurosteroid]] that is currently in Phase III clinical trials and may offer an alternative therapy. No specific protocol or published research specifically supports the use of these drugs. All information about drug therapy here are from the experience of experts in the last International Epilepsy Congress.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Urgent care===
At the hospital, physicians follow standard protocol for managing seizures. Cluster seizures are generally controlled by [[benzodiazepines]] such as [[diazepam]], midolazam, [[lorazepam]] or [[clonazepam]]. The use of [[oxygen therapy|oxygen]] is recommended in the United States, but in Europe it is only recommended in cases of prolonged epileptic status.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/seizuresandepilepsy/nr049103.pdf Seizures and Epilepsy]</ref>

Until Dr. [[Adrian Bird]]´s experiment with mice, it was assumed that all encephalopathies or cognitive impairments was irreversible, but Dr. Bird showed that is not always the case. During the experiment Bird blocked MECP2 protein and males died and females developed Rett syndrome (seizures, cognitive and psychomotor problems, respiratory problems, etc.)  When the researcher reversed the situation and let the MECP2 protein work properly, the mice recovered. This research revolutionized understanding regarding genetic syndromes that present with neurological impairment or intellectual disabilities. Ethical considerations affect human experimentation that do not affect mice experiments.<ref name=Abird>{{cite journal |author= Bird Adrian |title= Reversal of Neurological Defects in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome |journal= Science | date=February 23, 2007 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/315/5815/1143.abstract | volume=315 | issue=5815 | pages=1143–1147 | doi=10.1126/science.1138389 }}</ref>
