'''Somatostatin''' (also known as '''growth hormone-inhibiting hormone''' ('''GHIH''') or '''somatotropin release-inhibiting factor''' ('''SRIF''')) or '''somatotropin release-inhibiting hormone'''{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} is a [[peptide hormone]] that regulates the [[endocrine system]] and affects [[neurotransmission]] and [[cell proliferation]] via interaction with [[G protein-coupled]] [[somatostatin receptors]] and inhibition of the release of numerous secondary hormones.

Somatostatin has two active forms produced by alternative cleavage of a single preproprotein: one of 14 [[amino acid]]s, the other of 28 amino acids.<ref name="GP5416">{{cite web | url = http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch4/s5ch4_16.htm | title = Sect. 5, Ch. 4: Structure, Synthesis, and Secretion of Somatostatin | accessdate = 2008-02-19 | author = Costoff A | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | work = Endocrinology: The Endocrine Pancreas | publisher = Medical College of Georgia | pages = page 16 | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = }}</ref>

==Production==
===Digestive system===

Somatostatin is secreted in several locations in the digestive system:
* [[stomach]]
* [[intestine]]
* [[delta cells]] of the [[pancreas]]<ref name="isbn0-7817-3919-5">{{cite book | author = Costanzo, Linda S. | title = Physiology | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Hagerstown, MD | year = 2003 | edition = 3rd | pages = 280 | isbn = 0-7817-3919-5 | oclc = | doi = }}</ref>

|}
Somatostatin is produced by [[neuroendocrine]] neurons of the [[periventricular nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]]. These neurons project to the [[median eminence]], where somatostatin is released from neurosecretory nerve endings into the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypothalamo-hypophysial system]] through neuron axons. Somatostatin is then carried to the [[anterior pituitary gland]], where it inhibits the secretion of [[growth hormone]] from [[somatotrope]] cells. The somatostatin neurons in the periventricular nucleus mediate negative feedback effects of [[growth hormone]] on its own release; the somatostatin neurons respond to high circulating concentrations of [[growth hormone]] and [[somatomedin]]s by increasing the release of somatostatin, so reducing the rate of secretion of [[growth hormone]].

Somatostatin is also produced by several other populations that project centrally, i.e., to other areas of the brain, and somatostatin receptors are expressed at many different sites in the brain. In particular, there are populations of somatostatin neurons in the [[arcuate nucleus]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the [[hippocampus]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and the brainstem [[nucleus of the solitary tract]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Actions==
[[Image:Control-of-stomach-acid-sec.png|thumb|350px|[[D cell (biology)|D cell]] is visible at upper-right, and somatostatin is represented by middle arrow pointing left]]

Somatostatin is classified as an [[inhibitory]] hormone,<ref name="GP5416" /> whose actions are spread to different parts of the body:

===Anterior pituitary===
In the [[anterior pituitary gland]], the effects of somatostatin are:
* Inhibit the release of [[growth hormone]] (GH)<ref name="titleSomatostatin">{{cite web | url = http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/somatostatin.html | title = Somatostatin | accessdate = 2008-02-19 | author = Bowen R | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2002-12-14 | work = Biomedical Hypertextbooks | publisher = Colorado State University | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = }}</ref> (thus opposing the effects of [[Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone]] (GHRH))
* Inhibit the release of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH)<ref>First Aid for the USMLE Step 1, 2010. Page 286.</ref>
* It is induced by low pH.
* Inhibit adenylyl cyclase in parietal cells.

===Gastrointestinal system===

* Somatostatin is homologous with [[CORT|cortistatin]] (see [[somatostatin family]]) and suppresses the release of [[gastrointestinal hormone]]s
** [[Gastrin]]
** [[Cholecystokinin]] (CCK)
** [[Secretin]]
** [[Motilin]]
** [[Vasoactive intestinal peptide]] (VIP)
** [[Gastric inhibitory polypeptide]] (GIP)
** [[Enteroglucagon]]
* Decrease rate of gastric emptying, and reduces smooth muscle contractions and blood flow within the intestine<ref name="titleSomatostatin"/>
* Suppresses the release of pancreatic hormones
** Inhibits [[insulin]] release when somatostatin is released from delta cells of pancreas<ref name="GP5417">{{cite web | url = http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section5/5ch4/s5ch4_17.htm | title = Sect. 5, Ch. 4: Structure, Synthesis, and Secretion of Somatostatin | accessdate = 2008-02-19 | author = Costoff A | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | work = Endocrinology: The Endocrine Pancreas | publisher = Medical College of Georgia | pages = page 17 | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = }}</ref>
** Inhibits the release of [[glucagon]]<ref name="GP5417"/>
* Suppresses the exocrine secretory action of [[pancreas]].

==Synthetic substitutes==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}
'''[[Octreotide]]''' (brand name ''Sandostatin'', [[Novartis|Novartis Pharmaceuticals]]) is an [[peptide|octapeptide]] that mimics natural somatostatin pharmacologically, though is a more potent inhibitor of [[growth hormone]], glucagon, and [[insulin]] than the natural hormone and has a much longer [[half-life]] (approximately 90 minutes, compared to 2–3 minutes for somatostatin). Since it is absorbed poorly from the gut, it is administered parenterally (subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously). It is indicated for [[symptomatic treatment]] of  [[carcinoid syndrome]] and [[acromegaly]]. It is also finding increased use in polycystic diseases of the liver and kidney.

'''[[Lanreotide]]''' (INN) is a medication used in the management of acromegaly and symptoms caused by neuroendocrine tumors, most notably carcinoid syndrome. It is a long-acting analogue of somatostatin, like octreotide.

[[Lanreotide]] (as lanreotide acetate) is manufactured by [[Ipsen]] and marketed under the trade name Somatuline. It is available in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, and was approved for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 30, 2007.

==Evolutionary history==
There are six somatostatin genes that have been discovered in [[vertebrates]]. The current proposed history as to how these six genes arose is based on the three whole-genome duplication events that took place in vertebrate evolution along with local duplications in [[teleost]] fish. An ancestral somatostatin gene was duplicated during the first whole-genome duplication event (1R) to create SS1 and SS2. These two genes were duplicated during the second whole-genome duplication event (2R) to create four new somatostatin genes: SS1, SS2, SS3, and one gene that was lost during the evolution of vertebrates. [[Tetrapods]] retained SS1 (also known as SS-14 and SS-28) and SS2 (also known as [[Cortistatin (neuropeptide)|cortistatin]]) after the split in the [[sarcopterygii]] and [[actinopterygii]] lineage split. In [[teleost]] fish, SS1, SS2, and SS3 were duplicated during the third whole-genome duplication event (3R) to create SS1, SS2, SS4, SS5, and two genes that were lost during the evolution of teleost fish. SS1 and SS2 went through local duplications to give rise to SS6 and SS3.<ref name="Liu"/>
