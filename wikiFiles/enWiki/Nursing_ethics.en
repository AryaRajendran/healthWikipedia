'''Nursing ethics''' is a branch of [[applied ethics]] that concerns itself with activities in the field of [[nursing]]. Nursing ethics shares many principles with [[medical ethics]], such as [[beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]], [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] and respect for [[autonomy]]. It can be distinguished by its emphasis on relationships, human [[dignity]] and collaborative care.

==Development of subject==
The nature of nursing means that nursing ethics tends to examine the ethics of caring rather than 'curing' by exploring the everyday interaction between the nurse and the person in care.<ref name="REP">{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=G.|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor=Craig E|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1998|volume=7|pages=56–57|isbn=978-0-415-18712-1}}</ref><ref name=Storch>{{cite book|last=Storch|first=J.L.|title=A Companion to Bioethics|year=2009|publisher=Blackwells|location=Chichester UK|isbn=9781405163316|pages=551–562|editor=Kuhse H & Singer P.|chapter=Ethics in Nursing Practice}}</ref> Early work to define ethics in nursing focused more on the [[virtue ethics|virtues]] that would make a good nurse, which historically included loyalty to the physician, rather than the focus being on nurse's conduct in relation to the person in the nurse's care.<ref name = "Storch"/> However, recently, the ethics of nursing has also shifted more towards the nurse's obligation to respect the human rights of the patient and this is reflected in a number of professional codes for nurses.<ref>{{cite book| author=McHale, J & Gallagher, A|title=Nursing and Human Rights|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann| year=2003|isbn=0-7506-5292-6}}</ref> For example, this is made explicit in the latest code from the [[International Council of Nurses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icn.ch/icncode.pdf|title=The ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses|year=2006|publisher=International Council of Nurses|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref>

==Distinctive nature==
Although much of nursing ethics can appear similar to [[medical ethics]], there are some factors that differentiate it. Brier-Mackie<ref>{{cite journal|last=Breier-Mackie|first=Sarah|title=Medical Ethics and Nursing Ethics: Is There Really Any Difference?|journal=Gastroenterology Nursing|year=2006|month=March/April|volume=29|issue=2|pages=182–3|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/pdf.asp?AID=641332|accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref> suggests that nurses' focus on care and nurture, rather than cure of illness, results in a distinctive ethics. Furthermore, nursing ethics emphasizes the ethics of everyday practice rather than [[moral dilemma]]s.<ref name ="Storch"/> Nursing ethics is more concerned with developing the caring relationship than broader principles, such as beneficence and justice.<ref name="Tschudin">{{cite book|last=Tschudin|first=Verena|title=Ethics in Nursing: the caring relationship|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Edinburgh|year=2003|edition=3rd|isbn=978-0-7506-5265-0}}</ref> For example, a concern to promote beneficence may be expressed in traditional medical ethics by the exercise of [[paternalism]], where the health professional makes a decision based upon a perspective of acting in the patient's best interests. However, it is argued by some that this approach acts against person-centred values found in nursing ethics.<ref name="Rumbold 1999">{{cite book| author=Rumbold, G|title=Ethics in Nursing Practice|publisher=Balliere Tindall| year=1999|isbn=0-7020-2312-4}}</ref> 

The distinction can be examined from different theoretical angles. Despite the move toward more [[deontological]] themes by some, there continues to be an interest in [[virtue ethics]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Alan|title=Nursing Ethics: A Virtue-Based Approach|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=978-0-230-50688-6}}</ref> in nursing ethics and some support for an [[ethic of care]].<ref name="Tschudin"/> This is considered by its advocates to emphasise relationships over abstract principles and therefore to reflect the caring relationship in nursing more accurately than other ethical views. Themes that emphasize the dignity of the [[patient]] by promoting a respectful and caring attitude from nurses are also commonly seen.

==Some themes in nursing ethics==

Nurses seek to defend the dignity of those in their care.<ref name = "RCN">{{cite book|last=Baille L, Gallagher A. & Wainwright P.|title=Defending Dignity|publisher=Royal College of Nursing|year=2008|url=http://www.rcn.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/166655/003257.pdf}}</ref> Being able to respond to the [[vulnerability]] of patients in a way that provides dignifying care is a key concept in the field.<ref name=Gastmans>{{cite journal|last=Gastmans|first=C.|title=Dignity-enhancing nursing care: A foundational ethical framework|journal=Nursing Ethics|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=2013|volume=20|issue=2|pages=142–149|doi=10.1177/0969733012473772|accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> 

In terms of standard [[ethical theory]], respecting dignity can also be aligned with having a respect for people and their autonomous choices. People are then enabled to make decisions about their own treatment. Amongst other things this grounds the practice of [[informed consent]] that should be respected by the nurse.<ref name="Rumbold 1999"/> Although much of the debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable to make choices about their own treatment due to being [[capacity (law)|incapacitated]] or having a [[mental illness]] that affects their judgement. A suggested way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an [[advance directive]], outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of them not being able to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted paternalism.

Another theme is [[confidentiality]] and this is an important principle in many nursing ethical codes. This is where information about the person is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared to comply with a higher duty such as preserving life.<ref name="Rumbold 1999"/> Related to information giving is the debate relating to  [[honesty|truth telling]] in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but sometimes people will ask not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications.<ref name="Tuckett">{{cite journal|last=Tuckett|first=A.|year=2004|title=Truth-Telling in Clinical Practice and the Arguments for and Against: a review of the literature|journal=Nursing Ethics|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|volume=11|issue=5|pages=500–513|url=http://nej.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/5/500|doi=10.1191/0969733004ne728oa|pmid=15362359}}</ref> Finally, the role of [[empirical ethics]] has become prominent in recent years.<ref name="Gastmans"/>

By giving consideration to the themes above, the nurse can endeavour to practice in an ethical way. Unfortunately,this key outcome in nursing practice is sometimes challenged by resource, policy or environmental constraints in the practice area,<ref name = "RCN"/> which can lead to moral distress.<ref name="Storch"/>
