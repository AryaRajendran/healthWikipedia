The '''basal forebrain''' is a collection of structures located rostrally and ventrally to the [[striatum]]. It is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). It includes a group of structures that lie near the bottom of the front of the brain, including the [[nucleus basalis]], [[diagonal band of Broca]], [[substantia innominata]], and medial [[septal nuclei]]. These structures are important in the production of [[acetylcholine]], which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. 

==Function==
Acetylcholine affects the ability of brain cells to transmit information to one another, and also encourages plasticity, or learning. Thus, damage to the basal forebrain can reduce the amount of acetylcholine in the brain and impair learning. This may be one reason why basal forebrain damage can result in memory impairments such as amnesia and confabulation. One common cause of basal forebrain damage is aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.<ref>[http://www.memorylossonline.com/glossary/basalforebrain.html Memory Loss & the Brain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Research, conducted by investigators from [[Children's Hospital Boston]] and the [[University of Helsinki]], ties together previous observations about sleep and finds that [[nitric oxide]] production in the basal forebrain is both necessary and sufficient to produce [[sleep]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060908094456.htm Need To Pull An All-nighter?

The name forebrain can be confusing because "fore" usually stands for "front", and in this case "forebrain" stands for the top of the brain.

This structure is defined, in part, as the place where [[adenosine]] acts on [[Adenosine A1 receptor|A1 receptors]] of [[cholinergic]] neurons.  This results in [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] of cholinergic neurons, which inhibits the release of [[acetylcholine]]. Acetylcholine is known to promote wakefulness in the basal forebrain. Inhibition of acetylcholine release in the basal forebrain by adenosine causes [[slow wave sleep]].

The basal forebrain and adjacent areas are a focus for sleep research. Stimulating the basal forebrain gives rise to Ach release, which induces wakefulness and REM sleep.
