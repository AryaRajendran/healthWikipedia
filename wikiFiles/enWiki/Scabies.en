'''Scabies''' (from {{lang-la|scabere}}, "to scratch"),<ref>Mosby’s Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book Inc., 1994, p. 1395</ref> also called '''Norwegian scabies''' or colloquially the '''seven-year itch''',<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Robert H.|title=Infectious disease secrets|year=2003|publisher=Elsevier, Hanley Belfus|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-56053-543-0|pages=355|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hYdw4vnanR0C&pg=PA355|edition=2.}}</ref> is a contagious [[skin infection]] caused by the [[mite]] ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''. The mite is a tiny and usually not directly visible [[parasitism|parasite]] which burrows under the host's skin, causing intense allergic itching. The infection in animals other than humans is caused by a different but related mite species, and is called [[sarcoptic mange]].
  
Scabies is classified by the [[World Health Organization]] as a water-related disease.<ref name=WHO>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/scabies/en/ |title=WHO -Water-related Disease |accessdate=2010-10-10 |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref> The disease may be transmitted from objects but is most often transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact, with a higher risk with prolonged contact. Initial infections require four to six weeks to become symptomatic. Reinfection, however, may manifest symptoms within as little as 24 hours. Because the symptoms are [[allergic]], their delay in onset is often mirrored by a significant delay in relief after the parasites have been eradicated. Crusted scabies, formerly known as Norwegian scabies, is a more severe form of the infection often associated with [[immunosuppression]].

== Signs and symptoms ==
The characteristic symptoms of a scabies infection include intense [[pruritus|itching]] and superficial burrows.<ref name=Ray2009 /> The burrow tracks are often linear, to the point that a neat "line" of four or more closely placed and equally developed mosquito-like "bites" is almost diagnostic of the disease.

===Itching===
In the classic scenario, the itch is made worse by warmth and is usually experienced as being worse at night, possibly because there are fewer distractions.<ref name=Ray2009 /> As a symptom, it is less common in the elderly.<ref name=Ray2009/>

===Rash===
The superficial burrows of scabies usually occur in the area of the hands, feet, wrists, elbows, back, buttocks, and external genitals.<ref name=Ray2009/> Except in infants and the immunosuppressed, infection generally does not occur in the skin of the face or scalp. The burrows are created by excavation of the adult mite in the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]].<ref name=Ray2009/>

In most people, the trails of the burrowing mites show as linear or ''s''-shaped tracks in the skin, often accompanied by what appear as rows of small pimple-like mosquito or insect bites. These signs are often found in crevices of the body, such as on the webs of fingers and toes, around the genital area, and under the breasts of women.<ref name=DermNet>{{cite web |url=http://www.dermnetnz.org/arthropods/pdf/scabies-dermnetnz.pdf |title=Scabies |work=DermNet NZ |publisher=New Zealand Dermatological Society Incorporated}}</ref>

Symptoms typically appear two to six weeks after infestation for individuals never before exposed to scabies. For those having been previously exposed, the symptoms can appear within several days after infestation. However, it is not unknown for symptoms to appear after several months or years.<ref name=Bouvresse-2010 /> [[Acropustulosis]], or blisters and pustules on the palms and soles of the feet, are characteristic symptoms of scabies in infants.<ref name="DermNet"/>

=== Crusted scabies ===
[[File:Norwegian Scabies in Homeless AIDS Patient.jpg|thumb|Crusted scabies in a person with AIDS]]

The elderly and people with an [[immunodeficiency|impaired immune system]], such as [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], [[cancer]], or those on [[immunosuppressive medications]], are susceptible to crusted scabies (formerly called Norwegian scabies).<ref name=Ray2009 /><ref name=Bouvresse-2010 /><ref name=pmid19580575>{{cite journal |author=Hicks MI, Elston DM |title=Scabies |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=279–92 |year=2009 |pmid=19580575 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2009.01243.x |url=}}</ref> On those with a weaker immune system, the host becomes a more fertile breeding ground for the mites, which spread over the host's body, except the face. Sufferers of crusted scabies exhibit scaly rashes, slight itching, and thick crusts of skin that contain thousands of mites.<ref name=CDC>{{cite web |url=http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Scabies.htm | title = DPDx—Scabies | work = Laboratory Identification of Parasites of Public Health Concern |publisher=CDC}}</ref> Such areas make eradication of mites particularly difficult, as the crusts protect the mites from topical miticides, necessitating prolonged treatment of these areas.

In the 18th century, Italian biologist [[Diacinto Cestoni]] (1637–1718) described the mite now called ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'', variety ''hominis'', as the [[etiology|cause of]] scabies. ''Sarcoptes'' is a genus of skin parasites and part of the larger family of mites collectively known as scab mites. These organisms have eight legs as adults, and are placed in the same phylogenetic class ([[Arachnida]]) as spiders and ticks.

''Sarcoptes scabiei'' are microscopic, but sometimes are visible as pinpoints of white. Pregnant females tunnel into the dead, outermost layer ([[stratum corneum]]) of a host's skin and deposit [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in the shallow burrows. The eggs hatch into [[larva]]e in three to ten days. These young mites move about on the skin and [[ecdysis|molt]] into a "[[nymph (biology)|nymphal]]" stage, before maturing as adults, which live three to four weeks in the host's skin. Males roam on top of the skin, occasionally burrowing into the skin. In general, there are usually few mites on a healthy hygienic person infested with non-crusted scabies; approximately eleven females in burrows can be found on such a person.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

The movement of mites within and on the skin produces an intense itch, which has the characteristics of a delayed cell-mediated inflammatory response to allergens. [[IgE]] antibodies are present in the serum and the site of infection, which react to multiple protein allergens in the body of the mite. Some of these cross-react to allergens from house-dust mites. Immediate antibody-mediated allergic reactions (wheals) have been elicited in infected persons, but not in healthy persons; immediate hypersensitivity of this type is thought to explain the observed far more rapid allergic skin response to reinfection seen in persons having been previously infected (especially having been infected within the previous year or two).<ref>Clinical Microbiology Reviews, April 2007, p. 268-279, Vol. 20, No. 2 0893-8512/07/$08.00+0 {{doi|10.1128/CMR.00042-06}} ''Problems in Diagnosing Scabies, a Global Disease in Human and Animal Populations'' [http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/20/2/268?view=long online reference] PMID 17428886</ref> Because the host develops the symptoms as a reaction to the mites' presence over time, there is usually a four– to six-week incubation period after the onset of infestation. As noted, those previously infected with scabies and cured may exhibit the symptoms of a new infection in a much shorter period, as little as one to four days.<ref name=Markell9 />

Scabies is contagious and can be spread by scratching an infected area, thereby picking up the mites under the fingernails, or through physical contact with a scabies-infected person for a prolonged period of time.<ref name=ssd3>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Skin and Skin Disorders |author=Carol Turkington and Jeffrey S. Dover, M.D. |isbn=978-0-8160-6403-8 |year=2006 |publisher=Facts on File inc |location=New York}}</ref> Scabies is usually transmitted by direct skin-to-skin physical contact. It can also be spread through contact with other objects, such as clothing, bedding, furniture, or surfaces with which a person infected with scabies might have come in contact.<ref name=webmd>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/scabies/page2_em.htm#Scabies Causes |title=Scabies Causes |accessdate=2010-10-09 |publisher=WebMD |year=2010 |month=October}}</ref> Scabies mites can survive without a human host for 24 to 36&nbsp;hours.<ref name=chos>{{cite journal |author=Chosidow O |title=Clinical practices.

==Pathophysiology==
The symptoms are caused by an [[allergic reaction]] of the host's body to mite proteins, though exactly which proteins remains a topic of study. The mite proteins are also present from the gut, in mite feces, which are deposited under the skin. The allergic reaction is both of the delayed (cell-mediated) and immediate (antibody-mediated) type, and involves [[IgE]] (antibodies, it is presumed, mediate the very rapid symptoms on re-infection).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal | url = http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/20/2/268?view=long | pmid = 17428886| doi=10.1128/CMR.00042-06 | volume=20 | issue=2 | year=2007 | month=April | pages=268–79 | title = Problems in Diagnosing Scabies, a Global Disease in Human and Animal Populations | last1 = Walton | first1 = SF | last2 = Currie | first2 = BJ | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | pmc = 1865595}}</ref> The allergy-type symptoms (itching) continue for some days, and even several weeks, after all mites are killed. New lesions may appear for a few days after mites are eradicated. Nodular lesions from scabies may continue to be symptomatic for weeks after the mites have been killed.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Scabies-burrow.jpg|thumb|Magnified view of a burrowing trail of the scabies mite. The scaly patch on the left was caused by the scratching and marks the mite's entry point into the skin. The mite has burrowed to the top-right, where it can be seen as a dark spot at the end.]]

Scabies may be diagnosed clinically in geographical areas where it is common when diffuse [[itching]] presents along with either lesions in two typical spots or there is itchiness of another household member.<ref name=Clinic2009 /> The classical sign of scabies is the burrows made by the mites within the skin.<ref name=Clinic2009 /> To detect the burrow, the suspected area is rubbed with ink from a fountain pen or a topical tetracycline solution, which glows under a special light. The skin is then wiped with an alcohol pad. If the person is infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or ''S'' pattern of the burrow will appear across the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by scratch marks.<ref name=Clinic2009 /> A definitive diagnosis is made by finding either the scabies mites or their eggs and fecal pellets.<ref name="Clinic2009" /> Searches for these signs involve either scraping a suspected area, mounting the sample in [[potassium hydroxide]], and examining it under a microscope, or using [[dermoscopy]] to examine the skin directly.<ref name=Ray2009 />

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Symptoms of early scabies infestation mirror other skin diseases, including [[dermatitis]], [[syphilis]], various [[urticaria]]-related syndromes, allergic reactions, and other [[ectoparasites]] such as [[lice]] and [[fleas]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arlian LG |title=Biology, host relations, and epidemiology of Sarcoptes scabiei |journal=Annu.

== Prevention ==
Mass treatment programs that use topical [[permethrin]] or oral [[ivermectin]] have been effective in reducing the prevalence of scabies in a number of populations.<ref name=Clinic2009 /> There is no vaccine available for scabies. The simultaneous treatment of all close contacts is recommended, even if they show no symptoms of infection ([[asymptomatic]]), to reduce rates of recurrence.<ref name=Clinic2009 /> Asymptomatic infection is relatively common.<ref name=Clinic2009 /> Since mites can only survive for two to three days without a host, [[Fomite|objects in the environment]] pose little risk of transmission except in the case of crusted scabies, thus cleaning is of little importance.<ref name=Clinic2009 /> Rooms used by those with crusted scabies require thorough cleaning.<ref name=CDCprevent>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/scabies/prevent.html |title=CDC—Prevention and Control—Scabies |accessdate=2010-10-09 |publisher=Center for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref>

== Management ==
A number of medications are effective in treating scabies; however, treatment must often involve the entire household or community to prevent re-infection.<ref name=Clinic2009 /> Options to improve itchiness include [[antihistamine]]s.<ref>{{doi|10.3949/ccjm.75.7.474}} Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine July 2008 vol. 75 7 474–478 [http://ccjm.org/content/75/7/474.full online link]</ref>

== History ==
Scabies is an ancient disease. Archeological evidence from Egypt and the Middle East suggests that scabies was present as early as 494&nbsp;BC.<ref name=Markell9>{{cite book |author=Markell, Edward K.; John, David C.; Petri, William H. |title=Markell and Voge's medical parasitology |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2006 |isbn=0-7216-4793-6 |edition=9th}}</ref><ref name="stanford">{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/parasites/ParaSites2005/Scabies/SCABIES.html |title=SCABIES HOMEPAGE |accessdate=2010-10-09 |publisher=Stanford University}}</ref> The first recorded reference to scabies is believed to be from the [[Bible]] ([[Leviticus]], the third book of Moses) ca. 1200&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Leviticus|13:29-13:37|NIV}}</ref> Later, in the fourth century BC, the ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] reported on "lice" that "escape from little pimples if they are pricked";<ref name="Roncalli">{{cite journal |author=Roncalli RA |title=The history of scabies in veterinary and human medicine from biblical to modern times |journal=Vet.

Nevertheless, it was Greek physician [[Celsus]] who is credited with naming the disease "scabies" and describing its characteristic features.<ref name=Roncalli /> The parasitic etiology of scabies was later documented by the Italian physician Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo (1663–99&nbsp;AD) in his famous 1687 letter, "Observations concerning the fleshworms of the human body".<ref name=Roncalli /> With this discovery, scabies became one of the first diseases with a known cause.<ref name=Markell9 /><ref name=stanford />
