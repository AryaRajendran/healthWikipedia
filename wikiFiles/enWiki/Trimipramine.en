'''Trimipramine''' ('''Surmontil''', '''Rhotrimine''', '''Stangyl''') is a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA). It has [[antidepressant]], [[anxiolytic]], [[antipsychotic]], [[sedative]], and [[analgesic]] effects.

== Indications ==

* Endogenous and neurotic depression with prominent agitation and anxiety
* Depressive and non-depressive insomnia (suitable for long-term treatment)
* Adjunctive therapy of alcohol and opioid withdrawal
* Chronic pain of malignant and non-malignant origin

== Pharmacology ==
Trimipramine is chemically similar to other TCA antidepressants such as [[imipramine]] as well as the antipsychotic [[levomepromazine]] ([[Nozinan]]).

Trimipramine's [[mechanism of action]] differs from other TCAs. It is only a moderate [[reuptake inhibitor]] of [[norepinephrine]], and a weak reuptake inhibitor of [[serotonin]] and [[dopamine]]. Its main effects are due to considerable [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonism]] as follows:

* Extremely strong: [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]]
* Strong: [[5-HT2|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]], [[muscarinic acetylcholine|mACh]], [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]]
* Moderate: [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]]
* Weak: [[5-HT1|5-HT<sub>1</sub>]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic]]

The spectrum of effects (strong antidepressant activity, sedation and anxiolysis) and side effects (strong [[anticholinergic]] and [[antiadrenergic]] symptoms) is similar to those of [[doxepin]]. It is also a more effective sedative than [[amitriptyline]]. Trimipramine is the only effective drug against insomnia known so far that does not alter the normal sleep architecture.(There is evidence in medical journals that refute this last statement.)In particular, it does not suppress [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]], and dreams are said to brighten during treatment.<ref>Michael Schredla, Mathias Bergerb, Dieter Riemannb: ''The effect of trimipramine on dream recall and dream emotions in depressive outpatients''; in: Psychiatry Research, Volume 167, Issue 3, Pages 279-286 (30 May 2009)</ref> However, this can occasionally go too far, as [[nightmares]] are an uncommon but possible side effect of the drug. Its relatively strong antagonistic activity at postsynaptic D<sub>2</sub> receptors led to a clinical study trying trimipramine as atypical [[neuroleptic]]. There it exerted good antipsychotic activity with a low incidence of [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] and other side effects. But this study encompassed only 28 patients, so the use of trimipramine as a [[neuroleptic]] needs further confirmation and can currently not be recommended. Trimipramine also shows useful activity against chronic pain.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
=== Forms ===

* Tablets/capsules (10, 12.5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150&nbsp;mg)
* Liquid concentrate (40&nbsp;mg/ml)
* Injectable concentrate (25&nbsp;mg)

=== Dosage ===

Whilst some standard suggested dosages are published for the treatment of depression, the proper dosage for treatment of insomnia in non-depressive patients, those on alcohol/opioid withdrawal and those with chronic pain may vary greatly and should be discussed with your physician.

Treatment should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose and increased gradually, noting carefully the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Days to weeks may elapse before optimal therapeutic effects of Trimipramine are seen. Increasing the dosage usually does not shorten this latent period and may increase the incidence of side effects and patient non-compliance. 

In elderly or debilitated patients it may be necessary to check blood pressure and cardiac rhythm, particularly in patients who have unstable cardiovascular function. 

Once a satisfactory response has been obtained, the dosage is normally adjusted to the lowest level required to maintain remission and avoid relapse. Medication should be continued for the expected duration of the depressive episode in order to minimize the possibility of relapse following clinical improvement. Afterwards, prophylactic treatment for 1 to 2 years may be indicated, but there are different opinions regarding the optimal dose and length of remission maintenance treatment.

=== Parenteral usage ===

Intramuscular injections and slow i.v.-infusions are possible, but have the disadvantage of intensified anticholinergic and antiadrenergic side effects. The advantage may be an earlier onset of action compared to oral dosage. Decreased doses are sufficient with parenteral treatment.

=== Metabolism ===

Trimipramine is a [[racemic]] compound with two [[enantiomer]]s.{{ref|enantiomer}} CYP2C19 is responsible for the [[demethylation]] of (D)- and (L)-trimipramine to (D)- (L)-desmethyltrimipramine, respectively, and [[CYP2D6]] is responsible for the 2-[[hydroxylation]] of ([[dextrorotation|D]])- and ([[levorotation|L]])-desmethyltrimipramine to (D)- and (L)-2-hydroxydesmethyltrimipramine, respectively.<ref name="pmid10774635">{{cite journal |author=Eap CB, Bender S, Gastpar M, ''et al.'' |title=Steady state plasma levels of the enantiomers of trimipramine and of its metabolites in CYP2D6-, CYP2C19- and CYP3A4/5-phenotyped patients |journal=Ther Drug Monit |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=209–14 |year=2000 |pmid=10774635 |doi= 10.1097/00007691-200004000-00012|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0163-4356&volume=22&issue=2&spage=209}}</ref> CYP2D6 also metabolizes (L)-trimipramine into (L)-2-hydroxytrimipramine.<ref name="pmid10774635"/>

== Contraindications ==

Absolute:

* Concomitant treatment with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs)
* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to trimipramine or other TCAs
* Acute delirum tremens
* Untreated closed angle glaucoma
* [[Hypertrophy]] of the prostate '''with''' urine retention
* Paralytic ileus

Relative:

* [[Hypertrophy]] of the prostate '''without''' urine retention
* Reduced function of the bone marrow
* Organic brain disorders
* Increased risk of seizures, pre-existing epilepsy
* Pre-existing cardial damage, particular some arrhythmias (impulse conductive disorders)

==Abuse & dependence==
Trimipramine is not an abusable substance nor does it cause psychological dependence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Withdrawal symptoms frequently seen when treatment with trimipramine is stopped abruptly (agitation, anxiety, insomnia, sometimes activation of mania or rebound depression) are not indicative of addiction and can be avoided by reducing the daily dose of trimipramine gradually by approximately 25% each week; if withdrawal symptoms occur at this rate smaller reductions with larger gaps in-between can be made to ease or prevent unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== Formation ==
Trimipramine is synthesised by treatment of 10,11,Dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine and with 3-''N'',''N''-Dimethylamino-2-methylpropylchloride in a nucleophilic substition in present of [[Sodium amide]].<ref name="Kleemann">[[Axel Kleemann|A.

== History == 
Trimipramine maleate (as Surmontil) oral capsules were first approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] prior to January 1, 1982 in 25mg and 50mg formulations, with the 100mg formulation having been approved on September 15, 1982. A generic version of all three formulations was given FDA approval on August 2, 2006. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-surmontil.html|title= Generic Surmontil Availability
