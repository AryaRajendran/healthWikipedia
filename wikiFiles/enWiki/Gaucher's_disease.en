'''Gaucher's disease''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɡ|oʊ|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ|z}}) is a genetic disease in which a fatty substance (lipid) accumulates in cells and certain organs.
Gaucher's  disease is the most common of the [[lysosomal storage disease]]s.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|536}} It is a form of [[sphingolipidosis]] (a subgroup of lysosomal storage diseases), as it involves dysfunctional metabolism of [[sphingolipids]]. The disorder is characterized by bruising, fatigue, anemia, low blood platelets, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. It is caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme [[glucocerebrosidase]]. The enzyme acts on the fatty acid glucosylceramide. When the enzyme is defective, glucosylceramide accumulates, particularly in white blood cells, most often macrophages ([[mononuclear leukocytes]]). Glucosylceramide can collect in the [[spleen]], liver, [[kidney]]s, [[Human lung|lung]]s, [[Human brain|brain]] and bone marrow.

Symptoms may include enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction, [[List of skeletal disorders|skeletal disorders]] and bone lesions that may be painful, severe [[Neurology|neurologic]] complications, swelling of [[lymph node]]s and (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a brownish tint to the skin, [[anemia]], low blood [[platelet]]s and yellow fatty deposits on the white of the eye ([[sclera]]). Persons affected most seriously may also be more susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher's disease may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.

The disease is caused by a [[dominance (genetics)|recessive mutation]] in a gene located on [[chromosome 1 (human)|chromosome 1]] and affects both males and females. About 1 in 100 people in the United States are [[genetic carrier|carrier]]s of the most common type of Gaucher disease. The carrier rate among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] is 8.9% while the birth incidence is 1 in 450.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zimran A, Gelbart T, Westwood B, Grabowski GA, Beutler E |title=High frequency of the Gaucher disease mutation at nucleotide 1226 among Ashkenazi Jews|journal= Am. J. Hum. Genet.|volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=855–859 |year=1991 |pmid=1897529 |pmc=1683177 }}</ref>

The disease is [[eponym|named after]] the French doctor [[Philippe Gaucher]], who originally described it in 1882.<ref name=Gaucher1882/>

==Classification==
Gaucher's disease has three common clinical subtypes.
* Type I (or non-neuropathic type) is the most common form of the disease, occurring in approximately 1 in 50,000 live births. It occurs most often among persons of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] heritage. Symptoms may begin early in life or in adulthood and include [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] and grossly [[splenomegaly|enlarged spleen]] (together [[hepatosplenomegaly]]); the spleen can rupture and cause additional complications. Skeletal weakness and bone disease may be extensive. Spleen enlargement and bone marrow replacement cause anemia, thrombocytopenia and [[leukopenia]]. The brain is not affected pathologically, but there may be lung and, rarely, kidney impairment. Patients in this group usually [[bruise]] easily (due to low levels of platelets) and experience fatigue due to low numbers of red blood cells. Depending on disease onset and severity, type 1 patients may live well into adulthood. Many patients have a mild form of the disease or may not show any symptoms.

* Type II (or acute infantile neuropathic Gaucher's disease) typically begins within 6 months of birth and has an incidence rate of approximately 1 in 100,000 live births. Symptoms include an enlarged liver and spleen, extensive and progressive brain damage, eye movement disorders, [[spasticity]], [[seizure]]s, limb rigidity, and a poor ability to suck and swallow. Affected children usually die by age 2.

* Type III (the chronic neuropathic form) can begin at any time in childhood or even in adulthood, and occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 live births. It is characterized by slowly progressive but milder neurologic symptoms compared to the acute or type 2 version. Major symptoms include an enlarged spleen and/or liver, seizures, poor coordination, skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, blood disorders including anemia and respiratory problems. Patients often live into their early teen years and adulthood.

These subtypes have come under some criticism for not taking account of the full spectrum of observable symptoms (the [[phenotypes]].<ref>[http://www.gaucher.org.uk/consenmarch2002.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>) There are also compound heterozygous variations which considerably increase the complexity of predicting disease course.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Painless [[hepatomegaly]] and [[splenomegaly]]: the size of the spleen can be 1500-3000 ml, as opposed to the normal size of 50-200 ml. Splenomegaly may decrease the affected individual's capacity for eating by exerting pressure on the stomach. While painless, enlargement of spleen increases the risk of splenic rupture.
* [[Hypersplenism]] and [[pancytopenia]]: the rapid and premature destruction of blood cells, leading to [[anemia]], [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], and [[thrombocytopenia]] (with an increased risk of [[infection]] and [[bleeding]]).
* [[Cirrhosis]] of the liver is rare
* Severe pain associated with joints and bones, frequently presenting in hips and knees.
* [[Neurology|Neurological]] symptoms occur only in some types of Gaucher's (see below):
** Type II: serious convulsions, hypertonia, mental retardation, apnea.
** Type III: muscle twitches known as [[myoclonus]], convulsions, dementia, ocular muscle apraxia.
* [[Osteoporosis]]: 75% develop visible bony abnormalities due to the accumulated glucosylceramide. A deformity of the distal [[femur]] in the shape of an [[Erlenmeyer flask]]  is commonly described (aseptic necrosis of the femur joint).
* Yellowish-brown skin [[pigmentation]]

==Pathophysiology==
The disease is caused by a defect in  [[housekeeping gene]] ''[[glucocerebrosidase|lysosomal glucocerebrosidase]]'' (also known as beta-glucosidase, {{EC number|3.2.1.45}}, {{PDB|1OGS}}) on the first [[chromosome]] (1q21). The [[enzyme]] is a 55.6 [[kilodalton|KD]], 497 [[amino acid]]s long protein that catalyses the breakdown of [[glucosylceramide]], a [[cell membrane]] constituent of [[red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cell]]s. The [[macrophage]]s that clear these cells are unable to eliminate the waste product, which accumulates in fibrils, and turn into ''Gaucher cells'', which appear on [[light microscopy]] to resemble crumpled-up paper.

In the brain (type II and III), glucosylceramidase accumulates due to the turnover of complex [[lipid]]s during brain development and the formation of the [[myelin sheath]] of nerves.

Different mutations in the beta-glucosidase determine the remaining activity of the enzyme, and, to a large extent, the [[phenotype]].

[[Heterozygote]]s for particular acid beta-glucosidase mutations carry about a fivefold risk of developing [[Parkinson's disease]], making this the most common known genetic risk-factor for Parkinson's.<ref>{{cite journal |title=ASHG 2008: Gaucher Disease Mutation Carriers at Higher Risk for Parkinson's Disease|author=Jacquelyn K Beals|work=Medscape Medical News|year=November 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Aharon-Peretz J, Rosenbaum H, Gershoni-Baruch R |title=Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene and Parkinson's disease in Ashkenazi Jews |journal=N.

==Genetics==
The three types of Gaucher's disease are inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] fashion. Both parents must be carriers in order for a child to be affected. If both parents are carriers, there is a one in four, or 25%, chance with each pregnancy for an affected child. [[Genetic counseling]] and [[genetic testing]] is recommended for families who may be carriers of mutations.

Each type has been linked to particular mutations. In all, there are about 80 known mutations, grouped into three main types:<ref>{{OMIM|606463}}</ref>
* Type I (N370S [[homozygote]]), the most common, also called the "non-neuropathic" type occurs mainly in [[Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi Jews]], at 100 times the occurrence in the general populace. The median age at diagnosis is 28 years of age,<ref name="Grabowski2008">{{cite journal|journal=Lancet|year=2008|volume=372|pages=1263–1271
|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61522-6|title=Phenotype, diagnosis, and treatment of Gaucher's disease|author=Grabowski GA|issue=9645|pmid=19094956}}</ref> and life expectancy is mildly decreased.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weinreb NJ, Deegan P, Kacena KA, ''et al.'' |title=Life expectancy in Gaucher disease type 1 |journal=Am. J. Hematol. |volume=83 |issue=12 |pages=896–900 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18980271 |doi=10.1002/ajh.21305 |url=}}</ref> There are no neurological symptoms.
* Type II (1 or 2 [[allele]]s L444P) is characterized by neurological problems in small children. The enzyme is hardly released into the [[lysosome]]s. Prognosis is poor: most die before the age of 3.
* Type III (also 1-2 copies of L444P, possibly delayed by protective polymorphisms) occurs in [[Sweden|Swedish]] patients from the [[Norrbotten]] region. This group develops the disease somewhat later, but most die before their 30th birthday.

Diaz  ''et al.'' suggest that the Gaucher-causing mutations entered the Ashkenazi Jewish gene pool in the early Middle Ages (48-55 generations ago).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Diaz GA, Gelb BD, Risch N, ''et al.'' |title=Gaucher disease: the origins of the Ashkenazi Jewish N370S and 84GG acid beta-glucosidase mutations |journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1821–32 |year=2000 |pmid=10777718|doi=10.1086/302946 |pmc=1378046}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Gaucher disease - very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing crinkled paper macrophages in the marrow space in a case of Gaucher disease. [[H&E stain]].]]
A definitive diagnosis is made with [[genetic test]]ing.  As there are numerous different mutations, sequencing of the beta-glucosidase gene is sometimes necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis is available, and is useful when there is a known genetic risk factor.

A diagnosis can also be implied by biochemical abnormalities such as high [[alkaline phosphatase]], [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) and [[immunoglobulin]] levels, or by cell analysis showing "crinkled paper" cytoplasm and glycolipid-laden macrophages.

Some lysosomal enzymes are elevated, including tartrate-resistant [[acid phosphatase]], hexosaminidase, and a human chitinase, chitotriosidase. This latter enzyme has proved to be very useful for monitoring Gaucher's disease activity in response to treatment, and may reflect the severity of the disease

==Treatment==
For type 1 and most type 3 patients, [[enzyme replacement treatment]] with [[intravenous]] [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] glucocerebrosidase ([[imiglucerase]]) can dramatically decrease [[liver]] and spleen size, reduce skeletal abnormalities, and reverse other manifestations. This treatment costs approximately US$200,000 annually for a single patient and should be continued for life. The rarity of the disease means that dose-finding studies have been difficult to conduct, so there remains controversy over the optimal dose and dosing frequency.<ref name="Grabowski2008"/>  Due to the low incidence, this has become an [[orphan drug]] in many countries, meaning that a government recognizes and accommodates the financial constraints that limit research into drugs that address a small population. [[Velaglucerase alfa]] was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as an alternative treatment in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180630.php |title=Shire Announces FDA Approval Of VPRIV(TM) (velaglucerase Alfa For Injection) For The Treatment Of Type 1 Gaucher Disease |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> In May 2012 the FDA approved an additional treatment – [[Taliglucerase alfa]], or ''Elelyso''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Yukhananov|first=Anna|title=U.S. FDA approves Pfizer/Protalix drug for Gaucher|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/sns-rt-us-fda-gaucherbre8401jz-20120501,0,5155428.story|accessdate=2 May 2012|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1 May 2012|agency=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

Successful [[bone marrow transplantation]] cures the non-neurological manifestations of the disease, because it introduces a [[monocyte]] population with active beta-glucosidase. However, this procedure carries significant risk and is rarely performed in Gaucher patients. Surgery to remove the spleen ([[splenectomy]]) may be required on rare occasions if the patient is anemic or when the enlarged organ affects the patient’s comfort. [[Blood transfusion]] may benefit some anemic patients. Other patients may require [[Replacement joint|joint replacement]] surgery to improve mobility and quality of life. Other treatment options include [[antibiotic]]s for infections, [[antiepileptic]]s for seizures, [[bisphosphonate]]s for bone lesions, and [[liver transplant]]s. Substrate reduction therapy may prove to be effective in stopping Type 2, as it can cross through the blood barrier into the brain. There is currently no effective treatment for the severe brain damage that may occur in patients with types 2 and 3 Gaucher disease. [[Gene therapy]] may be a future step.

Gaucher's disease has recently become a target for more than one effort at [[pharmacological chaperone|pharmacological chaperoning]], which involves the use of orally administered drugs that operate at a molecular level. [[Miglustat]] is one of these oral drugs. It was approved for the treatment of this disease in 2003. {{As of|June 2009}}, another oral drug, [[isofagomine tartrate]], is under development.

==Epidemiology==
The National Gaucher Foundation (United States) states that the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of Gaucher's disease is about 1 in 20,000 live births.<ref>[http://www.gaucherdisease.org/what_is.php Gaucher Disease] at National Gaucher Foundation. Retrieved June 2012</ref> Around 1 in 100 people in the general U.S. population is a carrier for type 1 Gaucher's disease, giving a prevalence of 1 in 40,000.<ref name=ngf-prevalence/> Among [[Ashkenazi Jew]]s the rate of carriers is considerably higher, at roughly 1 in 15.<ref name=ngf-prevalence>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaucherdisease.org/prevalence.php |title=National Gaucher Foundation |accessdate=2007-05-30 |work=}}</ref>

Type 2 Gaucher's disease shows no particular preference for any ethnic group.

Type 3 Gaucher's disease is especially common in the population of the Northern Swedish region of [[Norrbotten]] where the incidence of the disease is 1 in 50,000.

==History==
The disease was first recognised by the French doctor [[Philippe Gaucher]], who originally described it in 1882 and lent his name to the condition.<ref name=Gaucher1882>{{cite book | author=Gaucher PCE | title=De l'epithelioma primitif de la rate, hypertrophie idiopathique de la rate sans leucemie [academic thesis] | location=Paris, France | year=1882}}</ref> The biochemical basis for the disease was elucidated in 1965.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brady RO, Kanfer JN, Shapiro D |title=Metabolism of glucosylceramidase.

An improved drug, [[imiglucerase]] (Cerezyme), was approved by the FDA in May 1994 and has replaced the use of Ceredase.

October marks National Gaucher's Disease Awareness Month in the United States.
