'''Levels of evidence''' is a [[ranking system]] used in [[evidence-based practice]]s to describe the strength of the results measured in a [[clinical trial]] or research study. The design of the study (such as a [[case report]] for an individual patient or a  [[double-blinded]] [[randomized controlled trial]]) and the endpoints measured (such as [[wiktionary:survival|survival]] or [[quality of life]]) affect the strength of the [[evidence]]. Levels of evidence range from I-IV.

*Ia - Evidence from Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
*Ib - Evidence from at least one Randomized Controlled Trials
*IIa - Evidence from at least one well designed controlled trial which is not randomized
*IIb - Evidence from at least one well designed experimental trial
*III - Evidence from case, correlation, and comparative studies.
*IV - Evidence from a panel of experts
