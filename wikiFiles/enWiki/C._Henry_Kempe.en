Dr. '''C. Henry Kempe''' (birth name '''Karl Heinz Kempe''', b. 1922, [[Breslau, Germany]] (now  Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) - d. 1984, [[Hanauma Bay|Hanauma Bay, Hawaii]]) was a [[pediatrician]] and the first in the medical community to identify and recognize [[child abuse]].

In 1962, Dr. Kempe and Dr. Brandt F. Steele published the paper, "The Battered Child Syndrome."<ref>C. Henry Kempe and Ray E. Helfer, editors: ''The Battered Child''. 1st edition, 1968. 2nd edition, Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1974. 3rd edition, 1980. 5th edition by M. E. Helfer, R. Kempe, and R. Krugman, 1997.</ref><ref>C. H. Kempe, Frederic N. Silverman, Brandt F. Steele, William Droegemuller, Henry K. Silver: "The Battered Child Syndrome." ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 1962, 181: 17-24. Tardieu's syndrome. Also called Caffey-Kempe syndrome.</ref>  Publishing this paper led to the identification and recognition of [[child abuse]] by the medical community.

Dr. Kempe received two nominations for the [[Nobel Prize]]. The first nomination was for his work in developing a safer [[smallpox vaccine]].  The second nomination was recognition for his contribution to the prevention and treatment of child abuse. Due to the efforts of Dr. Kempe, abuse reporting laws exist in all 50 states. His efforts also led to the passage of the 1972 Colorado law requiring legal counsel for the child in all cases of suspected abuse.<ref name="goodknight">''A Good Knight for Children: C. Henry Kempe's Quest to Protect The Abused Child'' by Annie Kempe. Booklocker.com, Inc. 2007.</ref>

==Early life==
Born into a Jewish family in Germany during the rise of the Nazi party, Dr. Kempe fled Germany as a teenager and came to the United States of America.  He learned a new language, completed high school and college, and eventually became a physician.  Specializing in the study of [[virology]], he helped eradicate [[smallpox]] through the development of a safer vaccine.

Dr. Kempe became the youngest chairman of the pediatrics department at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. During his tenure, he began to recognize the prevalence of non-accidental injuries to children.  He demanded a better diagnostic investigation of the unexplained and life-threatening injuries observed in children at four different hospital emergency rooms: shattered bones, inflicted burns, and brain damage.

His research led to the publication of "The Battered Child Syndrome."<ref name="goodknight" />
