'''Coccydynia''' is a medical term meaning [[pain]] in the [[coccyx]] or tailbone area, usually brought on by sitting too abruptly.

==Synonyms==
Coccydynia is also known as coccygodynia, coccygeal pain, coccyx pain, or coccalgia.

==Diagnosis==
A number of different conditions can cause pain in the general area of the coccyx, but not all involve the coccyx and the muscles attached to it. The first task of diagnosis is to determine whether the pain is related to the coccyx. Physical examination, high resolution x-rays and MRI scans can rule out various causes unrelated to the coccyx, such as [[Tarlov cyst]]s and pain referred from higher up the spine. Note that, contrary to most anatomical textbooks, most coccyxes consist of several segments: 'fractured coccyx' is often diagnosed when the coccyx is in fact normal or just dislocated at an intercoccygeal joint.<ref name=Postachini>{{cite journal |author=Postacchini F, Massobrio M |title=Idiopathic coccygodynia. Analysis of fifty-one operative cases and a radiographic study of the normal coccyx |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1116–24 |year=1983 |month=October |pmid=6226668 }}</ref><ref name=KimSuk>{{cite journal|url=http://www.coccyx.org/medabs/kimsuk.htm |title=Clinical and radiological differences between traumatic and idiopathic coccygodynia.|publisher=[[Yonsei Medical Journal]] |date=June 1999 |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=215–20 |author=Kim NH, Suk KS}}</ref> 

A simple test to determine whether the coccyx is involved is injection of local anesthetic into the area. If the pain relates to the coccyx, this should produce immediate relief.<ref name=Marx>{{cite journal |author=Marx, Fred A. |title=Coccydynia/Levator Syndrome, A Therapeutic Test |journal=Techniques in Coloproctology |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=1996 |url=http://www.coccyx.org/medabs/marx.htm}}</ref>

If the anesthetic test proves positive, then a dynamic (sit/stand) x-ray or MRI scan may show whether the coccyx dislocates when the patient sits.<ref name=Maigne>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00007632-200012010-00015 |author=Maigne JY, Doursounian L, Chatellier G |title=Causes and mechanisms of common coccydynia: role of body mass index and coccygeal trauma |journal=Spine |volume=25 |issue=23 |pages=3072–9 |year=2000 |month=December |pmid=11145819 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0362-2436&volume=25&issue=23&spage=3072}}</ref>

Use of dynamic x-rays on 208 patients who gave positive results with the anesthetic test showed:

*22% Posterior luxation (partial dislocation of the coccyx backwards when sitting)
*5%  Anterior luxation (partial dislocation of the coccyx forwards when sitting)
*27%  Hypermobility (excessive flexing of the coccyx forwards and upwards when sitting)
*14% Spicule (bony spur) on the coccyx
*31% Not possible to identify the cause of pain

This study found that the pattern of lesions was different depending on the obesity of the patients: obese patients were most likely to have posterior luxation of the coccyx, while thin patients were most likely to have coccygeal [[spicules]].

==Causes==
One way of classifying coccydynia is whether the onset was traumatic versus non-traumatic. In many cases the exact cause is not known (called idiopathic coccydynia).

Coccydynia is often reported following a fall or after [[childbirth]]. In some cases, persistent pressure from activities like bicycling may cause the onset of coccyx pain.<ref name=Foye06>{{cite journal | author = Foye P, Buttaci C, Stitik T, Yonclas P | title = Successful injection for coccyx pain | journal = Am J Phys Med Rehabil | volume = 85 | issue = 9 | pages = 783–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16924191 | doi = 10.1097/01.phm.0000233174.86070.63}}</ref>  Coccydynia due to these causes usually is not permanent, but it may become very persistent and chronic if not controlled.

Also, coccydynia can be caused by sitting improperly, straining the coccyx. 

Rarely, coccydynia is due to the undiagnosed presence of a [[sacrococcygeal teratoma]] or other [[tumor]] in the vicinity of the coccyx.  In these cases, appropriate treatment usually involves surgery and/or [[chemotherapy]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for this and previous sentence|date=December 2011}}

==Clinical features==
Activities that put pressure on the affected area are bicycling, horseback riding, and other activities such as increased sitting that put direct stress on the coccyx. The medical condition is often characterized by pain that worsens with constipation and may be relieved with bowel movement. Rarely, even sexual intercourse can aggravate symptoms.

==Non-surgical treatment==
Since sitting on the affected area may aggravate the condition, a cushion with a cutout at the back under the coccyx is recommended. If there is tailbone pain with bowel movements, then stool softeners and increased fiber in the diet may help. For prolonged cases, [[anti-inflammatory]] or pain-relieving drugs may be prescribed. The use of anti-depressants such as Elavil ([[amitriptyline]]) may help alleviate constant pain. Local nerve blocks are often beneficial.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Tailbone pain physicians specializing in [[Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]] at [[New Jersey Medical School]] have published that sometimes even just a single local nerve block injection at the ganglion impar can give 100% relief of coccydynia when performed under fluoroscopic guidance.<ref name=Foye06/>

Additionally if the pain is caused by a malignment of the coccyx, manipulation by a [[chiropractor]], [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physician]] ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) or [[physical therapist]] can offer relief.<ref>Comparison of Three Manual Coccydynia Treatments: A Pilot Study Spine 2001 Volume 26, number 20, pages E479-E484 JeanYves Maigne, MD,* and Gilles Chatellier, MD</ref>

==Surgical treatment==
In rare cases, surgery to remove the coccyx ([[coccygectomy]]) may be required. Typically, surgery is reserved for patients with cancer (malignancy) or those whose tailbone pain has failed to respond to nonsurgical treatment (such as medications by mouth, use of seat cushions, and medications given by local injections done under fluoroscopic guidance, as noted above).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Foye PM | title = Reasons to delay or avoid coccygectomy for coccyx pain | journal = Injury | volume = 38 | issue = 11 | pages = 1328 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17884057 | doi =10.1016/j.injury.2007.06.022 }}</ref>
