'''Southern tick-associated rash illness''' ('''STARI''') or '''Masters' disease''' is an [[emerging infectious disease]] related to [[Lyme disease]] that occurs in southeastern and south-central United States. It is spread by tick bites, but the organism that causes the infection is unknown.

==Causes==
This illness is a [[tick-borne disease]] carried by the Lone Star Tick ''[[Amblyomma americanum]]''. This tick was first proposed as a possible [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of disease in 1984,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schulze TL |title=Amblyomma americanum: a potential vector of Lyme disease in New Jersey |journal=Science |volume=224 |issue=4649 |pages=601–3 |year=1984 |month=May |pmid=6710158 |author-separator=, |author2=Bowen GS |author3=Bosler EM |display-authors=3 |last4=Lakat |first4=MF |last5=Parkin |first5=WE |last6=Altman |first6=R |last7=Ormiston |first7=BG |last8=Shisler |first8=JK |doi=10.1126/science.6710158}}</ref> and the illnesses associated with the tick called "Lyme-like disease",<ref>{{cite journal |author=Masters EJ, Donnell HD |title=Lyme and/or Lyme-like disease in Missouri |journal=Mo Med |volume=92 |issue=7 |pages=346–53 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7651314}}</ref> but it was not until the late 1990s that it was recognized that this was distinct from Lyme disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Masters E, Granter S, Duray P, Cordes P |title=Physician-diagnosed erythema migrans and erythema migrans-like rashes following Lone Star tick bites |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=134 |issue=8 |pages=955–60 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9722725 |doi=10.1001/archderm.134.8.955}}</ref><ref name=Kirkland/> 

Several studies have failed to detect ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', which is the causative agent of Lyme disease, in patients from the southern United States.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Philipp MT, Masters E, Wormser GP, Hogrefe W, Martin D |title=Serologic Evaluation of Patients from Missouri with Erythema Migrans-Like Skin Lesions with the C6 Lyme Test |journal=Clin.

The [[Centers for Disease Control]] is conducting a study to attempt to culture the bacteria responsible for causing Southern Tick Associated Rash Illness and is requesting participants for the study.  In addition, individuals can submit ticks that cause a STARI like rash without participating in the study.  http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/stari/

==Symptoms==
[[Image:STARI Rash.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Bulls eye" STARI rash]]Diagnosis is based on a circular "bulls eye" rash at the site of infection called [[Erythema chronicum migrans]], which is very similar to that seen in Lyme disease. However, the symptoms of STARI are mild,  and resemble [[influenza]], with fatigue, muscle pains, and headache.<ref name=Kirkland>{{cite journal |author=Kirkland KB |title=Erythema migrans-like rash illness at a camp in North Carolina: a new tick-borne disease? |journal=Arch.

==Treatment==
Infections are treated with antibiotics, particularly [[doxycycline]], and the acute symptoms appear to respond to these drugs.<ref name=James/><ref name=Blanton>{{cite journal |author=Blanton L, Keith B, Brzezinski W |title=Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness: Erythema Migrans Is Not Always Lyme Disease |journal=South.

==Prognosis==
No serious long-term effects are known for this disease,<ref name=Blanton/> but preliminary evidence suggests that if such symptoms do occur, they are less severe than those associated with Lyme disease.<ref name=Masters2008/>
