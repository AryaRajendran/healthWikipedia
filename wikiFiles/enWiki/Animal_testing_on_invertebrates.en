'''Most animal testing involves [[invertebrate]]s''', especially ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a fruit [[fly]], and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a [[nematode]]. These animals offer scientists many advantages over vertebrates, including their short life cycle, simple anatomy and the ease with which large numbers of individuals may be studied. Invertebrates are often cost-effective,<ref>Andre, RG, RA Wirtz, and YT Das (1989). [http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Labinsects/models.pdf "Insect Models for Biomedical Research"]. In: ''Nonmammalian Animal Models for Biomedical Research'', AD Woodhead (Editor), CRC Press: Boca Raton, FL. Retrieved November 13, 2008.</ref> as thousands of flies or nematodes can be housed in a single room.

With the exception of some [[cephalopod]]s, invertebrate species are not protected under most animal research legislation, and therefore the total number of invertebrates used remains unknown.

Research on invertebrates is the foundation for current understanding of the genetics of animal development. ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' is especially valuable as the precise lineage of all the organism's 959 somatic cells is known, giving a complete picture of how this organism goes from a single cell in a fertilized egg, to an adult animal.<ref name=Schulenburg/> The [[genome]] of this nematode has also been fully sequenced and any one of these genes can easily be inactivated through [[RNA interference]], by feeding the worms [[antisense RNA]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee J, Nam S, Hwang SB, ''et al'' |title=Functional genomic approaches using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system |journal=J.

The fly ''D. melanogaster'' is the most widely-used animal in [[genetics|genetic studies]]. This comes from the simplicity of breeding and housing the flies, which allows large numbers to be used in experiments. [[Molecular biology]] is relatively simple in these organisms and a huge variety of mutant and [[genetically-modified organism|genetically-modified]] flies have been developed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dietzl G, Chen D, Schnorrer F, ''et al'' |title=A genome-wide transgenic RNAi library for conditional gene inactivation in Drosophila |journal=Nature |volume=448 |issue=7150 |pages=151–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17625558 |doi=10.1038/nature05954}}</ref> Fly genetics has been vital in the study of [[morphogenesis|development]], the [[cell cycle]], [[behavior]], and [[neuroscience]]. The similarities in the basic biochemistry of all animals allows flies to be used as simple systems to investigate the genetics of conditions such as [[heart disease]] and [[neurodegenerative disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Marsh JL, Thompson LM |title=Can flies help humans treat neurodegenerative diseases? |journal=Bioessays |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=485–96 |year=2004 |pmid=15112229 |doi=10.1002/bies.20029}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bier E, Bodmer R |title=Drosophila, an emerging model for cardiac disease |journal=Gene |volume=342 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=2004 |pmid=15527959 |doi=10.1016/j.gene.2004.07.018}}</ref> However, like nematodes, ''D. melanogaster'' is not widely used in applied medical research, as the fly [[immune system]] differs greatly from that found in humans,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leclerc V, Reichhart JM |title=The immune response of Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Immunol.
