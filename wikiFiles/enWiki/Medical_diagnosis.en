'''Medical diagnosis''' (often simply termed '''diagnosis''') refers both to the process of attempting to determine or identify a possible [[disease]] or [[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]] (and diagnosis in this sense can also be termed (medical) '''diagnostic procedure'''), and to the opinion reached by this process (also being termed (medical) '''diagnostic opinion'''). From the point of view of statistics the diagnostic procedure involves [[classification test]]s. It is a major component of, for example, the [[Doctor's visit#Procedure|procedure of a doctor's visit]].

== History and Etymology ==
{{main|History of medical diagnosis}}
The history of medical diagnosis began in earnest from the days of [[Imhotep]] in [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Hippocrates]] in [[ancient Greece]].  In Traditional Chinese Medicine, there are four diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation-olfaction, interrogation,  and palpation.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/978-1-4020-4425-0_8500}}</ref>  A [[Babylonia]]n medical textbook, the ''Diagnostic Handbook'' written by [[Esagil-kin-apli]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1069-1046 BC), introduced the use of [[empiricism]], [[logic]] and [[rationality]] in the diagnosis of an illness or disease.<ref>H. F. J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', p. 97-98, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 90-04-13666-5.</ref> The book made use of logical rules in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and [[prognosis]].<ref>H. F. J. Horstmanshoff, Marten Stol, Cornelis Tilburg (2004), ''Magic and Rationality in Ancient Near Eastern and Graeco-Roman Medicine'', p. 99, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 90-04-13666-5.</ref> Esagil-kin-apli described the symptoms for many varieties of [[epilepsy]] and related [[ailment]]s along with their diagnosis and prognosis.<ref>Marten Stol (1993), ''Epilepsy in Babylonia'', p. 5, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 90-72371-63-1.</ref>

The plural of diagnosis is ''diagnoses'', the verb is ''to diagnose'', and a person who diagnoses is called a ''diagnostician''. The word ''[[Wiktionary: diagnosis|diagnosis]]'' ({{IPA-en|daɪ.əɡˈnoʊsɨs|}}) is derived through [[Latin]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word διαγιγνώσκει, meaning to discern or distinguish.<ref name="urlOnline Etymology Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=diagnosis |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  This Greek word is formed from διά, meaning ''apart'',  and γιγνώσκειν, meaning ''to perceive''.

The practice of diagnosis continues to be dominated by theories set down in the early 20th century.

== Medical Diagnosis ==
Medical diagnosis or the actual process of making a diagnosis is a cognitive process. A clinician uses several sources of data and puts the pieces of the puzzle together to make a diagnostic impression. The initial diagnostic impression can be a broad term describing a category of diseases instead of a specific disease or condition. After the initial diagnostic impression, the clinician obtains follow up tests and procedures to get more data to support or reject the original diagnosis and will attempt to narrow it down to a more specific level. Diagnostic procedures are the specific tools that the clinicians use to narrow the diagnostic possibilities.

===Diagnostic procedure===
A diagnosis, in the sense of diagnostic procedure, can be regarded as an attempt at classification of an individual's condition into separate and distinct categories that allow medical decisions about treatment and prognosis to be made. Subsequently, a diagnostic opinion is often described in terms of a disease or other condition, but in the case of a wrong diagnosis, the individual's actual disease or condition is not the same as the individual's diagnosis.

A diagnostic procedure may be performed by various [[health care professional]]s such as a [[physician]], physical therapist, [[optometrist]], [[Healthcare science|healthcare scientist]], [[chiropractor]], [[dentist]], [[podiatrist]], [[nurse practitioner]], or [[physician assistant]]s. This article uses ''diagnostician'' as any of these person categories.

A diagnostic procedure (as well as the opinion reached thereby) does not necessarily involve elucidation of the [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]] of the diseases or conditions of interest, that is, what ''caused'' the disease or condition. Such elucidation can be useful to optimize treatment, further specify the prognosis or prevent recurrence of the disease or condition in the future.

===Diagnostic opinion===
However, a diagnosis can take many forms.<ref>{{cite book|last=Treasure|first=Wilfrid|title=Diagnosis and Risk Management in Primary Care: words that count, numbers that speak|chapter=Chapter 1: Diagnosis |year=2011|publisher=Radcliffe|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84619-477-1}}</ref> It might be a matter of naming the disease, lesion, dysfunction or disability. It might be a management-naming or prognosis-naming exercise. It may indicate either degree of abnormality on a continuum or kind of abnormality in a classification. It’s influenced by non-medical factors such as power, ethics and financial incentives for patient or doctor. It can be a brief summation or an extensive formulation, even taking the form of a story or metaphor. It might be a means of communication such as a computer code through which it triggers payment, prescription, notification, information or advice. It might be [[pathogenic]] or [[salutogenic]]. It’s generally uncertain and provisional.

==Indication for diagnostic procedure==
The initial task is to detect a [[Indication (medicine)|medical indication]] to perform a diagnostic procedure. Indications include:
*Detection of any deviation from what is known to be normal, such as can be described in terms of, for example, [[anatomy]] (the structure of the human body), [[physiology]] (how the body works), [[pathology]] (what can go wrong with the anatomy and physiology), [[psychology]] (thought and behavior) and [[human homeostasis]] (regarding mechanisms to keep body systems in balance). Knowledge of what is normal and measuring of the patient's current condition against those norms can assist in determining the patient's particular departure from homeostasis and the degree of departure, which in turn can assist in quantifying the indication for further diagnostic processing.
*A complaint expressed by a patient.
*The fact that a patient has sought a diagnostician can itself be an indication to perform a diagnostic procedure. Therefore, in, for example, a [[doctor's visit]], the physician may already start performing a diagnostic procedure by, for example, watching the [[gait]] of the patient from the waiting room to the doctor's office even before she or he has started to present any complaints.

Even during an already ongoing diagnostic procedure, there can be an indication to perform another, separate, diagnostic procedure for another, potentially concomitant, disease or condition. This may occur as a result of an [[incidental finding]] of a sign unrelated to the parameter of interest, such as can occur in comprehensive tests such as [[radiology|radiological]] studies like [[magnetic resonance imaging]] or [[blood test]] panels that also include blood tests that are not relevant for the ongoing diagnosis.

== General components ==
General components, which are present in a diagnostic procedure in most of the various available methods include:
*Complementing the already given information with further data gathering, which may include questions of the [[medical history]] (potentially from other people close to the patient as well), [[physical examination]] and various [[diagnostic test]]s.<br> A diagnostic test is any kind of [[medical test]] performed to aid in the diagnosis or detection of disease. Diagnostic tests can also be used to provide prognostic information on people with established disease.<ref>Thompson, C. & Dowding, C. (2009) Essential Decision Making and Clinical Judgement for Nurses.</ref>
*Processing of the answers, findings or other results. Consultations with other providers and specialists in the field may be sought.

== Specific methods ==
There are a number of methods or techniques that can be used in a diagnostic procedure, including performing a [[differential diagnosis]] or following [[medical algorithm]]s.<ref name=Langlois-p198>Making a diagnosis, John P. Langlois, Chapter 10 in Fundamentals of clinical practice (2002). Mark B. Mengel, Warren Lee Holleman, Scott A. Fields. 2nd edition. p.198. ISBN 0-306-46692-9</ref> In reality, a diagnostic procedure may involve components of multiple methods.<ref name=Langlois-p204>Making a diagnosis, John P. Langlois, Chapter 10 in Fundamentals of clinical practice (2002). Mark B. Mengel, Warren Lee Holleman, Scott A. Fields. 2nd edition. p.204. ISBN 0-306-46692-9</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
{{Main|Differential diagnosis}}
The method of differential diagnosis is based on finding as many candidate diseases or conditions as possible that can possibly cause the signs or symptoms, followed by a [[process of elimination]] or at least of rendering the entries more or less probable by further [[medical test]]s and other processing until, aiming to reach the point where only one candidate disease or condition remains as probable. The final result may also remain a list of possible conditions, ranked in order of probability or severity.

The resultant diagnostic opinion by this method can be regarded more or less as a [[diagnosis of exclusion]]. Even if it doesn't result in a single probable disease or condition, it can at least rule out any imminently life-threatening conditions.

Unless the provider is certain of the condition present, further medical tests, such as medical imaging, are performed or scheduled in part to confirm or disprove the diagnosis but also to document the patient's status and keep the patient's medical history up to date.

If unexpected findings are made during this process, the initial [[hypothesis]] may be ruled out and the provider must then consider other hypotheses.

===Pattern recognition===
In a [[pattern recognition]] method the provider uses experience to recognize a pattern of clinical characteristics.<ref name=Langlois-p198/> It is mainly based on certain symptoms or signs being [[Association (psychology)|associated]] with certain diseases or conditions, not necessarily involving the more cognitive processing involved in a differential diagnosis.

This may be the primary method used in cases where diseases are "obvious", or the provider's experience may enable him or her to recognize the condition quickly. Theoretically, a certain pattern of signs or symptoms can be directly associated with a certain therapy, even without a definite decision regarding what is the actual disease, but such a compromise carries a substantial risk of missing a diagnosis which actually has a different therapy so it may be limited to cases where no diagnosis can be made.

===Diagnostic criteria===
The term ''diagnostic criteria'' designates the specific combination of [[sign (medicine)|signs]], [[symptom]]s, and test results that the [[clinician]] uses to attempt to determine the correct diagnosis.

Some examples of diagnostic criteria are:
*[[Amsterdam criteria]] for [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]]
*[[McDonald criteria]] for [[multiple sclerosis]]
*[[Systemic_lupus_erythematosus#Diagnostic_criteria|ACR criteria for systemic lupus erythematosis]]

===Clinical decision support system===
[[Clinical decision support system]]s are interactive computer programs designed to assist health professionals with decision-making tasks. The clinician interacts with the software utilizing both the clinician’s knowledge and the software to make a better analysis of the patients data than either human or software could make on their own.  Typically the system makes suggestions fore the clinician to look through and the clinician picks useful information and removes erroneous suggestions.<ref>Decision support systems. 26 July 2005. 17 Feb. 2009 <http://www.openclinical.org/dss.html></ref>

===Other diagnostic procedure methods===
Other methods that can be used in performing a diagnostic procedure include:
[[File:Assessment and treatment algorithm for overweight and obesity.png|thumb|350px|An example of a medical algorithm for assessment and treatment of [[overweight]] and [[obesity]].]]
*Usage of [[medical algorithm]]s
*An "exhaustive method", in which every possible question is asked and all possible data is collected.<ref name=Langlois-p198/>

== Diagnostic opinion and its effects ==
Once a diagnostic opinion has been reached, the provider is able to propose a management plan, which will include treatment as well as plans for follow-up. From this point on, in addition to treating the patient's condition, the provider can educate the patient about the [[etiology]], progression, [[prognosis]], other outcomes, and possible treatments of her or his ailments, as well as providing advice for maintaining health.

A treatment plan is proposed which may include therapy and follow-up consultations and tests to [[monitoring (medicine)|monitor]] the condition and the progress of the treatment, if needed, usually according to the medical guidelines provided by the medical field on the treatment of the particular illness.

Relevant information should be added to the [[medical record]] of the patient.

A failure to respond to treatments that would normally work may indicate a need for review of the diagnosis.

== Additional types of diagnosis ==
Sub-types of diagnoses include:

;Clinical diagnosis
:A diagnosis made on the basis of [[medical sign]]s and patient-reported [[symptom]]s, rather than [[diagnostic test]]s
;Laboratory diagnosis
:A diagnosis based significantly on laboratory reports or test results, rather than the [[physical examination]] of the patient. For instance, a proper diagnosis of infectious diseases usually requires both an examination of signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory characteristics of the pathogen involved.
;Radiology diagnosis
:A diagnosis based primarily on the results from [[medical imaging]] studies. [[Greenstick fracture]]s are common radiological diagnoses.
;Principal diagnosis
:The single medical diagnosis that is most relevant to the patient's [[chief complaint]] or need for treatment.  Many patients have additional diagnoses.
;Admitting diagnosis
:The diagnosis given as the reason why the patient was admitted to the hospital; it may differ from the actual problem or from the ''discharge diagnoses'', which are the diagnoses recorded when the patient is discharged from the hospital.
;[[Differential diagnosis]]
:A process of identifying all of the possible diagnoses that could be connected to the signs, symptoms, and lab findings, and then ruling out diagnoses until a final determination can be made.
;[[Diagnostic criteria]]
:Designates the combination of [[sign (medicine)|signs]], [[symptom]]s, and test results that the [[clinician]] uses to attempt to determine the correct diagnosis. They are standards, normally published by international committees, and they are designed to offer the best [[sensitivity and specificity]] possible, respect the presence of a condition, with the state-of-the-art technology.
;[[Prenatal diagnosis]]
:Diagnosis work done before birth
;[[Diagnosis of exclusion]]
:A medical condition whose presence cannot be established with complete confidence from either examination or testing. Diagnosis is therefore by elimination of all other reasonable possibilities.
;[[Dual diagnosis]]
:The diagnosis of two related, but separate, medical conditions or [[co-morbid]]ities; the term almost always refers to a diagnosis of a serious mental illness and a substance addiction.
;[[Self-diagnosis]]
:The diagnosis or identification of a medical conditions in oneself.  Self-diagnosis is very common and typically accurate for everyday conditions, such as [[headache]]s, [[menstrual cramp]]s, and [[headlice]].
;[[Remote diagnosis]]
:A type of [[telemedicine]] that diagnosis a patient without being physically in the same room as the patient.
;[[Nursing diagnosis]]
:Rather than focusing on biological processes, a nursing diagnosis identifies people's responses to situations in their lives, such as a readiness to change or a willingness to accept assistance.
;[[Computer-aided diagnosis]]
:Providing [[symptoms]] allows the computer to identify the problem and [[diagnose]] the user to the best of its ability. Health screening begins by identifying the part of the body where the symptoms are located; the computer cross-references a database for the corresponding [[disease]] and presents a diagnosis.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.webmedicine.ca | title= Connection between onset of symptoms and diagnosis | author= WebMed Solutions |accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref>
;[[Overdiagnosis]]
:The diagnosis of "disease" that will never cause symptoms, distress, or death during a patient's lifetime
;[[Wastebasket diagnosis]]
:A vague, or even completely fake, medical or psychiatric label given to the patient or to the [[medical record]]s department for essentially non-medical reasons, such as to reassure the patient by providing an official-sounding label, to make the provider look effective, or to obtain approval for treatment.  This term is also used as a derogatory label for disputed, poorly described, overused, or questionably classified diagnoses, such as [[pouchitis]] and [[senility]], or to dismiss diagnoses that amount to [[overmedicalization]], such as the labeling of normal responses to physical hunger as [[reactive hypoglycemia]].
;[[Retrospective diagnosis]]
:The labeling of an illness in a historical figure or specific historical event using modern knowledge, methods and disease classifications.

==Overdiagnosis==
{{main|Overdiagnosis}}
Overdiagnosis is the diagnosis of "disease" that will never cause symptoms or death during a patient's lifetime. It is a problem because it turns people into patients unnecessarily and because it can lead to economic waste ([[overutilization]]) and treatments that may cause harm. Overdiagnosis occurs when a disease is diagnosed correctly, but the diagnosis is irrelevant. A correct diagnosis may be irrelevant because treatment for the disease is not available, not needed, or not wanted.

==Errors in diagnosis==
{{further|Medical error}}
Causes and factors of error in diagnosis are:<ref>{{cite doi|10.1207/s15516709cog0503_3}}</ref>
* the manifestation of disease are not sufficiently noticeable
* a disease is omitted from consideration
* too much significance is given to some aspect of the diagnosis
* the condition is a [[rare disease]] with symptoms suggestive of many other conditions
* the condition has a rare [[Wiktionary:presentation|presentation]]

==Lag time==
When making a medical diagnosis, a ''[[lag time]]'' is a delay in time until a step towards [[diagnosis]] of a disease or condition is made. Types of lag times are mainly:
*''Onset-to-medical encounter lag time'', the time from onset of [[symptom]]s until visiting a [[health care provider]]<ref name=Chan1994>{{cite pmid|8003053}}</ref>
*''Encounter-to-diagnosis lag time'', the time from first medical encounter to diagnosis<ref name=Chan1994/>
