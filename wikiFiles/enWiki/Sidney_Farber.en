'''Sidney Farber''' (September 30, 1903 – March 30, 1973) was an American pediatric [[pathologist]]. He is regarded as the father of modern [[chemotherapy]], and after whom the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] is named.

==Biography==
Farber was born in 1903 in [[Buffalo, New York]], the third oldest of a family of 14 children. He was a graduate of the [[University at Buffalo]] in 1923. In the mid-1920s, Jewish students were often not admitted to US medical schools.  Farber was fluent in German,<ref name="Mukherjee2010">{{citation|last=Mukherjee|first=Siddhartha|authorlink=Siddhartha Mukherjee|title=The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5rF_31RVTnMC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=16 November 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0795-9}}</ref> so he undertook his first year of medical school at the Universities of Heidelberg and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] in [[Germany]]. Having excelled in Germany, Farber entered [[Harvard Medical School]] as a second-year student and graduated in 1927.<ref name=Mukherjee2010 />  He was married to [[Norma Farber|Norma C. Farber]] (formerly Holzman), a children's author. He was the brother of the noted philosopher and UB professor, [[Marvin Farber]] (1901–1980).

After graduate training in pathology at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (the predecessor of [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]]) in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he was mentored by [[Kenneth Blackfan]], Farber was appointed to a resident pathologist post at [[Children's Hospital Boston|Children's Hospital]]. He became an assistant in pathology at Harvard Medical School in 1928. In 1929, he became the first full-time pathologist to be based at Children's Hospital.<ref name=Mukherjee2010 />

While working at Harvard Medical School on a research project funded by a grant from the [[American Cancer Society]], he carried out both the preclinical and clinical evaluation of [[aminopterin]] (synthesized in consultation with Farber by [[Yellapragada Subbarao]]), a folate antagonist in childhood [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]. He showed for the first time that induction of clinical and hematological [[remission (medicine)|remission]] in this disease was achievable.<ref name=Mukherjee2010 /> These findings promoted Farber as the "father" of the modern era of chemotherapy for neoplastic disease, having already been recognized for a decade as the "father" of modern pediatric pathology.<ref>
{{citation|first=Denis R.|last= Miller|title= A tribute to Sidney Farber – the father of modern chemotherapy|journal=British Journal of Haematology|volume=134, Issue 1|pages=20–26|month=July|year= 2006|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06119.x/full|accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref> Throughout the 1950s and '60s, Farber continued to make advances in cancer research, notably the 1955 discovery that the antibiotic actinomycin D and radiation therapy could produce remission in Wilms' tumor, a pediatric cancer of the kidneys. And it was during this period that he took his persuasive powers to a national stage.

===Fundraising for Cancer Research===

Farber began raising funds for cancer research with the [[Variety Club]] of New England in 1947.  Together they created [[The Jimmy Fund]], which was one of the first nationwide fundraising efforts to take full advantage of modern media, such as a broadcast of the radio show ''[[Truth or Consequences]]'' on 22 May 1948.  The success of the Jimmy Fund led Farber to realize the importance of marketing in the scientific advancement of knowledge about diseases.  According to [[Siddhartha Mukherjee]], this realization
<blockquote>
''...set off a seismic transformation in [Farber's] career that would far outstrip his transformation from a pathologist to a leukemia doctor.  This second transformation &mdash; from a clinician into an advocate for cancer research &mdash; reflected the transformation of cancer itself.  The emergence of cancer from ''its'' basement into the glaring light of publicity would change the trajectory of [the story of cancer research in the 20th century].''<ref name=Mukherjee2010 />
</blockquote>
Beginning in the early 1950s, and continuing until his death in 1973, Farber became a star presenter at Congressional hearings on appropriations for cancer research. Animated, with a flair for the dramatic anecdote and poignant case history, Farber made a compelling speaker. He was not given to understatement or half-hearted vagueness.  Farber was startlingly successful. With [[Mary Woodard Lasker]], a longtime advocate of biomedical research, famed surgeon [[Michael E. DeBakey]], Senator [[J. Lister Hill]] of Alabama and Congressman [[John E. Fogarty]] of Rhode Island, Farber led the drive for a massive expansion in federal spending for cancer research.  Between 1957 and 1967, the annual budget of the [[National Cancer Institute]], the government's primary funder of cancer research, jumped from $48 million to $176 million.<ref name="dana-farber.org">{{cite web| url=http://www.dana-farber.org/About-Us/History-and-Milestones.aspx | title= History of the Dana-Farber Institute |accessdate= 8 March 2013}}</ref>

The [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] was originally named the '''Sidney Farber Cancer Center''' in honor of its founder in 1974. The long-term support of the Charles A. Dana Foundation was acknowledged by incorporating the Institute under its present name of the '''Dana-Farber Cancer Institute''' in 1983.<ref name="dana-farber.org"/> '''Farber Hall''', built in 1953 on the South Campus of the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] is named for him.
