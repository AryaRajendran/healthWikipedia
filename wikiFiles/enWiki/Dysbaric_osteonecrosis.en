'''Dysbaric osteonecrosis''' or '''DON''' is a form of [[avascular necrosis]] where there is death of a portion of the [[bone]] that is thought to be caused by [[nitrogen]] [[embolism]] (blockage of the [[blood vessels]] by a bubble of nitrogen coming out of solution) in divers.<ref name=Brubakk>{{cite book |title=Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving, 5th Rev ed |last=Brubakk |first=Alf O |coauthors=Neuman. Tom S |year=2003 |publisher=Saunders Ltd |location=United States |isbn=0-7020-2571-2 |page=800 }}</ref> Although the definitive pathologic process is poorly understood, there are several hypotheses: 

*Intra- or extravascular nitrogen in bones, "nitrogen embolism".
*Osmotic gas effects due to intramedullary pressure effects.
*fat embolism
*hemoconcentration and increased coagulability.

==Process==
The [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] is made by [[x-ray]]/[[MRI]] appearance and has five juxta-articular classifications and forehead, neck, and shaft classifications indicating early [[radiological]] signs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coulthard, A; Pooley, J; Reed J; Walder, D |title=Pathophysiology of dysbaric osteonecrosis: a magnetic resonance imaging study |journal=Undersea Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=119–20 |year=1996 |issn=1066-2936 |oclc=26915585 |pmid=8840481 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2403 |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

Early on there is flattening of articular surfaces, thinning of [[cartilage]] with [[osteophyte]] (spur) formation. In juxta-articular lesions without [[symptoms]], there is dead bone and marrow separated from living bone by a line of dense collagen. Microscopic [[cyst]]s form, fill with [[necrotic]] material and there is massive necrosis with replacement by cancellous bone with collapse of the lesions. 

The [[lesion]] begins as a random finding on x-ray without symptoms. Symptomatic lesions usually involve joint surfaces and [[fracture]] with attempted healing occurs. This process takes place over months to years and eventually causes disabling [[arthritis]], particularly of the femoral head (hip). 

The following staging system is sometimes useful when managing lesions.<ref name=Brubakk/>
* Stage 0 - Intravascular [[coagulation]]
* Stage 1 - Dead Bone without repair
* Stage 2 - Dead Bone with repair but without collapse
* Stage 3 - Dead Bone with repair and with collapse
* Stage 4 - Secondary degenerative [[arthritis]]

In a study of bone lesions in 281 compressed air workers done by Walder in 1969, 29% of the lesions were in the humeral head (shoulder), 16% in the femoral head (hip), 40% in the lower end of the femur (lower thigh at the knee) and 15% in the upper tibia (knee below the knee cap). 

Worsening of the condition from continued decompression in an asymptomatic x-ray finding may occur. 

==Prevalence==
Dysbaric osteonecrosis is a significant occupational hazard, occurring in 50% of commercial Japanese divers, 65% of Hawaiian fishermen and 16% of commercial and caisson divers in the UK.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ohta, Yoshimi; Matsunaga, Hitoshi |title=Bone lesions in divers |journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (Br) |volume=56B |pages=3–15 |year=1974 |month=Feb |issue=1 |publisher=British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery |url=http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/content/abstract/56-B/1/3 |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wade, CE; Hayashi, EM; Cashman, TM; Beckman, EL |title=Incidence of dysbaric osteonecrosis in Hawaii's diving fishermen |journal=Undersea Biomedical Research |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=137–47 |year=1978 |issn=1066-2936 |oclc=26915585 |pmid=675879 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2705 |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>
Its relationship to compressed air is strong in that it may follow a single exposure to compressed air, may occur with no history of DCS but is usually associated with significant compressed air exposure.<ref name="pmid6115158">{{cite journal |author=British Medical Research Council Decompression Sickness Central Registry and Radiological Panel |title=Aseptic bone necrosis in commercial divers.

==Treatment==

Treatment is difficult, often requiring a joint replacement. Spontaneous improvement occasionally happens and some juxta-articular lesions don't progress to collapse. Other treatments include immobilization and osteotomy of the [[femur]]. Cancellous bone grafts are of little help. 

==Prevention==
Prevention is a more successful strategy than treatment.  By using the safest decompression table possible, the risk of DON is reduced.  Prompt treatment of any symptoms of [[decompression sickness]] (DCS) with recompression and [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen]] also reduce the risk of subsequent DON.

==Prognosis==
If the diver has not been exposed to excessive depth and decompression and presents as DON, there may be a predisposition for the condition. Diving should be restricted to shallow depths.  Divers who have suffered from DON are at increased risk of future fracture of a juxta-articular lesion during a dive, and may face complications with future joint replacements.  Because of the young age of the population normally affected, little data is available regarding joint replacement complications. 

There is the potential for worsening of DON for any diving where there might be a need for decompression, experimental or [[helium]] diving. Physically stressful diving should probably be restricted, both in sport diving and work diving due to the possibility of unnecessary stress to the joint. Any diving should be less than 40 feet/12 meters. These risks are affected by the degree of disability, and the type of lesion; juxtaarticular or shaft.
