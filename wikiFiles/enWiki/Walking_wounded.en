In [[first aid]] and [[triage]], the '''walking wounded''' are [[injured]] persons who are of a relatively low priority. These [[patients]] are conscious and breathing and usually have only relatively minor injuries; thus they are capable of [[walking]]. Depending on the resources available, and the abilities of the injured persons, these people may sometimes be used to assist treatment of more seriously injured patients, or assist with other tasks.

In an emergency situation with many [[casualties]], the walking wounded are usually the largest category of casualty.
