'''Peter Roger Breggin''' (born May 11, 1936)<ref>''Contemporary Authors Online'', s.v. "Peter R(oger) Breggin" (accessed March 24, 2008).</ref> is an [[United States|American]] [[psychiatrist]] and critic of [[biological psychiatry]] and [[psychiatric medication]]. In his books, he advocates replacing psychiatry's use of drugs and [[electroconvulsive therapy]] with [[humanism|humanistic]] approaches, such as [[psychotherapy]], [[education]], and broader human services.<ref name="brain">Breggin, P R.

Breggin is the author of many books which are critical of modern psychiatry, including ''Toxic Psychiatry'', ''Talking Back to Prozac'' and ''Talking Back to Ritalin.'' His most recent book, ''Brain-Disabling Treatments in Psychiatry'', discusses medication spellbinding (in which patients who are doing worse after treatment fail to see that they are doing worse or recognize why),<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=hBd0V7Ex8PUC&pg=PR17&lpg=PR17&dq=Peter+breggin%2BRussell+Barkley%2BADHD&source=bl&ots=IpdlTrUSSL&sig=spT6wNLwehRUTmmw3Dm32SGKhLw&hl=en&ei=F8hCStzGGIO2swP2-6jMDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8] Brain-Disabling Treatments in Psychiatry, Breggin, p. 15</ref> the adverse effects of drugs and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the hazards of diagnosing and medicating children, the psychopharmaceutical complex, and guidelines for psychotherapy and counseling.

Breggin now lives in the [[Finger Lakes]] Region of Central [[New York]] and practices psychiatry in [[Ithaca, New York]].

==Education and early career==
Breggin graduated from [[Harvard College]] with honors,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=neKm1X6YPY0C&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=Harvard+medical+School+%2B1961%2B+peter+breggin%2Bhonors&source=bl&ots=l2T1CnpLNV&sig=9c-ztBELyAfsGdt7XP8bO] International Who's Who, 2004, p. 218, Breggin, Peter R.</ref> and attended [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Western Reserve]] Medical School. His postgraduate training in psychiatry began with an internship year of mixed medicine and psychiatry at the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) Upstate Medical Center in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. Breggin completed a first year of psychiatric residency at Harvard's Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston, where he was a teaching fellow at [[Harvard Medical School]], and finished his final two years of psychiatric residency at SUNY. This was followed by a two-year staff appointment to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), where he worked to build and staff mental health centers and education. Breggin has taught at several universities, obtaining faculty appointments to the [[Washington School of Psychiatry]], the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Department of Counseling, and the [[George Mason University]] Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution. Breggin has worked in a private practice since 1968.

Breggin is a life member of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and an editor for several scientific journals. His opinions have been portrayed both favorably and unfavorably in the media, including ''[[Time Magazine]]''<ref name="Time">{{cite news | title=Prozac's Worst Enemy | work=Christine Gorman, Time Magazine, Oct 10, 1994| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981579,00.html| accessdate=2006-07-08 | date=1994-10-10}}</ref> and the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref name="NY times 1">{{cite news | title= Free Expression or Irresponsibility?

==Research and publications==
Since 1964, Breggin has published on his major topic of interest, [[Psychopharmacology|clinical psychopharmacology]]. He wrote dozens of other articles, several book chapters, and more than twenty books. Many of Breggin's more recent articles are published in the peer-reviewed journal he co-founded with David Cohen and Steven Baldwin, ''[[Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry]]'', and in ''[[The International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine]]'' as well as in other scientific journals such as ''Primary Psychiatry'' (2006),<ref name="primary">Breggin, P.R.

In 1971 Breggin founded the [[International Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology]] (ICSPP)<ref>[www.psychintegrity.org]</ref>, a [[nonprofit]] research and educational network concerned with the impact of [[mental health]] theory and practices upon individual well-being, [[personal freedom]], and family and community values. As of July 2008 the center has a board of directors composed of 27 [[psychiatrists]], [[psychologists]], [[social workers]], [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselors]] and other professionals in the mental health field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icspp.org/Board-of-Directors/ |title=Board of Directors |publisher=ICSPP |accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref> The center holds annual scientific conferences that are open to the public. In 1999, the Center began to publish ''Ethical Human Sciences and Services'' (EHSS), which was later renamed ''Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry''.

===Conventional psychiatry===
A large portion of Breggin's work concentrates on the [[iatrogenic]] effects (negative side effects) of [[psychiatric medication]]s, arguing that the harmful side effects typically outweigh any benefit. Breggin also argues that psychosocial interventions are almost always superior in treating mental illness. He has argued against [[psychoactive drug]]s, electroshock (ECT), [[psychosurgery]], coercive [[outpatient commitment|involuntary treatment]], and [[Biological psychiatry|biological theories of psychiatry]].

According to Breggin, the [[pharmaceutical industry]] propagates disinformation which is accepted by unsuspecting doctors, saying "the psychiatrist accepts the bad science that establishes the existence of all these mental diseases in the first place. From there it’s just a walk down the street to all the drugs as remedies". He points out problems with conflicts-of-interest (such as the financial relationships between drug companies, researchers, and the [[American Psychiatric Association]]). Breggin states psychiatric drugs, "...are all, every class of them, highly dangerous". He asserts: "If [[neuroleptic]]s were used to treat anyone other than mental patients, they would have been banned a long time ago. If their use wasn't supported by powerful interest groups, such as the pharmaceutical industry and organized psychiatry, they would be rarely used at all. Meanwhile, the neuroleptics have produced the worst epidemic of [[neurological disease]] in history. At the least, their use should be severely curtailed."<ref name="bregginneuro">{{cite web |title=Should the use of neuroleptics be severely limited? |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080329011035/http://www.breggin.com/neuroleptics.html |author=Peter Breggin |accessdate=2008-04-06 |work=}}</ref>

In his book, ''Reclaiming Our Children'', he calls for the ethical treatment of children. Breggin argues that the [[child abuse|mistreatment of children]] is a national (U.S.) tragedy, including psychiatric diagnoses and prescription of drugs for children whose needs were not otherwise met. He especially objects to prescribing psychiatric medications to children, arguing that it distracts from their real needs in the family and schools, and is potentially harmful to their developing [[brain]]s and [[nervous system]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Psychiatric Drugging of Toddlers |work=Editorial by Peter R. Breggin |url=http://breggin.com/thepsychiatric.pbreggin.2000.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2006-09-08}}</ref>

===ADHD and Ritalin===
''[[The New York Times]]'' has labeled Breggin as the nation's best-known [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) critic. As early as 1991 he sardonically coined the acronym DADD, stating, "...most so-called ADHD children are not receiving sufficient attention from their fathers who are separated from the family, too preoccupied with work and other things, or otherwise impaired in their ability to parent. In many cases the appropriate diagnosis is Dad Attention Deficit Disorder (DADD)". Breggin has written two books specifically on the topic entitled, ''Talking Back to Ritalin'' and ''The Ritalin Factbook''. In these books he has made controversial claims, such as "Ritalin 'works' by producing malfunctions in the brain rather than by improving brain function. This is the only way it works".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breggin.com/ritalinbkexcerpt.html |title=Talking Back to Ritalin—New Breggin Book Excerpts |accessdate=2008-04-06 |work=}}</ref> 

Together with [[Fred Baughman]], Breggin testified about ADHD to the [[United States Congress]]. In Congress Breggin claimed "that there were no scientific studies validating ADHD", that children diagnosed with ADHD needed "discipline and better instruction" rather than psychiatric drugs, and that therapeutic stimulants "are the most [[Substance use disorder|addictive]] drugs known in medicine today."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.breggin.com/classactionmore.html |author=Peter Breggin |publisher=Breggin.com |title=Ritalin Class Action Suits |accessdate=2008-04-06 |work=}}</ref> Baughman and Breggin were also the major critics in a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] TV series about ADHD entitled 'Medicating Kids'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/ |title=Frontline: medicating kids |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2008-04-06 |format= |work=}}</ref> In an interview during this time period he referred to ADHD as a fiction. This increased critical attention to [[Ritalin]] resulted in the [[Ritalin class action lawsuits]] against [[Novartis]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA), and [[CHADD]] in which the plaintiffs sued for fraud. Specifically, they charged that the defendants had conspired to invent and promote the disorder ADHD to create a highly profitable market for the drug Ritalin. All five lawsuits were dismissed or withdrawn before they went to trial.

Breggin has been very critical of psychologist [[Russell Barkley]]'s work on ADHD, claiming that he exaggerates the benefits of stimulants and minimizes their hazards.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=hBd0V7Ex8PUC&pg=PR17&lpg=PR17&dq=Peter+breggin%2BRussell+Barkley%2BADHD&source=bl&ots=IpdlTrUSSL&sig=spT6wNLwehRUTmmw3Dm32SGKhLw&hl=en&ei=F8hCStzGGIO2swP2-6jMDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8] Brain Disabling Treatments in Psychiatry, Breggin, p. 264</ref>

===SSRI antidepressants===
In the early 1990s Breggin suggested there were problems with the methodology in the research of [[SSRI]] [[antidepressants]]. As early as 1991 in ''Talking Back to Prozac'', he warned that Prozac was causing violence, suicide and mania. Breggin elaborated on this theme in many subsequent books and articles about newer antidepressants. In 2005, the FDA began requiring [[black box warning]]s on [[SSRI]]s, warning of an association between SSRI use and suicidal behavior in children,<ref>{{cite web | title=Black Box Warning for Children and Suicidality | work=FDA Website |url=http://www.fda.gov/CDER/DRUG/antidepressants/PI_template.pdf#search=%22fda.gov%20suicide%20ssri%22/2006/paroxetineDHCPMay06.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=2006-07-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929124956/http://www.fda.gov/CDER/DRUG/antidepressants/PI_template.pdf#search=%22fda.gov%20suicide%20ssri%22/2006/paroxetineDHCPMay06.pdf |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> and later extended it to young adults. New general warnings were added along with the aforementioned black box warnings. These warnings confirmed many of the adverse effects first emphasized by Breggin in ''Toxic Psychiatry'' with specific mentions by the FDA of drug-induced "hostility," "irritability," and "mania". In 2006, the FDA expanded the warnings to include adults taking [[Paxil]], which is associated with a higher risk of suicidal behavior as compared to a [[placebo]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Paxil Black Black Box Warning| work=FDA Website | url=http://www.fda.gov/Medwatch/safety/2006/safety06.htm#paxil| accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref>

In contrast to Breggin's ''Talking Back to Prozac'', which was largely ignored by the press on its release, ''Prozac Backlash'', a critique of SSRIs by [[Harvard]] psychiatrist [[Joseph Glenmullen]] was widely praised by high-profile media sources.<ref>{{cite web | title=Media Reviews of Prozac Backlash | work=From J. Glenmullen's Website| url=http://www.prozacbacklash.com/reviews.html| accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref> Breggin complained about this in a subsequent book, ''The Antidepressant Fact Book'':

:"Glenmullen's (2000) scientific analysis of how SSRIs can cause suicide, violence, and other behavioral aberrations is essentially the same as my earlier detailed analyses... my hundreds of media appearances, and my testimony in court cases that Glenmullen also had available. Glenmullen also interviewed my wife and coauthor Ginger Breggin for his book and was sent research documents from our files that he was otherwise unable to obtain. Disappointingly, in his book, Glenmullen literally expurgates our contribution, never mentioning my origination of the ideas he was espousing and never acknowledging my efforts.... Nonetheless, his book provides a service...."<ref>{{cite web | title=The Antidepressant Fact Book, pg. 207| work=Breggin, P.R. (2001).

In 1994, Breggin said that [[Eli Lilly and Company]] (maker of the [[antidepressant]] [[fluoxetine|Prozac]]) attempted to discredit him and his book ''Talking Back to Prozac'' by linking him to the Church of Scientology and labeling his views as "Neo-Scientology."<ref name="McCarthy Lives">{{cite web | author=Peter R.

===ECT===
Breggin has written several books and scientific articles critical of electroconvulsive therapy. He claims that "...the damage produces [[delirium]] so severe that patients can't fully experience [[depression (mood)|depression]] or other higher mental functions during the several weeks after electroshock".  He was one of nineteen speakers at the 1985 NIH Consensus Development Conference on ECT. The Consensus panel (of which Breggin was not a member) found that ECT could be a useful therapy in some carefully defined cases.<ref>Electroconvulsive Therapy.

On September 16, 2011 in Winnipeg, Canada, a Provincial judge cited Breggin’s testimony in concluding that Prozac caused a sixteen-year-old boy to knife a friend to death, noting that, "Dr. Breggin's explanation of the effect Prozac was having on C.J.P.'s behavior both before that day and in committing an impulsive, inexplicable violent act that day corresponds with the evidence."<ref>{{cite web |title=THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF MANITOBA, Brian R.

In [[South Carolina]], Breggin testified on behalf of Peggy S. Salters, a psychiatric nurse who sued her doctors and Palmetto Baptist Hospital after ECT left her incapacitated in 2000.

Breggin testified as an [[expert witness]] in the Wesbecker case (Fentress et al., 1994), a lawsuit against Eli Lilly, makers of Prozac. Ultimately, the jury found for Eli Lilly. Breggin later claimed that this was because the plaintiffs and defendants had secretly settled behind closed doors.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eli Lilly, Missing Documents, Fentress Verdict |work=A Report by Peter Breggin |url=http://www.breggin.com/Eli%20LillyWithheld%20Prozac%20Documents--website%20version.pdf#search=%22breggin.com%20fentress%22 |accessdate=2006-09-08}}</ref> The Supreme Court of Kentucky concluded that the Wesbecker trial had been secretly settled by Eli Lilly before going to the jury in return for defendants presenting a weakened case that was bound to lose.

Breggin alleges that pharmaceutical manufacturers, particularly Eli Lilly, have committed ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks upon him in the form of linking him to [[Scientology]] campaigns against psychiatric drugs. Breggin acknowledges that he did work with Scientology starting in 1972, but states that by 1974 he "found {{interpolation|himself}} opposed to Scientology's values, agenda, and tactics", and in consequence "stopped all cooperative efforts in 1974 and publicly declared {{interpolation|his}} criticism of the group in a letter published in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''."<ref name="JML!">{{cite web | title=Joe McCarthy Lives!: He's whispering in the ear of Eli Lilly & Co., the manufacturer of Prozac | work=Dr. Breggin's comments on Eli Lilly, Scientology and his relationship with it. | url=http://www.breggin.com/Joemccarthylives.html | accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref> Breggin has also stated that he has a personal reason to dislike Scientology: His wife, Ginger, was once a Scientologist,<ref name="JML!" /><ref name="Frontline"/> and when they first met she was urged by other Scientologists to have no association with him because he was not also.

Several judges have questioned Breggin's credibility as an expert witness. For example, a Maryland judge in a medical malpractice case in 1995 said, "I believe that his bias in this case is blinding... he was mistaken in a lot of the factual basis for which he expressed his opinion."<ref name="Lightner vs. Alessi">Judge Hilary J. Caplan in Lightner v.

In 2002, Breggin was hired as an expert witness by a survivor of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in a case against the makers of an anti-depressant drug.  In his report, Breggin failed to mention the Columbine incident or one of the killers, instead focusing on the medication taken by the other, "...[[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris]] was suffering from a substance induced ([[Luvox]]-induced) mood disorder with depressive and manic features that had reached a psychotic level of violence and suicide. Absent persistent exposure to Luvox, Eric Harris probably would not have committed violence and suicide."<ref name="Luvox">{{cite web |url=http://www.drugawareness.org/Ribbon/Legal/record0021.html |title=Legal News |accessdate=2008-04-06 |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071120060301/http://www.drugawareness.org/Ribbon/Legal/record0021.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-20}}</ref> However, according to ''[[The Denver Post]]'', the judge of the case "...was visibly angry that the experts failed to view evidence prior to their depositions" even though they had months to do so. The evidence would have included hundreds of documents including a significant amount of video and audio tape that the killers had recorded. The judge stated, "...lawyers will be free to attack them on the basis of the evidence they haven't seen and haven't factored into their opinions."<ref>[http://www.namiscc.org/News/2002/newsletters/TAC-Nov15-2002.htm#Top Treatment Advocacy Center Newsletter – November 15 2002]</ref> The lawsuit was eventually dropped with the stipulation that the makers of Luvox donate $10,000 to the American Cancer Society.<ref name="Luvox"/>

In 2005, the [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]] [[Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] disqualified the testimony of Breggin because it did not meet the scientific rigor established by the [[Frye standard|''Frye'' standard]]. The judge stated "...Breggin spends 14 pages critiquing the treatment provided not because it ran counter to the acceptable standards of care, but because it ran counter to Breggin's personal ideas and ideologies of what the standards ought to be.”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://west.thomson.com/store/relatedpdfdownload.aspx?file=124713_2004350_15557.pdf |format=PDF|title=Pa.

==Criticism==
Due to his outspoken criticisms of many aspects of psychiatry, Breggin has become a controversial figure who is regularly at odds with the mental health establishment.<ref name="Forbes">{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2001/0723/060.html |title=A Headache For Novartis: Psychiatrist Peter Breggin is masterfully leading a campaign against Ritalin. Could he be overstating the case? |publisher=Forbes.com |accessdate=2008-04-06 |work= |date=2001-07-23}}</ref> He uses terms like "fraud" to describe the biological and genetic theories of mental disorders. He is critical of the medications used to treat these disorders, and the political process that determines the labels used for diagnosing mental disorders. He has also consistently warned about [[conflict of interest]] problems.<ref name="Frontline">{{cite web | title=medicating kids: interviews: peter breggin | work=PBS – Frontline | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/interviews/breggin.html | accessdate=2006-07-29 |date=2000-05-03}}</ref> 

In 1987, NAMI brought a complaint against Breggin with licensure board of the State of Maryland. NAMI was upset about remarks he made on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on April 2, 1987. On the TV show, Breggin stated that mental health clients should judge their clinicians in terms of their empathy and support; if they failed to show interest in them and tried to prescribe drugs during the first session, he advised such clients to seek assistance elsewhere. He also pointed out the [[iatrogenic]] effects of neuroleptic drugs. He was defended by a diverse group of psychiatrists and others who defended his right to publicly state his critical opinion.<ref name="NY times 1"/> Breggin was cleared of any wrongdoing by the [[Maryland]] medical board, which thanked him for his contribution to mental health in Maryland.<ref name="NY times 2"/> [[Time magazine]] has noted that other mental health professionals worry that "Breggin reinforces the myth that mental illness is not real, that you wouldn't be ill if you'd pull yourself up by the bootstraps...his views stop people from getting treatment. They could cost a life."<ref name="Time">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981579-2,00.html |title=Prozac's Worst Enemy |publisher=[[TIME magazine]] |accessdate=2008-04-06 |work= | date=1994-10-10}}</ref> However, despite this concern, an emphasis on a purely biological explanation of mental illness has actually been associated with an increase in stigma instead of a decrease by at least two studies.<ref name="Read, Law">{{cite web |url=http://isp.sagepub.com/content/45/3/216.abstract |title=The Relationship of Causal Beliefs and Contact With Users of Mental Health Services To Attitudes To the 'Mentally Ill'|publisher=International Journal of Social Psychiatry |accessdate=1999-09-06 |work=}}</ref><ref>http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?Volume=167&page=1321&journalID=13</ref>
