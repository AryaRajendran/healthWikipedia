A '''brain transplant''' or '''whole-body transplant''' is a hypothetical operation in which the brain of one organism is transplanted into the body of another. It is a procedure distinct from [[head transplant]]ation, which involves transferring the entire head to a new body, as opposed to the brain only. Theoretically, a person with advanced organ failure could be given a new and functional body while keeping their own personality and memories.

Historically, brain transplants have not been feasible and were widely regarded as impossible. Today, given progress in [[organ transplant]] and [[human cloning]] research, many scientists hold that brain transplants are theoretically possible and likely to be feasible in the future.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Brain transplants and similar concepts have been explored in various forms of fiction.

==Existing challenges==

One of the most significant barriers to the procedure is the inability of [[nerve]] tissue to heal properly; [[scar]]red nerve tissue does not transmit signals well (this is why a [[spinal cord injury]] is so devastating). However, recent research at the [[Wistar Institute]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] involving [[regeneration (biology)|tissue-regenerating]] mice (known as [[MRL mice]]) may provide pointers for further research as to how to regenerate nerves without scarring.

There is also a potential problem of the new interface at the spinal cord, in that even if all the nerves are connected successfully, they may still be connected ''incorrectly'', thus not transmitting the same information as the same nerve connection in the previous body. For example, a nerve that used to control the right index finger's muscle group might be connected to a different finger's muscle group, or another body part entirely. If this were to happen to a large number of connections, the person undergoing the transplant might end up with a body which transmitted sensory input to the wrong destination, making it incomprehensible and potentially requiring many years of rehabilitation.

Alternatively a [[brain–computer interface]] can be used connecting the subject to his own body. A study<ref>C. Ethier, E. R. Oby,  M. J. Bauman, L. E. Miller: [http://211.144.68.84:9998/91keshi/Public/File/34/485-7398/pdf/nature10987.pdf Restoration of grasp following paralysis through brain-controlled stimulation of muscles]. ''Nature'', April 2012.</ref> using a monkey as a subject shows that it is possible to directly use commands from the brain, bypass the spinal cord and enable hand function. An advantage is that this interface can be adjusted after the surgical interventions are done where nerves can not be reconnected without surgery.

Also, for the procedure to be practical, the age of the donated body must be sufficient: an adult brain cannot fit into a skull that has not reached its full growth, which occurs at age 9–12 years.

There is an advantage, however, with respect to the immune response. The brain is an [[Immune privilege|immunologically privileged]] organ, so rejection would not be a problem. (When other organs are transplanted, aggressive rejection can occur; this is a major difficulty with kidney and liver transplants.)<ref>Lou Jacobson: [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9708/fn.9708.html A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste].

==Partial brain transplant==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2010}}
An arguably more reasonable scenario is a partial brain transplant involving only enough tissue to provide key memories and a sense of continuity of identity. A fairly large but indeterminate amount of the brain is devoted to processing and controlling sensory, motor, and autonomic functions such as vision, [[olfaction]], movement, appetite, etc.; transplanting these portions is likely to be difficult and, if the goal is to transfer memories and/or identity, unnecessary. The recipient body of such a transplant probably would have to possess a naïve and never-conscious brain or partial brain, such as in a never-conscious [[cloned]] [[somatic|soma]]. This is the premise of ''I&nbsp;of Persistence'', a human life-extension manifesto and science fiction story. In that story, the older transplanted brain tissue is eventually removed and replaced with youthful tissue, restoring complete youthfulness with continuity (or persistence) of conscious identity.

In 1982 Dr. Dorothy T. Krieger, chief of [[endocrinology]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in New York City, achieved notable success with a partial brain transplant in mice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/18/us/transplant-success-reported-with-part-of-a-mouse-s-brain.html|title=Transplant Success Reported With Part of a Mouse's Brain|last=Ap|date=18 June 1982|work=The New York Times|page=9|accessdate=20 July 2010|location=San Francisco}}</ref> A partial brain transplant could accomplish essentially the same goal — movement of a person's "identity" from one body to another{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} — and thus qualify as a whole-body transplant no less than a full brain transplant. As Dr. Krieger demonstrated, barriers to accomplishing this feat might be much lower than transplantation of the entire brain.

In 1998, a team of [[surgeon]]s from the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] attempted to transplant a group of [[brain cells]] to Alma Cerasini, who had suffered a severe [[stroke]] that caused the loss of mobility in her right [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] as well as limited speech. The team's hope was that the cells would correct the listed damage.

==Brain transplants in popular culture==
Transplantation of a human brain from one body into another has appeared on occasion in popular literature.  The intended effect is most often either horrific or comedic, though many of these stories explore the medical, ethical, legal, and other issues that would surround the procedure.

* In [[Alexander Belyayev]]'s novel ''[[Hoiti-Toiti]]'' (1930) a scientist's brain is transplanted in the body of an elephant.
* The transplant has been a common subject in horror films, most notably ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''.
* The [[Ultra-Humanite]], one of the main villains opposing the Golden Age [[Superman]] and [[Justice Society of America]], often "died" at the end of an encounter, only to have his surviving brain transplanted into a new (not always human) body by robots and/or henchmen.
* The novel ''[[I Will Fear No Evil]]'' (1970) by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] features an elderly wealthy man who has his brain transplanted into the body of his deceased secretary.
* In the 1970s manga ''[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]]'' by [[Osamu Tezuka]], [[Black Jack (character)|Black Jack]] performs several brain transplants.
* The movie ''[[The Thing with Two Heads]]'' (1972) featured a head transplant.
* The Iranian comedy movie ''[[The Changed Man]]'' ({{lang-fa| مرد عوضی }}) (1998) featured a brain transplant.

The whole-body transplant is just one of several means of putting a consciousness into a new body that have been explored by both scientists and writers.

A similar procedure often found in science fiction is the transfer of one consciousness to another without moving the brain.  This is found in many sources, most often a [[body swap]] between two characters of an ongoing television series; it occurs in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series twice, as well as ''[[Freaky Friday]]'', ''[[Farscape]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'', ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''; even in Archie comics.  Since there is no movement of the brain(s), however, this is not quite the same as a whole-body transplant.

In the horror film ''[[The Skeleton Key]]'', the protagonist, Caroline, discovers that the old couple she is looking after are poor Voodoo witch doctors who stole the bodies of two young, privileged children in their care using a ritual which allows a soul to swap bodies. Unfortunately the evil old couple also trick Caroline and their lawyer into the same procedure, and both end up stuck in old dying bodies unable to speak while the witch doctors walk off with their young bodies.

In [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[The Tale of the Body Thief]]'', the vampire Lestat discovers a man, Raglan James, who can will himself into another person's body.  Lestat demands that the procedure be used on him to allow him to be human once again, but soon finds that he has made an error and is forced to recapture James in his vampiric form so he can take his body back.

In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe]]'', Emperor Palpatine is able to transfer his consciousness into clone bodies. In a sense, this allows him to return to life after the Battle of Endor, as well as other events where his current body dies. The clone bodies aren't quite as good as his original body and waste quickly due to the decaying power of the Dark Side of the Force. Upon realizing this, he tries to take over the body of Anakin Solo, but is unsuccessful and eventually meets his final end.

Similar in many ways to this is the idea of [[mind uploading]], promoted by [[Marvin Minsky]] and others with a mechanistic view of natural intelligence and an optimistic outlook regarding [[artificial intelligence]].  It is also a goal of [[Raëlism]], a small cult based in Florida, France, and Quebec.  While the ultimate goal of transplanting is transfer of the brain to a new body optimized for it by [[genetics]], [[proteomics]], and/or other medical procedures, in uploading the brain itself moves nowhere and may even be physically destroyed or discarded; the goal is rather to duplicate the information patterns contained within the brain.

Another similar literary theme, though different from either procedure described above, is the transplanting of a human brain into an artificial, usually robotic, body.  Examples of this include: ''[[Caprica]]''; ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]''; ''[[Ghost In The Shell]]''; ''[[RoboCop]]''; the [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Robotman (comics)|Robotman]]; the [[Cybermen]] from the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' television series; the [[cymek]]s in the ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' series; or full-body cyborgs in many [[manga]] or works in the [[cyberpunk]] genre.  In one episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', [[Spock's Brain]] is stolen and installed in a large computer-like structure; and in "[[I, Mudd]]" Uhura is offered immortality in an android body.  The novel ''Harvest of Stars'' by [[Poul Anderson]] features many central characters who undergo such transplants, and deals with the difficult decisions facing a human contemplating such a procedure.
