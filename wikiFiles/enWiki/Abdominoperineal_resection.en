An '''[[abdomen|abdomino]][[perineal]] [[Segmental resection|resection]]''', formally known as '''abdominoperineal resection of the rectum''' and '''abdominoperineal excision of the [[rectum]]''' or simply '''abdominoperineal excision''', is a [[surgery]] for [[rectal cancer]] or [[anal cancer]]. It is frequently [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] as '''AP resection''' and '''APR'''.

==Indication and description==
The principal indication for AP resection is a rectal carcinoma situated in the distal (lower) one-third of the rectum.<ref>American Cancer Society.    	
Detailed Guide: Colon and Rectum Cancer. cancer.org. URL: [http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_4x_Surgery_10.asp?sitearea= http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_4x_Surgery_10.asp?sitearea=]. Accessed on: February 5, 2008.</ref> Other indications include recurrent or residual anal carcinoma ([[squamous cell carcinoma]]) following initial, usually definitive combination chemoradiotherapy. 

APRs involves removal of the [[anus]], the [[rectum]] and part of the [[sigmoid colon]] along with the associated (regional) [[lymph nodes]], through incisions made in the [[abdomen]] and [[perineum]]. The end of the remaining [[sigmoid colon]] is brought out permanently as an opening, called a [[colostomy]], on the surface of the abdomen.

==Centralisation of rectal surgery==
This operation is one of the less commonly performed by [[general surgeon]]s, although they are specifically trained to perform this operation.  As low case volumes in rectal surgery have been found to be associated with higher complication rates,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schrag D, Panageas KS, Riedel E, ''et al.'' |title=Hospital and surgeon procedure volume as predictors of outcome following rectal cancer resection |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=236 |issue=5 |pages=583–92 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12409664  |pmc=1422616 |doi=10.1097/00000658-200211000-00008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Marusch F, Koch A, Schmidt U, Pross M, Gastinger I, Lippert H |title=Hospital caseload and the results achieved in patients with rectal cancer |journal=Br J Surg |volume=88 |issue=10 |pages=1397–402 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11578299 |doi=10.1046/j.0007-1323.2001.01873.x |url=}}</ref> it is often centralised in larger centres,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martling A, Holm T, Cedermark B |title=[Skills by training.

==Relation to low anterior resection (LAR)==
An APR, generally, results in a worse [[quality of life]] than the less invasive [[lower anterior resection]] (LAR).<ref>{{cite journal |author=McLeod RS |title=Comparison of quality of life in patients undergoing abdominoperineal extirpation or anterior resection for rectal cancer |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=233 |issue=2 |pages=157–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11176119 |doi=10.1097/00000658-200102000-00002 |pmc=1421195}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Grumann MM, Noack EM, Hoffmann IA, Schlag PM |title=Comparison of quality of life in patients undergoing abdominoperineal extirpation or anterior resection for rectal cancer |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=233 |issue=2 |pages=149–56 |year=2001 |pmid=11176118 |doi=10.1097/00000658-200102000-00001 |pmc=1421194}}</ref> Thus, LARs are generally the preferred treatment for rectal cancer insofar as this is surgically feasible.
