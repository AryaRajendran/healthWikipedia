'''Rudolph Carl Virchow''' (13 October 1821 – 5 September 1902) was a [[Medicine|German doctor]], [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], [[Pathology|pathologist]], [[prehistorian]], [[biologist]] and politician, known for his advancement of [[public health]]. Referred to as "the father of modern pathology", he is considered one of the founders of [[social medicine]].

In 1861, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1892, he was awarded the [[Copley Medal]]. Among his most famous students was anthropologist [[Franz Boas]], who became a professor at Columbia University.

The Society for Medical Anthropology gives an annual award in Virchow's name, the [[Rudolf Virchow Award]].

==Life and scientific career==
[[File:Rudolf Virchow NLM9.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Young Virchow]]
[[File:Herzzentrum-b.jpg|thumb|235px|right|Hospital - Campus Virchow Klinikum, Cardiology Center]]

From a farming family, he studied medicine and chemistry in Berlin at the [[Prussian Military Academy]] from 1839 to 1843<ref name=americana/> on a scholarship. When he graduated in 1843, he went to serve as [[Johannes Peter Mueller]]'s assistant at the [[Charité]] Hospital. At this time, the German medical tradition was inclined more towards ‘romantic speculation’ and ‘naked empiricism’, in contrast with the more scientific approach found in England and France.

At Charité, he learned [[microscopy]] alongside with [[Robert Froriep]]. Froriep was the editor of an abstract journal that specialised in foreign work, allowing Virchow to be exposed to the more forward-looking scientific ideas of France and England. In 1848, he qualified as a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], and became Froriep's successor. Unlike his German peers, Virchow used to have great faith that clinical observation, animal experimentation (to determine causes of diseases and the effects of drugs) and pathological anatomy, particularly at the microscopic level, were the basic principles of investigation in [[medical sciences]]. He went further and stated the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] was the basic unit of the body that had to be studied to understand disease. Although the term ‘cell’ had been coined in the 1600s, the building blocks of life were still considered to be the 21 tissues of Bichat, a concept described by the French physician [[Marie Bichat]]. Because his writings were not receiving favourable attention by German editors, he associated with [[Benno Reinhardt]] in founding the ''Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medizin'', world-famous as “Virchow's Archives”, which he edited alone from Reinhardt's death in 1852 until his own. This journal began publishing high-level contributions based on the criterion that no papers would be published which contained outdated, untested, dogmatic or speculative ideas.<ref name=americana/><ref name="Bagot2008"/>

In 1849, he was employed as chair of pathological anatomy at the [[University of Würzburg]], leaving his post at Carité, where he was experiencing political persecution. During his six-year period there, he concentrated on his scientific work, including detailed studies on venous thrombosis and cellular theory. By 1856, Virchow was asked to return from [[Würzburg]] to the Charité Hospital in Berlin. Such a reinstatement was evidence of the name he was achieving for himself in scientific and medical circles. He became Director of the Pathological Institute and remained in charge of the clinical section of the hospital for the next 20 years.<ref name="Bagot2008"/>

==Scientific Contributions==
===Cell Biology===
[[File:Virchow-cell.jpg|thumb|235px|Illustration of Virchow's cell theory]]

Virchow is credited with many important discoveries. His most widely known scientific contribution is his [[cell theory]], which built on the work of [[Theodor Schwann]]. He is cited as the first to recognize [[leukemia]] cells.<ref name="Mukherjee2010">{{cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=Siddhartha|authorlink=Siddhartha Mukherjee|title=The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5rF_31RVTnMC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=16 November 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0795-9}}</ref> He was one of the first to accept the work of [[Robert Remak]], who showed the origins of cells was the division of pre-existing cells.<ref>Lois N. Magner ''A history of the life sciences'', Marcel Dekker, 2002, ISBN 0-8247-0824-5, p. 185</ref> He did not initially accept the evidence for cell division, believing it only occurs in certain types of cells. When it dawned on him that Remak might be right, in 1855, he published Remak's work as his own, which caused a falling out between the two.<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00m5w92|publisher=BBC4|title=The Cell: Episode 1 The Hidden Kingdom|author=Rutherford, Dr. Adam|date=August 2009}}</ref> This work, Virchow encapsulated in the epigram ''Omnis cellula e cellula'' ("Every cell originates from another existing cell like it."), which he published in 1858. (The [[epigram]] was actually coined by [[François-Vincent Raspail]], but popularized by Virchow.)<ref name="pmid16810425">{{cite journal |author=Tan SY, Brown J |title=Rudolph Virchow (1821–1902): "pope of pathology" |journal=Singapore Med J |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=567–8 |year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16810425 |url=http://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4707/4707ms1.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> It is a rejection of the concept of spontaneous generation, which held that organisms could arise from nonliving matter. For example, maggots were believed to spontaneously appear in decaying meat; [[Francesco Redi]] carried out experiments which disproved this notion and coined the maxim ''[[Omne vivum ex ovo]]'' ("Every living thing comes from a living thing" — literally "from an egg"); Virchow (and his predecessors) extended this to state that the only source for a living cell was another living cell.

===Anatomy===
Another significant credit relates to the discovery, made approximately simultaneously by Virchow and [[Charles Emile Troisier]], that an enlarged left supraclavicular node is one of the earliest signs of gastrointestinal malignancy, commonly of the stomach, or less commonly, lung cancer. This has become known as [[Virchow's node]] and simultaneously [[Troisier's sign]].

===Thromboembolism===
Virchow is also known for elucidating the mechanism of pulmonary [[thromboembolism]], coining the term [[embolism]] and [[thrombosis]]. He noted that blood clots in the pulmonary artery originate first from venous thrombi, stating: "The detachment of larger or smaller fragments from the end of the softening thrombus which are carried along by the current of blood and driven into remote vessels. This gives rise to the very frequent process on which I have bestowed the name of Embolia". Having made these initial discoveries based on autopsies, he proceeded to put forward a scientific hypothesis; that pulmonary thrombi are transported from the veins of the leg and that the blood has the ability to carry such an object. He then proceeded to prove this hypothesis through well-designed experiments, repeated numerous times to consolidate evidence, and with meticulously detailed methodology. This work rebuked a claim made by the eminent French pathologist [[Jean Cruveilhier]] that [[phlebitis]] led to clot development and therefore coagulation was the main consequence of venous inflammation. This was a view held by many before Virchow's work. Related to this research, Virchow described the factors contributing to venous thrombosis, [[Virchow's triad]].<ref name="Bagot2008"/>

===Pathology===
Furthermore, Virchow founded the medical fields of [[cellular pathology]] and comparative pathology (comparison of diseases common to humans and animals). His very innovative work may be viewed as between that of [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Morgagni]], whose work Virchow studied, and that of [[Paul Ehrlich]], who studied at the Charité while Virchow was developing microscopic pathology there. One of Virchow's major contributions to German medical education was to encourage the use of microscopes by medical students, and he was known for constantly urging his students to "think microscopically".

===Autopsy===
Virchow also developed a standard method of [[autopsy]] procedure, named for him, and many of his techniques are still used today. He is also credited with inventing the liver probe, a device used to take the temp. of a dead body.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

===Anthropology and prehistory biology===
In 1869, Virchow founded the Society for Anthropology, [[Ethnology]] and [[Prehistory]] (''Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte'') which was very influential in coordinating and intensifying German archaeological research, and of which he was several times president. For his contributions in German archaeology, the [[Rudolf Virchow lecture]] is held annually in his honour. He made field trips to [[Asia Minor]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], and other places, sometimes in the company of [[Heinrich Schliemann]]. His 1879 journey to the site of [[Troy]] is described in ''Beiträge zur Landeskunde in Troas'' (“Contributions to the knowledge of the landscape in Troy,” 1879) and ''Alttrojanische Gräber und Schädel'' (“Old Trojan graves and skulls,” 1882).<ref name=americana/><ref>{{Cite Collier's|Virchow, Rudolf}}</ref>

In 1885, he launched a study of [[craniometry]], which gave surprising results contradictory to contemporary [[scientific racism|scientific racist]] theories on the "[[Aryan race]]", leading him to denounce the "[[Nordic race|Nordic]] mysticism" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in [[Karlsruhe]]. [[Josef Kollmann]] <!-- see [[:de:Josef Kollmann]] -->, a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be they German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a "mixture of various races", furthermore declaring the "results of craniology" led to "struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race" on others.<ref>Andrea Orsucci, "[http://www.cromohs.unifi.it/eng/index.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870–1914)], ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{it icon}}</ref>

==Political career==
[[File:Rudolf Virchow NLM4.jpg|thumb|left|Rudolf Virchow]]
More than a laboratory physician, Virchow was an impassioned advocate for social and political reform, stating:

<blockquote>Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale. Medicine, as a social science, as the science of human beings, has the obligation to point out problems and to attempt their theoretical solution: the politician, the practical anthropologist, must find the means for their actual solution... The physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor, and social problems fall to a large extent within their jurisdiction.</blockquote>

Virchow made himself known as a pronounced democrat in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in Germany|year of revolutions in Germany (1848)]]. Earlier the same year, the government-employed doctor Virchow was asked to investigate an epidemic of [[typhus]] in the poverty-stricken area of [[Upper Silesia]] by the Prussian government. His political views are evident in his ''Report on the Typhus Outbreak of Upper Silesia'' (1848), where he states the outbreak could not be solved by treating individual patients with drugs or with minor changes in food, housing, or clothing laws, but only through radical action to promote the advancement of an entire population, which could only be achieved by "full and unlimited democracy" and "education, [[:wikt:freedom|freedom]] and prosperity".<ref>{{cite journal

These radical statements and minor part in the revolution caused the government to remove him (1849) from his position, although within a year was reinstated as [[prosector]] 'on probation'. Prosector was a secondary position in the hospital. This secondary position in Berlin convinced him to accept the chair of pathological anatomy at the medical school in the provincial Würzburg, where he continued his scientific research. Six years later, he had attained fame at scientific and medical circles, and was reinstated at Charité Hospital.<ref name="Bagot2008">{{cite journal

In 1859, he became a member of the Municipal Council of Berlin and began his career as a civic reformer. Elected to the Prussian Diet in 1862, he became leader of the Radical or Progressive party; and from 1880 to 1893, he was a member of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]].<ref name=americana/> He worked to improve the health-care conditions for the Berlin citizens, namely working towards modern water and sewer systems. Virchow is credited as a founder of [[social medicine]], frequently focusing on the fact that disease is never purely biological, but often socially derived or spread,<ref>{{cite journal

===The Sausage Duel===

As a cofounder and member of the liberal party (''[[Deutsche Fortschrittspartei]]'') he was a leading political antagonist of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]. He was opposed to Bismarck’s excessive military budget, which angered Bismarck sufficiently to challenge Virchow to a duel in 1865.<ref name=americana>{{Cite Americana|Virchow, Rudolf|year=1920}}</ref> Of the two versions, one has Virchow declining because he considered dueling an uncivilized way to solve a conflict. The second has passed into legend, but was well documented in the contemporary scientific literature. It has Virchow, having been the challenged and therefore entitled to choose the weapons, selecting two pork sausages, a normal sausage and another one, loaded with ''[[Trichinella]]'' larvae. His challenger declined the proposition as too risky.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Schultz |first1=Myron |title=Rudolf Virchow |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=1480–1481 |journal=Emerg Infect Dis|doi=10.3201/eid1409.086672|pmc=2603088}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Isaac Asimov |title=Treasury of Humor (Mariner Books, 1991, ISBN 978-0-395-57226-9, Page 202)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Cardiff |first1=Robert D |last2=Ward |first2=Jerrold M |last3=Barthold |first3=Stephen W |doi=10.1038/labinvest.3700695|title='One medicine—one pathology': are veterinary and human pathology prepared? |volume=88 |pages=18–12 |journal=Laboratory Investigation |issue=1}}</ref>

One area where he co-operated with Bismarck was in the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', the anticlerical campaign against the Catholic Church,<ref name="Progs"> "This anti-Catholic crusade was also taken up by the Progressives, especially Rudolf Virchow, though Richter himself was tepid in his occasional support."

Virchow was respected in Masonic circles,<ref name="Virchowrespected">"Rizal's Berlin associates, or perhaps the word "patrons" would give their relation better, were men as esteemed in Masonry as they were eminent in the scientific world—Virchow, for example." in [[Jose Rizal|JOSE RIZAL]] AS A MASON by AUSTIN CRAIG, The Builder Magazine, [http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/the_builder_1916_august.htm August 1916 – Volume II – Number 8]</ref> and according to one source<ref name="VirchowMason">"It was a heady atmosphere for the young Brother, and Masons in Germany, Dr. Rudolf Virchow and Dr. [[Fedor Jagor]], were instrumental in his becoming a member of the Berlin Ethnological and Anthropological Societies."
