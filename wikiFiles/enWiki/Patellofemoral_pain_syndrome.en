'''Patellofemoral pain syndrome''' (PFPS) is a syndrome characterized by pain or discomfort seemingly originating from the contact of the posterior surface of the [[patella]] (back of the kneecap) with the [[femur]] (thigh bone). It is the most frequently encountered diagnosis in sports medicine clinics.

==Mechanism==
The cause of pain and dysfunction often results from either abnormal forces (e.g. increased pull of the lateral [[quadriceps]] retinaculum with acute or chronic lateral PF subluxation/dislocation) or prolonged repetitive compressive or shearing forces (running or jumping) on the PF joint. The result is thinning and softening ([[chondromalacia]]) of the articular cartilage under the patella and/or on the medial or lateral femoral condyles, synovial irritation and inflammation and subchondral bony changes in the distal femur or patella known as "bone bruises". Secondary causes of PF Syndrome are fractures, internal knee derangement, [[Osteoarthritis|OA]] of the knee and bony tumors in or around the knee.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Special tests in the clinical examination of patellofemoral syndrome | journal = Doctors Lounge | date = 12 Aug 2009 | first = Tom | last = Plamondon | url = http://www.doctorslounge.com/index.php/articles/page/287 | accessdate = 2012-08-20}}</ref>

Specific populations at high risk of primary Patellofemoral Syndrome include runners, bicyclists, basketball players, young athletes and females. Typically patients will complain of localized anterior knee pain which is exacerbated by sports, walking, stair climbing, or sitting for a long time, often called the "Theater Sign" or "Movie-Goers Sign."<ref>http://www.healthhype.com/knee-cap-pain-causes-and-treatment.html</ref> The pain from prolonged sitting is thought to occur because of the constant pull of the quadriceps muscle on the knee cap while sitting, which causes its impaction against the hard and unyielding surfaces of the bones of knee joint. Descending stairs may be worse than ascending. Unless there is an underlying pathology in the knee, swelling is usually mild to nil. Palpation, as well, is usually unremarkable.

==Differential diagnosis==
The diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome is made by ruling out [[patellar tendinitis]], [[prepatellar bursitis]], [[plica syndrome]], [[Sinding–Larsen–Johansson syndrome]], and [[Osgood–Schlatter disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Prins | first1 = Maarte | last2 = Van der Wurff | first2 = Peter |title = Females with patellofemoral pain syndrome have weak hip muscles: a systematic review. | journal = Aust J Physiother 55.1 (2009): 9-15. | accessdate = 2013-02-04}}</ref>

==Treatment==

Clinicians have traditionally used a variety of treatments for patellofemoral pain syndrome, many of which have little supporting evidence.<ref name="Bolgla">{{cite journal |last1=Bolgla |first1=Lori |last2=Boling |first2=Michelle |title=An update for the conservative management of patellofemoral pain syndrome: a systematic review of the literature from 2000 to 2010. |journal=International journal of sports physical therapy 6.2 (2011): 112. |accessdate=Feb 4 2013}}</ref> Most patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome respond well to conservative therapy.<ref name="Bolgla" />

=== Exercises===
A 2011 systematic review stated that evidence supports the use of [[quadriceps]] exercise for managing patellofemoral pain syndrome and that quadriceps strengthening is considered to be the "gold" standard treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome.<ref name="Bolgla" /> Quadriceps strengthening is commonly suggested because the quadriceps muscles help to stabilize the patella. Quadriceps weakness and quadriceps muscle imbalance may contribute to abnormal patellar tracking.<ref name="Bolgla" /> Moderate evidence supports the addition of hip abductor and external rotator strengthening, as well as exercises targeting hip flexion and hip extension.<ref name ="Bolgla" />  When executing these exercises, proper form is very important in order to ensure that the musculature is activated in such a way that will not lead to further injury.  Inflexibility has often been cited as a source of patellofemoral pain syndrome.  Stretching of the [[hip]], [[hamstring]], [[calf (anatomy)|calf]], and [[iliotibial band]] may help restore proper [[biomechanics]].<ref name="Thomee">{{cite journal| author=Thomeé R, Renström P, Karlsson J, Grimby G| title=Patellofemoral pain syndrome in young women.

=== Rest ===
Patellofemoral pain syndrome may also result from overuse or overload of the PF joint.  For this reason, knee activity should be reduced until the pain is resolved.<ref name="Thomee" /><ref name="Tria" />  Those with pain originating from sitting too long should straighten the leg or walk periodically.  Those who engage in high impact activity such as running should consider a nonimpact activity such as [[human swimming|swimming]] or aerobics on an [[elliptical machine]].

=== Ice and medication ===
To reduce inflammation, ice can be applied to the PF joint after an activity.  The ice should be kept in place for 10 to 15 minutes.  Additionally anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs can also be taken immediately after an activity or judicious use during daily activities and for those people whose symptoms aren’t controlled with ice.

=== Orthosis and taping ===
In addition to physical therapy, external devices such as patellofemoral knee orthosis and tape could be used to stabilize the knee.  These orthoses will not correct the underlying source but may prevent further injury.  For this reason, they should be used in conjunction with and not in lieu of physical therapy.  The technique of McConnell taping involves pulling the patella medially with tape (medial glide). The underlying goal of taping is multifaceted and intended to correct the position of the patella, increase vastus medialis oblique activation, and stretch the tight lateral structures of the patella leading to pain reduction and facilitating strengthening exercises of the quadriceps.  Studies have shown that patella taping may reduce pain and potentially increase the activity of the VMO,  however the underlying mechanisms of taping are not clearly understood.<ref name="pmid8231783">{{cite journal| author=Bockrath K, Wooden C, Worrell T, Ingersoll CD, Farr J| title=Effects of patella taping on patella position and perceived pain. | journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc | year= 1993 | volume= 25 | issue= 9 | pages= 989–92 | pmid=8231783 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=8231783  }}</ref><ref name="pmid9402564">{{cite journal| author=Powers CM, Landel R, Sosnick T, Kirby J, Mengel K, Cheney A et al.| title=The effects of patellar taping on stride characteristics and joint motion in subjects with patellofemoral pain. | journal=J Orthop Sports Phys Ther | year= 1997 | volume= 26 | issue= 6 | pages= 286–91 | pmid=9402564 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=9402564  }}</ref> Findings from some studies suggest that there is limited benefit with patella taping or bracing when compared to quadriceps exercises alone.<ref name="Bolgla" />

=== Arch support ===
Low arches can cause overpronation or the feet to roll inward too much increasing the [[Q angle]] and [[genu valgus]].  Poor lower extremity biomechanics may cause stress on the knees and ultimately patellofemoral pain syndrome.  Stability or motion control shoes are designed for people with pronation issues.  Arch supports and custom orthotics may also help to improve lower extremity biomechanics.<ref name="pmid1897659">{{cite journal| author=Gross ML, Davlin LB, Evanski PM| title=Effectiveness of orthotic shoe inserts in the long-distance runner. | journal=Am J Sports Med | year= 1991 | volume= 19 | issue= 4 | pages= 409–12 | pmid=1897659 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=1897659  }}</ref><ref name="pmid8421719">{{cite journal| author=Eng JJ, Pierrynowski MR| title=Evaluation of soft foot orthotics in the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome. | journal=Phys Ther | year= 1993 | volume= 73 | issue= 2 | pages= 62-8; discussion 68-70 | pmid=8421719 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=8421719  }}</ref>
