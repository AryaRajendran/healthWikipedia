'''Hepatitis E''' is a viral [[hepatitis]] (liver inflammation) caused by [[infection]] with a [[virus]] called [[hepatitis E virus]] ('''HEV'''). HEV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA icosahedral virus with a 7.5 kilobase genome. HEV has a fecal-oral transmission route.  It is one of five known [[hepatitis]] viruses: [[hepatitis A|A]], [[hepatitis B|B]], [[hepatitis C|C]], [[hepatitis D|D]], and E. Infection with this virus was first documented in 1955 during an outbreak in [[New Delhi]], India.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gupta DN, Smetana HF |title=The histopathology of viral hepatitis as seen in the Delhi epidemic (1955–56) |journal=Indian J. Med. Res. |volume=45 |issue=Suppl. |pages=101–13 |year=1957 |pmid=13438544 }}</ref>  A [[Prophylaxis#Prophylaxis|preventative vaccine]] (HEV 239) is approved for use in China.

==Molecular biology==

Although it was originally classified in the [[Caliciviridae]] family, the virus has since been classified into the genus [[Hepevirus]], but was not assigned to a viral family. The virus itself is a small non-enveloped particle.

The genome is approximately 7200 bases in length, is a polyadenylated single-strand RNA molecule that contains three discontinuous and partially overlapping [[open reading frame]]s (ORFs) along with 5' and 3' [[cis-acting]] elements, which have important roles in HEV replication and transcription. ORF1 encode a [[methyltransferase]], [[protease]], [[helicase]] and [[replicase]]; ORF2 encode the [[capsid]] [[protein]] and ORF3 encodes a protein of undefined function.  A three-dimensional, atomic-resolution structure of the capsid protein in the context of a virus-like particle has been described.<ref name="pmid19622744">{{cite journal

As of 2009 there are approximately 1,600 sequences of both human and animal isolates of HEV available in [[Genbank|open-access sequence databases]].

Species of this genus infect humans, pigs, boars, deer, rats, rabbits and birds.<ref name=Purdy2010>{{cite journal | author = Purdy MA, Khudyakov YE | year = 2010 | title = Evolutionary history and population dynamics of hepatitis E virus | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 12| page = e14376 }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==

===Classification===

There is only one serotype of the virus and classification is based on the nucleotide sequences of the genome.<ref name=Lu2006>{{cite journal | author = Lu L, Li C, Hagedorn CH | year = 2006 | title = Phylogenetic analysis of global hepatitis E virus sequences: genetic diversity, subtypes and zoonosis | url = | journal = Rev Med Virol | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 5–36 }}</ref> Genotype 1 has been classified into five subtypes. The number of genotype 2 can be classified into two subtypes. Genotypes 3 and 4 have been into ten and seven subtypes respectively.

===Distribution===

Genotype 1 has been isolated from tropical and several subtropical countries in Asia and Africa. Genotype 2 has been isolated from Mexico, Nigeria, and Chad. Genotype 3 has been isolated almost worldwide including Asia, Europe, Oceania, North and South America. Genotype 4 appears to be limited exclusively to Asia.

Genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to humans and often associated with large outbreaks and epidemics in developing countries with poor sanitation conditions. Genotypes 3 and 4 infect humans, pigs and other animal species and have been responsible for sporadic cases of hepatitis E in both developing and industrialized countries.

===Clinical features===

The incidence of hepatitis E is highest in juveniles and adults between the ages of 15 and 40. Though children often contract this infection as well, they less frequently become symptomatic. Mortality rates are generally low, for hepatitis E is a "self-limiting" disease, in that it usually goes away by itself and the patient recovers. However, during the duration of the [[infection]] (usually several weeks), the disease severely impairs a person’s ability to work, care for family members, and obtain food. Hepatitis E occasionally develops into an acute, severe [[liver]] disease, and is fatal in about 2% of all cases. [[Medicine|Clinically]], it is comparable to [[hepatitis A]], but in pregnant women the disease is more often severe and is associated with a clinical syndrome called [[fulminant hepatic failure]]. Pregnant women, especially those in the third trimester, suffer an elevated [[mortality rate]] from the disease of around 20%.<ref name="World Health Organization">{{cite web|last=WHO|title=Global Alert and Response (GAR); Hepatitis E|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsredc200112/en/index1.html|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref>

Differences have been noted between the different genotypes. For genotype 1, the age at which incidence peaks is between 15 and 35 years and mortality is about 1%. Genotype 3 and 4 — the most common in Japan — are more common in people older than 60 years and the mortality is between 5 and 10%.<ref name="Miyahara2010">{{cite journal |author=Miyahara K, Miyake Y, Yasunaka T, ''et al.'' |title=Acute hepatitis due to hepatitis E virus genotype 1 as an imported infectious disease in Japan |journal=Intern. Med. |volume=49 |issue=23 |pages=2613–6 |year=2010 |pmid=21139302 |url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/internalmedicine/49.4221?from=PubMed}}</ref>  Although [[prednisolone]] has been used in the treatment of this condition, because large scale studies have not yet been reported, the role of this drug in treatment is not yet clear.

;Chronic infections

In immunocompromised subjects - particularly in solid organ transplanted patients - Hepatitis E may cause a chronic infection.<ref name=Bonnet2012>{{cite pmid|22405325}}</ref> Occasionally this  may cause liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The use of low dose [[ribavirin]] (600 to 800 milligrams / day) over a three month period has been associated with viral clearance in such cases.

===Transmission===
Hepatitis E is prevalent in most [[developing countries]], and common in any country with a hot climate. It is widespread in Southeast Asia, northern and central Africa, India, and Central America. It is spread mainly through [[feces|fecal contamination]] of water supplies or food; person-to-person transmission is uncommon.

The '''incubation period''' following exposure to the hepatitis E virus ranges from three to eight weeks, with a mean of 40 days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hepatitis E Fact sheet|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/}}</ref>
Outbreaks of epidemic hepatitis E most commonly occur after heavy rainfalls and [[monsoons]] because of their disruption of water supplies. Major outbreaks have occurred in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] (30,000 cases in 1955-1956), [[Burma]] (20,000 cases in 1976-1977), [[Kashmir]], [[India]] (52,000 cases in 1978), [[Kanpur]], [[India]] (79,000 cases in 1991), and [[China]] (100,000 cases between 1986 and 1988).

===Animals as a reservoir===
Domestic animals have been reported as a reservoir for the hepatitis E virus, with some surveys showing infection rates exceeding 95% among domestic pigs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Satou K, Nishiura H |title=Transmission Dynamics of Hepatitis E Among Swine: Potential Impact upon Human Infection |journal=BMC Vet. Res. |volume=3|pages=9 |year=2007 |pmid=17493260 |doi=10.1186/1746-6148-3-9 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/3/9 |pmc=1885244}}</ref>
Replicative virus has been found in the [[small intestine]], [[lymph node]]s, [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and [[liver]] of experimentally infected [[pig]]s. Transmission after consumption of [[wild boar]] meat and uncooked deer meat has been reported as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li TC, Chijiwa K, Sera N, ''et al.'' |title=Hepatitis E Virus Transmission from Wild Boar Meat |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=11 |issue=12 |pages=1958–60 |year=2005 |pmid=16485490 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no12/05-1041.htm |doi=10.3201/eid1112.051041 |pmc=3367655}}</ref>  The rate of transmission to humans by this route and the public health importance of this are, however, still unclear.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kuniholm MH &amp; Nelson KE|title=Of Organ Meats and Hepatitis E Virus: One Part of a Larger Puzzle Is Solved|journal=J Infect Dis|year=2008|volume=198|issue=12|pages=1727–1728|doi=10.1086/593212|pmid=18983247}}</ref>

A number of other small mammals have been identified as potential  reservoirs: the lesser bandicoot rat (''[[Bandicota bengalensis]]''), the black rat (''[[Rattus rattus|Rattus rattus brunneusculus]]'') and the Asian house shrew (''[[Suncus murinus]]'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Wild Rats and Disease|url=http://www.ratbehavior.org/WildRatDisease.htm}}</ref>  A new virus designated '''rat hepatitis E virus''' has been isolated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johne R, Plenge-Bönig A, Hess M, Ulrich RG, Reetz J, Schielke A |title=Detection of a novel hepatitis E-like virus in faeces of wild rats using a nested broad-spectrum RT-PCR |journal=J. Gen. Virol. |volume=91 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=750–8 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=19889929 |doi=10.1099/vir.0.016584-0 |url=http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19889929}}</ref>

A rabbit hepatitis E virus has also been described.<ref name=Cheng2012>Cheng X, Wang S, Dai X, Shi C, Wen Y, Zhu M, Zhan S, Meng J (2012) Rabbit as a novel animal model for hepatitis e virus infection and vaccine evaluation. PLoS One 7(12):e51616. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0051616 </ref>

An avian virus has been described that is associated with hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome in [[chicken]]s. This virus is genetically and antigenically related to mammalian HEV, and probably represents a new genus in the family.

===Recent outbreaks===
In 2004, there were two major outbreaks, both of them in sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]]. There was an outbreak in [[Chad]] in which, as of September 27, there were 1,442 reported cases and 46 deaths. The second was in [[Sudan]] with, as of September 28, 6,861 cases and 87 deaths.  Increasingly, hepatitis E is being seen in developed nations, with reports of cases in the UK, US and Japan. The disease is thought to be a zoonosis in that animals are thought to be the source. Both deer and swine have been implicated.

In October 2007, an epidemic of hepatitis E was suspected in Kitgum District of northern Uganda where no previous epidemics had been documented. This outbreak has progressed to become one of the largest hepatitis E outbreaks in the world. By June 2009, the epidemic had caused illness in >10,196 persons and 160 deaths.<ref>{{cite web|last=Center for Disease Control|title=Hepatitis E Epidemic, Uganda|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/16/1/09-0764_article.htm}}</ref>

In 2011, a minor outbreak was reported in Tangail, a neighborhood of Dhaka, Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nurul Islam Hasib |title=Hepatitis E sounds alarm |work=bdnews24.com |date=June 14, 2011 |url=http://bdnews24.com/details.php?cid=13&id=198367 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref>

In June 2012, an outbreak was reported in city of [[Ichalkaranji]], Maharashtra, India.  As of June 14, 2012,  3232 cases were reported and 18 died.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://india.nydailynews.com/newsarticle/4fe1e6dbb1e35ded25000000/18-killed-in-hepatitis-e-outbreak-in-maharashtra |title=18 killed in hepatitis E outbreak in Maharashtra |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref>
and 3 died in Shirol taluka of Kolhapur Maharashtra, India in June 2012. Officials in the Indian state of Maharashtra India suspect that contaminated water from the Panchganga river was responsible for the hepatitis E outbreak in  Ichalkaranji.

In July 2012, an outbreak was reported in South Sudanese refugee camps in [[Maban County]] near the [[Sudan]] border. [[South Sudan]]'s Ministry of Health reported over 400 cases and 16 fatalities as of September 13, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hereward Holland |title=Hepatitis outbreak kills 16 in South Sudan refugee camps |date=September 13, 2012 |url=http://news.yahoo.com/hepatitis-outbreak-kills-16-south-sudan-refugee-camps-213224070.html |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref> Progressing further, as of February 2, 2013, 88 have died due to the outbreak.  The "Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it had treated almost 4,000 patients."  <ref>{{cite news |author=Hereward Holland |title=Hepatitis outbreak kills 88 in South Sudan - aid agency |date=February 2, 2013 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/02/uk-southsudan-hepatitis-idUKBRE91108420130202 |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref>

==Population genetics==

The most recent common ancestor of Hepatitis E evolved between 536 and 1344 years ago.<ref name="Purdy2010"/> It diverged into two clades - an anthropotropic and an enzootic form - which subsequently evolved into genotypes 1 and 2 and genotypes 3 and 4 respectively. The divergence dates for the various genotypes are as follows: Genotypes 1/2 367 – 656 years ago; Genotypes 3/4 417 – 679 years ago. For the most recent common acestor of the various viruses themselves: Genotype 1 between 87 and 199 years ago; Genotype 3 between 265 and 342 years ago; and Genotype 4 between 131 and 266 years ago. The anthropotropic strains (genotype 1 and 2) have evolved more recently than the others suggesting that this virus was originally a zooenosis.

The use of an avian strain confirmed the proposed topology of the genotypes 1-4 and suggested that the genus may have evolved {{ma|1.36}} (range {{ma|0.23}} to {{ma|2.6}}).<ref name="Purdy2010"/> The use of a rat sequence also confirmed this topology and estimated date of divergence from the swine/human strains was 7.44×10<sup>4</sup> years ago (range 2.1×10<sup>4</sup> to 1.4×10<sup>5</sup> years ago) Since this date is approximately coincident with the advent of agriculture it may be that this virus originally infected rats and subsequently spread to pigs and then to humans. Additional work is required to support or refute this possibility as very few sequences have been isolated from species other than humans and suids.

Genotypes 1,3 and 4 all increased their effective population sizes in the 20th century.<ref name="Purdy2010"/> The population size of genotype 1 increaded noticeably in the last 30–35 years. Genotypes 3 and 4 population sizes began to increase in the late 19th century up to 1940-1945. Genotype 3 underwent a subsequent increase in population size until the 1960s. Since 1990 both genotypes' population sizes have been reduced back to levels last seen in the 19th century.

The overall mutation rate for the genome has been estimated at ~1.4 x 10<sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year.<ref name="Purdy2010"/>

==Prevention==
Improving [[sanitation]] is the most important measure, which consists of proper treatment and disposal of human waste, higher standards for public water supplies, improved personal hygiene procedures and sanitary food preparation. Thus, prevention strategies of this disease are similar to those of many others that plague developing nations, and they require large-scale international financing of water supply and water treatment projects.
A vaccine based on recombinant viral proteins has been developed and recently tested in a high-risk population (military personnel of a developing country).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shrestha MP, Scott RM, Joshi DM, ''et al.'' |title=Safety and efficacy of a recombinant hepatitis E vaccine |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=356 |issue=9 |pages=895–903 |year=2007 |pmid=17329696 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa061847}}</ref> The vaccine appeared to be effective and safe, but development stopped for economical reasons, since hepatitis E is rare in developed countries.<ref name='10.1038/491021a'/>

A different vaccine (HEV 239, sold as Hecolin by its developer Xiamen Innovax Biotech) was approved for the disease in 2012 by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, following a phase 3 trial on two groups of 50,000 people each from Jiangsu Province where none of the vaccinated became infected during a 12 month period, compared to 15 in the group given placebo treatment.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/nbt0412-300a}}</ref> The first vaccine batches came out of Innovax' factory in late October 2012, and will be sold to Chinese distributors.<ref name='10.1038/491021a'>{{cite doi|10.1038/491021a}}</ref>

==Impact==
The hepatitis E virus causes around 20 million infections a year. These result in around three million acute illnesses and 70,000 deaths annually. It is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, who can develop an acute form of the disease that is lethal
in 20 per cent of cases. The virus (HEV) is a major cause of illness and of death in the developing world  and disproportionate cause of deaths among pregnant women.  Although HEV vaccine trials, including trials conducted in populations in southern Asia, have shown candidate vaccines to be effective and well-tolerated, these vaccines have not yet been produced or made available to susceptible populations. The exception is China. After more than a year of scrutiny and inspection by  China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), a hepatitis E vaccine developed by Chinese scientists will be available by the end of 2012. There is no licensed hepatitis E vaccine for use in the US.
