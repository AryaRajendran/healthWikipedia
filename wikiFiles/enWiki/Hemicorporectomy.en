In [[medicine]] ([[surgery]]), '''hemicorporectomy''' (also named '''translumbar amputation''' and "'''halfectomy'''") is a [[radical surgery]] in which the body below the [[waist]] is amputated, transecting the [[lumbar spine]]. This removes the [[leg]]s, the [[genitalia]] (internal and external), [[urinary system]], [[Pelvis|pelvic]] bones, [[anus]], and [[rectum]].<ref name=Ferrara>{{cite journal|first=Bernard E.|last=Ferrara|year=1990|month=December|title=Hemicorporectomy: A Collective Review|journal=Journal of Surgical Oncology|volume=45|issue=4|pages=270–278|pmid=2250478|doi=10.1002/jso.2930450412}}</ref><ref name=Shields>{{cite journal|first=Richard K.|last=Shields|coauthors=Dudley-Javoroski, Shauna|year=2003|month=March|title=Musculoskeletal Deterioration and Hemicorporectomy After Spinal Cord Injury|journal=Physical Therapy|volume=83|issue=3|pages=263–275|pmid=12620090|url=http://www.ptjournal.org/PTJournal/Mar2003/v83n3p263.cfm|format= &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AShields+intitle%3AMusculoskeletal+Deterioration+and+Hemicorporectomy+After+Spinal+Cord+Injury&as_publication=Physical+Therapy&as_ylo=2003&as_yhi=2003&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}} {{dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref> It is a severely mutilating procedure recommended only as a last resort for patients with severe and potentially fatal illnesses such as [[osteomyelitis]], [[tumor]]s, severe [[Physical trauma|trauma]]s and intractable [[decubiti]] in, or around, the [[pelvis]].<ref name=Deckert>{{cite journal|first=Tracy L.|last=Porter-Romatowski|coauthors=Deckert, M.

The nomenclature is somewhat at odds with generally accepted anatomical terms, as ''hemi'' is generally used to refer to one of two sides (e.g., [[hemiplegia]], which affects the arm and leg on one side of the body). In that sense, ''paracorporectomy'' might more closely reflect the nature of the procedure.

==History==
The development of [[Surgery|surgical medicine]] was vastly accelerated during, and following, the [[Second World War]]. Rarely experienced traumas were made more common by new weaponry. This required decisive surgical action as well as the development of new techniques. As B. E. Ferrara stated in his summative article on hemicorporectomy,

<blockquote>Lessons learned from battle field injuries quickened innovative treatment of congenital and acquired conditions... [the general surgeon] devised extensive cancer operations including extended radical [[mastectomy]], radical [[gastrectomy]] and [[pancreatectomy]], [[pelvic exenteration]], the '[[Commando Operation]]' (tongue, jaw and neck dissection), bilateral back dissection, [[hemipelvectomy]], and then hemicorporectomy or translumbar amputation, referred to as the most revolutionary of all operative procedures.<ref name="Ferrara"/></blockquote>

It was into this environment that Frederick E. Kredel first proposed the operation in February 1951 while discussing a paper on pelvic exenteration.<ref name="Ferrara"/> The first hemicorporectomy was attempted by Charles S. Kennedy in 1960, but the patient died eleven days later. J. Bradley Aust and Karel B. Absolon conducted the first successful hemicorporectomy in [[Minnesota]] in 1961.

==Indications==
The operation is most often performed to treat spreading cancers of the spinal cord and pelvic bones. Other reasons may include [[Physical trauma|trauma]] affecting the pelvic girdle ("open-book fracture"), uncontrollable [[abscess]] or [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]s of the pelvic region (causing [[sepsis]]) or other locally uncontainable conditions.<ref name=Shields/>  It is used in cases wherein even [[pelvic exenteration]] would not remove sufficient tissue.

==Procedure==
The surgical procedure is often done in two stages, but it is possible to conduct the surgery in one stage. The first stage is the discontinuation of the waste functions in [[colostomy]] (rectum) and [[ileal conduit]] ([[urinary bladder|bladder]]). The second stage is the amputation.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Considerations==
With the removal of almost half of the circulatory system, [[cardiac]] function needs to be closely monitored while a new [[blood pressure]] set-point develops.

Removal of large parts of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] can lead to loss of [[electrolyte]]s. Similarly, calculated measurements of [[renal function]] (such as the Cockroft-Gault formula) are unlikely to reflect actual activity of the [[kidney]], as these calculations were developed for patients in whom the circulatory system correlates with the body weight; this relation is lost in a post-hemicorporectomy patient.

==Rehabilitation==
Extensive [[physiotherapy]] and [[occupational therapy]] are necessary for a patient to return to some form of normal life, which invariably involves using a [[wheelchair]]. Designing a [[prosthesis]] for the removed body parts is difficult, as there is generally no remaining pelvic girdle musculature (unless this has been spared expressly).

==Traumatic hemicorporectomy==
Many [[emergency room]]s have protocols under which they will not resuscitate or support a patient who has already undergone a severe bisection injury that is essentially a ''[[de facto]]'' hemicorporectomy. This stance is largely due to very limited rates of survival. A study which reviewed 267 cases of severe blunt and penetrating trauma patients ([[decapitation]], hemicorporectomy, etc.) who had cardiopulmonary arrest found that only 7 survived long term, only four of whom returned to their previous neurologic level.<ref name=Shimazu>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Shimazu|coauthors=Shatney, C. H.|year=1983|month=March|title=Outcomes of trauma patients with no vital signs on hospital admission|journal=Journal of Trauma|volume=23|issue=3|pages=213–216|pmid=6834443|doi=10.1097/00005373-198303000-00006}}</ref> Apart from the overwhelming statistical unlikelihood of survival, operative hemicorporectomy is unlikely to be successful unless the patient has the "sufficient emotional and psychological maturity to cope" and "sufficient determination and physical strength to undergo the intensive rehabilitation".<ref name=Terz>{{cite journal|first=J.

Emergency rooms and ambulance services often release policy which advise against the resuscitation of such patients. The UK's [[National Health Service]], for example, in its "Policy and Procedures for the Recognition of Life Extinct" describes traumatic hemicorporectomy as "unequivocally associated with death" and that such injuries should be considered "incompatible with life".<ref name=NHS>{{cite book|author=Avon Ambulance Service NHS Trust|title=Policy and procedures for the recognition of life extinct| url=http://www.avonamb.nhs.uk/NR/rdonlyres/6E805679-6C19-46D0-8689-7BE699EAEB93/0/MD216Jan2005.pdf| chapter=3.

In one case documented in 1989, a woman who sustained a complete corporal transection (Hemicorporectomy) arrived at a hospital in a "fully conscious" state and who "was aware of the nature of her injury and wished for further treatment." Although the patient was initially stablized and underwent three hours of emergency surgery, she died approximately two hours later due to "hypovolaemia, cardiac arrythmia and biochemical imbalance."<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1285562/pdf/archemed00021-0074.pdf Traumatic hemisomato-tmesis: a case report and review of the literature], S. J. Walker, R. H. Johnson,

==Prosthesis==

Following a hemicorporectomy, patients are fitted with a socket-type prosthesis often referred to as a bucket. Early bucket designs often presented significant pressure problems for patients, but new devices have incorporated an inflatable rubber lining composed of air pockets that evenly distributes pressure based on the patient's motions. Two openings at the front of the bucket create space for the [[colostomy bag]] and the [[ileal conduit]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
