'''Focal neurologic signs''' also known as focal neurological deficits or focal CNS signs are impairments of [[Central nervous system|nerve]], [[spinal cord]], or [[Human brain|brain]] function that affects a specific region of the body, e.g. weakness in the left arm, the right leg, [[paresis]], or [[plegia]].

Focal neurological deficits may be caused by a variety of medical conditions such as [[head trauma]],<ref>Thiruppathy SP, Muthukumar N.Acta Mild head injury: revisited. Neurochir (Wien). 2004 Oct;146(10):1075-82; discussion 1082-3. PMID 15744844</ref> [[tumor]]s or [[stroke]]; or by various diseases such as [[meningitis]] or [[encephalitis]] or as a side effect of certain medications such as those used in anasthesia.<ref>Thal GD, Szabo MD, Lopez-Bresnahan M, Crosby G.

==Frontal lobe signs==
[[Frontal lobe]] signs usually involve the motor system, and may include many special types of deficit, depending on which part of the frontal lobe is affected:
* unsteadiness in walking
* muscular rigidity, resistance to passive movements of the limbs ([[hypertonia]])
* paralysis of a limb ([[monoplegia|monoparesis]]) or a larger area on one side of the body ([[hemiparesis]])
* paralysis head and eye movements
* inability to express oneself linguistically, described as an [[expressive aphasia]] (Broca's aphasia)
* [[focal seizure]]s which can spread to adjacent areas ([[Jacksonian seizure]])
* grand mal or [[Seizure types|tonic-clonic]] seizures
* changes in personality such as disinhibition, inappropriate jocularity, rage without provocation; or loss of initiative and concern, apathy, [[akinetic mutism]], general retardation
* [[frontal release sign|"frontal release" sign]]s, i.e. reappearance of primitive reflexes such as the [[snout reflex]], the grasp reflex, and the palmar-mental reflex
* unilateral loss of smell (anosmia)

==Parietal lobe signs==
[[Parietal lobe]] signs usually involve somatic sensation, and may include:
* impairment of tactile sensation
* impairment of [[proprioception]], i.e. postural sensation and sensation of passive movement
* sensory and visual [[hemispatial neglect|neglect]] syndromes, i.e. inability to pay attention to things in certain parts of the person's sensory or spatial environment. This can be as extreme as denial of a limb. 
* loss of ability to read, write or calculate ([[dyslexia]], [[dysgraphia]], [[dyscalculia]])
* loss of ability to find a defined place (geographical [[agnosia]])
* loss of ability to identify objects based on touch ([[agnosia|astereognosia.]])

==Temporal lobe signs==
[[Temporal lobe]] signs usually involve auditory sensation and memory, and may include:
* deafness without damage to the structures of the ear, described as [[cortical deafness]]
* [[tinnitus]], auditory hallucinations
* loss of ability to comprehend music or language, described as a [[receptive aphasia|sensory aphasia]] (Wernicke's aphasia)
* [[amnesia]], memory loss (affecting either long- or short-term memory or both)
* other memory disturbances such as [[déjà vu]]
* complex, multimodal hallucinations
* [[Seizure types|complex partial seizures]] (temporal lobe epilepsy)

==Occipital lobe signs==
[[Occipital lobe]] signs usually involve visual sensation, and may include:
* total loss of vision ([[cortical blindness]])
* loss of vision with denial of the loss ([[Anton's syndrome]])
* loss of vision on one side of the visual field of both eyes ([[homonymous hemianopsia]]) 
* [[visual agnosia]]s, i.e. inability to recognize familiar objects, colors, or [[prosopagnosia|faces]]
* visual illusions such as micropsia (objects appear smaller) and macropsia (objects appear larger)
* visual [[hallucination]]s, displaying elementary forms, such as zig-zags and flashes, in one half of the visual field only for each eye. (In contrast, temporal lobe visual hallucinations display complex forms, and fill the entire visual field.)

==Limbic Signs==
Damage to the [[Limbic System]] involves loss or damage to memory, and may include:
* Loss or confusion of long-term memory prior to focal neuropathy ([[Retrograde amnesia]])
* Inability to form new memories ([[Anterograde amnesia]])
* Loss of, or reduced emotions ([[Apathy]]).
* Loss of olfactory functions.
* Loss of decision making ability.

==Cerebellar signs==
[[Cerebellum|Cerebellar]] signs usually involve balance and coordination, and may include:
* unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs or torso ([[ataxia]])
* inability to coordinate fine motor activities ([[intention tremor]]), e.g. "past-pointing" (pointing beyond the finger in the finger-nose test)
* inability to perform rapid alternating movements ([[dysdiadochokinesis]]), e.g. inability to rapidly flip the hands
* involuntary left-right eye movements ([[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]])

==Brainstem signs==
[[Brainstem]] signs can involve a host of specific sensory and motor abnormalities, depending on which fiber tracts and [[cranial nerve nuclei]] are affected.

==Spinal cord signs==
[[Spinal cord]] signs generally involve unilateral paralysis with contralateral loss of pain sensation
