Some associate obesity with anyone who is overweight, which is not necessarily true. Obesity is characterized by body mass which exceeds a certain percentage. The doctor measures the body mass with the [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]],meaning that a person’s weight in kilograms (kg) is divided by the person’s height in meters (m) squared to equal the percentage range in which one's BMI should fall. Patients that are over the 30th percentile are considered obese. Other measurements of fat distribution include the [[waist–hip ratio]] and [[body fat percentage]]. Normal weight obesity is a condition of having normal body weight, but high body fat percentages and poses the same health risks as obesity.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2008-rst/4738.html Normal Weight Obesity: An Emerging Risk Factor for Heart and Metabolic Problems].

BMI is calculated by dividing the subject's mass by the square of his or her height, typically expressed either in [[Metric system|metric]] or [[US customary units|US "Customary"]] units:

:Metric:  <math>\mathrm{BMI}=\frac{\mathrm{kilograms}}{\mathrm{meters}^2}</math>

:US/Customary and [[Imperial System|imperial]]: <math>\mathrm{BMI}=\mathrm{pounds}\frac{703}{\mathrm{inches}^2}</math>

The most commonly used definitions, established by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1997 and published in 2000, provide the values listed in the table at right.<ref>WHO 2000 p.9</ref>

Some modifications to the WHO definitions have been made by particular bodies. The surgical literature breaks down class III obesity into further categories, though the exact values are still disputed.<ref name=morbid2007>{{cite journal |author=Sturm R |title=Increases in morbid obesity in the USA: 2000–2005 |journal=Public Health |volume=121 |issue=7 |pages=492–6 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17399752 |pmc=2864630 |doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2007.01.006 |url=}}</ref>

*Any BMI ≥ 35 or 40 is ''severe obesity''
*A BMI of ≥ 35 or 40–44.9 or 49.9 is ''morbid obesity''
*A BMI of ≥ 45 or 50 is ''super obese''

As Asian populations develop negative health consequences at a lower BMI than Caucasians, some nations have redefined obesity. The Japanese have defined obesity as any BMI greater than 25<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kanazawa M, Yoshiike N, Osaka T, Numba Y, Zimmet P, Inoue S |title=Criteria and classification of obesity in Japan and Asia-Oceania |journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr |volume=11 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=S732–S737 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12534701 |doi= 10.1046/j.1440-6047.11.s8.19.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0964-7058&date=2002&volume=11&issue=&spage=S732}}</ref> while [[China]] uses a BMI of greater than 28.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bei-Fan Z |author2=Cooperative Meta-Analysis Group of Working Group on Obesity in China |title=Predictive values of body mass index and waist circumference for risk factors of certain related diseases in Chinese adults: study on optimal cut-off points of body mass index and waist circumference in Chinese adults |journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr |volume=11 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=S685–93 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12534691 |doi= 10.1046/j.1440-6047.11.s8.9.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0964-7058&date=2002&volume=11&issue=&spage=S685}}</ref>

The BMI-based definition is easy to use and it is particularly convenient for statistical purposes, since it only depends on two commonly measured quantities, one's height and weight. However, it ignores variations between individuals in amounts of lean body mass, particularly [[muscle]] mass. Individuals involved in heavy physical labor or sports may have high BMI values despite having little fat. For example, more than half of all [[NFL]] players are classified as "obese" (BMI ≥ 30), and 1 in 4 are classified as "extremely obese" (BMI ≥ 35), according to the BMI metric.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20050301/many-nfl-players-fatter-than-couch-potatoes|title=Many NFL Players Fatter Than Couch Potatoes}}</ref> However, their mean [[body fat percentage]], 14%, is well within what's considered a healthy range.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/heart/articles/2009/05/26/nfl-players-not-at-increased-heart-risk|title=NFL Players Not at Increased Heart Risk: Study finds they showed no more signs of cardiovascular trouble than general male population}}</ref> 

The preferred obesity metric in scholarly circles is the [[body fat percentage]] (BF%) - the ratio of the total weight of person's fat to his or her body weight, and BMI is viewed merely as a way to approximate BF%.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/2/238.full.pdf|title=Assessing obesity: classification and epidemiology|author=Jacob C Seidell and Katherine M Flegal|journal=British Medical Bulletin|year=1997}}</ref> Levels in excess of 32% for women and 25% for men are generally considered to indicate obesity. However, accurate measurement of body fat percentage is much more difficult than measurement of BMI. Several methods of varying accuracy and complexity exist. 

Other proposed but less common obesity measures include [[waist]] circumference and [[waist–hip ratio]]. These measure a common form of obesity known as abdominal or [[central obesity]], characterized by excess deposits of fat in the abdominal region and inside [[peritoneal cavity]]. They have been shown to be comparable to BMI in their power to predict the risk of metabolic abnormalities such as type II diabetes,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/1/115.full|title=Comparison of Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference, and Waist/Hip Ratio in Predicting Incident Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis}}</ref> and possibly superior to BMI as predictors of cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.carmenwiki.osu.edu/download/attachments/21739701/WaistHipRatioReview.pdf|title=Body mass index, waist circumference and waist:hip ratio as predictors of cardiovascular risk—a review of the literature|author=R Huxley et al|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2010}}</ref>

==Body fat percentage==
{{main|Body fat percentage}}
[[File:FatCT2008.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Two computed tomography images of a horizontal section of the mid abdominal region; one from a normal weight individual the other from an obese person.  In both the bony structures and organs appear similar.  The primary difference is that in the normal weight person there is little subcutaneous fat and the obese person shows substantially subcutaneous fat.|Cross-sections of the torso of a person of normal weight (left) and an obese person (right), taken by [[Computed tomography|CT scan]]. Note the 3.6&nbsp;cm (1.4&nbsp;inches) of subcutaneous fat on the obese person.]]
Body fat percentage is total body fat expressed as a percentage of total body weight. There is no generally accepted definition of obesity based on total body fat. Most researchers have used >25% in men, and >30% in women, as cut-points to define obesity.<ref>Okorodudu et al, 2010. International Journal of Obesity (2010) 34, 791–799</ref> However, the finding that metabolic disturbance increases with increasing body fat percentage<ref>Romero-Corral et al, 2010. European Heart Journal (2010) 31, 737–746.</ref> suggests that focusing exclusively on cut-points of body fat percent may be of limited value. 

Body fat percentage can be estimated from a person's BMI by the following formula: 

:<math> \text{body fat percentage} = 1.2\times \text{BMI} + 0.23 \times \text{age} -5.4- 10.8 \times \text{gender}</math>

:where gender is 0 if female and 1 if male

This formula takes into account the fact that body fat percentage tends to be 10 [[percentage point]]s greater in women than in men for a given BMI. It recognizes that a person's percentage body fat tends to increase as they age, even if their weight and BMI remain constant. The results of this formula have been shown to have an accuracy of 4% in one group of individuals.<ref>Body mass index as a measure of body fatness: age- and sex-specific prediction formulas. Deurenberg P, Weststrate JA, Seidell JC. Br J Nutr, Mar 1991;65(2):105-14.</ref>

There are many other methods used to determine body fat percentage. [[Hydrostatic weighing]], one of the most accurate methods of body fat calculation, involves weighting a person underwater. Two other simpler and less accurate methods have been used historically but are now not recommended.<ref>NICE 2006 p.36</ref> The first is the [[Body fat percentage#Skinfold methods|skinfold test]], in which a [[pinch (action)|pinch]] of skin is precisely measured to determine the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer.<ref>Jebb and Wells 2005 p. 16.</ref> The other is [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]] which uses electrical resistance. Bioelectrical impedance has not been shown to provide an advantage over BMI.<ref>NICE 2006:36.</ref>
 
Body fat percentage measurement techniques used mainly for research include [[computed tomography]] (CT scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DEXA).<ref name=HSTAT/> These techniques provide very accurate measurements, but it can be difficult to obtain in the severely obese due to weight limits of most equipment and insufficient diameter of many CT or MRI scanners.<ref>Jebb and Wells 2005 p.20</ref>

==Childhood obesity==
{{main|Childhood obesity}}
[[File:Variation in body fat 12577.JPG|thumb|Variations in apparent body fat among children]]
A misconception regarding obesity is that it is only present in adults; there have been more and more cases where children are obese. Children are becoming number one for new cases dealing with this chronic disease. In children that have develop obesity during the early years are at a higher risk when being an adult and being obese.  It can start in the early stages of a child’s life and progress to overweight in teen years, due to pop culture putting more focus on video games and the television. Children these days have a lot of stress and unhealthy habits. <ref>|journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1086–93 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11382664 |doi= |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11382664}}</ref>

Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in 21st&nbsp;century with rising rates in both the developed and developing world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in 1980s to over 30% in 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.<ref name=flynn2006>{{cite journal |author=Flynn MA, McNeil DA, Maloff B, ''et al.'' |title=Reducing obesity and related chronic disease risk in children and youth: a synthesis of evidence with 'best practice' recommendations |journal=Obes Rev |volume=7 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=7–66 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16371076 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00242.x |url=}}</ref>

Children that become obese have a couple of different factors leading them to it.  The family environment can be a big contributor. If your child comes from a family of overweight people, he or she may be more likely to put on excess weight, especially in an environment where high-calorie food is always available and physical activity is not encouraged.  Some children overeat to cope with problems or to deal with emotions, such as stress, or to fight boredom.  Children that are being bullied can be obese because they are eating away their problems.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dollman J, Norton K, Norton L |title=Evidence for secular trends in children's physical activity behaviour. |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=892–7; discussion 897 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16306494 |pmc=1725088 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2004.016675 |url=}}</ref>  

Depression in obese children is very likely. That is due to having low self-esteem in the child, which can create overwhelming feelings of hopelessness. When children lose hope that their lives will improve, they may become depressed. A depressed child may lose interest in normal activities, sleep more than usual or cry a lot. Some depressed children hide their sadness and appear emotionally flat instead. Either way, depression is as serious in children as in adults.  Anyone with obesity can assume that their life expectancy will be lowers than others. Some of the kids will carry obesity with them in life, and ultimately can cause them to die before their parents. <ref>|author=Fennoy I |title=Childhood Obesity, Part 1: Weight Evaluation and Comorbidity Screening|journal=Consultant for Pediatricians |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/cholesterol/article/1145470/1403931}}</ref>
