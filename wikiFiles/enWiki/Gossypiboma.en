'''Gossypiboma''' or '''textiloma''' is the technical term for a [[surgery|surgical]] complications resulting from foreign materials, such as a [[surgical sponge]], accidentally left inside a patient's body. The term "gossypiboma" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:gossypium#Latin|gossypium]]'' (“cotton wool, [[cotton]]”) and the suffix ''[[wikt:-oma|-oma]]'', meaning a [[tumor]] or growth, and describes a mass within a patient's body comprising a cotton matrix surrounded by a [[foreign body granuloma]].<ref name="Kim et al"/><ref name=Kiernan>{{cite journal |author=Kiernan F, Joyce M, Byrnes CK, O'Grady H, Keane FB, Neary P |title=Gossypiboma: a case report and review of the literature |journal=Ir J Med Sci |volume=177 |issue=4 |pages=389–91 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18820991 |doi=10.1007/s11845-008-0197-0 |url=}}</ref> "Textiloma" is derived from [[textile]] (surgical sponges have historically been made of cloth), and is used in place of gossypiboma due to the increasing use of synthetic materials in place of cotton.<ref name="Kim et al">{{cite journal |author=Kim HS, Chung TS, Suh SH, Kim SY |title=MR imaging findings of paravertebral gossypiboma |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=709–13 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17416826 |doi= |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17416826}}</ref>

==Incidence and clinical presentation==
The actual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of gossypiboma is difficult to determine, possibly due to a reluctance to report occurrences arising from fear of legal repercussions, but retained surgical sponges is reported to occur once in every 3000 to 5000 abdominal operations<ref name=Kiernan/> and are most frequently discovered in the abdomen.<ref name="Manzella et al">{{cite journal |author=Manzella A, Filho PB, Albuquerque E, Farias F, Kaercher J |title=Imaging of gossypibomas: pictorial review |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=193 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=S94–101 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19933682 |doi=10.2214/AJR.07.7132 |url=}}</ref> The incidence of retained foreign bodies following surgery has a reported rate of 0.01% to 0.001%, of which gossypibomas make up 80% of cases.<ref name="Kim et al"/>

Gossypibomas can often present, clinically or radiologically, similar to [[tumor]]s and [[abscess]]es, with widely variable complications and manifestations, making diagnosis difficult and causing significant patient [[morbidity]].<ref name="Manzella et al"/> Two major types of reaction occur in response to retained surgical foreign bodies. In the first type, an [[abscess]] may form with or without a [[secondary infection|secondary bacterial infection]]. The second reaction is an [[aseptic]] fibrinous response, resulting in [[tissue adhesion]]s and encapsulation and eventually [[foreign body granuloma]].<ref name="Kim et al"/> Symptoms may not present for long periods of time, sometimes months or years following surgery.<ref name="Kim et al"/>

==Prevention==
To prevent gossypiboma, sponges are counted by hand before and after surgeries. This method was codified into recommended guidelines in the 1970s by the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses ([[AORN]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Recommended practices for sponge, sharp, and instrument counts. AORN Recommended Practices Committee. Association of periOperative Registered Nurses |journal=AORN J |volume=70 |issue=6 |pages=1083–9 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=10635432 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Four separate counts are recommended: the first when instruments and sponges are first unpackaged and set up, a second before the beginning of the surgical procedure, a third as closure begins, and a final count during final skin closure.<ref>[http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/ptsafety/chap22.htm "The Retained Surgical Sponge"], [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]]</ref> Other guidelines have been promoted by the [[American College of Surgeons]] and the [[Joint Commission]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gibbs VC, Coakley FD, Reines HD |title=Preventable errors in the operating room: retained foreign bodies after surgery--Part I |journal=Curr Probl Surg |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=281–337 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17512832 |doi=10.1067/j.cpsurg.2007.03.002 |url=}}</ref>

In most countries, surgical sponges contain [[radiodensity|radiopaque]] material that can be readily identified in [[radiographic]] and [[Computed tomography|CT]] images, facilitating detection.<ref name="Kim et al"/> In the United States, radiopaque threads impregnated into surgical gauzes were first introduced in 1929 and were in general use by about 1940.<ref name="Shyung et al"/> Some surgeons recommend routine postoperative [[X-ray]] films after surgery to reduce the likelihood of foreign body inclusion.<ref name="Shyung et al">{{cite journal |author=Shyung LR, Chang WH, Lin SC, Shih SC, Kao CR, Chou SY |title=Report of gossypiboma from the standpoint in medicine and law |journal=World J.
