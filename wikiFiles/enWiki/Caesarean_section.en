A '''Caesarean section''', (also '''C-section''', '''Caesarian section''', '''Cesarean section''', '''Caesar''', etc.) is a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure in which one or more [[incision]]s are made through a mother's [[abdomen]] ([[laparotomy]]) and [[uterus]] ([[hysterotomy]]) to [[childbirth|deliver]] one or more [[infant|babies]], or, rarely, to remove a dead [[fetus]]. A [[late-term abortion]] using Caesarean section procedures is termed a [[hysterotomy abortion]] and is very rarely performed. The first modern Caesarean section was performed by German gynecologist [[Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer]] in 1881.

A Caesarean section is usually performed when a [[vaginal delivery]] would put the baby's or mother's life or health at risk, although in recent times it has also been [[Caesarean delivery on maternal request|performed upon request]] for [[childbirth]]s that could otherwise have been natural.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/fear-a-factor-in-surgical-births/2007/10/06/1191091421081.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Fear a factor in surgical births | date=7 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4198257a11.html |title=Kiwi caesarean rate continues to rise |date=12 September 2007 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Finger | first=C. | title=Caesarean section rates skyrocket in Brazil.

The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb ''caedere'', to cut, with children delivered this way referred to as ''caesones''.  [[Pliny the Elder]] refers to a certain Julius Caesar (not the famous statesman, but a remote ancestor of his) as ''ab utero caeso'', "cut from the womb", a godly attribute comparable to rumours about the birth of [[Alexander the Great]].{{Clarify|date=September 2011}}<ref name="vanDongen-2009"/>  This and Caesar's name may have led to a false etymological connection with the ancient monarch. Notably, the Oxford English Dictionary does not credit a derivation from "caedere", and defines Caesarean birth as "the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the [[abdomen]] when delivery cannot take place in the natural way, as was done in the case of Julius Cæsar".{{fact|date=November 2012}}

Some link with Julius Caesar, or with Roman emperors in general, exists in other languages, as well.  For example, the modern [[German language|German]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] terms are respectively ''Kaiserschnitt'', ''keisersnitt'', ''kejsersnit'', ''keizersnede'', ''kejsarsnitt'', ''sezeryan'', and ''császármetszés'' (literally: "Emperor's cut").<ref>For a summary (in German), of an article (also in German) that deals usefully with many of the relevant historical and linguistic questions raised here, go here [http://www.etymologie.info/~e/d_/de-medizi.html#Kaiserschnitt].</ref>  The German term has also been imported into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (帝王切開 ''teiōsekkai'') and [[Korean language|Korean]] (제왕 절개 ''jewang jeolgae''), both literally meaning "emperor incision". Similar in western Slavic (Polish) ''cięcie cesarskie'', (Czech) ''císařský řez'' and (Slovak) ''cisársky rez'' (literally "imperial cut"), whereas the south Slavic term is [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''царски рез'' and [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] ''cárski réz'', which literally means "[[Tsar|tzar]]" cut. The [[Russian language|Russian]] term ''kesarevo secheniye'' (Кесарево сечение ''késarevo sečénije'') literally means ''Caesar's section''. The Arabic term (ولادة قيصرية ''wilaada qaySaríyya'') also means pertaining to Caesar or literally Caesarean. The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ניתוח קיסרי (''nitúakh Keisári'') translates literally as Caesarean surgery. In [[Romania]] and [[Portugal]], it is usually called ''cesariana'', meaning from (or related to) [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].{{fact|date=November 2012}}

According to [[Shahnameh]] ancient Persian book, the hero [[Rostam]] was the first person who was born with this method and term رستمينه (''rostamineh'') is corresponded to Caesarean.{{fact|date=November 2012}}

Finally, the Roman [[praenomen]] (given name) [[Caeso (praenomen)|Caeso]] was said to be given to children who were born via C-section. While this was probably just folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.{{fact|date=November 2012}}

[[Image:Uganda cesarean section.gif|thumb|300px|right|Successful Caesarean section performed by indigenous healers in Kahura, [[Uganda]]. As observed by R. W. Felkin in 1879.]]

The mother of [[Bindusara]] (born c. 320 BCE, ruled 298 – c.272 BCE), the second [[Mauryan empire|Mauryan]] [[Samrat]] (emperor) of [[India]], accidentally consumed poison and died when she was close to delivering him. [[Chanakya]], the Chandragupta's teacher and adviser, made up his mind that the baby should survive. He cut open the belly of the queen and took out the baby, thus saving the baby's life.<ref>{{cite book

In the [[Irish mythology|Irish mythological]] text the [[Ulster Cycle]], the character [[Furbaide Ferbend]] is said to have been born by posthumous Caesarean section, after his mother was murdered by his evil aunt [[Medb]].

The [[Babylonian Talmud]], an ancient [[Jew]]ish religious text, mentions a procedure similar to the Caesarean section. The procedure is termed ''yotzei dofen''.<ref name="Lurie"/>

[[Pliny the Elder]] theorized that Julius Caesar's name came from an ancestor who was born by Caesarean section, but the truth of this is debated (see the article on the [[Etymology of the name of Julius Caesar]]). The Ancient Roman Caesarean section was first performed to remove a baby from the womb of a mother who died during childbirth. Caesar's mother, [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]], lived through childbirth and successfully gave birth to her son, ruling out the possibility  the Roman ruler and general was born by Caesarean section.

The [[Catalonia|Catalan]] saint [[Raymond Nonnatus]] (1204–1240), received his surname—from the [[Latin]] ''non-natus'' ("not born")—because he was born by Caesarean section.  His mother died while giving birth to him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=314 |title=St. Raymond Nonnatus |publisher=Catholic Online |accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref>

In 1316, the future [[Robert II of Scotland]] was delivered by Caesarean section—his mother, [[Marjorie Bruce]], died. This may have been the inspiration for [[Macduff (thane)|Macduff]] in [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]''.

Caesarean section usually resulted in the death of the mother; the first recorded incidence of a woman surviving a Caesarean section was in the 1580s, in [[Kemmental|Siegershausen]], Switzerland: [[Jakob Nufer]], a pig gelder, is supposed to have performed the operation on his wife after a prolonged labour.<ref>Conner, Clifford D., A People's History Of Science : : Miners, Midwives, And "low Mechanicks", pg 3</ref> However, there is some basis for supposing that women regularly survived the operation in Roman times.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1034600|pmid=16562221|year=1961|last1=Boss|first1=J|title=THE ANTIQUITY OF CAESAREAN SECTION WITH MATERNAL SURVIVAL: THE JEWISH TRADITION|volume=5|issue=2|pages=117–31|journal=Medical history|doi=10.1017/S0025727300026089}}</ref> For most of the time since the 16th century, the procedure had a high [[death|mortality]] rate. However, it was long considered an extreme measure, performed only when the mother was already dead or considered to be beyond help. In Great Britain and Ireland, the mortality rate in 1865 was 85%. Key steps in reducing mortality were:

* Introduction of the transverse incision technique to minimize bleeding by [[Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer]] in 1881 is thought to be first modern CS performed.
* The introduction of uterine [[suturing]] by [[Max Saenger|Max Sänger]] in 1882
* Extraperitoneal CS and then moving to low transverse incision (Krönig, 1912){{Clarify|date=January 2009}}
* Adherence to principles of [[asepsis]]
* [[Anesthesia]] advances
* [[Blood transfusion]]
* [[Antibiotic]]s

European travelers in the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes region]] of [[Africa]] during the 19th century observed Caesarean sections being performed on a regular basis.<ref name="nlm.nih.gov_p2">{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/cesarean/part2.html |title=Cesarean Section – A Brief History: Part 2 |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref> The expectant mother was normally anesthetized with alcohol, and herbal mixtures were used to encourage healing.

The first successful Caesarean section to be performed in America took place in what was formerly Mason County, Virginia (now Mason County, West Virginia), in 1794.  The procedure was performed by Dr. Jesse Bennett on his wife Elizabeth.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815000,00.html|title=Woman's Ills|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=2009-04-01 | date=18 June 1951}}</ref>

[[Image:C-sec suture.jpg|thumb|right|Closed Incision for ''low transverse abdominal incision'' after stapling has been completed.]]
There are several types of Caesarean section (CS). An important distinction lies in the type of incision (longitudinal or latitudinal) made on the [[uterus]], apart from the incision on the skin.
* The classical Caesarean section involves a midline [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal incision]] which allows a larger space to deliver the baby. However, it is rarely performed today, as it is more prone to complications.
* The [[lower uterine segment section]] is the procedure most commonly used today; it involves a [[transverse cut]] just above the edge of the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and results in less [[Bleeding|blood loss]] and is easier to repair.
* An unplanned Caesarean section is performed once labour has commenced due to unexpected labor complications.
* A crash/emergent/emergency Caesarean section is performed in an obstetric emergency, where [[complications of pregnancy]] onset suddenly during the process of labour, and swift action is required to prevent the deaths of mother, child(ren) or both.
* A planned caesarean (or elective/scheduled caesarean), arranged ahead of time, is most commonly arranged for medical reasons and ideally as close to the due date as possible.
* A Caesarean [[hysterectomy]] consists of a Caesarean section followed by the removal of the [[uterus]]. This may be done in cases of intractable bleeding or when the [[placenta]] cannot be separated from the uterus.
* Traditionally, other forms of Caesarean section have been used, such as extraperitoneal Caesarean section or [[Eduardo Porro|Porro]] Caesarean section.
* A repeat Caesarean section is one that is done when a patient had a previous Caesarean section. Typically it is performed through the old scar.

In many hospitals, especially in [[Argentina]], the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], the mother's birth partner is encouraged to attend the surgery to support the mother and share the experience. The [[anaesthetist]] will usually lower the drape temporarily as the child is delivered so the parents can see their newborn.

Cesarean section can be performed with [[single layer suturing|single]] or [[double layer suturing]] of the uterine incision.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/0020-7292(94)02306-J}}</ref> A [[Cochrane review]] came to the result that single layer closure compared with double layer closure was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mean blood loss.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/14651858.CD004732.pub2}}</ref>

== Indications ==
[[Image:Cesarean section scar and linea nigra.JPG|thumb|right|A 7-week old Caesarean section [[scar]] and [[linea nigra]] visible on a 31-year-old mother.]]
Caesarean section is recommended when [[vagina]]l delivery might pose a risk to the mother or baby. Not all of the listed conditions represent a mandatory indication, and in many cases the obstetrician must use discretion to decide whether a Caesarean is necessary. Some indications for Caesarean delivery are:

Complications of labor and factors impeding vaginal delivery, such as:
* prolonged [[Childbirth|labour]] or a failure to progress ([[dystocia]])
* [[fetal distress]]
* [[cord prolapse]]
* [[uterine rupture]]
* increased blood pressure ([[hypertension]]) in the mother or baby after [[amniotic fluid|amniotic rupture]]
* increased heart rate ([[tachycardia]]) in the mother or baby after amniotic rupture
* [[placenta]]l problems ([[placenta praevia]], [[placental abruption]] or [[placenta accreta]])
* abnormal presentation ([[Breech birth|breech]] or [[:wikt:transverse|transverse]] positions)
* failed [[labour induction]]
* failed instrumental delivery (by [[forceps]] or [[ventouse]] (Sometimes a trial of forceps/ventouse delivery is attempted, and if unsuccessful, it will be switched to a Caesarean section.)
* large baby weighing >4000g ([[macrosomia]])
* umbilical cord abnormalities ([[vasa previa]], multilobate including bilobate and succenturiate-lobed placentas, velamentous insertion)

Other complications of pregnancy, pre-existing conditions and concomitant disease, such as:
*[[pre-eclampsia]]
* hypertension<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turner R |title=Caesarean Section Rates, Reasons for Operations Vary Between Countries |journal=Fam Plann Perspect. |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=281–2 |year=1990 |doi=10.2307/2135690 |publisher=Guttmacher Institute |jstor=2135690 }}</ref>
* [[multiple birth]]s
* previous (high risk) fetus
* [[HIV]] infection of the mother
* Sexually transmitted infections, such as genital herpes (which can be passed on to the baby if the baby is born vaginally, but can usually be treated in with medication and do not require a Caesarean section)
* previous classical(longitudinal) Caesarean section
* previous uterine rupture
* prior problems with the healing of the [[perineum]] (from previous childbirth or [[Crohn's disease]])
* [[Bicornuate uterus]]
* Rare cases of [[posthumous birth]] after the death of the mother

==Risks==

===Risks for the mother===
The [[mortality rate]] for both Caesarian sections and vaginal birth, in the Western world, continues to drop steadily. In 2000, the mortality rate for Caesareans in the United States were 20 per 1,000,000.<ref name=Pai00>{{cite journal |author=Pai, Madhukar |title=Medical Interventions: Caesarean Sections as a Case Study |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=35 |issue=31 |pages=2755–61 |year=2000}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[National Health Service]] gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=71&sectionId=7681 |title=Caesarean Section |publisher=[[NHS Direct]] |accessdate=2006-07-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
However, it is misleading to directly compare the mortality rates of vaginal and Caesarean deliveries. Women with severe medical conditions, or higher-risk pregnancies, often require a Caesarean section which can distort the mortality figures.

A study <!--published -->in <!--the 13 February 2007 issue of -->the ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'' found the absolute difference in rates of severe maternal morbidity (e.g. cardiac arrest, wound hematoma, or hysterectomy) was small (18.3 additional cases in 1000 or three times the risk) and the difference in maternal mortality was nonsignificant, but this additional risk over vaginal delivery should be considered by women contemplating an elective Caesarean delivery and by their physicians.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liu S, Liston RM, Joseph KS, Heaman M, Sauve R, Kramer MS |title=Maternal mortality and severe morbidity associated with low-risk planned cesarean delivery versus planned vaginal delivery at term |journal=CMAJ |volume=176 |issue=4 |pages=455–60 |year=2007 |pmid=17296957 |pmc=1800583 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.060870 }}</ref>

As with all types of abdominal surgeries, a Caesarean section is associated with risks of postoperative [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], incisional hernias (which may require surgical correction) and wound infections.<ref name=Pai00/> If a Caesarean is performed under emergency situations, the risk of the surgery may be increased due to a number of factors. The patient's stomach may not be empty, increasing the anaesthesia risk.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gynaecworld.com/Pregnancy/pg9.html#3 |title=Why are Caesareans Done? |publisher=Gynaecworld |accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref> Other risks include severe blood loss (which may require a blood transfusion) and [[Post dural puncture headache|postdural-puncture spinal headaches]].<ref name=Pai00/>

A study published in ''Obstetrics and Gynecology'' found women who had multiple Caesarean sections were more likely to have problems with later pregnancies, and recommended women who want larger families should not seek Caesarean section as an elective.  The risk of [[placenta accreta]], a potentially life-threatening condition, is only 0.13% after two Caesarean sections, but increases to 2.13% after four and then to 6.74% after six or more surgeries.  Along with this is a similar rise in the risk of emergency hysterectomies at delivery.  The findings were based on outcomes from 30,132 Caesarean deliveries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silver RM, Landon MB, Rouse DJ, ''et al.'' |title=Maternal morbidity associated with multiple repeat cesarean deliveries |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=107 |issue=6 |pages=1226–32 |year=2006 |pmid=16738145 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000219750.79480.84 }} (see also review by [http://www.webmd.com/content/article/123/115093?action=related_link WebMD.com])</ref>

It is difficult to study the effects of Caesarean sections because it can be difficult to separate out issues caused by the procedure itself versus issues caused by the conditions that require it.  For example, one study found women who had just one previous Caesarean section were more likely to have problems with their second birth. Women who delivered their first child by Caesarean delivery had increased risks for [[malpresentation]], [[placenta previa]],  [[antepartum hemorrhage]], [[placenta accreta]], prolonged labor, [[uterine]] rupture, preterm birth, low birth weight, and [[stillbirth]] in their second deliveries.  However, the authors concluded some risks may be due to confounding factors related to the indication for the first Caesarean, rather than due to the procedure itself.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kennare R, Tucker G, Heard A, Chan A |title=Risks of adverse outcomes in the next birth after a first cesarean delivery |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=109 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=270–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17267823 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000250469.23047.73}}</ref>

An often overlooked aspect of maternal health is the psychological risks and implications that a Cesarean birth can have.

===Risks for the child===

Non-medically indicated (elective) childbirth before 39 weeks gestation "carry significant risks for the baby with no known benefit to the mother."  Complications from elective cesarean before 39 weeks include: newborn mortality at 37 weeks may be 2.5 times the number at 40 weeks, and was elevated compared to 38 weeks of gestation. These “early term” births were also associated with increased death during infancy, compared to those occurring at 39 to 41 weeks ("full term").<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org"/>  Researchers in one study and another review found many benefits to going full term, but “no adverse effects” in the health of the mothers or babies.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org"/><ref name="urlTerm Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics & Gynecology">{{cite web |url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2011/06000/Term_Pregnancy__A_Period_of_Heterogeneous_Risk_for.5.aspx |title=Term Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics & Gynecology |work= |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref>

== Analyzing the rise in Caesarean section rates ==

The World Health Organization officially withdrew its previous recommendation of a 15% C-section rates in June 2010.  Their official statement read, "There is no empirical evidence for an optimum percentage. What matters most is that all women who need caesarean sections receive them."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10448034 | work=BBC News | title=Should there be a limit on Caesareans? | date=30 June 2010}}</ref>

The US National Institutes of Health says rises in rates of Caesarean sections are not, in isolation, a cause for concern, but may reflect changing reproductive patterns:

<blockquote>
The World Health Organization has determined an “ideal rate” of all cesarean deliveries (such as 15 percent) for a population. One surgeon's opinion is that there is no consistency in this ideal rate, and artificial declarations of an ideal rate should be discouraged. Goals for achieving an optimal cesarean delivery rate should be based on maximizing the best possible maternal and neonatal outcomes, taking into account available medical and health resources and maternal preferences. This opinion is based on the idea that if left unchallenged, optimal cesarean delivery rates will vary over time and across different populations according to individual and societal circumstances.<ref name="NIH">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00006250-200606000-00027 | author = NIH | title = State-of-the-Science Conference Statement. Cesarean Delivery on Maternal Request | journal = Obstet Gynecol | year = 2006 | volume = 107 | issue = 6 | pages = 1386–97|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/2006/CesareanStatement_Final053106.pdf| pmid=16738168}}</ref></blockquote>

The number of C-sections performed has grown rapidly, for example, a fourfold increase from 1971 to 1991 (from 4.2 per 100 births){{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. This may be accredited to the improved technology in detecting prebirth distress. Malpractice has been looked into because of the rapid increase. Some argue the higher costs of C-section births compared to regular births make physicians quicker to recommend surgery. Usually, if a doctor makes a recommendation, people are quick to take it to heart and act upon it. The effect of relative C-section price on C-section usage should be examined.

However, some commentators are concerned by the rise and have noted several evidence-based studies.  Louise Silverton, deputy general-secretary of the [[Royal College of Midwives]], says not only has society’s tolerance for pain and illness been “significantly reduced”, but also women are scared of pain and think if they have a Caesarean, there will be less, if any, pain. In the opinion of Silverton and the Royal College of Midwives, “women have lost their confidence in their ability to give birth."<ref name="guardian.co.uk">Campbell, Denis. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/oct/26/health-women “‘Fear of Pain’ causes a big rise in Caesareans.”] 26 October 2008. The Guardian. Retrieved 27 October 2008.</ref>

Silverton's analysis is controversial among some surgeons.  Dr Maggie Blott, a consultant obstetrician at University College Hospital, London and then a Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) spokeswoman on Caesareans (and Vice President of the RCOG), responded: 'There isn't any evidence to support Louise Silverton's view that increasingly pain-averse women are pushing up the Caesarean rate. There's an undercurrent that Caesarean sections are a bad thing, but they can be life-saving.'<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/>

A previously unexplored hypothesis for the increasing rate is the evolution of birth weight and maternal pelvis size.  It is proposed that since the advent of successful Caesarean birth over the last 150 years, mothers with small pelvises and babies with large birth weights have survived and contributed to these traits, increasing in the population percentage.  Such a hypothesis is based upon the idea that even without fears of malpractice, without maternal obesity and diabetes, and without other widely quoted factors, the C-section rate would continue to rise simply due to slow changes in population genetics.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Evolution and the Cesarean Section Rate|doi=10.1662/0002-7685(2008)70[401:ETCSR]2.0.CO;2|journal=The American Biology Teacher|year=2008|pages=401–404|volume=70|issue=7|issn=0002-7685|last1=Walsh|first1=Joseph A.}}</ref>

== Elective Caesarean sections ==
{{Main|Elective caesarean section}}

{{off-topic|Elective_caesarean_section|date=January 2011}}

Caesarean sections are in some cases performed for reasons other than [[medical necessity]]. These can vary, with a key distinction being between hospital- or doctor-centric reasons and mother-centric reasons. Critics of doctor-ordered Caesareans worry that Caesareans are in some cases performed because they are profitable for the hospital, because a quick Caesarean is more convenient for an obstetrician than a lengthy vaginal birth, or because it is easier to perform surgery at a scheduled time than to respond to nature's schedule and deliver a baby at an hour that is not predetermined.<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie IZ, Cooke I, Annan B |title=Indications for Caesarean section in a consultant obstetric unit over three decades |journal=J Obstet Gynaecol |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=233–8 |year=2003 |pmid=12850849 |doi=10.1080/0144361031000098316 }}</ref> Another reason for doctors to recommend C-sections is money. In China, doctors are compensated based on the monetary value of medical treatments offered. As a result, they have an incentive to persuade mothers to choosing the more expensive C-section.

Non-medically indicated (elective) childbirth before 39 weeks gestation "carry significant risks for the baby with no known benefit to the mother."  Hospitals should institute strict monitoring of births to comply with full term (more than 39 weeks gestation) elective C-section guidelines.  In review, three hospitals following policy guidelines brought elective early deliveries down 64%, 57%, and 80%.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org"/>  The researchers found many benefits but “no adverse effects” in the health of the mothers and babies at those hospitals.<ref name="urlwww.patientsafetycouncil.org"/><ref name="urlTerm Pregnancy: A Period of Heterogeneous Risk for Infant Mo... : Obstetrics & Gynecology"/>

In this context, it is worth remembering many studies have shown operations performed out-of-hours tend to have more complications (both surgical and anaesthetic).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cullinane M, Gray A, Hargraves C, Lansdown M, Martin I, Schubert M |title=Who operates when? – The 2003 Report of the Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths |url=http://www.ncepod.org.uk/pdf/2003/03full.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-30 }}</ref> For this reason, if a Caesarean is anticipated to be likely to be needed for a woman, it may be preferable to perform this electively (or pre-emptively) during daylight operating hours, rather than wait for it to become an emergency with the increased risk of surgical and anaesthetic complications that can follow from emergency surgery.

Another contributing factor for doctor-ordered procedures may be fear of [[medical malpractice]] lawsuits. Italian gynaecologyst Enrico Zupi, whose clinic in Rome, Mater Dei, was under [[media attention]] for carrying a record of Caesarian sections (90% over total birth), explained: “We shouldn't be blamed. Our approach must be understood. We doctors are often sued for events and complications that cannot be classified as malpractice. So we turn to defensive medicine. We will keep acting this way as long as medical mistakes are not depenalized. We are not [[martyr]]s. So if a pregnant woman is facing an even minimum risk, we suggest she gets a C-section "<ref name="Corriere della Sera" />

Studies of [[United States]] women have indicated married white women giving birth in private hospitals are more likely to have a Caesarean section than poorer women, although they are less likely to have complications that may lead to a Caesarean section being required.  The women in these studies have indicated their preference for Caesarean section is more likely to be partly due to considerations of pain and vaginal tone.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wagner |first=Marsden |title=Born in the USA: How a Broken Maternity System Must Be Fixed to Put Women and Children First |page=42 |url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0520245962 |format=registration required |isbn=0-520-24596-2}}</ref> In contrast, a recent study in the [[British Medical Journal]] retrospectively analysed a large number of Caesarean sections in England and stratified them by social class.

== Anaesthesia ==

Both [[general anesthesia|general]] and [[regional anesthesia|regional anaesthesia]] ([[spinal anaesthesia|spinal]], [[epidural]] or [[combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia]]) are acceptable for use during Caesarean section. Regional anaesthesia is preferred as it allows the mother to be awake and interact immediately with her baby.<ref name=Hawkins>{{cite journal |author=Hawkins JL, Koonin LM, Palmer SK, Gibbs CP |title=Anesthesia-related deaths during obstetric delivery in the United States, 1979–1990 |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=277–84 |year=1997 |pmid=9054245 |doi= 10.1097/00000542-199702000-00002}}</ref> Other advantages of regional anesthesia include the absence of typical risks of general anesthesia: [[pulmonary aspiration]] (which has a relatively high incidence in patients undergoing anesthesia in late pregnancy) of gastric contents and [[Esophagus|Oesophageal]] [[intubation]].<ref name=Afolabi/>

Regional anaesthesia is used in 95% of deliveries, with spinal and combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia being the most commonly used regional techniques in scheduled Caesarean section.<ref name="Bucklin">{{cite journal |author=Bucklin BA, Hawkins JL, Anderson JR, Ullrich FA |title=Obstetric anesthesia workforce survey: twenty-year update |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=103 |issue=3 |pages=645–53 |year=2005 |pmid=16129992 |doi= 10.1097/00000542-200509000-00030}}</ref> Regional anaesthesia during Caesarean section is different to the [[analgesia]] (pain relief) used in labor and vaginal delivery. The pain that is experienced because of surgery is greater than that of labor and therefore requires a more intense [[nerve block]]. The dermatomal level of anesthesia required for Caesarean delivery is also higher than that required for labor analgesia.<ref name="Afolabi">{{cite journal |author=Afolabi BB, Lesi FE, Merah NA |editor1-last=Afolabi |editor1-first=Bosede B |title=Regional versus general anaesthesia for Caesarean section |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=4 |pages=CD004350 |year=2006 |pmid=17054201 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004350.pub2}}</ref>

General anesthesia may be necessary because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, when there is no time to perform a regional anesthesia.

== Vaginal birth after Caesarean ==

{{Main|Vaginal birth after caesarean}}

While vaginal births after Caesarean (VBAC) are not uncommon today, the rate of VBAC has declined to include less than 10% of births after previous Cesarean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthindicators.gov/Indicators/Priorcesareanbirths_1134/Profile/Data |title=Cesarean births, repeat (percent) - Health Indicators Warehouse |publisher=Healthindicators.gov |date= }}</ref>

In the past, Caesarean sections used a vertical incision which cut the uterine muscle fibres in an up and down direction (a classical Caesarean). Modern Caesareans typically involve a horizontal incision along the muscle fibres in the lower portion of the uterus (hence the term lower uterine segment Caesarean section). The uterus then better maintains its integrity and can tolerate the strong contractions of future childbirth. Cosmetically, the scar for modern Caesareans is below the "[[bikini line]]".

Obstetricians and other caregivers differ on the relative merits of vaginal and Caesarean section following a Caesarean delivery; some still recommend a Caesarean routinely, while others do not. In the US, the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) modified the guidelines on vaginal birth after previous Caesarean delivery in 1999, 2004, and again in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&doc_id=6374 |title=Guideline on Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery |publisher=guideline.gov |author=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) |accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> In 2004, this modification to the guideline included the addition of the following recommendation:
<blockquote>
Because uterine rupture may be catastrophic, VBAC should be attempted in institutions equipped to respond to emergencies with physicians immediately available to provide emergency care.<ref name=acogguide>{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&doc_id=6374#s23 |title=Guideline on Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery: Major Recommendations |publisher=guideline.gov |author=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) |accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref>
</blockquote> In 2010, ACOG modified these guidelines again to express more encouragement of VBAC, but maintained it should still be undertaken at facilities capable of emergency care, though patient autonomy in assuming increased levels of risk should be respected (ACOG Practice Bulletin Number 115, August 2010).

The recommendation for access to emergency care during trial of labor has, in some cases, had a major impact on the availability of VBACs to birthing mothers in the US. For example, a study of the change in frequency of VBAC deliveries in California after the change in guidelines, published in 2006, found the VBAC rate fell to 13.5% after the change, compared with 24% VBAC rate before the change.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zweifler J, Garza A, Hughes S, Stanich MA, Hierholzer A, Lau M |title=Vaginal birth after cesarean in California: before and after a change in guidelines |journal=Ann Fam Med |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=228–34 |year=2006 |pmid=16735524 |pmc=1479438 |doi=10.1370/afm.544 }}</ref> The new recommendation has been interpreted by many hospitals as indicating a full surgical team must be standing by to perform a Caesarean section for the full duration of a VBAC woman's labor. Hospitals that prohibit VBACs entirely are said to have a 'VBAC ban'. In these situations, birthing mothers are forced to choose between having a repeat Caesarean section, finding an alternate hospital in which to deliver their babies or attempting delivery outside the hospital setting.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-08-23-csection-battle_x.htm |title=Battle lines drawn over C-sections |publisher=USA Today |author=Rita Rubin |accessdate=2008-02-09 | date=24 August 2005}}</ref>

Most recently, enhanced access to VBAC has been recommended based on updated scientific data on the safety of VBAC as compared to repeat Caesarean section, including the following recommendation emerging from the NIH VBAC conference panel in March 2010, "We recommend that hospitals, maternity care providers, health care and professional liability insurers, consumers, and policymakers collaborate on the development of integrated services that could mitigate or even eliminate current barriers to trial of labor."<ref name="consensus.nih.gov">http://consensus.nih.gov/2010/vbacstatement.htm</ref> The U.S Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2020 initiative includes objectives to reduce the primary cesarean rate and to increase the VBAC rate by at least 10% each.<ref name="healthypeople.gov"/>

==Recovery period==
Typically, the recovery time depends on the patient and her pain tolerance and inflammation levels. Doctors do recommend abstention from strenuous work (e.g., lifting objects over 10&nbsp;lbs (4.5&nbsp;kg)., running, walking up stairs, or athletics) for up to six months{{medical citation needed|date=September 2012}}
, and a waiting period of ~18 months before attempting to conceive another child.{{medical citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Within Judaism==
There is a dispute among the ''[[poskim]]'' (Rabbinic authorities) as to whether a first-born son from a Caesarean section has the laws of a ''[[bechor]]''.<ref>See Chok Yaakov 470:2; Kaf ha-Chayim 470:3; http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5758/pesach.html</ref> Traditionally, a male child delivered by Caesarean is not eligible for the ''[[Pidyon HaBen]]'' dedication ritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/lifeevents/g/pidyonhaben.htm |title=Pidyon HaBen - Definition of Pidyon HaBen (Redemption of the Firstborn) |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=19 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cohen-levi.org/the_cohens_heritage/pidyon_ha_ben.htm |title=Kohanim forever from the sources, who is a cohen, the blessing of the Cohanim,.
