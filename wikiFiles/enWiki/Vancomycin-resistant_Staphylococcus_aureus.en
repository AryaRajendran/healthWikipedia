[[File:Staphylococcus aureus VISA.jpg|thumb|350 px|Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) shows a strain of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' bacteria taken from a vancomycin intermediate resistant culture (VISA).]]'''Vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''''' refers to strains of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' that have become [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to the [[glycopeptide antibiotic]] [[vancomycin]]. With the increase of staphylococcal resistance to [[methicillin]], vancomycin (or another glycopeptide antibiotic, [[teicoplanin]]) is often a treatment of choice in infections with [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (MRSA). Three classes of vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'' have emerged that differ in vancomycin [[minimum inhibitory concentration|susceptibilities]]: vancomycin-intermediate ''S. aureus'' (VISA), heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate ''S. aureus'' (hVISA), and high-level vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'' (VRSA).<ref name="pmid17888634">{{cite journal |author=Appelbaum PC |title=Reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA) |journal=Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=398–408 |year=2007 |month=November |pmid=17888634 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.07.011 |url=}}</ref>

==Vancomycin-intermediate ''S. aureus'' (VISA)==
VISA was first identified in [[Japan]] in 1996 and has since been found in hospitals elsewhere in [[Asia]], as well as in [[the United Kingdom]], [[France]], the [[United States|U.S.]], and [[Brazil]]. It is also termed GISA (glycopeptide-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus''), indicating resistance to all glycopeptide antibiotics. These bacterial strains present a thickening of the cell wall, which is believed to reduce the ability of vancomycin to diffuse into the division septum of the cell required for effective vancomycin treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Howden BP, Davies JK, Johnson PD, Stinear TP, Grayson ML | title=Reduced vancomycin susceptibility in Staphylococcus aureus, including vancomycin-intermediate and heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate strains: resistance mechanisms, laboratory detection, and clinical implications | journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. | year=2010 | month=Jan | volume=23 | issue=1 | pages=99–139 | doi=10.1128/CMR.00042-09 | pmid=20065327 | pmc=2806658 | url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/23/1/99}}</ref>

Even with the absence of high-level resistance to vancomycin, another concern posed by the presence of VISA is the increased difficulty in prescribing treatments, especially in situations where an effective treatment for an infection is needed urgently, before detailed resistance profiles can be obtained. In hospitals already endemic with [[multidrug resistance|multiresistant]] [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], the appearance of VRSA would make the treatment of infected patients much more difficult.

===Treatment===
[[Ceftobiprole]] was found by [[Rockefeller University]] to be effective as of 2008. [[Linezolid]], [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]], [[daptomycin]] and [[tigecycline]] are treatments of consideration.

==Vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'' (VRSA)==
High-level vancomycin resistance in ''S. aureus'' has been rarely reported.<ref name="pmid21109164">{{cite journal |author=Gould IM |title=VRSA-doomsday superbug or damp squib? |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=816–8 |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21109164 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(10)70259-0 |url=}}</ref> ''[[In vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' experiments reported in 1992 demonstrated that vancomycin resistance genes from ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'' could be transferred by [[horizontal gene transfer]] to ''S. aureus'', conferring high-level vancomycin resistance to ''S. aureus''.<ref name="pmid1505742">{{cite journal |author=Noble WC, Virani Z, Cree RG |title=Co-transfer of vancomycin and other resistance genes from ''Enterococcus faecalis'' NCTC 12201 to ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=FEMS Microbiol.

Vancomycin [[minimum inhibitory concentration|MICs]] of the VRSA isolate were consistent with the VanA phenotype of ''[[Enterococcus]]'' species, and the presence of the ''vanA'' gene was confirmed by [[polymerase chain reaction]]. The DNA sequence of the VRSA ''vanA'' gene was identical to that of a [[vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant strain of ''Enterococcus faecalis'']] recovered from the same catheter tip. The ''vanA'' gene was later found to be encoded within a [[transposon]] located on a [[plasmid]] carried by the VRSA isolate.<ref name="pmid14645850">{{cite journal |author=Weigel LM, Clewell DB, Gill SR, ''et al.'' |title=Genetic analysis of a high-level vancomycin-resistant isolate of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5650 |pages=1569–71 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14645850 |doi=10.1126/science.1090956 |url=}}</ref> This transposon, Tn''1546'', confers ''vanA''-type vancomycin resistance in enterococci.<ref name="pmid16323116">{{cite journal |author=Courvalin P |title=Vancomycin resistance in gram-positive cocci |journal=Clin.

From 2002 to 2010, ten additional VRSA isolates were reported, eight from the United States, one from Iran, and one from India.<ref name="pmid21109164"/>

===Treatment===
[[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} was shown to have efficacy in treating the first known US case of VRSA. [[Linezolid]], [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] and [[daptomycin]] are treatments of consideration.
