==Biography==
Garland was born on June 20, 1950, in [[San Diego]] and earned a bachelor's degree in 1972 from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he majored in history.<ref name=NYTObit/>

In July 1974, Garland and his brother, epidemiologist [[Cedric F. Garland]], attended a lecture at [[Johns Hopkins University]] where maps were presented showing higher rates for certain cancers in counties in the Northern United States, approaching double the rate in some Northern U.S. counties than in [[Southern United States|the South]].<ref name=LATObit/> This disparity led them to investigate the relationship and write the 1980 article ''Do Sunlight and Vitamin D Reduce the Likelihood of Colon Cancer?'' published in the ''[[International Journal of Epidemiology]]'', in which the brothers put forth the hypothesis that higher rates of colon cancer in Northerners was caused by lower levels of sunshine exposure, which resulted in lower levels of [[Vitamin D]] which then cause lower levels of [[calcium]] in the body.<ref name=NYTObit>Fox, Margalit. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/us/05garland.html "Frank C. Garland, 60, Who Connected Vitamin D Deficiency and Cancer, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 4, 2010.</ref>

Garland recalled, "We both immediately noticed a pattern, a pattern that launched both our careers. Our entire academic lives are based on that single moment."<ref>Edwards, Kim. [http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/23933 "Frank Garland, 1950-2010"], [[University of California]] press release dated August 24, 2010. Accessed September 4, 2010.</ref> While recognizing the risk of [[melanoma]] and other forms of [[skin cancer]] from excessive exposure to the Sun, the Garlands proposed that limited sun exposure would provide enough Vitamin D to help prevent colon cancer, which could also be achieved by taking nutritional supplements. 

==Education and early career==

Garland was awarded a doctorate in 1981 from Johns Hopkins University and pursued a career as an epidemiologist at the [[University of California, San Diego]], where he was hired in 1986 as professor of [[family medicine|family]] and [[preventive medicine]].

==Published Work==

His later research connected deficiencies in Vitamin D in residents of Northern cities as connected to [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] and higher rates of [[breast cancer]] and other cancers.<ref name=NYTObit/> In a study of residents of [[Chicago]] conducted over two decades, the Garlands found that the colon cancer incidence in the quintile with the highest Vitamin D intake was half that of those in the lowest quintile. Theirs was the first study to show that higher levels of Vitamin D could cut rates of colon cancer.<ref name=LATObit/> Another of their studies which analyzed the blood from 25,000 volunteers from [[Washington County, Maryland]] found that those with the highest levels of levels of the Vitamin D [[metabolite]] [[Calcifediol]] had a risk of colon cancer that was one-fifth of typical rates.<ref name=LATObit/>

==Personal life==

A resident of San Diego, Garland died at age 60 on August 17, 2010, at [[UCSD Medical Center]] in [[La Jolla, San Diego, California]], due to [[esophageal cancer|cancer of the esophageal junction]].<ref name=LATObit>Maugh II, Thomas H.

Garland dies at 60; epidemiologist helped show importance of vitamin D: Garland and his brother Cedric were the first to demonstrate that vitamin D deficiencies play a role in cancer and other diseases."], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', August 31, 2010.
