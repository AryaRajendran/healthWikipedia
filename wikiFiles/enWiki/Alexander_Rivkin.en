Dr. Rivkin also helped develop and popularize procedures such as non-surgical chin enhancement, non-surgical cheek enhancement, non-surgical jowl lift, and non-surgical eye lift.<ref name="Derm"/> He uses [[Botox]] injections to help patients who habitually grind their teeth or have [[temporomandibular joint disorder|TMJ]] (temporomandibular joint disorder).<ref name="PL">{{cite news

===Non-Surgical Rhinoplasty===
Rivkin first thought of the non-surgical rhinoplasty in 2002. He claims he was filling the [[nasolabial folds]] of a friend when he realized he could use [[collagen]] to raise the skin above a bump on her nose. Doing so made it appear straight. He's since used the procedure on more than 1000 patients. The whole process only takes 15 minutes, and consists of a series of small filler injections into precise locations on the nose. Rivkin has referred to the non-surgical rhinoplasty as a "non-surgical nose job", "injection rhinoplasty" and "The 15 Minute Nose Job."<ref name="nonsu">{{cite news
