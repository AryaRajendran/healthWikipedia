'''Dermatoglyphics''' (from [[ancient Greek]] derma = "skin", [[glyph]] = "carving") is the scientific study of [[fingerprint]]s. The term was coined by Dr. [[Harold Cummins]], the father of American fingerprint analysis, even though the process of fingerprint identification had already been in use for several hundred years.<ref>[[Fingerprint#History of fingerprinting for identification]]</ref> All [[primate]]s have ridged skin. It can also be found on the paws of certain [[mammal]]s, and on the tails of some [[monkey]] species. In humans and animals, dermatoglyphs are present on fingers, palms, toes and soles. This helps shed light on a critical period of [[embryogenesis]], between four weeks and five months, when the architecture of the major organ systems is developing.

The word dermatoglyphics comes from two Greek words (derma, skin and glyphe, carve) and refers to the friction ridge formations which appear on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.  Characteristically, hair does not grow from this area.  The ridging formations serve well to enhance contact, an area of multiple nerve endings (Dermal Papillae) and aids in the prevention of slippage.  People of African ancestry display reduced skin pigmentation in the designated locations.  All studies of the dermal ridge arrangements including genetics, anthropology and [[Egyptology]] are classified under the term dermatoglyphics.

The word ''subdermatoglyphic'' is cited as one of the longest [[Isogram|isograms]] in the English language.

==Genetic disorders==
Unusual dermatoglyphic patterns often relate to [[genetic disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shiono H |title=Dermatoglyphics in medicine |journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=120–6 |year=1986 |pmid=2943156 |doi=10.1097/00000433-198607020-00008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.1982.tb00757.x |author=Katznelson M, Goldman B |title=Fetal dermatoglyphics |journal=Clin Genet |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=237–42 |year=1982 |pmid=6213324}}</ref> One study of [[fetus]]es with chromosomal abnormalities showed that the dermatoglyphic patterns were delayed by more than two weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Suzumori K |title=Dermatoglyphic analysis of fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=859–68 |year=1980 |pmid=6449865 |pmc=1686142}}</ref>

* Trisomy 21 ([[Down syndrome]]): People with Down syndrome have a finger print pattern with mainly [[Ulnar loop#Classifying|ulnar loops]], and a significantly different angle between the triradia a, t and d (the 'adt angle')<!-- 66° -->. Other differences often include a [[single transverse palmar crease]] ("Simian line") (in 50%), and patterns in the hypothenar and interdigital areas,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rajangam S, Janakiram S, Thomas I |title=Dermatoglyphics in Down's syndrome |journal=J Indian Med Assoc |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=10–3 |year=1995 |pmid=7759898}}</ref> lower ridge counts along digital midlines, especially in little fingers, which corresponds to finger shortening in those with Down's syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mglinets V |title=[Relationship between dermatoglyphic variability and finger length in genetic disorders: Down's syndrome] |journal=Genetika |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=541–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1830282}}</ref> There is less variation in dermatoglyphic patterns between people with Down syndrome than between controls,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mglinets V, Ivanov V |title=[Bilateral symmetry of the dermatoglyphic characteristics in Down's syndrome] |journal=Ontogenez |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=98–102 |year= 1993|pmid=8355961}}</ref> and dermatoglyphic patterns can be used to determine correlations with congenital heart defects in individuals with Down syndrome by examining the left hand digit ridge count minus the right hand digit ridge count, and the number of ridges on the fifth digit of the left hand.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Durham N, Koehler J |title=Dermatoglyphic indicators of congenital heart defects in Down's syndrome patients: a preliminary study |journal=J Ment Defic Res |volume=33 |issue= 4|pages=343–8 |year= 1989|pmid=2527997}}</ref>
