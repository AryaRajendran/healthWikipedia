The '''posterior interosseous artery''' ('''dorsal interosseous artery''') is an [[artery]] of the [[forearm]].  

It passes backward between the [[oblique cord]] and the upper border of the [[interosseous membrane]]. It appears between the contiguous borders of the [[supinator]] and the [[abductor pollicis longus]], and runs down the back of the forearm between the superficial and deep layers of muscles, to both of which it distributes branches. 

Where it lies upon the [[abductor pollicis longus]] and the [[extensor pollicis brevis]], it is accompanied by the [[dorsal interosseous nerve]]. At the lower part of the forearm it anastomoses with the termination of the [[volar interosseous artery]], and with the [[dorsal carpal network]]. 

It gives off, near its origin, the [[interosseous recurrent artery]], which ascends to the interval between the lateral epicondyle and olecranon, on or through the fibers of the Supinator, but beneath the [[anconeus]], and [[anastomoses]] with the [[radial collateral branch]] of the [[profunda brachii]], the [[posterior ulnar recurrent]] and the [[inferior ulnar collateral]].
