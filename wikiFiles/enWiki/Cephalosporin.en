[[File:Cephalosporins Generation1.svg|thumb|Structure of the classical cephalosporins]]
The '''cephalosporins''' (sg. {{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|s|ɛ|f|ə|l|ɵ|ˈ|s|p|ɔr|ɨ|n}}) are a class of [[beta-lactam antibiotic|β-lactam antibiotics]] originally derived from the [[fungus]] ''[[Acremonium]]'', which was previously known as "''Cephalosporium''".<ref>{{DorlandsDict|two/000019430|cephalosporin}}</ref>

Together with [[cephamycin]]s, they constitute a subgroup of β-lactam antibiotics called [[cephem]]s.

==Medical use==
Cephalosporins are indicated for the [[prophylaxis]] and treatment of infections caused by [[bacteria]] susceptible to this particular form of antibiotic. First-generation cephalosporins are active predominantly against [[Gram-positive]] bacteria, and successive generations have increased activity against [[Gram-negative]] bacteria (albeit often with reduced activity against Gram-positive organisms).

==Adverse effects==
Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥ 1% of patients) associated with the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and/or pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal [[candidiasis]], [[pseudomembranous colitis]], [[superinfection]], [[eosinophilia]], and/or fever.

The commonly quoted figure of 10% of patients with allergic hypersensitivity to [[penicillin]]s and/or [[carbapenem]]s also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins,<ref name="pmid1201975">{{Cite journal|author=Dash CH |title=Penicillin allergy and the cephalosporins |journal=J.

==Mechanism of action==
Cephalosporins are [[bactericidal]] and have the same mode of action as other [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s (such as [[penicillin]]s) but are less susceptible to [[Beta-lactamase|penicillinases]]. Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the [[peptidoglycan]] layer of bacterial [[cell wall]]s.  The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity. <!-- , especially in [[Gram-positive]] organisms. Please see discussion for why this was commented out--> The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by [[transpeptidase]]s known as [[penicillin-binding protein]]s (PBPs). PBPs bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala at the end of muropeptides (peptidoglycan precursors) to crosslink the peptidoglycan. [[Beta-lactam antibiotic]]s mimic the D-Ala-D-Ala site, thereby competitively inhibiting PBP crosslinking of peptidoglycan.

==Resistance==
Resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics can involve either reduced affinity of existing penicillin-binding-protein components or the acquisition of a supplementary beta-lactam-insensitive penicillin-binding-protein. Currently, some ''Citrobacter freundii, [[Enterobacter cloacae]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains are resistant to cephalosporin. Some ''[[Morganella morganii]]'', ''[[Proteus vulgaris]], Providencia rettgeri, [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' strains have also developed resistance to cephalosporin to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cephalosporin spectrum of resistance|url=http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/m/?w=cephalosporin|accessdate= 1 July 2012}}</ref>

==Classification==
The cephalosporin nucleus can be modified to gain different properties. Cephalosporins are sometimes grouped into "generations" by their [[antimicrobial]] properties. The first cephalosporins were designated first-generation cephalosporins, whereas, later, more extended-[[spectrum]] cephalosporins were classified as second-generation cephalosporins. Each newer generation has significantly greater [[Gram-negative]] antimicrobial properties than the preceding generation, in most cases with decreased activity against [[Gram-positive]] organisms. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, however, have true broad-spectrum activity.

The classification of cephalosporins into "generations" is commonly practised, although the exact categorization is often imprecise. For example, the fourth generation of cephalosporins is not recognized as such in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In Japan, cefaclor is classed as a first-generation cephalosporin, though in the United States it is a second-generation one; and cefbuperazone, cefminox, and cefotetan are classed as second-generation cephalosporins. Cefmetazole and cefoxitin are classed as third-generation cephems. Flomoxef and latamoxef are in a new class called [[oxacephem]]s.

Most first-generation cephalosporins were originally spelled "ceph-" in English-speaking countries. This continues to be the preferred spelling in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, while European countries (including the United Kingdom) have adopted the [[International Nonproprietary Name]]s, which are always spelled "cef-". Newer first-generation cephalosporins and all cephalosporins of later generations are spelled "cef-", even in the United States.

Some state, although cephalosporins can be divided into five or even six generations, the usefulness of this organization system is of limited clinical relevance.<ref name="urlCase Based Pediatrics Chapter">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s06c05.html |title=Case Based Pediatrics Chapter |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Fourth-generation cephalosporins as of March, 2007, were considered to be "a class of highly potent antibiotics that are among medicine's last defenses against several serious human infections" according to the ''[[Washington Post]]''.<ref name="FDA override">{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/03/AR2007030301311.html
|title=FDA Rules override Warnings about Drugs|work=March 4, 2007 |accessdate=|first=Rick|last=Weiss|date=4 March 2007}}</ref>

The mnemonic "LAME" is used to note organisms against which cephalosporins do not have activity: ''Listeria'', Atypicals (including ''Mycoplasma'' and ''Chlamydia''), [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], and enterococci.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Fifth-generation cephalosporins are effective against MRSA, however.

==History==
{{see also|Discovery and development of cephalosporins}}
Cephalosporin compounds were first isolated from cultures of ''[[Cephalosporium acremonium]]'' from a sewer in [[Sardinia]] in 1948 by Italian scientist [[Giuseppe Brotzu]].<ref>Podolsky, M. Lawrence (1998) ''Cures Out of Chaos: How Unexpected Discoveries Led to Breakthroughs in Medicine and Health'', Harwood Academic Publishers</ref> He noticed these cultures produced substances that were effective against ''[[Salmonella typhi]]'', the cause of [[typhoid fever]], which had [[beta-lactamase]]. [[Guy Newton]] and [[Edward Abraham]] at the [[Sir William Dunn School of Pathology]] at the [[University of Oxford]] isolated [[cephalosporin C]]. The cephalosporin nucleus, [[7-ACA|7-aminocephalosporanic acid]] (7-ACA), was derived from cephalosporin C and proved to be analogous to the [[penicillin]] nucleus [[6-APA|6-aminopenicillanic acid]] (6-APA), but it was not sufficiently potent for clinical use. Modification of the 7-ACA side-chains resulted in the development of useful antibiotic agents, and the first agent [[cefalotin]] (cephalothin) was launched by [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in 1964.
