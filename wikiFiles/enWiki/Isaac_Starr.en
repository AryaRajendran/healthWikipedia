'''Isaac "Ike" Starr''' (March 6, 1895 – June 22, 1989) was an American [[physician]] and [[heart disease]] specialist notable for developing the first practical [[ballistocardiograph]].<ref name=InnovTrad>{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=David Y., III|title=Innovation and Tradition at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine: An Anecdotal Journey|year=1990|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-8242-9|pages=193–6|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/penn_history/6/|coauthors=Marshall A.

==Education==
Starr attended primary and secondary school in [[Philadelphia]], graduating from the [[Chestnut Hill Academy]] in 1912.<ref name=inquirersketch /> From there he went to [[Princeton University]] where he received his [[Bachelor of Science]] (Sc.B.) degree, graduating in 1916.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catalogue of Princeton University|year=1916|publisher=Princeton University|location=Princeton|pages=441|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eJM4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=princeton+university+1916+%22Isaac+Starr%22#v=onepage&q&f=false 441}}</ref> He received his [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] in 1920.<ref name=inquirersketch />

After receiving his M.D., Starr went to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] where he completed his internship before returning to Penn, where he later became a [[heart disease]] specialist, motivated by the heart disease-related death of his mother.<ref name=inquirersketch />

==Career==
After returning to Penn, Starr joined [[Alfred Newton Richards]]’ group investigating mechanisms by which the kidney created urine.<ref name=InnovTrad /> At the request of Richards, Starr became one of the first assistant professors at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] in 1928, doing research which used physics and mathematics in the study of the heart,<ref name=inquirersketch /> and leading a course in [[clinical pharmacology]] for the medical students.<ref name=InnovTrad />

Only a few years later, he participated in a [[cardiac output]] methods program by the [[American Physiological Society]] at which his colleague, Yandell Henderson, demonstrated an apparatus for measuring [[cardiac output]], a [[ballistocardiograph]]. This project, a suspended bed rigged with springs to pick up [[Resonance|resonance frequencies]] and amplify them, inspired Starr to develop a practical version for use in his own research, with the help of the [[Eldridge R. Johnson|Eldridge Reeves Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics]]. This new device used an optical recording system for more accurate readings, however, due to the low natural frequency of [[Heart sounds|heartbeat]]s, patients had to hold their breath while using it. The issue led him to modify the design of the bed to counteract the minute movements using springs, thereby fixing this flaw and allowing the patients to breathe. The final device was used to measure [[cardiac output]] and led to the first accurate physical measurements and also detection for when the [[heart chamber]]s do not contract simultaneously.<ref name=InnovTrad /> The most notable use, however, was that of detecting heart abnormalities much earlier and more accurately in patients, leading to further development and extensive contributions to the field from 1930 to 1960.<ref name=inquirersketch /><ref>{{cite web|title=Accelerating Cardiac Care|url=http://www.heartforcemedical.com/ballistocardiography.html|publisher=Heart Force Medical, Inc.|accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>

In 1933, he became the first Hartzell Professor of Research [[Therapeutics]] at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and held the position until 1961.<ref name=inquirersketch /> The endowed chair funded everything except for salaries for his [[research assistant]]s.<ref name=InnovTrad />

The [[University of Pennsylvania]] awarded Starr with an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Science]] (Sc.D.) degree in 1983 for his contributions to medicine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronological Listing of Honorary Degrees|url=http://www.upenn.edu/commencement/hist/hondegchron.html#1983|work=Penn: Commencement|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref>
