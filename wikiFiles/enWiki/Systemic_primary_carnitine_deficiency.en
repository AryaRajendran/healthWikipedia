'''Systemic primary carnitine deficiency,  (SPCD)''' also known as '''carnitine uptake defect,''' '''carnitine transporter deficiency''' or '''systemic carnitine deficiency''' is an inborn error of fatty acid transport caused by a defect in the transporter responsible for moving [[carnitine]] across the [[plasma membrane]].  When carnitine cannot be transported into tissues, [[fatty acid oxidation]] is impaired, leading to a variety of symptoms such as chronic muscle weakness, [[cardiomyopathy]], [[hypoglycemia]] and liver dysfunction.  The specific transporter involved with SPCD is OCTN2, coded for by the ''[[SLC22A5]]'' gene located on [[chromosome 5 (human)|chromosome 5]].  SPCD is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] manner, with mutated [[allele]]s coming from both parents.

Acute episodes due to SPCD are often preceded by metabolic stress such as extended fasting, infections or vomiting.  Cardiomyopathy can develop in the absence of an acute episode, and can result in death.  SPCD leads to increased carnitine excretion in the urine and low levels in [[blood plasma|plasma]].  In most locations with expanded [[newborn screening]], SPCD can be identified and treated shortly after birth.  Treatment with high doses of carnitine supplementation is effective, but needs to be rigouously maintained for life.

==Signs and symptoms==
The presentation of patient with SPCD can be incredibly varied, from asymptomatic to lethal cardiac manifestations.<ref name=omim>{{cite web|title=#212140; Carnitine Deficiency, Systemic Primary; SPCD|url=http://omim.org/entry/212140|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref>  Early cases were reported with liver dysfunction, muscular findings (weakness and underdevelopment), hypoketotic [[hypoglycemia]], cardiomegaly, [[cardiomyopathy]] and marked [[carnitine]] deficiency in plasma and tissues, combined with increased excretion in urine.<ref name=omim />  Patients who present clinically with SPCD fall into two categories, a metabolic presentation with hypoglycemia and a cardiac presentation characterized by [[cardiomyopathy]].  Muscle weakness can be found with either presentation.<ref name=scriver>{{cite book |last1=Stanley |first1=Charles A. |last2=Bennett |first2=Michael J. |last3=Longo |first3=Nicolo |editor1-first=C.W. |editor1-last=Scriver |editor2-first=A.L. |editor2-last=Beaudet |editor3-first=W.S.|editor3-last=Sly |editor4-first=D.|editor4-last=Valle |others= |title=Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease |edition=8th |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York |language=English |isbn=  | pages= |chapter=Plasma Membrane Carnitine Transport Defect}}</ref>

In countries with expanded newborn screening, SPCD can be identified shortly after birth.  Affected infants show low levels of free carnitine and all other acylcarnitine species by [[tandem mass spectrometry]].<ref name=scriver />  Not all infants with low free carnitine are affected with SPCD.  Some may have carnitine deficiency secondary to another metabolic condition or due to maternal carnitine deficiency.  Proper follow-up of newborn screening results for low free carnitine includes studies of the mother to determine whether her carnitine deficiency is due to SPCD or secondary to a metabolic disease or diet.<ref name=acmg>{{cite web|title=C0 Free Carnitine Low|url=http://www.acmg.net/StaticContent/ACT/Algorithms/Visio-C0.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=American College of Medical Genetics|accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref>  Maternal cases of SPCD have been identified at a higher than expected rate, often in women who are asymptomatic.<ref name=scriver /><ref name=saudubray>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Andrew A.M. |last2=Spiekerkoetter |first2=Ute |editor1-first=Jean-Marie |editor1-last=Saudubray |editor2-first=Georges |editor2-last=van den Berghe |editor3-first=John H. |editor3-last=Walter |others= |title=Inborn Metabolic Diseases:  Diagnosis and Treatment |edition=5th |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |language=English |isbn= 978-3-642-15719-6 | pages=201-216 |chapter=Disorders of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation and Related Metabolic Pathways}}</ref>  Some mothers have also been identified through newborn screening with cardiomyopathy that had not been previously diagnosed.<ref name=maternal>{{cite pmid|20074989}}</ref>  The identification and treatment of these asymptomatic individuals is still developing, as it is not clear whether they require the same levels of intervention as patients identified with SPCD early in life based on clinical presentation.<ref name=scriver />

==Genetics==
SPCD is an [[autosomal recessive]] condition, meaning a mutated [[allele]] must be inherited from each parent for an individual to be affected.<ref name=omim />  The gene responsible for the OCTN2 carnitine transporter is ''SLC22A5'', located at [[chromosome 5 (human)|5q31.1-32]].  ''SLC22A5'' is regulated by [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha]].  The transporter, OCTN2, is located in the apical membrane of the renal tubular cells, where it plays a role in tubular reabsorption.<ref name=scriver />

The defective OCTN2 is unable to recapture carnitine prior to its excretion in urine, leading to the characteristic biochemical findings of massively increased urine carnitine levels and significantly decreased plasma carnitine levels.<ref name=omim />  Decreased levels of plasma carnitine inhibit [[fatty acid oxidation]] during times of excessive energy demand.  Carnitine is needed to transport long chain fatty acids into the [[mitochondria]], where they can be broken down to produce acetyl-CoA.  Individuals with SPCD cannot produce [[ketone bodies]] as energy due to the interruption of fatty acid oxidation.<ref name=scriver />  Although SPCD is an autosomal recessive condition, [[heterozygote]]s have been shown to be at an increased risk for developing [[benign]] cardiomyopathy compared to wild type individuals.<ref name=omim />

==Diagnosis and treatment==
The first suspicion of SPCD in a patient with a non-specific presentation is an extremely low plasma carnitine level.  When combined with an increased concentration of carnitine in urine, the suspicion of SPCD can often be confirmed by either molecular testing or functional studies assessing the uptake of carnitine in cultured [[fibroblasts]].<ref name=scriver />

Identification of patients presymptomatically via [[newborn screening]] has allowed early intervention and treatment.  Treatment for SPCD involves high dose [[carnitine]] supplementation, which must be continued for life.<ref name=scriver />  Individuals who are identified and treated at birth have very good outcomes, including the prevention of cardiomyopathy.<ref name=omim />  Mothers who are identified after a positive newborn screen but are otherwise asymptomatic are typically offered carnitine supplementation as well.  The long-term outcomes for asymptomatic adults with SPCD is not known, but the discovery of mothers with undiagnosed cardiomyopathy and SPCD has raised the possibility that identification and treatment may prevent adult onset manifestations.<ref name=scriver /><ref name=maternal />

==Incidence==
The addition of SPCD to newborn screening panels has offered insight into the incidence of the disorder around the world.  In [[Taiwan]], the incidence of SPCD in newborns was estimated to be approximately 1:67,000, while maternal cases were identified at a higher frequency of approximately 1:33,000.<ref name=maternal />  The increased incidence of SPCD in mothers compares to newborns is not completely understood.<ref name=scriver />  Estimates of SPCD in [[Japan]] have showed a similar incidence of 1:40,000.<ref name=omim />  Worldwide, SPCD has the highest incidence in the relatively genetically isolated [[Faroe Islands]], where an extensive screening program was instituted after the sudden death of two teenagers.  The incidence in the Faroe Islands is approximately 1:200.<ref name=faroe>{{cite web|title=Rare genetic disease common in Faroe Islands: expert|url=http://health.yahoo.net/news/s/afp/healthdiseasegeneticsfaroeislands|publisher=Yahoo!|date=2010-05-27|accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1007/s10545-007-0527-9}}</ref>

==History==
Carnitine deficiency has been extensively studied, although most commonly as a secondary finding to other metabolic conditions.<ref name=omim />  The first case of SPCD was reported in the 1980s, in a child with fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia that resolved after treatment with carnitine supplementation.  Later cases were reported with cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness.  Newborn screening expanded the potential phenotypes associated with SPCD, to include otherwise asymptomatic adults.<ref name=scriver />
