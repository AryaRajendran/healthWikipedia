[[Hemorrhage]] after delivery, or '''postpartum hemorrhage''', is the loss of greater than 500 ml of blood following vaginal delivery, or 1000 ml of blood following cesarean section. It is the most common cause of perinatal maternal death in the developed world and is a major cause of maternal morbidity worldwide.<ref name="anderson">{{cite journal |author=Anderson JM, Etches D |title=Prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage |journal=American Family Physician |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=875â€“82 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17390600 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Causes of postpartum hemorrhage are [[uterine atony]], [[physical trauma|trauma]], retained [[placenta]], and [[coagulopathy]], commonly referred to as the "four Ts":<ref name="anderson"/>
* [[Muscle tone|Tone]]: [[uterine atony]] is the inability of the uterus to contract and may lead to continuous bleeding. Retained placental tissue and infection may contribute to uterine atony.
* [[Physical trauma|Trauma]]: trauma from the delivery may tear tissue and vessels leading to significant postpartum bleeding.
* [[Tissue (biology)|Tissue]]: retention of tissue from the [[placenta]] or [[fetus]] may lead to bleeding.
* [[Thrombin]]: a [[bleeding disorder]] occurs when there is a failure of [[clotting]], such as with diseases known as [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]].

==Management==

===Medication===
Intravenous [[oxytocin]] is the drug of choice for postpartum hemorrhage.  [[Misoprostol]] may also be effective if oxytocin is not available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2809%2961924-3/abstract |title=Treatment of post-partum haemorrhage with sublingual misoprostol versus oxytocin in women not exposed to oxytocin during labour: a double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial : The Lancet |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Protocol===
A detailed stepwise management protocol has been introduced by the California Maternity Quality Care Collaborative.<ref>[http://www.cmqcc.org/resources/ob_hemorrhage/ob_hemorrhage_protocol_tools_release_1_2] CMQCC guidelines, accessed August 10, 2009</ref> It describes 4 stages of obstetrical hemorrhage after a delivery and its application reduces maternal mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barbieri RL |title=Planning reduces the risk of maternal death. This tool helps |journal=OBG Management (2009) 21 (8):8-10}}</ref>
* Stage 0: normal - treated with fundal massage and [[oxytocin]].
* Stage 1:  more than normal bleeding - establish large-bore intravenous access, assemble personnel, increase oxytocin, consider use of [[methergine]], perform fundal massage, prepare 2 units of [[packed red cells]].
* Stage 2: bleeding continues - check coagulation status, assemble response team, move to [[operating room]], place [[intrauterine balloon]],  administer additional [[uterotonic]]s (misoprostol, [[carboprost tromethamine]]), consider: [[uterine artery embolization]], [[dilatation and curettage]], and [[laparotomy]] with uterine compression stitches or hysterectomy.
* Stage 3: bleeding continues - activate [[massive transfusion protocol]], mobilize additional personnel, recheck laboratory tests, perform laparotomy, consider hysterectomy.

A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review suggests that active management (use of uterotonic drugs, cord clamping and controlled cord traction) of the third stage of labour significantly reduces severe maternal bleeding and [[anemia]] compared to [[expectant management]].<ref name=Cochrane>{{cite journal|last=Begley|first=C|coauthors=Gyte G, Devane D, McGuire W, Weeks A|title=Active versus expectant management for women in the third stage of labour|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2011|issue=11|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007412.pub3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007412.pub3/abstract}}</ref>  However, the review also found that active management increased the mother's blood pressure, afterpains, nausea, vomiting, and use of drugs for pain relief. In the active management group more women returned to hospital with bleeding after discharge, and there was also a reduction in birthweight due to infants having a lower blood volume. Another [[Cochrane database]] study,<ref name="Cochrane database 2">{{cite journal | author=Soltani H, Hutchon DR, Poulose TA. | title=Timing of prophylactic uterotonics for the third stage of labour after vaginal birth | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews| doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006173.pub2| year=2010 | editor1-last=Soltani | editor1-first=Hora}}</ref> focusing specifically on the timing of the administration of the uterotonic drug [[oxytocin]] as part of the active management of the third stage of labour, suggested that administering the drug before the expulsion of the placenta did not have any significant influence on the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage when compared to administering the drug after the expulsion of the placenta.
