'''Dental fear''' refers to the [[fear]] of [[dentistry]] and of receiving [[dental care]]. A severe form of this fear ([[specific phobia]]) is variously called '''dental phobia, odontophobia, dentophobia, dentist phobia''', or '''dental anxiety'''. However, it has been suggested not to use the term "dental phobia" for people who do not feel their fears to be excessive or unreasonable and resemble individuals with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], caused by previous traumatic dental experiences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS, Vega EM, Vega CB |title=Posttraumatic dental-care anxiety (PTDA): Is "dental phobia" a misnomer? |journal=Hawaii Dent J |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=17–9 |year=2006 |pmid=17152624 |url=http://cogprints.org/5248/1/2006_HDJ_bracha_vega_posttraumatic_dental_anxiety.PDF}}</ref>

==Prevalence==
It is estimated that as many as 75% of US adults experience some degree of dental fear, from mild to severe.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kleinknecht RA, Thorndike RM, McGlynn FD, Harkavy J |title=Factor analysis of the dental fear survey with cross-validation |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=59–61 |year=1984 |month= January|pmid=6582116 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Getka EJ, Glass CR |title=Behavioral and cognitive-behavioral approaches to the reduction of dental anxiety |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=433–48 |date=Summer 1992 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(05)80168-6 }}</ref><ref name=Handbook>{{cite book |title=Treating Fearful Dental Patients: A Patient Management Handbook |author=Milgrom P, Weinstein P, Getz T |year=1995 |isbn=1-880291-01-0 |edition=2nd |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0528.1996.tb00893.x |publisher=University of Washington, Continuing Dental Education |location=Seattle, Wash. }}</ref> Approximately 5 to 10 percent of U.S. adults are considered to experience dental phobia; that is, they are so fearful of receiving dental treatment that they avoid dental care at all costs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gatchel RJ, Ingersoll BD, Bowman L, Robertson MC, Walker C |title=The prevalence of dental fear and avoidance: a recent survey study |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=609–10 |year=1983 |month= October|pmid=6579095 }}</ref> Many dentally fearful people will only seek dental care when they have a [[dental emergency]], such as a [[toothache]] or [[dental abscess]]. People who are very fearful of dental care often experience a “cycle of avoidance,” in which they avoid dental care due to fear until they experience a dental emergency requiring invasive treatment, which can reinforce their fear of dentistry.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Armfield JM, Stewart JF, Spencer AJ |title=The vicious cycle of dental fear: exploring the interplay between oral health, service utilization and dental fear |journal=BMC Oral Health |volume=7|pages=1 |year=2007 |pmid=17222356 |pmc=1784087 |doi=10.1186/1472-6831-7-1 }}</ref>

==Causes==

===Direct experiences===
Direct experience is the most common way people develop dental fears. Most people report that their dental fear began after a traumatic, difficult, and/or painful dental experience.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Locker D, Shapiro D, Liddell A |title=Negative dental experiences and their relationship to dental anxiety |journal=Community Dent Health |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |year=1996 |month= June|pmid=8763138 }}</ref> However, painful or traumatic dental experiences alone do not explain why people develop dental phobia. The perceived manner of the dentist is an important variable. Dentists who were considered "impersonal", "uncaring", "uninterested" or "cold" were found to result in high dental fear in students, even in the absence of painful experiences, whereas some students who had had painful experiences failed to develop dental fear if they perceived their dentist as caring and warm.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bernstein DA, Kleinknecht RA, Alexander LD |title=Antecedents of dental fear |journal=J Public Health Dent |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=113–24 |year=1979 |pmid=287803 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-7325.1979.tb02932.x }}</ref>

===Indirect experiences===
* '''Vicarious learning''': Dental fear may develop as people hear about others' traumatic experiences or negative views of dentistry (vicarious learning).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hilton IV, Stephen S, Barker JC, Weintraub JA |title=Cultural factors and children's oral health care: a qualitative study of carers of young children |journal=Community Dent Oral Epidemiol |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=429–38 |year=2007 |month= December|pmid=18039284 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0528.2006.00356.x }}</ref>

* '''[[Mass media]]''': The negative portrayal of dentistry in [[mass media]] and [[cartoon]]s may also contribute to the development of dental fear.

* '''Stimulus Generalization''': Dental fear may develop as a result of a previous traumatic experience in a non-dental context. For example, bad experiences with doctors or hospital environments may lead people to fear white coats and antiseptic smells, which is one reason why dentists nowadays often choose to wear less "threatening" apparel. People who have been sexually, physically or emotionally abused may also find the dental situation threatening.<ref>Dental Fear Central (2004). "[http://www.dentalfearcentral.org/abuse_survivors.html Tips for Abuse Survivors and Their Dentists]".</ref>

* '''Helplessness and Perceived Lack of Control''': If a person believes that they have no means of influencing a negative event, they will experience helplessness (see [[Learned helplessness]]). Research has shown that a perception of lack of control leads to fear. The opposite belief, that one does have control, can lead to lessened fear. For example, the belief that the dentist will stop when the patient gives a stop signal lessens fear. Helplessness and lack of control may also result from direct experiences, for example an incident where a dentist wouldn't stop even when the person was in obvious pain.

==Diagnosis==
Phobia of dental care is sometimes diagnosed using a fear measurement instrument like Corah’s Dental Anxiety Scale or the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale.

==Treatment==

Treatments for dental fear often include a combination of [[behavioral]] and [[pharmacological]] techniques. Specialized dental fear clinics use both [[psychologists]] and [[dentists]] to help people learn to manage and decrease their fear of dental treatment. The goal of these clinics is to provide individuals with the fear management skills necessary for them to receive regular dental care with a minimum of fear or anxiety. While specialized clinics exist to help individuals manage and overcome their fear of dentistry, they are rare. Many dental providers outside of such clinics use similar [[behavioral]] and [[cognitive]] strategies to help patients reduce their fear.

Many people who suffer from dental fear may be successfully treated with a combination of "look, see, do" and gentle dentistry.  People fear what they don't understand and they also, logically, dislike pain.  If someone has had one or more painful past experiences in a dental office then their fear is completely rational and they should be treated supportively.  Non-graphic photographs taken pre-operatively, intra-operatively and post-operatively can explain the needed dentistry.  Pharmacologic management may include an anxiety-reducing medication taken in a pill, intravenously and/or using Nitrous Oxide (laughing) gas.  Most importantly is the need to provide an injection of anesthetic extremely gently.<ref>Dorfman J, [http://www.nycdentist.com/landing/dental-phobia-management The Center for Special Dentistry].</ref>  Certain parts of the mouth are much more sensitive than other parts; therefore it is possible to provide local anesthesia (a "novocaine" shot) in the less sensitive area first and then moving the injection within the zone of just-anesthetized tissue to the more sensitive area of the mouth.  This is one example of how a dentist can dramatically reduce the sensation of pain from a "shot."  Another idea is to allow the novocaine time (5 – 15 minutes) to anesthetize the area before beginning dental treatment.

===Behavioral techniques===
Behavioral strategies used by dentists include positive reinforcement (e.g. praising the patient), the use of non-threatening language, and tell-show-do techniques.<ref>[http://www.dentalfearcentral.org/overcome_fear_of_dentist.html Behavioral Techniques for Overcoming Dental Fears]</ref> The tell-show-do technique was originally developed for use in pediatric dentistry, but can also be used with nervous adult patients.<ref>Dental Fear Central. [http://www.dentalfearcentral.org/help/psychology/tell-show-do/ The Tell-Show-Do Technique for Adult Dental Patients].</ref> The technique involves verbal explanations of procedures in easy-to-understand language (tell), followed by demonstrations of the sights, sounds, smells, and [[tactile]] aspects of the procedure in a non-threatening way (show), followed by the actual procedure (do).<ref>American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD). [http://www.aapd.org/media/Policies_Guidelines/G_BehavGuide.pdf Guideline on behavior guidance for the pediatric dental patient]. Chicago (IL) 2006.</ref>

More specialized [[behavioral]] treatments include teaching individuals [[relaxation techniques]], such as [[diaphragmatic breathing]] and [[Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation|progressive muscle relaxation]], as well as [[cognitive]], or thought-based techniques, such as [[cognitive restructuring]] and [[Guided Affective Imagery|guided imagery]].<ref name=Handbook/>  Both relaxation and cognitive strategies have been shown to significantly reduce dental fear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lundgren J, Carlsson SG, Berggren U |title=Relaxation versus cognitive therapies for dental fear—a psychophysiological approach |journal=Health Psychol |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=267–73 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16719597 |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.25.3.267 }}</ref> One example of a behavioral technique is [[systematic desensitization]], a method used in [[psychology]] to overcome [[phobias]] and other [[anxiety disorders]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition |author=Wolpe J |year=1958 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, CA
|url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&safe=off&q=author:%22Wolpe%22+intitle:%22Psychotherapy+by+reciprocal+inhibition.%22+&um=1&ie=UTF-8&oi=scholarr}}</ref> This is also sometimes called graduated exposure therapy or gradual exposure. For example, for a patient who is fearful of dental injections, the therapist first teaches relaxation skills to the patient, then gradually introduces the feared object (in this case, the needle and/or syringe) to the patient, encouraging the patient to manage his/her fear using the relaxation skills previously taught.  The patient progresses through the steps of receiving a dental injection while using the relaxation skills, until the patient is able to successfully receive a dental injection while experiencing little to no fear.  This method has been shown to be effective in treating fear of dental injections.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coldwell SE, Wilhelm FH, Milgrom P, ''et al.'' |title=Combining alprazolam with systematic desensitization therapy for dental injection phobia |journal=J Anxiety Disord |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=871–87 |year=2007 |pmid=17320345 |doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2007.01.001 }}</ref>
[[Cognitive restructuring]], if applied in a non-threatening situation, might be a useful alternative as a first step after years of avoidance of dental care and less threatening than immediate exposure to the feared stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Jongh A, Muris P, ter Horst G, van Zuuren F, Schoenmakers N, Makkes P |title=One-session cognitive treatment of dental phobia: preparing dental phobics for treatment by restructuring negative cognitions |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=947–54 |year=1995 |month= November|pmid=7487854 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/000579679500027U |doi=10.1016/0005-7967(95)00027-U}}</ref>

It is interesting to take into account the views of people who have been provided with behavioural treatments for dental fear. From a [[psychologist]]'s perspective, techniques such as graded exposure, relaxation techniques or challenging catastrophic thinking are important. However, it has been noted that from the [[patient]]'s perspective, interventions can be conceptualized quite differently.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kent G |editor=Davey, Graham |title=Phobias: a handbook of theory, research and treatment |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |pages=107–27 |year=1997 |isbn=0-471-96983-4}}</ref> He argues that high levels of anxiety or phobia should not be considered as residing simply within the individual or in the individual's perceptions of dental care, but more within the relationship with the dentist. For example, when patients who had successfully completed a cognitive-behavioural programme were asked what had helped them to tolerate treatment, they mentioned factors such as the provision of information, the time taken, being put in control by the dentist, and the dentist understanding and listening to their concerns.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith T, Getz T, Milgrom P, Weinstein P |title=Evaluation of treatment at a dental fears research clinic |journal=Special Care in Dentistry |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=130–4 |year=1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1754-4505.1987.tb00622.x |pmid=2954240 }}</ref> Such findings suggest that an interpersonal model of anxiety and anxiety-reduction is useful when trying to understand and treat dental fears.

Certain aspects of the physical environment also play an important role in alleviating dental fear. For example, getting rid of the smells traditionally associated with dentistry, the dental team wearing non-clinical clothes, or playing music in the background can all help patients by removing and replacing stimuli which can trigger feelings of fear (see [[classical conditioning]]). Some anxious patients respond well to more obvious distraction techniques such as listening to music, watching movies, or even using virtual-reality headsets during treatment.<ref>Jerome, Lloyd (2004). "[http://www.dentalfearcentral.org/distraction_dentistry.html The Art and Science of Distraction]".</ref>

===Pharmacological techniques===
Pharmacological techniques to manage dental fear range from mild [[sedation]] to [[general anesthesia]], and are often used by dentists in conjunction with [[behavioral]] techniques.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Milgrom P, Heaton LJ |title=Enhancing sedation treatment for the long- term: pre-treatment behavioural exposure |journal=SAAD Dig |volume=23 |issue= |pages=29–34 |year=2007 |month= January|pmid=17265912 }}</ref> One common anxiety-reducing medication used in dentistry is [[nitrous oxide]] (also known as “laughing gas”), which is inhaled through a mask worn on the nose and causes feelings of relaxation and dissociation. Dentists may prescribe an oral sedative, such as a [[benzodiazepine]] like [[temazepam]] ([[Restoril]]), [[alprazolam]] ([[Xanax]]), [[diazepam]] ([[Valium]]), or [[triazolam]] (Halcion). [[Triazolam]] (Halcion) is not available in the UK.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dyer C |title=European court upholds UK ban on Halcion |journal=BMJ |volume=318 |issue=7181 |pages=418 |date=13 February 1999|pmid=9974446 |pmc=1114899 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7181/418/a }}</ref> While these sedatives may help people feel calmer and sometimes drowsy during dental treatment, patients are still conscious and able to communicate with the dental staff.  Intravenous sedation uses benzodiazepines administered directly intravenously into a patient’s arm or hand. IV sedation is often referred to as “[http://www.sedationregulations.com/content/sedation-dentistry conscious sedation]” as opposed to general anesthesia (GA). In IV sedation, patients breathe on their own while their breathing and heart rate are monitored and are still responsive to a dentist's prompts. In GA, patients are more deeply sedated and unable to breathe on their own and are not responsive to verbal or physical prompts.

===Self-help and peer support===
Recent research has focused on the role of online communities in helping people to confront their anxiety or phobia and successfully receive dental care. The findings suggest that certain individuals do appear to benefit from their involvement in dental anxiety online support groups.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buchanan H, Coulson NS |title=Accessing dental anxiety online support groups: an exploratory qualitative study of motives and experiences |journal=Patient Educ Couns |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=263–9 |year=2007 |month= June|pmid=17320336 |doi=10.1016/j.pec.2006.12.011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Coulson NS, Buchanan H |title=Self-reported efficacy of an online dental anxiety support group: a pilot study |journal=Community Dent Oral Epidemiol |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=43–6 |year=2008 |month= February|pmid=18205639 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0528.2007.00349.x }}</ref>

== Dental fear in children  ==
Dental phobia or [http://www.dentalfearcentral.org/fears/dental-phobia/ dental fear], and dental anxiety have been used interchangeably in the dental literature to describe the overwhelming discomfort that some youth and adults experience in dental situations. The prevalence of dental anxeity (fear or phobia) in children and adolescents is between 5.7% and 19%. Klingberg & Broberg <ref>. Klingberg G, Broberg  AG. Dental fear/anxiety and dental behaviour management problems in children and adolescents: a review of prevalence and concomitant psychological factors. Int J Paediatr Dent. 2007;17(6):391-406.</ref> reviewed these studies and estimated that about 9% of children and adolescents suffer from the condition. 
In the literature, dental phobia is categorised as a specific phobia – like [[Needle phobia]]. It is difficult to differentiate between Dental Behaviour Management Problems(DBMP) and dental phobia. DBMP is defined as disruptive behaviour that counteracts cooperation and makes dental care difficult or impossible. About 27% of children with DBMP present dental fear and 61% of children with dental phobia have DBMP.

=== Cognitive behaviour therapy for children ===
Several studies show that psychological methods based on exposure treatment such as [[Cognitive Behaviour Therapy|Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)]] are effective for dealing with various anxiety disorders. A meta-analysis of CBT studies for children and adolescents found CBT to be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders such as specific phobias.<ref>.Compton SN, March JS, Brent D, Albano AM, Weersing R, Curry J. Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for anxiety and depressive disorders in children and adolescents: an evidence-based medicine review. J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2004;43(8):930-959.</ref> 
A number of studies have investigated the effect of cognitive and behavioural therapeutic methods in conjunction with treatment of dental anxiety in adults.<ref>.Kvale G, Berggren U, Milgrom P. Dental fear in adults: a meta-analysis of behavioral interventions. Community Dent Oral Epidemiol. 2004;32(4):250-264.</ref> The fundamental basis of CBT is the exposure principle,supported by home exercises with parental assistance.
