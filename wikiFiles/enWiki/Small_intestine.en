The '''small intestine''' (or '''small bowel''') is the part of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] following the [[stomach]] and followed by the [[large intestine]], and is where much of the [[digestion]] and absorption of food takes place. In [[invertebrates]] such as worms, the terms "gastrointestinal tract" and "large intestine" are often used to describe the entire [[intestine]]. This article is primarily about the [[human anatomy|human]] [[Gut (zoology)|gut]], though the information about its processes is directly applicable to most placental mammals. The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals found in food.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/275485/human-body</ref> (A major exception to this is [[cow]]s; for information about digestion in cows and other similar mammals, see [[ruminant]]s.)

==Size and divisions==
The average length of the small intestine in an adult human male is 6.9 m (22 feet 6 inches), and in the adult female 7.1 m (23 feet 4 inches). It can vary greatly, from as short as 4.6 m (15 feet) to as long as 9.8 m (32 feet).<ref name=Elsevier>{{cite web | title = Elsevier: Gray's Anatomy, 40th Edition | url = http://www.bartleby.com/107/248.html#txt168}}</ref><ref name=LeaBro>{{cite web | title = Lea Brothers and Co. 1907: Surgical Applied Anatomy  | url = http://www.archive.org/stream/surgicalapplieda1907trev#page/n7/mode/2up}}</ref>
It is approximately 2.5–3&nbsp;cm in diameter.

The small intestine is divided into three structural parts:
* '''[[Duodenum]]'''
* '''[[Jejunum]]'''
* '''[[Ileum]]'''

==Histology==
[[Image:Small intestine low mag.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Micrograph]] of the '''small intestine''' [[mucosa]] showing the [[intestinal villi]] and [[crypts of Lieberkühn]].]]
The three sections of the small intestine look similar to each other at a microscopic level, but there are some important differences.
The parts of the intestine are as follows:

==Digestion and absorption==
Food from the stomach is allowed into the duodenum through the [[pylorus]] by a muscle called the pyloric sphincter.

===Digestion===
The small intestine is where most chemical digestion takes place.  Most of the [[digestive enzyme]]s that act in the small intestine are secreted by the [[pancreas]] and enter the small intestine via the [[pancreatic duct]]. Enzymes enter the small intestine in response to the hormone [[cholecystokinin]], which is produced in the small intestine in response to the presence of nutrients. The hormone [[secretin]] also causes [[bicarbonate]] to be released into the small intestine from the pancreas in order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach.

The three major classes of nutrients that undergo digestion are [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s (fats) and [[carbohydrate]]s:

*  Proteins are degraded into small [[peptide]]s and [[amino acid]]s before absorption.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silk DB |title=Progress report. Peptide absorption in man|journal=Gut |volume=15|issue=6|pages=494–501|year=1974|pmid= 4604970 |pmc=1413009 }}</ref> Chemical breakdown begins in the stomach and continues in the small intestine. Proteolytic enzymes, including [[trypsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]], are secreted by the [[pancreas]] and cleave proteins into smaller peptides. Carboxypeptidase, which is a pancreatic brush border enzyme, splits one amino acid at a time. Aminopeptidase and dipeptidase free the end amino acid products.
* Lipids (fats) are degraded into [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. Pancreatic lipase breaks down [[triglyceride|triglycerides]] into free fatty acids and [[monoglyceride|monoglycerides]]. Pancreatic lipase works with the help of the salts from the [[bile]] secreted by the [[liver]] and the [[gall bladder]]. Bile salts attach to triglycerides to help [[emulsion|emulsify]] them, which aids access by pancreatic lipase. This occurs because the lipase is water-soluble but the fatty triglycerides are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards each other and away from the watery intestinal surroundings. The bile salts emulsify the triglycerides in the watery surroundings until the lipase can break them into the smaller components that are able to enter the villi for absorption.
* Some [[carbohydrate]]s are degraded into simple sugars, or [[monosaccharide]]s (e.g., [[glucose]]). Pancreatic amylase breaks down some carbohydrates (notably [[starch]]) into oligosaccharides. Other carbohydrates pass undigested into the large intestine and further handling by [[intestinal bacteria]]. Brush border enzymes take over from there. The most important brush border enzymes are dextrinase and glucoamylase which further break down oligosaccharides. Other brush border enzymes are maltase, sucrase and lactase. Lactase is absent in most adult humans and for them lactose, like most poly-saccharides, are not digested in the small intestine. Some carbohydrates, such as [[cellulose]], are not digested at all, despite being made of multiple [[glucose]] units. This is because the cellulose is made out of beta-glucose, making the inter-monosaccharidal bindings different from the ones present in starch, which consists of alpha-glucose. Humans lack the enzyme for splitting the beta-glucose-bonds, something reserved for herbivores and bacteria from the large intestine.

===Absorption===
Digested food is now able to pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine through the process of [[diffusion]]. The small intestine is the site where most of the nutrients from ingested food are absorbed. The inner wall, or mucosa, of the small intestine is lined with simple columnar [[intestinal epithelium|epithelial]] tissue. Structurally, the mucosa is covered in wrinkles or folds called [[plicae circulares]], which are considered permanent features in the wall of the organ. They are distinct from [[rugae]] which are considered non-permanent or temporary allowing for distention and contraction. From the plicae circulares project microscopic finger-like pieces of tissue called [[intestinal villus|villi]] ([[Latin]] for "shaggy hair"). The individual epithelial cells also have finger-like projections known as [[microvilli]]. The function of the plicae circulares, the villi and the microvilli is to increase the amount of surface area available for the absorption of [[nutrient]]s.

Each villus has a network of [[capillary|capillaries]] and fine lymphatic vessels called [[lacteal]]s close to its surface. The epithelial cells of the villi transport nutrients from the lumen of the intestine into these capillaries (amino acids and carbohydrates) and lacteals (lipids). The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as the proteins required by our body. The food that remains undigested and unabsorbed passes into the large intestine.

Absorption of the majority of nutrients takes place in the [[jejunum]], with the following notable exceptions:
* [[Iron]] is absorbed in the duodenum.
* [[Vitamin B12]] and [[bile salts]] are absorbed in the [[terminal ileum]].
* Water and [[lipids]] are absorbed by passive diffusion throughout the small intestine.
* [[Sodium bicarbonate]] is absorbed by active transport and [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]] [[co-transport]].
* [[Fructose]] is absorbed by [[facilitated diffusion]].

==Conditions affecting the small intestine==
The small intestine is a complex organ, and as such, there are a very large number of possible conditions that may affect the function of the small bowel.  A few of them are listed below, some of which are common, with up to 10% of people being affected at some time in their lives, while others are vanishingly rare.

==In other animals==
The small intestine is found in all [[tetrapod]]s and also in [[teleost]]s, although its form and length vary enormously between species. In teleosts, it is relatively short, typically around one and a half times the length of the fish's body. It commonly has a number of ''pyloric caeca'', small pouch-like structures along its length that help to increase the overall surface area of the organ for digesting food. There is no ileocaecal valve in teleosts, with the boundary between the small intestine and the [[rectum]] being marked only by the end of the digestive epithelium.<ref name=VB/>

In tetrapods, the [[ileocaecal valve]] is always present, opening into the colon. The length of the small intestine is typically longer in tetrapods than in teleosts, but is especially so in [[herbivore]]s, as well as in mammals and [[bird]]s, which have a higher [[metabolic rate]] than [[amphibian]]s or [[reptile]]s. The lining of the small intestine includes microscopic folds to increase its surface area in all vertebrates, but only in mammals do these develop into true villi.<ref name=VB/>

The boundaries between the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum are somewhat vague even in humans, and such distinctions are either ignored when discussing the anatomy of other animals, or are essentially arbitrary.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 349–353|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>

There is no small intestine as such in non-teleost fish, such as [[shark]]s, [[sturgeon]]s, and [[lungfish]]. Instead, the digestive part of the gut forms a '''spiral intestine''', connecting the stomach to the rectum. In this type of gut, the intestine itself is relatively straight, but has a long fold running along the inner surface in a spiral fashion, sometimes for dozens of turns. This valve greatly increases both the surface area and the effective length of the intestine. The lining of the spiral intestine is similar to that of the small intestine in teleosts and non-mammalian tetrapods.<ref name=VB/>

In [[lamprey]]s, the spiral valve is extremely small, possibly because their diet requires little digestion. [[Hagfish]] have no spiral valve at all, with digestion occurring for almost the entire length of the intestine, which is not subdivided into different regions.<ref name=VB/>
