'''Wolff's law''' is a theory developed by the German anatomist and surgeon [[Julius Wolff]] (1836–1902) in the 19th century that states that bone in a healthy person or animal will adapt to the loads under which it is placed.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[Anahad O'Connor]] |coauthors= |title=The Claim: After Being Broken, Bones Can Become Even Stronger |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/health/19really.html?ref=science |quote=This concept — that bone adapts to pressure, or a lack of it — is known as Wolff’s law. ... there is no evidence that a bone that breaks will heal to be stronger than it was before.|work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 18, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-19 }}</ref>  If loading on a particular bone increases, the bone will remodel itself over time to become stronger to resist that sort of loading.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1994 |last1=Frost |first1=HM |journal=The Angle Orthodontist |volume=64 |issue=3|pages=175–188 |pmid=8060014 |title=Wolff's Law and bone's structural adaptations to mechanical usage: an overview for clinicians}}</ref> The internal architecture of the [[trabecula]]e undergoes adaptive changes, followed by secondary changes to the external cortical portion of the bone,<ref>Stedman's Medical Dictionary</ref> perhaps becoming thicker as a result. The inverse is true as well: if the loading on a bone decreases, the bone will become weaker due to turnover, it is less metabolically costly to maintain and there is no stimulus for continued [[bone remodeling|remodeling]] that is required to maintain bone mass.<ref name="Wolff1">Wolff J.

==Mechanotransduction==
The remodeling of bone in response to loading is achieved via mechanotransduction, a process through which forces or other mechanical signals are converted to biochemical signals in cellular signaling.<ref name="Huang 2010">{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Chenyu|coauthors=Rei Ogawa|title=Mechanotransduction in bone repair and regeneration|journal=The FASEB Journal|year=2010|month=October|volume=24}}</ref> Mechanotransduction leading to bone remodeling involve the steps of mechanocoupling, biochemical coupling, signal transmission, and cell response.<ref name="Duncan 1995 344–358">{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=RL|coauthors=CH Turner|title=Mechanotransduction and the functional response of bone to mechanical strain|journal=Calcified Tissue International|year=1995|month=November|volume=57|issue=5|pages=344–358}}</ref> The specific effects on bone structure depends on the duration, magnitude and rate of loading, and it has been found that only cyclic loading can induce bone formation.<ref name="Duncan 1995 344–358"/> When loaded, fluid flows away from areas of high compressive loading in the bone matrix.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=CH|coauthors=MR Forwood, MW Otter|title=Mechanotransduction in bone: do bone cells act as sensors of fluid flow?|journal=The FASEB journal|year=1994|volume=8|issue=11}}</ref> Osteocytes are the most abundant cells in bone and are also the most sensitive to such fluid flow caused by mechanical loading.<ref name="Huang 2010"/> Upon sensing a load, osteocytes regulate bone remodeling by signaling to other cells with signaling molecules or direct contact.<ref name="Chen 2010">{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jan-Hung|coauthors=Chao Liu, Lidan You, Craig A Simmons|title=Boning up on Wolff’s Law: Mechanical regulation of the cells that make and maintain bone|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|year=2010|volume=43}}</ref> Additionally, osteoprogenitor cells, which may differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts, are also mechanosensors and may differentiate one way or another depending on the loading condition.<ref name="Chen 2010"/>

==Examples==
[[Image:Tim Henman backhand volley Wimbledon 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Tennis]] players often use one arm more than the other]]
*The [[racquet]]-holding arm bones of [[tennis]] players become much stronger than those of the other arm. Their bodies have strengthened the bones in their racquet-holding arm since it is routinely placed under higher than normal stresses. The most critical loads on a tennis player's arms occur during the serve. There are four main phases of a tennis serve and the highest loads occur during external shoulder rotation and ball impact. The combination of high load and arm rotation result in a twisted bone density profile.<ref>{{cite web|title=The phenomenon of twisted growth: humeral torsion in dominant arms of high performance tennis players.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18654877|publisher=Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin|accessdate=27 Feb 13|author=Taylor RE|coauthors=Zheng c, Jackson RP, Doll JC, Chen JC, Holzbar KR, Besier T, Kuhl E}}</ref> 
* [[Surfing|Surfers]] who knee-paddle frequently will develop bone bumps, also known as [[Exostosis|exostoses]], on the tibial eminence and the dorsal part of the [[Navicular bone|navicular tarsal bone]] from the pressure of the surfboard's surface. These are often called [[Surfer's knots|surf knots]]
* [[Astronaut]]s who spend a long time in space will often return to Earth with weaker bones, since gravity has been greatly diminished and therefore has exerted little force on their bodies.
* [[Weightlifter]]s often display increases in [[bone density]] in response to their training.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/strength-training/HQ01710 |title=Strength training: Get stronger, leaner, healthier |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |year=2010 |work= |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Education and Medical Research|accessdate=19 October 2012 }}</ref>
* [[Martial artist]]s who strike objects with increasing intensity (e.g., repeated elbow strikes), display increases in bone density in the striking area.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} This process is termed [[bone remodeling|cortical remodeling]].
