'''Aseptic meningitis''', or sterile meningitis, is a condition in which the layers lining the brain, [[meninges]], become [[inflammation|inflamed]] and a [[pyogenic]] [[bacteria]]l source is not to blame.  [[Meningitis]] is diagnosed on a history of characteristic symptoms and certain examination findings (e.g., [[Woldemar Kernig|Kernig's sign]]).  Investigations should show an increase in the number of [[leukocytes]] present in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), obtained via [[lumbar puncture]], (normal being fewer than five visible per microscopic [[High Power Field]]).

The term ''aseptic'' is frequently a [[misnomer]], implying a lack of [[infection]].  On the contrary, many cases of aseptic meningitis represent infection with viruses<ref>{{DorlandsDict|five/000064654|aseptic meningitis}}</ref> or [[mycobacteria]] that cannot be detected with routine methods.  While the advent of [[polymerase chain reaction]] has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such as [[enterovirus]], [[cytomegalovirus]], and [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes virus]] in the CSF, many viruses can still escape detection.  Additionally, mycobacteria frequently require special stains and [[culture]] methods that make their detection difficult.  When CSF findings are consistent with meningitis, and [[microbiology|microbiologic]] testing is unrevealing, clinicians typically assign the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis&mdash;making it a relative [[diagnosis of exclusion]].

Aseptic meningitis can result from non-infectious causes; it is a relatively infrequent side effect of medications, and can be an early finding in [[autoimmune disease]].

There is no formal classification system.  It is usually by the causative [[organism]] if identified.

"Aseptic meningitis", like [[non-gonococcal urethritis]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] and [[atypical pneumonia]], merely states what a condition is not, not what a condition is. Terms such as [[viral meningitis]], [[bacterial meningitis]], [[fungal meningitis]], [[neoplastic meningitis]] and [[drug-induced aseptic meningitis]] can provide more information about the condition, and without using one of these more specific terms, it is difficult to describe treatment options or prognosis.
