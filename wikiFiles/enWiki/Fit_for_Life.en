{{italic title}}
'''''Fit for Life''''' (FFL) is a diet and lifestyle book series stemming from the principles of [[Orthopathy|Natural Hygiene]]. It is promoted mainly by the [[United States|American]] writers Harvey and Marilyn Diamond.<ref name=gale/> The ''Fit for Life'' book series recommends dietary principles  including eating only fruit in the morning, eating predominantly "live" and "high-water-content" food, and if eating animal protein to avoid combining it with [[Polysaccharide|complex carbohydrates]].

While the diet has been praised for encouraging the consumption of raw fruits and vegetables, several other aspects of the diet have been disputed by dietitians and nutritionists,<ref name=gale>{{cite book|author=Tish Davidson|chapter=Fit for Life diet|title=The Gale Encyclopedia of Diets: A Guide to Health and Nutrition|editors=Jacqueline L. Longe|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|year=2007|isbn=1-4144-2991-6|page=383&ndash;385}}</ref> and the [[American Dietetic Association]] and the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] list it as a [[fad diet]].<ref>http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/media_11092_ENU_HTML.htm</ref><ref>http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/healthy/food/improve/784.html</ref>

==Description==
The diet is based on Diamond's exploration of [[Herbert M. Shelton]] theories of  [[food combining]]. Both authors claimed to be able to bring about weight loss without the need to count calories or undertake anything more than a reasonable exercise program. In the first version of the program, Diamond claimed that if one eats the foods in the wrong combination they "cause fermentation" in the stomach. This in turns gives rise to the destruction of valuable enzymes & nutrients. Diamond categorized foods into two groups : "dead foods" that "clog" the body, and "living foods" that "cleanse" it. According to Fit for Life principles, dead foods are those that have highly refined or highly processed origins; while living foods are raw fruits and vegetables. The basic points of Fit for Life are as follows:<ref name=gale/>

* [[Fruits]] are best eaten fresh and raw. Where possible they should be eaten alone.
* [[Carbohydrates]] & [[Proteins]] should never be combined in the one meal.
* Water dilutes stomach digestive juices and should never be drunk at meals.
* [[Dairy product]]s are considered of limited value and due to their allergic capacity, should seldom, if ever, be eaten.

In the 2000s, the Fit for Life system added the Personalized FFL Weight Management Program, which employs proprietary protocols called Biochemical "Analyzation", Metabolic Typing and Genetic Predispositions. The Diamonds claim that these protocols allow the personalization of the diet, which thus customized is effective only for one individual, and can be used for that person's entire life. This version of the diet also puts less emphasis on "live" and "dead" foods, and instead talks of "enzyme deficient foods." The Diamonds posit that enzymes that digest proteins interfere with enzymes that digest carbohydrates, justifying some of the rules above. They also began to sell [[nutritional supplement]]s, advertised as enzyme supplements, many of which are strongly recommended in the newest version of FFL.<ref name=gale/>

==Publications and marketing==
The diet came to public attention in the mid-1980s with the publication of ''Fit for Life'', a [[New York Times]] best seller<ref name="1986bestsellers">{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7DB1E38F936A35752C0A960948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink | title = BEST SELLERS | date = 1986-01-05 | publisher = New York Times | accessdate = 2009-02-09 }}</ref><ref name="1987bestsellers">{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D81639F935A35752C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | title = Best Sellers From 1987's Book Crop | date = 1988-01-06 | publisher = New York Times | accessdate = 2009-02-09 | first=Edwin | last=McDowell}}</ref> which sold millions of copies,<ref name=gale/><ref name="MediaBusiness">{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD8163EF932A35751C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink | title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing; Where literary lightning hits, book houses often hope for a second strike | last = Fein | first = Esther B. | date = 1993-02-01 | publisher = New York Times | accessdate = 2009-02-09 }}</ref> over 12 million according to Harvey Diamond.<ref name="Diamond2003">{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Harvey|title=Fit for life, not fat for life|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1bagUcM87rYC&pg=PA82&dq=%22fit+for+life%22+%2212+million%22|date=2003-11-17|publisher=HCI|isbn=978-0-7573-0113-1|page=82}}</ref> Harvey Diamond has also appeared on dozens of television talk shows promoting his theories.<ref name=gale/> In ''Fit for Life II'' (1989) the Diamonds warned against eating artificial food additives such as [[hydrogenated vegetable oil]], which at the time was being promoted by the food industry as a healthy alternative to [[saturated fat]]. [[Tony Robbins]] promoted the ''Fit for Life'' principles and [[veganism]] to increase energy levels in his book ''[[Unlimited Power]]''.

==Controversy==
===Nutrition related===
Harvey Diamond's competence to write about nutrition has been contested because his doctoral degree came from the [[American College of Life Science]], a non-accredited correspondence school founded in 1982 by T.C. Fry, a high-school dropout. FFL's personalized diet program has been criticized for providing a "Clinical Manual" that is heavily infused with [[alternative medicine]] claims about how the body works, which are scientifically inaccurate and not accepted by conventional medicine.<ref name=gale/>

Despite the fact that FFL web site mentioned "clinical trials", the principles and benefits of FFL diet are not supported by scholarly research, and some of the claims have actually been directly refuted by scientific research. For example, a [[dissociated diet]] as that advertised by FFL is no more effective for weight loss than a calorie-restricted diet.<ref name=gale/><ref name="pmid10805507">{{cite journal |author=Golay A, Allaz AF, Ybarra J, ''et al.'' |title=Similar weight loss with low-energy food combining or balanced diets |journal=[[Int.
