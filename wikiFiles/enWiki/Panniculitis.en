'''Panniculitis''' is a group of diseases whose hallmark is [[inflammation]] of [[subcutaneous]] [[adipose]] tissue (the fatty layer under the skin - [[panniculus adiposus]]).<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000077803|panniculitis}}</ref> Symptoms include tender skin [[Nodule (dermatology)|nodules]], and systemic signs such as [[weight loss]] and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]].

Restated, an inflammatory disorder primarily localized in the subcutaneous fat is termed a "panniculitis," a group of disorders that may be challenging both for the clinician and the dermatopathologist.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|487}}

==Classification==
===Histological===
It can occur in any fatty tissue ([[cutaneous]] or visceral) and is often diagnosed on the basis of a deep skin [[biopsy]], and can be further classified by [[histological]] characteristics based on the location of the inflammatory cells (within fatty lobules or in the septa which separate them) and on the presence or absence of [[vasculitis]].

There are thus four main histological subtypes:<ref name="urlPanniculitis. DermNet NZ">{{cite web |url=http://dermnetnz.org/dermal-infiltrative/panniculitis.html |title=Panniculitis. DermNet NZ |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref>

===Symptomatic===
Panniculitis can also be classified based on the presence or absence of systemic [[symptoms]]:
* Panniculitis without systemic disease can be a result of [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or cold;<ref name="titleeMedicine - Cold Panniculitis : Article by Geromanta Baleviciene">{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic781.htm |title=eMedicine - Cold Panniculitis : Article by Geromanta Baleviciene |accessdate=2008-03-25 |format= |work=}}</ref> 
* Panniculitis with systemic disease can be caused...
** by [[connective tissue]] disorders such as [[lupus erythematosus]] or [[scleroderma]]; 
** by [[lymphoproliferative]] disease such as [[lymphoma]] or [[histiocytosis]]; 
** by [[pancreatitis]] or [[pancreatic cancer]]; 
** by sarcoidosis with cutaneous involvement (seen in up to 20 percent)
** and by many other causes.
** [[Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]], also, is a major cause of Panniculitis.

==Associated conditions==
[[Lipoatrophy]] or [[lipodystrophy]] (the loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue) can occur in any of these conditions.
