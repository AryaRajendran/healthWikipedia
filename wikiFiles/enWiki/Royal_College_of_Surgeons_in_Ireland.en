The '''Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland''' ('''RCSI'''), ({{lang-ga|Coláiste Ríoga na Máinleá in Éirinn}}) is a [[Dublin]]-based medical institution, situated on [[St. Stephen's Green]]. The college is one of the five ''Recognised Colleges'' of the [[National University of Ireland]]. The college dates back to 1784 and at present incorporates schools of [[medicine]], [[physiotherapy]], [[pharmacy]] and [[nursing]], providing both undergraduate and postgraduate levels of medical education.

Among medical institutions outside Ireland, the use of the term "[[Royal College of Surgeons|Royal College]]" currently indicates an oversight body for postgraduate medical education. RCSI performs such a function, but it is unique among the four Royal Colleges of Surgeons (Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow]], and [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]) in that 100 years after its establishment, an undergraduate medical school was founded and this is now Ireland’s largest medical school with over 3000 students from 60 countries. The RCSI is a sister institute of the Royal Surgical Colleges of the United Kingdom (London, Glasgow and Edinburgh).

==History==
Since medieval times, the practice of [[surgery]] was licensed by the Barber-Surgeons' [[Guild]], also known at the time as the Guild of St. [[Mary Magdalene]]. The guild chapel was in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christchurch]]. Guild membership at that time was obtained by a 3 year [[apprenticeship]] followed by 2 years as a master. In fact the College of Surgeons maintained a mandatory period of apprenticeship to a qualified surgeon until 1828. In 1446, the Barber-Surgeons' guild was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by royal decree of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], becoming the first medical [[Livery Company|corporation]] in the British Isles. 

In 1765 [[Sylvester O'Halloran]], a surgeon from [[Limerick]], had proposed a College of Surgeons along the lines of the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been regulating French surgeons since it had been created by Royal Charter by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1255, to train and regulate surgeons.<ref>The ''Proposals for the Advancement of Surgery in Ireland''.</ref> The Dublin Society of Surgeons’ was founded in 1780 at the Elephant public house on Essex street (now Parliament street). [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity]] did not teach [[surgery]] as a subject until 1851, so Ireland was entirely without a school focused on surgery. 

To have a separate organisation focused on providing standardised surgical education became one of the goals of the society and they lobbied for a Royal Charter, in 1781 presenting the [[lord lieutenant]] a petition to be incorporated separately from the [[barbers]].  The awaited [[charter]] was granted by [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] on 11 February 1784. The governing body, including the first President Samuel Croker-King and William Dease, first professor of surgery, met in the boardroom of the [[Rotunda Hospital]] for the first time on 2 March. Most importantly, admission or employment was not discriminated against on sectarian grounds. Two of its chief founders, Sylvester O’Halloran and William Dease as well as eleven out of its first 57 presidents were Catholic. The college also recognised the medical qualifications given by the Catholic university from 1856, which gave legitimacy to their diplomas. 

The first candidate for examination was John Birch, in August 1784.

The current location, at the corner of York Street, was acquired in September 1805, with additional land at Glover’s Alley bought in 1809. It was previously an abandoned [[Quaker]] [[Friends Burial Ground, Dublin|burial ground]]. The Duke of Bedford laid the first stone of the new building on St. Patrick’s Day, 1806 and building reached completion in March 1810. 

A supplemental charter was granted by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1844, dividing medical graduates into Licentiates and Fellows. Initially, physicians were trained alongside surgeons.  In 1886 these two disciplines were merged, and the medical school began operation. As a result of this historical legacy, graduates of medicine still receive Licentiate diplomas from the two Royal Colleges as well as now being awarded MB ([[Bachelor of Medicine]]) BCh ([[Bachelor of Surgery]]) and BAO ([[Obstetrics|Bachelor of the Art of Obstetrics]]) degrees by the [[National University of Ireland]].

During the [[1916 Rising]], the main college building on [[St Stephen's Green]] was occupied by rebel Irish forces, led by [[Constance Markievicz|Countess Markievicz]]. 

Now defunct subjects taught include: Logic (1852–1862), Military Surgery (1851–1860), [[Botany]] (1792–1889) and Hygiene or Political Medicine (1841–1921, then united with chair of Medical Jurisprudence).

The RCSI [[motto]], "Consilio Manuque", was adopted from the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been afforded the motto by [[Louis XIV]]. It was originally "Consiloque Manuque", his personal motto.

The Royal College of Surgeons is the first [[medical school|medical institution of learning]] to offer a [[Graduate Medical Program (GMP)|4-year graduate entry programme]] for medicine in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

Since the 1980s [[Beaumont Hospital, Dublin]] has been the principal centre for medical training. Other affiliated hospitals include teaching hospitals such as [[Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown|Connolly Hospital]].

==Academic structure==
===Undergraduate Faculties===
*School of Medicine (5 or 6 year programme, 4 year Graduate Entry Programme)
*School of Pharmacy
*School of Physiotherapy

===Postgraduate Faculties===
*[[Faculty of Dentistry of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|Faculty of Dentistry]]
*Faculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine
*Faculty of Radiologists
*Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery

==Admissions==
For the medical programme, there are two main entry routes: a regular scheme for secondary school students, lasting 5 or 6 years (5 years plus 1 year of premedical basic sciences); and a graduate entry scheme lasting 4 years. Entry requirements differ depending on the country of origin. The general Irish [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] score requirement is around 570 points.<ref>Entry Requirements for Applicants [http://www.rcsi.ie/index.jsp?aID=389&nID=244&pID=149 Entry Requirements for Applicants]</ref> In the case of North American applicants with [[bachelor's degrees]] applying to the medical programme, [[MCAT]] scores, [[GPA]] and recommendations are used for evaluation. Similar applicants from Australia, for example, may use [[GAMSAT]] results. 

For the four-year [[Pharmacy]] programme, graduates are awarded BSc in Pharmacy. For the three-year [[Physiotherapy]] programme, graduates are awarded BSc in Physiotherapy.<ref>Irish Statute Book; [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZPA1Y2003S30.html The Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland (Charters Amendment) Act 2003]</ref>

==Student life==
Students at RCSI are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities that promote service in the community and cultural awareness. 80% of the student population is from outside the [[European Union]], with a significant portion coming from North America, the Middle East and Asia. A complete list of current student societies and clubs can be found on the RCSI website.<ref>RCSI Website; [http://www.rcsi.ie/index.jsp?nID=557&pID=115 Student Life / Clubs Societies]</ref>

The Students' Union (SU) is an annually elected body, consisting of 7 officers. The SU is the college's bridge between faculty and the student body and is invited to most meetings, ensuring that student voices are heard on a variety of topics. The SU works closely with the Student Council, which consists of class representatives from all classes at RCSI.

The Biological Society (BioSoc) is the official student society of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and claims to be the oldest student medical society in the world.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The ''Widdess Lecture'' is one of their main annual events, where the Society invites an expert in their field (usually from outside of medicine) to speak to students and staff.

==International aspects and operations==

As a leading international medical institution, RCSI is active in all medically related sectors of education around the globe. During the South African [[Apartheid]], for example, RCSI provided medical education to those that were discriminated against.<ref>RCSI Website; [http://www.rcsi.ie/index.jsp?aID=864&nID=105&pID=93 About the College]</ref> In 2005, RCSI [[Dubai]] was founded and currently offers a [[master's]] programme in Healthcare Management. 

In 2007 The Royal College of Surgeons Ireland (RCSI) in conjunction with Valentia Technologies, the Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB), and the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) launched unique training initiative with the Emergency Medical Services Dubai Training Institute. The aim is to better patient care and improve response times within Dubai's emergency ambulance services.<ref>http://www.rcsi.ie/index.jsp?1nID=93&2nID=105&nID=1212&aID=6</ref>

In [[Malaysia]], [[Penang Medical College]] became RCSI's far east "launching pad". Established in 1995, Malaysian medical students may choose to complete their pre-clinical studies at either UCD Dublin or RCSI. 

[[RCSI-Bahrain]] is a fully owned constituent university of RCSI and already has nearly 450 registered students. The first cohort commenced medical studies in October 2004 and graduates are entitled to an M.D. degree.  In 2006 the Medical University of Bahrain established a new School of [[Nursing]] which took its first cohort of students in September 2006. Since 2009 students can also obtain the degrees conferred upon RCSI graduates from the [[National University of Ireland]].

For students at the home institution of RCSI, options may be taken abroad as a result of collaborative agreements with other medical schools around the world. In 2007, these medical schools included [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University]], [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine|University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Tufts University School of Medicine|Tufts University]]. There are also informal agreements with other institutions such as the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Mayo Clinic]]. 

More than 60 countries from each continent are represented in the RCSI student body.
