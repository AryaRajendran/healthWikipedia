'''Thomas Reed Potts''' (February 10, 1810 &ndash; October 6, 1874) was an American physician, civic leader and the first [[List of mayors of Saint Paul, Minnesota|Mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota]].  After graduating from [[medical school]], Potts moved across the country and eventually found his way to the young settlement of St. Paul.  Active in civic life and popular in his medical practice, he was elected as the first President of the Town Board.  Despite a successful tenure, he tired of politics and retired after one term to continue his practice; however he did hold several key health-related positions.  By the time of his death, he was the oldest doctor in the city and one of its most respected.

==Early years==

Co., 1914, accessed December 5, 2010.</ref> In 1831 he graduated with a medical degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].<ref name=MD>[http://books.google.com/books?id=xYttvbIxHcMC&pg=PA600&lpg=PA600&dq=Thomas+Reed+Potts&source=bl&ots=0BjBM2U_dx&sig=6PU2DhgNetR_XRXL4x_xZvNd0sg&hl=en&ei=NYj8TIfUC5WJnAfa_qDICg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Thomas%20Reed%20Potts&f=false General alumni catalogue of the University of Pennsylvania], University of Pennsylvania.

After medical school, Potts settled in [[Natchez, Mississippi]] for ten years. He moved to [[Galena, Illinois]] in 1841, and then to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] in 1849.<ref name=footnotebio/> In 1847 he married Anna Abbian Steele (born 1821 in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Steelville, Pennsylvania]], died 1901 in St. Paul), sister of prosperous [[Minneapolis]] businessman [[Franklin Steele]], in [[Fort Snelling]].<ref name=footnotebio/><ref name=genealogy/><ref name=SPG020201>T.

W. and sons Charles and Henry.<ref name=SPG042084/>

Potts was a pioneer physician in St. Paul and one of the organizers of the [[Minnesota Historical Society]], which formed in 1849.<ref name=MHSorg>Ralph Budd, [http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/20/v20i04p365-376.pdf The History of the Society and the Community], ''Minnesota History'', December 1939, accessed December 5, 2010.</ref> He practiced medicine in St. Paul for 26 years.  During his years of practice he served as contract physician to Fort Snelling, physician to the [[Sioux]], Medical Purveyor of the district, and Pension Surgeon.<ref name=footnotebio/>

==President of the Town Board of St. Paul==

On May 6, 1850, according to the provisions of the newly formed town's charter, the first election of "house-holders of the town" was held.<ref name=StPPDhis>[http://www.spphs.com/history/1899/chapter_1.php History of the Police and Fire Departments of the Twin Cities, 1899], Saint Paul Police Historical Society, accessed December 5, 2010.</ref> Potts was elected as the first President of the Town Board, an office equivalent to mayor, in an election was not seriously contested. He served alongside future St. Paul mayor [[Edmund Rice (politician)|Edmund Rice]], who served as City Recorder.<ref name=footnotebio/> The role of President of the Town Board, in addition to the duties currently held by the Mayor of St. Paul, also included the role of conservator of the peace; this included acting as the early municipal court and exercising jurisdiction over all criminal matters within the town.  As the police force of the city consisted of one man, Potts would have to summon him to keep order over any cases he would hear.  Since St. Paul did not yet have a jail, those sentenced would be sent to Fort Snelling. Potts served until 1851 and, tired of politics, declined reelection.<ref name=SPG070894>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1894-07-08/ed-1/seq-10/ Over Forty Years Ago.
