'''Ketoacidosis''' is a metabolic state associated with high concentrations of [[ketone bodies]], formed by the breakdown of fatty acids and the [[deamination]] of [[amino acid]]s. The two common ketones produced in humans are [[acetoacetic acid]] and [[Beta-hydroxybutyrate|β-hydroxybutyrate]].  

Ketoacidosis is a pathological metabolic state marked by extreme and uncontrolled [[ketosis]]. In ketoacidosis, the body fails to adequately regulate ketone production causing such a severe accumulation of [[keto acid]]s that the [[pH]] of the [[blood]] is substantially decreased. In extreme cases ketoacidosis can be fatal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/8171281.stm | work=BBC News | title=Death after soup and water diet | date=27 July 2009}}</ref>

Ketoacidosis is most common in untreated type 1 [[diabetes mellitus]], when the liver breaks down [[adipose tissue|fat]] and proteins in response to a perceived need for [[Cellular_respiration|respiratory]] [[Enzyme_substrate|substrate]]. Prolonged alcoholism may lead to alcoholic ketoacidosis. 

Ketoacidosis can be smelled on a person's breath. This is due to [[acetone]], a direct byproduct of the spontaneous decomposition of [[acetoacetic acid]]. It is often described as smelling like fruit or nail polish remover.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000320.htm Diabetic ketoacidosis] at medical dictionary
 of [[National Institutes of Health]].</ref> Ketosis may also smell, but the odor is usually more subtle due to lower concentrations of acetone.

==Pathophysiology==
Ketoacidosis occurs when the body is producing large quantities of [[ketone bodies]] via the [[metabolism]] of [[fatty acids]] ([[ketosis]]) and the body is producing insufficient [[insulin]] to slow this production. The excess ketone bodies can significantly acidify the blood. The presence of a high concentration of glucose in the blood ([[hyperglycemia]]) caused by the lack of [[insulin]] can lead to further acidity. In healthy individuals this normally does not occur because the [[pancreas]] produces insulin in response to rising ketone/blood glucose concentration.

Acidity results from the dissociation of the H<sup>+</sup> ion at physiological pH of metabolic ketone bodies such as [[acetoacetate]], and [[Beta-hydroxybutyrate|β-hydroxybutyrate]].

Acetone has no easily liberated proton, and is thus non-acidic in human biochemical environments.

==Etiology==
Two common types are [[Diabetic ketoacidosis|diabetic]] and [[alcoholic]] ketoacidosis.

In [[diabetes mellitus|diabetic]] patients, ketoacidosis is usually accompanied by [[insulin]] deficiency, [[hyperglycemia]], and [[dehydration]]. Particularly in type 1 diabetics the lack of insulin in the bloodstream prevents [[glucose]] absorption and can cause unchecked ketone body production (through fatty acid metabolism) potentially leading to dangerous glucose and ketone levels in the blood.  Hyperglycemia results in glucose overloading the [[kidneys]] and [[glycosuria|spilling into the urine]] (transport maximum for glucose is exceeded).  Dehydration results following the osmotic movement of water into [[urine]] (Osmotic diuresis), exacerbating the [[acidosis]]. 

In [[alcoholic]] ketoacidosis, [[alcohol]] causes dehydration and blocks the first step of [[gluconeogenesis]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The body is unable to synthesize enough glucose to meet its needs, thus creating an energy crisis resulting in [[fatty acid]] metabolism, and [[ketone body]] formation.

A mild acidosis may result from prolonged [[fasting]] or when following a [[ketogenic diet]] or a [[very low calorie diet]].<ref name="Hartman2007">{{cite journal |author=Hartman AL, Vining EP |title=Clinical aspects of the ketogenic diet |journal=[[Epilepsia]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17241206 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.00914.x |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Delbridge E, Proietto J|title=State of the science: VLED (Very Low Energy Diet) for obesity|journal=Asia Pac J Clin Nutr|year=2006|volume=15|pages=49–54|pmid=16928661|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16928661|first1=E|last2=Proietto|first2=J}}</ref>
