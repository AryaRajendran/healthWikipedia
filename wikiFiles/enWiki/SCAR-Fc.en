'''sCAR-Fc''' ('''Soluble Receptor Analogue''') is an experimental prophylactic treatment against [[coxsackievirus]] B3 (CVB) infections. Coxsackievirus B3 can cause cardiac damage, eventually resulting in a weakened and enlarged heart that is termed [[dilated cardiomyopathy]].<ref name="a">{{cite journal |author=Werk D, Pinkert S, Heim A, ''et al.'' |title=Combination of soluble coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor and anti-coxsackievirus siRNAs exerts synergistic antiviral activity against coxsackievirus B3 |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=298–306 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19591879 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.07.002 }}</ref> While many other treatments inhibit viral proliferation in [[myocyte]]s, sCAR-Fc prevents the virus entering the cell by competitively binding to [[coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor]]s (CAR) on the membrane of myocytes.

[[Myocarditis]] is an inflammation of the heart, most commonly cause by viral infections. Amongst the viruses capable of causing myocarditis, CVB3 is a common agent identified in inducing cardiac damage. Internalization of the virus into myocytes occurs by binding to coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptors (CAR) located in [[tight junction]]s on cell membranes.<ref name="a" /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yanagawa B, Spiller OB, Proctor DG, ''et al.'' |title=Soluble recombinant coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor abrogates coxsackievirus b3-mediated pancreatitis and myocarditis in mice |journal=J.

The role of the immune system in response to the presence of a virus  has both beneficial and detrimental effects on the cardiac system.<ref name="a" /> The arrival of [[natural killer cells]] (NK cells) at the site of infection limits viral proliferation in myocytes. Conversely, while certain cytokines released from immune cells have  protective effects, others such as [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNFα) have deleterious effects on heart cells. Moreover, peak concentrations of [[T cells]] in the myocardium during days 7-14 play important roles in both viral clearance and immune mediated cardiac damage. T-cells not only lyse and destroy infected myocytes, but due to molecular mimicry, they also destroy normal, healthy cardiac cells, further driving the heart towards dilated cardiomyopathy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Herzum M, Ruppert V, Küytz B, Jomaa H, Nakamura I, Maisch B |title=Coxsackievirus B3 infection leads to cell death of cardiac myocytes |journal=J.

==Mechanism ==
A synthetic and soluble form of CAR (sCAR) has been created to prevent viral infection with CVB3. Attaching Fc domain of [[immunoglobulin]] [[IgG1]] to sCAR (sCAR-Fc) enhances solubility and extends its [[half-life]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fechner H, Pinkert S, Geisler A, Poller W, Kurreck J |title=Pharmacological and biological antiviral therapeutics for cardiac coxsackievirus infections |journal=Molecules |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=8475–503 |year=2011 |pmid=21989310 |doi=10.3390/molecules16108475}}</ref><ref name="a" /> Furthermore, once sCAR-Fc binds the virus, [[macrophages]] and other phagocytic immune cells with Fc receptor recognition bind to the sCAR-Fc-viral complex to eliminate the virus. Essentially, sCAR-Fc mimics CAR receptors on cardiac cells, competitively inhibiting viral attachment and entry into myocytes. Decreased lesions in cardiac tissues, reduced cell necrosis, and diminished inflammatory responses are observed in sCAR-Fc treated cells (CITE). This suggests protective effects against myocardial damage by CVB3.

==Discussion==
Administration of sCAR-Fc beyond three days after initial exposure to the virus does not have any beneficial effects as cardiac damage is too severe.<ref name="c" /> As such, the use of sCAR-Fc is currently limited to prophylactic treatments.
