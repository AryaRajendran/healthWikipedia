'''Amygdalohippocampectomy''' is a surgical procedure for the treatment of [[epilepsy]]. It consists of the removal of the [[hippocampus]], which has a role in memory, spatial awareness, and navigation,<ref name="Ekstrom ">{{cite journal | last =Ekstrom  | first =AD | authorlink = | coauthors =Kahana M.J., Caplan J.B., Fields T.A., Isham E.A., Newman E.L., Fried I. | title =Cellular networks underlying human spatial navigation | journal =Nature | volume =425| issue =6954 | pages =184–188 | publisher = | year =2003  | url =http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Publications#EkstEtal03 | doi = 10.1038/nature01964| pmid =12968182 | accessdate =2007-02-11}}</ref> and the [[amygdalae]], which have a role in the processing and memory of emotional reactions,<ref name="Olivier">{{cite journal |author=Olivier A |title=Transcortical selective amygdalohippocampectomy in temporal lobe epilepsy |journal=Can J Neurol Sci. |volume=27 Suppl 1|pages=S68–76; discussion S92–6 |year=2000 |pmid=10830331}}</ref> both structures forming part of the [[limbic system]] of the [[brain]]. 

Amygdalohippocampectomy is used only when all other treatment options have failed to resolve the epilepsy. It is an effective treatment for most patients. However, possible adverse side effects include impaired memory and defects in visual perception.

== Procedure ==

The amygalohippocampectomy is indicated when the focal point of the seizures can be anatomically localized to the hippocampus and amygdala. Normally, to be considered for this procedure, one must have failed all first-line treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith KA, Detwiler PW, Porter RW |title=Surgical Treatment of Intractable Epilepsy |journal=BNI Quarterly |year=1999 |volume=15 |issue=1 |url=http://www.emergemd.com/bniq/article.asp?article_ref_id=15-1-4 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071027053333/http://www.emergemd.com/bniq/article.asp?article_ref_id=15-1-4|archivedate=27 July 2006}}</ref> The selective amygdalohippocampectomy will remove only the offending portions of the hippocampus and amygdala.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bate H, Eldridge P, Varma T, Wieshmann UC |title=The seizure outcome after amygdalohippocampectomy and temporal lobectomy |journal=Eur.

== Statistics and side effects ==
Of 376 patients who had the amygdalohippocampectomy procedure performed, compared to other types of temporal lobe resections, two thirds of this population were reported free of disabling seizures.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000055086.35806.2D |author=Engel J, Wiebe S, French J, ''et al.'' |title=Practice parameter: Temporal lobe and localized neocortical resections for epilepsy |journal=Neurology |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=538–47 |date=25 February 2003|url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/full/60/4/538 |pmid=12601090 }}</ref>
