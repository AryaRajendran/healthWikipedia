'''Neutrophilia''' (or '''neutrophil leukocytosis''') describes a high number of [[neutrophil granulocyte]]s in [[blood]].<ref>{{DorlandsDict|six/000072202|neutrophilia}}</ref>

==Causes==
Neutrophils are the primary [[white blood cell]]s that respond to a [[bacteria]]l [[infection]], so the most common cause of neutrophilia is a bacterial infection, especially [[pyogenic infection]]s.<ref name=Kumar12-6>Table 12-6 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson |title=Robbins Basic Pathology|publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2973-7 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition.</ref>

Neutrophils are also increased in any acute [[inflammation]], so will be raised after a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]],<ref name=Kumar12-6/> other [[infarct]] or [[burn]]s.<ref name=Kumar12-6/>

Some drugs, such as [[prednisone]], have the same effect as [[cortisol]], causing marginated neutrophils to enter the blood stream. [[Anxiety|Nervousness]] will very slightly raise the neutrophil count because of this effect.

A neutrophilia might also be the result of a [[Malignant|malignancy]]. [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML or chronic myeloid leukaemia) is a disease where the blood cells proliferate out of control. These cells may be neutrophils. Neutrophilia can also be caused by [[appendicitis]] and [[splenectomy]].<ref name=bloodandcancerclinic>{{cite web|title=bloodandcancerclinic|url=http://www.bloodandcancerclinic.com/neutrophilia.php|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>

=="Left shift"==
A "left shift" refers to the presence of increased proportions of younger, less well differentiated neutrophils and neutrophil-precursor cells in the blood.  This generally reflects early or premature release of [[myeloid cells]] from the [[bone marrow]], the site where neutrophils are generated.  A severe neutrophilia with left shift is referred to as a [[leukemoid reaction]]. The [[leukocyte alkaline phosphatase]] (LAP) score, which refers to the amount of [[alkaline phosphatase]] per neutrophil, will increase. In a severe infection, toxic granulation changes happen to the neutrophils.

This can resemble [[Pelger-Huet anomaly]].<ref name="pmid16724080">{{cite journal |author=Mohamed IS, Wynn RJ, Cominsky K, ''et al.'' |title=White blood cell left shift in a neonate: a case of mistaken identity |journal=J Perinatol |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=378–80 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16724080 |doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211513}}</ref><ref name="pmid8377874">{{cite journal |author=Shmuely H, Pitlik SD, Inbal A, Rosenfeld JB |title=Pelger-Huët anomaly mimicking 'shift to the left' |journal=Neth J Med |volume=42 |issue=5–6 |pages=168–70 |year=1993 |month=June |pmid=8377874 |doi= |url=}}</ref>
