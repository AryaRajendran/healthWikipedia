'''Night eating syndrome''', or '''NES''', also "midnight hunger", is an emerging [[eating disorder]] diagnosis, which primarily characterizes an ongoing, persistent pattern of late-night [[binge eating]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/324054.stm | work=BBC News | title=Night bingeing recognised as a disorder | date=April 20, 1999 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/med/byname/Parasomnias.htm eMedicine - Parasomnias : Article Excerpt by Sat Sharma<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
NES was originally described by Dr Albert Stunkard in 1955<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&uid=14388031&cmd=showdetailview&indexed=google The night-eating syndrome; a pattern of food intak...[Am J Med. 1955&#93; - PubMed Result<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is currently proposed for inclusion in the next edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].<ref>PubMed ID 19683608</ref> The diagnosis is controversial; its validity and clinical utility have been questioned<ref>PubMed ID 19621465</ref> and there are currently no official diagnostic criteria.
It affects between 1 and 2% of the population.<ref>[http://www.anred.com/nes.html ANRED: Night Eating Syndrome<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Most of which tend to be [[obese]]. Those who check into clinics for obesity commonly suffer from NES.<ref name="Food as Foe Lesli J. Favor">"Food as Foe" Lesli J.

There is debate as to whether these should be viewed as separate diseases, or part of a continuum.<ref>[http://www.psychiatrymmc.com/displayArticle.cfm?articleID=article249 Sleep-Related Eating Disorders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Symptoms and behavior==
People who suffer from night eating syndrome generally:

*Skip [[breakfast]], and go several hours after waking before their first meal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}
*Consume at least 25% of<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19683608 | doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2008.09.013 | volume=50 | issue=5 | title=Development of criteria for a diagnosis: lessons from the night eating syndrome | year=2009 | author=Stunkard AJ, Allison KC, Geliebter A, Lundgren JD, Gluck ME, O'Reardon JP | journal=Compr Psychiatry | pages=391â€“9}}</ref> their [[calories]] after dinner.  (Many sources would list this as after 9 or 10 pm;  dessert is generally not included, if one is eaten.)
**Late-night binges almost always consist of consuming [[carbohydrates]].  (Carbohydrates tend to shoot messages to the brain to produce [[serotonin]], which induces sleep.)<ref name="Food as Foe Lesli J. Favor"/> However, this eating is typically spread over several hours, which is not consistent with a typical [[binge eating|eating binge]] as evidenced by other eating disorders. Episodes of late-night binge-eating can be repeated throughout the night, with many separate visits to the fridge or cupboard.
*Suffer from [[Clinical depression|depression]] or [[anxiety]], often in connection with their eating habits.<ref>[http://www.obesityresearch.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/4/264 Night Eating Syndrome Is Associated with Depression, Low Self-Esteem, Reduced Daytime Hunger, and Less Weight Loss in Obese Outpatients - Gluck et al. 9 (4): 264 - Obesity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*Affect and arousal decrease throughout the day with the lowest levels being in the middle of night-eating episodes.<ref>

**These night eating episodes typically bring guilt rather than hedonistic enjoyment.
*Have trouble sleeping in general;  see [[insomnia]].<ref>[http://www.something-fishy.org/whatarethey/other.php#nes Other Types of Eating Disorders - The Something Fishy Website on Eating Disorders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
**Are more likely than the general public to [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalk]].

To be considered a ''bona fide'' [[Mental disorder|disorder]], this pattern should continue for two months or more.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Treatment==
Night eating disorder tends to lead to weight gain;  as many as 28% of those seeking [[gastric bypass surgery]] were found to suffer from NES in one study.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4615507/site/newsweek Doughnuts in the Dark - Newsweek Health - MSNBC.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The disorder is accompanied by what sufferers describe as an uncontrollable desire to eat, akin to [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]], and is often treated chemically.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, [[Sertraline]] (or [[Zoloft]]) has shown some ability to help NES sufferers.<ref>John P. O'Reardon, Albert J. Stunkard, Kelly C. Allison, Clinical trial of sertraline in the treatment of night eating syndrome. International Journal of Eating Disorders, Volume 35 Issue 1, Pages 16 - 26</ref>

Therapy to increase the natural nocturnal rise in melatonin, reduce the body's adrenal stress response and raise [[leptin]] levels or improve leptin sensitivity are options that may help these patients overcome the disorder. Another key may involve the availability of tryptophan, an important amino acid, in the body. More than 70% of the night time eating to combat [[anxiety]] involved binging on [[carbohydrates]]. These foods are believed to increase the amount of [[tryptophan]] available for conversion to [[serotonin]], the calming [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain that promotes an overall sense of well-being and, in turn, converts to [[melatonin]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
