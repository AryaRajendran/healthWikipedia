'''Patau syndrome''' is a [[syndrome]] caused by a [[chromosome|chromosomal]] abnormality, in which some or all of the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of the body contain extra genetic material from [[chromosome 13 (human)|chromosome 13]]. This can occur either because each cell contains a full extra copy of chromosome 13 (a disorder known as '''trisomy 13''' or '''trisomy D'''), or because each cell contains an extra partial copy of the chromosome (i.e., [[Robertsonian translocation]]) or because of [[mosaicism|mosaic]] Patau syndrome. Full trisomy 13 is caused by [[nondisjunction]] of chromosomes during [[meiosis]] (the mosaic form is caused by nondisjunction during [[mitosis]]). The extra genetic material from chromosome 13 disrupts the normal course of development, causing multiple and complex organ defects. Like all [[nondisjunction]] conditions (such as [[Down syndrome]] and [[Edwards syndrome]]), the risk of this syndrome in the offspring increases with maternal age at pregnancy, with about 31 years being the average.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/p/patau_syndrome/prevalence.htm |title=Prevalence and Incidence of Patau syndrome |accessdate=2008-02-17 |date=2008-02-04 |work=Diseases Center-Patau Syndrome |publisher=Adviware Pty Ltd. |quote=mean maternal age for this abnormality is about 31 years}}</ref> Patau syndrome affects somewhere between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 21,700 live births.<ref>[http://miscarriage.about.com/od/onetimemiscarriages/p/patau.htm About.com > Patau Syndrome (Trisomy 13)] From Krissi Danielsson. Updated June 10, 2009</ref>

==Causes==
Patau's syndrome is most often the result of [[trisomy]] 13, meaning each cell in the body has three copies of chromosome 13 instead of the usual two. A small percentage of cases occur when only some of the body's cells have an extra copy; such cases are called mosaic Patau.

Patau syndrome can also occur when part of chromosome 13 becomes attached to another chromosome (translocated) before or at conception in a [[Robertsonian translocation]]. Affected people have two copies of chromosome 13, plus extra material from chromosome 13 attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, the person has a partial trisomy for chromosome 13 and often the physical signs of the syndrome differ from the typical Patau syndrome.

Most cases of Patau syndrome are not inherited, but occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called [[non-disjunction]] can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an [[Ovum|egg]] or [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] cell may gain an extra copy of the chromosome. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 13 in each of the body's cells. [[Mosaicism|Mosaic]] Patau syndrome is also not inherited. It occurs as a random error during cell division early in [[fetal]] development.

Patau syndrome due to a translocation can be inherited. An unaffected person can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation because there is no extra material from chromosome 13. Although they do not have signs of Patau syndrome, people who carry this type of balanced translocation are at an increased risk of having children with the condition.

==Manifestations and physical findings==

Of those fetuses that do survive to gestation and subsequent birth, common abnormalities may include:

* Nervous system

** [[Microcephaly]]
** [[Holoprosencephaly]] (failure of the forebrain to divide properly).
** Structural eye defects, including [[microphthalmia]], [[Peters anomaly]] (a type of eye abnormality), [[cataract]], iris and/or fundus ([[coloboma]]), retinal dysplasia or [[retinal detachment]], sensory [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[cortical visual loss]], and [[optic nerve hypoplasia]]

==Recurrence risk==

Unless one of the parents is a carrier of a [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] the chances of a couple having another trisomy 13 affected child is less than 1% (less than that of [[Down syndrome]]).

==History==

Trisomy 13 was first observed by [[Thomas Bartholin]] in 1657,<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1024}}</ref> but the chromosomal nature of the disease was ascertained by Dr. [[Klaus Patau]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Patau K, Smith DW, Therman E, Inhorn SL, Wagner HP |title=Multiple congenital anomaly caused by an extra autosome |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue= 7128|pages=790–3 |year=1960 |pmid=14430807 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(60)90676-0}}</ref> The disease is named in his honor. Patau syndrome was also described in Pacific island tribes. These reports were thought to have been caused by radiation from atomic bomb tests. The tribes were temporarily moved before and during the test by an ''x'' amount of distance. They were then put back where they had been taken; all of this occurred before it was known how long, or even if, radiation still lingered on after a nuclear explosion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In England and Wales during 2008–09 there were 172 diagnoses of Patau's syndrome (trisomy 13), with 91% of diagnoses made prenatally. There were 111 elective abortions, 14 stillbirth/miscarriage/fetal deaths, 30 outcomes unknown, and 17 live births. Approximately 4% of Patau's syndrome with unknown outcomes are likely to result in a live birth, therefore the total number of live births is estimated to be 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfson.qmul.ac.uk/ndscr/|title=National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register Annual Reports 2008/09}}</ref> The small percentage of babies with the full Patau's syndrome who survive birth and early infancy may live to adulthood, and children with mosaic or partial forms of this trisomy may have a completely different and much more hopeful prognosis.{{fact|date=February 2013}}

==Treatment==
Medical management of children with Trisomy 13 is planned on a case-by-case basis and depends on the individual circumstances of the patient. Treatment of Patau syndrome focuses on the particular physical problems with which each child is born. Many infants have difficulty surviving the first few days or weeks due to severe neurological problems or complex [[heart defects]]. Surgery may be necessary to repair heart defects or [[cleft lip]] and [[cleft palate]]. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy will help individuals with Patau syndrome reach their full developmental potential. Surviving children are described as happy and parents report that they enrich their lives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janvier|first=Annie|coauthors=Farlow, Wilfond|title=The experience of families with children with trisomy 13 and 18 in social networks.|journal=Pediatrics|date=July 23, 2012|month=Aug|volume=130|issue=2|pages=293–298|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-0151|pmid=22826570|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22826570}}</ref>

== Prognosis ==

More than 80% of children with Patau syndrome die within the first year of life.<ref name="pubmed health">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002625/</ref>
