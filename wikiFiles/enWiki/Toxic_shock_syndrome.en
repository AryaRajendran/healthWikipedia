'''Toxic shock syndrome''' ('''TSS''') is a potentially fatal illness caused by a [[Exotoxin|bacterial toxin]]. Different [[bacteria]]l [[toxins]] may cause toxic shock syndrome, depending on the situation. The [[Disease causative agent|causative]] bacteria include ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''. Streptococcal TSS is sometimes referred to as '''toxic shock-like syndrome''' ('''TSLS''') or '''streptococcal toxic shock syndrome''' ('''STSS''').

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of toxic shock syndrome vary depending on the underlying cause. TSS resulting from infection with the bacterium ''Staphylococcus aureus'' typically manifests in otherwise healthy individuals with high [[fever]], accompanied by low [[blood pressure]], [[malaise]] and confusion, which can rapidly progress to stupor, [[coma]], and multiple organ failure. The characteristic rash, often seen early in the course of illness, resembles a sunburn, and can involve any region of the body, including the lips, mouth, eyes, palms and soles. In patients who survive the initial phase of the infection, the rash ''desquamates'', or peels off, after 10–14 days.  

In contrast, TSS caused by the bacterium ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', or TSLS, typically presents in people with pre-existing skin infections with the bacteria. These individuals often experience severe pain at the site of the skin infection, followed by rapid progression of symptoms as described above for TSS. In contrast to TSS caused by ''Staphylococcus'', streptococcal TSS less often involves a sunburn-like rash.

In either case, diagnosis is based strictly upon [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] criteria modified in 1981 after the initial surge in [[tampon]]-associated infections.:<ref>[http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0025629/m0025629.asp#head001e00000000000 Case Definitions for Public Health Surveillance]</ref>

# [[Body temperature]] > 38.9 °C (102.02 °F)
# Systolic [[blood pressure]] < 90 mmHg
# Diffuse [[rash]], intense [[erythroderma]], [[Blanch (medical)|blanching]] with subsequent [[desquamation]], especially of the palms and soles
# Involvement of three or more organ systems:
#* Gastrointestinal ([[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]])
#* [[Mucous membrane]] [[hyperemia]] (vaginal, oral, conjunctival)
#* [[Renal failure]] ([[serum creatinine]] > 2 times normal)
#* [[Liver|Hepatic]] inflammation (AST, ALT > 2 times normal)
#* [[Thrombocytopenia]] (platelet count < 100,000 / mm³)
#* [[Central nervous system|CNS]] involvement (confusion without any focal neurological findings)

== Pathophysiology ==

In both TSS (caused by ''S. aureus'') and TSLS (caused by ''S. pyogenes''), disease progression stems from a [[superantigen]] toxin that allows the nonspecific binding of [[MHC II]] with [[T cell receptor]]s, resulting in polyclonal T cell activation. In typical T cell recognition, an antigen is taken up by an antigen-presenting cell, processed, expressed on the cell surface in complex with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in a groove formed by the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC, and recognized by an antigen-specific T cell receptor. 

By contrast, superantigens do not require processing by antigen-presenting cells but instead interact directly with the invariant region of the class II MHC molecule. In patients with TSS, up to 20% of the body's T cells can be activated at one time. This polyclonal T-cell population causes a [[cytokine storm]], followed by a multisystem disease. The toxin in ''S. aureus'' infections is TSS Toxin-1, or [[Toxic shock syndrome toxin|TSST]]-1. The TSST-1 is secreted as a single polypeptide chain.

The gene encoding toxic shock syndrome toxin is carried by a mobile genetic element of ''S. aureus'' in the SaPI family of [[pathogenicity island]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=JA|coauthors=Ruzin, A, Ross, HF, Kurepina, N, Novick, RP|title=The gene for toxic shock toxin is carried by a family of mobile pathogenicity islands in ''Staphylococcus aureus''|journal=Molecular microbiology|date=1998 Jul|volume=29|issue=2|pages=527–43|pmid=9720870|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.1998.00947.x}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
The severity of this disease frequently warrants hospitalization. Admission to the [[intensive care unit]] is often necessary for supportive care (for aggressive fluid management, ventilation, renal replacement therapy and [[inotropic]] support), particularly in the case of [[multiple organ failure]].<ref name="Zimbelman">{{cite journal|journal=Ped Infect Dis J|volume=18|issue=12|page=1096–1100|title=Improved outcome of clindamycin compared with beta-lactam antibiotic treatment for invasive ''Streptococcus pyogenes'' infection|author=Zimbelman J, Palmer A, Todd J|url=http://www.pidj.org/pt/re/pidj/abstract.00006454-199912000-00014.htm;jsessionid=JZ2WwJhpv8J4dh2nDJWTywCFB4Lyy8L6Xw61G1hMCl2jYXBhQGp2!-2118404334!181195629!8091!-1|doi=10.1097/00006454-199912000-00014|year=1999}}</ref> The source of infection should be removed or drained if possible: abscesses and collections should be drained.

Antibiotic treatment should cover both ''S.&nbsp;pyogenes'' and ''S.&nbsp;aureus''. This may include a combination of [[cephalosporin]]s, [[penicillin]]s or [[vancomycin]]. The addition of [[clindamycin]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Clindamycin-induced suppression of toxic-shock syndrome-associated exotoxin production|author=Schlievert PM, Kelly JA|journal=J Infect Dis|volume=149|issue=3|page=471|year=1984|pmid=6715902|doi=10.1093/infdis/149.3.471}}</ref> or [[gentamicin]]<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother|date=1 August 1997|pages=1682–5|volume=41|issue=8|title=Combination of flucloxacillin and gentamicin inhibits toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 production by ''Staphylococcus aureus'' in both logarithmic and stationary phases of growth|author=van Langevelde P, van Dissel JT, Meurs CJ, Renz J, Groeneveld PH|url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/8/1682|pmid=9257741|pmc=163985}}</ref> reduces toxin production and mortality.

==Prognosis==

With proper treatment, patients usually recover in two to three weeks{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. The condition can, however, be fatal within hours.

==Epidemiology==
Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is rare and the number of reported cases has declined significantly since the 1980s. Patrick Schlievert, who published a study on it in 2004, determined incidence at 3 to 4 out of 100,000 tampon users per year; the information supplied by manufacturers of sanitary products such as Tampax and Stayfree puts it at 1 to 17 of every 100,000 menstruating people per year.<ref name=Sevrens>{{cite news |first=Julie Sevrens |last=Lyons |title=A New Generation Faces Toxic Shock Syndrome |agency=Knight Ridder Newspapers |work= |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=25 January 2005 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2002160362_healthtoxicshock26.html}} first published as "Lingering Risk," ''San Jose Mercury News'', December 13, 2004</ref><ref name="Stayfree-TSS">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.stayfree.com/faq_TSS.jsp| title = Stayfree — FAQ About Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) | accessdate = 2006-10-13}}</ref> 

The CDC has stopped tracking TSS. However, there was a rise in reported cases in the early 2000s: eight deaths from the syndrome in California in 2002 after three successive years of four deaths per year, and Schlievert's study found cases in part of Minnesota more than tripled from 2000 to 2003.<ref name=Sevrens/> Schlievert considers earlier onset of menstruation to be a cause of the rise; others, such as Philip M. Tierno and Bruce A. Hanna, blame new high-absorbency tampons introduced in 1999 and manufacturers discontinuing warnings not to leave tampons in overnight.<ref name=Sevrens/>

== History ==

=== Initial description ===

The term ''toxic shock syndrome'' was first used in 1978 by a Denver pediatrician, Dr. James K. Todd, to describe the staphylococcal illness in three boys and four girls aged 8–17 years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Todd J, Fishaut M, Kapral F, Welch T |title=Toxic-shock syndrome associated with phage-group-I staphylococci |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8100 |pages=1116–8 |year=1978 |pmid=82681 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(78)92274-2}}</ref> Even though ''S. aureus'' was isolated from mucosal sites in the patients, bacteria could not be isolated from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine, raising suspicion that a toxin was involved. The authors of the study noted reports of similar staphylococcal illnesses had appeared occasionally as far back as 1927, but the authors at the time failed to consider the possibility of a connection between toxic shock syndrome and tampon use, as three of the girls who were menstruating when the illness developed were using tampons. Many cases of TSS occurred after tampons were left in the person using them.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Todd J |title=Toxic shock syndrome--scientific uncertainty and the public media |journal=Pediatrics |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=921–3 |year=1981 |pmid=7232057}}</ref>

In January 1980, epidemiologists in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]] reported the appearance of TSS, mostly in those menstruating, to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=CDC |authorlink=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Toxic-shock syndrome—United States |journal=MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |volume=29 |issue=20 |pages=229–230 |date=23 May 1980 |url=http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/1434/}}</ref> ''S. aureus'' was successfully cultured from most of the subjects.

On 22 September 1980, Procter and Gamble recalled Rely<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hanrahan S|title=Historical review of menstrual toxic shock syndrome|journal=Women Health|volume=21|issue=2–3|pages=141–165|year=1994|pmid=8073784|doi=10.1300/J013v21n02_09|last2=Submission|first2=Haworth Continuing Features}}</ref> following release of the CDC report.

It was shown later that higher absorbency of tampons was associated with an increased risk for TSS, regardless of the chemical composition or the brand of the tampon. The sole exception was Rely, for which the risk for TSS was still higher when corrected for its absorbency.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berkley S, Hightower A, Broome C, Reingold A|title=The relationship of tampon characteristics to menstrual toxic shock syndrome|journal=JAMA|volume=258|issue=7|pages=917–20|year=1987|pmid=3613021 |doi=10.1001/jama.258.7.917}}</ref> The ability of carboxymethylcellulose to filter the ''S. aureus'' toxin that causes TSS may account for the increased risk associated with Rely.<ref name="TTS1997-Vitale"/>

By the end of 1980, the number of TSS cases reported to CDC began to decline, however there is some argument as to whether statistics provided by CDC are reliable due to problems with recognition of TSS symptoms by medical staff and the way in which CDC records TSS cases, many estimate that only around a third of all TSS cases reported to CDC were included in statistics.
