In Europe, the United States and other industrialized countries, on the other hand, the infection is contracted primarily by [[susceptible]] young adults, most of whom are infected with the virus during trips to countries with a high incidence of the disease<ref name="pmid16271543"/> or through contact with infectious persons.

HAV infection produces a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection or chronic liver disease. However, 10–15% of patients might experience a relapse of symptoms during the 6 months after acute illness. Acute liver failure from Hepatitis A is rare (overall case-fatality rate: 0.5%). The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with more than 80% of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infection.<ref name="pmid10683554">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(99)00470-3 |author=Ciocca M. |title=Clinical course and consequences of hepatitis A infection |journal=Vaccine |volume=18 |pages=71–4 |year=2000 |pmid=10683554}}</ref> Antibody produced in response to HAV infection persists for life and confers protection against reinfection.

==Signs and symptoms==
Early symptoms of hepatitis A infection can be mistaken for [[influenza]], but some sufferers, especially children,  exhibit no symptoms at all.  Symptoms typically appear 2 to 6 weeks (the [[incubation period]]) after the initial infection.<ref>{{cite web | title = Hepatitis A Symptoms | publisher = eMedicineHealth | url = http://www.emedicinehealth.com/hepatitis_a/page3_em.htm#Hepatitis%20A%20Symptoms | date = 2007-05-17 | accessdate = 2007-05-18}}</ref>

Symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although some people can be ill for as long as 6 months:<ref>{{cite web | title = Hepatitis A Information for the Public | publisher = Center for Disease Control | url = http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/A/aFAQ.htm | date = 2009-09-17 | accessdate = 2011-01-08}}</ref>

Following ingestion, HAV enters the bloodstream through the epithelium  of the [[oropharynx]]  or intestine.<ref name="Murray, P. r. 2005">Murray, P. R.,  Rosenthal, K. S. & Pfaller, M. A. (2005) Medical Microbiology 5th  ed., Elsevier Mosby.</ref>  The blood carries the virus to  its target, the liver, where it multiplies within [[hepatocytes]] and [[Kupffer cells]] (liver macrophages). [[Virions]] are secreted into the bile and released in stool. HAV is  excreted in large quantities approximately 11 days prior to appearance  of symptoms or anti-HAV  [[IgM]] [[antibodies]] in the blood. The [[incubation period]]  is 15–50 days and  mortality is less than 0.5%.
Within the liver hepatocytes the RNA genome is released from the protein coat and is translated by the cell's own ribosomes. Unlike other members of the Picornaviruses this virus requires an intact eukaryote initiating factor 4G (eIF4G) for the initiation of translation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aragonès L, Guix S, Ribes E, Bosch A, Pintó RM |title=Fine-tuning translation kinetics selection as the driving force of codon usage bias in the hepatitis A virus capsid |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=e1000797 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20221432 |pmc=2832697 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000797 |url=http://www.plospathogens.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000797&representation=PDF }}</ref> The requirement for this factor results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis unlike other picornaviruses. The virus must then inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery which may explain its poor growth in cell culture. Presumably for this reason the virus has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host. Precisely how this strategy works is not quite clear yet.

There is no apparent virus-mediated [[cytotoxicity]] presumably because of the virus' own requirement for an intact eIF4G and liver pathology is likely immune-mediated.

===Structure===
The Hepatitis [[virus]]  (HAV) is a [[Picornavirus]];  it is [[Viral envelope|non-enveloped]]  and contains a [[Positive-sense ssRNA virus|single-stranded RNA]] packaged in a protein [[capsid|shell]].<ref name="pmid17328982">{{cite journal |author=Cristina J, Costa-Mattioli M |title=Genetic variability and molecular evolution of hepatitis A virus |journal=Virus  Res. |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=151–7 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17328982 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2007.01.005}}</ref>  There is  only one [[serovar|serotype]]  of the virus, but multiple genotypes exist.<ref  name="pmid14645901">{{cite journal |author=Costa-Mattioli M, Di  Napoli A, Ferré V, Billaudel S, Perez-Bercoff R, Cristina J |title=Genetic variability of hepatitis A virus |journal=J.

===Transmission===

The virus spreads by the [[fecal-oral route]] and infections often occur in conditions of poor sanitation and overcrowding. Hepatitis A can be transmitted by the [[parenteral]] route but very rarely by blood and blood products. Food-borne outbreaks are not uncommon,<ref name="pmid16848078">{{cite journal

Approximately 40% of all acute viral hepatitis is caused by HAV.<ref name="Murray, P. r. 2005"/>  Infected individuals are infectious prior to onset of symptoms, roughly 10 days following infection.  The virus is resistant to [[detergent]], acid (pH 1), solvents (e.g., [[ether]], [[chloroform]]), drying, and temperatures up to 60&nbsp;°C.  It can survive for months in fresh and salt water.  Common-source (e.g., water, restaurant) outbreaks are typical.  Infection is common in children in developing countries, reaching 100% [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], but following infection there is lifelong [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].  HAV can be inactivated by: [[chlorine]] treatment (drinking water), [[formalin]] (0.35%, 37&nbsp;°C, 72 hours), [[peracetic acid]] (2%, 4 hours), beta-propiolactone (0.25%, 1-hour), and [[UV radiation]] (2 μW/cm<sup>2</sup>/min).

==Diagnosis==

[[File:HAV Infection.png|thumb|Serum IgG, IgM and ALT following Hepatitis A virus infection]]

Although HAV is excreted in the feces towards the end of the [[incubation period]], specific diagnosis is made by the detection of HAV-specific [[IgM]] [[antibody|antibodies]] in the blood.<ref name="pmid7876654">{{cite journal

IgG antibody to HAV is also found in the blood following [[vaccination]] and tests for immunity to the virus are based on the detection of this antibody.<ref name="pmid7876654"/>

During the acute stage of the infection, the liver enzyme [[alanine transferase]] (ALT) is present in the blood at levels much higher than is normal. The [[enzyme]] comes from the liver cells that have been damaged by the virus.<ref name="pmid15931347">{{cite journal

The vaccine is given by injection.  An initial dose provides protection starting two to four weeks after vaccination; the second booster dose, given six to twelve months later, provides protection for over twenty years.<ref name=CDC_2006 />

===Vaccination programmes===

The vaccine was introduced in 1992 and was initially recommended for persons at high risk. Since then Bahrain and Israel have embarked on eradication programmes.<ref name=André2006>{{cite journal | author = André FE | year = 2006 | title = Universal mass vaccination against hepatitis A. | url = | journal = Curr Top Microbiol Immunol | volume = 304 | issue = | pages = 95–114 | pmid = 16989266}}</ref> Australia, China, Belarus, Italy, Spain and the United States have started similar programmes.

==Treatment==

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Sufferers are advised to rest, avoid fatty foods and alcohol (these may be poorly tolerated for some additional months during the recovery phase and cause minor relapses), eat a well-balanced diet, and stay hydrated.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001323/ Hepatitis A PubMed Health]</ref>

==Prognosis==

The [[United States]] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in 1991 reported a low [[mortality rate]] for  hepatitis A of 4 deaths per 1000 cases for the general [[population]] but a higher rate of 17.5 per 1000 in those aged 50 and over. The risk of death from acute liver failure following HAV infection increases with age and when the person has underlying chronic liver disease.

Young children that are infected with hepatitis A typically have a milder form of the disease, usually lasting from 1–3 weeks, whereas adults tend to experience a much more severe form of the disease.<ref name="pmid16848078">{{cite journal |author=Brundage SC, Fitzpatrick AN |title=Hepatitis A |journal=American Family Physician |volume=73 |issue=12 |pages=2162–8 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16848078 |doi= |url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0615/p2162.pdf }}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[File:HAV prevalence 2005.svg|thumb|Hepatitis A Distribution 2005]]
Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) in the blood are a marker of past or current infection.  High-income regions (Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) have very low HAV endemicity levels and a high proportion of susceptible adults, low-income regions (sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia) have high endemicity levels and almost no susceptible adolescents and adults, and most middle-income regions have a mix of intermediate and low endemicity levels.  Anti-HAV prevalence suggest that middle-income regions in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East currently had an intermediate or low level of endemicity in 2005. The countries in these regions may have an increasing burden of disease from hepatitis A.<ref name="pmid20723630 ">{{cite journal

There were 30,000 cases of Hepatitis A reported to the CDC in the U.S. in 1997. The agency estimates that there were as many as 270,000 cases each year from 1980 through 2000, and that approximately one third of the population has been infected by Hepatitis A, most of whom go undiagnosed.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/Ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/a/global_hepA_epi.pdf Index | CDC Viral Hepatitis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
