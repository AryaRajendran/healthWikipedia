{{About|the physiological term|other uses|Compliance (disambiguation)}}

'''Compliance''' is the ability of a hollow organ (vessel) to distend and increase volume with increasing transmural pressure or the tendency of a hollow organ to resist recoil toward its original dimensions on application of a distending or compressing force. It is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of "elastance", hence elastance is a [[Measurement|measure]] of the tendency of a hollow [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] to [[recoil]] toward its original [[dimensions]] upon removal of a distending or compressing force.

==Blood vessels==
The terms elastance and compliance are of particular significance in [[cardiovascular physiology]] and [[respiratory physiology]]. In compliance, an increase in volume occurs in a vessel when the pressure in that vessel is increased. The tendency of the [[arteries]] and [[veins]] to stretch in response to pressure has a large effect on perfusion and blood pressure. This physically means that blood vessels with a higher compliance deform easier than lower compliance blood vessels under the same pressure and volume conditions.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|3/3ch7/s3ch7_10}}</ref> 
Venous compliance is approximately 30 times larger than arterial compliance.<ref name = "Gelman 2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181672607 |title=Venous Function and Central Venous Pressure |year=2008 |last1=Gelman |first1=Simon |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=735–48 |pmid=18362606}}</ref> 
Compliance is calculated using the following equation, where ΔV is the change in volume, and ΔP is the change in pressure:<ref>[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Blood%20Pressure/BP004.htm Vascular compliance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
:<math>C =  \frac{ \Delta V}{ \Delta P} </math> 

Physiologic compliance is generally in agreement with the above and adds [[dP/dt]] as a common academic physiologic measurement of both pulmonary and cardiac tissues. Adaptation of equations initially applied to [[rubber]] and [[latex]] allow modeling of the dynamics of pulmonary and cardiac tissue compliance.
   
Veins have a much higher compliance than arteries (largely due to their thinner walls.) Veins which are abnormally compliant can be associated with [[edema]]. [[Compression stockings|Pressure stockings]] are sometimes used to externally reduce compliance, and thus keep blood from pooling in the legs.

==Arterial compliance==
The classic definition by Spencer and Denison of compliance (C) is the change in arterial blood volume (ΔV) due to a given change in [[arterial blood pressure]] (ΔP). So, C = ΔV/ΔP.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Piergiorgio |last1=Tozzi |first2=Antonio |last2=Corno |first3=Daniel |last3=Hayoz |title=Definition of arterial compliance |journal=American Journal of Physiology |pmid=10787279 |url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10787279 |year=2000 |volume=278 |issue=4 |pages=H1407}}</ref>

Arterial compliance, an index of the [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of large arteries such as the [[thoracic aorta]]. Arterial compliance is an important cardiovascular risk factor. Compliance diminishes with age and menopause. Arterial compliance is measured by [[ultrasound]] as a pressure ([[carotid artery]]) and volume (outflow into [[aorta]]) relationship.<ref name="Pmid">{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.84.3.895 |title=Isoflavones from Red Clover Improve Systemic Arterial Compliance but Not Plasma Lipids in Menopausal Women |year=1999 |last1=Nestel |first1=P.

Arterial compliance in simple words is the action in which [[artery]] yields to pressure or force without disruption. It is used as an indication of [[arterial stiffness]]. An increase in the age and also in the systolic [[blood pressure]] (SBP) is accompanied with decrease on arterial compliance.<ref>{{Cite web

Endothelial dysfunction results in reduced compliance (increased arterial stiffness), especially in the smaller arteries. This is characteristic of patients with [[hypertension]]. However, it may be seen in normotensive patients (with normal blood pressure) before the appearance of clinical hypertension. Reduced arterial compliance is also seen in patients with [[diabetes]] and also in smokers. It is actually a part of a vicious cycle that further elevates blood pressure, aggravates [[atherosclerosis]] (hardening of the arteries), and leads to increased cardiovascular risk. Arterial compliance can be measured by several techniques. Most of them are invasive and are not clinically appropriate. [[Pulse contour analysis]] is a non-invasive method that allows easy measurement of arterial elasticity to identify patients at risk for cardiovascular events.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0895-7061(01)02154-9 |title=Arterial compliance to stratify cardiovascular risk: More precision in therapeutic decision making |year=2001 |last1=Cohn |first1=J |journal=American Journal of Hypertension |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=S258}}</ref>

== Natural factors of attenuation of the reduction on arterial compliance== 
A study concluded that arterial compliance, which diminishes with [[menopause]], was significantly improved with [[red clover]] [[isoflavones]].<ref name="Pmid" /> The results of another study support the hypothesis that [[fish oil]] alters vascular reactivity and favorably influences arterial wall characteristics in patients with non-insulin dependent [[diabetes mellitus]]. These direct vascular effects, expressed at the level of the vessel wall, may contribute to the cardioprotective(protective for the heart) actions of fish oil in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.ATV.14.9.1425 |title=Fish oil improves arterial compliance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus |year=1994 |last1=McVeigh |first1=G.

Another study concluded that one important measure of arterial health, [[systemic arterial compliance]], was significantly improved in perimenopausal and [[menopausal]] women taking [[soy]] [[isoflavones]] to about the same extent as is achieved with conventional [[hormone replacement therapy]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.ATV.17.12.3392 |title=Soy Isoflavones Improve Systemic Arterial Compliance but Not Plasma Lipids in Menopausal and Perimenopausal Women |year=1997 |last1=Nestel |first1=P.
