'''Binaural fusion''' (or binaural integration) is a [[cognitive]] process that involves the "fusion" of different [[auditory system|auditory]] information presented [[Sound localization|binaurally]], or to each [[ear]]. In humans, this process is essential in understanding [[speech]] as one ear may pick up more information about the speech [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] than the other. 

The process of binaural fusion is important for computing the location of sound sources in the [[horizontal plane]] ([[sound localization]]), and it is important for sound segregation.<ref name="Grothe2">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Koch |first2=Ursula |title=Dynamics of binaural processing in the mammalian sound localization pathway--the role of GABA(B) receptors |journal=Hearing Research |volume=279 |pages=43–50 |year=2011 |pmid=21447375 |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.03.013}}</ref> Sound segregation refers the ability to identify acoustic components from one or more sound sources.<ref name="Schwartz2">{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Andrew |last2=McDermott |first2=Josh |title=Spatial cues alone produce inaccurate sound segregation: The effect of inter aural time differences |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=132 |pages=357–368 |year=2012}}</ref> The binaural auditory system is highly dynamic and capable of rapidly adjusting tuning properties depending on the context in which sounds are heard. Each [[eardrum]] moves one-dimensionally; the auditory [[brain]] analyzes and compares movements of both eardrums to extract physical cues and synthesize auditory objects.<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref>

When stimulation from a [[sound]] reaches the ear, the eardrum deflects in a mechanical fashion, and the three middle ear bones ([[ossicles]]) transmit the mechanical signal to the [[cochlea]], where [[hair cell|hair cells]] transform the mechanical signal into an electrical signal. The auditory nerve, also called the [[cochlear nerve]], then transmits [[action potential|action potentials]] to the central auditory [[nervous system]].<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref>

In binaural fusion, inputs from both ears integrate and fuse to create a complete auditory picture at the [[brainstem]]. Therefore, the signals sent to the central auditory nervous system are representative of this complete picture, integrated information from both ears instead of a single ear. 

Binaural fusion is responsible for what is known as the [[cocktail party effect]], the ability of a listener to hear a particular speaker against other interfering voices.<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref>

The binaural squelch effect is a result of [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] of the brainstem processing timing, [[amplitude]], and spectral differences between the two ears. Sounds are integrated and then separated into auditory objects. For this effect to take place, neural integration from both sides is required.<ref name="Tyler">{{cite journal |last1=Tyler |first1=R.S. |last2=Dunn |first2=C.C. |last3=Witt |first3=S.A. |last4=Preece |first4=J.P. |title=Update on bilateral cochlear implantation |journal=Curr.

===Central auditory system===
The central auditory system converges inputs from both ears (inputs contain no explicit spatial information) onto single neurons within the brainstem. This system contains many subcortical sites that have integrative functions. The auditory nuclei collect, integrate, and analyze [[afferent]] supply,<ref name="Masterton">{{cite journal |last1=Masterton |first1=R.B. |title=Role of the central auditory system in hearing: the new direction |journal=Trends in neurosciences |volume=15 |pages=280–285 |year=1992 |pmid=1384196}}</ref> the outcome is a representation of auditory space.<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref> The subcortical auditory nuclei are responsible for extraction and analysis of dimensions of sounds.<ref name="Masterton">{{cite journal |last1=Masterton |first1=R.B. |title=Role of the central auditory system in hearing: the new direction |journal=Trends in neurosciences |volume=15 |pages=280–285 |year=1992 |pmid=1384196}}</ref>

Opin. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. |volume=11 |pages=388–393 |year=2003 |pmid=14502072}}</ref>

The cochlear nerve spans from the cochlea of the inner ear to the ventral cochlear nuclei located in the pons of the brainstem, relaying auditory signals to the superior olivary complex where it is to be binaurally integrated. 

===Medial superior olive and lateral superior olive===
The MSO contains cells that function in comparing inputs from the left and right cochlear nuclei.<ref name="Eldredge">{{cite journal |last1=Eldredge |first1=D.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.D. |title=Physiology of hearing |journal=Annu.

[[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors]] in the LSO and MSO are involved in balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are coupled to [[G protein|G proteins]] and provide a way of regulating synaptic efficacy. Specifically, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors modulate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the LSO.<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref> Whether the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor functions as excitatory or inhibitory for the postsynaptic neuron, depends on the exact location and action of the receptor.<ref name="Grothe2">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Koch |first2=Ursula |title=Dynamics of binaural processing in the mammalian sound localization pathway--the role of GABA(B) receptors |journal=Hearing Research |volume=279 |pages=43–50 |year=2011 |pmid=21447375 |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.03.013}}</ref>

===Sound localization===
Sound localization is the ability to correctly identify the directional location of sounds. A sound stimulus localized in the [[horizontal plane]] is called [[azimuth]]; in the [[vertical plane]] it is referred to as elevation. The time, intensity, and spectral differences in the sound arriving at the two ears are used in localization. Localization of low frequency sounds is accomplished by analyzing [[interaural time difference|interaural time difference (ITD)]]. Localization of high frequency sounds is accomplished by analyzing [[interaural level difference|interaural level difference (ILD)]].<ref name="Tyler">{{cite journal |last1=Tyler |first1=R.S. |last2=Dunn |first2=C.C. |last3=Witt |first3=S.A. |last4=Preece |first4=J.P. |title=Update on bilateral cochlear implantation |journal=Curr.

==Mechanism==

===Binaural hearing===
Action potentials originate in the [[hair cells]] of the [[cochlea]] and propagate to the [[brainstem]]; both the timing of these [[action potentials]] and the signal they transmit provide information to the [[superior olivary complex|SOC]] about the orientation of sound in space. The processing and propagation of action potentials is rapid, and therefore, information about the timing of the sounds that were heard, which is crucial to binaural processing, is conserved.<ref>{{cite web|last=Forsythe|first=Ian D.|title=Excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the superior olivary complex|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/symposia/abstracts-2001/Forsythe.pdf}}</ref> Each eardrum moves in one dimension, and the auditory brain analyzes and compares the movements of both eardrums in order to synthesize auditory objects.<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref> This integration of information from both ears is the essence of binaural fusion.

===Superior olivary complex===
The primary stage of binaural fusion, the processing of binaural signals, occurs at the SOC, where [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent fibers]] of the left and right auditory pathways first converge. This processing occurs because of the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the [[superior olivary complex#Lateral superior olive (LSO)|LSO]] and [[superior olivary complex#Medial superior olive (MSO)|MSO]].<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref><ref name="Eldredge">{{cite journal |last1=Eldredge |first1=D.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.D. |title=Physiology of hearing |journal=Annu.

====ITD and ILD====
The auditory space of binaural hearing is constructed based on the analysis of differences in two different binaural cues in the horizontal plane: sound level, or ILD, and arrival time at the two ears, or ITD, which allow for the comparison of the sound heard at each [[eardrum]].<ref name="Grothe2">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Koch |first2=Ursula |title=Dynamics of binaural processing in the mammalian sound localization pathway--the role of GABA(B) receptors |journal=Hearing Research |volume=279 |pages=43–50 |year=2011 |pmid=21447375 |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.03.013}}</ref><ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref> ITD is processed in the LSO and results from sounds arriving earlier at one ear than the other; this occurs when the sound does not arise from directly in front or directly behind the hearer. ILD is processed in the MSO and results from the shadowing effect that is produced at the ear that is farther from the sound source. Outputs from the SOC are targeted to the [[lateral lemniscus#DNLL|dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus]] as well as the [[inferior colliculus|IC]].<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref> 

====Lateral superior olive====
LSO neurons are excited by inputs from one ear and inhibited by inputs from the other, and are therefore referred to as IE neurons. Excitatory inputs are received at the LSO from [[anterior cochlear nucleus#Spherical|spherical bushy cells]] of the [[anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|ipsilateral]] cochlear nucleus, which combine inputs coming from several auditory nerve fibers. Inhibitory inputs are received at the LSO from [[anterior cochlear nucleus#Globular|globular bushy cells]] of the [[anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|contralateral]] cochlear nucleus.<ref name="Grothe">{{cite journal |last1=Grothe |first1=Benedikt |last2=Pecka |first2=Michael |last3=McAlpine |first3=David |title=Mechanisms of sound localization in mammals |journal=Physiol Rev |volume=90 |pages=983–1012 |year=2010 |pmid=20664077 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00026.2009}}</ref>

==Binaural fusion abnormalities in autism==
Current research is being performed on the dysfunction of binaural fusion in individuals with [[autism]]. The [[neurological disorder]] autism is associated with many symptoms of impaired brain function, including the degradation of hearing, both unilateral and bilateral.<ref name="Rosenhall">{{cite journal |last1=Rosenhall |first1=U |last2=Nordin |first2=V |last3=Sandstrom |first3=M |title=Autism and hearing loss |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=29 |pages=349–357 |year=1999 |pmid=10587881}}</ref> Individuals with autism who experience hearing loss maintain symptoms such as difficulty listening to background noise and impairments in sound localization. Both the ability to distinguish particular speakers from background noise and the process of sound localization are key products of binaural fusion.

Moreover, a significant depletion of SOC neurons is seen in the brainstem of autistic individuals.
