'''Distraction osteogenesis''', also called '''callus distraction''',<ref name="DeBastiani87">{{harvnb|De Bastiani|1987}}</ref> '''callotasis'''<ref name="DeBastiani87" /> and '''osteodistraction'''<ref name="Tavakoli98">{{harvnb|Tavakoli|1998}}</ref> is a [[Surgery|surgical]] process used to reconstruct [[Skeleton|skeletal]] [[Deformity|deformities]] and lengthen the [[long bone]]s of the body.  A [[corticotomy]] is used to [[bone fracture|fracture]] the [[bone]] into two segments, and the two bone ends of the bone are gradually moved apart during the distraction phase, allowing [[Bone healing|new bone]] to form in the gap.<ref name="DeBastiani87" /><ref name="Paley97Comparison">{{harvnb|Paley|1997}}</ref><ref name="Aquerreta94">{{harvnb|Aquerreta|1994}}</ref> When the desired or possible length is reached, a ''consolidation phase'' follows in which the bone is allowed to keep healing.  Distraction osteogenesis has the benefit of simultaneously increasing bone length and the volume of surrounding [[soft tissue]]s.

==History==
In 1905, [[Alessandro Codivilla]] introduced surgical practices for lengthening of the lower limbs.<ref name="Codivilla1905">{{cite journal | last = Codivilla | first = Alessandro | year = 1905 | title = On the means of lengthening in the lower limbs, the muscles, and tissues which are shortened through deformity. | journal = American Journal of Orthopedics Surgery" | volume = 2 | pages = 353 }}</ref> Early techniques had a high number of [[Complication (medicine)|complications]], particularly during [[Bone healing|healing]], and often resulted in a failure to achieve the goal of the surgery.<ref name="Mosca86">{{cite journal | last = Mosca | first = V. | coauthors = Moseley, C.F. | year = 1986 | title = Complications of Wagner leg lengthening and their avoidance | journal = Orthop. Trans. | volume = 10 | pages = 462 }}</ref><ref name="Baumgart97" />

In 1934 the New York Hospital For Joint Disease worked on an early method developed by Ilizarov.  The major item that the US team of surgeons developed was the metal frame the leg was placed in to hold it perfectly in place until the cut made in the bone was healed over.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=HCgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane&hl=en&ei=dvsKTffpK8ShnAfqofGVDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q&f=true "Surgeon Stretches Crippled Legs", September 1934, Popular Science]</ref>

The breakthrough came with a technique introduced by [[Russia]]n orthopedic surgeon [[Gavriil Ilizarov]].<ref name="Baumgart97" />  Ilizarov developed a procedure based on the biology of the bone and on the ability of the surrounding [[soft-tissues]] to regenerate under [[Tension (physics)|tension]]; the technique involved an external fixator, the [[Ilizarov apparatus]], structured as a modular ring.<ref name="Baumgart97" />  Although the types of complications remained the same ([[infection]], the most common complication occurring particularly along the pin tracks, [[pain]], [[nerve]] and [[soft tissue]] irritation<ref name="Baumgart97" />) the Ilizarov technique reduced the frequency and severity of the complications.<ref name="Paley90IlizarovComplications" />  The Ilizarov technique made the surgery safer,<ref name="Palye88techniques">{{cite journal | last = Paley | first = Dror | year = 1988 | title = Current techniques of limb lengthening | journal = Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–92 | pmid = 3275690 | doi = 10.1097/01241398-198801000-00018 }}</ref> and allowed the goal of lengthening the limb to be achieved.

==Difficulties arising during distraction osteogenesis==
Difficulties that may arise during distraction osteogenesis are commonly classified in medical scientific literature according to the standard introduced by professor [[Dror Paley]] in a 1990 article.<ref name="Paley90IlizarovComplications" /> Paley distinguished among problems (defined as "''a difficulty that arises during the distraction or fixation period that is fully resolved by the end of the treatment period by non operative means''"), obstacles, and complications.

==Techniques==
===Using exclusively an external fixator===
The most common is the Ilizarov surgery with the Ilizarov external fixator. Other external fixators are Wagner,<ref name="WagnerLongTerm">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004694-200205000-00021 |author=Zarzycki D, Tesiorowski M, Zarzycka M, Kacki W, Jasiewicz B |title=Long-term results of lower limb lengthening by the Wagner method |journal=J Pediatr Orthop |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=371–4 |year=2002 |pmid=11961458 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0271-6798&volume=22&issue=3&spage=371}}</ref> Orthofix and Judet. Dr. Helong Bai (8th Hospital in Chongqing, China) developed the technique "Micro-wound" with a different apparatus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shortsupport.org/Health/Leg-Lengthening/new_devel.html |title=Short Persons Support: Health : Cosmetic Leg Lengthening : New Procedures }}</ref>

====Ilizarov surgery====

[[Image:Ilizarov.jpg|right]]
Ilizarov [[surgery]], developed by [[Gavriil Ilizarov]], a [[Russians|Russian]] orthopedic [[surgery|surgeon]], in 1951, is the oldest and most common method of distraction osteogenesis. It often brings complications,<ref name="Paley90IlizarovComplications">{{cite journal

 }}</ref> while some new methods have a much lower rate of complications. 

The process involves the following:
* Shattered bones and [[Blood vessel|devascularised]] ones are removed from the patient, leaving a gap;
* The healthy part of the upper bone is broken into two segments with an external [[saw]];
* The leg is then fitted with the Ilizarov frame that pierces through the [[skin]], [[muscle]]s, and bone;
* [[Screw]]s attached to the middle bone are turned 1 millimetre (mm) per day, so that new [[Osseous tissue|bone tissues]] that are formed in the growth zone are gradually pulled apart to increase the gap (One millimetre has been found to be the [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] bone distraction rate. Lengthening too fast overstretches the soft tissues, resulting not only in pain, but also in the inability of the bone to fill up the gap; too slow, and the bone hardens before the full lengthening process is complete.);
* After the gap is closed, the patient continues to wear the frame until the new bone solidifies; the waiting period before the frame can be removed is usually one month per centimetre of lengthened bone.

Ilizarov surgery is extremely painful, uncomfortable, [[infection]]-prone, and often causes unsightly [[scar]]s ''{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}''. Frames used to be made of [[stainless steel]] rings weighing up to 7 kilogram (kg), but newer models are made of [[Carbon fiber reinforced plastic]], which though lighter, are equally cumbersome.

Derivative devices provide physicians better control over the bone axis and angle during elongation, such as the [[Taylor Spatial Frame]] (TSF) which is computer assisted. The downside of these developments are their relative complexity and resulting longer learning curve.

For decades, the Ilizarov procedure was the best chance for shattered bones to be restored, and crooked ones straightened. Breakthroughs in distraction osteogenesis in the 1990s, however, have resulted in less painful (albeit more expensive) alternatives, such as unilateral rails.

===Using exclusively an intramedullary nail===
The techniques that use an [[intramedullary nail]] without an external fixator are: Albizzia, Bliskunov, Guichet, Fitbone and ISKD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allongement-os-grandir.com/index-eng.php?page=nails# |title=Orthoped — J. M. GUICHET }}</ref>

===The Guichet Method===
Invented in 1987 by [[Jean-Marc Guichet|Dr. Jean-Marc Guichet MD]], the [[Albizzia nail]] was created during his residency at the University Center (CHU) of Dijon, France. The Albizzia nail is inserted into the bone canal after it is calibrated with a reamer. The nail is then fixed to the ends of the bone fragments with screws. The nail consists of two sliding tubes that rotate in relation to the other, allowing for the nail to extend through a series of “clicks.” After insertion, the patient “clicks” the nail by turning the knee and leg (femoral nail) or foot (tibial nail) alternating inward and outward rotations to gradually lengthen. 15 clicks per day results in 1mm of gain. Expansions of up to 10&nbsp;cm have been reported. The Albizzia nail is used in almost 30 countries and over 3,000 nails have been implanted. 

In 2009, Dr. Guichet [[patented]] the [[Guichet Nail]]. The Guichet Nail is an improved version of the Albizzia nail because it uses stronger steel that allows for full weight bearing activity almost immediately after surgery. Furthermore, the Guichet Nail is customizable for size to ensure maximum comfort and efficiency for patients with smaller bones. Although there is initial pain after the surgery and during the clicks, the Guichet Nail is believed to be less painful than other methods as it is less invasive. Furthermore, as the patient controls the method of “clicking,” the patient is able to reduce pain by determining the most suitable method for themselves. 

The Guichet Nail is currently used exclusively at the [http://www.leglengtheningclinic.com Leg Lengthening Clinic] in [[Marseilles]], France. Founded in 2011 by Guichet and Keeper, the clinic specializes in cosmetic leg lengthening surgeries. With worldwide recognition for being the foremost knowledgeable limb [[reconstruction]] [[surgeon]] with respect to internal fixators in the world, Dr. Guichet has successfully completed over 350 limb lengthening procedures.

====Intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor====
In 2001, the "[[Intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor]]" (ISKD) was introduced, allowing lengthening to take place internally, thereby drastically reducing the risk of infections and scarring.  The ISKD device was designed by [[Dr. J. Dean Cole, MD]] of [[Orlando, Florida]].

With ISKD, a telescopic rod that can be gradually extended by [[knee]] or [[ankle]] rotations is implanted into the bone. Lengthening is monitored by a hand-held external [[Magnetism|magnetic]] [[sensor]] that tracks the rotation of an internal [[magnet]] on a daily basis.

ISKD requires a physical leg movement to "click" the device into lengthening. In this method, there is no risk of accidentally over-stretching the bone due to the lengthener being preset to the desired fully extended length.  However, there is a risk of growing the bone too quickly.  Bone growth is monitored by measuring changes in the magnetic field of an embedded magnet in the system.  The poles of the magnet change as the device grows.  However, if the motion of the leg makes the device grow too quickly, and the magnet switches poles twice between measurements, then that growth is not recorded.  This leads to overly rapid growth which can cause a number of issues such as nerve damage or causing breaks in the bone.

While there is some pain associated with the immediate post-op lengthening, the initial lengthening procedure is not to begin until one week after surgery.  Furthermore, there is no noticeable "click" to the patient as there is less than nine degrees of rotation of the two bone segments in relation to one another.

Regularly used at a handful of medical centers mostly in the United States, only several dozens of ISKD devices are implanted each year. An improved version is currently being developed by its manufacturer (Orthofix).

====Fitbone surgery====
A form of surgery involving an intramedullar, fully implantable, [[Electronics|electronically]]-[[Electric motor|motorised]] limb-lengthening implant,<ref name="Baumgart97">{{cite journal | last =  Baumgart | first = Rainer | coauthors = Augustin Betz, Leonhard Schweiberer | year = 1997 | month = October | title = A Fully Implantable Motorized Intramedullary Nail for Limb Lengthening and Bone Transport | journal = Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research | volume = 343 | pages = 135–143 | url = http://www.corronline.com/pt/re/corr/abstract.00003086-199710000-00023.htm;jsessionid=FSHQ4RjMvGXdZQK2fGxznvjsnR1hrypMmdXYZNZHT2Fqh2zxg2NR!-2083468996!-949856145!8091!-1 | accessdate = 2006-12-27}}</ref> called "Fitbone", is a [[Technology|technologically]] advanced, though relatively complex, device.

Developed in [[Germany]] by [[Augustin Betz]] and [[Rainer Baumgart]], the first successful operations were performed in 1996 and the technique was [[patent]]ed in 1997. Thus far, most of the surgeries using this method have been performed in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] by Baumgart and [[Peter Thaller]]. The first successful surgeries in Asia have been performed since 2001 by Dr Sarbjit Singh in [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]], [[Singapore]], and Dr Sittiporn, [[Bumrungrad Hospital]], [[Bangkok]]. In December 2005 Fitbone surgery was done in [[Malaysia]] at the [[Mahkota Orthopaedic Reconstruction and Limb Lengthening Center]], [[Melaka]] by Thirukumaran Subramaniam and Jeyaratnam T Satkunasingam. Dr. Bruce Foster of Adelaide, Australia, chairman of the "Bone Growth Foundation" — a charity established with the aim of helping children with crippling bone growth problems — is currently the only surgeon that uses the "Fitbone" device in the southern hemisphere.

''Fitbone'' comprises a telescopic nail [[implant (medicine)|implant]] that can extend, powered by an electric motor and controlled by a receiver with an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] that is buried under the skin; the receiver in turn is controlled by a hand-held [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] [[transmitter]]. The procedure for lengthening the lower leg is as follows:
* A two-centimetre incision is made at the patient's knee, and a reamer is used to create enough space in the bone for a stainless steel nail.
* The bone is cut about 14&nbsp;cm below the knee from the inside with an internal saw.
* The stainless steel nail is held in place by two screws. The top of the nail is attached to a tiny, [[plastic]]-encased [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] that is placed under the skin.
* The patient controls the lengthening process. By pushing a button on the transmitter when it is placed against the antenna, the built-in motor extends the nail one millimetre per day. When the leg has grown to the desired length, lengthening stops, and the bone is allowed to solidify.
* The device can be removed about two years after the initial surgery.

This procedure, however, comes at a price. While the Ilizarov [[External fixation|external fixator]] costs approximately US$4,000, and the ISKD implant about US$8,000, the ''Fitbone'' device carries a price tag of roughly US$15,000 (all prices exclusive of surgery costs).

The Bliskunov device is currently not available.

====Future technology====
Due to shortcomings of current external and internal devices and the evident market potential of cosmetic limb elongation, a growing number of companies are researching potential intramedullary technologies. These include:
* Concepts based on electromagnetic actuation
* Concepts based on smart material integration
* Concepts based on manual actuation
* Concepts based on electronic actuation

Biotechnological advances, such as in [[stem cell]] research, may become the next generation standard of care for limb elongation once it matures, possibly within a decade or two.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Post-surgical care==
Following the initial surgery, patients must undergo a demanding [[Physical therapy|physiotherapy]] regime comprising [[Stretching#Stretching in preparation for a physical activity|stretching exercises]] and at times, they may be required to be hooked up to a "continuous passive motion" device. The purpose is to avoid stiffness and to stimulate the muscles, [[nerve]]s and [[blood vessels]] to grow alongside the bone. Patients are often prescribed [[Analgesic|painkillers]] and are unable to work while undergoing [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

==Aspects in limb lengthening==
===Maxillofacial Distraction Osteogenesis===

Correcting the majority of [[congenital]] [[craniofacial]] defects, as well as some facial injuries resulting from [[Physical trauma|trauma]], requires making bones longer.  Distraction osteogenesis is an effective way to grow new bone, but it is much more difficult to accomplish in the face than in other areas of the body.  Bones must often be moved in three dimensions, as opposed to just one, as in a limb, and scarring must be kept to a minimum.  
Researchers<ref>Led by Dr. Leonard B. Kaban of Massachusetts General Hospital</ref> are attempting to improve the distraction devices used in the face.  Until recently, the mechanisms were external and only operated along straight lines.  Now, maxillofacial surgeons can use curvilinear devices capable of moving bone in three dimensions.  

These new devices still need to be improved.  They depend on patient caretakers reliably turning a screw.  The next goal is to create devices that will move bone continuously, not in daily increments of 1&nbsp;mm.  These continuously moving devices would cause less pain, wouldn’t require daily patient compliance, and might promote faster bone growth.  At the moment, researchers are testing a continuously moving device in [[animal models]], and they have found that the device’s components are durable, that its user interface works, and that it is tolerated by the body.  When the position sensor in the device is perfected, the device will be ready to use in people.  

In distraction osteogenesis procedures involving the face, it is critical that bone movements be carefully planned before a device is implanted.  No existing device is capable of changing its [[trajectory]] mid-course, and small skeletal changes lead to large changes in the structure of the face. Recently researchers have developed state-of-the-art software capable of simulating the entire process of distraction osteogenesis.<ref>With financial support from CIMIT, Dr. Kaban’s team has spreaheaded this effort</ref>  The [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] planning tool uses data from [[CT scans]] to create a segmented model of the patient’s skull, and it then calculates the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] of movement required to achieve desirable bone positioning.  [[Outcome CT scans]] can be overlaid on the original model to assess the effectiveness of the procedure.  In the future, researchers hope that the distraction devices used in [[maxillofacial]] procedures will continue to improve, along with the corresponding software.<ref>Leonard B. Kaban, “Bone Lengthening by Distraction Osteogenesis,” CIMIT Forum, October 2, 2007</ref>

The most important aspects for the success of bone distraction are an intact medullary blood supply, preservation of soft-tissue envelope, primarily the [[periosteum]] (which helps preserve the blood supply) and secondarly [[bone marrow]] and the stability of the fixator.<ref name="Guichet03">{{cite journal | last = Guichet | first = Jean-Marc | coauthors = Barbara Deromedis, Leo T.

===Distraction rate===
The distraction rate must be gradual, as a rapid rate of distraction will result in a fibrous union in which the bone pieces are joined by [[Fibrous connective tissue|fibrous]], rather than [[osseous tissue]].<ref name="RatAcuteLengthening">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00006534-200102000-00021 |author=Warren SM, Mehrara BJ, Steinbrech DS, ''et al.'' |title=Rat mandibular distraction osteogenesis: part III.

Too slow of a distraction rate would result in early bone consolidation. A common distraction rate for lower limbs is 1 millimeter per day.<ref name="DistractionRate">{{cite journal  |author= ALDEGHERI, R. |title=Distraction Osteogenesis for Lengthening of the Tibia in Patients Who Have Limb-Length Discrepancy or Short Stature |journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=624–634 |year=1999 |month=May |pmid=10360691 |url=http://jbjs.org/article.aspx?Volume=81&page=624}}</ref>

==Possible uses of distraction osteogenesis==
Although distraction osteogenesis is most often used in the treatment of post-[[Physical trauma|traumatic]] injuries, it is increasingly used to correct limb discrepancies caused by [[Congenital disorder|congenital conditions]] and old injuries. A list of the possible uses of distraction osteogenesis are as follows:

* Congenital deformities (birth defects):
** Congenital short [[femur]].
** [[Fibular hemimelia]] (absence of the [[fibula]], which is one of the two bones between the knee and the ankle).
** [[Hemihypertrophy]] (a rare genetic condition in which growth is greater on one side of the body. This can be complete (everything from the bone to the skin on one entire half of the body) or partial (just one leg or arm).
** [[Ollier's disease]].
* Developmental deformities
** [[Neurofibromatosis]] (a rare condition which causes overgrowth in one leg); and
** Bow legs, resulting from [[rickets]] or secondary [[arthritis]].
* Post-traumatic injuries
** [[Growth plate]]s fractures;
** Malunion or non-union (when bones do not completely join, or join in a faulty position after a fracture);
** Shortening and deformity; and
** Bone defects.
* Infections and [[disease]]s
** [[Osteomyelitis]] (a bone infection, usually caused by [[bacteria]]);
** [[Septic arthritis]] (infections or bacterial arthritis); and
** [[Poliomyelitis]] (a [[Virus|viral]] disease which may result in the atrophy of muscles, causing permanent deformity).
* After [[tumor]]s
* [[Short stature]]
** [[Achondroplasia]] (a form of [[dwarfism]] where arms and legs are very short, but [[torso]] is more normal in size); and
** [[Constitutional short stature]].

===Cosmetic lengthening of limbs===
Generally, doctors tend to discourage{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} [[beauty|cosmetic]] lengthening for people who want to add a couple of inches to their frames because such people are:
* breaking perfectly functional limbs;
* confining themselves unnecessarily to [[crutch]]es or a [[wheelchair]] for over a year;
* voluntarily subjecting themselves to pain and discomfort;
* exposing themselves to unnecessary  risk of infections, of damaged nerves and blood vessels, and fat [[embolism]] that can result in death; and
* incurring unnecessary expenses as the procedure is relatively expensive.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

People insistent on doing the procedure, however, are required by some doctors{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} to undergo a thorough [[body image]] [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] by a [[psychologist]] to help determine how far the person's quality of life has been affected by his perceived lack of height, and if doing the surgery will make a marked difference.

==In popular culture==

The protagonist of the movie ''[[Gattaca]]'' undergoes a limb lengthening procedure, along with other extreme methods, in order to impersonate another person and thus avoid genetic discrimination.

In [[Ian Fleming]]'s James Bond novel ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'', Dr. No alludes to using leg-lengthing to increase his height to roughly 7 feet tall as part of a larger scheme to mask his identity.
