Hospice care is a type and philosophy of care that focuses on the [[palliative care]] of a [[terminally ill]] or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs.  [[Hospice care in the United States|Within the United States]] the term is largely defined by the practices of the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] system and other [[health insurance]] providers, which make hospice care available, either in an inpatient facility or at the patient's home, to patients with a terminal prognosis who are medically certified to have less than six months to live.  Outside the United States, the term ''hospice'' tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialise in such care (although so-called "hospice at home" services may also be available).  Outside the United States such institutions may similarly mostly provide care in an end-of-life setting; but they may also be available for patients with other specific palliative care needs.

The focus of hospice care is on [[Palliative care|palliation]] of the patient's pain and symptoms. These symptoms may be physical, emotional, or psychosocial in nature. Hospice care focuses on bringing comfort, self-respect, and tranquility to people in the final years of life. Patients’ symptoms and pain are controlled, goals of care are discussed and emotional needs are supported. Hospice believes that the end of life is not a medical experience, it is a human experience that benefits from expert medical and holistic support that hospice offers.  The concept of hospice has been evolving since the 11th century. Then, and for centuries thereafter, hospices were places of hospitality for the sick, wounded, or dying, as well as those for travelers and pilgrims. The modern concept of hospice includes palliative care for the incurably ill given in such institutions as [[hospital]]s or [[nursing home]]s, but also care provided to those who would rather spend their last months and days of life in their own homes. It began to emerge in the 17th century, but many of the foundational principles by which modern hospice services operate were pioneered in the 1950s by Dame [[Cicely Saunders]]. Hospice care also involves assistance for patients’ families to help them cope with what is happening and provide care and support to keep the patient at home. Although the movement has met with some resistance, hospice has rapidly expanded through the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Hospice care in the United States|United States]] and elsewhere.

==History==

===Early development===
Linguistically, the word "hospice" derives from the Latin ''hospes'', a word which served double duty in referring both to guests and hosts.<ref name=Robbins>{{cite book | last = Robbins | first = Joy | title = Caring for the Dying Patient and the Family | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 1983 | page = 138 | isbn = 0-06-318249-1}}</ref> Historians believe the first hospices originated in the 11th century, around 1065. The rise of the Crusading movement in the 1090s saw the incurably ill permitted into places dedicated to treatment by [[Crusades|Crusaders]].<ref name=Robbins/><ref>{{cite book | last = Connor |first = Stephen R. |  title = Hospice: Practice, Pitfalls, and Promise | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-56032-513-5 | page = 4}}

Meanwhile, hospices also developed in other areas. In the [[United Kingdom]], attention was drawn to the needs of the terminally ill in the middle of the 19th century, with ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' and the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' publishing articles pointing to the need of the impoverished terminally ill for good care and sanitary conditions.<ref name=L21>Lewis, 21.</ref> Steps were taken to remedy inadequate facilities with the opening of the Friedenheim in London, which by 1892 offered 35 beds to patients dying of tuberculosis.<ref name=L21/> Four more hospices were established in London by 1905.<ref name=L21/> [[Australia]], too, saw active hospice development, with notable hospices including the Home for Incurables in [[Adelaide]] (1879), the Home of Peace (1902) and the Anglican House of Peace for the Dying in [[Sydney]] (1907).<ref>Lewis, 23-25.</ref> In 1899, [[New York City]] saw the opening of St. Rose's Hospice by the Servants for Relief of Incurable Cancer, who soon expanded with six locations in other cities.<ref name=Lewis/> 

The more influential early developers of Hospice included the Irish [[Religious Sisters of Charity]], who opened [[Our Lady's Hospice]] in [[Harold's Cross]], [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] in 1879.<ref name=Lewis/> It became very busy, with as many as 20,000 people—primarily suffering [[tuberculosis]] and [[cancer]]—coming to the hospice to die between 1845 and 1945.<ref name=Lewis/> The Sisters of Charity expanded internationally, opening the Sacred Heart Hospice for the Dying in Sydney in 1890, with hospices in [[Melbourne]] and [[New South Wales]] following in the 1930s.<ref>Lewis, 22-23.</ref> In 1905, they opened [[St Joseph's Hospice]] in [[London]].<ref name=C5/><ref>{{cite book | last = Foley | first = Kathleen M. | coauthors = Herbert Hendin | title = The Case Against Assisted Suicide: For the Right to End-of-life Care | publisher = JHU Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-8018-6792-4 | page = 281}}</ref> There in the 1950s [[Cicely Saunders]] developed many of the foundational principles of modern hospice care.<ref name=C5/>

===Rise of the modern hospice movement===
[[File:St. Christopher's Hospice.jpg|thumb|right|St Christopher's Hospice in 2005]]
(Dame) Cicely Saunders was a British [[registered nurse]] whose chronic health problems had forced her to pursue a career in [[medical social work]]. The relationship she developed with a dying [[Poland|Polish]] refugee helped solidify her ideas that terminally ill patients needed compassionate care to help address their fears and concerns as well as [[palliative]] comfort for physical symptoms.<ref name=Poor>{{cite book | last = Poor | first = Belinda | coauthors = Gail P.

When she achieved her degree in 1957, she took a position there.<ref name=Poor/> 

Saunders emphasized focusing on the patient rather than the disease and introduced the notion of 'total pain',<ref>{{cite journal|title=Total Pain: The Work of Cicely Saunders and the Hospice Movement|author=David Clark, PhD|url=http://www.ampainsoc.org/pub/bulletin/jul00/hist1.htm|journal=APS Bulletin| volume = 10 |issue =  4|date=July/August 2000}}</ref> which included psychological and spiritual as well as the physical aspects. She experimented with a wide range of [[opioid]]s for controlling physical pain but included also the needs of the patient's family.

She disseminated her philosophy internationally in a series of tours of the United States that began in 1963.<ref name=Spratt>{{cite book | last = Spratt | first = John Stricklin | coauthors = Rhonda L.

[[Florence Wald]], the dean of [[Yale School of Nursing]] who had heard Saunders speak in America, spent a month working with Saunders there in 1969 before bringing the principles of modern hospice care back to the United States, establishing Hospice, Inc. in 1971.<ref name="C5"/><ref name=WashPostObit>Sullivan, Patricia.

Accessed November 13, 2008.</ref>

At about the same time that Saunders was disseminating her theories and developing her hospice, in 1965, Swiss [[psychiatrist]] [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] also began to consider the social responses to terminal illness, which she found inadequate at the Chicago hospital where her American physician husband was employed.<ref name=Reed>{{cite news | last = Reed | first = Christopher | title = Elisabeth Kubler-Ross: Psychiatrist who identified five stages of dying - denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance | work = The Guardian | date = 2004-08-31 | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref> Her 1969 best-seller, ''[[On Death and Dying]]'', was influential on how the medical profession responded to the terminally ill,<ref name=Reed/> and along with Saunders and other [[thanatology]] pioneers helped to focus attention on the types of care available to them.<ref name=Spratt/>

Hospice has faced resistance springing from various factors, including professional or cultural [[taboo]]s against open communication about death among physicians or the wider population, discomfort with unfamiliar medical techniques, and professional callousness towards the terminally ill.<ref name = Kirn>{{cite journal | last = Kirn | first = Marie | title = Book review | work = Journal of Palliative Medicine | date = June 1, 1998 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–202 | journal = Journal of Palliative Medicine | doi = 10.1089/jpm.1998.1.201 | url = http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jpm.1998.1.201 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the movement has, with national differences in focus and application, spread throughout the world.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bernat | first = James L. | title = Ethical Issues in Neurology | edition = 3, revised | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7817-9060-3 | page = 154}}</ref> 

In 1984, Dr. [[Josefina Magno]], who had been instrumental in forming the [[American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]] and sat as first executive director of the US [[National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization|National Hospice Organization]], founded the International Hospice Institute, which in 1996 became the International Hospice Institute and College and later the [[International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care]] (IAHPC).<ref>{{cite book | last = Saunders, Cicely M. | coauthors = David Clark | title= Cicely Saunders: Founder of the Hospice Movement : Selected Letters 1959-1999 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-19-856969-6 | page = 283}}</ref><ref name=BMJ>{{cite journal | last = Newman | first = Laura | title = Josefina Bautista Magno | date = 2009-09-27 | issue = 327 (7417) | page = 753 | quote = That vision, fuelled by her drive and gritty determination, led to the International Hospice Institute, soon to metamorphose into the International Hospice Institute and College as the need for education and training became recognised, and finally into today's International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care. | pmc=200824}}</ref> The IAHPC, with a board of directors as of 2008 from such diverse countries as [[Scotland]], [[Argentina]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Uganda]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hospicecare.com/Organisation/#directors | title = IAHPC Board of Directors | publisher = International Association for Hospice & Palliative Care | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}</ref> works from the philosophy that each country should develop a palliative care model based on its own resources and conditions, evaluating hospice experiences in other countries but adapting to their own needs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hospicecare.com/History/history.htm | title = IAHPC History | publisher = International Association for Hospice & Palliative Care | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}</ref> Dr. Derek Doyle, who was a founding member of IAHPC, told the ''British Medical Journal'' in 2003 that through her work the [[Philippine]]-born Magno had seen "more than 8000 hospice and palliative services established in more than 100 countries."<ref name=BMJ/> Standards for Palliative and Hospice Care have been developed in a number of countries around the world, including Australia, [[Canada]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Moldova]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hospicecare.com/standards/ | title = Standards for Palliative Care Provision | publisher = International Association for Hospice & Palliative Care | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}</ref>

In 2006, the United States based [[National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization]] (NHPCO) and the United Kingdom's [[Help the Hospices]] jointly commissioned an independent, international study of worldwide palliative care practices. Their survey found that 15% of the world's countries offered widespread palliative care services with integration into major health care institutions, while an additional 35% offered some form of palliative care services, though these might be localized or very limited.<ref name=Connor>{{cite book | last = Connor | first = Stephen | title = Hospice and Palliative Care: The Essential Guide | edition = 2nd | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-415-99356-3 | page = 202}}</ref> As of 2009, there were an estimated 10,000 programs internationally intended to provide palliative care, although the term hospice is not always employed to describe such services.<ref>Connor, 201.</ref>

In hospice care the main guardians are the family care giver and a hospice nurse who makes periodic stops.  Hospice can be administered in a nursing home, hospice building, or sometimes a hospital; however, it is most commonly practiced in the home.<ref>{{cite web|last=Villet-Lagomarsino|first=A|title=Hospice and Palliative Care: A Comparison|publisher=PBS}}</ref> In order to be considered for hospice care, one has to be terminally ill or expected to die in six months.

Since the foundation of hospice in Kenya in the early 1990s, palliative care has spread through the country. Representatives of Nairobi Hospice sit on the committee to develop a Health Sector Strategic Plan for the [[Ministry of Health (Kenya)|Ministry of Health]] and are working with the Ministry of Health to help develop specific palliative care guidelines for cervical cancer.<ref name=Mapping/> The [[Politics of Kenya|Government of Kenya]] has supported hospice by donating land to Nairobi Hospice and providing funding to several of its nurses.<ref name=Mapping/>

In South Africa, hospice services are widespread, focusing on diverse communities (including orphans and homeless) and offered in diverse settings (including in-patient, day care and home care).<ref name=Mapping/> Over half of hospice patients in South Africa in the 2003-2004 year were diagnosed with [[AIDS]], with the majority of the remaining having been diagnosed with [[cancer]].<ref name=Mapping/> Palliative care in South Africa is supported by the Hospice Palliative Care Association of South Africa and by national programmes partly funded by the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]].<ref name=Mapping/> 

[[Hospice Africa Uganda]] (HAU) began offering services in 1993 in a two-bedroom house loaned for the purpose by [[Nsambya Hospital]].<ref name=Mapping/> HAU has since expanded to a base of operations at [[Makindye]], [[Kampala]], with hospice services also offered at roadside clinics by Mobile Hospice [[Mbarara]] since January 1998.

Canadian physician [[Balfour Mount]], who first coined the term "palliative care", was a pioneer in the Canadian hospice movement, which focuses primarily on palliative care in a hospital setting.<ref name=Forman>{{cite book | last = Forman  | first = Walter B. | coauthors = Denice Kopchak Sheehan, Judith A.

However, as of 2004, according to the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association (CHPCA), hospice palliative care was only available to 5-15% of Canadians, with available services having decreased with reduced government funding.<ref name=CHPCA>{{cite web | url = http://www.chpca.net/public_policy_advocacy/january_2006_policy_alerts/Factsheet-HospicePalliativeCareinCanada-December+2+2004.pdf | title = Fact Sheet: Hospice Palliative Care in Canada  | date = December 2004 | publisher = Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}</ref> At that time, Canadians were increasingly expressing a desire to die at home, but only two of Canada's ten provinces were provided medication cost coverage for care provided at home.<ref name=CHPCA/> Only four of the ten identified palliative care as a core health service.<ref name=CHPCA/> At that time, palliative care was not widely taught at nursing schools or universally certified at medical colleges; there were only 175 specialized palliative care physicians in all of Canada.<ref name=CHPCA/>

{{main|Hospice care in the United States}}
Hospice in the United States has grown from a volunteer-led movement to improve care for people dying alone, isolated, or in hospitals, to a significant part of the health care system. In 2010, an estimated 1.581 million patients received services from hospice. Hospice is the only Medicare benefit that includes pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, twenty-four hour/seven day a week access to care and support for loved ones following a death. Hospice care is also covered by Medicaid and most private insurance plans.  Most hospice care is delivered at home. Hospice care is also available to people in home-like hospice residences, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, veterans' facilities, hospitals, and prisons. The first hospice in the US was the Connecticut Hospice. 

The first United States hospital-based palliative care programs began in the late 1980s by committed volunteers across the country.   A handful of institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic and Medical College of Wisconsin were among the early programs. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry in the United States, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification.<ref name=Plocher222>{{cite book | last= Plocher | first = David W. | coauthors= Patricia L.

The hospice movement has grown dramatically in the United Kingdom since Saunders opened St. Christopher's in 1967. According to the UK's [http://www.helpthehospices.org.uk/welcome/ Help the Hospices] in 2011, UK hospice services consisted of 220 inpatient units for adults (2009:220 with 3,175 beds (2009:3,203), 42 inpatient units for children (2009:39) with 334 beds (2009: 298), 288 home care services (2009:314), 127 hospice at home services (2009:106), 272 day care services (2009:280), and 343 hospital support services (2009:346).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.helpthehospices.org.uk/about-hospice-care/facts-figures/ | title = Facts and figures | publisher = Help the Hospices | accessdate = 2009-02-19 and 2012-10-02}}</ref> These services together helped over 250,000 patients in 2003 & 2004. Funding varies from 100% funding by the National Health Service to almost 100% funding by charities, but the service is always free to patients.  

As of 2006 about 4% of all deaths in England and Wales occurred in a hospice setting (about 20,000 patients);<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmpubacc/99/9905.htm End of life care: 1.
