'''Dental caries''', also known as '''tooth decay''' or a '''cavity''', is an [[infection]], [[bacterial]] in origin, that causes demineralization and destruction of the hard tissues ([[Tooth enamel|enamel]], [[dentin]] and [[cementum]]), usually by production of acid by bacterial [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of the food debris accumulated on the tooth surface.<ref name="medline">{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001055|Dental Cavities}}</ref> If [[Remineralisation of teeth|demineralization]] exceeds [[saliva]] and other remineralization factors such as from [[calcium]] and [[Fluoride|fluoridated]] [[toothpastes]], these hard tissues progressively break down, producing dental caries (cavities, holes in the teeth). The bacteria most responsible for dental cavities are the mutans streptococci, most prominently ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus sobrinus]]'', and [[Lactobacillus|lactobacilli]]. If left untreated, the [[disease]] can lead to pain, [[tooth loss]] and [[infection]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cavities/DS00896/DSECTION=7 Cavities/tooth decay], hosted on the Mayo Clinic website. Page accessed May 25, 2008.</ref> Today, caries remain one of the most common diseases throughout the world. Cariology is the study of dental caries.

The presentation of caries is highly variable.  However the risk factors and stages of development are similar.  Initially it may appear as a small chalky area (smooth surface caries), which may eventually develop into a large cavitation.  Sometimes caries may be directly visible.  However other methods of detection such as [[radiography|X-rays]] are used for less visible areas of teeth and to judge the extent of destruction. Lasers for detecting caries allow detection without ionizing radiation and are now used for detection of interproximal decay (between the teeth). Disclosing solutions are also used during tooth restoration to minimize the chance of recurrence.

Tooth decay disease is caused by specific types of bacteria that produce [[acid]] in the presence of [[fermentation (food)|fermentable]] [[carbohydrate]]s such as [[sucrose]], [[fructose]], and [[glucose]].<ref name="Hardie1982">{{cite journal |author=Hardie JM |title=The microbiology of dental caries |journal=Dent Update |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=199–200, 202–4, 206–8 |year=1982 |month=May |pmid=6959931 }}</ref><ref name="holloway1983">{{cite journal |author=Holloway PJ |title=The role of sugar in the etiology of dental caries |journal=J Dent |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=189–213 |year=1983 |month=September |doi=10.1016/0300-5712(83)90182-3 |last2=Moore |first2=W.J. |pmid=6358295}}

To be specific, a tooth (which is primarily mineral in content) is in a constant state of back-and-forth demineralization and [[remineralisation of teeth|remineralization]] between the tooth and surrounding [[saliva]].  For people with little saliva, especially due to radiation therapies that may destroy the [[salivary gland]]s, there also exists remineralization gel. These patients are particularly susceptible to dental caries. When the pH at the surface of the tooth drops below 5.5, demineralization proceeds faster than remineralization (meaning that there is a net loss of mineral structure on the tooth's surface).  Most foods are in this acidic range and without remineralization, this results in the ensuing decay.  Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to [[dental restoration|restore]] teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] large amounts of tooth structure.  Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventive and prophylactic measures, such as regular [[oral hygiene]] and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.<ref name="adaoralhealth">[http://www.ada.org/public/topics/cleaning.asp Oral Health Topics: Cleaning your teeth and gums].

A person experiencing caries may not be aware of the disease.<ref>[http://www.hpb.gov.sg/hpb/default.asp?pg_id=865&aid=198 Health Promotion Board: Dental Caries], affiliated with the Singapore government. Page accessed August 14, 2006.</ref>  The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is the appearance of a chalky white spot on the surface of the tooth, indicating an area of demineralization of enamel. This is referred to as an incipient carious lesion or "microcavity".<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title=A Closer Look at Teeth May Mean More Fillings|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/health/a-closer-look-at-teeth-may-mean-more-fillings-by-dentists.html|accessdate=November 30, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 28, 2011|author=Richie S. King|quote=An incipient carious lesion is the initial stage of structural damage to the enamel, usually caused by a bacterial infection that produces tooth-dissolving acid.}}</ref>   As the lesion continues to demineralize, it can turn brown but will eventually turn into a cavitation ("cavity").  Before the cavity forms the process is reversible, but once a cavity forms the lost tooth structure cannot be [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerated]].  A lesion that appears brown and shiny suggests dental caries was once present but the demineralization process has stopped, leaving a stain.  A brown spot that is dull in appearance is probably a sign of active caries.<ref>Johnson, Clarke. "[http://www.uic.edu/classes/orla/orla312/BHDTwo.html Biology of the Human Dentition]." Page accessed July 18, 2007.</ref>

As the enamel and dentin are destroyed, the cavity becomes more noticeable.  The affected areas of the tooth change color and become soft to the touch.  Once the decay passes through enamel, the dentinal tubules, which have passages to the nerve of the tooth, become exposed, resulting in a [[toothache]].  The pain may worsen with exposure to heat, cold, or sweet foods and drinks.<ref name="medline"/>  Dental caries can also cause [[halitosis|bad breath]] and foul tastes.<ref>[http://www.med.nyu.edu/patientcare/patients/library/article.html?ChunkIID=11496 Tooth Decay], hosted on the New York University Medical Center website. Page accessed August 14, 2006.</ref> In highly progressed cases, infection can spread from the tooth to the surrounding [[soft tissue]]s.

==Causes==
There are four main criteria required for caries formation: a tooth surface ([[tooth enamel|enamel]] or dentin); caries-causing bacteria; fermentable [[carbohydrate]]s (such as [[sucrose]]); and time.<ref>{{cite book |author=Southam JC, Soames JV |chapter=2. Dental Caries |title=Oral pathology |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press |location=Oxford |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-262214-5 |edition=2nd}}</ref>  The caries process does not have an inevitable outcome, and different individuals will be susceptible to different degrees depending on the shape of their teeth, oral hygiene habits, and the buffering capacity of their saliva.  Dental caries can occur on any surface of a tooth that is exposed to the oral cavity, but not the structures that are retained within the bone.<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith B, Pickard HM, Kidd EAM |chapter=1. Why restore teeth?|title=Pickard's manual of operative dentistry |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-19-261808-3 |edition=6th}}</ref>
All caries occur from acid demineralization that exceeds saliva and fluoride remineralization, and almost all acid demineralization occurs where food (containing carbohydrate like sugar) is left on teeth. Because most trapped food is left between teeth, over 80% of cavities occur inside pits and fissures on chewing surfaces where brushing, fluoride, and saliva cannot reach to remineralize the tooth as they do on easy-to-reach surfaces that develop few cavities.

=== Teeth ===
There are certain diseases and disorders affecting teeth that may leave an individual at a greater risk for caries.  [[Amelogenesis imperfecta]], which occurs between 1 in 718 and 1 in 14,000 individuals, is a disease in which the enamel does not fully form or forms in insufficient amounts and can fall off a tooth.<ref name="neville89">Neville, B.W., Douglas Damm, Carl Allen, Jerry Bouquot. "''Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology.''" 2nd edition, 2002, p. 89. ISBN 0-7216-9003-3.</ref> In both cases, teeth may be left more vulnerable to decay because the enamel is not able to protect the tooth.<ref name="neville94">Neville, B.W., Douglas Damm, Carl Allen, Jerry Bouquot. "''Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology.''" 2nd edition, 2002, p. 94. ISBN 0-7216-9003-3.</ref>

In most people, disorders or diseases affecting teeth are not the primary cause of dental caries.  Ninety-six percent of tooth enamel is composed of minerals.<ref>Cate, A.R. Ten. "''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''"  5th edition, 1998, p. 1.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref>  These minerals, especially [[hydroxyapatite]], will become soluble when exposed to acidic environments.  Enamel begins to demineralize at a pH of 5.5.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dawes C |title=What is the critical pH and why does a tooth dissolve in acid? |journal=J Can Dent Assoc |volume=69 |issue=11 |pages=722–4 |year=2003 |month=December |pmid=14653937 |url=http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-69/issue-11/722.html}}</ref>  [[Dentin]] and [[cementum]] are more susceptible to caries than [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] because they have lower mineral content.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mellberg JR |title=Demineralization and remineralization of root surface caries |journal=Gerodontology |volume=5 |issue= 1|pages=25–31 |year=1986 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-2358.1986.tb00380.x |pmid=3549537}}</ref>  Thus, when root surfaces of teeth are exposed from gingival recession or periodontal disease, caries can develop more readily.  Even in a healthy oral environment, however, the tooth is susceptible to dental caries.

The evidence for linking malocclusion and/or crowding to the dental caries is weak;<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/00016357.2010.516732 |author=Borzabadi-Farahani, A; Eslamipour, F; Asgari, I
 |title=Association between orthodontic treatment need and caries experience |journal=Acta Odontol Scand |volume=69 |pages=2–11 |year=2011 |pmid=20923258|issue=1 }}</ref> however,the anatomy of teeth may affect the likelihood of caries formation.  Where the deep grooves of teeth are more numerous and exaggerated, pit and fissure caries are more likely to develop.  Also, caries are more likely to develop when food is trapped between teeth.

[[File:Streptococcus mutans 01.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|A gram stain image of ''Streptococcus mutans''.]]

=== Bacteria ===
The mouth contains a wide variety of [[oral ecology|oral bacteria]], but only a few specific species of bacteria are believed to cause dental caries: ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus|Lactobacilli]]'' among them.<ref name="Hardie1982"/><ref name=AnthonyHRogers/>  ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'', ''[[Actinomyces viscosus]]'', ''[[Nocardia spp.]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' are most closely associated with caries, in particular root caries.  Bacteria collect around the teeth and gums in a sticky, creamy-coloured mass called [[dental plaque|plaque]], which serves as a [[biofilm]].  Some sites collect plaque more commonly than others, for example sites with a low rate of salivary flow (molar fissures).  Grooves on the [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] surfaces of [[molar (tooth)|molar]] and [[premolar]] teeth provide microscopic retention sites for plaque bacteria, as do the [[Approximal (dentistry)|approximal]] sites. Plaque may also collect above or below the [[gingiva]] where it is referred to as supra- or sub-gingival plaque respectively.

These bacterial strains, most notably ''S. mutans'' can be inherited by a child from a caretakers [[kiss]] or through feeding [[premastication|premasticated food]].<ref>{{citation |journal=Pediatric Dentistry |year=2008 |month=Sep-Oct |volume=30 |number=5 |pages=375–87 |title=Association of mutans streptococci between caregivers and their children. |last=Douglass |first=JM |last2=Li |first2=Y |last3=Tinanoff |first3=N.}}</ref>

=== Fermentable carbohydrates ===
Bacteria in a person's mouth convert [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and most commonly [[sucrose]] (table sugar) into acids such as [[lactic acid]] through a [[glycolytic]] process called [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]].<ref name="holloway1983"/> If left in contact with the tooth, these acids may cause demineralization, which is the dissolution of its mineral content.  The process is dynamic, however, as remineralization can also occur if the acid is [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] by saliva or mouthwash.  Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish may aid remineralization.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silverstone LM |title=Remineralization and enamel caries: new concepts |journal=Dent Update |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=261–73 |year=1983 |month=May |pmid=6578983 }}</ref>  If demineralization continues over time, enough mineral content may be lost so that the soft [[organic compound|organic]] material left behind disintegrates, forming a cavity or hole. The impact such sugars have on the progress of dental caries is called cariogenicity. Sucrose, although a bound glucose and fructose unit, is in fact more cariogenic than a mixture of equal parts of glucose and fructose. This is due to the bacteria utilising the energy in the saccharide bond between the glucose and fructose subunits. ''S.mutans'' adheres to the biofilm on the tooth by converting sucrose into an extremely adhesive substance called [[dextran]] polysaccharide by the enzyme dextransucranase.<ref>Madigan M.T. & Martinko J.M. Brock - ''Biology of Microorganisms.'' 11th Ed. Pearson, USA. pp. 705</ref>

=== Time ===
The frequency of which teeth are exposed to cariogenic (acidic) environments affects the likelihood of caries development.<ref name="bnf">[http://www.nutrition.org.uk/home.asp?siteId=43&sectionId=649&parentSection=321&which=undefined "Dental Health"], hosted on the British Nutrition Foundation website, 2004. Page accessed August 13, 2006.</ref>  After meals or [[snack food|snack]]s, the bacteria in the mouth metabolize sugar, resulting in an acidic by-product that decreases pH.  As time progresses, the pH returns to normal due to the buffering capacity of [[saliva]] and the dissolved mineral content of tooth surfaces.  During every exposure to the acidic environment, portions of the inorganic mineral content at the surface of teeth dissolves and can remain dissolved for two hours.<ref>[http://www.dent.ucla.edu/ce/caries/ Dental Caries], hosted on the University of California Los Angeles School of Dentistry website. Page accessed August 14, 2006.</ref>  Since teeth are vulnerable during these acidic periods, the development of dental caries relies heavily on the frequency of acid exposure.

The carious process can begin within days of a tooth's erupting into the mouth if the diet is sufficiently rich in suitable carbohydrates. Evidence suggests that the introduction of fluoride treatments have slowed the process.<ref name="summit75">Summit, James B., J. William Robbins, and Richard S. Schwartz. "Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry: A Contemporary Approach." 2nd edition. Carol Stream, Illinois, Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc, 2001, p. 75. ISBN 0-86715-382-2.</ref>  Proximal caries take an average of four years to pass through enamel in permanent teeth.  Because the [[cementum]] enveloping the root surface is not nearly as durable as the enamel encasing the crown, root caries tends to progress much more rapidly than decay on other surfaces.  The progression and loss of mineralization on the root surface is 2.5 times faster than caries in enamel.  In very severe cases where oral hygiene is very poor and where the diet is very rich in fermentable carbohydrates, caries may cause cavities within months of tooth eruption. This can occur, for example, when children continuously drink sugary drinks from baby bottles.

=== Other risk factors ===
Reduced saliva is associated with increased caries since the buffering capability of saliva is not present to counterbalance the acidic environment created by certain foods. As a result, medical conditions that reduce the amount of saliva produced by [[salivary gland]]s, in particular the [[submandibular gland]] and [[parotid gland]], are likely to lead to widespread tooth decay. Examples include [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[diabetes insipidus]], and [[sarcoidosis]].<ref name="neville398">Neville, B.W., Douglas Damm, Carl Allen, Jerry Bouquot. "''Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology.''" 2nd edition, 2002, p. 398. ISBN 0-7216-9003-3.</ref> Medications, such as antihistamines and antidepressants, can also impair salivary flow. Stimulants, most notoriously [[methylamphetamine]], also occlude the flow of saliva to an extreme degree. [[Tetrahydrocannabinol]], the active chemical substance in [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], also causes a nearly complete occlusion of salivation, known in colloquial terms as "cotton mouth". Moreover, sixty-three percent of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States list [[xerostomia|dry mouth]] as a known side-effect.<ref name="neville398"/> Radiation therapy of the head and neck may also damage the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in salivary glands, increasing the likelihood of caries formation.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/supportivecare/oralcomplications/Patient/page5 Oral Complications of Chemotherapy and Head/Neck Radiation], hosted on the [http://www.cancer.gov/ National Cancer Institute] website. Page accessed January 8, 2007.</ref>

The use of [[tobacco]] may also increase the risk for caries formation. Some brands of [[Dipping tobacco|smokeless tobacco]] contain high sugar content, increasing susceptibility to caries.<ref name="neville347">Neville, B.W., Douglas Damm, Carl Allen, Jerry Bouquot. "''Oral & Maxillofacial Pathology.''" 2nd edition, 2002, p. 347.

Page accessed January 9, 2007.</ref>  As the gingiva loses attachment to the teeth, the root surface becomes more visible in the mouth.  If this occurs, root caries is a concern since the cementum covering the roots of teeth is more easily demineralized by acids than enamel.<ref name="banting19">Banting, D.W.

===Enamel===
Enamel is a highly mineralized acellular [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], and caries act upon it through a chemical process brought on by the acidic environment produced by bacteria.  As the bacteria consume the sugar and use it for their own energy, they produce lactic acid.  The effects of this process include the demineralization of crystals in the enamel, caused by acids, over time until the bacteria physically penetrate the dentin.  [[Enamel rod]]s, which are the basic unit of the enamel structure, run perpendicularly from the surface of the tooth to the dentin.  Since demineralization of enamel by caries, in general, follows the direction of the enamel rods, the different triangular patterns between pit and fissure and smooth-surface caries develop in the enamel because the orientation of enamel rods are different in the two areas of the tooth.<ref name="kidd">{{cite journal |author=Kidd EA, Fejerskov O |title=What constitutes dental caries?

As the enamel loses minerals, <!--- Is this an acceptable way to put it? ---> and dental caries progresses, the enamel develop several distinct zones, visible under a light microscope.  From the deepest layer of the enamel to the enamel surface, the identified areas are the: translucent zone, dark zones, body of the lesion, and surface zone.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/00220345630420015601 |author=Darling AI |title=Resistance of the Enamel to Dental Caries |journal=J Dent Res. |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=488–96 |year=1963 |url=http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/42/1/488.pdf |pmid=14041429}}</ref>  The translucent zone is the first visible sign of caries and coincides with a one to two percent loss of minerals.<ref name="robinson">{{cite journal |author=Robinson C, Shore RC, Brookes SJ, Strafford S, Wood SR, Kirkham J |title=The chemistry of enamel caries |journal=Crit Rev Oral Biol Med. |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=481–95 |year=2000 |pmid=11132767 |url=http://crobm.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/11/4/481.pdf |doi=10.1177/10454411000110040601}}</ref> A slight remineralization of enamel occurs in the dark zone, which serves as an example of how  the development of dental caries is an active process with alternating changes.<ref name="cate417">Cate, A.R.

ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref>  The area of greatest demineralization and destruction is in the body of the lesion itself.  The surface zone remains relatively mineralized and is present until the loss of tooth structure results in a cavitation.

===Dentin===
Unlike enamel, the dentin reacts to the progression of dental caries. <!--- It was unclear in the preceding section that enamel '*does not* react to the progression of caries ---> After [[tooth development|tooth formation]], the [[ameloblast]]s, which produce enamel, are destroyed once [[amelogenesis|enamel formation]] is complete and thus cannot later regenerate enamel after its destruction.  On the other hand, dentin is [[dentinogenesis|produced]] continuously throughout life by [[odontoblast]]s, which reside at the border between the pulp and dentin.  Since odontoblasts are present, a stimulus, such as caries, can trigger a biologic response.  These defense mechanisms include the formation of sclerotic and tertiary dentin.<ref>"[http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/PTHL312abc/312b/09/Reader/reader_set.html Teeth & Jaws: Caries, Pulp, & Periapical Conditions]," hosted on the [http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/ University of Southern California School of Dentistry] website. Page accessed June 22, 2007.</ref>

In dentin from the deepest layer to the enamel, the distinct areas affected by caries are the advancing front, the zone of bacterial penetration, and the zone of destruction.<ref name="kidd"/>  The advancing front represents a zone of demineralised dentine due to acid and has no bacteria present.  The zones of bacterial penetration and destruction are the locations of invading bacteria and ultimately the decomposition of dentin. The zone of destruction has a more mixed bacterial population where proteolytic enzymes have destroyed the organic matrix. The innermost dentine caries has been reversibly attacked because the collage matrix is not severely damaged, giving it potential for repair. The outer more superficial zone is highly infected with proteolytic degradation of the collagen matrix and as a result the dentine is irreversibly demineralised.

[[File:Smooth Surface Caries GIF.gif|thumb|left|alt=Animated image showing the shape progression of a caries lesion in the cervical region of a tooth.|The faster spread of caries through dentin creates this triangular appearance in smooth surface caries.]]

==== Sclerotic dentin ====
The structure of dentin is an arrangement of microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward  from the pulp chamber to the exterior cementum or enamel border.<ref name="ross450">Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina, 2003. ''Histology: a text and atlas.'' 4th edition, p. 450.  ISBN 0-683-30242-6.</ref>  The diameter of the dentinal tubules is largest near the pulp (about 2.5&nbsp;μm) and smallest (about 900&nbsp;nm) at the junction of dentin and enamel.<ref name="cate152">Cate, A.R. Ten. "''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''"  5th edition, 1998, p. 152.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref>  The carious process continues through the dentinal tubules, which are responsible for the triangular patterns resulting from the progression of caries deep into the tooth.  The tubules also allow caries to progress faster.

In response, the fluid inside the tubules bring [[immunoglobulin]]s from the [[immune system]] to fight the bacterial infection.  At the same time, there is an increase of mineralization of the surrounding tubules.<ref name="summit13">Summit, James B., J. William Robbins, and Richard S. Schwartz. "Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry: A Contemporary Approach." 2nd edition. Carol Stream, Illinois, Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc, 2001, p. 13. ISBN 0-86715-382-2.</ref>  This results in a constriction of the tubules, which is an attempt to slow the bacterial progression.  In addition, as the acid from the bacteria demineralizes the hydroxyapatite crystals, [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]] are released, allowing for the precipitation of more crystals which fall deeper into the dentinal tubule.  These crystals form a barrier and slow the advancement of caries.  After these protective responses, the dentin is considered sclerotic.

Fluids within dentinal tubules are believed to be the mechanism by which pain receptors are triggered within the pulp of the tooth.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dababneh RH, Khouri AT, Addy M |title=Dentine hypersensitivity - an enigma? A review of terminology, mechanisms, aetiology and management |journal=Br Dent J |volume=187 |issue=11 |pages=606–11; discussion 603 |year=1999 |month=December |pmid=16163281 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4800345a |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v187/n11/full/4800345a.html}}<br/>The referred to theory is the widely accepted hydrodynamic theory of sensitivity.</ref>  Since sclerotic dentin prevents the passage of such fluids, pain that would otherwise serve as a warning of the invading bacteria may not develop at first.  Consequently, dental caries may progress for a long period of time without any sensitivity of the tooth, allowing for greater loss of tooth structure.

==== Tertiary dentin ====
In response to dental caries, there may be production of more dentin toward the direction of the pulp.  This new dentin is referred to as tertiary dentin.<ref name="cate152"/>  Tertiary dentin is produced to protect the pulp for as long as possible from the advancing bacteria.  As more tertiary dentin is produced, the size of the pulp decreases.  This type of dentin has been subdivided according to the presence or absence of the original odontoblasts.<ref name="transdentinal">{{cite journal |author=Smith AJ, Murray PE, Sloan AJ, ''et al.'' |title=Trans-dentinal Stimulation of Tertiary Dentinogenesis |journal=Advances in Dental Research |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=51–4 |month=August |year=2001 |url=http://adr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/15/1/51.pdf |doi=10.1177/08959374010150011301 |pmid=12640740}}</ref>  If the odontoblasts survive long enough to react to the dental caries, then the dentin produced is called "reactionary" dentin.  If the odontoblasts are killed, the dentin produced is called "reparative" dentin.

In the case of reparative dentin, other cells are needed to assume the role of the destroyed odontoblasts.  [[Growth factor]]s, especially [[TGF beta|TGF-β]],<ref name="transdentinal"/> are thought to initiate the production of reparative dentin by [[fibroblast]]s and [[Mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal]] cells of the pulp.<ref name="summit14">Summit, James B., J. William Robbins, and Richard S. Schwartz. "Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry: A Contemporary Approach." 2nd edition. Carol Stream, Illinois, Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc, 2001, p. 14. ISBN 0-86715-382-2.</ref>  Reparative dentin is produced at an average of 1.5&nbsp;μm/day, but can be increased to 3.5&nbsp;μm/day.  The resulting dentin contains irregularly shaped dentinal tubules that may not line up with existing dentinal tubules.  This diminishes the ability for dental caries to progress within the dentinal tubules.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Dental explorer.png|100px|thumb|alt=Curved tip of a small metal probe, tapering to a point.|The tip of a [[dental explorer]], which is used for caries diagnosis.]]
Primary [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] involves inspection of all visible tooth surfaces using a good light source, [[Mouth mirror|dental mirror]] and [[explorer (dental)|explorer]].  Dental [[radiographs]] ([[X-ray]]s) may show dental caries before it is otherwise visible, in particular caries between the teeth.  Large dental caries are often apparent to the naked eye, but smaller lesions can be difficult to identify. Visual and [[Tactition|tactile]] inspection along with radiographs are employed frequently among dentists, in particular to diagnose pit and fissure caries.<ref>Rosenstiel, Stephen F. [http://www.lib.umich.edu/dentlib/nihcdc/abstracts/rosenstiel.html Clinical Diagnosis of Dental Caries: A North American Perspective]. Maintained by the University of Michigan Dentistry Library, along with the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. 2000. Page accessed August 13, 2006.</ref>  Early, uncavitated caries is often diagnosed by blowing air across the suspect surface, which removes moisture and changes the optical properties of the unmineralized enamel.

Some dental researchers have cautioned against the use of dental explorers to find caries.<ref name=summit31>Summit, James B., J. William Robbins, and Richard S. Schwartz. "Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry: A Contemporary Approach." 2nd edition. Carol Stream, Illinois, Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc, 2001, p. 31. ISBN 0-86715-382-2.</ref>  In cases where a small area of tooth has begun demineralizing but has not yet cavitated, the pressure from the dental explorer could cause a cavity.  Since the carious process is reversible before a cavity is present, it may be possible to arrest the caries with [[Fluoride therapy|fluoride]] and remineralize the tooth surface.  When a cavity is present, a restoration will be needed to replace the lost tooth structure.

At times, pit and fissure caries may be difficult to detect. Bacteria can penetrate the enamel to reach dentin, but then the outer surface may remineralize, especially if fluoride is present.<ref name="HC">{{cite journal |author=Zadik Yehuda, Bechor Ron |title=Hidden Occlusal Caries - Challenge for the Dentist |journal=New York State Dental Journal |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=46–50 |year=2008 |month=June/July  |url=http://www.nysdental.org/img/current-pdf/JrnlJuneJuly2008.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-08 |pmid=18788181}}</ref> These caries, sometimes referred to as "hidden caries", will still be visible on x-ray radiographs, but visual examination of the tooth would show the enamel intact or minimally perforated.

The [[differential diagnosis]] for dental caries includes [[dental fluorosis]] and developmental defects of the tooth including hypomineralization of the tooth and [[hypoplasia]] of the tooth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baelum|first=edited by Ole Fejerskov and Edwina Kidd ; with Bente Nyvad and Vibeke|title=Dental caries : the disease and its clinical management|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Munksgaard|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-3889-5|pages=67|edition=2nd ed.}}</ref>

=== Classification ===
[[File:GV-BLACK.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Chart showing digitally drawn images of caries locations and their associated classifications.| [[Greene Vardiman Black|G.V. Black]] Classification of Restorations]] 
Caries can be classified by location, etiology, rate of progression, and affected hard tissues.<ref name="sonis139">{{cite book|author=Sonis, Stephen T. |title=Dental Secrets |location=Philadelphia |year=2003 |pages=130 |isbn=1-56053-573-3 |edition=3rd|unused_data=pub isher=Hanley & Belfus}}</ref> These forms of classification can be used to characterize a particular case of tooth decay in order to more accurately represent the condition to others and also indicate the severity of tooth destruction.

==== By etiology ====
[[File:Suspectedmethmouth09-19-05closeup.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of teeth and gums on the lower right hand side of the mouth showing large caries lesions on all teeth at the level of the gum|Rampant caries.]]
In some instances, caries are described in other ways that might indicate the cause.  "[[Early childhood caries|Baby bottle caries]]," "early childhood caries," "[[baby bottle]] tooth decay," or "Bottle Rot" is a pattern of decay found in young children with their [[deciduous teeth|deciduous]] (baby) teeth.  The teeth most likely affected are the maxillary anterior teeth, but all teeth can be affected.<ref>[http://www.ada.org/public/topics/decay_childhood_faq.asp ADA Early Childhood Tooth Decay (Baby Bottle Tooth Decay)]. Hosted on the American Dental Association website.  Page accessed August 14, 2006.</ref>  The name for this type of caries comes from the fact that the decay usually is a result of allowing children to fall asleep with sweetened liquids in their bottles or feeding children sweetened liquids multiple times during the day.  Another pattern of decay is "rampant caries", which signifies advanced or severe decay on multiple surfaces of many teeth.<ref>[http://www.dent.ohio-state.edu/radiologycarie/classification.htm Radiographic Classification of Caries].  Hosted on the Ohio State University website.  Page accessed August 14, 2006.</ref>  Rampant caries may be seen in individuals with [[xerostomia]], poor oral hygiene, stimulant use (due to drug-induced dry mouth<ref>[http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/topics/methmouth.asp ADA Methamphetamine Use (METH MOUTH)]. Hosted on the American Dental Association website. Page accessed February 14, 2007.</ref>), and/or large sugar intake.  If rampant caries is a result of previous radiation to the head and neck, it may be described as radiation-induced caries.   Problems can also be caused by the self-destruction of roots and whole [[root resorption|tooth resorption]] when new teeth erupt or later from unknown causes.
Dr. Miller stated in 1887 that "Dental decay is chemico-parasitic process consisting of two stages, the decalcification of enamel, which results in its total destruction and the decalcification of dentin as a preliminary stage followed by dissolution of the softened residue." In his hypothesis, Dr.Miller assigned essential roles to three factors:
# Carbohydrate substrate
# Acid that caused dissolution of tooth minerals
# Oral micro-organisms that produce acid and also cause proteolysis.

==== Rate of progression ====
Temporal descriptions can be applied to caries to indicate the progression rate and previous history.  "Acute" signifies a quickly developing condition, whereas "chronic" describes a condition that has taken an extended time to develop, in which thousands of meals and snacks, many causing some acid demineralization that is not remineralized, eventually results in cavities. [[Fluoride therapy|Fluoride treatment]] can help recalcification of tooth enamel.

Recurrent caries, also described as secondary, are caries that appears at a location with a previous history of caries.  This is frequently found on the margins of fillings and other dental restorations.   On the other hand, incipient caries describes decay at a location that has not experienced previous decay.  Arrested caries describes a lesion on a tooth that was previously demineralized but was remineralized before causing a cavitation. Using fluoride treatments can help with recalcification.

==== Affected hard tissue ====
Depending on which hard tissues are affected, it is possible to describe caries as involving enamel, dentin, or cementum.  Early in its development, caries may affect only enamel.  Once the extent of decay reaches the deeper layer of dentin, "dentinal caries" is used.  Since cementum is the hard tissue that covers the roots of teeth, it is not often affected by decay unless the roots of teeth are exposed to the mouth.  Although the term "cementum caries" may be used to describe the decay on roots of teeth, very rarely does caries affect the cementum alone.  Roots have a very thin layer of cementum over a large layer of dentin, and thus most caries affecting cementum also affects dentin.

==Prevention==
[[File:Toothbrush 20050716 004.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Head of a toothbrush|[[Toothbrush]]es are commonly used to clean teeth.]]

=== Oral hygiene ===
Personal hygiene care consists of proper brushing  and [[Dental floss|flossing]] daily.<ref name="adaoralhealth"/>  The purpose of oral hygiene is to minimize any etiologic agents of disease in the mouth.  The primary focus of brushing and flossing is to remove and prevent the formation of [[Dental plaque|plaque]].  Plaque consists mostly of bacteria.<ref>[http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html Introduction to Dental Plaque]. Hosted on the Leeds Dental Institute Website. Page accessed August 14, 2006.</ref>  As the amount of bacterial plaque increases, the tooth is more vulnerable to dental caries when carbohydrates in the food are left on teeth after every meal or snack.  A toothbrush can be used to remove plaque on accessible surfaces, but not between teeth or inside pits and fissures on chewing surfaces.  When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from areas that could otherwise develop proximal caries. Other adjunct hygiene aids include [[interdental brush]]es, [[water pick]]s, and [[mouthwash]]es.

However oral hygiene is probably more effective at preventing gum disease than tooth decay. Food is forced inside pits and fissures under chewing pressure, leading to carbohydrate-fueled acid demineralisation where the brush, fluoride toothpaste, and saliva have no access to remove trapped food, neutralise acid, or remineralise demineralised tooth like on other more accessible tooth surfaces food to be trapped. (Occlusal caries accounts for between 80 and 90 percent of caries in children (Weintraub, 2001).) Chewing fibre like celery after eating forces saliva inside trapped food to dilute any carbohydrate like sugar, neutralise acid and remineralise demineralised tooth. (The teeth at highest risk for carious lesions are the first and second permanent molars.)

Professional hygiene care consists of regular dental examinations and cleanings.  Sometimes, complete plaque removal is difficult, and a dentist or [[dental hygienist]] may be needed.  Along with oral hygiene, radio-graphs may be taken at dental visits to detect possible dental caries development in high risk areas of the mouth.

=== Dietary modification ===
For dental health, frequency of sugar intake is more important than the amount of sugar consumed.<ref name="bnf"/>  In the presence of sugar and other carbohydrates, bacteria in the mouth produce acids that can demineralize enamel, dentin, and cementum.  The more frequently teeth are exposed to this environment the more likely dental caries are to occur.  Therefore, minimizing snacking is recommended, since snacking creates a continuous supply of nutrition for acid-creating bacteria in the mouth.  Also, chewy and sticky foods (such as dried fruit or candy) tend to adhere to teeth longer, and, as a consequence, are best eaten as part of a meal. Brushing the teeth after meals is recommended. For children, the [[American Dental Association]] and the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry recommend limiting the frequency of consumption of drinks with sugar, and not giving baby bottles to infants during sleep.<ref>[http://www.eapd.gr/Parents/Pregnant%20mother%20all.htm A Guide to Oral Health to Prospective Mothers and their Infants], hosted on the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry website.  Page accessed August 14, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.ada.org/public/topics/decay_childhood_faq.asp Oral Health Topics: Baby Bottle Tooth Decay], hosted on the American Dental Association website.  Page accessed August 14, 2006.</ref>  Mothers are also recommended to avoid sharing utensils and cups with their infants to prevent transferring bacteria from the mother's mouth.<ref>[http://www.aapd.org/media/Policies_Guidelines/G_InfantOralHealthCare.pdf Guideline on Infant Oral Health Care], hosted on the [http://www.aapd.org American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry] website. Page accessed January 13, 2007.</ref>

It has been found that [[milk]] and certain kinds of cheese like [[cheddar cheese]] can help counter tooth decay if eaten soon after the consumption of foods potentially harmful to teeth.<ref name="bnf"/>  Also, [[chewing gum]] containing [[xylitol]] (a sugar alcohol) is widely used to protect teeth in some countries, being especially popular in the [[Finland|Finnish]] candy industry.<ref>[http://www.xylitol.net/eng/index.php?action=item-view&item-action=view&item-hash=088f5f675b05714db3f50065561e8692 "History"], hosted on the Xylitol.net website.

[[File:FluorideTrays07-05-05.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Common dentistry trays used to deliver fluoride.]]

=== Other measures ===
The use of [[dental sealant]]s is a means of prevention. A sealant is a thin plastic-like coating applied to the chewing surfaces of the molars to prevent food from being trapped inside pits and fissures.  This deprives resident plaque bacteria carbohydrate preventing the formation of pit and fissure caries. Sealants are usually applied on the teeth of children, shortly after the molars erupt. Sealants can wear out and fail to prevent access of food and plaque bacteria inside pits and fissures and need to be replaced. 

Calcium, as found in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often recommended to protect against dental caries. It has been demonstrated that [[calcium]] and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries.  Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel.<ref>Cate, A.R. Ten. "''Oral Histology: development, structure, and function.''"  5th edition, 1998, p. 223.  ISBN 0-8151-2952-1.</ref> The incorporated calcium makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay.<ref>Ross, Michael H., Gordon I. Kaye, and Wojciech Pawlina, 2003. "''Histology: a text and atlas.''" 4th edition, p. 453. ISBN 0-683-30242-6.</ref>  Topical fluoride is also recommended to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride [[toothpaste]] or mouthwash. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits.

[[Caries vaccine|Vaccines]] are also under development.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=MW|coauthors=Childers, NK, Michalek, SM, Smith, DJ, Taubman, MA|title=A Caries Vaccine? The state of the science of immunization against dental caries.|journal=Caries research|date=2004 May-Jun|volume=38|issue=3|pages=230–5|pmid=15153693|doi=10.1159/000077759}}</ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:Amalgam.jpg|right|thumb|alt=An extracted tooth displaying an amalgam metal restoration on the occlusal surface|An amalgam used as a restorative material in a tooth.]]
{{See also|Dental restoration|Tooth extraction}}
Destroyed tooth structure does not fully regenerate, although remineralization of very small carious lesions may occur if dental hygiene is kept at optimal level.<ref name="medline"/>  For the small lesions, topical fluoride is sometimes used to encourage remineralization.  For larger lesions, the progression of dental caries can be stopped by treatment. The goal of treatment is to preserve tooth structures and prevent further destruction of the tooth. Aggressive treatment, by filling, of incipient carious lesions, places where there is superficial damage to the enamel, is controversial as they may heal themselves, while once a filling is performed it will eventually have to be redone and the site serves as a vulnerable site for further decay.<ref name ="NYT" />

In general, early treatment is less painful and less expensive than treatment of extensive decay. [[Anesthetic]]s—local, [[nitrous oxide]] ("laughing gas"), or other prescription medications—may be required in some cases to relieve pain during or following treatment or to relieve anxiety during treatment.<ref>[http://www.ada.org/public/topics/anesthesia_faq.asp Oral Health Topics: Anesthesia Frequently Asked Questions], hosted on the American Dental Association website. Page accessed August 16, 2006.</ref> A [[dental drill|dental handpiece]] ("drill") is used to remove large portions of decayed material from a tooth.  A spoon, a dental instrument used to carefully remove decay, is sometimes employed when the decay in [[dentin]] reaches near the [[pulp (tooth)|pulp]].<ref name="summit128">Summit, James B., J. William Robbins, and Richard S. Schwartz. "Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry: A Contemporary Approach." 2nd edition. Carol Stream, Illinois, Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc, 2001, p. 128. ISBN 0-86715-382-2.</ref>  Once the decay is removed, the missing tooth structure requires a [[dental restoration]] of some sort to return the tooth to functionality and aesthetic condition.

Restorative materials include dental [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[Dental composite|composite]] [[resin]], [[dental porcelain|porcelain]], and [[gold (element)|gold]].<ref name="DCPPtx">"[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dcp2.section.5402 Aspects of Treatment of Cavities and of Caries Disease]" from the Disease Control Priorities Project. Page accessed August 15, 2006.</ref> Composite resin and porcelain can be made to match the color of a patient's natural teeth and are thus used more frequently when aesthetics are a concern.  Composite restorations are not as strong as dental amalgam and gold; some dentists consider the latter as the only advisable restoration for posterior areas where chewing forces are great.<ref>[http://www.ada.org/public/topics/fillings.asp Oral Health Topics: Dental Filling Options], hosted on the American Dental Association website. Page accessed August 16, 2006.</ref>  When the decay is too extensive, there may not be enough tooth structure remaining to allow a restorative material to be placed within the tooth.  Thus, a [[Crown (dentistry)|crown]] may be needed.  This restoration appears similar to a cap and is fitted over the remainder of the natural crown of the tooth. Crowns are often made of gold, porcelain, or porcelain fused to metal.

[[File:Toothdecay (1).jpg|left|thumb|alt=Two pictures showing a tooth with a large caries lesion, and the socket left once the tooth had been extracted|A tooth with extensive caries eventually requiring extraction.]]

In certain cases, [[endodontic therapy]] may be necessary for the restoration of a tooth.<ref>[http://www.agd.org/consumer/topics/rootcanaltherapy/main.asp What is a Root Canal?], hosted by the Academy of General Dentistry.  Page accessed August 16, 2006.</ref>  Endodontic therapy, also known as a "root canal", is recommended if the pulp in a tooth dies from infection by decay-causing bacteria or from trauma.  During a root canal, the pulp of the tooth, including the nerve and vascular tissues, is removed along with decayed portions of the tooth. The canals are instrumented with endodontic files to clean and shape them, and they are then usually filled with a rubber-like material called [[gutta percha]].<ref>[http://www.aae.org/patients/faqs/rootcanals.htm FAQs About Root Canal Treatment], hosted on the American Association of Endodontists website. Page accessed August 16, 2006.</ref>  The tooth is filled and a crown can be placed.  Upon completion of a root canal, the tooth is now non-vital, as it is devoid of any living tissue.

An [[Extraction (dental)|extraction]] can also serve as treatment for dental caries.  The removal of the decayed tooth is performed if the tooth is too far destroyed from the decay process to effectively restore the tooth.  Extractions are sometimes considered if the tooth lacks an opposing tooth or will probably cause further problems in the future, as may be the case for [[wisdom teeth]].<ref>[http://www.aaoms.org/public/Pamphlets/WisdomTeeth.pdf Wisdom Teeth], packet in pdf format hosted by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Page accessed August 16, 2006.</ref>  Extractions may also be preferred by patients unable or unwilling to undergo the expense or difficulties in restoring the tooth.

The classic "DMF" (decay/missing/filled) index is one of the most common methods for assessing caries prevalence as well as dental treatment needs among populations. This index is based on in-field clinical examination of individuals by using a probe, mirror and cotton rolls. Because the DMF index is done without [[X-ray]] imaging, it underestimates real caries prevalence and treatment needs.<ref name=HC/>

There is a long history of dental caries. Over a million years ago, [[hominid]]s such as [[Australopithecus]] suffered from cavities.<ref name="uicanthropology">[http://www.uic.edu/classes/osci/osci590/11_1Epidemiology.htm Epidemiology of Dental Disease], hosted on the University of Illinois at Chicago website.

Archaeological evidence shows that tooth decay is an ancient disease dating far into [[prehistory]].  [[human skull|Skull]]s dating from a million years ago through the [[neolithic]] period show signs of caries, excepting those from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] ages.<ref name="uicanthropology"/>  The increase of caries during the neolithic period may be attributed to the increased consumption of plant foods containing carbohydrates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richards MP |title=A brief review of the archaeological evidence for Palaeolithic and Neolithic subsistence |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=16 p following 1262 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12494313 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601646 |url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v56/n12/full/1601646a.html}}</ref>  The beginning of rice cultivation in [[South Asia]] is also believed to have caused an increase in caries.

A [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] text from 5000 BC describes a "tooth worm" as the cause of caries.<ref name="adahistory">[http://www.ada.org/public/resources/history/timeline_ancient.asp History of Dentistry: Ancient Origins], hosted on the [http://www.ada.org American Dental Association] website.

The rate of caries remained low through the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]], but sharply increased during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="uicanthropology"/>  Periodic increases in caries prevalence had been small in comparison to the 1000 AD increase, when [[sugar cane]] became more accessible to the Western world.  Treatment consisted mainly of herbal remedies and charms, but sometimes also included [[bloodletting]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson T |title=Dental treatment in Medieval England |journal=Br Dent J |volume=197 |issue=7 |pages=419–25 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15475905 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4811723 |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v197/n7/full/4811723a.html}}</ref>  The [[barber surgeon]]s of the time provided services that included [[Extraction (dental)|tooth extractions]].<ref name="suddickhistorical"/>  Learning their training from apprenticeships, these health providers were quite successful in ending tooth pain and likely prevented systemic spread of infections in many cases.

There is also evidence of caries increase in North American Indians after contact with colonizing Europeans.  Before colonization, North American Indians subsisted on hunter-gatherer diets, but afterwards there was a greater reliance on [[maize]] agriculture, which made these groups more susceptible to caries.<ref name="uicanthropology"/>

During the European [[Age of Enlightenment]], the belief that a "tooth worm" caused caries was also no longer accepted in the European medical community.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerabek WE |title=The tooth-worm: historical aspects of a popular medical belief |journal=Clin Oral Investig |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=1999 |month=March |pmid=10522185 |url=http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00784/bibs/9003001/90030001.htm |doi=10.1007/s007840050070}}</ref>   [[Pierre Fauchard]], known as the father of modern dentistry, was one of the first to reject the idea that worms caused tooth decay and noted that sugar was detrimental to the teeth and [[gingiva]].<ref>McCauley, H.

In the 1890s, W.D. Miller conducted a series of studies that led him to propose an explanation for dental caries that was influential for current theories. He found that bacteria inhabited the mouth and that they produced acids that dissolved tooth structures when in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kleinberg I |title=A mixed-bacteria ecological approach to understanding the role of the oral bacteria in dental caries causation: an alternative to Streptococcus mutans and the specific-plaque hypothesis |journal=Crit Rev Oral Biol Med. |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=108–25 |date=1 March 2002|pmid=12097354 |url=http://crobm.iadrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12097354 |doi=10.1177/154411130201300202}}</ref>  This explanation is known as the chemoparasitic caries theory.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Baehni PC, Guggenheim B |title=Potential of diagnostic microbiology for treatment and prognosis of dental caries and periodontal diseases |journal=Crit Rev Oral Biol Med. |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=259–77 |year=1996 |pmid=8909881 |url=http://crobm.iadrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/7/3/259.pdf |doi=10.1177/10454411960070030401}}</ref>  Miller's contribution, along with the research on plaque by G.V. Black and J.L. Williams, served as the foundation for the current explanation of the etiology of caries.<ref name="suddickhistorical"/>  Several of the specific strains of bacteria were identified in 1921 by [[Fernando E. Rodriguez Vargas]].
