The '''ulna''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|l|n|ə}}<ref>''[[OED]]'' 2nd edition, 1989.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ulna Entry "ulna"] in ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]''.</ref>) or '''elbow bone''' is one of the two long bones in the [[forearm]], the other being the [[radius (bone)|radius]]. It is [[prism (geometry)|prism]]atic in form and runs parallel to the radius, which is shorter and smaller. In anatomical position (i.e. when the arms are down at the sides of the body and the palms of the hands face forward) the ulna is located at the side of the forearm closest to the body (the [[Anatomical terms of location#Relative directions|medial]] side), the side of the [[little finger]].

==Articulations==
The ulna articulates with:

* trochlea of the [[humerus]], at the right side [[Elbow-joint|elbow]] as a [[hinge joint]] with semilunar trochlear notch of the ulna.
* the [[Radius (bone)|radius]], near the elbow as a [[pivot joint]], this allows the radius to cross over the ulna in [[pronation]].
* the [[distal radius]], where it fits into the [[ulnar notch]].
* the radius along its length via the [[interosseous membrane]] that forms a [[syndesmoses]] joint
* it is also called the poisidion

==Proximal and distal aspects==
The ulna is broader ''proximally'', and narrower ''distally''.

Proximally, the ulna has a bony [[Process (anatomy)|process]], the [[olecranon process]], a hook-like structure that fits into the [[olecranon fossa]] of the '''humerus'''. This prevents [[hyperextension]] and forms a hinge joint with the [[trochlea of the humerus]].
There is also a [[radial notch]] for the [[head of the radius]], and the [[ulnar tuberosity]] to which muscles attach. 

At the distal end of the ulna is a [[Ulnar styloid process|styloid process]].

==  Structure ==
The long, narrow medullary cavity is enclosed in a strong wall of compact tissue which is thickest along the interosseous border and dorsal surface. At the extremities the compact layer thins. The compact layer is continued onto the back of the olecranon as a plate of close spongy bone with lamellæ parallel. From the inner surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabeculæ arch forward toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabeculæ, passing backward over the medullary cavity from the upper part of the shaft below the coronoid. Below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabeculæ curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the semilunar notch which is coated with a thin layer of compact bone.  The trabeculæ at the lower end have a more longitudinal direction.

==Fracture==
Specific [[bone fracture|fracture]] types of the ulna include:
*[[Monteggia fracture]] - a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna with the dislocation of the [[head of the radius]]
*[[Hume fracture]] - a fracture of the [[olecranon]] with an associated [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|anterior]] [[Joint dislocation|dislocation]] of the [[Head of radius|radial head]]

==In other animals==
In four-legged animals, the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb, and the ulna is important primarily for muscular attachment. In many mammals, the ulna is partially or wholly fused with the radius, and may therefore not exist as a separate bone. However, even in extreme cases of fusion, such as in [[horse]]s, the olecranon process is still present, albeit as a projection from the upper radius.<ref name=VB>{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|page= 200|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}</ref>
