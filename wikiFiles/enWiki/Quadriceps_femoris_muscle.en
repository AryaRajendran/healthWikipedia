The '''quadriceps femoris''' ([[Latin]] for "four-headed [[muscle]] of the [[femur]]"), also called simply the '''quadriceps''', '''quadriceps extensor''', '''quads''', is a large muscle group that includes the four prevailing muscles on the front of the [[thigh]]. It is the great [[Extension (kinesiology)|extensor]] muscle of the knee, forming a large fleshy mass which covers the front and sides of the [[femur]]. The proper Latin [[plural]] form of the [[adjective]] ''quadriceps'' would be ''quadricipites''.  In modern English usage, ''quadriceps'' is used in both [[Grammatical number|singular]] and plural. The singular form ''quadricep'', produced by [[hypercorrection]], is frequently used.

==Portions==
It is subdivided into four separate portions or 'heads', which have received distinctive names:
*[[Rectus femoris]] occupies the middle of the thigh, covering most of the other three quadriceps muscles. It originates on the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]]. It is named from its straight course.

*The other three lie deep to rectus femoris and originate from the body of the [[femur]], which they cover from the [[Human trochanter|trochanter]]s to the [[Condyle (anatomy)|condyle]]s:
**[[Vastus lateralis]] is on the ''lateral side'' of the femur (i.e. on the outer side of the thigh).
**[[Vastus medialis]] is on the ''medial side'' of the femur (i.e. on the inner part thigh).
**[[Vastus intermedius]] lies between vastus lateralis and vastus medialis on the ''front'' of the femur (i.e. on the top or front of the thigh), but deep to the rectus femoris. Typically, it cannot be seen without dissection of the rectus femoris.

All four parts of the quadriceps muscle ultimately insert into the [[tibial tuberosity]] of the [[tibia]]. This is via the [[patella]], where the [[quadriceps tendon]] becomes the [[patellar ligament]], which then attaches to the tibia.

There is a fifth muscle of the quadriceps complex that is often forgotten and rarely taught called articularis genu.

==Actions==
All four quadriceps are powerful [[Extension (kinesiology)|extensors]] of the [[knee]] joint. They are crucial in walking, running, jumping and squatting. Because [[rectus femoris]] attaches to the ilium, it is also a [[flexion|flexor]] of the hip. This action is also crucial to walking or running as it swings the leg forward into the ensuing step. The quadriceps, specifically the [[vastus medialis]], plays the important role of stabilizing the [[patella]] and the knee joint during gait.<ref name="Kisner">Therapeutic Exercises, Carolyn Kisner & Lynn A. Colby, 5th ed. (2002) 692-93.</ref>

==Training==
In [[strength training]], the quadriceps are trained by several leg exercises. Effective exercises include the [[squat (exercise)|squat]] and [[leg press]]. The isolation movement (i.e. targets solely the quadriceps) is the [[leg extension]] exercise.  Sprinting, as well as intense anaerobic running, may be an effective muscle building exercise.
