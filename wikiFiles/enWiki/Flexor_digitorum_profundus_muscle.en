In [[human anatomy]], the '''flexor digitorum profundus''' (FDP, Latin for "deep bender of the fingers") is a [[muscle]] in the [[forearm]] that flexes the [[finger]]s (also known as digits). It is considered an extrinsic hand muscle because it acts on the hand while its muscle belly is located in the forearm.  
Together the [[Flexor pollicis longus muscle|flexor pollicis longus]], [[Pronator quadratus muscle|pronator quadratus]], and flexor digitorum profundus form the deep layer of ventral forearm muscles.<ref name="Platzer-162">Platzer 2004, p 162</ref>

== Human anatomy ==
=== Origin and insertion ===
Flexor digitorum profundus originates in the upper 3/4 of the anterior and medial surfaces of the ulna, interosseous membrane and deep fascia of the forearm.  The muscle fans out into four tendons (one to each of the second to fifth fingers) to the palmar base of the distal phalanx.

Along with the [[flexor digitorum superficialis]], it has long [[tendon]]s that run down the arm and through the [[carpal tunnel]] and attach to the palmar side of the [[Phalanx bones|phalanges]] of the fingers.

Flexor digitorum profundus lies deep to the superficialis, but it attaches more distally. Therefore, profundus's [[tendon]]s go through the tendons of superficialis, and end up attaching to the [[distal phalanx]].  For this reason profundus is also called the ''perforating muscle''.<ref name="Platzer-162" />

The [[lumbricals of the hand]] arise from the radial side of its tendons.<ref name="Platzer-162" />

=== Action ===
Flexor digitorum profundus is a flexor of the [[wrist]] ([[Midcarpal joint|midcarpal]]), [[Metacarpophalangeal joint|metacarpophalangeal]] and [[interphalangeal articulations of hand|interphalangeal joints]].<ref name="Platzer-162" />

=== Innervation ===
Flexor digitorum profundus is innervated by the [[anterior interosseous]] and [[ulnar nerve]]s. 
* The ''medial aspect'' of the muscle (which flexes the 4th and 5th digit) is supplied by the [[ulnar nerve]] (C8, T1)
* The ''lateral aspect'' (which flexes the 2nd and 3rd digit) is innervated by the [[median nerve]] specifically the [[anterior interosseous branch]] (C8, T1).
It is one of two flexor muscles that is not exclusively supplied by the median nerve (the other is [[flexor carpi ulnaris]]).

=== Variations ===
The tendon of the index finger often has a separate muscle belly.<ref name="Platzer-162" />

== Evolutionary variation ==
In many primates, the FDP is fused with the [[Flexor pollicis longus muscle|flexor pollicis longus]] (FPL).  In [[great apes]] the belly of the FDP has a separate tendon for the FDP.  In [[Hylobatidae|lesser apes]], both muscles have separate bellies in the forearm, but in [[Old World monkey]]s they separate in the [[carpal tunnel]].  The lack of differentiation in the FDP musculature in [[baboon]]s makes it unlikely that this monkey can control individual fingers independently.
