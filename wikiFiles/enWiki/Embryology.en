'''Embryology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔμβρυον}}, ''embryon'', "the unborn, embryo"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the [[science]] of the development of an [[embryo]] from the [[fertilization]] of the [[ovum]] to the [[fetus]] stage.

==Embryonic development of animals==
After cleavage, the dividing cells, or [[morula]], becomes a hollow ball, or [[blastula]], which develops a hole or pore at one end.

===Bilaterans===
In [[bilateria|bilateral animal]]s, the [[blastula]] develops in one of two ways that divides the whole animal kingdom into two halves (see: ''[[Embryological origins of the mouth and anus]]''). If in the [[blastula]] the first pore ([[blastopore]]) becomes the mouth of the animal, it is a [[protostome]]; if the first pore becomes the anus then it is a [[deuterostome]]. The [[protostomes]] include most [[invertebrate]] animals, such as insects, worms and molluscs, while the [[deuterostomes]] include the [[vertebrates]]. In due course, the [[blastula]] changes into a more differentiated structure called the [[gastrula]].

The [[gastrula]] with its [[blastopore]] soon develops three distinct layers of cells (the [[germ layers]]) from which all the bodily organs and tissues then develop:

* The innermost layer, or [[endoderm]], gives rise to the digestive organs, the gills, lungs or swim bladder if present, and kidneys or nephrites.
* The middle layer, or [[mesoderm]], gives rise to the muscles, skeleton if any, and blood system.
* The outer layer of cells, or [[ectoderm]], gives rise to the nervous system, including the brain, and skin or carapace and hair, bristles, or scales.
Embryos in many species often appear similar to one another in early developmental stages. The reason for this similarity is because species have a shared evolutionary history. These similarities among species are called [[homologous structures]], which are structures that have the same or similar function and mechanism, having evolved from a common ancestor.

====Humans====
Humans are bilaterans and deuterostomes&mdash;the anus develops first.

In humans, the term embryo refers to the ball of dividing cells from the moment the [[zygote]] implants itself in the [[uterus]] wall until the end of the eighth week after conception. Beyond the eighth week after conception (tenth week of pregnancy), the developing human is then called a fetus.

As recently as the 18th century, the prevailing notion in human embryology was [[preformation]]: the idea that semen contains an embryo — a preformed, miniature infant, or "''homunculus''" — that simply becomes larger during development. The competing explanation of embryonic development was ''[[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]]'', originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by [[Aristotle]]. Much early embryology came from the work of the great [[Italy|Italian]] anatomists: [[Ulisse Aldrovandi|Aldrovandi]], [[Aranzio]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Marcello Malpighi]], [[Gabriele Falloppio]], [[Girolamo Cardano]], [[Emilio Parisano]], [[Fortunio Liceti]], [[Stefano Lorenzini]], [[Spallanzani]], [[Enrico Sertoli]], [[Mauro Rusconi]], etc.<ref>Massimo De Felici, Gregorio Siracus, ''[http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/fullaccess/fulltext.0009/ft515.pdf The rise of embryology in Italy: from the Renaissance to the early 20th Century,]'' Int. J. Dev. Biol. 44: 515-521 (2000).</ref> According to epigenesis, the form of an animal emerges gradually from a relatively formless egg. As [[microscopy]] improved during the 19th century, biologists could see that embryos took shape in a series of progressive steps, and epigenesis displaced preformation as the favoured explanation among embryologists.<ref>Campbell et al. (p. 987)</ref>

===After 1827===
[[File:Human embryo 2.JPG|thumb|8-9 weeks human embryo]]
[[Karl Ernst von Baer]] and [[Heinz Christian Pander]] proposed the [[germ layer]] theory of development; von Baer discovered the mammalian ovum in 1827.<ref name=reproduction>{{cite journal|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/62/1/1.full.pdf+html|title=An historical look at embryo transfer|author=K.

Haldane]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. Other important contributors include [[William Harvey]], [[Kaspar Friedrich Wolff]], [[Heinz Christian Pander]], [[August Weismann]], [[Gavin de Beer]], [[Ernest Everett Just]], and [[Edward B. Lewis]].

===After 1950===
After the 1950s, with the [[DNA]] helical structure being unravelled and the increasing knowledge in the field of [[molecular biology]], [[developmental biology]] emerged as a field of study which attempts to correlate the genes with morphological change, and so tries to determine which genes are responsible for each morphological change that takes place in an embryo, and how these genes are regulated.

==Vertebrate and invertebrate embryology==
Many principles of embryology apply to invertebrates as well as to vertebrates.<ref>Parker, Sybil. "Invertebrate Embryology," ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0079115047&id=CMC32Rmo9tYC&q=%22invertebrate+embryology%22+and+%22mcgraw-hill%22&dq=%22invertebrate+embryology%22+and+%22mcgraw-hill%22&pgis=1 McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology]'' (McGraw-Hill 1997).</ref> Therefore, the study of invertebrate embryology has advanced the study of vertebrate embryology. However, there are many differences as well. For example, numerous invertebrate species release a [[larva]] before development is complete; at the end of the larval period, an animal for the first time comes to resemble an adult similar to its parent or parents. Although invertebrate embryology is similar in some ways for different invertebrate animals, there are also countless variations. For instance, while spiders proceed directly from egg to adult form many insects develop through at least one larval stage

==Modern embryology research==
Currently, embryology has become an important research area for studying the [[Genetics|genetic]] control of the development process (e.g. [[morphogens]]), its link to [[cell signalling]], its importance for the study of certain diseases and [[mutation]]s and in links to [[stem cell]] research.
