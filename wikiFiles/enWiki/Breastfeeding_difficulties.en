[[Breastfeeding]] is the feeding of an [[infant]] or young [[child]] with [[milk]] from a woman's [[mammary gland|breasts]]. Babies have a [[sucking reflex]] that enables them to suck and [[wikt:swallow|swallow]] milk. With few exceptions, human [[breast milk]] is the best source of [[nutrition|nourishment]] for human infants.<ref name="Picciano_2001">{{cite journal |author=Picciano M |title=Nutrient composition of human milk |journal=Pediatr Clin North Am |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=53–67 |year=2001 |pmid=11236733 |doi=10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70285-6}}</ref> There are circumstances under which breastfeeding can be problematic, however, or even in rare instances [[contraindicated]].  This article looks at some of the '''difficulties that can arise in breastfeeding'''.

Broadly speaking, difficulties can arise in connection with the act of breastfeeding, on one hand, and the health of the nursing infant, on the other.

== Breastfeeding ==

While breastfeeding difficulties are not uncommon, putting the baby to the breast as soon as possible after birth helps to avoid many problems. The policy of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] on breastfeeding says, "delay weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis until after the first feeding is completed."<ref name="Gartner_2005">{{cite journal | author=Gartner LM, ''et al.'' | title=Breastfeeding and the use of human milk | journal=Pediatrics | year=2005 | pages=496–506 | volume=115 | issue=2 | url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;115/2/496 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2004-2491 | pmid= 15687461}}</ref>  Many breastfeeding difficulties can be resolved with proper hospital procedures, properly trained nurses and hospital staff, speech pathologists and lactation consultants.<ref name="Newman_2000">{{cite book | author = Newman J | authorlink = Jack Newman (doctor) | coauthors = Pitman T | title = Dr. Jack Newman's guide to breastfeeding | publisher = HarperCollins Publishers | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-00-638568-0}}</ref>

This is often done together with [[Kangaroo care]] (prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the mother) which makes later breastfeeding easier. For some suckling difficulties, such as may happen with cleft lip/palate, the baby can be fed with a [[Haberman Feeder]].
*[[Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex]] (D-MER) is a newly recognized condition affecting lactating women that is characterized by an abrupt dysphoria, or negative emotions that occur just before milk release and continuing not more than a few minutes. Preliminary testing tells us that D-MER is treatable and preliminary research tells us that inappropriate dopamine activity at the time of the milk ejection reflex is the cause of D-MER.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d-mer.org|accessdate=2010-09-10|publisher=d-mer.org|title=d-mer.org}}</ref>

=== Breast pain ===

Pain often interferes with successful breastfeeding. It is cited as the second most common cause for the abandonment of exclusive breastfeeding after perceived low milk supply.<ref name=Woolridge_1986>{{cite journal |author=Woolridge M |title=Aetiology of sore nipples |journal=Midwifery |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=172–6 |year=1986 |pmid=3643398 |doi=10.1016/S0266-6138(86)80042-0}}</ref>

=== Engorgement ===
''[[Breast engorgement]]'' is the sense of breast fullness experienced by most women within 36 hours of delivery. Normally, this is a painless sensation of "heaviness". Breastfeeding on demand is the primary way of preventing painful engorgement. 

When the breast overfills with milk it becomes painful. Engorgement comes from not getting enough milk from the breast. It happens about 3 to 7 days after delivery and occurs more often in first time mothers. The increased blood supply, the accumulated milk and the swelling all contribute to the painful engorgement.<ref name=Hill_1994>{{cite journal |author=Hill P, Humenick S |title=The occurrence of breast engorgement |journal=J Hum Lact |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=79–86 |year=1994 |pmid=7619260 |doi=10.1177/089033449401000212}}</ref> Engorgement may affect the areola, the periphery of the breast or the entire breast, and may interfere with breastfeeding both from the pain and also from the distortion of the normal shape of the areola/nipple. This makes it harder for the baby to latch on properly for feeding. Latching may occur over only part of the areola. This can irritate the nipple more, and may lead to ineffective drainage of breast milk and more pain. Engorgement may begin as a result of several factors such as nipple pain, improper feeding technique, infrequent feeding or infant-mother separation.  

To prevent  or treat engorgement, remove the milk from the breast, by breastfeeding, expressing or [[Breast pump|pumping]]. Gentle massage can help start the milk flow and so reduce the pressure. The reduced pressure softens the areola, perhaps even allowing the infant to feed. Warm water or warm compresses and expressing some milk before feeding can also help make breastfeeding more effective. Some researchers have suggested that after breastfeeding, mothers should pump and/or apply cold compresses to reduce swelling pain and vascularity even more. One published study suggested the use of "chilled cabbage leaves" applied to the breasts. Attempts to reproduce this technique met with mixed results.<ref name=Nikodem_1993>{{cite journal |author=Nikodem V, Danziger D, Gebka N, Gulmezoglu A, Hofmeyr G |title=Do cabbage leaves prevent breast engorgement? A randomized, controlled study |journal=Birth |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=61–4 |year=1993 |pmid=8240608 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1993.tb00418.x}}</ref> [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] or [[paracetamol]] (acetominophen) may relieve the pain.

=== Nipple pain ===

Sore [[nipples]] (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are probably the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days.<ref name=Ziemer_1990>{{cite journal |author=Ziemer M, Paone J, Schupay J, Cole E |title=Methods to prevent and manage nipple pain in breastfeeding women |journal=West J Nurs Res |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=732–43; discussion 743–4 |year=1990 |pmid=2275191 |doi=10.1177/019394599001200603}}</ref> Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction at the end of the feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute.<ref name=Cable_1997>{{cite journal |author=Cable B, Stewart M, Davis J |title=Nipple wound care: a new approach to an old problem |journal=J Hum Lact |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=313–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9429367 |doi=10.1177/089033449701300417}}</ref> Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection.<ref name="Amir_2006">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000292031 | author = Amir L | coauthors = Garland S, Dennerstein L, Farish S | title = Candida albicans: is it associated with nipple pain in lactating women? | journal = Gynecol Obstet Invest | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = pp. 30–34 | publisher = Karger | year = 1996 | pmid = 8821881}}</ref> When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Treatment with [[botulinum toxin]] has been described.<ref name="pmid16983025">{{cite journal |author=Eigelshoven S, Kruse R, Rauch L, Hanneken S, Ruzicka T, Neumann NJ |title=Thelalgia in man: successful treatment with botulinum toxin |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=9 |pages=1242–3 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16983025 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.9.1242 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16983025}}</ref>

=== Candidiasis ===

Symptoms of [[candidiasis]] of the breast include pain, [[pruritus|itching]], burning and redness, or a shiny or white patchy appearance. The baby could have a white tongue that does not wipe clean. Candidiasis is common and may be associated with infant [[candidiasis|thrush]]. Both mother and baby must be treated to get rid of this infection; first-line therapies include nystatin, ketaconacole or miconazole applied to the nipple and given by mouth to the baby. Strict cleaning of clothing and breast pumps is also required to eradicate the infection.<ref name=Tanguay_1994>{{cite journal |author=Tanguay K, McBean M, Jain E |title=Nipple candidiasis among breastfeeding mothers. Case-control study of predisposing factors |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=40 |issue= |pages=1407–13 |year=1994 |pmid=8081120 |pmc=2380126}}</ref>

Another effective treatment of candidia is the use of gentian violet. When the nursing mother has a Candidal infection of the nipple, she may experience severe nipple pain, as well as deep breast pain.   Please note: Gentian violet 1% in water also contains alcohol.   Apparently some pharmacists are now dissolving it in glycerin, thus avoiding the use of alcohol. It is believed that gentian violet  is the best treatment of nipple soreness due to Candida albicans for the breastfeeding mother.   This is because it usually works, and relief is rapid.   It is messy, and will stain clothing (actually, it will usually wash out), but not skin.   The baby's lips will turn purple, but the purple will disappear after a few days.   Gentian violet is available without prescription but is not available at all pharmacies.   Call around before going out to get it.

=== Milk stasis ===

Milk stasis is when a milk duct is blocked and cannot drain properly. This may affect only a part of the breast and is not associated with any infection. It can be treated by varying the baby's feeding position and applying heat before feeding. If it happens more than once, further evaluation is needed.

=== Mastitis ===

{{Main|puerperal mastitis}}
Mastitis is an [[inflammation]] of the breast. It causes local pain (''dolor''), redness (''rubor''), swelling (''tumor''), and warmth (''calor''). Later stages of mastitis cause symptoms of systemic [[infection]] like fever and nausea. It mostly occurs 2–3 weeks after delivery but can happen at any time.<ref name=Kinlay_1998>{{cite journal |author=Evans M, Heads J |title=Incidence of mastitis in breastfeeding women during the six months after delivery: a prospective cohort study |journal=Med J Aust |volume=170 |issue=4 |pages=192 |year=1999 |pmid=10078195}}</ref> Typically results from milk stasis with primary or secondary local, later systemic [[infection]]. Infectious organisms include ''[[Staphylococcus]] sp.'', ''[[Streptococcus]] sp.'' and ''[[E. coli]]''. Continued breastfeeding, plenty of rest and adequate fluid supply is the best treatment for light cases.

===Overactive let-down===
{{main|Overactive let-down}}
Overactive let-down (OALD) is the forceful ejection of milk from the breast during breastfeeding. The forceful spray of milk can cause the baby to consume too much milk too quickly as well as to swallow air during the period of rapid swallowing following the let-down.

===Raynaud's of the Nipple===
{{main|Raynaud's of the Nipple}}

Very rarely, nipple pain can be caused by vasospasm of the nipple. In essence, blood does not flow properly to the nipple which causes the nipple to blanch. This can be caused by trauma to the nipple through early breastfeeding or candidal infection of the nipple. The pain is intense during the latch stage and in between breastfeeding sessions there is a throbbing pain when the nipple is blanched. The nipple can be massaged to help blood flow return to reduce pain, as well as avoiding cold. In some instances, heart medication, nifedipine, is used to help the blood flow return to the nipple.

== Health of the infant ==

Infants with classic [[galactosemia]] cannot digest lactose and therefore cannot benefit from breast milk.<ref name="CDC_Contra" /> Breastfeeding might harm the baby also if the mother has untreated pulmonary [[tuberculosis]], is taking certain medications that suppress the [[immune system]].<ref name="CDC_Contra" /> has [[human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]],<ref name="CDC_Contra">{{cite web | title = When should a mother avoid breastfeeding? | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 2006-08-26 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/contraindicators.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-04 }}</ref><ref name="Unicef_HIV">{{cite web | title = HIV and Infant Feeding | publisher = Unicef | url = http://www.unicef.org/programme/breastfeeding/hiv.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-19 }}</ref> or uses potentially harmful substances such as [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[amphetamine]]s.<ref name=Gartner_2005 /> Other than cases of acute poisoning, no environmental contaminant has been found to cause more harm to infants than lack of breastfeeding. Although [[heavy metals]] such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are dispersed throughout the environment and are of concern to the nursing infant, the neurodevelopmental benefits of human milk tend to override the potential adverse effects of neurotoxicants.<ref name=Mead/>

===Transmission of infection===
==== Tuberculosis ====
It is not safe for mothers with active, untreated [[tuberculosis]] to breastfeed until they are no longer contagious.<ref name=Gartner_2005 /> According to the American Academy of Pediatrics 2006 Redbook: {{cquote|Women with tuberculosis who have been treated appropriately for 2 or more weeks and who are not considered contagious may breastfeed. Women with tuberculosis disease suspected of being contagious should refrain from breastfeeding or any other close contact with the infant because of potential transmission through respiratory tract droplets (see Tuberculosis, p 678). ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' rarely causes mastitis or a breast abscess, but if a breast abscess caused by ''M. tuberculosis'' is present, breastfeeding should be discontinued until the mother no longer is contagious.}}

In areas where BCG vaccination is the standard of care, the [[WHO]] provides treatment recommendations and advises mothers to continue breastfeeding.<ref name="WHO_Tub">[http://www.who.int/child-adolescent-health/New_Publications/NUTRITION/Breastfeeding_Tub.pdf The WHO] on Breastfeeding and maternal tuberculosis; acquired 2006-08-19</ref> TBC may be congenital, or perinatally acquired through airborne droplet spread.<ref name="Nemir_1985">{{cite journal |author=Nemir R, O'Hare D |title=Congenital tuberculosis.

==== HIV ====
Research published in the [[The Lancet|Lancet]]<ref name="Coovadia_2007">{{cite journal |author= Coovadia, H. M.; Rollins, N. C.; Bland, R. M.; Little, K.; Coutsoudis, A.; Bennish, M.

Research on the timing of HIV transmission in 2000 revealed that a "substantial transmission occurs early during breastfeeding," concluding that 75% of all breast milk transmission had occurred within the first 6 months during a randomized control trial in Kenya.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nduati R.

In fact, the World Health Organization recommended breastfeeding in 1987 and 1992 for seropositive and seronegative women in areas where [[malnutrition]] and [[infectious diseases]] are the major cause of infant mortality.<ref>World Health Organization.

''Wkly Epidemiol Rec''. 1996; 71:289-291.</ref>  In the days before the AIDS epidemic was clearly understood, some researchers pointed to the need to increase breastfeeding rates and pointed to the risks of formula feeding, citing increased rates of marasmus and diarrhea.<ref>Jelliffe, D., Jelliffe, E.

Jelliffe also criticized the marketing of infant formulas by U.S. companies to resource-poor countries, something they termed "comerciogenic malnutrition."

===Transmission of drugs and toxins===
==== Medications ====
The vast majority of medicines are compatible with breastfeeding, but there are some that might be passed onto the child through the milk.<ref name="AAP_CoD">{{cite journal | author = American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs | title = The Transfer of Drugs and Other Chemicals Into Human Milk | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = pp. 776–789 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11533352 }}</ref>

====Tobacco smoking====
{{See also|Women and smoking#Unique gender differences and health effects for Females}}
If one does continue [[tobacco smoking]] after giving birth, however, it is still more beneficial to [[breastfeed]] than to completely avoid this practice altogether. There is evidence that breastfeeding offers protection against many [[infectious diseases]], especially diarrhea. Even in babies exposed to the harmful effects of nicotine through breast milk, the likelihood of acute respiratory illness is significantly diminished when compared to infants whose mothers smoked but were formula fed.<ref name="menella">Mennella, J. A. et al. 2007. Breastfeeding and Smoking: Short-term Effects on Infant Feeding and Sleep. Pediatrics. 120: 497-502</ref>  Regardless, the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks of nicotine exposure. 

The main concern about smoking and breastfeeding is that infants may have smoking-induced reductions to the milk iodine content.<ref name="menella"/>  Smoking can adversely affect the [[lactation]] process by decreasing milk production and altering the milk composition. Smoking reduces daily milk output by roughly 250–300&nbsp;mL.  Not only will this be problematic on a daily basis for not producing enough milk, it will also cause the mother to wean her baby early.<ref name="najdawi">Najdawi, F. and Faouri, M. 1999. Maternal smoking and breastfeeding. Eastern
Mediterranean Health Journal. 5(3): 450-456</ref>  The altered milk composition also caused infants to exhibit daily behaviors such as [[colic]] and crying which can promote early weaning, again something that is not beneficial to the infant.<ref name="menella"/> 

Also, the nicotine obtained from smoking travels through a woman into her breast milk, thus giving nicotine to her child.<ref>The [http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/news/speeches/06272006a.html U.S. Surgeon General's Report] ([http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/report/chapter5.pdf Chapter 5]; pages 180-194).</ref> 

Heavy use of [[cigarette]]s by the mother (more than 20 per day) has been shown to reduce the mother's milk supply and cause vomiting, [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]], rapid heart rate, and restlessness in breastfed infants. [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] (SIDS) is more common in babies exposed to a smoky environment.<ref name=Gunn_2000>{{cite journal |author=Gunn A, Gunn T, Mitchell E |title=CLINICAL REVIEW ARTICLE: Is changing the sleep environment enough?

==== Other substance abuse ====
The baby's risk from something unsafe in breast milk depends on how much of that substance the baby gets. The level of risk depends on the concentration of the substance in the breast milk and how much milk the infant consumes. Finally, that risk is weighed against the risks of using a substitute for breast milk, such as infant formula.

Heavy alcohol consumption harms the infant, causing problems with the development of motor skills and decreasing the speed of weight gain.
