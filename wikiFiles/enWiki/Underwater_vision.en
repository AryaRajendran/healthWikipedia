[[Light ray]]s bend when they travel from one medium to another; the amount of bending is determined by the [[Refractive index|refractive indices]] of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a [[lens (optics)|lens]]. The [[cornea]], humours, and [[crystalline lens]] of the [[human eye|eye]] together form a lens that focuses images on the [[retina]]. Our eyes are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), effectively eliminating the cornea's focusing properties. When our eyes are in water, instead of their focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from [[hypermetropia]].<ref name=adolfson>{{cite book |author=Adolfson J and Berghage, T |title=Perception and Performance Under Water |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=1974 |isbn=0-471-00900-8 }}</ref><ref name=science>{{cite journal |author=Luria SM, Kinney JA |title=Underwater vision |journal=Science |volume=167 |issue=3924 |pages=1454–61 |year=1970 |month=March |pmid=5415277 |doi= 10.1126/science.167.3924.1454|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=5415277 |accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

== Fish ==
The crystalline lenses of [[Fish|fishes']] eyes are extremely [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|convex]], almost spherical, and their refractive indices are the highest of all the animals. These properties enable proper focusing of the light rays and in turn proper image formation on the retina. This convex lens gives the name to the [[fisheye lens]] in photography.

== Masks and goggles ==

[[File:FlatMask above-below.jpg|thumb|right|Views through a flat mask, above and below water]]By wearing a flat [[diving mask]], humans can see clearly under water.<ref name=adolfson/><ref name=science/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Weltman G, Christianson RA, Egstrom GH |title=Visual fields of the scuba diver |journal=Hum Factors |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=423–30 |year=1965 |month=October |pmid=5882204 |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> The scuba mask's flat window separates one's eyes from the surrounding water by a layer of air. Light rays entering from water into the flat parallel window change their direction minimally within the window material itself.<ref name=adolfson/> But when these rays exit the window into the air space between the flat window and the eye, the [[refraction]] is quite noticeable. The view paths refract (bend) in a manner similar to viewing fish kept in an aquarium. [[Photographic filter#Polarizer|Linear polarizing filters]] decrease visibility underwater by limiting ambient light and dimming artificial light sources.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Luria SM, Kinney JA |title=Linear polarizing filters and underwater vision |journal=Undersea Biomed Res |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=371–8 |year=1974 |month=December |pmid=4469103 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2668 |accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>

While wearing a flat scuba mask or [[goggles]], objects underwater will appear 33% bigger (34% bigger in salt water) and 25% closer than they actually are.<ref name=adolfson/> Also [[Image distortion#Pincushion_distortion|pincushion distortion]] and [[Chromatic aberration|lateral chromatic aberration]] are noticeable. [[Diving mask#Types_of_diving_mask|Double-dome masks]] restore natural sized underwater vision and field of view, with certain limitations.<ref name=adolfson/>

== Color vision ==
Water is responsible for the attenuation of light due to absorption.<ref name=adolfson/> In other words, as we go deeper on a dive, more color is absorbed by the water. Color vision is also affected by turbidity of the water as well as particulate matter.

The best colors to use for visibility in water was shown by Luria et al. and quoted from Adolfson and Berghage below:<ref name=adolfson/><ref name=science/>

 A. For murky, turbid water of low visibility (rivers, harbors, etc.)
    1. With natural illumination:
        a. Fluorescent yellow, orange, and red.
        b. Regular yellow, orange, and white.
    2. With incandescent illumination:
        a. Fluorescent and regular yellow, orange, red and white.
    3. With a mercury light source:
        a. Fluorescent yellow-green and yellow-orange.
        b. Regular yellow and white.
 
 B. For moderately turbid water (sounds, bays, coastal water).
    1. With natural illumination or incandescent light source:
        a. Any fluorescent in the yellows, oranges, and reds.
        b. Regular yellow, orange, and white.
    2. With a mercury light source:
        a. Fluorescent yellow-green and yellow-orange.
        b. Regular yellow and white.
 
 C. For clear water (southern water, deep water off shore, etc.).
    1. With any type of illumination fluorescent paints are superior.
        a. With long viewing distances, fluorescent green and yellow-green.
        b. With short viewing distances, fluorescent orange is excellent.
    2. With natural illumination:
        a. Fluorescent paints.
        b. Regular yellow, orange, and white.
    3. With incandescent light source:
        a. Fluorescent paints.
        b. Regular yellow, orange, and white.
    4. With a mercury light source:
        a. Fluorescent paints.
        b. Regular yellow, white.
 
 The most difficult colors at the limits of visibility with a water
 background are dark colors such as gray or black.

== Biological variations ==
A very [[Short sighted|short-sighted]] person (eyesight abnormality resulting from the eye's faulty refractive index due to which the distant objects appear blurred) can see more or less normally under water. [[Scuba divers]] with interest in [[underwater photography]] may notice [[presbyopic]] changes while diving before they recognize the symptoms in their normal routines due to the near focus in low light conditions.<ref name="pmid22692711">{{cite journal |author=Bennett QM |title=New thoughts on the correction of presbyopia for divers |journal=Diving Hyperb Med |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=163–4 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=22692711 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10206 |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref>

The [[Moken]] people of South-East Asia are able to focus underwater to pick up tiny shellfish and other food items.<ref>{{Wayback|url=http://www.cdnn.info/news/article/a040514.html|title=Moken Sea Gypsies: Seeing Underwater|date=20080829133540}}</ref> Gislén et al. have compared Moken and European children and found that the underwater visual acuity of the Moken was twice that of their European counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gislén A, Dacke M, Kröger RH, Abrahamsson M, Nilsson DE, Warrant EJ |title=Superior underwater vision in a human population of sea gypsies |journal=Curr.

This is due to the contraction of the [[pupil]], instead of the usual dilation ([[mydriasis]]) that is undergone when a normal, untrained eye, accustomed to viewing in air, is submerged. <ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gxmg1</ref>
