==Discovery==
Handigodu syndrome was first noticed by H M Chandrashekhar in the village of Handigodu during the years 1974-75.<ref name="outl"/> Four patients who complained of severe joint and hip pain were admitted to the General Hospital at [[Sagara, India|Sagar]]. The doctors who could not diagnose the problem attributed the pain to some [[neurological]] disorder.<ref name="maln"/> Seeking advice on this disease, a team of experts led by K. S. Mani, a [[neurologist]] from [[NIMHANS]], [[Bangalore]] visited the region.<ref name="maln"/> After examining the patients, they ruled out any neurological disorder and implied that the pain was due to a bone and joint disorder.

==Research==
A team from the [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad]] conducted research in the affected regions and found out that the disease was confined to a [[dalit]] colony.<ref name="maln"/> They also found out that the disease was affecting people of all age groups and it was non-[[Contagious disease|contagious]] and non-[[infection|infectious]]. This research was further followed by research conducted over four years (1984–88) by the [[Indian Council of Medical Research]] (ICMR). Study groups involving experts from different medical fields were formed and these groups visited the affected places to conduct experiments. They were also helped by the Health Department of Karnataka who also provided a team to assist them. Despite undertaking extensive research, the team could not come into any conclusion on the cause of the disease.<ref name="maln"/> The team wound up in 1988 and this was the first phase of their research. The second phase of the research by ICMR was started in the year 2001 under the leadership of S. S. Agarwal of the [[Sanjay Gandhi]] Post-graduate centre in [[Lucknow]]. Some of the activities in the second phase were to [[x-ray]] the patients and also study their [[family history]] to see if the disease was related to [[genetics]]. The study reported that Handigodu syndrome is a syndrome of familial [[Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type|spondyloepi(meta)physeal dysplasia]].<ref name=agarwal>{{cite journal |last=Agarwal |first=SS|coauthors= Phadke SR, Phadke RV, Das SK, Singh GK,  Sharma JP, Teotia SP, Saxena BN|year= 1994|month= |title=November |journal=Skeletal Radiology |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages= 611–9|id=   | issn = 0364-2348| pmid =7886470  }}</ref> It is inherited as an [[autosomal dominant]] trait.<ref name=agarwal/> All the presentations of the varied manifestation of the disease could be explained as being caused by defective development of bones as a result of [[monogenic disorder]].<ref name=agarwal/>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of the disease are an acute pain and swelling in the hips and knee joints. Some of the other characteristics of this disease are [[dwarfism]] from birth, [[deformity|deformation]] of the limbs after age seven and death as early as between 25 and 30 years or even younger.<ref name="outl"/> Depending on the mobility of the affected patients, the disease has been identified with three severities: in mild to moderate cases, the patient is able to walk with difficulty, in severe cases mobility is very restricted, whereas in acute cases the limbs are bent and badly crippled making the patients crawl.<ref name="maln"/>

==Possible causes==
Many theories have been put forth as possible causes of this disease:
* The disease may be because the patients consumed pesticides intoxicated [[crab]]s as food.<ref name="outl"/>
* The disease may be because there were quite a few cases where marriages had taken place between close family members.<ref name="outl"/>

==Assistance==
A subsistence allowance is provided to the patients by the [[Government of Karnataka]] from the fund reserved for the physically challenged. Assistance has also been provided to construct houses for them. A special treatment unit has been set up in the Government Hospital at Sagar with an [[ambulance]] provided to shift the affected patients to the hospital.<ref name="outl"/> [[H. D. Kumaraswamy]], then [[Chief Minister]] of [[Karnataka]] spent a night at Handigodu village and has assured the Government's assistance in eradicating this disease.
