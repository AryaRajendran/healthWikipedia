'''Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema''' (abbreviated '''RS3PE''' or sometimes '''RS<sub>3</sub>PE''') is a rare [[syndrome]] identified by symmetric [[polyarthritis]], [[synovitis]], acute pitting [[edema]] of the back of the hands and/or feet, and a negative [[Serum (blood)|serum]] [[rheumatoid factor]].<ref name="pmid10948764">{{cite journal |author=Olivieri I, Salvarani C, Cantini F |title=RS3PE syndrome: an overview |journal=Clin.

If no underlying disorder can be identified ([[idiopathic]] RS3PE), this entity has an excellent prognosis and responds well to treatment.<ref name="pmid12750942">{{cite journal |author=Queiro R |title=RS3PE syndrome: a clinical and immunogenetical study |journal=Rheumatol.

RS3PE typically involves the joints of the extremities, specifically the [[metacarpophalangeal joint|metacarpophalangeal]] and [[proximal interphalangeal joint]]s, [[wrist]]s, [[shoulder]]s, [[elbow]]s, [[knee]]s and [[ankle]]s.<ref name="pmid9034993"/>
It is more common in [[Old age|older adults]], with the mean age between 70 and 80 years in most studies.<ref name="pmid9034993">{{cite journal |author=Olivé A, del Blanco J, Pons M, Vaquero M, Tena X |title=The clinical spectrum of remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema.

It is unknown how common this condition is.

==Causes==
RS3PE is a constellation of symptoms that can be caused by many other conditions. Since there is no definitive diagnostic test, other conditions have to be [[differential diagnosis|ruled out]] before this rare condition can be diagnosed.

The main differential diagnosis is [[polymyalgia rheumatica]] (PMR), although pain, stiffness and weakness at the level of the shoulders and pelvic girdle with associated systemic symptoms ([[fever]], [[malaise]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[weight loss]]) is more typical of PMR. Prospective studies have found a subgroup of PMR patients with hand edema, as well as other similarities.<ref name="pmid10364902">{{cite journal |author=Cantini F, Salvarani C, Olivieri I, ''et al.'' |title=Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema (RS3PE) syndrome: a prospective follow up and magnetic resonance imaging study |journal=Ann. Rheum. Dis. |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=230–6 |year=1999 |month=April |pmid=10364902 |pmc=1752869 |doi= 10.1136/ard.58.4.230|url=http://ard.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10364902}}</ref> Thus, RS3PE has been proposed as a condition related to PMR or even that they are both part of the same disorder.<ref name="pmid10364902"/> However, PMR typically requires protracted courses of steroids, whereas corticosteroids can be tapered more quickly with persisting remission in RS3PE.<ref name="pmid10364902"/>

Other rheumatological disorders that can cause the features typical for RS3PE include late onset (seronegative) [[rheumatoid arthritis]], acute [[sarcoidosis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]] and other [[spondyloarthropathies]] such as [[psoriatic arthropathy]], [[mixed connective tissue disease]], [[chondrocalcinosis]] and arthropathy due to [[amyloidosis]].<ref name="pmid18759976"/><ref name="pmid12422012">{{cite journal |author=Díez-Porres L, Muñoz-Fernández S, Aguado P, Alonso M, Martín-Mola E |title=Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema as the first manifestation of psoriatic arthropathy |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford) |volume=41 |issue=11 |pages=1333–5 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12422012 |doi= 10.1093/rheumatology/41.11.1333-a|url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12422012}}</ref>

RS3PE has been documented in patients with [[cancer]]s ([[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[gastric cancer]], [[pancreatic cancer]], [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], [[prostate cancer]] and bladder cancer, among others), in whom it might represent a [[paraneoplastic]] manifestation.<ref name="pmid16142875">{{cite journal |author=Russell EB |title=Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema syndrome: followup for neoplasia |journal=J.

Other underlying disorders include [[vasculitis|vasculitides]] such as [[polyarteritis nodosa]].<ref name="pmid12422012"/>

Other causes of edema include [[heart failure]], [[hypoalbuminemia]], [[nephrotic syndrome]] and [[venous stasis]]. The key distinguishing feature is that these conditions don't tend to manifest with pitting edema at the back of the hands.

==Diagnosis==
Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging of the hands and/or feet have been proposed as useful diagnostic investigations in RS3PE.<ref name="pmid15856369">{{cite journal |author=Agarwal V, Dabra AK, Kaur R, Sachdev A, Singh R |title=Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome: ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool |journal=Clin.

Some studies linked RS3PE to [[HLA-B27]] whereas others have not.

==Treatment==
RS3PE responds excellently to low dose [[corticosteroids]], with sustained and often complete remission. [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) have also been used. [[Hydroxychloroquine]] has proven effective in some cases.<ref name="pmid18759976"/>

==Disease mechanism==
The disease mechanism (pathophysiology) of RS3PE remains unknown. One study suggested a possible role for [[vascular endothelial growth factor]].<ref name="pmid16227418">{{cite journal |author=Arima K, Origuchi T, Tamai M, ''et al.'' |title=RS3PE syndrome presenting as vascular endothelial growth factor associated disorder |journal=Ann.

In a 1985 paper published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]], McCarty and colleagues first described a case series of patients with this disorder, for which they coined the abbreviation RS3PE.<ref name="pmid4057484">{{cite journal |author=McCarty DJ, O'Duffy JD, Pearson L, Hunter JB |title=Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema.
