'''Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)''' is the name for a group of clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogeneous disorders associated with atrophy in the [[frontal lobe]] and [[temporal lobe]] of the [[brain]], with sparing of the [[parietal lobe|parietal]] and [[occipital lobe]]s.

In the over 65 age group, FTLD is probably the fourth most common cause of [[dementia]] after [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[dementia with Lewy bodies]] and [[vascular dementia]]. In the below 65 age group, it is the second most common cause after Alzheimer's disease. In some patients the symptoms of FTLD and Alzheimer's may overlap<ref>Rajka M. Liscic, MD, PhD; Martha Storandt, PhD; Nigel J. Cairns, PhD; John C. Morris, MD [http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/64/4/535 Clinical and Psychometric Distinction of Frontotemporal and Alzheimer Dementias]</ref>

FTLD is the pathological term for the clinical syndrome [[Frontotemporal dementia]], which can be subdivided as follows:<ref>{{cite pmid|20369906}}</ref>
*[[frontotemporal dementia|behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia]] (bvFTLD)
*[[semantic dementia]] (SD)
*[[progressive nonfluent aphasia]] (PNFA)

==Histology==
There are 3 main histological subtypes found at post-mortem:
*FTLD -tau; which is characterised by [[Tau protein|tau]] positive inclusions often referred to as Pick-bodies. Examples of FTLD-tau include; [[Pick's disease]], [[corticobasal degeneration]], [[progressive supranuclear palsy]].
*FTLD-TDP43; which is characterised by [[ubiquitin]] and TDP-43 positive, tau negative, [[FUS]] negative inclusions. The pathological histology of this subtype is so diverse it is subdivided into four subtypes based on the detailed histological findings.
FTLD-TDP43 Type1 presents many long neuritic profiles found in the superficial cortical laminae, very few or no neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, neuronal intranuclear inclusions or glial cytoplasmic inclusions.
FTLD-TDP43 Type2 presents with lots of neuronal and [[Glia cells|glial]] cytoplasmic inclusions in both the upper (superficial) and lower (deep) cortical layers, and lower motor neurons. However neuronal intranuclear inclusions are rare or absent.
FTLD-TDP43 Type3 presents with many small neurites and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the upper (superficial) cortical layers. Bar-like neuronal intranuclear inclusions can also be seen they are fewer in number. This type is associated with [[C9orf72|C9ORF72]] mutations (see next section).
FTLD-TDP-43 Type4 presents with lots of neuronal intranuclear inclusions and dystrophic neurites, and an unusual absence of inclusions in the [[Hippocampal formation|granual cell layer of the hippocampus]]. Type 4 is associated with VCP mutations.
*FTLD-FUS; which is characterised by [[FUS]] positive cytoplasmic inclusions, intra nuclear inclusions, and neuritic threads. All of which are present in the cortex, [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]], [[Hippocampal formation|hippocampus]], and motor cells of the spinal cord and XIIth [[cranial nerve]].

*Dementia lacking distinctive histology (DLDH) is a rare and controversial entity. New analyses has allowed many cases previously described as DLDH to be reclassified into one of the positively-defined subgroups.

==Genetics==
There have been numerous advances in descriptions of genetic causes of FTLD, and the related disease [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].

*Mutations in the [[Tau protein|Tau]] gene (known as [[MAPT]] or Microtubule Associated Protein Tau) can cause a FTLD presenting with tau pathology (FTLD-tau).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goedert, M., et al | title = Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA encoding an isoform of microtubule-associated protein tau containing four tandem repeats: differential expression of tau protein mRNAs in human brain. | journal = EMBO | year = 1989 | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 393–9 }}</ref> There are over 40 known mutations at present.
*Mutations in the [[Progranulin]] gene (PGRN) can cause a FTLD presenting with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP43). Patients with [[Progranulin]] mutations have type 3 ubiquitin-positive, TDP-43 positive, tau-negative pathology at post-mortem. Progranulin is associated with tumorgenesis when overproduced, however the mutations seen in FTLD-TDP43 produce a haploinsufficiency, meaning that because one of the two [[alleles]] is damaged, only half as much [[Progranulin]] is produced.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cruts, M., et al., | title = Null mutations in progranulin cause ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17q21. | journal = Nature | year = 2006 | volume = 442 | issue = 7105 | pages = 920–4 | doi=10.1038/nature05017 | pmid=16862115}}</ref>
*Mutations in the [[CHMP2B]] gene are associated with a rare behavioural syndrome akin to bvFTLD (mainly in a large Jutland cohort), presenting with a [[Tau protein|tau]] negative, [[TPD-43]] negative, [[FUS]] negative, [[Ubiquitin]] positive pathology.
*Mutations in the [[Valosin-containing protein|VCP]] have been shown to cause a TDP-43 positive FTLD which is associated with the IBMPFD syndrome (inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kimonis, V.E., et al., | title = VCP disease associated with myopathy, Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia: review of a unique disorder. | journal = Biochim Biophys Acta, | year = 2008 | volume = 1782 | issue= 12 | pages= 744–8 }}</ref>
*Mutations in the TDP-43 gene (known as [[TARBP]] or TAR DNA-binding protein) are an exceptionally rare cause of FTLD, despite this protein being present in the pathological inclusions of many cases (FTLD-TDP43).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Borroni, B., et al., | title = TARDBP mutations in frontotemporal lobar degeneration: frequency, clinical features, and disease course | journal = Rejuvenation Res | year = 2010 | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 509–17 }}</ref> However, mutations in TARBP are a more common cause of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], which can present with frontotemporal dementia. Since these instances are not considered a pure FTLD they are not included here.

Mutations in all of the above genes cause a very small fraction of the FTLD spectrum. Most of the cases are sporadic (no known genetic cause).

*A proportion of FTLD-TDP43 [with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]] cases had shown genetic [[Linkage disequilibrium|linkage]] to a region on [[chromosome]] 9 (FTLD-TDP43/Ch9). This linkage has recently been pinned down to the [[C9orf72|C9ORF72]] gene. Two groups published identical findings back-to-back in the journal Neuron in mid-2011, showing that a hexanucleotide repeat expansion of the GGGGCC genetic sequence within an [[intron]] of this gene was responsible. This expansion was found to be present in a large proportion of familial and sporadic cases, particularly in the Finnish population<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dejesus-Hernandez, M., et al., | title = Expanded GGGGCC Hexanucleotide Repeat in Noncoding Region of C9ORF72 Causes Chromosome 9p-Linked FTD and ALS. | journal = Neuron | year = 2011 | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–56 }}</ref>

==Imaging==
For diagnostic purposes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) are applied. They measure either atrophy or reductions in glucose utilization. The three clinical subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia, are characterized by impairments in specific neural networks.<ref name="pmid16327345">{{cite journal

}}</ref> The first subtype with behavioral deficits, frontotemporal dementia, mainly affects a frontomedian network discussed in the context of social cognition. Semantic dementia is mainly related to the inferior temporal poles and amygdalae; brain regions that have been discussed in the context of conceptual knowledge, semantic information processing, and social cognition, whereas progressive nonfluent aphasia affects the whole left frontotemporal network for phonological and syntactical processing.

==Examples==

[[United States]] Senator [[Pete Domenici]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[New Mexico|NM]]) is a known sufferer of FTLD, and the illness is the main reason behind his October 4, 2007 announcement of retirement at the end of his term.
