'''[[Drug abuse]]''' is a major issue in [[Kenya]], especially in the city of [[Mombasa]] and especially among men in their early 20s. Women in Mombasa have held public protests, asking for better enforcement of the laws against narcotics. In Mombasa and [[Kilindini]], there are approximately 40 maskani (meaning location in Swahili) where drug abusers meet to share drugs. The traditional recreational drug of choice is [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], but [[heroin]] injection is becoming increasingly popular. In a survey,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} 70 percent of recreational drug users said they were using heroin.

==Causes==
===Unemployment and low education===
The research estimates Kenya's unemployment rate is at 40%,the 14th-highest among the 200 countries with unemployment figures. With the average Kenyan dropping out of school after 10 years this leaves many youth without productive uses for their time.

===Peer pressure===
[[Peer pressure]] is a major factor contributing towards drug abuse.  Many addicts have admitted that they started using drugs because it was popular among their friends.  There is also a high probability that many of the beach boys are using drugs so that they can be able to face their clients in a smart way.

===Superstition===
A recent study{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} found that many young men used drugs because they believed that ghosts could not haunt the men when they were high.
The [[CIA World Factbook]] indicates<ref name="cia-kenya">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ke.html</ref> that roughly 10% of Kenyans hold religious beliefs indigenous to the area, although it does not document the extent to which these beliefs involve ghosts.

==Effects==
===Crime===
Many people in Mombasa are concerned that if they walk alone they may be mugged by young men whose costly [[Substance dependence|addiction]] has driven them to criminal careers.

===Disease===
[[Needle sharing]] contributes to the spread of [[HIV]] and other infectious diseases in Kenya, as does a phenomenon known as "flashing blood"<ref>{{cite news |first=Gatonya |last=Gathura |publisher=Daily Nation |title=New Scary Trend in Drug Abuse |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/687180/-/uop80t/-/index.html |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref> where a [[heroin]] user will draw blood from himself to [[blood transfusion|inject into a friend's bloodstream]] with the aim of transferring some of the heroin. [[Malnutrition]] increases many users' susceptibility.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Slow economic development===
Drug abuse has slowed [[economic development]] in many parts of Mombasa, helping keep unemployment rates high and economic productivity low even among the users themselves. In addition, high crime rates discourage foreign investment.

===Life expectancy===
Drugs are reducing life expectancy for young people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Because so many young people die of diseases related to drug use, many{{Who|date=February 2010}} are concerned that a [[population pyramid]] shift may leave too few people of working age to support the country's senior citizens.
