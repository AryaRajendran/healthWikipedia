'''Angina pectoris''' – commonly known as '''angina''' – is [[chest pain]] due to [[ischemia]] of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]], generally due to obstruction or spasm of the [[coronary circulation|coronary arteries]].<ref name="urlMerckMedicus : Dorlands Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/thcp_dorlands_content_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/drlnd/one_04/000004934.htm#000004934 |title=MerckMedicus : Dorland's Medical Dictionary |work= |accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> The main cause of Angina pectoris is [[coronary artery disease]], due to [[atherosclerosis]] of the arteries feeding the heart. The term derives from the [[Latin]] ''angina'' ("infection of the throat") from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἀγχόνη'' ''ankhonē'' ("strangling"), and the Latin ''pectus'' ("chest"), and can therefore be translated as "a strangling feeling in the chest".

There is a weak relationship between severity of [[pain]] and degree of oxygen deprivation in the heart muscle (i.e., there can be severe pain with little or no risk of a [[heart attack]], and a heart attack can occur without pain). In some cases Angina can be extremely serious and has been known to cause death. People that suffer from average to severe cases of Angina have an increased percentage of death before the age of 55, usually around 60%.

Worsening ("crescendo") angina attacks, sudden-onset angina at rest, and angina lasting more than 15 minutes are symptoms of ''unstable angina'' (usually grouped with similar conditions as the [[acute coronary syndrome]]). As these may herald [[myocardial infarction]] (a heart attack), they require urgent medical attention and are generally treated as a presumed heart attack.

==Classification==
===Stable angina===
Also known as ''effort angina'', this refers to the more common understanding of angina related to myocardial ischemia. Typical presentations of stable angina is that of chest discomfort and associated symptoms precipitated by some activity (running, walking, etc.) with minimal or non-existent symptoms at rest or with administration of sublingual nitroglycerin.<ref name="Stable"/> Symptoms typically abate several minutes following cessation of precipitating activities and reoccur when activity resumes. In this way, stable angina may be thought of as being similar to [[intermittent claudication]] symptoms.

===Unstable angina===
Unstable angina (UA) (also "crescendo angina;" this is a form of [[acute coronary syndrome]]) is defined as angina pectoris that changes or worsens.<ref name="urlMerckMedicus : Dorlands Medical Dictionary">{{cite web |url=http://merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/thcp_dorlands_content_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/drlnd/one_04/000004949.htm#000004949 |title=MerckMedicus : Dorland's Medical Dictionary |work= |accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref>

It has at least one of these three features:
# it occurs at rest (or with minimal exertion), usually lasting >10 min;
# it is severe and of new onset (i.e., within the prior 4–6 weeks); and/or
# it occurs with a crescendo pattern (i.e., distinctly more severe, prolonged, or frequent than before).

UA may occur unpredictably at rest which may be a serious indicator of an impending heart attack. What differentiates stable angina from unstable angina (other than symptoms) is the pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of unstable angina is the reduction of coronary flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, coronary artery spasms or coronary thrombosis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/9.suppl_N.40 |title=Pathophysiology of unstable angina pectoris—correlations with coronary angioscopic imaging |year=1988 |last1=Hombach |first1=V. |last2=Hoher |first2=M. |last3=Kochs |first3=M. |last4=Eggeling |first4=T. |last5=Schmidt |first5=A. |last6=Hopp |first6=H.

In stable angina, the developing [[atheroma]] is protected with a fibrous cap. This cap (atherosclerotic plaque) may rupture in unstable angina, allowing blood clots to precipitate and further decrease the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the coronary vessel. This explains why an unstable angina appears to be independent of activity.{{fact|date=February 2013}}

===Microvascular angina===
Microvascular Angina or Angina Syndrome X is characterized by angina-like chest pain, but has different causes. The cause of Microvascular Angina is unknown, but it appears to be the result of poor function in the tiny blood vessels of the heart, arms and legs.<ref>Guyton, Arthur. "Textbook of Medical Physiology" 11th edition. Philadelphia; Elsevier, 2006.{{pn|date=February 2013}}</ref> Since microvascular angina isn't characterized by arterial blockages, it's harder to recognize and diagnose, but its prognosis is excellent.<ref>{{cite web

==Signs and symptoms==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=February 2013}}
Most patients with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the [[epigastrium]] (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders.  This is explained by the concept of [[referred pain]], and is due to the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receiving cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's [[dermatomes|dermatome]], without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for [[referred pain]] are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as [[Precordial catch syndrome]]).

Myocardial [[ischemia]] comes about when the myocardia (the heart muscles) receive insufficient blood and oxygen to function normally either because of increased oxygen demand by the myocardia or by decreased supply to the myocardia. This inadequate [[perfusion]] of blood and the resulting reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients is directly correlated to blocked or narrowed blood vessels.

Some experience "autonomic symptoms" (related to increased activity of the [[autonomic nervous system]]) such as [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] and [[pallor]].

Major risk factors for angina include [[tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[sedentary lifestyle]] and [[family history (medicine)|family history]] of premature heart disease.

A variant form of angina ([[Prinzmetal's angina]]) occurs in patients with normal coronary arteries or insignificant atherosclerosis. It is thought to be caused by spasms of the artery. It occurs more in younger women.

One study found that [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] with coronary artery disease had a significantly increased level of [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic nerve]] activity when compared to those without. This is in addition to increases in blood pressure, heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance associated with nicotine which may lead to recurrent angina attacks.  Additionally, CDC reports that the risk of CHD (Coronary heart disease), stroke, and PVD (Peripheral vascular disease) is reduced within 1–2 years of smoking cessation. In another study, it was found that after one year, the prevalence of angina in smoking men under 60 after an initial attack was 40% less in those who had quit smoking compared to those who continued.  Studies have found that there are short term and long term benefits to smoking cessation.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Health Benefits of Cessation |url=http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm |date=January 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.291.6500.935 |title=Does stopping smoking delay onset of angina after infarction? |year=1985 |last1=Daly |first1=L E |last2=Graham |first2=I M |last3=Hickey |first3=N |last4=Mulcahy |first4=R |journal=BMJ |volume=291 |issue=6500 |pages=935–7 |pmid=3929970 |pmc=1417185}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.287.6388.324 |title=Long term effect on mortality of stopping smoking after unstable angina and myocardial infarction |year=1983 |last1=Daly |first1=L E |last2=Mulcahy |first2=R |last3=Graham |first3=I M |last4=Hickey |first4=N |journal=BMJ |volume=287 |issue=6388 |pages=324–6 |pmid=6409291 |pmc=1548591}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1536/ihj.49.261 |title= Cigarette Smoking Augments Sympathetic Nerve Activity in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease |year= 2008 |last1= Shinozaki |first1= Norihiko |last2= Yuasa |first2= Toyoshi |last3= Takata |first3= Shigeo |journal= International Heart Journal |volume= 49 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–72 |pmid= 18612184}}</ref>

[[Atherosclerosis]] is the most common cause of [[stenosis]] (narrowing of the blood vessels) of the heart's arteries and, hence, angina pectoris. Some people with chest pain have normal or minimal narrowing of heart arteries; in these patients, [[vasospasm]] is a more likely cause for the pain, sometimes in the context of [[Prinzmetal's angina]] and [[Cardiac syndrome X|syndrome X]].

Myocardial ischemia also can be the result of factors affecting blood composition, such as reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of [[blood]], as seen with severe [[anemia]] (low number of red blood cells), or long-term [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

==Pathophysiology==
Angina results when there is an imbalance between the heart's oxygen demand and supply. This imbalance can result from an increase in demand (e.g. during exercise) without a proportional increase in supply (e.g. due to obstruction or atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries).

==Diagnosis==

Suspect angina in people presenting with tight, dull, or heavy chest discomfort which is:<ref name="cks.nhs.uk">NHS Clinical Knowledge Summaries (2009) Angina - stable. [http://www.cks.nhs.uk/angina] Date site accessed: 04/01/2009</ref>

# Retrosternal or left-sided, radiating to the left arm, neck, jaw, or back.
# Associated with exertion or emotional stress and relieved within several minutes by rest.
# Precipitated by cold weather or a meal.

Some people present with atypical symptoms, including breathlessness, nausea, or epigastric discomfort or burping.
These atypical symptoms are particularly likely in older people, women, and those with diabetes.<ref name="cks.nhs.uk"/>

Angina pain is not usually sharp or stabbing or influenced by respiration. Anti-acids and simple analgesia do not usually relieve the pain. If chest discomfort (of whatever site) is precipitated by exertion, relieved by rest, and relieved by glyceryl trinitrate, the likelihood of angina is increased.<ref name="cks.nhs.uk"/>

In angina patients who are momentarily not feeling any one chest pain, an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) is typically normal, unless there have been other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression or elevation of the [[Electrocardiogram#ST segment|ST segment]] may be observed. To elicit these changes, an [[Cardiac stress test|exercise ECG test]] ("treadmill test") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to their maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness or, importantly, pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1&nbsp;mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead us to some conclusion regarding the angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischaemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, particularly a drop in systolic pressure), dysrhythmia and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a [[Cardiac stress test|thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram]] (in patients who cannot exercise enough for the purposes of the treadmill tests, e.g., due to [[asthma]] or [[arthritis]] or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or Stress [[Echocardiography]].

In patients in whom such noninvasive testing is diagnostic, a [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiogram]] is typically performed to identify the nature of the coronary lesion, and whether this would be a candidate for [[angioplasty]], [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass graft]] (CABG), treatment only with medication, or other treatments. There has been research which concludes that a frequency is attained when there is increase in the blood pressure and the pulse rate. This frequency varies normally but the range is 45–50&nbsp;kHz for the cardiac arrest or for the heart failure.{{clarify|date=February 2012}} In patients who are in hospital with unstable angina (or the newer term of "high risk acute coronary syndromes"), those with resting ischaemic ECG changes or those with raised cardiac enzymes such as [[troponin]] may undergo coronary angiography directly.

==Treatment==
The most specific medicine to treat angina is [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerin]].  It is a potent [[vasodilator]] that makes more oxygen available to the heart muscle.  [[Beta-blocker]]s and [[calcium channel blocker]]s act to decrease the heart's workload, and thus its requirement for oxygen.  Nitroglycerin should not be given if certain inhibitors such as [[Sildenafil]] (Viagra), [[Tadalafil]] (Cialis), or [[Vardenafil]] (Levitra) have been taken within the previous 12 hours as the combination of the two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure. Treatments are [[balloon angioplasty]], in which the balloon is inserted at the end of a [[catheter]] and inflated to widen the [[arterial lumen]].  [[Stent]]s to maintain the arterial widening are often used at the same time.  [[Coronary bypass surgery]] involves bypassing constricted arteries with venous grafts.  This is much more invasive than [[angioplasty]].

The main goals of treatment in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing progression of the disease, and reduction of future events, especially [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and [[death]].  Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have a large body of evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitroglycerin]] medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina.<ref>{{cite book |isbn=978-0-471-89980-8 |last1=Sneader |first1=Walter |title=Drug discovery: a history |year=2005}}{{pn|date=February 2013}}</ref> [[Calcium channel blocker]]s (such as [[nifedipine]] (Adalat) and [[amlodipine]]), [[isosorbide mononitrate]] and [[nicorandil]] are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: [[ivabradine]] provides pure heart rate reduction<ref name="pmid16451297">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2006.00817.x |title=Ivabradine - the first selective sinus node if channel inhibitor in the treatment of stable angina |year=2006 |last1=Sulfi |first1=S. |last2=Timmis |first2=A.

[[ACE inhibitor]]s are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit and, lastly, [[statins]] are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. Low-dose [[aspirin]] decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was previously part of standard treatment; however, it has since been discovered that the increase in [[haemorrhagic stroke]] and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets this gain so they are no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.<ref name="pmid20410163">{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.c1805 |title=Don't use aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease |year=2010 |last1=Barnett |first1=H. |last2=Burrill |first2=P. |last3=Iheanacho |first3=I. |journal=BMJ |volume=340 |pages=c1805 |pmid=20410163}}</ref>

Exercise is also a very good long term treatment for the angina (but only particular regimens - gentle and sustained exercise rather than intense short bursts),<ref name="pmid8339420">{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.88.2.572 |title=Exercise conditioning in older coronary patients.

Identifying and treating risk factors for further coronary heart disease is a priority in patients with angina. This means testing for [[hypercholesterolemia|elevated cholesterol]] and other fats in the blood, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), and encouraging [[smoking cessation]] and [[weight loss|weight optimisation]].

=== Suspected angina ===
Hospital admission for people with the following symptoms, as they may have unstable angina: Pain at rest (which may occur at night), pain on minimal exertion, angina that seems to be progressing rapidly despite increasing medical treatment.
Refer urgently all people with suspected angina to a chest pain evaluation service, for confirmation of the diagnosis and assessment of the severity of coronary heart disease.<ref>NHS Clinical Knowledge Summaries (2009) Angina - stable: suspected angina [http://www.cks.nhs.uk/angina/management/quick_answers/scenario_suspected_angina Suspected angina] Date site accessed: 04/01/2009</ref>

==Epidemiology==
Roughly 10.2 million Americans are estimated to experience angina with approximately 500,000 new cases occurring each year.<ref name="Stable">{{cite journal |first1=Kenneth J. |last1=Tobin |title=Stable Angina Pectoris: What Does the Current Clinical Evidence Tell Us? |journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |pmid=20693568 |url=http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=20693568 |year=2010 |volume=110 |issue=7 |pages=364–70}}</ref> Angina is more often the presenting symptom of coronary artery disease in women than in men. The prevalence of angina rises with increasing age, with a mean age of onset of 62.3 years.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b3058 |title=Five year prognosis in patients with angina identified in primary care: Incident cohort study |year=2009 |last1=Buckley |first1=B.

Men with angina were found to have an increased risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease related death than women. Similar figures apply in the remainder of the Western world. All forms of coronary heart disease are much less-common in the [[Third World]], as its risk factors are much more common in Western and Westernized countries; it could therefore be termed a [[Diseases of affluence|disease of affluence]]. The adoption of a rich, Westernized diet and subsequent increase of [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], [[obesity]] and other risk factors, as chronicled in [[The China Study]], has already led to an increase in angina and related diseases in countries such as [[China]].

Recently, angina was tied to exposure of [[Bisphenol-A]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.300.11.1303 |title=Association of Urinary Bisphenol a Concentration with Medical Disorders and Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults |year=2008 |last1=Lang |first1=Iain A. |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=11 |pages=1303–10 |pmid=18799442 |last2=Galloway |first2=TS |last3=Scarlett |first3=A |last4=Henley |first4=WE |last5=Depledge |first5=M |last6=Wallace |first6=RB |last7=Melzer |first7=D}}</ref> among adults in the US.

==History==
The concept of ''Hritshoola''—literally heart pain—was known to [[Sushruta]] (6th century BCE).<ref name=Dwivedi&Dwivedi07/>  Dwivedi & Dwivedi (2007)—on the condition described by Sushruta—hold that: 'It embodies all the essential components of present day definition, i.e. site, nature, aggravating and relieving factors and referral. According to him angina is chest pain which is precordial, temporary, exertional, emotional, burning like and relieved by rest. He also linked this kind of pain to obesity (medoroga).'<ref name=Dwivedi&Dwivedi07>{{cite journal |last1=Dwivedi |first1=Girish |last2=Dwivedi |first2=Shridhar |year=2007 |url=http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf |title=Sushruta – the Clinician – Teacher par Excellence |journal=The Indian Journal of Chest Diseases and Allied Sciences |volume=49 |pages=243–4}}</ref>
