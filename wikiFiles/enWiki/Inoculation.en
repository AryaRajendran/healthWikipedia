'''Inoculation''' is the placement of something that will grow or reproduce, and is most commonly used in respect of the introduction of a [[blood serum|serum]], [[vaccine]], or [[antigen]]ic substance into the body of a human or animal, especially to produce or boost immunity to a specific disease. It can also be used to refer to the communication of a disease to a living organism by transferring its causative agent into the organism, the implanting of microorganisms or infectious material into a culture medium such as a brewers vat or a petri dish, or the placement of microorganisms or viruses at a site where infection is possible. The verb ''to inoculate'' is from Middle English ''inoculaten'', which meant "to [[Grafting|graft]] a scion" (a plant part to be grafted onto another plant); which in turn is from Latin ''inoculare'', past participle ''inoculat-''.<ref>http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/i/i0154600.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.mimi.hu/gardening/inoculation.html |title=Inoculation entry at Gardening section of mimi.hu |publisher=En.mimi.hu |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref>

This article covers '''variolation''', inoculation as a method of purposefully [[infection|infecting]] a person with [[smallpox]] (Variola) in a controlled manner so as to minimise the severity of the infection and also to induce [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] against further infection. See [[vaccination]] for post-variolation methods of
safeguarding as if by inoculation by administering weakened or dead pathogens to a healthy person or animal with the intent of conferring immunity against a targeted form of a related disease agent.

Today the terms ''inoculation'', ''vaccination'' and ''[[immunization]]'' are used more or less interchangeably and popularly refer to the process of [[artificial induction of immunity]] against various infectious [[disease]]s. The microorganism used in an inoculation is called the '''inoculant''' or '''inoculum'''.

<blockquote>
They lay it down as a principle, that the immediate cause of the smallpox exists in the mortal part of every human and animal form; that the mediate (or second) ''acting'' cause, which stirs up the first, and throws it into a state of fermentation, is multitudes of imperceptible animalculae floating in the atmosphere; that these are the cause of all epidemical diseases, but more particularly of the small pox.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holwell|first=John Zephaniah|title=An account of the manner of inoculating for the small pox in the East Indies|location=London|year=1767|oclc=181708667}}</ref>

===China===
The British historian [[Joseph Needham]] and the American historian [[Robert K. G. Temple|Robert Temple]] write that the practice of inoculation for smallpox began in China during the 10th century.<ref>Temple, Robert. (1986).

(1999). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 6, Biology and Biological Technology, Part 6, Medicine''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Page 154</ref>

The first clear and credible reference to smallpox inoculation in China comes from Wan Quan's (1499&ndash;1582) ''Douzhen xinfa'' (痘疹心法) of 1549, which states that some women unexpectedly menstruate during the procedure, yet his text did not give details on techniques of inoculation.<ref name="needham volume 6 part 6 134"/> Inoculation was first vividly described by Yu Chang in his book ''Yuyi cao'' (寓意草), or ''Notes on My Judgment'', published in 1643.<ref name="temple 1986 137"/> Inoculation was reportedly not widely practised in China until the reign of the [[Longqing Emperor]] (r. 1567&ndash;1572) during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368&ndash;1644), as written by Yu Tianchi in his ''Shadou jijie'' (痧痘集解) of 1727, which he alleges was based on Wang Zhangren's ''Douzhen jinjing lu'' (痘疹金鏡錄) of 1579.<ref name="needham volume 6 part 6 134">Needham, Joseph.

::Method of storing the material. Wrap the scabs carefully in paper and put them into a small container bottle. Cork it tightly so that the activity is not dissipated. The container must not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to carry it for some time on the person so that the scabs dry naturally and slowly. The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken from the patient.

::In winter, the material has ''yang'' potency within it, so it remains active even after being kept from thirty to forty days. But in summer the ''yang'' potency will be lost in approximately twenty days. The best material is that which had not been left too long, for when the ''yang'' potency is abundant it will give a 'take' with nine persons out of ten people—and finally it becomes completely inactive, and will not work at all. In situations where new scabs are rare and the requirement great, it is possible to mix new scabs with the more aged ones, but in this case more of the powder should be blown into the nostril when the inoculation is done.<ref>Temple, Robert. (1986). ''The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention''. With a forward by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. ISBN 0-671-62028-2. Page 136&ndash;137.</ref>

As for other methods used in China, the technique of scratching the skin and putting pox onto the scab seems to have developed later than the first accounts made in China, and possibly came from [[Central Asia]]—according to Temple.<ref name="temple 1986 136"/>

==Importation to the West==
[[Image:Mary Wortley Montagu by Charles Jervas, after 1716.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Wortley Montagu, by [[Charles Jervas]], after 1716]]
The practice was introduced to the west by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] (May 26, 1689 – August 21, 1762).  Lady Montagu's husband, [[Edward Wortley Montagu (politician)|Edward Wortley Montagu]], served as the [[Great Britain|British]] [[ambassador]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1716 to 1718.  She witnessed firsthand the Turkish use of inoculation in [[Istanbul]],<ref name="Vallely">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-islamic-inventors-changed-the-world-469452.html|title=How Islamic inventors changed the world|date=11 March 2008|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=17 February 2012|location=London}}</ref> and was greatly impressed:<ref>Donald R.

When a smallpox epidemic threatened England in 1721, she called on her physician to inoculate her daughter. She invited friends to see her daughter, including [[Sir Hans Sloane]], the [[George I of Great Britain|King]]'s physician. Sufficient interest arose that Maitland gained permission to test inoculation at [[Newgate prison]] in exchange for their freedom on six prisoners due to be hanged, an experiment which was witnessed by a number of notable doctors. <ref>{{cite book

The practice of inoculation slowly spread amongst the royal families of Europe, usually followed by more general adoption amongst the people.

The practice is documented in America as early as 1721, when [[Zabdiel Boylston]], at the urging of [[Cotton Mather]], successfully inoculated two slaves and his own son. Mather, a prominent [[Boston]] minister, had heard a description of the African practice of inoculation from his Sudanese slave, [[Onesimus (disambiguation)|Onesimus]], in 1706, but had been previously unable to convince local physicians to attempt the procedure.<ref>Silverman, Kenneth. ''The Life and Times of Cotton Mather'', Harper & Row, New York, 1984. ISBN 0-06-015231-1,  p. 339.</ref> Following this initial success, Boylston began performing inoculations throughout Boston, despite much controversy and at least one attempt upon his life. The effectiveness of the procedure was proven when, of the nearly three hundred people Boylston inoculated during the outbreak, only six died, whereas the mortality rate among those who contracted the disease naturally was one in six.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = D.

There he published his results and was elected to the Royal Society in 1726.

In [[France]], considerable opposition arose to the introduction of inoculation.  [[Voltaire]], in his ''Lettres Philosophiques'', wrote a criticism of his countrymen for being opposed to inoculation and having so little regard for the welfare of their children, concluding that "had inoculation been practised in France it would have saved the lives of thousands.".<ref>Lettres Philosophiques.  Voltaire.  (English translation on-line [http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/11.html])</ref>

Inoculation grew in popularity in Europe through the 18th century. Given the high prevalence and often severe consequences of smallpox in Europe in the 18th century (according to Voltaire, there was a 60% incidence of first infection, a 20% mortality rate, and a 20% incidence of severe scarring),<ref>In fact, the mortality rate of the ''Varoiola Minor'' form of smallpox then found in Europe was 1–3% as opposed to 30–50% for the ''Variola Major'' type found elsewhere; however, blindness, infertility, and severe scarring were common.  Figures from "The Search for Immunisation", ''In Our Time'', BBC Radio 4 (2006). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20060420.shtml]</ref> many parents felt that the benefits of inoculation outweighed the risks and so inoculated their children.<ref>Letter of Lady Montagu reproduced at http://www.foundersofscience.net/lady_mary_montagu.htm viewed 18 March 2006</ref>

== Mechanism ==
Two forms of the disease of Smallpox were recognised, now known to be due to two strains of the Variola virus.  Those contracting Variola Minor had a greatly reduced risk of death &ndash; 1&ndash;2% &ndash; compared to those contracting Variola Major with 30% mortality.  Infection via inhaled viral particles in droplets spread the infection more widely than the deliberate infection through a small skin wound.  The smaller, localised infection is adequate to stimulate the immune system to produce specific immunity to the virus, while requiring more generations of the virus to reach levels of infection likely to kill the patient.  The rising immunity terminates the infection.  So the twofold effect is to ensure the less fatal form of the disease is the one caught, and to give the immune system  the best start possible in combating it. 

Inoculation in the East was historically performed by blowing smallpox crusts into the nostril. In Britain, Europe and the American Colonies the preferred method was rubbing material from a smallpox pustule from a selected mild case (''Variola minor'') into a scratch between the thumb and forefinger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/smallpox/sp_variolation.html |title=Smallpox: Variolation |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2003-10-18 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref>  This would generally be performed when an individual was in normal good health, and thus at peak resistance.  The recipient would develop smallpox; however, due to being introduced through the skin rather than the lungs, and possibly because of the inoculated individual's preexisting state of good health, the small inoculum, and the single point of initial infection, the resulting case of smallpox was generally milder than the naturally-occurring form, produced far less facial scarring, and had a far lower [[mortality rate]]. As with survivors of the natural disease, the inoculated individual was subsequently immune to re-infection.

== Supplanted by vaccination ==

[[File:Inoculation day 16.png|thumb|Comparison of smallpox (left) and cowpox (right) inoculations 16 days after administration]]
In 1796, the [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist [[Edward Jenner]] published the results of his experiments and thus introduced the far superior and safer method of inoculation with the [[cowpox]] virus, a non-fatal virus that also induced [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to smallpox. Jenner was not the first person to inoculate with cowpox, nor was he the first to realize that infection with cowpox gave immunity to smallpox.  His efforts led to smallpox inoculation falling into disuse and eventually being banned in England in 1840.<ref name="Wolfe2002">{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Robert M|coauthors=Sharp, Lisa K|date=24 August 2002|title=Anti-vaccinationists past and present|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|location=London|page=325|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430.full.pdf|pmid=12193361|pmc=1123944|volume=325|issue=7361}}</ref>
