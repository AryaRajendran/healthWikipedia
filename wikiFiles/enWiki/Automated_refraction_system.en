An '''automated refraction system''' is a group of ophthalmic devices used during an [[eye examination]] to aid in the determination of a person's [[Refraction error|refractive error]] and [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] for [[glasses]] or [[contact lenses]].  

The standard components of an '''automated refraction system''' are: 

* an electronic and motor driven [[phoropter]] (auto-phoropter, auto-refractor head) used to present powered [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] in front of the patient's eyes, 
* a hardware or software-driven controller that changes the lenses in the phoroptor for the subjective portion of the testing. A lens and prism system can also be used.
* an [[eye chart]] to aid in the determination of [[visual acuity]] during the test,
* an [[autorefractor]] that measures the patient's objective refractive error, normally used as the starting point of the subjective testing,
* an autolensmeter that measures the powers of the patient's current pair of glasses or contact lenses.

'''Automated refraction systems''' currently on the market vary in features, level of automation, ease of use, training required and documentation.  Some systems contain automatic detection and compensation of common refraction issues such as [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] and "over-minusing".  An automated refraction is quick and painless.  

Some advantages of '''automated refraction systems''' vs. manual refraction equipment are: 

* less manual labour by the practitioner or technician
* more automation of repetitive and iterative tasks in the refraction
* ability to present former and new values quickly for validation
* reduced risk of human error
* direct transmission of results to [[Electronic Medical Record]] (EMR) software - see [[paperless office]]
* improved office efficiency
