'''Hypercholesterolemia''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|also spelled]] '''hypercholesterolaemia''') is the presence of high levels of [[cholesterol]] in the blood.<ref name=Durrington>{{cite journal|last=Durrington|first=P|title=Dyslipidaemia|journal=[[The Lancet]]|volume=362|issue=9385|pages=717–31|year=2003 |month=August |pmid=12957096|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1|url=}}</ref> It is a form of "[[hyperlipidemia]]" (elevated levels of [[lipid]]s in the blood) and "hyperlipoproteinemia" (elevated levels of [[lipoprotein]]s in the blood).<ref name=Durrington/>

Cholesterol is a [[sterol]], a sort of [[fat]]; see the diagrammatic structure at the right. It is one of three major classes of [[lipid]]s which all animal cells utilize to construct their membranes and is thus manufactured by all animal cells. Plant cells do not manufacture cholesterol. It is also the precursor of the [[steroid hormone]]s, [[bile acid]]s and [[vitamin D]].

Since cholesterol is insoluble in water, it is transported in the blood plasma within protein particles ([[lipoproteins]]). Lipoproteins are classified by their density: [[very low density lipoprotein]] (VLDL), [[intermediate density lipoprotein]] (IDL), [[low density lipoprotein]] (LDL) and [[high density lipoprotein]] (HDL).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Biggerstaff KD, Wooten JS |title=Understanding lipoproteins as transporters of cholesterol and other lipids |journal=Adv Physiol Educ |volume=28 |issue=1-4 |pages=105–6 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15319192 |doi=10.1152/advan.00048.2003 |url=}}</ref> All the lipoproteins carry cholesterol, but elevated levels of the lipoproteins other than HDL (termed non-HDL cholesterol), particularly LDL-cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of [[atherosclerosis]] and [[coronary heart disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carmena R, Duriez P, Fruchart JC |title=Atherogenic lipoprotein particles in atherosclerosis |journal=Circulation |volume=109 |issue=23 Suppl 1 |pages=III2–7 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15198959 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000131511.50734.44 |url=}}</ref> In contrast higher levels of HDL cholesterol are protective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kontush A, Chapman MJ |title=Antiatherogenic small, dense HDL--guardian angel of the arterial wall? |journal=Nat Clin Pract Cardiovasc Med |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=144–53 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16505860 |doi=10.1038/ncpcardio0500 |url=}}</ref>  Elevated levels of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL in the blood may be a consequence of [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[obesity]], inherited (genetic) diseases (such as [[LDL receptor]] mutations in [[familial hypercholesterolemia]]), or the presence of other diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[hypothyroidism|an underactive thyroid]].<ref name=Durrington/>

Although hypercholesterolemia itself is [[asymptomatic]], longstanding elevation of serum cholesterol can lead to [[atherosclerosis]].<ref name="BMJ2008">{{cite journal |author=Bhatnagar D, Soran H, Durrington PN |title=Hypercholesterolaemia and its management |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |issue= |pages=a993 |year=2008 |pmid=18719012 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.a993|url=}}</ref> Over a period of decades, chronically elevated serum cholesterol contributes to formation of [[atheroma|atheromatous plaques]] in the arteries.

If the development of the stenosis or occlusion is gradual blood supply to the tissues and organs slowly diminishes until organ function becomes impaired. At this point that tissue [[ischemia]] (restriction in blood supply) may manifest as specific [[symptom]]s. For example, temporary ischemia of the brain (commonly referred to as a [[transient ischemic attack]]) may manifest as temporary loss of vision, [[dizziness]] and impairment of [[equilibrioception|balance]], [[aphasia]] (difficulty speaking), [[paresis]] (weakness) and [[paresthesia]] (numbness or tingling), usually on one side of the body. Insufficient blood supply to the heart may manifest as [[angina pectoris|chest pain]], and ischemia of the eye may manifest as [[amaurosis fugax|transient visual loss in one eye]]. Insufficient blood supply to the legs may manifest as [[claudication|calf pain when walking]], while in the intestines it may present as [[Abdominal angina|abdominal pain after eating a meal]].<ref name=Durrington/><ref name=Grundy1998>{{cite journal |last1=Grundy |first1=SM |last2=Balady |first2=GJ |last3=Criqui|first3=MH |last5=Greenland |first5=P |last6=Hiratzka |first6=LF |last7=Houston-Miller |first7=N |last8=Kris-Etherton |first8=P |last9=Krumholz |first9=HM |title=Primary prevention of coronary heart disease: guidance from Framingham: a statement for healthcare professionals from the AHA Task Force on Risk Reduction.

==Causes==
Hypercholesterolemia is typically due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors.<ref name="BMJ2008"/> Environmental factors include [[obesity]] and [[dietary]] choices.<ref name=BMJ2008/> Genetic contributions are usually due to the additive effects of multiple genes, though occasionally may be due to a single gene defect such as in the case of [[familial hypercholesterolaemia]].<ref name=BMJ2008/> A number of secondary causes exist including: [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], [[obesity]], [[alcohol]], [[monoclonal gammopathy]], [[dialysis]], [[nephrotic syndrome]], [[obstructive jaundice]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[Cushing’s syndrome]], [[anorexia nervosa]], medications ([[thiazide diuretics]], [[ciclosporin]], [[glucocorticoids]], [[beta blockers]], [[retinoic acid]]).<ref name=BMJ2008/>

===Diet===

The bag on the left was obtained from a donor with hypercholesterolemia, and contains cloudy yellow fluid, while the bag obtained from a normal donor contains clear yellow fluid.|Two bags of [[fresh frozen plasma]].

Maintaining a healthy body weight through increased physical activity and appropriate caloric intake is also important. Overweight or obese individuals can  lower blood cholesterol by losing weight - on average a kilogram of weight loss can reduce LDL cholesterol by 0.8&nbsp;mg/dL.<ref name =Ito2011/>

===Genetics===
Genetic abnormalities are in some cases completely responsible for hypercholesterolemia, such as in familial hypercholesterolemia where there is one or more [[genetic mutation]]s in, for example, the [[LDL receptor]].

Even when there is no single responsible mutation to explain hypercholesterolemia, genetic predisposition still plays a major role, potentially adding to lifestyle factors and multiplying the risk of late complications. Multiple genes are involved, and hypercholesterolemia where there is probably a genetic predisposition is called ''polygenic hypercholesterolemia''. The involved genes have yet to be discovered.<ref name=Citko2010>{{cite web |title=Polygenic Hypercholesterolemia |author=Citkowitz E, Isley WL |year=2010 |work=eMedicine |publisher=[[Medscape]] |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/121424-overview |accessdate=2010-11-04}}</ref>

Cholesterol is measured as milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood in the United States and some other countries. In the United Kingdom, most European countries, and Canada, millimoles per liter of blood (mmol/L) is the measure.<ref name="MayoClinic">[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-blood-cholesterol/DS00178/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis High Cholesterol – Tests and Diagnosis], Mayo Clinic staff. Retrieved 2013-03-09.</ref>

For healthy adults, the UK National Health Service recommends total cholesterol of 5&nbsp;mmol/L or less, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) of 3&nbsp;mmol/L or less. For people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, the recommendation for total cholesterol is 4&nbsp;mmol/L or less, and 2&nbsp;mmol/L or less for LDL.<ref name="NHScholesterol">[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cholesterol/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx Diagnosing High Cholesterol], NHS Choices. Retrieved 2013-03-09.</ref>

In the United States, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute within the National Institutes of Health classifies total cholesterol of less than 200&nbsp;mg/dL as “desirable,” 200 to 239&nbsp;mg/dL as “borderline high,” and 240&nbsp;mg/dL or more as “high.”<ref name="NHLBIcholesterol">[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atglance.pdf ATP III Guidelines At-A-Glance Quick Desk Reference], National Cholesterol Education Progam. Retrieved 2013-03-09.</ref>

There is not an absolute cutoff between normal and abnormal cholesterol levels and interpretation of values needs to be made in relation to other health conditions and risk factors.

Higher levels of total cholesterol increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease. Levels of LDL or non-HDL cholesterol both predict future coronary heart disease, which is the better predictor is disputed.<ref name = "ESC 2011">{{cite journal |author=Reiner Z, Catapano AL, De Backer G, ''et al.'' |title=ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: the Task Force for the management of dyslipidaemias of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) |journal=Eur.

Levels of fasting [[triglyceride]]s were taken as an indicator of VLDL levels (generally about 45% of fasting triglycerides is composed of VLDL), while LDL was usually estimated by the Friedewald formula:
 
LDL <math>\approx</math> total cholesterol - HDL - (0.2 x fasting triglycerides).  

However, this equation is not valid on non-fasting blood samples or if fasting triglycerides are elevated >4.5&nbsp;mmol/L (> ∼400&nbsp;mg/dL). Recent guidelines have therefore advocated the use of direct methods for measurement of LDL wherever possible.<ref name = "ESC 2011"/>  
It may be useful to measure all lipoprotein subfractions ( [[Very-low-density lipoprotein|VLDL]], [[Intermediate density lipoprotein|IDL]],  [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL]], [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]]) when assessing hypercholesterolemia and measurement of [[apolipoproteins]] and [[lipoprotein (a)]] can also be of value.<ref name = "ESC 2011"/> Genetic screening is now advised if a form of familial hypercholesterolemia is suspected.<ref name = "ESC 2011"/>

===Classification===
{{main|Hyperlipidemia}}
Classically, hypercholesterolemia was categorized by lipoprotein [[electrophoresis]] and the [[hyperlipidemia#Classification|Fredrickson classification]]. Newer methods, such as "lipoprotein subclass analysis" have offered significant improvements in understanding the connection with atherosclerosis progression and clinical consequences.

If the hypercholesterolemia is hereditary ([[familial hypercholesterolemia]]), there is more
often a [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of premature, earlier onset atherosclerosis.

==Screening==
The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) strongly recommends routine screening for men 35 years and older and women 45 years and older for lipid disorders and the treatment of abnormal lipids in people who are at increased risk of coronary heart disease. They also recommend routinely screening men aged 20 to 35 years and women aged 20 to 45 years if they have other risk factors for [[coronary heart disease]].<ref name=Pignone>{{cite web|title=Screening for Lipid Disorders: Recommendations and Rationale|author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspschol.htm|accessdate=2010-11-04}}</ref> In Canada screening is recommended for men 40 and older and women 50 and older.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Genest|first=J|coauthors=Frohlich, J, Fodor, G, McPherson, R, Working Group on Hypercholesterolemia and Other, Dyslipidemias|title=Recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease: summary of the 2003 update|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=2003-10-28|volume=169|issue=9|pages=921–4|pmid=14581310|pmc=219626}}</ref> In those with normal cholesterol levels screening is recommended once every five years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel|first=III)|title=Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) final report|journal=Circulation|date=2002-12-17|volume=106|issue=25|pages=3143–421|pmid=12485966}}</ref> Once people are on a statin further testing provides little benefit except to possibly determine compliance with treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spector|first=R|coauthors=Snapinn, SM|title=Statins for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: the right dose|journal=Pharmacology|year=2011|volume=87|issue=1–2|pages=63–9|pmid=21228612|doi=10.1159/000322999}}</ref>

===Medication===
[[Statins]] (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are commonly used to treat hypercholesterolemia if diet is ineffective. Other agents that may be used include: [[fibrate]]s, [[nicotinic acid]] and [[cholestyramine]].<ref name=NICE67>{{NICE|67|Lipid modification|2008}}</ref> These however are only recommended if statins are not tolerated.<ref name=NICE67/> Statins can reduce total cholesterol by approximately 50% in the majority of people;<ref name = "ESC 2011"/>  effects appear similar regardless of the statin used.<ref name=CMAJ11/> While statins are effective in decreasing mortality in those who have had previous [[cardiovascular disease]], there is debate over whether or not they are effective in those with high cholesterol but no other health problems.<ref name=AIM2010/> One review did not find a mortality benefit in those at high-risk but without prior cardiovascular disease.<ref name=AIM2010>{{cite journal|journal=Arch Intern Med|title=Statins and All-Cause Mortality in High-Risk Primary Prevention: A Meta-analysis of 11 Randomized Controlled Trials Involving 65 229 Participants|year=2010|author=Ray et al|volume=170|issue=12|url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/170/12/1024|accessdate=2010-11-04|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2010.182|pmid=20585067|last2=Seshasai|first2=S.

===Guidelines===
Various clinical practice guidelines have addressed the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The [[American College of Physicians]] has addressed hypercholesterolemia in patients with [[diabetes]].<ref name=pmid15096336>{{cite journal|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-140-8-200404200-00012|author=Snow V, Aronson M, Hornbake E, Mottur-Pilson C, Weiss K|title=Lipid control in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians|journal=Ann Intern Med|volume=140|issue=8|pages=644–9|year=2004|pmid=15096336|url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/140/8/644|accessdate=2010-11-04}}</ref> Their four recommendations are:
# Lipid-lowering therapy should be used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity for all patients (both men and women) with known coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes.
# Statins should be used for primary prevention against macrovascular complications in patients (both men and women) with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors.
# Once lipid-lowering therapy is initiated, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be taking at least moderate doses of a statin (the accompanying evidence report states "simvastatin, 40 mg/d; pravastatin, 40 mg/d; lovastatin, 40 mg/d; atorvastatin, 20 mg/d; or an equivalent dose of another statin").<ref name=pmid15096337>{{cite journal|doi=10.1059/0003-4819-140-8-200404200-00013|last1=Vijan|first1=S|last2=Hayward|first2=RA|last3=American College Of|first3=Physicians|title=Pharmacologic lipid-lowering therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus: background paper for the American College of Physicians|journal=Ann Intern Med|volume=140|issue=8|pages=650–8|year=2004|pmid=15096337|url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/140/8/650|accessdate=2010-11-04}}</ref>
# For those patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking statins, routine monitoring of liver function tests or muscle enzymes is not recommended except in specific circumstances.

The [[National Cholesterol Education Program]] revised their guidelines;<ref name=pmid15358046>{{cite journal|author=Grundy SM, Cleeman JI, Merz CN, Brewer HB, Clark LT, Hunninghake DB, Pasternak RC, Smith SC, Stone NJ|title=Implications of recent clinical trials for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III Guidelines|journal=J Am Coll Cardiol|volume=44|issue=3|pages=720–32|year=2004|pmid=15358046|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2004.07.001|url=}}</ref> however, their 2004 revisions have been criticized for use of nonrandomized, observational data.<ref name=pmid17015870>{{cite journal|last1=Hayward|first1=RA|last2=Hofer|first2=TP|last3=Vijan|first3=S|title=Narrative review: lack of evidence for recommended low-density lipoprotein treatment targets: a solvable problem|journal=Ann Intern Med|volume=145|issue=7|pages=520–30|year=2006|pmid=17015870|url=}}</ref>

In the UK, the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) has made recommendations for the treatment of elevated cholesterol levels, published in 2008.<ref name=NICE67/>

===Alternative medicine===
According to a survey in 2002, [[alternative medicine]] was used in an attempt to treat cholesterol by 1.1% of U.S. adults. Consistent with previous surveys, this one found that the majority of individuals (i.e., 55%) used it in conjunction with [[conventional medicine]].<ref name=NCCAM>{{cite journal |author=Barnes PM, Powell-Griner E, McFann K, Nahin RL |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults: United States, 2002 |journal=Advance Data |issue=343 |date=May 27, 2004 |format=PDF |pages=6–9 |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/report.pdf |accessdate=2010-11-04 |version=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2004/052704.htm }}</ref>
