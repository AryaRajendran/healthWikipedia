[[File:MRSA SEM 9994 lores.jpg|thumb|A colourised [[scanning electron micrograph|SEM]] of '''MRSA''']]
'''[[Methicillin]]-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''''' ('''MRSA''') is a [[bacterium]] responsible for several difficult-to-treat [[infection]]s in humans. It is also called '''oxacillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''''' (ORSA). MRSA is any strain of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' that has developed, through the process of [[natural selection]], [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to [[beta-lactam antibiotics]], which include the [[penicillin]]s ([[methicillin]], [[dicloxacillin]], [[nafcillin]], [[oxacillin]], etc.) and the [[cephalosporin]]s.  Strains unable to resist these antibiotics are classified as methicillin-sensitive ''Staphylococcus aureus'', or MSSA. The [[evolution]] of such resistance does not cause the organism to be more intrinsically virulent than strains of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' that have no antibiotic resistance, but resistance does make MRSA infection more difficult to treat with standard types of antibiotics and thus more dangerous.

MRSA is especially troublesome in hospitals, prisons and nursing homes, where patients with open wounds, invasive devices, and weakened [[immune system]]s are at greater risk of [[nosocomial infection|infection]] than the general public.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Mrsa cyst exploded.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=A ruptured MRSA abscess|A ruptured MRSA [[abscess]]]]
''S. aureus'' most commonly colonizes the [[anterior nares]] (the [[nostrils]]). The rest of the [[respiratory tract]], open wounds, [[intravenous]] [[catheter]]s, and the [[urinary tract]] are also potential sites for infection. Healthy individuals may carry MRSA asymptomatically for periods ranging from a few weeks to many years. Patients with [[Immunodeficiency|compromised]] [[immune system]]s are at a significantly greater risk of symptomatic [[secondary infection]].

In most patients, MRSA can be detected by swabbing the nostrils and isolating the bacteria found inside. Combined with extra sanitary measures for those in contact with infected patients, screening patients admitted to hospitals has been found to be effective in minimizing the spread of MRSA in hospitals in the United States,<ref name="ScienceDaily">Study at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Pittsburgh: {{cite web | url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&article=UPI-1-20070727-15235200-bc-us-infections.xml| title = Science Daily}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref> [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], and the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/Patients/ridbooklet.pdf |title=Unnecessary Deaths: The Human and Financial Costs of Hospital Infections |accessdate=2007-08-05 |edition=2nd.|author=McCaughey B|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070711030535/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/Patients/ridbooklet.pdf |archivedate = July 11, 2007}}</ref>

MRSA may progress substantially within 24–48 hours of initial topical symptoms. After 72 hours, MRSA can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment. The initial presentation of MRSA is small red bumps that resemble pimples, spider bites, or boils; they may be accompanied by fever and, occasionally, rashes. Within a few days, the bumps become larger and more painful; they eventually open into deep, pus-filled boils.<ref name="MayoSymptoms">{{cite web|title=Symptoms |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mrsa/DS00735/DSECTION=symptoms |publisher=Mayo Clinic}}</ref> About 75 percent of community-associated (CA-) MRSA infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively.{{Citation needed|reason=This percent datum needs to be referenced to a source, CDC or otherwise.|date=April 2012}} But some CA-MRSA strains display enhanced [[virulence]], spreading more rapidly and causing illness much more severe than traditional healthcare-associated (HA-) MRSA infections, and they can affect vital organs and lead to widespread infection ([[sepsis]]), [[toxic shock syndrome]], and [[necrotizing]] ("flesh-eating") [[pneumonia]]. This is thought to be due to toxins carried by CA-MRSA strains, such as [[Panton-Valentine leukocidin|PVL]] and [[Phenol-soluble modulin|PSM]], though PVL was recently found not to be a factor in a study by the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID) at the [[NIH]]. It is not known why some healthy people develop CA-MRSA skin infections that are treatable while others infected with the same strain develop severe infections or die.<ref name=NIH11-06-06>{{cite web |title=MRSA Toxin Acquitted: Study Clears Suspected Key to Severe Bacterial Illness |url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2006/staphtoxin.htm |publisher=[[National Institute of Health]] |work=NIH news release |date=2006-11-06}}</ref>

The most common manifestations of CA-MRSA are skin infections, such as [[necrotizing fasciitis]] and [[pyomyositis]] (most commonly found in the tropics), [[necrotizing pneumonia]], [[infective endocarditis]] (which affects the valves of the heart), and bone and joint infections.<ref name="Raygada"/> CA-MRSA often results in abscess formation that requires incision and drainage. Before the spread of MRSA into the community, abscesses were not considered contagious, because it was assumed that infection required violation of skin integrity and the introduction of staphylococci from normal skin colonization. However, newly emerging CA-MRSA is transmissible (similar, but with very important differences) from Hospital-Associated MRSA. CA-MRSA is less likely than other forms of MRSA to cause [[cellulitis]].

=== Hospital patients ===
Many MRSA infections occur in hospitals and healthcare facilities, with a higher incidence rate in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. When infections occur in this manner it is known as healthcare acquired MRSA or HA-MRSA. These Rates of MRSA infection are also increased in hospitalized patients who are treated with [[quinolones]]. Healthcare provider-to-patient transfer is common, especially when healthcare providers move from patient to patient without performing necessary hand-washing techniques between patients.<ref name="Tacconelli-2008"/><ref name="Muto-2003"/>

=== Prison inmates, military recruits, and the homeless ===
Prisons, military barracks, and homeless shelters can be crowded and confined, and poor hygiene practices may proliferate, thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting MRSA.<ref name="cmr"/>  Cases of MRSA in such populations were first reported in the United States, and then in Canada. The earliest reports were made by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) in US state prisons. Subsequently reports of a massive rise in skin and soft tissue infections were reported by the CDC in the [[Los Angeles]] County Jail system in 2001, and this has continued. Pan et al. reported on the changing epidemiology of MRSA skin infection in the [[San Francisco]] County Jail, noting the MRSA accounted for more than 70% of S. aureus infection in the jail by 2002. Lowy and colleagues reported on frequent MRSA skin infections in [[New York]] State Prisons. Two reports on inmates in Maryland have demonstrated frequent colonization with MRSA.

In the news media hundreds of reports of MRSA outbreaks in prisons appeared between 2000 and 2008. For example, in February 2008, The [[Tulsa County]] Jail in the U.S. State of [[Oklahoma]] started treating an average of twelve Staphylococcus cases per month.<ref>[http://www.purebio.com/about/article/48 Staph (MRSA) Infection Eradicated For 14 Months]</ref> A report on skin and soft tissue infections in the [[Cook County]] Jail in [[Chicago]] in 2004–05 demonstrated that MRSA was the most common cause of these infections among cultured lesions and furthermore that few risk factors were more strongly associated with MRSA infections than infections caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. In response to these and many other reports on MRSA infections among incarcerated and recently incarcerated persons, the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] has released guidelines for the management and control of the infections although few studies provide an evidence base for these guidelines.

=== People in contact with live food-producing animals ===
Cases of MRSA have increased in livestock animals. CC398 is a new variant of MRSA that has emerged in animals and is found in intensively reared production animals (primarily pigs, but also cattle and poultry), where it can be transmitted to humans. Though dangerous to humans, CC398 is often asymptomatic in food-producing animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/Report/biohaz_report_301_joint_mrsa_en,0.pdf|title= Joint scientific report of ECDC, EFSA and EMEA on meticillin resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA) in livestock, companion animals and food|date=2009-06-16|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref>

A 2011 study reported 47% of the meat and poultry sold in surveyed U.S. grocery stores was contaminated with S. aureus and, of those, 52%—or 24.4% of the total—were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics. "Now we need to determine what this means in terms of risk to the consumer," said Dr. Keim, a co-author of the paper.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110415083153.htm US meat and poultry is widely contaminated with drug-resistant Staph bacteria, study finds<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Some samples of commercially sold meat products in Japan were also found to harbor MRSA strains.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ogata|first=K|coauthors=Narimatsu, H, Suzuki, M, Higuchi, W, Yamamoto, T, Taniguchi, H|title=Commercially distributed meat as a potential vehicle for community-acquired methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=Applied and environmental microbiology|date=2012-02-03|doi=10.1128/AEM.07470-11|pmid=22307310|volume=78|issue=8|pages=2797–802}}</ref>

MRSA is becoming a major health concern in children because they are more likely to exhibit minor scrapes, cuts, bruises, and bug bites than adults. Children as well as adults are at higher risk of getting MRSA who come in contact with day care centers, playgrounds, locker rooms, camps, dormitories, classrooms and other school settings, and gyms and workout facilities. Parents should be especially cautious of children who participate in activities where there is shared sports equipment such as football helmets and uniforms.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/parenting/mrsa-and-staph-infections-in-children Web MD]</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Muller Hinton agar with MRSA.jpg|thumb|Mueller Hinton agar showing MRSA resistant to oxacillin disk]]

Diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks of MRSA. New rapid techniques for the identification and characterization of MRSA have been developed. This notwithstanding, the bacterium generally must be cultured via blood, urine, [[sputum]], or other body fluid cultures, and cultured in the lab in sufficient quantities to perform these confirmatory tests first. Consequently, there is no quick and easy method to diagnose a MRSA infection. Therefore, initial treatment is often based upon 'strong suspicion' by the treating physician, since any delay in treating this type of infection can have fatal consequences.  These techniques include [[Real-time PCR]] and [[Quantitative PCR]] and are increasingly being employed in clinical laboratories for the rapid detection and identification of MRSA strains.<ref name= FrancoisP>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/staph|author= Francois P and Schrenzel J|year=2008|chapter=Rapid Diagnosis and Typing of ''Staphylococcus aureus''|title=Staphylococcus: Molecular Genetics|publisher=Caister Academic Press| isbn=978-1-904455-29-5}}</ref><ref name=Mackay>{{cite book | author = Mackay I M (editor). | title = Real-Time PCR in Microbiology: From Diagnosis to Characterization | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/rtmic | isbn=978-1-904455-18-9}}</ref>

Another common laboratory test is a rapid [[Agglutination (biology)|latex agglutination]] test that detects the PBP2a protein. PBP2a is a variant [[penicillin-binding protein]] that imparts the ability of S. aureus to be resistant to oxacillin.<ref name=Hardy>{{cite web|title=MRSA latex test for PBP2|first=Denka|last=Seiken|url=http://www.hardydiagnostics.com/catalog2/hugo/MRSALatexTest.htm}}</ref>

== Genetics ==
Antimicrobial resistance is genetically based; resistance is mediated by the acquisition of extrachromosomal genetic elements containing resistance genes. Exemplary are plasmids, transposable genetic elements, and genomic islands, which are transferred between bacteria via [[horizontal gene transfer]].<ref name="jenson">{{cite journal |author=Jensen SO, Lyon BR |title=Genetics of antimicrobial resistance in ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=Future Microbiol |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=565–82 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19492967 |doi=10.2217/fmb.09.30 |url=http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/fmb.09.30?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref> A defining characteristic of MRSA is its ability to thrive in the presence of [[penicillin]]-like antibiotics, which normally prevent bacterial growth by inhibiting synthesis of [[cell wall]] material. This is due to a resistance gene, ''mecA'', which stops β-lactam antibiotics from inactivating the enzymes (transpeptidases) that are critical for cell wall synthesis.

=== ''mecA'' ===
''mecA'' is responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. After acquisition of ''mecA'', the gene must be integrated and localized in the S. aureus chromosome.<ref name="lowy"/> ''mecA'' encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind methicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics.<ref name="lowy"/> As such, PBP2a can continue to catalyze the transpeptidation reaction required for [[peptidoglycan]] cross-linking, enabling cell wall synthesis in the presence of antibiotics. As a consequence of the inability of PBP2a to interact with β-lactam moieties, acquisition of ''mecA'' confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics in addition to methicillin.<ref name="lowy"/><ref>Sahebnasagh R, Saderi H, Owlia P.

Acquisition of SCC''mec'' in methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (''MSSA'') gives rise to a number of genetically different MRSA lineages.

== Prevention==

=== Screening programs ===
Patient screening upon hospital admission, with nasal cultures, prevents the cohabitation of MRSA carriers with non-carriers, and exposure to infected surfaces.  The test used (whether a rapid molecular method or traditional culture) is not as important as the implementation of active screening.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tacconelli E, De Angelis G, de Waure C, Cataldo MA, La Torre G, Cauda R |title=Rapid screening tests for meticillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' at hospital admission: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=546–54 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19695491 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70150-1 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473-3099(09)70150-1}}</ref>
In the United States and Canada, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines on October 19, 2006, citing the need for additional research, but declined to recommend such screening.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/14/opinion/14mccaughey.html "To Catch a Deadly Germ," ''New York Times'' opinion]</ref><ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf CDC Guideline "Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings, 2006"]</ref>

In some UK hospitals screening for MRSA is performed in every patient<ref>http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/latest-york-and-humberside-news/New-checks-in-hospitals-to.5123093.jp</ref> and all NHS surgical patients, except for minor surgeries, are previously checked for MRSA.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7974964.stm | work=BBC News | title=MRSA test for surgical patients | date=2009-03-31 | accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> There is no community screening in the UK; however, screening of individuals is offered by some private companies.<ref>[http://www.mrsatest.co.uk Home Mrsa Test - Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In a US cohort of 1300 healthy children, 2.4% carried MRSA in their nose.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fritz SA, Garbutt J, Elward A, ''et al.''|title=Prevalence of and risk factors for community-acquired methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive ''Staphylococcus aureus'' colonization in children seen in a practice-based research network|volume=121|issue=6|year=2008|pages=1090–8|doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2104|journal=Pediatrics|pmid=18519477}}</ref>

=== Surface sanitizing ===
[[File:ER Terminal cleaning.jpg|thumb|NAV-CO2 sanitizing in Pennsylvania hospital exam room]]

[[Alcohol]] has been proven to be an effective surface sanitizer against MRSA. [[Quaternary ammonium]] can be used in conjunction with alcohol to extend the longevity of the sanitizing action.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The prevention of [[nosocomial infection]]s involves routine and [[terminal cleaning]]. [[NAV-CO2|Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems]] (NAV-CO2) do not corrode metals or plastics used in medical environments and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance.

In healthcare environments, MRSA can survive on surfaces and fabrics, including privacy curtains or garments worn by care providers. Complete surface sanitation is necessary to eliminate MRSA in areas where patients are recovering from invasive procedures. Testing patients for MRSA upon admission, isolating MRSA-positive patients, decolonization of MRSA-positive patients, and [[terminal cleaning]] of patients' rooms and all other clinical areas they occupy is the current best practice protocol for nosocomial MRSA.

Studies published from 2004-2007 reported hydrogen peroxide vapor could be used to decontaminate busy hospital rooms, despite taking significantly longer than traditional cleaning. One study noted rapid recontamination by MRSA following the hydrogen peroxide application<ref>{{cite journal |author=Otter JA, Puchowicz M, Ryan D, ''et al.'' |title=Feasibility of routinely using hydrogen peroxide vapor to decontaminate rooms in a busy United States hospital |journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=574–7 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19415969 |doi=10.1086/597544 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/597544?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bartels MD, Kristoffersen K, Slotsbjerg T, Rohde SM, Lundgren B, Westh H |title=Environmental meticillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA) disinfection using dry-mist-generated hydrogen peroxide |journal=J.

=== Research on copper alloys ===
In 2008, after evaluating a wide body of research mandated specifically by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), registration approvals were granted by EPA in 2008 granting that copper alloys kill more than 99.9% of MRSA within two hours.

Subsequent research conducted at the University of Southampton (UK) compared the antimicrobial efficacies of copper and several non-copper proprietary coating products to kill MRSA.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/media/11996/effect_temp.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02637.x|title=Effects of temperature and humidity on the efficacy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus challenged antimicrobial materials containing silver and copper|year=2009|last1=Michels|first1=H.T.|last2=Noyce|first2=J.O.|last3=Keevil|first3=C.W.|journal=Letters in Applied Microbiology|volume=49|pages=191–5|pmid=19413757|issue=2|pmc=2779462}}</ref><ref>Keevil, C.W., Noyce, J.O. (2007), Antimicrobial Efficacies of Copper, Stainless Steel, Microban, BioCote and AgIon with MRSA at 20 °C, unpublished data</ref> At 20 °C, the drop-off in MRSA organisms on copper alloy C11000 is dramatic and almost complete (over 99.9% kill rate) within 75 minutes. However, neither a triclosan-based product nor two silver-containing based antimicrobial treatments (Ag-A and Ag-B) exhibited any meaningful efficacy against MRSA. Stainless steel S30400 did not exhibit any antimicrobial efficacy.

In 2004, the University of Southampton research team was the first to clearly demonstrate that copper inhibits MRSA.<ref>Noyce, J.O. and Keevil, C.W. (2004), The Antimicrobial Effects of Copper and Copper-Based Alloys on Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', Copper Development Association Poster Q-193 from Proceedings of the Annual General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, 24–27 May 2004, New Orleans; presented at the American Society for Microbiology General Meeting, New Orleans, LA May 24th.</ref> On copper alloys — C19700 (99% copper), C24000 (80% copper), and C77000 (55% copper) — significant reductions in viability were achieved at room temperatures after 1.5 hours, 3.0 hours and 4.5 hours, respectively. Faster antimicrobial efficacies were associated with higher copper alloy content. Stainless steel did not exhibit any bactericidal benefits.

=== Hand washing ===
In September 2004,<ref>{{cite web|title=NPSA - About us|url=http://www.npsa.nhs.uk/cleanyourhands/about-us/}}</ref> after a successful pilot scheme to tackle MRSA, the UK [[National Health Service]] announced its ''Clean Your Hands'' campaign. Wards were required to ensure that [[Hand sanitizer|alcohol-based hand rubs]] are placed near all beds so that staff can hand wash more regularly. It is thought that even if this cuts infection by no more than 1%, the plan will pay for itself many times over.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

As with some other bacteria, MRSA is acquiring more resistance to some [[disinfectant]]s and [[antiseptic]]s. Although alcohol-based rubs remain somewhat effective, a more effective strategy is to wash hands with running water and an anti-microbial cleanser with persistent killing action, such as [[Chlorhexidine]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1128/AAC.00430-07}}</ref> In another study [[chlorohexidine]] (Hibiclens), ''p''-chloro-''m''-xylenol (Acute-Kare), [[hexachlorophene]] (Phisohex), and [[povidone-iodine]] (Betadine) were evaluated for their effectiveness. Of the four most commonly used antiseptics, povidone-iodine, when diluted 1:100, was the most rapidly bactericidal against both MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. ''aureus''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haley CE, Marling-Cason M, Smith JW, Luby JP, Mackowiak PA |title=Bactericidal activity of antiseptics against methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=J. Clin. Microbiol. |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=991–2 |year=1985 |month=June |pmid=4008627 |pmc=271835 |url=http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4008627}}</ref>

A June 2008 report, centered on a survey by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, concluded that poor hygiene habits remain the principal barrier to significant reductions in the spread of MRSA.

=== Use of surgical respirator ===

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced on 8 April 2011 that it had cleared a novel type of N95 Surgical Respirator, the SpectraShield 9500, that kills methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.  This mask is manufactured by [[Nexera Medical]] Ltd. of Richmond, British Columbia  The mask blocks at least 95% of small particles in a standardized test. The FDA clearance also included evaluation by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety <ref>Gever J.Senior Editor, MedPage Today. Germicidal Surgical Mask Approved Published: April 09, 2011 http://www.medpagetoday.com/HospitalBasedMedicine/InfectionControl/25819</ref>

=== Proper disposal of hospital gowns ===
Used paper [[hospital gowns]] are associated with MRSA hospital infections, which could be avoided by proper disposal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE52K1O920090321 | work=Reuters | title=Simple techniques slash hospital infections: meeting | date=2009-03-21}}</ref>

=== Isolation ===
Excluding [[medical facility|medical facilities]], current US guidance does not require workers with MRSA infections to be routinely excluded from the general workplace.<ref name=NIOSH_MRSA>{{cite web|url= http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/mrsa/ |title=NIOSH MRSA and the Workplace |accessdate=2007-10-29|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref> Therefore, unless directed by a health care provider, exclusion from work should be reserved for those with wound drainage that cannot be covered and contained with a clean, dry bandage and for those who cannot maintain good hygiene practices.<ref name=NIOSH_MRSA/> Workers with active infections should be excluded from activities where skin-to-skin contact is likely to occur until their infections are healed. Health care workers should follow the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guidelines for Infection Control in Health Care Personnel.<ref name="cdc1998">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/gl_hcpersonnel.html|title=Guidelines for Infection Control in Health Care Personnel, 1998|accessdate=December 18, 2007|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|year=1998|author=CDC}}</ref>

To prevent the spread of staph or MRSA in the workplace, employers should ensure the availability of adequate facilities and supplies that encourage workers to practice good hygiene; that surface sanitizing in the workplace is followed; and that contaminated equipment are sanitized with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectants.<ref name=NIOSH_MRSA/>

=== Restricting antibiotic use ===
[[Glycopeptides]], [[cephalosporin]]s and in particular [[quinolones]] are associated with an increased risk of colonisation of MRSA. Reducing use of antibiotic classes that promote MRSA colonisation, especially fluoroquinolones, is recommended in current guidelines.<ref name="Tacconelli-2008"/><ref name="Muto-2003">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Muto | first1 = CA. | last2 = Jernigan | first2 = JA. | last3 = Ostrowsky | first3 = BE. | last4 = Richet | first4 = HM. | last5 = Jarvis | first5 = WR. | last6 = Boyce | first6 = JM. | last7 = Farr | first7 = BM. | title = SHEA guideline for preventing nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant strains of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and enterococcus | journal = Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 362–86 | month = May | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1086/502213 | pmid = 12785411 }}</ref>

=== Public health considerations ===
Mathematical models describe one way in which a loss of infection control can occur after measures for screening and isolation seem to be effective for years, as happened in the UK. In the "search and destroy" strategy that was employed by all UK hospitals until the mid-1990s, all patients with MRSA were immediately isolated, and all staff were screened for MRSA and were prevented from working until they had completed a course of eradication therapy that was proven to work. Loss of control occurs because colonised patients are discharged back into the community and then readmitted; when the number of colonised patients in the community reaches a certain threshold, the "search and destroy" strategy is overwhelmed.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Cooper BS, Medley GF, Stone SP, ''et al.'' | title=Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' in hospitals and the community: stealth dynamics and control catastrophes | year=2004 | volume=101 | issue=27 | pages=10223–8 | pmid = 15220470 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0401324101 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pmc=454191 | unused_data=.journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA}}</ref> One of the few countries not to have been overwhelmed by MRSA is the [[Netherlands]]: An important part of the success of the Dutch strategy may have been to attempt eradication of carriage upon discharge from hospital.<ref name="Bootsma2006">{{cite journal | author=Bootsma MC, Diekmann O, Bonten MJ | title=Controlling methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'': quantifying the effects of interventions and rapid diagnostic testing | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | year=2006 | volume=103 | issue=14 | pages=5620–5 | pmid = 16565219 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0510077103 | pmc=1459403}}</ref>

On January 6, 2008, half of 64 non-Chinese cases of MRSA infections in [[Hong Kong]] in 2007 were [[Filipino people|Filipino]] domestic helpers. Ho Pak-leung, professor of microbiology at the [[University of Hong Kong]], traced the cause to high use of antibiotics. In 2007, there were 166 community cases in Hong Kong compared with 8,000 hospital-acquired MRSA case (155 recorded cases—91 involved Chinese locals, 33 Filipinos, 5 each for Americans and Indians, and 2 each from Nepal, Australia, Denmark and England).<ref>[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=110923 Inquirer.net, Cases of RP maids with 'superbug' infection growing in HK]</ref>

One possible contribution to the increased spread of MRSA infections comes from the use of antibiotics in [[intensive pig farming]]. A 2008 study in Canada found MRSA in 10% of tested pork chops and ground pork; a U.S. study in the same year found MRSA in the noses of 70% of the tested farm pigs and in 45% of the tested pig farm workers.<ref>[http://blog.seattlepi.com/secretingredients/archives/140336.asp First study finds MRSA in U.S. pigs and farmers], ''seattlepi.com'', 4 June 2008</ref> There have also been anecdotal reports of increased MRSA infection rates in rural communities with pig farms.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/opinion/12kristof.html?_r=1 Our Pigs, Our Food, Our Health], ''The New York Times'', 12 March 2009</ref>

Healthcare facilities with high bed occupancy rates, high levels of temporary nursing staff, or low cleanliness scores no longer have significantly higher MRSA rates. Simple tabular evidence helps provide a clear picture of these changes, showing, for instance, that hospitals with occupancy over 90% had, in 2006–2007, MRSA rates little above those in hospitals with occupancy below 85%, in contrast to the period 2001–2004. In one sense, the disappearance of these relationships is puzzling. Reporters now blame IV cannula and catheters for spreading MRSA in hospitals.

=== Decolonization ===
Care should be taken when trying to drain boils, as disruption of surrounding tissue can lead to larger infections, or even infection of the blood stream (often with fatal consequences).<ref name="nih">{{cite web|title=PubMed Health|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004520/|publisher=US National Institutes of Health|accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>  Any drainage should be disposed of very carefully.  After the drainage of boils or other treatment for MRSA, patients can shower at home using [[chlorhexidine]] (Hibiclens) or [[hexachlorophene]] (Phisohex) antiseptic soap (available over-the-counter at many pharmacies) from head to toe. Alternatively, a dilute bleach bath can be taken at a concentration of 1/2 cup bleach per 1/4-full bathtub of water.<ref>{{cite web|title=Optimal Bleach Concentration Required to Kill MRSA in Bath Water|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>   Care should be taken to use a clean towel, and to ensure that nasal discharge doesn't infect the towel (see below).

All infectious lesions should be kept covered with a dressing.<ref name="nih" />   [[Mupirocin]] (Bactroban) 2% ointment can be effective at reducing the size of lesions.  A secondary covering of clothing is preferred.<ref name="tpchd">{{cite web|title=Living With MRSA|url=http://www.tpchd.org/files/library/2357adf2a147d1aa.pdf|publisher=Group Health Cooperative/Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept./Washington State Dept. of Health|accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> As shown in an animal study with diabetic mice, the topical application of a mixture of sugar (70%) and 3% povidone-iodine paste is an effective agent for the treatment of diabetic ulcers with MRSA infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shi CM, Nakao H, Yamazaki M, Tsuboi R, Ogawa H |title=Mixture of sugar and povidone-iodine stimulates healing of MRSA-infected skin ulcers on db/db mice |journal=Arch.

The nose is a common refuge for MRSA, and a test swab can be taken of the nose to indicate whether MRSA is present.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE NOSE – "GROUND ZERO" FOR MRSA COLONIZATION|url=http://mrsatopic.com/2011/01/the-nose-ground-zero-for-mrsa-colonization/|publisher=Ondine Biomedical Inc|accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref>  If MRSA is detected via nasal culture, [[Mupirocin]] (Bactroban) 2% ointment can be applied inside each nostril twice daily for 7 days, using a cotton-tipped swab.  However, care should be taken so that the swab doesn't penetrate into the sinus.  Household members are recommended to follow the same decolonization protocol.  After treatment, the nose should be swabbed again to ensure that the treatment was effective.  If not, the process should be repeated.

Toilet seats are a common vector for infection, and wiping seats clean before and/or after use can help to prevent the spread of MRSA.   Door handles, faucets, light switches (with care!), etc. can be disinfected regularly with disinfectant wipes.<ref name="tpchd" />  Spray disinfectants can be used on upholstery.  Carpets can be washed with disinfectant, and hardwood floors can be scrubbed with diluted tea tree oil (e.g. Melaleuca).  Laundry soap containing tea tree oil may be effective at decontaminating clothing and bedding, especially if hot water and heavy soil cycles are used, however tea tree oil may cause a rash which MRSA can re-colonize.  Alcohol-based sanitizers can be placed near bedsides, near sitting areas, in vehicles etc. to encourage their use.

Doctors may also prescribe antibiotics such as [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]] or [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]].

===Community settings ===
The CDC offers suggestions for preventing the contraction and spread MRSA infection which are applicable to those in community settings, including incarcerated populations, childcare center employees, and athletes.  To prevent MRSA infection, individuals should regularly wash hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer, keep wounds clean and covered, avoid contact with other people's wounds, avoid sharing personal items such as razors or towels, shower after exercising at athletic facilities (including gyms, weight rooms, and school facilities), shower before using swimming pools or whirlpools, and maintain a clean environment.<ref>{{cite web | title = Personal Prevention of MRSA Skin Infections | publisher = CDC | date = 9 August 2010 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/prevent/personal.html}}</ref>

It may be difficult for people to maintain the necessary cleanliness if they do not have access to facilities such as public toilets with handwashing facilities. 
In the United Kingdom, the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/3004/contents/made Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992] requires businesses to provide toilets for their employees, along with washing facilities including soap or other suitable means of cleaning. Guidance on how many toilets to provide and what sort of washing facilities should be provided alongside them is given in the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Approved Code of Practice and Guidance L24, available from [http://www.hsebooks.co.uk Health and Safety Executive Books]. 
But there is no legal obligation on local authorities in the United Kingdom to provide [[public toilets]], and although in 2008 the House of Commons Communities and Local Government Committee called for a duty on local authorities to develop a public toilet strategy [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/636/636.pdf] this was rejected by the Government

== Treatment ==
Both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA are resistant to traditional anti-staphylococcal [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s, such as [[cephalexin]]. CA-MRSA has a greater spectrum of antimicrobial susceptibility, including to [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa drugs]] (like [[co-trimoxazole]]/trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracyclines]] (like [[doxycycline]] and [[minocycline]]) and [[clindamycin]], but the drug of choice for treating CA-MRSA is now believed to be [[vancomycin]], according to a Henry Ford Hospital Study. HA-MRSA is resistant even to these antibiotics and often is susceptible only to vancomycin. Newer drugs, such as [[linezolid]] (belonging to the newer [[oxazolidinones]] class) and [[daptomycin]], are effective against both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA.

In 1959 [[methicillin]]  was licensed in England to treat penicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'' infections. Just as bacterial evolution had allowed microbes to develop resistance to penicillin, strains of ''S. aureus'' evolved to become resistant to methicillin. In 1961 the first MRSA isolates were reported in a British study, and between 1961-1967 there were infrequent hospital outbreaks in Western Europe and Australia.<ref name = "The University of Chicago Medical Center">{{Cite web |url=http://mrsa-research-center.bsd.uchicago.edu/timeline.html |publisher=The University of Chicago Medical Center |title=MRSA History Timeline: The First Half-Century, 1959-2009 |year=2010}}</ref> The first United States hospital outbreak of MRSA occurred at the Boston City Hospital in 1968. Between 1968-mid-1990s the percent of ''S. aureus'' infections that were caused by MRSA increased steadily, and MRSA became recognized as an endemic pathogen.  In 1974 2% of hospital-acquired ''S. aureus'' infections could be attributed to MRSA.<ref name="mrsa-surveillance">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/statistics/MRSA-Surveillance-Summary.html |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=MRSA Surveillance |date=April 8, 2011}}</ref> The rate had increased to 22% by 1995, and by 1997 the percent of hospital ''S. aureus'' infections attributable to MRSA had reached 50%.

The first report of CA-MRSA occurred in 1981, and in 1982 there was a large outbreak of CA-MRSA among intravenous drug users in Detroit, Michigan.<ref name = "The University of Chicago Medical Center"/> Additional outbreaks of CA-MRSA were reported through the 1980s and 1990s, including outbreaks among Australian Aboriginal populations that had never been exposed to hospitals. In the mid-1990s there were scattered reports of CA-MRSA outbreaks among US children. While HA-MRSA rates stabilized between 1998–2008, CA-MRSA rates continued to rise. A report released by The University of Chicago Children's Hospital comparing two time periods (1993–1995 and 1995–1997) found a 25-fold increase in the rate of hospitalizations due to MRSA among children in the United States.<ref>http://mrsa-research-center.bsd.uchicago.edu/JAMA_02_25_1998_issue.pdf</ref> In 1999 The University of Chicago reported the first deaths from invasive MRSA among otherwise healthy children in the United States.<ref name = "The University of Chicago Medical Center"/>  By 2004 MRSA accounted for 64% of hospital-acquired ''S. aureus'' infections in the United States.

The [[Office for National Statistics]] reported 1,629 MRSA-related deaths in England and Wales during 2005, indicating a MRSA-related [[death rate|mortality rate]] half the rate of that in the United States for 2005, even though the figures from the British source were explained to be high because of "improved levels of reporting, possibly brought about by the continued high public profile of the disease"<ref>UK Office for National Statistics Online (February 22, 2007), "[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1067 MRSA Deaths continue to rise in 2005]"</ref> during the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 United Kingdom General Election]].

It has been argued that the observed increased mortality among MRSA-infected patients may be the result of the increased underlying [[morbidity]] of these patients. Several studies, however, including one by Blot and colleagues, that have adjusted for underlying disease still found MRSA bacteremia to have a higher attributable mortality than methicillin-susceptible ''S. aureus'' (MSSA) bacteremia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blot S, Vandewoude K, Hoste E, Colardyn F |title=Outcome and attributable mortality in critically Ill patients with bacteremia involving methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=162 |issue=19 |pages=2229–35 |year=2002 |pmid=12390067 |doi=10.1001/archinte.162.19.2229}}</ref>

According to the CDC, the most recent estimates of the incidence of healthcare-associated infections that are attributable to MRSA in the United States indicate a decline in such infection rates.  Incidence of MRSA central line-associated blood stream infections as reported by hundreds of intensive care units decreased 50-70% from 2001-2007.<ref name="mrsa-surveillance"/> A separate system tracking all hospital MRSA bloodstream infections found an overall 34% decrease between 2005-2008.<ref name="mrsa-surveillance"/>

MRSA is sometimes sub-categorised as community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) or healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA), although the distinction is complex. Some researchers have defined CA-MRSA by the characteristics of patients whom it infects, while others define it by the [[gene]]tic characteristics of the bacteria themselves. By 2005, identified CA-MRSA risk factors included athletes, military recruits, incarcerated people, emergency room patients, urban children, HIV-positive individuals, men who have sex with men, and indigenous populations.<ref name = "The University of Chicago Medical Center"/>

=== Worldwide ===
The first reported cases of CA-MRSA began to appear in the mid-1990s in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Finland, Canada and Samoa, and were notable because they involved people who had not been exposed to a healthcare setting.<ref name="Raygada">{{cite journal |author=Raygada JL and Levine DP |title=Managing CA-MRSA Infections: Current and Emerging Options |journal=Infections in Medicine|volume=26 |issue=2 |date=March 30, 2009 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/infection/article/1145625/1393856}}</ref>

Because measurement and reporting varies, it is difficult to compare rates of MRSA in different countries.  An international comparison of 2004 MRSA-attributable ''S. aureus'' rates in middle and high income countries released by the Center For Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy in showed that Iceland had the lowest rate of infection, and Romania had the highest at over 70%.<ref>[http://www.cddep.org/tools/methicillin_resistant_staphylococcus_aureus_infection_rates_united_states_and_other_countries CDDEP "MRSA Infection Rates by Country" (2004)]</ref>

=== Clinical ===
It has been reported that [[maggot therapy]] to clean out necrotic tissue of MRSA infection has been successful. Studies in diabetic patients reported significantly shorter treatment times than those achieved with standard treatments.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bowling FL, Salgami EV, Boulton AJ |title=Larval therapy: a novel treatment in eliminating methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' from diabetic foot ulcers |journal=Diabetes Care |volume =30 |issue=2 |pages=370–1 |year=2007 |pmid=17259512 |doi=10.2337/dc06-2348}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Maggots help cure MRSA patients | publisher = BBC News |date=2007-05-02 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/6614471.stm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Maggots rid patients of MRSA |date=2007-05-03 | publisher=EurekAlert!/AAAS | url =http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-05/uom-mrp050307.php}}</ref>

Many antibiotics against MRSA are in phase II and phase III clinical trials. e.g.:
*Phase III : [[ceftobiprole]], [[Ceftaroline]], [[Dalbavancin]], [[Telavancin]], [[Aurograb]], [[torezolid]], [[iclaprim]] etc.
*Phase II : [[nemonoxacin]].<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00685698|Safety and Efficacy Study of TG-873870 (Nemonoxacin) in Diabetic Foot Infections}}</ref>
