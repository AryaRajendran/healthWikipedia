'''Jamaican vomiting sickness''' is an acute illness caused by the toxin [[hypoglycin]] A, which is present in unripened fruit of the [[ackee]] tree.  Hypoglycin A is present in the unripe [[aril|arilli]] at levels of over 1000 ppm, which falls to less than 0.1 ppm in the fully ripened arilli.  Hypoglycin B, found only in the inedible seed, is believed to be a derivative of hypoglycin A.  Its concentration rises from 0.4&nbsp;mg/g to 3.3&nbsp;mg/g as the fruit ripens.<ref name=medscape>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1008792-overview Medscape- Toxicity, Plants - Ackee Fruit]</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
When ingested, hypoglycin A is metabolized to produce methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA). MCPA acts to inhibit the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in two ways.  First, it interferes with the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria.  Also, it inhibits [[Acyl CoA dehydrogenase|acyl-CoA dehydrogenases]], so that only unsaturated fatty acids can be fully oxidized.  Fatty acids accumulate in the liver in a microvesicular pattern that can be seen on biopsy. In the absence of fatty acid metabolism, the body becomes dependent on glucose and glycogen for energy. [[Octreotide]] can be used to reduce secretion of insulin by the pancreas, preventing severe [[hypoglycemia]].<ref name=medscape />

Inhibition of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, however, also depletes a necessary cofactor for [[gluconeogenesis]].  Once the liver glycogen stores are depleted, the body cannot synthesize glucose, and severe hypoglycemia results.<ref name=medscape />

==Disease course==
Abdominal discomfort begins two to six hours after eating unripe [[ackee fruit]], followed by sudden onset vomiting. In severe cases, profound dehydration, seizures, coma, and death may ensue.  Children and those who are malnourished are more susceptible to the disease.<ref name=medscape />

== In popular culture ==
The disease appears in an [[ER (TV series)|ER]] episode, "[[ER (season 6)#Episodes|Great Expectations]]", where the symptoms are not recognized by [[John Carter (ER)|Dr. Carter]].
