Controversy has often surrounded [[psychiatry]],<ref name=tburns>{{cite web |url= |title=Psychiatry: A very short introduction |author=Tom Burns |year=2006 |work=Oxford University Press }}</ref> and the '''anti-psychiatry''' message is that psychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients. Psychiatry is often thought to be a benign [[medical practice]], but at times is seen by some as a coercive instrument of [[oppression]]. Psychiatry is seen to involve an unequal power relationship between doctor and patient, and a highly subjective diagnostic process, leaving too much room for opinions and interpretations.<ref name=tburns/><ref name=nasral/> Every society, including liberal Western society, permits [[compulsory treatment]] of mental patients.<ref name=tburns/>

Psychiatry's history involves what some view as dangerous treatments.<ref name=tburns/> [[Electroconvulsive Therapy]] was one of these, which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s. A brain surgery called [[lobotomy]] was another practice that was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal.<ref name=nasral/> In the US, between 1939 and 1951, over 50,000 lobotomy operations were performed in mental hospitals. [[Valium]] and other [[sedatives]] were over-prescribed, which led to an epidemic of dependence. There was also concern about the significant increase in prescribing psychiatric drugs for children.<ref name=tburns/><ref name=nasral>{{cite web |url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/pdf/1012/1012CP_Editorial.pdf |title=The antipsychiatry movement: Who and why |author=Henry A. Nasrallah |date=December 2011 |work=Current Psychiatry }}</ref> 

Three authors came to personify the movement against psychiatry, and two of these were practicising psychiatrists. The most influential of these was [[R.D. Laing]] who wrote a series of best-selling books, including ''[[The Divided Self]]''. [[Thomas Szasz]] rose to fame with his book ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]''. [[Michael Foucault]] challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling.  The term "anti-psychiatry" was coined by [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] in 1967.<ref name=tburns/><ref name=nasral/>

Divergence within psychiatry which generated the anti-psychiatry movement in the 1960s and 1970s, is still present. Freedom versus coercion, mind versus brain, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different, remain contemporary issues. Some ex-patient groups have become militantly anti-psychiatric, often referring to themselves as "[[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors]]" rather than patients.<ref name=tburns/>

==History==

===Precursors===
The first widespread challenge to the prevailing medical approach in Western countries occurred in the late 18th century.<ref name="Dain 1994" /> Part of the progressive [[Age of Enlightenment]], a "[[moral treatment]]" movement challenged the harsh, pessimistic, [[somatic]] (body-based) and restraint-based approaches that prevailed in the system of hospitals and "madhouses" for people considered mentally disturbed, who were generally seen as wild animals without reason.<ref name="Dain 1994" /> Alternatives were developed, led in different regions by ex-patient staff, physicians themselves in some cases, and religious and lay philanthropists.<ref name="Dain 1994" /> The moral treatment was seen as pioneering more humane psychological and social approaches, whether or not in medical settings; however, it also involved some use of physical restraints, threats of punishment, and personal and social methods of control.<ref name="Dain 1994" /> And as it became the establishment approach in the 19th century, opposition to its negative aspects also grew.<ref name="Dain 1994" />

According to [[Michel Foucault]], there was a shift in the perception of madness, whereby it came to be seen as less about [[delusion]], i.e. disturbed judgement about the truth, than about a disorder of regular, normal behaviour or will.<ref>Foucault, M. (1997)''Psychiatric Power'' in ''Michel Foucault: Ethics, subjectivity and truth'', Rabinow, Paul (Ed.) The New Press: New York. pp 39-50</ref> Foucault argued that, prior to this, doctors could often prescribe travel, rest, walking, retirement and generally engaging with nature, seen as the visible form of truth, as a means to break with artificialities of the world (and therefore delusions).<ref>''Psychiatric Power'', p 42.</ref> Another form of treatment involved nature's opposite, the theatre, where the patient's madness was acted out for him or her in such a way that the delusion would reveal itself to the patient.

According to Foucault, the most prominent therapeutic technique instead became to confront patients with a healthy sound will and orthodox passions, ideally embodied by the physician. The cure then involved a process of opposition, of struggle and domination, of the patient's troubled will by the healthy will of the physician. It was thought the confrontation would lead not only to bring the illness into broad daylight by its resistance, but also to the victory of the sound will and the renunciation of the disturbed will. ''We must apply a perturbing method, to break the spasm by means of the spasm.... We must subjugate the whole character of some patients, subdue their transports, break their pride, while we must stimulate and encourage the others'' ([[Esquirol]], J.E.D., 1816<ref name=DelaFolie>''De la Folie''. Chapter 5: ''Traitement de la folie,'' pp 132-133: in ibid. pp 43</ref>). Foucault also argued that the increasing [[internment]] of the "mentally ill" (the development of more and bigger asylums) become necessary not just for diagnosis and classification but because an enclosed place became a requirement for a treatment that was now understood as primarily the contest of wills, a question of submission and victory. The techniques and procedures of the asylums at this time included ''isolation, private or public interrogations, punishment techniques such as cold showers, moral talks (encouragements or reprimands), strict discipline, compulsory work, rewards, preferential relations between the physician and his patients, relations of vassalage, of possession, of domesticity, even of servitude between patient and physician at times.<ref name=DelaFolie/> Foucault summarised these as ''designed to make the medical personage the 'master of madness'<ref name=DelaFolie/> through the power the physician's will exerts on the patient. The effect of this shift then served to inflate the power of the physician relative to the patient, correlated with the rapid rise of internment (asylums and forced detention).<ref>''De la Folie'', p 44.</ref>

Other analyses suggest that the rise of [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] was primarily driven by [[industrialization]] and [[capitalism]], including the breakdown of the traditional family structures. And that by the end of the 19th century, psychiatrists often had little power in the overrun asylum system, acting mainly as administrators who rarely attended to patients, in a system where therapeutic ideals had turned into mindless institutional routines.<ref name="Crossley2006">{{cite book |author=Crossley, Nick |chapter=Contextualizing contention |title=Contesting Psychiatry: Social movements in Mental Health |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-35417-X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RuGQSN6sBA8C}}</ref> In general, critics point to negative aspects of the shift toward so-called "moral treatments", and the concurrent widespread expansion of asylums, medical power and involuntary hospitalization laws, in a way that was to play an important conceptual part in the later anti-psychiatry movement.<ref name="Crossley1998">Nick Crossley [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2352280 R.

Various 19th-century critiques of the newly emerging field of psychiatry overlap thematically with 20th-century anti-psychiatry, for example in their questioning of the [[medicalisation]] of "madness". Those critiques occurred at a time when physicians had not yet achieved [[hegemony]] through psychiatry, however, so there was no single, unified force to oppose.<ref name="Crossley1998"/> Nevertheless, there was increasing concern at the ease with which people could be confined, with frequent reports of abuse and illegal confinement (for example, [[Daniel Defoe]], the author of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', had previously argued that husbands used asylum hospitals to incarcerate their disobedient wives.<ref>Defoe, D. ''Demand for public control of madhouses''</ref>) There was general concern that physicians were undermining personhood by medicalizing problems, by claiming they alone had the expertise to judge it, and by arguing that mental disorder was physical and hereditary. The [[Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society]] arose in England in the mid-19th century to challenge the system and campaign for rights and reforms.<ref name="Hervey1986">{{cite journal | author = Hervey N | date = 1986 July; | title = Advocacy or folly: the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society, 1845-63 | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=1139650&pageindex=1#page | journal = Med Hist. | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 245–275 | pmc=1139650 | pmid=3523075}}</ref> In the United States, [[Elizabeth Packard]] published a series of books and pamphlets describing her experiences in the Illinois insane asylum to which her husband had had her [[involuntary commitment|committed]].

Throughout, the [[Social class|class]] nature of [[mental hospital]]s, and their role as agencies of control, were well recognized. And the new psychiatry was partially challenged by two powerful social institutions - the church and the legal system. These trends have been thematically linked to the later 20th century anti-psychiatry movement.<ref name="Dain1989">Dain, N.

As psychiatry became more professionally established during the nineteenth century (the term itself was coined in 1808 in Germany, as "Psychiatriein") and developed allegedly more invasive treatments, opposition increased.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Kleinman  | first =Arthur  | title = Rethinking Psychiatry: From Cultural Category to Personal Experience  | publisher = Collier Macmillan| year = 1988  | location =  | pages =  | isbn = 0-02-917442-2}}</ref> In the Southern US, [[Slavery in the United States|black slaves]] and [[Abolitionists]] encountered [[Drapetomania]], a pseudo-scientific diagnosis for why slaves ran away from their masters.<ref>[http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/question/nov05.htm Question of the Month - Jim Crow Museum at Ferris State University]</ref>

There was some organized challenge to psychiatry in the late 1870s from the new speciality of [[neurology]]. Practitioners criticized mental hospitals for failure to conduct scientific research and adopt the modern therapeutic methods such as nonrestraint. Together with lay reformers and social workers, neurologists formed the National Association for the Protection of the Insane and the Prevention of Insanity. However, when the lay members questioned the competence of asylum physicians to even provide proper care at all, the neurologists withdrew their support and the association floundered.<ref name="Dain1989"/>

===Early 1900s===
It has been noted that "the most persistent critics of psychiatry have always been former mental hospital patients", but that very few were able to tell their stories publicly or to confront the psychiatric establishment openly, and those who did so were commonly considered so extreme in their charges that they could seldom gain credibility.<ref name="Dain1989"/> In the early 20th century, ex-patient [[Clifford W. Beers]] campaigned to improve the plight of individuals receiving public psychiatric care, particularly those committed to state institutions, publicizing the issues in his book, ''A Mind that Found Itself'' (1908)<ref>Clifford Beers, ''A Mind That Found Itself,'' Pittsburgh and London: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1981  ISBN 0-8229-5324-2</ref> While Beers initially condemned psychiatrists for tolerating mistreatment of patients, and envisioned more ex-patient involvement in the movement, he was influenced by [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] and the psychiatric establishment, and toned down his hostility since he needed their support for reforms. His reliance on rich donors and his need for approval from experts led him to hand over to psychiatrists the organization he helped found, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene which eventually became the [[National Mental Health Association]].<ref name="Dain1989"/> In the UK, the [[National Society for Lunacy Law Reform]] was established in 1920 by angry ex-patients who sought justice for abuses committed in psychiatric custody, and were aggrieved that their complaints were patronisingly discounted by the authorities, who were seen to value the availability of medicalized internment as a 'whitewashed' extrajudicial custodial and punitive process.<ref name="Fennell1996">Phil Fennell (1996) [http://books.google.com/books?id=XqlBoZ_Vm7UC ''Treatment Without Consent: Law, Psychiatry and the Treatment of Mentally Disordered People Since 1845''] Routledge, 1996 ISBN 0-415-07787-7 pg108</ref> In 1922, ex-patient Rachel Grant-Smith added to calls for reform of the system of neglect and abuse she had suffered by publishing "The Experiences of an Asylum Patient".<ref>Rachel Grant-Smith (1922) [http://mcgovern.library.tmc.edu/data/www/html/texascoll/Psych/EAP/EAPContents.htm ''The Experiences of an Asylum Patient''] John P.

In the 1920s extreme hostility to psychiatrists and psychiatry was expressed by the French playwright and theater director [[Antonin Artaud]], in particular, in his book on [[van Gogh]]. To Artaud, who was himself to spend a fair amount of time in a [[straitjacket]], imagination was reality. Much influenced by the [[Dada]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] enthusiasms of the day, he considered [[dream]]s, thoughts and visions no less real than the "outside" world. To Artaud, reality appeared little more than a convenient consensus, the same kind of consensus an audience accepts when they enter a theater and, for a time, are happy to pretend what they're seeing is real.

In the 1930s several controversial medical practices were introduced, including inducing seizures (by [[electroshock]], [[insulin]] or other drugs) or cutting parts of the brain apart ([[leucotomy]] or [[lobotomy]]). In the US, between 1939 and 1951, over 50,000 lobotomy operations were performed in mental hospitals. But lobotomy was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal.<ref name="Whitaker">{{Cite book|last=Whitaker |first=Robert |title=[[Mad in America]]: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill |publisher=Basic Books |year=2004 |isbn=0-7382-0799-3}}</ref> 

[[Holocaust]] documenters argued that the [[medicalization]] of social problems and systematic [[euthanasia]] of people in German [[mental institution]]s in the 1930s provided the institutional, procedural, and doctrinal origins of the [[mass murder]] of the 1940s.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapon| first = Lenny| title = Mass Murderers in White Coats : Psychiatric Genocide in Nazi Germany and the United States | publisher=Psychiatric Genocide Research Inst | year=  1986 | isbn = 0-9614961-9-3 }}</ref><ref>[http://home.iprimus.com.au/burgess1/breggin.html The Psychiatric Holocaust - excerpts]</ref><ref name="Check1">Strous, Rael, [http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/8 ''Psychiatry during the Nazi era: ethical lessons for the modern professional''], Annals of General Psychiatry, 6.8, 2007</ref> The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted a number of psychiatrists who held key positions in Nazi regimes.

===1940s and 1950s===
The post-World War II decades saw an enormous growth in psychiatry; many Americans were persuaded that psychiatry and psychology, particularly [[psychoanalysis]], were a key to happiness. Meanwhile, most hospitalized mental patients received at best decent custodial care and at worst they were abused and neglected.

The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] has been identified as an influence on later anti-psychiatry theory in the UK, and as being the first, in the 1940s and 50s, to professionally challenge psychoanalysis to rexamine its concepts and to appreciate psychosis as understandable. Other influences on Lacan included poetry and the surrealist movement, including the poetic power of patients' experiences. Critics disputed this and questioned how his descriptions linked to his practical work. The names that came to be associated with the anti-psychiatry movement knew of Lacan and acknowledged his contribution even if they did not entirely agree.<ref name="Nasser1995">Mervat Nasser [http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/12/743 The rise and fall of anti-psychiatry] Psychiatric Bulletin (1995). 19, 743-746</ref> The psychoanalyst [[Erich Fromm]] is also said to have articulated, in the 1950s, the secular humanistic concern of the coming anti-psychiatry movement. In ''[[The Sane Society]]'' (1955), Fromm wrote ""An unhealthy society is one which creates mutual hostility [and] distrust, which transforms man into an instrument of use and exploitation for others, which deprives him of a sense of self, except inasmuch as he submits to others or becomes an automaton"..."Yet many psychiatrists and psychologists refuse to entertain the idea that society as a whole may be lacking in sanity. They hold that the problem of mental health in a society is only that of the number of 'unadjusted' individuals, and not of a possible unadjustment of the culture itself"<ref>Levine, B. (2008) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-e-levine/thinking-critically-about_b_125019.html Thinking Critically About Scientology, Psychiatry, and Their Feud] The Huffington Post, September 10</ref>

In the 1950s new psychiatric drugs, notably the antipsychotic [[chlorpromazine]], slowly came into use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was opposition, partly due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]], and partly due their "chemical straightjacket" effect and their alleged use to control and intimidate patients.<ref name="Whitaker" /> Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control.<ref name="Whitaker" /> There was also increasing opposition to the large-scale use of psychiatric hospitals and institutions, and attempts were made to develop [[Community mental health services|services in the community]].

In the 1950s in the United States, a [[right wing]] anti-mental health movement opposed psychiatry, seeing it as liberal, left-wing, subversive and anti-American or pro-Communist. There were widespread fears that it threatened individual rights and undermined moral responsibility. An early skirmish was over the [[Alaska Mental Health Bill]], where the right wing protestors were joined by the emerging [[Scientology]] movement.

The field of [[psychology]] sometimes came into opposition with psychiatry. [[Behaviorists]] argued that mental disorder was a matter of [[learning]] not medicine; for example, [[Hans Eysenck]] argued that psychiatry "really has no role to play". The developing field of [[clinical psychology]] in particular came into close contact with psychiatry, often in opposition to its methods, theories and territories.<ref name="MicalePorter"/>

===1960s===
Coming to the fore in the 1960s, "anti-psychiatry" (a term first used by [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]] in 1967) defined a movement that vocally challenged the fundamental claims and practices of mainstream psychiatry. While most of its elements had precedents in earlier decades and centuries, in the 1960s it took on a national and international character, with access to the mass media and incorporating a wide mixture of grassroots activist organizations and prestigious professional bodies.<ref name="MicalePorter"/>

Cooper was a South African psychiatrist working in Britain. A trained Marxist revolutionary, he argued that the political context of psychiatry and its patients had to be highlighted and radically challenged, and warned that the fog of individualized therapeutic language could take away people's ability to see and challenge the bigger social picture. He spoke of having a goal of "non-psychiatry" as well as anti-psychiatry. It has been suggested{{By whom|date=October 2011}} that Cooper may have seen psychiatry as analogous to [[apartheid]].<ref name="MicalePorter">Mark S. Micale, Roy Porter (1994) [http://books.google.com/books?id=h52sUVA3i20C Discovering the History of Psychiatry] Oxford University Press US, 1994 ISBN 0-19-507739-3</ref>

The psychiatrists [[R. D. Laing]] (from Scotland), [[Theodore Lidz]] (from America), [[Silvano Arieti]] (from Italy) and others, argued that "schizophrenia" and [[psychosis]] were understandable, and resulted from injuries to the inner self-inflicted by psychologically invasive "schizophrenogenic" parents or others; it was sometimes seen as a transformative state involving an attempt to cope with a sick society. Laing, however, partially dissociated himself from his colleague Cooper's term "anti-psychiatry". Laing had already become a media icon through bestselling books (such as ''[[The Divided Self]]'' and ''[[The Politics of Experience]]'') discussing mental distress in an interpersonal [[Existentialism|existential]] context; Laing was somewhat less focused than his colleague Cooper on wider social structures and radical left wing politics, and went on to develop more romanticized or mystical views (as well as equivocating over the use of diagnosis, drugs and commitment). Although the movement originally described as anti-psychiatry became associated with the general [[counter-culture]] movement of the 1960s, Lidz and Arieti never became involved in the latter. [[Franco Basaglia]] promoted anti-psychiatry in Italy and secured reforms to mental health law there.

Laing, through the [[Philadelphia Association]] founded with Cooper in 1965, set up over 20 [[therapeutic communities]] including [[Kingsley Hall]], where staff and residents theoretically assumed equal status and any medication used was voluntary. Non-psychiatric [[Soteria]] houses, starting in the United States, were also developed<ref>{{cite journal | author = Calton T, Ferriter M, Huband N, Spandler H | year = 2008 | month = Jan | title = A systematic review of the Soteria paradigm for the treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia | url = http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/1/181 | journal = Schizophrenia Bullutin | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 181–92 }}</ref> as were various ex-patient-led services.

Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] argued that "[[mental illness]]" is an inherently incoherent combination of a medical and a psychological concept. He opposed the use of psychiatry to forcibly detain, treat, or excuse what he saw as mere deviance from societal norms or moral conduct. As a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], Szasz was concerned that such usage undermined personal rights and moral responsibility. Adherents of his views referred to "the myth of mental illness", after Szasz's controversial 1961 book of that name (based on a paper of the same name that Szasz had written in 1957 that, following repeated rejections from psychiatric journals, had been published in the American Psychologist in 1960<ref>{{cite journal | author = Szasz T | year = 1960 | title = The Myth of Mental Illness | url = http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Szasz/myth.htm | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 113–118 }}</ref>). Although widely described as part of the main anti-psychiatry movement, Szasz actively rejected the term and its adherents; instead, in 1969, he collaborated with Scientology to form the [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]]. It was later noted that the view that insanity was not in most or even in any instances a "medical" entity, but a moral issue, was also held by [[Christian Scientists]] and certain [[Protestant]] [[fundamentalists]], as well as Szasz.<ref name="Dain1989"/>

[[Erving Goffman]], [[Deleuze]], [[Félix Guattari|Guattari]] and others criticized the power and role of psychiatry in society, including the use of "[[total institution]]s" and the use of models and terms that were seen as [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]].<ref>[http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/reprint/94/3/148.pdf?ijkey=07b5d6fed040a1f4c99d9e0fe381f33314e70145 Does psychiatry stigmatize?]</ref> The French [[sociologist]] and philosopher Foucault, in his 1961 publication ''[[Madness and Civilization]]: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason'', analyzed how attitudes towards those deemed "insane" had changed as a result of changes in social values. He argued that psychiatry was primarily a tool of social control, based historically on a "great confinement" of the insane and physical punishment and chains, later exchanged in the moral treatment era for psychological oppression and internalized restraint. American sociologist Thomas Scheff applied [[Labeling theory]] to psychiatry in 1966 in "[[Being Mentally Ill]]". Scheff argued that society views certain actions as deviant and, in order to come to terms with and understand these actions, often places the label of mental illness on those who exhibit them. Certain expectations are then placed on these individuals and, over time, they unconsciously change their behavior to fulfill them.

Observation of the abuses of psychiatry in the [[Soviet Union]] in the so-called [[Psikhushka]] hospitals also led to questioning the validity of the practice of psychiatry in the West.<ref>[http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2003/1212reich.shtml AAAS - AAAS News Release]</ref> In particular, the diagnosis of many [[political dissident]]s with schizophrenia led some to question the general diagnosis and punitive usage of the label [[schizophrenia]]. This raised questions as to whether the schizophrenia label and resulting involuntary psychiatric treatment could not have been similarly used in the West to subdue rebellious young people during family conflicts.<ref>[http://www.antipsychiatry.org/kendra-c.htm Why Outpatient Commitment Laws Change (Almost) Nothing]</ref>

===Since 1970===
New professional approaches were developed as an alternative or reformist complement to psychiatry. ''[[The Radical Therapist]]'', a journal begun in 1971 in North Dakota by Michael Glenn, David Bryan, Linda Bryan, Michael Galan and Sara Glenn, challenged the psychotherapy establishment in a number of ways, raising the slogan "Therapy means change, not adjustment." It contained articles that challenged the professional mediator approach, advocating instead revolutionary politics and authentic community making. [[Social work]], [[humanistic]] or [[existentialist]] therapies, [[family therapy]], [[counseling]] and [[self-help]] and clinical psychology developed and sometimes opposed psychiatry.

Psychoanalysis was increasingly criticized as unscientific or harmful.<ref>[[Adolf Grünbaum]]'s  ''The Foundations of Psychoanalysis: A Philosophical Critique''. Berkeley (University of California Press, 1984); ''Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis: A Study in the Philosophy of Psychoanalysis''. (International Universities Press, 1993).</ref> Contrary to the popular view, critics and biographers of Freud, such as [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]], [[Jeffrey Masson]] and [[Louis Breger]], argued that Freud did not grasp the nature of psychological trauma. Non-medical collaborative services were developed, for example therapeutic communities or Soteria houses.

The [[psychoanalytic]]ally trained psychiatrist Szasz, although professing fundamental opposition to what he perceives as medicalization and oppressive or excuse-giving "diagnosis" and forced "treatment", was not opposed to other aspects of psychiatry (for example attempts to "cure-heal souls", although he also characterizes this as non-medical). Although generally considered anti-psychiatry by others, he sought to dissociate himself politically from a movement and term associated with the radical left-wing. In a 1976 publication "Anti-psychiatry: The paradigm of a plundered mind", which has been described as an overtly political condemnation of a wide sweep of people, Szasz claimed Laing, Cooper and all of anti-psychiatry consisted of "self-declared [[socialists]], [[communists]], or at least anti-[[capitalists]] and [[collectivists]]". While saying he shared some of their critique of the psychiatric system, Szasz compared their views on the social causes of distress/deviance to those of anti-capitalist anti-[[colonialists]] who claimed that [[Chile]]an poverty was due to plundering by American companies, a comment Szasz made not long after a [[CIA]]-backed coup had deposed the democratically elected Chilean president and replaced him with [[Pinochet]]. Szasz argued instead that distress/deviance is due to the flaws or failures of individuals in their struggles in life.<ref>Kotowicz, Z. (1997) [http://books.google.com/books?id=EHTEEMQ2INUC R.D. Laing and the Paths of Anti-Psychiatry] Routledge ISBN 0-415-11611-2 pg90</ref>

The anti-psychiatry movement was also being driven by individuals with adverse experiences of psychiatric services. This included those who felt they had been harmed by psychiatry or who felt that they could have been helped more by other approaches, including those compulsorily (including via physical force) admitted to psychiatric institutions and subjected to compulsory medication or procedures. During the 1970s, the anti-psychiatry movement was involved in promoting restraint from many practices seen as psychiatric abuses.

The [[gay rights]] movement continued to challenge the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness and in 1974, in a climate of controversy and activism, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] membership (following a unanimous vote by the trustees in 1973) voted by a small majority (58%) to remove it as an illness category from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], replacing it with a category of "sexual orientation disturbance" and then "ego-dystonic homosexuality," which was deleted in 1987, although "[[gender identity disorder]]" and a wide variety of "[[paraphilias]]" remain. It has been noted that gay activists at the time adopted many of Szasz's arguments against the psychiatric system, but also that Szasz had written in 1965 that: "I believe it is very likely that homosexuality is, indeed, a disease in the second sense [expression of psychosexual immaturity] and perhaps sometimes even in the stricter sense [a condition somewhat similar to ordinary organic maladies perhaps caused by genetic error or endocrine imbalance. Nevertheless, if we believe that by categorising homosexuality as a disease we have succeeded in removing it from the realm of moral judgement, we are in error. ]<ref>Wright, RH, Cummings, NA.

Increased legal and professional protections, and a merging with [[human rights]] and [[disability rights]] movements, added to anti-psychiatry theory and action.

Anti-psychiatry came to challenge a "[[biomedical]]" focus of psychiatry (defined to mean [[genetics]], [[neurochemical]]s and [[pharmacology|pharmaceutic]] drugs). There was also opposition to the increasing links between psychiatry and [[pharmaceutical companies]], which were becoming more powerful and were increasingly claimed to have excessive, unjustified and underhand influence on psychiatric research and practice. There was also opposition to the codification of, and alleged misuse of, psychiatric diagnoses into manuals, in particular the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''.

Anti-psychiatry increasingly challenged alleged psychiatric pessimism and institutionalized alienation regarding those categorized as mentally ill. An emerging [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor movement]] often argues for full [[recovery model|recovery]], [[empowerment]], self-management and even full liberation. Schemes were developed to challenge [[social stigma|stigma]] and discrimination, often based on a [[social model of disability]]; to assist or encourage people with mental health issues to engage more fully in work and society (for example through [[social firms]]), and to involve service users in the delivery and evaluation of mental health services. However, those actively and openly challenging the fundamental ethics and efficacy of mainstream psychiatric practice remained marginalized within psychiatry, and to a lesser extent within the wider mental health community.

==Challenges to psychiatry==

===Civilization as a cause of distress===
In recent years, [[David Smail (psychologist)|David Smail]], a psychotherapist considered part of the anti-psychiatry movement, has written extensively of the "embodied nature" of the individual in society, and the unwillingness of even therapists to acknowledge the obvious part played by power and interest in modern Western society. He argues that feelings and emotions are not, as is commonly supposed, features of the individual, but rather responses of the individual to his situation in society. Even psychotherapy, he suggests, can only change feelings inasmuch as it helps a person to change the "proximal" and "distal" influences on his life, which range from family and friends, to politics and work.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smail |first=David John |authorlink=David Smail (psychologist) |title=Power Interest and Psychology |publisher=PCCS Books |year=2005 |location=Ross-on-Wye, UK |isbn= 1-898059-71-3}}</ref>

R.D. Laing notoriously emphasized [[family nexus]] as a mechanism whereby individuals become [[victimized]] by those around them, and spoke about a dysfunctional society.<ref>Laing, R.D. (1960) ''The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness'', Penguin Books.</ref><ref>Laing, R.D. and [[Aaron Esterson|Esterson, A.]] (1964) ''Sanity, Madness and the Family'', London: Penguin</ref>

===Normality and illness judgments===
[[File:Samuelcartwright.jpg|thumb|A madness of civilization: the American physician Samuel A. Cartwright identified what he called drapetomania, an ailment that caused slaves to be possessed by a desire for freedom and a want to escape]]

Reasons have been put forward to doubt the [[ontic]] status of mental disorders.<ref name=Phillips>{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=James et al.|title=The Six Most Essential Questions in Psychiatric Diagnosis: A Pluralogue. Part 1: Conceptual and Definitional Issues in Psychiatric Diagnosis.|journal=[[Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine]]|year=2012|month=January 13|volume=7|issue=3|pages=1–51|doi=10.1186/1747-5341-7-3|pmid=22243994|url=http://www.peh-med.com/content/pdf/1747-5341-7-3.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2012|publisher=BioMed Central|issn=1747-5341|pmc=3305603}}</ref>{{rp|13}} Mental disorders engender [[ontological]] skepticism on three levels:
# Mental disorders are abstract entities that cannot be directly appreciated with the human senses or indirectly, as one might with macro- or microscopic objects.
# Mental disorders are not clearly natural processes whose detection is untarnished by the imposition of values, or human interpretation.
# It is unclear whether they should be [[Concept|conceived]] as abstractions that exist in the world apart from the individual persons who experience them, and thus instantiate them.<ref name=Phillips/>{{rp|13}}

In the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements (including of what is [[norm (sociology)|norm]]al) while another proposes that it is or could be entirely [[objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[scientific]] (including by reference to statistical norms).<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Berrios G E |title=Classifications in psychiatry: a conceptual history |journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=145–60 |date=April 1999|pmid=10336212 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0004-8674&date=1999&volume=33&issue=2&spage=145 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.1999.00555.x}}</ref> Common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective but a "fuzzy [[prototype]]" that can never be precisely defined, or alternatively that it inevitably involves a mix of scientific facts and subjective value judgments.<ref>Perring, C. (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-illness/ Mental Illness] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref>

Critics of psychiatry generally do not dispute the notion that some people have emotional or psychological problems, or that some psychotherapies at least occasionally work for a given problem. They do usually disagree with psychiatry on the source of these problems; and on what the proper management options are.

One remarkable example of psychiatric diagnosis being used to reinforce cultural bias and oppress dissidence is the diagnosis of drapetomania. In the USA prior to the American Civil War, physicians such as Samuel A. Cartwright diagnosed some slaves with drapetomania, a mental illness in which the slave possessed an irrational desire for freedom and a tendency to try to escape.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sharkey |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Sharkey |title=Bedlam: greed, profiteering and fraud in a mental system gone crazy |publisher= St. Martin's Press |year=1994 |location=NY |page=182|isbn=0-312-10421-9}}</ref> By classifying such a dissident mental trait as abnormal and a disease, psychiatry promoted cultural bias about normality, abnormality, health, and unhealth. This example indicates the probability for not only [[cultural bias]] but also [[confirmation bias]] and [[bias blind spot]] in psychiatric diagnosis and psychiatric beliefs{{Citation needed|reason=this example is not enough to establish a particular pattern of bias. Please provide more evidence that this weakness exists and still applies to modern psychiatry.|date=December 2011}}.

In addition, many feel that they are being pathologized for simply being different. Some people diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]] or [[autism]] hold this position, particularly those involved in the [[autism rights movement]] or the [[autistic pride movement]]. While many parents of children diagnosed as autistic support the efforts of autistic activists, there are some who say they value the uniqueness of their children and do not desire a "cure" for their autism. The [[autistic community]] has coined a number of terms that would appear to form the basis for a new branch of [[identity politics]]; terms such as "[[neurodiversity]]" and "[[neurotypical]]".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Harmon |first=Amy |title= Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 9, 2004 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63}}</ref> However, an anti-psychiatric viewpoint is not found in nearly all of those advocating acceptance for autists or other "outsiders".

It has been argued by philosophers like Foucault that characterizations of "mental illness" are [[indeterminacy in philosophy|indeterminate]] and reflect the hierarchical structures of the societies from which they emerge rather than any precisely defined qualities that distinguish a "healthy" mind from a "sick" one. Furthermore, if a tendency toward self-harm is taken as an elementary symptom of mental illness, then humans, ''as a species'', are arguably insane in that they have tended throughout recorded history to destroy their own environments, to make war with one another, etc.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foucault |first=Michel |title=[[Madness and Civilization]]: a History of Insanity in the Age of Reason |publisher= Vintage Books |year=1988 |location=New York|isbn=0-394-71914-X}}</ref>

===Psychiatric labeling===
Mental disorders were first included in the sixth revision of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-6) in 1949.<ref name=Katsching>{{cite journal|last=Katsching|first=Heinz|title=Are psychiatrists an endangered species? Observations on internal and external challenges to the profession|journal=[[World Psychiatry]]|year=2010|month=February|volume=9|issue=1|pages=21–28|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816922/|publisher=[[World Psychiatric Association]]|pmc=2816922|pmid=20148149}}</ref> Three years later, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] created its own classification system, DSM-I.<ref name=Katsching/> The definitions of most [[psychiatric assessment|psychiatric diagnoses]] consist of combinations of phenomenological criteria, such as symptoms and signs and their course over time.<ref name=Katsching/> Expert committees combined them in variable ways into categories of mental disorders, defined and redefined them again and again over the last half century.<ref name=Katsching/> The majority of these diagnostic categories are called "disorders" and are not validated by biological criteria, as most medical diseases are; although they purport to represent medical diseases and take the form of medical diagnoses.<ref name=Katsching/> These diagnostic categories are actually embedded in top-down classifications, similar to the early botanic classifications of plants in the 17th and 18th centuries, when experts decided a priori about which classification criterion to use, for instance, whether the shape of leaves or fruiting bodies were the main criterion for classifying plants.<ref name=Katsching/> Since the era of Kraepelin, psychiatrists have been trying to differentiate mental disorders by using clinical interviews.<ref name=Kato>{{cite journal|last=Kato|first=Tadafumi|title=A renovation of psychiatry is needed|journal=[[World Psychiatrу]]|year=2011|month=October|volume=10|issue=3|pages=198–199|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188773/|publisher=[[World Psychiatric Association]]|pmc=3188773|pmid=21991278}}</ref>

In 1972, psychologist [[David Rosenhan]] published the [[Rosenhan experiment]], a study questioning the validity of psychiatric diagnoses.<ref name=Rosenhan>{{cite journal | author = Rosenhan D | year = 1973 | title = On being sane in insane places | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/179/4070/250 | journal = Science | volume = 179 | issue = 4070| pages = 250–258 | doi = 10.1126/science.179.4070.250 | pmid = 4683124 }}</ref> The study arranged for eight individuals with no history of psychopathology to attempt admission into psychiatric hospitals. The individuals included a graduate student, psychologists, an artist, a housewife, and two physicians, including one psychiatrist. All eight individuals were admitted with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists then attempted to treat the individuals using psychiatric medication. All eight were discharged within 7 to 52 days. In a [[Rosenhan experiment#The non-existent impostor experiment|later part of the study]], psychiatric staff were warned that pseudo-patients might be sent to their institutions, but none were actually sent. Nevertheless, a total of 83 patients out of 193 were believed by at least one staff member to be actors. The study concluded that individuals without mental disorders were indistinguishable from those suffering from mental disorders.<ref name=Rosenhan/> Critics such as [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] placed doubt on the validity and credibility of the study, but did concede that the consistency of psychiatric diagnoses needed improvement.<ref name=Spitzer2005>{{cite journal | author = Spitzer R.L., Lilienfeld S.O., Miller M.B. | year = 2005 | title = Rosenhan revisited: The scientific credibility of Lauren Slater's pseudopatient diagnosis study | url = | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 193 | issue = 11| pages = 734–739 | pmid = 16260927 }}</ref> It is now realized that the psychiatric diagnostic criteria are not perfect. To further refine psychiatric diagnosis, according to Tadafumi Kato, the only way is to create a new classification of diseases based on the neurobiological features of each mental disorder.<ref name=Kato/> On the other hand, according to Heinz Katsching, neurologists are advising psychiatrists just to replace the term "mental illness" by "brain illness."<ref name=Katsching/>

There are recognized problems regarding the diagnostic reliability and validity of mainstream psychiatric diagnoses, both in ideal and controlled circumstances<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams |first=J.B. |coauthors=et al. |title=The structured clinical interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) II: Multi-site test-retest reliability |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=49 |pages=630–36 |year=1992|pmid=1637253 |issue=8 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1992.01820080038006}}</ref> and even more so in routine clinical practice (McGorry ''et al.''. 1995).<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Spurious precision: procedural validity of diagnostic assessment in psychotic disorders |accessdate=2006-07-02 |author=PD McGorry |coauthors=C Mihalopoulos, L Henry, J Dakis, HJ Jackson, M Flaum, S Harrigan, D McKenzie, J Kulkarni and R Karoly |year=1995 |journal=Am J Psychiatry  |volume=152|pages=220–223 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/152/2/220 |issue=2}}</ref> Criteria in the principal diagnostic manuals, the DSM and [[ICD]], are inconsistent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=van Os |first=J. |coauthors=et al. |title=A comparison of the utility of dimensional and categorical representations of psychosis |journal=Psychological Medicine |volume=29 |pages=595–606 |year=1999 |pmid=10405080|issue=3}}</ref> Some psychiatrists who criticize their own profession say that [[comorbidity]], when an individual meets criteria for two or more disorders, is the rule rather than the exception. There is much overlap and vaguely defined or changeable boundaries between what psychiatrists claim are distinct illness states.<ref>[http://www.rossinst.com/trauma.htm The Ross Institute - Trauma]</ref> There are also problems with using standard diagnostic criteria in different countries, cultures, genders or ethnic groups. Critics often allege that Westernized, white, male-dominated psychiatric practices and diagnoses disadvantage and misunderstand those from other groups. For example, several studies have shown that [[African Americans]] are more often diagnosed with schizophrenia than Caucasians,<ref>[http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/44303 The influence of racial factors on psychiatric diagnosis]</ref> and women more than men. Some within the anti-psychiatry movement are critical of the use of diagnosis as it conforms with the [[biomedical model]].

===Tool of social control===
According to [[Franco Basaglia]] and his followers, whose approach pointed out the role of psychiatric institutions in the control and medicalization of deviant behaviors and social problems, psychiatry is used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment, and the ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups.<ref name="Sapouna">{{cite book|last1=Sapouna|first1=Lydia |last2=Herrmann|first2=Peter|title=Knowledge in Mental Health: Reclaiming the Social|url=http://books.google.com/?id=y1-X6iP-m9UC&pg=PA70|publisher=Nova Publishers|location=Hauppauge|year=2006|page=70|isbn=1-59454-812-9}}</ref>{{rp|70}} According to Mike Fitzpatrick, resistance to medicalization was a common theme of the gay liberation, anti-psychiatry, and feminist movements of the 1970s, but now there is actually no resistance to the advance of government intrusion in lifestyle if it is thought to be justified in terms of public health.<ref name=Fitzpatrick>{{cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Mike|title=From ‘nanny state’ to ‘therapeutic state’|journal=[[The British Journal of General Practice]]|year=2004|month=August|volume=1|issue=54(505)|pages=645|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1324868|accessdate=19 January 2012|pmc=1324868|pmid=15517694}}</ref> Moreover, the pressure for medicalization also comes from society itself.<ref name=Fitzpatrick/> Feminists, who once opposed state intervention as oppressive and patriarchal, now demand more coercive and intrusive measures to deal with child abuse and domestic violence.<ref name=Fitzpatrick/> According to Richard Gosden, the use of psychiatry as a tool of social control is becoming obvious in preventive medicine programmes for various mental diseases.<ref name="Gosden">{{cite book|last=Gosden|first=Richard|title=Punishing the Patient: How Psychiatrists Misunderstand and Mistreat Schizophrenia|year=2001|publisher=Scribe Publications|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-908011-52-0|page=14|url=https://sites.google.com/site/punishingthepatient/human-rights/social-control}} (The text of the book in full is available online by [http://sites.google.com/site/punishingthepatient/home click])</ref>{{rp|14}} These programmes are intended to identify children and young people with divergent behavioral patterns and thinking and send them to treatment before their supposed mental diseases develop.<ref name="Gosden"/>{{rp|14}} Clinical guidelines for best practice in Australia include the risk factors and signs which can be used to detect young people who are in need of prophylactic drug treatment to prevent the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions.<ref name="Gosden"/>{{rp|14}}

===Psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry===
Critics of psychiatry commonly express a concern that the path of diagnosis and treatment in contemporary society is primarily or overwhelmingly shaped by profit prerogatives <ref>{{Cite book|last=Moynihan |first=Ray and Alan Cassels |title=Selling Sickness: How the World's Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies are Turning Us All Into Patients'', Nation Books |year=2006|isbn=1-56025-697-4}}</ref> (echoing a common criticism of general medical practice in the United States, where many of the largest psychopharmaceutical producers are based).

Psychiatric research has demonstrated varying degrees of [[efficacy]] for improving or managing a number of mental health disorders through either medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. Typical psychiatric medications include [[stimulant]]s, [[antidepressants]], hypnotic [[benzodiazepines|minor tranquilizers]] and [[neuroleptics]] (antipsychotics).

On the other hand, organizations such as [[MindFreedom International]] and [[World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry]] maintain that psychiatrists exaggerate the evidence of medication and minimize the evidence of [[adverse drug reaction]]. They and other [[Psychiatric survivors movement|activists]] believe individuals are not given balanced information, and that current psychiatric medications do not appear to be specific to particular disorders in the way mainstream psychiatry asserts;<ref>[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?doi=83999 Rethinking Models of Psychotropic Drug Action]</ref> and psychiatric drugs not only fail to correct measurable chemical imbalances in the brain, but rather induce undesirable side effects. For example, though children on [[Ritalin]] and other psycho-stimulants become more obedient to parents and teachers,<ref name="Reclaiming">{{Cite book|last=Breggin |first=Peter |title=Reclaiming Your Children: A healing Plan for a Nation in Crisis |publisher= Perseus Publishing |year=2000}}</ref> critics have noted that they can also develop abnormal movements such as tics, spasms and other involuntary movements.<ref>[http://breggin.com/Newstimulants.pdf Psychostimulants in the treatment of children diagnosed with ADHD: Risks and mechanism of action] Peter R. Breggin</ref> This has not been shown to be directly related to the therapeutic use of stimulants, but to neuroleptics.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/health/10psyche.html?_r=2&hp=&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1178770545-7MBrQtesB6MQppWK6ofwBw&oref=slogin ''New York Times'' article]</ref><ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-01-atypical-drugs_x.htm ''USA Today'' article]</ref> The diagnosis of [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] on the basis of inattention to compulsory schooling also raises critics' concerns regarding the use of psychoactive drugs as a means of unjust [[social control]] of children.<ref name="Reclaiming"/>

The influence of pharmaceutical companies is another major issue for the anti-psychiatry movement. As many critics from within and outside of psychiatry have argued, there are many financial and professional links between psychiatry, regulators, and pharmaceutical companies. Drug companies routinely fund much of the research conducted by psychiatrists, advertise medication in psychiatric journals and conferences, fund psychiatric and healthcare organizations and health promotion campaigns, and send representatives to lobby general physicians and politicians. [[Peter Breggin]], Sharkey, and other investigators of the psycho-pharmaceutical industry maintain that many psychiatrists are members, shareholders or special advisors to pharmaceutical or associated regulatory organizations.<ref>Richard Gosden and Sharon Beder, [http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/corppower/pharm-agenda.html 'Pharmaceutical Industry Agenda Setting in Mental Health Policies'], Ethical Human Sciences and Services 3(3) Fall/Winter 2001, pp. 147-159</ref><ref>Thomas Ginsberg. [http://mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf/inquirer-on-drug-firms/ "Donations tie drug firms and nonprofits"]. [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] 28 May 2006.</ref>

There is evidence that research findings and the prescribing of drugs are influenced as a result. A United Kingdom cross-party [[parliamentary inquiry]] into the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in 2005 concludes: "The influence of the pharmaceutical industry is such that it dominates clinical practice"<ref name="House of Commons">[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmhealth/42/42.pdf House of Commons Health Committee: The Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry (Fourth Report of Session 2002-2005)]</ref><!--p. 100--> and that there are serious regulatory failings resulting in "the unsafe use of drugs; and the increasing medicalization of society".<ref name= "House of Commons"/><!--p. 101--> The campaign organization ''No Free Lunch'' details the prevalent acceptance by medical professionals of free gifts from pharmaceutical companies and the effect on psychiatric practice.<ref>[http://www.nofreelunch.org No Free Lunch]</ref> The ghostwriting of articles by pharmaceutical company officials, which are then presented by esteemed psychiatrists, has also been highlighted.<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1101680,00.html Revealed: how drug firms 'hoodwink' medical journals | Society | The Observer]</ref> Systematic reviews have found that trials of psychiatric drugs that are conducted with pharmaceutical funding are several times more likely to report positive findings than studies without such funding.<ref name="NIHCM 2001">[http://www.nihcm.org/finalweb/spending2001.pdf National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref>

The number of psychiatric drug prescriptions have been increasing at an extremely high rate since the 1950s and show no sign of abating.<ref name="Whitaker"/> In the United States antidepressants and tranquilizers are now the top selling class of prescription drugs, and neuroleptics and other psychiatric drugs also rank near the top, all with expanding sales.<ref name="NIHCM 2001"/> As a solution to the apparent conflict of interests, critics propose legislation to separate the pharmaceutical industry from the psychiatric profession.

[[John Read (psychologist)|John Read]], a psychologist, has promoted the idea of socioeconomic status as a significant factor in the development and prevention of mental disorders such as schizophrenia and has noted the reach of pharmaceutical company through industry sponsored websites as promoting a more biological approach to mental disorders, rather than a comprehensive biological, psychological and social model.<ref name=Read>{{cite journal|last=Read|first=John|authorlink=John Read (psychologist)|title=Can Poverty Drive You Mad?

===Electroconvulsive therapy===
{{Main|Electroconvulsive therapy}}
Psychiatrists may advocate psychiatric drugs, psychotherapy or more controversial interventions such as electroshock or [[psychosurgery]] to treat mental illness. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is administered worldwide typically for severe mental disorders. Across the globe it has been estimated that approximately 1&nbsp;million patients receive ECT per year.<ref>Prudic, Olfson, and Sackeim. "[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=80606 Electro-convulsive therapy practices in the community]".</ref> Exact numbers of how many persons per year have ECT in the United States are unknown due to the variability of settings and treatment. Researchers' estimates generally range from 100,000 to 200,000 persons per year.<ref>[http://www.ect.org/paper-on-ect-statistics-at-mh-stats-conference Paper on ECT statistics at MH Stats Conference &raquo; ect.org]</ref>

Some persons receiving ECT die during the procedure (ECT is performed under a general anaesthetic, which always carries a risk). [[Leonard Roy Frank]] cites approximately 400 deaths mentioned in psychiatric journals.<ref>The History of Shock Treatment : Author : Leonard Roy Frank</ref>

==="Total Institution"===
In his book ''[[Asylums (book)|Asylums]]'', Erving Goffman coined the term '[[Total Institution]]' for mental hospitals and similar places which took over and confined a person's whole life.<ref name="Davidson">{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Larry |last2=Rakfeldt |first2=Jaak |last3=Strauss |first3=John (editors) |title=The Roots of the Recovery Movement in Psychiatry: Lessons Learned |url=http://books.google.ru/books?id=tp4L_1zw9ngC&printsec=frontcover#PPA150,M1 |location= |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |pages=150 |isbn=88-464-5358-1}}</ref>{{rp|150}}<ref name="Wallace">{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=Samuel |title=Total Institutions |url=http://books.google.ru/books?id=F7uN3eHD1xQC&printsec=frontcover#PPA9,M1 |location= |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1971 |pages=9 |isbn=88-464-5358-1}}</ref>{{rp|9}} Goffman placed psychiatric hospitals in the same category as concentration camps, prisons, military organizations, orphanages, and monasteries.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite journal |author=Weinstein R. |title=Goffman's Asylums and the Social Situation of Mental Patients |journal=Orthomolecular psychiatry |volume=11 |issue=N 4 |pages=267–274 |year=1982 |month= |pmid= |doi= |url=http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1982/pdf/1982-v11n04-p267.pdf}}</ref> In ''Asylums'' Goffman describes how the institutionalisation process socialises people into the role of a good patient, someone ‘dull, harmless and  inconspicuous’; it in turn reinforces notions of chronicity  in severe mental illness.<ref name="Lester">{{cite journal |author=Lester H., Gask L. |title=Delivering medical care for patients with serious mental illness or promoting a collaborative model of recovery? |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=188 |issue= 5|pages=401–402 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16648523 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.105.015933 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/188/5/401}}</ref>

==Law==
{{Globalize|date=January 2010}}
While the insanity defense is the subject of controversy as a viable excuse for wrongdoing, Szasz and other critics contend that being committed in a [[psychiatric hospital]] can be worse than criminal imprisonment, since it involves the risk of compulsory medication with neuroleptics or the use of electroshock treatment.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Szasz |first= Thomas |title=Law, Liberty, and Psychiatry: An Inquiry into the Social Uses of Mental Health Practices |publisher=Syracuse University Press; Reprint edition |year=1989|isbn=0-8156-0242-1}}</ref><ref>[http://www.stopshrinks.org/yoder/index.htm Rodney Yoder Page]</ref> Moreover, while a criminal imprisonment has a predetermined and known time of duration, patients are typically committed to psychiatric hospitals for indefinite durations, an unjust and arguably outrageous imposition of fundamental uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Szasz |first=Thomas |title=Patient or Prisoner? |journal=Ideas on Liberty |volume=52 |pages=31–32 |year=2002}}</ref> It has been argued that such uncertainty risks aggravating mental instability, and that it substantially encourages a lapse into hopelessness and acceptance that precludes recovery.

===Involuntary hospitalization===
{{Main|Involuntary commitment|involuntary treatment}}
Critics see the use of legally sanctioned force in involuntary commitment as a violation of the fundamental principles of free or open societies. The political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] and others have argued that society has no right to use coercion to subdue an individual as long as he or she does not harm others. Mentally ill people are essentially no more prone to violence than sane individuals, despite Hollywood and other media portrayals to the contrary.<ref>[http://www.unchealthcare.org/site/newsroom/news/2009/January/elbogen/ UNC Health Care]</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc98/5_16_98/fob1.htm Science News]</ref> The growing practice, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, of [[Care in the Community]] was instituted partly in response to such concerns. Alternatives to involuntary hospitalization include the development of non-medical crisis care in the community.

In the case of people suffering from severe psychotic crises, the American Soteria project used to provide what was argued to be a more humane and compassionate alternative to coercive psychiatry. The Soteria houses closed in 1983 in the United States due to lack of financial support. However, similar establishments are presently flourishing in Europe, especially in Sweden and other North European countries.<ref>[http://ahrp.org/infomail/04/07/13.php Dr. Loren Mosher, 1933 — 2004]</ref>

The physician [[Giorgio Antonucci]], during his activity as a director of the ''Ospedale Psichiatrico Osservanza'' of Imola, refused any form of coercion and any violation of the fundamental principles of freedom, questioning the basis of the psychiatry itself.<ref name="test"> Antonucci, Giorgio, ''I pregiudizi e la conoscenza critica alla psichiatria'' (prologue by Thomas S. Szasz), Coop. Apache, 1986.</ref>

==Psychiatry as a pseudoscience==
Many of the above issues lead to the claim that psychiatry is a [[pseudoscience]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Warme |first=Gordon |title=Daggers of the Mind: Psychiatry and the Myth of Mental Disease |location=Canada |publisher=House of Anansi |year=2006|isbn=0-88784-197-X}}</ref> According to some philosophers of science (especially [[Karl Popper]]), for a theory to qualify as science it needs to exhibit the following characteristics:
* ''parsimony'', as straightforward as the phenomena to be explained allow (see [[Occam's razor]]);
* ''empirically testable and falsifiable'' (see [[Falsifiability]]);
* ''changeable'', i.e. if necessary, changes may be made to the theory as new data are discovered;
* ''progressive'', encompasses previous successful descriptions and explains and adds more;
* ''provisional'', i.e. tentative; the theory does not attempt to assert that it is a final description or explanation.

Psychiatrist Colin A. Ross and Alvin Pam maintain that biopsychiatry does not qualify as a science on many counts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ross |first=Colin |title=''"Errors of logic in biological psychiatry" in Colin Ross and Alvin Pam ''Pseudoscience in Biological Psychiatry |location=NY |publisher=Wiley & Sons |pages=85–128 |year=1995}}</ref>

==Diverse paths==
Szasz has since (2008) re-emphasized his disdain for the term anti-psychiatry, arguing that its legacy has simply been a "catchall term used to delegitimize and dismiss critics of psychiatric fraud and force by labeling them 'antipsychiatrists'". He points out that the term originated in a meeting of four psychiatrists (Cooper, [[R. D. Laing|Laing]], [[Joseph Berke|Berke]] and [[Leon Redler|Redler]]) who never defined it yet "counter-label[ed] their discipline as anti-psychiatry", and that he considers Laing most responsible for popularizing it despite also personally distancing himself. Szasz describes the deceased (1989) Laing in [[vitriolic]] terms, accusing him of being irresponsible and [[equivocal]] on psychiatric diagnosis and use of force, and detailing his past "public behavior" as "a fit subject for moral judgment" which he gives as "a bad person and a fraud as a professional".<ref name="Szasz2008">Szasz (2008) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/5181704176g65265/ Debunking Antipsychiatry: Laing, Law, and Largactil] ''Current Psychology'', Volume 27, Number 2 / June Pages 79-101 {{doi|10.1007/s12144-008-9024-z}}</ref>

Daniel Burston, however, has argued that overall the published works of Szasz and Laing demonstrate far more points of convergence and intellectual kinship than Szasz admits, despite the divergence on a number of issues related to Szasz being a libertarian and Laing an existentialist; that Szasz employs a good deal of exaggeration and distortion in his criticism of Laing's personal character, and unfairly uses Laing's personal failings and family woes to discredit his work and ideas; and that Szasz's "clear-cut, crystalline ethical principles are designed to spare us the agonizing and often inconclusive reflections that many clinicians face frequently in the course of their work".<ref>Daniel Burston (2004) [http://www.ehinstitute.org/01-20-2004.html Szasz, Laing and Existential Psychotherapy]</ref> Szasz has indicated that his own views came from libertarian politics held since his [[teens]], rather than through experience in psychiatry; that in his "rare" contacts with involuntary mental patients in the past he either sought to discharge them (if they were not charged with a crime) or "assisted the prosecution in securing [their] conviction" (if they were charged with a crime and appeared to be [[prima facie]] guilty); that he is not opposed to consensual psychiatry and "does not interfere with the practice of the conventional psychiatrist", and that he provided "listening-and-talking ("psychotherapy")" for voluntary fee-paying clients from 1948 until 1996, a practice he characterizes as non-medical and not associated with his being a psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist.<ref name="Szasz2008"/>

The [[gay rights activism|gay rights]] or [[gay liberation]] movement is often thought to have been part of anti-psychiatry in its efforts to challenge [[oppression]] and [[social stigma|stigma]] and, specifically, to get [[homosexuality]] removed from the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. However, a psychiatric member of APA's Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Issues Committee has recently sought to distance the two, arguing that they were separate in the early 70s protests at APA conventions and that APA's decision to remove homosexuality was scientific and happened to coincide with the political pressure. Reviewers have responded, however, that the founders and movements were closely aligned; that they shared core texts, proponents and slogans; and that others have stated that, for example, the gay liberation critique was "made possible by (and indeed often explicitly grounded in) traditions of antipsychiatry".<ref>{{cite journal | author = McCommon B | year = 2006 | title = Antipsychiatry and the Gay Rights Movement | url = http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=57&page=1809 | journal = Psychiatr Serv | volume = 57 | issue = | page = 1809 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.57.12.1809 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Rissmiller DJ, Rissmiller J | year = 2006 | title = Letter in reply | url = http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=97461 | journal = Psychiatr Serv | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 1809–1810 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.57.12.1809-a }}</ref>

In the clinical setting, the two strands of anti-psychiatry — criticism of psychiatric knowledge and reform of its practices — were never entirely distinct. In addition, in a sense, anti-psychiatry was not so much a demand for the end of psychiatry, as it was an often self-directed demand for psychiatrists and allied professionals to question their own judgements, assumptions and practices. In some cases, the suspicion of non-psychiatric medical professionals towards the validity of psychiatry was described as anti-psychiatry, as well the criticism of "hard-headed" psychiatrists towards "soft-headed" psychiatrists. Most leading figures of anti-psychiatry were themselves psychiatrists, and equivocated over whether they were really "against psychiatry", or parts thereof. Outside the field of psychiatry, however — e.g. for activists and non-medical mental health professionals such as social workers and psychologists — 'anti-psychiatry' tended to mean something more radical. The ambiguous term "anti-psychiatry" came to be associated with these more radical trends, but there was debate over whether it was a new phenomenon, whom it best described, and whether it constituted a genuinely singular movement.<ref>Paul Laffey (2003)[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/hah/5.2/laffey.pdf Antipsychiatry in Australia:Sources for a Social and Intellectual History] ''Health & History'' 5(2)  17–36</ref>

In the 1990s, a tendency was noted among psychiatrists to characterize and to regard the anti-psychiatric movement as part of the past, and to view its ideological history as flirtation with the polemics of radical politics at the expense of scientific thought and enquiry. It was also argued, however, that the movement contributed towards generating demand for grassroots involvement in guidelines and advocacy groups, and to the shift from large mental institutions to community services. Additionally, community centers have tended in practice to distance themselves from the psychiatric/medical model and have continued to see themselves as representing a culture of resistance or opposition to psychiatry's authority. Overall, while antipsychiatry as a movement may have become an anachronism by this period and was no longer led by eminent psychiatrists, it has been argued that it became incorporated into the mainstream practice of mental health disciplines.<ref name="Nasser1995"/> On the other hand, mainstream psychiatry became more biomedical, increasing the gap between professionals.

Many claims of anti-psychiatry are historical exaggerations based on events and primitive conditions from a century ago. However, although irritating and often unfair, [[Henry Nasrallah]] says "antipsychiatry helps keep us honest and rigorous about what we do, motivating us to relentlessly seek better diagnostic models and treatment paradigms. Psychiatry is far more scientific today than it was a century ago, but misperceptions about psychiatry continue to be driven by abuses of the past. The best antidote for antipsychiatry allegations is a combination of personal integrity, scientific progress, and sound evidence-based clinical care".<ref name="nasral"/>

A criticism was made in the 1990s that three decades of anti-psychiatry had produced a large literature critical of psychiatry, but little discussion of the deteriorating situation of the mentally troubled in American society. Anti-psychiatry crusades have thus been charged with failing to put suffering individuals first, and therefore being similarly guilty of what they blame psychiatrists for. The rise of anti-psychiatry in Italy was described by one observer as simply "a transfer of psychiatric control from those with medical knowledge to those who possessed socio-political power".<ref name="MicalePorter"/>

Some views of antipsychiatry have recently been reformulated into a '[[corporate psychiatry]]', heavily influenced by the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. A recent editorial about this was published in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' by Moncrieff, arguing that modern psychiatry has become a handmaiden to conservative  political commitments. [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] is a psychiatrist and professor in Psychological Medicine at [[Cardiff University School of Medicine]], [[Wales]]. He has a special interest in the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on [[medicine]] and [[academia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/547497_5 |title=Paradigms of Psychiatry: Eclecticism and Its Discontents |author=Seyyed Nassir Ghaemi |date=2006;19(6) |work=Curr Opin Psychiatry }}</ref>

In the meantime, members of the psychiatric consumer/survivor movement continued to campaign for reform, empowerment and alternatives, with an increasingly diverse representation of views. Groups often have been opposed and undermined, especially when they proclaim to be, or when they are labelled as being, "anti-psychiatry".<ref name="McLean2003part2">McLean, A.
