'''Toddler's fractures''' or '''childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures''' are [[bone fracture]]s of the [[distal]] (lower) part of the shin bone ([[tibia]]) in toddlers (aged 9 months-3 years) and other young children (less than 8 years).<ref name="pmid10532655">{{cite journal |author=Mellick LB, Milker L, Egsieker E |title=Childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures |journal=Pediatr Emerg Care |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=307–9 |year=1999 |month=October |pmid=10532655 |doi= 10.1097/00006565-199910000-00001|url=}}</ref> The fracture involves the distal third to distal half of the tibia,<ref name="pmid10532655"/> is undisplaced and has a spiral pattern. It occurs after low-energy [[Physical trauma|trauma]], sometimes with a rotational component.

==Diagnosis==
Typical symptoms include [[pain]], refusing to walk or bear weight and [[limping]] -[[bruising]] and deformity are absent. On [[clinical examination]], there can be warmth and swelling over the fracture area, as well as pain on bending the foot upwards ([[dorsiflexion]]). The initial [[Radiography|radiographical images]] may be inconspicuous (a faint oblique line) and often even completely normal.<ref name="pmid11242240">{{cite journal |author=Halsey MF, Finzel KC, Carrion WV, Haralabatos SS, Gruber MA, Meinhard BP |title=Toddler's fracture: presumptive diagnosis and treatment |journal=J Pediatr Orthop |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=152–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11242240 |doi= 10.1097/00004694-200103000-00003|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0271-6798&volume=21&issue=2&spage=152}}</ref> After 1-2 weeks however, [[Fibrocartilage callus|callus]] formation develops. The condition can be mistaken for [[osteomyelitis]], [[transient synovitis]] or even [[child abuse]]. Contrary to CAST fractures, [[non-accidental injury]] typically affect the upper two-thirds or midshaft of the tibia.

Other possible fractures in this area, occurring in the [[cuboid]], [[calcaneus]], and [[fibula]], can be associated or can be mistaken for a toddler's fracture.<ref name="pmid10954515">{{cite journal |author=Donnelly LF |title=Toddler's fracture of the fibula |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=175 |issue=3 |pages=922 |year=2000 |month=September |pmid=10954515 |doi= |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10954515}}</ref> In some cases, an internal oblique radiography and [[radionuclide imaging]] can add information to anterior-posterior and lateral views.<ref name="pmid2044585">{{cite journal |author=De Boeck K, Van Eldere S, De Vos P, Mortelmans L, Casteels-Van Daele M |title=Radionuclide bone imaging in toddler's fracture |journal=Eur.

==Pathophysiology==
The proposed mechanism involves [[shear stress]] and lack of displacement due to the [[periosteum]] that is relatively strong compared to the elastic bone in young children.<ref name="pmid7763080">{{cite journal |author=Sarmah A |title='Toddler's fracture'?

==Treatment==
Treatment consist of a long leg [[orthopedic cast]] for several weeks.<ref name="pmid11242240"/>

==History==
The condition was initially recognised by Dunbar and co-workers in 1964.<ref name="pmid14212071">{{cite journal |author=Dunbar JS, Owen HF, Nogrady MB, McLeese R |title=Obscure tibial fracture of infants -- the toddler's fracture |journal=J Can Assoc Radiol |volume=15 |issue= |pages=136–44 |year=1964 |month=September |pmid=14212071 |doi= |url=}}</ref> A new terminology has been proposed, which defines toddler's fracture as a subset of childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures.<ref name="pmid10532655"/>
