==Awards==
On October 3, 2011, the [[Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine]] announced that he had received one-half of the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], for "his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity". The other half went to [[Bruce Beutler]] and [[Jules A. Hoffmann]], for "their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity".<ref name="Nobel">{{cite press release|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2011|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> However, the committee was not aware that he had died three days earlier, on September 30, from [[pancreatic cancer]]. This created a complication, since the statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that the prize is not to be awarded posthumously.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nobel winner died days before award announced|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/03/health/nobel-prize/index.html?hpt=he_c2|accessdate=October 3, 2011|publisher=CNN|date=October 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Montreal-born scientist dies before Nobel honour|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/10/03/nobel-prize-medicine.html|accessdate=October 3, 2011|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> After deliberation, the committee decided that as the decision to award the prize "was made in good faith", it would remain unchanged.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph Steinman Remains Nobel Laureate|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/press_releases_archive/2011/steinman.html|accessdate=October 4, 2011|publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]]|date=October 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name="guardian nobel prize">{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/oct/03/nobel-prize-awarded-dead-scientist | title=Nobel prize to be awarded to dead scientist |work=The Guardian |location=London | date=2011-10-03 | accessdate=October 10, 2011 | author=Sample, Ian  | quote=The Nobel foundation concluded that the award should stand, saying: "The Nobel prize to Ralph Steinman was made in good faith, based on the assumption that the Nobel laureate was alive."}}</ref>

Steinman's daughter said that he had joked the previous week with his family about staying alive until the prize announcement. Steinman said: "I know I have got to hold out for that. They don't give it to you if you have passed away. I got to hold out for that."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8804713/Nobel-jury-left-red-faced-by-death-of-laureate.html |title=Nobel jury left red faced by death of laureate |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |first=Richard |last=Orange |date=October 3, 2011}}</ref>

Steinman had received numerous other awards and recognitions for his lifelong work on dendritic cells, such as the [[Albert Lasker Award For Basic Medical Research]] (2007), the [[Gairdner Foundation International Award]] (2003), and the Cancer Research Institute [[William B. Coley Award]] (1998). In addition, he was made a member of [[Institute of Medicine]] (U.S.A.; elected 2002) and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (U.S.A.; elected 2001).
