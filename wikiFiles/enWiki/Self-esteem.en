'''Self-esteem''' is a term used in [[psychology]] to reflect a [[person]]'s overall emotional evaluation of his or her own worth. It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self.  Self-esteem encompasses [[beliefs]] (for example, "I am competent," "I am worthy") and [[emotions]] such as triumph, [[despair]], [[pride]] and [[shame]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=John P.|title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=217–224}}</ref> Smith and Mackie define it by saying "The self-concept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it."<ref>E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007)p. 107</ref> Self-esteem is also known as the evaluative dimension of the self that includes feelings of worthiness, prides and discouragement.<ref>Newman, Barbara M., and Philip R. Newman. Development through Life: A Psychosocial Approach. Homewood, IL: Dorsey, 1975. Print.</ref> One's self-esteem is also closely associated with [[self-consciousness]].<ref>Schacter, Daniel. L "Psychology"</ref> 

Self-esteem is a disposition that a person has which represents their judgements of their own worthiness.<ref>Olsen, J.M., Breckler, S.J., &Wiggins, E.C. (2008). ''Social Psychology Alive''(1st ed.) Canada:Nelson.</ref> In the mid-1960s, Morris Rosenberg and social-learning theorists defined self-esteem as a personal worth or worthiness.<ref>Baumeister, Smart, & Boden, 1996</ref> [[Nathaniel Branden]] in 1969 defined self-esteem as "the experience of being competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and being worthy of happiness." According to Branden, self-esteem is the sum of [[self-confidence]] (a feeling of personal capacity) and self-respect (a feeling of personal worth). It exists as a consequence of the implicit judgement that every person has of their ability to face life's challenges, to understand and solve problems, and their right to achieve [[happiness]], and be given respect.<ref name="Branden">[http://books.google.es/books?hl=es&lr=&id=psvHFOqRuhkC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false Nathaniel Branden.

As a social psychological construct, self-esteem is attractive because researchers have conceptualized it as an influential predictor of relevant outcomes, such as academic achievement (Marsh 1990) or exercise behavior (Hagger et al. 1998). In addition, self-esteem has also been treated as an important outcome due to its close relation with psychological well-being (Marsh 1989). Self-esteem can apply specifically to a particular dimension (for example, "I believe I am a good writer and I feel happy about that") or a global extent (for example, "I believe I am a bad person, and feel bad about myself in general"). Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic ("trait" self-esteem), though normal, short-term variations ("state" self-esteem) also exist.

== Theories ==

Many early theories suggested that self-esteem is a basic human need or motivation. American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] included self-esteem in his hierarchy of needs. He described two different forms of esteem: the need for respect from others, and the need for self-respect, or inner self-esteem.<ref>Maslow A. H. (1987). ''Motivation and Personality'' (3rd ed.). New York: Harper & Row.</ref> Respect from others entails recognition, acceptance, status, and appreciation, and was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem. According to Maslow, without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need, individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain [[self-actualization]].

Modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves. [[Sociometer]] theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one's level of status and acceptance in ones' [[social group]]. According to [[terror management theory]], self-esteem serves a protective function and reduces anxiety about life and death.<ref>Greenberg, J. (2008). Understanding the vital human quest for self-esteem. ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', ''3'', 48-55.</ref>

The importance of self-esteem lies in the fact that it concerns to ourselves, the way we are and the sense of our personal value. Thus, it affects the way we are and act in the world and the way we are related to everybody else. Nothing in the way we think, feel, decide and act escapes the influence of self-esteem.<ref name="Bonet" />

[[Abraham Maslow]], in his [[hierarchy of human needs]], describes the "need for esteem," which is divided into two aspects, the esteem for oneself self-love, self-confidence, skill, aptitude, and respect receives from other people recognition, success, etc. The healthiest expression of self-esteem, according to Maslow, "is the one which manifests in respect we deserve for others, more than renown, fame and flattery".<ref name="Covarrubias">Cheroky Mena Covarrubias. [http://74.125.155.132/scholar?q=cache:tr0B1Z-2dpIJ:scholar.google.com/ «Una óptica humanista y conductista de la sustentabilidad»].</ref>

[[Carl Rogers]], the greatest exponent of [[humanistic psychology]], exposed that the origin of problems for many people despise themselves and they consider themselves to be unvaluable and unworthy of being loved; thus the importance he/she gave to unconditional acceptance of client.<ref name="Bonet" /> Indeed, the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person, summarized in the following sentence:

{{cquote|Every human being, with no exception, for the mere fact to be it, is worthy of unconditional respect of everybody else; he deserves to esteem himself and to be esteemed.<ref name="Bonet" />}}

By virtue of this reason, even the evil human beings deserve respect and considered treatment. This attitude, nonetheless, does not pretend to come into conflict with mechanisms that society has at its disposition to prevent individuals from causing hurt&nbsp;– of any type&nbsp;– to others.<ref name="Bonet" />

== Development ==

Experiences in a person's life are a major source of self-esteem development. The positive or negative life experiences one has, creates attitudes toward the self which can be favourable and develop positive feelings of self-worth, or can be unfavourable and develop negative feelings of self-worth. In the early years of a child's life, parents are the most significant influence on self-esteem and the main source of  positive and/or negative experiences a child will have. The emphasis of unconditional love, in parenting how-to books, represents the importance of a child developing a stable sense of being cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects of self-esteem as the child grows older.<ref>Olsen, J. M., Breckler, S.J., &Wiggins, E.C. (2008). ''Social Psychology Alive'' (1st ed.) Canada:Nelson.</ref>

During the school years, academic achievement is a significant contributor to self-esteem development.  A student consistently achieving success or consistently failing, strongly affects their individual self-esteem.<ref>Crocker, J., Sommers, S. R., & Luhtanen, R. K. (2002).  Hopes dashed and dreams fulfilled:Contingencies of self-worth and graduate school admissions.  ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28,'' 1275-1286.</ref> Social experiences are another important contributor. As children go through school they begin to understand and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities. These comparisons play an important role in shaping the child's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves.<ref>Butler R. (1998). Age trends in the use of social and temporal comparison for self-developmental hypothesis. ''Child Development, 69,'' 1054-73.</ref><ref>Pomerantz E. M., Ruble, D. N., Frey, K.S.,& Grenlich, F. (1995). Meeting goals and confronting conflict:Children's changing perceptions of social comparison. ''Child Development, 66,'' 723-38.</ref> As children go through adolescence peer influence becomes much more important, as adolescents make appraisals of themselves based on their relationships with close friends.<ref>Thorne, A., & Michaelieu, Q. (1996). Situating adolescent gender and self-esteem with personal memories. ''Child Development, 67,'' 1374-90.</ref> Successful relationships among friends is very important to the development of high self-esteem for children. Social acceptance brings about confidence and produces high self-esteem, whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem.<ref>Leary, M. R., & Baumeister, R. F. (2000). The nature and function of self-esteem: Sociometer theory. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.),''Advances in experimental social psychology'' (Vol. 32, pp. 1-62). San Diego, CA:Academic Press.</ref>

Parenting style can also play a crucial role in self-esteem development. Students in elementary school who have high self-esteem tend to have parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards for their child and allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.  Although studies thus far have reported only a correlation of warm, supportive parenting styles and children having high self-esteem it could easily be thought of as having some causal effect in self-esteem development.<ref>Coopersmith, S. (1967). ''The antecedents of self-esteem.'' New York: W.H. Freeman.</ref><ref>Isberg, R.S., Hauser, S.T., Jacobson, A.M., Powers, S.I., Noam, G., Weiss-Perry, B., &Fullansbee, D. (1989).

(1991). Patterns of competence and adjustment among adolescents from authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent and neglectful families. ''Child Development, 62,'' 1049-65.</ref>

Childhood experiences that contribute to healthy self-esteem include being listened to, being spoken to respectfully, receiving appropriate attention and affection and having accomplishments recognized and mistakes or failures acknowledged and accepted. Experiences that contribute to low self-esteem include being harshly criticized, being physically, sexually or emotionally abused, being ignored, ridiculed or teased or being expected to be "perfect" all the time.<ref>[http://cmhc.utexas.edu/selfesteem.html "Self-Esteem."] Self-Esteem.

=== Longitudinal study ===

A study done by Ruth Yasemin Erol and Ulrich Orth from the [[University of Basel]] examined the development of self-esteem in adolescence and young adulthood. The aim of the study was to determine the trajectory of self-esteem development; as in when does self-esteem development occur in life and in what direction. Another aspect of the study was to discover potential modifiers to individual differences in self-esteem development after recording trajectories. It was expected that self-esteem development would continuously increase during adolescence and young adulthood as per previous studies' results.<ref>Erol, R. Y., & Orth, U. (2011, July 4). Self-Esteem Development From Age 14 to 30 Years: A Longitudinal Study. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Advance online publication. doi: 10.1037/a0024299.</ref>

Erol and Orth found that self-esteem increases moderately through adolescence and continues to increase in young adulthood at a slower rate. A high sense of mastery, low risk taking and better overall health predicted higher self- esteem in participants at each age level. Emotionally stable, extroverted and conscientious participants experienced higher self-esteem as well. An individual's sense of mastery proved to be an important moderator of self-esteem trajectory for all participants. In the case of ethnicity playing a role in self-esteem differences, Hispanics had a lower rating of self-esteem in adolescence than Blacks and Whites but then increased to having a stronger, higher self-esteem than Whites by the age of 30. This study showed no results depicting a significant difference between self-esteem trajectories of men and women. The findings of this research, in regards to self-esteem trajectory, is consistent with what is known about the life span development of self-esteem. Erol and Orth's study documents the importance of adolescence as a possible critical period for self-esteem development. This studies results can lend itself to the implementation of self-esteem improvement interventions in young children.

==== Self-evaluation ====

Self-esteem requires "a self-evaluation process in which individuals compare their description of themselves as they are Real Self  with their description of themselves as they would like to become Ideal Self and as they fear becoming Dreaded Self".<ref name="self-evaluation">F Clark Power, Vladimir T Khmelkov, Character development and self-esteem: Psychological foundations and educational implications, International Journal of Educational Research, Volume 27, Issue 7, 1 February 1998, Pages 539-551, ISSN 0883-0355, 10.1016/S0883-0355(97)00053-0. (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035597000530)</ref> Self-esteem depends on living up to one's ideals.

Self-evaluation is important because the subject is able to assess what they know, what they do not know and what they would like to know. They begin to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses, and will be able to set goals that they know they can attain with the new knowledge they have about themselves.<ref>"Self-Evaluation." Self-Evaluation. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Nov. 2012. <http://www.ndt-ed.org/TeachingResources/ClassroomTips/Self-evaluation.htm>.</ref>

=== Development ===

There are four levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the Real Self, Ideal Self, and the Dreaded Self. The Real, Ideal, and Dreaded Selves develop in a sequential pattern on cognitive levels (moral judgment stages, ego development stages, and self-understanding).<ref name="self-evaluation" />

# Individuals describe their ''Real'', ''Ideal'', and ''Dreaded Selves'' with stereotypical labels, such as "nice" or "bad"
# Individuals describe their ''Ideal'' and ''Real Selves'' in terms of disposition for action or as behavioural habits. The ''Dreaded Self'' is often described as being unsuccessful or as having bad habits
# Individuals describe their ''Ideal'' and ''Real Selves'' in terms of traits that are based in attitudes as well as actions. ''The Dreaded Self'' are often described as have failed to meet social expectations or as self-centered.
# Individuals describe their ''Ideal'' and ''Real Selves'' as having a unified identity or character. Descriptions of the Dreaded Self focus on a failure to live up to one's ideals or role expectations often because of real world problems

Development brings with it increasingly complicated and encompassing moral demands. As individuals develop their depiction of their Dreaded Selves become increasingly more realistic and more plausible.

=== Secure vs. defensive ===

A person can have a high self-esteem and hold it confidently where they do not need reassurance from others to maintain their positive self view, whereas others with defensive, high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all high self-esteem individuals do; however, their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.<ref>Jordan, C. H., Spencer, S. J., & Zanna, M. P. (2003). "I love me...I love me not": Implicit self-esteem, explicit self-esteem and defensiveness. In S. J. Spencer, S. Fein, M. P. Zanna, & J. M. Olsen (eds.), ''Motivated social perception: The Ontario symposium'' (Vol. 9, pp. 117-145). Mahwah, NJ:Erlbaum.</ref><ref>Jordan, C. H., Spencer, S. J., Zanna, M. P., Hoshino-Browne, E., & Correll, J. (2003). Secure and defensive high self-esteem. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85,'' 969-978.</ref>

=== Implicit, explicit, narcissism, and threatened egotism ===

[[Implicit self-esteem]] refers to a person's disposition to evaluate themselves positively or negatively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with [[explicit self-esteem]], which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit self-esteem and implicit self-esteem are subtypes of self-esteem proper.

[[Narcissism]] is a disposition people may have that represents an excessive love for one's self. It is characterized by an inflated view of self-worth. Individuals who score high on Narcissism measures, Robert Raskin's ''40 Item True or False Test'', would likely select true to such statements as "If I ruled the world, it would be a much better place." There is only a moderate correlation between narcissism and self-esteem; that is to say that an individual can have high self-esteem but low narcissism or can be a conceited, obnoxious person and score high self-esteem and high narcissism.<ref>Sedikieds, C., Rudich, E. A., Gregg, A. P., Kumashiro, M., & Rusbult, C. (2004). Are normal narcissists psychologically healthy? Self-esteem matters. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 87,'' 400-416.</ref>

Threatened Egotism is characterized as a response to criticism that threatens the ego of narcissists; they often react in a hostile and aggressive manner.<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Smart, L., & Boden, J. M. (1996). Relation of threatened egotism to violence and aggression: The dark side of high self-esteem. ''Psychological Review, 103,'' 5-33.</ref><ref>Morf, C. C., & Rhodewalk, F. (1993). Narcissism and self-evaluation maintenance: Explorations in object relations. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 19,'' 668-676.</ref><ref>Twenge, J. M., & Campbell, W. K. (2003). "Isn't it fun to get the respect we're going to deserve?" Narcissism, social rejection, and aggression. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 29,'' 261-272.</ref>

=== Low self-esteem ===

Low self-esteem can result from various factors, including genetic factors, physical appearance or weight, socioeconomic status, or peer pressure or bullying.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jones FC |title=Low self esteem |newspaper=Chicago Defender|pages=33|year=2003 |ISSN=0745-7014}}</ref>

A person with low self-esteem may show some of the following characteristics:<ref>Adapted from J. Gill, "Indispensable Self-Esteem," in ''Human Development'', vol. 1, 1980.</ref>

* ''Heavy self-criticism'' and dissatisfaction.<ref name="Bonet" />
* ''Hypersensitivity to criticism'' with resentment against critics and feelings of being attacked.<ref name="Bonet" />
* ''Chronic indecision'' and an exaggerated fear of mistakes.<ref name="Bonet" />
* ''Excessive will to please'' and unwillingness to displease any petitioner.<ref name="Bonet" />
* ''Perfectionism'', which can lead to frustration when perfection is not achieved.<ref name="Bonet" />
* ''Neurotic guilt'', dwelling on and exaggerating the magnitude of past mistakes.<ref name="Bonet" />
* ''Floating hostility'' and general defensiveness and irritability without any proximate cause.<ref name="Bonet" />
* ''Pessimism'' and a general negative outlook.<ref name="Bonet" />
* ''Envy'', invidiousness, or general resentment.<ref name="Bonet" />
* Sees temporary setbacks as permanent, intolerable conditions.<ref>"KidsHealth." Developing Your Child's Self-Esteem. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Nov. 2012. <http://kidshealth.org/parent/emotions/feelings/self_esteem.html>.</ref>

When given feedback, individuals with low self-esteem often take it personally, and can be devastated by it. Low self-esteem individuals are very critical of themselves and depend on the approval of others for their own evaluation of self-worthiness. They believe that a person's approval of them is dependent on their performance, whether it be academic, relationship, etc. People with low self-esteem view their likeability in terms of successes:  others will accept them if they succeed but will not if they fail.<ref>Baldwin, M. W., & Sinclair, L. (1996). Self-esteem and "if...then" contingencies of interpersonal acceptance. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71'' 1130-1141.</ref>

== Measurement ==

Self-esteem is typically assessed using a [[self-report inventory]] yielding a  score on a continuous scale from low to high self-esteem.

Among the most widely used instruments, the Rosenberg (1965) 10-item self-esteem scale scores each item on a four-point response system that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves. An alternative measure, The Coopersmith Inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves.<ref>From the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Research Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health from the [[University of California, San Francisco]]. Online at http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/Research/Psychosocial/notebook/selfesteem.html#Measurement. Retrieved 25 February 2008.</ref>

If a subject's answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the scale regards them as well adjusted. If those answers reveal some inner shame, it considers them to be prone to social deviance.<ref>Slater, Lauren. "The Trouble With Self-Esteem." The New York Times. The New York Times, 03 Feb. 2002. Web. 27 Nov. 2012. <http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/03/magazine/the-trouble-with-self-esteem.html?pagewanted=all>.</ref>

More recently,{{when|date=December 2012}} implicit measures of self-esteem have begun to be used. These rely on indirect measures of [[cognitive processing]] thought to be linked to implicit self-esteem, including the [[Name letter effect|Name Letter Task]]<ref>Koole, S. L., & Pelham, B. W. (2003). On the nature of implicit self-esteem: The case of the name letter effect. In S. Spencer, S. Fein, & M. P. Zanna (Eds.), ''Motivated social perception: The Ontario Symposium'' (pp. 93-116). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.</ref> Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of, or control of, the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, they feature stimuli designed to represent the [[Self (psychology)|self]], such as personal pronouns (e.g., "I") or characters in one's name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Importance ==

[[Abraham Maslow]] states that psychological health is not possible unless the essential core of the person is fundamentally accepted, loved and respected by others and by her or his self. Self-esteem allows people to face life with more confidence, benevolence and optimism, and thus easily reach their goals and self-actualize.<ref name="Branden" /> It allows a person to be more ambitious, but not with respect to possessions or success,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} but with respect to what they can experience [[emotion]]ally, [[creativity|creatively]] and [[spirituality|spiritually]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

To develop self-esteem is to increase the capacity to be happy;{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} self-esteem may make people convinced they deserve [[happiness]].<ref name="Branden" /> Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since the development of positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones.<ref name="Branden" /> For [[Erich Fromm]], [[love]] of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those who are capable of loving others.Self-esteem allows [[creativity]] at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for [[teaching]] professions.<ref name="Miranda">Christian Miranda.

Revista Iberoamericana sobre Calidad, Eficacia y Cambio en Educación. 2005. Volume 3, number 1. PDF format.</ref>

José-Vicente Bonet claims that the importance of self-esteem is obvious as a lack of self-esteem is, he says, not a loss of esteem from others, but self-rejection. Bonet claims that this corresponds to [[Major depressive disorder]].<ref name="Bonet" /> [[Freud]] also claimed that the depressive has suffered "an extraordinary diminution in his self-regard, an impoverishment of his ego on a grand scale....He has lost his self-respect".<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 254-6</ref>

[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on [[international human rights law]] addresses the discriminatory attitude toward [[LGBT]] peoples that makes their self-esteem low to be subject to human rights violation including [[human trafficking]].<ref>[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], Preamble and Principles 11</ref> and [[World Health Organization]] recommends in "Preventing Suicide" published in 2000 that strengthening students' self-esteem is important to protect children and adolescents against mental distress and despondency, enabling them to cope adequately with difficult and stressful life situations.<ref>[http://www.who.int/mental_hearth/media/en/62.pdf Preventing Suicide, A resource for teachers and other school staff, WHO, Geneva, 2000]</ref> How this might be done, and whether it would be effective unclear.

Other than increased happiness, higher self-esteem is also known to be correlated with a better ability to cope with stress and a higher likeliness that the individual takes on difficult tasks relative to those with low self-esteem.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "Self Esteem." Psychology. ; Second Edition. New York: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 496.Print.</ref>

=== Correlates ===

From the late 1970s to the early 1990s many Americans assumed as a matter of course that students' self-esteem acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earn in school, in their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] with their peers, and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.

Peer-reviewed research undertaken since then has not validated previous assumptions. Recent research indicates that inflating students' self-esteem in and of itself has no positive effect on grades. One study has shown that inflating self-esteem by itself can actually decrease grades.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=Roy F.|coauthors=Jennifer D. Campbell, Joachim I.

<blockquote>"Attempts by pro-esteem advocates to encourage self-pride in students solely by reason of their uniqueness as human beings will fail if feelings of well-being are not accompanied by well-doing. It is only when students engage in personally meaningful endeavors for which they can be justifiably proud that self-confidence grows, and it is this growing self-assurance that in turn triggers further achievement."<ref>Reasoner, Robert W.

High self-esteem correlates highly with self-reported happiness; whether this is a causal relationship has not been established.<ref name="BaumeisterCampbell2003" /> The relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction is stronger in individualistic cultures.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3psyuli/PReprints/JRP_IESE_SWB.pdf | title=Predictive validity of explicit and implicit self-esteem for subjective well-being | author=Ulrich Schimmack and Ed Diener | journal=Journal of Research in Personality | year=2003 | volume=37 | pages=100–106 | doi=10.1016/S0092-6566(02)00532-9}}<!--page 101 mentions two studies that demonstrate this--></ref>

== Criticism and controversy ==

The American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] criticized on numerous occasions the concept of self-esteem as essentially self-defeating and ultimately destructive.<ref name="Ellis, A. 2001">Ellis, A. (2001). Feeling better, getting better, staying better. Impact Publishers</ref> Although acknowledging the human propensity and tendency to ego rating as innate, he has critiqued the philosophy of self-esteem as unrealistic, illogical and self- and socially destructive – often doing more harm than good. Questioning the foundations and usefulness of generalized ego strength, he has claimed that self-esteem is based on arbitrary definitional [[premise]]s, and over-generalized, perfectionistic and grandiose thinking.<ref name="Ellis, A. 2001" /> Acknowledging that rating and valuing behaviours and characteristics is functional and even necessary, he sees rating and valuing human beings' totality and total selves as irrational and unethical. The healthier alternative to self-esteem according to him is unconditional self-[[acceptance]] and unconditional other-acceptance.<ref>Ellis, A. ''The Myth of Self-esteem''. 2005.</ref> [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] is a psychotherapy based on this approach.<ref>Albert Ellis, Windy Dryden. [http://books.google.es/books?id=pPeFALg673MC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Practice of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy''.]</ref>

Psychologist Roy F. Baumeister and journalist John Tierney argue that the benefits of self-esteem can be significantly counter-productive, and that parental guidance towards self-esteem may thwart actual practices of self-control.

: "There seem to be only two clearly demonstrated benefits of high self-esteem....First, it increases initiative, probably because it lends confidence. People with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs, to stand up for what they believe in, to approach others, to risk new undertakings. (This unfortunately includes being extra willing to do stupid or destructive things, even when everyone else advises against them.)...It can also lead people to ignore sensible advice as they stubbornly keep wasting time and money on hopeless causes"<ref>(Baumeister and Tierney (2011)  ''Willpower: The Greatest's Human Strength'' , p. 192)</ref>

=== False stereotypes ===

For a person with low self-esteem&nbsp;– or "wrong" self-esteem, according to Branden's terminology&nbsp;– any positive stimulus or incentive will make him feel comfortable, or, at most, better with respect to himself/herself for just some time. Therefore, possessions, sex, success, or physical appearance, by themselves, will produce comfort, or a false and ephemeral development of self-esteem, but they will not really strengthen confidence and respect to oneself.<ref name="Branden" />

=== As narcissism ===

Life satisfaction, happiness, healthy behavioral practices, [[Self-efficacy|perceived efficacy]], and academic success and adjustment have been associated with having high levels of self-esteem (Harter, 1987; Huebner, 1991; Lipschitz-Elhawi & Itzhaky, 2005; Rumberger 1995; Swenson & Prelow, 2005; Yarcheski & Mahon, 1989).<ref>Michaels, M., Barr, A., Roosa , M., & Knight, G. (2007). Self-Esteem: Assessing measurement equivalence in a multiethnic sample of youth, ''The Journal of Early Adolescence'' 27(3), 270.</ref> However, a common mistake is to think that [[self-love|loving oneself]] is necessarily equivalent to [[narcissism]], as opposed for example to what [[Erik Erikson]] speaks of as "a post-narcissistic love of the ego".<ref>Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Penguin 1973) p. 260</ref>  A person with a healthy self-esteem accepts and loves himself/herself unconditionally, acknowledging both virtues and faults in the self, and yet, in spite of everything, is able to continue to love her/himself.

In Narcissists, by contrast, an "innate uncertainty about their own worth gives rise to...a self-protective, but often totally spurious, aura of [[grandiosity]]"<ref>Simon Crompton, ''All about Me'' (London 2007) p. 16</ref>&nbsp;– producing the class "of narcissists, or people with very high, but insecure, self-esteem... fluctuating with each new episode of social praise or rejection."<ref>Smith/Mackie, p. 479</ref> Narcissism can thus be seen as a symptom of fundamentally low self-esteem, that is, lack of love towards oneself, but often accompanied by "an immense increase in self-esteem" based on "the [[defense mechanism]] of denial by overcompensation."<ref>Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 407-10</ref>
"idealized love of self...rejected the part of him" that he denigrates&nbsp;– "this destructive little child"<ref>Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. 114</ref> within. Instead, the narcissist emphasizes his virtues in the presence of others, just to try to convince himself that he is a valuable person and to try to stop feeling ashamed for his faults;<ref name="Bonet" /> unfortunately such "people with unrealistically inflated self-views, which may be especially unstable and highly vulnerable to negative information,...tend to have poor social skills."<ref>Smith/Mackie, p. 126</ref>

== History ==

The [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of self-esteem (or [[self-concept]]) dates back to [[William James]], in the late 19th century, who, in his work ''[[Principles of Psychology]]'', studied the splitting of our "global self" into "knower self" and "known self." According to James, from this splitting, which we all are more or less aware of, self-esteem is born.<ref name="Bonet" />

In the 20th century, the initial influence of [[Behaviorism]] minimized introspective study of [[mental processes]], [[emotion]]s and [[feeling]]s, which was replaced by objective study through [[experiment]]s on [[behavior]]s observed in relation with environment. Behaviorism placed the [[Homo sapiens|human being]] as an [[animal]] subject to [[reinforcement]]s, and suggested to place [[psychology]] as an [[experimental science]], similar to [[chemistry]] or [[biology]]. As a consequence, [[clinical trial]]s on self-esteem were overlooked, since it was considered a less liable to rigorous [[measurement]] [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis]].<ref name="Bonet" />

In the mid 20th century, [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenology]] and humanistic psychotherapy made self-esteem gain prominence again, and it took a central role in personal [[self-actualization]] and psychic disorders' treatment. Personal satisfaction and [[psychotherapy]] started to be considered, and new elements were introduced, which helped to understand the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy, discouraged and unable to understand challenges by themselves.<ref name="Bonet" />

[[Carl Rogers]], the greatest exponent of [[humanistic psychology]], exposed his theory about unconditional acceptance and self-acceptance as the best way to improve self-esteem.<ref name="Bonet" /> Robert B. Burns considers that self-esteem is a collection of the individual's attitudes toward himself. The [[Homo sapiens|human being]] perceives itself at a [[sense|sensory]] level; [[thinking|thinks]] about itself and about its [[behavior]], and evaluates both its behavior and itself. Consequently, humans feel [[emotion]]s related to themselves. These emotions prompt behavioral tendencies aimed at oneself, at one's behavior, and at the features of one's body and character. These tendencies effect the attitudes which, globally, we call self-esteem. Thus, self-esteem, for Burns, is the evaluative [[perception]] of oneself. In his own words: "individual's behavior is the result of his environment's particular interpretation, whose focus is himself".<ref name="Bonet" />

Self-esteem has been included as one of the four dimensions that comprise [[core self-evaluations]], one's fundamental appraisal of oneself, along with [[locus of control]], [[neuroticism]], and [[self-efficacy]].<ref name="Judge1997">Judge, T. A., Locke, E. A., & Durham, C. C. (1997). The dispositional causes of job satisfaction: A core evaluations approach. Research in Organizational Behavior, 19, 151–188.</ref>  The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997),<ref name="Judge1997">Judge, T. A., Locke, E. A., & Durham, C. C. (1997).  The dispositional causes of job satisfaction:  A core evaluations approach. ''Research in Organizational Behavior,'' 19, 151–188.</ref> and since has proven to have the ability to predict several work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance.<ref name="Judge1997" /><ref name="BonoJudge2003">Bono, J.
