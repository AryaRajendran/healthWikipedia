The '''epigenetics of schizophrenia''' is the study of how the inherited [[epigenetic]] changes is regulated and modified by the environment and external factors, and how these changes shape and influence the onset and development of, and vulnerability to disorder, [[schizophrenia]]. Epigenetics also studies how these genetic modifications can be passed on to future generations. Schizophrenia is a debilitating and often misunderstood disorder that affects up to 1% of the world's population.<ref name="Roth_2009">{{cite journal | author = Roth TL, Lubin FD, Sodhi M, Kleinman JE | title = Epigenetic mechanisms in schizophrenia | journal = Biochim.

== Background ==

=== History ===

Historically, schizophrenia has been studied and examined through different paradigms, or schools of thought. In the late 1870s, [[Emil Kraepelin]] started the idea of studying it as an illness. Another paradigm, introduced by Zubin and Spring in 1977, was the [[Diathesis-stress model|stress-vulnerability model]] where the individual has unique characteristics that give him or her strengths or vulnerabilities to deal with stress, a predisposition for schizophrenia. More recently, with the decoding of the human genome, there had been a focus on identifying specific genes to study the disease. However, the genetics paradigm faced problems with inconsistent, inconclusive, and variable results. The most recent school of thought is studying schizophrenia through epigenetics.<ref name="Kaplan_2008">{{cite journal | author = Kaplan RM | title = Being Bleuler: the second century of schizophrenia | journal = Australas Psychiatry | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 305–11 | year = 2008 | month = October | pmid = 18781458 | doi = 10.1080/10398560802302176 }}</ref>

[[File:Diathesisstressdualriskmodel.JPG|thumb| alt=Alternative text,Diathesis-Stress Model|A visualization of the stress-vulnerability model,also known as the Diathesis-Stress Model]]

The idea of epigenetics has been described as far back as 1942, when Conrad Waddington described it as how the environment regulated genetics. As the field and available technology has progressed, the term has come to also refer to the molecular mechanisms of regulation. The concept that these epigenetic changes can be passed on to future generations has progressively become more accepted.<ref name="Pidsley_2011">{{cite journal | author = Pidsley R, Mill J | title = Epigenetic studies of psychosis: current findings, methodological approaches, and implications for postmortem research | journal = Biol. Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 146–56 | year = 2011 | month = January | pmid = 20510393 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.03.029 }}</ref>

While epigenetics is a relatively new field of study, specific applications and focus on mental disorders like schizophrenia is an even more recent area of research.

=== Schizophrenia ===

==== Symptoms ====

The core symptoms of schizophrenia can be classified into three broad categories. These symptoms are often used to build and study schizophrenic animal and behavioral models in the field of epigenetics.<ref name="Roth_2009"/> Positive symptoms are considered [[limbic system|limbic]] system aberrations, while negative and cognitive symptoms are thought of as frontal lobe abnormalities.<ref name="isbn0-205-59495-6">{{cite book | author = Hooley JM, Butcher JN, Mineka S | title = Abnormal Psychology (14th Edition) (MyPsychLab Series) | publisher = Allyn & Bacon | location = Boston, Mass | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 0-205-59495-6 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>

Positive Symptoms:
[[File:Brain limbicsystem.jpg|thumb| alt=Alternative text,Limbic system of the brain|The limbic system and associated structures of the brain, where abnormalities lead to positive symptoms of schizophrenia.]]
*[[hallucinations|Hallucination]]
*Delusions and paranoia
*Thought disorders
Negative Symptoms:
*Apathy
*[[alogia|Poverty of speech]]
* Flat or blunted emotions
Cognitive Dysfunctions:
*Impaired working memory
*Disorganized thoughts
* Cognitive impairments<ref name="Roth_2009"/>

==== Heritability ====

There is a great deal of evidence to show that schizophrenia is a heritable disease. One key piece of evidence is a twin study that showed that the likelihood of developing the disease is 53% for one member of monozygotic twins (twins with same genetic code), compared to the 15% for dizygotic twins, who don't share the exact DNA.<ref name="Sham_1996">{{cite journal | author = Sham P | title = Genetic epidemiology | journal = Br. Med. Bull. | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 408–33 | year = 1996 | month = July | pmid = 8949247 | doi =10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a011557 }}</ref>

The fact that even monozygotic twins don't share a 100% [[concordance (genetics)|concordance]] rate suggests environmental factors play a role in the vulnerability and development of the disorder. There are various environmental factors that have been suggested, including the use of marijuana, complications during pregnancy, socioeconomic status and environment, and maternal malnutrition. As the field of epigenetics advances, these and other external risk factors are likely to be considered in epidemiological studies.<ref name="Roth_2009"/>

==== Genetics ====

Several genes have been identified as important in the study of schizophrenia, but there are a few that have special roles when studying the epigenetic modifications of the disease.
*[[GAD1]]- GAD1 codes for the [[protein]] [[GAD67]], an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of [[gaba|GABA]] from [[glutamate]]. Schizophrenics have shown a decrease in GAD67 levels and this deficit is thought to lead to working memory problems, among other impairments.<ref name="Gavin_2010">{{cite journal | author = Gavin DP, Sharma RP | title = Histone modifications, DNA methylation, and schizophrenia | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 882–8 | year = 2010 | month = May | pmid = 19879893 | pmc = 2848916 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2009.10.010 | url = }}</ref>

*[[RELN]]- RELN codes for [[reelin]], an extracellular protein that is necessary for formation of memories and learning through plasticity. Reelin is thought to regulate nearby [[glutamate]] producing neurons.<ref name="Roth_2009"/>

Both proteins are created by GABAergic neurons. Several studies have demonstrated that levels of both reelin and GAD67 are downregulated  in schizophrenic patients and animal models.

*[[bdnf|BDNF]] - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, is another important gene in the study of schizophrenia genetics. BDNF plays a crucial role in cognition, learning, memory formation, and vulnerability to social and life experiences.<ref name="Roth_2009"/>

=== Research methods ===

Epigenetics can be studies and researched through various methods. One of the most common methods is looking at [[postmortem studies|postmortem brain tissue]] of schizophrenic patients and analyzing them for biomarkers. Other common methods include tissue culture studies of neurons, genome-wide analysis of non-brain cells in living patients (see [[Peripheral blood mononuclear cell|PBMC]]), and transgenic and schizophrenic animal models.<ref name="Roth_2009"/>

Other studies that are currently being done or that can be done in the future include longitudinal studies of patients, "at-risk" populations, and monozygotic twins, and studies that  examine specific gene-environment interactions and epigenetic effects.<ref name="Rutten_2009">{{cite journal | author = Rutten BP, Mill J | title = Epigenetic mediation of environmental influences in major psychotic disorders | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 1045–56 | year = 2009 | month = November | pmid = 19783603 | pmc = 2762629 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbp104 }}</ref>

== Epigenetic alterations ==

Epigenetics (translated as "above genetics")is the study of how genes are regulated through reversible and heritable molecular mechanisms. The epigenetic changes modify gene expression through either activation of the gene that codes for a certain protein, or repression of the gene. There are two main categories of modifications: the [[methylation]] of [[DNA]] and modifications to [[histones]]. Research findings have demonstrated that several examples of both of these changes are linked to schizophrenia and its symptoms.<ref name="Roth_2009"/>
[[File:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb| alt=Alternative text, Mechanisms of Epigenetics|Mechanisms of Epigenetics in the Cell]]

=== DNA methylation ===
DNA methylation is the covalent addition of a [[methyl]] group to a segment of the DNA code. These -CH3 groups are added to [[cytosine]] residues by the [[DNMT]] (DNA Methytransferases) enzymes. The binding methyl group to [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] regions interferes with the binding of [[transcription factors]] and silences the gene by preventing the transcription of that code.<ref name="Roth_2009"/> DNA methylation is one of the most well studied epigenetic mechanisms and there have been several findings linking it to schizophrenia.

==== Methylation of GABAergic genes ====

It has been consistently shown in various studies that levels of reelin and GAD67 are downregulated in the cortical and [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] tissue samples of schizophrenics. These proteins are used by GABAergic neurons, and abnormalities in their levels could result in some of the symptoms found in schizophrenics. The genes for these two proteins are found in areas of the genetic code that can be methylated (see [[CpG island]]).
Recent studies have demonstrated an epigenetic link between the levels of the proteins and schizophrenia. One study found that cortical neurons with lower levels of GAD67 and reelin also showed increased levels of DNMT1, one of the enzymes that adds a methyl group. It has also been shown that a schizophrenic-type state can be induced in mice when they were chronically given l-methionine, a precursor necessary for DNMT activity. These and other findings provide a strong link between epigenetic changes and schizophrenia.<ref name="Gavin_2010"/>

==== Methylation of BDNF ====

DNA methylation can also affect expression of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor). The BDNF protein is important for cognition, learning, and even vulnerability to early life trauma. Sun et al. showed that fear condition led to changes in DNA methylation levels in BDNF promoter regions in hippocampal neurons. It was also shown that inhibiting DNMT activity led to change in levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Methylation of BDNF DNA has also been shown to be affected by post-natal social experiences, stressful environment, and social interaction deprivation. Furthermore, these stimuli have also been linked to increased anxiety, problems with cognition, etc. While a direct link between schizophrenia and BDNF levels hasn't been established, these findings suggest a relation to many problems that are similar to symptoms.<ref name="Roth_2009"/>

=== Histone modifications ===

Histones are proteins that the DNA chromosome are wrapped around. Histones are present as an octamer (set of 8 proteins) and they can be modified through [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[SUMOylation]], etc. These changes can either open or close up the chromosome. Thus, depending on which histone is modified and the exact process, histone modifications can either silence or promote gene expression (while DNA methylation almost always silences).

Because the sub-field of histone modifications is relatively new, there aren't many results yet. Some studies have found that schizophrenic patients have higher levels of methylation at H3 (the 3rd histone in the octamer) in the prefrontal cortex, an area that could be related to the negative symptoms. It has also been shown that histone acetylation and [[phosphorylation]] is increased at the promoter for the BDNF protein, which is involved in learning and memory.<ref name="Roth_2009"/>

More recent studies have found that postmortem brain tissue from schizopphrenic patients had higher levels of [[HDAC]], histone deacetylase, an enzyme that remove acetyl groups from histones. HDAC1 levels are inversely correlated with GAD67 protein expression, which is decreased in schizophrenic patients.<ref name="Gavin_2010"/>

=== Heritability ===

Studies have shown that epigenetic changes can be passed on to future generations through meiosis and mitosis.<ref name="Goto_1998">{{cite journal | author = Goto T, Monk M | title = Regulation of X-chromosome inactivation in development in mice and humans | journal = Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 362–78 | year = 1998 | month = June | pmid = 9618446 | pmc = 98919 | doi = }}</ref> These findings suggest that environmental factors that the parents face can possibly affect how the child's genetic code is regulated. Research findings have shown this to be true for schizophrenic patients as well. In rats, the transmission of maternal behavior and even stress responses can be attributed to how certain genes in the hippocampus of the mother are methylated.<ref name="Roth_2009"/>  Another study has shown that the methylation of the BDNF gene, which can be affected by early life stress and abuse, is also transmittable to future generations.<ref name="Roth_2009">{{cite journal | author = Roth TL, Lubin FD, Funk AJ, Sweatt JD | title = Lasting epigenetic influence of early-life adversity on the BDNF gene | journal = Biol.

== Environmental risks and causes ==

While there haven't been many studies linking environmental factors to schizophrenia-related epigenetics mechanisms at this point in the field, a few studies have shown interesting results.
Advanced paternal age is one of the risk factors for schizophrenia, according to recent research. This is  through mutagenesis, which cause further spontaneous changes, or through genomic imprinting. As the parent ages, more and more errors may occur in the epigenetic process.<ref name="van Os">{{cite journal | author = van Os J, Rutten BP, Poulton R | title = Gene-environment interactions in schizophrenia: review of epidemiological findings and future directions | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1066–82 | year = 2008 | month = November | pmid = 18791076 | pmc = 2632485 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbn117 }}</ref> There is also evidence of the association between the inhalation of benzene through the burning of wood and schizophrenic development. This might occur through epigenetic changes.<ref name="Ross_2009">{{cite journal | author = Ross CM | title = Epigenetics, traffic and firewood | journal = Schizophr. Res. | volume = 109 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 193 | year = 2009 | month = April | pmid = 19217264 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2009.01.007 }}</ref> Methamphetamine has also been to linked to causing schizophrenia or similar psychotic symptoms. A recent study found that methamphetamine users had altered DNMT1 levels, similar to how schizophrenic patients have shown abnormal levels of DNMT1 in GABAergic neurons.<ref name="Oh_Petronis_2008">{{cite journal | author = Oh G, Petronis A | title = Environmental studies of schizophrenia through the prism of epigenetics | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 1122–9 | year = 2008 | month = November | pmid = 18703665 | pmc = 2632494 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbn105 }}</ref>

One of the most interesting findings relating an environmental factor with schizophrenic epigenetic mechanisms is exposure to nicotine. It has been widely reported that 80% of schizophrenic patients use some form of tobacco.<ref name=Kelly_2000>{{cite journal | author =Kelly C | title = Cigarette smoking and schizophrenia | journal = Advances in Psychiatric Treatment | year = 2000 | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 327–331 | doi = 10.1192/apt.6.5.327 }}</ref> Furthermore, smoking appeared to increase cognition in schizophrenics. However, it was only a recent study Satta et al.that showed that nicotine leads to decreased levels of DNMT1 in GABAergic mouse neurons, a molecule which adds methyl groups to DNA. This led to increased expression of GAD67.<ref name="Satta_2008">{{cite journal | author = Satta R, Maloku E, Zhubi A, Pibiri F, Hajos M, Costa E, Guidotti A | title = Nicotine decreases DNA methyltransferase 1 expression and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 promoter methylation in GABAergic interneurons | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 105 | issue = 42 | pages = 16356–61 | year = 2008 | month = October | pmid = 18852456 | pmc = 2570996 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0808699105 }}</ref>

== Research limitations ==

There are several limitations to current research methods and scientific findings. One problem with postmortem studies is that they only demonstrate a single snapshot of a schizophrenic patient. Thus, it is hard to relate whether biomarker findings are related to the pathology of schizophrenia.

Another limitation is that the most relevant tissue, that of the brain, is impossible to obtain in living, schizophrenic patients. To work around this, several studies have used more accessible sources, like lymphocytes or germ cell lines, since some studies have shown that epigenetic mutations can be detected in other tissues.

Epigenetic studies of disorders like schizophrenia are also subject to the subjectivity of psychiatric diagnoses and the spectrum-like nature of mental health problems. This problem with classification of mental health problems have led to intermediate phenotypes that might be better fit.<ref name="Rutten_2009"/>

== Detection and treatment ==

The advent of epigenetics as an avenue to pursue schizophrenic research has brought about many possibilities for both early detection, diagnoses, and treatment.  While this field is still at an early stage, there have already been promising findings.Some postmortem brain studies looking at the gene expression of histone methylation has shown promising results that might be used for early detection in other patients. However, the bulk of the translational research focus and findings have been on therapeutic interventions.<ref name="Gavin_2010"/>

=== Therapeutics ===

Since epigenetic changes are reversible and susceptible pharmacological treatments and drugs, there is a great deal of promise in developing treatments. As many have pointed out, schizophrenia is a lifelong disorder that had widespread effects. Thus, it may not be possible to fully reverse the disease. However, recent findings suggest that it is possible to treat schizophrenic patients, alleviate symptoms, or improve the efficacy of anti-psychotic medication.<ref name="Gavin_2010"/>

==== Targeting histones modifications ====

[[HDAC]] (histone deacetylase) inhibitors are one class of drugs that are being investigated. Studies have shown that levels of reelin and GAD67 (which are decreased in schizophrenic animal models) are both upregulated after treatment with HDAC inhibitors. Furthermore, there is the added benefit of selectivity, as HDAC inhibitors can be specific to cell type, tissue type, and even regions of the brain.<ref name="Gavin_2010"/>

[[HMT]] (histone demethylase) inhibitors also act on histones. They prevent the demethylation of the H3K4 histone protein and open up that part of the chromatin. Tranylcypromine, an [[antidepressant]], has been shown to have HMT inhibitory properties, and in a study, treatment of schizophrenic patients with tranylcypromine showed improvements regarding negative symptoms.<ref name="Gavin_2010"/>

==== Targeting DNA methylation ====

DNMT inhibitors have also been shown to increase levels of the reeling protein and GAD67 in cell cultures. Some of the current DNMT inhibitors, however, like zebularine and procainamide, do not cross the blood brain barrier and would not prove as effective a treatment. While DNMT inhibitors would prevent the addition of a methyl group, there is also research done on DNA demethylate inducers, which would pharmacologically induce the removal of methyl groups. Current antipsychotic drugs, like [[clozapine]] and [[sulpiride]], have been shown to also induce demethylation.<ref name="Gavin_2010"/>
