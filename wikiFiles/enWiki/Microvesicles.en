== Microvesicle sources ==
Different cells can release microvesicles from the plasma membrane. Sources of microvesicles include [[megakaryocytes]], [[blood platelets]], [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], tumor cells and [[placenta]]. Platelets play an important role in maintaining hemostasis, they promote [[thrombus]] growth and thus they prevent loss of blood. Moreover they enhance an immune response since platelets express the molecule [[CD154]] ([[CD40L]]). There are a few stimules activating platelets including inflammation, infection or injury and after their activation microvesicles containing CD154 are released from platelets. CD154 is a crucial molecule in development of T-cell dependent humoral immune response. Knockout mice in the [[gene]] for CD154 are incapable to produce [[IgG]], [[IgE]], [[IgA]] as a response to [[antigens]]. Microvesicles can also transfer [[prions]] and molecules CD41 and CXCR4.<ref>Sprague, D. L. ;Elzey, B. D. ;Crist, S. A. ;Waldschmidt, T. J. ;Jensen, R. J. ;Ratliff, T. L.

==Mechanism of shedding==
There are three mechanisms which lead to cell components release into the extracellular space. First of these mechanisms is exocytosis from multivesicular bodies and the formation of exosomes. Another mechanism is budding of microvesicles directly from a cytoplasmatic membrane and the last one is cell death leading to the formation of apoptotic bodies. These are all energy requiring processes. 

Under physiologic conditions, the plasma membrane of cells has an asymmetric distribution of [[phospholipids]]. [[Aminophospholipids]], [[phosphatidylserine]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine]] are specifically sequestered in the inner leaflet of the membrane. The transbilayer lipid distribution is under the control of three phospholipidic pumps: an inward-directed pump, or [[flippase]]; an outward-directed pump, or [[floppase]]; and a lipid [[scramblase]], responsible for non-specific redistribution of lipids across the membrane. 
After cell stimulation, including [[apoptosis]], a subsequent cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase promotes the loss of phospholipid asymmetry of the plasma membrane, subsequent [[phosphatidylserine]] exposure and a transient phospholipidic imbalance between the external leaflet at the expense of the inner leaflet leading to budding of the plasma membrane and microvesicles release.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1152/physiol.00029.2004}}</ref>

== Microvesicles and cancer ==
Evidence produced by independent research groups has demonstrated that microvesicles from the cells of healthy tissues, or selected miRNAs from these microvesicles, can be employed to reverse many tumors in pre-clinical cancer models, and may be used in combination with chemotherapy.<ref>Microvesicles (MVS) Derived From Adult Stem Cells For Use In The Therapeutic Treatment of a Tumor Disease. PCT/EP2011/052945 [http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2011107437&recNum=118&docAn=EP2011052945 Available online]</ref><ref>Human Liver Stem Cell-Derived Microvesicles Inhibit Hepatoma Growth in SCID Mice by Delivering Antitumor MicroRNAs. Camussi et al; STEM CELLS [2012,30][http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.1161/abstract Available online]</ref>

Conversely, microvesicles processed from a tumor cell are involved in the transport of cancer proteins and in delivering [[microRNA]] to the surrounding healthy tissue. It leads to a change of healthy cell phenotype and creating tumor environment. They play an importmant role in tumor [[angiogenesis]] and in the degradation of matrix due to the presence of [[metalloproteases]] which facilitate metastasis. They are also involved in intensification of the function of [[Regulatory T cell|regulatory T-lymphocytes]] and in the induction of apoptosis of [[cytotoxic T-lymphocytes]] because microvesicles released from a tumor cell contain [[Fas ligand]] and [[TRAIL]]. They prevent from  differentation of [[monocytes]] to [[dendritic cells]]. On the other hand microvesicles carry tumor [[antigen]] so they can be an instrument for developing tumor vaccinnes. Circulating [[miRNA]] and segments of [[DNA]] in  all [[body fluids]] can be potencial markers for tumor diagnostics.<ref>Muralidharan-Chari, V. ;Clancy, J. W. ;Sedgwick, A. ;D'Souza-Schorey, C. Microvesicles: mediators of extracellular communication during cancer progression. (2010). J Cell Sci. 123(Pt10):1603-11. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20445011/ Avalaible online]</ref>
For some reason the author(s) have omitted to mention the potential therapeutic role for microvesicles in the treatment of a tumor disease. I therefore think it's important to put this in, as otherwise readers may think that MV = Cancer - that may be true for MVs released from tumor (cancer) cells, but the evidence is quite the reverse in terms of MVs that are not ferried from cancerous cells.

== Microvesicles and intercellular communication ==
Scientists are actively researching the role that exosomes may play in cell-to-cell signaling, hypothesizing that because exosomes can merge with and release their contents into cells that are distant from their cell of origin, they may influence processes in the recipient cell. For example, RNA that is shuttled from one cell to another, known as "exosomal shuttle RNA," could potentially affect protein production in the recipient cell.<ref name="doi10.1038/ncomms1180"/><ref>{{cite journal

Currently, there are no proven mechanisms by which microvesicles trigger intercellular communication. Possible mechanisms by which microvesicles trigger intercellular communication are paracrine, fusion and phagocytosis.

== Microvesicles and Rheumatoid arthritis ==
[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] is a chronic systemic [[autoimmune disease]] characterized by inflammation of joints. In the early stage there are abundant [[Th17]] cells producing proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A, IL-17F, [[TNF]], IL-21,IL-22 in the [[synovial fluid]] and on the other hand [[Regulatory T cell|regulatory T-lymphocytes]] have a limited capability. In the late stage the extent of inflammation correlates with numbers of activated [[macrophages]] that considerably contribute to joint inflammation and bone and [[cartilages]] destruction because they have the ability to transform themselves into [[osteoclasts]] destructing bone tissue. Synthesis of [[reactive oxygen species]], [[proteases]] and [[prostaglandins]] by [[neutrophils]] is increased. Activation of platelets via collagen receptor GPVI stimulates the release of microparticules from platelet [[cytoplasmic membrane]]. These microparticles are detectable at a high level in [[synovial fluid]] and they promote joint inflammation  by transporting proinflammatory cytokine [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]]. There are also other ways how platelets contribute to the development of arthritis and it happens in a microparticle-independent manner. Platelets express [[Cyclooxygenase]] 1. Activated platelets promote [[phospholipase]] A2 activation which releases [[arachidonic acid]] from membrane [[phospholipids]]. [[Arachidonic acid]] is processed by [[Cyclooxygenase]] 1 and [[prostanoid]] precursor PGH2 is created. [[Prostanoid]] precursor PGH2 diffuses from platelets to neighbouring synovium [[fibroblast]] expressing [[prostacyclin]] synthase which results in the formation of proinflammatory [[prostacyclin]] PGI2. In [[rheumatoid arthritis]] pacient joints with elevated level of [[prostacyclin]] PGI2 was found.<ref>Boilard, E. ;Larabee, K. ;Shnayder, R. ;Jacobs, K. ;Farndale, R. W. ;Ware, J. ;Lee, D. M. Platelets participate in synovitis via Cox-1-dependent synthesis of prostacyclin independently of microparticle generation.(2011). J Immunol. 186(7):4361-6.

==Terminology==
Microvesicles are also referred to as exosomes, epididimosomes, argosomes, exosome-like vesicles, microparticles, promininosomes, prostasomes, dexosomes, texosomes, dex, tex, archeosomes and oncosomes.<ref name= "jedna" /> This confusion in terminology has led to typical exosome preparations sometimes being referred to as microvesicles and vice versa.
