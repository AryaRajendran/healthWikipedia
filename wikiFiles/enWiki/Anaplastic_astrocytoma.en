'''Anaplastic astrocytoma''' is a [[tumor grading|WHO grade 3]] type of [[astrocytoma]]. 

==Symptoms==
Initial presenting symptoms most commonly are headache, depressed mental status, focal neurological deficits, and/or seizures.<ref name=kennedy>Astrocytoma; Author: Benjamin Kennedy, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons;
Coauthor(s): Jeffrey N Bruce, MD, Edgar M Housepian Professor of Neurological Surgery Research, Professor of Neurological Surgery, Director of Brain Tumor Tissue Bank, Director of Bartoli Brain Tumor Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons; Jan 23 2009, http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/283453-overview</ref> The growth rate and mean interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is approximately 1.5â€“2 years but is highly variable,<ref name=kennedy/> being intermediate between that of low-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas.<ref name=kennedy/> Seizures are less common among patients with anaplastic astrocytomas compared to low-grade lesions. <ref name=kennedy/>

==Causes==
Most high-grade gliomas occur sporadically or without identifiable cause.<ref name=shb>[http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site565/mainpageS565P0.html Children's Hospital Boston > Anaplastic Astrocytoma.] Retrieved on August 2010</ref> However, a small proportion (less than 5%) of persons with malignant astrocytoma has a definite or suspected hereditary predisposition.<ref>[http://www.medlink.com/web_content/MLT000TZ.asp Malignant astrocytomas] By Edward J Dropcho MD. Contributing editor: Dr. Dropcho. Originally released November 11, 1996; last updated December 7, 2009</ref> The main hereditary predispositions are mainly [[neurofibromatosis type I]], [[Li-Fraumeni syndrome]], [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]] and [[tuberous sclerosis]].<ref name=shb/> Anaplastic astrocytomas have also been associated with previous exposure to [[vinyl chloride]] and to high doses of [[radiation therapy]] to the brain.<ref name=shb/>

==Treatment==
The standard initial treatment is to remove as much of the tumor as possible without worsening neurologic deficits. [[Radiation therapy]] has been shown to prolong survival and is a standard component of treatment. There is no proven benefit to adjuvant [[chemotherapy]] or supplementing other treatments for this kind of tumor. Although [[temozolomide]] is effective for treating recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma, its role as an adjuvant to radiation therapy has not been fully tested.

Quality of life after treatment depends heavily on the area of the brain that housed the tumor. In many cases, patients with anaplastic astrocytoma may experience various types of paralysis, speech impediments, difficulties planning and skewed sensory perception. Most cases of paralysis and speech difficulties can be rehabilitated with speech, occupational, physical, and vision therapy.

==Prognosis==
"Morbidity and mortality, as defined by the length of a patient's history and the odds of recurrence-free survival, are correlated most highly with the intrinsic properties of the astrocytoma in question. Typical ranges of survival are approximately . . . 2-5 years for those with anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III)[Benjamin Kennedy, MD and Jeffrey M Bruce, MD, "Astrocytoma," ''Medscape'' http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/283453-overview#a0199] Accessed November 27, 2012.
