A '''Schatzki ring''' or '''Schatzki-Gary ring''' is a narrowing of the lower part of the [[esophagus]] that can cause difficulty swallowing ([[dysphagia]]).  The narrowing is caused by a ring of [[mucosa]]l tissue (which lines the esophagus) or muscular tissue.<ref name="Schatzki">{{cite journal|first=Richard|last=Schatzki|authorlink=Richard Schatzki|coauthors=J.

Patients with Schatzki rings can develop intermittent difficulty swallowing or, more seriously, a completely blocked esophagus. The ring is named after the German-American physician [[Richard Schatzki]].

==Clinical presentation==
Not all patients with Schatzki rings have symptoms; [[barium swallow]] tests of the esophagus sometimes show Schatzki rings in patients with no swallowing difficulties.  When Schatzki rings cause symptoms, they usually result in episodic dysphagia with solid foods, or a sensation that the food "sticks" while swallowing, especially if the food is not chewed thoroughly.  Patients usually are able to [[Vomiting|regurgitate]] or force through the food material and resume eating. However, complete obstruction of the esophagus by a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] of food (often called [[Esophageal food bolus obstruction|steakhouse syndrome]]) can occur. This can cause crushing [[chest pain]] and may need immediate treatment with [[endoscopy]], which is the use of a specialized [[fiber optics|fibre-optic]] camera in order to remove the lodged food.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Stadler | first = J. | coauthors = A. H. Hölscher, H. Feussner, J. Dittler and J. R. Siewert | year = 1989 | month = December | title =The "steakhouse syndrome". Primary and definitive diagnosis and therapy | journal =  Surgical Endoscopy | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 195–8 | doi =10.1007/BF02171545 | pmid = 2623551 }}</ref>  After the obstruction is located, snares or [[forceps]] are inserted to pull the food out of the esophagus or to push it into the [[stomach]].  The latter is done with caution, usually when the anatomy of the structures around the obstruction is already known.

==Diagnosis==
A Schatzki ring is typically diagnosed by [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy]] or [[barium swallow]].  Endoscopy usually shows a ring within the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the esophagus which can be of variable size (see picture).  The ring is usually located a few centimetres above the [[gastro-esophageal junction]], where the esophagus joins the stomach.  Schatzki rings can often resemble a related entity called an [[esophageal web]].  Esophageal webs also contain extra mucosal tissue, but do not completely encircle the esophagus.

Endoscopies and barium swallows done for other reasons often reveal unsuspected Schatzki rings,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pezzullo | first = john C. | coauthors = [[Ann M. Lewicki]] | year = 2003 | month = September | title = Schatzki ring, statistically reexamined | journal = Radiology | volume = 228 | issue = 3 | pages = 609–13 | url =http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/228/3/609|accessdate=2006-07-20 | pmid = 12869689 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2283021162 }}</ref> meaning that many Schatzki rings are asymptomatic.

Two varieties of Schatzki rings have been described.  The original description by Schatzki and Gary was of a ring of fibrous tissue seen on autopsy; this is the less common type of Schatzki ring.<ref name="Schatzki"/>  More commonly, the ring consists of the same mucosal tissue that lines the entire esophagus.  Although many hypotheses have offered, the cause of Schatzki rings remains uncertain; both [[congenital]] and [[acquired]] factors may be involved.

==Treatment==
Asymptomatic Schatzki rings seldom worsen over time, and need no treatment.

Symptomatic Schatzki rings may be treated with [[esophageal dilatation]], using bougie or balloon dilators.  These have been found to be equally effective.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Scolapio | first = James S. | coauthors = Tousif M. Pasha, Christopher J. Gostout, Douglas W. Mahoney, Alan R. Zinsmeister, Beverly J. Ott and Keith D. Lindor | year = 1999 | month = July | title = A randomized prospective study comparing rigid to balloon dilators for benign esophageal strictures and rings | journal = Gastrointestinal Endoscopy | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–7 | doi =10.1016/S0016-5107(99)70337-8 | pmid = 10385715 }}</ref>  Bougie dilatation involves passage of long dilating tubes of increasing size down the esophagus to stretch the area of narrowing, either over a guidewire passed into the stomach by endoscopy (the ''Savary-Gillard'' system) or using [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-weighted dilators (the ''Maloney'' system).  This is usually done with [[intravenous]] [[sedation]] to reduce discomfort.  Dilatation can produce some temporary irritation.  A short course of [[proton pump inhibitor]] therapy may decrease aggravation by [[gastroesophageal reflux|stomach acid reflux]] into the esophagus. The duration of the benefit of dilation varies, but may be from months to years.  Dilation may be repeated if narrowing recurs.

==Epidemiology==
About 6 to 14 percent of patients that receive a routine [[barium swallow]] test of the esophagus are found to have a Schatzki ring.<ref>{{cite journal|last=KEYTING|first=WS|coauthors=BAKER, GM; MCCARVER, RR; DAYWITT, AL|title=The lower esophagus.|journal=The American journal of roentgenology, radium therapy, and nuclear medicine|date=1960 Dec|volume=84|pages=1070-5|pmid=13752844}}</ref> 

==Other associations==
*Schatzki rings can be associated with ''swallowing syncope'', a rare variety of [[Fainting|syncope]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Gawrieh | first = Samer | coauthors = Ty Carroll, Walter J.
