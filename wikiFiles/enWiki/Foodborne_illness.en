'''Foodborne illness''' (also '''foodborne disease''' and colloquially referred to as '''food poisoning''')<ref>
{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952820|food poisoning}}
</ref> is any [[illness]] resulting from the consumption of [[Food spoilage|contaminated food]], [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, or [[parasite]]s that contaminate food,<ref>
[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/foodborneinfections_g.htm US CDC food poisoning guide]
</ref> as well as chemical or natural [[toxin]]s such as [[poisonous mushrooms]].

==Causes==
{{see also|Pathogen}}
[[File:Foodinfridgetext.jpg|thumb|Poorly stored food in a refrigerator]]
Foodborne illness usually arises from improper handling, preparation, or [[food storage]]. Good [[hygiene]] practices before, during, and after food preparation can reduce the chances of contracting an illness. There is a consensus in the public health community that regular hand-washing is one of the most effective defenses against the spread of foodborne illness. The action of monitoring food to ensure that it will not cause foodborne illness is known as '''[[food safety]]'''. Foodborne disease can also be caused by a large variety of toxins that affect the environment. For foodborne illness caused by chemicals, see [[Food contaminants]].

Foodborne illness can also be caused by [[pesticide]]s or [[medicine]]s in food and naturally toxic substances such as [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushrooms]] or [[tetrodotoxin|reef fish]].

===Bacteria===
[[Bacteria]] are a common cause of foodborne illness. In the [[United Kingdom]] during 2000, the individual bacteria involved were the following: ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' 77.3%, ''[[Salmonella]]'' 20.9%, ''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7]]'' 1.4%, and all others less than 0.56%.<ref>
[http://www.food.gov.uk/science/sciencetopics/microbiology/58736 Food Standards Agency]
</ref>  In the past, bacterial infections were thought to be more prevalent because few places had the capability to test for [[norovirus]] and no active surveillance was being done for this particular agent. Toxins for bacterial infections are delayed because the bacteria need time to multiply. Their symptoms are usually not seen until 12–72 hours or mainly the day after it is ingested and digests completely,more after eating contaminated food.

'''Most common''' bacterial foodborne pathogens are:
*''[[Campylobacter|Campylobacter jejuni]]'' which can lead to secondary [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] and [[periodontitis]]<ref name=cazp>

*''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7]]'' enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) which can cause [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]

Other '''common''' bacterial foodborne pathogens are:
*''[[Bacillus cereus]]''
*''[[Escherichia coli]]'', other [[Virulence properties of escherichia coli|virulence properties]], such as enteroinvasive (EIEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC or EAgEC)

*''[[Vibrio parahaemolyticus]]''
*''[[Vibrio vulnificus]]''
*''[[Yersinia enterocolitica]]'' and ''[[Yersinia pseudotuberculosis]]''

'''Less common''' bacterial agents:
*''[[Brucella]]'' spp.
*''[[Actinobacteria|Corynebacterium ulcerans]]''
*''[[Q fever|Coxiella burnetii]]'' or Q fever
*''[[Plesiomonas shigelloides]]''

====Exotoxins====
In addition to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses are caused by [[exotoxin]]s which are [[excretion|excreted]] by the cell as the bacterium grows. Exotoxins can produce illness even when the microbes that produced them have been killed. Symptoms typically appear after 24 hours depending on the amount of toxin ingested.

*''[[Clostridium botulinum]]''
*''[[Clostridium perfringens]]''
*''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''
*''[[Bacillus cereus]]''

For example ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' produces a toxin that causes intense [[vomiting]]. The rare but potentially deadly disease [[botulism]] occurs when the [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacterium ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' grows in improperly canned low-acid foods and produces [[botulin]], a powerful paralytic toxin.

Pseudoalteromonas tetraodonis, certain species of [[Pseudomonas]] and [[Vibrio]], and some other bacteria, produce the lethal [[tetrodotoxin]], which is present in the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of some living animal species rather than being a product of [[decomposition]].

=== Mycotoxins and alimentary mycotoxicoses ===
The term '''alimentary mycotoxicoses''' refers to the effect of poisoning by [[Mycotoxins]] through food consumption.  [[Mycotoxins]] sometimes have important effects on human and animal health.  For example, an outbreak which occurred in the UK in 1960 caused the death of 100,000 turkeys which had consumed [[aflatoxin]]-contaminated peanut meal.  In the [[USSR]] in [[World War II]], 5,000 people died due to Alimentary Toxic Aleukia (ALA).<ref name=fam>

The pronounced forms of [[Aflatoxins]] are those of B1, B2, G1, and G2, amongst which Aflatoxin B1 predominantly targets the liver, which will result in [[necrosis]], [[cirrhosis]], and [[carcinoma]].<ref name=afltx>

====Emerging foodborne pathogens====
Many foodborne illnesses remain poorly understood. Approximately sixty percent of outbreaks are caused by unknown sources.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

====Preventing bacterial food poisoning====
[[File:Kingfish great south bay.jpg|thumb|Proper storage and [[refrigeration]] of [[food]] help in the prevention of food poisoning]]
Prevention is mainly the role of the state, through the definition of strict rules of [[hygiene]] and a [[public services]] of [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] surveying of animal products in the food chain, from [[farming]] to the transformation industry and delivery (shops and [[restaurant]]s). This regulation includes:
* [[traceability]]: in a final product, it must be possible to know the origin of the ingredients (originating farm, identification of the harvesting or of the animal) and where and when it was processed; the origin of the illness can thus be tracked and solved (and possibly penalized), and the final products can be removed from the sale if a problem is detected;
* enforcement of hygiene procedures such as [[HACCP]] and the "[[cold chain]]";
* power of control and of law enforcement of [[veterinarian]]s.

In August 2006, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[Phage therapy]] which involves spraying meat with viruses that infect bacteria, and thus preventing infection. This has raised concerns, because without [[mandatory labelling]] consumers would not be aware that meat and poultry products have been treated with the spray.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/business/healthcare/feeds/ap/2006/08/18/ap2959720.html }} {{Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

At home, prevention mainly consists of good [[food safety]] practices. Many forms of bacterial poisoning can be prevented even if food is contaminated by cooking it sufficiently, and either eating it quickly or refrigerating it effectively{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. Many toxins, however, are not destroyed by heat treatment.

===Viruses===
[[Virus|Viral]] infections make up perhaps one third of cases of food poisoning in developed countries. In the US, more than 50% of cases are viral and [[Norwalk virus group|noroviruses]] are the most common foodborne illness, causing 57% of outbreaks in 2004. Foodborne viral infection are usually of intermediate (1–3 days) [[incubation period]], causing illnesses which are self-limited in otherwise healthy individuals; they are similar to the bacterial forms described above.
* [[Enterovirus]]
* [[Hepatitis A]] is distinguished from other viral causes by its prolonged (2–6 week) [[incubation period]] and its ability to spread beyond the stomach and intestines into the [[liver]]. It often results in [[jaundice]], or yellowing of the skin, but rarely leads to chronic liver dysfunction. The virus has been found to cause infection due to the consumption of fresh-cut produce which has fecal contamination.<ref name=ivcma>

===Natural toxins===
Several foods can naturally contain [[toxins]], many of which are not produced by bacteria. Plants in particular may be toxic; animals which are naturally poisonous to eat are rare. In evolutionary terms, animals can escape being eaten by fleeing; plants can use only passive defenses such as poisons and distasteful substances, for example [[capsaicin]] in [[chili pepper]]s and pungent [[sulfur]] compounds in [[garlic]] and [[onion]]s. Most animal poisons are not synthesised by the animal, but acquired by eating poisonous plants to which the animal is immune, or by bacterial action.
* [[Alkaloid]]s
* [[Ciguatera poisoning]]
* [[Grayanotoxin]] ([[honey]] intoxication)
* [[Mushroom poisoning|Mushroom]] toxins
* [[Phytohaemagglutinin]] (red [[kidney bean]] poisoning; destroyed by boiling)
* [[Pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s
* Shellfish toxin, including [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, [[domoic acid|amnesic shellfish poisoning]] and [[ciguatera]] fish poisoning
* [[Scombrotoxin]]
* [[Tetrodotoxin]] ([[fugu fish]] poisoning)

Some plants contain substances which are toxic in large doses, but have therapeutic properties in appropriate dosages.
* [[Foxglove]] contains [[cardiac glycosides]].
* Poisonous hemlock ([[conium]]) has medicinal uses.

===Other pathogenic agents===
* [[Prion]]s, resulting in [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]]

==="Ptomaine poisoning"===
An early theory on the causes of food poisoning involved ''ptomaines'' (from Greek ''ptōma'',  "fall, fallen body, corpse"), [[alkaloid]]s found in decaying animal and vegetable matter.  While some alkaloids do cause poisoning, the discovery of bacteria left the ptomaine theory obsolete, though as recently as 1882 the ptomaine was thought of as [[bacteria]], while [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]] "special [[alkaloids]]" produced by the "[[comma]] [[bacillus]]".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=uEBYAAAAMAAJ&q=cadaverine&dq=cadaverine&hl=en&ei=J7OmTtDXCozWsgaMwPS_DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCTgK Merck's bulletin, Volume 5, William Henry Porter 1892]</ref>

==Mechanism==
===Incubation period===
The delay between consumption of a contaminated food and appearance of the first [[symptom]]s of illness is called the [[incubation period]]. This ranges from hours to days (and rarely months or even years, such as in the case of [[Listeriosis]] or [[Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease]]), depending on the agent, and on how much was consumed. If symptoms occur within 1–6 hours after eating the food, it suggests that it is caused by a bacterial toxin or a chemical rather than live bacteria.

The long incubation period of many foodborne illnesses tends to cause sufferers to attribute their symptoms to [[stomach flu]].

During the incubation period, [[microbe]]s pass through the [[stomach]] into the [[intestine]], attach to the [[cell (biology)|cells]] lining the intestinal walls, and begin to multiply there. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine, some produce a [[toxin]] that is absorbed into the [[blood]]stream, and some can directly invade the deeper body tissues. The symptoms produced depend on the type of microbe.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/food/index.htm |title=Food-Related Diseases}}
</ref>

===Infectious dose===
The [[infectious dose]] is the amount of agent that must be consumed to give rise to symptoms of foodborne illness, and varies according to the agent and the consumer's age and overall health. In the case of ''[[Salmonella]]'' a relatively large inoculum of 1 million to 1 billion organisms is necessary to produce symptoms in healthy human volunteers [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic515.htm], as ''Salmonellae'' are very sensitive to acid. An unusually high stomach [[pH]] level (low acidity) greatly reduces the number of bacteria required to cause symptoms by a factor of between 10 and 100.

===Physical contact===
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some foodborne illnesses, such as E-Coli, can also be transmitted through physical contact with an infected person or animal.<ref>{{cite web|title=E. coli (Escherichia coli)|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/general/index.html/|publisher=CDC|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>  In the United States, a 6 year old girl died after contracting E.Coli by kissing her grandfather on the cheek, who was in rehabilitation after eating an E.Coli infected burger a few weeks prior.<ref>{{cite news|last=Armour|first=Stephanie|title=Girl Dies After Kissing Grandfather Sick With Burger E.coli|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-11/girl-dies-after-kissing-grandfather-sick-with-burger-e-coli.html|accessdate=16 October 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=11 October 2012}}</ref>

</ref>
* 18,000 hospitalizations
* 120 deaths
* 2.1 million lost days off work
* 1.2 million doctor consultations
* 300,000 prescriptions for antibiotics

===Outbreaks===
{{Main|Deadliest foodborne illness incidents}}
The vast majority of reported cases of foodborne illness occur as individual or sporadic cases. The origin of most sporadic cases is undetermined. In the United States, where people eat outside the home frequently, 58% of cases originate from commercial food facilities (2004 FoodNet data).   An outbreak is defined as occurring when two or more people experience similar illness after consuming food from a common source.

Often, a combination of events contributes to an outbreak, for example, food might be left at room temperature for many hours, allowing bacteria to [[multiplication|multiply]] which is compounded by inadequate cooking which results in a failure to kill the dangerously elevated bacterial levels.

Outbreaks are usually identified when those affected know each other. However, more and more, outbreaks are identified by [[public health]] staff from unexpected increases in laboratory results for certain strains of bacteria. Outbreak detection and investigation in the United States is primarily handled by local health jurisdictions and is inconsistent from district to district. It is estimated that 1–2% of outbreaks are detected.

==Society and culture==
===Global impact===
{{duplication|date=April 2013}}
Many outbreaks of foodborne diseases that were once contained within a small community may now take place on global dimensions. [[Food safety]] authorities all over the world have acknowledged that ensuring food safety must not only be tackled at the national level but also through closer linkages among food safety authorities at the international level. This is important for exchanging routine information on food safety issues and to have rapid access to information in case of food safety emergencies.{{facts|date=August 2012}}

It is difficult to estimate the global incidence of foodborne disease, but it has been reported that in the year 2000 about 2.1 million people died from [[diarrhoeal diseases]].{{facts|date=April 2013}} Many of these cases have been attributed to contamination of food and drinking water. Additionally, [[diarrhea]] is a major cause of malnutrition in infants and young children.

Even in industrialized countries, up to 30% of the population of people have been reported to suffer from foodborne diseases every year. In the U.S, around 76 million cases of foodborne diseases, which resulted in 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths, are estimated to occur each year. Developing countries in particular are worst affected by foodborne illnesses due to the presence of a wide range of diseases, including those caused by parasites. Foodborne illnesses can and did inflict serious and extensive harm on society. In 1994, an outbreak of salmonellosis due to contaminated ice cream occurred in the USA, affecting an estimated 224,000 persons. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A, resulting from the consumption of contaminated clams, affected some 300,000 individuals in China. <ref>" [http://www.sibioc.it/upload/bc/26/4/notizieWHO.pdf World Health Organization]</ref>

Food contamination creates an enormous social and economic strain on societies. In the U.S., diseases caused by the major pathogens alone are estimated to cost up to US $35 billion annually (1997) in medical costs and lost productivity. The re-emergence of cholera in Peru in 1991 resulted in the loss of US $500 million in fish and fishery product exports that year.{{facts|date=August 2012}}

Foodborne illness may carry long-term effects.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=food-poisonings-hidden-legacy Most people think of foodborne illness as an unpleasant few days of fever and diarrhea, but for some there may be lifelong consequences] March 29, 2012</ref>

===United Kingdom===

In postwar Aberdeen (1964) a large scale (>400 cases) outbreak of [[Typhoid]] occurred, this was caused by contaminated [[corned beef]] which had been imported from [[Argentina]]<ref>
David F. Smith, H. Lesley Diack, and T. Hugh Pennington: ''Food Poisoning, Policy and Politics : Corned Beef and Typhoid in Britain in the 1960s'', Boydell Press, July 15, 2005, ISBN 1-84383-138-4
</ref> The corned beef was placed in cans and because the cooling plant had failed, cold river water from the [[Río de la Plata|Plate estuary]] was used to cool the cans. One of the cans had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. This meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, and a lack of cleaning the machinery led to spreading the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. These meats were then eaten by the people of Aberdeen who then became ill.

In the UK serious outbreaks of food-borne illness since the 1970s prompted key changes in UK [[food safety]] law. These included the death of 19 patients in the Stanley Royd Hospital outbreak [http://briandeer.com/social/stanley-royd.htm] and the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, mad cow disease) outbreak identified in the 1980s. The death of 17 people in the 1996 Wishaw outbreak of E. coli O157 [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w4/pgr-00.htm] was a precursor to the establishment of the [[Food Standards Agency]] which, according to [[Tony Blair]] in the 1998 [[white paper]]  [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/maffdh/fsa/fsa.htm ''A Force for Change'' Cm 3830] "would be powerful, open and dedicated to the interests of consumers".

===United States===
Each year in the U.S. 31 major food borne pathogens cause 9.4 million cases of food borne illness, 55,961 hospitalizations, and 2612 deaths.<ref name=CDC11Spec/> 

In 2001, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] petitioned the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to require meat packers to remove [[spinal cord]]s before processing cattle carcasses for human consumption, a measure designed to lessen the risk of infection by variant [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]]. The petition was supported by the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[Consumer Federation of America]], the [[Government Accountability Project]], the [[National Consumers League]], and Safe Tables Our Priority. This was opposed by the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]], the National Renderers Association, the [[National Meat Association]], the Pork Producers Council, sheep raisers, milk producers, the Turkey Federation, and eight other organizations from the animal-derived food industry. This was part of a larger controversy regarding the United States' violation of [[World Health Organization]] proscriptions to lessen the risk of infection by variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

None of the US Department of Health and Human Services targets<ref>[http://www.healthypeople.gov Healthy People 2010 Home Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> regarding incidence of foodborne infections was reached in 2007.<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Preliminary FoodNet data on the incidence of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food—10 states, 2007 |journal=MMWR Morb.

===Organizations===

The [[World Health Organization]] Food Safety Department provides scientific advice for organizations and the public on issues concerning the safety of food. It serves as a medium linking the [[food safety]] systems in countries around the world. Food safety is currently one of WHO's top ten priorities.{{fact|date=August 2012}}

The Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases is a department under the WHO. Its mission is to reduce the serious negative impact of foodborne diseases worldwide. According to the WHO website, food and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases are leading causes of illness and death in less developed countries, killing approximately 3.8 million people annually, most of whom are children. {{quote|WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain--from production to consumption--using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.}}{{facts|date=August 2012}}

The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) is intended to complement and support the existing WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) which includes a Chemical Alert and Response component.{{facts|date=August 2012}}

===Regulatory steps===

Food may be contaminated during all stages of food production and retailing. In order to prevent viral contamination, regulatory authorities in Europe have enacted several measures:

* European Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005
* [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN): Standard method for the detection of norovirus and hepatitis A virus in food products (shellfish, fruits and vegetables, surfaces and bottled water)
* CODEX Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH): Guideline for the application of general principles of food hygiene for the control of viruses in food<ref>[http://newsletter.sgs.com/eNewsletterPro/uploadedimages/000006/sgs-cts-consumer-compact-v7-en-may-2012.pdf Viral agents in food - The overlooked risk] SGS Consumer Compact Bulletin, Retrieved 11/13/2012</ref>
