'''Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency type 1''' is also called myoadenylate deaminase deficiency. It a [[recessive]] [[genetics|genetic]] [[metabolic disorder]] that affects approximately 1–2% of populations of European descent.<ref name=ghr2008>{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/adenosine-monophosphate-deaminase-deficiency |title=Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency |work=Genetics Home Reference |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |month=July |year=2008}}</ref> It appears to be considerably rarer in Asian populations.<ref name=ghr2008/> The genetic form is caused by a defect in the gene for [[AMP deaminase]]<ref name=ghr2008/> though there is also an acquired form of AMP deficiency.

==Causes==
[[AMP deaminase]] is an [[enzyme]] that converts [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) to [[inosine monophosphate]] (IMP), freeing an [[ammonia]] molecule in the process. It is a part of the [[metabolic process]] that converts [[sugar]], [[fat]], and [[protein]] into cellular energy. In order to use energy, a [[cell (biology)|cell]] converts one of the above fuels into [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) via the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]]. Cellular processes, especially [[muscle]]s, then convert the ATP into [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP), freeing the energy to do work.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

During heavy or prolonged mild to moderate activity, other enzymes convert two molecules of ADP into one ATP molecule and one AMP molecule, making more ATP available to supply energy. AMP is normally converted into IMP by myoadenylate deaminase — so myoadenylate deaminase deficiency reduces energy that would be available to the cell through the [[Purine nucleotide cycle]]. Normally, excess AMP builds up in the cell and is eventually metabolized in the liver. In persons with a defective enzyme, [[5'-nucleotidase]] removes the ribose and phosphorus from AMP, increasing levels of cellular and circulating adenosine by 16x - 25x.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=720–30 |doi=10.1172/JCI111265 |title=Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency.

==Effects of failure to deaminate the AMP molecules==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
This failure to [[Deamination|deaminate]] the AMP molecules has three major effects.  First, significant amounts of AMP are lost from the cell and the body.  Second, ammonia is not freed when the cell does work.  Third, the level of IMP in the cell is not maintained.

* The first effect—the loss of AMP—is mostly significant because AMP contains [[ribose]], a sugar molecule that is also used to make [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and some [[enzyme]]s.  Though the body can manufacture some ribose and obtain more from RNA-rich sources such as beans and red meat, this loss of ribose due to MADD is sometimes sufficient to create a shortage in the body, resulting in symptoms of severe fatigue and muscle pain. This outcome is especially likely if the individual regularly exercises vigorously or works physically over a period of weeks or months.

* The second effect, the absence of ammonia, is not well understood. It may result in a reduction of the amount of [[fumarate]] available to the [[citric acid cycle]], and it may result in lower levels of [[nitric oxide]] (a [[vasodilator]]) in the body, reducing blood flow and [[oxygen]] intake during vigorous exercise, though this may be offset by increased levels of adenosine, another vasodilator.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9576114 |title=Role of nitric oxide in adenosine-induced vasodilation in humans | volume=31 | issue=5 |year=1998 |month=May |author=Costa F, Biaggioni I |journal=Hypertension |pages=1061–4}}</ref>

* The third effect, the reduction in IMP, is also not well understood. It may somehow result in a reduction in the amount of [[lactic acid]] produced by the muscles, though serum lactate is typically slightly elevated with MADD.

==Symptoms==
The majority of people with the AMPD gene are [[asymptomatic]], but others have symptoms  including early fatigue, muscle pain and muscle cramping.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mda.org/disease/mad.html |title=Myoadenylate Deaminase Deficiency |publisher=[[Muscular Dystrophy Association]]}}</ref>

;Fatigue
* MADD lowers aerobic power output, so increased anaerobic power is needed to perform the same amount of work.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Without myoadenlyate deaminase, heavy activity causes adenosine to be released into the cell or perfused into the surrounding tissues. Fatigue and sedation after heavy exertion can be caused by excess adenosine in the cells which signals muscle fiber to feel fatigued. In the brain, excess adenosine decreases alertness and causes sleepiness. In this way, adenosine may play a role in fatigue from MADD.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18409530 |year=2008 |last1=Morisaki |first1=H |last2=Morisaki |first2=T |title=AMPD genes and urate metabolism |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=771–7 |journal=Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine}}</ref>
* Recovery from over-exertion can be hours, days or even months. In cases of [[rhabdomyolysis]], which is the rapid breakdown of muscle fibers, time to recovery is dependent on duration and intensity of original activity plus any excess activity during the recovery period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

;Muscle pain
* Muscle pain from MADD is not well understood, but is partially due to high levels of lactate. Increased levels of free adenosine temporarily decrease pain, allowing over exertion without awareness.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7573999 |year=1995 |last1=Belfrage |first1=Måns |last2=Sollevi |first2=Alf |last3=Segerdahl |first3=Märta |last4=Sjölund |first4=Karl-Fredrik |last5=Hansson |first5=Per |title=Systemic Adenosine Infusion Alleviates Spontaneous and Stimulus Evoked Pain in Patients with Peripheral Neuropathic Pain |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=713–7 |journal=Anesthesia & Analgesia |url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7573999}}</ref> The over exertion can cause mild to severe cases of rhabdomyolysis which is painful.<ref name=mdafacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.mdausa.org/publications/PDFs/FactsAboutMetabolicDisease.pdf |title=Facts About Metabolic Diseases of Muscle |publisher=[[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] |month=December |year=2009}}</ref>

* Adenosine mediates pain through [[adenosine receptors]]. MADD causes an increase of free adenosine during heavy activity which may cause exercise-induced muscle pain. Over time, excess free adenosine down-regulates primary A1 adenosine receptors, leading to increased muscle pain. Secondary receptors (A3) increase peripheral inflammation which also increases pain.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=956–61 |doi=10.1097/00000542-200404000-00028 |title=Repeated Dosing with Oral Allosteric Modulator of Adenosine A1 Receptor Produces Tolerance in Rats with Neuropathic Pain |year=2004 |last1=Li |first1=Xinhui |last2=Bantel |first2=Carsten |last3=Conklin |first3=Dawn |last4=Childers |first4=Steven R. |last5=Eisenach |first5=James C. |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=100 |issue=4 |pmid=15087633}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ddr.10170 |title=Consequences of eliminating adenosine A1 receptors in mice |year=2003 |last1=Fredholm |first1=Bertil B. |last2=Halldner |first2=Linda |last3=Johansson |first3=Catarina |last4=Schulte |first4=Gunnar |last5=Lövdahl |first5=Cecilia |last6=Thorén |first6=Peter |last7=Dunwiddie |first7=Thomas V. |last8=Masino |first8=Susan A. |last9=Poelchen |first9=Wolfgang |journal=Drug Development Research |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=350–3}}</ref>

;Muscle cramping
* Cause of cramping is unknown, but may be related to elevated lactate, increased calcium signaling across the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] caused by membrane instability from reduced levels of ATP, or increased levels of free adenosine.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10567080 |title=Adenosine inhibits depolarization-induced Ca(2+) release in mammalian skeletal muscle. | volume=22 | issue=12 |year=1999 |month=December |author=Blazev R, Lamb GD |journal=Muscle Nerve |pages=1674–83|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199912)22:12%3C1674::AID-MUS9%3E3.0.CO;2-0}}</ref>

;Muscle weakness
* Muscle weakness is not a major symptom, though the progressive effects of chronic muscle damage from rhabdomyolysis will eventually cause significant weakness. Similarly, the long-term metabolic effects may result in nerve damage.<ref name=mdafacts/>

==Treatment==
It is important for MADD patients to maintain strength and fitness without exercising or working to exhaustion. Learning this balance may be more difficult than normally, as muscle pain and fatigue may be perceived differently than normal individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://web.squ.edu.om/med-Lib/MED_CD/E_CDs/health%20development/html/clients/WAWFSA/html/papers/pap001.htm |title=What is this Adenosine stuff? |first=Robert |last=Lang |year=1998 |journal=Australasian Anaesthesia |issn=1032-2515}}</ref>

Symptomatic relief from the effects of MADD may sometimes be achieved by administering [[ribose]] orally at a dose of approximately 10&nbsp;grams per 100 pounds (0.2 g/kg) of body weight per day. and exercise modulation as appropriate. Taken hourly, ribose provides a direct but limited source of energy for the cells. Patients with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency do not retain ribose during heavy exercise, so supplementation may be required to rebuild levels of ATP.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=297–302 |doi=10.1159/000177660 |title=Effects of Oral Ribose on Muscle Metabolism during Bicycle Ergometer in AMPD-Deficient Patients |year=1991 |last1=Wagner |first1=D.R. |last2=Gresser |first2=U. |last3=Zöllner |first3=N. |journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism |volume=35 |issue=5 |pmid=1776826}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=1281–90 |doi=10.1007/BF01785710 |title=Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency: Successful symptomatic therapy by high dose oral administration of ribose |year=1986 |last1=Zöllner |first1=N. |last2=Reiter |first2=S. |last3=Gross |first3=M. |last4=Pongratz |first4=D. |last5=Reimers |first5=C.

[[Creatine monohydrate]] is also helpful for AMPD patients, as it provides an alternative source of energy for anaerobic muscle tissue.<ref>{{cite book |pmid=18652078 |year=2007 |last1=Tarnopolsky |first1=Mark A. |chapter=Clinical Use of Creatine in Neuromuscular and Neurometabolic Disorders |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=HjU1FYjjoRcC&pg=PA182 |volume=46 |pages=183–204 |title=Creatine and Creatine Kinase in Health and Disease |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6486-9_10 |series=Subcellular Biochemistry |isbn=978-1-4020-6485-2 |editor1-first=Gajja S. |editor1-last=Salomons |editor2-first=Markus |editor2-last=Wyss}}</ref>
There is also clinical association of various muscular dystrophies with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which needs further clinical study for confirmation.

==Potential Complications==
There is an increased risk that [[statin]] (cholesterol reducing drugs) will cause [[myopathy]] (muscle weakness) in individuals with MADD.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=153–62 |doi=10.1002/mus.20567 |title=Genetic risk factors associated with lipid-lowering drug-induced myopathies |year=2006 |last1=Vladutiu |first1=Georgirene D. |last2=Simmons |first2=Zachary |last3=Isackson |first3=Paul J. |last4=Tarnopolsky |first4=Mark |last5=Peltier |first5=Wendy L. |last6=Barboi |first6=Alexandru C. |last7=Sripathi |first7=Naganand |last8=Wortmann |first8=Robert L. |last9=Phillips |first9=Paul S. |journal=Muscle & Nerve |volume=34 |issue=2 |pmid=16671104}}</ref>

Anesthesia has the potential to cause [[malignant hyperthermia]], an uncontrolled increase in body temperature, and permanent muscle damage in patients with MADD. Individuals with MADD are advised to notify their an anesthesiologist about their condition prior to surgery.<ref name=mdafacts/>

In most where [[myopathy]] is present with MADD, a second muscle disease is present and symptoms are worse than either disease in isolation.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=10–8 |doi=10.1006/mgme.2000.3066 |title=Synergistic Heterozygosity: Disease Resulting from Multiple Partial Defects in One or More Metabolic Pathways |year=2000 |last1=Vockley |first1=Jerry |last2=Rinaldo |first2=Piero |last3=Bennett |first3=Michael J. |last4=Matern |first4=Dietrich |last5=Vladutiu |first5=Georgirene D. |journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism |volume=71 |pmid=11001791 |issue=1–2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=185–94 |doi=10.1016/S0733-8619(05)70184-5 |title=MYOADENYLATE DEAMINASE DEFICIENCY: A Common Inherited Defect with Heterogeneous Clinical Presentation |year=2000 |last1=Sabina |first1=Richard L. |journal=Neurologic Clinics |volume=18 |pmid=10658174 |issue=1}}</ref>
