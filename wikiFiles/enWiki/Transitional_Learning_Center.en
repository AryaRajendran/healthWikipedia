The '''Transitional Learning Center''' '''(TLC)''' is a post-acute [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]] [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] facility headquartered in the island city of [[Galveston, Texas]]. It was started by the non-profit [[Moody Foundation]] in 1982, in response to a brain injury suffered by a son of trustee [[Robert L. Moody]]. The center provides survivors of acute brain injury with rehabilitation services needed to help patients overcome their injuries and regain independence.  In order to provide additional space for post-acute brain injury rehabilitation, in 2008 the center opened a branch facility in [[Lubbock, Texas]], to help serve needs of people throughout the southwest United States.<ref>[http://www.tlcrehab.org/newsarchives/1202181413.pdf TLC to open post-acute brain injury rehabilitation program in Lubbock]</ref>
