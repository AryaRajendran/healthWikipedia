The '''caudate nucleus''' is a [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nucleus]] located within the [[basal ganglia]] of the [[brain]]s of many animal species. The caudate nucleus is an important part of the brain's learning and memory system.

==Anatomy==
[[File:Caudate nucleus.gif|left|thumb|180px|Caudate nucleus within the skull]]
The caudate nuclei are located near the center of the brain, sitting astride the [[thalamus]]. There is a caudate nucleus within each [[Cerebral hemispheres|hemisphere]] of the brain. Individually, they resemble a C-shape structure with a wider "head" (''caput'' in Latin) at the front, tapering to a "body" (''corpus'') and a "tail" (''cauda''). Sometimes a part of the caudate nucleus is referred to as the "knee" (''genu'').<ref>E. H. Yeterian, D. N. Pandya, "Corticostriatal connections of extrastriate visual areas in rhesus monkeys," ''[[The Journal of Comparative Neurology]]'' '''352'''(3):436-457, 1995. PMID: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7706560&query_hl=6&itool=pubmed_docsum 7706560]</ref>

[[File:Caudate Nucleus Structural MRI.png|thumb|180px|alt=This is a transverse view of the caudate nucleus from a structural MR image.|Transverse view of the caudate nucleus from a structural [[MRI|MR image]]]]
The head and body of the caudate nucleus form part of the floor of the anterior horn of the [[lateral ventricle]]. After the body travels briefly towards the back of the head, the tail curves back toward the anterior, forming the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. This means that a coronal (on a plane parallel to the [[face]]) section that cuts through the tail will also cross the body and head of the caudate nucleus.

The caudate nucleus is related anatomically to a number of other structures. It is separated from the [[lenticular nucleus]] (made up of the [[globus pallidus]] and the [[putamen]]) by the anterior limb of the [[internal capsule]]. Together the caudate and putamen form the dorsal [[striatum]].

==Neurochemistry==
The caudate nucleus is highly innervated by [[dopamine]] [[neurons]]. These neurons originate mainly from the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) and the [[substantia nigra|substantia nigra pars compacta]] (SNc). There are also additional inputs from various [[association cortex|association cortices]].

==Physiology==

===Learning and memory===
Historically, the basal ganglia as a whole have been implicated in higher-order motor control.<ref>{{Cite journal

The caudate nucleus was initially thought to primarily be involved with control of voluntary movement. More recently, it has been demonstrated that the caudate is highly involved in learning and memory,<ref>Graybiel AM (2005) The basal ganglia: learning new tricks and loving it. Curr Opin Neurobiol 15:638-644.</ref> particularly regarding feedback processing.<ref>Packard MG, Knowlton BJ (2002) [http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~ahrens/tnii/packard%20and%20knowlton%202002.pdf Learning and memory functions of the Basal Ganglia]. Annu Rev Neurosci 25:563-593.</ref> In general, it has been demonstrated that neural activity will be present within the caudate while an individual is receiving feedback. People with [[hyperthymesia]] appear to have slight increases in the sizes of the caudate nucleus as well as of the [[temporal lobe]] of the cortex.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/16/60minutes/main7156877.shtml | work=CBS News | title=The Gift of Endless Memory | date=16 December 2010}}</ref>

===Emotion===

The caudate nucleus has been implicated in responses to visual beauty, and has been suggested as one of the "neural correlates of romantic love".<ref>{{Cite journal

===Language comprehension===
The left caudate in particular has been suggested to have a relationship with the [[thalamus]] that governs the comprehension and articulation of words as they are switched between languages.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9304-how-bilingual-brains-switch-between-tongues.html "How bilingual brains switch between tongues" at newscientist.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/312/5779/1537?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT "Language Control in the Bilingual Brain " at sciencemag.org]</ref>

===Threshold control===
The brain contains large collections of neurons reciprocally connected by [[excitatory synapses]], thus forming large network of elements with [[positive feedback]]. It is difficult to see how such a system can operate without some mechanism to prevent explosive activation. There is some indirect evidence<ref>Braitenberg V. (1984)Vehicles. Experiments in synthetic psychology.</ref> that the caudate may perform this regulatory role by measuring the general activity of [[cerebral cortex]] and controlling the [[threshold potential]].

===Role in obsessive compulsive disorder===
It has been theorized that the caudate nucleus may be dysfunctional in persons with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD), in that it may perhaps be unable to properly regulate the transmission of information regarding worrying events or ideas between the [[thalamus]] and the [[orbitofrontal cortex]].

A [[neuroimaging]] study with [[positron emission tomography]] found that the right caudate nucleus had the largest change in glucose metabolism after patients had been treated with [[paroxetine]].<ref>{{Cite journal
