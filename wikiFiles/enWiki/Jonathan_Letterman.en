'''Jonathan Letterman'''<ref>The [http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/lettermn.htm Arlington National Cemetery] website lists his name as "Jonathan K. Letterman," but no other sources list a middle name or initial.</ref> (December 11, 1824 – March 15, 1872) was an [[United States|American]] [[surgeon]] credited as being the originator of the modern methods for medical organization in armies. Dr. Letterman is known today as the "Father of Battlefield Medicine." His system enabled thousands of wounded men to be recovered and treated during the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
Letterman was born in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]], the son of a well-known surgeon.<ref>Musto, p. 120.</ref> He graduated from [[Washington & Jefferson College|Jefferson College]] in 1845 and [[Jefferson Medical College]] in 1849. That same year he was given the position of assistant surgeon in the [[Army Medical Department]].

Letterman served in [[Florida]] during military campaigns against the [[Seminole]] Indians until 1853. He then spent a year in Fort Ripley, Minnesota. He was then ordered to [[Fort Defiance, Arizona|Fort Defiance]] in [[New Mexico Territory]] to aid the campaign against the [[Apache]]. He was transferred to [[Fort Monroe]] in [[Virginia]]. From 1860 to 1861 he was engaged in [[California]] against the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]]s.

His younger brother, [[William Henry Letterman]], co-founded the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity with [[Charles Page Thomas Moore]] in Canonsburg after tending to sick classmates in the Fall of 1850.<ref>Phi Kappa Psi</ref> After graduation from Jefferson College, William followed his brother into Jefferson Medical College.

==Civil War==
[[File:Letterman+staff.jpg|thumb|Letterman (seated at left) and staff, [[Warrenton, Virginia]], 1862.]]
At the start of the Civil War, Letterman was assigned to the [[Army of the Potomac]]. He was named medical director of the [[Department of West Virginia]] in May 1862. A month later [[William Alexander Hammond|William A. Hammond]], [[Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] appointed him, with the rank of major, as the medical director of the Army of the Potomac itself.<ref>Appointment: {{google books|IBcTAAAAYAAJ|Hammond's letter to Letterman|page=3}} (19 June 1862)</ref> Letterman immediately set to reorganizing the Medical Service of the fledgling army, having obtained from army commander [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]] the charter to do whatever was necessary to improve the system. The army reeled from inefficient treatment of casualties in the [[Seven Days Battles]] in June, but by the time of the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September, Letterman had devised a system of forward [[first aid station]]s at the regimental level, where principles of [[triage]] were first instituted. He established mobile [[field hospital]]s to be located at division and corps headquarters. This was all connected by an efficient [[U.S. Ambulance Corps|ambulance corps]], established by Letterman in August 1862, under the control of medical staff instead of the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Department]]. Letterman also arranged an efficient system for the distribution of medical supplies.

Letterman proved the efficiency of his system at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], in which the Army of the Potomac suffered 12,000 casualties. After this show of proficiency, his system was adopted by other Union armies and was eventually officially established as the [[medical procedure]] for the entirety of the United States' armies by an [[Act of Congress]] in March 1864. The greatest casualties for his army were suffered at the three-day [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863. To deal with more than 14,000 [[Union Army|Union]] wounded, along with 6,800 [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] wounded who were left behind, a vast medical encampment was created northeast of Gettysburg off the York Pike on the George Wolf farm, named "Camp Letterman."<ref>Musto, p. 125.</ref> 

After a brief period of serving as Inspector of Hospitals in the [[Department of the Susquehanna]], Letterman resigned from the army in December 1864 and relocated to [[San Francisco, California]], where he served as elected [[coroner]] from 1867 to 1872.<ref>Musto, p. 127.</ref> He published his memoirs, ''Medical Recollections of the Army of the Potomac'', in 1866.

==Death and legacy==
After the death of his wife, Mary Digges Lee Letterman, he became severely depressed. He then came down with several illnesses and eventually died in [[San Francisco]]. He was only 47 years old. On November 13, 1911, the Army hospital at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]] was named [[Letterman Army Hospital]] in his honor. He was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The inscription on the private memorial that was erected for him reads:

{{Quote|Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac, June 23, 1862 to December 30, 1863, who brought order and efficiency in to the Medical Service and who was the originator of modern methods of medical organization in armies.}}

His wife was buried at his side. Her inscription reads: "Blessed are the dead that died in the Lord."
