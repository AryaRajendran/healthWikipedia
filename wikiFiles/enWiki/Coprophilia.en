'''Coprophilia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''κόπρος, kópros—excrement'' and ''φιλία, filía—liking, fondness''), also called '''scatophilia''' or '''scat''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''σκατά, skatá-[[shit]]''),<ref name="Holmes">{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |page=244}}</ref> is the [[paraphilia]] involving [[sexual arousal|sexual pleasure]] from [[feces]].<ref name="Corsini">{{cite book |last= Corsini |first= Raymond J. |title= The Dictionary of Psychology |publisher= Brunner-Routledge |location= Philadelphia |year= 2002 |page=224 |isbn= 1-58391-328-9 |oclc= 48932974}}</ref><ref name="Flora">{{cite book |last= Flora |first= Rudy |title= How to Work with Sex Offenders: A Handbook for Criminal Justice, Human Service, and Mental Health Professionals |page=91 |publisher= Haworth Clinical Practice Press |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-7890-1499-8 |oclc= 45668958}}</ref>  In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV-TR), it is classified under 302.9 Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified and has no [[diagnostic]] criteria other than a general statement about paraphilias that says "the diagnosis is made if the behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning".  Furthermore, the DSM-IV-TR notes, "Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphilic only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g. are obligatory, result in sexual dysfunction, require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships)".

Although there may be no connection between coprophilia and [[sadomasochism]] (SM), the limited data on the former comes from studies of the latter.  A study of 164 males in [[Finland]] from two sadomasochism clubs<ref>{{cite journal |author=N. Kenneth Sandnabba, Pekka Santtila, Niklas Nordling |title=Sexual Behavior and Social Adaptation Among Sadomasochistically-Oriented Males |journal=Journal of Sex Research |year=1999 |month=August }}</ref> found that 18.2% had engaged in coprophilia; 3% as a sadist, 6.1% as a masochist, and 9.1% as both. 18% of heterosexuals and 17% of homosexuals in the study pool had tried coprophilia, showing no statistically significant difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals. In a separate article analyzing 12 men who engaged in [[bestiality]], an additional analysis of an 11-man subgroup revealed that 6 had engaged in coprophilic behavior, compared with only 1 in the matched control group consisting of 12 SM-oriented males who did not engage in bestiality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sandnabba N.K.; Santtila P.; Nordling N.; Beetz A.M.; Alison L. |title=Characteristics of a Sample of Sadomasochistically-oriented Males with Recent Experience of Sexual Contact with Animals |journal=Deviant Behavior |volume=23 |issue=6 |year=2002 |month=November }}</ref>
