In the fields of [[medicine]], [[biotechnology]] and [[pharmacology]], '''drug discovery''' is the process by which new candidate [[medication]]s are discovered.

Historically, drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery.  Later [[chemical library|chemical libraries]] of synthetic [[small molecule]]s, [[natural product]]s or [[extract]]s were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable [[therapeutic]] effect in a process known as 
[[classical pharmacology]].  Since [[Human Genome Project|sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use [[high throughput screening]] of large compounds libraries against isolated [[biological target]]s which are hypothesized to be disease modifying in a process known as [[reverse pharmacology]].  Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for [[efficacy]].  Even more recently, scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level, and to use that knowledge to design (see [[drug design]]) drug candidates.

Modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, [[medicinal chemistry]] and optimization of those hits to increase the [[Affinity_(pharmacology)#Protein-ligand_binding|affinity]], [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] (to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/[[potency (pharmacology)|potency]], [[Metabolism|metabolic]] stability (to increase the [[Biological half-life|half-life]]), and oral [[bioavailability]]. Once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified, it will begin the process of [[drug development]] prior to [[clinical trial]]s. One or more of these steps may, but not necessarily, involve [[computer-aided drug design]].

Despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, "expensive, difficult, and inefficient process" with low rate of new therapeutic discovery.<ref name=Anson2009>{{Cite news

== Drug targets ==
The definition of "target" itself is something argued within the pharmaceutical industry. Generally, the "[[Biological target|target]]" is the naturally existing cellular or molecular structure involved in the pathology of interest that the drug-in-development is meant to act on. However, the distinction between a "new" and "established" target can be made without a full understanding of just what a "target" is.  This distinction is typically made by pharmaceutical companies engaged in discovery and development of  therapeutics. In an estimate from 2011, 435 human genome products were identified as therapeutic drug targets of FDA-approved drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rask-Andersen M, Almén MS, Schiöth HB | title = Trends in the exploitation of novel drug targets. | journal = [[Nat. Rev. Drug Disc.]] | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 549–90 | year = 2011| month = August | pmid = 21804595| doi = 10.1038/nrd3478}}</ref> 

"Established targets" are those for which there is a good scientific understanding, supported by a lengthy publication history, of both how the target functions in normal physiology and how it is involved in human pathology.  This does not imply that the [[mechanism of action]] of drugs that are thought to act through a particular established targets is fully understood.  Rather, "established" relates directly to the amount of background information available on a target, in particular functional information.  The more such information is available, the less investment is (generally) required to develop a therapeutic directed against the target.  The process of gathering such functional information is called "[[target validation]]" in pharmaceutical industry parlance.  Established targets also include those that the pharmaceutical industry has had experience mounting drug discovery campaigns against in the past; such a history provides information on the [[chemical feasibility]] of developing a [[Small molecule|small molecular therapeutic]] against the target and can provide licensing opportunities and freedom-to-operate indicators with respect to small-molecule therapeutic candidates.

In general, "new targets" are all those targets that are not "established targets" but which have been or are the subject of drug discovery campaigns. These typically include newly discovered [[protein]]s, or proteins whose function has now become clear as a result of basic scientific research.

The majority of targets currently selected for drug discovery efforts are proteins. Two classes predominate: [[G-protein-coupled receptor]]s (or GPCRs) and [[protein kinase]]s.

==Screening and design==

The process of finding a new drug against a chosen target for a particular disease usually involves [[high-throughput screening]] (HTS), wherein large libraries of chemicals are tested for their ability to modify the target. For example, if the target is a novel [[GPCR]], compounds will be screened for their ability to inhibit or stimulate that receptor (see [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] and [[agonist]]): if the target is a [[protein kinase]], the chemicals will be tested for their ability to [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] that kinase. 

Another important function of HTS is to show how selective the compounds are for the chosen target. The ideal is to find a molecule which will interfere with only the chosen target, but not other, related targets. To this end, other screening runs will be made to see whether the "hits" against the chosen target will interfere with other related targets - this is the process of cross-screening. Cross-screening is important, because the more unrelated targets a compound hits, the more likely that off-target [[toxicity]] will occur with that compound once it reaches the clinic.

It is very unlikely that a perfect drug candidate will emerge from these early screening runs. It is more often observed that several compounds are found to have some degree of [[pharmacological activity|activity]], and if these compounds share common chemical features, one or more [[pharmacophore]]s can then be developed. At this point, [[medicinal chemistry|medicinal chemists]] will attempt to use [[structure-activity relationship]]s (SAR) to improve certain features of the [[lead compound]]:

* increase activity against the chosen target
* reduce activity against unrelated targets
* improve the [[druglikeness]] or [[ADME]] properties of the molecule.

This process will require several iterative screening runs, during which, it is hoped, the properties of the new molecular entities will improve, and allow the favoured compounds to go forward to [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]] testing for activity in the disease model of choice.<br /> Amongst the physico-chemical properties associated with drug absorption include ionization (pKa), and solubility; permeability can be determined by [[PAMPA]] and [[Caco-2]].  PAMPA is attractive as an early screen due to the low consumption of drug and the low cost compared to tests such as Caco-2, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and [[Blood–brain barrier]] (BBB) with which there is a high correlation.

A range of parameters can be used to assess the quality of a compound, or a series of compounds, as proposed in the [[Lipinski's Rule of Five]]. Such parameters include calculated properties such as [[cLogP]] to estimate lipophilicity, [[molecular weight]], [[polar surface area]] and measured properties, such as potency, in-vitro measurement of enzymatic [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] etc. Some descriptors such as [[ligand efficiency]]<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Ligand efficiency: a useful metric for lead selection| author = Hopkins, A. L., Groom, C. R. and  Alexander, A.| doi = 10.1016/S1359-6446(04)03069-7 | pmid = 15109945| year = 2004 | journal = Drug Discovery Today | pages = 430–431 | issue = 10 | volume = 9 }}</ref> (LE) and [[lipophilic efficiency]]<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Rapid assessment of a novel series of selective CB2 agonists using parallel synthesis protocols: A Lipophilic Efficiency (LipE) analysis| author = Ryckmans, T. et al.| doi = 10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.05.062 | pmid = 19500981 | year = 2009 | journal = Bioorg.

D. et al.| doi = 10.1038/nrd2445 | pmid = 17971784 | year = 2007 | journal = Nat. Rev. Drug Disc.| pages = 881–890 | issue = 11 | volume = 6 }}</ref> (LiPE) combine such parameters to assess [[druglikeness]].

While HTS is a commonly used method for novel drug discovery, it is not the only method. It is often possible to start from a molecule which already has some of the desired properties. Such a molecule might be extracted from a [[natural product]] or even be a drug on the market which could be improved upon (so-called "me too" drugs). Other methods, such as [[virtual screening|virtual high throughput screening]], where screening is done using computer-generated models and attempting to "dock" virtual libraries to a target, are also often used.

Another important method for drug discovery is [[drug design]], whereby the biological and physical properties of the target are studied, and a prediction is made of the sorts of chemicals that might (e.g.) fit into an [[active site]]. One example is [[fragment-based lead discovery]] (FBLD). Novel pharmacophores can emerge very rapidly from these exercises. In general, [[computer-aided drug design]] is often but not always used to try to improve the potency and properties of new drug leads.

Once a lead compound series has been established with sufficient target potency and selectivity and favourable drug-like properties, one or two compounds will then be proposed for [[drug development]]. The best of these is generally called the [[lead compound]], while the other will be designated as the "backup".

== Historical background ==
The idea that effect of drug in human body are mediated by specific interactions of the drug molecule with biological macromolecules, (proteins or nucleic acids in most cases) led scientists to the conclusion that individual chemicals are required for the biological activity of the drug.  This made for the beginning of the modern era in pharmacology, as pure chemicals, instead of crude extracts, became the standard drugs. Examples of drug compounds isolated from crude preparations are [[morphine]], the active agent in opium, and [[digoxin]], a heart stimulant originating from [[Digitalis lanata]]. Organic chemistry also led to the synthesis of many of the cochemicals isolated from biological sources.

== Nature as source of drugs ==

Despite the rise of combinatorial chemistry as an integral part of lead discovery process, natural products still play a major role as starting material for drug discovery.<ref name="pmid12546556">{{cite journal | author = Feher M, Schmidt JM | title = Property distributions: differences between drugs, natural products, and molecules from combinatorial chemistry | journal = [[J Chem Inf Comput Sci]] | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 218–27 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12546556 | doi = 10.1021/ci0200467 | issn = }}</ref> A report was published in 2007,<ref name="pmid17309302">{{cite journal | author = Newman DJ, Cragg GM | title = Natural products as sources of new drugs over the last 25 years | journal = [[J.

Prod.]] | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 461–77 | year = 2007 | month = March | pmid = 17309302 | doi = 10.1021/np068054v | issn = }}</ref> covering years 1981-2006 details the contribution of biologically occurring chemicals in drug development. According to this report, of the 974 small molecule new chemical entities, 63% were natural derived or semisynthetic derivatives of natural products. For certain therapy areas, such as antimicrobials, antineoplastics, antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory drugs, the numbers were higher. In many cases, these products have been used traditionally for many years.

Natural products may be useful as a source of novel chemical structures for modern techniques of development of antibacterial therapies.<ref name="pmid16881035">{{cite journal | author = von Nussbaum F, Brands M, Hinzen B, Weigand S, Häbich D | title = Antibacterial natural products in medicinal chemistry--exodus or revival? | journal = [[Angew.

Despite the implied potential, only a fraction of Earth’s living species has been tested for bioactivity.

=== Plant-derived ===
Prior to [[Paracelsus]], the vast majority of traditionally used crude drugs in Western medicine were plant-derived extracts. This has resulted in a pool of information about the potential of plant species as an important source of starting material for drug discovery. A different set of metabolites is sometimes produced in the different anatomical parts of the plant (e.g. root, leaves and flower), and botanical knowledge is crucial also for the correct identification of bioactive plant materials.

=== Microbial metabolites ===
{{Main|Medicinal molds}}
Microbes compete for living space and nutrients. To survive in these conditions, many microbes have developed abilities to prevent competing species from proliferating. Microbes are the main source of antimicrobial drugs. ''[[Streptomyces]]'' species have been a valuable source of antibiotics. The classical example of an antibiotic discovered as a defense mechanism against another microbe is the discovery of [[penicillin]] in bacterial cultures contaminated by ''[[Penicillium]]'' fungi in 1928.

=== Marine invertebrates ===
Marine environments are potential sources for new bioactive agents.<ref name="pmid15039835">{{cite journal | author = John Faulkner D, Newman DJ, Cragg GM | title = Investigations of the marine flora and fauna of the Islands of Palau | journal = [[Nat Prod Rep]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–76 | year = 2004 | month = February | pmid = 15039835 | doi = 10.1039/b300664f | issn = }}</ref> [[Arabinose]] [[nucleosides]] discovered from marine invertebrates in 1950s, demonstrating for the first time that sugar moieties other than ribose and deoxyribose can yield bioactive nucleoside structures. However, it was 2004 when the first marine-derived drug was approved. The cone snail toxin [[ziconotide]], also known as Prialt, was  approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to treat severe neuropathic pain. Several other marine-derived agents are now in clinical trials for indications such as cancer, anti-inflammatory use and pain. One class  of these agents are [[bryostatin]]-like compounds,under investigation as anti-cancer therapy.

== Chemical diversity of natural products ==
As above mentioned, combinatorial chemistry was a key technology enabling the efficient generation of large screening libraries for the needs of high-throughput screening. However, now, after two decades of combinatorial chemistry, it has been pointed out that despite the increased efficiency in chemical synthesis, no increase in lead or drug candidates has been reached.<ref name="pmid17309302"/> This has led to analysis of chemical characteristics of combinatorial chemistry products, compared to existing drugs or natural products. The [[chemoinformatics]] concept chemical diversity, depicted as distribution of compounds in the [[chemical space]] based on their physicochemical characteristics, is often used to describe the difference between the combinatorial chemistry libraries and natural products. The synthetic, combinatorial library compounds seem to cover only a limited and quite uniform chemical space, whereas existing drugs and particularly natural products, exhibit much greater chemical diversity, distributing more evenly to the chemical space.<ref name="pmid12546556"/> The most prominent differences between natural products and compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries is the number of chiral centers (much higher in natural compounds), structure rigidity (higher in natural compounds) and number of aromatic moieties (higher in combinatorial chemistry libraries). Other chemical differences between these two groups include the nature of heteroatoms (O and N enriched in natural products, and S and halogen atoms more often present in synthetic compounds), as well as level of non-aromatic unsaturation (higher in natural products). As both structure rigidity and [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] are both well-established factors in [[medicinal chemistry]] known to enhance compounds specificity and efficacy as a drug, it has been suggested that natural products compare favourable to today's combinatorial chemistry libraries as potential lead molecules.

== Natural product drug discovery ==

=== Screening ===
Two main approaches exist for the finding of new bioactive chemical entities from natural sources. 

The first is sometimes referred to as random collection and screening of material, but in fact the collection is often far from random in that biological (often botanical) knowledge is used about which families show promise, based on a number of factors, including past screening. This approach is based on the fact that only a small part of earth’s biodiversity has ever been tested for pharmaceutical activity.  It is also based on the fact that organisms living in a species-rich environment need to evolve defensive and competitive mechanisms to survive, mechanisms which might usefully be exploited in the development of drugs that can cure diseases affecting humans. A collection of plant, animal and microbial samples from rich ecosystems can potentially give rise to novel biological activities worth exploiting in the drug development process. One example of a successful use of this strategy is the screening for antitumour agents by the [[National Cancer Institute]], started in the 1960s. [[Paclitaxel]] was identified from Pacific yew tree [[Taxus brevifolia]]. Paclitaxel showed anti-tumour activity by a previously undescribed mechanism (stabilization of microtubules) and is now approved for clinical use for the treatment of lung, breast and ovarian cancer, as well as for [[Kaposi's sarcoma]].  Early in the 21st century, [[Cabazitaxel]] (made by [[Sanofi]], a French firm), another relative of [[taxol]] has been shown effective against [[prostate cancer]], also because it works by preventing the formation of microtubules, which pull the chromosomes apart in dividing cells (such as cancer cells). Still another examples are:  1. Camptotheca ([[Camptothecin]] · [[Topotecan]] · [[Irinotecan]] · [[Rubitecan]] · [[Belotecan]]); 2. Podophyllum ([[Etoposide]] · [[Teniposide]]); 3a. Anthracyclines ([[Aclarubicin]] · [[Daunorubicin]] · [[Doxorubicin]] · [[Epirubicin]] · [[Idarubicin]] · [[Amrubicin]] · [[Pirarubicin]] · [[Valrubicin]] · [[Zorubicin]]); 3b. Anthracenediones ([[Mitoxantrone]] · [[Pixantrone]]).

Nor do all drugs developed in this manner come from plants.  Professor [[Louise Rollins-Smith]] of [[Vanderbilt University]]'s Medical Center, for example, has developed from the skin of [[frog]]s a compound which blocks [[AIDS]].  Professor Rollins-Smith is aware of declining [[amphibian]] populations and has said:  "We need to protect these species long enough for us to understand their medicinal cabinet."

The second main approach involves [[Ethnobotany]], the study of the general use of plants in society, and [[ethnopharmacology]], an area inside ethnobotany, which is focused specifically on medicinal uses. 

Both of these two main approaches can be used in selecting starting materials for future drugs. [[Artemisinin]], an antimalarial agent from sweet wormtree [[Artemisia annua]], used in Chinese medicine since 200BC is one drug used as part of [[combination therapy]] for multiresistant [[Plasmodium falciparum]].

=== Structural elucidation ===
The elucidation of the chemical structure is critical to avoid the re-discovery of a chemical agent that is already known for its structure and chemical activity.  [[Mass spectrometry]], often used to determine structure, is a method in which individual compounds are identified based on their mass/charge ratio, after ionization. Chemical compounds exist in nature as mixtures, so the combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is often used to separate the individual chemicals. Databases of mass spectras for known compounds are available. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is another important technique for determining chemical structures of natural products. NMR yields information about individual hydrogen and carbon atoms in the structure, allowing detailed reconstruction of the molecule’s architecture.
