Additional association of the phosphorylating kinase [[Casein kinase 2|CK2]] and dephosphorylating phosphatase [[PP2A]] on the cytoplasmic face of the protein allow for enriched Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity—and thus—kinetics modulation.<ref name="pmid20359520"/>  CK2 serves to phosphorylate the SKCa-bound CaM at the T80 residue, rather than the channel helices themselves, to reduce calcium sensitivity.

==Gating Mechanism==
The SK channel gating mechanism is controlled by [[intracellular]] calcium levels.<ref name="pmid21942705"/> Calcium enters the cell via voltage activated calcium channels as well as through NMDA receptors.<ref name="pmid17714097"/>  Calcium does not directly bind to the SK channel. Calcium binds to the protein calmodulin (CaM). When bound to calcium, CaM binds to the CaM-binding domain on the intracellular subunit of the SK channel. When each of the four CaM-binding domain subunits is bound to calmodulin, the SK channel changes confirmation. This transitions the channel from a [[tetramer]] of [[monomers]] to a folded [[protein dimer|dimer]] of dimers which results in rotation of the CaM binding domains. This rotation causes the mechanical opening of the channel gate.<ref name="pmid21942705"/> Calcium enters the cell via voltage activated calcium channels as well as through NMDA receptors.<ref name="pmid17714097"/> The time constant of SK channel activation is approximately 5ms. When calcium levels are depleted, the time constant for channel deactivation ranges from 15-60ms.<ref name="pmid20959620">{{cite journal | author = Berkefeld H, Fakler B, Schulte U | title = Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels: from protein complexes to function | journal = Physiol.

==Synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation==
In dendritic spines, SK channels are directly coupled to [[NMDA]] receptors. In addition to being activated by calcium flow through voltage-gated calcium channels, SK channels can be activated by calcium flowing through NMDA receptors, which occurs after depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.<ref name="pmid19543219"/>  Experiments using apamin have shown that specifically blocking SK channels can increase learning and [[long term potentiation]]. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) causes the down regulation of SK channels which facilitates long term potentiation. Increasing SK channel activity has the opposite effect and serves to impair [[learning]].<ref name="pmid21942705"/> An increase in SK channel activity that occurs over time may be related to decreases in plasticity and memory that is seen with aging.<ref name="pmid14678575">{{cite journal | author = Tzounopoulos T, Stackman R | title = Enhancing synaptic plasticity and memory: a role for small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels | journal = Neuroscientist | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 434–9 | year = 2003 | month = December | pmid = 14678575 | doi = 10.1177/1073858403259282 }}</ref>

== Role in Parkinson’s Disease ==
The dysfunction of potassium channels, including SK channels, is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD), a progressive [[neurodegenerative disorder]].  

SK channel blockers control the firing rate (the number of [[action potentials]] produced by a [[neuron]] in a given time) and the firing pattern (the way action potentials are allocated throughout time) through their production of m-AHP. SK channel activators decrease the firing rate and neuron sensitivity to excitatory stimuli, whereas SK channel blockers increase the firing rate and sensitivity to excitatory stimuli. This has important implications as to the function of dopaminergic neurons.<ref name="Liu_2010">{{cite journal | author = Liu XK, Wang G, Chen SD | title = Modulation of the activity of dopaminergic neurons by SK channels: a potential target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease? | journal = Neurosci Bull | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 265–71 | year = 2010 | month = June | pmid = 20502506 | doi = 10.1007/s12264-010-1217-4 }}</ref>  For example, the amount of dopamine released by midbrain dopaminergic neurons is much higher when the frequency of firing increases than when they fire at a constant rate. 

SK channels are widely expressed in midbrain [[dopaminergic]] neurons. Multiple pharmacological techniques have been used to adjust SK affinity for calcium ions, thereby modulating the excitability of [[substantia nigra]] dopaminergic neurons.  Blockage of SK channels in vivo increases the firing rate of substantia nigra cells, which increases the amount of dopamine released from the synaptic terminals.<ref name="Liu_2010"/> When a large amount of dopamine accumulates in the cytosol, cell damage is induced due to the build-up of free radicals and damage to mitochondria. 
In addition, techniques have been used to modulate SK channels in order to alter the dopamine [[phenotype]] of neurons.  After the loss of TH+ ([[tyrosine hydroxylase]] positive) substantia nigra compacta (SNc) neurons due to Parkinson’s-induced neurodegeneration, the number of these neurons can partially recover via a cell phenotype “shift” from TH- (tyrosine hydroxylase negative) to TH+. The number of TH+ neurons can be altered by SK channel modulation – specifically, the infusion of SK agonists into substantia nigra increases the number of TH+ neurons whereas the infusion of SK anatagonist decreases the number of TH+ neurons.  The reason for this relationship between SK channels and TH expression may be due to neuroprotection against dopamine [[toxicity]].<ref name="Liu_2010"/>

Based on the two opposing roles of SK channels in the [[pathogenesis]] of PD, two contradictory methods have been suggested as therapeutic options for the improvement of PD symptoms:
Inhibition of SK channels
*Inhibition of SK channels, specifically the blockage of SK3 channels, increases the frequency of firing in dopaminergic neurons, thereby increasing the release of [[dopamine]].  It is therefore thought that the application of SK3 channels blockers in PD patients may alleviate short-term motor symptoms. 
*However, inhibition also results in a decreased number of TH+ substantia nigra compacta (SNc) neurons in the cell which results in a decrease in dopamine synthesis over the long term. 
Facilitation of SK channels
*Enhancing the function of SK channels increases the number of TH+ substantia nigra compacta (SNc) neurons in the cell, thereby maintaining dopamine synthesis over the long term.
*However, the facilitation of SK channels decreases the firing frequency in dopaminergic neurons over the short term.
