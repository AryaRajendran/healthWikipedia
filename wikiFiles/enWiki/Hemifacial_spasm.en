                
'''Hemifacial spasm''' ('''HFS''') is a rare [[neuromuscular disease]] characterized by irregular, involuntary [[muscle contractions]] ([[spasm]]s) on one side (hemi-) of the face (-facial).<ref name=kong>{{cite journal|last=Kong|first=Doo-Sik|coauthors=Kwan Park|title=Hemifacial Spasm: A Neurological Perspective |journal= Journal of Korean Neurological Society|year=2007|volume=42|series=5|pages=355–362|doi=10.3340/jkns.2007.42.5.355|issue=5}}</ref> The facial muscles are controlled by the [[facial nerve]] (seventh cranial nerve), which originates at the [[brainstem]] and exits the skull below the ear where it separates into five main branches.

This disease takes two forms: typical and atypical. In typical form, the [[spasm|twitching]] usually starts in the lower [[eye lid]] in [[orbicularis oculi muscle]]. As time progresses, it spreads to the whole lid, then to the [[orbicularis oris]] muscle around the lips, and [[buccinator muscle]] in the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbone]] area.<ref name=janetta-1>{{cite journal|last=Jannetta|first=PJ|title=Typical or atypical hemifacial spasm|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|year=1998|volume=88|series=2|pages=346–7}}</ref> The reverse process of [[spasm|twitching]] occurs in atypical hemifacial spasm; [[spasm|twitching]] starts in [[orbicularis oris]] muscle around the lips, and [[buccinator muscle]] in the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbone]] area in the [[face|lower face]], then progresses up to the [[orbicularis oculi muscle]] in the eyelid as time progresses.<ref name=janetta-1 /> The most common form is the typical form, and atypical form is only seen in about 2–3% of patients with hemifacial spasm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ryu|first=H.|coauthors=Yamamoto S., Miyamoto T.|title=Atypical hemifacial spasm|journal=Acta Neurochir|year=1998|volume=40|issue=11|pages=1173–76|doi=10.1007/s007010050233}}</ref> The incidence of hemifacial spasm is approximately 0.8 per 100,000 persons.<ref name=fukshima>{{cite journal|last=Fukushima|first=T|title=Microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm: Result in 2890 cases|journal=Neurovascular surgary|year=1995|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|pages=1133–45}}</ref> 

This disorder occurs in both men and women, although it affects [[middle age|middle-aged]] or [[old age|elderly]] women more frequently.<ref name=NINDS>{{cite web|title=NINDS Hemifacial Spasm Information Page|publisher=National Institute for Neurological Disorder and Strokes}}</ref> Hemifacial spasm is much more common in some [[Asia]]n population.<ref name=kong /> It may be caused by a facial [[nerve injury]], a [[tumor]], or it may have no apparent cause. Individuals with [[spasm]] on both sides of the face are very rare. 

== History ==
The earliest descriptions about hemifacia spasm is by Shultze in 1875 and Gowers in 1899. The [[etiology]] of hemifacial spasm and location of the abnormality have been debated for more than a century.<ref name="fukshima" /> Surgical treatment for hemifacial spasm in the early 20th century included neurolysis (destruction of nerve tissue), stretching the [[facial nerve]] (seventh cranial nerve), and high-pressure irrigation of the nerve with [[Lactated Ringer's solution|lactate ringer's solution]]. The medical regimens of that time involved injection of the nerve with [[ethanol]], [[functional electrical stimulation|electrical stimulation]], application of toxic compounds ([[Silver nitrate|nitrate of silver]], [[zinc]], [[arsenic]], [[bromides]]) as well as medications such as [[Phenytoin|Dilantin]] or other [[anticonvulsants]].<ref name="fukshima" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=RH|title=Hemifacial spasm: a review|journal=Surgical Neurology|year=1991|volume=36|pages=251–77|doi=10.1016/0090-3019(91)90087-P|pmid=1948626|issue=4}}</ref><ref name=gardner>{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=J.W.|title=Hemifacial Spasm - A reversible pathophysiologic state|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|year=1962|volume=27|pages=240–47|doi=10.3171/jns.1962.19.3.0240|last2=Sava|first2=Gerard A.|issue=3}}</ref>

Additional advances in understanding the [[etiology]] and improving treatments for hemifacial spasm did not occur until the mid-seventies. In 1977, 47 cases of hemifacial spasm underwent [[microvascular decompression]] of the facial nerve using the [[operating microscope]]. The results illustrated nerve-vessel conflicts (or [[cholesteatoma]]) to be located at the root exit zone of the [[facial nerve]] in all cases.<ref name=janette-1975>{{cite journal|last=Jannetta|first=PJ|title=Trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm--etiology and definitive treatment|journal=Trans Am Neurol Assoc|year=1975|volume=100|pages=89–91.|pmid=1226647}}</ref><ref name=janetta-1977>{{cite journal|last=Jannetta|first=PJ|coauthors=Abbasy M, Maroon JC, Ramos FM, Albin MS.|title=Etiology and definitive microsurgical treatment of hemifacial spasm. Operative techniques and results in 47 patients|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery|year=1977|volume=47|pages=321–8|doi=10.3171/jns.1977.47.3.0321|pmid=894338|issue=3}}</ref> The root exit zone is where the central [[Neuroglia|glial]] [[axon]]al insulation of the nerve ends and the [[nerve|peripheral nerve]] [[Myelin|axonal myelination]] begins. [[Biopsy|Biopsies]] of the root exit zone demonstrated degeneration of [[axons]], denuded axis cylinder and interrupted [[myelin]]. The results of the experiment strengthened the theory that [[vascular]] compression of the facial nerve was the primary cause of hemifacial spasm, and proposed a specific region of the facial nerve where the effects of longstanding compression results in [[nerve]] dysfunction.<ref name=janetta-1977 />

== Causes ==
[[File:Cranial_nerve_VII.svg |200px|thumb|left|The [[Facial Nerve]] ( The Seventh Cranial Nerve)]]
Three theories exist to explain the facial nerve dysfunction found in hemifacial spasm. The first proposed theory is [[Ephaptic coupling|ephaptic]] transmission, which is electrical activity crossing from one demyelinated neuron to another resulting in a false [[synapse]].<ref name="gardner" /> The second theory involves abnormal activity of [[axon]]s at the [[facial nerve]] root end zone secondary to compressive damage/[[Demyelinating disease|demyelination]].<ref name=Eby>{{cite journal|last=Eby|first=Joesph|coauthors=Sung Tae Cha,Hrayr K. Shahinian|title=Fully endoscopic vascular decompression of the glossopharyngeal nerve|journal=The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery|year=2002|volume=13|issue=1|pages=90–95|doi=10.1097/00001665-200201000-00021|pmid=11887002}}</ref>

The third theory or "Kindling theory" involves increased excitability of the [[facial nerve]] nucleus due to feedback from a damaged facial nerve.<ref name=Eby />

It is generally accepted as compression of the [[facial nerve]] by vessels of the [[Posterior circulation infarct|posterior circulation]].<ref name=Eby /> In detail compression of the [[seventh cranial nerve]] by a dolichoectatic (a distorted, dilated, and elongated) [[vertebral artery]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rahman|first=M.D. Ersalan|coauthors=Jonathan D. Trobe, and Stephen S. Gebarski|title=Hemifacial Spasm Caused by Vertebral Artery Dolichoectasia|journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology|year=2002|month=June|volume=133|issue=6|pages=854–855|doi=10.1016/S0002-9394(02)01387-9}}</ref> is accepted to be the general cause of hemifacial spasm. Less than 1% of cases are cause by tumor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Caces|first=F|coauthors=Chays A, Locatelli P, Bruzzo M, Epron JP, Fiacre E, Magnan J. |title=Neuro-vascular decompression in hemifacial spasm: anatomical, electrophysiological and therapeutic results apropos of 100 cases |journal=Rev Laryngol Otol Rhinol (Bord)|year=1996|volume=117|series=5|pages=347–51}}</ref><ref name=Lee>{{cite journal|last=Lee SH|first=Rhee BA, Choi SK, Koh JS, Lim YJ|coauthors=Jankovic J|title=Cerebellopontine angle tumors causing hemifacial spasm: types, incidence, and mechanism in nine reported cases and literature review|journal=Acta Neurochir (Wien)|year=2010|volume=150|series=11|pages=1901–8|doi=10.1007/s00701-010-0796-1|issue=11}}</ref> Hemifacial spasm is much more common in some Asian population.<ref name=kong />

Several families with hemifacial spasm have been reported, suggesting a genetic [[etiology]] or [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition]] in some cases. There appears to be an [[dominance (genetics)|autosomal dominant]] pattern of inheritance in these families with low [[penetrance]], and except for a younger age at onset, the clinical features overlap with the [[idiopathic]] cases.Evaluation of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s in genes related to vascular change causing compression of blood vessles did not show an association with hemifacial spasm. Clarifying the role of genetic susceptibility in hemifacial spasm may help to better understand the [[pathogenesis]] of this disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Toby C. Yaltho, MD 1 and Joseph Jankovic, MD|title=The Many Faces of Hemifacial Spasm: Differential Diagnosis of Unilateral Facial Spasms|journal=Movement Disorders|date=4/5/2011|year=2011|month=4|volume=29|issue=9}}</ref>

== Signs & Symptoms ==
[[File:Hemifacial spasm different forms.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The two forms of Hemifacial Spasm]]
The first sign of hemifacial spasm is typically muscle movement in the patient's eyelid and around the eye. It can vary in intensity.<ref name=janetta-1977 /> The intermittent [[spasm|twitching]] of the eyelid, which can result in forced closure of the eye which gradually spreads to the muscles of the lower part of the face (Typical form- See Image). In atypical form the spasms start in the cheekbone area and spreads to the eyelid.<ref name=janetta-1 /> Ultimately, all the muscles on that side are affected, nearly all the time. This sometimes causes the mouth to be pulled to the side. Experts have linked hemifacial spasm to facial nerve injury, [[Bell's palsy]] and [[tumor]]s. Although the most frequent cause is a blood vessel pressing on the [[facial nerve]] at the spot where it leaves the patient's brain stem, sometimes there is no known cause. When the affected individual is younger than 40, doctors suspect an underlying cause such as [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Office of Communications and Public Liaison|title=NINDS Hemifacial Spasm Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hemifacial_spasm/hemifacial_spasm.htm|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes|accessdate=11/03/2012}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
There are several tests done to diagnose hemifacial spasm. Diagnosing a case of hemifacial spasm begins with a complete neurological exam, including an [[Electromyography]] (EMG – a test that measures and records electrical activity generated in muscle at rest and in response to muscle contraction), [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI – a test that uses magnetic waves to make pictures of structures inside the head), [[X-ray computed tomography|Computed tomography]] (CT scan – a type of x-ray that uses a computer to make pictures of structures inside the head), and [[Angiography]] (an x-ray exam of the blood vessels when they are filled with a contrast material).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zappia JJ; Wiet RJ; Chouhan A; Zhao JC|title=Pitfalls in the diagnosis of hemifacial spasm|journal=The Laryngoscope|year=1997|volume=107|series=4|pages=461–465|doi=10.1097/00005537-199704000-00007|pmid=9111374|first1=JJ|last2=Wiet|first2=RJ|last3=Chouhan|first3=A|last4=Zhao|first4=JC|issue=4}}</ref>

Studies have shown that the most effective method of hemifacial spasm screening is MRI. In one study only 25% of the CT scans showed the abnormality in hemifacial spasm patients, whilst more than half of the MRI imaging demonstrated a vascular anomaly. MRI imaging should be the initial screening procedure in the assessment of patients with hemifacial spasm.<ref name=Loretz />

== Treatments & Side Effects ==
Mild cases of hemifacial spasm may be managed with sedation or [[carbamazepine]] (an anticonvulsant drug).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alexander GE, Moses H.|journal=Carbamazepine for hemifacial spasm Neurology|date=1982|volume=32|pages=286–287}}</ref> Microsurgical decompression and botulinum toxin injections are the current main treatments used for hemifacial spasm.<ref name= Loretz>{{cite journal|last=I. T. Lorentz|title=Treatment of hemifacial spasm with botulinum toxin|journal=Journal of Clinical Nueroscience|date=04/1995|volume=2|series=2}}</ref> 

=== Microvascular Decompression ===

[[Microvascular decompression]] appears to be the most popular surgical treatment at present. Microvascular compression relieves pressure on the facial nerve, which is the cause of most hemifacial spasm cases. Excellent to good results are reported in 80% or more cases with a 10% recurrence rate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=PiattJH,J'r, Wilkins RH.|title=Treatment of tic douloureux and hemifacial spasm by posterior fossa exploration: therapeutic implications of various neurovascular relationships|journal=Neurosurgery|year=1984|volume=14|pages=462–71|doi=10.1227/00006123-198404000-00012|pmid=6728149|first1=JH|last2=Wilkins|first2=RH|issue=4}}</ref> In the present series approximately 10% had previously failed surgery. Serious complications can follow microsurgical decompressive operations, even when performed by experienced surgeons. These include cerebellar haematoma or swelling, [[brain stem]] infarction (blood vessel of the brain stem blocked), [[cerebral infarction]] (ischemic stroke resulting from a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain), [[subdural haematoma]] and intracerebral infarction (blockage of blood flow to the brain). Death or permanent disability (hearing loss) can occur in 2% of patients of hemifacial spasm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=HanakitaJ, Kondo A.|title=Serious complications of microvascular decompression operations for trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm|journal=Neurosurgery|year=1988|volume=22|pages=348–52|doi=10.1227/00006123-198802000-00012|pmid=3352885|first1=J|last2=Kondo|first2=A|issue=2}}</ref>

=== Botulinum Toxin ===

[[ Botulinum toxin]]  is highly effective in the treatment of hemifacial spasm.<ref name="Tan- Singapore">{{cite journal|last=Tan|first=Eng-ing|coauthors=Stephanie Fook-Chong, Sau-Ying Lum, Erle Lim|title=Botulinum toxin improves quality of life in hemifacial spasm: validation of a questionnaire (HFS-30)|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|date=16|year=2004|month=January|volume=219|pages=151–155|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2004.01.010|pmid=15050451|issue=1–2}}</ref> It has a success rate equal to that of surgery, but repeated injections may be required every 3 to 6 months. The injections are administered as an outpatient or office procedure. Whilst side effects occur, these are never permanent. Repeated injections over the years remain highly effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=LoeserJD, ChenJ.|title=Hemifacial spasm: treatment by microsurgical facial nerve decompression|journal=Neurosurgery|year=1982|volume=13|pages=141–46|doi=10.1227/00006123-198308000-00006|first1=John D.|last2=Chen|first2=James|issue=2}}</ref>  Whilst the toxin is expensive, the cost of even prolonged courses of injections compares favourably with the cost of surgery.<ref name="Tan- Singapore" /> Patients with HFS should be offered a number of treatment options. Very mild cases or those who are reluctant to have surgery or [[Botulinum toxin]] injections can be offered medical treatment, sometimes as a temporary measure.In young and fit patients microsurgical decompression and [[Botulinum Toxin|Botulinum]] injections should be discussed as alternative procedures. In the majority of cases, and especially in the elderly and the unfit, [[Botulinum toxin]] injection is the treatment of first choice. Imaging procedures should be done in all unusual cases of hemifacial spasm and when surgery is contemplated.<ref name=Loretz />

== Prevention ==
There is no known way to prevent hemifacial spasm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Toby C. Yaltho, and Joseph Jankovic, MD|title=The Many Faces of Hemifacial Spasm: Differential Diagnosis of Unilateral Facial Spasms|journal=Movement Disorders|date=04/04/2011|volume=26|issue=9}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
The incidence of hemifacial spasm is approximately 0.8 per 100,000 persons.<ref name="fukshima" /> Hemifacial spasm is more prevalent among females over 40 years of age.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=A.|coauthors=Jankovic J.|title=Hemifacial spasm: clinical findings and treatment|journal=Muscle and Nerve|year=1998|volume=21|series=12|pages=1740–7|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199812)21:12<1740::AID-MUS17>3.0.CO;2-V|pmid=9843077|issue=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Tan|first=N.C.|coauthors=Chan, L.L, Tan E.K.|title=Hemifacial spasm and involuntary facial movements|journal=QJM|year=2002|volume=95|series=8|pages=493–500|doi=10.1093/qjmed/95.8.493|pmid=12145388|issue=8}}</ref> The estimated prevalence for women is 14.5 per 100,000 and 7.4 per 100,000 in men.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=LW|coauthors=Reich SG|title=Hemifacial spasm|journal=Curr Treat Options Neurol|year=2004|month=6|volume=3|pages=175–9|doi=10.1007/s11940-004-0009-4|issue=3}}</ref> Prevalence for hemifacial spasm increase with age, reaching 39.7 per 100,000 for those aged 70 years and older.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Auger|first=RG|coauthors=Whisnant JP|title=Hemifacial spasm in Rochester and Olmsted County, Minnesota, 1960 to 1984|journal=Arch Neurol|year=1990|volume=47|pages=1233–4|doi=10.1001/archneur.1990.00530110095023|pmid=2241620|issue=11}}</ref> One study divided 214 hemifacial patients based on the cause of the disease. The patients who had a [[compression (physical)|compression]] in the [[facial nerve]] at the end of the [[brain stem]] as the primary hemifacial spasm and patients who had peripheral facial palsy or nerve lesion due to [[tumors]], [[demyelination]], [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]], or infection as secondary hemifacial spasm. The study found that 77% of hemifacial spasm is due to primary hemifacial spasm and 23% is due to secondary hemifacial spasm. The study also found both sets of patients to share similar age at onset, male to female ratios, and similar affected side.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Colosimo|first=C|coauthors=Bologna M, Lamberti S|title=A comparative study of primary and secondary hemifacial spasm|journal=Arch Neurol|year=2006|volume=63|series=6|pages=441–4|doi=10.1001/archneur.63.3.441|pmid=16533973|issue=3}}</ref> Another study with 2050 patients presented with hemifacial spasm between 1986 and 2009, only 9 cases were caused by a [[cerebellopontine angle syndrome]], an incidence of 0.44%.<ref name=Lee />
