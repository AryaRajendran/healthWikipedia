'''Antivenom''' (or '''antivenin''' or '''antivenene''') is a biological product used in the treatment of [[venom (poison)|venomous]] bites or stings. Antivenom is created by milking venom from the desired [[snake]], [[spider]] or [[insect]]. The venom is then diluted and injected into a [[horse]], [[sheep]] or [[goat]]. The subject animal will undergo an [[immune response]] to the venom, producing [[antibody|antibodies]] against the venom's active molecule which can then be harvested from the animal's blood and used to treat [[envenomation]]. Internationally, antivenoms must conform to the standards of [[pharmacopoeia]] and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Theakston RD, Warrell DA, Griffiths E |title=Report of a WHO workshop on the standardization and control of antivenoms |journal=Toxicon |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=541–57 |year=2003 |month=April |pmid=12676433 |doi= 10.1016/S0041-0101(02)00393-8  |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0041010102003938 |issn=}}</ref>

==Terminology==

The name "antivenin" comes from the French word [[wikt:venin|''venin'']], meaning [[venom]], which in turn was derived from Latin [[wikt:venenum|''venenum'']], meaning [[poison]].

Historically, the term ''antivenin'' was predominant around the world, its first published use being in 1895.<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Antivenin}}</ref>  In 1981, the [[World Health Organization]] decided that the preferred terminology in the English language would be ''venom'' and ''antivenom'' rather than ''venin'' and ''antivenin'' or ''venen'' and ''antivenene''.<ref>{{cite book |last= World Health Organization| first= |title=Progress in the characterization of venoms and standardization of antivenoms |publisher=WHO Offset Publications | location=Geneva |year=1981|pages=5| isbn=92-4-170058-0}}</ref>

==Therapeutic use==
The principle of antivenom is based on that of [[vaccine]]s, developed by [[Edward Jenner]]; however, instead of inducing immunity in the patient directly, it is induced in a host animal and the hyperimmunized serum is [[Blood transfusion|transfused]] into the patient.  

Antivenoms can be classified into '''monovalent''' (when they are effective against a given species' venom) or '''polyvalent''' (when they are effective against a range of species, or several different species at the same time).  The first antivenom for snakes (called an anti-ophidic serum) was developed by [[Albert Calmette]], a French scientist of the [[Pasteur Institute]] working at its [[Indochine]] branch in 1895, against the [[Indian Cobra]] (''Naja naja'').  [[Vital Brazil]], a Brazilian scientist, developed in 1901 the first monovalent and polyvalent antivenoms for Central and South American ''[[Crotalus]]'', ''[[Bothrops]]'' and ''[[Elapidae|Elaps]]'' genera, as well as for certain species of venomous [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[frog]]s. They were all developed in a Brazilian institution, the [[Instituto Butantan]], located in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

Antivenoms for therapeutic use are often preserved as [[freeze-dried]] [[ampoule]]s, but some are available only in liquid form and must be kept refrigerated. They are not immediately inactivated by heat, however, so a minor gap in the [[cold chain]] is not disastrous. The majority of antivenoms (including all snake antivenoms) are administered intravenously; however, [[stonefish]] and [[redback spider]] antivenoms are given [[intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]].  The intramuscular route has been questioned in some situations as not uniformly  effective.<ref name="EmergMed2002-isbister">{{cite journal | doi=10.1046/j.1442-2026.2002.00356.x | author=Isbister GK. | title=Failure of intramuscular antivenom in Redback spider envenoming | journal=Emerg Med (Fremantle) | year=2002 | pages=436–9 | volume=14 | issue=4 | pmid=12534488}}</ref>

Antivenoms bind to and neutralize the venom, halting further damage, but do not reverse damage already done.  Thus, they should be administered as soon as possible after the venom has been injected, but are of some benefit as long as venom is present in the body.  Since the advent of antivenoms, some bites which were previously invariably fatal have become only rarely fatal provided that the antivenom is administered soon enough. 

Antivenoms are purified by several processes but will still contain other serum [[protein]]s that can act as [[antigen]]s.  Some individuals may react to the antivenom with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction ([[anaphylaxis]]) or a delayed hypersensitivity ([[serum sickness]]) reaction and antivenom should, therefore, be used with caution.  Despite this caution, antivenom is typically the sole effective treatment for a life-threatening condition, and once the precautions for managing these reactions are in place, an anaphylactoid reaction is not grounds to refuse to give antivenom if otherwise indicated.  Although it is a popular myth that a person allergic to horses "cannot" be given antivenom, the side effects are manageable, and antivenom should be given as rapidly as the side effects can be managed.<ref>See, for example, the Antivenom Precautions paragraph of the Medication section of {{cite web

In the U.S. the only approved antivenom for [[pit viper]] ([[rattlesnake]], [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] and [[water moccasin]]) snakebite is based on a purified product made in sheep known as [[CroFab]].<ref>http://www.savagelabs.com/Products/CroFab/Home/crofab_frame.htm Link to PDF for full prescribing information, retrieved 11/11/12</ref> It was approved by the FDA in October, 2000. U.S. [[coral snake]] antivenom is no longer manufactured, and remaining stocks of in-date antivenom for coral snakebite expired in the Fall of 2009, leaving the U.S. without a coral snake antivenom. Efforts are being made to obtain approval for a coral snake antivenom produced in Mexico which would work against U.S. coral snakebite, but such approval remains speculative{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. In the absence of antivenom, all coral snakebite should be treated in a hospital by elective endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation until the effects of coral snake neurotoxins abate. It is important to remember that respiratory paralysis in coral snakebite can occur suddenly, often up to 12 or more hours after the bite, so intubation and ventilation should be employed in anticipation of respiratory failure and not after it occurs, when it may be too late.

==Natural and acquired immunity==
Although individuals can vary in their physiopathological response and sensitivity to animal venoms, there is no natural immunity to them in humans.  Some [[ophiophagy|ophiophagic]] animals are immune to the venoms produced by some species of venomous snakes, by the presence of antihemorrhagic and antineurotoxic factors in their blood.  These animals include [[Kingsnake]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[mongoose]]s, and [[hedgehog]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

It is quite possible to [[Mithridatism|immunize a person directly with small and graded doses of venom]] rather than an animal.  According to [[Greek history]], King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]] did this in order to protect himself against attempts of [[poison]]ing, therefore this procedure is often called ''[[mithridatization]]''.  However, unlike a [[vaccination]] against disease which must only produce a latent [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] that can be roused in case of [[infection]], to neutralize a sudden and large dose of venom requires maintaining a high level of circulating antibody (a hyperimmunized state), through repeated venom injections (typically every 21 days).  The long-term health effects of this process have not been studied.  For some large snakes, the total amount of antibody it is possible to maintain in one human being is not enough to neutralize one envenomation{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.  Further, [[cytotoxic]] venom components can cause pain and scarring at the immunization site.  Finally, the resistance is specific to the particular venom used; maintaining resistance to a variety of venoms requires multiple monthly venom injections.  Thus, there is no practical purpose or favorable cost/benefit ratio for this, except for people like [[zoo]] handlers, researchers, and circus artists who deal closely with venomous animals.  Mithridatization has been tried with success in [[Australia]] and [[Brazil]] and total immunity has been achieved even to multiple bites of extremely venomous cobras and pit vipers. Starting in 1950, [[Bill Haast]] successfully immunized himself to the venoms of [[Cape Cobra|Cape]], [[Indian Cobra|Indian]] and [[King Cobra|King]] cobras{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Because [[neurotoxic]] venoms must travel farther in the body to do harm and are produced in smaller quantities, it is easier to develop resistance to them than directly cytotoxic venoms (such as those of most [[Viperidae|vipers]]) that are injected in large quantity and do damage immediately upon injection.
