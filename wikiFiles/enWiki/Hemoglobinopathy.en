'''Hemoglobinopathy''' is a kind of [[gene]]tic defect that results in abnormal structure of one of the [[globin]] chains of the [[hemoglobin]] molecule.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000048231|hemoglobinopathy}}</ref> Hemoglobinopathies are inherited single-gene disorders; in most cases, they are inherited as autosomal co-dominant traits.  <ref>Weatherall DJ, Clegg JB. Inherited haemoglobin disorders: an increasing global health problem. Bull World Health Organ. 2001;79(8):704-712.</ref> Common hemoglobinopathies include [[sickle-cell disease]]. It is estimated that 7% of world's population (420 million) are carriers, with 60% of total and 70% pathological being in Africa. Hemoglobinopathies are most common in ethnic populations from Africa, the Mediterranean basin and Southeast Asia.

Hemoglobinopathies imply structural abnormalities in the globin proteins themselves.<ref>[http://web2.airmail.net/uthman/hemoglobinopathy/hemoglobinopathy.html Hemoglobinopathies and Thalassemias</ref> [[Thalassemia]]s, in contrast, usually result in underproduction of normal globin [[protein]]s, often through mutations in regulatory genes. The two conditions may overlap, however, since some conditions which cause abnormalities in globin proteins (hemoglobinopathy) also affect their production (thalassemia). Thus, some hemoglobinopathies are also thalassemias, but most are not. 

Either hemoglobinopathy or thalassemia, or both, may cause anemia. Some well-known hemoglobin variants such as [[sickle-cell anemia]] and [[congenital dyserythropoietic anemia]] are responsible for diseases, and are considered hemoglobinopathies. However, many [[hemoglobin variants]] do not cause pathology or anemia, and thus are often not classed as hemoglobinopathies, because they are not considered pathologies. [[Hemoglobin variants]] are a part of the normal [[human embryonic development|embryonic]] and [[human fetal development|fetal]] development, but may also be pathologic mutant forms of hemoglobin in a [[population]], caused by variations in genetics. Other variants cause no detectable [[pathology]], and are thus considered non-pathological variants.<ref name="urlHemoglobin Variants">{{cite web | url = http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/hemoglobin_var/glance-3.html | title = Hemoglobin Variants | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2007-11-10 | work = Lab Tests Online | publisher = American Association for Clinical Chemistry | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-10-12}}</ref><ref name="urlA Syllabus of Human Hemoglobin Variants (1996)">{{cite web | url = http://globin.cse.psu.edu/html/huisman/variants/ | title = A Syllabus of Human Hemoglobin Variants | author = Huisman THJ | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1996 | format = | work = Globin Gene Server | publisher = Pennsylvania State University | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-10-12}}</ref>

== Migration patterns ==
=== Migration patterns (Alkaline Electrophoresis) ===
In general on alkaline electrophoresis in order of increasing mobility are hemoglobins A2, E=O=C, G=D=S=Lepore, F, A, K, J, Bart's, N, I, and H.

In general a sickling test (sodium bisulfite) is performed on abnormal hemoglobins migrating in the S location to see if the red cells precipitate in solution.

=== Migration patterns (Acid Electrophoresis) ===
In general on acid electrophoresis in order of increasing mobility are hemoglobins F, A=D=G=E=O=Lepore, S, and C.

This is how abnormal hemoglobin variants are isolated and identified using these two methods.  For example a Hgb G-Philadelphia would migrate with S on alkaline electrophoresis and would migrate with A on acid electrophoresis, respectively.

==Hemoglobinopathy and evolution==

Some hemoglobinopathies (and also related diseases like [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]]) seem to have given an evolutionary benefit, especially to [[Heterozygous advantage|heterozygote]]s, in areas where [[malaria]] is endemic. Malaria parasites live inside red blood cells, but subtly disturb normal cellular function. In patients predisposed for rapid clearance of red blood cells, this may lead to early destruction of cells infected with the parasite and increased chance of survival for the carrier of the trait.
