According to Bryan Rosner, et al., in 2007's ''The Top 10 Lyme Disease Treatments'', Nieper "was known for his expertise in applying the advanced principles of physics to medical concepts."<ref name=Rosner/> He was among the first researchers to work with [[lithium orotate]],<ref name="Lerner"/><ref name="Rosner"/> which he believed could significantly reduce the recurrence of cancer.<ref name=Chamberlain/> Nieper also patented, along with Franz Kohler, [[Calcium 2-aminoethylphosphate]] (Calcium AEP), which he believed could be helpful in combating such diseases as [[juvenile diabetes]], [[gastritis]], [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]], [[thyroiditis]], [[Myocarditis]] and [[Hodgkin's Disease]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Best of Health: The 100 Best Health Books | first = Sheldon | last = Zerden | coauthors = Richard Passwater, Abram Hoffer | publisher = Warren H.

Although Nieper was a controversial figure,<ref name=Lerner/> 2008's ''Cancer: The Complete Recovery Guide'' indicates that he "achieved a great reputation as a natural healer."<ref name=Chamberlain>{{cite book | title = Cancer: The Complete Recovery Guide | first = Jonathan | last = Chamberlain | publisher = Blacksmith Books | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-9545960-1-3 | page = 282}}</ref> Nieper advocated the health benefits of [[beta-carotene]], recommending raw [[cabbage]] and [[carrot juice]] for cancer patients.<ref>{{cite book | last = Atkins | first = Robert C. | coauthors = Sheila Buff | title = Dr. Atkins' Age-defying Diet: A Powerful New Dietary Defense Against Aging | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-312-97701-8 | pages = 119–120}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title = Prescription for Nutritional Healing | last = Balch | first = Phyllis A. | edition = 4th | publisher= Avery | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-58333-236-7 | page = 284}}</ref>
