Bederson completed both his internship and residency at the University of California, San Francisco. During his residency, he also studied [[neuropathology]] at the [[University of Turin|University of Torino]] in [[Italy]] and [[Microsurgery|microvascular]] and skull-base neurosurgery under Dr. M. [[Gazi Yasargil]] at the [[University Hospital Zurich|University Hospitals of Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[University Medical Centre Ljubljana|University Medical Center in Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]]. He completed a fellowship in cerebrovascular surgery at the [[St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center|Barrow Neurological Institute]] in [[Arizona]] under Dr. [[Robert F.

Bederson joined Mount Sinai in 1992 as the Director of the Clinical Program for [[Cerebrovascular disease|Cerebrovascular Disorders]] and served as Vice-Chairman after 2001. From 2002 until 2008 he directed the Neurosurgery Residency Program. He is currently the Chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery.

Bederson established the first basic science laboratory in the Department of Neurosurgery at Mount Sinai, developing models of stroke and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]. In 2002 he was the first neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai to receive an [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] R01 grant as principal investigator.<ref name=MSSM/>

A high-ranking member of many cerebrovascular societies, Bederson is chair of the AANS/CNS Cerebrovascular section.<ref>[http://www.neurosurgery.org/sections/about.aspx?Section=CV&Page=about.asp Neurosurgery://On-Call]</ref> With Bederson serving as its Chairman, the [[American Heart Association]] Guidelines Writing Group on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage published [http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/extract/40/3/994?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=bederson&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT updated guidelines on stroke treatment]. He is also a member of the Society of Neurological Surgery.<ref name=SNS/>

Bederson's clinical interests include treatment of [[Brain tumor|intracranial]] and spinal vascular and [[tumor]] pathology, including [[cerebral aneurysm]]s, [[arteriovenous malformation]]s, trigeminal [[neuralgia]], tumors of the skull base, [[Common carotid artery|carotid artery]] disease and problems of the [[Cervix|cervical]] and [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar spine]].<ref name=SNS/>

==Personal life==
During his surgical internship, he met and married Isabelle Germano, M.D. who is also Professor of  Neurosurgery at Mount Sinai.<ref name=SNS>[http://www.societyns.org/society/bio.aspx?MemberID=7383]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=April 5 Wedding For Dr. Germano |author= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 1, 1987 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/style/april-5-wedding-for-dr-germano.html |accessdate=December 22, 2009 }}</ref> They have 2 daughters, Lucia and Maria.<ref name="SNS"/>
