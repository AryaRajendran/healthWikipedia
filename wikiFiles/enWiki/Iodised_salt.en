'''Iodised salt''' ([[American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|also spelled]] '''iodized salt''') is [[table salt]] mixed with a minute amount of various salts of the element [[iodine]]. The ingestion of iodide prevents [[iodine deficiency]]. Worldwide, iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of [[mental retardation]].<ref name="mcneil"/> Deficiency also causes [[thyroid]] gland problems, including "endemic [[goitre]]". In many countries, iodine deficiency is a major public health problem that can be cheaply addressed by purposely adding small amounts of iodine to the [[sodium chloride]] salt.

Iodine is a [[micronutrient]] and [[dietary mineral]] that is naturally present in the food supply in some regions, especially near sea coasts, but is generally quite rare in the Earth's crust, since iodine is a so-called "heavy" element (with the highest [[atomic mass]] of any element needed by mammals for life), and [[abundance of chemical elements]] generally declines with greater atomic mass. Where natural levels of iodine in the [[soil]] are low and the iodine is not taken up by vegetables, iodine added to salt provides the small but essential amount of iodide needed by humans.

Table salt with [[iodide]] slowly loses its iodine content through the process of oxidation and iodine evaporation.

==Chemistry, biochemistry and nutritional aspects==
[[File:Iodised salt.JPG|thumb|left|300px|A pile of iodised salt.]]
Four [[inorganic compound]]s are used as iodide sources, depending on the producer: [[potassium iodate]], [[potassium iodide]], [[sodium iodate]], and [[sodium iodide]].  Any of these compounds supplies the body with its iodine required for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxine]] (T<sub>4</sub>) and [[triiodothyronine]] (T<sub>3</sub>) hormones by the thyroid gland.  Animals also benefit from iodine supplements, and the [[hydrogen iodide]] derivative of [[ethylenediamine]] is the main supplement to livestock feed.<ref>Phyllis A. Lyday "Iodine and Iodine Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_381}}</ref>

Edible [[salt]] can be iodised by spraying it with a potassium iodate solution. 60 ml of potassium iodate, costing about US$1.15 (in 2006), is required to iodise a ton of salt.<ref name=mcneil/> Salt is an effective vehicle for distributing iodine to the public because it does not spoil and is consumed in more predictable amounts than most other commodities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  For example, the concentration of iodine in salt has gradually increased in [[Switzerland]]: 3.75&nbsp;mg/kg in 1952, 7.5&nbsp;mg/kg in 1962, 15&nbsp;mg/kg in 1980, and 20&nbsp;mg/kg in 1998.  These increases were found to improve iodine status in the general Swiss population.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/82/2/388.full|title=Increasing the iodine concentration in the Swiss iodized salt program markedly improved iodine status in pregnant women and children: a 5-y prospective national study|date=2005-08|journal=American Journal of Nutrition|author=Michael B Zimmermann, Isabelle Aeberli, Toni Torresani and Hans Bürgi|volume=82|issue=2|pages=388–392|pmid=16087983}}</ref>

Salt that is iodised with iodide may slowly lose its iodine content by exposure to excess air over long periods. The halogen iodide, over time and exposure to excess oxygen and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidises to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates.<ref>Katarzyna Waszkowiak & Krystyna Szymandera-Buszka.

==In public health initiatives==
Worldwide, [[iodine deficiency]] affects two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of [[mental retardation]].<ref name="mcneil">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/health/16iodine.html?fta=y|title=In Raising the World’s I.Q., the Secret’s in the Salt|last=McNeil|first=Donald G. Jr|date=2006-12-16|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> According to public health experts, iodisation of salt may be the world's simplest and most cost-effective measure available to improve health, only costing US$0.05 per person per year.<ref name=mcneil/> At the [[World Summit for Children]] in
1990, a goal was set to eliminate iodine deficiency by 2000. At that time, 25% of households consumed iodised salt, a proportion that increased to 66% by 2006.<ref name=mcneil/>

Salt producers are often, although not always, supportive of government initiatives to iodise edible salt supplies. Opposition to iodisation comes from small salt producers who are concerned about the added expense, private makers of iodine pills, concerns about promoting salt intake, and unfounded rumours that iodisation causes [[AIDS]] or other illnesses.<ref name=mcneil/> Iodisation programmes are more likely to be successful in areas where most edible salt is produced by a small number of large companies, as opposed to hundreds of smaller companies.

The [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] recommends<ref>[http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/21cfr101_05.html 2005 CFR Title 21, Volume 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 150 [[microgram]]s (0,15mg) of iodine per day for both men and women.

===Brazil===
As world's fifth largest country, [[Brazil]] spans a large territory, encompassing an area larger than the [[contiguous United States]], and much of its population is located in areas remote to the coast where most food with natural dietary iodine content is produced, and even in modern days consumption of marine fish, algae and seafood in Brazil is comparatively low (consumption of fish, presumably riverine, is higher in [[North Region, Brazil|northern Brazil]], though).<ref>{{pt}} [http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/portalsaude/noticia/6934/162/ministerio-da-saude-incentiva-consumo-regular-de-peixe.html Health Portal – Ministry of Health encourages regular consumption of fish – Brazilians eat too little fish, the ideal is to consume fresh fish at least twice a week]</ref> In Brazil, the Iodine Deficiency Disorders were detected as a major public health issue by government authorities in the 1950s, when about 20% of the population had goiter.<ref>{{pt}} [http://colegiomarista.org.br/joaopauloii/pesquisa-avalia-impacto-do-sal-iodado-no-brasil Research assesses impact of iodised salt in Brazil]</ref>

The most recent resolution on the mandatory iodisation of table salt is National Agency for Sanitary Vigilance's (ANVISA) Resolution RDC no. 130 of May 26, 2003 that mandates the content of iodine to be of between 20 and 60 miligrams for each kilogram of table salt. In order for the iodine content of salt to be within the limits established by law, the salt industry should adopt the requirements for Best Practices specific to the salt beneficiary industries regulated by Resolution RDC no. 28, of March 28, 2000.

Iodisation above legal limits is explicitly avoided according to ANVISA's site due to the risk of clinical and sub-clinical [[hyperthyroidism]] in elders and of the apparition of autoimmune [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] in those with a genetic predisposition to it. Brazilians consume in average 12g of table salt per day (more than twice the maximum recommended adult human consumption by international standards, what is strongly related to the most common cause of death in the country, cardiovascular disorders, see [[health in Brazil]]),<ref>{{pt}} [http://nutricao.saude.gov.br/sodio.php National Policy for Food and Nutrition – General Coordination of Food and Nutrition – Sodium]</ref> what would lead to a daily consumption of 0,72mg of iodine in the maximum allowed amount of 60mg/1kg, many times above the recommended 0,13mg adult and 0,20mg pregnant/breastfeeding consumption, while a more moderate (but still slightly exaggerated if non-low sodium) 6g table salt consumption with a 30mg/1kg iodine/salt content would lead to a daily iodine consumption of 0,18mg.<ref>{{pt}} [http://www.anvisa.gov.br/faqdinamica/index.asp?Secao=Usuario&usersecoes=28&userassunto=174 Anvisa – FAQ – Salt]</ref> Finally, Brazilians with a daily, usual physician-recommended,<ref>{{pt}} [http://www.portalsaofrancisco.com.br/alfa/hipertensao/index.php Portal São Francisco – Arterial hypertension]</ref> uptake of 2g of table salt would consume 0,12mg of iodine with a 60mg/1kg iodine/salt product.

All adjustments of salt iodisation, conducted by the Ministry of Health, are made in accordance with the recommendation of the World Health Organization and national experts on the subject. Any regulations on the salt is previously discussed in the Interagency Commission for the Prevention and Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders.

===Kazakhstan===
[[Kazakhstan]], a country in Central Asia in which local food supplies seldom contain sufficient iodine, has drastically reduced iodine deficiency through salt iodisation programmes. Campaigns by the government and non-profit organisations to educate the public about the benefits of iodised salt began in the mid 1990s, with iodisation of edible salt becoming legally mandatory in 2002.<ref name=mcneil/>

===United States===
In the U.S. in the early 20th century, goitre was especially prevalent in the region around the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref>Markel, ''When in Rains it Pours'', p. 220</ref>
[[David Murray Cowie]], a professor of [[pediatrics|paediatrics]] at the [[University of Michigan]], led the U.S. to adopt the [[Swiss]] practice of adding [[sodium iodide]] or [[potassium iodide]] to table and cooking salt. On May 1, 1924, iodised salt was sold commercially in [[Michigan]].<ref name="pmid17796701">{{cite journal | author = McClure RD | title = GOITER PROPHYLAXIS WITH IODIZED SALT | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 82 | issue = 2129 | pages = 370–371 | year = 1935 | month = October | pmid = 17796701 | doi = 10.1126/science.82.2129.370 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17796701| accessdate = 2010-02-06}}</ref>  By the fall of 1924, [[Morton Salt Company]] began distributing iodised salt nationally.

===South Africa===
The South African government instructed that all salt for sale was to be iodised after December 12, 1995.<ref>[http://www.cerebos.co.za/IodationHints.aspx Health Hints], Cerebos {{Dead link|date=August 2011}}{{wayback|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080325033408/http://www.cerebos.co.za/IodationHints.aspx}}</ref><ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1732067 Impact after 1 year of compulsory iodisation on the iodine content of table salt at retailer level in South Africa], 1999, vol. 50, no1, pp. 7–12 (12 ref.), International journal of food sciences and nutrition ISSN 0963-7486</ref>

===No-additive salts for canning and pickling===
In contrast to table salt, which often has iodide as well as anticaking ingredients, special canning and [[pickling salt]] is made for producing the brine to be used in pickling vegetables and other food-stuffs. This salt has no iodine added because the iodide can be oxidised by the foods and darken them—a harmless but aesthetically undesirable effect.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-pickling-salt.htm |title=What Is Pickling Salt? |first= S.E. |last=Smith |work=wisegeek.com |accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref>

==Fortification of salt with other elements==
===Double-fortified salt===
Salt can also be double-fortified with iron and iodine (see below).<ref>Diosady LL and Mannar MGV. [http://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/~diosady/sltdbl.html Double fortification of salt with iron and iodine.], 2000, University of Toronto, Department of Chemical Engineering, The Pages of Professor L.L. Diosady</ref>  The iron is microencapsulated with stearine to prevent it from reacting with the iodine in the salt. By providing iron in addition to iodine in the convenient delivery vehicle of salt, it could serve as a sustainable approach to combating both iodine and iron deficiency disorders in areas where both deficiencies are prevalent.<ref>Andersson M, Thankachan P, Muthayya S, Goud RB, Kurpad AV, Hurrell RF, Zimmermann MB. [http://www.ajcn.org/content/88/5/1378.full Dual fortification of salt with iodine and iron: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of micronized ferric pyrophosphate and encapsulated ferrous fumarate in southern India]. Am J Clin Nutr. 2008 Nov;88(5):1378–87.</ref> 

Adding iron to iodised salt is complicated by a number of chemical, technical, and organoleptic issues. Since a viable DFS premix became available for scale-up in 2001, a body of scientific literature has been emerging to support the DFS initiative including studies conducted in Ghana, India, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya and Morocco.<ref>[http://www.micronutrient.org/CMFiles/What%20we%20do/New%20Solutions%20-%20Double%20Fortified%20Salt/DFS-Tech-Breakthrough-to-alleviate-I&IDD-around-the-world.pdf Double Fortification of Salt: a Technical Breakthrough to Alleviate Iron and Iodine Deficiency Disorders Around the World.

===Fluoridated salt===
In some countries, table salt is treated with [[potassium fluoride]] to enhance dental health.<ref name=Aigueperse>{{Cite book|first = Jean|last = Aigueperse|coauthors = Paul Mollard, Didier Devilliers, Marius Chemla, Robert Faron, Renée Romano, Jean Pierre Cuer|contribution = Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic|editor-last = Ullmann|title = Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year = 2005|publisher = Wiley-VCH|place = Weinheim|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a11_307}}</ref>

===Diethylcarbamazine===
In [[India]] and [[China]], [[diethylcarbamazine]] has been added to salt to combat [[lymphatic filariasis]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/7/06-034108/en/index.html] WHO: Unfulfilled potential: using diethylcarbamazine-fortified salt to eliminate lymphatic filariasis</ref>
