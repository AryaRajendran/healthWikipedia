According to its practitioners, anthroposophic medicine uses a [[holistic]] approach ("[[salutogenesis]]") that seeks to support the preconditions for [[health]] by strengthening the patient's [[physiology]] and [[individuality]], as well as addressing the specific factors that cause [[disease]].

Anthroposophic medicine seeks to extend, not replace, mainstream Western medicine.<ref>Girke, Matthias "Was ist Anthroposophische Medizin?", ''Komplementäre und Integrative Medizin'', v. 49, nr. 9, 1 September 2008, pp. 10-12</ref>
Its practitioners do not regard it as an "alternative", but as an extension, to conventional [[science-based medicine]]:<ref>Gunnar Stollberg, [https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/soz/iw/pdf/stollberg.pdf ''"Heterodoxe Medizin, Weltgesellschaft und Glokalisierung: Asiatische Medizinformen in Westeuropa"'']</ref>
{{Bquote | Anthroposophic medicine is based on Steiner's concept that spiritual awareness is the foundation of individual health and of the health of society. Steiner believed that many of the oldest systems of healing, such as [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]], and [[Tibetan medicine]], were based on a spiritual perception of the world that modern science has lost. Steiner wanted medicine to get back in touch with spirituality, and at the same time keep and use wisely the gains that science and technology have made. Thus, conventional medicine needed to be extended beyond physical science to include a holistic spiritual science. | x | x |"Anthroposophic medicine", AltMD | [http://www.altmd.com/Articles/Anthroposophic-Medicine--Encyclopedia-of-Alterna]}}

Based upon the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophic]] view of the human being, the approach considers the patient's:<ref name="Klotter" />
* Physical constitution;
* Life or [[etheric body]], sometimes considered to be analogous to [[chi]] or [[prana]];<ref name=AM>[http://www.altmd.com/Articles/Anthroposophic-Medicine--Encyclopedia-of-Alterna  Anthroposophic medicine, AltMD]</ref>
* The physio-psychological organization (also called the [[astral body]]), understood as the bearer of both the emotional or psychological state ([[Affect (psychology)|affect]]), and of [[consciousness]];
* The '[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]', source of the [[self-reflection]] and [[free will]] that co-form the patient's biography.
Each of these is considered to have an influence on a patient's health.<ref name =AM/> 

In particular, anthroposophic medicine raises the question of a chronic or acute illness' significance in the biography of the patient: in what ways does the illness express, or appear as a result of, what is happening in the patient's life; and in what way does it open up or close down life paths? The events of an illness are considered to constitute decisive decision points in the patient's life: through overcoming an illness a patient may open up biographical doors and/or develop aspects of his or her being that he or she might not otherwise have achieved. The medical goal is then not necessarily to restore the previous condition of the patient, which led to the illness, but rather to achieve a new and healthier condition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fintelmann|first=Volker|title=Intuitive Medizin - anthroposophische Medizin in der Praxis|year=2007|publisher=Hippokrates|location=Stuttgart|edition=5th|pages=72–73}}</ref> Biographical rhythms including seven-year phases of development are often considered in understanding the patient's path of life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lievegoed|first=Bernard|title=Phases|year=1997|publisher=Sophia Books|location=Forest Row, England|isbn=1-85584-056-1}}</ref>  

Practitioners believe that spending time with a patient is important to discern the most important factors about the patient, and that aspects of patients' well being are not helped by the rush;<ref name="AM"/> many doctors, both anthroposophic and conventional, are critical of the stresses on the medical system today that lead to rushing patients through.<ref>Guidelines for the Clinical Use of Electronic Mail with Patients, The Practice of Informatics, Journal of the American Informatics Association, Beverley Kane, Daniel Z Sands, [http://jamia.bmj.com/content/5/1/104.abstract]</ref> 

Anthroposophic doctors try to minimize the use of [[antibiotics]], [[antipyretics]], [[pharmaceutical drugs]], and [[Inoculation|vaccinations]].<ref name="AM"/> In particular, some children treated by anthroposophic doctors are  vaccinated only against tetanus and polio, while for others vaccinations may be given later than recommended by health authorities.<ref name=Lancet>Alm, J. S., Swartz, J., Lilja, G., Scheynius, A., and Pershagen, G. (1999). Atopy in children of families with an anthroposophic lifestyle. ''Lancet'', '''353'''(9163):1485-8. {{DOI|10.1016/S0140-6736(98)09344-1}} PMID 10232315 [http://www.waldorflibrary.org/journal_articles/rb5103.pdf Reprint copy]</ref> Steiner believed that vaccination "interferes with karmic development and the cycles of reincarnation". When this was put into practice, it caused a [[pertussis]] outbreak in a [[Waldorf education|waldorf school]] due to a lack of [[inocculation]], causing the school to be temporarily closed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paul A. Offit MD|first=|title=Deadly choices|isbn=9780465021499|page=xiii}}</ref>

To find remedies to treat a particular illness, anthroposophic medicine considers the nature of the source of the substances used. The character of a mineral, plant or animal is considered to have been formed by the substances that are most active within it. Thus this character may also reveal what the substance will accomplish when given to treat another organism. This is related to [[Samuel Hahnemann]]'s [[Doctrine of signatures]]. Willow, for example, has an unusual character:
{{Quote|... plants that grow near water are usually heavy, with big, dark green leaves that wilt and break easily. An exception is... the white willow, a tree that always grows near water and loves light. However, unlike other "watery" plants, the willow has fine, almost dry leaves and looks very light...  Its branches are unbelievably tough. They are elastic and cannot be broken. They bend easily and form "joints" rather than break. These few signatures can give us the clue to what salix can be used for therapeutically: arthritis, deformation of joints, swollen joints...|<ref>[http://ruscombe.org/wp/anthroposophic-medicine/ ''What Is Anthroposophic Medicine?'']</ref>}}

There is no scientific evidence that the shape of plants has ever caused a new medical property to be discovered.<ref name=Bennett>{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Bradley C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |month= |title= Doctrine of Signatures: An Explanation of Medicinal Plant Discovery or Dissemination of Knowledge? |journal=Economic Botany |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=246–255 doi=10.1663/0013–0001 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1663%2F0013-0001(2007)61%5B246%3ADOSAEO%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |quote= |doi=10.1663/0013-0001 }}</ref> The intent of the medical approach is to consider both the effective substances and the character (not just shape) of the mineral, plant or animal these substances are drawn from, however.<ref>[http://www.anthromed.org/Article.aspx?artpk=116 Angaben zu Pflanzeninhaltsstoffen bei Rudolf Steiner].

===Heart===
Steiner described the heart as not a mechanical device in which the heartbeat can be distinguished from the blood circulation. For Steiner, the heart was a regulator of flow, flow that in the [[blood]] of the [[circulatory system]] is, as Marinelli put it, ''"propelled with its own biological momentum, as can be seen in the embryo, and boosts itself with ''induced'' momenta from the [[heart]]".<ref name=Marinelli>Marinelli, R., Fuerst, B., et al.

===Mistletoe treatment for cancer===
In 2005, a Swiss government study identified 178 clinical studies of anthroposophic medicine.<ref name=UWirz>Urban Wirz, review of "Anthroposophische Medizin in der klinischen Forschung", ''Schweizerische Ärztezeitung'' 2006;87: 37</ref> For many treatments used in anthroposophic medicine, however, proofs of efficacy have not been made through [[evidence-based medicine|strictly controlled medical testing]].<ref name=Edzard>[http://healthwatch-uk.org/awardwinners/edzardernst.html Healthwatch Award 2005: Edzard Ernst];</ref>

The use of [[mistletoe]] extracts in the treatment of [[cancer]] was first proposed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and developed by anthroposophic researchers;<ref>Christine Murphy, ''Iscador: Mistletoe in Cancer Therapy'', ISBN 1-930051-76-X, pp. 52-3</ref> it is now probably the best-known anthroposophic therapy.<ref name=AM/> Various forms of the extract are available in [[Central Europe]], where the treatment regimens of up to two-thirds of all oncology patients includes mistletoe.<ref name="bmj.com">Ernst E, Schmit K, Steuer-Vogt MK. Mistletoe for cancer? A systematic review of randomised controlled trials" ''Int J Cancer'' 2003;107:262-7, cited in BMJ 2006;333:1293-1294 (23 December)[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1293?ijkey=56e55886cc53e0c478801e74001edc3bea1c322e&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha]</ref> The extracts are generally no longer used to reduce or inhibit tumor growth, but to improve the patients' quality of life and to reduce tumor-induced symptoms and the side-effects of [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]]; a wide array of clinical studies support the efficacy of the treatment regimen for the latter purposes.<ref name=AM/> There are also [[phytotherapeutic]] preparations using non-homeopathic doses of mistletoe; these should not be confused with the anthroposophic preparations.<ref name=AM>p.56</ref>

In the United States, mistletoe "holds interest as a potential anticancer agent because extracts derived from it have been shown to kill cancer cells in vitro" but no forms of the extract have been approved by the FDA for any indications.  Mistletoe extracts may not be distributed in or imported into the US except for the purpose of clinical research.<ref>National Cancer Institute, [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/HealthProfessional/page3 Mistletoe: General Information for Health Professionals]</ref>

Although preclinical (animal) studies suggested a potential role for mistletoe extracts in cancer therapies, no such effects have been convincingly reported. Evidence for the efficacy of mistletoe as an anticancer drug from human studies is weak. [[Double-blind|double blinded]] studies have tended not to support this effect.<ref name="bmj.com" /> Though numerous cohort studies and case series have reported tumor remission and regression,<ref name=AM>pp. 166-172</ref> the cohort and case studies have been criticized as biased due to their small size and lack of double-blinding.<ref name="bmj.com" />  The National Cancer Institute (US)   suggests that many studies done on human beings have major weaknesses that raise doubts about the reliability of their findings;<ref>Questions and Answers About Mistletoe, published by National Cancer Institute (2006). [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/Page2 Article]</ref> in some studies without such weaknesses no significant effect was found.<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/HealthProfessional/page5</ref>

The institutes's position on mistletoe is: "Extracts of mistletoe have been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory and to boost the immune system (the complex group of organs and cells that defends the body against infection or disease). For this reason, mistletoe has been classified as a type of biological response modifier (a substance that stimulates the body's response to infection and disease). Extracts of mistletoe have also been shown in the laboratory to prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow....At this time, there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer except in carefully designed clinical trials. These trials will give more information about whether mistletoe can be useful in treating certain types of cancer." <ref>http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/8.cdr#Section_8</ref>

One review concluded: "Although there is laboratory evidence of biological activity that may be beneficial to cancer patients, the evidence of clinical benefit from human studies remains weak and inconclusive. Because of the absence of serious side effects and the limited evidence that mistletoe products may offer some therapeutic advantages, further research is warranted."<ref>Kaegi E, on behalf of the Task Force on Alternative Therapies of the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Initiative. Unconventional therapies for cancer: 3. Iscador. Canadian Medical Association 1998;158:1157-59., cited in BCCA</ref>
 
According to the [[American Cancer Society]], "A number of laboratory experiments suggest mistletoe may have the potential to treat cancer, but these results have not yet been reflected in clinical trials. Available evidence from well-designed clinical trials that have studied mistletoe did not support claims that mistletoe could improve length or quality of life.  Review of evidence from carefully conducted controlled human clinical studies indicates that mistletoe does not have any significant anti-tumor activity. Most of the studies that have found positive results from mistletoe extract in the treatment or prevention of cancer are not considered scientifically dependable....Researchers are working to identify the most important components, which are thought to be the lectins (proteins). Laboratory experiments also hint that mistletoe increases the activity of lymphocytes, which are cells that attack invading organisms.

==History==
[[File:Ita Wegman vor1900.jpg|thumb|200px|Ita Wegman, co-founder of the medical approach, before 1900 in Berlin.]]
The first steps towards an anthroposophic approach to medicine were made before 1920, when [[homeopathic]] physicians and pharmacists began working with Rudolf Steiner, who recommended new [[Anthroposophic Pharmacy|medicinal substances]] as well as specific methods for preparing these. In 1921, Dr Ita Wegman opened the first anthroposophic medical clinic, now known as the [[Ita Wegman Clinic]],<ref>[http://www.wegmanklinik.ch Ita Wegman Klinik] (German). Accessed 2007-12-26.</ref> in [[Arlesheim]], [[Switzerland]]. Wegman was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They began to train the first anthroposophic nurses for the clinic.

At Wegman's request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1921 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, Wegman and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, ''Fundamentals of Therapy''.

The clinic expanded and soon opened a branch in [[Ascona]]. Wegman lectured widely, visiting Holland and England particularly frequently, and an increasing number of doctors began to include the anthroposophic approach in their practices. A cancer clinic, the [[Lukas Clinic]],<ref>[http://www.lukasklinik.ch/cms.asp?IDN=133&H='106'&T=0&Sprache=en Lukas Clinic]. Accessed 2007-12-26.</ref> opened in Arlesheim in 1963.

===Modern history and prevalence of practice===
There are about 28 anthroposophic hospitals, departments of hospitals, rehabilitation centers and sanatoria located in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Italy, the USA and Brazil, as well as over 140 outpatient clinics worldwide. Four of the German and Swiss anthroposophic hospitals are state-sponsored; three are academic teaching hospitals under the aegis of nearby universities. Three European universities (Bern, Hamburg and Witten/Herdecke) have professorships in anthroposophic medicine and other universities offer courses on the field. Anthroposophic medicine is recognized in Germany as a "Special Therapy System", along with homeopathy and herbal medicine,<ref>http://www.medsektion-goetheanum.org/lang/en/?p=11</ref> under the Medicines Act and has its own committee at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.<ref name=AM/>  Anthroposophic medical treatment has been a recognized specialty within Swiss governmental health policy since 1999.<ref>[http://www.anthrosana.ch/content/4_dialog/4_1_fragenantworten.htm Anthrosana]</ref>  The International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations estimates that there are currently approximately 2,000 Anthroposophic doctors worldwide.  Based on the number of prescriptions it has been estimated that anthroposophic medicinal products are prescribed by more than 30,000 physicians.<ref>http://www.ivaa.info/?p=72</ref>
