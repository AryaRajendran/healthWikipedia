The [[thyroid]] is normally very resistant to infection. Due to a relatively high amount of [[iodine]] in the tissue, as well as high vascularity and lymphatic drainage to the region, it is difficult for pathogens to infect the thyroid tissue. Despite all this, a persistent fistula from the [[piriform sinus]] may make the left lobe of the thyroid susceptible to infection and abscess formation.<ref name="Melmed"/>  AIT is most often caused by a bacterial infection but can also be caused by a fungal or parasitic infection, most commonly in an immunocompromised host.

==Epidemiology==
Acute infectious thyroiditis is very rare, with it only accounting for about 0.1-0.7% of all [[thyroiditis]]. Large hospitals tend to only see two cases of AIT annually.<ref name=Lazarus />  For the few cases of AIT that are seen the statistics seem to show a pattern.  AIT is found in children and young adults between the ages of 20 and 40.  The occurrence of the disease in people between 20 and 40 is only about 8% with the other 92% being in children. Men and women are each just as likely to get the disease.<ref name=Pearce />  If left untreated, there is a 12% mortality rate.<ref name=Lazarus />

==Causes==
Despite the thyroid gland being extremely resistant to infection, it is still susceptible to infection by various bacteria.<ref name=Park>Park, Sun W., Moon H. Han, Myung H. Sung, In O. Kim, Kwang H. Kim, Kee H. Chang, and Man C. Han. "Neck Infection Associated with Pyriform Sinus Fistula: Imaging Findings." American Journal of Neuroradiology Am J Neuroradiol 21 (2000): 817-22.</ref>  The etiology can be almost any bacterium.  ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', ''Streptococcus epidermidis'', and ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' in descending order are the organisms most commonly isolated from acute thyroiditis cases in children. Other aerobic organisms are ''Klebsiella sp'', ''[[Haemophilus influenza]]'', ''[[Streptococcus viridans]]'', ''[[Eikenella corrodens]]'', ''[[Enterobacteriaceae]]'',<ref name=Brook>Brook, I. (2002). "Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children." ''International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology'', 67, 447-451.</ref> and ''salmonella sp''.<ref>3)	Lazarus, John, and James Hennessey. "Acute and Subacute, and Reidel’s Thyroiditis." Ed. Leslie J. De Groot. The Thyroid And Its Diseases. 6th ed. New York: Elsevier, 1996</ref> 
Occurrences of AIT are most common in patients with prior thyroid disease such as [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] or [[thyroid cancer]].  The most common cause of infection in children is a congenital abnormality such as pyriform sinus [[fistula]].<ref name=Pearce />  In most cases, the infection originates in the piriform sinus and spreads to the thyroid via the fistula.<ref name=Yamada>Yamada, H., Fujita,K., Tokuriki, T., & Ishida, R. (2002). "Nine cases of piriform sinus fistula with acute suppurative thyroiditis." Elsevier, 29, 361-365.</ref> In many reported cases of AIT the infection occurs following an [[upper respiratory tract infection]]. One study found that of the reported cases of AIT, 66% occurred after an acute illness involving the upper respiratory tract.<ref name=Park />  Although the rates of infection are still very low, cases of AIT have been on the rise in recent years due to the higher occurrence of immune-compromised patients. 
Other causes of AIT are commonly due to contamination from an outside source and are included below.
*Repeated fine needle aspirates <ref name=Melmed />
*Perforation of [[esophagus]] <ref name=Brook />
*Regional infection

==Symptoms/Diagnosis==
In most cases AIT is characterized by onset of pain, firmness, tenderness, redness or swelling in the anterior aspect of the neck.<ref name=Brook />  Patients will also present with a sudden fever, [[dysphagia]] and [[dysphonia]].<ref name=Pearce />  Symptoms may be present from 1 to 180 days, with most symptoms lasting an average of about 18 days. The main issue associated with the diagnosis of AIT is differentiating it from other more commonly seen forms of thyroid conditions.<ref name=Brook />  Pain, fever and swelling are often much more severe and continue to get worse in patients who have AIT compared to those with other thyroid conditions.<ref name=Melmed />  Patients who are suspected of having AIT often undergo tests to detect for elevated levels of [[white blood cells]] as well as an [[ultrasound]] to reveal unilobular swelling.<ref name=Melmed /><ref name=Brook />  Depending on the age and immune status of the patient more invasive procedures may be performed such as fine needle aspiration of the neck mass to facilitate a diagnosis.<ref name=Brook /> 
In cases where the infection is thought to be associated with a sinus fistula it is often necessary to confirm the presence of the fistula through surgery or laryngoscopic examination.<ref name=Park />  While invasive procedures can often tell definitively whether or not a fistula is present, new studies are working on the use of computed tomography as a useful method to visualize and detect the presence of a sinus fistula.<ref name=Park />

===Diagnostic Tests===

*Fever, redness, swelling
*Pain
*Blood tests of thyroid functions including TSH, T4 and T3 are usually normal <ref name=Slatosky>Slatosky, John D.O, Benjamin Shipton D.O, and Haney Wahba M.D. [http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0215/p1047.html] "Thyroiditis: Differential Diagnosis and Management." ''American Family Physician''. 2000 Feb. 15; 61(4):1047-1052.</ref>
*Ultrasonographic examination often shows the abscess or swelling in thyroid
* [[Gallium scan]] will be positive
*[[Barium swallow]] will show fistula connection to the piriform sinus and left lobe
*Elevated white blood cell count<ref name=Slatosky />
*Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate<ref name=Slatosky />
*Fine-needle aspiration

==Treatment==
Treatment of AIT involves antibiotic treatment.  Based on the offending organism found on microscopic examination of the stained fine needle aspirate, the appropriate antibiotic treatment is determined.  In the case of a severe infection, [[systemic antibiotics]] are necessary.<ref name=Lazarus />  [[Empirical]] broad spectrum [[antimicrobial]] treatment provides preliminary coverage for a variety of bacteria, including ''S. aureus'' and ''S. pyogenes.'' <ref name=Brook />  Antimicrobial options include penicillinase-resistant penicillins (ex: [[cloxacillin]], [[dicloxacillin]]) or a combination of a penicillin and a [[beta-lactamase inhibitor]].<ref name=Brook />  However, in patients with a penicillin allergy, [[clindamycin]] or a [[macrolide]] can be prescribed.<ref name=Brook />  The majority of anaerobic organisms involved with AIT are susceptible to penicillin.  Certain [[Gram-negative bacilli]] (ex: ''[[Prevotella]]'', ''[[Fusobacteria]]'', and ''[[Porphyromonas]]'') are exhibiting an increased resistance based on the production of beta-lactamase.<ref name=Brook />  Patients who have undergone recent penicillin therapy have demonstrated an increase in beta-lactamase-producing (anaerobic and aerobic) bacteria.  Clindamycin, or a combination of [[metronidazole]] and a macrolide, or a penicillin combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor is recommended in these cases.<ref name=Brook />  Fungal thyroiditis can be treated with [[amphotericin B]] and [[fluconazole]].<ref name=Lazarus />  Early treatment of AIT prevents further complications.  However, if antibiotic treatment does not manage the infection, surgical drainage is required.  Symptoms or indications requiring drainage include continued fever, high white blood cell count, and continuing signs of localized inflammation.<ref name=Brook />  The draining procedure is also based on clinical examination or ultrasound/[[CT scan]] results that indicate an [[abscess]] or gas formation.<ref name=Brook />  Another treatment of AIT involves surgically removing the fistula.  This treatment is often the option recommended for children.<ref name=Lazarus />  However, in cases of an antibiotic resistant infection or [[necrotic tissue]], a [[lobectomy]] is recommended.<ref name=Brook />  If diagnosis and/or treatment is delayed, the disease could prove fatal.<ref name=Pearce />
