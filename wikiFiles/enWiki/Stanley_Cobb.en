'''Stanley Cobb''' (December 10, 1887 – February 25, 1968) was a [[neurologist]] and could be considered "the founder of [[biological psychiatry]] in the [[United States]]".<ref name="shorter1988">{{cite book| title = A History of Psychiatry : From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac| first = Edward| last = Shorter| year = 1998| month = March| publisher = Wiley| isbn = 0-471-24531-3| page = 263}}</ref>

==Early life==
Cobb was born on December 10, 1887 in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] to John Candler Cobb.<ref name="Kubie1969">{{cite journal| author=Kubie LS| title=Stanley Cobb, M.D. 1887-1968| journal=Psychosom Med| year=1969| pages=97–106| volume=31| issue=2| pmid= 4891206}}</ref>  His great grandmother, Augusta Adams Cobb, abandoned her husband and married Mormon prophet [[Brigham Young]] as his third wife (out of some 56 wives) in 1843. Cobb's childhood and education were affected by his [[stammer]], which it is suggested led him to study the neurosciences in an attempt to understand its cause. He married Elizabeth Mason Almy in 1915.<ref name="White1984Abridged">{{cite web| author = Benjamin V. White| url = http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cobb.html| title = Stanley Cobb: Neurologist and Psychiatrist| work = Notable American Unitarians| accessdate = 2006-02-23}}</ref>  

Cobb studied at and later went on to work for the [[Harvard Medical School]]. In 1922, Cobb was asked to discover why patients with [[epilepsy]] had improved when they were starved. He recruited [[William G. Lennox|William Lennox]] as an assistant to investigate the [[ketogenic diet]] that had been proposed as being as effective as starvation in the treatment of epilepsy.<ref name="Shorvon2004">{{cite book| last = S. D. Shorvon (ed)| coauthors = David R. Fish (ed), Emilio Perucca (ed), W. Edwin Dodson (ed)| title = The Treatment of Epilepsy| year = 2004| month = March| publisher = Blackwell| isbn = 0-632-06046-8| page = xx–xxii}}</ref> In 1925 he was named Harvard's Bullard Professor of Neuropathology.

==Career==

In 1930, he was appointed director of the newly opened Harvard Neurological Unit at [[Boston City Hospital]]. When Cobb moved to the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in 1934, he was succeeded by Tracey Putnam. Cobb built the department of psychiatry at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He championed psychoanalysis, giving it respectability when others in that conservative hospital disapproved. He published an annual review of neuropsychiatry in the ''Archive of Internal Medicine'' from 1935 to 1959.

When [[Carl Jung]] was invited in 1936 to receive an honorary degree by Harvard, he stayed with Cobb. Jung "put his shoes outside his bedroom door to have them shined. Cobb polished them".<ref name="Kaufmann1992">{{cite book| title = Freud, Adler, and Jung (Discovering the Mind, Volume 3)| first = Walter Arnold| last = Kaufmann| year = 1992| month = June| publisher = Transaction Publishers| isbn = 0-88738-395-5| page = 427}}</ref>

==Retirement==

When he retired in 1954, Cobb directed his interest towards the study of [[bird|avian]] neurology. He was passionately opposed to the widespread spraying of [[DDT]]. After his favourite pond was sprayed, he was angered to write "Death of a Salt Pond," a difficult task, since he was virtually blind by then. This was first published in a local paper but interest gathered and it achieved widespread circulation after being republished in the ''[[National Audubon Society|Audubon]]'' Magazine in May, 1963.

Cobb died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on February 25, 1968 at the age of 80.<ref>{{cite news |title=Obituary 3 - No Title |page=A8 |author= |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1968-02-27 |url= |accessdate=|quote=Dr. Stanley Cobb, 80, pioneer investigator of mental illness and diseases of the nervous system, professor emeritus at Harvard university; in Cambridge, Mass. }}</ref>

==Mind-body problem==
Throughout his professional career, Cobb was troubled by the attempts of medical scientists to draw hard-and-fast distinctions between ''mental'' and ''physical'' symptoms, between ''psychic'' and ''somatic'' causes, between ''functional'' and ''organic'' diseases, and even between ''psychology'' and ''physiology''. Cobb addressed the [[mind-body problem]] in ''Borderlands of Psychiatry'' (1943):

<blockquote>I solve the mind-body problem by stating that ''there is no such problem''. There are, of course, plenty of problems concerning the "mind", and the "body", and all intermediate levels of integration of the nervous system. What I wish to emphasize is that there is no problem of "mind" ''versus'' "body", because biologically no such dichotomy can be made. The dichotomy is an artefact; there is no truth in it, and the discussion has no place in science in 1943... The difference between psychology and physiology is merely one of complexity. The simpler bodily processes are studied in physiological departments; the more complex ones that entail the highest levels of neural integration are studied in psychological departments. There is no biological significance to this division; it is simply an administrative affair, so that the university president will know what salary goes to which professor.<ref>{{cite book| first = Stanley| last = Cobb| title = Borderlands of psychiatry| publisher = Harvard University Press| month = January| year = 1943|pages=19–21}}</ref></blockquote>
