'''Rhabdomyoma''' is a benign mesenchymal tumor of skeletal muscle, separated into two major categories based on site: Cardiac and extracardiac. They are further separated by histology: fetal (myxoid and cellular), juveline (intermediate), and adult types. Genital types are recognized, but are often part of either the fetal or juveline types. The fetal type is thought to recapitulate [[Skeletal muscle|immature skeletal muscle]] at about week six to ten of gestational development.

== Signs and symtoms ==
Most fetal rhabdomyomas are tumors that develop in the head and neck or in the genital region.<ref>Lapner PC, Chou S, Jimenez C. Perianal fetal rhabdomyoma: case report. Pediatr Surg Int 1997;12(7):544-7.</ref> There are a number of cases which have been seen in association with [[Gorlin syndrome]].<ref>Watson J, Depasquale K, Ghaderi M, Zwillenberg S.

== Pathophysiology ==
=== Gross pathology ===
The tumor may be seen within the subcutaneous tissues (below the skin),<ref>Walsh SN, Hurt MA. Cutaneous fetal rhabdomyoma: a case report and historical review of the literature. Am J Surg Pathol 2008:Mar;32(3):485-91.</ref> mucosal surfaces or in soft tissue. Within the head and neck, the posterior ear region, skin of the face, and the tongue are the most commonly affected sites (about a 2:1 ratio of soft tissue to mucosa).<ref>Kapadia SB, Meis JM, Frisman DM, Ellis GL, Heffner DK. Fetal rhabdomyoma of the head and neck: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 24 cases. Hum Pathol 1993;24(7):754-65.</ref><ref>Willis J, Abdul-Karim FW, di Sant'Agnese PA. Extracardiac rhabdomyomas. Semin Diagn Pathol 1994;11(1):15-25.</ref> The tumors are well defined, non-specific usually solitary masses, but when seen in the head and neck (or genital region), they may be polypoid. Tumors range in size from a few millimeters up to 12.5&nbsp;cm, with a mean of about 3.0&nbsp;cm. Although there are isolated case reports, multifocality is very rare.

=== Microscopic pathology ===
[[File:Fetal Rhabdomyoma Ear HE LDRT.tif|thumb|A hematoxylin and eosin stained image (high power) of the short spindle cells of a fetal rhabdomyoma.]]Fetal rhabdomyoma are separated into two histologic types: Myxoid and cellular.<ref>Willis J, Abdul-Karim FW, di Sant'Agnese PA. Extracardiac rhabdomyomas. Semin Diagn Pathol 1994;11(1):15-25.</ref><ref>Kapadia SB, Meis JM, Frisman DM, Ellis GL, Heffner DK. Fetal rhabdomyoma of the head and neck: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 24 cases. Hum Pathol 1993;24(7):754-65.</ref> However, irrespective of histologic type, these tumors almost never show necrosis or increased mitoses. However, a [[Periosteum|cambium]] layer, abnormal mitoses and nuclear pleomorphism is not seen.
Cellular fetal rhabdomyomas are composed of bland, primitive spindled cells. The spindle cells are haphazardly arranged primitive, elongated skeletal muscle cells. The cells are set within a well developed fibromyxoid stroma. A different pattern (intermediate type) is predominantly composed of cells with better differentiation towards skeletal muscle. There are often large ganglion cell-like rhabdomyoblasts showing prominent nucleoli within nuclei that show vesicular chromatin distribution. Another population includes strap-like rhabdomyoblasts with darkly staining pink cytoplasm. Nearly all tumors show short to more sweeping fascicles of spindled rhabdomyoblasts. The tumor cells may infiltrate into adjacent skeletal muscle or fat. It is not uncommon to see peri-neural association, although not perineural infiltration.<ref>Kapadia SB, Meis JM, Frisman DM, Ellis GL, Heffner DK.

==Diagnosis==
These tumors may be detected prenatally by ultrasound and MRI.<ref>O'Callaghan MG, House M, Ebay S, Bhadelia R. Rhabdomyoma of the head and neck demonstrated by prenatal magnetic resonance imaging. J Comput Assist Tomogr 2005;29(1):130-2</ref> Additionally, preoperative fine needle aspiration can be used to diagnose the tumor.<ref>al Rikabi AC, al Kharfy T, al Sohaibani MO, al Samarrai AI. Fetal rhabdomyoma. A case report with the diagnosis suggested by intraoperative cytology. Acta Cytol 1996;40(4):786-8.</ref>

=== Ancillary testing ===
A phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin stain may be used to highlight cross striations in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. PAS with diastase will highlight the presence of glycogen in the tumor cells' cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry will yield a positive reaction with a variety of myoid markers, including desmin, myoglobin, myogenin, MYOD1 and muscle specific actin. They may also be positive with vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and Leu-7.  However, the tumor cells are almost always negative with glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100 protein, cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, CD68, FLI1, CD99 and CD56. Although not used as frequently now, electron microscopy will show thick and thin myofilaments, Z-bands: these are features of sarcometric differentiation.<ref>Kapadia SB, Meis JM, Frisman DM, Ellis GL, Heffner DK. Fetal rhabdomyoma of the head and neck: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 24 cases. Hum Pathol 1993;24(7):754-65.</ref>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
The differential diagnosis histologically includes [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], [[granular cell tumor]], [[alveolar soft part sarcoma]], [[hibernoma]], [[oncocytoma]], and crystal storing histiocytosis, among others.<ref>Kapadia SB, Meis JM, Frisman DM, Ellis GL, Heffner DK. Fetal rhabdomyoma of the head and neck: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 24 cases. Hum Pathol 1993;24(7):754-65.</ref>

== Management ==
Surgical excision is the treatment of choice.<ref>Kapadia SB, Meis JM, Frisman DM, Ellis GL, Heffner DK. Fetal rhabdomyoma of the head and neck: a clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic study of 24 cases. Hum Pathol 1993;24(7):754-65.</ref> Recurrences are reported, but this is usually due to incomplete removal initially.<ref>Valdez TA, Desai U, Volk MS. Recurrent fetal rhabdomyoma of the head and neck. Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol 2006:70(6);1115-8.</ref><ref>Smith NM, Thornton CM. Fetal rhabdomyoma: two instances of recurrence. Pediatr Pathol Lab Med 1996;16(4):673-80.</ref> There is no role for chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

==Epidemiology==
They present over a wide age range (birth to about 65 years), but within the head and neck region, about 50% of cases develop in patients younger than 15 years of age. Within the head and neck, males are affected about 2â€“3 times more often than females.<ref>Kapadia SB, Meis JM, Frisman DM, Ellis GL, Heffner DK.
