A '''premature ventricular contraction (PVC)''', also known as a '''premature ventricular complex''', '''ventricular premature contraction (or complex or complexes) (VPC)''', '''ventricular premature beat (VPB)''', or '''ventricular extrasystole (VES)''', is a relatively common event where the [[heart rate|heartbeat]] is initiated by Purkinje fibres in the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s rather than by the [[sinoatrial node]], the normal heartbeat initiator. The electrical events of the heart detected by the [[electrocardiogram]] allow a PVC to be easily distinguished from a normal heart beat.

A PVC may be perceived as a "[[skipped beat]]" or felt as [[palpitations]] in the chest.
In a normal heartbeat, the ventricles contract after the atria have helped to fill them by contracting; in this way the ventricles can pump a maximized amount of blood both to the lungs and to the rest of the body. In a PVC, the ventricles contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the ventricles with blood, which means that circulation is inefficient. However, single beat PVC [[arrhythmia]]s do not usually pose a danger and can be asymptomatic in healthy individuals.<ref>{{Citation

==Signs and symptoms==
Although there are many signs and symptoms associated with PVCs, PVCs may have no symptom at all. An isolated PVC is hard to catch without the use of a holter monitor. PVCs may be perceived as a skipped heart beat, a strong beat, or a feeling of suction in the chest.  They may also cause chest pain, a faint feeling, fatigue, or [[hyperventilation]] after exercise.<ref name="ganz"/>  Several PVCs in a row becomes a form of [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT), which is a dangerous rapid heartbeat.

Some other possible signs and symptoms of PVCs:

* Abnormal EKG
* Irregular heart beat
* Shortness of breath
* Dizziness 
* Feeling your heart beat ([[palpitations]]) 
* Feeling of occasional, forceful beats
* Increased awareness of your heart beat

==Diagnosis==

PVCs are usually diagnosed after the patient has described “skipped beats”, pauses or palpitations. Typically the palpitations felt by PVC patients are very irregular and less sustained than patients with other types of arrhythmia. They are likely to have “flip flopping” sensations where it feels like the heart is flipping over or pounding due to there being a pause after the premature contraction and then a powerful contraction after the pause.  There is a possibility that they might feel a ‘fluttering’ in their chest or a pounding in their neck but these two types of palpitations aren’t very common in PVC patients.<ref name="zimetbaum">{{Citation |author=Zimetbaum P, Josephson ME |title=Evaluation of patients with palpitations |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=338 |issue=19 |pages=1369–73 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9571258 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199805073381907|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/19/1369}}</ref>

A physical examination should be conducted after a full history has been taken. This is useful in determining any possible heart defects that might be causing the palpitations. For example, some cases of premature ventricular contraction have a mitral-valve prolapse which can be determined through the physical examination.<ref name="zimetbaum"/>
The next step in diagnosis is a 12 lead ECG which can be performed in the doctors’ office over a short period of time however this is often non-conclusive in diagnosis because it is not very sensitive and there is only a small chance of a premature ventricular contraction occurring in the short period of time. [[Holter]] monitoring is a far better method for diagnosis as it is continuous recording of the heart’s rhythm over a period of 24 hours, or event monitoring which records noncontinuously for 30 days or indefinitely. This increases the likelihood of a premature ventricular contraction occurring during the recording period and is therefore more useful in diagnosis.<ref>{{Citation |author=Meurs KM, Spier AW, Wright NA, Hamlin RL |title=Comparison of in-hospital versus 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography for detection of ventricular premature complexes in mature Boxers |journal=J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. |volume=218 |issue=2 |pages=222–4 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11195827 |doi=10.2460/javma.2001.218.222 }}</ref>

When looking at an electrocardiograph premature ventricular contractions are easily spotted and therefore a definitive diagnosis can be made. The QRS and T waves look very different to normal readings. The spacing between the PVC and the preceding QRS wave is a lot shorter than usual and the time between the PVC and the proceeding QRS is a lot longer. However, the time between the preceding and proceeding QRS waves stays the same as normal due to the compensatory pause.<ref name="levy">{{harvnb|Levy|2007|pp=49–50}}</ref>
PVCs can be distinguished from premature atrial contractions because the compensatory pause is longer following premature ventricular contractions.<ref name="gomella">{{Citation |author=Haist, Steven A.; Gomella, Leonard G. |title=Clinician's pocket reference |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2004 |page=390 |isbn=0-07-140255-1 |edition=10th |chapter=19 Basic ECG Reading: Ventricular Arrhythmias |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=KaegPx6LK2sC&pg=PA390&dq=unifocal+premature+ventricular+contraction&client}}</ref>

There are four different [[numbering aberrant rhythms|named patterns]] of regularly occurring PVCs. Depending whether there are 1, 2, or 3 normal beats between each PVC, the rhythm is called bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy.  A unifocal PVC is where the depolarisation is triggered from the one site in the ventricle causing the peaks on the ECG to look the same. Multifocal PVCs arise when more than one site in the ventricles initiate depolarisation causing each peak on the ECG to have a different shape. If 3 or more PVCs occur in a row it may be called [[Ventricular tachycardia]].<ref name="gomella"/>

==Treatment==

Isolated PVCs with benign characteristics require no treatment.
In healthy individuals, PVCs can often be resolved by restoring the balance of [[magnesium]], [[calcium]] and [[potassium]] within the body.
The most effective treatment is the elimination of triggers (particularly the cessation of the use of substances such as [[caffeine]], and certain drugs.)
*	Pharmacological agents
**      [[Antiarrhythmics]]:<ref name="keany"/> these agents alter the electrophysiologic mechanisms responsible for PVCs
**	[[Beta blocker]]s<ref name="ganz"/>
**	Calcium channel blockers<ref name="ganz"/>
*	Electrolytes replacement
**	Magnesium supplements (e.g. magnesium citrate, orotate, Maalox, etc.)
**	Potassium supplements
*	Radiofrequency catheter ablation treatment<ref name="ganz"/>
*	Lifestyle modification
**	Frequently stressed individuals should consider therapy, or joining a [[support group]].
**	Heart attacks can increase the likelihood of having PVCs.<ref name="ganz"/>

In the setting of existing cardiac disease, however, PVCs must be watched carefully, as they may cause a form of [[ventricular tachycardia]] (rapid heartbeat).

Recent studies have shown that those subjects who have an extremely high occurrence of PVCs (several thousand a day) can develop [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]. In these cases, if the PVCs are reduced or removed (for example, via ablation therapy) the cardiomyopathy usually regresses.<ref>{{Citation |author=Belhassen B |title=Radiofrequency ablation of "benign" right ventricular outflow tract extrasystoles: a therapy that has found its disease? In patients with no known coronary artery disease (CAD), the presence of frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is linked to acute myocardial infarction and sudden death. The Framingham Heart Study defines frequent as >30 PVCs per hour. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend evaluation for CAD in patients who have frequent PVCs and cardiac risk factors, such as hypertension and smoking (SOR C). Evaluation for CAD may include stress testing, echocardiography, and ambulatory rhythm monitoring  |journal=J. Am. Coll.

==Pathophysiology==

Normally impulses pass through both ventricles almost simultaneously and the depolarization waves of the two ventricles partially cancel each other out in the ECG. However, when a PVC occurs the impulse nearly always travels in one direction, so there is no neutralisation effect; this results in the high voltage QRS wave in the electrocardiograph.

There are two main physiological explanations for premature ventricular contractions: [[Cardiac dysrhythmia#Re-entry|re-entrant signalling]] and “enhanced automaticity in some [[ectopic focus]]”. The enhanced automaticity means that the ectopic centre fires more regularly than usual and is protected from depolarisation that results in premature contractions.<ref name="levy"/>{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}

==Molecular basis==

There are a number of different molecular explanations for PVCs. One explanation is most basically due to an increased amount of [[cyclic AMP]](cAMP) in the ventricular cardiac myocytes leading to increased flow of calcium ions into the cell. This may happen for the following reasons:

*Activation of the sympathetic nervous system, due to anxiety and/or physiological stress, for example [[hypovolemia]] caused by [[dehydration]] or [[hemorrhage]]. This activation can cause a release of [[catecholamines]] such as [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) which can bind to [[beta-1 adrenergic receptor]] (β<sub>1</sub> receptors) on cardiac myocytes, activating a type of guanosine nucleotide-binding protein called [[Gs (protein)|G<sub>s</sub> protein]].<ref name="nelson">{{harvnb|Nelson|2008|p=424}}</ref> This type of protein stimulates the production of cAMP,<ref>{{harvnb|Levy|2007|p=62}}</ref> ultimately increasing the flow of calcium ions from the extracellular space and from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol.<ref>{{harvnb|Levy|2007|p=24}}</ref><br /> This has the effect of (1) increasing the strength of contraction (inotropy) and (2) depolarizing the myocyte more rapidly (chronotropy). The ventricular myocytes are therefore more irritable than usual, and may depolarize spontaneously before the SA node depolarizes. Other sympathomimetic molecules such as [[amphetamines]] and [[cocaine]] will also cause this effect.
*Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as [[caffeine]] directly affect the G-coupled signal transduction cascade<ref>{{harvnb|Nelson|2008|p=430}}</ref> by inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of cAMP,<ref name="nelson"/> again leading to the increased concentration of calcium ions in the cytosol.

[[Potassium]] ion concentrations are a major determinant in the magnitude of the electrochemical potential of cells, and [[hypokalemia]] makes it more likely that cells will depolarize spontaneously. [[Hypercalcemia]] has a similar effect, although clinically it is of less concern. [[Magnesium]] ions affect the flow of [[calcium]] ions, and they affect the function of the [[Na+/K+ ATPase]], and are necessary for maintaining potassium levels. [[Hypomagnesemia]] therefore also makes spontaneous depolarization more likely.

Existing damage to the myocardium can also provoke PVCs. The [[myocardial scarring]] that occurs in [[myocardial infarction]] and also in the surgical repair of [[congenital heart disease]] can disrupt the conduction system of the heart and may also irritate surrounding viable ventricular myocytes, make them more likely to depolarize spontaneously. Inflammation of the myocardium (as occurs in [[myocarditis]]) and systemic inflammation cause surges of [[cytokines]], which can affect the electrical properties of myocytes and may be ultimately responsible for causing irritability of myocytes.
