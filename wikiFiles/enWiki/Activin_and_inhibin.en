'''Activin''' and '''inhibin''' are two closely related [[protein]] [[multiprotein complex|complex]]es that have almost directly opposite biological effects.  '''Activin''' enhances [[follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] [[biosynthesis]] and [[secretion]], and participates in the regulation of the [[menstrual cycle]].

== Function ==
=== Activin ===

Activin is produced in the [[gonad]]s, [[pituitary gland]], [[placenta]], and other organs:

* In the [[ovarian follicle]], activin increases FSH binding and FSH-induced [[Aromaticity|aromatization]]. It participates in [[androgen]] synthesis enhancing [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] action in the [[ovary]] and [[Testicle|testis]]. In the male, activin enhances [[spermatogenesis]].

* Activin is strongly expressed in wounded [[skin]], and overexpression of activin in [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic]] [[Mouse|mice]] improves wound healing and enhances [[scar]] formation.  Its action in wound repair and skin [[morphogenesis]] is through stimulation of [[keratinocyte]]s and [[stromal cell]]s in a dose-dependent manner.<ref name="pmid16127153">{{cite journal | author = Bamberger C, Schärer A, Antsiferova M, Tychsen B, Pankow S, Müller M, Rülicke T, Paus R, Werner S | title = Activin Controls Skin Morphogenesis and Wound Repair Predominantly via Stromal Cells and in a Concentration-Dependent Manner via Keratinocytes | journal = Am. J. Pathol. | volume = 167 | issue = 3 | pages = 733–47 | year = 2005 | month = September | pmid = 16127153 | pmc = 1698729 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62047-0| url = http://ajp.amjpathol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16127153 }}</ref>

* Activin also regulates the [[morphogenesis]] of branching organs such as the [[prostate]], [[lung]], and especially [[kidney]].  Activin A increased the expression level of [[type-I collagen]] suggesting that activin A acts as a potent activator of [[fibroblast]]s.

* Lack of activin during development results in neural developmental defects.

=== Inhibin ===

In both females and males, inhibin inhibits [[follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] production.  Inhibin does not inhibit the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus (First Aid for the USMLE Step1, 2012 (McGraw Hill), page 534) However, the overall mechanism differs between the sexes:

==== In females ====

Inhibin is produced in the [[gonads]], [[pituitary gland]], [[placenta]], [[corpus luteum]] and other organs.

FSH stimulates the secretion of inhibin from the [[granulosa cell]]s of the ovarian follicles in the [[ovary|ovaries]]. In turn, inhibin suppresses FSH.

* ''Inhibin B'' reaches a peak in the early- to mid-[[menstrual cycle|follicular phase]], and a second peak at [[ovulation]].

* ''Inhibin A'' reaches its peak in the mid-[[menstrual cycle|luteal phase]].

Inhibin secretion is diminished by [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]], and enhanced by [[insulin-like growth factor]]-1 (IGF-1).

==== In males ====

It is secreted from the [[Sertoli cell]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Skinner M, McLachlan R, Bremner W |title=Stimulation of Sertoli cell inhibin secretion by the testicular paracrine factor PModS |journal=Mol Cell Endocrinol |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=239–49 |year=1989 |pmid=2515083 |doi=10.1016/0303-7207(89)90036-1}}</ref> located in the [[seminiferous tubules]] inside the [[testes]]. [[Androgens]] stimulate inhibin production; this [[protein]] may also help to locally regulate [[spermatogenesis]].

== Mechanism of action ==
=== Activin ===

As with other members of the superfamily, activins interact with two types of cell surface [[transmembrane receptor]]s (Types I and II) which have intrinsic [[Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase|serine/threonine kinase]] activities in their cytoplasmic domains:

* [[Activin type 1 receptors]]: [[ACVR1]], [[ACVR1B]], [[ACVR1C]]
* [[Activin type 2 receptors]]: [[ACVR2A]], [[ACVR2B]]

Activin binds to the Type II receptor and initiates a cascade reaction that leads to the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of Type I activin receptor.  This then interacts with and then phosphorylates [[Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2|SMAD2]] and [[Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3|SMAD3]], two of the cytoplasmic [[R-SMAD|SMAD]] proteins.

Smad3 then translocates to the nucleus and interacts with [[Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4|SMAD4]] through multimerization, resulting in their modulation as [[transcription factor]] complexes responsible for the expression of a large variety of genes.

=== Inhibin ===

In contrast to activin, much less is known about the mechanism of action of inhibin, but may involve competing with activin for binding to activin receptors and/or binding to inhibin-specific receptors.<ref name="pmid15027884"/>

== Clinical significance ==

Quantification of inhibin A is part of the prenatal [[quad screen]] that can be administered during pregnancy at a gestational age of 16–18 weeks. An elevated inhibin A (along with an increased [[beta-hCG]], decreased [[Alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]], and a decreased [[estriol]]) is suggestive of the presence of a fetus with [[Down syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aitken D, Wallace E, Crossley J, Swanston I, van Pareren Y, van Maarle M, Groome N, Macri J, Connor J |title=Dimeric inhibin A as a marker for Down syndrome in early pregnancy |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=334 |issue=19 |pages=1231–6 |year=1996 |pmid=8606718 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/334/19/1231 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199605093341904 }}</ref> As a screening test, abnormal quad screen test results need to be followed up with more definitive tests.

Inhibin B may be used as a marker of [[spermatogenesis]] function and [[male infertility]]. The mean serum inhibin B level is significantly higher among fertile men (approximately 140 pg/mL) than in infertile men (approximately 80 pg/mL).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Myers GM, Lambert-Messerlian GM, Sigman M |title=Inhibin B reference data for fertile and infertile men in Northeast America |journal=Fertil.
