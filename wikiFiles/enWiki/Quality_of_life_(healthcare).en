'''Quality of Life''' (QoL) is a phrase used to refer to an individual’s total [[wellbeing]]. This includes all [[emotional]], [[social]], and physical aspects of the individual’s life. However, when the phrase is used in reference to [[medicine]] and [[healthcare]] as Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), it refers to how the individual’s wellbeing may be impacted over time by a [[disease]], a [[disability]], or a [[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]].<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/hrqol CDC - Health-Related Quality of Life - HRQOL]</ref>

==Ascertaining Health Related Quality of Life==
Initial HRQoL measures referred to simple assessments of physical abilities by an external rater (e.g.: patient is able to get up, eat and drink, take care of personal hygiene without any help by others), or even to a single measurement (e.g. the angle to which a limb could be flexed). 

The current concept of HRQoL acknowledges that subjects put their actual situation in relation to their personal expectation.<ref name="hqlo.com">[http://www.hqlo.com/content/8/1/133/abstract HQLO | Abstract | Health-related quality of life in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients during treatment with glatiramer acetate: a prospective, observational, int...]</ref> The latter can vary over time, and react to external influences such as length and severity of illness, family support, etc. As with any situation involving multiple perspectives, patients' and physicians' rating of the same objective situation have been found to differ significantly. Consequently, HRQoL is now usually assessed using patient questionnaires. These are often multidimensional and cover physical, [[social]], [[emotional]], [[cognitive]], work- or role-related, and possibly [[Spirituality|spiritual]] aspects as well as a wide variety of disease related symptoms, therapy induced side effects, and even the financial impact of medical conditions.<ref>[http://www.hqlo.com/content/1/1/60 HQLO | Full text | The Quality of Life Scale (QOLS): Reliability, Validity, and Utilization]</ref> Although often used interchangeably with the measurement of health status, both HRQoL and health status measure different concepts.

Similar to other [[psychometrics|psychometric]] assessment tools, HRQoL questionnaires should meet certain quality criteria, most importantly with regard to their reliability and validity. As such, hundreds of validated HRQoL questionnaires have been developed to suit the needs of various illnesses. The questionnaires can be generalized into two categories: 
# Generic instruments (e.g. SF-36, Short-Form with 36 questions)
# Disease, disorder or condition specific instruments (e.g. the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) or the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) in urinary incontinence,<ref name="HirakawaT2013Randomized">
{{cite journal|last=Hirakawa|first=T|coauthors=Suzuki, S; Kato, K; Gotoh, M; Yoshikawa, Y|title=Randomized controlled trial of pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback for urinary incontinence|journal=Int Urogynecol J.|date=2013-01-11|pmid=23306768}}</ref> the LC -13 Lung Cancer module from the [[European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer|EORTC]] Quality of Life questionnaire library, or the [[Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale]] (HADS) ).

===Frequent Statistical Anomalies===
It is not considered uncommon for there to be some [[statistic]]al anomalies during data analysis. Some of the more frequently seen in HRQoL analysis are the [[ceiling effect]], the floor effect, and response shift bias.

The ceiling effect refers to how patients who start with a higher quality of life than the average patient do not have much room for improvement when treated. The opposite of this is the floor effect, where patients with a lower quality of life average have much more room for improvement.<ref name="hqlo.com"/> Consequentially, if the spectrum of quality of life before treatment is too unbalanced, there is a greater potential for skewing the end results, creating the possibility for incorrectly portraying a treatment's effectiveness or lack thereof.

====Response Shift Bias====
Response shift bias is an increasing problem within longitudinal studies that rely on [[patient-reported outcome|patient reported outcomes]].<ref>[http://www.hqlo.com/content/3/1/55 HQLO | Full text | Response shift masks the treatment impact on patient reported outcomes (PROs): the example of individual quality of life in edentulous patients]</ref> It refers to the potential of a subject’s views, values, or expectations changing over the course of a study, thereby adding an additional factor of change on the end results. [[Clinicians]] and [[health care providers|healthcare providers]] must recalibrate surveys over the course of a study to account for Response Shift Bias.<ref>[http://www.hqlo.com/content/3/1/38 HQLO | Full text | Response shift and glycemic control in children with diabetes]</ref> The degree of recalibration varies due to factors based on the individual area of investigation and length of study.

===Frequently Used HRQoL Measures===
Here are some examples of frequently used HRQoL questionnaires:
*[http://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/hrqol14_measure.htm Healthy Day Measures]: A questionnaire with four base questions and ten optional questions used by the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).
*[[SF-36|Short-Form Health Survey]]: One example of a widely used questionnaire assessing physical, social, and mental HRQoL, used in clinical trials. Suitable for [[pharmacoeconomics|pharmacoeconomic]] analysis, benefiting healthcare rationing.
*[[Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life]]: 16-item questionnaire for use in psychiatric populations.
*[[EQ-5D]] a simple quality of life questionnaire.
*[http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/research_tools/whoqolbref/en/ WHO-Quality of life BREF]: A general Quality of life survey validated for several countries.

==What is the HRQoL used for?==
A variety of validated surveys exist for [[health care providers|healthcare providers]] to use for measuring a patient’s Health Related Quality of Life. The results are then used to help determine [[therapy|treatment]] options for the patient based on past results from other patients.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/ CDC - Health-Related Quality of Life - HRQOL]</ref>

When it is used as a [[longitudinal study]] device that surveys patients before, during, and after treatment, it can help [[health care providers]] determine which treatment plan is the best option, thereby improving healthcare through an evolutionary process.

===Why is it important?===
There is a growing field of research concerned with developing, evaluating, and applying quality of life measures within health related research (e.g. within [[randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled studies]], especially in relation to [[Health Services Research]]. Well-executed HRQoL research informs those tasked with health rationing or anyone involved in the [[decision-making]] process of agencies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[European Medicines Agency]] or [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Marquis P, Caron M, Emery M-P, et al. |title=The Role of Health-Related Quality of Life Data in the Drug Approval Processes in the US and Europe: A Review of Guidance Documents and Authorizations of Medicinal Products from 2006 to 2010 |url= http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2011/25030/The_Role_of_Health_Related_Quality_of_Life_Data_in.2.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=147–60 |year=2011}}</ref> Additionally, HRQoL research may be used as the final step in [[clinical trials]] of experimental therapies.

The understanding of Quality of Life is recognized as an increasingly important healthcare topic because the relationship between cost and value raises complex problems, often with high emotional attachment because of the potential impact on human life. For instance, healthcare providers must refer to [[cost-benefit analysis]] to make economic decisions about access to expensive drugs that may prolong life by short amount of time and/or provide a minimal increase to quality of life. Additionally, these treatment drugs must be weighed against the cost of alternative treatments or [[preventative medicine]]. In the case of chronic and/or terminal illness where no effective cure is available, an emphasis is placed on improving HRQoL through interventions such as [http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?CdrID=269453 symptom management], [[adaptive technology]], and [[palliative care]].

===Future Implications of HRQoL===
The [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) is using their HRQoL survey, [http://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/hrqol14_measure.htm Healthy Day Measures], as part of research to identify health disparities, track population trends, and build broad coalitions around a measure of population health. This information can then be used by multiple levels of government or other officials to "increase quality and years of life" and to "eliminate health disparaties" for equal opportunity.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/methods.html</ref>

==Research Pertaining to HRQoL==
	Research revolving around Health Related Quality of Life is extremely important because of the implications that it can have on current and future treatments and health protocols. Thereby, validated HRQoL questionnaires can become an integral part of clinical trials in determining the trial drugs' value in a cost-benefit analysis.

===The Remarkable .5 of Standard Deviation===
[[File:Standard deviation diagram.svg|thumb|Standard deviation]]
	In a study by Norman et al. about HRQoL surveys, it was found that most survey results were within a half [[standard deviation]]. Norman et al. theorized that this is due to the limited human discrimination ability as identified by [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] in 1956. Utilizing the [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|Magic Number of 7 ± 2]], Miller theorized that when the scale on a survey extends beyond 7 ± 2, humans fail to be consistent and lose ability to differentiate individual steps on the scale because of [[channel capacity]].

	Norman et al. proposed HRQoL surveys use a half standard deviation as the statistically significant benefit of a treatment instead of calculating survey-specific “minimally important differences", which are the supposed real-life improvements reported by the subjects.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12719681 | doi=10.1097/01.MLR.0000062554.74615.4C | volume=41 | issue=5 | title=Interpretation of changes in health-related quality of life: the remarkable universality of half a standard deviation | year=2003 | month=May | author=Norman GR, Sloan JA, Wyrwich KW | journal=Med Care | pages=582–92}}</ref> In other words, Norman et al. proposed all HRQoL survey scales be set to a half standard deviation instead of calculating a scale for each survey validation study where the steps are referred to as "minimally important differences".

==Ethics for HRQoL==
The '''quality of life''' ethic refers to an ethical principle that uses assessments of the quality of life that a person could potentially experience as a foundation for making decisions about the continuation or termination of life. It is often used in contrast to or in opposition to the [[sanctity of life]] ethic.
