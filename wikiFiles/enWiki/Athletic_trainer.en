An '''athletic trainer''' is a certified health care professional who practices in the field of sports medicine. Athletic training has been recognized by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) as an allied health care profession since 1990.<ref name="What is an Athletic Trainer">{{Cite journal|author=|coauthors=|title=What is an Athletic Trainer?|year=2007|journal=The Board of Certification Website|issue=|pages=|url=http://www.bocatc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=100&Itemid=105/}}</ref>

As defined by the Strategic Implementation Team of the [[National Athletic Trainers' Association]] (NATA) in August 2007:<ref>{{Cite journal|author=|coauthors=|title=Strategic implementation team defines profession|year=2007|journal=NATA News|issue=12/2007|pages=14|url=http://news.nata.org/}}</ref>

<blockquote>"Athletic training is practiced by athletic trainers, health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and participation of patients and clients. Athletic training encompasses the prevention, diagnosis<ref name="RDPA6">http://www.bocatc.org/images/stories/resources/rdpa6_content_outline.pdf</ref> and intervention of emergency, acute and chronic medical conditions involving impairment, functional limitations and disabilities."</blockquote>

To become an athletic trainer one must have a degree from an accredited professional level education program and then sit and pass the Board of Certification (BOC) examination. Each state then has their own regulatory agencies that control the practice of athletic training in their state. Most states (39) requires an athletic trainer to obtain a license in order to practice in that state, 5 states (Colorado, Hawaii, Minnesota, Oregon, West Virginia) require registration, 4 states (Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, South Carolina) require certification, while California and Alaska have no state regulations on the practice of athletic training.<ref>http://www.bocatc.org/state-regulation/map</ref>
Areas of expertise of certified athletic trainers include Risk Management and Injury Prevention, Pathology of Injuries and Illnesses, Orthopedic Clinical Examination and Assessment, Medical Conditions and Disabilities, Acute Care of Injuries and Illnesses, Therapeutic Modalities, Conditioning and Rehabilitative Exercises, Pharmacology and Psychosocial Intervention and Referral, Nutritional Aspects of Injuries and Illnesses, Healthcare Administration and "Professional Development and Responsibility". {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
