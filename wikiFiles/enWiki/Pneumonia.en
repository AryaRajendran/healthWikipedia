[[File:Symptoms of pneumonia.svg|thumb|left|alt=A diagram of the human body outlining the key symptoms of pneumonia|300px|Main symptoms of infectious pneumonia]]
People with infectious pneumonia often have a [[cough|productive cough]], [[fever]] accompanied by [[rigors|shaking chills]], [[shortness of breath]], sharp or stabbing [[chest pain]] during deep breaths, and an increased [[respiratory rate]].<ref name=BMJ06/> In the elderly, confusion may be the most prominent sign.<ref name=BMJ06>{{cite journal |author= Hoare Z | coauthors = Lim WS|title=Pneumonia: update on diagnosis and management |journal=BMJ | year= 2006 |pages=1077–9 |pmid=16675815|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7549.1077 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7549/1077.full.pdf |volume=332 |issue= 7549 |pmc= 1458569 |format=PDF}}</ref> The typical signs and symptoms in children under five are fever, cough, and fast or difficult breathing.<ref name=Develop11/>

Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, and may be absent in those with severe disease or [[malnutrition]]. In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old.<ref name=Develop11/> More severe signs and symptoms may include: [[central cyanosis|blue-tinged skin]], decreased thirst, convulsions, persistent vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a [[decreased level of consciousness]].<ref name=Develop11/><ref name=Clinic2011/>

Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia usually present with similar symptoms.<ref name=WHOPrevent2012/> Some causes are associated with classic, but non-specific, clinical characteristics. Pneumonia caused by ''[[Legionella]]'' may occur with abdominal pain, [[diarrhea]], or confusion,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Darby|first=J|coauthors=Buising, K|title=Could it be Legionella?|journal=Australian family physician|date=October 2008 |volume=37|issue=10|pages=812–5|pmid=19002299}}</ref> while pneumonia caused by ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' is associated with rusty colored sputum,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ortqvist|first=A|coauthors=Hedlund, J; Kalin, M|title=Streptococcus pneumoniae: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical features|journal=Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine|date=December 2005|volume=26|issue=6|pages=563–74|pmid=16388428|doi=10.1055/s-2005-925523}}</ref> and pneumonia caused by ''[[Klebsiella]]'' may have bloody sputum often described as "currant jelly".<ref name=Tint10>{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York|year=2010|pages=480 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Bloody sputum (known as [[hemoptysis]]) may also occur with [[tuberculosis]], Gram-negative pneumonia, and lung abscesses as well as more commonly with [[acute bronchitis]].<ref name=Clinic2011/> ''Mycoplasma'' pneumonia may occur in association with [[cervical lymphadenopathy|swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck]], [[arthralgia|joint pain]], or a [[otitis media|middle ear infection]].<ref name=Clinic2011/> Viral pneumonia presents more commonly with [[wheezing]] than does bacterial pneumonia.<ref name=WHOPrevent2012/>

== Cause ==
[[File:Streptococcus pneumoniae.jpg|thumb|alt=Three one round objects in a black background|The bacterium ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', a common cause of pneumonia, imaged by an [[electron microscope]].]]
Pneumonia is primarily due to infections caused by [[bacteria]] or [[virus]]es and less commonly by [[fungi]] and [[parasites]]. Although there are more than 100 strains of infectious agents identified, only a few are responsible for the majority of the cases. Mixed infections with both viruses and bacteria may occur in up to 45% of infections in children and 15% of infections in adults.<ref name=Lancet11/> A causative agent may not be isolated in approximately half of cases despite careful testing.<ref name=EBMED05/>

The term ''pneumonia'' is sometimes more broadly applied to any condition resulting in [[inflammation]] of the lungs (caused for example by [[autoimmune disease]]s, chemical burns or drug reactions); however, this inflammation is more accurately referred to as [[pneumonitis]].<ref name="isbn0-7234-3200-7">{{cite book |author=Lowe, J. F.; Stevens, Alan |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Pathology |edition=2nd |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2000 |page=197 |isbn=0-7234-3200-7 |oclc= |doi= |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AfVxLi4QTZQC&pg=PA197|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Snydman|first=editors, Raleigh A.

Conditions and risk factors that predispose to pneumonia include: smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[chronic kidney disease]], and [[liver disease]].<ref name=Clinic2011/> The use of acid-suppressing medications -such as [[proton-pump inhibitors]] or [[H2 blockers]]- is associated with an increased risk<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eom|first=CS|coauthors=Jeon, CY; Lim, JW; Cho, EG; Park, SM; Lee, KS|title=Use of acid-suppressive drugs and risk of pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne|date=22 February 2011 |volume=183|issue=3|pages=310–9|pmid=21173070|doi=10.1503/cmaj.092129|pmc=3042441}}</ref> of pneumonia. Old age also predisposes pneumonia.<ref name=Clinic2011/>

=== Bacteria ===
{{Main|Bacterial pneumonia}}
Bacteria are the most common cause of [[community-acquired pneumonia]] (CAP), with ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' isolated in nearly 50% of cases.<ref name=Rad07/><ref name=EOP10>{{cite journal |author=Anevlavis S | coauthors = Bouros D |title=Community acquired bacterial pneumonia|journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=361–74 |year=2010 |month=February|pmid=20085502|doi=10.1517/14656560903508770 }}</ref> Other commonly isolated bacteria include: ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' in 20%, ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'' in 13%, and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' in 3% of cases;<ref name=Rad07/> ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''; ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]''; ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'' and [[Gram-negative bacilli]].<ref name=EBMED05/> A number of [[drug resistance|drug-resistant]] versions of the above infections are becoming more common, including drug-resistant ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' (DRSP) and [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA).<ref name=Clinic2011/>

The spreading of organisms is facilitated when risk factors are present.<ref name=EBMED05/> [[Alcoholism]] is associated with ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', [[anaerobic organism]]s and ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''; smoking facilitates the effects of ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Moraxella catarrhalis'', and ''Legionella pneumophila''. Exposure to birds is associated with ''[[Chlamydia psittaci]]''; farm animals with ''[[Coxiella burnetti]]''; aspiration of stomach contents with [[anaerobic organism]]s; and [[cystic fibrosis]] with ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''Staphylococcus aureus''.<ref name=EBMED05/>''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' is more common in the winter,<ref name=EBMED05/> and should be suspected in persons who aspirate a large amount [[anaerobic organisms]].<ref name=Clinic2011/>

=== Viruses ===
{{Main|Viral pneumonia}}
In adults, [[virus]]es account for approximately a third<ref name=Lancet11/> and in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases.<ref name=M31/> Commonly implicated agents include: [[rhinovirus]]es, [[coronavirus]]es, [[influenza virus]], [[respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV), [[adenovirus]], and [[parainfluenza]].<ref name=Lancet11/><ref name=Viral09/> [[Herpes simplex virus]] rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people who have significant burns.<ref name=Text2010>{{cite book|last=Behera|first=D.|title=Textbook of pulmonary medicine|year=2010|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Medical Pub.|location=New Delhi|isbn=8184487495|pages=391–394|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=0TbJjd9eTp0C&pg=PA391|edition=2nd }}</ref> People following [[organ transplantation]] or those who are otherwise [[immunocompromised]] present high rates of [[cytomegalovirus]] pneumonia.<ref name=M31/><ref name=Text2010/> Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''Staphylococcus aureus'', or ''Haemophilus influenzae'', particularly when other health problems are present.<ref name=Clinic2011/><ref name=M31/> Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year, for example during influenza season influenza may account for over half of all viral cases.<ref name=M31/> Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including ''[[hantaviruses]]'' and ''[[coronavirus]]''.<ref name=M31/>

=== Fungi ===
{{Main|Fungal pneumonia}}

Fungal pneumonia is uncommon, but occur more commonly in individuals with [[Immunodeficiency|weakened immune systems]] due to [[AIDS]], [[immunosuppressive drug]]s, or other medical problems.<ref name=EBMED05/><ref name=Fungus2009>{{cite book|last=Maskell|first=Nick|title=Oxford desk reference.|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199239122|pages=196|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=MfEUkzQQ1BEC&pg=PA196|coauthors=Millar, Ann}}</ref> It is most often caused by ''[[Histoplasmosis|Histoplasma capsulatum]]'', blastomyces, ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', ''[[Pneumocystis jiroveci]]'', and ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]''. [[Histoplasmosis]] is most common in the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi River basin]], and [[coccidioidomycosis]] is most common in the [[Southwestern United States]].<ref name=EBMED05/> The number of cases have been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.<ref name=Fungus2009/>

=== Parasites ===
{{Main|Parasitic pneumonia}}
A variety of [[parasite]]s can affect the lungs, including: ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', ''[[Strongyloides stercoralis]]'', ''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'', and ''[[Plasmodium malariae]]''.<ref name=M37>Murray and Nadel (2010). Chapter 37.</ref> These organisms typically enter the body through direct contact with the skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector.<ref name=M37/> Except for ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'', most parasites do not specifically affect the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites.<ref name=M37/> Some parasites, particularly those belonging to the ''Ascaris'' and ''Strongyloides'' genera, stimulate a strong [[eosinophilic]] reaction, which may result in [[eosinophilic pneumonia]].<ref name=M37/> In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is primarily due to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation.<ref name=M37/> In the [[developed world]] these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants.<ref name=M37/> Globally these infections are most common in those who are immunodeficient.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vijayan|first=VK|title=Parasitic lung infections|journal=Current opinion in pulmonary medicine|date=2009 May|volume=15|issue=3|pages=274–82|pmid=19276810|doi=10.1097/MCP.0b013e328326f3f8}}</ref>

=== Viral ===
Viruses may reach the lung by a number of different routes.

=== Microbiology ===
In patients managed in the community, determining the causative agent is not cost effective and typically does not alter management.<ref name=Develop11/> For people who do not respond to treatment, [[sputum culture]] should be considered, and culture for ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' should be carried out in persons with a chronic productive cough.<ref name=BTS09/> Testing for other specific organisms may be recommended during outbreaks, for public health reasons.<ref name=BTS09/> In those who are hospitalized for severe disease, both sputum and [[blood cultures]] are recommended,<ref name=BTS09/> as well as testing the urine for [[antigen]]s to ''Legionella'' and ''Streptococcus''.<ref name=IDSA2007/> Viral infections can be confirmed via detection of either the virus or its antigens with [[culture]] or [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), among other techniques.<ref name=Lancet11/> The causative agent is determined in only 15% of cases with routine microbiological tests.<ref name=BMJ06/>

=== Classification ===
{{Main|Classification of pneumonia}}
[[Pneumonitis]] refers to lung [[inflammation]]; pneumonia refers to pneumonitis, usually due to infection but sometimes non-infectious, that has the additional feature of [[pulmonary consolidation]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stedman's medical dictionary.|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6450-6|edition=28th}}</ref> Pneumonia is most commonly classified by where or how it was acquired: [[community acquired pneumonia|community-acquired]], [[aspiration pneumonia|aspiration]], [[healthcare-associated pneumonia|healthcare-associated]], [[hospital-acquired pneumonia|hospital-acquired]], and [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]].<ref name=Rad07>{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=S|coauthors=Maycher, B; Eschun, G|title=Radiological imaging in pneumonia: recent innovations|journal=Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine|date=May 2007 |volume=13|issue=3|pages=159–69|pmid=17414122|doi=10.1097/MCP.0b013e3280f3bff4}}</ref> It may also be classified by the area of lung affected: [[lobar pneumonia]], [[bronchial pneumonia]] and [[acute interstitial pneumonia]];<ref name=Rad07/> or by the causative organism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=L|title=Pneumonia: classification, diagnosis and nursing management|journal=Nursing standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain) : 1987)|date=2005 June 29-July 5|volume=19|issue=42|pages=50–4|pmid=16013205}}</ref> Pneumonia in children may additionally be classified based on signs and symptoms as non-severe, severe, or very severe.<ref>{{cite book|last=organization|first=World health|title=Pocket book of hospital care for children : guidelines for the management of common illnesses with limited resources.|year=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-154670-6|page=72|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xbkbRG5XYxsC&pg=PA72}}</ref>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[asthma]], [[pulmonary edema]], [[bronchiectasis]], [[lung cancer]], and [[pulmonary emboli]].<ref name=BMJ06/> Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with [[wheezing]], pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal [[electrocardiogram]], cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli presents with acute onset sharp chest pain and [[shortness of breath]].<ref name=BMJ06/>

== Prevention ==
Prevention includes [[vaccination]], environmental measures and appropriate treatment of other health problems.<ref name=Develop11/> It is believed that if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000 and if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.<ref name=WHOPrevent2012/>

Vaccinations against ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' have good evidence to support their use.<ref name=PedNA09/> Vaccinating children against ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' has led to a decreased incidence of these infections in adults, because many adults acquire infections from children.

=== Other ===
[[Smoking cessation]]<ref name=BTS09/> and reducing indoor [[air pollution]], such as that from cooking indoors with wood or [[feces|dung]], are both recommended.<ref name=Develop11/><ref name=WHOPrevent2012/> Smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwise healthy adults.<ref name=IDSA2007/> Hand hygiene and coughing into ones sleeve may also be effective preventative measures.<ref name=CDCPrev2012/> Wearing [[surgical masks]] by those who are sick may also prevent illness.<ref name=IDSA2007/>

In pneumonia, a [[pleural effusion|collection of fluid]] may form in the [[pleural cavity|space that surrounds the lung]].<ref name=Yu2011>{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=H|title=Management of pleural effusion, empyema, and lung abscess|journal=Seminars in interventional radiology|date=2011 Mar|volume=28|issue=1|pages=75–86|pmid=22379278|doi=10.1055/s-0031-1273942|pmc=3140254}}</ref> Occasionally, microorganisms will infect this fluid, causing an [[pleural empyema|empyema]].<ref name=Yu2011/> To distinguish an empyema from the more common simple [[parapneumonic effusion]], the fluid may be collected with a needle ([[thoracentesis]]), and examined.<ref name=Yu2011/> If this shows evidence of empyema, complete drainage of the fluid is necessary, often requiring a [[chest tube|drainage catheter]].<ref name=Yu2011/> In severe cases of empyema, [[Decortication|surgery]] may be needed.<ref name=Yu2011/> If the infected fluid is not drained, the infection may persist, because antibiotics do not penetrate well into the pleural cavity. If the fluid is sterile, it needs to be drained only if it is causing symptoms or remains unresolved.<ref name=Yu2011/>

Rarely, bacteria in the lung will form a pocket of infected fluid called a [[lung abscess]].<ref name=Yu2011/> Lung abscesses can usually be seen with a chest X-ray but frequently require a chest CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.<ref name=Yu2011/> Abscesses typically occur in [[aspiration pneumonia]], and often contain several types of bacteria. Long term antibiotics are usually adequate to treat a lung abscess, but sometimes the abscess must be drained by a [[surgery|surgeon]] or [[Interventional radiology|radiologist]].<ref name=Yu2011/>

=== Respiratory and circulatory failure ===
Pneumonia can cause respiratory failure by triggering [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), which results from a combination of infection and inflammatory response.<!-- <ref name=M31/> --> The lungs quickly fill with fluid and become stiff.<!-- <ref name=M31/> --> This stiffness, combined with severe difficulties extracting oxygen due to the alveolar fluid, may require long periods of [[mechanical ventilation]] for survival.<ref name=M31/>

[[Sepsis]] is a potential complication of pneumonia but occurs typically only in people with poor immunity or [[hyposplenism]].<!-- <ref name=C250/> --> The organisms most commonly involved are ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'' and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''.<!-- <ref name=C250/> --> Other causes of the symptoms should be considered such as a [[myocardial infarction]] or a [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref name=C250>Cunha (2010).

Pneumonia has been a common disease throughout human history.<ref name=History03>{{cite book |last=Feigin |first=Ralph |title=Textbook of Pediatric Infectious Diseases |year=2004 |publisher=[[W. B. Saunders]] |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7216-9329-3 |page=299 |edition=5th |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G6k0tpPMRsIC&pg=PA299}}</ref> The symptoms were described by [[Hippocrates]] (c. 460 BC – 370 BC):<ref name=History03/> "Peripneumonia, and pleuritic affections, are to be thus observed: If the fever be acute, and if there be pains on either side, or in both, and if expiration be if cough be present, and the sputa expectorated be of a blond or livid color, or likewise thin, frothy, and florid, or having any other character different from the common...

He also reported the results of surgical drainage of empyemas. [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204 AD) observed: "The basic symptoms that occur in pneumonia and that are never lacking are as follows: acute fever, sticking [[pleuritic]] pain in the side, short rapid breaths, serrated [[pulse]] and cough."<ref name=maimo>Maimonides, ''Fusul Musa'' ("''Pirkei Moshe''").</ref> This clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks, and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the [[Middle Ages]] into the 19th century.

[[Edwin Klebs]] was the first who observed bacteria in the airways of persons who died of pneumonia in 1875.<ref name=klebs>{{cite journal |author=Klebs E |title=''Beiträge zur Kenntniss der pathogenen Schistomyceten''.

Friedländer's initial work introduced the [[Gram staining|Gram stain]], a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria. [[Christian Gram]]'s paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to differentiate the two bacteria, and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one microorganism.<ref name=gram>{{cite journal |author=Gram C |title=''Über die isolierte Färbung der Schizomyceten in Schnitt- und Trocken-präparaten'' |journal=Fortschr.

Sir [[William Osler]], known as "the father of modern medicine," appreciated the death and disability caused by pneumonia, describing it as the "captain of the men of death" in 1918, as it had overtaken [[tuberculosis]] as one of the leading causes of death in this time. This phrase was originally coined by [[John Bunyan]] in reference to "consumption" (tuberculosis).<ref>{{cite book|last=edited by J.F.

Several developments in the 1900s improved the outcome for those with pneumonia. With the advent of [[penicillin]] and other antibiotics, modern surgical techniques, and intensive care in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, mortality from pneumonia, had approached 30%, dropped precipitously in the developed world. Vaccination of infants against ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' type B began in 1988 and led to a dramatic decline in cases shortly thereafter.<ref name=adams>{{cite journal |author=Adams WG | coauthors = Deaver, KA; Cochi, SL; ''et al.'' |title=Decline of childhood Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) disease in the Hib vaccine era |journal=JAMA |volume=269 |issue=2 |pages=221–6 |year=1993 |month=January |pmid=8417239 |doi=10.1001/jama.269.2.221}}</ref> Vaccination against ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' in adults began in 1977, and in children in 2000, resulting in a similar decline.<ref name=whit>{{cite journal |author=Whitney CG | coauthors = Farley, MM; Hadler, J; ''et al.'' |title=Decline in invasive pneumococcal disease after the introduction of protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine |journal=N.
