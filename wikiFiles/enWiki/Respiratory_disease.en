'''Respiratory disease''' is a medical term that encompasses [[pathology|pathological]] conditions affecting the organs and tissues that make gas exchange possible in higher organisms, and includes conditions of the [[upper respiratory tract]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[bronchi]], [[bronchioles]], [[alveoli]], [[pleura]] and [[pleural cavity]], and the nerves and muscles of [[breathing]]. Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting, such as the [[common cold]], to life-threatening entities like [[bacterial pneumonia]], [[pulmonary embolism]], and [[lung cancer]].

The study of respiratory disease is known as [[pulmonology]]. A doctor who specializes in respiratory disease is known as a pulmonologist, a chest medicine specialist, a respiratory medicine specialist, a respirologist or a thoracic medicine specialist.

==Classification==
Respiratory diseases can be classified in many different ways, including by the organ or tissue involved, by the type and pattern of associated signs and symptoms, or by the cause ([[etiology]]) of the disease.

===Inflammatory lung disease===
Characterised by a high neutrophil count, e.g. asthma, cystic fibrosis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or acute respiratory distress syndrome.<ref>http://www.irishscientist.ie/2004/contents.asp?contentxml=04p104.xml&contentxsl=is04pages.xsl</ref>

===Obstructive lung diseases===
[[Obstructive lung disease]]s are diseases of the lung where the airways (i.e. [[bronchi]], [[bronchioles]], [[alveoli]]) become reduced in volume or have free flow of gas impeded, making it more difficult to move air in and out of the [[lung]].

====Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)====
[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), which includes emphysema an example of an obstructive lung disease, is where the alveolae rupture causing air to be retained in the lungs and limit the available space during inhalation.

[[Asthma]] is an example of an obstructive lung disease, (and of an inflammatory lung disease). It is a disease in which muscles of bronchi contract, making it difficult for air to reach the lungs. One treatment of asthma is to use an inhaler which contains a drug to relax muscles of bronchi. Asthma is a difficulty in breathing causing wheezing due to inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles, this causes a restriction in the airflow into the alveoli.

Asthma attacks can be brought on by triggers, such as air pollution, tobacco smoke, factory fumes, cleaning solvents, infections, pollens, foods, cold air, exercise, chemicals and medications. Triggers are highly individual and may not be related to allergens. Many asthmatics are not allergic to common allergens such as mold, ragweed, dust or pollens. It can also be caused by dust.

===Restrictive lung diseases===
[[Restrictive lung disease]]s (also known as [[interstitial lung disease]]s) are a category of respiratory disease characterized by a loss of [[Pulmonary compliance|lung compliance]],<ref name="emedicineRLD">{{cite web |url= http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic2012.htm|title= Restrictive Lung Disease|accessdate=2008-04-19 |author= Sharma, Sat|date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref> causing incomplete lung expansion and increased lung stiffness, such as in infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

===Respiratory tract infections===
Infections can affect any part of the respiratory system. They are traditionally divided into upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.

====Upper respiratory tract infection====
The most common [[upper respiratory tract infection]] is the [[common cold]] however, infections of specific organs of the upper respiratory tract such as [[sinusitis]], [[tonsillitis]], [[otitis media]], [[pharyngitis]] and [[laryngitis]] are also considered upper respiratory tract infections.

====Lower respiratory tract infection====
The most common lower respiratory tract infection is [[pneumonia]], an infection of the lungs which is usually caused by bacteria, particularly ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' in Western countries. Worldwide, [[tuberculosis]] is an important cause of pneumonia. Other pathogens such as viruses and fungi can cause pneumonia for example [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] and [[pneumocystis pneumonia]]. A pneumonia may develop complications such as a lung abscess, a round cavity in the lung caused by the infection, or may spread to the [[pleural cavity]].

====Malignant tumors====
Malignant tumors of the respiratory system, particularly [[lung cancer|primary carcinomas of the lung]], are a major health problem responsible for 15% of all cancer diagnoses and 29% of all cancer deaths.<ref name = "LungCa">{{cite web |url= http://www.lungcancer.org/reading/about.php|title= LungCancer.org|accessdate=2008-05-07 |format= |work= }}</ref> The majority of respiratory system cancers are attributable to smoking [[tobacco]].

The major [[histology|histological]] types of respiratory system cancer are:
* [[Small cell lung cancer]]
* [[Non-small cell lung cancer]]
** Adenocarcinoma of the lung
**Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
** Large cell lung carcinoma
* Other lung cancers ([[carcinoid]], [[Kaposi’s sarcoma]], [[melanoma]])
* [[Lymphoma]]
* [[Head and neck cancer]]
* [[Pleural |Pleural Mesothelioma]], almost always caused by exposure to [[asbestos]] dust.<ref>http://www.mesotheliomahelpnow.com/what-is-mesothelioma</ref>

In addition, since many cancers spread via the bloodstream and the entire cardiac output passes through the lungs, it is common for cancer [[metastases]] to occur within the lung. [[Breast cancer]] may invade directly through local spread, and through lymph node metastases. After metastasis to the [[liver cancer|liver]], [[colon cancer]] frequently metastasizes to the lung. [[Prostate cancer]], germ cell cancer and [[renal cell carcinoma]] may also metastasize to the lung.

Treatment of respiratory system cancer depends on the type of cancer. Surgical removal of part of a lung ([[lobectomy]], [[segmentectomy]], or [[wedge resection]]) or of an entire lung [[pneumonectomy]]), along with chemotherapy and [[radiotherapy]], are all used. The chance of surviving lung cancer depends on the cancer stage at the time the cancer is diagnosed, and to some extent on the [[histology]], and is only about 14-17% overall.<ref name = "Canadalung">{{cite web |url= http://lung.ca/diseases-maladies/cancer-cancer/treatment-traitement/index_e.php|title= Canadian Lung Association – Lung Cancer|accessdate=2008-05-07 |format= |work= }}</ref> In the case of metastases to the lung, treatment can occasionally be curative but only in certain, rare circumstances.

====Benign tumors====
Benign tumors are relatively rare causes of respiratory disease. Examples of benign tumors are: 
* Pulmonary [[hamartoma]]
* Congenital malformations such as [[pulmonary sequestration]] and [[congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation]] (CCAM).

===Pleural cavity diseases===
Pleural cavity diseases include [[pleural |pleural mesothelioma]] which are mentioned above.

A collection of fluid in the pleural cavity is known as a [[pleural effusion]]. This may be due to fluid shifting from the bloodstream into the pleural cavity due to conditions such as congestive heart failure and cirrhosis. It may also be due to inflammation of the pleura itself as can occur with infection, [[pulmonary embolus]], tuberculosis, mesothelioma and other conditions.

A [[pneumothorax]] is a hole in the pleura covering the lung allowing air in the lung to escape into the pleural cavity. The affected lung “collapses” like a deflated balloon. A [[tension pneumothorax]] is a particularly severe form of this condition where the air in the pleural cavity cannot escape, so the pneumothorax keeps getting bigger until it compresses the heart and blood vessels, leading to a life threatening situation.

===Pulmonary vascular diseases===
Pulmonary vascular diseases are conditions that affect the [[pulmonary circulation]]. Examples are:{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source.|date=September 2008}}

* [[Pulmonary embolism]], a [[Thrombosis|blood clot]] that forms in a vein, breaks free, travels through the heart and lodges in the lungs (thromboembolism). Large pulmonary emboli are fatal, causing sudden death. A number of other substances can also embolise (travel through the blood stream) to the lungs but they are much more rare: [[fat embolism]] (particularly after bony injury), amniotic fluid embolism (with complications of labour and delivery), [[air embolism]] (iatrogenic - caused by invasive medical procedures).
* [[Pulmonary arterial hypertension]], elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Most commonly it is [[idiopathic]] (i.e. of unknown cause) but it can be due to the effects of another disease, particularly COPD. This can lead to strain on the right side of the heart, a condition known as [[cor pulmonale]].
* [[Pulmonary edema]], leakage of fluid from capillaries of the lung into the [[alveoli]] (or air spaces). It is usually due to congestive heart failure.
* Pulmonary hemorrhage, inflammation and damage to capillaries in the lung resulting in blood leaking into the alveoli. This may cause blood to be coughed up. Pulmonary hemorrhage can be due to auto-immune disorders such as [[Wegener's Granulomatosis]] and [[Goodpasture's syndrome]].

===Neonatal diseases===

Pulmonary diseases may also impact newborns, such as [[pulmonary hyperplasia]].

==Diagnosis==
Respiratory diseases may be investigated by performing one or more of the following tests
* [[Chest x-ray]]
* [[Pulmonary function test]]
* [[Computed tomography scan]]
* [[Microbiological culture|Culture of microorganisms]] from secretions such as sputum
* [[Bronchoscopy]]
* [[Biopsy]] of the lung or pleura
* [[Ventilation/perfusion scan|Ventilation - perfusion scan]]
* [[blood investigation]]
* [[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] scanning can be useful to detect fluid such as [[pleural effusion]]

==Epidemiology==
Respiratory disease is a common and important cause of illness and death around the world. In the US, approximately 1 billion "common colds" occur each year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/commonCold/ | title=National Institutes of Health – common cold | accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref> In the UK, approximately 1 in 7 individuals are affected by some form of chronic lung disease, most commonly [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], which includes [[asthma]], [[chronic bronchitis]] and [[emphysema]].<ref name="BLF">{{cite web |url=http://www.lunguk.org/media-and-campaigning/media-centre/lung-stats-and-facts/factsaboutrespiratorydisease.htm | title=British Lung Foundation - Facts about ukinnam respiratory disease | accessdate=2008-04-19 }}</ref> Respiratory diseases (including lung cancer) are responsible for over 10% of hospitalizations and over 16% of deaths in Canada.<ref name="PHAC">{{cite web |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ccdpc-cpcmc/crd-mrc/facts_gen_e.html|title= Public Health Agency of Canada - Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control Chronic Respiratory Diseases | accessdate=2008-05-06 }}</ref>
