though it is still commonly used to treat [[neonatal]] seizures.

Phenobarbital (and phenobarbital sodium) is manufactured and supplied in various forms: in tablets of 15, 30, 60 and 100&nbsp;mg (though not all are available in all countries: for example, in Australia only the 30-mg tablets are available); in an oral elixir (commonly 3&nbsp;mg/ml in strength); and in a form for injection (as phenobarbital sodium - usually 200&nbsp;mg/ml). The injectable form is used principally to control [[status epilepticus]], while the oral forms are used for prophylactic and maintenance therapy. The dose range for epilepsy is 60–320&nbsp;mg/day; its very long active [[half-life]] means for some patients, doses do not have to be taken every day, particularly once the dose has been stabilised over a period of several weeks or months, and seizures are effectively controlled. It is occasionally still used as a [[sedative]]/[[hypnotic]] in anxious or agitated patients who may be intolerant of or do not have access to [[benzodiazepines]], [[neuroleptics]] and other, newer drugs. For this purpose, phenobarbital has a lower dose range - around 30–120&nbsp;mg/day, but this practice is uncommon in developed countries.<ref name="BNFc4.8.1">{{cite book

==History==
The first barbiturate drug, [[barbital]], was synthesized in 1902 by German chemists [[Franz Joseph Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and [[Joseph von Mering]] and was first marketed as '''Veronal''' by [[Bayer|Friedr. Bayer et comp]]. By 1904, several related drugs, including phenobarbital, had been synthesized by Fischer. Phenobarbital was brought to market in 1912 by the drug company Bayer as the brand '''Luminal'''. It remained a commonly prescribed sedative and hypnotic until the introduction of [[benzodiazepine]]s in the 1960s.<ref name="Sneader2005">{{cite book

Phenobarbital's soporific, sedative and hypnotic properties were well known in 1912, but nobody knew it was also an effective anticonvulsant. The young doctor [[Alfred Hauptmann]]<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2764.html
| title = Alfred Hauptmann
| accessdate= 2006-09-06
| author = Ole Daniel Enersen }}</ref> gave it to his epilepsy patients as a tranquilizer and discovered their seizures were susceptible to the drug. Hauptmann performed a careful study of his patients over an extended period. Most of these patients were using the only effective drug then available, [[potassium bromide|bromide]], which had terrible side effects and limited efficacy. On phenobarbital, their epilepsy was much improved: The worst patients suffered fewer and lighter seizures and some patients became seizure-free. In addition, they improved physically and mentally as bromides were removed from their regimen. Patients who had been institutionalised due to the severity of their epilepsy were able to leave and, in some cases, resume employment. Hauptman dismissed concerns that its effectiveness in stalling seizures could lead to patients suffering a build-up that needed to be "discharged". As he expected, withdrawal of the drug led to an increase in seizure frequency – it was not a cure. The drug was quickly adopted as the first widely effective anticonvulsant, though [[World War I]] delayed its introduction in the U.S.<ref name="Scott1993">{{cite book

Phenobarbital is sometimes indicated for alcohol and benzodiazepine detoxification for its sedative and anticonvulsant properties. The benzodiazepines [[chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium) and [[oxazepam]] (Serax) have largely replaced phenobarbital for detoxification.<ref>http://www.aafp.org/afp/980700ap/miller.html</ref>

==Other uses==
Phenobarbital properties can effectively reduce tremors and seizures associated with abrupt withdrawal from benzodiazepines.
Phenobarbital is a [[cytochrome P450]] inducer, and is used to reduce the toxicity of some drugs.

Phenobarbital is occasionally prescribed in low doses to aid in the conjugation of [[bilirubin]] in patients suffering from [[Crigler-Najjar syndrome]] (Type II).

Phenobarbital can also be used to relieve [[Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome]] symptoms.

In infants suspected of neonatal biliary atresia, phenobarbital is used in preparation for a <sup>99m</sup>Tc-IDA hepatobiliary study that differentiates atresia from hepatitis or chondrostasis.

==Side effects==
Sedation and hypnosis are the principal side effects (occasionally, they are also the intended effects) of phenobarbital. [[Central nervous system]] effects, such as dizziness, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] and [[ataxia]], are also common. In elderly patients, it may cause excitement  and confusion, while in children, it may result in [[paradoxical reaction|paradoxical hyperactivity]]. Another very rare side effect is [[amelogenesis imperfecta]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Special precautions==
Caution is to be used with children. Of anticonvulsant drugs, behavioural disturbances occur most frequently with [[clonazepam]] and phenobarbital.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Epilepsia | year = 1988| volume = 29 Suppl 3| pages = S15–9| title = Children of school age: the influence of antiepileptic drugs on behavior and intellect| author = Trimble MR| coauthors = Cull C| pmid = 3066616| doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1988.tb05805.x}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
[[Acute intermittent porphyria]], oversensitivity for barbiturates, prior dependence on barbiturates, severe respiratory insufficiency and [[hyperkinesia]] in children are contraindications for phenobarbital use.

==Mechanism of action==
GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are the primary target for barbiturates in the central nervous system. As is the case for other clinically important barbiturates, phenobarbital prolongs and potentiates the action of [[GABA]] on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and at higher concentrations directly activates the receptors.<ref name="Rho">{{Cite pmid|  8961191}}</ref> In contrast to anesthetic barbitruates such as pentobarbital, phenobarbital is minimally sedating at effective anticonvulsant doses. Possible explanations for the reduced sedative effect of phenobarbital include more regionally restricted action; partial agonist activity; reduced propensity to directly activate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors  (possibly including extrasynaptic receptors containing δ subunits); and reduced activity at other ion channel targets, including voltage-gated [[calcium channels]]. Although the precise sites where barbiturates interact with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors has not been defined, the second and third transmembrane domains of the β subunit appear to be critical; binding may involve a pocket formed by β-subunit methionine 286 as well as α-subunit methionine 236. In addition to effects on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, barbiturates block [[AMPA receptors]], and they inhibit glutamate release through an effect on P/Q-type high-voltage activated calcium channels. The combination of these various actions likely accounts for their diverse clinical activities.<ref name="Loescher&Rogawski">{{Cite pmid| 23205959}}</ref>

Phenobarbital causes a "depression" of the body's systems, mainly the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s; thus, the main characteristic of phenobarbital overdose is a "slowing" of bodily functions, including decreased [[consciousness]] (even [[coma]]), [[bradycardia]], [[bradypnea]], [[hypothermia]], and [[hypotension]] (in massive overdoses). Overdose may also lead to [[pulmonary edema]] and [[acute renal failure]] as a result of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and can result in death.

The [[electroencephalogram]] of a person with phenobarbital overdose may show a marked decrease in electrical activity, to the point of mimicking [[brain death]]. This is due to profound depression of the central nervous system, and is usually reversible.<ref name="Habal">{{cite web

Treatment of phenobarbital overdose is supportive, and consists mainly in the maintenance of [[airway]] patency (through [[endotracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]]), correction of bradycardia and hypotension (with [[intravenous therapy|intravenous fluid]]s and [[vasopressor]]s, if necessary) and removal of as much drug as possible from the body. Depending on how much time has elapsed since ingestion of the drug, this may be accomplished through [[gastric lavage]] (stomach pumping) or use of [[activated charcoal]]. [[Hemodialysis]] is effective in removing phenobarbital from the body, and may reduce its half-life by up to 90%.<ref name="Habal"/> No specific antidote for barbiturate poisoning is available.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000951.htm |title= Barbiturate intoxication and overdose |accessdate= 15 July 2008 | publisher = MedLine Plus }}</ref>

British veterinarian [[Donald Sinclair (veterinarian)|Donald Sinclair]], better known as "Siegfried Farnon" in the "All Creatures Great and Small" books of [[James Herriot]] committed suicide at the age of 84 by injecting himself with an overdose of phenobarbital.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Phenobarbital has an oral [[bioavailability]] of about 90%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached eight to 12 hours after oral administration. It is one of the longest-acting barbiturates available &ndash; it remains in the body for a very long time (half-life of two to seven days) and has very low [[Plasma protein binding|protein binding]] (20 to 45%). Phenobarbital is metabolized by the liver, mainly through [[hydroxylation]] and [[glucuronidation]], and induces many [[isozyme]]s of the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450 system]]. Cytochrome P450 2B6 ([[CYP2B6]]) is specifically induced by phenobarbital via the [[Coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor|CAR]]/[[Retinoid X receptor|RXR]] [[nuclear receptor]] [[heterodimer]]. It is excreted primarily by the [[kidney]]s.

==Veterinary uses==
Phenobarbital is one of the initial drugs of choice to treat [[Epilepsy in animals|epilepsy]] in [[dog]]s, and is the initial drug of choice to treat epilepsy in cats.<ref name = Dewey>

There is no major difference between them.

The first method consists of ethanolysis of [[benzyl cyanide]] in the presence of acid, giving [[phenylacetic acid]] ethyl ester, the methylene group of which undergoes acylation using diethyloxalate, giving diethyl ester of phenyloxobutandioic acid, which upon heating easily loses [[carbon oxide]] and turns into phenylmalonic ester. Alkylation of the obtained product using
[[ethyl bromide]] in the presence of [[sodium ethoxide]] leads to the formation of α-phenyl-α-
ethylmalonic ester, the condensation of which with [[urea]] gives phenobarbital.
[[File:Phenobarbital synthesis.png|600px|center]]
Another method of phenobarbital synthesis starts with condensation of benzyl cyanide with
[[diethylcarbonate]] in the presence of [[sodium ethoxide]] to give α-phenylcyanoacetic ester. Alkylation of the ester using ethyl bromide gives α-phenyl-α-ethylcyanoacetic ester, which is further converted into the 4-iminoderivative upon treatment with urea. Acidic hydrolysis of the resulting product gives phenobarbital.
