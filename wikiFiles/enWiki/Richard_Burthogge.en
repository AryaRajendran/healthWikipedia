'''Richard Burthogge''' [sometimes spelled Borthoge, Burthog, Burthoggius] (1637/38–1705) was an [[English people|English]] [[physician]], [[magistrate]] and [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Richard Burthogge, son of a captain of foot at the garrison of [[Plymouth]], was baptised in Plympton St Maurice on 30 January 1637 (OS; 1638 by the Gregorian calendar). He attended [[Exeter]] grammar school,<ref name = CDNB>''Concise Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> was admitted to [[All Souls College, Oxford]], as a servitor in 1654, migrated to [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], and graduated B.A. “completed by determination” in 1658.<ref>	Anthony à Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, Vol. IV, p. 581</ref> He matriculated at the [[University of Leiden]] in October 1661. His doctoral thesis was entitled “''De lithiasi et calculo''” and submitted on 27 February 1662. 

Back in England, Burthogge practiced medicine in and near [[Totnes]]. He spent many years at Bowden House, which belonged to his sister’s husband Edward Giles. Unprejudiced even against Catholics and probably himself a [[Non-Conformist]], he was made a justice of the peace under [[James II]], a position he kept also under [[William III]].

Burthogge was married at least three times. His first wife Sarah<ref name="The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928">The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928</ref> was the daughter of Andrew Trevill, to whom he dedicated ''The Divine Goodness'' in 1670 and his ''Organum Vetus et Novum'' in 1678. In the following years, then already married to Mary Deeble,<ref name="The Totnes Times, 31 March 1928"/> Burthogge published several other works on religious subjects and two further philosophical works, both dedicated to [[John Locke]]: ''An Essay upon Reason, and the Nature of Spirits'' (1694) and ''Of the Soul of the World; and of Particular Souls'' (1699). Mary probably died in 1695. His daughters Sarah, Mary and Ann will have issued from these first two marriages. Ann, who died before her father, left a young son, Richard Babbage, ancestor of [[Charles Babbage]]. At the time of his death, Burthogge was married to Honour and seems to have lived in Bowden. He was buried at St. Mary’s church, Totnes, on 24 July 1705.<ref>Dictionary of National Biography</ref>

==Views==
In his philosophical and theological writings he was a critic in some matters of [[John Locke]], but generally a supporter, and an advocate of [[religious toleration]]. His [[epistemology]] was [[empiricist]], and he opposed [[innate idea]]s. His [[metaphysics]] was distinctive, but not completely worked out.<ref name = Pyle>[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] (editor), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth-Century British Philosophers'' (2000), article ''Burthogge, Richard'', pp. 147-150.</ref>
