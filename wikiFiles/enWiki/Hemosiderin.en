'''Hemosiderin''' or '''haemosiderin''' is an [[iron]]-storage complex. It is always found within cells (as opposed to circulating in blood) and appears to be a complex of [[ferritin]], denatured ferritin and other material. The iron within deposits of hemosiderin is very poorly available to supply iron when needed.

Several disease processes result in deposition of larger amounts of hemosiderin in tissues; although these deposits often cause no symptoms, they can lead to [[lesions|organ damage]].

Hemosiderin is most commonly found in [[macrophage]]s and is especially abundant in situations following [[hemorrhage]], suggesting that its formation may be related to [[phagocytosis]] of [[red blood cells]] and [[hemoglobin]]. Hemosiderin can accumulate in different [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] in various [[disease]]s.

Iron is required by many of the [[chemical reaction]]s (i.e. oxidation-reduction reactions) in the body but is [[toxic]] when not properly contained. Thus, many methods of iron storage have developed.

==Pathophysiology==
Hemosiderin often forms after bleeding (hemorrhage).<ref name="urlForensic Pathology">{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/FORHTML/FOR138.html |title=Forensic Pathology |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> When blood leaves a ruptured blood vessel, the [[red blood cell]] dies, and the hemoglobin of the cell is released into the extracellular space. [[White blood cell]]s called macrophages engulf (phagocytose) the hemoglobin to degrade it, producing hemosiderin and [[biliverdin]].

==Diseases associated with hemosiderin deposition==
{{Main|Hemosiderosis}}

Hemosiderin may deposit in diseases associated with iron overload. These diseases are typically diseases in which chronic blood loss requires frequent [[blood transfusion]]s, such as [[sickle cell anemia]] and [[thalassemia]].
