'''Physician supply''' refers to the number of trained [[physician]]s working in a [[health care system]] or active in the [[labour market]].<ref name="Handbook">Dal Poz MR et al. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547703_eng.pdf ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health.''] Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009.</ref> The supply depends primarily on the number of graduates of [[medical school]]s in a country or jurisdiction, but also on the number who continue to practice [[medicine]] as a [[career]] path and who remain in their country of origin. The number of physicians needed in a given context depends on several different factors, including the [[demographics]] and [[epidemiology]] of the local population, the numbers and types of other [[health care provider#Practitioners and professionals|health care practitioners]] working in the system, as well as the [[health policy|policies]] and goals in place of the health care system.<ref name="Models">World Health Organization. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599016_eng.pdf ''Models and tools for health workforce planning and projections.''] Geneva, 2010.</ref> If more physicians are trained than needed, then supply exceeds demand; if too few physicians are trained and retained, then some people may have difficulty accessing [[health care]] services.  A '''physician shortage''' is a situation in which there are not enough [[physicians]] to treat all [[patient]]s in need of medical care. This can be observed at the level of a given [[health care provider|health care facility]], a province/state, a country, or worldwide.

Globally, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] worldwide,<ref name="WHR2006">World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 ''The world health report 2006: working together for health.''] Geneva, 2006.</ref> especially in many [[developing countries]]. Developing nations often have physician shortages due to limited numbers and capacity of medical schools and because of international migration: physicians can usually earn much more money and enjoy better working conditions in other countries.  Many developed countries also report doctor shortages, especially in rural and other underserved areas. For example, shortages are being discussed in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Cauchon | first = Dennis  | title = Medical miscalculation creates doctor shortage | publisher = USATODAY.com | date = 2005-03-02 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-03-02-doctor-shortage_x.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  | last = Ramirez | first = Marc  | title = Rural doctor shortage called "a crisis" in Washington | publisher = The Seattle Times | date = 2009-04-18 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2009078934_ruraldocs18m0.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  | last = Halsey III | first = Ashley  | title = Primary-Care Doctor Shortage May Undermine Reform Efforts | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 2009-06-20 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903583.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Feasby | first = Tom  | title = Medical schools are working hard to help cure the doctor shortage  | publisher = The Globe and Mail | date = 2009-03-30 | url = http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/medical-schools-are-working-hard-to-help-cure-the-doctor-shortage/article663115/ | accessdate = 2009-08-20 | location=Toronto}}</ref>

==Determinants==

===Economic Theory and Trends===
[[Image:Merlin Darfur.jpg|thumb|Patients queue to see a doctor in South Sudan (source: [[Merlin]])]]
Anything that changes the number of available physicians or the demand for their services affects the [[supply and demand]] balance. If the number of physicians is decreased, or the demand for their services increases, then an ''under''-supply or shortage can result. If the number of physicians increases, or demand for their services decreases, then an ''over''-supply can result.

Substitution factors can significantly affect the production of physician services and the availability of physicians to see more patients. For example, an [[accountant]] can replace some of the financial responsibilities for a physician who owns his or her own practice, allowing for more time to treat patients. Disposable supplies can substitute for labor and capital (the time and equipment needed to sterilize instruments). Sound record keeping by physicians can substitute for legal services by avoiding malpractice suits. However, the extent of substitution of physician production is limited by technical and legal factors. Technology cannot replace all skills possessed by physicians, such as surgical skill sets. Legal factors can include only allowing licensed physicians to perform surgeries, but nurses or doctors administering other surgical care.<ref>Charles Phelps, Health Economics (4th edition), (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 2010</ref>  

Demand of physicians is also dependent on a country's economic status. Especially in developing nations, health care spending is closely related to growth of their [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP). Theoretically, as GDP increases, the health care labor force expands and in turn, physician supply also increases.<ref>http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/1/140.full#R10</ref> However, developing countries face additional challenges in retaining competent physicians to higher-income countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]].<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa050004</ref> Emigration of physicians from lower-income and developing countries contribute to [[Brain drain]], creating issues on maintaining sufficient physician supply. However, higher-income countries can also experience an outflow of physicians who decide to return to their naturalized countries after receiving extensive education and training, without ever benefiting from their gained medical knowledge and skill set.

===Number of physicians trained===
Increasing the number of students enrolled in existing [[medical school]]s is one way to address physician shortage,<ref>{{cite web | last = Burk | first = Jennifer  | title = Medical Schools Look to Grow as Doctor Shortage Looms | publisher = Wisconsin Healthcare Workforce Development | date = 2007-05-14 | url = http://www.dwd.state.wi.us/healthcare/Archive2007/medical_schools_grow_dr_shortage_looms.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> or increasing the number of schools,<ref>{{cite news  | last = Beene  | first = Ryan  | title = Medical schools multiplying, but may not solve doctor shortage | pages =  | publisher = Bridging 96 | date = 2009-03-18 | url = http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20090318/BRIDGING96/903169989/1123 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref> but other factors may also play a role.

Becoming a physician requires several years of training beyond [[undergraduate education]]. Consequently, physician supply is affected by the number of students eligible for medical training. Students that do not finish earlier levels of education, including [[high school dropout]]s and those that leave university without an [[undergraduate degree]] or [[associates degree]], do not qualify for entrance to [[medical school]]. The more people that fail to complete the prerequisites, the fewer people that are eligible for training as physicians.<ref name="Handbook"/><ref>{{cite web | last = Murphy | first = Mike   | coauthors =Tim Anderson | title = Dropout rates draw attention | publisher = The Midwestern Office of The Council of State Governments | date = October 2008 | url = http://www.csgmidwest.org/memberservices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf| accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref>

In most countries, the number of placements for students in medical schools and [[Internship (medicine)|clinical internships]] is limited, typically according to the number of teachers and other resources, including the amount of funding provided by governments.<ref name="Handbook"/> In many countries that do not charge [[tuition payments]] to prospective physicians, public funding is the only significant limitation on the number of physicians trained. In the United States, the [[American Medical Association]] says that federal funding is the most important limitation in the supply of physicians. The high cost of tuition combined with the cost of supporting oneself during medical school discourages some people from enrolling to become a physician.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Lee | first = Frank  | title = Experts foresee doctor shortage | publisher = sctimes.com | date = 2009-07-26 | url = http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts-foresee-doctor-shortage | accessdate = }}</ref>   Limited [[scholarship]]s and financial aid to medical students may exacerbate this problem,<ref>{{cite news  | last = Rogers | first = Christina  | title = Doctor shortage worsens as student debt rises | publisher = AllBusiness.com | date = 2008-06-18 | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> while low expected pay for practicing physicians in some countries may convince some that the cost is not appropriate.<ref>{{cite web | last = Financiar | first = Ziarul  | title = Doctors can earn over Euro 20,000 per month in private clinics | publisher = Honorary Consulate of Romania | date = 2008-01-24 | url = http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/Businesspages/DoctorPrivate08.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref>  

It has been speculated that politics and social conditions can sometimes motivate medical student placements. For example, [[racial quota]]s have been cited in some places as preventing some people from enrolling in medical school.<ref>{{cite news  | title = Shortage of young (white) male doctors  | publisher = Sunday Star Times | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/179274 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref> [[Racial discrimination]] and [[gender discrimination]], either overt or disguised, have also been cited as resulting in people being denied the opportunity to train as a physician on the basis of their race or gender.<ref name="pmid18617633">{{cite journal

===Number of physicians working===
Once trained, the current supply of physicians can be affected by the number of those who continue to practice this profession. The number of working physicians can be affected by:

*The number of medical school graduates who choose to practice as a physician for their [[career]] - for example, some might choose instead to work in [[medical research]], [[public policy]] or other areas where medical expertise is required; or they may choose a job where no medical knowledge is required.<ref name="Handbook"/>
*The number of medical school graduates who fail to obtain (or fail to re-qualify for) their license or other [[healthcare provider requisites|professional requirements]] for legal practice.
*The number of medical school graduates who are unable to find work of their choice - for example, studies in Mexico have found high levels of unemployment among trained physicians in urban areas, even while large rural populations remain medically underserved.<ref name="Nigenda">Nigenda G et al. [http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/3/1/3 "Educational and labor wastage of doctors in Mexico: towards the construction of a common methodology."] ''Human Resources for Health'' 2005, 3:3.</ref> 
*The number of physicians who emigrate abroad for better economic and social conditions, also referred to as "[[Brain drain]]".
*Changes in the specialty balance - for example, in many countries, the balance is shifting away from medical students becoming [[general practitioners]] (GP) because of more attractive pay for [[medical specialist]]s,<ref>{{cite web | title = Another Hurdle to Health Care Reform: Too Few General Practice Doctors | publisher = Knowledge@Wharton | date = 2009-07-22 | url = http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2297 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref> leading to shortages of physicians for [[primary care]].
*Changes in the practice environment - for example, changing legal conditions have been cited in the US, Canada and elsewhere as inciting physician attrition, notably the adoption of laws that require doctors to refer for certain procedures (such as abortion or sex change) with which the doctors disagreed on moral or religious grounds.<ref>Lea Singh. [http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/new_look_inquisitions_could_be_calling_doctors_in_for_a_little_chat/ New-look Inquisitions want to call doctors in for a little chat.] Posted Wednesday, 1 October 2008.</ref>
*The number of physicians who retire.
*The number of physicians who work part-time - in particular, while the number working only part-time does not affect the overall number of physicians, it does affect the supply of physician services (e.g. in terms of [[full-time equivalent]]s). Many physicians may retain their professional license while working part-time or after retiring; consequently, the reported number of active physicians is probably overstated in many jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite news

===Demand for physician services===
The demand for physician services is influenced by the local job market (e.g. the number of [[Job (role)|job openings]] in local health care facilities), the demographics and epidemiology of the population being served, the nature of the [[health policy|health policies]] in place for health care delivery and financing in a jurisdiction, and also the international job market (e.g. increasing demand in other countries puts pressure on local competition).<ref name="Models"/>

For example, [[population ageing]] has been attributed with increased demand for physician services in many countries, as more previously young and healthy people become older with increased likelihood of a variety of [[non-communicable diseases|chronic medical conditions]] associated with ageing, such as [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], [[osteoporosis]], and some types of [[cancer]]s and [[neurodegenerative]] diseases.

====Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (U.S.)====
The implementation of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] will expand health insurance coverage and access to an estimated 32 million United States citizens  by 2014, increasing the demand of physicians, especially [[primary care physicians]], across the country.<ref>http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf</ref> Expanded coverage is predicted to increase the number of annual primary care visits between 15.07 million and 24.26 million by 2019. Assuming stable levels of physicians’ productivity, between 4,307 and 6,940 additional primary care physicians would be needed to accommodate this increase.<ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00620.x/full</ref>

The PPACA will also affect the supply of [[Medicaid]] physicians. Incentives and higher reimbursement rates would increase the number of physicians accepting Medicaid patients until 2014. With the expansion of Medicaid and a decrease in incentives and reimbursement rates in 2014, the supply of physicians in Medicaid may drop substantially, fluctuating the supply of Medicaid physicians. A study examining variation between states in 2005 showed that average time for Medicaid reimbursements was directly correlated with Medicaid participation, and physicians in states with faster reimbursement times had a higher probability of accepting new Medicaid patients.<ref>http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/1/w17.full.pdf+html</ref>

==Effects of physician shortage==
[[Image:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical shortages of physicians and other health care workers]]
Physician shortages have been linked to a number of effects, including:
*Lower quantity of medical care for [[patient]]s, thereby limiting the ability of health systems to meet [[primary health care]] goals, such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name="WHR2006"/>
*Lower quality of medical care for patients, due to shorter doctor visits.<ref>http://www.parents.com/family-life/fitness/mom-health/shrinking-doctors-appointment/ {{link dead}}</ref>
*Increased workload and too many patients per doctor resulting in overworked and sleep-deprived doctors, thereby compromising [[patient safety]].<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/shortage-pushes-doctors-to-limit/2007/04/19/1176697005237.html?page=fullpage ''Shortage pushes doctors to limit''.] Posted by Jill Stark, April 20, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070520130105.htm ''Approved Medical Resident Hours Still Resulting In Sleepy Doctors''.] Posted by ''ScienceDaily'' (May 21, 2007).</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1546317/Sleepy-doctors-admit-to-mistakes.html ''"Sleepy" doctors admit to mistakes''.] Posted by Celia Hall, ''The Telegraph'', 22 Mar 2007.</ref>

*Lower medical costs to consumers. Unlike other industries, as market share grows and competition declines, physicians are less inclined to gross up the frequency or intensity of medical services to maximize reimbursement per limited patient encounter.<ref>[http://mgma.com ''Offshoring Physician Labor''] Posted by Layton Lang, December 12, 2011.{{full|date=May 2012}}</ref>

==Proposed solutions==
A number of solutions, including short-term fixes and long-term solutions, have been proposed to address physician shortages. Some have been tested and applied in national [[Health Human Resources#Health workforce policy and planning|health workforce policies and plans]], while others remain subject to ongoing debate.

*Increase the number of medical graduates through increased recruitment of minority students domestically, as well as intensified recruitment of foreign-trained graduates (also known as [[International medical graduate|International Medical Graduates]] or IMGs).<ref name="pmid19416533">{{cite journal |author=Lakhan SE, Laird C |title=Addressing the primary care physician shortage in an evolving medical workforce |journal=International Archives of Medicine |volume=2 |issue=14 |year=2009 |pmid=19416533 |doi=10.1186/1755-7682-2-14}}</ref>
