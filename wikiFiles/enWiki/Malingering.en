In [[medicine]], '''malingering''' is fabricating or [[exaggerating]] the symptoms of [[mental disorder|mental]] or [[physical disorder|physical]] disorders for a variety of "[[secondary gain]]" motives, which may include financial compensation (often tied to [[fraud]]); avoiding school, work or military service; obtaining drugs; getting lighter criminal sentences; or simply to attract attention or sympathy.  Malingering is different from [[somatization disorder]] and [[factitious disorder]].<ref name=Rogers3>R. Rogers ''Clinical Assessment of Malingering and Deception'' 3rd Edition, Guilford, 2008.

==History==
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[King David|David]] [[Feigned madness|feigns insanity]] to escape from a king who views him as an enemy.<ref>I Sam 21:10-15</ref> [[Odysseus]] was stated to have also feigned insanity in order to avoid participating in the [[Trojan War]].<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html#95 Hyginus ''Fabulae'' 95]. Cf. Apollodorus [http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#3 Epitome 3.7].</ref> Malingering has been recorded historically as early as Roman times by the physician [[Galen]], who reported two cases. One patient simulated [[colic]] to avoid a public meeting, while the other feigned an injured knee to avoid accompanying his master on a long journey.<ref>"Galen on Malingering, Centaurs, Diabetes, and Other Subjects More or Less Related", Proceedings of the Charaka Club, X (1941), p52-55</ref>  In his social-climbing manual, Elizabethan [[George Puttenham]] recommends that would-be courtiers have "sickness in his sleeve, thereby to shake off other importunities of greater consequence" and suggests feigning a "dry [[dropsy]] [...] of some such other secret disease, as the common conversant can hardly discover, and the physician either not speedily heal, or not honestly bewray."<ref>"The Art of English Posey: a Critical Edition." George Puttenham. Ed. Frank Whigham & Wayne A. Rebhorn. (2007) 379-380.</ref>

Because malingering was widespread throughout the Soviet Union to escape sanctions or coercion, physicians were limited by the state in the number of medical dispensations they could issue.<ref name="structuredstrain">Structured Strain in the Role of the Soviet Physician, Mark G. Field, 1953 The American Journal of Sociology, v.58;5;493-502</ref><br>

This dependence upon doctors by poor labourers altered the [[doctor-patient relationship]] to one of mutual mistrust and deception.<ref name="structuredstrain"/>

For example, everyone has experienced pain and knows how a person in pain should appear to others.<ref name=McDermott>{{cite journal |author=McDermott BE, Feldman MD |title=Malingering in the medical setting |journal=Psychiatr Clin North Am |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=645–62 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2007.07.007 |pmid=17938038 }}</ref>
