'''Atul Kumar'''  '''[ अतुल कुमार् ]''' 
(Born, April 28, 1963, [[Lucknow]], [[India]]) is a scientist in the [[Central Drug Research Institute]] ([[CDRI]]) of [[Lucknow]], [[India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdriindia.org/atulkumar.htm|accessdate = 15 September 2010|title=Biodata of Dr. Atul Kumar| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100918203800/http://cdriindia.org/atulkumar.htm| archivedate= 18 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
His  areas of research are organic chemistry, [[medicinal chemistry]] and drug design. He has made significant contributions to research on [[osteoporosis]], [[cancer]], [[Tuberculosis]], [[diabetes]] and other [[metabolic disorder]]s. He also has considerable contributions in the area of organic chemistry particularly in the development of organocatalysed synthesis, [[Biomimetic synthesis]], [[multicomponent reaction]], [[Green chemistry]], [[sonochemistry]], enzymatic synthesis,  and [[diversity oriented synthesis]], Functional Ionic Liquid Mediated Synthesis (FILMS).

==Education & Profession==
Atul Kumar obtained his masters degree and [[Ph.D]] from [[Lucknow University]], then worked as a post-doc at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]].
He is working as a Principal scientist (Srfaculty member) in the department of Medicinal Chemistry at the [[Central Drug Research Institute]] in Lucknow, India.
He has  developed a new drug candidates "CENTHANK" CDRI-99-373,(anti-[[resorptive]] agent)for the treatment of [[osteoporosis]] which is currently in [[Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_I|Phase I]] [[clinical trial]]s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdriindia.org/cdr99373.htm|title= Compound CDRI-99/373|accessdate=15 September 2010|author=CDRI| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100918152004/http://cdriindia.org/cdr99373.htm| archivedate= 18 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}, http://www.indianexpress.com/news/cdri-develops-molecule-to-tackle-osteoporosis/528361/2,

In the area of medicinal chemistry, he has some nice contributions such as; he has developed a [[natural product]] inspired diversity oriented synthesis of tetrahydroquinoline analogues as [[antitubercular agent]]s,<ref>{{Citation|url= http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/co100022h }}</ref> he has reported [[pyranocoumarins]]: a new class of anti-[[hyperglycemic]] and anti-[[dyslipidemic]] agents,<ref>{{Citation|url= http://202.127.145.151/siocl/siocl_0004/090902hhpdf/090923bmcl-2.pdf }}</ref> design and synthesis of 1,3-biarylsulfanyl derivatives as new anti-[[breast cancer]] agents.<ref>{{Citation|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089611006183}} </ref>

In the area of organic synthesis, he has been involved in the development of new catalysts such as Liposomised [[mCPBA]] (LIP-mCPBA), new solid-supported [[hypervalent]] [[iodine]] reagents, and the use of human [[hemoglobin]] (HbA) and [[supramolecular]] [[carbohydrate]] molecules as solid catalysts for the synthesis of bioactive molecules.  He has extensively contributed to the development of organocatalysed synthesis, [[biomimetic synthesis]], [[multicomponent reaction]], [[sonochemistry]], enzymatic synthesis, high-throughput synthesis and diversity oriented synthesis.

Dr. Kumar was the first to demonstrate that [[single nucleotides]] have the ability to [[catalyze]] organic reactions, and performed [[biomimetic]] reductive amination, which is considered  as one of the most genuine biomimetric reactions of organic chemistry.  This single-[[nucleotide]] catalysis has immense impact  on many fields of science such as chemistry, biochemistry, and [[prebiotic (chemistry)|prebiotic]] studies, especially the [[RNA world]] and [[DNA world]] hypothesis for understanding the [[origin of life on Earth]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Kumar|first=Atul|coauthors=Siddharth Sharma, Ram Awatar Maurya|title=Single Nucleotide-Catalyzed Biomimetic Reductive Amination|journal=Advanced Synthesis and Catalyst|year=2010|doi =10.1002/adsc.201000178|volume=352|issue=13|pages=2227–2232|postscript=.}}</ref>

Dr. Kumar has reported an efficient and conceptually different approach toward [[C-H bond activation]] by using iodine mediated sp<sup>3</sup> C-H functionalization for the synthesis of alkyl azarene pyridinium [[zwitterion]]s.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kumar|first=Atul|coauthors= Garma Gupta, Sumen Srivastava, |title= Synthesis of New Class of Alkyl Azarene Pyridinium Zwitterions via Iodine Mediated sp3 C–H Bond Activation|journal= [[Organic Letters]] |year=2011| doi =10.1021/ol202654j|volume=13|issue=24|pages=6366|postscript=.}}</ref>

Dr. Kumar has recently demonstrated a new protocol for organic synthesis involving Functional [[Ionic Liquids]] and named this new methodology as Functional Ionic Liquid Mediated Synthesis (FILMS).<ref>{{Citation|last=Kumar|first=Atul|coauthors= et.al. |title= Functional ionic liquid mediated synthesis (FILMS) of dihydrothiophenes and tacrine |journal= [[Green Chemistry (journal)|Green Chemistry]] |year=2011| doi=10.1039/C1GC15410A |volume=13|pages=2459|postscript=.}}</ref>

These studies have resulted in publication of about 75 original research papers, and 42 patents.

==Awards and honors==
Kumar has won several awards for the design, synthesis and discovery of [[New Chemical Entities]] (NCEs) for various [[therapeutic]] areas associated with women reproductive health (osteoporosis) and [[metabolic diseases]] like diabetes<ref>{{Citation|url=http://csirindia.wordpress.com/2010/01/09/new-molecule-to-control-sugar-and-protect/.html}}</ref>
