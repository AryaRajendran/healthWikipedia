'''Nd:YAG''' ('''neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet'''; '''Nd:Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>''') is a [[crystal]] that is used as a [[Active laser medium|lasing medium]] for [[solid-state laser]]s. The [[dopant]], triply ionized [[neodymium]], Nd(III),  typically replaces a small fraction of the [[yttrium]] ions in the host crystal structure of the [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] (YAG), since the two ions are of similar size. It is the neodymium ion which proves the lasing activity in the crystal, in the same fashion as red chromium ion in ruby lasers. Generally the crystalline YAG host is doped with around 1% neodymium by atomic percent.<ref name="Koechner2.3">Koechner §2.3, pp. 48–53.</ref>

Laser operation of Nd:YAG was first demonstrated by J. E. Geusic ''et al.'' at [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1753928|title=Laser oscillations in nd-doped yttrium aluminum, yttrium gallium and gadolinium garnets|year=1964|last1=Geusic|first1=J.

==Technology==
[[File:YAG2.svg|thumb|300px|Neodymium ions in various types of ionic crystals, and also in glasses, act as a laser gain medium, typically emitting 1064 nm light from a particular atomic transition in the neodymium ion, after being "pumped" into excitation from an external source]]
Nd:[[yttrium aluminium garnet|YAG]] lasers are [[laser pumping|optically pumped]] using a [[flashtube]] or [[laser diode]]s. These are one of the most common types of laser, and are used for many different applications.
Nd:YAG lasers typically emit light with a [[wavelength]] of 1064 [[nanometer|nm]], in the [[infrared]].<ref name="Yariv10.3">{{cite book | first =Amnon | last =Yariv | year =1989 | title = Quantum Electronics| edition =3rd | publisher =Wiley | isbn =0-471-60997-8|page=§10.3, pp. 208–211}}</ref> However, there are also transitions near 940, 1120, 1320, and 1440&nbsp;nm.  Nd:YAG lasers operate in both pulsed and continuous mode. Pulsed Nd:YAG lasers are typically operated in the so called [[Q-switching]] mode: An optical switch is inserted in the laser cavity waiting for a maximum [[population inversion]] in the neodymium ions before it opens. Then the light wave can run through the cavity, depopulating the excited laser medium at maximum population inversion. In this Q-switched mode, output powers of 250 megawatts and pulse durations of 10 to 25 nanoseconds have been achieved.<ref>Walter Koechner (1965) ''Solid-state laser engineering'', Springer-Verlag, p. 507</ref> The high-intensity pulses may be efficiently [[second harmonic generation|frequency doubled]] to generate laser light at 532&nbsp;nm, or higher harmonics at 355 and 266&nbsp;nm.

Nd:YAG absorbs mostly in the bands between 730–760&nbsp;nm and 790–820&nbsp;nm.<ref name="Yariv10.3"/> At low [[current density|current densities]] [[krypton]] flashlamps have higher output in those bands than do the more common [[xenon]] lamps, which produce more light at around 900&nbsp;nm. The former are therefore more efficient for pumping Nd:YAG lasers.<ref name="Koechner6.1.1">Koechner §6.1.1, pp. 251–264.</ref>

The amount of the neodymium [[dopant]] in the material varies according to its use. For [[continuous wave]] output, the doping is significantly lower than for pulsed lasers. The lightly doped CW rods can be optically distinguished by being less colored, almost white, while higher-doped rods are pink-purplish.

Other common host materials for neodymium are: YLF ([[yttrium lithium fluoride]], 1047 and 1053&nbsp;nm), YVO<sub>4</sub> ([[yttrium orthovanadate]], 1064&nbsp;nm), and [[glass]]. A particular host material is chosen in order to obtain a desired combination of optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. Nd:YAG lasers and variants are [[laser pumping|pumped]] either by [[flashtube]]s, continuous [[gas discharge lamp]]s, or near-infrared [[laser diode]]s ([[DPSS laser]]s). [[Prestabilized laser]] (PSL) types of Nd:YAG lasers have proved to be particularly useful in providing the main beams for [[gravitational wave]] [[interferometer]]s such as [[LIGO]], [[VIRGO]], [[GEO600]] and [[TAMA 300|TAMA]].

==Applications==
===Medicine===

Nd:YAG lasers  are used in [[ophthalmology]] to correct [[posterior capsular opacification]], a condition that may occur after [[cataract]] surgery, and for peripheral [[iridotomy]] in patients with [[acute angle-closure glaucoma]], where it has superseded [[iridectomy|surgical iridectomy]]. [[Second harmonic generation|Frequency-doubled]] Nd:YAG lasers (wavelength 532&nbsp;nm) are used for pan-retinal [[photocoagulation]] in patients with [[diabetic retinopathy]].

To treat [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), Nd:YAG lasers can be used for [[Prostatectomy#Laser_prostate_surgery|laser prostate surgery]]—a form of [[transurethral resection of the prostate]].

These lasers are also used extensively in the field of cosmetic medicine for [[laser hair removal]] and the treatment of minor [[vascular]] defects such as [[spider veins]] on the face and legs. Recently used for dissecting cellulitis, a rare skin disease usually occurring on the scalp.

Using [[hysteroscopy]] the Nd:YAG laser has been used for removal of [[uterine septum|uterine septa]] within the inside of the uterus.<ref name=yang >{{cite journal | author=Yang J, Yin TL, Xu WM, Xia LB, Li AB, Hu J. |title=Reproductive outcome of septate uterus after hysteroscopic treatment with neodymium:YAG laser |journal=Photomed Laser Surg. | pmid=17069494 | year=2006 | volume=24 | issue=5 | pages=625 | doi=10.1089/pho.2006.24.625}}</ref>

In [[podiatry]], the Nd:YAG laser is being used to treat [[onychomycosis]], which is fungus infection of the toenail.{{cn|date=February 2011}} The merits of laser treatment of these infections are not yet clear, and research is being done to establish effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Podiatry Today |title=Laser care for onychomycosis: can it be effective? |volume=23 |issue=5 |month=May |year=2010|url=http://www.podiatrytoday.com/laser-care-for-onychomycosis-can-it-be-effective |pages=54–59 |first1=John |last1=Mozena |first2=Brent |last2=Haverstock}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Podiatry Today |title=Emerging concepts in treating onychomycosis |volume=22 |issue=10 |month=October |year=2009 |pages=46–51 |first1=John D. |last1=Mozena |first2=Joshua P. |last2=Mitnick|url=http://www.podiatrytoday.com/emerging-concepts-in-treating-onychomycosis}}</ref>

===Manufacturing===
Nd:YAG lasers are also used in manufacturing for engraving, etching, or marking a variety of metals and plastics. They are extensively used in manufacturing for [[laser cutting | cutting]] and welding steel, [[wafer dicing | semiconductors]] and various alloys. For automotive applications (cutting and welding steel) the power levels are typically 1–5&nbsp;kW.  Super alloy drilling (for gas turbine parts) typically uses pulsed Nd:YAG lasers (millisecond pulses, not Q-switched). Nd:YAG lasers are also employed to make [[subsurface marking]]s in transparent materials such as [[glass]] or [[acrylic glass]].  Lasers of up to 400&nbsp;W are used for selective laser melting of metals in additive layered manufacturing. In aerospace applications, they can be used to [[Laser drilling|drill]] cooling holes for enhanced air flow/heat exhaust efficiency.{{fact|date=November 2012}}

===Fluid dynamics===

Nd:YAG lasers can also be used for flow visualization techniques in fluid dynamics (for example [[particle image velocimetry]] or laser induced fluorescence).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rapid in-vitro physiologic flow experimentation using rapid prototyping and particle image velocimetry |first=Gilbert N. |last=Palafox|coauthors=Wicker, Ryan B.; and Elkins, Christopher J. |journal=2003 Summer Bioengineering Conference |year=2003 |pages=419 |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~sbc2003/pdfdocs/0419.PDF | format=pdf| accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

===Dentistry===
Nd:YAG lasers are used for [[soft tissue]] [[surgery|surgeries]] in the [[oral cavity]], such as [[gingivectomy]], periodontal [[sulcular debridement]], [[LANAP]], [[frenectomy]], [[biopsy]], and [[coagulation]] of graft donor sites.

===Military and defense===
[[Image:SSY1 Military Surplus Nd-YAG Laser Firing.JPG|thumb|300px|Military surplus Nd:YAG laser rangefinder firing. The laser fires through a collimator, focusing the beam, which blasts a hole through a rubber block, releasing a burst of plasma.]]The Nd:YAG laser is the most common laser used in [[laser designator]]s and [[laser rangefinder]]s.

===Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS)===
The Nd:YAG may be used in the application of [[cavity ring-down spectroscopy]], which is used to measure the concentration of some light-absorbing substance.

===Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)===

{{main|Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy}}
A range of Nd:YAG lasers are used in analysis of elements in the periodic table. Though the application by itself is fairly new with respect to conventional methods such as XRF or ICP,<!--What do these abbreviations stand for??--> it has proven to be less time consuming and a cheaper option to test element concentrations. A high-power Nd:YAG laser is focused onto the sample surface to produce [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Light from the plasma is captured by spectrometers and the characteristic spectra of each element can be identified, allowing concentrations of elements in the sample to be measured.

===Laser pumping===

Nd:YAG lasers, mainly via their second and third harmonics, are widely used to excite [[dye lasers]] either in the liquid<ref>[[F. P. Schäfer]] (Ed.), ''Dye Lasers'' (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1990).</ref> or [[solid state dye lasers|solid state]].<ref>[[F. J. Duarte]], ''Tunable Laser Optics'' (Elsevier-Academic, New York, 2003).</ref>  They are also used as pump sources for vibronically broadened solid-state lasers such as [[Yttrium aluminium garnet#Cr4+:YAG|Cr<sup>4+</sup>:YAG]] or via the second harmonic for pumping [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire laser]]s.

===Automotive===
Researchers from Japan's [[National Institutes of Natural Sciences]] are developing laser igniters that use YAG chips to ignite fuel in an engine, in place of a [[spark plug]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/laser-ignition-spark-plug-alternative/18469/ |title=Laser igniters could spell the end for the humble spark plug |first=Ben |last=Coxworth |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate= March 30, 2012 |work=Gizmag}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Composite, all-ceramics, high-peak power Nd:YAG/Cr<sup>4+</sup>:YAG monolithic micro-laser with multiple-beam output for engine ignition |first=Nicolaie |last=Pavel |coauthors=et al. |journal=Optics Express |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=9378–9384 |year=2011 |doi=10.1364/OE.19.009378|bibcode = 2011OExpr..19.9378P }}</ref> 
The lasers use several 800 picosecond long pulses to ignite the fuel, producing faster and more uniform ignition. The researchers say that such igniters could yield better performance and fuel economy, with fewer harmful emissions.

==Additional frequencies==
For many applications, the infrared light is [[nonlinear optics|frequency-doubled]] or -tripled using [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical materials]] such as [[lithium triborate]] to obtain visible (532&nbsp;nm, green) or [[ultraviolet]] light. [[Cesium lithium borate]] generates the 4th and 5th harmonics of the Nd:YAG 1064&nbsp;nm fundamental wavelength. A green [[laser pointer]] is a frequency doubled [[Neodymium doped yttrium orthovanadate|Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>]] DPSS laser. Nd:YAG can be also made to lase at its non-principal wavelength. The line at 946&nbsp;nm is typically employed in "blue laser pointer" DPSS lasers, where it is doubled to 473&nbsp;nm.
