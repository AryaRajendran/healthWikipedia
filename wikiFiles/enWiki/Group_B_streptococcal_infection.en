Infection with '''Group B Streptococcus''' ('''GBS'''), also known as ''''''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'''''' and more colloquially as Strep B and group B Strep, can cause serious illness and sometimes death, especially in newborn infants, the elderly, and patients with compromised immune systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhpe.org/infect/strepb.html |title=Group B Streptococcus Facts |publisher=Dhpe.org |date=4 October 1998 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> Group B streptococci are also prominent veterinary [[pathogen]]s, because they can cause bovine [[mastitis]] ([[inflammation]] of the [[udder]]) in dairy cows. The species name "agalactiae" meaning "no milk", alludes to this.

[[Streptococcus]] is a [[genus]] of [[spherical]], [[Gram-positive]] bacteria of the [[phylum]] [[Firmicutes]]. ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'' is a [[gram-positive]] streptococcus characterized by the presence of Group B [[Rebecca Lancefield|Lancefield antigen]], and so takes the name Group B Streptococcus. The [[CAMP test]] is an important test for identification. GBS (group B Streptococcus species) are screened through this test. It is characterized by the presence of group B Lancefield antigen and by its ability to hydrolyze sodium hippurate.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=371403 |year=1979 |last1=Smith |first1=JP |last2=Durfee |first2=KK |last3=Marymont Jr |first3=JH |title=A review of laboratory methods for identification of group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae) |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=199–204 |journal=The American journal of medical technology}}</ref> It is also sensitive to bile, and will lyse in its presence.

==Perinatal disease==
[[Image:Group B Strep.gif|right|500px|U.S. Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease, CDC]] 

Group B ''Streptococcus'' (GBS) is a part of normal flora of the gut and genital tract and is found in 20–40% women. It may be harmful to both mother and the baby itself. Infection of this organism may result in neonatal death due to severe neonatal infection. It may also result in maternal death although this is only occasionally by causing upper genital tract infection which progresses to septicemia. Carriage of the organism is asymptomatic.<ref>Obstetrics by Ten Teachers, 18th edition{{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref> Newborn GBS disease is separated into early-onset disease occurring on living days 0–7 and late-onset disease which starts on days 7–90. Early-onset septicemia is more prone to be accompanied by pneumonia, this is thought to be due to aspiration of GBS during birth, while late-onset septicimia is more often accompanied by meningitis.

===Positive culture===
25% of women are colonized with GBS in the vagina or rectum.<ref name="cdcwebsite">

</ref> Since the bacteria can come and go, testing for GBS is recommended by US public health protocols at the 36 week [[antenatal]] appointment of every  pregnancy. The [[vagina]] and [[rectum]] are swabbed and cultures grown in enriched culture media. In the UK, cultures are not routinely taken from pregnant women for testing, but rather women are treated according to their risk in labor – [[antibiotics]] are given to women where GBS has been found incidentally from their urine or vaginal/rectal swabs taken during the pregnancy, women who have previously had a baby infected with GBS disease, women whose membranes are ruptured more than 18 hours and those who have fever in labor. In some countries, including the UK, suboptimal culture methods are used, which result in up to half of women carrying GBS when swabbed, and being given a false-negative test result. Treatment of GBS positive women with intravenous [[penicillin G]] or Ampicillin at the onset of labor and then again at every four hours reduces early onset infection,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000115.pub2 |chapter=Intrapartum antibiotics for Group B streptococcal colonisation |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2010 |last1=Smaill |first1=Fiona M |editor1-last=Smaill |editor1-first=Fiona M |pmid=10796138 |issue=2 |pages=CD000115 |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews}}</ref> but research has shown that treatment at least 2 hours prior to birth may also reduce the risk of neonatal infection.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1067/mob.2001.113875 |title=The effectiveness of risk-based intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease |year=2001 |last1=Lin |first1=F |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=184 |issue=6 |pages=1204–10 |pmid=11349189 |last2=Brenner |first2=RA |last3=Johnson |first3=YR |last4=Azimi |first4=PH |last5=Philips Jb |first5=3rd |last6=Regan |first6=JA |last7=Clark |first7=P |last8=Weisman |first8=LE |last9=Rhoads |first9=GG}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(97)00587-5 |title=Timing of Intrapartum Ampicillin and Prevention of Vertical Transmission of Group B Streptococcus |year=1998 |last1=De Cueto |first1=M |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=91 |pmid=9464732 |pages=112–4 |last2=Sanchez |first2=MJ |last3=Sampedro |first3=A |last4=Miranda |first4=JA |last5=Herruzo |first5=AJ |last6=Rosa-Fraile |first6=M |issue=1}}</ref> For women known to carry GBS where it is not expected that the intravenous antibiotics can be given for at least four hours before delivery, an intramuscular injection of 4.8 MU (2.9 g) of Penicillin G at about 35 weeks of pregnancy may be useful in addition to intravenous antibiotics given from the onset of labour or membranes rupturing at intervals until delivery to try to eradicate GBS colonisation until after the baby is born.

The most effective preventative measure is intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis during labour, which minimises the risk of the baby acquiring the infection as he/she passes through the vagina during delivery.  The difficulty is in knowing which women should be treated with antibiotics, and which should not – it is not desirable to treat women who are not at risk, as any antibiotic treatment can have side effects. Current UK guidelines use risk factors for determining which women should be treated.  Several risk factors, such as previously having had a GBS infected baby, maternal fever during pregnancy and prolonged rupture of membranes, mean that the risk of GBS infection in the baby is substantially higher.  However, a significant number of at-risk women will be missed by using risk factors alone

Where insufficient intravenous antibiotics are given before delivery, the baby may be given antibiotics immediately after birth, although evidence is inconclusive as to whether this is necessary or effective.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003667.pub2 |chapter=Intramuscular penicillin for the prevention of early onset group B streptococcal infection in newborn infants |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2004 |last1=Woodgate |first1=Paul G |last2=Flenady |first2=Vicki |last3=Steer |first3=Peter A |editor1-last=Woodgate |editor1-first=Paul G}}</ref> Some maternity units take a watchful approach for 24–48 hours, only giving antibiotics if the baby shows any symptoms of infection,<ref>http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/neonatal_audit_full_250507.pdf{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> or if there is laboratory evidence on [[complete blood count]] or culture of infection. If a woman presents late in her [[prenatal]] period then there may be no time to grow cultures prior to labor, or she may present in active labor without documentation of prenatal care. In this situation, some clinicians advocate [[empirical]] antibiotic coverage of mother and baby, although most would only advocate antibiotics for the mother if other recognized risk factors were present.

===Prevention===

== Group B Streptococcus Vaccine Research ==

Group B Streptococcus, also known as Streptococcus agalactiae colonize the vaginal and gastrointestinal tracts in healthy women, with carriage rates ranging from 15%-45%. The absence of antibody to group B streptococci in infants is a risk factor for infection. Group B streptococcal infection in elderly people (≥70 y) is strongly linked to congestive heart failure and being bedridden, with urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and soft-tissue infection as the most common manifestations of infection. Neurologic illness is associated with pneumonia in elderly people, due to aspiration of group B streptococci from the upper respiratory tract. Urinary tract infections are a common manifestation of group B streptococcal disease and are observed in both pregnant and nonpregnant adults. Vaccine development was once promising, but shifting serotypes of group B streptococci responsible for clinical disease have limited this approach. The broad use of antibiotics in pregnant women is of concern to public health officials. Many women are allergic to penicillin and penicillin-type antibiotics that are the preferred treatment, and GBS is increasingly resistant to other common antibiotics. A Phase II clinical study that indicates a vaccine to prevent Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is possible by 2019.

==Diagnosis==
Babies at greatest risk of developing GBS disease are those born to women who carry GBS during labour.  Testing women during pregnancy for GBS is not currently done in the UK, allegedly because of the costs and logistics involved.  Research has shown that testing pregnant women, using the more sensitive ECM tests, and giving antibiotics in labour to those carrying GBS and to high-risk women, was significantly more cost-effective than using a risk-factor approach.  One research paper calculated an expected net benefit to the Government of such an approach to be around £37&nbsp;million a year, compared with the current [[RCOG]] approach<ref name="Colbourn2007">{{cite journal |pmid=17651659 |year=2007 |last1=Colbourn |first1=T |last2=Asseburg |first2=C |last3=Bojke |first3=L |last4=Philips |first4=Z |last5=Claxton |first5=K |last6=Ades |first6=AE |last7=Gilbert |first7=RE |title=Prenatal screening and treatment strategies to prevent group B streptococcal and other bacterial infections in early infancy: Cost-effectiveness and expected value of information analyses |volume=11 |issue=29 |pages=1–226, iii |journal=Health technology assessment}}</ref><ref name=pmid17848402>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.39325.681806.AD |title=Preventive strategies for group B streptococcal and other bacterial infections in early infancy: Cost effectiveness and value of information analyses |year=2007 |last1=Colbourn |first1=T.

GBS tests are performed by using a swab test. Swabs are ideally taken from the lower vagina and rectum at 35–37 weeks of pregnancy.<ref name="autogenerated1999">{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.103.6.e77 |title=Risk Factors for Early-onset Group B Streptococcal Sepsis: Estimation of Odds Ratios by Critical Literature Review |year=1999 |last1=Benitz |first1=W.

Routine screening of pregnant women is performed in many counties, including USA, Canada, Australia, Israel, Belgium, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Argentina and Kenya.  Published evidence has shown universally falling incidences of GBS infection in these countries following introduction of these screening-based preventive measures. A reliable test is not routinely offered within the NHS in the UK, and the number of GBS infections as a result is rising.

===Direct plating method===
If the swabs are processed directly on to laboratory plates and GBS is grown, then this positive result is very reliable. Special growth plates can be used that indicate the presence of GBS by a colour change.<ref name="gragar1">{{cite journal |pmid=10405415 |year=1999 |last1=Gil |first1=EG |last2=Rodríguez |first2=MC |last3=Bartolomé |first3=R |last4=Berjano |first4=B |last5=Cabero |first5=L |last6=Andreu |first6=A |title=Evaluation of the Granada agar plate for detection of vaginal and rectal group B streptococci in pregnant women |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=2648–51 |pmc=85303 |journal=Journal of clinical microbiology}}</ref><ref name="gragar2">{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1469-0691.2001.00156.x |title=Modified Granada Agar Medium for the detection of group B streptococcus carriage in pregnant women |year=2001 |last1=Claeys |first1=G. |last2=Verschraegen |first2=G. |last3=Temmerman |first3=M. |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=7 |pmid=11284939 |pages=22–4 |issue=1}}</ref> However, this method is very susceptible to giving false negative results when the swabs don't bring up GBS – this can be as high as 50% of samples,<ref name="autogenerated1999"/> leaving up to half of the pregnant women who were carrying GBS at the time the swab was taken under the false impression that they are not carrying GBS and their baby is not at risk.

===Enriched culture medium===
To reduce the number of false negative results, the laboratory can take an extra step to improve the accuracy of the test. This involves growing the samples in an enriched medium to improve the viability of the GBS in the same as opposed to the other naturally occurring bacteria. This usually takes 24–48 hours. Following this, the sample is plated as before, to determine whether GBS is present. This enriched culture medium (or ECM) method is the "Gold Standard" of GBS testing and is the best GBS test currently available.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21088663 |year=2010 |last1=Verani |first1=JR |last2=McGee |first2=L |last3=Schrag |first3=SJ |last4=Division Of Bacterial Diseases |first4=National Center for Immunization Respiratory Diseases |title=Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease--revised guidelines from CDC, 2010 |volume=59 |issue=RR–10 |pages=1–36 |journal=MMWR. Recommendations and reports}}</ref> It may miss a very small number of women who carry GBS, although it will not give a false positive result. It is the method described by the Heath Protection Agency's BSOP58,<ref name="hpa-standardmethods" /> Processing swabs for group B Streptococcal carriage. The ECM test is believed{{by whom|date=April 2012}} to be offered on a handful of UK NHS hospitals, including the [[Royal Shrewsbury Hospital]], [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Princess Elizabeth (Guernsey) and [[Royal Free Hospital]]. The test is also available privately, for around £32 for a UK-wide postal service.<ref> http://www.medisave.co.uk/group-b-streptococcus-screening-test-p-7896.html?gclid=CP7Z276TwbICFQfMtAod0mUAGQ </ref> Organisations which offer the test privately and which follow the HPA's BSOP58 are listed on the website of charity Group B Strep Support.<ref name="gbss" /> The ECM test costs more than the direct plating method, due to the extra step involved, and would requirea change both in antenatal care and in what is available from laboratories serving the NHS. However, none of the constituent parts of the ECM tests are difficult to obtain or expensive, and the tests has been proved to be safe over decades of use in other countrines.  The implememtation of standardised ECM testing nationally in the UK is a viable option.  At present, culture for GBS (using enriched culture medium) at 35–37 weeks to define an at-risk group is the most cost-effective strategy currently practicable.<ref name=pmid17848402/><ref name=pmid21040389>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02725.x |title=Intrapartum tests for group B streptococcus: Accuracy and acceptability of screening |year=2011 |last1=Daniels |first1=JP |last2=Gray |first2=J |last3=Pattison |first3=HM |last4=Gray |first4=R |last5=Hills |first5=RK |last6=Khan |first6=KS |journal=BJOG: an International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology |volume=118 |issue=2 |pmid=21040389 |pages=257–65 |last7=Gbs Collaborative |first7=Group}}</ref><ref name="Kaambwa2010">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02752.x |title=Cost-effectiveness of rapid tests and other existing strategies for screening and management of early-onset group B streptococcus during labour |year=2010 |last1=Kaambwa |first1=B |last2=Bryan |first2=S |last3=Gray |first3=J |last4=Milner |first4=P |last5=Daniels |first5=J |last6=Khan |first6=KS |last7=Roberts |first7=TE |journal=BJOG: an International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology |volume=117 |issue=13 |pmid=19187367 |pages=357–65}}</ref>

===PCR intrapartum testing===
No tests are currently available which are both accurate enough and fast enough to recommend their use for detecting GBS once labour has started. Plating of swab samples requires time for the bacteria to proliferate, meaning it is unsuitable as an intrapartum test. An alternative method is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (or PCR) method. In-labour PCR testing for GBS carriage could in future be sufficiently sensitive to guide offering of antibiotics in labour, but the technique needs to be improved and made simpler in order for the method to become a cost effective option.  

Testing women for GBS colonisation using vaginal and/or rectal swabs taken at 35–37 weeks of gestation and culturing them in enriched media – as practised in many countries – may not be quite as sensitive as a PCR test in labour would be at predicting whether the pregnant woman will be carrying GBS at delivery, but it would allow antibiotics to be started on admission to the labour ward.  The PCR technology needs to be simplified and speeded up to be useful as a point-of care test.

==Epidemiology==
===UK===
The following are estimates of the chances a baby in Britain will become infected with Group B streptococcal infection (GBS) if no preventative measures are taken and no other risk factors are present:<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10353974 |year=1999 |last1=Benitz |first1=WE |last2=Gould |first2=JB |last3=Druzin |first3=ML |title=Risk factors for early-onset group B streptococcal sepsis: Estimation of odds ratios by critical literature review |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=e77 |journal=Pediatrics |doi=10.1542/peds.103.6.e77}}</ref>
* 1 in 1,000* where the woman is not known to be a carrier of GBS;
* 1 in 400 where the woman is carrying GBS during the pregnancy;
* 1 in 300 where the woman is carrying GBS at delivery; and
* 1 in 100 where the woman has had a previous baby infected with GBS.

<small>(*This is a broadly accepted estimate of the number of GBS infections in newborn babies that would occur if no preventative intravenous antibiotics in labour are given and this estimate has been used throughout this document.  However, recent UK research<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13553-2 |title=Estimated early-onset group B streptococcal neonatal disease |year=2003 |last1=Luck |first1=Suzanne |last2=Torny |first2=Michael |last3=d'Agapeyeff |first3=Katrina |last4=Pitt |first4=Alison |last5=Heath |first5=Paul |last6=Breathnach |first6=Aoadhan |last7=Russell |first7=Alison Bedford |journal=The Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9373 |pages=1953}}</ref> has suggested this may be a serious underestimate of the incidence of GBS infection in newborns, which could be as high as 3.6 per 1,000.)</small>

If a woman who carries GBS is given antibiotics during labour the baby’s risk is reduced significantly:
* 1 in 8,000 where the mother carries GBS during pregnancy;
* 1 in 6,000 where the mother carries GBS at delivery; and
* 1 in 2,200 where the mother has previously had a baby infected with GBS.

==Guidelines==
===Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists===
RCOG issued their Green Top Guideline No 36 "Prevention of early onset neonatal Group B streptococcal disease" in November 2003.<ref name="Hicks2009" /> This document is currently under review, and updated guidelines are due later in 2012. However, the guidelines use minimum incidence figures from a surveillance study undertaken in 2000-1<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)15389-5 |title=Group B streptococcal disease in UK and Irish infants younger than 90 days |year=2004 |last1=Heath |first1=Paul T |last2=Balfour |first2=Gail |last3=Weisner |first3=Abbie M |last4=Efstratiou |first4=Androulla |last5=Lamagni |first5=Theresa L |last6=Tighe |first6=Helen |last7=O'Connell |first7=Liam AF |last8=Cafferkey |first8=Mary |last9=Verlander |first9=Neville Q |journal=The Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9405 |pages=292}}</ref> and, therefore, not only underestimate the true incidence of GBS infection but also underestimate the risks to babies from GBS infection.  GBS infection in babies has increased in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since 2003 (when the guideline was introduced) – voluntarily reported cases from the CDR/HPA show 0.48 cases per 1000 live births in 2003, which increased to 0.64 per 1000 in 2009<ref name="Pyogenic and non-pyogenic streptococcal bacteraemia">{{cite journal |title=Pyogenic and non-pyogenic streptococcal bacteraemia, England, Wales and Northern Ireland: 2010 |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317131482001 |journal=Health Protection Report |volume=5 |issue=46 |pages=1–19 |year=2011}}</ref> In 2007, RCOG published the findings of their audit to evaluate practice in UK obstetric units against their recommendations.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Cromwell |editor2-first=Tracey |editor2-last=Joffe |editor3-first=Jan |editor3-last=van der Meulen |editor4-first=Charnjit |editor4-last=Dhillon |editor5-first=Rhona |editor5-last=Hughes |editor6-first=Deirdre |editor6-last=Murphy |year=2007 |title=The Prevention of Early-onset Neonatal Group B Streptococcal Disease in UK Obstetric Units |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |isbn=978-1-904752-37-0 |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/neonatal_audit_full_250507.pdf}}{{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>  The audit started out by comparing international guidelines for early onset GBS disease: highlighting the fact that, in contrast to the UK and New Zealand guidelines, most of the other countries surveyed recommended identifying women for intravenous antibiotics in labour by offering sensitive tests to all pregnant women.  The audit reviewed hospitals’ protocols against GBS infection in newborn babies – of the 161 UK units, which submitted their protocol, four units did not even have a protocol for GBS, of those that did, 35% did not mention the 2003 RCOG guideline, and only a minority of units had protocols that were entirely consistent with the guideline. Further UK research published in 2010<ref name="Pyogenic and non-pyogenic streptococcal bacteraemia"/> looked at the opportunities for prevention amongst cases of early onset group B Strep infection in babies following introduction of the RCOG Guideline.  They found that, in the 48 cases of GBS during 2004 to 2007 (0.52/1000 live births), only 19% of the mothers in whom risk factors were present were given adequate intravenous antibiotics in labour.  The researchers stated that, “if all women with risk factors received prophylaxis, 23 cases (48%) may have been prevented.”{{cite quote|date=April 2012}}

===National Institute for Clinical Excellence===
NICE’S Guidelines CG6 “Antenatal Care – Routine care for health pregnant women”, October 2003 recommend that “pregnant women should be offered evidence based information and support to enable them to make informed decisions regarding their care … addressing women’s choices should be recognised as being integral to the decision making process.” The guidelines also recommend antenatal appointments for all pregnant women at 36 weeks’ gestation – which would be ideal for sensitive testing for GBS colonisation.  However, NICE does not recommend such testing, saying, “evidence of its clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness remains uncertain.”  However, the evidence of similar screening studies clearly demonstrates the clinical effectiveness of testing pregnant women for GBS and offering intravenous antibiotics in labour to women whose babies are at increased risk.  Countries which have introduced such programmes have seen in their incidence of GBS infection fall dramatically, including the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, France, Spain and Italy.<ref name="Pyogenic and non-pyogenic streptococcal bacteraemia"/>  Cost effectiveness issue is less clear-cut though a study published in September 2007<ref name="Colbourn2007" /><ref name=pmid17848402/> indicated testing low risk women, plus antibiotics given to high-risk women and those found to carry GBS was more cost-effective than current practice. Further research has also found screening to be more cost effective than risk factors<ref name=pmid21040389/><ref name="Kaambwa2010" />

===National Screening Committee===
The National Screening Committee’s current policy position on group B Strep is that screening should not be offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screening.nhs.uk/groupbstreptococcus |title=Policies |publisher=Screening.nhs.uk |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> This policy was reviewed in November 2008 but no significant changes were made.  It is due to be considered again in 2012 or earlier if significant new peer-reviewed evidence emerges.  
In May 2006, the UK National Screening Committee launched their GBS online learning package. This learning package was developed to raise awareness of GBS amongst health care professionals.  Developed by the Women’s Health Specialist Library (part of the National Library for Health), the learning package is based upon the current UK guidelines published by the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists.  It is divided into three sections – antenatal, delivery and postnatal.  Within each section, there is the option to access an introduction to GBS, different clinical scenarios, a series of quiz questions to test knowledge and a FAQs section.

The United States uses the most effective strategy: all pregnant women are screened for Group B Strep<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15768620 |year=2005 |last1=Apgar |first1=BS |last2=Greenberg |first2=G |last3=Yen |first3=G |title=Prevention of group B streptococcal disease in the newborn |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=903–10 |journal=American family physician}}</ref> and prophylactic antibiotics are given to all women testing positive and to those who deliver before 37 weeks of pregnancy plus to women with unknown GBS test result and other recognised risk factors. Because of this strategy, the US has seen a major reduction in babies born with early-onset infection<ref name=pmid19214159>{{cite journal |pmid=19214159 |year=2009 |author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |title=Trends in perinatal group B streptococcal disease - United States, 2000-2006 |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=109–12 |journal=MMWR.

Countries which routinely screen women for GBS carriage late in pregnancy and offer intrapartum antibiotics to those where GBS is found include USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Canada, Australia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Kenya and Argentina.

==In animals==
Group B strep has been found in many mammals such as camels, dogs, cats, crocodiles, seals or dolphins.

===Cattle===
Group B Strep was recognised as a pathogene in cattle before the Second World War. Its significance as human pathogene was not discovered before the 1950s. In cattle it causes mastitis, an infection of the udder. It can either give acute, febrile disease or sub-acute, more chronic disease. Both lead to diminishing milk production (hence its name: agalactiae meaning "no milk"). Outbreaks in herds are common. This is of major significance for the dairy industry and programs to reduce the impact of Group B Strep have been enforced in many countries over at least the last 30–40 years.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9220132 |year=1997 |last1=Keefe |first1=GP |title=Streptococcus agalactiae mastitis: A review |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=429–37 |pmc=1576741 |journal=The Canadian veterinary journal}}</ref>

===Fish===
Fisheries and wildlife officers from Queensland, Australia, have been investigating the deaths of more than 50 grouper fish, between 2008 and 2010, that have washed up dead on beaches in the north of the state. The fish had been infected with Group B Streptococcus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Paull |first1=Nathan |date=5 April 2010 |title=Mystery groper deaths |url=http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/article/2010/04/05/127795_news.html |work=Townsville Bulletin}}</ref>
