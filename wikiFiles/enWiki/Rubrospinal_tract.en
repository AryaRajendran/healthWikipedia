The '''rubrospinal tract''' is a part of the [[nervous system]]. It is a part of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|lateral]] indirect [[extra-pyramidal tract]].

==Function==
In humans, the rubrospinal tract is one of several major motor control pathways.  It is smaller and has fewer axons than the [[corticospinal tract]], suggesting that it is less important in motor control.  It is one of the pathways for the mediation of voluntary movement.  The tract is responsible for large [[muscle]] movement as well as fine motor control, and it terminates primarily in the cervical spinal cord, suggesting that it functions in upper limb but not in lower limb control.  It primarily facilitates [[flexion]] in the upper extremities (see [[decorticate posture]]).

It is small and rudimentary in [[humans]].  In some other primates, however, experiments have shown that over time, the rubrospinal tract can assume almost all the duties of the [[corticospinal tract]] when the corticospinal tract is lesioned.

==Path==
In the [[midbrain]], it originates in the [[magnocellular red nucleus]], crosses to the other side of the midbrain, and descends in the lateral part of the [[brainstem]] [[tegmentum]].<ref>http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s3/chapter02.html</ref>

In the [[spinal cord]], it travels through the [[lateral funiculus]] of the spinal cord in the company of the [[lateral corticospinal tract]].
