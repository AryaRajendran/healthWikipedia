'''Atrial septostomy''' is a [[Surgery|surgical procedure]] in which a small hole is created between the upper two chambers of the [[heart]], the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]]. This procedure is primarily used to treat [[dextro-Transposition of the great arteries]] or d-TGA (often imprecisely called [[transposition of the great arteries]]), a life-threatening [[Cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic]] [[congenital heart defect]] seen in infants. Atrial septostomy has also seen limited use as a surgical treatment for [[pulmonary hypertension]].<ref name="Am Heart J.">{{cite journal | last = Law| first = MA| authorlink = | coauthors = Grifka RG, Mullins CE, Nihil MR| title = Atrial septostomy improves survival in select patients with pulmonary hypertension.| journal = Am Heart J.| volume = 153| issue = 5| pages = 779–84| publisher = | month = May | year = 2007| url = | doi = 10.1016/j.ahj.2007.02.019| pmid = 17452153| accessdate =2007-11-14 }}</ref> This technique was developed in 1966 by [[United States|American]] [[surgeon]] [[William Rashkind]] (1922&ndash;1986) at the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]].

There are two types of this procedure: '''balloon atrial septostomy''' (also called '''endovascular atrial septostomy''', '''Rashkind atrial balloon septostomy''', or simply '''Rashkind's procedure''') and '''blade atrial septostomy''' (also called '''static balloon atrial septostomy''').

== Indications ==
In a normal [[heart]], [[oxygen]]-depleted blood ("blue") is pumped from the [[right heart|right side of the heart]], through the [[pulmonary artery]], to the [[lung]]s where it is oxygenated. This is the [[pulmonary circulation]] part of blood flow. The oxygen-rich ("red") blood then returns to the [[left heart]], via the [[pulmonary veins]], and is pumped through the [[aorta]] to the rest of the body, including the heart [[muscle]] itself. This is the [[systemic circulation]] part of blood flow, the other loop of an interconnected normal [[cardio]]-[[pulmonary]] system.

With d-TGA, certain major blood vessels are connected improperly, so oxygen-poor blood from the right heart is pumped immediately through the aorta and circulated to the body and the heart itself, bypassing the lungs altogether, while the left heart pumps oxygen-rich blood continuously back into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. This is a life-threatening situation due to the resultant [[Hypoxia (medical)|low oxygen levels]] throughout the body. Atrial septostomy allows more of the oxygen-rich blood to circulate throughout the body. The procedure is a temporary measure meant to help the patient survive until further corrective surgery can be done.

In the separate case of pulmonary hypertension, abnormally high blood pressure in the blood vessels within and connected to the lungs puts stress on the right side of the heart, potentially leading to [[Cor pulmonale|right heart failure]]. Atrial septostomy relieves some of this pressure, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in the blood ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]). As with d-TGA, this surgery is not a definitive solution to the underlying medical problem.<ref name="Am J Cardiol.">{{cite journal | last = Rothman| first = A| authorlink = | coauthors = Sklansky MS Lucas VW, Kashani IA, Shaughnessy RD, Channick RN, Auger WR, Fedullo PF,Smith CM, Kriett JM, Jamieson SW| title = Atrial septostomy as a bridge to lung transplantation in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.| journal = Am J Cardiol.| volume = 84| issue = 6| pages = 682–6| publisher = | date = 1999-09-15| url = | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9149(99)00416-6| pmid = 10498139| accessdate =2007-11-14 }}</ref>

== Procedure ==
The majority of atrial septostomies are performed on infants with d-TGA or other [[cyanotic heart defect]]s. In these cases, a [[balloon catheter]] is guided through a large [[vein]] into the [[right atrium]], during [[cardiac catheterization]]. The catheter is threaded into the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], a naturally-existing hole between the atria that normally closes shortly after birth. The balloon at the end of the catheter is inflated so as to enlarge the foramen ovale enough that it will no longer become sealed. This allows more oxygenated blood to enter the [[right heart]] (especially in the case of d-TGA) where it can be pumped to the rest of the body. The balloon is deflated and the catheter is removed.

Sometimes the initial surgery is not entirely successful, or there are other factors that make a simple balloon atrial septostomy impossible, such as an older patient whose foramen ovale has already closed. This is when a blade atrial septostomy is performed. The details of the procedure are largely the same, except that a small blade on the end of the [[catheter]] is first used to create an opening between the right and left atria, before the insertion of the balloon.

== Risks ==
As with any surgery, there are certain risks to atrial septostomy, including tearing of the cardiac tissue, [[arrythmia]]s, and rarely, death.
