The '''very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor''' ('''VLDLR''') is a [[transmembrane receptor|transmembrane]] [[lipoprotein]] receptor of the [[low density lipoprotein receptor gene family|low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family]]. VLDLR shows considerable [[Homology (biology)|homology]] with the members of this lineage. Discovered in 1992 by T. Yamamoto, VLDLR is widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body, including the heart, skeletal muscle, [[adipose tissue]], and the brain, but is absent from the liver.<ref name="pmid11111096">{{cite journal | author = Nimpf J, Schneider WJ | title = From cholesterol transport to signal transduction: low density lipoprotein receptor, very low density lipoprotein receptor, and apolipoprotein E receptor-2 | journal = Biochim.

Mutations of this gene may lead to a variety of symptoms and diseases, which include type I [[lissencephaly]], [[cerebellar hypoplasia]], and [[atherosclerosis]].

== Protein structure ==
VLDLR is a member of the [[low density lipoprotein receptor gene family|low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family]], which is entirely composed of type I [[transmembrane receptor|transmembrane]] [[lipoprotein]] receptors. [[File:Structure of LDL receptor family members.png|thumb | left | alt=A representation of the structural differences of the LDL receptor family. | The structural differences of the LDL receptor family. This image represents the similarities in structural domains among the members, as well as the extra cysteine repeat present on the VLDL receptor.]] All members of this family share five highly conserved structural domains: an extracellular N-terminal [[ligand]]-binding domain with cysteine-rich repeats (also called ligand-binding repeats), an [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), an [[O-linked glycosylation]] sugar domain, a single transmembrane sequence, and a cytoplasmic domain which contains an NPxY sequence. The NPxY motif functions in signal transduction and the targeting of receptors to coated pits and consists of the sequence Asparagine-Proline-X-Tyrosine, where X can be any amino acid.<ref name="Reddy_2011">{{cite journal | author = Reddy SS, Connor TE, Weeber EJ, Rebeck W | title = Similarities and differences in structure, expression, and functions of VLDLR and ApoER2 | journal = Mol Neurodegener | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 30 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21554715 | pmc = 3113299 | doi = 10.1186/1750-1326-6-30 }}</ref> Mimicking this general structure, VLDLR has eight, 40 amino acid long cysteine-rich repeats in its extracellular N-terminal ligand-binding domain.<ref name="Reddy_2011"/> This is the main difference from the main member of the LDL receptor family, [[low density lipoprotein receptor|LDLR]], which has only seven cysteine-rich repeats which are also 40 amino acids long.<ref name="Takahashi_2004">{{cite journal | author = Takahashi S, Sakai J, Fujino T, Hattori H, Zenimaru Y, Suzuki J, Miyamori I, Yamamoto TT | title = The very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor: characterization and functions as a peripheral lipoprotein receptor | journal = J.

=== Isoforms ===
The full-length human VLDLR genome is located on locus 9p24 on chromosome 9. It consists of a 40 kb segment that includes 19 [[exon]]-coding sequences, which is one more exon than encoded by [[low density lipoprotein receptor|LDLR]]. This extra exon in the ''VLDLR'' gene accounts for the extra cysteine-binding repeat not found in LDLR.<ref name="Takahashi_2004"/> Together, the exons making up the ''VLDLR'' gene encode a protein that is 873 amino acid residues long. VLDLR is known to exist as four different [[protein isoform]]s: type I, II, III, and IV. These different isoforms result from variations in [[alternative splicing]]. The transcript of type I VLDLR (VLDLR-I) is composed of all 19 exons. VLDLR-II, on the other hand, lacks exon 16, which encodes for the [[O-glycosylation]] domain between sugar regions. VLDLR-III lacks exon 4 that encodes the third [[ligand]]-binding repeat. Finally, VLDLR-IV transcripts lack both exon 16 and exon 4. It has been shown that 75% of VLDLR transcripts exist as isoform type II in mouse brain models. This shows that most VLDLRs in the brain are not glycosylated, as type II lacks exon 16 which encodes the O-glycosylation domain. Isoform type IV is known to be the second most prominent.<ref name="Reddy_2011"/>

=== Evolutionary conservation ===
There is a high level of conservation within the [[low density lipoprotein receptor gene family|LDL receptor family]]. In particular, there is 50% overall sequence [[homology]] between VLDLR and [[Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8|ApoER2]], another [[lipoprotein]] receptor of this family.<ref name="Reddy_2011"/> Comparing [[low density lipoprotein receptor|LDLR]] and VLDLR, it was found that their [[Biomolecular structure|primary structures]] are 55% identical within their [[ligand]]-binding regions. The modular structures of these two proteins are almost superimposable, with the only difference being the additional cysteine-rich repeat in VLDLR. This is demonstrated through the alignment of the two receptors according to their linker region; in LDLR, the linker region is located between cysteine-rich repeats four and five of its seven repeats while in VLDLR, the linker region appears to be between repeats five and six of its eight repeats.<ref name="Nimpf_Schneider_1998">{{cite journal | author = Nimpf J, Schneider WJ | title = The VLDL receptor: an LDL receptor relative with eight ligand binding repeats, LR8 | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 141 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–202 | year = 1998 | month = December | pmid = 9862168 | doi = | url = http://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(98)00172-5/abstract }}</ref>

VLDLR also shows high homology among various species. VLDLR of humans, mice, rats, and rabbits have been identified as 95% identical. Furthermore, there is approximately 84% conservation with the respective protein in chickens. This level of homology between species is much higher than that found for LDLR. Hence, these gene comparisons suggest that VLDLR and LDLR diverged before the LDLRs did among vertebrates.<ref name="Nimpf_Schneider_1998"/>

== Ligand binding ==
VLDLR binds compounds containing [[apolipoprotein E]] (apoE). These [[ligands]] attach to the cysteine binding repeats in the N-terminus end. The difference in cysteine-rich repeats between the members of the [[low density lipoprotein receptor gene family|LDL receptor family]] lead to the differences in binding affinity. VLDLR, in particular, binds [[VLDL]] and [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), but not [[low density lipoprotein|LDL]]. This inability to bind LDL is due to VLDLR's incapability to bind [[apolipoprotein B]] (apoB), which is present in LDL.<ref name= "GUPEA_2011">{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2077/27815 |title=GUPEA: Mechanisms for and consequences of cellular lipid accumulation - Role of the Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

=== Inhibitors ===
[[LDL-receptor-related_protein_associated_protein|Receptor-associated protein]] (RAP) and [[thrombospondin-1]] (THBS1) have been identified as compounds that bind VLDLR. In many cases, these compounds exhibit inhibitory effects. THBS1 binds VLDLR and blocks ligand binding.<ref name= "GUPEA_2011">{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2077/27815 |title=GUPEA: Mechanisms for and consequences of cellular lipid accumulation - Role of the Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> This plays an important role in the [[reelin]] pathway, as THBS1 can block the attachment of reelin, while simultaneously stimulating the [[transcription factors]] normally activated by reelin. This binding of THBS1, however, does not induce the subsequent degradation of these transcription factors, as reelin does, and can thus lead to greatly amplified effects.<ref name="Reddy_2011">{{cite journal | author = Reddy SS, Connor TE, Weeber EJ, Rebeck W | title = Similarities and differences in structure, expression, and functions of VLDLR and ApoER2 | journal = Mol Neurodegener | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 30 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21554715 | pmc = 3113299 | doi = 10.1186/1750-1326-6-30 }}</ref> The RAP protein acts similarly by blocking reelin from binding VLDLR.

== Tissue distribution and expression ==
VLDLR is found throughout the body, with particularly high expression in fatty acid tissues due to their high level of [[triglycerides]], VLDLR’s primary ligand. These tissues include those of the heart, skeletal muscle, and [[adipose tissue|adipose layer]]. In addition, the receptor is found in macrophages, endothelial cells of capillaries,<ref name="Go_Mani_2012">{{cite journal | author = Go GW, Mani A | title = Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family orchestrates cholesterol homeostasis | journal = Yale J Biol Med | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–28 | year = 2012 | month = March | pmid = 22461740 | pmc = 3313535 | doi = }}</ref> and in the brain, where it has a very different function from that found in the rest of the body. There is a preferred expression for VLDLR type I in the heart, skeletal muscle and brain, as opposed to type II, which is mainly expressed in non-muscular tissues including the [[cerebrum]], [[cerebellum]], kidney, spleen, and aortic endothelial cells.<ref name= "GUPEA_2011">{{Cite thesis | type = Ph.D. | chapter= | title = Mechanisms for and consequences of cellular lipid accumulation - Role of the Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2077/27815

Although VLDLR is found in almost all regions of the brain, its highest expression is restricted to the cortex and cerebellum. Here, the receptor can be found on resting or activated [[microglia]] that are associated with [[senile plaques]] and cortical neurons, [[neuroblast]]s, matrix cells, [[Cajal-Retzius cell]]s, [[glioblast]]s, [[astrocytes]], [[oligodendrocytes]], and region-specific [[pyramidal neurons]].<ref name="Reddy_2011">{{cite journal | author = Reddy SS, Connor TE, Weeber EJ, Rebeck W | title = Similarities and differences in structure, expression, and functions of VLDLR and ApoER2 | journal = Mol Neurodegener | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 30 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21554715 | pmc = 3113299 | doi = 10.1186/1750-1326-6-30 }}</ref> Despite its major role in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, VLDLR is not found in the liver.

=== Regulation ===
Unlike [[very low density lipoprotein receptor|LDLR]], VLDLR does not exhibit any feedback mechanism, and hence intracellular [[lipoproteins]] are incapable of regulating it. This phenomenon is due to a difference in the [[sterol]] regulatory element-1 (SRE-1)  of VLDLR. Normal SRE-1 sequences, like those found in LDLR, are characterized by two repeats of the codon CAC separated by two intervening C nucleotides (5’-CACCCCAC-3’). The [[sterol regulatory element-binding protein]]-1 (SREBP-1), a [[transcription factor]], targets the CAC repeats of SRE-1 to regulate the protein’s transcription. However, the ''VLDLR'' gene is encoded by two SRE-1-like sequences that contain [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]]. These polymorphisms disrupt the SREBP-1 binding to the CAC repeats, and hence eliminate the feedback mechanism seen in other proteins.<ref name="Takahashi_2004"/>

VLDLR expression is regulated by [[PPAR-gamma|peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma]] (PPAR-γ). A 2010 study showed that the prescription drug [[Pioglitazone]], an [[agonist]] of PPAR-γ, increases VLDLR mRNA expression and protein levels in experiments using mouse fibroblasts. The Pioglitazone treated mice exhibited a higher conversion rate of plasma [[triglycerides]] into epididymal fats. As expected, mice deficient in VLDLR did not show this same response.<ref name="Go_Mani_2012"/> These results suggest that VLDLR is important in fat accumulation.<ref name="Go_Mani_2012"/>

Many other hormones and dietary factors also regulate VLDLR expression. [[Thyroid hormone]] positively regulates VLDLR expression in skeletal muscles of rats, but not in adipose or heart tissues. In rabbits, VLDLR expression in heart muscle is up-regulated by estrogen and down-regulated by [[granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor]].  In [[trophoblast]]-derived cell lines, up-regulated VLDLR expression occurs when cells are incubated with [[hypolipidemic agent]]s such as [[insulin]] and [[clofibrate]]. In contrast, [[8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate]] (8-bromo-cAMP) down-regulates VLDLR expression. Finally, VLDLR is affected by the presence of [[apolipoprotein E|apoE]] and LDLR. The presence of apoE is required for VLDLR expression regulation, while the absence of LDLR alters the [[sterol]]-regulatory-element-1-like sequences of VLDLR to make them functional in only heart and skeletal muscle.<ref name="Takahashi_2004">{{cite journal | author = Takahashi S, Sakai J, Fujino T, Hattori H, Zenimaru Y, Suzuki J, Miyamori I, Yamamoto TT | title = The very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor: characterization and functions as a peripheral lipoprotein receptor | journal = J.

== Function ==

=== Beyond the nervous system ===
VLDLR is a peripheral [[lipoprotein]] receptor that functions in lipoprotein metabolism, cardiac [[fatty acid]] metabolism, and fat deposition. In effect, VLDLR will allow [[cholesterol]] to reach tissues from the bloodstream, where it may be used in cellular membranes. In addition, it will allow fatty acids to get into cells where they may be used as an energy source.<ref name="Takahashi_2004"/> Overall, VLDLR primarily modulates the extra-[[liver|hepatic]] metabolism of [[triglyceride]]-rich lipoproteins.<ref name="Go_Mani_2012"/>

==== Lipoprotein uptake ====
VLDLR only plays a discrete role in lipid metabolism, but is more significant in stressed situations. Mice with double [[Gene knockout|knockouts]] in ''VLDLR'' and ''[[low density lipoprotein receptor|LDLR]]'' have higher serum [[triglyceride]] levels than those with only a knockout in the ''LDLR'' gene. In addition, ''LDLR'' knockout mice overexpressing VLDLR have decreased serum triglyceride levels. Although fat deposition is close to normal without VLDLR, its role gains importance when LDLR is deficient. Despite this knowledge on its role in lipoprotein uptake, the complete mechanism of lipid metabolism performed by VLDLR is not fully understood.<ref name= "GUPEA_2011">{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2077/27815 |title=GUPEA: Mechanisms for and consequences of cellular lipid accumulation - Role of the Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===== Endocytosis =====
VLDLR is known to employ [[endocytosis]], although the exact mechanism of this process is unknown for this protein. Endocytosis is mediated through NPxY sequences known to signal for receptor internalization through [[receptor mediated endocytosis|clathrin-coated pits]]. The presence of this sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of VLDLR makes endocytosis possible.<ref name= "GUPEA_2011">{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2077/27815 |title=GUPEA: Mechanisms for and consequences of cellular lipid accumulation - Role of the Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> In general, [[lipoprotein]] receptors undergo a process by which they are endocytosed with their ligand into clathrin-coated pits. From here, they are together transported to early and late [[endosomes]] until reaching the [[lysosome]]. At this point, hydrolysis occurs and lipoprotein is released into the cytoplasm while the receptors are recycled back to the cell surface. It is not yet confirmed if VLDLR follows this exact mechanism, but one closely related to it is likely.<ref name="Go_Mani_2012"/>

=== In the nervous system ===
[[File:Reelin pathway in protection from Cerebral Malaria PMID 18062806.jpg|thumb | right | alt=A representation of the Reelin pathway. | The reelin pathway, representing VLDLR’s role in the process.]]
In addition to its role throughout the body, VLDLR has a very unique role in the brain. It is a key component of the [[reelin]] pathway, which functions in [[neuronal migration]]. VLDLR links the reelin protein to an intracellular signaling protein, [[DAB1|Dab1]], that tells the individual neurons where to go within the anatomy of the brain. Mutations in VLDLR often do not lead to major disorganization as seen in reelin mutations. However, a VLDLR mutation does lead to some disorganization primarily located in the [[cerebellum]], where VLDLR is believed to be most prominent.<ref name="Reddy_2011"/>

==== Neuronal migration ====
VLDLR is expressed on migrating neurons to help guide them to their proper location in the brain. This process is part of the [[reelin]] pathway, which is responsible for the inside-out formation of the six-layered [[neocortex]].<ref name="Reddy_2011"/> Despite the discovery of this pathway, many of the specifics and molecular mechanisms of this process are still being debated. The presence of two reelin receptors, VLDLR and [[Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8|ApoER2]], has made it difficult to distinguish each protein’s specific function.<ref name="pmid20053546">{{cite journal | author = Valiente M, Marín O | title = Neuronal migration mechanisms in development and disease | journal = Curr.

However, definitive evidence has not yet been found.<ref name="Reddy_2011"/> In general, reelin binds VLDLR and undergoes [[Receptor-mediated endocytosis|endocytosis]] via [[clathrin|clathrin-coated vesicles]].<ref name="Reddy_2011"/> Meanwhile, an intracellular protein, [[DAB1|Dab1]], has a [[Phosphotyrosine-binding domain|PI/PTB domain]] that interacts with the NPxY sequence found in the cytoplasmic tail of VLDLR.<ref name="NerveNet">{{cite journal |author=Rice DS, Curran T |title=Role of the reelin signaling pathway in central nervous system development |journal=Annu.

It is not yet known if Dab1 is phosphorylated as a result of the endocytosis of reelin, or if there is another mechanism at play.

Yet, much information on this process is still unknown.<ref name="Reddy_2011"/>

== Associated disorders ==
Mutations within the ''VLDLR'' gene lead to a multitude of disorders of varying severities. These disorders are usually associated with [[cholesterol]] [[homeostasis]] or a disorganization of neuron ordering in the brain due to disruption of the [[reelin]] pathway. The most prominent of these diseases are type I [[lissencephaly]], VLDR-associated [[cerebellar hypoplasia]], and [[atherosclerosis]]. In contrast to causing diseases,  VLDLR has also been identified as a possible remedy for some disorders. Implementation of VLDLR into the liver may cure [[familial hypercholesterolemia]] (FH) in patients who either have defective [[low density lipoprotein receptor|LDLR]] or have defective immune systems that attack this protein. Since VLDLR is non-immunogenic it does not initiate an immune response, thus it is able to function normally under defective immune systems.<ref name="Takahashi_2004"/> In addition, being that [[Apolipoprotein_E|apoE]], a major ligand of VLDLR, is a leading genetic risk factor for [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s disease]], VLDLR may play a role in modulating the risk of this disorder.<ref name="Reddy_2011"/> VLDLR has also been shown to reduce the chances of premature heart disease and stroke because VLDLR clears out [[Lipoprotein(a)|lipoprotein A]] (Lp(a)), a major inherited risk factor for these diseases.<ref name="Takahashi_2004"/>

=== Type 1 lissencephaly ===
Type I [[lissencephaly]], or agyria-pachygyria , is a rare developmental disorder characterized by the absence of [[Gyrus|gyri]] and [[Sulcus_(neuroanatomy)|sulci]] in the brain. These severe malformations are a result of aberrant [[neuronal migration]]. In classical type I lissencephaly, neuronal migration begins but is unable to continue to completion. This process is likely disrupted by alterations to several genes, including the ''VLDLR'', ''[[doublecortin|DCX]]'', ''[[aristaless related homeobox|ARX]]'', ''[[TUBA1A]]'', ''[[reelin|RELN]]'' and ''[[PAFAH1B1|LIS1]]''. The severity of type I lissencephaly therefore varies with the mutation type. A homozygous deletion affecting the ''VLDLR'' gene results in a low degree of cortical thickening and absence of a cell-sparse zone. The cell-sparse zone describes the region between the outer and inner cortical layers of arrested neurons.<ref name="pmid19120042">{{cite journal | author = Spalice A, Parisi P, Nicita F, Pizzardi G, Del Balzo F, Iannetti P | title = Neuronal migration disorders: clinical, neuroradiologic and genetics aspects | journal = Acta Paediatr. | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–33 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19120042 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.01160.x }}</ref> In addition, type 1 lissencephaly is closely associated with [[cerebellar hypoplasia]].

One such mutation is a [[cytosine]] to [[thymine]] transition at base pair 1342 in exon 10 that causes a substitution at [[Arginine|Arg]]448 for a [[termination signal]]. Likewise, there is evidence of a cytosine to thymine transition at base pair number 769 in exon 5 that causes a substitution at [[Arginine|Arg]]257 for a termination signal. A third known mutation is caused by a homozygous 1-base pair deletion in exon 17 that causes a [[Frameshift_mutation|frameshift]] and premature termination in the [[O-linked glycosylation|O-linked sugar]] domain.<ref name="OMIM_224050">{{OMIM|224050|Cerebellar Hypoplasia, VLDLR-Associated; VLDLRCH}}</ref> All such alterations to the ''VLDLR'' gene prevent the production of VLDLR and are therefore termed loss-of-function mutations. The recognized symptoms of VLDLRCH are moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, seizures, [[dysarthria]], [[strabismus]] and delayed locomotion. In some cases, children with VLDLRCH learn to walk very late in development after the age of six years old, or never learn to walk independently. The frequency of this disorder is unknown because early diagnosis of VLDLRCH is difficult using imaging techniques. It is associated with parental [[consanguinity]] and found in secluded communities such as the [[Hutterite]]s and inbred families from Iran and Turkey.<ref name="pmid20301729">{{cite book | author = Boycott KM, Parboosingh JS | editor = Pagon RA, Bird TD, Dolan CR, Stephens K, Adam MP  | title = GeneReviews [Internet] | chapter = VLDLR-Associated Cerebellar Hypoplasia | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2008 | pmid = 20301729 | doi = | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1874/ }}</ref>

=== Atherosclerosis ===
[[Atherosclerosis]] is marked by an excessive accumulation of [[cholesterol]] by [[macrophages]], leading to their transformation into [[foam cells]]. This accumulation of cholesterol is caused by dysregulation of cholesterol influx and efflux. Since macrophages do not have the ability to limit the influx of cholesterol, the balance is completely dependent on efflux pathways. VLDLR is expressed by macrophages, and functions in the uptake of native [[lipoproteins]]. Uniquely, VLDLR does not respond to cholesterol loading, likely due to its lack of feedback mechanisms. The inability to control its uptake of native lipoproteins makes VLDLR a pro-atherogenic factor.<ref name="Pennings_2006">{{cite journal | author = Pennings M, Meurs I, Ye D, Out R, Hoekstra M, Van Berkel TJ, Van Eck M | title = Regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in macrophages and consequences for atherosclerotic lesion development | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 580 | issue = 23 | pages = 5588–96 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16935283 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2006.08.022 | }}</ref> This characteristic is supported by results from a 2005 study, in which reintroduction of VLDLR into ''VLDLR'' knockout mice led to greatly increased atherosclerotic lesion development.<ref name="Pennings_2006"/>
