The '''QRS complex''' is a name for the combination of three of the graphical deflections seen on a typical [[electrocardiography|electrocardiogram (ECG)]]. It is usually the central and most visually obvious part of the tracing. It corresponds to the [[depolarization]] of the right and left [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] of the [[human heart]]. In adults, it normally lasts 0.06 - 0.10 s; in children and during physical activity, it may be shorter.

Typically an ECG has five deflections, arbitrarily named "P" to "T" waves. The Q, R, and S waves occur in rapid succession, do not all appear in all leads, and reflect a single event, and thus are usually considered together. A '''Q wave''' is any downward deflection after the [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P wave]]. An '''R wave''' follows as an upward deflection, and the '''S wave''' is any downward deflection after the R wave.  The [[T wave]] follows the S wave, and in some cases an additional [[U wave]] follows the T wave.

==Etiology==
The [[Bundle of His|His]]/[[Purkinje fibers|Purkinje]] specialized muscle cells coordinate the depolarization of both ventricles, and if they are working efficiently the QRS complex is 80 to 120 ms in duration (represented by three small squares or less at the standard paper speed of 25mm/s). Any abnormality of conduction takes longer and causes "widened" QRS complexes. In [[bundle branch block]] there can be an abnormal second upward deflection within the QRS complex, and in this case the second upward deflection is referred to as R' (pronounced "R prime"). This would be described as an RSR' pattern.

Ventricles contain more muscle mass than the atria; therefore the QRS complex is considerably larger than the P wave. The QRS complex is often used to determine the [[Electrocardiogram#Axis|axis]] of the electrocardiogram (although it is also possible to determine a separate P wave axis).

The duration, amplitude, and morphology of the QRS complex are useful in diagnosing [[cardiac arrhythmias]], [[conduction abnormalities]], [[ventricular hypertrophy]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[electrolyte derangement]]s, and other disease states.

The QRS complex is also included in estimating the [[QT interval]].

===Q wave===
Normal Q waves, when present, represent depolarization of the [[interventricular septum]]. For this reason, they are referred to as septal Q waves and can be appreciated in the lateral leads I, aVL, V5 and V6.

Pathologic Q waves occur when the electrical signal passes through stunned or scarred myocardium; as such, they are usually markers of previous myocardial infarcations, with subsequent fibrosis. A pathologic Q wave is defined as having a deflection amplitude of 25% or more of the subsequent R wave, or being > 0.04 s (40 ms) in width and > 2 mm in amplitude. However, diagnosis requires the presence of this pattern in more than one corresponding lead.

===R wave progression===
Looking at the precordial leads, the r wave usually progresses from showing a rS-type complex in V<sub>1</sub> with an increasing R and a decreasing S wave when moving towards the left side. There is usually an qR-type of complex in V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> with the R-wave amplitude usually taller in V<sub>5</sub> than in V<sub>6</sub>. It is normal to have a narrow QS and rSr' patterns in V<sub>1</sub>, and so is also the case for qRs and R patterns in V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub>. The ''transition zone'' is where the QRS complex changes from predominately negative to predominately positive (R/S ratio becoming >1), and this usually occurs at V<sub>3</sub> or V<sub>4</sub>. It is normal to have the transition zone at V<sub>2</sub> (called "early transition"), and at V<sub>5</sub> (called "delayed transition").<ref name=mackennzie2005>''Poor R-Wave Progression''.

The definition of ''poor R wave progression'' (PRWP) varies in the literature, but a common one is when the R wave is less than 2–4&nbsp;mm in leads V<sub>3</sub> or V<sub>4</sub> and/or there is presence of a reversed R wave progression, which is defined as R in V<sub>4</sub> < R in V<sub>3</sub> or R in V<sub>3</sub> < R in V<sub>2</sub> or R in V<sub>2</sub> < R in V<sub>1</sub>, or any combination of these.<ref name=mackennzie2005/> ''Poor R wave progression'' is commonly attributed to anterior [[myocardial infarction]], but it may also be caused by [[left bundle branch block]], [[Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome]], right and left [[ventricular hypertrophy]] as well as
by faulty ECG recording technique.<ref name=mackennzie2005/>

===J-point===
The point at which the QRS complex meets the [[ST segment]] is known as the J-point. The J-point is easy to identify when the ST segment is horizontal and forms a sharp angle with the last part of the QRS complex. However, when the ST segment is sloped or the QRS complex is wide, the two features do not form a sharp angle and the location of the J-point is less clear. There is no consensus on the precise location of the J-point in these circumstances.<ref name=Brownfield>{{cite journal|last=Brownfield|first=J|coauthors=Herbert, M|title=EKG Criteria for Fibrinolysis: What's Up with the J Point?|journal=The western journal of emergency medicine|date=2008 Jan|volume=9|issue=1|pages=40–2|pmid=19561701|accessdate=8 October 2011|pmc=2672223}}</ref> Two possible definitions are:
* The "first point of inflection of the upstroke of the S wave"<ref name=Brownfield />
*  The point at which the ECG trace becomes more horizontal than vertical.<ref>[http://www.monroecc.edu/depts/PSTC/backup/parasec1.htm#JPT PSTF Paramedic Student Electrocardiography]</ref>

===Monomorphic or polymorphic===
Monomorphic refers to all QRS waves in a single lead being similar in shape. Polymorphic means that the QRS change from complex to complex.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kenneth M Sutin; Marino, Paul L. |title=The ICU book |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages=356 |isbn=0-7817-4802-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> These terms are used in the description of [[ventricular tachycardia]].

==Terminology==
[[Image:QRS nomenclature.svg|thumb|Various QRS complexes with nomenclature.]]
Not every QRS complex contains a Q wave, an R wave, and an S wave. By convention, any combination of these waves can be referred to as a QRS complex. However, correct interpretation of difficult ECGs requires exact labeling of the various waves. Some authors use lowercase and capital letters, depending on the relative size of each wave. For example, an Rs complex would be positively deflected, while an rS complex would be negatively deflected. If both complexes were labeled RS, it would be impossible to appreciate this distinction without viewing the actual ECG.

==Algorithms==
A common algorithm used for QRS complex detection is the [[Pan-Tompkins]]<ref>{{doi| 10.1109/TBME.1985.325532}}</ref> algorithm (or method); another is based on the [[Hilbert transform]].<ref name="SobhElleithy2010">{{cite book|author1=Tarek Sobh|author2=Khaled Elleithy|title=Innovations in Computing Sciences and Software Engineering|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IQ8h_d5rR0MC&pg=PA462|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-9111-6|page=462}}</ref><ref name="LimHong2009">{{cite book|author1=Chwee Teck Lim|author2=James Goh Cho Hong|title=13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering: ICBME 2008, 3-6 December 2008, Singapore|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bzxZkEcLo1kC&pg=PA469|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-92840-9|page=469}}</ref><ref name="ChaudhuriPawar2009">{{cite book|author1=Subhasis Chaudhuri|author2=Tanmay D.
