The '''Oxford Vaccine Group''' (OVG) is a [[clinical trials unit]] in the Department of Paediatrics at the [[University of Oxford]]. It was founded in 1994 by Professor Richard Moxon, was initially based at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], and moved in 2003 to its current location in the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (CCVTM) at the [[Churchill Hospital]] in [[Oxford]], [[England]].<ref>[http://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/about-us Oxford Vaccine Group website]</ref> The group, led by Professor Andrew Pollard since 2001, comprises around 75 members across a number of disciplines, including consultants in paediatrics and vaccinology, clinical research fellows, research nurses, statisticians, post-doctoral laboratory scientists, research assistants and DPhil students.

== Aims ==
According to its website, OVG "works towards the goal of developing new and improved vaccines for the prevention of infection in adults and children, enhancing the understanding of immunity and studying the epidemiology of infectious diseases".

== Research activity ==
OVG conducts a significant number of clinical trials on new and improved vaccines. Since 2001, it has enrolled 11,000 adults and children into clinical trials in the Thames Valley area.<ref>[http://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/OVG/research/ Oxford Vaccine Group website]</ref> Recent OVG research includes:

== Vaccine Knowledge Project ==
In 2011, the group launched the Vaccine Knowledge Project, funded by the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. This project aims to disseminate information and provoke debate about vaccines and infectious diseases, primarily through its website and openminds blog.<ref>[http://www.vaccine-knowledge.info Vaccine Knowledge homepage]</ref>
