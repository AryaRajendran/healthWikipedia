'''Aplastic anemia''' is a disease in which the bone marrow, and the blood stem cells that reside there, are damaged. This causes a deficiency of all three blood cell types: red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells (leukopenia), and platelets (thrombocytopenia).<ref name="Harrison's"/><ref name="Merck"/>

It occurs most commonly in the teens and twenties, and also among the elderly. It can be caused by exposure to chemicals, drugs, radiation, infection, immune disease, and heredity; in about half the cases, the cause is unknown.<ref name="Harrison's"/><ref name="Merck"/>

The definitive diagnosis is by bone marrow biopsy; normal bone marrow has 30-70% blood stem cells, but in aplastic anemia, these cells are mostly gone and replaced by fat.<ref name="Harrison's"/><ref name="Merck"/>

Aplastic anemia is treated with immunosuppressive drugs, typically either anti-lymphocyte globulin or anti-thymocyte globulin, combined with corticosteroids and cyclosporine, with a response rate of about 70%; this indicates that aplastic anemia has an auto-immune component. Stem cell transplant is also used, especially for patients <30 years.<ref name="Harrison's">{{cite book|author=Kasper, Dennis L; Braunwald, Eugene; Fauci, Anthony; et al.|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th ed.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2005|pages= |isbn=978-0-07-140235-4}}</ref><ref name="Merck">[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/hematology_and_oncology/anemias_caused_by_deficient_erythropoiesis/aplastic_anemia.html Merck Manual, Professional Edition], Aplastic Anemia (Hypoplastic Anemia)</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
* [[Anemia]] with [[malaise]], [[pallor]] and associated symptoms such as palpitations
* [[Thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet counts), leading to increased risk of [[hemorrhage]], [[bruising]] and [[petechiae]]
* [[Leukopenia]] (low white blood cell count), leading to increased risk of [[infection]]
* [[Reticulocytopenia]] (low counts of [[reticulocyte]]s, that is, immature red blood cells)

==Causes==
Aplastic anemia can be caused by exposure to chemicals, drugs, radiation, infection, immune disease, and heredity; in about half the cases, the cause is unknown.<ref name="Harrison's"/><ref name="Merck"/>

Aplastic anemia is also sometimes associated with exposure to toxins such as [[benzene]], or with the use of certain drugs, including [[chloramphenicol]], [[carbamazepine]], [[felbamate]], [[phenytoin]], [[quinine]], and [[phenylbutazone]]. Many drugs are associated with aplasia mainly according to case reports, but at a very low probability. As an example, chloramphenicol treatment is followed by aplasia in less than one in 40,000 treatment courses, and carbamazepine aplasia is even more rare.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] from [[radioactive materials]] or radiation-producing devices is also associated with the development of aplastic anemia. [[Marie Curie]], famous for her pioneering work in the field of [[radioactivity]], died of aplastic anemia after working unprotected with radioactive materials for a long period of time; the damaging effects of ionizing radiation were not then known.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Aplastic anemia is present in up to 2% of patients with acute [[viral hepatitis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=edited by Parveen Kumar, Michael|title=Kumar & Clark's clinical medicine|year=2009|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7020-2992-9|edition=7th|date=July 2011}}</ref>

One known cause is an [[autoimmune disorder]] in which white blood cells attack the bone marrow.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Short-lived aplastic anemia can also be a result of [[parvovirus]] infection. In humans, the P antigen (also known as globoside) is the cellular receptor for parvovirus B19 virus that causes [[erythema infectiosum]] (fifth disease) in children. Parvovirus causes complete cessation of red blood cell production. In most cases, this goes unnoticed, as red blood cells live on average 120 days, and the drop in production does not significantly affect the total number of circulating red blood cells. In people with conditions where the cells die early (such as [[sickle cell disease]]), however, parvovirus infection can lead to severe anemia.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In some [[animals]], aplastic anemia may have other causes. For example, in the [[ferret]] (''Mustela putorius furo''), it is caused by [[estrogen]] toxicity, because female ferrets are [[Estrous cycle|induced ovulator]]s, so mating is required to bring the female out of heat. Intact females, if not mated, will remain in heat, and after some time the high levels of estrogen will cause the bone marrow to stop producing red blood cells.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Diagnosis==
The condition needs to be differentiated from pure red cell aplasia. In aplastic anemia, the patient has pancytopenia (i.e., anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) resulting in decrease of all formed elements. In contrast, pure red cell aplasia is characterized by reduction in red cells only. The diagnosis can only be confirmed on [[bone marrow examination]]. Before this procedure is undertaken, a patient will generally have had other [[blood test]]s to find diagnostic clues, including a [[complete blood count]], [[renal function]] and [[electrolyte]]s, [[liver enzyme]]s, [[thyroid]] function tests, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] and [[folic acid]] levels.

The following tests aid in determining differential diagnosis for aplastic anemia:
#  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy: to rule out other causes of pancytopenia (i.e. neoplastic infiltration or significant myelofibrosis).
#  History of iatrogenic exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy: can cause transient bone marrow suppression
#  X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or ultrasound imaging tests: enlarged lymph nodes (sign of lymphoma), kidneys and bones in arms and hands (abnormal in Fanconi anemia)
#  Chest X-ray: infections
#  Liver tests: liver diseases
#  Viral studies: viral infections
#  Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folate levels: vitamin deficiency
#  Blood tests for [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]]
#  Test for antibodies: immune competency

==Treatment==
Treating immune-mediated aplastic anemia involves suppression of the [[immune system]], an effect achieved by daily [[medicine]] intake, or, in more severe cases, a [[bone marrow transplant]], a potential cure.<ref name="pmid17229630">{{cite journal |author=Locasciulli A, Oneto R, Bacigalupo A, ''et al.'' |title=Outcome of patients with acquired aplastic anemia given first line bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppressive treatment in the last decade: a report from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) |journal=Haematologica |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=11–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17229630|doi=10.3324/haematol.10075}}</ref> The transplanted bone marrow replaces the failing bone marrow cells with new ones from a matching donor. The [[multipotency|multipotent]] stem cells in the bone marrow reconstitute all three blood cell lines, giving the patient a new immune system, red blood cells, and platelets. However, besides the risk of graft failure, there is also a risk that the newly created white blood cells may attack the rest of the body ("[[graft-versus-host disease]]").

Medical therapy of aplastic anemia often includes a short course of [[antithymocyte globulin]] (ATG) or [[anti-lymphocyte globulin|antilymphocyte globulin]] (ALG) and several months of treatment with a [[cyclosporin]] to modulate the [[immune system]]. Mild [[chemotherapy]] with agents such as [[cyclophosphamide]] and [[vincristine]] may also be effective. [[Antibody]] therapy, such as ATG, targets T-cells, which are believed to attack the bone marrow. [[Steroids]] are generally ineffective,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} though are often used to combat [[serum sickness]] caused by ATG use.

One prospective study involving cyclophosphamide was terminated early due to a high incidence of mortality, due to severe infections as a result of prolonged [[neutropenia]].<ref name="pmid12393567">{{cite journal |author=Tisdale JF, Maciejewski JP, Nunez O, ''et al.'' |title=Late complications following treatment for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) with high-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy): follow-up of a randomized trial |journal=Blood |volume=100 |pages=4668–4670 |year=2002 |pmid=12393567 |issue=13 |doi=10.1182/blood-2002-02-0494}}</ref>

In the past, before the above treatments became available, patients with low leukocyte counts were often confined to a sterile room or bubble (to reduce risk of [[infections]]), as in the case of [[Ted DeVita]].<ref name="titleNIH Clinical Center: Clinical Center News, NIH Clinical Center">{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/about/news/newsletter/2004/aug04/index.shtml |title=NIH Clinical Center: Clinical Center News, NIH Clinical Center |accessdate=2007-12-04 |work=}}</ref>

===Follow-up===
Regular [[full blood count]]s are required to determine whether the patient is still in a state of remission.

From 10 to 33% of all patients develop the [[rare disease]] [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] (PNH, anemia with thrombopenia and/or [[thrombosis]]), which has been explained as an escape mechanism by the bone marrow against destruction by the immune system. [[Flow cytometry]] testing is performed regularly in people with previous aplastic anemia to monitor for the development of PNH.

==Prognosis==
Untreated, severe aplastic anemia has a high risk of death. Treatment, by drugs or stem cell transplant, has a 5-year survival of about 70%, with younger age associated with higher survival.

Survival rates for stem cell transplant vary depending on age and availability of a well-matched donor. Five year survival rates for patients who receive transplants has been shown to be 82% for patients underneath the age of 20, 72% for those 20–40 years of age and closer to 50% for patients over the age of 40. Success rates are better for patients who have donors that are matched siblings and worse for patients who receive their marrow from unrelated donors.<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=Scheinberg, Philip and Young, Neil S|title=How I treat acquired aplastic Anemia|journal=Blood|date=April 19, 2012|volume =120

Older people (who are generally too frail to undergo bone marrow transplants) and people who are unable to find a good bone marrow match, who undergo immune suppression have [[five year survival rate]]s of up to 75%.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Relapses are common. Relapse following ATG/cyclosporin use can sometimes be treated with a repeated course of therapy. In addition, 10-15% of severe aplastic anemia cases evolve into MDS and leukemia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Milder disease can resolve on its own.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
