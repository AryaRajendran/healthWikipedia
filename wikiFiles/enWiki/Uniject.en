'''Uniject''' is a disposable, pre-filled, single-use [[syringe]] which was developed to promote vaccination in developing countries.  It was developed by [[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health|PATH]] as part of the solution to the problem of delivering vaccines to areas which have insufficient medical workers to meet the needs of traditional, doctor-mediated vaccination programs.

==History==
The Uniject was invented by PATH in 1987.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.path.org/files/TS_hthp_uniject.pdf |title=A HealthTech Historical Profile - The Uniject Device |author= |date=June 2005 |work=path.org |publisher=[[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health]] |id=PATH identifier mfvp24049 |accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref>

In 2003 PATH accepted a [[The Tech Awards|Tech Award]] from [[The Tech Museum of Innovation]] for its development of the Uniject.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.techawards.org/laureates/stories/index.php?id=73 |title=The Tech Museum Awards - Technology Benefiting Humanity |first= |last= |work=techawards.org |publisher=[[The Tech Museum of Innovation]]|year=2003 |accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref>

==Use==
The introduction of the Uniject has been called the single greatest leap forward in the battle against tetanus because it has allowed tetanus vaccines to be used in places which were previously inaccessible to health programs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/24/1056449244520.html |title=
