'''Eosinophilia''' is a condition in which the [[eosinophil]] count in the [[peripheral blood]] exceeds 0.45×10<sup>9</sup>/L&nbsp;(450/μl). Eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/print/blood_disorders/white_blood_cell_disorders/eosinophilic_disorders.html | title=Eosinophilic Disorders | publisher=Merck & Co. | accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia.<ref name="Simon" /> Several causes are known, with the most common being some form of [[allergic reaction]] or [[parasitosis]]. Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a [[complete blood count]] (CBC), but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia.<ref name="Merck" /> The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic, in which the factor lies outside of the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia, which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line.<ref name="Simon" />  Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition, though in idiopathic eosinophilia, the disease may be controlled with [[corticosteroids]].<ref name="Merck">{{cite book|last1=Beers|first1=Mark|last2=Porter|first2=Robert|last3=Jones|first3=Thomas|title=The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/index.html|edition=18|year=2006|publisher=Merck Research Laboratories|location=Whitehouse Station, New Jersey|isbn=0-911910-18-2|pages=1093-1096|chapter=11}}</ref> Eosinophilia is not a disorder, unless it is idiopathic.<ref name="Merck" />

==Harm==
{{Expand section|date=April 2013}}
Harm resulting from untreated Eosinophilia potentially varies with cause.  

==Causes==
Eosinophilia can be [[idiopathic]] (primary) or, more commonly, secondary to another disease.<ref name="Merck" /><ref name="Simon" /> In the Western World, allergic or [[atopic]] diseases are the most common causes, especially those of the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] or [[integumentary system|integumentary]] systems. In the developing world, [[parasitic disease|parasites]] are the most common cause. A parasitic infection of nearly any bodily [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] can cause eosinophilia.
Diseases that feature eosinophilia as a sign include the following:

===Neoplastic eosinophilia===
[[Hodgkin lymphoma]] (Hodgkin’s disease) often elicits severe eosinophilia; however, [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] and [[leukemia]] produce less marked eosinophilia.<ref name="Merck"/> Of solid tumor [[Cancer|neoplasms]], [[ovarian cancer]] is most likely to provoke eosinophilia, though any other cancer can cause the condition.<ref name="Merck"/> Solid epithelial cell tumors have been shown to cause both tissue and blood eosinophilia, with some reports indicating that this may be mediated by [[interleukin]] production by tumor cells, especially IL-5 or IL-3.<ref name="Simon" /> This has also been shown to occur in Hodgkin lymphoma, in the form of IL-5 secreted by Reed-Sternberg cells.<ref name="Simon" /> In primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, blood and dermal eosinophilia are often seen. Lymphoma cells have also been shown to produce IL-5 in these disorders. Other types of lymphoid malignancies have been associated with eosinophilia, as in lymphoblastic leukemia with a translocation between chromosomes 5 and 14.<ref name="Simon" /> Patients displaying eosinophilia overexpress a gene encoding an eosinophil hematopoietin. A translocation between chromosomes 5 and 14 in patients with acute B lymphocytic leukemia resulted in the juxtaposition of the IL-3 gene and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, causing overproduction production of IL-3, leading to blood and tissue eosinophilia.<ref name="Simon" />

===Drug reactions===

Drug hypersensitivity reactions (allergies) are a common cause of eosinophilia, with manifestations ranging from diffuse [[maculopapular rash]], to severe life-threatening [[DRESS_syndrome|drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms]] (DRESS).<ref name="Simon" /> Drugs that have been shown to cause DRESS are [[aromatic anticonvulsants]] and other [[antiepileptics]], [[sulfonamides]], [[allopurinol]], [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs), some antipsycotics such as Risperidone, and certain antibiotics. Phenibut, an analogue of the neurotransmitter GABA, has also been implicated in high doses. The reaction which has been shown to be T-cell mediated may also cause [[eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome]].<ref name="Simon" />

==Pathophysiology==
IgE mediated eosinophil production is induced by compounds released by [[basophils]] and [[mast cells]], including eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, [[leukotriene B4]], complement complex (C5-C6-C7), [[interleukin 5]], and histamine (though this has a narrow range of concentration).<ref name="Merck"/>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by [[complete blood count]] (CBC). However, in some cases, a more accurate absolute eosinophil count may be needed.<ref name="Merck" /> Medical history is taken, with emphasis on travel, allergies and drug use.<ref name="Merck" /> Specific test for causative conditions are performed, often including [[chest x-ray]], [[urinalysis]], [[liver function test|liver]] and [[renal function|kidney]] function tests, and serologic tests for parasitic and connective tissue diseases. The stool is often examined for traces of parasites (i.e. eggs, larvae, etc.) though a negative test does not rule out parasitic infection; for example, [[trichinosis]] requires a [[muscle biopsy]].<ref name="Merck" /> Elevated serum B<sub>12</sub> or low white blood cell [[alkaline phosphatase]], or leukocytic abnormalities in a peripheral smear indicates a disorder of [[hematopoesis|myleoproliferation]].<ref name="Merck" /> In cases of idiopathic eosinophilia, the patient is followed for complications. A brief trial of [[corticosteroids]] can be diagnostic for allergic causes, as the eosinophilia should resolve with suppression of the immune over-response.<ref name="Merck" /> Neoplastic disorders are diagnosed through the usual methods, such as [[bone marrow aspiration]] and biopsy for the leukemias, MRI/CT to look for solid tumors, and tests for serum LDH and other [[tumor markers]].<ref name="Merck" />

==Treatment==
Treatment is directed toward the underlying cause.<ref name="Merck"/> However, in primary eosinophilia, or if the eosinophil count must be lowered, [[corticosteroids]] such as [[prednisone]] may be used. However, immune suppression, the mechanism of action of corticosteroids, can be fatal in patients with parasitosis.<ref name="Simon">{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Dagmar|coauthors=HU Simon|date=16 January 2007|title=Eosinophilic Disorders|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=119|issue=6|pages=1291–300; quiz 1301–2|publisher=Elsevier|location=New York|pmid=17399779|url=http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(07)00377-6/fulltext|accessdate=21 October 2010|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2007.02.010}}</ref>
