A '''needlestick injury''' is a [[percutaneous]] piercing wound typically set by a needle point, but possibly also by other sharp instruments or objects. Commonly encountered by people handling needles in the medical setting, such injuries are an [[occupational hazard]] in the medical community. Occupational needlestick injuries are mainly focused on the healthcare environment, but law enforcement is at particularly high risk for incidental needlesticks, though this population is commonly overlooked.  These events are of concern because of the risk to transmit [[blood-borne disease]]s through the passage of the [[hepatitis B]] virus (HBV), the [[hepatitis C]] virus (HCV), and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ([[HIV]]), the virus that causes [[AIDS]]. 

Despite their seriousness as a medical event, needlestick injuries have been neglected:  most go unreported and ICD-10 coding is not available.<ref name=muelder/> On the other hand, as needlesticks have been recognized as occupational hazards, their prevention has become the subject of regulations in an effort to reduce and eliminate this preventable event.<ref name=pruess/>

==Event==
Needlestick injuries are a common event in the healthcare environment. When drawing blood, administering an intramuscular or intravenous drug, or performing other procedures involving sharps, the [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] can slip and injure the healthcare worker. This sets the stage to transmit viruses from the source person to the recipient. These injuries also commonly occur during needle recapping and as a result of failure to place used needles in approved [[sharps container]]s. During surgery, a surgical needle may inadvertendly penetrate the glove and skin of the surgeon or assistant. Penetrating accidents of the surgeon or assistant with the [[scalpel]] or other sharp instruments are also handled as a needlestick injury. Generally needlestick injuries cause only minor bleeding or visible trauma, however, even in the absence of bleeding the risk of viral infection remains. Scalpel injuries tend to be larger than a needlestick. In turn, a needlestick injury may also pose a risk for a patient if the injured health professional carries HBV, HCV or HIV. Needlestick injuries are not limited to the medical community. Any environment where sharps are encountered poses a risk.

Needlestick injuries are less frequent, yet still a serious concern among law enforcement.  Eight million self-injectors generate up to three billion sharps outside formal healthcare settings in the United States every year. One-third of these sharps are produced by injection drug users of heroin, cocaine, and other illicit drugs. <ref>{{cite web|last=Gebhart|first=Fred|title=EPA issues new guidelines for sharps disposal|url=http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drugtopics/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=109802|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref> 

Risk in law enforcement occurs for many reasons including: 
-Arrestee does not declare possession
-Drop/throw needles in fear of arrest
-Pat downs/searches during arrest
-Used as weapons against arresting officers

==Frequency==
The frequency of such events has been estimated to be about 800,000 cases in the USA alone (1999 report).<ref>Exposure prevention information network data reports. University of Virginia: International Health Care Worker Safety Center. EPINet (1999)</ref>) Another investigation estimates the rates of injuries on a global level to affect about 3.5 million individuals.<ref name=pruess>{{cite journal | pmid = 16299710 | doi=10.1002/ajim.20230 | volume=48 | issue=6 | title=Estimation of the global burden of disease attributable to contaminated sharps injuries among health-care workers | year=2005 | month=December | author=Pr&uuml;ss-Ust&uuml;n A, Rapiti E, Hutin Y | journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine | pages=482–90}}</ref> Among healthcare workers nurses and physicians appear especially at risk;<ref name=chalupa/> an investigation among American surgeons indicates that almost every surgeon experienced at least one such injury during their training.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17596603 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa070378 | volume=356 | issue=26 | title=Needlestick injuries among surgeons in training | year=2007 | month=June | author=Makary MA, Al-Attar A, Holzmueller CG, ''et al.'' | journal=N.

Needlestick injuries may occur not only with freshly contaminated sharps, but also, after some time, with needles that carry dry blood. While the infectiousness of HIV and HCV decrease within a couple of hours, HBV remains stable during desiccation and infectious for more than a week.<ref name=sarrazin/>

Needlestick injuries are of significant concern to police workers. In San Diego 30% of police workers reported such injuries typically when searching suspects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=J Lorentz, Hill L, Samimi B|title= Occupational needlestick injuries in a metropolitan police force |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | pmid=10698245 |year=2000 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=146–50 }}</ref>

A study of 1,333 police officers in the Denver Police Department found that only 43.4% of those exposed, reported their injuries. 42% of respondents indicated they were on second duty shift (evenings) when they were injured. Additionally, nearly two-thirds who experienced needlesticks indicated it was during their first five years of experience <ref>{{cite journal |author=J Lorentz, Hill L, Samimi B|title= Occupational needlestick injuries in a metropolitan police force |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | pmid=10698245 |year=2000 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=146–50 }}</ref>

A law enforcement study in New York City Police Department identified 38.7 exposures per 10,000 police officers (includes bites & sticks), while Patrol & Narcotics officers had a 43.6/10,000 exposure rate. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pagane|first=J|coauthors=Chanmugam, Kirsch, Kelen|title=New York City Police officers incidence of transcutaneous exposures|journal=Occupational Medicine|year=1996|volume=46|issue=4|pages=285–288|url=occmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/4/285.full.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref>


==Risk==
While needlestick injuries have the potential of transferring bacteria, protozoa, viruses and prions,<ref name=muelder/> from a practical point the transmission of the [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]] viruses and the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) is important. It is estimated that annually as a consequence there are 66,000 infections with HBV, 16,000 with HCV, and 1,000 with HIV worldwide.<ref name=pruess/> In addition, a needlestick injury may lead to significant stress and anxiety for the affected injured person. Taking care of a needlestick injury is costly, estimated to be about $2,500 in the short term in the US.<ref name=chalupa/>

Hepatitis B carries the greatest risk of transmission, with 37 to 62% of exposed workers eventually showing seroconversion and 22 to 31% showing clinical Hepatitis B infection.<ref name = cdc1>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Updated US Public Health Service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis.</ref><ref>B.G.

Bell, Occupational risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection in healthcare workers: an overview. Am J Med 102 Suppl 5B (1997), pp. 9–15.</ref>

The specific risk of a single injury depends on a number of factors when the patients harbor the virus of concern. Injuries with a hollow-bore needle, deep penetration, visible blood on the needle, a needle that was located in a deep artery or vein, or with blood from terminally ill patients are known to increase the risk for HIV infection.<ref name=cdc2005>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5409.pdf CDC Guidelines (re HIV) 2005] Retrieved 2009-06-01</ref><ref>D.M.

N Engl J Med 337 (1997), pp. 1485–1490.</ref>

Estimates of the risk of a single injury indicate a risk of 300 HBV infections (30% risk), 30 HCV infection (3% risk) and 3 HIV infections (0.3% risk) per 1,000 respective exposures.<ref name=sarrazin>{{cite journal| author=Sarrazin U, Brodt HR, Sarrazin C, Zeuzem S |url=http://www.aerzteblatt.de/v4/archiv/artikel.asp?id=48030 |title=Prophylaxe gegenüber HBV, HCV und HIV nach beruflicher Exposition |journal=Dtsch Arztebl |year=2005 |volume=102 | pages=2234–2239 |language=German|accessdate=2009-05-30}}</ref> 

While the vast majority of needlestick injuries occur when the source-person does not carry the HBV, HCV, and HIV and thus do not carry a risk of infection, these events nevertheless cause stress and anxiety and signal a breakdown in protocol and prevention.

==Prevention==
[[File:DrawingBloodUnitedStatesVacutainer.jpg|thumb|Blood being drawn with a [[Vacutainer]]. A protective cap (pink) protects the needle after it is removed.]]
Preventive steps can be taken at several levels and include reduction or elimination of use of sharps as much as possible, engineering controls (''i.e.'', needles or [[Safety syringe|syringes]] with safety devices), administrative controls including training and provision of adequate resources, and work practice controls; the latter may include using instruments (not fingers) to grasp needles, load scalpels, and avoiding hand-to-hand passing of sharp instruments also preparing of medications especially removing cap. Removing cap from a needle generally causes needle stick injury.  There are several ways to remove the cap from the needle but the most ideal and safest way to remove the cap is by carefully grasping the syringe and guiding the needle cap using the thumb and the pointing finger.  Then gently push the cap away from the syringe to detach the cap from the hub.  In this way needle stick injury can be prevented by avoiding the incidence of the rebound effect.  Do not use the other hand as it increases the likeliness to have the syringe to rebound.

The adherence to "no-touch" protocols that eliminate direct contact with needles in their use and disposal greatly reduce the risk of injury. In the surgical setting blunt-tip suture needles are able to reduce needlestick injuries.<ref name=blunt>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2008-101/ Use of Blunt-Tip Suture Needles to Decrease Percutaneous Injuries to Surgical Personnel: Safety and Health Information Bulletin]. Retrieved 2008-9-12.</ref>  The [[American College of Surgeons]] (ACS) has endorsed the adoption of blunt-tip suture needles for suturing [[fascia]].<ref name=blunt/>

Some countries have enacted legislation to protect healthcare workers. In the US, the ''Needlestick Safety Act'' was signed in 2000 and ''Bloodborne Pathogens Standard'' in 2001. These regulations mandate the use of safety devices and needle-removers with any sharps or needles.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jagger, J., De Carli, G., Perry, J., Puro, V., Ippolito, G. |title=Chapter 31: Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens: Epidemiology and Prevention.

==Syringe Exchange Programs==
[[Syringe Exchange Programs]] (SEPs), also known as needle exchanges or Syringe Access Programs (SAPs), are an effective way of decreasing the risk associated with needlestick injuries. Although SEPs may not reduce the prevalence of needlesticks, the risk of exposure to blood borne pathogens is reduced. SEPs provide benefits for many parties involved. Injection Drug Users (IDUs) are a very difficult population to reach, and SEPs act as a gateway for users to other resources and provide clean needles while collecting dirty sharps.  These programs keep dirty syringes off the street, and in return stop the spread of disease.  SEPs also benefit law enforcement through reducing risk of exposure to disease.  A study in Hartford, CT looked at syringe access and law enforcement needlestick injuries before and after laws regarding needlestick access were implemented.  A study found that needlestick injury rates among Hartford police officers were lower after the new laws (six injuries in 1,007 drug-related arrests for 6-month period before new laws vs. two in 1,032 arrests for 6-month period after new laws).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Groseclose|coauthors=Weinstein, Jones, Valleroy, Fehrs, Kassler|title=Impact of increased legal access to needles and syringes practices of injecting-drug users and police officers|journal=CDC: J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol|year=1995|month=Sept|volume=10|issue=1|pages=82–9|pmid=7648290|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7648290}}</ref>  

==Management==
After a needlestick injury, certain procedures must be followed to minimize the risk of infection for the recipient. The affected area should be rinsed and washed thoroughly with soap and water; the practice to "milk out" more blood is controversial and not recommended by the CDC.<ref name=muelder/> Lab tests of the recipient are obtained for baseline studies: HIV, acute hepatitis panel (HAV IgM, HBsAg, HB core IgM, HCV) and for immunized individuals HB surface antibody.<ref name=klein>{{cite book| author=Klein SM, Foltin J, Gomella LG |title=Emergency Medicine on Call| page=288 |isbn=0-07-138879-6| mcgraw=Hill Professional (2003)| year=2003| publisher=McGraw-Hill| location=New York}}</ref> Unless already known, the infectious status of the source needs to be determined by checking for HBsAG, anti-HCV, and HIV antibody.<ref name=klein/> Unless the source is known to be negative for HBV, HCV, and HIV [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] (PEP) should be initiated, ideally within one hour of the injury;<ref name=diprose/> typically this is done in the [[emergency department]] or the occupational health office. Guidelines for PEP have been updated over recent years in view of the introduction of new drugs, and protocols may differ somewhat between countries.

===Hepatitis B prophylaxis===
Current CDC guidelines call for the administration of [[hepatitis B immune globulin]] (HBIG) and/or [[hepatitis B vaccine]]. While the efficacy of the combination has not been evaluated in the needlestick injury setting, it has been shown to be the most efficacious approach in the perinatal setting. The approach has no contraindications during pregnancy and lactation.<ref name=cdc2001>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5011.pdf CDC Guidelines (re HBV and HCV) 2001] Retrieved 2009-06-01.</ref>

===Hepatitis C prophylaxis===
CDC guidelines acknowledge that there is no active PEP for HCV, only recommendations intended to achieve early identification of chronic disease and, when detected, referral for evaluation of treatment options. According to the CDC identification of acute infection with HCV may not necessitate active intervention.<ref name=cdc2001/> However, there is some evidence that treatment with [[interferon]] alfa-2b may be beneficial preventing chronic hepatitis.<ref name=Jaeckel>{{cite journal | author = Jaeckel E, Cornberg M, Wedemeyer H, Santantonio T, Mayer J, Zankel M, Pastore G, Dietrich M, Trautwein C, Manns MP | title = Treatment of acute hepatitis C with interferon alfa-2b | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | year = 2001 | month = November | volume = 345 | issue = 20 | pages = 1452–1457 | pmid = 11794193  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa011232}}</ref>

===HIV prophylaxis===
CDC guidelines generally recommend a PEP protocol with 3 or more antiviral drugs, when it is known that the donor was HIV positive; however, when the viral load was low and none of the above noted risk factors are met, the CDC protocol utilizes 2 antiviral drugs. Such a 2 drug protocol should also be considered when the donor status cannot be determined (e.g. injury by a random needle in a used sharps container), but there is an increased risk that the source was from a risk group for HIV.<ref name=cdc2005/> PEP drugs for prevention of HIV infection are given for 4 weeks and may include nucleoside [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs), nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s (PIs), and a single [[fusion inhibitor]]. PEP anti-HIV regimens are accompanied by significant [[Adverse effect|side effect]]s and their utilization is not indicated when there is evidence that HIV transmission is not involved; also, initiated protocols can be stopped when data appear indicating that the source-person is HIV-negative. Regardless whether PEP is instituted, follow-up of exposed individuals includes counseling and HIV testing by enzyme immunoassay to monitor for a possible seroconversion for at least 6 months after exposure. Such tests are done at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months, and longer in specific circumstances, such as co-infection with HCV.

==Surveillance==
Surveillance systems have been to track sharps injuries and the progress that is achieved in their elimination. In the US there are two voluntary national surveillance systems for tracking sharps injuries: The National Surveillance System for Health care Workers (NaSH) of the CDC<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/nash.html NaSH] Retrieved 2009-06-01</ref>
and EpiNet of the International Halth Care Worker safety center at the University of Virginia.<ref>[http://www.med.virginia.edu/epinet EpiNet] Retrieved 2009-06-01</ref> Also, some states have set up annual surveillance reporting such as [[Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://www.mass.gov/Eeohhs2/docs/dph/occupational_health/injuries_hospital_2004.pdf Massachusetts Surveillance Report] Retrieved 2009-06-01</ref>
