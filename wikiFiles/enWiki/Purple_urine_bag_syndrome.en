'''Purple urine bag syndrome''' is a medical [[syndrome]] where purple discoloration of urine occurs in people with [[urinary catheter]]s and co-existent [[urinary tract infection]]. Bacteria in the urine produce the [[enzyme]] [[indoxyl phosphatase]]. This converts [[Indoxyl|indoxyl sulfate]] in the urine into the red and blue colored compounds [[indirubin]] and [[Indigo dye|indigo]].<ref name="Tan">{{cite journal | last=Tan | first=CK | coauthors=Wu YP, Wu HY, Lai CC | title=Purple urine bag syndrome | journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume=179 | issue=5 | pages=491 | month=August | year=2008 | pmid=18725621 | doi=10.1503/cmaj.071604 | pmc=2518199 }}</ref> The most commonly implicated bacteria are ''[[Providencia stuartii]]'', ''[[Providencia rettgeri]]'', ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Morganella morganii]]'', and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Lin | first=CH | coauthors=Huang HT, Chien CC et al. | title=Purple urine bag syndrome in nursing homes: ten elderly case reports and a literature review | journal=Clinical Interventions in Aging | volume=3 | issue=4 | pages=729–734 | month=December | year=2008 | pmid=19281065 | pmc=2682405 }}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==

People with purple urine bag syndrome usually do not complain of any [[symptom]]s. Purple discoloration of urine is often the only finding, frequently noted by carers http://cdn2.kevinmd.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/11f1-792745.gif .<ref name="Su"/>

== Pathophysiology ==

[[Tryptophan]] in the diet is metabolized by bacteria in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] to produce [[indole]]. Indole is absorbed into the blood by the intestine and passes to the liver. There, indole is converted to indoxyl sulfate. Indoxyl sulfate is excreted in the urine. In purple urine bag syndrome, bacteria that colonize the urinary catheter convert the indoxyl sulfate to indirubin and indigo.<ref name="Tan"/>

== Epidemiology ==

Purple urine bag syndrome is more common in female [[nursing home]] residents. Other risk factors include alkaline urine, constipation, and [[polyvinyl chloride]] catheter use.<ref name="Su">{{cite journal | last=Su | first=FH | coauthors=Chung SY, Chen MH et al. | title=Case analysis of purple urine-bag syndrome at a long-term care service in a community hospital | journal=Chang Gung Medical Journal | volume=28 | issue=9 | pages=636–642 | month=September | year=2005 | url=http://www.cgmh.org.tw/cgmj/2809/280906.pdf | pmid=16323555 | format= }} {{dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref>
