'''Trauma''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τραῦμα, "wound"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtrau%3Dma τραῦμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>) also known as [[injury]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=[edited by] John|title=International Trauma Life Support for emergency care providers|year=2011|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=978-0132157247|pages=xxi|edition=7th ed.}}</ref> is a [[physiology|physiological]] wound caused by an external source.<ref name="merriam-webster.com">http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/trauma</ref><ref name=Dictionary>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Trauma|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|year=2010|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trauma|accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> It can also be described as "a physical [[wound]] or injury, such as a fracture or blow".<ref name="merriam-webster.com"/><ref name=conmed>{{cite dictionary|title=Concise Medical Dictionary|edition=Eighth|editor=Elizabeth Martin|year=2010|publisher=Market House Books Ltd}}</ref><ref>http://www.apa.org/topics/trauma/index.aspx</ref>  Trauma is the sixth [[List of causes of death by rate|leading cause of death]] worldwide, accounting for 10% of all mortalities, and is therefore a serious [[public health]] problem with significant [[Social cost|social and economic costs]].

==Classification==
Trauma can be classified by the affected area of the body.<ref name=Rosen2010>{{cite book|title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition|last=Marx|first=J|year=2010|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-323-05472-0|pages=243–842}}</ref><!--percentages of total incidence--><ref name=ER2008/>

</div>
Trauma may also be classified by the affected [[Demographics|demographic group]].  For example, trauma involving a pregnant woman, [[pediatric trauma|pediatric]], or [[Geriatric trauma|geriatric]] patient.<ref name=Rosen2010/> It may also be classified by the type of force applied to the body, such as [[blunt trauma]] or [[penetrating trauma]].

===Injury severity scales===
Various scales exist for the purpose of having a quantifiable metric in which to measure the severity of an injury. The value can be used for triaging a patient or for statistical analysis. Injury scales measure damage to anatomical parts, physiological values (such as blood pressure), [[comorbidity|comorbidities]], or of combination of those. Some examples of common scales used are the [[abbreviated injury scale]] or the [[Glasgow coma scale]].<ref>Moore 2013, p. 77-98</ref>

==Causes==
There are various mechanisims that can cause injury to the body in various different ways and effect people on various levels of severity. The leading cause of traumatic death is [[blunt trauma]],<ref name=EMT-BMcGraw/> [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle accidents]]<ref name="EMT-BMcGraw">{{cite book|title=McGraw-Hill's EMT-Basic|last=DiPrima Jr.|first=PA|pages=227–33|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-149679-7}}</ref> and [[Falling (accident)|falling accidents]], subsets of blunt trauma, are the number one and two causes of traumatic death.<ref name="ec11">{{cite book|title=Emergency Care|author=Dickenson ET, Limmer D, O'Keefe MF|isbn=978-0-13-500523-1|year=2009}}</ref> The use of [[drug]]s such as [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[illicit drug]]s such as [[cocaine]] increases the risk of trauma, by making traffic collisions, [[violence]], and [[abuse]] more likely.<ref name=ER2008/> Other drugs such as [[benzodiazepine]]s increase the risk of trauma in [[old age|elderly]] people.<ref name=ER2008/> In addition, intentional injury is a common cause of traumas.<ref name="isbn0-340-92826-3">{{cite book |author=Jeff Garner; Greaves, Ian; Ryan, James R.; Porter, Keith R. |title=Trauma care manual |publisher=Hodder Arnold |location=London |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-340-92826-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Penetrating trauma is caused when a [[foreign body]] such as a bullet or a knife enters the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] of the body, creating an open [[wound]]. In the United States, most deaths caused by penetrating trauma occur in [[urban area]]s, and 80% of these deaths are caused by [[firearm]]s.<ref name="isbn078173200x">{{cite book|author=Medzon R, Mitchell EJ|title=Introduction to Emergency Medicine|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Willkins|location=Philadelphia|year=2005|pages=393–431|isbn=0-7817-3200-X}}</ref> [[Blast injury]] is a complex cause of trauma because it commonly includes both blunt and penetrating trauma, and may also be accompanied by a [[burn injury]].

===Prevention===
By identifying risk factors present within a community and creating solutions to decrease the incidence of injury, trauma referral systems can help to enhance the overall health of a population.<ref name=Hoyt2007>{{cite journal|last1=Hoyt|first1=DB|last2=Coimbra|first2=R|title=Trauma systems|journal=Surgical Clinics of North America|volume=87|issue=1|pages=21–35, v–vi|year=2007|pmid=17127121|doi=10.1016/j.suc.2006.09.012}}</ref> Commonly injury prevention strageties are utilized to prevent injuries in children as they are a high risk population.<ref name="child prevention">{{cite book | title=Injury Prevention for Young Children: A Research Guide | publisher=Greenwood | author=Walker, Bonnie | year=1996 | pages=2 | isbn=978-0313296864}}</ref> Generally, injury prevention strageties involve education of the general public to specific risk factors and developing strageties to mitigate injury.<ref name="cdcinjury">{{cite book | title=CDC Injury Fact Book | publisher=National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta, Georgia | year=2006 | location=Atlanta, Georgia | pages=35–101}}</ref> Some common forms of legislation regarding injury prevention typically involve [[seatbelt]]s, [[child car seat]]s, [[helmet]]s, alcohol control, and increased [[enforcement]].{{sfn|Greaves, Porter, Ryan, Garner|2008| p=6}}

The care of acutely injured people in a public health system is an issue which involves bystanders, community members, health care professionals, and health care systems. It encompasses [[Pre-hospital trauma assessment|prehospital assessment]] and care by [[emergency medical services]] personnel, emergency department assessment, treatment, and stabilization, and in-hospital care among all age groups.<ref name=CDC>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/injuryresponse/acute_injury.html|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Injury Prevention and Control: Injury Response: Acute Injury Care}}</ref> An established trauma system network is also an important component of community disaster preparedness, facilitating the care of people who have experienced natural disasters and terrorist attacks.<ref name=Hoyt2007/>

==Pathophysiology==
The body responds to traumatic injury both [[systemic disease|systemically]] and locally at the injury site.<ref name="trauma care">{{cite book | title=Manual of Definitive Surgical Trauma Care | publisher=Hodder Arnold Publishers | author=Boffard, Kenneth | year=2007 | location=London, England | isbn=9780340947647}}</ref>  This response attempts to protect vital [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s such as the liver, to allow further cell duplication, and to heal the damage.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1383/surg.21.9.240.16923}}</ref> Healing time depends on sex, age and severity of injury.<ref name="ICU Book"/>

[[Inflammation]], common after injury, protects against further injury and starts the healing process. Runaway inflammation can, however, cause [[organ failure]]. Immediately after injury, the body produces more glucose through [[gluconeogenesis]], and burns more fat via [[lipolysis]]. Next, the body tries to replenish its energy stores of [[glucose]] and [[protein]] via [[anabolism]]. In this state the body will temporarily increase its maximum expenditure for the purpose of healing injured cells.<ref name="ICU Book">{{cite book |author=Kenneth M Sutin; Marino, Paul L. |title=The ICU book |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-4802-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="pmid15910820">{{cite journal |author=Keel M, Trentz O |title=Pathophysiology of polytrauma |journal=[[Injury]] |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=691–709 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15910820 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2004.12.037 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020-1383(04)00552-2 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

Birdshot pellets are visible within and around the shattered patella, distal femur and proximal tibia.|Radiograph of a close-range [[shotgun]] [[blast injury]] to the [[knee]]. [[Birdshot|Birdshot pellets]] are visible within and around the shattered [[patella]], distal [[femur]] and proximal [[tibia]].]]

===Physical examination===
The purpose of the primary [[physical examination]] is to identify any life-threatening problems. Upon completion of the primary examination, the secondary examination is begun. This may occur during transport or upon arrival at the hospital. The secondary examination consists of a systematic assessment of the abdominal, pelvic and thoracic area, complete inspection of the body surface to find all injuries, and a [[neurological examination]]. The purpose of the secondary examination is to identify all injuries so that they may be treated. A missed injury is one which is not found during the initial assessment, such as when a patient is brought into a hospital's emergency department, but manifests itself at a later point in time.<ref name=ATLS2008/>

===Imaging===
Persons with major trauma commonly have chest and pelvic [[Radiography|X-rays]] taken,<ref name=ER2008/> and, depending on the mechanism of injury and presentation, are subject to a [[Focused assessment with sonography for trauma]] (FAST) exam to check for internal bleeding. For those with relatively stable [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]], and [[Oxygenation (medical)|sufficient oxygenation]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]]s are considered effective.<ref name=ER2008/><ref name=Trauma2010/> [[Full-body CT scan]]s, known as pan-scans, improve the survival rate in those who have suffered major trauma.<ref name=Huber2009>{{cite journal|author=Huber-Wagner S, Lefering R, Qvick LM, ''et al.''|title=Effect of whole-body CT during trauma resuscitation on survival: a retrospective, multicentre study|journal=Lancet|volume=373|issue=9673|pages=1455–61|year=2009|pmid=19321199|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60232-4}}</ref> These scans use intravenous injections for the [[radiocontrast]] agent, but not oral administration.<ref name=Allen2004>{{cite journal|author=Allen TL, Mueller MT, Bonk RT, Harker CP, Duffy OH, Stevens MH|title=Computed tomographic scanning without oral contrast solution for blunt bowel and mesenteric injuries in abdominal trauma|journal=J Trauma|volume=56|issue=2|pages=314–22|year=2004|pmid=14960973|doi=10.1097/01.TA.0000058118.86614.51}}</ref> There are concerns of [[radiation]] exposure from CT scans on the [[kidney]]s.

===Surgical techniques===
Surgical techniques, using a tube or catheter to [[diagnostic peritoneal lavage|drain fluid from the peritoneum]], [[chest tube|chest]], or the [[pericardiocentesis|pericardium around the heart]], are often used in cases of severe blunt trauma to the chest or abdomen, especially when a person is experiencing early signs of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. In those with [[hypotension|low blood-pressure]], likely because of bleeding in the abdominal cavity, [[laporotomy|cutting through the abdominal wall surgically]] is indicated.<ref name=ER2008/>

Before arriving at a hospital, the use of [[Stabilization (medicine)|stabilization]] techniques improve the chances of a person surviving the transport to the nearest [[Trauma center|trauma-equipped hospital]]. A [[healthcare provider]] should ensure their own safety and take appropriate [[body substance isolation|isolation]] precautions.

===Surgery===
Whether or not surgery is preformed is determined by the extent of the damage and the anatomical location of the injury. Before definitive repair can occur, active hemorrhaging must be controlled first.<ref>{{cite book |author=Andrew B., MD Peitzman; Andrew B.

==Prognosis==
Trauma used to lead to death in one of three stages: immediate, early, or late. Immediate deaths were usually due to [[apnea]], severe [[brain]] or high [[spinal cord]] injury, or rupture of the [[heart]] or of large blood vessels. The early deaths occurred within minutes to hours and were often due to [[subdural hematoma|hemorrhages in the brain's outer meningeal layer]], [[epidural hematoma|tears in arteries]], [[hemothorax|blood around the lungs]], [[pneumothorax|air around the lungs]], [[ruptured spleen]], [[Abdominal trauma#Liver|liver laceration]], or [[pelvic fracture]]. This period was known as the [[Golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]], often deciding whether a patient lived.  Late deaths occurred days or weeks after the injury.<ref name="ATLS2008"/> These stages may no longer be relevant in the United States due to improved care.<ref name=ER2008/>

==Society and culture==
===Economics===
The "cost" of trauma measures both the amount of cash spent and the loss of potential economic gain such as missing work days. The average economic cost for the treatment of traumatic injury in the [[United States]] is around $334,000 per person, making it costlier than the treatment of [[cancer]] and [[cardiovascular]] diseases.<ref name="PHTLS">{{cite book |author= |title=PHTLS: Prehospital Trauma Life Support |publisher=Mosby/JEMS |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-323-06502-3}}</ref> One reason of the high cost of injury is the increased possibility of complications which leads to the need for more interventions.<ref name="pmid18656640">{{cite journal |author=Hemmila MR, Jakubus JL, Maggio PM, ''et al.'' |title=Real money: [[complication (medicine)|complication]]s and hospital costs in trauma patients |journal=[[Surgery]] |volume=144 |issue=2 |pages=307–16 |year=2008 |month=August |pmid=18656640 |pmc=2583342 |doi=10.1016/j.surg.2008.05.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039-6060(08)00289-4 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> Costs to maintain a trauma center are substantial as they are open continuously and maintain their readiness.<ref name="pmid14706578">{{cite journal |author=Taheri PA, Butz DA, Lottenberg L, Clawson A, Flint LM |title=The cost of trauma center readiness |journal=[[American Journal of Surgery]] |volume=187 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14706578 |doi= |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002961003004379 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref>  In 2009 around 693.5 billion USD was lost due to traumatic injury in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nsc.org/Documents/Injury_Facts/Injury_Facts_2011_w.pdf | title=Injury Facts | publisher=National Safety Council | accessdate=July 17, 2012}}</ref>

===Low and middle income countries===
Citizens of [[Developing country|low]] and [[middle income country|middle]] income countries (LMICs) often have higher mortality rates due to various reasons. Many of these countries do not have access to proper surgical care to deal with injury as many do not have a trauma system. In addition, most LMICs do not have a prehospital care system to initially deal and transport injured persons to appropriate facilities in a timely manor. Hospitals also lack the appropriate physical resources (equipment), [[organization|organizational]] resources (improvement efforts), or [[human resource]]s (trained staff).<ref name="care">{{cite journal |author=Sakran JV, Greer SE, Werline EC, McCunn M |title=Care of the injured worldwide: trauma still the neglected disease of modern society |journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=64 |year=2012 |month=September |pmid=22980446 |doi=10.1186/1757-7241-20-64 |url= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref><ref name="strength">{{cite journal |author=Mock C, Quansah R, Krishnan R, Arreola-Risa C, Rivara F |title=Strengthening the prevention and care of injuries worldwide |journal=[[Lancet]] |volume=363 |issue=9427 |pages=2172–9 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15220042 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16510-0 |url= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref> By 2020 the amount of trauma related deaths is expected to decline in [[high income country|high-income countries]] while in low to middle-income countries it is expected to increase.{{sfn|Greaves, Porter, Ryan, Garner|2008| p=2}}
