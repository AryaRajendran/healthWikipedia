'''Anorexia''' (deriving from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "α(ν)-" (''a(n)-'', a prefix that denotes absence) + "όρεξη" ''(orexe)'' = appetite) is the decreased sensation of [[appetite]]. While the term in non-scientific publications is often used interchangeably with [[anorexia nervosa]], many possible causes exist for a decreased appetite, some of which may be harmless, while others indicate a serious clinical condition or pose a significant risk.

For example, '''anorexia of infection''' is part of the [[acute phase response]] (APR) to infection.  The APR can be triggered by [[lipopolysaccharide]]s and [[peptidoglycan]]s from bacterial cell walls, bacterial DNA, double-stranded viral RNA, and viral [[glycoprotein]]s, which can trigger production of a variety of [[proinflammatory cytokines]].  These can have an indirect effect on appetite by a number of means, including [[peripheral afferent]]s from their sites of production in the body, by enhancing production of [[leptin]] from fat stores.  Inflammatory cytokines can also signal to the [[central nervous system]] more directly by specialized transport mechanisms through the [[blood–brain barrier]], via [[circumventricular organ]]s (which are outside the barrier), or by triggering production of [[eicosanoid]]s in the [[endothelial cell]]s of the brain vasculature.  Ultimately the control of appetite by this mechanism is thought to be mediated by the same factors normally controlling [[appetite]], such as neurotransmitters ([[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[histamine]]), [[corticotropin releasing factor]], [[neuropeptide Y]], and [[α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Langhans W |title=Anorexia of infection: current prospects |journal=Nutrition |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=996–1005 |year=2000 |month=October |pmid=11054606 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0899-9007(00)00421-4}}</ref>

==Causes==
===Clinically important causes===
* [[Acute radiation syndrome]]
* Acute viral [[hepatitis]]
* [[Addison's disease]]
* [[Atypical pneumonia]] (mycoplasma)
* [[AIDS]]
* [[Anorexia nervosa]]
* [[Anxiety disorder]]
* [[Appendicitis]]
* [[Cancer]]
* [[Chronic pain]]
* [[Chronic kidney disease]]
* [[Congestive heart failure]], perhaps due to congestion of the [[liver]] with [[venous blood]]
* [[Crohn's disease]]
* [[Dementia]]
* [[Drug addiction]]
* [[clinical depression|Depression]]
* [[Hypervitaminosis D]]
* [[Metabolic disorders]], particularly [[urea cycle disorders]]
* [[Sickness behavior]]<ref>{{cite PMID|9468766}}</ref><ref>{{Cite PMID|283688}}</ref>
* [[Superior mesenteric artery syndrome]]
* [[Tuberculosis]]
* [[Thalassemia]]
* [[Ulcerative colitis]]
* [[Zinc deficiency]]

===Drugs===
* [[Amphetamine]] ([[Adderall]]), [[dextroamphetamine|dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine & Dextrostat)]], [[lisdexamfetamine]] (Vyvanse)
* [[Antidepressants]] can have anorexia as a side effect
**[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s
* [[Exenatide|Byetta]], a Type II Diabetes drug, will cause moderate nausea and loss of appetite
* [[dexmethylphenidate|Dextromethylphenidate (Focalin)]]
* Abrupt cessation of appetite-increasing drugs, such as [[cannabis]] and [[corticosteroid]]s
* [[methamphetamine|Methamphetamine (Desoxyn)]]  (treatment of [[ADHD|ADD & ADHD]] and [[narcolepsy]])
* [[methylphenidate|Methylphenidate (Ritalin & Concerta)]]
* Chemicals that are members of the [[phenethylamine]] group. (Individuals with anorexia nervosa may seek them to suppress appetite)
* [[Stimulants]] such as [[Caffeine]], [[Nicotine]], and [[Cocaine]]
* [[topiramate|Topiramate (Topamax)]] (as a side effect)
* Other drugs may be used to intentionally cause anorexia in order to help a patient [[fasting|preoperative fasting]] prior to [[general anesthesia]]. It is important to avoid food before surgery to mitigate the risk of [[pulmonary aspiration]], which can be fatal.
* [[Opiates]] act upon the digestive system and can reduce the physical sensation of hunger in the same way that they reduce physical sensations of pain. They also frequently cause delayed gastric emptying ([[gastroparesis]]) and can sometimes lead to changes in metabolism with long-term use.

===Other===
* During the post-operative recovery period for a tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, it is common for adult patients to experience a lack of appetite until their throat significantly heals (usually between 10–14 days).<ref>[http://www.umhc.com/oth/Page.asp?PageID=OTH001009 Home Care After Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy]</ref>
* [[Altitude sickness]]
* Significant [[Broken heart|emotional pain]] caused by an event (rather than a [[mental disorder]]) can cause an individual to temporarily lose all interest in food
* Physical exercise
