The '''clitoral crura''' (singular: '''clitoral crus''') are two [[erectile tissue]] structures, which together form a V-shape. ''Crus'' is a Latin word that means "leg". Each "leg" of the ''V'' converges on the [[clitoral body]]. At each divergent point is a [[corpus cavernosum of clitoris]]. The crura are attached to the [[pubic arch]], and are adjacent to the 
[[vestibular bulbs]]. The crura flank the [[urethra]], [[urethral sponge]], and [[vagina]] and extend back toward the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]]. Each clitoral crus connects to the [[rami]] of the pubis and the [[ischium]].

During [[sexual arousal]], the crura become engorged with blood, as does all of the erectile tissue of the clitoris.<ref>{{cite book |last=The Diagram Group |year=1982 |title=Sex: A User's Manual. |publisher= Berkley Publishing Group |id=ISBN 043508972}}</ref>

The clitoral crura contain the [[ischiocavernosus muscle]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Henry |year=1918 |title=Atlas of the Human Body |publisher= Lea & Febiger}}</ref>
