{{Other uses|Digit (disambiguation){{!}}Digit}}
A '''digit''' is one of several most [[Proximo-distal#Proximal_and_distal|distal]] parts of a [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]], such as [[finger]]s or [[toe]]s, present in many [[vertebrate]]s.

== Names==
Some languages have different names for hand and foot digits (English: respectively "[[finger]]" and "[[toe]]", French: "doigts" and "orteils").

In other languages, e.g. [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] & [[Persian language|Persian]] there are no specific one-word names for fingers and toes; these are called "digit of the hand" or "digit of the foot" instead.

== Human digits ==
Humans normally have five digits on each extremity. Each digit is formed by several bones called [[phalanx bones|phalanges]], surrounded by soft tissue. Human fingers normally have a [[nail (anatomy)|nail]] at the distal phalanx. The phenomenon of [[polydactyly]] occurs when extra digits are present; the utility of such a mutation is case-dependent. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Dwight T | year = 1892 | title = Fusion of hands | url = | journal = Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 473–486 }}</ref>

The somatosensory cortex representation of the hand is a dynamic reflection of the fingers on the external hand: in [[syndactyly]] people have a clubhand of webbed, shortened fingers. However, not only are the fingers of their hands fused, but the cortical maps of their individual fingers also form a club hand. The fingers can be surgically divided to make a more useful hand. Surgeons did this at the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery in New York to a 32-year-old man with the initials O. G.. They  touching O. G.’s fingers before and after surgery while using MRI brain scans. Before the surgery, the fingers mapped onto his brain were fused close together; afterward, the maps of his individual fingers did indeed separate and take the layout corresponding to a normal hand.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mogilner A, Grossman JA, Ribary U, Joliot M, Volkmann J, Rapaport D, Beasley RW, Llinás RR | year = 1993 | title = Somatosensory cortical plasticity in adult humans revealed by magnetoencephalography | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=46347&blobtype=pdf | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 90 | issue = 8| pages = 3593–7 | pmid = 8386377 | pmc=46347 | doi=10.1073/pnas.90.8.3593|bibcode = 1993PNAS...90.3593M }}</ref>

Two ideas about the homology of arms, hands and digits have existed in the past 130 years. First that
digits are unique to tetrapods<ref>Holmgren N. (1933). On the origin of the tetrapod limb.

However new research that has created a three-dimensional reconstruction of a [[Panderichthys]], a coastal fish from the [[Devonian]] period 385 million years ago, shows that these animals already had many of the [[homology (biology)|homologous]] bones present in the forelimbs of limbed vertebrates.<ref name="Boisvert"/> For example, they had "[[Radius (bone)|radial]]" bones similar to rudimentary fingers but positioned in the arm-like base of their fins.<ref name="Boisvert"/>  Thus there was in the evolution of [[tetrapod]]s a shift such that the outermost part of the fins were lost and came to be replaced by early digits. This change is consistent with additional evidence from the study of [[actinopterygian]]s, [[shark]]s and [[lungfish]] that the digits of tetrapods arose from  pre-existing distal radials present in more primitive fish.<ref name="Boisvert"/><ref>{{cite web

Controversy still exists since [[Tiktaalik]], a vertebrate often considered to be the [[Transitional_fossil|missing link]] between fishes and land-living animals, had stubby leg-like limbs that lacked the finger-like radial bones found in the Panderichthys. The researchers of the  paper commented that "It is difficult to say whether this character distribution implies that Tiktaalik is [[Autapomorph|autapomorphic]], that Panderichthys and tetrapods are convergent, or that Panderichthys is closer to tetrapods than Tiktaalik. At any rate, it demonstrates that the fish–tetrapod transition was accompanied by significant character incongruence in functionally important structures.".<ref name="Boisvert">{{cite journal | author = Boisvert CA, Mark-Kurik E, Ahlberg PE | year = 2008 | title = The pectoral fin of Panderichthys and the origin of digits | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 456 | issue = 7222| pages = 636–8 | pmid = 18806778 | doi=10.1038/nature07339|bibcode = 2008Natur.456..636B }}</ref><sup>p. 638.</sup>

==Bird and theropod dinosaur digits== 

Birds and [[theropod dinosaur]]s (from which birds evolved) have three digits on their hands. Paradoxically the two digits that are missing are different: the bird hand (embedded in the wing) is thought to derive from the second, third and fourth digits of the ancestral five-digit hand. In contrast, the [[theropod dinosaur]]s seem to have the first, second and third digits.  Recently a Jurassic theropod intermediate fossil [[Limusaurus]] has been found in the [[Junggar Basin]] in western China that has a complex mix: it has a first digit stub and full second, third and fourth digits but its  wrist bones are like those that are associated with the second, third and fourth digits while its finger bones  are those of the first, second and third digits.<ref name=Xing/> This suggests the evolution of digits in birds resulted from a "shift in digit identity characterized early stages of theropod evolution"<ref name=Xing>{{cite journal | author = Xu Xing ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = A Jurassic ceratosaur from China helps clarify avian digital homologies | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7249| pages = 940–944 | doi = 10.1038/nature08124 | pmid=19536256 | bibcode=2009Natur.459..940X}}</ref>
