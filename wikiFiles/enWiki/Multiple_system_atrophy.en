'''Multiple-system atrophy (MSA)''' is a [[Degenerative disease|degenerative]]<ref>{{DorlandsDict|one/000010201|multiple system atrophy}}</ref> [[neurological disorder]].  MSA is associated with the degeneration of nerve cells in specific areas of the brain. This cell degeneration causes problems with movement, balance, and other autonomic functions of the body such as bladder control or blood-pressure regulation.  The cause of MSA is unknown and no specific risk factors have been identified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://health.ucsd.edu/news/2003/12_05_Shults.html |title=National Study Seeks Cause of Baffling, Fatal Disorder Called Multiple System Atrophy |accessdate=2008-07-01 |publisher=UCSD Health Sciences Communications Healthbeat |date=December 5, 2003 }}</ref> Around 55% of cases occur in men, with typical age of onset in the late 50s to early 60s.<ref name=Bensimon>{{cite journal |author=Bensimon G, Ludolph A, Agid Y, Vidailhet M, Payan C, Leigh PN |title=Riluzole treatment, survival and diagnostic criteria in Parkinson plus disorders: The NNIPPS Study |journal=Brain |year=2008 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn291 |volume=132 |pages=156–71 |pmid=19029129 |issue=Pt 1 |pmc=2638696}}</ref>

==Prevalence==

The overall [[prevalence]] of MSA is estimated at 4.6 cases per 100,000 people.<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.orpha.net/orphacom/cahiers/docs/GB/Prevalence_of_rare_diseases_by_alphabetical_list.pdf |title=Prevalence of rare diseases : Bibliographic data |date=November 2008 |page=20 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |publisher=[[Orphanet]] |accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref><ref name="pmid9371909">{{cite journal |author=Bower J, Maraganore D, McDonnell S, Rocca W |title=Incidence of progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy in Olmsted County, Minnesota, 1976 to 1990 |journal=Neurology |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=1284–8 |year=1997 |pmid=9371909 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/131/5/1362.long}}</ref> This disease is more common in men than in women, with studies showing ratios ranging from between 1.4:1<ref name=Wenning04/> to ratios as high as 1.9:1.<ref name="pmid10331752"/>

*[[autonomic dysfunction]]
*[[parkinsonism]] ([[muscle rigidity]] +/ [[tremor]] and slow movement)
*[[ataxia]] (Poor coordination / unsteady walking)

When [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] failure predominates, the term '''Shy–Drager syndrome''' is sometimes used, although this term is no longer current, given the terminology changes which are explained below.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jellinger KA |title=More frequent Lewy bodies but less frequent Alzheimer-type lesions in multiple system atrophy as compared to age-matched control brains |journal=Acta Neuropathologica |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=299–303 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s00401-007-0227-4 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/03j1p2032866847h |pmid=17476513}}</ref><ref name="pmid8628505">{{cite journal |author= The Consensus Committee of the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology |title=Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypotension, pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy |journal=Neurology |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=1470 |year=1996 |pmid=8628505 |doi=}}</ref><ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|875}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Shy GM, Drager GA |title=A neurological syndrome associated with orthostatic hypotension: a clinical-pathologic study |journal=Arch.

A variant with combined features of MSA and [[Lewy body dementia]] may also exist.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sikorska B, Papierz W, Preusser M, Liberski PP, Budka H.|title=Synucleinopathy with features of both multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies |journal=Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology |year=2007 |pmid=17239015 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=126–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.2006.00817.x}}</ref>

===Initial presentation===

The most common first sign of MSA is the appearance of an "akinetic-rigid syndrome" (i.e. slowness of initiation of movement resembling [[Parkinson's disease]]) found in 62% at first presentation. However it is unique in that there is minimal if any response to the dopamine medications used for Parkinsons.  Because of this it falls under the group of diseases titled:[[Parkinson plus syndrome]]. Other common signs at onset include problems with balance (cerebellar ataxia) found in 22% at first presentation, followed by genito-urinary problems (9%). For men, the first sign can be [[erectile dysfunction]] (inability to achieve or sustain an erection). Both men and women often experience problems with their bladders including urgency, frequency, incomplete bladder emptying, or an inability to pass urine (retention). About 1 in 5 MSA patients will suffer a fall in their first year of disease.<ref name=Bensimon/>

===Symptoms as disease progresses===
As the disease progresses three groups of symptoms predominate.  
These are:
#[[Parkinsonism]] (slow, stiff movement, writing becomes small and spidery)
#[[Cerebellar]] dysfunction (difficulty coordinating movement and balance)
#[[Autonomic nervous system]] dysfunction (impaired automatic body functions) including:
:* postural or [[orthostatic hypotension]], resulting in [[dizziness]] or [[fainting]] upon standing up
:* [[urinary incontinence]] or [[urinary retention]]
:* [[impotence]]
:* [[constipation]]
:* [[vocal cord]] paralysis
:* [[dry mouth]] and skin
:* trouble regulating [[body temperature]] due to [[sweating deficiency]] in all parts of the body
:* loud snoring, [[abnormal breathing]] or inspiratory [[stridor]] during sleep
:* other sleep disorders including [[sleep apnea]], [[REM Behavior Disorder]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilman S, Koeppe RA, Chervin RD, ''et al.'' |title=REM sleep behavior disorder is related to striatal monoaminergic deficit in MSA |journal=Neurology |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=29–34 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12847152 |url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12847152}}</ref>
Other symptoms such as double vision can occur.<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/msa_orthostatic_hypotension/msa_orthostatic_hypotension.htm NINDS NIH MSA with Orthostatic Hypotension]</ref>
Not all patients experience all of these symptoms.

Some patients (20% in one study) experience significant cognitive impairment as a result of MSA.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Brown RG, Lacomblez L, Landwehrmeyer BG, Bak T, Uttner I, Dubois B, Agid Y, Ludolph A, Bensimon G, Payan C, Leigh NP; for the NNIPPS Study Group |title=Cognitive impairment in patients with multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy |journal=Brain |date=August 2010|volume=133 |issue= Pt 8 |pages=2382–93 |pmid=20576697 |doi= 10.1093/brain/awq158}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
MSA usually progresses more quickly than Parkinson's disease.<ref name="pmid9371909"/> There is no remission from the disease. The average remaining lifespan after the onset of symptoms in patients with MSA is 7.9 years.<ref name="pmid9371909"/> Almost 80% of patients are disabled within 5 years of onset of the motor symptoms, and only 20% survive past 12 years.<ref name=Watanabe>{{cite journal |author=Watanabe H, Saito Y, Terao S, ''et al.'' |title=Progression and prognosis in multiple system atrophy: an analysis of 230 Japanese patients |journal=Brain |volume=125 |issue=Pt 5 |pages=1070–83 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11960896 |doi= 10.1093/brain/awf117|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11960896}}</ref> Rate of progression differs in every case and speed of decline may vary widely in individual patients.

O’Sullivan and colleagues (2008) identified early autonomic dysfunction to be the most important early clinical prognostic feature regarding survival in MSA. Patients with concomitant motor and autonomic dysfunction within 3 years of symptom onset had a shorter survival duration, in addition to becoming wheelchair dependent and bed-ridden at an earlier stage than those who developed these symptoms after 3 years from symptom onset. Their study also showed that when patients with early [[autonomic]] dysfunction develop frequent falling, or wheelchair dependence, or severe [[dysphagia]], or require residential care, there is a shorter interval from this point to death.<ref name=brain208>{{cite journal|last=O`Sullivan|first=S.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:MSA aSynuclein.jpg|thumb|Alpha synuclein immunohistochemistry showing many glial inclusions.]]
Diagnosis of MSA can be challenging because there is no test that can definitively make or confirm the diagnosis in a living patient. Certain signs and symptoms of MSA also occur with other disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, making the diagnosis more difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/root/vumc.php?site=adc&doc=4791 |author=Vanderbilt Autonomic Dysfunction Cente |title=Multiple System Atrophy / Shy Drager Syndrome |accessdate = May 29, 2010 }}</ref>

A definitive diagnosis can only be made pathologically on finding abundant [[glial cytoplasmic inclusion]]s in the central nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Glial cytoplasmic inclusions in the CNS of patients with multiple system atrophy (striatonigral degeneration,olivopontocerebellar atrophy and Shy-Drager syndrome)|journal=J Neurol Sci.|year=1989|month=Dec|volume=94|issue=1–3|pages=79–100|pmid=2559165|doi=10.1016/0022-510X(89)90219-0|author=Papp MI, Kahn JE, Lantos PL.}}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no discovered cure for MSA, so treatment involves treating the symptoms.

Ongoing care from a neurologist specialized in "movement disorders" is recommended as the complex symptoms of MSA are often not familiar to less-specialized health care professionals.

One particularly serious problem, the drop in blood pressure upon standing up (with risk of fainting thus injury from falling) often responds to [[fludrocortisone]], a synthetic [[mineralocorticoid]]. Another common drug treatment is [[midodrine]] (an [[alpha-agonist]]). Non-drug treatments include "head-up tilt" (elevating the head of the whole bed by about 10 degrees), salt tablets or increasing salt in the diet, generous intake of fluids, and pressure (elastic) stockings. Avoidance of triggers of low blood pressure (such as hot weather, [[alcohol]], dehydration) are crucial.<ref name="Shy-drager from Clinical Neurology">{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=2082488 |author=Aminoff MJ, Greenberg DA, Simon RP |chapter=Chapter 7. Movement Disorders |title=Clinical Neurology |edition=6th }}</ref>

[[Hospice care|Hospice]]/homecare services can be very useful as disability progresses.

[[Levodopa]] (L-Dopa), a drug used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, fails to improve the parkinsonian symptoms of most MSA patients. A recent trial reported that only 1.5% of MSA patients experienced a less than 50% improvement when taking levodopa, and even this was a transient effect lasting less than one year. Poor response to L-Dopa has been suggested as a possible element in the differential diagnosis of MSA from Parkinson's disease.

A November, 2008 study conducted in Europe failed to find an effect for the drug [[riluzole]] in treating MSA or PSP.<ref name="Bensimon"/>

A July, 2012, study suggested that mesenchymal [[Stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] could delay the progression of neurological deficits in patients with MSA-cerebellar type, suggesting the potential of mesenchymal [[Stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] as a treatment candidate of MSA.<ref name="Yonsei University study">{{cite journal|title=A randomized trial of mesenchymal stem cells in multiple system atrophy.|journal=Annals of Neurology|year=2012|volume=72|issue=1|pages=32–40|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22829267}}</ref>

===Rehabilitation===
Management by rehabilitation professionals (physiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and others) for problems with walking/movement, daily tasks, and speech problems is essential. 

[[Physiotherapy]] can help to maintain the patient’s mobility and will help to prevent [[contractures]].<ref name=Wenning04>{{cite journal |author=Wenning GK, Colosimo C, Geser F, Poewe W |title=Multiple system atrophy |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=93–103 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14747001 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00662-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474442203006628}}<br/>{{cite journal |author=Wenning GK, Colosimo C, Geser F, Poewe W |title=Erratum |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=137 |date=March 2004 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(04)00695-7 }}</ref> Instructing patients in [[gait training]] will help to improve their mobility and decrease their risk of falls.<ref name="Hardy">{{cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Joanne|title=Multiple system atrophy: pathophysiology, treatment and nursing care|journal=Nursing Standard|year=2008|volume=22|issue=22|pages=50–56|pmid=18333558}}</ref>  A physiotherapist may also prescribe [[mobility aid]]s such as a cane or a walker to increase the patient’s safety.<ref name="Hardy"/>  Other ways a physiotherapist can help to improve the patient’s safety are to teach them to move and transfer from sitting to standing slowly to decrease risk of falls and limit the effect of [[postural hypotension]].<ref name="Hardy"/> Instruction in ankle pumping helps to return blood in the legs to the [[systemic circulation]].<ref name=Hardy /> To further control the postural hypotension, raising the head of the bed by 8&nbsp;in (20.3&nbsp;cm) while sleeping may be indicated as well as the use of elastic [[compression garment]]s.<ref name="pmid10331752"/>

Social workers and occupational therapists can also help with coping with disability through the provision of equipment and home adaptations, services for carers and access to healthcare services, both for the person with MSA as well as family caregivers.

==Histopathology==

Multiple-system atrophy can be explained as cell loss and [[gliosis]] or a proliferation of [[astrocyte]]s in damaged areas of the central nervous system. This damage forms a scar which is then termed a glial scar.<ref  name=Wenning04/> Currently, a confirmed diagnosis of MSA can only be made post-mortem as glial cytoplasmic [[inclusion bodies]] are visible. When brain tissue of a person with MSA is examined under a microscope, these glial structures are visible, confirming the diagnosis. The presence of these inclusions (also known as Papp-Lantos bodies) in the movement, balance, and automatic-control centres of the brain are the defining histopathologic hallmark of MSA. Recent studies have shown that the major filamentous component of glial and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions is [[alpha-synuclein]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Arima K, Uéda K, Sunohara N, Arakawa K, Hirai S, Nakamura M, Tonozuka-Uehara H, Kawai M |title=NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in fibrillary components of neuronal and oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions in the pontine nuclei in multiple system atrophy |journal=Acta Neuropathol. |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=439–44|year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9829806 |doi= 10.1007/s004010050917 }}</ref> Mutations in this substance may play a role in the disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Al-Chalabi|first1=A|last2=Dürr|first2=A|last3=Wood|first3=NW|last4=Parkinson|first4=MH|last5=Camuzat|first5=A|last6=Hulot|first6=JS|last7=Morrison|first7=KE|author8=Al-Chalabi A, Dürr A, Wood NW, Parkinson MH, Camuzat A, Hulot JS, Morrison KE, Renton A, Sussmuth SD, Landwehrmeyer BG, Ludolph A, Agid Y, Brice A, Leigh PN, Bensimon G; NNIPPS Genetic Study Group.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=9|pages=e7114|last9=Sussmuth|year=2009|month=Sep|first9=SD|title=Genetic Variants of the α-Synuclein Gene SNCA Are Associated with Multiple System Atrophy|pmid=19771175|pmc=2743996|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007114|editor1-last=Heutink|editor1-first=Prof. Peter}}</ref>
[[Tau proteins]] have been found in some GCIs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Co-localization of alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated tau in neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in a patient with multiple system atrophy of long duration|journal=Acta Neuropathol.|year=2001|month=Mar|volume=101|issue=3|pages=285–93|pmid=11307630|author=Piao YS, Hayashi S, Hasegawa M, Wakabayashi K, Yamada M, Yoshimoto M, Ishikawa A, Iwatsubo T, Takahashi H.}}</ref>

==Terminology==
Many terms have historically been used to refer to this disorder, based on the predominant systems presented.  These include olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA), Shy–Drager syndrome (SDS), and striatonigral degeneration (SND), which were once considered to be separate disorders.<ref name="Ahmed-2012">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Z. | last2 = Asi | first2 = YT. | last3 = Sailer | first3 = A. | last4 = Lees | first4 = AJ. | last5 = Houlden | first5 = H. | last6 = Revesz | first6 = T. | last7 = Holton | first7 = JL. | title = The neuropathology, pathophysiology and genetics of multiple system atrophy. | journal = Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–24 | month = Feb | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2990.2011.01234.x | PMID = 22074330 }}</ref>

These terms and their distinctions have been dropped in recent (1996 onwards) medical usage<ref name="pmid8628505"/> and replaced with MSA and its subtypes, but are helpful to understanding the older literature about this disease:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Historical Name''' || '''Characteristics''' || '''Abbreviation and modern name'''

|}
The current terminology and diagnostic criteria for the disease were established at a 2007 conference  of experts on the disease and set forth in the "Second consensus statement on the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy."<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1212/01.wnl.0000324625.00404.15 |author= Gillman, S. |last2= Wenning |first2= GK |last3= Low |first3= PA |last4= Brooks |first4= DJ |last5= Mathias |first5= CJ |last6= Trojanowski |first6= JQ |last7= Wood |first7= NW |last8= Colosimo |first8= C |last9= Dürr |first9= A|title=Second consensus statement on the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy |journal=Neurology |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=670–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18725592 |pmc= 2676993 }}</ref>

The Second Consensus Statement defines two categories of MSA, based on the predominant symptoms of the disease at the time of evaluation.  These are:

* MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P)  MSA-P is defined as MSA where extrapyramidal features predominate. The term striatonigral degeneration, parkinsonian variant, is sometimes used for this category of MSA.

* MSA with cerebellar features (MSA-C).  MSA-C is defined as MSA where cerebellar ataxia predominates.  It is sometimes termed sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy.
