'''Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction''' is a clinical syndrome caused by severe impairment in the ability of the [[intestine]]s to push [[food]] through. It is characterised by the signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction without any lesion in the intestinal lumen.<ref>Natural history of chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction in adults: A single centre study.

==Causes==
In primary chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (the majority of chronic cases), the condition may be caused by an injury to the smooth muscle (myopathic) or the nervous system (neuropathic) of the gastrointestinal tract.<ref name="ReferenceC">Diagnosis, treatment and nutritional management of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Lacy, B. E., & Loew, B. J. Nutrition Issues in Gastroenterology, Series 77. 2009 Aug:9-24</ref>

In some cases there appears to be a genetic association.<ref name="pmid9934973">{{cite journal |author=Guzé CD, Hyman PE, Payne VJ |title=Family studies of infantile visceral myopathy: a congenital myopathic pseudo-obstruction syndrome |journal=Am.

Secondary chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction can occur as a consequence of a number of other conditions, including [[Kawasaki disease]],<ref name="pmid15121996">{{cite journal |author=Akikusa JD, Laxer RM, Friedman JN |title=Intestinal pseudoobstruction in Kawasaki disease |journal=Pediatrics |volume=113 |issue=5 |pages=e504–6 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15121996 |doi= 10.1542/peds.113.5.e504|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15121996}}</ref> [[Parkinson's disease]], Chagas' Disease, Hirschsprung's Disease, Intestinal Hypoganglionosis, collagen vascular diseases, endocrine disorders and use of certain medications.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The term may be used synonymously with [[Enteric neuropathy]] if a neurological cause is suspected.

==Clinical manifestations==
Clinical features of intestinal pseudo-obstruction can include abdominal pain, nausea, severe distension, vomiting, dysphagia, diarrhoea and constipation, depending upon the part of the gastrointestinal tract involved.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In addition, in the moments in which abdominal colic occurs, [[abdominal x-ray]] shows intestinal air fluid level. All of these features are also similar in true mechanical obstruction of the bowel.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Diagnosis==
Attempts must be made to determine whether there is a secondary cause amenable to treatment.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Primary (idiopathic) intestinal pseudo-obstruction is diagnosed based on motility studies, x-rays and gastric emptying studies.

==Treatment==
Secondary chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction is managed by treating the underlying condition.

There is no cure for primary chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. It is important that [[nutrition]] and [[Rehydration|hydration]] is maintained, and [[pain relief]] is given. Drugs that increase the propulsive force of the intestines have been tried, as have different types of surgery.

=== Medical treatment ===
[[Prucalopride]],<ref>{{pmid|11696108|Efficacy Study of Prucalopride to Treat Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (CIP)}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04947.x}}</ref> [[Pyridostigmine]],<ref name="ReferenceB"/> [[Metoclopramide]], [[cisapride]], and [[erythromycin]] may be used, but they have not been shown to have great efficacy. In such cases, treatment is aimed at managing the complications. [[Linaclotide]] is a new drug that has not yet received approval by [[Food and Drug Administration]] but in the future looks promising in the treatment of  ''Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction'' , [[Gastroparesis]] and ''Inertia coli''.<ref>"Textbook of Gastroenterology" by Tadataka Yamada,Editor John Wiley & Sons, 2011

Intestinal stasis, which may lead to bacterial overgrowth and subsequently, [[diarrhea]] or malabsorption is treated with antibiotics.

[[Nutritional deficiencies]] are treated by encouraging patients to avoid food high in fat and fibre, which increase abdominal distention and discomfort, and have small, frequent meals (5-6 per day), focusing on liquids and soft food. Reducing intake of poorly absorbed sugar alcohols may be of benefit. Referral to an accredited dietitian is recommended. If dietary changes are unsuccessful in meeting nutritional requirements and stemming weight loss, enteral nutrition is used. Many patients eventually require parenteral nutrition.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Use of [[octreotide]] has been described.<ref name="pmid17090868">{{cite journal |author=Sharma S, Ghoshal UC, Bhat G, Choudhuri G |title=Gastric adenocarcinoma presenting with intestinal pseudoobstruction, successfully treated with octreotide |journal=Indian J Med Sci |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=467–70 |year=2006 |month=November |pmid=17090868 |doi= 10.4103/0019-5359.27974|url=http://www.indianjmedsci.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5359;year=2006;volume=60;issue=11;spage=467;epage=470;aulast=Sharma}}</ref><ref name="pmid15777981">{{cite journal |author=Sørhaug S, Steinshamn SL, Waldum HL |title=Octreotide treatment for paraneoplastic intestinal pseudo-obstruction complicating SCLC |journal=Lung Cancer |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=137–40 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15777981 |doi=10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.09.008 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169-5002(04)00471-4}}</ref>

=== Surgical and other procedures ===
[[Intestinal decompression]] by [[colostomy]] or tube placement in a small stoma can also be used to reduce distension and pressure within the gut. The stoma may be a [[gastrostomy]], [[enterostomy]] or [[cecostomy]], and may also be used to feed or flush the intestines.

Colostomy or ileostomy can bypass affected parts if they are distal to (come after) the stoma. For instance, if only the large colon that is affected, an ileostomy may be helpful.

Resection of affected parts may be needed if part of the gut dies (for instance [[toxic megacolon]]), or if there is a localised area of dysmotility.

Gastric and [[colonic pacemaker]]s have been tried. These are strips placed along the colon which create an electric discharge intended to cause the muscle to contract in a controlled manner.

A potential solution, albeit radical, is a multi-organ transplant.  The operation involved transplanting the pancreas, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and liver, and was performed by Doctor Kareem Abu-Elmagd on Gretchen Miller, the subject of the [[Discovery Channel]] program ''[[Surgery Saved My Life]]''.<ref>[http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/surgery/follow-up/six-organ/gretchen.html Discovery Channel - Multiorgan transplant]</ref>
