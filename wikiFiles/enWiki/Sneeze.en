A '''sneeze''', or '''sternutation''', is a semi-autonomous, [[convulsive]] expulsion of [[air]] from the [[lungs]] through the nose and mouth, usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal [[mucosa]]. A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action resulting chiefly from irritation of the nasal mucous membrane.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sneeze|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sneeze.|accessdate=April,06, 2012}}</ref> Sneezing is possibly linked to [[Photic sneeze reflex|sudden exposure to bright light]], sudden change (fall) in temperature, breeze of cold air, [[snatiation|a particularly full stomach]], or viral infection, and can lead to the spread of disease.

The function of sneezing is to expel mucus containing foreign particles or irritants and cleanse the nasal cavity. During a sneeze, the [[soft palate]] and [[palatine uvula]] depress while the back of the tongue elevates to partially close the passage to the mouth so that air ejected from the lungs may be expelled through the nose. Because the closing of the mouth is partial, a considerable amount of this air is usually also expelled from the mouth. The force and extent of the expulsion of the air through the nose varies.

Sneezing typically occurs when foreign particles or sufficient external stimulants pass through the nasal hairs to reach the nasal [[mucosa]]. This triggers the release of [[histamine]]s, which irritate the nerve cells in the nose, resulting in signals being sent to the [[brain]] to initiate the sneeze through the [[Trigeminal nerve|trigeminal nerve network]]. The brain then relates this initial signal, activates the [[Pharynx|pharyngeal]] and [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal]] muscles and creates a large opening of the nasal and oral cavities, resulting in a powerful release of air and bioparticles. The powerful nature of a sneeze is attributed to its involvement of numerous organs of the upper body – it is a [[reflex|reflexive response]] involving the face, throat, and chest muscles.
Sneezing is also triggered by sinus nerve stimulation caused by [[nasal congestion]] and [[allergies]].


The neural regions involved in the sneeze reflex is located in the [[brainstem]] along the ventromedial part of the [[spinal trigeminal nucleus]] and the adjacent pontine-medullary [[lateral reticular formation]]. This region appears to control the [[pharyngeal muscles|epipharyngeal]], intrinsic [[muscles of larynx|laryngeal]] and respiratory muscles, and the combined activity of these muscles serve as the basis for the generation of a sneeze.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nonaka|first=S.|coauthors=T. Unno, Y. Ohta, S. Mori|title=Sneeze-evoking region within the brainstem|journal=Brain Research|date=19 March 1990|volume=511|issue=2|pages=265–270|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90171-7|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006899390901717|accessdate=7 February 2013|publisher=Elsevier B.V.}}</ref>

The sneeze reflex involves contraction of a number of different muscles and muscle groups throughout the body, typically including the eyelids. The common suggestion that it is impossible to sneeze with one's eyes open is, however, inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/db/human-body/sneezing-eyeballs-pop-out.html | title=Myth: Can sneezing with your eyes open make your eyeballs pop out? }}</ref>

Other than irritating foreign particles, [[allergy|allergies]] or possible illness, another stimulus is sudden exposure to bright light -  a condition known as [[photic sneeze reflex]]. The tendency to sneeze upon exposure to bright light is an [[autosomal dominant]] trait and affects 18-35% of the human population.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Breitenbach|first=RA|coauthors=Swisher PK, Kim MK, Patel BS|title=The photic sneeze reflex as a risk factor to combat pilots.|year=1993|month=December|pmid=8108024|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8108024|accessdate=7 February 2013|publisher=PubMed|location=927th [[USAFR]] Clinic, [[Selfridge Air National Guard Base]], MI 48045-5046}}</ref>
A rarer trigger, observed in some individuals, is the fullness of the stomach immediately after a large meal. This is known as [[snatiation]] and is regarded a medical disorder passed along [[genetically]] as an [[autosomal dominant]] trait.

Sneezing cannot occur during sleep due to [[REM atonia]] - a bodily state wherein motor neurons are not stimulated and reflex signals are not relayed to the brain. Sufficient external stimulants, however, may cause a person to wake from their sleep for the purpose of sneezing, although any sneezing occurring afterwards would take place with a partially awake status at minimum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amos.indiana.edu/library/scripts/sleepsneeze.html|title=A Moment of Science: Sleep On, Sneeze Not|accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==

While generally harmless in healthy individuals, sneezes spread disease through the [[infection|infectious]] [[aerosol]] droplets, commonly ranging from 0.5 to 5&nbsp;µm. 40,000 droplets can be produced by a sneeze.<ref>Cole EC, Cook CE. Characterization of infectious aerosols in health care facilities: an aid to effective engineering controls and preventive strategies. ''Am k Infect Control.'' 1998 Aug;26(4):453-64. Sneezing can transmit many diseases PMID 9721404</ref> To reduce the possibility of thus spreading disease (such as the [[flu]]), one should hold the [[forearm]] or the inside of the [[elbow]] in front of one's mouth and nose when sneezing. Using one's hand for that purpose is inappropriate, since it promotes spreading germs through commonly touched objects (most notably doorknobs).

== Preventive measures ==

Examples of preventive techniques are: the deep exhalation of the air in the lungs that would otherwise be used in the act of sneezing, holding the breath in while counting to ten or gently pinching the bridge of the nose for several seconds.

Proven methods to reduce sneezing generally advocate reducing interaction with [[irritation|irritant]]s, such as keeping pets out of the house to avoid animal [[dander]]; ensuring the timely and continuous removal of dirt and [[dust]] particles through proper housekeeping; replacing filters for furnaces and air-handling units; air filtration devices and [[humidifier]]s; and staying away from industrial and agricultural zones. Some people, however, find sneezes to be pleasurable and would not want to prevent them.<ref name=Adkinson>{{cite journal | author=Adkinson NF Jr. | title= Middleton’s Allergy: Principles and Practice.| journal=Phytomedicine. | year=2003 | edition=6}}</ref>

== Historic instances and practices ==

In [[Ancient Greece]], sneezes were believed to be prophetic signs from the [[Greek Gods|gods]]. In 401 BC, for instance, the [[Athens|Athenian]] general [[Xenophon]] gave a speech exhorting his fellow soldiers to fight against the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. A [[soldier]] underscored his conclusion with a sneeze. Thinking that this sneeze was a favorable sign from the gods, the soldiers were impressed. Another divine moment of sneezing for the Greeks occurs in the story of [[Odysseus]]. His waiting wife [[Penelope]], hearing [[Odysseus]] may be alive, says that he and his son would take revenge on the suitors if he were to return. At that moment, their son sneezes loudly and Penelope laughs with joy, reassured that it is a sign from the [[Greek Gods|gods]] ([[Odyssey]] 17: 541-550). It may be because this belief survived through the centuries, that in certain parts of Greece today, when someone is asserting something and the listener sneezes promptly at the end of the assertion, the former responds "bless you and I am speaking the truth", or "bless you and here is the truth" (in Greek "γεια σου κι αλήθεια λέω"-ya sou ki alithia leo, or "γεια σου και να κι η αλήθεια"-ya sou ke na ki i alithia). 

In [[Europe]], principally around the early [[Middle Ages]], it was believed that one's life was in fact tied to one's [[breath]] - a belief reflected in the word "expire" (originally meaning "to exhale") gaining the additional meaning of "to come to an end" or "to die". This connection, coupled with the significant amount of breath expelled from the body during a sneeze, had likely {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} led people to believe that sneezing could easily be fatal. This theory, if proven conclusively, could in turn explain the reasoning behind the traditional "God bless you" response to a sneeze, the origins of which are currently unclear. (see "Traditional Responses To A Sneeze" below for alternative explanations). Sir [[Raymond Henry Payne Crawfurd]], for instance, the late registrar of the [[Royal College of Physicians]], in his 1909 book "The Last Days of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]", states that, when the controversial monarch was on his deathbed, his medical attendants administered a concoction of [[Primula veris|cowslips]] and extract of [[Caltha palustris|ammonia]] to promote sneezing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wylie, A, | title = Rhinology and laryngology in literature and Folk-Lore | journal = The Journal of Laryngology & Otology | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–87 | year = 1927 | doi=10.1017/S0022215100029959}}</ref> However, it is not known if this promotion of sneezing was done to hasten his death (as [[coup de grace]]), or as an ultimate attempt at treatment.

In certain parts of [[Eastern Asia]], particularly in [[Chinese culture]], [[Japanese culture]] and [[Vietnamese culture]], a sneeze without an obvious cause was generally perceived as a sign that someone was talking about the sneezer at that very moment. This can be seen in the [[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Songs]] (a collection of Chinese poems)<ref>《詩經·終風》 「寤言不寐，願言則嚏」</ref> in ancient China as early as 1000 BC, and this belief is still depicted in present-day [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In [[China]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Japan]], for instance, there is a [[superstition]] that if talking behind someone's back causes the person being talked about to sneeze; as such, the sneezer can tell if something good is being said (one sneeze), something bad is being said (two sneezes in a row), even if someone is in love with them (three sneezes in a row) or if this is a sign that they are about to catch a [[Common cold|cold]] (multiple sneezes).

Parallel beliefs are known to exist around the world, particularly in contemporary Greek, Slavic, Celtic, English, French, and Indian cultures. Similarly, in [[Nepal]], sneezers are believed to be remembered by someone at that particular moment.

In [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], especially in [[North India|northern parts of India]], and also in [[Iran]], it has been a common superstition that a sneeze taking place before the start of any work was a sign of impending bad interruption. It was thus customary to pause in order to drink water or break any work rhythm before resuming the job at hand in order to prevent any misfortune from occurring.

Contrarily, in [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]], especially in their borderlands, the [[Kresy]], a popular belief persists that sneezes may be an inauspicious sign that one's mother-in-law speaks ill of their son-in-law at that moment. The same phenomenon is thought to correspond to daughters-in-law and their mothers-in-law. As with other [[Catholic]] countries, such as Mexico, Italy, or Ireland, the remnants of pagan culture are fostered in Polish peasant idiosyncratic superstitions.

The practice among [[Muslim culture|Islamic culture]], in turn, has largely been based on various Prophetic traditions and the teachings of [[Muhammad]]. An example of this is [[Al-Bukhaari]]'s narrations from [[Abu Hurayrah]] that the [[Islamic prophet]] once said:<blockquote>
''When one of you sneezes, let him say, "Al-hamdu-Lillah"'' (Praise be to [[God]])'', and let his brother or companion say to him, "Yarhamuk Allah"'' (May God have mercy on you)''. If he says, "Yarhamuk-Allah", then let [the sneezer] say, "Yahdeekum Allah wa yuslihu baalakum"'' (May God guide you and rectify your condition)''.''
</blockquote>

== Common verbal responses to a sneeze ==
{{Main|Responses to sneezing}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, the common verbal response to another person's sneeze is "(God) bless you" or, sometimes in the [[United States]], the much less common "Gesundheit" (the German word for "health") or "Salud" (the Spanish word for "health").  There are several proposed origins for the use "bless you" or "god bless" in the context of sneezing:

* Various alleged but conflicting superstitions relating the sneeze to evil spirits.  This includes beliefs that a sneeze could release one's soul, thus leading to its possible capture by lurking [[evil spirit]]s (as explained in the "Historic instances and practices" section above), or that the evil spirits could enter the body through the open mouth of a sneezing individual, or that the individual is sneezing out sins or evil spirits which had taken residence within the body and is thus in need of the blessing to prevent the [[Exorcism|exorcised]] [[spirit]]s from re-entering the body.
* Some say it came into use during the [[black death|plague]] pandemics of the 14th century.  Blessing the individual after showing such a symptom was thought to prevent possible impending death due to the lethal disease.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
* In Renaissance times a superstition was formed claiming one's heart stopped for a very brief moment during the sneeze, saying bless you was a sign of prayer that the heart wouldn't fail.
* It has also been stated that one says "(God) bless you" so that one does not catch the flu, cold, or any other forms of sickness.
* Indian culture is to respond with Krishna, similar to a blessing in western cultures.
* In the Telugu culture, a rather uncommon reciprocation to someone's sneeze is 'chiranjeeva'(చిర౦జీవ)which means 'may you live long' (from Sanskrit).

==Sound==
'''''Achoo''''' is the English [[onomatopoeia]] for the sound made during sneezing.
