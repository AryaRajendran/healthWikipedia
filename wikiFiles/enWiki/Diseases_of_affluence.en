'''Diseases of affluence''' is a term sometimes given to selected [[disease]]s and other health conditions which are commonly thought to be a result of increasing [[wealth]] in a society.<ref name=Ezzati05>{{cite journal |author=Ezzati M, Vander Hoorn S, Lawes CM, ''et al.'' |title=Rethinking the "diseases of affluence" paradigm: global patterns of nutritional risks in relation to economic development |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e133 |year=2005 |month=May |pmid=15916467 |pmc=1088287 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020133 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020133}}</ref> Also referred to as the "Western disease" paradigm, these diseases are in contrast to so-called "[[diseases of poverty]]", which largely result from and contribute to human impoverishment.

==Examples==
Examples of diseases of affluence include mostly chronic [[non-communicable diseases]] (NCDs) and other physical health conditions for which personal lifestyles and societal conditions associated with economic development are believed to be an important [[risk factor]] — such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], [[asthma]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Von Hertzen LC, Haahtela T |title=Asthma and atopy — the price of affluence? |journal=Allergy |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=124–37 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14763924 |doi=10.1046/j.1398-9995.2003.00433.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1398-9995.2003.00433.x/full }}</ref> [[coronary heart disease]], [[cerebrovascular disease]], [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[obesity]], [[hypertension]], [[cancer]], [[alcoholism]], [[gout]], and some types of [[allergy|allergies]].<ref name=Ezzati05/><ref name="WHO">{{cite web |format=PDF |title=Rethinking "diseases of affluence |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/media/Factsheet4.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Patterson K. |title=Diseases of Affluence |journal=[[Maisonneuve (magazine)|Maisonneuve]] |date=15 November 2010 |url=http://maisonneuve.org/pressroom/article/2010/nov/15/the-diseases-affluence/}}</ref> 

They may also be considered to include [[clinical depression|depression]] and other [[mental health]] conditions associated with increased social isolation and lower levels of psychological well being observed in many developed countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Luthar SS |title=The culture of affluence: psychological costs of material wealth |journal=Child Dev |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=1581–93 |year=2003 |pmid=14669883 |pmc=1950124 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0009-3920&date=2003&volume=74&issue=6&spage=1581}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Hamilton C. |title=Diseases of affluence and other paradoxes |newspaper=The Australian Financial Review |date=15 October 2004 |url=https://www.tai.org.au/index.php?q=node%2F19&pubid=336&act=display}}</ref> Many of these conditions are interrelated, for example obesity is thought to be a partial cause of many other illnesses.

In contrast, the diseases of poverty tend to be largely [[infectious disease]]s,  or the result of poor living conditions.  These include tuberculosis, asthma, and intestinal diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Singh AR, Singh SA |title=Diseases of poverty and lifestyle, well-being and human development |journal=Mens Sana Monogr |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=187–225 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=22013359 |pmc=3190550 |doi=10.4103/0973-1229.40567 |url=http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2008;volume=6;issue=1;spage=187;epage=225;aulast=Singh}}</ref>  Increasingly, research is finding that diseases thought to be diseases of affluence also appear in large part in the poor.  These diseases include obesity and cardiovascular disease and, coupled with infectious diseases, these further increase global health inequalities.<ref name=Ezzati05/>  

Diseases of affluence are predicted to become more prevalent in [[developing countries]] as diseases of poverty decline, longevity increases, and lifestyles change.<ref name=Ezzati05/><ref name="WHO"/> In 2008, nearly 80% of deaths due to NCDs — including heart disease, strokes, chronic lung diseases, cancers and diabetes — occurred in low- and middle-income countries.<ref>World Health Organization.

==Causes==
Factors associated with the increase of these conditions and illnesses ironically appear to be things that are a direct result of technological advances. They include:
*Less strenuous physical [[exercise]], often through increased use of motor vehicles
*Irregular exercise as a result of [[office]] jobs involving no physical labor.
*Easy accessibility in society to large amounts of low-cost food (relative to the much-lower caloric food availability in a [[subsistence economy]])
**More food generally, with much less physical exertion expended to obtain a moderate amount of food
**More high [[fat]] and high [[sugar]] foods in the diet are common in the affluent developed economies of the late-twentieth century
**Higher consumption of [[meat]] and [[dairy]] products
**Higher consumption of refined flours and products made of such, like [[white bread]] or white noodles
**More foods which are processed, cooked, and commercially provided (rather than seasonal, fresh foods prepared locally at time of eating)<ref>{{cite news| url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/publichealth/story/0,11098,1381205,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=15-Year Study Links Fast Food To Obesity | first=Sarah | last=Boseley | date=2004-12-31 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>
*Prolonged periods of [[inactivity]]
*Greater use of [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]]
*Longer [[life-span]]s
**Reduced exposure to infectious agents throughout life
