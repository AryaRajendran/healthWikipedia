'''"NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response"''' is a standard maintained by the [[United States|U.S.]]-based [[National Fire Protection Association]]. First "tentatively adopted as a guide" in 1960,<ref>[http://www.nfpa.org/Assets/files/AboutTheCodes/704/TCRF-1975-704M.pdf Proposed Amendments on Revisions to the Recommended System for the Identification of The Fire Hazards of Materials / NFPA No. 704M — 1969]</ref> and revised several times since then, it defines the colloquial "'''fire diamond'''" used by emergency personnel to quickly and easily identify the risks posed by hazardous materials. This helps determine what, if any, special equipment should be used, procedures followed, or precautions taken during the initial stages of an emergency response.

==Symbolism==

The four divisions are typically color-coded, with blue indicating level of [[health]] [[hazard]], red  indicating [[flammability]], yellow (chemical) [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], and white containing special codes for unique hazards. Each of health, flammability and reactivity is rated on a scale from 0 (no hazard) to 4 (severe risk).  See the latest version of NFPA 704 sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 for the specifications of each classification.<ref name="NFPA">[http://www.slideshare.net/luijar38/nfpa-704-2012 NFPA 704: Standard System for the Identification of the Hazards of Materials for Emergency Response, 2012 Edition]</ref>

! valign="center" | 0
| valign="center" | Materials that will not burn under typical fire conditions (e.g., [[carbon dioxide]]), including intrinsically noncombustible materials such as concrete, stone and sand.

! valign="center" | 3
| valign="center" | Liquids and solids (including finely divided suspended solids) that can be ignited under almost all ambient temperature conditions (e.g., [[gasoline]]). Liquids having a flash point below 23°C (73°F) and having a boiling point at or above 38°C (100°F) or having a flash point between 23°C (73°F) and 38°C (100°F)

=== Non-standard symbols ===

These [[hazard symbol]]s are not part of the NFPA 704 standard, but are occasionally used in an unofficial manner.  The use of non-standard symbols or text may be permitted, required or disallowed by the [[Construction#Authority having jurisdiction|authority having jurisdiction]] (e.g., fire department).

* '''COR''': [[Corrosive]]; strong [[acid]] or [[base (chemistry)|base]] (e.g. [[sulfuric acid]], [[potassium hydroxide]])
** '''ACID''' and '''ALK''' to be more specific
* '''BIO''' or [[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|20px]]: [[Biological hazard]] (e.g., [[smallpox|smallpox virus]])
* '''POI''': [[Poison]]ous (e.g. [[Strychnine]])
