'''Carl Tanzler''', or sometimes '''Count Carl von Cosel''' (February 8, 1877 &ndash; July 3, 1952), was a German-born [[Radiology|radiologist]] at the [[Marine Hospital Service|United States Marine Hospital]] in [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], [[Florida]] who developed a morbid obsession for a young [[Cuban-American]] [[tuberculosis]] patient, Elena Milagro "Helen" de Hoyos (July 31, 1909 - October 25, 1931), that carried on well after the [[Tuberculosis|disease]] had caused her death.<ref name=Swicegood>{{cite book |last=Swicegood |first=Tom |quote=Tuesday, October 1, 1940.

Some of his hospital records were signed '''Count Carl Tanzler von Cosel'''.

==Early life==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tanzler 034.jpg|thumb|Carl Tanzler (circa 1941) {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] -->
He was born as '''Karl Tänzler''' or '''Georg Karl Tänzler''' on February 8, 1877 in [[Dresden]], Germany. Around 1920 he married Doris A. (1889&ndash;1977) and he was listed as "Georg Karl Tänzler" on the marriage certificate. Together they had two children: Ayesha Tanzler (1922&ndash;1998), and Crystal Tanzler (1924&ndash;1934), who died of [[diphtheria]].<!--St. Petersburg Times, December 31, 1998; page 8: "Ayesha T. Bucey (Ann), 76, of Zephyrhills, died Sunday (December 27, 1998) at East Pasco Medical Center. She came here 71 years ago from her native Dresden, Germany. She was a waitress and homemaker. She was graduate of Zephyrhills High School and a member of the Zephyrhills Alumni and Friends. She was Methodist. Survivors include her daughter, Susan McKee, Zephyrhills; two sons, Jon Clendening, Portland, Oregon, and Gary Clendening, Hallowell, Maine; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Whitfield Funeral Home, Zephyrhills." -->

Tanzler grew up in Germany. The following “Editorial Note“ accompanying the autobiographical account “The Trial Bay Organ: A Product of Wit and Ingenuity” by “Carl von Cosel,“ in the [http://books.google.com/books?id=UVPZAAAAMAAJ&dq=editions:LCCNsf77000052 Rosicrucian Digest] of March and April 1939, gives details about his stay in Australia before and during World War I and his return to Germany after the war: 

:”Many years ago, Carl von Cosel travelled from India to Australia with the intention of proceeding to the South Seas Islands. He paused in Australia to collect equipment and suitable boats, and to become acquainted with prevailing weather and sea conditions. However, he became interested in engineering and electrical work there, bought property, boats, an organ, an island in the Pacific—so that he was still in Australia at the end of ten years. He had just begun to build a trans-ocean flyer when the war broke out and the British military authorities placed him in a concentration camp for 'safe-keeping' along with many officers India and China who were prisoners of war. Later he was removed to [[Trial Bay]] to a castle-like prison on the cliffs, and there the work in this narrative was accomplished. At the end of the war no prisoner was permitted to return to his former residence, but all were shipped to the prisoner's exchange in Holland. When Carl von Cosel was released he set out to find his mother from whom he had not heard since the beginning of the war. Finding her safe, he remained with her for three years, witnessing the chaos that followed in the wake of the war. ... Finally, she suggested that her son return to his sister in the United States ….”<ref>“The Trial Bay Organ: A Product of Wit and Ingenuity,” ''The Rosicrucian Digest'', March 1939, pp.54–58,  April 1939, pp.92–96.</ref><ref name=Harrison>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ben |authorlink= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Iuco-wPO-xsC&pg=PP1&dq |title=Undying Love: The True Story Of A Passion That Defied Death |year=2001 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |quote=...

Tanzler's account of Trial Bay Gaol, his secret building of a sailing boat, etc., is confirmed by [[Nyanatiloka]] Thera, who mentions that he planned to escape from the Gaol with ”Count Carl von Cosel” in a sailing boat, and provides other information about the interment of Germans in Australia during WWI, etc.<ref>Bhikkhu Nyanatusita & Hellmuth Hecker, ''The Life of Nyanatiloka Thera'', Kandy, 2008, pp. 53–54.</ref>

Tanzler emigrated to the United States in 1926, sailing from [[Rotterdam]] on February 6, 1926 to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. From Cuba he settled in [[Zephyrhills, Florida]], where his sister had earlier emigrated, and was later joined by his wife and two daughters. Leaving his family behind in Zephyrhills in 1927, he took a job as a [[radiologist]] at the [[Marine Hospital Service|U.S. Marine Hospital]] in [[Key West, Florida]] under the name Carl von Cosel.

During his childhood in Germany, and later while traveling briefly in [[Genoa, Italy]], Tanzler claimed to have been visited by visions of a dead ancestor, [[Anna Constantia Gräfin von Cosel|Countess Anna Constantia von Cosel]], who revealed the face of his true love, an exotic dark-haired woman, to him.<ref name=Swicegood/>

==Maria Elena Milagro de Hoyos==

On April 22, 1930, while working at the Marine Hospital in Key West, Tanzler met Maria Elena Milagro "Helen" de Hoyos (1909&ndash;1931), a local [[Cuban-American]] woman who had been brought to the hospital for an examination by her mother. Tanzler immediately recognized her as the beautiful dark-haired woman that had been revealed to him in his earlier "visions."<ref name=Harrison>{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ben |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Undying Love |year=2001 |publisher=St. Martin's True Crime |location= |isbn=0-312-97802-2 }}</ref> By all accounts, Hoyos was viewed as a local beauty in Key West.<ref name=Swicegood/><ref name="Harrison"/><ref name=Sloan>{{cite book |last=Sloan |first=David |authorlink= |quote=A German citizen, his real name was Carl Tanzler, and though he was well-read in many subjects, it is doubtful that he had any real schooling in the various ... | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_BNK_gs-KIQC&pg |title=Ghosts of Key West |year=1998 |publisher=Phantom Press |location= |isbn = 0-9674498-0-4 }}</ref>

Elena was the daughter of local cigar maker Francisco "Pancho" Hoyos (1883&ndash;1934) and Aurora Milagro (1881&ndash;1940). She had two sisters, Florinda "Nana" Milagro Hoyos (1906&ndash;1944), who married Mario Medina (c.1905&ndash;1944) and also succumbed to [[tuberculosis]]; and Celia Milagro Hoyos (1913&ndash;?). Medina, Nana's husband, was electrocuted trying to rescue a coworker who hit a powerline with his crane at a construction site.

On February 18, 1926, Hoyos married Luis Mesa (1908&ndash;?), the son of Caridad and Isaac Mesa. Luis left Hoyos shortly after Hoyos [[miscarriage|miscarried]] the couple's child, and moved to [[Miami]].  Hoyos was legally married to Mesa at the time of her death.

Hoyos was eventually diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], a typically fatal disease at the time, that eventually claimed the lives of almost her entire immediate family. Tanzler, with his self-professed medical knowledge, attempted to treat and cure Hoyos with a variety of medicines, as well as x-ray and electrical equipment, that were brought to the Hoyoses' home.<ref name=Swicegood/><ref name="Harrison"/> Tanzler showered Hoyos with gifts of jewelry and clothing, and allegedly professed his love to her, but no evidence has surfaced to show that any of his affection was reciprocated by Hoyos.<ref name=Swicegood/><ref name="Harrison"/>

==Morbid obsession==
[[File:Tanzer 031.jpg|thumb|left|The corpse of Maria Elena Milagro de Hoyos (1910&ndash;1931) encased in wax and plaster circa 1940.]]

Despite Tanzler's best efforts, Hoyos died of [[tuberculosis|terminal tuberculosis]] at her parents' home in Key West on October 25, 1931.<ref name=Swicegood/> Following Hoyos's funeral, which Tanzler paid for, and with the permission of her family, Tanzler commissioned the construction of an above ground [[mausoleum]] in the [[Key West Cemetery]] that he visited almost every night.<ref name=Swicegood/><ref name="Harrison"/> 

One evening in April, 1933, Tanzler crept through the cemetery where Hoyos was buried and removed her body from the mausoleum, carting it through the cemetery after dark on a toy wagon, and transporting it to his home. He reportedly said that Elena's spirit would come to him when he would sit by her grave and serenade her corpse with a favorite Spanish song. He also said that she would often tell him to take her from the grave.<ref name=Swicegood>{{cite book |last=Swicegood |first=Tom |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Von Cosel |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |location= |isbn=0-595-74652-7 }}</ref> Tanzler attached the corpse's bones together with wire and coat hangers, and fitted the face with glass eyes. As the skin of the corpse decomposed, Tanzler replaced it with silk cloth soaked in wax and [[plaster of paris]]. As the hair fell out of the decomposing scalp, Tanzler fashioned a wig from Hoyos's hair that had been collected by her mother and given to Tanzler not long after her burial in 1931.<ref name="Harrison"/> Tanzler filled the corpse's [[abdominal]] and chest cavity with rags to keep the original form, dressed Hoyos's remains in stockings, jewelry, and gloves, and kept the body in his bed. Tanzler also used copious amounts of perfume, disinfectants, and preserving agents, to mask the odor and forestall the effects of the corpse's [[decomposition]].<ref name="Autopsy 6: Secrets of the Dead - The Strange Obsession of Dr. Carl Von Cosel">{{cite web | url = http://www.hbo.com/autopsy/episode/episode_6_the_strange_obsession_of_dr_carl_von_cosel.html | accessdate = 2006-08-24 | quote=The Strange Obsession of Dr. Carl Von Cosel. In 1934, Dr. Carl Von Cosel worked at a Key West hospital, treating patients suffering from then-incurable tuberculosis. He fell in love with a 22-year-old patient named Elena Hoyos. When she died, Von Cosel got permission from her family to build her a mausoleum. There, Von Cosel used formaldehyde to preserve the body, visiting it nightly. ...| title = Autopsy 6: Secrets of the Dead - The Strange Obsession of Dr. Carl Von Cosel | publisher =[[HBO]]| year = 2005}}</ref>

In October, 1940, Elena's sister Florinda heard rumors of Tanzler sleeping with the disinterred body of her sister, and confronted Tanzler at his home, where Hoyos's body was eventually discovered. Florinda notified the authorities, and Tanzler was arrested and detained. Tanzler was [[psychiatry|psychiatrically]] examined, and found [[Competence (law)|mentally competent]] to stand trial on the charge of "wantonly and maliciously destroying a grave and removing a body without authorization."<ref name=Swicegood>{{cite book |last=Swicegood |first=Tom |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Von Cosel |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |location= |isbn = 0-595-74652-7 }}</ref> After a [[preliminary hearing]] on October 9, 1940 at the [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] Courthouse in Key West, Tanzler was held to answer on the charge, but the case was eventually dropped and he was released, as the [[statute of limitations]] for the crime had expired.<ref name="Swicegood"/><ref name="Harrison"/> 

Shortly after the corpse's discovery by authorities, Hoyos's body was examined by physicians and [[pathologists]], and put on public display at the Dean-Lopez Funeral Home, where it was viewed by as many as 6,800 people.<ref name=Sloan/> Hoyos's body was eventually returned to the [[Key West Cemetery]] where the remains were buried in an unmarked grave, in a secret location, to prevent further tampering.<ref name=Swicegood/>

The facts underlying the case and the preliminary hearing drew much interest from the media at the time (most notably, from the ''[[Key West Citizen]]'' and ''[[Miami Herald]]''), and created a sensation among the public, both regionally and nationwide.  The public mood was generally sympathetic to Tanzler, whom many viewed as an eccentric "romantic".<ref name=Swicegood/>

Though not reported contemporaneously, research (most notably by authors Harrison and Swicegood) has revealed evidence of Tanzler's [[necrophilia]] with Hoyos's corpse.<ref name=Swicegood/><ref name="Harrison"/>  Two physicians (Dr. DePoo and Dr. Foraker) who attended the 1940 autopsy of Hoyos's remains recalled in 1972 that a paper tube had been inserted in the vaginal area of the corpse that allowed for intercourse.<ref name="Swicegood"/><ref name="Harrison"/>  Others contend that since no evidence of necrophilia was presented at the 1940 preliminary hearing, and because the physicians' "proof" surfaced in 1972, over 30 years after the case had been dismissed, the necrophilia allegation is questionable. While no existing contemporary photographs of the autopsy or photographs taken at the public display show a tube, the necrophilia claim was repeated by the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] ''[[Autopsy (TV series)|Autopsy]]'' program in 2005.<ref name="Autopsy 6: Secrets of the Dead - The Strange Obsession of Dr. Carl Von Cosel">{{cite web | url = http://www.hbo.com/autopsy/episode/episode_6_the_strange_obsession_of_dr_carl_von_cosel.html | accessdate = 2006-08-24 | author = | title = Autopsy 6: Secrets of the Dead - The Strange Obsession of Dr. Carl Von Cosel | publisher = ''HBO.com''| year = 2005}}</ref>

==Later life and death==

In 1944, Tanzler moved to [[Pasco County, Florida]] close to [[Zephyrhills, Florida]], where he wrote an autobiography that appeared in the [[Pulp magazine|Pulp]] publication, ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'', in 1947. His home was near his wife Doris, who apparently helped to support Tanzler in his later years.<ref name=Swicegood/> Tanzler received [[United States citizen]]ship in 1950 in [[Tampa]].

Separated from his obsession, Tanzler used a [[death mask]] to create a life-sized [[effigy]] of Hoyos, and lived with it until his death on July 3, 1952.<ref name="Autopsy 6: Secrets of the Dead - The Strange Obsession of Dr. Carl Von Cosel"/> His body was discovered on the floor of his home three weeks after his death. He died under the name "Carl Tanzler".

It has been recounted that Tanzler was found in the arms of the Hoyos effigy upon discovery of his corpse, but his obituary reported that he died on the floor behind one of his organs. The obituary recounted: "a metal cylinder on a shelf above a table in it wrapped in silken cloth and a robe was a waxen image".<ref name=KeyWest>''Key West Citizen''; July 24, 1952</ref>

It has also been written (most notably by Swicegood) that Tanzler had the bodies switched (or that Hoyos's remains were secretly returned to him), and that he died with the real body of Elena.<ref name=Swicegood/> There is no evidence that the waxen effigy found in his house at the time of his death contained bones, or any other human material.<ref name=KeyWest/>

==In popular culture==
*Several bands have released musical interpretations of the Tanzler story, such as [[And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead]]'s  ''[[The Secret of Elena's Tomb]]'' album, and [[Sleep Station]]'s ''[[Von Cosel]]'' album, both released in 2003.
*The band [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|''The Black Dahlia Murder'']] released a song titled ''Deathmask Divine'' which tells the story.
*In 2008, [[ChansoNoir]] released the single ''[[Count Von Cosels Obsession]]'', with the [[b-side]] ''A Cemetery Serenade'' presenting an instrumental piece reenacting Carl Tanzler's organ playing in the tomb.
*The ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not]]'' museum In Key West, Florida, has an exhibit recreating Elena's body being cared for by Tanzler.
*Portions of the original memorial plaque that was commissioned by Tanzler and affixed to Elena Hoyos's mausoleum have been reassembled and are on display at the [[Martello Gallery-Key West Art and Historical Museum]] in Key West.
*The television series [[Nip/Tuck]] had an episode apparently based off of this story, in which a mortician sews together various body parts to create a body for the head of his beloved.
