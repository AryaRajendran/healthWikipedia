'''Breast Cancer Awareness Month''' ('''BCAM'''), also referred to in America as '''National Breast Cancer Awareness Month''' ('''NBCAM'''), is an annual international health campaign organized by major [[breast cancer]] charities every '''October''' to increase [[breast cancer awareness|awareness of the disease]] and to [[fundraising|raise funds]] for research into its cause, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure. The campaign also offers information and support to those affected by breast cancer. 

==History==
[[Image:PinkWhiteHouseOctober.jpg|200px|thumb|[[White House]] decorated pink in honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October 2008]]
NBCAM was founded in 1985 as a partnership between the [[American Cancer Society]] and the pharmaceutical division of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (now part of [[AstraZeneca]], producer of several anti-breast cancer drugs).  The aim of the NBCAM from the start has been to promote mammography as the most effective weapon in the fight against breast cancer.<ref>[http://www.nbcam.org/about_faq.cfm Official National Breast Cancer Awareness Month (NBCAM) Frequently Asked Questions]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref> 

In 1993 [[Evelyn Lauder]], Senior Corporate Vice President of the [[Estée Lauder Companies]] founded [[The Breast Cancer Research Foundation]] and established the [[pink ribbon]] as its symbol, though this was not the first time the ribbon was used to symbolize breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esteelauder.com/templates/products/multiproduct.tmpl?ngextredir=1&CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY5887 |title=Estée Lauder Official Site |publisher=Esteelauder.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref> In the fall of 1991, the Susan G.

==Male breast cancer==
[[Male breast cancer]], which is rare, is generally overlooked.  In 2009 the male breast cancer advocacy groups Out of the Shadow of Pink, A Man's Pink, and the Brandon Greening Foundation for Breast Cancer in Men joined together to globally establish the third week of October as "Male Breast Cancer Awareness Week".<ref>{{cite web

== Criticisms ==

<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pezzullo|first=Phaedra|title=Resisting “National Breast Cancer Awareness Month”: The Rhetoric of Counterpublics and their Cultural Performances|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|year=2003|month=November|volume=89|issue=4|pages=345-365}}</ref> === Corporate Sponsorship ===
Inspiration for the foundation of NBCAM came from Zeneca Inc. in 1989 when they began a breast cancer screening program within their company. In 1996, with the screening program and study complete, Zeneca Inc. analyzed the total monetary amounts lost due to the increase in health care provided compared with the total monetary amounts lost if the company was to scape the program were compared. The total costs to the company of running the early detection program were estimated to be $400,000. Total costs to the company if they chose not to run the program were estimated to be around $1.5 million. 

Pezzullo (2003)"(Astra)Zeneca’s initial justification for NBCAM was one of basic accounting, not a critique of how women’s healthcare has been assessed or implemented nor a desire to prevent women from developing breast cancer; instead, it was cost-effective for a company to detect cancer in its employees during the disease’s earlier stages."

It has been alleged that "the BCAM idea 'was conceived and paid for by a British chemical company that both profits from this epidemic and may be contributing to its cause...'".<ref>Janette D. Sherman, M.D.(New York and London: Taylor and
Francis, 2000). ISBN 1-56032-870-3. Life's Delicate Balance  [http://www.safe2use.com/drsherman/life/15.htm ''THE CANCER MOVEMENT: Independent, Sold-Out, or Bought Up? '' ].</ref> 


Sometimes referred to as ''National Breast Cancer Industry Month'', critics of NBCAM point to a conflict of interest between corporations sponsoring [[breast cancer awareness]] while profiting from diagnosis and treatment. The breast cancer advocacy organization, [[Breast Cancer Action]], has said repeatedly in newsletters and other information sources that October has become a [[public relations]] campaign that avoids discussion of the causes and prevention of breast cancer and instead focuses on “awareness” as a way to encourage women to get their mammograms. The term ''[[pinkwashing]]'' has been used by Breast Cancer Action to describe the actions of companies which manufacture and use chemicals which show a link with breast cancer and at the same time publicly support charities focused on curing the disease.<ref>[http://www.thinkbeforeyoupink.org/Pages/FocusOnPinkwashers.html Focus on Pinkwashers], Breast Cancer Action's ''think before you pink'' campaign site. Retrieved November 9, 2007.</ref>  Other criticisms center on the marketing of "pink products" and tie ins, citing that more money is spent marketing these campaigns than is donated to the cause.<ref>[http://www.thinkbeforeyoupink.org/PDF/NYTimesAd.pdf Who's Really Cleaning Up Here] Breast Cancer Action's ''think before you pink'' campaign site.
