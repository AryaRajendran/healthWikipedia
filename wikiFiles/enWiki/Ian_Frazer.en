The [[Hepatitis B vaccine|Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)]] protects against the development of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|malignant liver cancer]] and was the first vaccine capable of preventing the development of a specific human cancer. But, the [[Australia antigen]] was understood to be a potential vaccine seven years before the carcinogenic effect of [[Hepatitis B]] was discovered (see: {{cite journal |first1= R.

HBV was designed to prevent the disease's other symptoms, whereas an HPV vaccine would have been low priority if HPV wasn't carcinogenic (for example,  [http://www.medcompare.com/spotlight.asp?spotlightid=188 medcompare.com] says men are almost always clinically asymptomatic).

These projections may be little effected by vaccination programs (anyway unlikely on cost grounds) because "''A reduction in cancer incidence and mortality might not be measurable before 10 to 30 years after the vaccine is introduced.''" (p.5). Other estimates of the problem's scale are broadly in agreement:
