'''Hyperviscosity syndrome''' is a group of symptoms triggered by increase in the [[viscosity]] of the [[blood]]. Symptoms of high [[blood viscosity]] include spontaneous bleeding from [[mucous membrane]]s, visual disturbances due to [[retinopathy]], and neurologic symptoms ranging from [[headache]] and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] to [[seizures]] and [[coma]].

Hyperviscosity syndrome may be caused by an increase in [[blood plasma|serum]] [[proteins]] or cells. Increased levels of proteins are seen with [[monoclonal gammopathy|monoclonal gammopathies]] such as [[Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia]] and in [[multiple myeloma]] (particularly IgA and IgG3). High cell counts are seen in conditions such as [[polycythemia]] (raised [[red blood cell]]s) or [[leukemia]] (more [[white blood cell]]s, especially in [[acute leukemic blast crisis|acute leukemic blast crises]]).

==Cause==

May occur with a white blood cell count greater than 100,000.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/780258-workup</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
Serum viscosity can be measured. Normal is between 1.4 and 1.8 [[centipoise]]s but to have symptoms from hyperviscosity, serum viscosity is usually greater than 5 centipoises. Patients will also have evidence of their underlying disorder. Those with [[myeloma]] will typically display a [[rouleaux]] formation on a peripheral smear and a large [[globulin]] gap, indicative of a significant [[paraprotein]] load. While viscosity can be directly measured, results can take a few days to return and thus a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis in a timely manner. If hyperviscosity is suspected, treatment may need to be started prior to obtaining the official viscosity level.

== Treatment ==
[[Plasmapheresis]] may be used to decrease viscosity in the case of myeloma, whereas [[leukapheresis]] or [[phlebotomy]] may be employed in a leukemic or polycythemic crisis, respectively. [[Blood transfusion]]s should be used with caution as they can increase serum viscosity. Hydration is a temporizing measure to employ while preparing pheresis. Even after treatment, the condition will recur unless the underlying disorder is treated.
