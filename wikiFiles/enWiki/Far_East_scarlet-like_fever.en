'''Far East scarlet-like fever''' or '''scarlatinoid fever''' is an infectious disease caused by the [[gram negative]] [[bacillus]] ''[[Yersinia pseudotuberculosis]]''. In Japan it is called '''Izumi fever'''.<ref name=Sato1983>Sato K, Ouchi K, Taki M (1983) ''Yersinia pseudotuberculosis'' infection in children, resembling Izumi fever and Kawasaki syndrome. Pediatr Infect Dis 2: 123–126</ref>

==History==

The first outbreak of this disease was reported from the [[Pacific]] coastal areas ([[Primorsky Krai]]) of [[Russia]] in the 1950s.

==Aetiology==

The cause of this disease is ''[[Yersinia pseudotuberculosis]]'' serotype O1. 95% are subtype O1b.

''Yersinia pseudotuberculosis'' has been divided into 6 genetic groups: group 1 has only been isolated from the Far East.<ref name=Fukushima2001>Fukushima H Matsuda Y, Seki R, Tsubokura M, Takeda N, Shubin FN, Paik IK, Zheng XB (2001) Geographical heterogeneity between Far Eastern and Western countries in prevalence of the virulence plasmid, the superantigen ''Yersinia pseudotuberculosis''-derived mitogen, and the high-pathogenicity island among ''Yersinia pseudotuberculosis'' strains. J Clin Microbiol 39:3541-3547</ref>

==Pathophysiology==

The clinical features of this disease appear to be due - at least in part - to the production of a superantigen - YpM ([[yersina pseudotuberculosis-derived mitogen]]). This is present in almost all strains from the Far East but only 20% of European isolates.<ref name=Yoshino1995>Yoshino K, Ramamurthy T, Nair GB, Fukushima H, Ohtomo Y, Takeda N, Kaneko S,  Takeda T (1995) Geographical heterogeneity between Far East and Europe in prevalence of ypm gene encoding the novel superantigen among ''Yersinia pseudotuberculosis'' strains. J Clin Microbiol 33(12) 3356-3358</ref> The antigen was discovered in 1993 and is encoded by a 456 base gene. The protein has 151 amino acids with a signal sequence of 20 amino acids. The mitogenic antigens are scattered across the protein but two [[cysteine]] residues (residues 32 and 129) which form a disulphide bridge are critical. 

The [[G+C]] content of this gene is 35% - lower than the genomic average (47%) suggesting that this gene has been acquired from some other organism.<ref name="Yoshino1995"/> The organism from which  this gene originated has not yet been identified. This gene seems likely to have been introduced into the genome by a [[bacteriophage]] given the nearby presence of a phage integration site but the mechanism of entry into the genome is not currently known.

*erythematous skin rash usually of the face, elbows and knees
*skin desquamation
*exanthema
*hyperaemic tongue
*toxic shock syndrome 

Other features include [[mesenteric lymphadenitis]] and [[arthritis]]. Renal failure while rare may occur. 

Relapses occur in up to 50% of patients.
