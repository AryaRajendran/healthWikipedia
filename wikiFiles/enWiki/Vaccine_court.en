'''Vaccine court''' is the popular term which refers to the Office of Special Masters of the [[U.S. Court of Federal Claims]], which administers a [[Strict liability|no-fault system]] for litigating [[vaccine injury]] claims. These claims against [[vaccine]] manufacturers cannot normally be filed in state or federal civil courts, but instead must be heard in the Court of Claims, sitting without a jury. The program was established by the 1986 [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]] (NCVIA), passed by the [[United States Congress]] in response to a threat to the vaccine supply due to a 1980s scare over the [[DPT vaccine]]. Despite the belief of most public health officials that claims of side effects were unfounded, large jury awards had been given to some plaintiffs, most DPT vaccine makers had ceased production, and officials feared the loss of [[herd immunity]].<ref name=Sugarman/>

Some parents of children with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s have [[MMR vaccine controversy|attributed the disorders' onset to vaccines]], often citing the mercury-based preservative [[thiomersal]] as the cause, and some have filed suit for compensation from vaccine makers. The medical and scientific communities near unanimously disregard [[MMR vaccine controversy|the link]] between [[Vaccination schedule|routine childhood vaccines]] and [[autism]], as no evidence has been found to support this.<ref name=Doja/>  

==National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act==
{{main|National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act}}
The U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] set up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) in 1988 to compensate individuals and families of individuals injured by covered childhood vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Emerg Med |year=2007 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=199–211 |title= Update on the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program |author= Edlich RF |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2007.01.001 |pmid=17692778 |author2= Olson DM |author3= Olson BM |display-authors= 3 |last4= Greene |first4= J |last5= Gubler |first5= K |last6= Winters |first6= K |last7= Kelley |first7= A |last8= Britt |first8= L |last9= Longiii |first9= W}}</ref> The VICP was adopted in response to a scare over the pertussis portion of the DPT vaccine.<ref name=Sugarman/> These claims were later generally discredited, but some U.S. lawsuits against vaccine makers won substantial awards; most makers ceased production, and the last remaining major manufacturer threatened to do so.<ref name=Sugarman/> The VICP uses a [[No fault insurance|no-fault]] system for resolving vaccine injury claims.<ref name=Sugarman/> Compensation covers medical and legal expenses, loss of future earning capacity, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering; a death benefit of up to $250,000 is also available. If certain minimal requirements are met, legal expenses are compensated even for unsuccessful claims.<ref name=filing-claim/> Since 1988, the program has been funded by an excise tax of 75 cents on every purchased dose of covered vaccine. To win an award, a claimant must show a causal connection; if medical records show a child has one of several listed adverse effects soon after vaccination, the assumption is that it was caused by the vaccine. The burden of proof is the civil-law preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in other words a showing that causation was more likely than not. Denied claims can be pursued in civil courts, though this is rare.<ref name=Sugarman/>

The VICP covers all vaccines listed on the Vaccine Injury Table maintained by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; in 2007 the list included vaccines against [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]] (whooping cough), [[measles]], [[mumps]], [[rubella]] (German measles), [[polio]], [[hepatitis B]], [[varicella]] (chicken pox), [[Haemophilus influenzae type b|''Haemophilus influenzae'' type b]], [[rotavirus]], and [[pneumonia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/table.htm |title= Vaccine Injury Table |publisher= Health Resources and Services Administration |date=2007 |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> From 1988 until 2008-01-08, 5,263 claims relating to autism, and 2,865 non-autism claims, were made to the VICP. 925 of these claims, one autism-related (see [[#Previous_rulings|Previous Rulings]]), were compensated, with 1,158 non-autism and 350 autism claims dismissed; awards (including attorney's fees) totaled $847 million.<ref name=NVICP-stats/> The VICP also applies to claims for injuries suffered before 1988; there were 4,264 of these claims of which 1,189 were compensated with awards totaling $903 million.<ref name=NVICP-stats>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm |accessdate=2008-01-22 |date=2008-01-08 |title= National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program statistics reports |publisher= Health Resources and Services Administration}}</ref>

Filing a claim with the Court of Federal Claims requires a $250 filing fee, which can be waived for those unable to pay. Medical records such as prenatal, birth, pre-vaccination, vaccination, and post-vaccination records are strongly suggested, as medical review and claim processing may be delayed without them. Because this is a legal process most people use a lawyer, though this is not required.<ref name=filing-claim>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/filing_claim.htm |title= Filing a claim with the VICP |publisher= Health Resources and Services Administration |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> By 1999 the average claim took two years to resolve, and 42% of resolved claims were awarded compensation, as compared with 23% for [[medical malpractice]] claims through the [[tort]] system.<ref name=Balbier>{{cite web |url=http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990928b.html |title= Statement on National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program |author= Balbier TE Jr |publisher= U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date=1999-09-28 |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> There are legal time limits for filing claims.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} As with any benefit program, eligibility requirements seem unfair to some applicants.<ref name=Balbier/>

Several claimants have attempted to bypass the VICP process, with some successes so far. They have demanded medical monitoring for vaccinated children who do not show signs of autism, and have filed class-action suits on behalf of parents.<ref name=Sugarman>{{cite journal |journal= N Engl J Med |year=2007 |volume=357 |issue=13 |pages=1275–7 |title= Cases in vaccine court—legal battles over vaccines and autism |author= Sugarman SD |pmid=17898095 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/13/1275 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMp078168}}</ref> In March 2006, the [[U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that plaintiffs suing three manufacturers of [[thiomersal]] could bypass the vaccine court and litigate in either state or federal court utilizing the ordinary channels for recovery in [[tort]] (Holder v. [[Abbott Laboratories]] Inc., 444 F.3d 383). This is the first instance where a federal appeals court has held that a suit of this nature may bypass the vaccine court. The argument was that thiomersal is a preservative, not a vaccine, so it does not fall under the provisions of the vaccine act.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=ABA J |volume=92 |issue=7 |pages=19, 43 |date=2006 |author=Davis WN |title=No longer immune |url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/no_longer_immune/ }}</ref>

==Homeland Security Act==

The [[Homeland Security Act]] of 2002 provides another exception to the exclusive jurisdiction of the vaccine court. If [[smallpox]] vaccine were to be widely administered by public health authorities in response to a terrorist or other biological warfare attack, persons administering or producing the vaccine would be deemed federal employees and claims would be subject to the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]], in which case claimants would sue the U.S. Government in the U.S. district courts, and would have the burden of proving the defendants' negligence, a much more difficult standard.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DC1E3AF937A25751C1A9649C8B63 |title= Threats and responses: legal risks; for victims of vaccine, winning case will be hard |author= Pear R |work= New York Times |date=2002-12-14 |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

==Previous rulings==
 
A 2005 [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] ruling held that an award should be granted if a petitioner either establishes a "Table Injury" or proves "causation in fact" by proving the following three prongs: 
<blockquote>
# a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; 
# a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and 
# a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.<ref>[http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/04-5146.pdf Althen v. HHS.] This is a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which is binding upon the United States Court of Federal Claims; clarified the standing for proving "causation in fact" absent a "Table Injury" under [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00000300--aa011-.html 42 U.S.C. 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)]</ref>
</blockquote>

This ruling held that [[tetanus]] vaccine caused a particular case of [[optic neuritis]] even though no scientific evidence supported the petitioner's claim.<ref name=Offit/> Other rulings have allowed petitioners to gain awards for claims that the [[MMR vaccine]] causes [[fibromyalgia]], that the [[Hib vaccine]] causes [[transverse myelitis]], and that the [[hepatitis B vaccine]] causes [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name=Offit/> In the most extreme of these cases, a 2006 petitioner successfully claimed that a hepatitis B vaccine caused her multiple sclerosis despite several studies showing that the vaccine neither causes nor worsens the disease, and despite a conclusion by the [[Institute of Medicine]] that evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship.<ref name=Offit/>

In 2008 the federal government agreed to award damages to the family of Hannah Poling, a girl who developed autistic-like symptoms after receiving a series of vaccines in a single day.<ref>{{cite news |author= Rovner J |title= Case stokes debate about autism, vaccines |work= NPR |date=2008-03-07 |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87974932 |accessdate=2008-03-07}}</ref> The vaccines given were [[DTaP vaccine|DTaP]], [[Hib vaccine|Hib]], [[MMR vaccine|MMR]], [[Varicella vaccine|varicella]], and [[Inactivated polio vaccine|inactivated polio]]. Poling was diagnosed months later with [[encephalopathy]] (brain disease) caused by a mitochondrial enzyme deficit, a [[mitochondrial disorder]]; it is not unusual for children with such deficits to develop neurologic signs between their first and second years. <ref name=Offit>{{cite journal |journal= N Engl J Med |year=2008 |volume=358 |issue=20 |pages=2089–91 |title= Vaccines and autism revisited—the Hannah Poling case |author= Offit PA |pmid=18480200 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/20/2089 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMp0802904 |authorlink= Paul Offit}}</ref> There is little scientific research in the area: no scientific studies show whether childhood vaccines can cause or contribute to mitochondrial disease,<ref>{{cite news |author= Stobbe M, Marchione M |title=  Analysis: vaccine-autism link unproven |work= Associated Press |date=2008-03-07 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2008/03/07/analysis_vaccine_payment_no_landmark/ |accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> and there is no scientific evidence that vaccinations damage the brains of children with mitochondrial disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Acta Paediatr |date=2008 |volume=97 |issue=7 |pages=859–60 |title= Autistic spectrum disorders and mitochondrial encephalopathies |author= Holtzman D |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00883.x |pmid=18532934}}</ref> Although many parents view this ruling as confirming that vaccines cause regressive autism, most children with autism do not seem to have mitochondrial disorders, and the case was conceded without proof of causation.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Clin Invest |date=2008 |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=1586–7 |title= Attention focuses on autism |author= Honey K |doi=10.1172/JCI35821 |pmid=18451989 |url=http://jci.org/articles/view/35821 |pmc= 2336894}}</ref>

With the commencement of hearings in the case of ''Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services'' (Case #98-916V), the battle over vaccine injuries moved into the courts.  A panel of three special masters began hearing the first cases of the historic Omnibus Autism Proceedings in June 2007. The lead petitioners, the parents of Michelle Cedillo, claimed that Michelle's autism was caused by a vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo contended that [[thiomersal]] seriously weakened Michelle's [[immune system]] and prevented her body from clearing the [[measles]] virus after her vaccination at the age of fifteen months. At the outset Special Master George Hastings, Jr. said "Clearly the story of Michelle's life is a tragic one,"<ref>{{cite news |title= Children with autism get day in court |author= Bridges A |work= USA Today |date=2007-06-12 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-06-11-3419893127_x.htm |accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref> while pledging to listen carefully to the evidence. On February 12, 2009, the court ruled in three test cases that the combination of the MMR vaccine and thiomersal-containing vaccines were not to blame for autism. Hastings concluded in his decision, "Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment."<ref>{{cite news |author= Freking K, Neergaard L |title= Court says vaccine not to blame for autism |work= Associated Press |date=2009-02-12 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/02/12/washington/AP-Autism-Ruling.html |accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref> The ruling has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals.<ref name=Maugh-Zajac/>

===Petitioner’s Burden of Proof===

A petitioner seeking to establish causation-in-fact must show, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that but for her vaccination she would not have been injured, and that the vaccination
was a substantial factor in bringing about her injury. Shyface, 165 F.3d at 1352. Mere temporal
association is not sufficient to prove causation in fact; a petitioner must present a medical theory
that is supported either by medical records or by the opinion of a competent physician. Grant v.
Sec’y of Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 956 F.2d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Proof of actual
causation must be supported by a sound and reliable “medical or scientific explanation that
pertains specifically to the petitioner’s case, although the explanation need only be ‘legally
probable, not medically or scientifically certain.’” Moberly, 592 F.3d at 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2010)
(quoting Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 548-49); see also Grant, 956 F.2d at 1148 (medical theory must
support actual cause).
The preponderance of evidence standard under the Vaccine Act requires proof that a
vaccine more likely than not caused the vaccinee’s injury. Althen, 418 F.3d at 1279. Causation
is determined on a case-by-case basis, with “no hard and fast per se scientific or medical rules.”
Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 548. 
On March 13, 2010, the court ruled in three test cases that thiomersal-containing vaccines do not cause autism. The test cases were among the strongest for this theory. Special Master Hastings concluded, "The overall weight of the evidence is overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners' causation theories."<ref name=Maugh-Zajac>{{cite news |author=Maugh TH II, Zajac A |title='Vaccines court' rejects mercury–autism link in 3 test cases |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-sci-autism13-2010mar13,0,5900639.story |date=2010-03-13 }}</ref>

==Current proceedings==

Currently, nearly 5,000 families are attempting to demonstrate that vaccines can cause [[autism]], despite the medical and scientific consensus that there is no evidence that autism is caused by vaccines or any preservative or additive ever used in vaccines.<ref name=Doja>{{cite journal |journal=Can J Neurol Sci |date=2006 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=341–6 |title=Immunizations and autism: a review of the literature |author= Doja A, Roberts W |pmid=17168158 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Paul R |title=Parents ask: am I risking autism if I vaccinate my children? |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=962–3 |year=2009 |pmid=19363650 |doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0739-y }}</ref>
