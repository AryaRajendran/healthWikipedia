The '''Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin''' is the [[medical school]] for both the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] and the [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]] of [[Berlin]]. After the merger with their fourth campus in 2003, the Charité is one of the largest [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]] in Europe.<ref>[http://www.charite.de/en/charite/organization/history/ Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
Complying with an order of King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] from November 14, 1709, it was initially established in 1710 north of the Berlin city walls in anticipation of an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] that already had depopulated [[East Prussia]]. After the plague spared the city it came to be used as a charity hospital for the poor. On January 9, 1727 [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] gave it the name Charité, meaning "charity".<ref>[http://www.charite.de/ch/neuro/lokales/charite/geschichte.html History of the Charite<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The construction of an [[anatomical theatre]] in 1713 marks the beginning of the medical school, then supervised by the ''collegium medico-chirurgicum'' of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.charite-research.org/aboutus_charite_history.html Die Berliner Charité: From Collegium Medico-chirurgicum zum Universitätsklinikum]</ref> 1795 saw the establishment of the ''Pépinière'' school for the education of [[combat medic|military surgeons]]. 

After the University of Berlin (today [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]]) had been founded in 1810, the dean of the medical college [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]] in 1828 integrated the Charité as a teaching hospital. [[Rudolf Virchow]], once student at the ''Pépinière'', worked with anatomist [[Robert Froriep]] as [[prosector]] here and in 1856 became director of the newly created institute of [[pathology]], where he developed his [[cell theory]].

After the partition of Berlin in 1949 the Charité in Mitte remained the main hospital of [[East Berlin]] affiliated with the Humboldt University, while the [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]] of [[West Berlin]] had the ''Klinikum Steglitz'' erected in 1968 backed by the [[United States|US]] ''Benjamin Franklin Foundation'' of [[Eleanor Lansing Dulles]]. In 1986 the town's Rudolf Virchow Hospital became the second medical school of the Free University. When after reunification the city of Berlin had to deal with three university hospitals, all were finally merged as sites of the Charité in 2003. The reorganization is still in progress.
