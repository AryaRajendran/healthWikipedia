'''Rhinitis''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|r|aɪ|ˈ|n|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}}) is a medical term for irritation and inflammation of the [[mucous membrane]] inside the [[human nose|nose]]. Common symptoms of rhinitis are a [[nasal congestion|stuffy nose]], [[rhinorrhea|runny nose]], and [[post-nasal drip]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nonallergic-rhinitis/DS00809/DSECTION=symptoms | title=Nonallergic rhinitis}}</ref>  The most common kind of rhinitis is [[allergic rhinitis]],<ref name="meds">{{cite web | url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/134825-overview | title=Allergic rhinitis}}</ref> which is usually triggered by airborne [[allergen]]s such as [[pollen]] and [[animal dander|dander]].<ref>{{cite book |last1= Sullivan, Jr. |first1= John B. |last2= Krieger |first2= Gary R. |title= Clinical environmental health and toxic exposures |year= 2001 |page= 341}}</ref>  Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal itching, coughing, headache,<ref name="umm">{{cite web | url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/allergic-rhinitis-000003.htm | title=Allergic rhinitis}}</ref> [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[malaise]], and cognitive impairment.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16719251 |year=2006 |last1=Quillen |first1=DM |last2=Feller |first2=DB |title=Diagnosing rhinitis: Allergic vs. Nonallergic |volume=73 |issue=9 |pages=1583–90 |journal=American family physician}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62038-8 |title=Decrements in vigilance and cognitive functioning associated with ragweed-induced allergic rhinitis |year=2002 |last1=Wilken |first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Berkowitz |first2=Robert |last3=Kane |first3=Robert |journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=372}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62273-9 |title=Effects of seasonal allergic rhinitis on selected cognitive abilities |year=2000 |last1=Marshall |first1=Paul S. |last2=O'Hara |first2=Christine |last3=Steinberg |first3=Paul |journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=403}}</ref>  The allergens may also affect the eyes, causing watery, reddened or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes.<ref name="umm" />

Rhinitis is very common.  [[Allergic rhinitis]] is more common in some countries than others; in the United States, about 
10%-30% of adults are affected annually.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/472667_2 | title=Economic Impact and Quality-of-Life Burden of Allergic Rhinitis: Prevalence}}</ref> 

In rhinitis, the [[inflammation]] of the [[mucous membrane]] is caused by [[Virus|viruses]], [[bacteria]], irritants or [[allergens]]. The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of [[mucus]], commonly producing a [[rhinorrhea|runny nose]], as well as a [[nasal congestion|stuffy nose]] and [[post-nasal drip]]. In the case of [[allergic rhinitis]], the inflammation is caused by the degranulation of [[mast cell]]s in the nose.  When mast cells degranulate, they release [[histamine]] and other chemicals,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/532192_2 |title=Inflammatory Nature of Allergic Rhinitis: Pathophysiology}}</ref>  starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose, such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and [[malaise]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espai-eg.org/Journal/8-1/Deraz.pdf |title=Immunopathogenesis of allergic rhinitis}}</ref>

==Types==
Rhinitis is categorized into three types: (i) infective rhinitis includes acute and chronic bacterial infections; (ii) [[vasomotor rhinitis|nonallergic (vasomotor) rhinitis]] includes autonomic, hormonal, drug-induced, atrophic, and gustatory rhinitis, as well as [[rhinitis medicamentosa]]; (iii) [[allergic rhinitis]], triggered by pollen, mold, animal [[dander]], dust and other similar inhaled allergens.<ref name="meds"/>

===Infectious===
{{See also|Common cold|Sinusitis}}
Rhinitis is commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection, including the common cold, which is caused by [[Rhinovirus]]es and [[Coronavirus]]es, or bacterial [[sinusitis]]. Symptoms of the common cold include [[rhinorrhea]], sore throat ([[pharyngitis]]), [[cough]], [[Nasal congestion|congestion]], and slight [[headache]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Vasomotor rhinitis==
Non-allergic rhinitis refers to runny nose that is not due to allergy. Non-allergic rhinitis can be classified as either non-inflammatory or inflammatory rhinitis. One very common type of non-inflammatory, non-allergic rhinitis that is sometimes confused with allergy is called vasomotor rhinitis,<ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001648.htm Vasomotor rhinitis ''Medline Plus''</ref> in which certain nonspecific stimuli, including changes in environment (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, or weather); airborne irritants (odors, fumes); dietary factors (spicy food, alcohol); sexual arousal; and emotional factors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Adelman|first=Daniel|title=Manual of Allergy and Immunology: Diagnosis and Therapy|year=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9780781730525|pages=66}}</ref>  There is still much to be learned about this entity, but it is thought that these non-allergic triggers cause dilation of the blood vessels in the lining of the nose, which results in swelling, and drainage. Vasomotor rhinitis can coexist with allergic rhinitis, and this is called "mixed rhinitis." (Middleton's Allergy Principles and Practice, seventh edition.) The pathology of vasomotor rhinitis appears to involve [[neurogenic inflammation]]<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18651116 |year=2008 |last1=Knipping |first1=S |last2=Holzhausen |first2=HJ |last3=Riederer |first3=A |last4=Schrom |first4=T |title=Ultrastructural changes in allergic rhinitis vs. Idiopathic rhinitis |volume=56 |issue=8 |pages=799–807 |doi=10.1007/s00106-008-1764-4 |journal=HNO}}</ref> and is as yet not very well understood. Vasomotor rhinitis appears to be significantly more common in women than men, leading some researchers to believe that hormones play a role. In general, age of onset occurs after 20 years of age, in contrast to allergic rhinitis which can be developed at any age. Individuals suffering from vasomotor rhinitis typically experience symptoms year-round, though symptoms may be exacerbated in the spring and autumn when rapid weather changes are more common.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16190503 |year=2005 |last1=Wheeler |first1=PW |last2=Wheeler |first2=SF |title=Vasomotor rhinitis |volume=72 |issue=6 |pages=1057–62 |journal=American family physician}}</ref> An estimated 17 million [[United States]] citizens have vasomotor rhinitis.  The antihistamines azelastine  and olopatadine, applied as nasal sprays, may both be effective for vasomotor rhinitis.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1185/030079907X226302 |title=Azelastine hydrochloride:a review of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and tolerability |year=2007 |last1=Bernstein |first1=Jonathan A. |journal=Current Medical Research and Opinion |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=2441–52 |pmid=17723160}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Two-week comparison study of olopatadine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.6% versus azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray 0.1% in patients with vasomotor rhinitis |year=2011 |author=Lieberman P, Meltzer EO, LaForce CF, Darter AL, Tort MJ. |journal=Allergy Asthma Proc. |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=151–8 |pmid=21352639}}</ref>  [[Fluticasone propionate]] or [[budesonide]] (both are [[steroid]]s) in nostril spray form may also be used for symptomatic treatment.

===Allergic===
{{Main|Allergic rhinitis}}
[[Image:Misc pollen.jpg|thumb|[[Pollen]] grains from a variety of common plants can cause ''hay fever''.]]
Allergic rhinitis or hay fever may follow when an allergen such as pollen or dust is inhaled by an individual with a sensitized immune system, triggering [[antibody]] production. These antibodies mostly bind to [[mast cells]], which contain [[histamine]]. When the mast cells are stimulated by pollen and dust, histamine (and other chemicals) are released. This causes itching, swelling, and [[mucus]] production. Symptoms vary in severity between individuals. Very sensitive individuals can experience [[hives]] or other [[rash]]es. Particulate matter in polluted air and chemicals such as [[chlorine]] and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can greatly aggravate the condition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Characteristic physical findings in individuals who have allergic rhinitis include conjunctival swelling and erythema, eyelid swelling, lower eyelid venous stasis, lateral crease on the nose, swollen nasal turbinates, and middle ear effusion.<ref>Valet RS, Fahrenholz JM. [http://www.consultantlive.com/display/article/10162/1465701 Allergic rhinitis: update on diagnosis]. Consultant. 2009;49:610-613</ref>

Even if a person has negative [[skin allergy test|skin-prick, intradermal]] and [[RAST test|blood tests]] for allergies, they may still have allergic rhinitis, from a local allergy in the nose.  This is called [[allergic rhinitis#Local allergic rhinitis|local allergic rhinitis]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e328334f5fb |title=Local allergic rhinitis: A new entity, characterization and further studies |year=2010 |last1=Rondón |first1=Carmen |last2=Canto |first2=Gabriela |last3=Blanca |first3=Miguel |journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=10 |pages=1–7 |pmid=20010094 |issue=1}}</ref> Many people who were previously diagnosed with nonallergic rhinitis may actually have local allergic rhinitis.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20945601 |year=2010 |last1=Rondón |first1=C |last2=Fernandez |first2=J |last3=Canto |first3=G |last4=Blanca |first4=M |title=Local allergic rhinitis: Concept, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic approach |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=364–71; quiz 2 p following 371 |journal=Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology}}</ref>

===Rhinitis medicamentosa===
{{Main|Rhinitis medicamentosa}}
It is a condition of [[Rebound effect|rebound]] [[nasal congestion]] brought on by extended use of [[topical decongestant]]s (''e.g.'', [[oxymetazoline]], [[phenylephrine]], [[xylometazoline]], and [[naphazoline]] [[nasal spray]]s) that work by constricting blood vessels in the lining of the nose.

===Chronic atrophic rhinitis===
{{main|Chronic atrophic rhinitis}}
Chronic rhinitis in form of [[atrophy]] of the mucous membrane and glands.

===Rhinitis sicca===
Chronic form of dryness of the mucous membranes.

===Polypous rhinitis===
Chronic rhinitis associated with [[Polyp (medicine)|polyps]] in the nasal cavity.

==Management==
The management of rhinitis depends on the underlying cause. High-dose administration of [[Vitamin B12]] has been additionally validated to stimulate the activity of the body's TH1 suppressor T-Cells, which then down-regulates the over-production of the allergen antibody IgE in allergic individuals which could decrease both near and long term manifestations of rhinitis symptomology.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=O'Conner, Richard D.
