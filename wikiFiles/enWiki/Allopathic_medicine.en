'''Allopathic medicine''' is an expression commonly used by [[Homeopathy|homeopaths]] and proponents of other forms of [[alternative medicine]] to refer to [[medicine|mainstream medical]] use of pharmacologically active [[Active ingredient|agents]] or [[Surgery|physical interventions]] to treat or suppress [[symptoms]] or [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] processes of diseases or conditions.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/allopathy thefreedictionary.com > allopathy] Citing: Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine. Copyright 2008 and Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. © 200</ref>  The expression was coined in 1810 by the creator of homeopathy, [[Samuel Hahnemann]] (1755–1843). 
Never accepted as a mainstream scientific term, it was adopted by alternative medicine advocates to refer [[pejorative]]ly to mainstream medicine.<ref name=Whorton2004/> In such circles, the expression "allopathic medicine" is still used to refer to "the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, [[biomedicine]], [[evidence-based medicine]], or modern medicine".<ref name=WHO>{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf|title=Legal Status of Traditional Medicine and Complementary/Alternative Medicine: A Worldwide Review|accessdate=2007-09-12|year=2001|author=Xiaorui Zhang|publisher=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070926083307/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_EDM_TRM_2001.2.pdf| archivedate= 26 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Allopathic medicine and allopathy (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix ''ἄλλος'', ''állos'', "other", "different" + the suffix ''πάϑος'', ''páthos'', "suffering") are terms coined in the early 19th century<ref>Hahnemann S (1810), [[The Organon of the Healing Art|Organon der Heilkunst]], first edition.</ref> by Samuel Hahnemann,<ref name=Whorton2004>{{cite book|title = Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America|author=Whorton JC|edition=illustrated|editor=[[Oxford University Press US]]|year=2004|isbn=0-19-517162-4|pages = 18, 52|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RU0DndWVSPoC&pg=PA18&vq=allopathy+allopathic+greek+hahnemann|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=wf2vl2ch9a4C&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234&dq=allopathy&ots=pAfm6X3vNP&sig=uxnaBWPzkiigd6ThpYWk_UdNZ-w Haehl R, ''Samuel Hahnemann his Life and Works,'' 2 volumes, 1922; vol 2, p.234]</ref> the founder of homeopathy, as a synonym for mainstream medicine.

==History==
The practice of medicine in both Europe and North America during the early 19th century is sometimes referred to as [[heroic medicine]] because of the extreme measures (such as [[bloodletting]]) sometimes employed in an effort to treat diseases.<ref name = Trick>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=bZjlC2LELlIC&pg=PA108 | page = 108 | title = Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | first = Simon | last = Singh | first2 = Edzard | last2 = Ernst | publisher = W.

With the term allopathy (meaning "other than the disease"), Hahnemann intended to point out how physicians with conventional training employed therapeutic approaches that, in his view, merely treated symptoms and failed to address the disharmony produced by the underlying disease.{{clarify|date=March 2011}} Homeopaths saw such [[symptomatic treatment]]s as "opposites treating opposites" and believed these conventional methods were harmful to patients.<ref name=Whorton2004/>

Practitioners of alternative medicine have used the term "allopathic medicine" to refer to the practice of conventional medicine in both Europe and the United States since the 19th century. The term allopathic was used throughout the 19th century as a derogatory term for the practitioners of heroic medicine,<ref name="DOI 10.1177/0002716202583001002">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/000271620258300102 |journal=The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=September 2002 |volume=583 |issue=1 |pages=12–28 |title=Why Not Call Modern Medicine "Alternative"? |last=Bates|first=DG }}</ref><ref name="isbn0-7637-3888-3">{{cite book |author=Cuellar NG|title=Conversations in complementary and alternative medicine: insights and perspectives from leading practitioners |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=4 |isbn=0-7637-3888-3 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nmkm7zu7NDMC}}</ref> a precursor to modern medicine that did not rely on evidence.

James Whorton discusses this historical pejorative usage: {{quote|One form of verbal warfare used in retaliation by irregulars was the word "allopathy." ..."Allopathy" and "allopathic" were liberally employed as pejoratives by all irregular physicians of the nineteenth century, and the terms were considered highly offensive by those at whom they were directed. The generally uncomplaining acceptance of [the term] "allopathic medicine" by today's physicians is an indication of both a lack of awareness of the term's historical use and the recent thawing of relations between irregulars and allopaths.<ref name=Whorton2003/>}}

The controversy surrounding the term can be traced to its original usage during a heated 19th-century debate between practitioners of homeopathy and those they derisively referred to as "allopaths."<ref name=Whorton2002>{{cite book |last=Whorton |first=JC |year=2002 |title=Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America |isbn=0-19-517162-4 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>

Hahnemann used "allopathy" to refer to what he saw as a system of medicine that combats disease by using remedies that produce effects in a healthy subject that are different (hence Greek root ''allo-'' "different") from the effects produced by the disease to be treated. The distinction comes from the use in homeopathy of substances that cause similar effects as the symptoms of a disease to treat patients (''homeo'' - meaning similar).

As used by homeopaths, the term ''allopathy'' has always referred to the principle of curing disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for [[fever]] may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an [[Antibacterial|antibiotic]]) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). A homeopathic treatment for fever, by contrast, is one that uses a diluted and succussed dosage of a substance that in an undiluted and unsuccussed form would induce fever in a healthy person. Hahnemann used this term to distinguish medicine as practiced in his time from his use of infinitesimally small doses of substances to treat the spiritual causes of illness.

The ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine'' states that "Hahnemann gave an all-embracing name to regular practice, calling it 'allopathy'. This term, however imprecise, was employed by his followers or other unorthodox movements to identify the prevailing methods as constituting nothing more than a competing 'school' of medicine, however dominant in terms of number of practitioner proponents and patients." In the nineteenth century, some pharmacies labeled their products with the terms allopathic or homeopathic.

Contrary to the present usage, Hahnemann reserved the term "allopathic medicine" to the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs inducing symptoms unrelated (i.e., neither similar nor opposite) to those of the disease. He called the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs producing symptoms opposite to those of the patient "enantiopathic" or "antipathic medicine".<ref>e.g., see [http://books.google.com/books?id=n3YC435gKFIC& Organon, VI edition], paragraphs 54-56</ref> After Hahnemann's death, the term "enantiopathy" fell into disuse and the two concepts of allopathy and enantiopathy have been more or less unified. Both, however, indicate what Hahnemann thought about contemporary conventional medicine, rather than the current ideas of his colleagues. Conventional physicians had never assumed that the therapeutic effects of drugs were necessarily related to the symptoms they caused in the healthy: e.g., James Lind in 1747 systematically tested several common substances and foods for their effect on scurvy and discovered that lemon juice was specifically active; he clearly did not select lemon juice because it caused symptoms in the healthy man, either similar or opposite to those of scurvy.

==Current==
Use of the term remains common among homeopaths and has spread to other [[alternative medicine]] practices. The meaning implied by the label has never been accepted by conventional medicine and is still considered pejorative by some.<ref name=Atwood2004>{{cite journal |author=Atwood KC |title=Naturopathy, pseudoscience, and medicine: myths and fallacies vs truth |journal=Medscape General Medicine |volume=6|issue=1|pages=33|year=2004|pmid=15208545|pmc=1140750 }}</ref> More recently, some sources have used the term "allopathic", particularly American sources wishing to distinguish between [[Comparison of MD and DO in the United States|Doctors of Medicine (MD) and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) in the United States]].<ref name="isbn0-7637-3888-3">{{cite book |author=Cuellar NG |title=Conversations in complementary and alternative medicine: insights and perspectives from leading practitioners|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Boston|year=2006|pages=4|isbn=0-7637-3888-3}}</ref><ref name=Whorton2003>{{cite web |author=Whorton JC |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/altmed/clash/history.html |title=Counterculture healing: A brief history of alternative medicine in America |date=4 Nov 2003 |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=25 Dec 2007}}</ref><ref name=NRMP>[http://www.nrmp.org//res_match/special_part/ind_app/registration.html National Resident Matching Program]</ref> William Jarvis, an expert on alternative medicine and public health,<ref name="Closer to Truth Participants| PBS">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/kcet/closertotruth/participants/index3.html|work=Closer to Truth |title=Participants |accessdate=2008-03-22 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080420042924/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/closertotruth/participants/index3.html |archivedate=20 April 2008 |deadurl=no}}</ref> states that "although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle" and that the label "allopath" was "considered highly derisive by regular medicine."<ref name=Jarvis>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahf.org/articles/a-b/allopathy.html |title=Misuse of the term "Allopathy" |accessdate=2013-02-07 |last=Jarvis |first=William T. |date=1996 |publisher=[[National Council Against Health Fraud]]}}</ref>

However, many conventional medical treatments do not fit this definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or remove the cause of an illness by acting on the [[etiology]] of disease.<ref name=Berkenwald1998>{{cite journal|title=In the name of medicine|journal=[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]|year=1998|first=AD|last=Berkenwald|volume=128|pages=246–50|url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/3/246|issue=3|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-128-3-199802010-00023 }}</ref><ref name=Federspil2003>{{cite journal|author=Federspil G|coauthors=Presotto F, Vettor R|year=2003|title=A critical overview of homeopathy|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=139|issue=8|url=http://annals.highwire.org/cgi/content/full/139/8/W-75 }}</ref>
