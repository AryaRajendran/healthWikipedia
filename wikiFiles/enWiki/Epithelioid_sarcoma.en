'''Epithelioid sarcoma''' is a rare mesenchymal soft tissue [[tumour]] with an epithelioid pattern. It often occurs in the extremities, and is more commonly found in young adults.<ref name=pmid10452506>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Miettinen | first1 = M. | last2 = Fanburg-Smith | first2 = JC. | last3 = Virolainen | first3 = M. | last4 = Shmookler | first4 = BM. | last5 = Fetsch | first5 = JF. | title = Epithelioid sarcoma: an immunohistochemical analysis of 112 classical and variant cases and a discussion of the differential diagnosis. | journal = Hum Pathol | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 934–42 | month = Aug | year = 1999 | doi =  | PMID = 10452506 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The [[diagnosis]] is made by examination of tissue, e.g. a [[biopsy]].  The diagnosis may be delayed because of the unusual nature of the tumour and its rarity. Its [[histomorphology]] near perfectly may mimic an [[adenocarcinoma]], [[melanoma]] or [[granuloma]].  

Their [[immunohistochemical]] profile may mimic those of carcinomas; thus, these tumours may be misdiagnosed as such.

They typically stain for [[vimentin]] and [[keratin]]s.  They characteristically have loss of staining for [[SMARCB1]] (INI1, BAF47), and typically stain for [[CA125]].<ref name=pmid15078911>{{cite journal |author=Kato H, Hatori M, Kokubun S, ''et al.'' |title=CA125 expression in epithelioid sarcoma |journal=Jpn.
