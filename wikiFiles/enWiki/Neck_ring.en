'''Neck rings''' are one or more spiral metal coils of many turns worn as an ornament around the [[neck]] of an individual. In a few African and Asian cultures neck rings are worn usually to create the appearance that the neck has been stretched. '''Padaung''' ([[Kayan Lahwi]])  women of the [[Kayan (Burma)|Kayan people]] begin to wear neck coils from as young as age two. The length of the coil is gradually increased to as much as twenty turns. The weight of the coils will eventually place sufficient pressure on the shoulder blade to cause it to deform and create an impression of a longer neck. <ref name+sp>"[http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2007/05/16/bound-by-tradition/ Bound by tradition]", ''New Mandala''.</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL8ARB5FmsA Padaung] ''National Geographic'' film</ref>

The custom of wearing neck rings is related to an ideal of beauty: an elongated neck. Neck rings push the [[collarbone]] and [[ribs]] down.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7215182.stm Burmese women in Thai 'human zoo']. [[BBC News]]. (January 2008)</ref> The neck stretching is mostly illusory: the weight of the rings twists the collar bone and eventually the upper ribs at an angle 45 degrees lower than what is natural, causing the illusion of an elongated neck. The vertebrae do not elongate, though the space between them may increase as the [[intervertebral disc]]s absorb liquid.

The [[South Ndebele people]]s of Africa also wear neck rings as part of their traditional dress and as a sign of wealth and status. Only married women are allowed to wear the rings, called "dzilla". Metal rings are also worn on different parts of the body, not just the neck.<ref>[http://www.info.gov.za/vukuzenzele/2007/number14/art_12.htm Vuk'uzenzele, November 2007]</ref> The rings are usually made of copper or brass.

==Tourism==

Tourism is often considered to encourage the use of neck rings in Asia, as they are a popular attraction for tourists.<ref>[http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14378 Padaung Women are Discarding their Neck Rings]</ref>

Small girls in Asia may wear brass collars from the age of two to five years old, as it is more comfortable to lengthen the neck slowly. The alternative is rapid and painful lengthening of the neck at around the age of twelve, when girls first begin to compete for the attention of boys. [[Marco Polo]] was the first tourist to describe the practice in c.1300. Refugee practitioners in [[Thailand]] were first accessible to tourists in 1984.
