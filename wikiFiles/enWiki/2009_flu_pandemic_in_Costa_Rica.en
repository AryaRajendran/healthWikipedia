==July and August contagion surge==

As a result of a wave of new cases that occurred by early July, the Ministry of Health announced a new strategy to deal with this peak that resulted in increased deaths. Beginning July 11, 2009, testing for the virus will be conducted only on patients with risk factors and critical cases, including those with fever above 39 [[Celsius degree|<sup>o</sup>C]] and patients with respiratory difficulties, as the main objective now is to reduce mortality rather than avoid contagion.<ref name="Oficial">{{cite web|url=http://www.ministeriodesalud.go.cr/emergencia_sanitaria/directrices_para_la_pandemia_de_influenza_ah1n1.pdf|format=pdf|title=Directrices para la pandemia de influenza AH1N1: Actualización al 13 de julio de 2009|publisher=Ministerio de Salud de Costa Rica |date=13-07-2009 |accessdate=2009-07-13|language=Spanish}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}} ''As a result of new health policies, statistics regarding the number of cases will no longer reflect the total number of actual cases as the Ministry of Health decided to concentrate testing only on patients with risk factors and critical cases, beginning July 11, 2009.''</ref>  This policy means that statistics regarding the number of cases will no longer reflect the total number of actual cases.

On July 21 the Ministry of Health, in agreement with the [[Catholic Church]], and in order to prevent a massive contagion, prohibited the traditional [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles (Basílica)|Basílica de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles]] (Our Lady of the Angels Basilica), patroness of catholic Costa Ricans. This pilgrimage takes places every year on August 1 since 227 years ago, and this is the first time ever that is suspended.<ref name=Romeria>{{cite web |url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2009/julio/21/pais2034375.html|title=Cancelación de romería rompe tradición de 227 años |publisher=[[La Nación (Costa Rica)|La Nación]]|date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2009-07-22|language=Spanish}}</ref> Health authorities estimate the risk of contagion in 20,000 people, as around two million pilgrims would have participated in this traditional religious event.<ref name=Romeria/>
