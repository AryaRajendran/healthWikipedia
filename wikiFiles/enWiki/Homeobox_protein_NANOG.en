'''NANOG''' (pron. nanOg) is a [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] factor critically involved with self-renewal of undifferentiated [[embryonic stem cell]]s. In humans, this protein is encoded by the ''NANOG'' [[gene]].<ref name="pmid12787504">{{cite journal | author = Mitsui K, Tokuzawa Y, Itoh H, Segawa K, Murakami M, Takahashi K, Maruyama M, Maeda M, Yamanaka S | title = The homeoprotein Nanog is required for maintenance of pluripotency in mouse epiblast and ES cells | journal = Cell | volume = 113 | issue = 5 | pages = 631–42 | year = 2003 | month = May | pmid = 12787504 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00393-3 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid12787505">{{cite journal | author = Chambers I, Colby D, Robertson M, Nichols J, Lee S, Tweedie S, Smith A | title = Functional expression cloning of Nanog, a pluripotency sustaining factor in embryonic stem cells | journal = Cell | volume = 113 | issue = 5 | pages = 643–55 | year = 2003 | month = May | pmid = 12787505 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00392-1  | url =  }}</ref>

== Structure ==

Human NANOG protein  is a 305 amino acid protein with a conserved homeodomain motif that is localized to the nuclear component of cells. The [[homeodomain]] region facilitates DNA binding. 

There are N-terminal, homeodomain, and C-terminal regions in human NANOG protein. Like murine NANOG, the N-terminal region of human NANOG is rich in Ser, Thr and Pro residues, and the C-terminus contains W repeats. The homeodomain in hNANOG ranges from residues 95 to 155. The conserved sequence of homeodomain are a.a. 99-100, 102, 106-107, 110, 114, 119, 121, 127-128, 132, 134, 138-140, 142-145, 147, 149, and 151-152.

== Function ==
[[File:Transcription programs in stem cells..jpg|thumb|Transcription programs in embryonic stem cells]]
NANOG is a gene expressed in [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs) and is thought to be a key factor in maintaining [[pluripotency]]. NANOG is thought to function in concert with other factors such as [[Oct-4|POU5F1 (Oct-4)]] and [[SOX2]] to establish ESC identity. These cells offer an important area of study because of their ability to maintain pluripotency. In other words, these cells have the ability to become virtually any cell of any of the three germ layers ([[endoderm]], [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]]).  It is for this reason that understanding the mechanisms that maintain a cell's pluripotency is critical for researchers to understand how stem cells work; and may lead to future advances in treating degenerative diseases.

Analysis of arrested embryos demonstrated that embryos express pluripotency marker genes such as [[Oct-4|POU5F1]], NANOG and [[Rex1]].  Derived human ESC lines also expressed specific pluripotency markers:
*TRA-1-60
*TRA-1-81
*SSEA4
*alkaline phosphatase
*TERT
*[[Rex1]]

These markers allowed for the differentiation ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' conditions into derivatives of all three germ layers.<ref name="pmid16990582">{{cite journal | author = Zhang X, Stojkovic P, Przyborski S, Cooke M, Armstrong L, Lako M, Stojkovic M | title = Derivation of human embryonic stem cells from developing and arrested embryos | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 2669–76 | year = 2006 | month = December | pmid = 16990582 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.2006-0377 | url =  }}</ref>

[[Oct-4|POU5F1]], TDGF1 (CRIPTO), SALL4, LECT1, and BUB1 are also related genes all responsible for self-renewal and pluripotent differentiation.<ref name="pmid16978057">{{cite journal | author = Li SS, Liu YH, Tseng CN, Chung TL, Lee TY, Singh S | title = Characterization and gene expression profiling of five new human embryonic stem cell lines derived in Taiwan | journal = Stem Cells Dev. | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 532–55 | year = 2006 | month = August | pmid = 16978057 | doi = 10.1089/scd.2006.15.532 | url =  }}</ref>

The NANOG protein has been found to be a transcriptional activator for the [[Rex1]] promoter, playing a key role in sustaining [[Rex1]] expression. Knockdown of NANOG in [[embryonic stem cell]]s results in a reduction of [[Rex1]] expression, while forced expression of NANOG stimulates [[Rex1]] expression.<ref>{{cite pmid|16714766}}</ref>

== Current research ==
=== Molecular biology ===

Overexpression of Nanog in mouse embryonic stem cells causes them to self-renew in the absence of [[Leukemia inhibitory factor]]. In the absence of Nanog, mouse embryonic stem cells differentiate into visceral/parietal endoderm.<ref name="pmid12787504"/><ref name="pmid12787505"/> Loss of Nanog function causes differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into other cell types.<ref name="pmid15619621">{{cite journal | author = Lin T, Chao C, Saito S, Mazur SJ, Murphy ME, Appella E, Xu Y | title = p53 induces differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells by suppressing Nanog expression | journal = Nat.

It has been shown that the tumour suppressor [[p53]] binds to the promoter of ''NANOG'' and suppresses its expression after DNA damage in mouse embryonic stem cells.  p53 can thus induce differentiation of embryonic stem cells into other cell types which undergo efficient p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid15619621"/>

Nanog transforms [[3T3 cells|NIH3T3 cells]]. By using [[DNA microarray]] to find the transcription targets of Nanog, Nanog regulated genes have been identified. Some of these target genes explain the [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] of NIH3T3 cells.<ref name="pmid16540082">{{cite journal | author = Piestun D, Kochupurakkal BS, Jacob-Hirsch J, Zeligson S, Koudritsky M, Domany E, Amariglio N, Rechavi G, Givol D | title = Nanog transforms NIH3T3 cells and targets cell-type restricted genes | journal = Biochem.

=== Evolutionary biology ===

[[Human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s share ten NANOG [[pseudogene]]s, all in the same places:  one duplication pseudogene and nine retropseudogenes.  Of the nine shared NANOG retropseudogenes, two lack the [[Polyadenylation|poly-(A) tail]]s characteristic of most retropseudogenes, indicating copying errors occurred during their creation.  Due to the high improbability that the same pseudogenes (copying errors included) would exist in the same places in two unrelated [[genome]]s, [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] point to NANOG and its pseudogenes as providing formidable [[evidence of common descent]] between humans and chimpanzees.<ref name="isbn1-59102-564-8">{{cite book | author = Daniel J.

Professor Ian Chambers (currently of the [[MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine]], The [[University of Edinburgh]], UK) who isolated the mouse Nanog gene said: "Nanog seems to be a master gene that makes embryonic stem cells grow in the laboratory. In effect this makes stem cells immortal. Being Scottish, I therefore chose the name after the [[Tir na n-Og|Tír na nÓg legend]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/06/030602024530.htm |title=ScienceDaily: Cells Of The Ever Young: Getting Closer To The Truth |accessdate=2007-07-26 |work=}}</ref>
