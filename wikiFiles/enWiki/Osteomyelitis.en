'''Osteomyelitis''' (sometimes abbreviated to OM, and derived from Greek words ''osteon'', meaning bone, ''myelo-'' meaning marrow, and ''-itis'' meaning inflammation) is [[infection]] and [[inflammation]] of the [[bone]] or [[bone marrow]].<ref name="Robbins">Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; & Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 810–811 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1</ref> It can be usefully subclassified on the basis of the causative organism ([[pyogenic]] bacteria or [[mycobacteria]]), the route, duration and anatomic location of the infection. 

==Classification==
The definition of OM is broad, and encompasses a wide variety of conditions. Traditionally, the length of time the infection has been present and whether there is [[suppuration]] ([[pus]] formation) or [[osteosclerosis|sclerosis]] (increased density of bone) is used to arbitrarily classify OM. Chronic OM is often defined as OM that has been present for more than one month. In reality, there are no distinct subtypes, instead there is a spectrum of pathologic features that reflect balance between the type and severity of the cause of the inflammation, the [[immune system]] and local and systemic predisposing factors.

*Suppurative osteomyelitis
**Acute suppurative osteomyelitis
**Chronic suppurative osteomyelitis
***Primary (no preceding phase)
***Secondary (follows an acute phase)
*Non-suppurative osteomyelitis
**Diffuse sclerosing 
**Focal sclerosing ([[condensing osteitis]])
**Proliferative periostitis (periostitis ossificans, [[Garré's sclerosing osteomyelitis]])
**[[Osteoradionecrosis]]

OM can also be typed according to the area of the skeleton in which it is present. For example, [[osteomyelitis of the jaws]] in different in several respects from osteomyelitis present in a [[long bone]]. [[Vertebral osteomyelitis]] is another possible presentation.

== Pathogenesis ==
In general, microorganisms may infect bone through one or more of three basic methods: via the [[bloodstream]], contiguously from local areas of infection (as in [[cellulitis]]), or penetrating [[Physical trauma|trauma]], including [[iatrogenic]] causes such as [[joint replacement]]s or internal fixation of [[Bone fracture|fracture]]s or [[endodontic therapy|root-filled]] teeth.<ref name="Robbins" /> Once the bone is infected, [[leukocyte]]s enter the infected area, and, in their attempt to [[phagocytosis|engulf]] the infectious organisms, release [[enzyme]]s that [[Lysis|lyse]] the bone. [[Pus]] spreads into the bone's blood vessels, impairing their flow, and areas of devitalized infected bone, known as ''[[sequestra]]'', form the basis of a chronic infection.<ref name="Robbins" /> Often, the body will try to create new bone around the area of [[necrosis]]. The resulting new bone is often called an [[involucrum]].<ref name="Robbins" /> On [[histology|histologic]] examination, these areas of necrotic bone are the basis for distinguishing between [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] osteomyelitis and [[wikt:chronic|chronic]] osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infective process that encompasses all of the bone ([[wikt:osseous|osseous]]) components, including the bone marrow. When it is chronic, it can lead to bone [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]] and deformity.

Chronic osteomyelitis may be due to the presence of intracellular bacteria (inside bone cells).<ref>Ellington Microb Pathog 1999</ref>  Also, once intracellular, the bacteria are able to escape and invade other bone cells.<ref>Ellington JBJS Br 2003</ref>  At this point, the bacteria may be resistant to some antibiotics.<ref>Ellington J Ortho Res 2006</ref> These combined facts may explain the chronicity and difficult eradication of this disease, resulting in significant costs and disability, potentially leading to amputation. Intracellular existence of bacteria in osteomyelitis is likely an unrecognized contributing factor to its chronic form.

In [[infant]]s, the infection can spread to a [[joint]] and cause [[arthritis]]. In [[child]]ren, large [[subperiosteal]] [[abscess]]es can form because the [[periosteum]] is loosely attached to the surface of the bone.<ref name="Robbins" />

Because of the particulars of their blood supply, the [[tibia]], [[femur]], [[humerus]], [[vertebra]], the [[maxilla]], and the [[Human mandible|mandibular bodies]] are especially susceptible to osteomyelitis.<ref>{{cite web

Many infections are caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', a member of the normal [[flora (microbiology)|flora]] found on the [[skin]] and [[mucous membrane]]s. In patients with [[sickle cell]] disease, the most common causative agent remains ''Staphylococcus aureus'', but ''[[Salmonella]]'' becomes proportionally more common pathogens than in healthy hosts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In children, the [[long bone]]s are usually affected. In adults, the vertebrae and the [[pelvis]] are most commonly affected.

Acute osteomyelitis almost invariably occurs in children. When adults are affected, it may be because of compromised host resistance due to debilitation, [[intravenous]] drug abuse, infectious root-canaled teeth, or other disease or drugs (e.g., [[immunosuppressive]] therapy).

Osteomyelitis is a secondary [[complication (medicine)|complication]] in 1–3% of patients with pulmonary [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Robbins" /> In this case, the bacteria, in general, spread to the bone through the [[circulatory system]], first infecting the [[synovium]] (due to its higher [[oxygen]] concentration) before spreading to the adjacent bone.<ref name="Robbins" /> In tubercular osteomyelitis, the long bones and vertebrae are the ones that tend to be affected.<ref name="Robbins" />

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is the organism most commonly isolated from all forms of osteomyelitis.<ref name="Robbins" />

Bloodstream-sourced osteomyelitis is seen most frequently in children, and nearly 90% of cases are caused by ''Staphylococcus aureus''. In infants, ''S. aureus'', [[Group B streptococcal infection|Group B streptococci]] (most common<ref name="CBC">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/streptococcal-infections-1|title=Streptococcal Infections|first=Maureen|last=Haggerty|encyclopedia=[[Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine]]|publisher=The [[Gale Group]]|year=2002|accessdate=2008-03-14}}</ref>) and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' are commonly isolated; in children from one to 16 years of age, ''S. aureus'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' are common. In some subpopulations, including intravenous drug users and [[splenectomy|splenectomized]] patients, [[Gram-negative bacteria]], including [[enteric bacteria]], are significant pathogens.<ref name="carek">{{cite journal|last=Carek|first=P.J.|coauthors=L.M. Dickerson; J.L. Sack|title=Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis.|journal=[[American Family Physician|Am Fam Physician]]|date=2001-06-15|volume=63|issue=12|pages=2413–20|pmid=11430456}}</ref>

The most common form of the disease in adults is caused by injury exposing the bone to local infection. ''Staphylococcus aureus'' is the most common organism seen in osteomyelitis, seeded from areas of contiguous infection.  But [[anaerobe]]s and Gram-negative organisms, including ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''E. coli'', and ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'', are also common. Mixed infections are the rule rather than the exception.<ref name="carek" />

Systemic [[mycotic]] (fungal) infections may also cause osteomyelitis. The two most common are ''[[Blastomyces dermatitidis]]'' and ''[[Coccidioides immitis]]''.

In osteomyelitis involving the vertebral bodies, about half the cases are due to ''S. aureus'', and the other half are due to [[tuberculosis]] (spread hematogenously from the [[lung]]s). Tubercular osteomyelitis of the [[vertebral column|spine]] was so common before the initiation of effective antitubercular therapy, it acquired a special name, [[Pott's disease]]. 

Following laboratory analysis of clinical data and studied literature, we can say that the bone pathological changes are induced by several interrelated mechanisms the drug components, produced clandestinely.<ref name="revistaOMF">

Factors that may commonly complicate osteomyelitis are fractures of the bone, [[amyloidosis]], [[endocarditis]], or [[sepsis]].<ref name="Robbins" />

== Treatment ==

Osteomyelitis often requires prolonged [[antibiotic]] therapy, with a course lasting a matter of weeks or months. A [[PICC line]] or [[central venous catheter]] is often placed for this purpose. Osteomyelitis also may require surgical [[debridement]]. Severe cases may lead to the loss of a limb. Initial first-line antibiotic choice is determined by the patient's history and regional differences in common infective organisms. A treatment lasting 42 days is practiced in a number of facilities.<ref>Putland M.D, Michael S., Hyperbaric Medicine, [[Capital Regional Medical Center]], [[Tallahassee, Florida]], personal inquiry June 2008.</ref> Local and sustained availability of drugs have proven to be more effective in achieving prophylactic and therapeutic outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Soundrapandian | first = C | coauthors =  Datta S; Sa B | title= Drug-eluting implants for osteomyelitis | journal = Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst. | year = 2007 | volume=24 |pages=493–545 |url=http://www.begellhouse.com/journals/3667c4ae6e8fd136,4dfe0b9058dbf7d0,317efcec5ac4acb3.html |accessdate= 2010-09-27 |issue=6 | pmid = 18298388  }}</ref>

In 1875, American artist [[Thomas Eakins]] depicted a surgical procedure for osteomyelitis at [[Jefferson Medical College]], in a famous [[oil painting]] titled ''[[The Gross Clinic]]''.

Prior to the widespread availability and use of antibiotics, [[maggot|blow fly larvae]] were sometimes [[maggot therapy|deliberately introduced]] to the wounds to feed on the infected material, effectively scouring them clean.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baer M.D. |first=William S. |date=1 July 1931|title=The Treatment of Chronic Osteomyelitis with the Maggot (Larva of the Blow Fly) |journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |volume=13 |pages=438–475 |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/3/438 |accessdate= 2007-11-12 |issue=3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

Open surgery is needed for chronic osteomyelitis, whereby the involucrum is opened and the sequestrum is removed or sometimes saucerization<ref>http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/saucerization</ref> can be done

==Fossil record==

Evidence for osteomyelitis found in the fossil record is studied by [[paleopathologists]], specialists in ancient disease and injury. It has been reported in fossils of the large carnivorous dinosaur ''[[Allosaurus fragilis]]''.<ref name="molnar-pathology">Molnar, R.
