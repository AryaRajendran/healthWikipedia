'''Internal hernias''' occur when there is protrusion of an internal organ into a [[retroperitoneal fossa]] or a [[foramen]] (congenital or acquired) in the [[abdominal cavity]]. If a loop of bowel passes through the mesenteric defect, that loop is at risk for [[incarceration_(bowel)|incarceration]], [[strangulation_(bowel)|strangulation]], or for becoming the lead point of a [[small bowel obstruction]].<ref name=Bittner />  Internal hernias can also trap [[adipose tissue]] (fat) and nerves.  Unlike more common forms of hernias, the trapped tissue protrudes inward, rather than outward.<ref name=Brody />

Mesenteric defects commonly occur in trauma, such as [[gunshot wounds]] to the abdomen, and they are intentionally created in the [[Roux-en-Y gastric bypass]] procedure.  This type is classically known as a Petersen's hernia.<ref name=Petersen /> In trauma victims, the defect is usually closed, sometimes with resection of the associated bowel, which may have lost its blood supply.<ref name=Bittner />

Internal hernias are difficult to identify in women, and misdiagnosis with [[endometriosis]] or idiopathic [[chronic pelvic pain]] is very common.  One cause of misdiagnosis that when the woman lies down flat on an examination table, all of the [[medical sign]]s of the hernia disappear.  The hernia can typically only be detected when symptoms are present, so diagnosis requires positioning the woman's body in a way that provokes symptoms.

Both internal hernias and [[umbilical hernia]]s are more common in women than men.<ref name=Brody />
