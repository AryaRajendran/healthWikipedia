'''Primary fallopian tube cancer''' (PFTC), often just '''tubal cancer''', is a malignant [[neoplasm]] that originates from the [[fallopian tube]].

==Frequency==
Tubal [[cancer]] is thought to be a relatively rare primary cancer among women accounting for 1 to 2 percent of all [[gynecologic cancer]]s,<ref name=ucsf>{{cite web|  url=http://www.ucsfhealth.org/adult/medical_services/cancer/pelvic/conditions/fallopian/signs.html | author=UCSF | title=Gynecologic Cancer: Fallopian Tube Cancer}} accessed 08-14-2008</ref> In the USA tubal cancer had an incidence of 0.41 per 100,000 women from 1998 to 2003.<ref name=stewart>{{cite journal|author=Stewart SL, Wike JM, Foster SL, Michaud F| title=The incidence of primary fallopian tube cancer in the United States.| journal=Gynecol Oncol. |volume=107|issue=3|pages=392–7|year=2007 | pmid = 17961642|doi=10.1016/j.ygyno.2007.09.018 }}</ref>  Demographic distribution is similar to [[ovarian cancer]], and the highest incidence was found in white, non-Hispanic women and women aged 60–79.<ref name=stewart/> However, recent evidence suggests tubal cancer to be much more frequent .<ref name=piek>{{cite journal |author=Piek JM, van Diest PJ, Verheijen RH |title=Ovarian carcinogenesis: an alternative hypothesis |journal=Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. |volume=622 |issue= |pages=79–87 |year=2008 |pmid=18546620 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-68969-2_7 |url=}}</ref>

Evidence is accumulating that individuals with mutations of [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] are at higher risks for the development of PFTC.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYD/is_8_37/ai_85591405 BRCA mutations link to tubal cancer], accessed 08-14-2008</ref><ref name="hereditary serous ovarian carcinogenesis">http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/handle/1871/9013</ref>

==Pathology==
The most common cancer type is the [[adenocarcinoma]]; in the largest series of 3,051 cases as reported by Stewart, 88% of them fell into this category.<ref name=stewart/> According to them half of the cases were poorly differentiated, 89% unilateral, and the distribution showed a third each with local, regional, and distant extensions. Rarer forms of tubal neoplasm include the [[leiomyosarcoma]], and the [[transitional cell carcinoma]].

As the tumor is often enmeshed with the adjacent [[ovary]] it may be the pathologist and not the surgeon who will determine that the lesion is indeed tubal in origin.

Secondary tubal cancer usually originates from cancer of the ovaries, the endometrium, the GI tract, the peritoneum, and the breast.

==Symptoms==
The internal location of the fallopian tubes makes it difficult to reach an early diagnosis. Symptoms are nonspecific and may consist of pain and vaginal discharge or bleeding. A pelvic mass may be detected on a routine gynecologic examination.

Vaginal discharge in fallopion tube carcinoma result from ''intermittent hydrosalphinx'' that is called as ''hydrops tubae profluens''.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 13899814 | volume=18 | title=Hydrops tubae profluens--symptom in tubal carcinoma | year=1961 | month=November | author=GOLDMAN JA, GANS B, ECKERLING B | journal=Obstet Gynecol | pages=631–4}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
A pelvic examination may detect an [[adnexal mass]]. A [[CA-125]] blood test is a nonspecific test that tends to be elevated in patients with tubal cancer. More specific tests are a [[gynecologic ultrasound]] examination, a [[CT scan]], or an [[MRI]] of the [[pelvis]].
Occasionally, an early fallopian tube cancer may be detected serendipitously during pelvic surgery.

==Treatment==
The initial approach to tubal cancer is generally surgical and similar to that of ovarian cancer. As the lesion will spread first to the adjacent [[uterus]] and ovary, a total abdominal [[hysterectomy]] is an essential part of this approach and removes the ovaries, the tubes, and the uterus with the cervix.<ref>[http://www.cancerfactsmd.com/ Cancer facts] about treatement, symptoms and types.</ref> Also, [[peritoneal washing]]s are taken, the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] is removed, and pelvic and paraaortic [[lymph node]]s are sampled. [[Cancer staging|Staging]] at the time of surgery and pathological findings will determine further steps. In advanced cases when the cancer has spread to other organs and cannot be completely removed cytoreductive surgery is used to lessen the tumor burden for subsequent treatments. Surgical treatments are typically followed by adjuvant usually platinum-based [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=liapis>{{cite journal|author=Liapis A, Bakalianou K, Mpotsa E, Salakos N, Fotiou S, Kondi-Paffiti A. | title=Fallopian tube malignancies: A retrospective clinical pathological study of 17 cases.| journal=J Obstet Gynaecol. |volume=28|issue=1|pages=93–5|year=2008 | pmid = 18259909|doi=10.1080/01443610701811894 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| journal=Arch Gynecol Obstet. | volume=264|title=Treatment of fallopian tube cancer. Review of the literature.| issue=1| pages=13–9| year=2000| author=Takeshima N, Hasumi K.  | pmid = 10985612 }}</ref>
Also radiation therapy has been applied with some success to patients with tubal cancer for palliative or curative indications<ref>{{cite journal | journal= Radiother Oncol. | volume= 10| title=Fallopian tube cancer: the role of radiation therapy. | issue= 4 | pages= 267–75 | year= 1987| author=Schray MF, Podratz KC, Malkasian GD. | pmid = 3444903 }}</ref>

==Staging==
[[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging is done at the time of surgery:
:Stage 0  :Carcinoma in situ
:Stage I  :Growth limited to fallopian tubes
:Stage II :Growth involving one or both fallopian tubes with extension to pelvis
:Stage III:Tumor involving one or both fallopian tubes with spread outside pelvis
:Stage IV :Growth involving one or more fallopian tubes with distant metastases

==Prognosis==
Prognosis depends to a large degree on the stage of the condition. In 1991 it was reported that about half of the patients with advanced stage disease survived 5 years with a surgical approach followed by [[cisplatinum]]-based chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal  |author=Barakat RR, Rubin SC, Saigo PE, et al. | title=Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in carcinoma of the fallopian tube.  |journal=Gynecol Oncol }}</ref>
