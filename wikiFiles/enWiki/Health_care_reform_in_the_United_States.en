'''Health care reform in the United States''' has a long [[History of health care reform in the United States|history]]. Reforms have often been proposed but have rarely been accomplished. In 2010, landmark reform was passed through two [[United States federal law|federal statutes]] enacted in 2010: the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA), signed March 23, 2010,<ref>{{cite news |author=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay; Pear, Robert |date=March 24, 2010 |title=Obama signs health care overhaul bill, with a flourish |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A19 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/health/policy/24health.html |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Pear, Robert; Herszenhorn, David M. |date=March 22, 2010 |title=Obama hails vote on health care as answering 'the call of history' |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A1 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/health/policy/22health.html |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |quote=With the 219-to-212 vote, the House gave final approval to legislation passed by the Senate on Christmas Eve.}}</ref> and the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]] ({{USBill|111|H.R.|4872}}), which amended the PPACA and became law on March 30, 2010.<ref name="reuters.com">{{cite news |author=Smith, Donna; Alexander, David; Beech, Eric |date=March 19, 2010 |title=Factbox-U.S. healthcare bill would provide immediate benefits |publisher=Reuters |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1914020220100319 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author= |date=March 26, 2010 |title=Timeline: when healthcare reform will affect you |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/23/health.care.timeline/index.html |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}</ref>

Future reforms and ideas continue to be proposed, with notable arguments including a [[single-payer]] system and a reduction in [[fee-for-service]] medical care. The PPACA includes a new agency, the [[Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation]], which is intended to research reform ideas through pilot projects.

==History of national reform efforts==
{{Main|History of health care reform in the United States}}

Here is a summary of reform achievements at the national level in the United States. For failed efforts, State based efforts, native tribes services and more details generally, see the main article [[History of health care reform in the United States]].

*'''1965''' President [[Lyndon Johnson]] enacted legislation that introduced [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], covering both hospital and general medical insurance for senior citizens paid for by a Federal employment tax over the working life of the retiree, and [[Medicaid]] permitted the Federal government to partially fund a program for the poor, with the program managed and co-financed by the individual states.<ref name="MedHist">{{cite web |author= |year=2010 |title=Brief history of the Medicare program |publisher=SeniorJournal.org |location=San Antonio, Tex. |publisher=New Tech Media |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/2000%20Files/Aug%2000/FTR-08-04-00MedCarHistry.htm |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Ball, Robert M. |date=October 24, 1961 |title=The role of social insurance in preventing economic dependency (address at the Second National Conference on the Churches and Social Welfare, Cleveland, Ohio) |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Social Security Administration|U.S. Social Security Administration]] |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/churches.html |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}
* Robert M. Ball, the then Deputy Director of the Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance in the Social Security Administration had defined the major obstacle to financing health insurance for the elderly several years earlier: the high cost of care for the aged and the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger, employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance in the same way as cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment.</ref>

* '''1985''' The [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985]] (COBRA) amended the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA) to give some employees the ability to continue [[health insurance]] coverage after leaving employment.<ref>{{cite web |author= |year=2010 |title=An employee's guide to health benefits under COBRA - The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Employee Benefits Security Administration]], [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf |accessdate=November 8, 2009}}</ref>

* '''1997''' The [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], or SCHIP, was established by the federal government in 1997 to provide health insurance to children in families at or below 200&nbsp;percent of the federal poverty line.<ref>{{cite web |author= |year=2007 |title=What is SCHIP? |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Center for Public Policy Research]] |url=http://www.schip-info.org/42.html |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}</ref>

* '''2010''' The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] is enacted by President [[Barack Obama]], providing for the purchased introduction over four years of a comprehensive system of mandated health insurance with reforms designed to eliminate "some of the worst practices of the insurance companies" &mdash; pre-condition screening and premium loadings, policy rescinds on technicalities when illness seems imminent, annual and lifetime coverage caps. It also sets a minimum ratio of direct health care spending to premium income, and creates price competition bolstered by the creation of three standard insurance coverage levels to enable like-for-like comparisons by consumers, and a web-based health insurance exchange where consumers can compare prices and purchase plans. The system preserves private insurance and private health care providers and provides more subsidies to enable the poor to buy insurance.

== Motivation ==
{{Main|Health care reform debate in the United States}}
[[File:Medicare and Medicaid GDP Chart.png|thumb|Medicare and Medicaid Spending as % GDP (data from the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]])]]
[[Health_care_compared#International_comparisons|International comparisons of healthcare]] have found that the United States spends more per-capita than other similarly-developed nations but falls below similar countries in various health metrics, suggesting inefficiency and waste. In addition, the United States has significant underinsurance and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its [[social insurance]] programs [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals.

[[File:Total health expenditure per capita, US Dollars PPP.png|thumb|right|350px|Health spending per capita, in US$ [[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]], compared amongst various first world nations.]]

According to 2009 World Bank statistics, the U.S. had the highest healthcare costs relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, even though estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 15.6% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) lacked insurance.<ref name="WHO 2009">{{cite web |author=WHO |month=May |year=2009 |title=World Health Statistics 2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2009/en/index.html |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref> In March 2010, billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] commented that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees’ health care put them at a competitive disadvantage.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Funk | first = Josh | title = Buffett says economy recovering but at slow rate | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle (SFGate.com) | date = Mar. 1, 2010 | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care | accessdate =Apr. 3, 2010}}</ref>

Further, an estimated 77 million [[Baby Boomers]] are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments, particularly through [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/coming_gen_storm_e_02.pdf |title=coming_gen_storm_e.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |work=The Economist}}</ref> Maintaining the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. federal government is significantly dependent on healthcare costs being controlled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |title=Charlie Rose-Peter Orszag Interview Transcript-November 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

=== Insurance cost and availability ===
In addition, the number of employers who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]].<ref name="Kaiser 2007">{{cite press release |title=Health Insurance Premiums Rise 6.1% In 2007, Less Rapidly Than In Recent Years But Still Faster Than Wages And Inflation |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=September 11, 2007 |url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |accessdate=September 13, 2007}}</ref> Even for those who are employed, 
the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] published in [[Health Affairs]] estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes&nbsp;— 73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.<ref>{{cite journal | coauthors = Cathy Schoen, M.S., Michelle M.

There are health losses from insufficient health insurance. A 2009 Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States due to Americans lacking health insurance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf|title=American Journal of Public Health &#124; December 2009, Vol 99, No.12|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/excess-deaths-state-by-state.pdf|title=State-by-state breakout of excess deaths from lack of insurance|format=PDF}}</ref> More broadly, estimates of the total number of people in the United States, whether insured or uninsured, who die because of lack of medical care were estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year.<ref>A 1997 study carried out by Professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler (''New England Journal of Medicine'' 336, no. 11 1997) "concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care—three times the number of people who died of AIDs."

===Allegations of waste===
In December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. [[Donald Berwick]], asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the health care system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pear | first = Robert | title = Health Official Takes Parting Shot at ‘Waste’ | newspaper = New York Times | date = Dec. 3, 2011 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/health/policy/parting-shot-at-waste-by-key-obama-health-official.html?_r=1&emc=eta1| accessdate =Dec. 20, 2011}}</ref>

=== Quality of care ===
There is significant debate regarding the quality of the U.S. healthcare system relative to those of other countries. [[Physicians for a National Health Program]], a political advocacy group, has claimed that a free market solution to health care provides a lower quality of care, with higher mortality rates, than publicly funded systems.<ref name="fpb">[http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/forprofit_hospitals_cost_more_and_have_higher_death_rates.php For-Profit Hospitals Cost More and Have Higher Death Rates], ''Physicians for a National Health Program''</ref> The quality of [[health maintenance organizations]] and [[managed care]] have also been criticized by this same group.<ref>[http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/forprofit_hmos_provide_worse_quality_care.php For-Profit HMOs Provide Worse Quality Care], ''Physicians for a National Health Program''</ref>

According to a 2000 study of the [[World Health Organization]], publicly funded systems of industrial nations spend less on health care, both as a percentage of their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior population-based health care outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Prelims i-ixx/E |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> However, conservative commentator [[David Gratzer]] and the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their expected health care performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care.<ref name="fmc">[[David Gratzer]], [http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php Why Is not Government Health Care The Answer?], ''Free Market Cure'', July 16, 2007</ref><ref>Glen Whitman, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/bp/bp101.pdf "WHO’s Fooling Who? The World Health Organization’s Problematic Ranking of Health Care Systems,"] [[Cato Institute]], February 28, 2008</ref>

Some medical researchers say that patient satisfaction surveys are a poor way to evaluate medical care. Researchers at the [[RAND Corporation]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] asked 236 elderly patients in two different managed care plans to rate their care, then examined care in medical records, as reported in [[Annals of Internal Medicine]]. There was no correlation. "Patient ratings of health care are easy to obtain and report, but do not accurately measure the technical quality of medical care," said John T. Chang, [[UCLA]], lead author.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115758434624755703.html Capital: In health care, consumer theory falls flat] David Wessel, Wall Street Journal, September 7, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=Rand study finds patients' ratings of their medical care do not reflect the technical quality of their care |publisher=RAND Corporation |date=May 1, 2006 |url=http://www.rand.org/news/press.06/05.01.html |accessdate=August 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Chang JT, Hays RD, Shekelle PG, ''et al.'' |title=Patients' global ratings of their health care are not associated with the technical quality of their care |journal=Ann.

A 2001 article in the [[public health journal]] ''[[Health Affairs]]'' studied fifty years of American public opinion of various health care plans and concluded that, while there appears to be general support of a "national health care plan," poll respondents "remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right, and do not favor a
single-payer type of national health plan."<ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/>  [[Politifact]] rated a statement by [[Michael Moore]] "false" when he stated that "[t]he majority actually want single-payer health care."  According to Politifact, responses on these polls largely depend on the wording. For example, people respond more favorably when they are asked if they want a system "like Medicare."<ref name="politifact1"/>

==Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act==
{{Main|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010}}

After campaigning on the promise of health care reform, President Obama gave a speech in March 2010 at a rally in Pennsylvania explaining the necessity of health insurance reform and calling on Congress to hold a final up or down vote on reform.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/fighting-for-health-insurance-reform President's speech prior to passage of the legislation]</ref> The result of his efforts was the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. Because Obama's party did not have a [[filibuster]]-proof majority in the Senate, the law was amended by the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]] using the [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation process]] in which debate in the Senate is limited and the filibuster is therefore not permitted.

The act's provisions become effective over time. The most significant changes, particularly affecting the availability and terms of insurance become effective January 1, 2014. These include include an expansion of [[Medicaid]] (at the option of each state) to those without dependent children and subsidized healthcare exchanges. Changes which occur earlier include allowing dependents to remain on their plan until 26, limitations on [[rescission]] (dropping insureds when they get sick), removal of lifetime coverage limits, mandates that insurers fully cover certain preventative services, high-risk pools for uninsureds, tax credits for businesses to provide insurance to employees, and insurance company rate reviews and minimum [[loss ratio]]s.<ref name="reuters.com"/> 

The law creates the [[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]] to study [[comparative effectiveness research]] funded by a fee on insurers per covered life (starting at $1, increasing to $2 and thereafter adjusted according to an index<ref>[http://www.cigna.com/aboutcigna/informed-on-reform/ior-article12.html Primer on PPACA's New Fees and Taxes].

The law is also designed to complement the 2009 [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|HITECH Act]] which encourages the "meaningful use" of electronic health records; for example, the law directs the government to make use of these records for analyzing healthcare provider quality.<ref>[http://www.foley.com/ppaca-emphasizes-use-of-health-information-technology-05-13-2010/ PPACA Emphasizes Use of Health Information Technology].

== Alternatives and research directions ==
There are alternatives to the exchange-based market system which was enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which have been proposed in the past and continue to be proposed, such as a single-payer system and allowing health insurance to be regulated at the federal level.

In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act of 2010 contained provisions which allows the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) to undertake pilot projects which, if they are successful could be implemented in future.

===Single-payer health care===
{{See also|Single-payer health care}}

The [[United States National Health Care Act]] (formerly the "Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act," {{USBill|111|HR|676}}) is a bill introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] by Representative [[John Conyers]] (D-MI). The bill had 88 cosponsors in 2009. The act would establish a universal [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States similar to those in [[Medicare (Canada)|Canada]] and [[Healthcare in Taiwan|Taiwan]]. Under such a single payer system, all medically necessary care would be paid for by a federally-financed Medicare For All Trust Fund. Private insurers would be prohibited from selling duplicative health insurance, but could sell supplementary health insurance covering benefits that are not medically necessary.

The national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing insurance premiums, but also by savings realized through the provision of preventative [[universal healthcare]] and the elimination of insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/opinion/13krugman.html |title=One Nation, Uninsured |work=The New York Times  |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> An analysis of the bill by [[Physicians for a National Health Program]] estimated the immediate savings at $350 billion per year.<ref name=pnhpsavings>[[Physicians for a National Health Program]] (2008) [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single_payer_system_cost.php?page=all "Single Payer System Cost?"] ''PNHP.org''</ref> Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to preventative care and elimination of insurance company overhead costs.<ref name=canadasavings>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-5-20 | last1 = Hogg | first1 = W. | last2 = Baskerville | year = 2005 | first2 = N | last3 = Lemelin | first3 = J | title = Cost savings associated with improving appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventive care: cost-consequences analysis | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 20 | pmid = 15755330 | pmc = 1079830 }}</ref> [[Preventative health care]] expenditures can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year in the U.S., because for example [[cancer]] patents are more likely to be diagnosed at [[Cancer staging|Stage I]] where curative treatment is typically a few outpatient visits, instead of at [[Cancer staging|Stage III]] or later in an [[emergency room]] where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and is often terminal.<ref name=intlcompare>{{cite journal | author = Levy A.R.

===Public option===
{{Main| Public health insurance option}}

In January 2013, Representative [[Jan Schakowsky]] and 44 other [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Democrats introduced {{USBill|113|HR|261}}, the "Public Option Deficit Reduction Act" which would amend the 2010 [[Affordable Care Act]] to create a public option. The bill would set up a government-run health insurance plan with premiums 5% to 7% percent lower than private insurance. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated it would reduce the [[United States public debt]] by $104 billion over 10 years.<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/277505-house-dems-push-again-for-creation-of-government-run-health-insurance-option "House Dems push again for creation of government-run health insurance option"] ''The Hill'', January 16, 2013</ref>

===Balancing doctor supply and demand===
The [[Medicare (United States)#Graduate Medical Education|Medicare Graduate Medical Education]] program regulates the supply of [[medical doctor]]s in the U.S. By adjusting the reimbursement rates to establish more [[Economic inequality|income equality]] among the medical professions, the effective cost of medical care can be lowered.

===Bundled payments===
A key project is one that could radically change the way the medical profession is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as [[fee-for-service]] because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which generates more income) which may not be in the patients' best long term interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking, or follow-ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost. The current fee-for-service system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service. Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} have noted that the best hospitals have fewer re-admission rates than others, which benefits patients, but some of the worst hospitals have high re-admission rates which is bad for patients but is perversely rewarded under the fee-for-service system.

Projects at CMS are examining the possibility of rewarding health care providers through a process known as "[[bundled payment]]s"<ref>[http://www.hfma.org/Templates/InteriorMaster.aspx?id=22682 The Medicare Bundled Payment Pilot Program: Participation Considerations]</ref> by which local doctors and hospitals in an area would be paid not on a fee for service basis but on a capitation system linked to outcomes. The areas with the best outcomes would get more. This system, it is argued, makes medical practitioners much more concerned to focus on activities that deliver real health benefits at a lower cost to the system by removing the perversities inherent in the fee-for-service system.

Though aimed as a model for health care funded by CMS, if the project is successful it is thought that the model could be followed by the commercial health insurance industry also.
