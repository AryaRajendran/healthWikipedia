The unofficial term, '''rebound diuresis''' refers to the sudden resurgence of urine flow that occurs during convalescence from [[acute renal failure]].

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Rebound diuresis.png|frame|right|An example of the pattern of urine flow and plasma creatinine levels following acute tubular necrosis]]

In acute renal failure, particularly [[acute tubolar necrosis]], the tubules become blocked with cellular matter, particularly [[necrosis|necrotic]] sloughing of dead cells. This debris obstructs the flow of filtrate, which results in reduced output of urine. The arterial supply of the [[nephron]] is linked to the filtration apparatus ([[glomerulus]]), and reduced perfusion leads to reduced blood flow; usually this is the result of [[acute renal failure#Causes|pre-renal]] pathology.

The [[kidney|kidney's]] resorptive mechanisms are particularly energetic, using nearly 100% of the O<sub>2</sub> supplied. Thus, the kidney is particularly sensitive to reduction in blood supply.
This phenomenon occurs because renal flow is restored prior to the normal resorption function of the renal [[nephron|tubule]]. As you can see in the graph, urine flow recovers rapidly and subsequently overshoots the typical daily output (between 800 mL and 2L in most people). Since the kidney's resorption capacity takes longer to re-establish, there is a minor lag in function that follows recovery of flow.

A good [[reference range]] for plasma [[creatinine]] is between 0.07 - 0.12 mmol/L.
