'''Coprolalia''' is involuntary [[profanity|swearing]] or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. Coprolalia comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''κόπρος'' (kopros) meaning "[[feces]]" and ''λαλιά'' (lalia) from ''lalein'', "to talk".<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coprolalia Coprolalia.] Dictionary.com, Accessed 30 October 2006.</ref> The term is often used as a [[clinomorphism]], with 'compulsive profanity' inaccurately referred to as being [[Tourette syndrome]].

==Characteristics==
Coprolalia encompasses words and phrases that are culturally [[taboo]] or generally unsuitable for acceptable social use, when used out of context.  The term is not used to describe contextual swearing.  It is usually expressed out of social or emotional context, and may be spoken in a louder tone or different cadence or pitch than normal conversation. It can be a single word, or complex phrases.  A person with coprolalia may repeat the word mentally rather than saying it out loud; these subvocalizations can be very distressing.<ref name=TSAbrochure>Cohen, J.E. and Levi-Pearl, S.  Understanding Coprolalia - A misunderstood symptom. Available from the [http://store.tsa-usa.org/for-families--general-interest--professionals.html Tourette Syndrome Association], Accessed 30 October 2006.</ref>

Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of [[Tourette syndrome]], although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's. In Tourette syndrome, compulsive swearing can be uncontrollable and undesired by the person uttering the phrases.  Involuntary outbursts, such as racial or ethnic slurs in the company of those most offended by such remarks, can be particularly embarrassing. The phrases uttered by a person with coprolalia do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of the person.<ref name=TSAbrochure/>

==Prevalence==
Only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia,<ref name=SingerBehavior>{{cite journal |author=Singer HS |title=Tourette's syndrome: from behaviour to biology |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=149–59 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15721825 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)01012-4}}</ref> but it tends to attract more attention than any other symptom.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050208082423/http://www.tsa-usa.org/what_is/Faqs.html Tourette Syndrome FAQ.] [[Tourette Syndrome Association]].

These factors combine to render older estimates of coprolalia&mdash;biased towards clinical populations of the more severe cases&mdash;outdated.  An international, multi-site database of 3,500 individuals with Tourette syndrome drawn from clinical samples found 14% of patients with Tourette's accompanied by [[comorbidity|comorbid conditions]] had coprolalia, while only 6% of those with uncomplicated ("pure") Tourette's had coprolalia.

==Treatment==
Some patients have been treated by injecting [[botulinum toxin]] (botox) near the [[vocal cords]]. This does not prevent the vocalizations, but the partial [[paralysis]] that results helps to control the volume of any outbursts.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Scott BL, Jankovic J, Donovan DT |title=Botulinum toxin injection into vocal cord in the treatment of malignant coprolalia associated with Tourette's syndrome |journal=Mov.

The severity and frequency of outbursts can also be decreased by surgically disabling [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] in the [[thalamus]], the [[globus pallidus]] and the [[cingulate cortex]].<ref name=jh>{{cite news|author=Berger, Stephen|title=Scientists explore basis of swearing|date=28 October 2005|work=The Johns Hopkins News-Letter|url=http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2005/10/28/Science/Scientists.Explore.Basis.Of.Swearing-2242890.shtml}}</ref>

==Perception==
The entertainment industry [[Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome#References in the entertainment industry|often depicts those with Tourette syndrome]] as being social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered stigmatization and the public's misunderstanding of those with Tourette's.
