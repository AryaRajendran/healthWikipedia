'''Status epilepticus''' (SE) is a life-threatening condition in which the [[brain]] is in a state of persistent [[seizure]]. Definitions vary, but traditionally it is defined as one continuous, unremitting seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nair|first=PP|coauthors=Kalita, J, Misra, UK|title=Status epilepticus: why, what, and how.|journal=Journal of postgraduate medicine|date=2011 Jul-Sep|volume=57|issue=3|pages=242–52|pmid=21941070}}</ref> or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures for greater than 5 minutes{{fact|date=April 2013}}. Treatment is, however, generally started after the seizure has lasted five minutes. It is always considered a [[medical emergency]]. There is some evidence that five minutes is sufficient to damage neurons and that seizures are unlikely to self-terminate by that time.

First aid guidelines for seizures state that, as a rule, an ambulance should be called for seizures lasting longer than five minutes (or sooner if this is the patient's first seizure episode and no precipitating factors are known, or if SE happens to a person with epilepsy whose seizures were previously absent or well controlled for a considerable time period). The mortality rate of status epilepticus has the potential to be quite high (at least 20%), especially if treatment is not initiated quickly. However, with optimal neurological care, adherence to the medication regimen, and a good prognosis (no other underlying uncontrolled brain or other organic disease), the patient- even people who have been diagnosed with epilepsy- in otherwise good health can survive with minimal or no brain damage, and can decrease their risk of death and even avoid future seizures.<ref name="Stasiukyniene-2009"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Status epilepticus can be divided into two categories—convulsive and nonconvulsive, the latter of which is underdiagnosed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Convulsive===
[[Epilepsia partialis continua]] is a variant involving [[hour]]-, [[day]]-, or even [[week]]-long jerking. It is a consequence of [[vascular disease]], [[tumour]]s, or [[encephalitis]], and is drug-resistant.

Generalized [[myoclonus]] is commonly seen in [[coma]]tose patients following [[CPR]] and is seen by some as an indication of catastrophic damage to the [[neocortex]].<ref name="gen-myo-se">{{cite journal | first = Eelco F.

===Nonconvulsive===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
[[Complex partial status epilepticus]], or CPSE, and [[absence seizure|absence status epilepticus]] are rare forms of the condition which are marked by nonconvulsive seizures. In the case of CPSE, the seizure is confined to a small area of the brain, normally the temporal lobe. But the latter, absence status epilepticus, is marked by a generalised seizure affecting the whole brain, and an [[Electroencephalogram|EEG]] is needed to differentiate between the two conditions. This results in episodes characterized by a long-lasting stupor, staring and unresponsiveness.

==Causes==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
Only 25% of people who experience seizures or status epilepticus have [[epilepsy]].<ref name="Stasiukyniene-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Stasiukyniene | first1 = V. | last2 = Pilvinis | first2 = V. | last3 = Reingardiene | first3 = D. | last4 = Janauskaite | first4 = L. | title = [Epileptic seizures in critically ill patients] | journal = Medicina (Kaunas) | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 501–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19605972}}</ref> Causes include:
*[[Stroke]]<ref name="Stasiukyniene-2009"/>
*[[Hemorrhage]]<ref name="Stasiukyniene-2009"/>
*[[Intoxicants]]<ref name="Stasiukyniene-2009"/> or adverse reactions to drugs
*[[compliance (medicine)|Insufficient dosage]] of a medication already prescribed to the patient, such causes of this include:
**Forgetfulness on the part of the patient in taking scheduled doses, or failure to take doses at the scheduled times
**Taking medicine at wrong times as a result of a [[time zone]] change while traveling
**Dislike of the medication or its [[adverse effect|side effects]]
*Sudden withdrawal from a [[anticonvulsant|seizure medication]], such causes include:
**Sudden lack of access to medication due to unexpected circumstances
**[[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] resulting from inability to acquire non-prescribed benzodiazepines that were used being [[drug abuse|abused]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Katie |last2=Sullivan |first2=Michael J. |title=Dual Diagnosis: Counseling the Mentally Ill Substance Abuser |url=http://books.google.com/?id=lvUzR0obihEC |edition=2nd |date=1 March 2001 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-446-8 |pages=52 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}</ref>
**Lack of ability of patient to communicate medication needs to others, leading to absence of doses
**Physician's decision to discontinue medication
*Consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s while on an anticonvulsant, or [[alcohol withdrawal]] 
*[[Dieting]] or [[fasting]] while on an anticonvulsant
*Starting on a new medication that reduces the effectiveness of the anticonvulsant or changes drug metabolism, decreasing its [[plasma half-life|half-life]], leading to decreased blood concentrations
*Developing a [[drug resistance|resistance]] to an anticonvulsant already being used 
*[[Gastroenteritis]] while on an anticonvulsant, because the [[digestive system]] may [[vomiting|force out]] the anticonvulsant, thereby rendering the body with a lack of protection
*Developing a new, unrelated condition in which seizures are coincidentally also a symptom, but are not controlled by an anticonvulsant already used
*[[Metabolism|Metabolic]] disturbances—such as affected kidney and liver<ref name="Stasiukyniene-2009"/>
*[[Insomnia]] or [[sleep deprivation]] of more than a short duration is often the cause of a (usually, but not always, temporary) loss of seizure control; those whose seizures are inherently severe but otherwise controlled by medication can regress and suffer severe seizures or status epilepticus even if they are still taking their medication unless they regain their rest.

==Treatments==
[[File:Rectalvalium.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Diazepam that can be inserted rectally is often prescribed to caregivers of people with epilepsy. This enables treatment of multiple seizures prior to being able to seek medical care.]]

===Benzodiazepines===
Shortly after it was introduced in 1963, [[diazepam]] became the first choice for SE. Even though other [[benzodiazepine]]s such as [[clonazepam]] were useful, diazepam was relied upon almost exclusively. This began to change in 1975 with a preliminary study on [[lorazepam]] conducted by Waltregny and Dargent, who found its pharmacological effects were longer lasting than those of an equal dose of diazepam.<ref name="waltdar">{{cite journal | first = Alain | last = Waltregny | coauthors = Jérôme Dargent | month = September/October | year = 1975 | title = Preliminary study of parenteral lorazepam in status epilepticus | journal = Acta Neurologica Belgica | volume = 75 | issue = 5 | pages = 219–29 | pmid = 3939}}</ref> This meant it did not have to be repeatedly injected like diazepam,<ref name="lorazepam1979">{{cite journal | first = JE | last = Walker | coauthors = RW Homan, MR Vasko, IL Crawford, RD Bell, WG Tasker | month = September | year = 1979 | title = Lorazepam in status epilepticus | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 207–13 | pmid = 43112 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410060305}}</ref> the effects of which would wear off five to 15 minutes later in spite of its 30-hour [[half-life]] (due to extensive redistribution of diazepam outside the vascular compartment, as diazepam is highly lipid soluble). It has also been found that patients who were first tried on diazepam were much more likely to require [[Endotracheal intubation|endotracheal tubing]] than patients who were first tried on [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]],<ref name="vspbandpht">{{cite journal | first = Richard A. | last = Orr | coauthors = Robert J.

Today, the benzodiazepine of choice is lorazepam for initial treatment due to its relatively long (2–8 hr) duration of action when injected, and its rapid onset of action, which is thought to be due to its high affinity for [[GABA receptor]]s and to its low [[lipid]] [[solubility]], which causes it to remain in the [[Compartment (pharmacokinetics)|vascular compartment]]. If lorazepam is not available, or intravenous access is not possible, then diazepam should be given.<ref name="benzo-of-choice">{{cite journal | first = Trudy | last = Pang | coauthors = Lawrence J. Hirsch | month = July | year = 2005 | title = Treatment of Convulsive and Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus | journal = Current Treatment Options in Neurology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 247–259 | pmid = 15967088 | doi = 10.1007/s11940-005-0035-x}}</ref> Particularly in children, another increasingly popular treatment choice is [[Buccal mucosa|buccal]] and [[intranasal]] [[midazolam]], which can be given into the side of the mouth or the nose, respectively.<ref name="Walker-2006">{{Cite journal | last1 = Walker | first1 = DM. | last2 = Teach | first2 = SJ. | title = Update on the acute management of status epilepticus in children. | journal = Curr Opin Pediatr | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–44 | month = June | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1097/01.mop.0000193306.55635.24 | pmid = 16721142}}</ref> Sometimes, the failure of lorazepam alone is considered to be enough to classify a case of SE as [[wikt:refractory|refractory]].

===Phenytoin and fosphenytoin===
Phenytoin was once another first-line therapy,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal | last1 = Beran | first1 = RG. | title = An alternative perspective on the management of status epilepticus. | journal = Epilepsy Behav | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 349–53 | month = April | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.yebeh.2007.12.013 | pmid = 18262847}}</ref> although the [[prodrug]] [[fosphenytoin]] can be administered three times as fast and with far fewer injection site reactions. If these or any other [[hydantoin|hydantoin derivatives]] are used, then cardiac monitoring is a must if they are administered intravenously. Because the hydantoins take 15–30 minutes to work, a benzodiazepine or barbiturate is often coadministered. Because of diazepam's short duration of action, they were often administered together anyway.

===Carbamazepine and valproate===
[[Valproate]] is available to be given intravenously, and may be used for status epilepticus.  [[Carbamazepine]] is not available in an intravenous formulation, and does not play a role in status epilepticus.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Barbiturates===
Before the benzodiazepines were invented, there were the barbiturates, which are still used today if benzodiazepines or the hydantoins are not an option. These are used to induce a [[barbiturate|barbituric]] coma. The barbiturate most commonly used for this is [[phenobarbital]]. [[Thiopental]] or [[pentobarbital]] may also be used for that purpose if the seizures have to be stopped immediately or if the patient has already been compromised by the underlying illness or toxic/metabolic-induced seizures; however, in those situations, thiopental is the agent of choice.

The failure of phenobarbital therapy does not preclude the success of a lengthy comatose state induced by a stronger barbiturate such as [[secobarbital]]. Such was the case for Ohori, Fujioka, and Ohta, ''circa'' 1998, when they induced a 10-month long coma (or "anesthesia" as they called it) in a 26-year-old woman suffering from refractory status epilepticus secondary to [[encephalitis|viral encephalitis]], and then tapered her off the secobarbital very slowly while using [[zonisamide]] at the same time.<ref name="secobarbitalofo">{{cite journal | first = Nobuhira | last = Ohori | coauthors = Fujioka Y, Ohta M. | month = May | year = 1998 | title = [Experience in managing refractory status epilepticus caused by viral encephalitis under long-term anesthesia with barbiturate: a case report] | journal = Rinsho Shinkeigaku | volume = 38 | issue = 5 | pages = 474–7 | pmid = 9806000 |language=Japanese}}</ref>

===General anesthetics===
If this proves ineffective or if barbiturates cannot be used for some reason, then a [[general anesthetic]] such as [[propofol]]<ref name="propofol">{{cite journal | first = X | last = Pourrat | coauthors = JM Serekian, D Antier, J. Grassin | title = [Generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus: therapeutic strategy] | journal = Presse Médicale | volume = 30 | issue = 20| date = June 9, 2001 | pages = 1031–6 | pmid = 11433696}} (French).</ref> is tried; sometimes it is used second after the failure of lorazepam.<ref name="propofol2">{{cite journal | first = Paul E. | last = Marik | coauthors = Joseph Varon | title = The management of status epilepticus | journal = Chest | year = 2004 | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 582–91 | pmid = 15302747 | url = http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/full/126/2/582 | doi = 10.1378/chest.126.2.582}}</ref> This also means putting the patient on artificial ventilation. Propofol has been shown to be effective in suppressing the jerks seen in myoclonus status epilepticus, but {{As of|2002|lc=on}}, there have been no cases of anyone going into myoclonus status epilepticus, undergoing propofol treatment, and then not dying anyway.<ref name="propofolmse">{{cite journal | first = Eelco F.M. | last = Wijdicks | year = 2002 | month = July | title = Propofol in myoclonus status epilepticus in comatose patients following cardiac resuscitation | journal = Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 94–5 | pmid = 12082068 | url = http://jnnp.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/73/1/94 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.73.1.94 | pmc = 1757284}}</ref>

===Lidocaine===

==Prognosis==
About one in five people who have the disease, a total of 42,000 annually in the United States, will die within 30 days of having an initial SE seizure.{{fact|date=April 2013}} The great majority of these people have an underlying brain condition causing their status seizure such as brain tumor, brain infection, brain trauma or stroke.{{fact|date=April 2013}} However, people with diagnosed epilepsy who have a status seizure also have an increased risk of death if their condition is not stabilized quickly, their medication and sleep regimen adapted and adhered to, and stress and other stimulant (seizure trigger) levels controlled.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

==Epidemiology==
In the [[United States]], about 40 cases of SE occur annually per 100,000 people.<ref>MedRevise.co.uk Status Epilepticus article: Accessed 8th June 2010 http://www.medrevise.co.uk/wiki/Status_epilepticus</ref> This includes about 10-20% of all first seizures.<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/status-epilepticus</ref>
