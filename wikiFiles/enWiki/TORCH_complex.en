'''TORCH complex''' (also known as '''STORCH''', '''TORCHES''' or the '''TORCH infections''') is a medical [[acronym]] for a set of [[perinatal infection]]s (i.e. infections that are passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus). The TORCH infections can lead to severe fetal anomalies or even fetal loss. They are a group of viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections that gain access to the fetal bloodstream transplacentally via the [[chorionic villi]].  Hematogenous transmission may occur at any time during gestation or occasionally at the time of delivery via maternal-to-fetal transfusion.<ref>Robbins and Cotran Pathological Basis of Disease, pg 480</ref>

==Conditions==
The TORCH complex was originally considered to consist of four conditions,<ref name="pmid2850128">{{cite journal |author=Kinney JS, Kumar ML |title=Should we expand the TORCH complex? A description of clinical and diagnostic aspects of selected old and new agents |journal=Clin Perinatol |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=727–44 |year=1988 |month=December |pmid=2850128 |doi= |url=}}</ref> with the "TO" referring to "Toxoplasma". The four-term form is still used in many modern references,<ref name="pmid16231309">{{cite journal |author=Abdel-Fattah SA, Bhat A, Illanes S, Bartha JL, Carrington D |title=TORCH test for fetal medicine indications: only CMV is necessary in the United Kingdom |journal=Prenat.

Alternatively, the "O" is redefined as "other",<ref name="pmid15552342">{{cite journal |author=França CM, Mugayar LR |title=Intrauterine infections: a literature review |journal=Spec Care Dentist |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=250–3 |year=2004 |pmid=15552342 |doi= 10.1111/j.1754-4505.2004.tb01701.x|url=}}</ref> and the acronym is spelled out as follows:

# '''T''' &ndash; [[Toxoplasmosis|'''T'''oxoplasmosis]] / [[Toxoplasma gondii]]
# '''O''' &ndash; Other infections (see below)
# '''R''' &ndash; [[Rubella|'''R'''ubella]] 
# '''C''' &ndash; [[Cytomegalovirus|'''C'''ytomegalovirus]]
# '''H''' &ndash; [[Herpes simplex virus|'''H'''erpes simplex virus]]-2

The "other agents" included under '''O''' are [[Coxsackievirus]], [[Syphilis]], [[Varicella zoster virus|Varicella-Zoster Virus]], [[HIV]], and [[Parvovirus B19]].

[[Hepatitis B]] may also be included among "other agents", but the [[hepatitis B virus]] is a large virus and does not cross the placenta, hence it cannot infect the fetus unless there have been breaks in the [[maternal-fetal barrier]], such as can occur in bleeding during [[childbirth]] or [[amniocentesis]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index1.html Hepatitis B] by [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), retrieved November, 2011</ref>

The acronym has also been listed as '''TORCHES''', for '''TO'''xoplasmosis, '''R'''ubella, '''C'''ytomegalovirus, '''HE'''rpes simplex, '''S'''yphilis.

==Features==
The TORCH infections cause a syndrome characterized by [[microcephaly]], sensorineural deafness, [[chorioretinitis]],  hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. 

Symptoms of a TORCH infection may include fever and poor feeding.  The newborn is often [[Birth weight|small for gestational age]]. A [[petechia]]l rash on the skin may be present, with small reddish or purplish spots due to bleeding from capillaries under the skin. An enlarged liver and spleen ([[hepatosplenomegaly]]) is common, as is [[jaundice]]. However, jaundice is less common in Hepatitis B because a newborn's immune system is not developed well enough to mount a response against liver cells, as would normally be the cause of jaundice in an older child or adult. [[Hearing impairment]], eye problems, [[mental retardation]], [[autism]], and death can be caused by TORCH infections. The mother often has a mild infection with few or no symptoms.

It is possible for genetic conditions ([[Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome]]) to present in a similar manner.<ref name="pmid12833411">{{cite journal |author=Knoblauch H, Tennstedt C, Brueck W, ''et al.'' |title=Two brothers with findings resembling congenital intrauterine infection-like syndrome (pseudo-TORCH syndrome) |journal=Am.

==Diagnosis==
When physical examination of the newborn shows signs of the TORCH syndrome, the examiner may test blood, urine, and spinal fluid for evidence of the infections listed above. Diagnosis can be confirmed by culture of one of the specific pathogens or by increased levels of [[IgM]] against the pathogen.

==Treatment and prevention==
[[Image:Herpes simplex virus pap test.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a [[pap test]] showing changes (upper-right of image) associated with [[herpes simplex virus]], a '''TORCH infection'''.]]
Some of the TORCH infections, such as toxoplasmosis and syphilis, can be effectively treated with antibiotics if the mother is diagnosed early in her pregnancy. Many of the viral TORCH infections have no effective treatment, but some, notably rubella and varicella-zoster, can be prevented by [[Vaccination|vaccinating]] the mother prior to pregnancy. 

If the mother has active herpes simplex (as may be suggested by a [[pap test]]), delivery by [[Caesarean section]] can prevent the newborn from contact, and consequent infection, with this virus.

==Prognosis==
Each type of TORCH infection has a different prognosis. The stage of the pregnancy at the time of infection also can change the effect on the newborn.
