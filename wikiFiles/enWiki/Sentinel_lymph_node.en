The '''sentinel lymph node''' is the hypothetical first [[lymph node]] or group of nodes draining a cancer. In case of established cancerous dissemination it is postulated that the sentinel lymph node/s is/are the target organs primarily reached by [[metastasis|metastasizing]] [[cancer]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s from the [[tumor]]. Thus, sentinel lymph nodes can be totally void of cancer, due to the fact that they were detected prior to dissemination.

==Physiology==
The spread of some forms of cancer usually follows an orderly progression, spreading first to regional lymph nodes, then the next echelon of lymph nodes, and so on, since the flow of [[lymph]] is directional. In layperson language, some cancers spread in a predictable fashion from where the cancer started. In these cases, if the cancer spreads it will spread first to lymph nodes (lymph glands) close to the tumor before it spreads to other parts of the body. The concept of sentinel lymph node surgery is to determine if the cancer has spread to the very first draining lymph node (called the "sentinel lymph node") or not. If the sentinel lymph node does not contain cancer, then there is a high likelihood that the cancer has not spread to any other area of the body.

==Uses==
The concept of the sentinel lymph node is important because of the advent of the sentinel [[lymph node biopsy]] technique, also known as a sentinel node procedure.  This technique is used in the [[cancer staging|staging]] of certain types of cancer to see if they have spread to any lymph nodes, since lymph node metastasis is one of the most important [[prognosis|prognostic signs]]. It can also guide the surgeon to the appropriate therapy.<ref>Robbins and Cotran, Pathological Basis of Disease 8th edition pp. 270</ref>

There are various procedures entailing the sentinel node detection:

* Preoperative planar [[lymphoscintigraphy]]
* Preoperative planar lymphoscintigraphy in conjunction with [[SPECT/CT]] [single photonemission CT (SPECT) with a low-dose CT]<ref>Sherif A, Garske U, de La Torre M,Thörn M, Hybrid SPECT-CT - An additional  technique for sentinel node detection of patients with invasive bladder cancer, Eur Urol. 2006 Jul;50(1):83-91. [http://PMID:%2016632191 PMID16632191]</ref><ref>Leijte JA, Valdés Olmos RA, Nieweg OE, Horenblas S. Anatomical mapping of lymphatic drainage in penile carcinoma with SPECT-CT: implications for the extent of inguinal lymph node dissection. Eur Urol. 2008 Oct;54(4):885-90. [http://PMID:%2018502024 PMID 18502024]</ref>
* Intraoperative visual blue dye detection
* Intraoperative fluorescence detection ([[fluorescence image-guided surgery]])
* Intraoperative [[gamma probe]]/Geiger meter-detection
* Postoperative scintigraphy of main specimen with planar acquisition

In everyday clinical activity, entailing sentinel node detection and sentinel lymph node [[biopsy]], it is not requested to include all different techniques listed above. In skilled hands and in a center with sound routines, one, two or three of listed methods can be considered being sufficient.

To perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy, the physician performs a lymphoscintigraphy, wherein a low-activity [[radionuclide|radioactive substance]] is injected near the tumor. The injected substance, filtered sulfur colloid, is tagged with the radionuclide [[technetium-99m]]. The injection protocols differ by doctor but the most common is a 500 μCi dose divided among 5 tuberculin syringes with 1/2 inch, 24 gauge needles. The sulphur colloid is slightly acidic and causes minor stinging. A gentle massage of the injection sites spreads the sulphur colloid, relieving the pain and speeding up the lymph uptake. Scintigraphic imaging is usually started within 5 minutes of injection and the node appears from 5 min to 1 hour. This is usually done several hours before the actual biopsy.  About 15 minutes before the biopsy the physician injects a blue dye in the same manner. Then, during the biopsy, the physician visually inspects the lymph nodes for staining and uses a [[gamma probe]] or a [[Geiger counter]] to assess which lymph nodes have taken up the radionuclide.  One or several nodes may take up the dye and radioactive tracer, and these nodes are designated the ''sentinel lymph nodes''.  The surgeon then removes these lymph nodes and sends them to a [[pathologist]] for rapid examination under a [[microscope]] to look for the presence of cancer. 

A [[frozen section procedure]] is commonly employed (which takes less than 20 minutes), so if neoplasia is detected in the lymph node a further [[lymphadenectomy|lymph node dissection]] may be performed. With malignant melanoma, many pathologists eschew frozen sections for more accurate "permanent" specimen preparation due to the increased instances of false-negative with melanocytic staining.

===Clinical advantages===
There are various advantages to the sentinel node procedure. First and foremost, it decreases lymph node dissections where unnecessary, thereby reducing the risk of [[lymphedema]], a common complication of this procedure. Increased attention on the node(s) identified to most likely contain metastasis is also more likely to detect micro-metastasis and result in staging and treatment changes. The main uses are in [[breast cancer]] and [[malignant melanoma]] [[surgery]], although it has been used in other tumor types ([[colon cancer]]) with a degree of success.<ref>Tanis PJ, Boom RP, Koops HS, Faneyte IF, Peterse JL, Nieweg OE, Rutgers EJ, Tiebosch AT, Kroon BB (2001a).

===Research advantages===
As a bridge to [[translational medicine]], various aspects of cancer dissemination can be studied using sentinel node detection and ensuing sentinel node biopsy. Tumor biology pertaining to metastatic capacity,<ref>Malmstrom PU, Ren ZP, Sherif A, de la Torre M, Wester K, Thorn M.Early metastatic progression of bladder carcinoma: molecular profile of primary tumor and sentinel lymph node.J Urol. 2002 Nov;168(5):2240-4.

Detection of immune responses against urinary bladder cancer in sentinel lymph nodes. Eur Urol. 2006 Jan;49(1):59-70. PMID 16321468</ref> are some subjects which can be more distinctly investigated.

===Disadvantages===
However, the technique is not without drawbacks, particularly when used for melanoma patients.  This technique only has therapeutic value in patients with positive nodes.<ref>Wagman LD. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter01/article/10165/1399286 "Principles of Surgical Oncology"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> Failure to detect cancer cells in the sentinel node can lead to a false negative result - there may still be cancerous cells in the lymph node basin.  In addition, there is no compelling evidence that patients who have a full lymph node dissection as a result of a positive sentinel lymph node result have improved survival compared to those who do not have a full dissection until later in their disease, when the lymph nodes can be felt by a physician. Such patients may be having an unnecessary full dissection, with the attendant risk of [[lymphedema]].<ref>Thomas J (2008).  Prognostic false-positivity of the sentinel node in melanoma. ''Nat Clin Pract Oncol.'' 5(1):18-23.  PMID 18097453.</ref>

==History==
The concept of a sentinel node was first described by Gould et al. 1960 in a
patient with cancer of the parotid gland<ref>Gould EA , Winship T , Philbin PH , Kerr HH. Observations on a "sentinel node" in cancer of the parotid. Cancer 1960 ; 13 : 77 – 8. PMID 13828575</ref> and was implemented clinically on a broad scale by Cabanas in penile cancer.<ref>Cabanas RM . An approach for the treatment of penile carcinoma. Cancer 1977; 39:456 – 66,PMID 837331</ref>
The technique of sentinel node radiolocalization was co-founded by James C. Alex, MD, FACS and David N. Krag MD (University of Vermont Medical Center) and they were the first ones to pioneer this technique for the use of cutaneous melanoma, breast cancer, head and neck cancer and Merkel cell carcinoma.   Confirmative trials followed soon after.<ref>Tanis PJ, Nieweg OE, Valdes Olmos RA, Th Rutgers EJ, Kroon BB (2001b). History of sentinel node and validation of the technique. ''Breast Cancer Res'' 3:109-12. PMID 11250756.</ref> Studies were also conducted at the [[Moffitt Cancer Center]] with Charles Cox, MD, Douglas Reintgen, MD and [[James Norman, MD]].
