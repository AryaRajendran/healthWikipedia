'''Sexually induced sneezing''' is a phenomenon characterized by [[sneeze|sneezing]] during orgasm or sexual arousal.

==Symptoms==
The person experiences sneezing as a result of sexual thoughts, arousal, intercourse, or orgasm. Sneezing occurs independent of external nasal stimuli or allergens, and may occur at any point during a sexual experience. Both men and women are affected by the phenomenon.<ref name="BBC" />

==History==
The phenomenon was noted as early as 1897 in John Noland Mackenzie's remarks before the [[British Medical Association]] at a meeting in Montreal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=1246436|title=The physiological and pathological relations between the nose and the sexual apparatus of man.'|last=Mackenzie|first=John|accessdate=2008-12-20}}</ref>  It was later commented upon in print in 1901 in Gould and Pyle's ''Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine'':

{{bquote|Winn reports the case of a man who, when prompted to indulge in sexual intercourse, was immediately prior to the act seized with a fit of sneezing. Even the thought of sexual pleasure with a female was sufficient to provoke this peculiar idiosyncrasy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gould|first=George Milbry|coauthors=Walter Lytle Pyle|title=Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine|publisher=W.B. Saunders|date=1901|isbn=0-585-00884-1}}</ref>}}

In 2008, Dr Mahmood Bhutta. and Dr. Harold Maxwell performed the first full-scale investigation of the phenomenon. Before their research, the most recent mention in published research was a letter to the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' in 1972, which involved a 69-year-old man who had bouts of severe sneezing after orgasm. The two doctors noted that men and women often sought help or explanations for the disorder on Internet [[chat room]]s and forums. Bhutta stated that these people often felt embarrassed bringing up the disorder with a doctor, and were more comfortable seeking advice anonymously. The Internet, he stated, could potentially be a new tool for medical researchers to investigate unusual or embarrassing symptoms that patients might not be comfortable discussing with their physicians.<ref name="BBC" />

==Causes==
Dr. Mahmood Bhutta, an [[otorhinolaryngologist]] at [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], states that sexually induced sneezing may be genetically determined, and may result from the way the central nervous system is wired:

<blockquote>"<nowiki>[T]</nowiki>his reflex demonstrates evolutionary relics in the wiring of a part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> This is the part beyond our control, and which controls things like our heart rate and the amount of light let in by our pupils. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> Sometimes the signals in this system get crossed, and I think this may be why some people sneeze when they think about sex."</blockquote>

Another possible explanation concerns the existence of erectile tissue in the nose, which may become engorged during sexual arousal, triggering a sneeze.<ref name="BBC">{{Cite book|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7792102.stm|title=Sneezing 'can be sign of arousal'|publisher=BBC | date=2008-12-19 | accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref>
