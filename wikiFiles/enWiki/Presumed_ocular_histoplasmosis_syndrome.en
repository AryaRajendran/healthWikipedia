'''Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome''' ('''POHS''') is a syndrome affecting eye, which is characterized by peripheral atrophic chorioretinal scars, atrophy or scarring adjacent to the [[optic disc]] and [[maculopathy]].

The loss of vision in POHS is caused by [[choroidal neovascularization]].

==Causes==
It is thought to be caused by ''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'', but the fungus has rarely been isolated from cases with POHS.

The word "presumed" is also emphasized because the condition has also been found in locations where [[histoplasmosis]] is rare.<ref name="DithmarHolz2008">{{cite book|author1=Stefan Dithmar|author2=Frank Gerhard Holz|title=Fluorescence Angiography in Ophthalmology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ebTzQKwQuNEC&pg=PA168|accessdate=29 June 2010|date=28 April 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-78359-6|pages=168–}}</ref>

== Presentation ==
The diagnosis of POHS is based on the clinical triad of multiple white, atrophic choroidal
scars, peripapillary pigment changes (dark spots around optic disc of the eye), and a maculopathy caused by [[choroidal neovascularization]].

==Diagnosis==
[[Fluorescein angiography]] is usually performed for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with POHS.

==Treatment==
Treatment requires careful consideration of angiographic findings when a choroidal neovascular membrane is suspected which is a condition that responds to treatment. A vitreo-retinal specialist (an ophthalmologist specialized in treatment of retinal diseases) should be consulted for proper management of the case. 

Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome and [[age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD) have been successfully treated  with laser, [[Angiogenesis inhibitor|anti-vascular endothelial growth factors]] and photodynamic therpay. [[Ophthalmologists]] are using anti-vascular endothelial growth factors to treat AMD and similar conditions since research indicates that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the causes for the growth of the abnormal vessels that cause these conditions.
