In [[medicine]], an '''incidentaloma''' is a [[tumor]] (''-oma'') found by coincidence (''incidental'') without clinical [[symptom]]s or suspicion. It is a common problem: up to 7% of all patients over 60 may harbor a benign growth, often of the [[adrenal gland]], which is detected when [[radiology|diagnostic imaging]] is used for the analysis of unrelated symptoms. With the increase of "whole-body [[CT scan]]ning" as part of health screening programs, the chance of finding incidentalomas is expected to increase. 37% of patients receiving whole-body [[CT scan]] may have abnormal findings that need further evaluation.<ref name="pmid16170016">{{cite journal |author=Furtado CD, Aguirre DA, Sirlin CB, ''et al.'' |title=Whole-body CT screening: spectrum of findings and recommendations in 1192 patients |journal=Radiology |volume=237 |issue=2 |pages=385–94 |year=2005 |pmid=16170016 |doi=10.1148/radiol.2372041741}}</ref>

When faced with an unexpected finding on diagnostic imaging, the clinician faces the challenge to prove that the lesion is indeed harmless. Often, some other tests are required to determine the exact nature of an incidentaloma.

== Adrenal incidentaloma ==
In incidental findings of [[adrenal gland tumor]]s, a [[dexamethasone suppression test]] is often used to detect [[cortisol]] excess, and [[metanephrine]]s or [[catecholamine]]s for excess of these [[hormone]]s. Tumors under 3&nbsp;cm are generally considered benign and are only treated if there are grounds for a diagnosis of [[Cushing's syndrome]] or [[pheochromocytoma]].<ref name="pmid12614096">{{cite journal |author=Grumbach MM, Biller BM, Braunstein GD, ''et al.'' |title=Management of the clinically inapparent adrenal mass ("incidentaloma") |journal=Ann.

Hormonal evaluation includes:<ref name="pmid17287480">{{cite journal |author=Young WF |title=Clinical practice. The incidentally discovered adrenal mass |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=356 |issue=6 |pages=601–10 |year=2007 |pmid=17287480 |doi=10.1056/NEJMcp065470}}</ref>
* 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test
* 24-hour urinary specimen for measurement of fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines
* [[Blood plasma]] [[aldosterone]] concentration and plasma [[renin]] activity, ''if hypertension is present''
On CT scan, benign [[adenoma]]s typically are of low radiographic density (due to fat content) and show rapid washout of [[contrast medium]] (50% or more of the contrast medium washes out at 10 minutes). If the hormonal evaluation is negative and imaging suggests benign, followup should be considered with imaging at 6, 12, and 24 months and repeat hormonal evaluation yearly for 4 years<ref name="pmid17287480"/>

== Pituitary incidentaloma ==
[[Autopsy]] series have suggested that [[pituitary gland|pituitary]] incidentalomas may be quite common.

== Others ==
Other organs that can harbor incidentalomas include the [[liver]] (often a [[hemangioma]]).

== Scientific criticism ==
The concept of the incidentaloma has been criticized, as such lesions do not have much in common other than the history of an incidental identification and the assumption that they are clinically inert. It has been proposed just to say that such lesions have been "incidentally found."<ref name="pmid12455801">{{cite journal |author=Mirilas P, Skandalakis JE |title=Benign anatomical mistakes: incidentaloma |journal=The American surgeon |volume=68 |issue=11 |pages=1026–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12455801 |doi=}}</ref> The underlying pathology shows no unifying histological concept.
