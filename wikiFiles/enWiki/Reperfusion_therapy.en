'''Reperfusion therapy''' has become so central to the modern treatment of acute [[myocardial infarction]], that we are said to be in the reperfusion era.<ref name="Reperfusion_Era_30_Day_Mortality">{{cite journal | author = Lee KL, Woodlief LH, Topol EJ ''et al.'' | year = 1995 | title = Predictors of 30-Day Mortality in the Era of Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 91 | issue = 6| pages = 1659–1668 | pmid = 7882472 }}</ref><ref name="Reperfusion_Era_PAMI">{{cite journal | author = Stone GW, Grines CL, Browne KF ''et al.'' | year = 1995 | title = Predictors of in-hospital and 6-month outcome after acute myocardial infarction in the reperfusion era: the Primary Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (PAMI) trail | url = | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 25 | issue = 22| pages = 370–377 | pmid = 7829790 | doi = 10.1016/0735-1097(94)00367-Y }}</ref> Patients who present with suspected acute myocardial infarction and ST segment elevation (STEMI) or new bundle branch block on the 12 lead [[ECG]] are presumed to have an occlusive thrombosis in an epicardial coronary artery. They are therefore candidates for immediate reperfusion, either with [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic therapy]], [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) or when these therapies are unsuccessful, [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass surgery]].

Individuals without ST segment elevation are presumed to be experiencing either unstable angina (UA) or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). They receive many of the same initial therapies and are often stabilized with [[antiplatelet drug]]s and [[Anticoagulant|anticoagulated]]. If their condition remains ([[Hemodynamics|hemodynamically]]) stable, they can be offered either late [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiography]] with subsequent restoration of blood flow ([[revascularization]]), or [[Minimally invasive procedure|non-invasive]] [[Cardiac stress test|stress testing]] to determine if there is significant ischemia that would benefit from revascularization.  If [[Orthostatic_vital_signs|hemodynamic instability]] develops in individuals with NSTEMIs, they may undergo urgent coronary angiography and subsequent revascularization. The use of thrombolytic agents is contraindicated in this patient subset, however.<ref name="FTT_Lancet">"Indications for fibrinolytic therapy in suspected acute myocardial infarction: collaborative overview of early mortality and major morbidity results from all randomised trials of more than 1000 patients.

The basis for this distinction in treatment regimens is that ST segment elevations on an ECG are typically due to complete occlusion of a coronary artery. On the other hand, in NSTEMIs there is typically a sudden narrowing of a coronary artery with preserved (but diminished) flow to the distal myocardium. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are given to prevent the narrowed artery from occluding.

At least 10% of patients with STEMI don't develop myocardial necrosis (as evidenced by a rise in cardiac markers) and subsequent Q waves on EKG after reperfusion therapy. Such a successful restoration of flow to the infarct-related artery during an acute myocardial infarction is known as "aborting" the myocardial infarction. If treated within the hour, about 25% of STEMIs can be aborted.<ref name=Verheught2006>{{cite journal | author = Verheugt FW, Gersh BJ, Armstrong PW | year = 2006 | title = Aborted myocardial infarction: a new target for reperfusion therapy | url = | journal = Eur Heart J | volume = 27 | issue = 8| pages = 901–4 | pmid = 16543251 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehi829 }}</ref>

Although no perfect thrombolytic agent exists, an ideal thrombolytic drug would lead to rapid reperfusion, have a high sustained patency rate, be specific for recent thrombi, be easily and rapidly administered, create a low risk for intra-cerebral and systemic bleeding, have no antigenicity, adverse hemodynamic effects, or clinically significant drug interactions, and be cost effective.<ref name="Ideal_Thrombolytic">{{cite journal | author = White HD, Van , de Werf FJ | year = 1998 | title = Thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction. | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 97 | issue = 16| pages = 1632–46 | pmid = 9593569 }}</ref> Currently available thrombolytic agents include [[streptokinase]], [[urokinase]], and [[alteplase]] (recombinant [[tissue plasminogen activator]], rtPA).  More recently, thrombolytic agents similar in structure to rtPA such as [[reteplase]] and [[tenecteplase]] have been used. These newer agents boast efficacy at least as well as rtPA with significantly easier administration. The thrombolytic agent used in a particular individual is based on institution preference and the age of the patient.

Depending on the thrombolytic agent being used, [[adjuvant]] anticoagulation with [[heparin]] or [[low molecular weight heparin]] may be of benefit.<ref name="GUSTO-1993-1">{{cite journal | author=The GUSTO investigators | title=An international randomized trial comparing four thrombolytic strategies for acute myocardial infarction.

Intracranial bleeding (ICB) and subsequent [[cerebrovascular accident]] (CVA) is a serious side effect of thrombolytic use.  The risk of ICB is dependent on a number of factors, including a previous episode of intracranial bleed, age of the individual, and the thrombolytic regimen that is being used.  In general, the risk of ICB due to thrombolytic use for the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction is between 0.5 and 1 percent.<ref name="GUSTO-1993-1" />

Thrombolytic therapy to abort a myocardial infarction is not always effective.  The degree of effectiveness of a thrombolytic agent is dependent on the time since the myocardial infarction began, with the best results occurring if the thrombolytic agent is used within two hours of the onset of symptoms.<ref name="Morrison-2000">{{cite journal | author=Morrison LJ, Verbeek PR, McDonald AC, Sawadsky BV, Cook DJ. | title=Mortality and prehospital thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction: A meta-analysis | journal=JAMA | year=2000 | volume=283 | issue=20 | pages=2686–92 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/283/20/2686.pdf?ijkey=c72b289825a3fd6ace7545ef61cd70936485e7e1 | pmid=10819952 | doi = 10.1001/jama.283.20.2686}}</ref><ref name="Boersma-1996">{{cite journal | author=Boersma E, Maas AC, Deckers JW, Simoons ML. | title=Early thrombolytic treatment in acute myocardial infarction: reappraisal of the golden hour | journal=Lancet | year=1996 | volume=348 | issue=9030 | pages=771–5 | pmid=8813982 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)02514-7}}</ref>  If the individual presents more than 12 hours after symptoms commenced, the risk of intracranial bleed are considered higher than the benefits of the thrombolytic agent.<ref name="LATE-1993">{{cite journal | author=LATE trial intestigatos. | title=Late Assessment of Thrombolytic Efficacy (LATE) study with alteplase 6-24 hours after onset of acute myocardial infarction | journal=Lancet | year=1993 | volume=342 | issue=8874 | pages=759–66 | pmid=8103874 | doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)91538-W}}</ref>  Failure rates of thrombolytics can be as high as 20% or higher.<ref name="Chesebro-1987">{{cite journal | author=Chesebro JH, Knatterud G, Roberts R, Borer J, Cohen LS, Dalen J, Dodge HT, Francis CK, Hillis D, Ludbrook P, et al. | title=Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Trial, Phase I: A comparison between intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and intravenous streptokinase.

One particularly successful implementation of a primary PCI protocol is in the [[Calgary Health Region]] under the auspices of the [[Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta]].  Under this model, EMS teams responding to an emergency electronically transmit the ECG directly to a digital archiving system that allows emergency room physicians and/or cardiologists to immediately confirm the diagnosis.  This in turn allows for redirection of the EMS teams to facilities prepped to conduct time-critical angioplasty, based on the ECG analysis.  In an article published in the [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] in June 2007, the Calgary implementation resulted in a median time to treatment of 62 minutes.<ref name="De Villiers-2007">{{cite journal | author = De Villiers JS, Anderson T, McMeekin JD, ''et al.''. | title = Expedited transfer for primary percutaneous coronary intervention: a program evaluation | journal = CMAJ | volume = 176 | pages = 1833–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17576980 | issue = 13 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.060902 | pmc = 1891117}}</ref>

Primary PCI involves performing a coronary [[angiogram]] to determine the anatomical location of the infarcting vessel, followed by balloon [[angioplasty]] (and frequently deployment of an intracoronary stent) of the thrombosed arterial segment.  In some settings, an extraction catheter may be used to attempt to aspirate (remove) the thrombus prior to balloon angioplasty.  While the use of intracoronary [[stent]]s do not improve the short term outcomes in primary PCI, the use of stents is widespread because of the decreased rates of procedures to treat restenosis compared to balloon angioplasty.<ref name="Grines-1999">{{cite journal | author=Grines CL, Cox DA, Stone GW, Garcia E, Mattos LA, Giambartolomei A, Brodie BR, Madonna O, Eijgelshoven M, Lansky AJ, O'Neill WW, Morice MC. | title=Coronary angioplasty with or without stent implantation for acute myocardial infarction.

Several arteries and veins can be used, however [[internal mammary artery]] grafts have demonstrated significantly better long-term patency rates than [[great saphenous vein]] grafts.<ref name=Raja2004>{{cite journal |author=Raja SG, Haider Z, Ahmad M, Zaman H |title=Saphenous vein grafts: to use or not to use? |journal=Heart Lung Circ |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=403–9 |year=2004 |pmid=16352226 |doi=10.1016/j.hlc.2004.04.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1443-9506(04)00140-4}}</ref> In patients with two or more coronary arteries affected, bypass surgery is associated with higher long-term [[survival rate]]s compared to percutaneous interventions.<ref name=Hannan2005>{{cite journal |author=Hannan EL, Racz MJ, Walford G, ''et al.'' |title=Long-term outcomes of coronary-artery bypass grafting versus stent implantation |journal=N.
