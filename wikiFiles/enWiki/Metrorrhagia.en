'''Metrorrhagia''' (metro = womb, -rrhagia = excessive flow<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rrhagia</ref>) is [[uterine bleeding]] at irregular intervals, particularly between the expected [[menstrual period]]s.<ref>[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4367 MedicineNet.com > Definition of Metrorrhagia] Last Editorial Review: 3/17/2003</ref>

In some women, menstrual spotting between periods occurs as a normal and harmless part of [[ovulation]]. Some women experience acute mid-cycle abdominal pain around the time of ovulation (sometimes referred to by the German term for this phenomenon, ''[[mittelschmerz]]''). This may also occur at the same time as menstrual spotting. The term [[breakthrough bleeding]] or breakthrough spotting is usually used for women using [[hormonal contraceptive]]s, such as [[IUD]]s or [[oral contraceptives]], in which it refers to bleeding or spotting between any expected withdrawal bleedings, or bleeding or spotting at any time if none is expected. If spotting continues beyond the first three cycles of oral contraceptive use, a woman should have her prescription changed to a pill containing either more [[estrogen]] or more [[progesterone]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson, Karen J., MD; Eisenstat, Stephanie A., MD; Ziporyn, Terra, PhD|title=The New Harvard Guide to Women's Health|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-01343-3|pages=385}}</ref>  

Metrorrhagia may also be a sign of an underlying disorder, such as hormone imbalance, [[endometriosis]], [[uterine fibroids]], or cancer of the reproductive organs.

Due to repeated bleeding, it may cause significant [[iron deficiency anemia]].

==Cause==
Intermittent spotting between periods can result from any of numerous reproductive system disorders.
