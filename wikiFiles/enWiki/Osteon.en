The '''osteon''' or '''[[Clopton Havers|Haversian]] system''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ə|'|v|ɝ|ʒ|n}} is the fundamental functional unit of [[Cortical bone|compact bone]]. Osteons are roughly cylindrical structures that are typically several millimeters long and around 0.2mm in [[diameter]].<ref name=brittanica>"Osteon," ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'' (2009); retrieved 23 June 2009.</ref> They are present in many bones of most mammals and some bird, reptile and amphibian species.

==Description==
Each osteon consists of concentric layers, or [[Lamella (zoology)|lamellae]], of [[Osseous tissue|compact bone tissue]] that surround a central canal, the [[Haversian canal]]. The Haversian canal contains the bone's nerve and blood supplies. The boundary of an osteon is the '''cement line'''.

Between adjoining osteons there are angular intervals that are occupied by interstitial lamellae. These lamellae are remnants of osteons the greater parts of which have been destroyed. Near the surface of the compact bone the lamellae are arranged parallel to the surface; these are called circumferential lamellae. Some of the [[osteoblasts]] develop into [[osteocyte]]s, each living within its own small space, or [[Lacuna (histology)|lacuna]]. Osteocytes make contact with the [[cytoplasm]]ic processes of their counterparts via a network of small transverse canals, or [[Canaliculus (bone)|canaliculi]]. This network facilitates the exchange of [[nutrient]]s and [[metabolism|metabolic]] waste.  [[Collagen]] fibers in a particular lamella run parallel to each other but the orientation of collagen fibers within other lamellae is oblique. The collagen fiber density is lowest at the seams between lamellae, accounting  for the distinctive microscopic appearance of a transverse section of osteons.  The space between osteons is occupied by ''interstitial lamellae'', which are the remnants of osteons that were partially [[bone resorption|resorbed]] during the process of [[Bone|bone remodelling]].

Osteons are connected to each other and the [[periosteum]] by oblique channels called [[Volkmann's canals]] or perforating canals.

=== Drifting osteons ===
Drifting osteons are a phenomenon that is not fully understood.  A "drifting osteon" is classified as one that runs both longitudinally as well as transversely through the cortex.  An osteon can "drift" in one direction or change directions several times, leaving a tail of lamellae behind the advancing haversian canal.<ref>Robling, Alexander D.; Stout, Sam D. 1999 "Morphology or the Drifting Osteon," Cells Tissues Organs 164:192-204

==Investigative applications==
In [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] research and in forensic investigations, osteons in a bone fragment can be used to determine the sex of an individual<ref>Monika Martiniaková,Radoslav Omelka,Birgit Grosskopf, Alexander V. Sirotkin,and Peter Chrenek, 2008, "Sex-related variation in compact bone microstructure of the femoral diaphysis in juvenile rabbits," ''Acta Vet Scand. 50(1): 15ff''</ref> and age, as well as aspects of health and motor history<ref>Pfeiffer, Susan; Crowder, Christian; Harrington, Lesley; and Brown, Michael, 2006, "Secondary Osteon and Haversian Canal Dimensions as Behavioral Indicators," American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 131 (4): 460 - 468</ref> and diet. 

Osteons and their arrangement vary according to taxon, so that genus and sometimes species can be differentiated using a bone fragment not otherwise identifiable.  However, there is considerable variability among the different bones of a skeleton, and features of some faunal osteons overlap with those of human osteons; therefore, examination of osteons is not of primary use in the analyses of osteological remains.<ref>Martiniaková, Monika. 2006. ''Differences in Bone Microstructure of Mammalian Skeletons''. Faculty of Natural Sciences, Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra: Nitra, Slovakia</ref>  More research is needed, but has the potential to positively affect the studies in [[bioarchaeology]], [[paleontology]] and [[forensic science|forensic investigations]].  

In recent decades, osteohistological studies of dinosaur fossils has been used to address a number of issues, such as the periodicity of growth of dinosaurs and whether it was uniform across species <ref> Chinsamy, Anusuya, 1995, "Ontogenetic Changes in the Bone Histology of the Late Jurassic Ornithopod 'Dryosaurus Lettowvorbecki'," 'Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology' 15(1): 96-104. DOI: 10.1080/02724634.1995.10011209</ref> and the question of whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded or not <ref> Reid, R. E. H., 1984, "Primary Bone and Dinosaurian Physiology," 'Geological Magazine' 121(6): 589-598. DOI: 	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0016756800030739 </ref>
