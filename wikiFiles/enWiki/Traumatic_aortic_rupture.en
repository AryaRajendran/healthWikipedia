'''Traumatic aortic rupture''', also called '''traumatic aortic disruption''' or '''transection''',  is a condition in which the [[aorta]], the largest [[artery]] in the body, is torn or ruptured.  The condition is frequently fatal due to the profuse [[bleeding]] that results from the rupture.  Since the aorta branches directly from the [[heart]] to supply [[blood]] to the rest of the body, the pressure within it is very great, and blood may be pumped out of a tear in the blood vessel very rapidly. This can quickly result in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and death.  Thus traumatic aortic rupture is a common killer of victims of [[car accident|automotive accidents]] and other traumas,<ref name="schrader">{{cite web | author = Schrader L, Carey MJ | title = Traumatic Aortic Rupture | work = The Doctor Will See You Now | url = http://www.thedoctorwillseeyounow.com/articles/heart/tar_6/ | year = 2000 | publisher = interMDnet Corp | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}</ref> with up to  18% of deaths that occur in automobile collisions being related to the injury.<ref name="Rousseau">{{cite journal |author=Rousseau H |title=Delayed treatment of traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta with endoluminal covered stent |journal=Circulation |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=498–504 |date=2 February 1999|pmid=9927395 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/99/4/498 |author-separator=, |author2=Soula P |author3=Perreault P |display-authors=3 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.99.4.498 |last4=Bui |first4=B |last5=Janne d'Othée |first5=B |last6=Massabuau |first6=P |last7=Meites |first7=G |last8=Concina |first8=P |last9=Mazerolles |first9=M }}</ref>  In fact, aortic disruption due to blunt [[chest trauma]] is the second leading cause of injury death (behind [[traumatic brain injury]]).<ref name="Plummer">{{cite journal |author=Plummer D, Petro K, Akbari C, O'Donnell S |title=Endovascular repair of traumatic thoracic aortic disruption |journal=Perspectives in vascular surgery and endovascular therapy |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=132–139 |year=2006 |pmid=17060230 |doi=10.1177/1531003506293453}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
The condition is difficult to detect and may go unnoticed, since most patients have no symptoms.  However, a minority of patients may be hoarse, find it difficult to breathe or speak, or have shortness of breath, or have chest or upper [[back pain]].<ref name="schrader"/>  Diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that many patients with the injury experienced multiple other serious injuries as well,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vloeberghs M, Duinslaeger M, Van den Brande P, Cham B, Welch W |title=Posttraumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta |journal=Acta Chir. Belg. |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=33–38 |year=1988 |pmid=3376665 |doi=}}</ref> so the attention of hospital staff may be distracted from the possibility of aortic rupture.  

The preferred method of diagnosis is [[CT angiogram|CT Angiogram]].  Though not completely reliable, chest [[X-ray]]s are initially used to diagnose this condition when the patient is unstable and cannot be sent to the CT bay.

==Features==
The injury is usually caused by high speed impacts such as those that occur in vehicle collisions and serious falls.<ref name="schrader"/>  It may be due to different rates of deceleration of the heart and the aorta, which is in a fixed position.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rittenhouse EA, Dillard DH, Winterscheid LC, Merendino KA |title=Traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta: a review of the literature and a report of five cases with attention to special problems in early surgical management |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=170 |issue=1 |pages=87–100 |year=1969 |pmid=5789533 |pmc=1387606 |doi=10.1097/00000658-196907000-00010}}</ref>

By far the most common site for tearing in traumatic aortic rupture is the [[aortic isthmus]], near where the left [[subclavian artery]] branches off from the aorta (distal to left subclavian artery).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Phillips BJ | title = Traumatic Rupture Of The Thoracic Aorta: An Endoluminal Approach | journal = The Internet Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery | year = 2001 | volume = 4 | issn = 1524-0274 | url = http://www.ispub.com/ostia/index.php?xmlFilePath=journals/ijtcvs/vol4n1/tar.xml| issue = 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=McKnight JT, Meyer JA, Neville JF |title=Nonpenetrating Traumatic Rupture of the Thoracic Aorta |journal=Ann. Surg. |volume=160 |issue= 6|pages=1069–1072 |year=1964 |pmid=14246145 |doi=10.1097/00000658-196412000-00022 |pmc=1408872}}</ref> An angiogram will often show an irregular outpouching beyond the takeoff of the left subclavian artery at the aortic isthmus, representing an aortic [[pseudoaneursym]] caused by the trauma. 

The classical findings on a chest x ray will be widened mediastinum, apical cap, and displacement of the trachea, left main bronchus, or nasogastric tube. A normal chest x-ray does not exclude transection, but will diagnose conditions
such as pneumothorax or hydrothorax. The aorta may also be torn at the point where it is connected to the heart.  The aorta may be completely torn away from the heart, but patients with such injuries rarely survive  very long after the injury; thus it is much more common for hospital staff to treat patients with partially torn aortas.<ref name="schrader"/> When the aorta is partially torn, it may form a "pseudoaneurysm".  In patients who do live long enough to be seen in a hospital, a majority have only a partially torn blood vessel, with the outermost [[adventitial]] layer still intact.<ref name="Rousseau"/>  In some of these patients, the adventitia and nearby structures within the chest may serve to prevent severe [[hemorrhage]].<ref name="Rousseau"/> After trauma, the aorta can be assessed by a CT angiogram or a direct angiogram, in which contrast is introduced into the aorta via a catheter.

==Treatment==
Traumatic aortic rupture is treated with surgery.  However, [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate]]s for surgical repair of the aorta for this condition are among the highest of any cardiovascular surgery.<ref name="Plummer"/>  For example, surgery is associated with a high rate of [[paraplegia]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Attar S |title=Traumatic aortic rupture: Recent outcome with regard to neurologic deficit |journal=Ann. Thorac. Surg. |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=959–64; discussion 964–5 |year=1999 |pmid=10320235 |doi=10.1016/S0003-4975(99)00174-5 |author-separator=, |author2=Cardarelli MG |author3=Downing SW |display-authors=3 |last4=Rodriguez |first4=Aurelio |last5=Wallace |first5=Douglas C |last6=West |first6=Robert S |last7=McLaughlin |first7=Joseph S}}</ref> because the [[spinal cord]] is very sensitive to [[ischemia]] (lack of blood supply), and the nerve tissue can be damaged or killed by the interruption of the blood supply during surgery.

Since high [[blood pressure]] could exacerbate the tear in the aorta or even separate it completely from the heart, which would almost inevitably kill the patient, hospital staff take measures to keep the blood pressure low.<ref name="schrader"/>  Such measures include giving [[pain medication]], keeping the patient calm, and avoiding procedures that could cause gagging or [[vomiting]].<ref name="schrader"/>

==Prognosis==
Death occurs immediately after traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta 75%&ndash;90% of the time since bleeding is so severe, and 80&ndash;85% of patients die before arriving at a hospital.<ref name="Rousseau"/>  Though there is a concern that a small, stable tear in the aorta could enlarge and cause complete rupture of the aorta and heavy bleeding, this may be less common than previously believed as long as the patient's blood pressure does not get too high.<ref name="Rousseau"/>
