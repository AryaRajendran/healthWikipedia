'''Gynecologic ultrasonography''' or '''gynecologic sonography''' refers to the application of [[medical ultrasonography]] to the female pelvic organs, specifically the [[uterus]], the [[ovaries]], the [[Fallopian tubes]], as well as the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], the adnexa, the [[Pouch of Douglas]], and any findings in the pelvis of relevance outside of [[pregnancy]].

==Routes==
The examination can be performed transabdominally, generally  with a full bladder which acts as an [[acoustic window]] to achieve better visualization of pelvis organs, or transvaginally with a specifically designed vaginal transducer. Transvaginal imaging utilizes a higher frequency imaging, which gives better resolution of the ovaries, uterus and [[endometrium]] (the fallopian tubes are generally not seen unless distended), but is limited to depth of image penetration, whereas larger lesions reaching into the abdomen are better seen transabdominally.  Having a full bladder for the transabdominal portion of the exam is helpful because sound travels through fluid with less attenuation to better visualize the uterus and ovaries which lies posteriorly to the bladder.  The procedure is regarded as not painful and invasive{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Scans are performed by health care professionals called sonographers, or gynecologists trained in ultrasound.

==Applications==
Gynecologic sonography is used extensively:
* to assess pelvic organs,
* to diagnose [[acute appendicitis]]<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Caspi | first1 = B. | last2 = Zbar | first2 = AP. | last3 = Mavor | first3 = E. | last4 = Hagay | first4 = Z. | last5 = Appelman | first5 = Z. | title = The contribution of transvaginal ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: an observational study. | journal = Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 273-6 | month = Mar | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1002/uog.72 | PMID = 12666223 }}</ref>
* to diagnose and manage gynecologic problems including [[endometriosis]], [[leiomyoma]], [[adenomyosis]], ovarian cysts and lesions,
* to identify adnexal masses, including [[ectopic pregnancy]],
* to diagnose gynecologic [[cancer]]
* in infertility treatments to track the response of [[ovarian follicle]]s to [[fertility medication]] (i.e. [[Pergonal]]). However, it often underestimates the true ovarian volume.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosendahl M, Ernst E, Rasmussen PE, Yding Andersen C |title=True ovarian volume is underestimated by two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound measurement |journal=Fertil.

Through transvaginal sonography ovarian cysts can be aspirated. This technique is also used in [[transvaginal oocyte retrieval]] to obtain human eggs ([[oocyte]]s) through sonographic directed transvaginal puncture of ovarian follicles in [[IVF]].

'''Sonohysterography{{anchor|Sonohysterography}}''' is a specialized procedure by which fluid, usually sterile saline, is installed into the uterine cavity, and gynecologic sonography performed at the same time. The procedure delineates intrauterine pathology such as [[Endometrial polyp|polyp]]s, [[Asherman's syndrome]], [[uterine malformation]]s or submucous [[leiomyoma]].
