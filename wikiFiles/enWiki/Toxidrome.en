A '''toxidrome''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[toxic]]'' and ''[[syndrome]]'') is a syndrome caused by a dangerous level of [[toxin]]s in the body. The term was coined in 1970 by Mofenson and Greensher.<ref>{{cite journal

A toxidrome may indicate a [[medical emergency]] requiring treatment at a [[poison control center]].  Aside from [[poison]]ing, a systemic [[infection]] may also lead to a toxidrome. "Classic" toxidromes are presented below, but they are often variable<ref name = Goldfrank>{{cite book

==Anticholinergic==<!-- This section is linked from [[Atropine]] -->
The symptoms of an anticholinergic toxidrome include blurred vision, [[coma]], decreased [[bowel]] sounds, [[delirium]], dry [[skin]], [[fever]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[hallucination]]s, [[ileus]], [[memory loss]], [[mydriasis]] (dilated [[pupils]]), [[myoclonus]], [[psychosis]], [[seizure]]s, and [[urinary retention]].  [[Complication (medicine)|Complication]]s include [[hypertension]], [[hyperthermia]], and [[tachycardia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include the four "anti"s of [[antihistamine]]s, [[antipsychotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, and [[antiparkinsonian]] drugs<ref name = firstaid/> as well as  [[atropine]], [[benztropine]], [[datura]], and [[scopolamine]].

Due to the characteristic appearance and behavior of patients with this toxidrome, they are [[colloquial]]ly described as "Blind as a [[bat]], [[mad as a hatter]], red as a [[beet]], hot as [[Hades]], dry as a bone, the [[bowel]] and [[bladder]] lose their tone, and the heart runs alone."<ref name = firstaid/>

==Cholinergic==
The symptoms of a cholinergic toxidrome include [[bronchorrhea]], [[confusion]], [[defecation]], [[diaphoresis]], [[diarrhea]], [[emesis]], [[lacrimation]], [[miosis]], [[muscle fasciculation]]s, [[salivation]], [[seizure]]s, [[urination]], and weakness.  Complications include [[bradycardia]], [[hypothermia]], and [[tachypnea]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[carbamate]]s, [[mushroom]]s, and [[organophosphate]]s.

Common [[mnemonic]]s for organophosphate poisoning include the "killer B's" of bronchorrhea and bronchospasm because they are the leading cause of death,<ref name = gussow>Gussow, Leon. ''Nerve Agents: Three Mechanisms, Three Antidotes.'' Emergency Medicine News. 27(7):12, July 2005.</ref> and [[SLUDGE syndrome|SLUDGE]] - Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Diarrhea, Gastrointestinal distress, and Emesis.<ref name = firstaid/><ref name="gussow"/><br />

An alternative mnemonic is DUMBELLS - Diarrhea, Urination, Miosis, Bradycardia, Emesis, Lacrimation, Lethargy and Salivation

==Hallucinogenic==
The symptoms of a hallucinogenic toxidrome include [[disorientation]], [[hallucination]]s, hyperactive bowel sounds, [[panic]], and [[seizure]]s.  Complications include [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]], and [[tachypnea]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], and [[phencyclidine]].

==Opiate==
The symptoms of an opiate toxidrome include the classic triad of [[coma]], [[miosis|pinpoint pupils]], and respiratory depression<ref name = firstaid/> as well as [[Altered state of consciousness|altered mental state]]s, [[Shock (medical)|shock]], [[pulmonary edema]] and unresponsiveness.  Complications include [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], and [[hypothermia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome are [[opioids]].

==Sedative/hypnotic==
The symptoms of sedative/hypnotic toxidrome include [[ataxia]], blurred vision, [[coma]], [[confusion]], [[delirium]], deterioration of [[central nervous system]] functions, [[diplopia]], [[dysesthesias]], [[hallucination]]s, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[paresthesias]], [[sedation]], slurred speech, and [[stupor]].  [[Apnea]] is a potential complication.  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[anticonvulsant]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid]], [[Methaqualone]], and [[ethanol]]. While most sedative-hypnotics are [[anticonvulsant]], some such as GHB and methaqualone instead lower the seizure threshold, and so can cause paradoxical [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] in overdose.

==Sympathomimetic==
The symptoms of a sympathomimetic toxidrome include [[anxiety]], [[delusion]]s, [[diaphoresis]], [[hyperreflexia]], [[mydriasis]], [[paranoia]], [[piloerection]], and [[seizure]]s.  Complications include [[hypertension]], and [[tachycardia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[salbutamol]], [[amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], [[ephedrine]] ([[Ma Huang]]), [[methamphetamine]], [[phenylpropanolamine]] (PPA's), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. It may appear very similar to the anticholinergic toxidrome, but is distinguished by hyperactive bowel sounds and sweating.<ref name = firstaid/>
