==Diagnosis==
Doctors uses a variety of tools and techniques to evaluate the type of anorectal disorder, including [[digital rectal examination|digital]] and [[anoscopy|anoscopic]] investigations, [[palpation]]s, and [[palpitations]]{{Clarify| reason=is this the right word?| date=October 2012}}.<ref name="gast"/> 
The initial examination can be painful because a [[gastroenterologist]] will need to spread the [[buttocks]] and probe the painful area, which may require a [[local anesthetic]].<ref name="gast"/>

==Treatment==
Treatments range from recommendations for [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter products]] to more invasive [[surgical procedure]]s.<ref name="gast"/> Among the most common outpatient advice given to patients with less severe disorders include a diet high in [[dietary fiber|fiber]], application of [[ointment]], and increased water intake.<ref name="gast"/> More serious procedures include the removal of affected tissue, injection of [[botulinum]] toxin, or surgically opening the [[fistula]] tract in the [[sphincter]] muscle.<ref name="gast"/>
