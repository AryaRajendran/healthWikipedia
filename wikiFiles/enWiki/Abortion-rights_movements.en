'''Abortion-rights movements''' advocate for legal access to [[abortion]].  The issue of abortion remains divisive in public life, with recurring arguments to liberalize or to restrict access to legal abortion. Abortion-rights campaigners themselves are frequently divided as to the types of abortion that should be available and to what extent access is to be restricted.

[[Abortion in South Africa|South Africa]] allows abortion on demand under its [[Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act]].  Most African nations, however, have abortion bans except in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk.  A number of abortion-rights international organizations have made altering abortion laws and expanding [[family planning]] services in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[developing world]] a top priority.

==Europe==
Most European countries have legalized abortion (in at least some cases) through certain laws (United Kingdom, France, [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], etc.). [[Russia]] legalized the procedure in 1955.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3093152.stm|title=Russia turns spotlight on abortion|accessdate=2006-07-07|last=Greenall|first=Robert|date=2003-09-16|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

===Ireland===
{{main|Abortion in the Republic of Ireland}}
Abortion is illegal in the [[Republic of Ireland]] except when the woman's life is threatened by a medical condition or a suicide risk, since [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|a 1983 referendum]] amended the [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]]. Subsequent [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendments]] – the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|fourteenth]] – guaranteed the right to travel abroad (for abortions) and to distribute and obtain information of "services" not available in the country, such as abortion, which are lawful in other countries. A proposal to remove suicide risk as a ground for abortion was [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland Bill, 2002|struck down in a 2002 referendum]]. Thousands of women get around the ban by privately traveling to the other European countries (typically Britain and the Netherlands) to undergo terminations.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6639673.stm BBC News – Irish teen wins abortion battle]</ref>

The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], [[Communist Party of Ireland|Communist Party]], [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] and [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] are in favor of liberalizing the laws. For many other parties (such as the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]]), it is a 'matter of conscience' and they have no official line on the issue.<ref>[http://www.choiceireland.org/node/60 Choice Ireland – ''Irish political parties: Where do they stand?'']</ref>

Abortion is also illegal in Northern Ireland, except in cases when the woman is threatened by a medical condition, physical or mental.<ref>''Rex v Bourne'' [1939] 1 KB 687, [1938] 3 All ER 615, [[Court of Criminal Appeal|CCA]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Q&A: Abortion in Northern Ireland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1386450.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=December 9, 2011|date=June 13, 2001}}</ref>

===Poland===
{{main|Abortion in Poland}}
Abortion is illegal in [[Poland]] unless the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, the pregnancy was the result of a criminal act or the fetus is seriously malformed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rozporządzenie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20091104062448/http://przestepczosczorganizowana.republika.pl/praw_pliki/historia_prawa/Kodeks_karny_1932r.pdf|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref> Abortion was legalized by the Soviet Union throughout its rule of Poland, but this policy was abandoned after the fall of the USSR.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Abortion in the United Kingdom}}
In the United Kingdom, the [[Abortion Act 1967]] legalized abortion, except in [[Northern Ireland]]. In Great Britain, the law states that pregnancy may be terminated up to 24 weeks<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7412118.stm | work=BBC News | title=MPs reject cut in abortion limit | date=2008-05-21 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> if it:

#puts the life of the pregnant woman at risk
#poses a risk to the mental and physical health of the pregnant woman
#poses a risk to the mental and physical health of the fetus
#shows there is evidence of extreme fetal abnormality i.e. the child would be seriously physically or mentally handicapped after birth and during life.<ref>{{UK-LEG|title=Abortion Act 1967|type=ukpga|path=/ukpga/1967/87}}.</ref>

However, the criterion of risk to mental and physical health is applied broadly, and ''de facto'' makes abortion available on demand,<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/297.html R v British Broadcasting Corporation, ex parte ProLife Alliance] [2002] EWCA Civ 297 at [6], [2002] 2 All ER 756 at 761, CA</ref> though this still requires the consent of two [[National Health Service]] doctors. Abortions in Great Britain are provided at no out-of-pocket cost to the patient by the NHS.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] are predominantly pro-abortion-rights parties, though with significant minorities in each either holding more restrictive definitions of the right to choose, or subscribing to an anti-abortion analysis. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is more evenly split between both camps and its leader, [[David Cameron]], supports abortion on demand in the early stages of pregnancy.<ref>[http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/20th-june-2008/3/david-cameron-supports-abortion-on-demand David Cameron supports abortion on demand], [[Catholic Herald]], 20 June 2008.</ref>
