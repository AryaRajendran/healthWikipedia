[[File:Major cellular sources of Reactive Oxygen Species in living cells.jpg|thumb|Major cellular sources of ROS in living non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] cells. From a review by Novo and Parola, 2008.]]
'''Reactive oxygen species''' (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen.  Examples include [[oxygen]] [[ion]]s and [[peroxide]]s. 
ROS form as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of [[oxygen]] and have important roles in [[cell signaling]] and [[homeostasis]].<ref name="Devasagayam 2004 796">{{cite journal|last=Devasagayam|first=TPA|coauthors=Tilak JC, Boloor KK, Sane Ketaki S, Ghaskadbi Saroj S, Lele RD|title=Free Radicals and Antioxidants in Human Health: Current Status and Future Prospects|journal=Journal of Association of Physicians of India (JAPI)|year=2004|month=October|volume=52|pages=796}}</ref> However, during times of environmental stress (e.g., UV or heat exposure), ROS levels can increase dramatically.<ref name="Devasagayam 2004 796"/>  This may result in significant damage to cell structures. Cumulatively, this is known as [[oxidative stress]]. ROS are also generated by exogenous sources such as [[ionizing radiation]].

==Damaging effects==
Normally, cells defend themselves against ROS damage with [[enzymes]] such as [[alpha-1-microglobulin]], [[superoxide dismutase]]s, [[catalase]]s, [[lactoperoxidase]]s, [[glutathione peroxidase]]s and [[peroxiredoxin]]s. Small molecule antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C), [[tocopherol]] (vitamin E), [[uric acid]], and [[glutathione]] also play important roles as cellular antioxidants. In a similar manner, [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s assist in preventing ROS damage by scavenging [[free radicals]]. In contrast, the antioxidant ability of the extracellular space is less - e.g., the most important plasma antioxidant in humans is [[uric acid]].

Effects of ROS on cell metabolism are well documented in a variety of species. These include not only roles in [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death) but also positive effects such as the induction of host defence<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rada B, Leto TL |title=Oxidative innate immune defenses by Nox/Duox family NADPH oxidases |journal=Contrib Microbiol |volume=15 |issue= |pages=164–87 |year=2008 |pmid=18511861 |pmc=2776633 |doi=10.1159/000136357 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?doi=10.1159/000136357&typ=pdf |format=PDF |series=Contributions to Microbiology |isbn=978-3-8055-8548-4}} — Review</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Conner GE, Salathe M, Forteza R |title=Lactoperoxidase and Hydrogen Peroxide Metabolism in the Airway |journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med |volume=166 |issue=12 |pages=S57–61 |pmid=12471090 |year=2002 |month=December |doi=10.1164/rccm.2206018 |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/166/12/S1/S57 }}</ref>[[genes]] and mobilisation of ion transport systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} This implicates  them in control of cellular function.

These also provide a link to the adaptive [[immune system]] via the recruitment of [[leukocytes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Reactive oxygen species are implicated in cellular activity to a variety of inflammatory responses including [[cardiovascular disease]]. They may also be involved in [[hearing impairment]] via [[cochlea]]r damage induced by [[noise health effects|elevated sound levels]], in ototoxicity of drugs such as [[cisplatin]], and in congenital deafness in both animals and humans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} ROS are also implicated in mediation of [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death and [[ischaemic]] injury. Specific examples include [[stroke]] and [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Pathogen Response===
When a plant recognizes an attacking pathogen,  one of the first induced reactions is to rapidly produce superoxide or hydrogen peroxide to strengthen the cell wall. This prevents the spread of the pathogen to other parts of the plant, essentially forming a net around the pathogen to restrict movement and reproduction.

===Oxidative Damage===
In [[aerobic organism]]s the energy needed to fuel biological functions is produced in the [[mitochondria]] via the [[electron transport chain]].  In addition to energy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the potential to cause [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] damage are produced. ROS can damage [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and proteins, which, in theory, contributes to the [[physiology]] of [[ageing]].

ROS are produced as a normal product of [[cellular metabolism]]. In particular, one major contributor to oxidative damage is [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which is converted from [[superoxide]] that leaks from the mitochondria. [[Catalase]] and° [[superoxide dismutase]] ameliorate the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, respectively, by converting these compounds into [[oxygen]] and [[water]], [[benign]] [[molecule]]s.  However, this conversion is not 100% efficient, and residual peroxides persist in the cell. While ROS are produced as a product of normal cellular functioning, excessive amounts can cause deleterious effects.<ref name="isbn0-8247-1723-6">{{cite book | author =  Patel RP, T Cornwell,Darley-Usmar VM | authorlink = | editor = Packer L, Cadenas E  | title = Understanding the process of aging: the roles of mitochondria, free radicals, and antioxidants | publisher = Marcel Dekker | location = New York, N.Y | year = 1999 | chapter = The biochemistry of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite: implications for mitochondrial function | pages = 39–56 | isbn = 0-8247-1723-6 }}</ref>
Memory capabilities decline with age, evident in human degenerative diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's [[Physical fitness|fitness]] because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given [[cognitive tests]]. Results showed that the [[rat]]s performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function.<ref name="pmid11854529">{{cite journal | author = Liu J, Head E, Gharib AM, Yuan W, Ingersoll RT, Hagen TM, Cotman CW, Ames BN | title = Memory loss in old rats is associated with brain mitochondrial decay and RNA/DNA oxidation: partial reversal by feeding acetyl-L-carnitine and/or R-alpha -lipoic acid | journal = Proc.

The accumulation of oxidative damage and its implications for aging depends on the particular [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in [[brain]] functioning. Older [[gerbils]] were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young [[mice]] with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function (Carney, 1991).

==Exogenous ROS==
Exogenous ROS can be produced from pollutants, tobacco, smoke, drugs, xenobiotics, or radiation.

Ionizing radiation can generate damaging intermediates through the interaction with water, a process termed [[radiolysis]]. Since water comprises 55-60% of the human body, the probability of radiolysis is quite high under the presence of ionizing radiation. In the process, water loses an electron and become highly reactive. Then through a three-step chain reaction, water is sequentially converted to hydroxyl radical (-OH), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub>-) and ultimately oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The hydroxyl radical is extremely reactive that immediately removes electrons from any molecule in its path, turning that molecule into a free radical and so propagating a chain reaction. But hydrogen peroxide is actually more damaging to DNA than hydroxyl radical since the lower reactivity of hydrogen peroxide provides enough time for the molecule to travel into the nucleus of the cell, subsequently wreaking havoc on macromolecules such as DNA.

==Endogenous ROS==
ROS are produced intracellularly through multiple mechanisms, the major sources being mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic re- ticulum, and the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex in cell membranes. <ref name=Muller2000>{{Cite journal  | title = The nature and mechanism of superoxide production by the electron transport chain: Its relevance to aging  | year = 2000  | author = Muller, Florian  | journal = AGE  | pages = 227–253  | volume = 23  | issue = 4  | doi = 10.1007/s11357-000-0022-9  | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref><ref name="pmid11139407">{{cite journal | author = Han D, Williams E, Cadenas E | title = Mitochondrial respiratory chain-dependent generation of superoxide anion and its release into the intermembrane space | journal = Biochem.

The process in which ATP is produced, called [[oxidative phosphorylation]], involves the transport of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane by means of the [[electron transport chain]]. In the electron transport chain, electrons are passed through a series of [[protein]]s via oxidation-reduction reactions, with each acceptor protein along the chain having a greater reduction potential than the previous. The last destination for an electron along this chain is an oxygen molecule. In normal conditions, the oxygen is reduced to produce water; however, in about 0.1–2% of electrons passing through the chain (this number derives from studies in isolated mitochondria, though the exact rate in live organisms is yet to be fully agreed upon), oxygen is instead prematurely and incompletely reduced to give the superoxide radical (·O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), most well documented for [[Complex I]] and [[Complex III]]. <ref name="pmid23442817">{{cite journal |author = Li X, Fang P, Mai J, "et al." |title = Targeting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species as novel therapy for inflammatory diseases and cancers | journal = J Hematol Oncol. | volume = 6 | issue = 19 | year = 2013 | month = February | pmid = 23442817|doi = 10.1186/1756-8722-6-19 }}</ref> Superoxide is not particularly reactive by itself, but can inactivate specific enzymes or initiate [[lipid peroxidation]] in its protonated form, hydroperoxyl [[hydroperoxyl|HO<sub>2</sub>]]·. The pKa of hydroperoxyl is 4.8. Thus, at physiological pH, the majority will exist as superoxide. 

If too much damage is present in mitochondria, a cell undergoes [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death. Bcl-2 proteins are layered on the surface of the mitochondria, detect damage, and activate a class of proteins called Bax, which punch holes in the mitochondrial membrane, causing cytochrome C to leak out. This cytochrome C binds to Apaf-1, or apoptotic protease activating factor-1, which is free-floating in the cell's cytoplasm. Using energy from the ATPs in the mitochondrion, the Apaf-1 and cytochrome C bind together to form apoptosomes. The [[apoptosome]]s bind to and activate caspase-9, another free-floating protein. The caspase-9 then cleaves the proteins of the mitochondrial membrane, causing it to break down and start a chain reaction of protein denaturation and eventually [[phagocytosis]] of the cell.

==Superoxide dismutase==
{{main|Superoxide dismutase}}
[[Superoxide dismutase]]s (SOD) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. As such, they are an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen. In mammals and most chordates, three forms of superoxide dismutase are present. SOD1 is located primarily in the cytoplasm, SOD2 in the mitochondria and SOD3 is extracellular. The first is a dimer (consists of two units), while the others are tetramers (four subunits). SOD1 and SOD3 contain copper and zinc ions, while SOD2 has a manganese ion in its reactive centre. The genes are located on chromosomes 21, 6, and 4, respectively (21q22.1, 6q25.3 and 4p15.3-p15.1).

The SOD-catalysed [[dismutation]] of [[superoxide]] may be written with the following half-reactions :
* M<sup>(n+1)+</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;SOD + O<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> → M<sup>n+</sup> &minus; SOD + O<sub>2</sub>
* M<sup>n+</sup> &minus; SOD + O<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup> → M<sup>(n+1)+</sup> &minus; SOD + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

where M = [[Copper|Cu]] (n=1) ; [[manganese|Mn]] (n=2) ; [[iron|Fe]] (n=2) ; [[nickel|Ni]] (n=2).

In this reaction the [[oxidation state]] of the metal cation oscillates between n and n+1.

Catalase, which is concentrated in [[peroxisomes]] located next to mitochondria, reacts with the hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the formation of water and oxygen. [[Glutathione peroxidase]] reduces hydrogen peroxide by transferring the energy of the reactive peroxides to a very small sulfur-containing protein called [[glutathione]]. The selenium contained in these enzymes acts as the reactive center, carrying reactive electrons from the peroxide to the glutathione. [[Peroxiredoxins]] also degrade H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, within the mitochondria, cytosol, and nucleus.

* 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> ''(catalase)''

* 2GSH + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → GS–SG + 2H<sub>2</sub>O  ''(glutathione peroxidase)''

==Cause of aging==
According to the [[Free-radical theory]], oxidative damage initiated by reactive oxygen species is a major contributor to the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (as one would expect from the theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in [[Drosophila]] do show that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes).  Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans  <ref name="pmid19197346">{{cite journal |author=Van Raamsdonk JM, Hekimi S |title=Deletion of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase sod-2 extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e1000361 |year=2009 |month=February |pmid=19197346 |pmc=2628729 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000361 |url=}}</ref>

In mice, the story is somewhat similar. Deleting antioxidant enzymes, in general, yields shorter lifespan, though overexpression studies have not (with some recent exceptions) consistently extended lifespan.<ref name="pmid17640558">{{cite journal | author = Muller FL, Lustgarten MS, Jang Y, Richardson A, Van Remmen H | title = Trends in oxidative aging theories | journal = Free Radic.

==ROS in the context of cancer==
ROS are constantly generated and eliminated in the biological system and are required to drive regulatory pathways. <ref>{{cite journal |author=Dickinson BC, Chang CJ |title=Chemistry and biology of reactive oxygen species in signaling or stress responses |journal=[[Nat. Chem. Biol.]] |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=504–11 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21769097 |pmc=3390228 |doi=10.1038/nchembio.607 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nchembio.607}}</ref> Under normal physiologic conditions, cells control ROS levels by balancing the generation of ROS with their elimination by scavenging system. But, under oxidative stress conditions, excessive ROS can damage cellular proteins ,lipids and DNA, leading to fatal lesions in cell that contribute to carcinogenesis. 

Cancer cells exhibit greater ROS stress than normal cells do, partly due to oncogenic stimulation, increasted metabolic activity and mitochondrial malfunction. ROS is a double-edged sword. On one hand, at low levels, ROS facilitates cancer cell survival since cell-cycle progression driven by growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) require ROS for activation <ref>{{cite journal |author=Irani K, Xia Y, Zweier JL, ''et al.'' |title=Mitogenic signaling mediated by oxidants in Ras-transformed fibroblasts |journal=[[Science (journal)&#124;Science]] |volume=275 |issue=5306 |pages=1649–52 |year=1997 |month=March |pmid=9054359 |doi= |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9054359}}</ref> and chronic inflammation, a major mediator of cancer, is regulated by ROS. On the other hand, a high level of ROS can suppress tumor growth through the sustained activation of cell-cycle inhibitor <ref>{{cite journal |author=Ramsey MR, Sharpless NE |title=ROS as a tumour suppressor? |journal=[[Nat.

Modest levels of ROS are required for cancer cells to survive, whereas excessive levels kill them.

Metabolic adaptation in tumours balances the cells' need for energy with equally important need for macromolecular building blocks and tighter control of redox balance. As a result, production of [[NADPH]] is greatly enhanced, which functions as a cofactor to provide reducing power in many enzymatic reactions for macromolecular biosynthesis and at the same time rescuing the cells from excessive ROS produced during rapid proliferation. Cells counterbalance the detrimental effects of ROS by producing antioxidant molecules, such as reduced glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (TRX), which rely on the reducing power of NADPH to maintain their activities.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cairns RA, Harris IS, Mak TW |title=Regulation of cancer cell metabolism |journal=[[Nat.

Most risk factors associated with cancer interact with cells through the generation of ROS. ROS then activate various transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&kappa;B), activator protein-1 (AP-1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1&alpha; and signal transducer and activtor of transcription 3 (STAT3), leading to expression of proteins that control inflammation; cellular transformation; tumor cell survival; tumor cell proliferation; and invasion, agiogenesis as well as metastasis. And ROS also control the expression of various tumor supressor genes such as p53, retinoblastoma gene (Rb), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).<ref name="pmid22117137">{{cite journal |author=Gupta SC, Hevia D, Patchva S, Park B, Koh W, Aggarwal BB |title=Upsides and downsides of reactive oxygen species for cancer: the roles of reactive oxygen species in tumorigenesis, prevention, and therapy |journal=[[Antioxid.

===ROS and carcinogenesis===
ROS-related oxidation of DNA is one of the main causes of mutations, which can produce several types of DNA damage, including  non-bulky (8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidine) and bulky (cyclopurine and etheno adducts) base modifications, abasic sites, non-conventional single-strand breaks, protein-DNA adducts, and intra/interstrand DNA crosslinks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Waris G, Ahsan H |title=Reactive oxygen species: role in the development of cancer and various chronic conditions |journal=[[J Carcinog]] |volume=5 |issue= |pages=14 |year=2006 |pmid=16689993 |pmc=1479806 |doi=10.1186/1477-3163-5-14 |url=http://www.carcinogenesis.com/article.asp?issn=1477-3163;year=2006;volume=5;issue=1;spage=14;epage=14;aulast=Waris}}</ref> It has been estimated that endogenous ROS produced via normal cell metabolism modify approximately 20,000 bases of DNA per day in a single cell. 8-oxoguanine is the most abundant among various oxidized nitrogeneous bases observed. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase mispairs 8-oxoguanine with adenin, leading to a G->T transversion mutation. The resulting genomic instability directly contributes to carcinogenesis.

===ROS and cell proliferation===
Uncontrolled proliferation is a hallmark of cancer cells. Both exogenous and endogenous ROS have been shown to enhance proliferatin of cancer cells. The role of ROS in promoting tumor proliferation is further supported by the observation that agents with potential to inhibit ROS generation can also inhibit cancer cell proliferation.<ref name="pmid22117137"/> Although ROS can promote tumor cell proliferation, a great increase in ROS has been associated with reduced cancer cell proliferation by induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest; increased phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1), Chk 2; and reduced cell division cycle 25 homolog c (CDC25).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ames BN |title=Dietary carcinogens and anticarcinogens.

===ROS and cell death===
A cancer cell can die in three ways: apoptosis, necrosis and authophagy. Excessive ROS can induce apoptosis through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ozben T |title=Oxidative stress and apoptosis: impact on cancer therapy |journal=[[J Pharm Sci]] |volume=96 |issue=9 |pages=2181–96 |year=2007 |month=September |pmid=17593552 |doi=10.1002/jps.20874 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jps.20874}}</ref>. In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, ROS are generated by Fas ligand as an upstream event for Fas activation via phosphorylation, which is necessary for subsequent recruitment of Fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase 8 as well as apoptosis induction.<ref name="pmid22117137"/> In the intrinsic pathway, ROS funciton to facilitate cytochrome c release by activating activating pore-stabilizing proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) as well as inhibiting pore-destabilizing proteins (Bcl-2-associated X protein, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martindale JL, Holbrook NJ |title=Cellular response to oxidative stress: signaling for suicide and survival |journal=[[J.

===ROS, tumor cell invasion, angiogeneis and metastasis ===
After growth factor stimulation of RTKs, ROS can trigger activation of signaling pathways involved in cell migration and invasion such as members of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family -extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun NH-2 terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK. ROS can also promote migration by augmenting phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) p130Cas and paxilin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tochhawng L, Deng S, Pervaiz S, Yap CT |title=Redox regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion |journal=[[Mitochondrion]] |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=246–53 |year=2013 |month=May |pmid=22960576 |doi=10.1016/j.mito.2012.08.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567-7249(12)00203-6}}</ref>

Both in vitro and in vivo, ROS has been shown to induce transcription factors and modulate signaling molecules involved in angiogenesis (MMP, VEGF) and metastasis (upregulation of AP-1, CXCR4, AKT and downregulation of PTEN). <ref name="pmid22117137"/>

===ROS, chronic inflammation and cancer===
Experimental and epidemiologic research over the past several years has indicated close associations between ROS, chronic inflammation, and cancer.<ref name="pmid22117137"/> ROS induces chronic inflammation by the induction of COX-2, inflammatory cytokines (TNF&alpha;, interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6), chemokines (IL-8, CXCR4) and pro-inflammatory transcription factors (NF-&kappa;B). <ref name="pmid22117137"/> These chemokines and chemokine receptors in turn promotes invasion and metastasis of various tumor types. 

===ROS and cancer therapy ===
Both ROS-elevating and ROS-eliminating strategies have been developed with the former being predominantly used.Cancer cells with elevated ROS levels depend heavily on the antioxidant defense system. ROS-elevating drugs further increase cellular ROS stress level, either by direct ROS-generation (e.g. motexafin gadolinium, elesclomol) or by agents that abrogate the inherent antioxidant system such as SOD inhibitor (e.g. ATN-224, 2-methoxyestradiol) and GSH inhibitor (e.g. PEITC, buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)). The result is an overall increase in endogenous ROS, which when above a cellular tolerability threshold may induce cell death.<ref name="pmid16959608">{{cite journal |author=Kong Q, Beel JA, Lillehei KO |title=A threshold concept for cancer therapy |journal=[[Med. Hypotheses]] |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=29–35 |year=2000 |month=July |pmid=11021322 |doi=10.1054/mehy.1999.0982 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-9877(99)90982-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Schumacker PT |title=Reactive oxygen species in cancer cells: live by the sword, die by the sword |journal=[[Cancer Cell]] |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=175–6 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16959608 |doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2006.08.015 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1535-6108(06)00255-8}}</ref> On the other hand, normal cells appear to have, under lower basal stress and reserve, a higher capacity to cope with additional ROS-generating insults than cancer cells do.<ref name="pmid16959608"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Trachootham D, Alexandre J, Huang P |title=Targeting cancer cells by ROS-mediated mechanisms: a radical therapeutic approach? |journal=[[Nat Rev Drug Discov]] |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=579–91 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19478820 |doi=10.1038/nrd2803 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrd2803}}</ref> Therefore, preferentially accumulation ROS in cancer cells to achieve selective killing is possible. 

Radiotherapy also relies on ROS toxicity to eradicate tumor cells. Radiotherapy uses X-rays, &gamma;-rays as well as heavy particle radiation such as protons and neutrons to induce ROS-mediated cell death and mitotic failure. <ref name="pmid22117137"/>

Due to the dual role of ROS, both prooxidant and antioxidant-based anticancer agents have been developed. However, modulation of ROS signaling alone seems not to be an ideal approach due to adaptation of cancer cells to ROS stress, redundant pathways for supporting cancer growth and toxicity from ROS-generating anticancer drugs.Combinations of ROS-generating drugs with pharmaceuticals that can break the redox adaptation could be a better strategy for enhancing cancer cell cytotoxicity. <ref name="pmid22117137"/>


<!-- ====ROS-directed cancer chemotherapeutics====
Recent research demonstrates that redox dysregulation originating from metabolic alterations and dependence on [[mitogenic]] and survival signaling through ROS represents a specific vulnerability of malignant cells that can be selectively targeted by pro- and antioxidant redox chemotherapeutics.<ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wondrak GT |title=Redox-directed cancer therapeutics: molecular mechanisms and opportunities |journal=Antioxid.
