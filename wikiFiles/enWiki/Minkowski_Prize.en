The '''Minkowski Prize''' is given by the [[European Association for the Study of Diabetes]] (EASD), in recognition to research which has been carried out by a person normally residing in Europe, as manifested by publications which contribute to the advancement of knowledge concerning [[diabetes mellitus]]. The Prize honors the name of [[Oskar Minkowski]] (1858–1931), a [[physician]] and [[physiologist]] who was the discoverer of the role of [[pancreas]] in the control of [[glucose]] [[metabolism]]. It is awarded annually since 1966 and the winner is invited to pronounce a Minkowski Lecture during the EASD Annual Conference.

Since 1966 the award is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company [[Sanofi-Aventis]]. The prize consists of a certificate and 20,000 euros plus travel expenses. The candidate must be less than 45 years of age on 1 January of the year of award. Self-nomination is also possible.
