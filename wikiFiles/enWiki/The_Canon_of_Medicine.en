'''''The Canon of Medicine''''' ({{lang-ar|القانون في الطب}} ''al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb'') is an encyclopedia of [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|medicine]] in five books compiled by [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]] (Avicenna) and completed in 1025.<ref name=Stanley>{{citation|title=Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function|first=Stanley|last=Finger|year=1994|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-514694-8|page=70}}</ref> It presents a clear and organized summary of all the medical knowledge of the time.

'''Canon''' from Latin canōn, from Ancient Greek κανών (kanón, “measuring rod, standard”), akin to κάννα (kanna, “reed”), perhaps from Semitic (compare Arabic قانون (Qānūn, “law”) Hebrew קנה (qaneh, “reed”)). also  '''''Qanun''''', means "law" in Arabic, Persian, [[Urdu]] and Turkish (spelled as '''''Kanun'''''), the ''Canon of Medicine'' remained a [[Medicine|medical]] authority for centuries. It set the standards for medicine in Medieval [[Europe]] and the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]], and is Avicenna's most renowned written work. ''Qanun'' was used at many medical schools—at [[University of Montpellier]], [[France]], as late as 1650.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine The Canon of Medicine (work by Avicenna)], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''</ref> Much of the book was also translated into Chinese as the ''Huihui Yaofang'' (''Prescriptions of the Hui Nationality'') by the [[Hui people]] in [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan China]].<ref>{{citation|title=Oriental Medicine|last=Jan Van Alphen, Anthony Aris|first=Fernand Meyer, Mark De Fraeye|publisher=Serindia Publications|year=1995|isbn=0-906026-36-9|page=201}}</ref> The ''Canon'' is used in [[Unani|Unani (Ionian)]] medicine, a form of [[traditional medicine]] practiced in [[India]]. The principles of medicine described by the ''Canon'' ten centuries ago are still taught at [[UCLA]] and [[Yale University]], among others, as part of the history of medicine.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[George Sarton]], the father of the [[history of science]], wrote in the ''Introduction to the History of Science'':

{{quote|"One of the most famous exponents of Muslim [[universalism]] and an eminent figure in Islamic learning was Ibn Sina, known in the West as Avicenna (981-1037). For a thousand years he has retained his original renown as one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history. His most important medical works are the Qanun (Canon) and a treatise on [[Heart|Cardiac]] [[drug]]s. The 'Qanun' is an immense encyclopedia of medicine. It contains some of the most illuminating thoughts pertaining to distinction of [[mediastinitis]] from [[pleurisy]]; [[Infectious disease|contagious nature]] of [[Tuberculosis|phthisis]]; distribution of diseases by water and soil; careful description of skin troubles; of [[sexual disease]]s and [[perversion]]s; of [[Anxiety|nervous ailments]]."}}

== Influence in Western world ==
[[Image:Canons of medicine.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Latin]] copy of the ''Canon of Medicine'', dated 1484, located at the P.I. Nixon Medical Historical Library of the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]].]]
The ''Qanun'' was translated into Latin as ''Canon medicinae'' by [[Gerard of Cremona]] in the 12th century. Henceforth the ''Canon'' served as the chief guide to medical science in the West and is said to have influenced [[Leonardo da Vinci]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}. Its [[encyclopedia|encyclopaedic]] content, its systematic arrangement and [[philosophy|philosophical]] plan soon worked its way into a position of pre-eminence in the medical literature of Europe, displacing the works of [[Galen]] and becoming the text book for medical [[education]] in the schools of Europe. The text was read in the medical schools at [[Montpellier]] and [[Leuven]] as late as 1650, and [[Arnold C. Klebs]] described it as "one of the most significant intellectual phenomena of all times."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the words of Dr. [[William Osler]], the ''Qanun'' has remained "a medical [[bible]] for a longer time than any other work".

The first three books of the Latin ''Canon'' were printed in 1472, and a complete edition appeared in 1473. In the last 30 years of the 15th century it passed through 15 Latin editions. In recent years, a partial translation into [[English language|English]] was made.

The influential Canadian physician, Sir [[William Osler]], described the ''Canon'' as "the most famous medical textbook ever written" noting that it remained "a medical bible for a longer time than any other work."<ref>{{citation|title=The Evolution Of Modern Medicine|first=William|last=Osler|authorlink=William Osler|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]]|year=2004|isbn=1-4191-6153-9|page=71}}</ref> In 2006, Professor John Urquhart noted the relevance of the ''Canon'' to modern medicine, comparing it to an influential medical work of the 19th century, ''[[The Principles and Practice of Medicine]]'' (1892) by Osler himself, and concluded:

{{quote|"If the year were 1900 and you were marooned and in need of a guide for practical medicine, which book would you want by your side?" My choice was Ibn Sina. A leading reason is that Ibn Sina gives an integrated view of surgery and medicine, whereas Osler largely shuns intervention. Ibn Sina, for example, tells how to judge the margin of healthy tissue to take with an amputation, a basic topic uncovered by Osler. The gap between medicine and surgery is now closing, with the advent of [[interventional cardiology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[radiology]], etc. Ibn Sina correctly saw medicine and surgery as one.<ref>{{citation|author=Professor John Urquhart|title=How Islam changed medicine: Ibn Sina (Avicenna) saw medicine and surgery as one|journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=332|page=120|date=14 January 2006|doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7533.120-b|pmid=16410600|issue=7533|pmc=1326980}}</ref>}}

Mona Nasser Aida Tibi and Emilie Savage-Smith note: "The enduring respect in the 21st century for a book written a millennium earlier is testimony to Ibn Sina's achievement."<ref>{{citation|title=Ibn Sina's Canon of Medicine: 11th century rules for assessing the effects of drugs|last=Mona Nasser Aida Tibi|first=Emilie Savage-Smith|journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]|year=2009|volume=102|pages=78–80|doi=10.1258/jrsm.2008.08k040|pmid=19208873|last2=Tibi|first2=A|last3=Savage-Smith|first3=E|issue=2}}</ref>

==Overview==
The book explains the causes of [[health]] and [[disease]]. Ibn Sina believed that the [[human body]] cannot be restored to health unless the causes of both health and disease are determined. He defined medicine (''tibb'') as follows:

{{quote|"Medicine is the [[science]] by which we learn the various states of the body; in health, when not in health; the means by which health is likely to be lost; and, when lost, is likely to be restored. In other words, it is the art whereby health is concerned and the art by which it is restored after being lost."<ref>{{citation|last=Howell|first=Trevor H.|title=Avicenna and His Regimen of Old Age|journal=Age and Ageing|year=1987|volume=16|pages=58–59|doi=10.1093/ageing/16.1.58|pmid=3551552|issue=1}}</ref>}}

Avicenna regarded the causes of good health and diseases to be:

# The Material Causes
# The Elements
# The Humors
# The Variability of the Tumors
# The Temperaments
# The Psychic Faculties
# The Vital Force
# The Organs
# The Efficient Causes
# The Formal Causes
# The Vital Faculties
# The Final Causes

The ''Qanun'' distinguishes [[mediastinitis]] from [[pleurisy]] and recognises the [[Contagious disease|contagious]] nature of phthisis ([[tuberculosis]] of the lung) and the spread of disease by water and soil. It gives a scientific [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[ankylostomiasis]] and attributes the condition to an intestinal worm. The ''Qanun'' points out the importance of [[diet (nutrition)|dietetics]], the influence of [[climate]] and [[social environment|environment]] on health, and the surgical use of oral [[anaesthetic]]s.<ref>[http://www.unani.com/avicenna%20story%203.htm ''The Canon of Medicine''], The American Institute of Unani Medicine, 2003.</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2011}} Ibn Sina advised [[surgery|surgeons]] to treat [[cancer]] in its earliest stages, ensuring the removal of all the diseased tissue.<ref name=Patricia>Patricia Skinner (2001), [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2603/is_0007/ai_2603000716 Unani-tibbi], ''Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine''unreliable source</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2011}} The ''Qanun'' 's ''materia medica'' considers some 800 tested [[Medication|drugs]], with comments on their application and effectiveness.<ref name=Jacquart/> He recommended the [[animal testing|testing]] of a new drug on animals and humans prior to general use.

The earliest known copy of volume 5 of the ''Canon of Medicine'' dated 1052 is held in the collection of the [[Aga Khan]] and is to be housed in the [[Aga Khan Museum]] planned for [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akdn.org/museum/exhibitions_spirit.asp|title=Exhibitions: Spirit and Life - Aga Khan Museum|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref>

==Book 1 part 1 Humours and temperaments==

===Four Humours===
''The Canon of Medicine'' is based upon the [[Humorism|Four Humours]] of Hippocratic medicine, but refines in various ways. In disease [[pathogenesis]], for example, Avicenna "added his own view of different types of spirits (or vital life essences) and souls, whose disturbances might lead to bodily diseases because of a close association between them and such master organs as the brain and heart<ref>{{citation|title=Vasovagal syncope in the Canon of Avicenna: The first mention of carotid artery hypersensitivity|last=Mohammadali M. Shojaa, R. Shane Tubbsb, Marios Loukasc|first=Majid Khalilid, Farid Alakbarlie, Aaron A. Cohen-Gadola|journal=International Journal of Cardiology|volume=134|issue=3|date=29 May 2009|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2009.02.035|pages=297–301|pmid=19332359|last2=Tubbs|first2=RS|last3=Loukas|first3=M|last4=Khalili|first4=M|last5=Alakbarli|first5=F|last6=Cohen-Gadol|first6=AA}}</ref> An element of such belief is apparent in the chapter of ''al-Lawa''" (see [[#Cardiology|Cardiology]] section), which relates "the manifestations to an interruption of vital life essence to the brain." He combined his own view with that of the Four Humours to establish a new doctrine to explain the mechanisms of various diseases in another work he wrote, ''Treatise on Pulse''

{{quote|“From mixture of the four [humors] in different weights, [God the most high] created different organs; one with more blood like muscle, one with more black bile like bone, one with more phlegm like brain, and one with more yellow bile like lung.}}

{{quote|[God the most high] created the souls from the softness of humors; each soul has it own weight and amalgamation. The generation and nourishment of proper soul takes place in the heart; it resides in the heart and arteries, and is transmitted from the heart to the organs through the arteries. At first, it [proper soul] enters the master organs such as the brain, liver or reproductive organs; from there it goes to other organs while the nature of the soul is being modified in each [of them]. As long as [the soul] is in the heart, it is quite warm, with the nature of fire, and the softness of bile is dominant. Then, that part which goes to the brain to keep it vital and functioning, becomes colder and wetter, and in its composition the serous softness and phlegm vapor dominate. That part, which enters the liver to keep its vitality and functions, becomes softer, warmer and sensibly wet, and in its composition the softness of air and vapor of blood dominate.}}

{{quote|In general, there are four types of proper spirit: One is brutal spirit residing in the heart and it is the origin of all spirits. Another – as physicians refer to it – is sensual spirit residing in the brain. The third – as physicians refer to it – is natural spirit residing in the liver. The fourth is generative – i.e. procreative – spirits residing in the gonads. These four spirits go-between the soul of absolute purity and the body of absolute impurity.”}}

===Four Temperaments===
The ''Canon'' also adopted the ancient theory of [[Four Temperaments]] and extended it to encompass "[[emotion]]al aspects, [[Mental health|mental capacity]], [[moral]] attitudes, [[self-awareness]], movements and [[dream]]s." It summarized Avicenna's own theory of four [[temperament]]s in a [[Table (information)|table]] presented as follows:<ref name=Lutz>{{citation|first=Peter L.|last=Lutz|year=2002|title=The Rise of Experimental Biology: An Illustrated History|page=60|publisher=[[Humana Press]]|isbn=0-89603-835-1}}</ref>

==Book 1 part 2 general Anatomy and physiology==

Writings on [[anatomy]] in the ''Canon'' are scattered throughout the text in sections regarding to illnesses related to certain body parts. The ''Canon'' included numerous discussions on anatomy and diagrams on certain body parts, including the first diagrams of the [[cranial sutures]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/arabic/E8.html ''The Canon on Medicine''], [[United States National Library of Medicine]].</ref>

===Blood pressure===
Avicenna dedicated a chapter of the ''Canon'' to [[blood pressure]]. He was able to discover the causes of [[bleeding]] and haemorrhage, and discovered that haemorrhage could be induced by high blood pressure because of higher levels of [[cholesterol]] in the blood. This led him to investigate methods of controlling blood pressure.<ref name=Aydin>{{citation | author = Professor Dr. İbrahim Hakkı Aydin | year = 2001 | title = Avicenna And Modern Neurological Sciences | url = | journal = Journal of Academic Researches in Religious Sciences | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 1–4 }}</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2011}}

===Dissection===
The ''Canon'' distinguished anatomy "from other aspects of medicine by its need for a different methodology." It thus stated:<ref>{{citation|first=Emilie|last=Savage-Smith|title=Attitudes Toward Dissection in Medieval Islam|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|year=1995|volume=50|issue=1|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=67–110 [92–3]|doi=10.1093/jhmas/50.1.67|pmid=7876530}}</ref>

{{quote|"As for the parts of the body and their functions, it is necessary that they be approached through [[observation]] (''hiss'') and [[dissection]] (''tashrih''), while those things that must be conjectured and demonstrated by reason are diseases and their particular causes and their symptoms and how disease can be abated and health maintained."}}

===Neuroanatomy and neurophysiology===
Avicenna discovered the [[cerebellar vermis]]&mdash;which he named "vermis"&mdash;and the [[caudate nucleus]], which he named "tailed nucleus" or "nucleus caudatus". These terms are still used in modern [[neuroanatomy]] and [[neurophysiology]].<ref name=Aydin/>{{Verify source|date=June 2011}}

The ''Canon'' was also the earliest text to note that intellectual dysfunctions were largely due to deficits in the [[brain]]'s middle [[Ventricular system|ventricle]], and that the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain mediated [[common sense]] and [[reasoning]].<ref name=Millon>{{citation|title=Masters of the Mind: Exploring the Story of Mental Illness from Ancient Times to the New Millennium|first=Theodore|last=Millon|year=2004|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-0-471-46985-8|page=38}}</ref>

===Ophthalmology===
The contributions of the ''Canon'' to [[ophthalmology in medieval Islam]] include its descriptions and explanations on the physiology of [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]s, which still forms a basis of information for modern [[ophthalmology]]. He also provided useful information on the [[optic nerve]]s, [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], and central and peripheral [[Facial nerve paralysis|facial paralyses]].<ref name=Aydin/>{{Verify source|date=June 2011}}

Another contribution the ''Canon'' made to [[ophthalmology]] was the suggestion that "the [[optic nerve]]s did cross."<ref name=Stanley/>

==Book 2 (materia medica)==
The ''Canon'' described no less than 700 preparations of [[medication]]s, their properties, mode of action and their indications. He devoted a whole volume to simple and compound [[drug]]s in ''The Canon of Medicine''. It credits many of them to a variety of Arabic, Greek and Indian authors, and also includes drugs imported from [[Traditional Chinese medicine|China]], along with many of Ibn Sina's own contributions. Using his expertise, he was often critical of the descriptions given by previous authors and revised many of their descriptions.<ref name=Jacquart>{{citation|last=Jacquart|first=Danielle|journal=European Review|volume=16|issue=2|pages=219–227 [219 & 222–5|title=Islamic Pharmacology in the Middle Ages: Theories and Substances|doi=10.1017/S1062798708000215}}</ref>{{vn|date=September 2012}}
In [[Inhalation therapy|inhalational drug therapy]], the ''Canon'' described the inhalation of [[essential oil]]s from [[pine]] and [[eucalyptus]] to alleviate [[Respiratory disease|respiratory symptoms]]. Both of these compounds are still present in modern-day proprietary inhalational medicines.<ref>{{citation|title=Overcoming Steroid Insensitivity in Respiratory Disease|author=Ian M.

According to A. C. Crombie, the ''Canon'' contained "a set of seven rules that laid down the conditions for the [[experiment]]al use and testing of [[drug]]s" which were "a precise guide for practical experimentation" in the process of "discovering and proving the effectiveness of [[Medication|medical substances]] based in part on [[Galen]]."<ref name=Huff>{{Citation

#"The drug must be free from any extraneous accidental quality."
#"It must be used on a simple, not a composite, disease."
#"The drug must be tested with two contrary types of diseases, because sometimes a drug cures one disease by Its essential qualities and another by its accidental ones."
#"The quality of the drug must correspond to the strength of the disease. For example, there are some drugs whose heat is less than the coldness of certain diseases, so that they would have no effect on them."
#"The time of action must be observed, so that essence and accident are not confused."
#"The effect of the drug must be seen to occur constantly or in many cases, for if this did not happen, it was an accidental effect."
#"The experimentation must be done with the human body, for testing a drug on a lion or a horse might not prove anything about its effect on man."

The ''Canon'' lists 800 tested [[Medication|drugs]], including plant and mineral substances, with comments on their application and effectiveness. For each one, he described their pharmaceutical actions from a range of 22 possibilities (including resolution, astringency and softening), and their specific properties according to a grid of 11 types of diseases.<ref name=Jacquart>{{citation|last=Jacquart|first=Danielle|journal=European Review|volume=16|issue=2|pages=219–227 [223]|title=Islamic Pharmacology in the Middle Ages: Theories and Substances|doi=10.1017/S1062798708000215}}</ref>

===Inductive logic===
While Ibn Sina often relied on [[deductive reasoning]] in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' and other writings on [[logic in Islamic philosophy]], he used a different approach in ''The Canon of Medicine''. This text contributed to the development of [[inductive reasoning|inductive logic]], which it used to develop the idea of a [[syndrome]] in the [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of specific diseases. ''The Canon of Medicine'' was the first to describe the [[Mill's Methods|methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation]] which are critical to inductive logic and the [[scientific method]].<ref name="Goodman"/><ref>Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), ''Avicenna'', p. 33, [[Routledge]], ISBN 0-415-01929-X.</ref><ref>James Franklin (2001), ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'', pp. 177-8, Johns Hopkins University Press, ISBN 0-8018-6569-7</ref>
