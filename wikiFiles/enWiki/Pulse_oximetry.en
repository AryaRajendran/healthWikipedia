'''Pulse oximetry''' is a [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|non-invasive]] method allowing the monitoring of the saturation of a patient's [[hemoglobin]].

A sensor is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a [[fingertip]] or [[earlobe]], or in the case of an [[infant]], across a foot. Light of two wavelengths is passed through the patient to a photodetector. The changing absorbance at each of the [[wavelength]]s is measured, allowing determination of the [[absorption spectroscopy|absorbances]] due to the pulsing [[artery|arterial]] [[blood]] alone, excluding [[vein|venous]] blood, skin, bone, muscle, fat, and (in most cases) nail polish.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brand TM, Brand ME, Jay GD |title=Enamel nail polish does not interfere with pulse oximetry among normoxic volunteers |journal=J Clin Monit Comput |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=93–6 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=12212998 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=1387-1307&volume=17&page=93 |doi=10.1023/A:1016385222568}}</ref> With [[near-infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]] it is possible to measure both [[Oxyhemoglobin|oxygenated]] and deoxygenated hemoglobin on a peripheral scale (possible on both brain and muscle).

Reflectance pulse oximetry may be used as an alternative to transmissive pulse oximetery described above. This method does not require a thin section of the patient's body and is therefore well suited to more universal application such as the feet, forehead and chest, but it also has some limitations. Vasodilation and pooling of venous blood in the head due to compromised venous return to the heart, as occurs with congenital [[cyanotic]] heart disease patients, or in patients in the [[Trendelenburg position]], can cause a combination of arterial and venous pulsations in the forehead region and lead to spurious SpO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;([[Oxygenation (medical)#Measurements|Saturation of peripheral oxygen]]) results.<ref>Jorgensen JS, Schmid ER, Konig V, Faisst K, Huch A, Huch R.

==History==
In 1935, Karl Matthes (German physician 1905–1962) developed the first 2-wavelength ear O<sub>2</sub> saturation meter with red and green filters (later switched to red and infrared filters). His meter was the first device to measure O<sub>2</sub> saturation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Matthes |first=K |title=Untersuchungen über die Sauerstoffsättigung des menschlichen Arterienblutes |language=German |trans_title=Studies on the Oxygen Saturation of Arterial Human Blood |journal=Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology |volume=179 |issue=6 |pages=698–711 |doi=10.1007/BF01862691 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l453171600p28g93/ |accessdate=28 April 2011 |year=1935}}</ref>

The original oximeter was made by [[Glenn Allan Millikan]] in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Millikan G. A. |year=1942 |title=The oximeter: an instrument for measuring continuously oxygen-saturation of arterial blood in man |url= |journal=Rev. Sci. Instrum |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=434–444 |doi=10.1063/1.1769941 }}</ref> In 1949 Wood added a pressure capsule to squeeze blood out of ear to obtain zero setting in an effort to obtain absolute O<sub>2</sub> saturation value when blood was readmitted. The concept is similar to today's conventional pulse oximetry but was hard to implement because of unstable [[photocell]]s and light sources. This method is not used clinically. In 1964 Shaw assembled the first absolute reading ear oximeter by using eight wavelengths of light. Commercialized by [[Hewlett-Packard]], its use was limited to pulmonary functions and [[sleep laboratory|sleep laboratories]] due to cost and size.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Pulse oximetry was developed in 1972, by [[Takuo Aoyagi]] and Michio Kishi, bioengineers, at [[Nihon Kohden]] using the ratio of red to infrared light absorption of pulsating components at the measuring site. Susumu Nakajima, a surgeon, and his associates first tested the device in patients, reporting it in 1975.<ref>{{cite journal|first=John W. |last=Severinghaus |first2=Yoshiyuki |last2= Honda |title=History of Blood Gas Analysis. VII. Pulse Oximetry |url=http://www.masimo.com/Nellcorfiction/PDF_FF/History%20of%20Pulse%20Oximetry.pdf |journal=Journal of Clinical Monitoring |volume=3 |issue=2 |date=April 1987 |pages=135–138|pmid=3295125}}</ref> It was commercialized by [[Biox]] in 1981 and [[Nellcor]] in 1983. Biox was founded in 1979, and introduced the first pulse oximeter to commercial distribution in 1981. Biox initially focused on respiratory care, but when the company discovered that their pulse oximeters were being used in [[operating room]]s to monitor oxygen levels, Biox expanded its marketing resources to focus on operating rooms in late 1982. A competitor, Nellcor (now part of [[Covidien]], Ltd.), began to compete with Biox for the U.S. operating room market in 1983. Prior to the introduction of pulse oximetry, a patient's oxygenation could only be determined by [[arterial blood gas]], a single-point measurement that takes several minutes for sample collection and processing by a laboratory.  In the absence of oxygenation, [[brain damage|damage to the brain]] starts within 5 minutes with [[brain death]] ensuing within another 10–15 minutes. The worldwide market for pulse oximetry is over a billion dollars. With the introduction of pulse oximetry, a non-invasive, continuous measure of patient's oxygenation was possible, revolutionizing the practice of anesthesia and greatly improving patient safety. Prior to its introduction, studies in [[anesthesia]] journals estimated U.S. patient mortality as a consequence of undetected [[hypoxemia]] at 2,000 to 10,000 deaths per year, with no known estimate of patient morbidity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

By 1987, the standard of care for the administration of a general anesthetic in the U.S. included pulse oximetry. From the operating room, the use of pulse oximetry rapidly spread throughout the hospital, first to the [[recovery room]], and then into the various [[intensive care unit]]s. Pulse oximetry was of particular value in the neonatal unit where the patients do not thrive with inadequate oxygenation, but too much oxygen and fluctuations in oxygen concentration can lead to vision impairment or blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Furthermore, obtaining an arterial blood gas from a neonatal patient is painful to the patient and a major cause of neonatal anemia.<ref>Lin JC, Strauss RG, Kulhavy JC, et al. Phlebotomy overdraw in the neonatal intensive care nursery. Pediatrics. Aug 2000;106(2):E19.</ref>  Motion artifact can be a significant limitation to pulse oximetry monitoring resulting in frequent false alarms and loss of data. The reason for this is that during motion and low peripheral perfusion, many pulse oximeters cannot distinguish between pulsating arterial blood and moving venous blood, leading to underestimation of oxygen saturation.  Early studies of pulse oximetry performance during subject motion made clear the vulnerabilities of conventional pulse oximetry technologies to motion artifact.<ref>Barker SJ. "Motion-resistant" pulse oximetry: a comparison of new and old models. Anesth Analg. 2002;95(4):967–972.</ref><ref>Barker SJ, Shah NK. The effects of motion on the performance of pulse oximeters in volunteers (revised publication). Anesthesiology. 1997;86(1):101–108.</ref>
In 1995, Masimo introduced Signal Extraction Technology (SET) that could measure accurately during patient motion and low perfusion by separating the arterial signal from the venous and other signals. Since then, pulse oximetry manufacturers have developed new algorithms to reduce some false alarms during motion<ref>Jopling MW, Mannheimer PD, Bebout DE. Issues in the laboratory evaluation of pulse oximeter performance. Anesth Analg. Jan 2002;94(1 Suppl):S62–68.</ref> such as extending averaging times or freezing values on the screen, but they do not claim to measure changing conditions during motion and low perfusion.  So, there are  still important differences in performance of pulse oximeters during challenging conditions.<ref>Shah N, Ragaswamy HB, Govindugari K, Estanol L. Performance of three new-generation pulse oximeters during motion and low perfusion in volunteers. J Clin Anesth. May 22.</ref>

In 2004, a jury found that Nellcor infringed several Masimo patents related to measure-through motion and low perfusion signal processing technology.  In 2005, the appellate court affirmed the infringement findings against Nellcor, and instructed the District Court to enter a permanent injunction against Nellcor’s pulse oximeters (e.g., N-395, N-595) that were found to infringe.  In January 2006, Masimo and Nellcor entered into a settlement agreement, where Nellcor, among other things, agreed to discontinue shipment of the pulse oximeters that were found to infringe Masimo’s patents.

Published papers have compared signal extraction technology to other pulse oximetry technologies and have demonstrated consistent favorable results for signal extraction technology.<ref>Barker SJ.

In one study, retinopathy of prematurity (eye damage) was reduced by 58% in very low birth weight neonates at a center using signal extraction technology, while there was no decrease in retinopathy of prematurity at another center with the same clinicians using the same protocol but with non-signal extraction technology.<ref>Castillo A, Deulofeut R, Critz A, Sola A.

In 2009, the world's first Bluetooth-enabled fingertip pulse oximeter was introduced by [[Nonin Medical]], enabling clinicians to remotely monitor patients' pulses and oxygen saturation levels. It also allows patients to monitor their own health through online patient health records and home telemedicine system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/blogs/65775732.html?elr=KArks7PYDiaK7DUdcOy_nc:DKUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU |title=Tekne Awards Announced |work=Star Tribune |accessdate=2009-10-23 }}</ref>
In 2012, a pulse oximeter with integrated 802.11 wireless radio and a touchscreen interface was introduced by Masimo, allowing clinicians to monitor patients wherever they are at within the hospital.

==Function==
[[File:Pulse oximeter.JPG|thumb|Pulse oximeters using LED technology.]]
A blood-oxygen monitor displays the percentage of arterial [[hemoglobin]] in the [[oxyhemoglobin]] configuration. Acceptable normal ranges for patients without [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] with a [[hypoxic drive]] problem are from 95 to 99 percent, those with a hypoxic drive problem would expect values to be between 88 to 94 percent, values of 100 percent can indicate carbon monoxide poisoning. For a patient breathing room air, at not far [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], an estimate of arterial pO<sub>2</sub> can be made from the blood-oxygen monitor SpO<sub>2</sub> reading.

Pulse oximetry is a particularly convenient [[noninvasive]] measurement method. Typically it utilizes a pair of small [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) facing a [[photodiode]] through a translucent part of the patient's body, usually a fingertip or an earlobe. One LED is red, with [[wavelength]] of 660&nbsp;nm, and the other is [[infrared]], 905, 910, or 940&nbsp;nm. Absorption at these wavelengths differs significantly between oxyhemoglobin and its deoxygenated form; therefore, the oxy/deoxyhemoglobin ratio can be calculated from the ratio of the absorption of the red and infrared light. The absorbance of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin is the same ([[isosbestic point]]) for the wavelengths of 590 and 805&nbsp;nm; earlier equipment used these wavelengths for correction of hemoglobin concentration.<ref>[http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=332 Principles of pulse oximetry] ''Anaesthesia UK'' 11 Sept 2004.</ref>

The monitored signal fluctuates in time with the [[Heart rate|heart beat]] because the arterial [[blood vessel]]s expand and contract with each heartbeat. By examining only the varying part of the [[absorption spectrum]] (essentially, subtracting minimum absorption from peak absorption), a monitor can ignore other tissues or nail polish, (though black nail polish tends to distort readings)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brand TM, Brand ME, Jay GD | year = 2002 | month = Feb | title = Enamel nail polish does not interfere with pulse oximetry among normoxic volunteers | pmid=12212998 | journal = J Clin Monit Comput | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 93–6 | doi=10.1023/A:1016385222568}}</ref> and discern only the absorption caused by arterial blood. Thus, detecting a pulse is essential to the operation of a pulse oximeter and it will not function if there is none.

==Indication==
A pulse oximeter is a [[medical device]] that indirectly monitors the oxygen saturation of a patient's [[blood]] (as opposed to measuring oxygen saturation directly through a blood sample) and changes in blood volume in the skin, producing a [[photoplethysmogram]]. The pulse oximeter may be incorporated into a multiparameter patient monitor. Most monitors also display the pulse rate. Portable, battery-operated pulse oximeters are also available for transport or home blood-oxygen monitoring.

===Advantages===
A pulse oximeter is useful in any setting where a patient's [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] is unstable, including [[intensive care]], operating, recovery, emergency and hospital ward settings, [[aircraft pilot|pilots]] in unpressurized aircraft, for assessment of any patient's oxygenation, and determining the effectiveness of or need for supplemental [[oxygen]]. Assessing a patient's need for oxygen is the most essential element to life; no human life thrives in the absence of oxygen (cellular or gross). Although a pulse oximeter is used to monitor oxygenation, it cannot determine the metabolism of oxygen, or the amount of oxygen being used by a patient. For this purpose, it is necessary to also measure [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels. It is possible that it can also be used to detect abnormalities in ventilation. However, the use of a pulse oximeter to detect [[hypoventilation]] is impaired with the use of supplemental oxygen, as it is only when patients breathe room air that abnormalities in respiratory function can be detected reliably with its use. Therefore, the routine administration of supplemental oxygen may be unwarranted if the patient is able to maintain adequate oxygenation in room air, since it can result in hypoventilation going undetected.<ref>Fu ES, Downs JB, Schweiger JW, Miguel RV, Smith RA. Supplemental oxygen impairs detection of hypoventilation by pulse oximetry. Chest 2004;126:1552–8</ref>

Because of their simplicity of use and the ability to provide continuous and immediate oxygen saturation values, pulse oximeters are of critical importance in [[emergency medicine]] and are also very useful for patients with respiratory or cardiac problems, especially [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], or for diagnosis of some [[sleep disorders]] such as [[apnea]] and [[hypopnea]].<ref>[http://www.clinicalsleep.com/obstructive-sleep-apnea-cpap-therapy/diagnosis.cfm] Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Diagnosis</ref> Portable battery-operated pulse oximeters are useful for pilots operating in a non-pressurized aircraft above 10,000 feet (12,500 feet in the U.S.)<ref>[http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/BA9AFBF96DBC56F0852566CF006798F9?OpenDocument&Highlight=oxygen Code of Federal Regulations] ''Federal Aviation Administration''</ref> where supplemental oxygen is required. Portable pulse oximeters are also useful for mountain climbers and athletes whose oxygen levels may decrease at high [[altitudes]] or with exercise. Some portable pulse oximeters employ software that charts a patient's blood oxygen and pulse, serving as a reminder to check blood oxygen levels.

===Limitations===
Pulse oximetry measures solely oxygenation, not [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] and is not a complete measure of respiratory sufficiency. It is not a substitute for [[blood gases]] checked in a laboratory, because it gives no indication of base deficit, carbon dioxide levels, blood [[pH]], or [[bicarbonate]] (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) concentration. The metabolism of oxygen can be readily measured by monitoring expired CO<sub>2</sub>, but saturation figures give no information about blood oxygen content. Most of the oxygen in the blood is carried by hemoglobin; in severe anemia, the blood will carry less total oxygen, despite the hemoglobin being 100% saturated.

Erroneously low readings may be caused by [[hypoperfusion]] of the extremity being used for monitoring (often due to a limb being cold, or from [[vasoconstriction]] secondary to the use of [[vasopressor]] agents); incorrect sensor application; highly [[Callus|calloused]] skin; or movement (such as shivering), especially during hypoperfusion. To ensure accuracy, the sensor should return a steady pulse and/or pulse waveform. Pulse oximetry technologies differ in their abilities to provide accurate data during conditions of motion and low perfusion.<ref>Barker SJ. "Motion-resistant" pulse oximetry: a comparison of new and old models. Anesth Analg 2002;95:967–72.</ref> <ref name="Shah" /> 

Pulse oximetry also is not a complete measure of circulatory sufficiency. If there is insufficient [[Circulatory system|bloodflow]] or insufficient hemoglobin in the blood ([[anemia]]), tissues can suffer [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] despite high [[oxygen saturation]] in the blood that does arrive. In 2008, a pulse oximeter that can also measure hemoglobin levels in addition to oxygen saturation was introduced by Masimo.  In addition to the standard two wavelengths of light, the devices use multiple additional wavelengths of light to quantify hemoglobin.

Since pulse oximetry only measures the percentage of bound hemoglobin, a falsely high or falsely low reading will occur when hemoglobin binds to something other than oxygen:
* Hemoglobin has a higher affinity to carbon monoxide than oxygen, and a high reading may occur despite the patient actually being hypoxemic. In cases of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], this inaccuracy may delay the recognition of [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] (low blood oxygen level).
* [[Cyanide poisoning]] gives a high reading, because it reduces oxygen extraction from arterial blood. In this case, the reading is not false, as arterial blood oxygen is indeed high in early cyanide poisoning.
* [[Methemoglobinemia]] characteristically causes pulse oximetry readings in the mid-80s.

The only noninvasive method allowing continuous measurement of the dyshemoglobins is a pulse [[CO-oximeter]], invented in 2005 by Masimo. It provides clinicians a way to measure the dyshemoglobins carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin  along with total hemoglobin.

=== Increasing usage ===
According to a report by iData Research  the U.S. pulse oximetry monitoring market for equipment and sensors was over {{nowrap|700 million USD}} in 2011. <ref>U.S. Market for Patient Monitoring Equipment. i Data Research.
