'''Smoke inhalation''' is the primary [[cause of death]] for victims of indoor [[fire]]s.

Smoke inhalation injury refers to injury due to inhalation or exposure to hot gaseous products of [[combustion]]. This can cause serious respiratory complications.<ref>[http://www.edoctor.co.in/smokeinhalationinj/4522628104]</ref>

It is estimated that 50–80% of fire deaths are the result of [[smoke]] inhalation injuries, including burns to the respiratory system.<ref>[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/6413-1.asp http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/6413-1.asp]</ref> The hot smoke injures or kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation and swelling, caused by [[carbon monoxide]], [[cyanide]] and other combustion products.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms range from [[cough]]ing and [[vomiting]] to [[nausea]], sleepiness and confusion.  Burns to the nose, mouth and face; singed nostril hairs; and difficulty breathing / [[carbonaceous]] sputum (burned saliva) are also signs of smoke inhalation injury. Approximately one third of patients admitted to burns units have pulmonary injury from hot smoke inhalation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The death rate of patients with both severe burns and smoke inhalation can be in excess of 50%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Any person with apparent signs of smoke inhalation should be immediately evaluated by a medical professional such as a [[paramedic]] or physician.  Advanced medical care may be necessary to save the life of the patient, including [[mechanical ventilation]], even if the person is conscious and alert.  Pending advanced intervention, the patient should be brought into fresh air and given medical [[oxygen]] if available.

<!--==Mechanism==
Smoke inhalation causes three complications:
# ''Impaired or reduced levels of oxygen at the tissue level:'' This arises due to inhalation of [[carbon monoxide]] and is an immediate threat to life. Immediate treatment with 100% oxygen is essential and is given until the level of [[carboxyhaemoglobin]] (a product formed by combining of the [[haemoglobin]] molecule with carbon monoxide; reducing the amount of haemoglobin available to transport oxygen to tissues) falls to less than 10% and the metabolic [[acidosis]] (a condition in which there is excess of acid in the body causing severe chemical imbalances and [[electrolyte]] disturbances) has resolved. 
# ''Thermal injury to the upper airway:'' Hot gases cause burns to the mucosal surfaces of the upper airway. Its complications become evident in 18–24 hours. They are: [[oedema]], reduced ability to clear secretions, airway obstruction by swelling causing respiratory distress and noise on inspiration. In advanced stages respiratory failure can also occur. Treatment is humidified oxygen, head tilt to 30 degrees, suction to clear secretions and medicines to reduce the swelling of the [[mucosa]]. Mixtures of helium-oxygen (Heliox) gas may be useful to reduce laboured breathing. [[Endotracheal]] intubation may be needed to maintain airway patency especially for deep facial burns or swelling of the [[pharynx]]. Investigations include arterial blood gas analysis, [[fibre optic]] [[laryngoscope]] or [[bronchoscope]]. [[Tracheostomy]] should be avoided if possible because of an increased risk of pneumonia and sepsis. 
# ''Chemical injury'' to the lung is due to inhalation of toxic gases and products of combustion which includes [[aldehyde]]s and [[organic acid]]s. It can present with symptoms of [[bronchospasm]] (narrowing of the airways), difficulty in breathing, an increased rate of breathing, wheezing and a fast heart rate initially. A day or two later, there might be swelling of the smaller airways which may start sloughing off causing airway obstruction and pneumonia in 5–7 days.-->

== Treatment ==
Treatment consists of humidified oxygen, bronchodilators, suction, endotracheal tube and chest physiotherapy. There is no role for routine treatment of smoke inhalation with either antibiotics or steroids.  Treatment depends on the severity of the smoke inhalation.

=== Nebulized heparin and acetylcysteine ===
Inhalation therapy with nebulized [[heparin]] and [[acetylcysteine]] is usually started and continued for five to seven days during the hospital stay.<ref name="pmid9622463">{{cite journal| author=Desai MH, Mlcak R, Richardson J, Nichols R, Herndon DN| title=Reduction in mortality in pediatric patients with inhalation injury with aerosolized heparin/N-acetylcystine [correction of acetylcystine] therapy. | journal=J Burn Care Rehabil | year= 1998 | volume= 19 | issue= 3 | pages= 210–2 | pmid=9622463 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref><ref name="pmid19793551">{{cite journal| author=Cancio LC| title=Airway management and smoke inhalation injury in the burn patient. | journal=Clin Plast Surg | year= 2009 | volume= 36 | issue= 4 | pages= 555–67 | pmid=19793551 | doi=10.1016/j.cps.2009.05.013 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=19793551  }}</ref>

=== Oxygen therapy ===
[[Carbon monoxide]] (CO) is always presumed to be a complication in smoke inhalation.  The initial approach to presumed CO poisoning involves administering supplemental oxygen at a [[fraction of inspired oxygen]] (FiO2) of 100 percent and then the use of [[hyperbaric oxygen]] (HBO) therapy is evaluated by physicians.<ref name="pmid10713010">{{cite journal| author=Weaver LK, Howe S, Hopkins R, Chan KJ| title=Carboxyhemoglobin half-life in carbon monoxide-poisoned patients treated with 100% oxygen at atmospheric pressure. | journal=Chest | year= 2000 | volume= 117 | issue= 3 | pages= 801–8 | pmid=10713010 | doi= | pmc= | url= }}</ref>
