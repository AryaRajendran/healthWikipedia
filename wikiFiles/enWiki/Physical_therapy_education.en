===South Africa===

In [[South Africa]] the degree {B.PhysT, B.Sc.Physio or B.Physio,Ph.D. in (Physio)} consists of four years of general practice training, involving all aspects of Physiotherapy. Typically, the first year is made up of theoretical introduction. Gradually, time spent in supervised practice increases until the fourth year, in which the student generally spends about 80% in practice. In the fourth year, students are also expected to complete Physiotherapy research projects, which fulfills the requirements of an Honours degree. Professional practice can only be entered into after a state governed, compulsory year of community service is completed by the student after graduation.

All physiotherapist are First line practitioners (i.e. a health professional who can autonomously diagnose and treat), can refer patients to medical practitioner specialists and Imaging (e.g. for X-Ray, MRI, ultrasound and prescribe Certain medication and blood test relevant to their scope of practice) and issue a certificate of illness.

All practising physiotherapists in South Africa are required by law to register with the Health Professions Council of South Africa,<ref>[http://www.physiosa.org.za/?q=node/325 South African Society of Physiotherapy]</ref> the registering body for physiotherapists being the Professional Board for Physiotherapy, Podiatry and Biokinetics.<ref>[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/hpcsa/default.aspx?id=70 Health Professions Council of South Africa]</ref>

==Asia and Oceania==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], a few different programs are available at both undergraduate and post graduate level. The physiotherapy degree can be undertaken over a four-year period as an undergraduate or two to three years post graduate with the early components being predominantly theoretical including basic [[anatomy]], [[biology]], [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[kinesiology]], [[goniometry]] and [[physiology]]. In the latter half of the degree students partake in practical components focusing on musculoskeletal physiotherapy, neuromuscular physiotherapy, paediatric physiotherapy, geriatric physiotherapy, cardiothoracic physiotherapy, and women's health. The program generally progresses with an increasingly clinical focus and usually the final year involves practical placements at clinics, and research. Australian programs offer either the B.Physio, B.App.Sc.Physio, B.Sc.Physio, M.Physio, or D.Physio degrees.

===Bangladesh===
In [[Bangladesh]], the Bachelor of Physiotherapy ('''BSPT''') course is provided by the Medicine Faculty of University of Dhaka and University of Rajshahi.

After the graduation Physiotherapist(PTs') could go for further specialization in Neurology, Orthopaedics (Musculoskeletal), Sports, Obs-Gynae, Cardio-Thoracic or undertake Research. PTs in India use the title 'Doctor' & prefix it before their name with a suffix P.T. (Physiotherapist) so as to make their stand clear they are not medical doctors. However, the use of the title 'Dr' according to the IAP (Indian Association of Physiotherapist) is by tradition and convention & is used in the same manner as it is used by the MBBS/MS/BDS/MDS/BHMS/BAMS/BUMS degree holders. PTs argue that they are not breaching any law prevailing in India as legally only one who has earned a degree in MD/DM or Phd is justified to use & prefix the 'Doctor' title. 

There are well over 250 colleges offering undergraduate program in physiotherapy (BPT) and more than 50 colleges offering masters in Physiotherapy (MPT) with two years' duration. MUHS (Maharashtra) & some other universities in India run a 3-year MPT post graduate degree.

For all para-medical degrees each Institution can select its own test which it held simultaneously in all Universities, whereas for Medicine the test are administered by the Ministry of Education.

Importance is given to the initial exam and a "close number" is paramount. This maneuver is intended to control the job market, hence providing secure occupation to those who finish.

Yet between 2010 and 2011 the public funds to national health care were cut drastically, resulting in a national wide job loss and impossibility for newly formed students to be hired, contemporary to a large portion of the population in need of medical care yet unable to pay for the private service, which is regulated with minimum fees by imposition of law, therefore not allowing that portion of unemployed physiotherapists to lower their own fees so to offer their services and provide that portion of the population with the needed assistance.

Physical Therapist education includes clinical internships that normally occur toward the end of the professional degree. During this time, the doctoral intern will rotate between different settings for a given time period of a month or more. For example, a doctoral intern may have a rotation in orthopeadics during one month and then in wound care the next month. This would continue in different settings for a predetermined amount of time, which is usually around a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shrs.pitt.edu/dpt/ |title=SHRS: Physical Therapy |publisher=Shrs.pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref> After graduating from an accredited program and becoming licensed, a Doctor of Physical Therapy may continue his or her education by entering a residency and then fellowship. Residencies and Fellowships are not required at this time, but are becoming more common in physical therapy education. Currently there are 162 residencies and fellowships in the United States.<ref>[http://www.apta.org/ResidencyFellowship/ProgramDirectory/?navID=10737422953 List of Residencies and Fellowships]</ref>

===Residency===
