===South Africa===

In [[South Africa]] the degree {B.PhysT, B.Sc.Physio or B.Physio,Ph.D. in (Physio)} consists of four years of general practice training, involving all aspects of Physiotherapy. Typically, the first year is made up of theoretical introduction. Gradually, time spent in supervised practice increases until the fourth year, in which the student generally spends about 80% in practice. In the fourth year, students are also expected to complete Physiotherapy research projects, which fulfills the requirements of an Honours degree. Professional practice can only be entered into after a state governed, compulsory year of community service is completed by the student after graduation.

All physiotherapist are First line practitioners (i.e. a health professional who can autonomously diagnose and treat), can refer patients to medical practitioner specialists and Imaging (e.g. for X-Ray, MRI, ultrasound and prescribe Certain medication and blood test relevant to their scope of practice) and issue a certificate of illness.

All practising physiotherapists in South Africa are required by law to register with the Health Professions Council of South Africa,<ref>[http://www.physiosa.org.za/?q=node/325 South African Society of Physiotherapy]</ref> the registering body for physiotherapists being the Professional Board for Physiotherapy, Podiatry and Biokinetics.<ref>[http://www.hpcsa.co.za/hpcsa/default.aspx?id=70 Health Professions Council of South Africa]</ref>

==Asia and Oceania==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], a few different programs are available at both undergraduate and post graduate level. The physiotherapy degree can be undertaken over a four-year period as an undergraduate or two to three years post graduate with the early components being predominantly theoretical including basic [[anatomy]], [[biology]], [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[kinesiology]], [[goniometry]] and [[physiology]]. In the latter half of the degree students partake in practical components focusing on musculoskeletal physiotherapy, neuromuscular physiotherapy, paediatric physiotherapy, geriatric physiotherapy, cardiothoracic physiotherapy, and women's health. The program generally progresses with an increasingly clinical focus and usually the final year involves practical placements at clinics, and research. Australian programs offer either the B.Physio, B.App.Sc.Physio, B.Sc.Physio, M.Physio, or D.Physio degrees.

===Bangladesh===
In [[Bangladesh]], the Bachelor of Physiotherapy ('''BSPT''') course is provided by the Medicine Faculty of University of Dhaka and University of Rajshahi.

PTs in India use the title 'Doctor' & prefix it before their name with a suffix P.T. (Physiotherapist) so as to make their stand clear they are not medical doctors. However, the use of the title 'Dr' according to the IAP (Indian Association of Physiotherapist) is by tradition and convention & is used in the same manner as it is used by the MBBS/MS/BDS/MDS/BHMS/BAMS/BUMS degree holders. PTs argue that they are not breaching any law prevailing in India as legally only one who has earned a degree in MD/DM or Phd is justified to use & prefix the 'Doctor' title. 

There are well over 250 colleges offering undergraduate program in physiotherapy (BPT) and more than 50 colleges offering masters in Physiotherapy (MPT) with two years' duration. MUHS (Maharashtra) & some other universities in India run a 3-year MPT post graduate degree.
