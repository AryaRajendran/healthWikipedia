===Investigational===
Paroxetine is a commonly used antidepressant, from the class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs.

Several studies have suggested that paroxetine can be used in the treatment of [[premature ejaculation]]. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was found to increase with 6–13-fold, which was somewhat longer than the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram).<ref name="pmid9690692">{{cite journal |author=Waldinger MD, Hengeveld MW, Zwinderman AH, Olivier B |title=Effect of SSRI antidepressants on ejaculation: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=274–81 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9690692 |doi=10.1097/00004714-199808000-00004}}</ref><ref name="pmid11763001">{{cite journal |author=Waldinger MD, Zwinderman AH, Olivier B |title=SSRIs and ejaculation: a double-blind, randomized, fixed-dose study with paroxetine and citalopram |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=556–60 |year=2001 |pmid=11763001 |doi=10.1097/00004714-200112000-00003}}</ref><ref name="pmid15363569">{{cite journal |author=Waldinger MD, Zwinderman AH, Olivier B |title=On-demand treatment of premature ejaculation with clomipramine and paroxetine: a randomized, double-blind fixed-dose study with stopwatch assessment |journal=Eur.

SSRIs are also effective in the treatment of severe [[premenstrual syndrome]];<ref name="pmid19370564">{{cite journal |author=Brown J, O' Brien PM, Marjoribanks J, Wyatt K |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for premenstrual syndrome |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=2 |pages=CD001396 |year=2009 |pmid=19370564 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001396.pub2 |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=Julie}}</ref> however, paroxetine is contraindicated in women who may become pregnant due to its teratogenicity and its high risk of withdrawal syndrome in both adults and neonates.

Emerging evidence shows that antipsychotics can be used as a supplement or alternative to paroxetine in patients with generalised anxiety disorder.<ref name="pmid19173371" />

===Efficacy===
<!--one paragraph per indication, so one per MDD, one per SAD, etc.-->
According to the prescribing information provided by the manufacturer of the Paxil brand of paroxetine (GlaxoSmithKline) and approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]],<ref name="gsk-paxil"/> the effectiveness of paroxetine in major depressive disorder has been proven by six placebo-controlled clinical trials. In adults, the efficacy of paroxetine for depression is comparable to that of older [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.<ref name="pmid10760555"/><ref name="<ref name="MONT2001"/> A randomized-trial study showed that paroxetine is more effective for treatment of major depression than placebo also specifically in elderly patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n0912 |author=Rapaport MH, Schneider LS, Dunner DL, Davies JT, Pitts CD |title=Efficacy of controlled-release paroxetine in the treatment of late-life depression |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=64 |issue=9 |pages=1065–74 |year=2003|month=September |pmid=14628982|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2003/v64n09/v64n0912.pdf}}</ref>

For panic disorder, three 10–12-week studies indicated paroxetine superiority to placebo.<ref name="gsk-paxil"/>

For social anxiety disorder, three 12-week trials for adult outpatients demonstrated better response to paroxetine than to placebo.<ref name="gsk-paxil"/>

==Adverse effects==
[[Sexual dysfunction]] is a common side effect with [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]]. Specifically, side effects often include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and [[anorgasmia]] (trouble achieving orgasm). Genital anesthesia,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bolton JM, Sareen J, Reiss JP |title=Genital anaesthesia persisting six years after sertraline discontinuation |journal=J Sex Marital Ther |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=327–30 |year=2006 |pmid=16709553 |doi=10.1080/00926230600666410}}</ref> loss of or decreased response to sexual stimuli, and ejaculatory anhedonia are also possible. Although usually reversible, these sexual side effects can last for months or years after the drug has been completely withdrawn.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Csoka AB, Bahrick AS, Mehtonen O-P |title=Persistent Sexual Dysfunction after Discontinuation of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) |journal=J Sex Med. |volume=5 |issue= 1|pages=227–33 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00630.x|pmid=18173768}}</ref> This is known as [[post SSRI sexual dysfunction]].

Among the common adverse effects associated with paroxetine treatment of depression and listed in the prescribing information, those with the greatest difference from placebo are [[nausea]] (26% on paroxetine vs 9% on placebo), [[somnolence]] (23% vs. 9% on placebo), ejaculatory disturbance (13% vs. 0% on placebo), other male genital disorders (10% vs. 0% on placebo), [[asthenia]] (15% vs. 6% on placebo), sweating (11% vs. 2% on placebo), dizziness (13% vs. 6% on placebo), [[insomnia]] (13% vs. 6% on placebo), dry mouth (18% vs. 12% on placebo), [[constipation]] (14% vs. 9% on placebo), and [[tremor]] (8% vs. 2% on placebo).<ref name="gsk-paxil"/> Other side effects include [[high blood pressure]], [[headache]], [[Anxiety|agitation]], [[weight gain]], impaired memory and [[paresthesia]], decreased fertility.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Masand PS, Gupta S |title=Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors: an update |journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=69–84 |year=1999 |pmid=10471245 |doi= 10.1093/hrp/7.2.69}}</ref>

General side effects are mostly present during the first 1–4 weeks while the body acquires a tolerance to the drug, although once this happens, withdrawal can cause a [[rebound effect]] with symptoms re-emerging in an exaggerated form for very long periods of time. Almost all SSRIs are known to cause either one or more of these symptoms. A person receiving paroxetine treatment may experience a few, all, or none of the listed side-effects, and most side-effects will disappear or lessen with continued treatment, though some may last throughout the duration. Side effects are also often dose-dependent, with fewer and/or less severe symptoms being reported at lower dosages, and/or more severe symptoms being reported at higher dosages. Increases or changes in dosage may also cause symptoms to reappear or worsen.<ref name="gsk-paxil">{{cite web|url=http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_paxil.pdf|format=PDF|title=PAXIL (paroxetine hydrochloride) Tablets and Oral Suspension: PRESCRIBING INFORMATION|year=2007|month=August|accessdate=2007-08-14|publisher=[[GlaxoSmithKline]]|location=Research Triangle Park, NC}}</ref>

On 9 December 2004, the [[European Medicines Agency]]'s (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) informed patients, prescribers, and parents that paroxetine should not be prescribed to children. CHMP also gave a warning to prescribers recommending close monitoring of adult patients at high risk of suicidal behaviour and/or suicidal thoughts. CHMP does not prohibit use of paroxetine with high risk adults but urges extreme caution. Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, CHMP recommends to reduce gradually over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pr/19257004en.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=European Medicines Agency|title=Press release, CHMP meeting on Paroxetine and other SSRIs|date=2004-12-09|accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> See also [[Paroxetine#Discontinuation syndrome|Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal)]].

Schmitt et al. (2001) suggested that paroxetine negatively affects long-term memory, but not short-term, although the result has not been independently verified. In their study, healthy participants given paroxetine for 14 days (20&nbsp;mg for days 1–7 and 40&nbsp;mg days 8–14) showed poorer recall of words on day 14 compared to those receiving a placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schmitt JA, Kruizinga MJ, Riedel WJ |title=Non-serotonergic pharmacological profiles and associated cognitive effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors |journal=J.

===Contraindications===
Paroxetine is [[contraindicated]] in all patients under 18, in all patients taking any of the drugs listed in the [[paroxetine#Paroxetine interactions with other drugs|interactions section below]], and in adult women who are or may become [[paroxetine#Paroxetine and pregnancy|pregnant]]. Paroxetine may also be contraindicated in many adult men due to sexual and reproductive [[paroxetine#Side effects|side effects described below]].
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] requires this drug to carry a [[black box warning]], its "most serious type of warning in prescription drug labeling",<ref>[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/antidepressant-medications-for-children-and-adolescents-information-for-parents-and-caregivers.shtml Antidepressant Medications for Children and Adolescents: Information for Parents and Caregivers], [[National Institute of Mental Health]]</ref> due to increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior. The warning also applies to other SSRIs, but the concern began with reports of suicidal behavior in paroxetine trials, as well as recommendations from the United Kingdom [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] urging that paroxetine not be used in individuals younger than 18 years.<ref>Kyle, Jeffrey A. and Cortes, Jennifer (May 1, 2008) [http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/issue/2008/2008-05/2008-05-8519/ Black Box Warnings Incite Red Flags], ''Pharmacy Times''.</ref>

===Suicide===

Paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior in children and adolescents. Because suicide is rare, it is difficult to test its relationship with the use of paroxetine. Some studies instead analyze suicidality, which generally refers to suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004, finding an increase in "suicidality" and ideation as compared to placebo; the trend for increased "suicidality" was observed in both trials for depression and for anxiety disorders.<ref name =FDA1>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/04/briefing/2004-4065b1-10-TAB08-Hammads-Review.pdf | title =Review and evaluation of clinical data: relationship between psychotropic drugs and pediatric suicidality | accessdate = 2009-01-27 | author = Hammad TA | date = 2004-08-16| format =PDF | work = Joint Meeting of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee and Pediatric Advisory Committee.

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{See also|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}
Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Evidence has shown that paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1382551.stm |work=BBC News |title=Anti-depressant addiction warning |date=2001-06-11 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref> Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as crying and anxiety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060503233730/http://www.ascp.com/publications/tcp/1997/oct/ssri.html|publisher=American Society of Consultant Pharmacists|title=Clinical Reviews: SSRI Withdrawal Syndrome|first=Penny A.|last=Skaehill|coauthors=Welch, E.B.|year=1997|month=October|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhanji NH, Chouinard G, Kolivakis T, Margolese HC |title=Persistent tardive rebound panic disorder, rebound anxiety and insomnia following paroxetine withdrawal: a review of rebound-withdrawal phenomena |journal=Can J Clin Pharmacol |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=e69–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16456219 |format=PDF |url=http://www.jptcp.com/cjcp_04-032_e69-r101631}}</ref> Liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome.

===Paroxetine and pregnancy===
The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] recommends that for pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, "treatment with all SSRIs or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or both during pregnancy be individualized and paroxetine use among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant be avoided, if possible."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> According to the prescribing information<ref name="gsk-paxil"/> "epidemiological studies have shown that infants born to women who had first trimester paroxetine exposure had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects (VSDs and ASDs). In general, septal defects range from those that are symptomatic and may require surgery to those that are asymptomatic and may resolve spontaneously. If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant. For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options." These conclusions are supported by multiple [[systematic review]]s and meta-analyses that found that, on average, the use of paroxetine during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5–1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects.<ref name="pmid16926304">{{cite journal |author=Thormahlen GM |title=Paroxetine use during pregnancy: is it safe? |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1834–7 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=16926304 |doi=10.1345/aph.1H116 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17381382">{{cite journal |author=Way CM |title=Safety of newer antidepressants in pregnancy |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=546–52 |year=2007 |pmid=17381382 |doi=10.1592/phco.27.4.546 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17397101">{{cite journal |author=Bellantuono C, Migliarese G, Gentile S |title=Serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy and the risk of major malformations: a systematic review |journal=Hum Psychopharmacol |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=121–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17397101 |doi=10.1002/hup.836 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17688379">{{cite journal |author=Källén B |title=The safety of antidepressant drugs during pregnancy |journal=Expert Opin Drug Saf |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=357–70 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17688379 |doi=10.1517/14740338.6.4.357 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17697910">{{cite journal |author=Bar-Oz B, Einarson T, Einarson A, ''et al'' |title=Paroxetine and congenital malformations: meta-Analysis and consideration of potential confounding factors |journal=Clin Ther |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=918–26 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17697910 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.05.003 }}</ref> A recent non-systematic review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, with the lead author, Salvatore Gentile, reporting to have received material or financial support from GSK, came to a different conclusion: "the teratogenic potential of paroxetine that has been reported in some studies remains unproven."

A large 2010 study — using the Swedish Medical Birth Register (MBR) from 1 July 1995 up to 2007 identified women who reported the use of antidepressants in early pregnancy or were prescribed antidepressants during pregnancy by antenatal care — found a specific association between Paxil use and infant cardiovascular defects.<ref name=Reis>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0033291709992194 | author = Reis M, Kallen B | title = Delivery outcome after maternal use of antidepressant drugs in pregnancy: an update using Swedish data | journal = Psychological Medicine | year = 2010 | volume = 40 | issue = 10 | pages = 1723–33 | pmid = 20047705}}</ref> A strong association between Paxil and [[hypospadias]] was also concluded in this study, though the researchers concluded that it is not clear if these effects were due to drug use or underlying pathology.<ref name=Reis/>

===Interactions===
GlaxoSmithKline cautions that drug interactions may create or increase specific risks, including [[Serotonin Syndrome]] or [[Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome]] (NMS)-like Reactions:
:The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including treatment with PAXIL, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including [[triptans]]) with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including [[MAOI]]s), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists.
The prescribing information states that paroxetine should "not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI", and should not be used in combination with [[pimozide]], [[thioridazine]], [[tryptophan]], or [[warfarin]].<ref name="gsk-paxil"/>

Paroxetine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6. The breast cancer treatment drug tamoxifen is also metabolized to its active state by the same cytochrome. Patients treated with both paroxetine and tamoxifen have an increased risk of death from breast cancer from 24% to 91%, depending on duration of coexposure.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kelly CM, Juurlink DN, Gomes T, ''et al.'' |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and breast cancer mortality in women receiving tamoxifen: a population based cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=340 |pages=c693 |year=2010 |pmid=20142325 |pmc=2817754 |doi=10.1136/bmj.c693}}</ref>

===Overdosage===
Acute overdosage is often manifested by [[emesis]], [[lethargy]], [[ataxia]], [[tachycardia]] and [[seizures]]. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of paroxetine may be measured to monitor therapeutic administration, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Plasma paroxetine concentrations are generally in a range of 40–400 μg/L in persons receiving daily therapeutic doses and 200–2000 μg/L in poisoned patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 1–4&nbsp;mg/L in acute lethal overdose situations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goeringer KE, Raymon L, Christian GD, Logan BK |title=Postmortem forensic toxicology of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a review of pharmacology and report of 168 cases |journal=J.

Paroxetine is a [[phenylpiperidine]] derivative, chemically unrelated to the [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclic]] or [[tetracyclic antidepressant|tetracyclic]] antidepressants. In receptor binding studies, paroxetine did not exhibit significant affinity for the [[adrenergic receptor|adrenergic]] (α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>, β), [[dopaminergic]], serotonergic (5HT<sub>1</sub>, 5HT<sub>2</sub>), or [[histamine receptor]]s of rat brain membrane.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A weak affinity for the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic acetylcholine]] and [[noradrenaline]] receptors was evident.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The predominant metabolites of paroxetine are approximately 1/50th the strength of paroxetine and are essentially inactive.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Society and culture==
===Controversy===
For 10 years, [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) marketing of the drug stated that it was "not habit forming", which numerous experts and at least one court found to be incorrect.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-08-20-paxil-ads_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Judge: Paxil ads can't say it isn't habit-forming | date=2002-08-20 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref><ref>[http://www.socialaudit.org.uk/4606-BAUM%20HEDLUND.htm Paxil Ad Injunction].

The fact that it can cause intolerable withdrawal symptoms of the kind that could lead to dependence is enormously important to patients, doctors, investors, and the company. GlaxoSmithKline has evaded the issue since it was granted a license for paroxetine over 10 years ago, and the drug has become a blockbuster for them, generating about a tenth of their entire revenue. The company has been promoting paroxetine directly to consumers as 'non-habit forming' for far too long." Paroxetine prescribing information posted at [[GlaxoSmithKline]] now acknowledges the occurrence of a discontinuation syndrome, including serious discontinuation symptoms.<ref name="gsk-paxil"/>

Since the FDA approved paroxetine in 1992, approximately 5,000 U.S. citizens have sued GSK. Most of these people feel they were not sufficiently warned in advance of the drug's side effects—particularly the withdrawal syndrome, after GSK had specifically advertised the drug as non-habit forming.

In 2001, GSK increased its American TV advertising of Paxil after the [[September 11 attacks]]; in October 2001, GSK spent nearly twice as much as in October 2000.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/newsarticle.aspx?articleid=104386 |title=Drug Makers Find Sept. 11 A Marketing Opportunity |journal=Psychiatric News |date=1 March 2001 |volume= 37 |issue=5| page =9}}</ref> The difficulty of withdrawal from paroxetine, and GSK's concealment of it, was later reported on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSUAsdBgh70 Withdrawing from Antidepressants Can be Dangerous].

Results from Study 329, one of the trials, were reported<ref>{{cite journal |author=Keller MB et al |title=Efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of adolescent major depression: a randomized, controlled trial |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=40 |issue=7 |pages=762–72 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11437014 |doi=10.1097/00004583-200107000-00010}}</ref> in a way that misled readers about paroxetine's safety and efficacy, and contributed to repeated distortions in the assessment of the drug's value in paediatric depression in the scientific literature.<ref>[http://healthyskepticism.org/documents/PaxilStudy329.php Paxil Study 329: Paroxetine vs Imipramine vs Placebo in Adolescents], Healthy Skepticism International News, January 2010</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=March 2011}}

The court documents released as a result of one of the lawsuits in October 2008 indicated that GSK "and/or researchers may have suppressed or obscured suicide risk data during clinical trials" of paroxetine. One of the investigators, "[[Charles Nemeroff]], former chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at [[Emory University]], was the first big name 'outed' ...In early October 2008, Nemeroff stepped down as department chair amid revelations that he had received over $960,000 from GSK in 2006, yet reported less than $35,000 to the school. Subsequent investigations revealed payments totaling more than $2.5 million from drug companies between 2000 and 2006, yet only a fraction was disclosed."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Samson K |title=Senate probe seeks industry payment data on individual academic researchers |journal=Ann.

The suppression of unfavorable research findings on Paxil by GSK — and the legal discovery process that uncovered it — is the subject of [[Alison Bass]]'s 2008 book ''[[Side Effects (book)|Side Effects: A Prosecutor, a Whistleblower, and a Bestselling Antidepressant on Trial]]''. The book chronicles the lives of two women – a prosecutor and a [[whistleblower]] – who exposed deception in the research and marketing of Paxil. The book shows the connections between pharmaceutical giant [[GlaxoSmithKline]], a top Ivy League research institution, and the government agency designed to protect the public – conflicted relationships that arguably compromised the health and safety of vulnerable children. ''Side Effects'' received the NASW [[Science in Society Journalism Awards|Science in Society Award]] for 2009.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090915184028/http://www.nasw.org/mt-archives/2009/09/scienceinsociety-journalism-aw-1.htm Science in Society Journalism Award winners].

In 2012 the U.S. Justice Department announced that GSK had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for promoting the use of Paxil for children.<ref>{{cite news|title=Glaxo Agrees to Pay $3 Billion in Fraud Settlement|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 2, 2012|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-fraud-settlement.html|first1=Katie|last1=Thomas|first2=Michael S.|last2=Schmidt}}</ref>
