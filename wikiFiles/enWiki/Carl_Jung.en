'''Carl Gustav Jung''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ʊ|ŋ}} {{respell|YUUNG|'}}; {{IPA-de|ˈkarl ˈɡʊstaf ˈjʊŋ|lang}}; 26 July 1875&nbsp;– 6 June 1961) was a Swiss [[psychotherapist]] and [[psychiatrist]] who founded [[analytical psychology]]. Jung proposed and developed the concepts of the [[extraverted]] and the [[introverted]] personality, [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], and the [[collective unconscious]]. His work has been influential in [[psychiatry]] and in the [[study of religion]], literature, and related fields.

The central concept of analytical psychology is [[Individuation#Carl_Jung|individuation]] – the psychological process of integrating the opposites, including the conscious with the unconscious, while still maintaining their relative autonomy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=209}}</ref> Jung considered individuation to be the central process of human development.<ref name="Jung's Individuation process">[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/individuation.html Jung's Individuation process] Retrieved on 2009-2-20</ref> 

Jung created some of the best known psychological concepts, including the [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], the [[Complex (psychology)|complex]], and [[synchronicity]]. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (MBTI), a popular [[Personality psychology|psychometric instrument]], has been developed from Jung's theories.

Jung saw the human psyche as "by nature religious",<ref>[http://arthursbookshelf.com/other-stuff/philos/Memories,%20Dreams,%20Reflections%20-%20Carl%20Jung.pdf Aniela Jaffe, foreword to ''Memories, dreams and reflections'', p.10]</ref> and made this religiousness the focus of his explorations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dunne|first=Clare |title=Carl Jung: Wounded Healer of the Soul: An Illustrated Biography|year=2002|pages=3|chapter=Prelude|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uegLZklR0fEC&pg=PA3 | isbn=978-0-8264-6307-4 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group}}</ref> Jung is one of the best known contemporary contributors to [[dream analysis]] and symbolization. 

Though he was a practicing clinician and considered himself to be a scientist,<ref name="Lachmanpage258" /> much of his life's work was spent exploring tangential areas, including [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], and [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His interest in philosophy and [[the occult]] led many to view him as a mystic.<ref name="Lachmanpage258">{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|title=Jung the Mystic|year=2010|publisher=Tarcher/Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58542-792-5|page=258}}</ref>

==Early life and career==

===Youth===

====Birth====
Carl Jung was born Karl Gustav II Jung{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As a university student Jung changed the modernized spelling of his name to the original family form. {{Cite book|last=Bair |first=Deirdre |authorlink=Deirdre Bair |title=Jung: A Biography |year=2003 |publisher=Back Bay Books |location=New York |isbn=0-316-15938-7 |pages=7, 53}}}} in [[Kesswil]], in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Swiss canton]] of [[Thurgau]], on 26 July 1875, as the fourth but only surviving child of Paul Achilles Jung and Emilie Preiswerk. Emilie Preiswerk was the youngest child of Samuel Preiswerk, Paul Achilles Jung's professor of Hebrew. His father was a poor rural pastor in the [[Swiss Reformed Church]], while his mother came from a wealthy and established Swiss family.

When Jung was six months old his father was appointed to a more prosperous parish in [[Laufen-Uhwiesen|Laufen]]. Meanwhile, the tension between his parents was growing. An eccentric and depressed woman, Emilie Jung spent much of the time in her own separate bedroom, enthralled by the spirits that she said visited her at night.<ref name="Memories, Dreams, Reflections">{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |page=18}}</ref> Jung had a better relationship with his father because he thought him to be predictable and thought his mother to be very problematic. Although during the day he also saw her as predictable, at night he felt some frightening influences from her room. At night his mother became strange and mysterious. Jung claimed that one night he saw a faintly luminous and  indefinite figure coming from her room, with a head detached from the neck and floating in the air in front of the body.<ref name="Memories, Dreams, Reflections"/>

His mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near [[Basel]] for an unknown physical ailment. Young Carl Jung was taken by his father to live with Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but was later brought back to the pastor's residence. Emilie's continuing bouts of absence and often depressed mood influenced her son's attitude towards women&nbsp;— one of "innate unreliability," a view that he later called the "handicap I started off with"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jung |first=C. G.|coauthors=[[Aniela Jaffé]] |title=[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]] |year=1965 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |pages=8|isbn=0-394-70268-9}}</ref> and that resulted in his sometimes [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] views of women.<ref name=Corbett /> After three years of living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer and was called to [[:de:Basel-Kleinhüningen|Kleinhüningen]] in 1879. The relocation brought Emilie Jung in closer contact to her family and lifted her melancholy and despondent mood.

====Childhood memories====
A solitary and introverted child, Jung was convinced from childhood that, like his mother,<ref>{{cite web|last=Stepp|first=G|title=Carl Jung: Forever Jung|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-carl-jung/50365.aspx|work=Vision Journal|accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>  he had two personalities&nbsp;— a modern Swiss citizen and a personality more at home in the eighteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=33–34}}</ref> "Personality Number 1," as he termed it, was a typical schoolboy living in the era of the time, while "Personality Number 2" was a dignified, authoritative and influential man from the past. Although Jung was close to both parents he was rather disappointed in his father's academic approach to faith.

A number of childhood memories had made a lifelong impression on him. As a boy he carved a tiny [[mannequin]] into the end of the wooden ruler from his  pencil case and placed it inside the case. He then added a stone which he had painted into upper and lower halves and hid the case in the attic. Periodically he would come back to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language.<ref name="art-therapy">{{Cite book|last=Malchiodi |first=Cathy A. |title=The Art Therapy Sourcebook |pages=134 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Vno0XgRuRhcC&pg=PA134 | isbn=978-0-07-146827-5 |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional}}</ref> This ceremonial act, he later reflected, brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. In later years he discovered that similarities existed in this memory and the [[totem]]s of native peoples like the collection of soul-stones near [[Arlesheim]], or the ''[[tjurunga]]s'' of Australia. This, he concluded, was an unconscious ritual that he did not question or understand at the time, but which was practiced in a strikingly similar way in faraway locations that he as a young boy had no way of consciously knowing about.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=22–23}}</ref> His findings on [[Jungian archetypes|psychological archetypes]] and the collective unconscious were inspired in part by these experiences.

Shortly before the end of his first year at the [[:de:Gymnasium am Münsterplatz|Humanistisches Gymnasium]] in Basel, at the age of twelve, he was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he was for a moment unconscious (Jung later recognized that the incident was his fault, indirectly). A thought then came to him that "now you won't have to go to school any more."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=30}}</ref> From then on, whenever he started off to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking worriedly to a visitor of his future ability to support himself, as they suspected he had [[epilepsy]]. With little money in the family, this brought the boy to reality and he realized the need for academic excellence. He immediately went into his father's study and began poring over [[Latin grammar]]. He fainted three more times, but eventually he overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, "was when I learned what a [[neurosis]] is."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memories, Dreams, Reflections |pages=32}}</ref>

===Young adulthood===

====University years====
Jung had no plans to study psychiatry, because it was held in contempt in those days, but as he started studying his psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he read that [[psychoses]] are personality diseases. Immediately he understood this was the field that interested him the most. It combined both biological and spiritual facts and this was what he was searching for.<ref name="jungbio1">[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/carl-jung.html Carl Jung] Retrieved on 2009-3-7</ref>

In 1895, Jung studied medicine at the [[University of Basel]]. In 1900, he began working in the [[Burghölzli]], a psychiatric hospital in [[Zurich]], with [[Eugen Bleuler]]. His dissertation, published in 1903, was titled "On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena." In 1906, he published ''Studies in Word Association'' and later sent a copy of this book to [[Sigmund Freud]], after which a close friendship between these two men followed for some six years (see section on [[#Relationship with Freud|Relationship with Freud]]). In 1912 Jung published ''Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido'' (known in English as ''[[Psychology of the Unconscious]]'') resulting in a theoretical divergence between him and Freud and consequently a break in their friendship, each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong. After this falling-out, Jung went through a pivotal and difficult psychological transformation, which was exacerbated by news of the [[First World War]]. [[Henri Ellenberger]] called Jung's experience a "creative illness" and compared it to Freud's period of what he called [[neurasthenia]] and [[hysteria]].

====Army career====
During World War I Jung was drafted as an army doctor and soon made commandant of an internment camp for British officers and soldiers. (Swiss neutrality obliged the Swiss to intern personnel from either side of the conflict who crossed their frontier to evade capture.) Jung worked to improve the conditions for these soldiers stranded in neutral territory; he encouraged them to attend university courses.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crowley |first=Vivianne |title=Jung: A Journey of Transformation |year=1999 |publisher=Quest Books |pages=56|isbn=0-8356-0782-8}}</ref>

====Marriage====
In 1903, Jung married [[Emma Jung|Emma Rauschenbach]], who came from a wealthy family in Switzerland. They had five children: Agathe, Gret, Franz, Marianne, and Helene. The marriage lasted until Emma's death in 1955, but he had more-or-less open relationships with other women. The most well-known women with whom Jung is believed to have had extramarital relationships were patients and friends [[Sabina Spielrein]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hayman |first=Ronald |title=A Life of Jung |year=1999 |publisher=W.W. Norton & Co. |location=New York |authorlink=Ronald Hayman |isbn=0-393-01967-5 |pages=84–5, 92, 98–9, 102–7, 121, 123, 111, 134–7, 138–9, 145, 147, 152, 176, 177, 184, 185, 186, 189, 194, 213–4}}</ref> and [[Toni Wolff]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Life of Jung |pages=184–8, 189, 244, 261, 262}}</ref>

===Freud===
{{main|Psychoanalysis}}

====Meeting Freud====
Jung was thirty when he sent his ''Studies in Word Association'' to [[Sigmund Freud]] in [[Vienna]] in 1906. The two men met for the first time the following year, and Jung recalled the discussion between himself and Freud as interminable.  They talked, he remembered, for thirteen hours, virtually without stopping'.<ref>Peter Gay, ''Freud: A life for Our Time'' (London, 1988) p. 202.</ref> Six months later, the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection of his latest published essays to Jung in [[Zurich]], which marked the beginning of an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted six years and ended in May 1913. At this time Jung resigned as the chairman of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]], where he had been elected with Freud's support.

Jung and Freud influenced each other during the intellectually formative years of Jung's life. Freud called Jung "his adopted eldest son, his crown prince and successor". As Freud was already fifty years old at their meeting, he was well beyond the formative years. In 1906 [[psychology]] as a science was still in its early stages. Jung, who had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' by [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], professor in Vienna, now worked as a doctor under the psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in Burghölzli and became familiar with Freud's idea of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] through Freud's ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1900) and was a proponent of the new "psycho-analysis." At the time, Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Burghölzli was a renowned psychiatric clinic in Zurich at which Jung was a young doctor whose research had already given him international recognition.

Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of unconscious that contains memories and ideas inherited from our ancestors. While he did think that libido was an important source for personal growth, he, unlike Freud, believed that libido alone was not responsible for the formation of the core personality.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Heth|title=Psychology the Science od Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|location=Personality|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|page=434}}</ref>

====''Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research''====
In 1908, Jung became an editor of the newly founded ''Yearbook for Psychoanalytical and Psychopathological Research.'' The following year, Jung traveled with Freud and [[Sándor Ferenczi]] to the United States to speak about psychoanalysis and, in 1910, Jung became Chairman for Life of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]]. While Jung worked on his ''Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious)'', tensions grew between Freud and Jung, mostly due to their disagreements over the nature of [[libido]] and religion.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} In 1912 these tensions came to a peak because Jung felt severely slighted after Freud visited his colleague [[Ludwig Binswanger]] in [[Kreuzlingen]] without paying him a visit in nearby Zurich, an incident Jung referred to as "the Kreuzlingen gesture". Shortly thereafter, Jung again traveled to the United States and gave the Fordham lectures, which were published as ''The Theory of Psychoanalysis''. While they contain some remarks on Jung's dissenting view on the nature of libido, they represent largely a "psychoanalytical Jung" and not the theory Jung became famous for in the following decades.

====Travels to the USA====
In 1909 Jung and Freud traveled to the conference at [[Clark University]]. The event was planned by psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]] and included twenty-seven distinguished psychiatrists, neurologists and psychologists. It represented a watershed in the acceptance of psychoanalysis in North America. This forged welcome links between Jung and influential Americans.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rosenzwieg |first=Saul |title=Freud, Jung and Hall the King-Maker |year=1992 |isbn=0-88937-110-5}}</ref> Jung returned to the United States the next year for a brief visit, and again for a six-week lecture series at [[Fordham University]] in 1912.

====Last meetings with Freud====
In November 1912, Jung and Freud met in [[Munich]] for a meeting among prominent colleagues to discuss psychoanalytical journals.<ref name="jones">Jonest, Ernest, ed. [[Lionel Trilling]] and Steven Marcus. ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'', New York: Anchor Books, 1963.</ref> At a talk about a new psychoanalytic essay on [[Amenhotep IV]], Jung expressed his views on how it related to actual conflicts in the psychoanalytic movement. While Jung spoke, Freud suddenly fainted and Jung carried him to a couch.

Jung and Freud personally met for the last time in September 1913 for the Fourth International Psychoanalytical Congress in Munich. Jung gave a talk on psychological types, the [[introvert]]ed and the [[extravert]]ed type in [[analytical psychology]]. This constituted the introduction of some of the key concepts which came to distinguish Jung's work from Freud's in the next half century.

===Midlife isolation===

====London 1913–14====
Jung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914. His travels were soon interrupted by the war, but his ideas continued to receive attention in England primarily through the efforts of Constance Long. She translated and published the first English volume of his collected writings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jung |first=C. G. |title=Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology |year=1916 |publisher=Bailliere, Tindall and Cox |others=Dr. Constance E. Long}}</ref>

====Red Book====
{{Main|Red Book (Jung)}}
In 1913, at the age of thirty-eight, Jung experienced a horrible "confrontation with the unconscious". He saw visions and heard voices. He worried at times that he was "menaced by a psychosis" or was "doing a schizophrenia". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, "[[active imagination]]s". He recorded everything he felt in small journals. Jung began to transcribe his notes into a large red leather-bound book, on which he worked intermittently for sixteen years.<ref name=Corbett>{{cite news|author=Corbett, Sara|title=The Holy Grail of the Unconscious|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/magazine/20jung-t.html|date=September 16, 2009|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref>

Jung left no posthumous instructions about the final disposition of what he called the "[[Red Book (Jung)|Red Book]]". His family eventually moved it into a bank vault in 1984. [[Sonu Shamdasani]], a historian from London, for three years tried to persuade Jung's heirs to have it published, to which they declined every hint of inquiry.  As of mid-September 2009, fewer than two dozen people had seen it. Ulrich Hoerni, Jung's grandson who manages the Jung archives, decided to publish it. To raise the additional funds needed the [[Philemon Foundation]] was founded.<ref name=Corbett />

In 2007, two technicians for DigitalFusion, working with the publisher, [[W. W. Norton & Company]], painstakingly scanned one-tenth of a millimeter at a time with a 10,200-pixel scanner. It was published on October 7, 2009, in German with "separate English translation along with Shamdasani's introduction and footnotes" at the back of the book, according to Sara Corbett for ''[[The New York Times]]''. She wrote, "The book is bombastic, baroque and like so much else about Carl Jung, a willful oddity, synched with an antediluvian and mystical reality."<ref name=Corbett />

The [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York City displayed the original Red Book journal, as well as some of Jung's original small journals, from October 7, 2009, to January 25, 2010.<ref name=Rubin>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rmanyc.org/nav/exhibitions/view/308|title=The Red Book of C. G. Jung|publisher=Rubin Museum of Art|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> According to them, "During the period in which he worked on this book Jung developed his principal theories of archetypes, collective unconscious, and the process of individuation." Two-thirds of the pages bear Jung's [[illuminated manuscript|illuminations]] of the text.<ref name=Rubin />

====Isolation====
In the following years Jung experienced considerable isolation in his professional life, exacerbated through [[World War I]]. His ''[[Seven Sermons to the Dead]]'' (1917), reprinted in his autobiography ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'' (see bibliography), can also be read as expression of the psychological conflicts which beset Jung around the age of forty after the break with Freud.

====London 1920–23====
Constance Long arranged for him to arrange a seminar in [[Cornwall]] in 1920. Another seminar was held in 1923, this one organized by [[Helton Godwin Baynes]] (known as Peter), and another in 1925.<ref name="McGuire"/>

====USA 1924–25====
Jung made a more extensive trip westward in the winter of 1924–5, financed and organized by Fowler McCormick and George Porter. Of particular value to Jung was a visit with [[Ochwiay Biano|Chief Mountain Lake]] of the [[Taos Pueblo]] near [[Taos, New Mexico]].<ref name="McGuire">{{cite journal |last=McGuire |first=William |title= Firm Affinities: Jung's relations with Britain and the United States |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |year=1995 |volume=40 |pages=301–326 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-5922.1995.00301.x |issue=3}}</ref>

====East Africa====
In October 1925, Jung embarked on his most ambitious expedition, the "Bugishu Psychological Expedition" to East Africa. He was accompanied by Peter Baynes and an American associate, [[George Beckwith (Carl Jung associate)|George Beckwith]]. On the voyage to Africa, they became acquainted with an English woman named Ruth Bailey, who joined their safari a few weeks later. The group traveled through Kenya and Uganda to the slopes of [[Mount Elgon]], where Jung hoped to increase his understanding of "primitive psychology" through conversations with the culturally isolated residents of that area. Later he concluded that the major insights he had gleaned had to do with himself and the European psychology in which he had been raised.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Burleson |first=Blake W. |title=Jung in Africa |year=2005 |isbn=0-8264-6921-3}}</ref>

====USA 1936====
Jung made another trip to America in 1936, giving lectures in New York and New England for his growing group of American followers. He returned in 1937 to deliver the [[Terry Lectures]], ''Psychology and Religion'', at [[Yale University]].

====India====
In December 1937, Jung left Zurich again for an extensive tour of India with Fowler McCormick. In India, he felt himself "under the direct influence of a foreign culture" for the first time. In Africa, his conversations had been strictly limited by the language barrier, but in India he was able to converse extensively.  Hindu philosophy became an important element in his understanding of the role of symbolism and the life of the unconscious, though he avoided a meeting with [[Ramana Maharshi]]. Jung became seriously ill on this trip and endured two weeks of [[delirium]] in a Calcutta hospital. After 1938, his travels were confined to Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bair |first=Deirdre |title= Jung: A Biography |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-07665-1 |pages=417–430}}</ref>

====Last publications====
Jung continued to publish books until the end of his life, including ''Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies'' (1959), which analyzed the archetypal meaning and possible psychological significance of the reported observations of [[UFO]]s.<ref>''The Collected Works of C. G. Jung'', Volumes 10 and 18.</ref> He also enjoyed a friendship with an English [[Roman Catholic]] priest, Father [[Victor White (priest)|Victor White]], who corresponded with Jung after he had published his controversial ''[[Answer to Job]]''.<ref>In ''Psychology and Religion'', v.11, ''Collected Works of C. G. Jung'', Princeton. It was first published as "Antwort auf Hiob," Zurich, 1952 and translated into English in 1954, in London.</ref>

===Death===
Jung died on 6 June 1961 at [[Küsnacht]], after a short illness.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Hayman |first = Ronald |title = A Life of Jung |publisher = W.W.

==Psychology==
{{main|Analytical psychology}}

Jung founded a new school of [[psychotherapy]], called analytical psychology or [[Jungian psychology]].

===Theories===
His theories include:
* The concept of [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introversion]] and [[Extraversion and introversion#Extraversion|extraversion]] (although he did not define these terms as they are popularly defined today).<ref>{{cite web|last=Stepp|first=G|title=People: Who Needs Them|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/social-relationships-introvert-vs-extrovert/50363.aspx|work=Vision Journal|accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref>
* The concept of the [[complex (psychology)|complex]].
* The concept of [[collective unconscious]], which is shared by all people. It includes the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].
* [[Synchronicity]] as a mode of relationship that is not [[causality|causal]], an idea that has influenced [[Wolfgang Pauli]] (with whom he developed the notion of ''[[unus mundus]]'' in connection with the notion of non-locality) and some other [[Quantum physics|physicists]].<ref>Jung, C. G. and [[Wolfgang Pauli]], ''The Interpretation of Nature and Psyche'', New York: Pantheon Books, 1955.</ref>

===Divergence from Freud===
Jung's primary disagreement with Freud stemmed from their differing concepts of the unconscious.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Jung saw Freud's theory of the unconscious as incomplete and unnecessarily negative. According to Jung, Freud conceived the unconscious solely as a repository of repressed emotions and desires. Jung agreed with Freud's model of the unconscious, what Jung called the "[[personal unconscious]]", but he also proposed the existence of a second, far deeper form of the unconscious underlying the personal one. This was the [[collective unconscious]], where the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] themselves resided, represented in mythology by a lake or other body of water, and in some cases a jug or other container. Freud had actually mentioned a collective level of psychic functioning but saw it primarily as an appendix to the rest of the psyche.

===Individuation===
Jung considered [[individuation]], a psychological process of integrating the opposites including the conscious with the unconscious while still maintaining their relative autonomy, necessary for a person to become whole.<ref name="Jung's Individuation process"/>

Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] is brought into consciousness (by means of dreams, [[active imagination]] or [[free association (psychology)|free association]] to take some examples) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche to take place.<ref name="jung1">Jung, C. G. (1962). Symbols of Transformation: An analysis of the prelude to a case of schizophrenia (Vol. 2, R. F. C. Hull, Trans.). New York: Harper & Brothers.</ref> Individuation has a holistic healing effect on the person, both mentally and physically.<ref name="jung1" />

Besides achieving physical and mental health,<ref name="jung1" /> people who have advanced towards individuation tend to be harmonious, mature and responsible. They embody humane values such as [[free will|freedom]] and [[justice]] and have a good understanding about the workings of [[human nature]] and the [[universe]].<ref name="Jung's Individuation process"/>

===Persona===
In his psychological theory – which is not necessarily linked to a particular theory of [[social structure]] – the ''persona'' appears as a consciously created personality or identity fashioned out of part of the collective psyche through [[socialization]], [[acculturation]] and experience.<ref>Jolande Székács Jacobi, ''Masks of the Soul''. William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1977; Robert H. Hopcke, ''Persona''. Berkeley: Shambhala Publications, 1995.</ref>  Jung applied the classical term ''persona'', explicitly because, originally, it meant the ''mask'' which the actor bears, expressing the role he plays (see also [[persona (psychology)]]).

The ''persona'', he argues, is a mask for the "collective psyche", a mask that 'pretends' individuality, so that both self and others believe in that identity, even if it is really no more than a well-played ''role'' through which the collective psyche is expressed.  Jung regarded the "persona-mask" as a complicated system which ''mediates'' between individual consciousness and the social community: it is "a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be".<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]]", The relations between the Ego and the Unconscious", in: [[Joseph Campbell]] (ed.), ''The Portable Jung''. New York: Viking Press, 1971, p. 106.</ref> But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a ''character mask'' in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression to others, and to hide (part of) the true nature of the individual.<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]], ''Two essays on analytical psychology''. Princeton, N.J : Princeton University Press, 2nd ed. 1977, p. 157.</ref> The therapist then aims to assist the [[individuation]] process through which the client (re-)gains his "own self" – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the ''persona'', and from the power of unconscious impulses. 

Jung's theory has become enormously influential in management theory; not just because managers and executives have to create an appropriate "management persona" (a corporate mask) and a persuasive identity,<ref>Joann S. Lublin, "How to look and act like a leader", ''Wall Street Journal'', 12 September 2011.</ref> but also because they have to evaluate ''what sort of people'' the workers are, in order to manage them (for example, using [[personality test]]s and [[peer review]]s).<ref>[[Kees van der Pijl]], "May 1968 and the alternative globalisation movement – cadre class formation and the transition to socialism".

Vienna: Akademische Verlagsanstalt, 2009, pp. 192, 193, 194.</ref>

===Spirituality===
Jung's work on himself and his patients convinced him that life has a spiritual purpose beyond material goals. Our main task, he believed, is to discover and fulfill our deep innate potential. Based on his study of [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Taoism]], and other traditions, Jung believed that this journey of transformation, which he called [[individuation]], is at the mystical heart of all religions. It is a journey to meet the [[self]] and at the same time to meet the [[Divine]]. Unlike Sigmund Freud, Jung thought spiritual experience was essential to our well-being.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crowley |first=Vivianne |title=Jung: A Journey of Transformation:Exploring His Life and Experiencing His Ideas |year=2000 |publisher=Quest Books |location=Wheaton Illinois |isbn=978-0-8356-0782-7 }}</ref>

===Alchemy===
The work and writings of Jung from the 1940s onwards focused on [[alchemy]]. 

In 1944 Jung published ''[[Psychology and Alchemy]],'' where he analyzed the alchemical symbols and showed a direct relationship to the psychoanalytical process.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|'For Jung, alchemy is not only part of  the pre-history of  chemistry, that  is,  not  only  laboratory work,  but  also  an  essential  part  of   the  history  of  psychology as the history of  the discovery of  the deep structure of  the psyche and its unconscious. Jung emphasized the signiﬁ cance of  the symbolic structure of   alchemical  texts,  a  structure  that  is  understood  as  a  way  independent  of  laboratory research, as a structure per se.' {{Cite book|last = Calian |first = George Florin |title = Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa.

In 1963 ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' was first published in ''[[The Collected Works of C. G. Jung]]''. ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' was Jung's last book and focused on the "Mysterium Coniunctionis" archetype, known as the [[sacred marriage]] between sun and moon. Jung argued that the stages of the alchemists, the blackening, the whitening, the reddening and the yellowing, could be taken as symbolic of individuation&nbsp;— his favourite term for personal growth  (75).

==Political views==

===Views on the state===
Jung stressed the importance of [[Natural and legal rights|individual rights]] in a person's relation to the state and society. He saw that the state was treated as "a quasi-animate personality from whom everything is expected" but that this personality was "only camouflage for those individuals who know how to manipulate it",<ref>{{Cite book| isbn = 0-451-21860-4 | title = The Undiscovered Self: The Problem of the Individual in Modern Society | pages = 15–16 | publisher = New American Library | last = Jung | first = Carl | year = 2006 }}</ref> and referred to the state as a form of slavery.<ref>C.

===Leadership in professional organizations in Germany, 1933 to 1939===
Jung had many friends and respected colleagues who were Jewish and he maintained relations with them through the 1930s when [[anti-semitism]] in Germany and other European nations was on the rise. However, until 1939, he also maintained professional relations with psychotherapists in Germany who had declared their support for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime and there were allegations that he himself was a Nazi sympathizer. In his work ''Civilisation in Transition, Collected Works Volume X'', however, Jung wrote of "...&nbsp;the [[Aryan]] bird of prey with his insatiable lust to lord it in every land, even those that concern him not at all."<ref>Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; ISBN 0-7100-1640-9; p 89</ref>

In 1933, after the Nazis gained power in Germany, Jung took part in restructuring of the [[International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy|General Medical Society for Psychotherapy]] (''Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie''), a German-based professional body with an international membership. The society was reorganized into two distinct bodies:
# A strictly German body, the Deutsche Allgemeine Ärztliche Gesellschaft für Psychotherapie, led by [[Matthias Göring]], an [[Alfred Adler|Adlerian]] psychotherapist<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3DC123BF934A15752C0A963948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 Lifton, Robert Jay (27 January 1985) "Psychotherapy in the Third Reich" New York Times]</ref> and a cousin of the prominent Nazi [[Hermann Göring]];
# International General Medical Society for Psychotherapy, led by Jung. The German body was to be affiliated to the international society, as were new national societies being set up in Switzerland and elsewhere.<ref>Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C. G.Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. ISBN 0-340-12515-2; pages 79&nbsp;– 80.</ref>

[[File:C. G. Jung institute.jpg|left|thumb|C. G. Jung Institute, [[Küsnacht]], Switzerland]]
The International Society's constitution permitted individual doctors to join it directly, rather than through one of the national affiliated societies, a provision to which Jung drew attention in a  circular in 1934.<ref>An English translation of the circular is in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; ISBN 0-7100-1640-9; pp. 545–546.</ref> This implied that German Jewish doctors could maintain their professional status as individual members of the international body, even though they were excluded from the German affiliate, as well as from other German medical societies operating under the Nazis.<ref>Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C. G.Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. ISBN 0-340-12515-2; p. 82.</ref>

As leader of the international body, Jung assumed overall responsibility for its publication, the ''Zentralblatt für Psychotherapie''. In 1933, this journal published a  statement endorsing Nazi positions<ref>Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C. G.Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. ISBN 0-340-12515-2; p. 80.</ref> and Hitler's book ''Mein Kampf''.<ref>Mark Medweth. [http://web.archive.org/web/20050331084847/http://www.sfu.ca/~wwwpsyb/issues/1996/winter/medweth.htm "Jung and the Nazis"], in ''Psybernetika'', Winter 1996.</ref> In 1934, Jung wrote in a Swiss publication, the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', that he experienced "great surprise and disappointment"<ref>Article republished in English in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; ISBN 0-7100-1640-9; p. 538.</ref> when the ''Zentralblatt'' associated his name with the pro-Nazi statement.

Jung went on to say "the main point is to get a young and insecure science into a place of safety during an earthquake".<ref>Article republished in English in Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; ISBN 0-7100-1640-9; p. 538. See also Stevens, Anthony, ''Jung: a very short introduction'', Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-19-285458-5</ref> He did not end his relationship with the ''Zentralblatt'' at this time, but he did arrange the appointment of a new managing editor, [[Carl Alfred Meier]] of Switzerland. For the next few years, the ''Zentralblatt'' under Jung and Meier maintained a position distinct from that of the Nazis, in that it continued to acknowledge contributions of Jewish doctors to psychotherapy.<ref name=Jaffe_p83>Jaffé, Aniela (1972); ''From the Life and Work of C. G. Jung''; Hodder and Stoughton, London. ISBN 0-340-12515-2; p. 83.</ref>

In the face of energetic German attempts to Nazify the international body, Jung resigned from its presidency in 1939,<ref name=Jaffe_p83/> the year the [[Second World War]] started.

===Response to Nazism===
Jung's interest in [[European mythology]] and [[folk psychology]] has led to accusations of Nazi sympathies, since they shared the same interest.{{sfn|Noll|1996|p=103, 133-137, p.336 note 55}}{{sfn|Grossman|1979}}<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2011/jun/06/carl-jung-freud-nazis Mark Vernon (The Guardian, Monday 6 June 2011), ''Carl Jung, part 2: A troubled relationship with Freud – and the Nazis'']</ref> He became, however, aware of the negative impact of these similarities:
{{quote|Jung clearly identifies himself with the spirit of German Volkstumsbewegung throughout this period and well into the 1920s and 1930s, until the horrors of Nazism finally compelled him to reframe these neopagan metaphors in a negative light in his 1936 essay on Wotan.{{sfn|Noll|1996|p=134}}}}

There are writings showing that Jung's sympathies were against, rather than for, Nazism.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|C. G. Jung, ''Die Beziehungen zwishen dem Ich und dem Unbewußten'', chapter one, second section, 1928.  Also, C. G. Jung, ''Aufsatze zur Zeitgeschichte'', 1946. Speeches made in 1933, 1937 are excerpted. He was protesting the "slavery by the government" and the "chaos and insanity" of the mob, because of the very fact that they were the part of the mob and were under its strong influence. He wrote that because of the speeches he delivered he was blacklisted by the Nazis. They eliminated his writings.}} In his 1936 essay "Wotan", Jung described Germany as "infected" by "one man who is obviously 'possessed'&nbsp;...", and as "rolling towards perdition",<ref>Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; ISBN 0-7100-1640-9; p. 185.</ref> and wrote 
{{quote|...&nbsp;what a so-called [[Führer]] does with a mass movement can plainly be seen if we turn our eyes to the north or south of our country."<ref>Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; ISBN 0-7100-1640-9; p. 190.</ref>}}

The essay does, however, speak in more positive terms of [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]] and his [[German Faith Movement]]<ref>Jung, Carl G. (1970); ''Collected Works'', Volume 10; Routledge and Kegan Paul, London; ISBN 0-7100-1640-9; pp.&nbsp;190–191.</ref> which was loyal to [[Hitler]]. In April 1939, [[Richard Parsons (bishop)|Richard Parsons]], the [[Bishop of Southwark (Anglican)|Bishop of Southwark]], asked Jung if he had any specific views on what was likely to be the next step in religious development. Jung's reply was:
{{quote|We do not know whether Hitler is going to found a new [[Islam]]. He is already on the way; he is like [[Mohammed]]. The emotion in Germany is Islamic; warlike and Islamic. They are all drunk with wild god. That can be the historic future.<ref>''Collected Works'', Volume 18, ''The Symbolic Life'', Princeton University Press, p. 281</ref>}}

Jungian psychologist and author J. Marvin Spiegelman provided the following explanation of the above quote:
{{quote|Jung had mentioned, in passing, that he felt the spirit of [[Islam]] in the military passion of the Nazis, without casting any aspersion on the religion of [[Islam]] itself. Rather, he sensed that passion, armed with divine mission, something missing from the West for some time, was a primitive invasion of soulless Europe.<ref>C. G. Jung's Answer To Job:A Half Century Later" published by JOURNAL OF JUNGIAN THEORY AND PRACTICE VOL. 8 NO. 1 2006</ref>}}

Jung would later say that: 
{{quote|Hitler seemed like the 'double' of a real person, as if Hitler the man might be hiding inside like an appendix, and deliberately so concealed in order not to disturb the mechanism&nbsp;... You know you could never talk to this man; because there is nobody there&nbsp;... It is not an individual; it is an entire nation.<ref>''C. G. Jung Speaking: Interviews and Encounters'', eds William McGuire and R. F. C. Hull (London: Thames and Hudson, 1978), pp. 91–93, 115–135, 136–40.</ref>}}

In an interview with Carol Baumann in 1948, Jung denied rumors regarding any sympathy for the Nazi movement, saying:
{{quote|It must be clear to anyone who has read any of my books that I have never been a Nazi sympathizer and I never have been anti-Semitic, and no amount of misquotation, mistranslation, or rearrangement of what I have written can alter the record of my true point of view. Nearly every one of these passages has been tampered with, either by malice or by ignorance. Furthermore, my friendly relations with a large group of Jewish colleagues and patients over a period of many years in itself disproves the charge of anti-Semitism.<ref>Interview with Carol Baumann, published in the ''Bulletin of Analytical Psychology Club of New York'', December 1949.</ref>{{refn|group=lower-alpha|A full response from Jung discounting the rumors can be found in ''C. G Jung Speaking, Interviews and Encounters'', Princeton University Press, 1977.}}}}

==Influence==
Jung has had an enduring influence on psychology as well as wider society.

===Psychology===

====Psychology of religion====
During several decades, Jung's ideas on religion gave a counterbalance to the Freudian scepticism on religion. Jung's idea of religion as a practical road to individuation has been quite popular, and is still treated in modern textbooks on the [[psychology of religion]], though his ideas have also been criticized.{{sfn|Wulff|1991|p=411-466}}

====Alcoholics Anonymous====
Jung recommended spirituality as a cure for alcoholism and he is considered to have had an indirect role in establishing [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Levin|first=Jerome David |title=Introduction to Alcoholism Counseling|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1995|pages=167|chapter=Other etiological theories of Alcoholism|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_y7H9Sq5g6kC&pg=PA167 | isbn=978-1-56032-358-7}}</ref> Jung once treated an American patient ([[Rowland Hazard III]]), suffering from chronic [[alcoholism]]. After working with the patient for some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only the possibility of a spiritual experience. Jung noted that occasionally such experiences had been known to reform alcoholics where all else had failed.

Rowland took Jung's advice seriously and set about seeking a personal spiritual experience. He returned home to the United States and joined a First-Century [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement known as the [[Oxford Group]] (later known as Moral Re-Armament). He also told other alcoholics what Jung had told him about the importance of a spiritual experience. One of the alcoholics he brought into the Oxford Group was [[Ebby Thacher]], a long-time friend and drinking buddy of [[William Griffith Wilson|Bill Wilson]], later co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA). Thacher told Wilson about the Oxford Group, and through them Wilson became aware of Hazard's experience with Jung. The influence of Jung thus indirectly found its way into the formation of Alcoholics Anonymous, the original [[twelve-step program]], and from there into the whole twelve-step recovery movement, although AA as a whole is not Jungian and Jung had no role in the formation of that approach or the twelve steps.

The above claims are documented in the letters of Jung and Bill W. (i.e., Bill Wilson), excerpts of which can be found in ''Pass It On'', published by Alcoholics Anonymous.<ref>Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (1984) ''Pass It On: The Story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message reached the world.'' New York: Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. ISBN 0-916856-12-7, pp. 381–386.</ref> Although the detail of this story is disputed by some historians, Jung himself discussed an Oxford Group member, who may have been the same person, in talks given around 1940. The remarks were distributed privately in transcript form, from shorthand taken by an attender (Jung reportedly approved the transcript), and later recorded in Volume 18 of his ''Collected Works'', ''The Symbolic Life'' ("For instance, when a member of the Oxford Group comes to me in order to get treatment, I say, 'You are in the Oxford Group; so long as you are there, you settle your affair with the Oxford Group. I can't do it better than Jesus.'"  Jung goes on to  state that he has seen similar cures among [[Roman Catholics]]).<ref>Jung, C. G.; Adler, G. and Hull, R. F. C., eds. (1977), ''Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 18: The Symbolic Life: Miscellaneous Writings'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, ISBN 978-0-691-09892-0, p. 272, as noted 2007-08-26 at http://www.stellarfire.org/additional.html</ref>

====Art therapy====
Jung proposed that art can be used to alleviate or contain feelings of trauma, fear, or anxiety and also to repair, restore and heal.<ref name="art-therapy"/> In his work with patients and in his own personal explorations, Jung wrote that art expression and images found in dreams could be helpful in recovering from trauma and emotional distress. He often drew, painted, or made objects and constructions at times of emotional distress, which he recognized as more than recreational.<ref name="art-therapy"/>

* [[Federico Fellini]] brought to the screen an exuberant imagery shaped by his encounter with the ideas of Carl Jung, especially Jungian [[dream interpretation]].

* ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'', a 2011 film directed by [[David Cronenberg]], is a fictional dramatisation of Jung's life as a psychoanalyst between 1904 and 1913. It mainly concerns his relationships with Freud and [[Sabina Spielrein]], a Russian analyst who became his lover, and later his student.

===Spirituality===
Jung's interest in philosophy and the occult led many to view Jung as a mystic, although Jung's ambition was to be seen as a man of science.<ref name="Lachmanpage258" /> His influence on popular psychology, the "psychologization of religion"{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1993|p=224}}, [[spirituality]] and the [[New Age]] movement has been immense.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1993|p=496-513}}

==Works==

Jung was a prolific writer. [[The Collected Works of C. G. Jung|His collected works]] fill 19 volumes. Many of his works were not translated into English until after his death.
