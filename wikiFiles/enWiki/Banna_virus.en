'''Banna virus (BAV)''' is a virus belonging to ''[[Reoviridae]]'', a family of segmented, non-enveloped, [[double-stranded RNA viruses]].<ref name=cdcbanna1 >{{cite pmid|18680655|noedit}}</ref> It is an [[arbovirus]], being primarily transmitted to humans from the bite of infected mosquitoes of the species ''[[Culex tritaeniorhynchus]]''. Pigs and cattle have also shown to be [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of transmission. The most common symptom of infection is [[fever]], but in some cases [[encephalitis]] may occur.<ref name=cdcbanna2 >{{cite pmid|20202434|noedit}}</ref> There is no specific treatment for infection, so treatment should be to alleviate and control the severity of symptoms until the immune system has cleared the infection.

==Virology==

===Structure and genome===
BAV is a small (72-75&nbsp;nm in size), non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus surrounded by an [[Icosahedron|icosahedral]] protein coat. Fibre proteins extend outward from the surface of the protein coat. The [[genome]] of BAV is about 19,500 base pairs in length, linear and segmented into 12 parts, encoding for genes VP1-12. Seven of these, VP1-4 and VP8-10, are structural proteins. VP4 and VP9 form the outer protein coat. The inner particles of the coat are composed of VP1-3, VP8 and VP10. VP7 serves as a [[protein kinase]], VP1 as an RNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]], VP3 as a [[capping enzyme]], and VP12 as a [[RNA-binding protein|dsRNA-binding protein]].<ref name=jogvbanna >{{cite pmid|15784909|noedit}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The dsRNA segments and proteins of ''Banna virus''|url=http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/Bannavirus-Proteins.htm}}</ref>

===Types and evolution===
Because BAV is physically and genetically similar to [[Rotavirus]], it is believed they share a common ancestor. Phylogenetic analysis of the various BAV strains suggests that the BAV-Ch and BAV-In6969 strains were two individual [[genotypes]] at one point in time(A and B), before becoming the prototype species for two distinct [[serotypes]](A and B) among all 38 identified strains.<ref name=cdcbanna2 />

==Diagnosis==
Detection of the nucleic-acid of BAV can be performed with a [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR) [[assay]] to produce detectable [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] of BAV. This assay provides for a clear mechanism of distinguishing BAV infection from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), [[Batai virus]], [[Sindbis virus]] and [[Orbivirus]]es. The assay is about 100 times more sensitive than traditional PCRs, enough to detect about .5 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID-50) of BAV in 50 microliter samples.<ref>{{cite pmid|16642219|noedit}}</ref>

==History==
Banna virus was first isolated from the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of encephalitis patients in [[Xishuangbanna]], [[Yunnan province]], [[People's Republic of China]] in 1987. Subsequent identification came in the [[Xinjiang province]] and the virus has since been found elsewhere in China, [[Indonesia]], and [[Vietnam]] in mosquito populations.<ref name=cdcbanna1 /><ref name=jogvbanna /> Because BAV displays similar symptoms to [[Japanese encephalitis]] and the two viruses share their method of transmission, it is possible that some past outbreaks of JE may have been caused by BAV. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has cataloged BAV as an emerging infectious disease due to its geographic spreading in recent history.<ref name=cdcbanna2 />
