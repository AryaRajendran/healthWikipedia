Cyclical variations in moods and energy levels have been recorded at least as far back as several thousand years. The words "[[melancholia]]" (an old word for [[depression (mood)|depression]]) and "mania" have their [[etymologies]] in [[Ancient Greek]]. The word melancholia is derived from ''melas''/μελας, meaning "black", and ''chole''/χολη, meaning "bile" or "gall",<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}</ref> indicative of the term’s origins in pre-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] [[humoral]] theories. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of [[yellow bile]], or a mixture of black and yellow bile.

==The linguistic origins of mania in relation to bipolar disorder==

The [[linguistics|linguistic]] origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies are proposed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] physician [[Caelius Aurelianus]], including the Greek word ""ania", meaning to produce great mental anguish, and "manos", meaning relaxed or loose, which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul (Angst and Marneros 2001). There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic [[poetry]] and [[mythology|mythologies]] (Angst and Marneros 2001).

==Relationship between mania and melancholia==

The idea of a relationship between mania and melancholia can be traced back to at least the 2nd century AD. [[Soranus (Greek Physician)|Soranus]] of Ephesus (98–177 AD) described mania and melancholia as distinct diseases with separate [[etiologies]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Bipolar disorders beyond major depression and euphoric mania |url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/35176/excerpt/9780521835176_excerpt.p df|publisher=cambridge.org|accessdate=2008-02-16|format=PDF}}</ref> however, he acknowledged that “many others consider melancholia a form of the disease of mania” (Cited in Mondimore 2005 p.&nbsp;49).

The earliest written descriptions of a relationship between mania and melancholia are attributed to [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]]. Aretaeus was an [[Eclectic medicine|eclectic]] medical philosopher who lived in [[Alexandria]] somewhere between 30 and 150 AD (Roccatagliata 1986{{Which|date=March 2009}}; Akiskal 1996{{Which|date=March 2009}}). Aretaeus is recognized as having authored most of the surviving texts referring to a unified concept of manic-depressive illness, viewing both melancholia and mania as having a common origin in "black bile" (Akiskal 1996{{Which|date=March 2009}}; Marneros 2001{{Which|date=March 2009}}).

==Origin of bipolar disorder as a mental illness==
A clear understanding of bipolar disorder as a mental illness was recognized by early Chinese authors. The encyclopedist [[Gao Lian (dramatist)|Gao Lian]] (c. 1583) describes the malady in his ''Eight Treatises on the Nurturing of Life'' (Ts'un-sheng pa-chien).<ref>http://www.nmh.gov.tw/nmh_web/english_version/exhibition/exhibition_s0703.cfm</ref>

[[Avicenna]], a [[Islamic medicine|Persian physician]] and [[Islamic psychology|psychological thinker]] who wrote ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' in 1025, identified bipolar disorder as a manic depressive [[psychosis]], which he clearly distinguished from other forms of [[Insanity|madness]] (''Junun'') such as [[mania]], [[rabies]], and [[schizophrenia]] (''Junun Mufrit'' or severe madness).<ref name="Dening-57">{{Cite journal

The basis of the current conceptualisation of manic-depressive illness can be traced back to the 1850s; on January 31, 1854, [[Jules Baillarger]] described to the French Imperial [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Academy of Medicine]] a [[biphasic disease|biphasic]] [[mental illness]] causing recurrent oscillations between mania and depression, which he termed ''folie à double forme'' (‘dual-form insanity’).<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15506718 |title=Circular insanity, 150 years on | volume=188 | issue=2 |year=2004 |author=Pichot P |journal=Bull. Acad. Natl. Med. |pages=275–84}}</ref> Two weeks later, on February 14, 1854, [[Jean-Pierre Falret]] presented a description to the Academy on what was essentially the same disorder, and designated ''folie circulaire'' (‘circular [[insanity]]’) by him.(Sedler 1983) The two bitterly disputed as to who had been the first to conceptualise the condition.

These concepts were developed by the German [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926), who, using [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum|Kahlbaum]]'s concept of [[cyclothymia]],<ref name="millon">{{cite book

He coined the term ''manic depressive [[psychosis]]'', after noting that periods of acute illness, manic or depressive, were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally.<ref>[[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin, Emil]] (1921) ''Manic-depressive Insanity and Paranoia'' ISBN 0-405-07441-7</ref>

===Distinction between Manic-depression involving psychotic states, and that which does not involve psychosis===
The first diagnostic distinction to be made between manic-depression involving psychotic states, and that which does not involve psychosis, came from Carl Gustav Jung in 1903.<ref name="Thompson, J. 2012">Thompson, J. (2012) A Jungian Approach to Bipolar Disorder, Soul Books</ref><ref>Jung, C.G., (1903) ‘On Manic mood disorder’ in Psychiatric Studies Vol-1, Collected works, second edition (1970) translated by R.F.C Hull. Routledge and Kegan Paul.</ref> Jung’s distinction is today referred to in the DSM-IV as that between ‘bipolar I’ (involving psychotic episodes) and ‘bipolar II’ (without psychosis). In his paper Jung introduced the non-psychotic version of the illness with the introductory statement, “I would like to publish a number of cases whose peculiarity consists in chronic hypomanic behaviour” where “it is not a question of real mania at all but of a hypomanic state which cannot be regarded as psychotic”.<ref name="Thompson, J. 2012"/><ref>Jung, C.G., (1903) ‘On Manic mood disorder’ in Psychiatric Studies Vol-1, Collected works, second edition (1970) translated by R.F.C Hull. Routledge and Kegan Paul. pp.109-111</ref> Jung illustrated the non-psychotic variation with 5 case histories, each involving hypomanic behaviour, occasional bouts of depression, and mixed mood states, which involved personal and interpersonal upheaval for each patient.<ref name="Thompson, J. 2012"/>

==Initial treatment options==
After [[World War II]], Dr. [[John Cade]], an Australian [[psychiatrist]], was investigating the effects of various compounds on veteran patients with manic depressive psychosis. In 1949, Cade discovered that [[lithium carbonate]] could be used as a successful treatment of manic depressive psychosis.<ref>{{cite journal
| author = Cade JF |title=Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=349–52 |year=1949 |month=September |pmid=18142718 |doi= |url=http://www.who.int/docstore/bulletin/pdf/2000/issue4/classics.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Because there was a fear that table salt substitutes could lead to toxicity or death, Cade's findings did not immediately lead to treatments. In the 1950s, U.S. hospitals began experimenting with lithium on their patients. By the mid-'60s, reports started appearing in the medical literature regarding lithium's effectiveness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not approve of lithium's use until 1970.<ref>{{cite journal

==Progression from manic-depressive "reaction" to manic-depressive "illness"==
The term "manic-depressive ''reaction''" appeared in the first [[American Psychiatric Association]] Diagnostic Manual in 1952, influenced by the legacy of [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] who had introduced the paradigm illness as a reaction of biogenetic factors to psychological and social influences.<ref>Goodwin & Jamison. pp. 60–61.</ref> Subclassification of bipolar disorder was first proposed by German psychiatrist [[Karl Leonhard]] in 1957; he was also the first to introduce the terms ''bipolar'' (for those with mania) and ''unipolar'' (for those with depressive episodes only).<ref>Goodwin & Jamison. p62</ref>

In 1968, both the newly revised classification systems ICD-8 and DSM-II termed the condition "manic-depressive ''illness''" as biological thinking came to the fore.<ref>Goodwin & Jamison. p88</ref>

==Current classification of bipolar disorder==
The current [[nosology]], [[bipolar disorder]], became popular only recently, and some individuals prefer the older term because it provides a better description of a continually changing multi-dimensional illness.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Empirical]] and theoretical work on bipolar disorder has throughout history "[[seesaw]]ed" between psychological and biological ways of understanding. Despite the work of Kraepelin (1921) emphasizing the [[psychosocial]] context, conceptions of bipolar disorder as a genetically based illness dominated the 20th century. Since the 1990s, however, there has been a resurgence of interest and research in to the role of psychosocial processes.<ref name="Alloy2005">{{cite journal | last1 = Alloy | first1 = LB | last2 = Abramson | first2 = LY | last3 = Urosevic | first3 = S | last4 = Walshaw | first4 = PD | last5 = Nusslock | first5 = R | last6 = Neeren | first6 = AM | title = The psychosocial context of bipolar disorder: environmental, cognitive, and developmental risk factors. | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 25 | issue = 8 | pages = 1043–75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16140445 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.006 }}</ref>
