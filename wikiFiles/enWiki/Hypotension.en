In [[physiology]] and [[medicine]], '''hypotension''' is abnormally low [[blood pressure]], especially in the [[arteries]] of the [[systemic circulation]].<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hypotension TheFreeDictionary > hypotension. Citing: The American Heritage Science Dictionary Copyright 2005</ref> [[Blood pressure]] is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood. Hypotension is generally considered to be [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] blood pressure less than 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)  or [[Diastolic#Inside_the_arteries|diastolic]] less than 60&nbsp;mm Hg.<ref name='NHLBI2008'>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hyp/hyp_whatis.html |title=Diseases and Conditions Index - Hypotension |accessdate=2008-09-16 |month=September | year=2008 |publisher=National Heart Lung and Blood Institute }}</ref><ref name='Mayo2009def'>{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/low-blood-pressure/DS00590 | title = Low blood pressure (hypotension) — Definition | accessdate = 2010-10-19 | first = Mayo Clinic staff | date = 2009-05-23 | work = MayoClinic.com | publisher = Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research}}</ref> However in practice, blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable symptoms are present.<ref name='Mayo2009causes'>{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/low-blood-pressure/DS00590/DSECTION=causes | title = Low blood pressure (hypotension) — Causes    | accessdate = 2010-10-19 | first = Mayo Clinic staff | date = 2009-05-23 | work = MayoClinic.com | publisher = Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research}}</ref>

Hypotension is the opposite of [[hypertension]], which is high blood pressure. It is best understood as a [[physiologic]]al state, rather than a disease. It is often associated with [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], though not necessarily indicative of it. 

For some people who exercise and are in top physical condition, low blood pressure is a sign of good health and fitness.<ref name='bupalowbloodpressure'>{{cite web | url =  http://www.bupa.co.uk/individuals/health-information/directory/l/low-blood-pressure | title = BUPA: Low blood pressure}}</ref>
For many people, low blood pressure can cause dizziness and fainting or indicate serious heart, endocrine or [[neurological disorders]]. Severely low blood pressure can deprive the brain and other vital organs of oxygen and nutrients, leading to a life-threatening condition called [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The [[Cardinal_symptom#Types|cardinal symptoms]] of hypotension include [[lightheadedness]] or [[dizziness]].{{cn|date=September 2012}} 
If the blood pressure is sufficiently low, [[fainting]] and often [[seizure]]s will occur. 

Low blood pressure is sometimes associated with certain symptoms, many of which are related to causes rather than effects of hypotension:

</div>

==Causes==
Low blood pressure can be caused by low blood volume, hormonal changes, widening of blood vessels, medicine side effects, [[anemia]], heart problems or endocrine problems. 

Reduced blood volume, [[hypovolemia]], is the most common cause of hypotension. This can result from [[hemorrhage]]; insufficient fluid intake, as in starvation; or excessive fluid losses from diarrhea or vomiting.  Hypovolemia is often induced by excessive use of [[diuretic]]s. 

Other medications can produce hypotension by different mechanisms.  Chronic use of [[alpha blockers]] or [[beta blockers]] can lead to hypotension.  [[Beta blocker]]s can cause hypotension both by slowing the heart rate and by decreasing the pumping ability of the heart muscle.  

Decreased [[cardiac output]] despite normal blood volume, due to severe [[congestive heart failure]], large [[myocardial infarction]], heart valve problems, or extremely low heart rate ([[bradycardia]]), often produces hypotension and can rapidly progress to [[cardiogenic shock]]. [[Arrhythmia]]s often result in hypotension by this mechanism.  

Some heart conditions can lead to low blood pressure, including extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure. These conditions may cause low blood pressure because they prevent the body from being able to circulate enough blood.

Excessive [[vasodilation]], or insufficient constriction of the resistance blood vessels (mostly [[arterioles]]), causes hypotension.  This can be due to decreased sympathetic nervous system output or to increased parasympathetic activity occurring as a consequence of injury to the brain or spinal cord or of [[dysautonomia]], an intrinsic abnormality in autonomic system functioning.  Excessive vasodilation can also result from [[sepsis]], [[acidosis]], or medications, such as [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitrate preparations]], [[calcium channel blockers]], or AT1 receptor antagonists ([[Angiotensin II receptor type 1|Angiotensin II acts on AT1 receptors]]).  Many anesthetic agents and techniques, including [[spinal anesthesia]] and most [[Inhalational anaesthetic|inhalational agents]], produce significant [[vasodilation]].  

[[Meditation]], [[yoga]], or other mental-physiological disciplines may produce hypotensive effects.  

Lower blood pressure is a side effect of certain [[botanical|botanicals]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tabassum|first=Nahida|coauthors=Feroz Ahmad|title=Role of natural herbs in the treatment of hypertension|journal=Pharmacognosy Review|date=6|year=2011|month=Apr|volume=5|issue=9|pages=30–40|doi=10.4103/0973-7847.79097|pmid=22096316|url=http://www.phcogrev.com/article.asp?issn=0973-7847;year=2011;volume=5;issue=9;spage=30;epage=40;aulast=Tabassum|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref> which can also interact with hypotensive medications.  An example is the [[theobromine]] in [[Theobroma cacao]], which lowers blood pressure<ref>Mitchell ES, Slettenaar M, vd Meer N, Transler C, Jans L, Quadt F, Berry M.

==Pathophysiology==
Blood pressure is continuously regulated by the [[autonomic nervous system]], using an elaborate network of [[sensory receptors|receptors]], [[nerve]]s, and [[hormone]]s to balance the effects of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], which tends to raise blood pressure, and the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], which lowers it. The vast and rapid compensation abilities of the autonomic nervous system allow normal individuals to maintain an acceptable blood pressure over a wide range of activities and in many disease states.

==Syndromes==
[[Orthostatic hypotension]], also called "postural hypotension", is a common form of low blood pressure. It occurs after a change in body position, typically when a person stands up from either a seated or lying position. It is usually transient and represents a delay in the normal compensatory ability of the autonomic nervous system. It is commonly seen in [[hypovolemia]] and as a result of various medications. In addition to blood pressure-lowering medications, many psychiatric medications, in particular [[antidepressant]]s, can have this side effect.  Simple blood pressure and heart rate measurements while lying, seated, and standing (with a two-minute delay in between each position change) can confirm the presence of orthostatic hypotension.  Orthostatic hypotension is indicated if there is a drop in 20 mmHg of systolic pressure (and a 10 mmHg drop in diastolic pressure in some facilities) and a 20 beats per minute increase in heart rate.

[[Neurocardiogenic syncope]] is a form of dysautonomia characterized by an inappropriate drop in blood pressure while in the upright position. Neurocardiogenic syncope is related to [[vasovagal syncope]] in that both occur as a result of increased activity of the [[vagus nerve]], the mainstay of the parasympathetic nervous system.

Another, but rarer form, is [[postprandial]] hypotension, a drastic decline in blood pressure which occurs 30 to 75 minutes after eating substantial meals.<ref>Merck Manual Home Edition. [http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec03/ch023/ch023d.html "Postprandial Hypotension."] Last accessed October 26, 2011.</ref>  When a great deal of blood is diverted to the [[intestines]] (a kind of "[[splanchnic]] blood pooling") to facilitate [[digestion]] and [[absorption (small intestine)|absorption]], the body must increase [[cardiac output]] and peripheral [[vasoconstriction]] to maintain enough blood pressure to perfuse vital organs, such as the brain. Postprandial hypotension is believed to be caused by the autonomic nervous system not compensating appropriately, because of aging or a specific disorder.

==Diagnosis==
For most adults, the healthiest [[blood pressure]] is at or below 120/80&nbsp;mmHg. A small drop in blood pressure, even as little as 20&nbsp;mmHg, can result in transient hypotension.<ref>

Evaluation of [[neurocardiogenic syncope]] is done with a [[tilt table test]].

==Treatment==
The treatment for hypotension depends on its cause. Chronic hypotension rarely exists as more than a symptom. Asymptomatic hypotension in healthy people usually does not require treatment. Adding [[electrolytes]] to a diet can relieve symptoms of mild hypotension. A morning dose of [[caffeine]] can also be effective. In mild cases, where the patient is still responsive, laying the person in dorsal decubitus (lying on the back) position and lifting the legs will increase venous return, thus making more blood available to critical organs at the chest and head. The [[Trendelenburg position]], though used historically, is no longer recommended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1710 |title=BestBets: Use of the Trendelenburg Position to Improve Hemodynamics During Hypovolemic Shock }}</ref>

The treatment of hypotensive shock always follows the first four following steps. Outcomes, in terms of mortality, are directly linked to the speed in which hypotension is corrected. In parentheses are the still debated methods for achieving, and benchmarks for evaluating, progress in correcting hypotension. A study<ref>{{cite journal

Medium-term (and less well-demonstrated) treatments of hypotension include:
* Blood sugar control (80-150 by one study)
* Early nutrition (by mouth or by tube to prevent [[ileus]])
* Steroid support
