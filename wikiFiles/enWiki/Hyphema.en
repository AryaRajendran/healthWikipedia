'''Hyphema''' (or '''hyphaema''', see [[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|spelling differences]]) is blood in the front ([[anterior chamber|anterior]]) chamber of the [[human eye|eye]]. It may appear as a reddish tinge, or it may appear as a small pool of blood at the bottom of the iris or in the cornea.

==Epidemiology==
The rates of hyphemas in the United States are about 20 cases per 100,000 people annually.<ref name=Medscape />

==Causes==
Hyphemas are frequently caused by injury, and may partially or completely block vision.  The most common causes of hyphema are [[intraocular surgery]], blunt trauma, and lacerating trauma.  Hyphemas may also occur spontaneously, without any inciting trauma.  Spontaneous hyphemas are usually caused by the abnormal growth of blood vessels ([[neovascularization]]), tumors of the eye ([[retinoblastoma]] or iris [[melanoma]]), [[uveitis]], or vascular anomalies ([[juvenile xanthogranuloma]]).<ref name=Medscape>{{cite web|last=Sheppard|first=John D.|title=Hyphema|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1190165-overview#showall|work=WebMD, LLC|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> Additional causes of spontaneous hyphema include: [[rubeosis iridis]], [[myotonic dystrophy]], [[leukemia]], [[hemophilia]], and [[von Willebrand disease]].<ref name=Tx_TraumaticHyphema>{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=William|coauthors=Von Hagen, Stanley; Grigorian, Ruben; Zarbin, Marco|title=Management of Traumatic Hyphema|journal=Survey of Ophthalmology|year=2002|month=July–August|volume=47|issue=4|pages=297–334|doi=10.1016/S0039-6257(02)00317-X|pmid=12161209|url=http://www.surveyophthalmol.com/article/S0039-6257(02)00317-X/abstract|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>  Conditions or medications that cause thinning of the blood, such as [[aspirin]], [[warfarin]], or [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking alcohol]] may also cause hyphema.

==Prognosis==
Hyphemas require urgent assessment by an ophthalmologist as they may result in permanent visual impairment. 

A long-standing hyphema may result in [[hemosiderosis]] and [[heterochromia]].  Blood accumulation may also cause an elevation of the [[intraocular pressure]].  On average, the increased pressure in the eye remains for six days before dropping.<ref name=Medscape />  Most uncomplicated hyphemas resolve within 5–6 days.<ref name=Medscape />

==Treatment==
The main goals of treatment are to decrease the risk of rebleeding within the eye, corneal blood staining, and atrophy of the optic nerve.  Small hyphemas can usually be treated on an outpatient basis.  Most treatment plans consist of elevating the head at night, wearing a patch and shield, and controlling any increase in intraocular pressure.  Surgery may be necessary for non-resolving hyphemas, or hyphaemas that are associated with high pressure that does not respond to medication.  Surgery can be effective for cleaning out the anterior chamber and preventing corneal blood staining.<ref name=Tx_TraumaticHyphema />

Elevation of the head of the bed by approximately 45 degrees (so that the hyphema can settle out inferiorly and avoid obstruction of vision, as well as to facilitate resolution).  Bed rest may be considered, although evidence suggests that it does not improve outcomes.  Wearing of an eye shield at night time (to prevent accidental rubbing of the eyes during sleep, which can precipitate a rebleed).  An eye patch should be worn throughout the day to protect the injured eye.  

If pain management is necessary, [[acetaminophen]] can be used.  [[Aspirin]] and [[ibuprofen]] should be avoided, because they thin the blood and increase the risk of a rebleed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=JS|coauthors=Lewandowski, RL; Chan, W|title=The effect of aspirin on rebleeding in traumatic hyphema.|journal=American journal of ophthalmology|year=1975|month=September|volume=80|issue=3 Pt 2|pages=543–5|pmid=1163602|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1311523/|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>  Sedation is not usually necessary for patients with hyphema.  It is controversial among ophthalmologists whether a [[Corticosteroid|steroid medication]] or a dilating drop ([[mydriasis|mydriatic]]) should be used in treatment of hyphema.  Steroids aim to reduce the amount of inflammation, but also cause side effects.  Dilating drops aim to increase comfort from the traumatized iris as well as reduce bleeding, but can also cause the pupil to be fixed in a dilated state via posterior synechiae (adhesions).

==Complications==
While the vast majority of hyphemas resolve on their own without issue, sometimes complications occur. Traumatic hyphema may lead to increased [[intraocular pressure]], peripheral anterior synechiae, [[atrophy]] of the [[optic nerve]], staining of the cornea with blood, re-bleeding, and impaired [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]].<ref name=Tx_TraumaticHyphema />

Secondary hemorrhage, or rebleeding of the hyphema, is thought to worsen outcomes in terms of visual function.
