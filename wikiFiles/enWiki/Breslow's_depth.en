In [[medicine]], '''Breslow's depth''' was used as a [[prognosis|prognostic factor]] in [[melanoma]] of the [[skin]]. It is a description of how deeply tumor cells have invaded. Currently, the standard Breslow's depth has been replaced by the AJCC depth. Originally, Breslow's depth was divided into 5 stages.<ref name=pmid5477666>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000658-197011000-00017 |title=Thickness, Cross-Sectional Areas and Depth of Invasion in the Prognosis of Cutaneous Melanoma |year=1970 |last1=Breslow |first1=Alexander |journal=Annals of Surgery |volume=172 |issue=5 |pages=902–8 |pmid=5477666 |pmc=1397358}}</ref>

==History==

Depth of invasion was first reported as a prognostic factor in melanoma by the [[pathologist]] Alexander Breslow, M.D. at George Washington University in 1970.<ref name=pmid5477666/> In recognition of his contribution, the depth of invasion of melanoma is referred to by the [[eponym]] ''Breslow's depth''.

Subsequent studies confirmed and refined the role of depth of invasion in the prognosis of malignant melanoma.<ref name=pmid7736394>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19950515)75:10<2499::AID-CNCR2820751016>3.0.CO;2-8 |title=Primary cutaneous melanoma.

==Measurement==

Tumor depth is most accurately measured by evaluating the entire tumor via an [[excisional biopsy]]. Determination from specimens obtained using other [[biopsy]] techniques, such as a wedge or punch biopsy, are less accurate. tumor depth cannot be calculated from a shave biopsy that only contains a portion of the tumor because it leads to an underestimation of its thickness.

Breslow's depth is determined by using an [[ocular micrometer]] at a [[right angle]] to the skin to directly measure the depth to which [[tumor|tumor cells]] have invaded the [[skin]]. Breslow's depth is measured from the [[Stratum granulosum|granular layer]] of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] down to the deepest point of invasion (sometimes involving detached nests of cells).

==Prognostic importance==

Tumor depth is one of the cornerstones of the current [[AJCC]] [[TNM staging system|TNM]] staging of malignant melanoma. A large study validated the importance of tumor depth (but not Breslow's original description) as one of the three most important prognostic factors in melanoma (the others being T stage and ulceration).<ref name=pmid11504744>{{cite journal |pmid=11504744 |year=2001 |last1=Balch |first1=CM |last2=Soong |first2=SJ |last3=Gershenwald |first3=JE |last4=Thompson |first4=JF |last5=Reintgen |first5=DS |last6=Cascinelli |first6=N |last7=Urist |first7=M |last8=McMasters |first8=KM |last9=Ross |first9=MI |title=Prognostic factors analysis of 17,600 melanoma patients: Validation of the American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging system |volume=19 |issue=16 |pages=3622–34 |journal=Journal of clinical oncology}}</ref> Breslow's depth also accurately predicted the risk for [[lymph node]] [[metastasis]], with deeper tumors being more likely to involve the nodes.<ref name=pmid12794025>{{cite journal |doi=10.1245/ASO.2003.09.016 |title=Revised American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Criteria Accurately Predict Sentinel Lymph Node Positivity in Clinically Node-Negative Melanoma Patients |year=2003 |last1=Rousseau |first1=Dennis L. |last2=Ross |first2=Merrick I. |last3=Johnson |first3=Marcella M. |last4=Prieto |first4=Victor G. |last5=Lee |first5=Jeffrey E. |last6=Mansfield |first6=Paul F. |last7=Gershenwald |first7=Jeffrey E. |journal=Annals of Surgical Oncology |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=569–74 |pmid=12794025}}</ref>

The above studies showed that depth was a continuous variable correlating with prognosis. However, for staging purposes, the most recent AJCC guidelines use cutoffs of 1&nbsp;mm, 2&nbsp;mm, and 4&nbsp;mm to divide patients into stages.

==Clark's level==

Clark's level is a related [[Staging (pathology)|staging system]], used in conjunction with Breslow's depth, which describes the level of anatomical invasion of the melanoma in the skin.<ref name = weedon>Weedon, D. '''Skin pathology'''. 2nd Edition. 2002. Sydney: Churchill-Livingstone. ISBN 0-443-07069-5{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}</ref>  Clark's level was the primary factor in earlier AJCC staging schemae for melanoma. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} However, with further study, it has been shown that Clark's level has a lower predictive value, is less reproducible, and is more operator-dependent as compared with Breslow's depth. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Thus, in the current (2010) AJCC staging system, Clark's level has prognostic significance only in patients with very thin (Breslow depth <1&nbsp;mm) melanomas.<ref name=pmid11504744>{{cite journal |pmid=11504744 |year=2001 |last1=Balch |first1=CM |last2=Soong |first2=SJ |last3=Gershenwald |first3=JE |last4=Thompson |first4=JF |last5=Reintgen |first5=DS |last6=Cascinelli |first6=N |last7=Urist |first7=M |last8=McMasters |first8=KM |last9=Ross |first9=MI |title=Prognostic factors analysis of 17,600 melanoma patients: Validation of the American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging system |volume=19 |issue=16 |pages=3622–34 |journal=Journal of clinical oncology}}</ref>  

Five anatomical levels are recognized, and higher levels have worsening prognostic implications.  These levels are:

* Level 1 : Melanoma confined to the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] (melanoma in situ)
* Level 2 : Invasion into the [[papillary dermis]]
*Level 3 : Invasion to the junction of the [[Papillary dermis|papillary]] and [[reticular dermis]] 
*Level 4 : Invasion into the [[reticular dermis]]
*Level 5 : Invasion into the subcutaneous fat <ref name = weedon/>
