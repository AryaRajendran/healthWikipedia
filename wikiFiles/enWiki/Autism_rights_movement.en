{{Autism rights movement}}
The '''autism rights movement''' ('''ARM''') (also '''[[neurodiversity]] movement''' or '''autistic culture movement''') is a [[social movement]] that encourages [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] people, their caregivers and society to adopt a position of neurodiversity, accepting autism as a variation in functioning rather than a [[mental disorder]] to be cured.<ref name="Solomon">{{cite news |work=New York |title=The autism rights movement |last=Solomon |first=Andrew |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080527025140/http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archivedate= 27 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The ARM advocates a variety of goals including a greater acceptance of autistic behaviors;<ref name=AAP>[http://www.taaproject.com/about-us/mission-statement/ Mission Statement.]  Autism Acceptance Project.

Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that autism spectrum disorders are genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome.  This perspective is distinct from two wings of the autism cure movement: (1) the perspective that autism spectrum disorders are caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s) and (2) the perspective that autism is caused by environmental factors like vaccines and pollution and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.<ref name="Solomon"/>

The movement is [[controversial]] and there are a wide variety of both supportive and critical opinions about the movement among people whose lives are affected by autism. 

There are several organizations in the autism rights movement.  Some, like the [[Autistic Self Advocacy Network]] have non-profit status while others such as [[Autism Network International]] do not. 

==Anti-cure perspective==
"Curing" and/or "treating" autism is a [[Ethical challenges to autism treatment|controversial]] and [[politicized issue]].  Doctors and scientists are not clear on the [[causes of autism|cause(s) of autism]] yet many organizations like [[Defeat Autism Now!]] and [[Autism Speaks]] advocate researching a cure. Members of the various autism rights organizations view autism as a way of life rather than as a disease and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.<ref name="Harmon"/><ref name="SanerDisease"/> Some advocates believe that common treatments for the behavioral and [[language delay]]s associated with autism, like [[Applied behavior analysis]] therapy, are not only misguided but also unethical.<ref>[[Michelle Dawson|Dawson, Michelle]]. [http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_aba.html The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists.] (2004-01-18). Retrieved on 2007-01-23.</ref> 

The ''"anti-cure perspective"'' endorsed by the movement is a view that [[autism]] is not a disorder, but a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome.<ref name="Harmon"/> Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be validated, supported and appreciated rather than shunned, discriminated against or cured.<ref name="Harmon"/><ref name=Gal>{{cite news |author=Gal L |title=Who says autism's a disease? |work=Haaretz |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html |accessdate=2007-07-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070701201936/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html| archivedate= 1 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> They believe quirks and uniqueness of autistic individuals should be tolerated as the differences of any minority group should be tolerated and that efforts to cure autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing [[left-handedness]].<ref name="Harmon"/><ref name=Dawson>{{cite web |url=http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html|title=In Support of Michelle Dawson and Her Work|publisher=Autistics.org |accessdate=2012-03-21}}</ref>

Variations within the anti-cure movement are diverse. Jim Sinclair, a leader in the movement, argues that autism is essential to a person, not a disease secondary to the person. He says that wishing that an autistic person be cured is equivalent to wishing that he disappear and another completely different person exist in his place.<ref name=DontMourn>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmonds-institute.org/dontmour.html |title=Don't mourn for us |publisher=The Edmonds Institute |author=Sinclair, Jim |year=1993 |accessdate=2007-11-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071020225532/http://www.edmonds-institute.org/dontmour.html| archivedate= 20 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Visions for a future where autism has been eradicated, he believes, is the desire to end [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|the autistic culture]].<ref name="DontMourn"/>

==="How do you fit in and still be ''YOU?"''===
Some movement members with [[Asperger syndrome]], who do not have the language delays typical of autistic individuals, believe their way of life should be respected and they should be left alone completely. Other members agree that autistics should not be made to act exactly like everyone else, but that they should receive therapy to help them learn to communicate in innovative ways or regulate emotions.<ref name="RogerCollier"/><ref name=Woodford>Woodford, Gillian.

Retrieved on 2008-02-10.</ref>

[[Simon Baron-Cohen]], a professor of [[developmental psychology]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and an autism researcher, expressed the latter view.<ref>{{cite journal |title=In a different world |year=2001 |journal=New Scientist |author=Else L |issue=2286 |pages=42}}</ref> Baron-Cohen said:<ref name="SanerDisease"/>
{{cquote|I do think there is a benefit in trying to help people with autism-spectrum conditions with areas of difficulty such as emotion recognition. Nobody would dispute the place for interventions that alleviate areas of difficulty, while leaving the areas of strength untouched. But to talk about a 'cure for autism' is a sledge-hammer approach and the fear would be that in the process of alleviating the areas of difficulty, the qualities that are special - such as the remarkable attention to detail, and the ability to concentrate for long periods on a small topic in depth - would be lost. Autism is both a disability and a difference. We need to find ways of alleviating the disability while respecting and valuing the difference.}}

==History==
[[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Jim Sinclair]] was the first individual to communicate the anti-cure or autism rights perspective in the late 1980s.<ref name="Solomon"/>  In 1992 he co-founded the [[Autism Network International]], an organization that publishes newsletters 
"written by and for autistic people".  Other individuals involved in the creation of the ANI were [[Donna Williams]] and Kathy Grant, two autistic individuals that knew Sinclair through pen pal lists and autism conferences.  The first issue of the newsletter, "Our Voice", was distributed online in November 1992 to an audience of mostly neuro-typical professionals and parents of young children with autism.  The number of autistics in the organization grew slowly over the years and became a communication network for like-minded autistics.<ref name=ANIHist>[[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Sinclair, Jim]].

In 2004 Michelle Dawson challenged [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) on ethical grounds.  She testified in ''[[Auton (Guardian ad litem of) v. British Columbia (Attorney General)|Auton v. British Columbia]]'' against the required government funding of ABA.<ref name="RogerCollier"/> That same year ''[[The New York Times]]'' covered the autism rights perspective by publishing Amy Harmon's article, "How about not curing us?

The rise of the internet provided more opportunities for autistic individuals to connect and organize.  Due to geographical distance, communication and speech patterns of autistic individuals and the domination of neurotypical professionals and family members in established autism organizations, the internet provided an invaluable space for members of the movement to organize and communicate.<ref name="UN"/><ref name="ANIHist"/>

==Groups in the movement==
* [[Autism Network International]] (ANI) is a [[self-advocacy]] organization that was founded in 1992 by autistic individuals.
* [[Autistic Self Advocacy Network]] (ASAN) is a [[self-advocacy]] organization founded by Ari Ne'eman to represent the autistic community and further the autism rights movement.
* [[Aspies For Freedom]] is a web-based organization for the autism community that has more than 20,000 members.
* [[Don't Play Me, Pay Me]] is a UK campaign, focusing on Asperger syndrome, encouraging and supporting actors with neurological conditions

==Events and activities==
*The ANI annually hosts [[Autism Network International|Autreat]], a retreat-style conference developed to allow autistic individuals to meet, socialize and learn advocacy skills in an "[[autism friendly]]" environment.  It was founded in 1996.<ref name="Autreat"/>
*In 2005 Aspies for Freedom founded [[Autistic Pride Day]].  Every year on June 18 events are held across the globe.
*In 2008, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) succeeded in halting two ad campaigns it stated were demeaning to autistics.  The first ads were a series published by the NYU Child Study Center that appeared in the form of ransom notes.  One read, "We have your son. We will make sure he will no longer be able to care for himself or interact socially as long as he lives. This is only the beginning", and was signed, "Autism".<ref name="Solomon"/>  The second ads were published by [[PETA]] and featured a bowl of milk with the left over bits of cereal forming a frowning face.  The text read, “Got autism?” and was meant to advertise what PETA claims is a link between autism and the [[gluten-free, casein-free diet|casein]] in milk.  Phone calls, letters and petitions organized by ASAN resulted in the removal of these ads.<ref>[http://www.peta.org/feat_autism.asp Got Autism?

*Advocates have implemented several experimental programs for alternative education for individuals on the spectrum.  For instance, the School of ASPIE (Autistic Strength, Purpose and Independence in Education) in Boiceville, NY aims to help autistics cope with a non-autistic world, but stresses that it is acceptable and expected that they "act autistic".<ref name="Harmon"/>

==Issues==

===Autism treatment===
{{further2|[[Autism therapies]]}}

[[Aspies For Freedom]] claims that the most common therapies for autism are unethical.  They argue that [[Applied Behavior Analysis|ABA]] therapy and restriction of stimming "and other autistic coping mechanisms" are mentally harmful, that [[aversion therapy]] and the use of restraints are physically harmful, and that alternative treatments like [[chelation]] are dangerous.<ref name="AFF"/> Michelle Dawson, a Canadian autism self advocate, testified in court against government funding of ABA therapy.<ref name=Dawson />  An autistic person named Jane Meyerding criticized therapy which attempts to remove autistic behaviors because she says that the behaviors that the therapy tries to remove are attempts to communicate.<ref name="Harmon"/>

===Elimination of autism===
Since those in the autism rights movement see autism as a natural human variation and not a disorder, they are opposed to attempts to eliminate autism. In particular, there is opposition to prenatal genetic testing of autism in unborn fetuses, which some believe might be possible in the future (see [[Heritability of autism]]). Some worry that this can prevent autistic people from being born.<ref name="Harmon"/> On February 23, 2005 Joseph Buxbaum of the [[Autism Genome Project]] at the [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] said there could be a prenatal test for autism within 10 years.<ref>{{cite web |author=Herrera, Sue |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7013251 |title=Autism research focuses on early intervention:  Genetic clues sought in fight against disorder |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-02-23|accessdate=2007-11-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071026043242/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7013251| archivedate= 26 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, the [[causes of autism|genetics of autism]] have proven to be extremely complex.<ref name=Freitag>{{cite journal |author=Freitag CM |title=The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636 |url=http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v12/n1/full/4001896a.html}}</ref> In any case, the Autistic Genocide Clock was started in response to this, which counts down to 10 years after Buxbaum made this announcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ventura33.com/clock/ |title=The Autistic Genocide Clock |publisher=Ventura33 FanFiction |accessdate=2007-11-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071015072038/http://ventura33.com/clock/| archivedate= 15 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The public has started to debate the [[ethics]] involved in the possible elimination of a [[genotype]] that has liabilities and advantages, which may be seen as tampering with [[natural selection]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[MSNBC]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7899821/ |title=Would you have allowed Bill Gates to be born?

===Perception of autism===
[[Image:Autismawareness.jpg||right||frame|The puzzle piece ribbon is used by some autism societies, though it also represents controversy.]]
Autism has been compared to a disease{{by whom?|date=April 2013}}, rather than the variation in functioning preferred by supporters of neurodiversity, with an attendant focus on the burden placed on society in caring for autistic individuals.

===Inclusion in the autism debate===
A common theme expressed among autism rights activists and neurodiversity groups is that they are different from parent- and professional- led organizations and conferences that dominate the autism scene.  Michelle Dawson criticizes the norm of allowing parents to speak on behalf of their autistic children at conferences to the exclusion of autistics.  "With the happy and proud collaboration of governments, courts, researchers, service providers, and funding bodies," she says, "parents have succeeded in removing autistics from the vicinity of any important discussions or decisions."  This exclusion results in policy and treatment decisions being made solely by individuals who do not directly experience autism.<ref name="Bettelheim"/>

Jim Sinclair states that autism conferences are traditionally geared toward neurotypical parents and professionals, and that to an autistic person they may be quite "hostile" in terms of sensory stimulation and rigidity.<ref name="ANIHist"/>

==Criticisms and counter-movements==
{{POV-check|section|date=November 2011}}
The movement has been criticized{{Who|date=June 2010}} for its alleged failure to incorporate diversity and include certain subgroups within the autistic community.

Parents with the perspective of autism as a disorder (which is called the ''"pro-cure perspective"'' in the autism rights movement) believe that therapy with the intent of extinguishing stereotypically autistic behavior is in their children's best interests; they see this as a "cure" that will reduce their children's suffering.<ref name=OnCuring>{{cite web|url=http://wampum.wabanaki.net/archives/001574.html|title=On "curing" autism|date=2005-01-15|publisher=wampum.wabanaki.net|accessdate=2007-11-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name=NYTLetter>{{cite web |url=http://www.sarnet.org/ltr/weintraub1-05.htm |title=Letter to the NY Times from Kit Weintraub |author=Weintraub, Kit |publisher=The Schafer Autism Report |accessdate=2007-11-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070928015503/http://www.sarnet.org/ltr/weintraub1-05.htm| archivedate= 28 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> These critics say ABA gives autistic children the best chance of success in adulthood, as they either do not believe it is possible that adult society could accommodate autistic people (who have not been trained by ABA to exhibit neurotypical behavior at all times) or they do not believe it is desirable to do so.

Some parents believe that intensive behavioral therapy is the only way to "rescue" autistic children.<ref name="Harmon"/> Some critics also fear that the movement will prevent other autistic children from receiving treatment. Neurotypical mother [[Kit Weintraub]] has responded to Michelle Dawson's claims that ABA is harmful by insisting that it is medically necessary and appropriate treatment, and that it is harmful to deny it to autistic children who need it.<ref name=Weintraub>Weintraub, Kit.

There are also accusations about how well autistic people of different functioning levels are represented in the movement. Critics of the movement argue that anyone on the autism spectrum who is able to express their desire not to be cured must be [[high-functioning autism|high functioning autistic]] or have Asperger syndrome,<ref name="Harmon"/> despite the existence of low-functioning autism rights advocates such as [[Amanda Baggs]]. [[Lenny Schafer]] argues that if one would change every use of ''autism'' to read ''Asperger syndrome'' the movement might "make sense",<ref name="Harmon"/> although the upcoming incorporation of Asperger syndrome into the autism diagnosis in the DSM-V has been used as a counterargument by the autism rights movement.<ref>Dawson, Michelle.

[[Sue Rubin]], the subject of the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated documentary ''[[Autism Is A World]]'', is an example of an adult with autism who is aligned with the cure group. In her opinion, people with Asperger syndrome can communicate well and "pass for normal", while low-functioning people have a severe disability; "low functioning people are just trying to get through the day without hurting, tapping, flailing, biting, screaming, etc.  The thought of a gold pot of a potion with a cure really would be wonderful.".<ref name="SueRubin"/>

In defiance of the common complaint that anti-cure advocates' ability to articulate complex opinions in writing—which some critics see as being impossible for autistic people<ref name="Dawson"/>—autistic adults such as Amanda Baggs use their own writing and videos to demonstrate that it is possible for severely disabled autistics to be autism rights advocates.<ref name=Wolman>Wolman, David. [http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-03/ff_autism The Truth About Autism: Scientists Reconsider What They Think They Know]. Retrieved on 2010-05.20.</ref> She says that when the critics assume that intelligent and articulate autistic people do not have difficulties like self-injurious behavior and difficulty with self-care, they affect the opinions of policy makers and make it more difficult for intelligent and articulate autistic people to get services. Baggs cites an example of an autistic person who was denied services when it was discovered that she could type.<ref name=BaggsToKit>{{cite web|author=Baggs, AM |year=2005 |url=http://www.autistics.org/library/ambweintraub.html |title=To the Kit Weintraubs of the World |publisher=autistics.org |accessdate=2007-11-07 |authorlink=Amanda Baggs| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071013143015/http://autistics.org/library/ambweintraub.html| archivedate= 13 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
