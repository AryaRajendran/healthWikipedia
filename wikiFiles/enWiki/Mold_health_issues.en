'''Mold health issues''' are potentially harmful effects of [[mold]]s.

Molds (also spelled "moulds") are ubiquitous in the biosphere, and mold [[spores]] are a common component of household and workplace dust. The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported in its June 2006 report, 'Mold Prevention Strategies and Possible Health Effects in the Aftermath of Hurricanes and Major Floods,' that "excessive exposure to mold-contaminated materials can cause adverse health effects in susceptible persons regardless of the type of mold or the extent of contamination."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weinhold B |title=A spreading concern: inhalational health effects of mold |journal=Environ.

Also, mold may produce mycotoxins, either before or after exposure to humans, potentially causing toxicity.
===Fungal infection===
{{See|Mycosis}}
A serious health threat from mold exposure for immunocompromised individuals is systemic fungal infection (systemic [[mycosis]]). Immunocompromised individuals exposed to high levels of mold, or individuals with chronic exposure may become infected.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nucci M, Anaissie E |title=Fusarium infections in immunocompromised patients |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=695–704 |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17934079 |pmc=2176050 |doi=10.1128/CMR.00014-07 |url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17934079}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gaviria JM, van Burik JA, Dale DC, Root RK, Liles WC |title=Comparison of interferon-gamma, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for priming leukocyte-mediated hyphal damage of opportunistic fungal pathogens |journal=J.

Mycotoxins may or may not be produced by the invading mold.

[[Dermatophyte]]s are the parasitic fungi that cause skin infections such as [[athlete's foot]] and [[tinea cruris]]. Most dermataphyte fungi take the form of a mold, as opposed to a yeast, with appearance (when cultured) that is similar to other molds.

===Mold-induced hypersensitivity===
The most common form of [[hypersensitivity]] is caused by the direct exposure to inhaled mold spores that can be dead or alive or [[hypha]]l fragments which can lead to [[allergic asthma]] or [[allergic rhinitis]].<ref name="Indian">Indian Health Service: Bemidji Area Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Environmental Health Services Section “Guideline on the Assessment and Remediation of Fungi in Indoor Environments”</ref>  The most common effects are [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose), watery eyes, coughing and [[asthma|asthma attacks]].  Another form of hypersensitivity is [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]].  Exposure can occur at home, at work or in other settings.<ref>http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/hp/hp_summary.html</ref><ref name="Indian"/>   It is predicted that about 5% of people have some airway symptoms due to allergic reactions to molds in their lifetimes.<ref>{{cite pmid|12762072 }}</ref>

Hypersensitivity may also be a reaction toward an established fungal infection in [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]].

===Mycotoxin toxicity===
{{Main|Mycotoxin}}
Molds excrete toxic compounds called [[mycotoxin]]s, secondary metabolites produced by fungi under certain environmental conditions. These environmental conditions affect the production of mycotoxins at the transcription level. Temperature, water activity and pH, strongly influence mycotoxin biosynthesis by increasing the level of transcription within the fungal spore. It has also been found that low levels of fungicides can boost mycotoxin synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reverberi M, Ricelli A, Zjalic S, Fabbri AA, Fanelli C |title=Natural functions of mycotoxins and control of their biosynthesis in fungi |journal=Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=899–911 |year=2010 |month=July |pmid=20495914 |doi=10.1007/s00253-010-2657-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bohnert M, Wackler B, Hoffmeister D |title=Spotlights on advances in mycotoxin research |journal=Appl.

Extreme exposure to very high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and in some cases death; fortunately, such exposures rarely to never occur in normal exposure scenarios, even in residences with serious mold problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Prolonged exposure, e.g. daily workplace exposure, can be particularly harmful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

However, not all mycotoxins are harmful, and some are even beneficial to humans, e.g. [[penicillin]].

The health hazards produced by mold have been associated with [[sick building syndrome]], but no validated studies have been able to demonstrate that normal indoor exposures to these common organisms pose a significant threat.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

It is thought{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} that all molds may produce [[mycotoxins]] and thus all molds may be potentially toxic if large enough quantities are ingested, or the human becomes exposed to extreme quantities of mold. Mycotoxins are not produced all the time, but only under specific growing conditions. Mycotoxins are harmful or lethal to humans and animals only when exposure is high enough.

Mycotoxins can be found on the mold spore and mold fragments, and therefore they can also be found on the substrate upon which the mold grows.  Routes of entry for these insults can include ingestion, dermal exposure and inhalation.

Some mycotoxins cause immune system responses that vary considerably, depending on the individual. The duration of exposure, the frequency of exposure and the concentration of the insult (exposure) are elements in triggering immune system response.

[[Aflatoxin]] is an example of a mycotoxin. It is a cancer-causing poison produced by certain fungi in or on foods and feeds, especially in field corn and peanuts.<ref name=fsis>[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Molds_on_Food/ United States Food Safety and Inspection Service > Molds On Food: Are They Dangerous?] Last Modified: March 4, 2010</ref>

Originally, [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] from mold were thought to be the result of exposure to the [[mycotoxin]]s of some mold species, such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]''.  However, studies are suggesting that the so-called toxic effects are actually the result of chronic activation of the immune system, leading to chronic inflammation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Studies indicate that up to 25% of the population have the genetic capability of experiencing chronic inflammation to mold exposure, but it's unknown how many actually experience such symptoms due to common misdiagnosis.  A 1993–94 [[case study]] based on cases of [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] in infants in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] originally concluded there was [[Causality|causal relationship]] between the exposure and the disease.  The investigators revisited the cases and established that there was no link to the exposure to ''S. chartrum'' and the infants in their homes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

== Exposure sources and prevention ==
The main sources of mold exposure are from the indoor air in buildings with substantial mold growth, and from ingestion of food with mold growths.

===Air===
{{Main|Mold growth, assessment, and remediation|Indoor air quality}}
Prevention of mold exposure and ensuing health issues include prevention of mold growth in the first place by avoiding a mold-supporting environment such as humid air. Extensive flooding and water damage can support huge numbers of mold growth. Following hurricanes, homes with greater flood damage, especially those with more than 3 feet of indoor flooding, demonstrated higher levels of mold growth compared with homes with little or no flooding.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barbeau DN, Grimsley LF, White LE, El-Dahr JM, Lichtveld M |title=Mold exposure and health effects following hurricanes Katrina and Rita |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=31 |pages=165–78 |year=2010 |pmid=20070193 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103643?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Shoemaker RC, House DE |title=Sick building syndrome (SBS) and exposure to water-damaged buildings: time series study, clinical trial and mechanisms |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=573–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17010568 |doi=10.1016/j.ntt.2006.07.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0892-0362(06)00085-7}}</ref> The aftermath of a hurricane is the worst case scenario, but the concept of water damage supporting widespread mold growth is more generally applicable.

It is useful to perform an assessment of the location and extent of the mold hazard in a structure. Various practices of remediation can be followed to mitigate mold issues in buildings, the most important of which is to reduce moisture levels.<ref name="control">{{cite journal |author=Kumar, Manisha; Verma, Rajesh K |title=Fungi diversity, their effects on building materials, occupants and control– a brief review |journal=Journal of Scientific and industrial Research |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=657–661 |date=September 2010 |url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/10103 |issn=0975-1084}}</ref> Removal of affected materials after the source of moisture has been reduced and/or eliminated may be necessary.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilson SC, Holder WH, Easterwood KV, ''et al.'' |title=Identification, remediation, and monitoring processes used in a mold-contaminated high school |journal=Adv.

A common issue with mold hazards in the household is the placement of furniture, and the lack of ventilation which this provides to certain parts of the wall. The simplest method of avoiding mold in the home is to move the furniture in question.

Molds may excrete liquids or low-volatility gases, but the concentrations are so low that frequently they cannot be detected even with sensitive analytical sampling techniques.  Sometimes these by-products are detectable by odor, in which case they are referred to as "ergonomic odors" meaning the odors are detectable, but do not indicate toxicologically significant exposures.

===Food===
[[File:Moldy nectarines.jpg|thumb|Moldy [[nectarine]]s that were in a refrigerator. The nectarine with black mold is also affecting the nectarine underneath.]]
Molds that are most often found on meat and poultry are [[Alternaria]], [[Aspergillus]], [[Botryotinia|Botrytis]], [[Cladosporium]], [[Fusarium]], [[Geotrichum]], [[Monilia]], [[Manoscus]], [[Mortierella]], [[Mucor]], [[Neurospora]], [[Oidium]], [[Oosproa]], [[Penicillium]], [[Rhizopus]] and [[Thamnidium]].<ref name=fsis/>

Mycotoxins contaminate grains and other food products across the globe and can significantly impact human health. They can be found growing on grains before harvest and in storage. When ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through skin, mycotoxins may reduce appetite and general performance, and cause sickness or death in some cases.<ref name="Upadhaya"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reddy K, Salleh B, Saad B, Abbas H, Abel C, Shier W |title=An overview of mycotoxin contamination in foods and its implications for human health |journal=[[Toxin Reviews]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=3–26 |year=2010 |doi=10.3109/15569541003598553 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15569541003598553}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=He J, Zhou T |title=Patented techniques for detoxification of mycotoxins in feeds and food matrices |journal=Recent Pat Food Nutr Agric |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=96–104 |year=2010 |month=June |pmid=20653554 |url=http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?FNA/2010/00000002/00000002/001FNA.SGM}}</ref>

Mold growing in or on field corn and peanuts are the ones most likely to produce [[aflatoxin]].<ref name=fsis/>

Prevention of mold exposure from food is generally to not buy or to discard food that has mold growths on it.<ref name=fsis/> Also, mold growth in the first place can be prevented by the same concept of [[mold growth, assessment, and remediation]] that prevents air exposure. In addition, it is especially useful to clean the inside of the refrigerator, and having clean dishcloths, towels, sponges and mops.<ref name=fsis/>

Ruminants are considered to be resistant to the toxic effects of mycotoxins, presumably due to their superior mycotoxin-degrading microbes.<ref name="Upadhaya"/> This suggests that since mycotoxins are difficult to digest by human microbes due to better degradation by rumen microbes as compared to mono-gastric animals like humans.

== History ==
In the 1930s, mold was identified as the cause behind the mysterious deaths of farm animals in Russia and other countries. ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'' was found growing on wet grain used for animal feed.  The illnesses and deaths also occurred in humans when starving peasants ate large quantities of rotten food grains and cereals that were heavily overgrown with the ''Stachybotrys'' mold.

In the 1970s, building [[construction]] techniques changed in response to the changing economic realities including the [[energy crisis]]. As a result, homes and buildings became more airtight.  Also, cheaper materials such as [[drywall]] came into common use. The newer building materials reduced the drying potential of the structures making moisture problems more prevalent.  This combination of increased moisture and suitable substrates contributed to increased mold growth inside buildings.

Today, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] and the agriculture industry closely monitor mold and mycotoxin levels in grains and foodstuffs in order to keep the contamination of animal feed and human food supplies below specific levels. In 2005 [[Diamond Pet Foods]], a US pet food manufacturer, experienced a significant rise in the number of corn shipments containing elevated levels of [[aflatoxin]]. This mold toxin eventually made it into the pet food supply, and dozens of dogs and cats died before the company was forced to recall affected products.
