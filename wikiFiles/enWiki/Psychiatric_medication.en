A '''psychiatric medication''' is a licensed [[psychoactive drug]] taken to exert an effect on the chemical makeup of the [[brain]] and nervous system. Thus, these medications are used to treat [[mental disorder]]s. Usually prescribed in [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] settings, these medications are typically made of [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[chemical compound]]s, although some are naturally occurring, or at least naturally derived. Since the mid-20th century, such medications have been leading treatments for a broad range of mental disorders and have decreased the need for long-term hospitalization therefore lowering the cost of mental health care.<ref>T.L. Brink. (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. "Unit 11: Clinical Psychology." pp. 226 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/TLBrink_PSYCH11.pdf]</ref>

== Administration ==
Most psychiatric medications are [[prescription medication]]s, requiring a prescription from a [[physician]], such as a [[psychiatrist]], or a psychiatric nurse practitioner, PMHNP, before they can be obtained. Some [[U.S. states]] and [[U.S. Territories|territories]], following the creation of the [[prescriptive authority for psychologists movement]], have granted prescriptive privileges to [[clinical psychologists]] who have undergone additional specialised education and training in [[medical psychology]].<ref name=Bridget>{{cite web

== Research ==
{{Main|Psychopharmacology}}
Psychopharmacology studies a wide range of substances with various types of psychoactive properties. The professional and commercial fields of [[pharmacology]] and psychopharmacology do not typically focus on [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] or [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]], and so the majority of studies are conducted on psychiatric medication. While studies are conducted on all psychoactive drugs by both fields, psychopharmacology focuses on psychoactive and chemical interactions within the brain. Physicians who research psychiatric medications are [[psychopharmacologist]]s, specialists in the field of psychopharmacology.
Recently there have been more studies into the field of [[psychedelics]]; this is due to the fact that this class of drugs has recently been found, or at least has been admitted, to be beneficial in psychiatry.

== Adverse and withdrawal effects ==
Like any other medication, psychiatric medications have the potential for [[adverse effects]]. Whitfield has referred to psychiatric medications as potential agents of trauma <ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Charles|title=Psychiatric drugs as agents of Trauma|journal=The International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine|year=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=195–207|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> The occurrence of adverse effects can potentially reduce [[Compliance (medicine)|drug compliance]]. Some adverse effects can be [[symptomatic treatment|treated symptomatically]]  by using adjunct medications such as [[anticholinergic]]s (antimuscarinics). Some [[rebound effect|rebound]] or [[withdrawal]] adverse effects, including the possibility of a sudden or severe emergence or re-emergence of psychotic features, may appear when the drugs are discontinued, or discontinued too rapidly.<ref name="Moncrieff">{{cite journal|last=Moncrieff|first=Joanna|date=23 March 2006|title=Does antipsychotic withdrawal provoke psychosis?

==Types==
{{See also|list of psychiatric medications|list of psychiatric medications by condition treated}}
There are six main groups of psychiatric medications.
*[[Antidepressant]]s, which treat disparate disorders such as [[clinical depression]], [[dysthymia]], [[anxiety]], [[eating disorder]]s and [[borderline personality disorder]].<ref>

*[[Stimulant]]s, which treat disorders such as [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[narcolepsy]], and [[anorexia (symptom)|to suppress the appetite]].
*[[Antipsychotic]]s, which treat [[psychotic disorder]]s such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[psychotic]] symptoms occurring in the context of other disorders such as [[mood disorder]]s.
*[[Mood stabilizer]]s, which treat [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizoaffective disorder]].
*[[Anxiolytic]]s, which treat [[anxiety disorder]]s.
*[[Depressant]]s, which are used as [[hypnotic]]s, [[sedative]]s, and [[anesthetic]]s.
[[Hallucinogens]] have been used in psychiatric medication in the past, and are currently being reevaluated for several uses.

===Antipsychotics===
{{Main|Antipsychotics}}
Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat various symptoms of psychosis, such as those caused by psychotic disorders or [[schizophrenia]]. [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s are also used as [[mood stabilizers]] in the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]], and they can augment the action of antidepressants is [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="Stahl">{{cite book|author= Stahl, S. M. | title=Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific basis and practical applications| publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2008}}</ref>
Antipsychotics are sometimes referred to as neuroleptic drugs and some antipsychotics are branded "major tranquilizers".

There are two categories of antipsychotics: [[typical antipsychotic]]s and [[atypical antipsychotic]]s. Most antipsychotics are available only by prescription.

Common antipsychotics:<ref>{{cite web |title=Tardive dyskinesia |url=http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/tardive_dyskinesia.jsp}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2010}}

Typical antipsychotics
*[[Chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine)
*[[Haloperidol]] (Haldol)
*[[Perphenazine]] (Trilafon)
*[[Thioridazine]] (Melleril)
*[[Thiothixene]] (Navane)
*[[Flupenthixol]] (Fluanxol)
*[[Trifluoperazine]] (Stelazine)

Atypical antipsychotics
*[[Aripiprazole]] (Abilify)
*[[Clozapine]] (Clozaril)
*[[Olanzapine]] (Zyprexa)
*[[Paliperidone]] (Invega)
*[[Quetiapine]] (Seroquel)
*[[Risperidone]] (Risperdal)
*[[Zotepine]] (Nipolept)
*[[Ziprasidone]] (Geodon)

===Antidepressants===
{{Main|Antidepressants}}
Antidepressants are drugs used to treat [[clinical depression]], and they are also often used for anxiety and other disorders. Most antidepressants will hinder the breakdown of [[serotonin]] or [[norepinephrine]] or both. A commonly used class of antidepressants are called [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), which act on serotonin transporters in the brain to increase levels of serotonin in the [[synaptic cleft]].<ref name="Stahl"/> SSRIs will often take 3–5 weeks to have a noticeable effect, as the regulation of receptors in the brain adapts. Bi-functional SSRIs are currently being researched, which will occupy the autoreceptors instead of 'throttling' serotonin {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. There are multiple classes of antidepressants which have different mechanisms of action  Another type of antidepressant is a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]], which is thought to block the action of [[Monoamine oxidase]], an enzyme that breaks down serotonin and [[norepinephrine]]. MAOIs are not used as first-line treatment due to the risk of [[hypertensive crisis]] related to the consumption of foods containing the amino acid [[tyramine]].<ref name="Stahl"/>

Common antidepressants:<ref>{{cite web |title=Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors |url=http://www.healthyplace.com/Communities/depression/treatment/antidepressants/maoi.asp}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2010}}

*[[Mirtazapine]] (Remeron), [[NaSSA]]
*[[Isocarboxazid]] (Marplan), MAOI
*[[Phenelzine]] (Nardil), MAOI

===Hallucinogens===
{{main|Hallucinogens}}
Hallucinogens have been used as psychiatric medication in the past, and are currently being reevaluated for several uses. Contrary to their public image, many hallucinogens and [[psychedelics]] have shown potential for curing mental diseases that current medications only temporarily fix {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}.
Hallucinogens used for psychiatric medication include:
*[[LSD]]
*[[Psilocybin]]
*[[Mescaline]]
*[[Ibogaine]]
*[[Cannabis]]
*[[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]

===Mood stabilizers===
{{Main|Mood stabilizers}}
In 1949, the Australian [[John Cade]] discovered that [[lithium pharmacology|lithium salt]]s could control [[mania]], reducing the frequency and severity of manic episodes. This introduced the now popular drug [[lithium carbonate]] to the mainstream public, as well as being the first mood stabilizer to be approved by the U.S. [[Food & Drug Administration]]. 
Besides lithium, several [[anticonvulsants]] and [[atypical antipsychotic]]s have mood stabilizing activity. The mechanism of action of mood stabilizers is not well understood.

Common mood stabilizers:{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*[[Lithium carbonate]] (Carbolith), first and typical mood stabilizer
*[[Carbamazepine]] (Tegretol), anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer
*[[Oxcarbazepine]] (Trileptal), anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer
*[[Valproic acid]], and  Valproic acid salts (Depakine, Depakote), anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer
*[[Lamotrigine]] (Lamictal), atypical anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer
*[[Gabapentin]], atypical [[GABA]]-related anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer
*[[Pregabalin]], atypical GABA-ergic anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer
*[[Topiramate]], [[GABA]]-receptor related anticonvulsant and  mood-stabilizer
*[[Olanzapine]], atypical antipsychotic and mood stabilizer

===Stimulants===
{{Main|Stimulants}}
Stimulants are some of the most widely prescribed drugs today {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. A stimulant is any drug that stimulates the central nervous system. [[Adderall]], a collection of [[amphetamine]] salts, is one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals in the treatment of [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). Stimulants can be addictive, and patients with a history of drug abuse are typically monitored closely or even barred from use and given an alternative. Discontinuing treatment without tapering the dose can cause psychological withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety and drug craving. Many stimulants are not physiologically addictive.

Common stimulants:
*[[Caffeine]], typical methylxanthine stimulant, found in many edibles worldwide
*[[Methylphenidate]] (Ritalin, Concerta), atypical stimulant{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*[[Dexmethylphenidate]] (Focalin), active D-isomer of methylphenidate
*[[Dextroamphetamine]] (Dexedrine), more active amphetamine isomer
*[[Dextroamphetamine]] & [[amphetamine|levoamphetamine]] (Adderall), D,L  -Amphetamine salt mix
*[[Methamphetamine]] (Desoxyn), potent amphetamphetamine-based stimulant
*[[Modafinil]] (Provigil), a stimulant related to sildenafil (Viagra)

===Anxiolytics & hypnotics===
''See also: [[List of benzodiazepines]], [[benzodiazepines]]''

[[Benzodiazepines]] are effective as hypnotics, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, myorelaxants and amnesics, but are generally recommended for short-term use.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=Heather|title=Guidelines for the rational use of benzodiazepines. When and what to use.|journal=Drugs|year=1994|month=July|volume=48|issue=1|pages=25–40|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7525193|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref>  They have widely supplanted [[barbiturates]] because of they have less proclivity for overdose and toxicity. 

Developed in the 1950s onward, they were originally thought to be non-addictive at therapeutic doses.  They are now known to cause [[withdrawal]] symptoms similar to barbiturate and [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacKinnon GL, Parker WA |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome: a literature review and evaluation |journal=Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=19–33 |year=1982 |pmid=6133446 |doi= 10.3109/00952998209002608|url=}}</ref> and a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]] may last for months and years in approximately 15% of users.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=Heather|title=Protracted withdrawal syndromes from benzodiazepines|journal=J Subst Abuse Treat.|year=1991|volume=8|pages=19–28|url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashpws.htm|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> 

Common benzodiazepines and derivatives include:
*[[Diazepam]] (Valium), benzodiazepine derivative, anxiolytic
*[[Nitrazepam]] (Mogadon), benzodiazepine derivative, hypnotic
