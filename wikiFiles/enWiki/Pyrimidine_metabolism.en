'''Pyrimidine biosynthesis''' occurs both in the body and through organic synthesis.

The first three enzymes are all coded by the same gene in [[Metazoa]] ([[CAD (gene)|CAD]]). In [[Fungi]], a similar protein exists but lacks the dihydroorotase function: another protein catalyzes the second step.

In other organisms ([[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]] and the other [[Eukaryota]]), the first three steps are done by three different enzymes.

== Pyrimidine catabolism ==

Pyrimidines are ultimately [[catabolism|catabolized]] (degraded) to [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], [[water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]], and [[urea]]. Cytosine can be broken down to [[uracil]] which can be further broken down to N-carbamoyl-β-alanine. Thymine is broken down into [[β-aminoisobutyrate]] which can be further broken down into intermediates eventually leading into the [[citric acid cycle]]. 

β-aminoisobutyrate acts as a rough indicator for rate of DNA turnover.{PMID    4363656}

==Pharmacotherapy==
Modulating the pyrimidine metabolism pharmacologically has therapeutical uses.

''Pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors'' are used in active moderate to severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[psoriatic arthritis]]. Examples include [[Leflunomide]] and [[Teriflunomide]].
