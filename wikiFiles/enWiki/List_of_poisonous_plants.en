Plants cannot move to escape their predators, so they must have other means of protecting themselves from herbivorous animals. Some plants have physical defenses such as [[Thorns, spines and prickles|thorns]], but by far the most common protection is chemical.<ref>Keddy, P.A. 2007. [http://www.amazon.com/Plants-Vegetation-Origins-Processes-Consequences/dp/0521864801 Plants and Vegetation: Origins, Processes, Consequences]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 666 p. Chapter 7.</ref> Over millennia, [[natural selection]] has produced a complicated and vast array of chemical compounds that deter herbivores. [[Tannin]] is a compound that emerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of plants, while more complex molecules such as [[polyacetylene]]s are found in younger groups of plants such as the [[Asterales]]. Many of the [[Plant defense against herbivory|plant defense compounds]] arose to defend against consumption by insects, although when livestock or humans consume such plants, they may also experience negative effects, ranging from mild discomfort to death.

Many of these poisonous compounds also have important medicinal benefits.<ref>Lewis, W.H. and M.P.F. Elvin-Lewis. 1977. Medical Botany. Plants Affecting Man's Health. Wiley, New Yok. 515 p. p. 123-124.</ref> There are so many kinds of plant defenses that there are many unanswered questions about them. Questions include (1) which plants have which type of defenses, (2) which herbivores are the plants defended against, (3) what are the chemical structures of the compounds that provide defense, (4) and what are the potential medical uses of these compounds? This is still an active area of research with important implications for understanding plant evolution, and for medical research. 

Below is an extensive, if incomplete, list of [[plant]]s containing [[poison]]ous parts that pose a serious risk of [[disease|illness]], injury, or [[death]] to [[human]]s or [[animal]]s.
Human fatalities caused by poisonous plants – especially resulting from accidental ingestion – are rare in the USA.<ref>Krenzelok EP, Mrvos R.,"Friends and foes in the plant world: A profile of plant ingestions and fatalities."  Clin Toxicol (Phila). 2011 Mar;49(3):142-9</ref>

== Poisonous food plants ==
Many food plants possess toxic parts, are toxic unless processed, or are toxic at certain stages of their life. Notable examples include:
* '''[[Apple]]''' (''Malus domestica'').  Seeds are mildly poisonous, containing a small amount of [[amygdalin]], a [[cyanide|cyanogenic]] [[glycoside]]. The quantity contained is usually not enough to be dangerous to humans, but it is possible to ingest enough seeds to provide a fatal dose.
* '''[[Cassava]]''' (''Manihot esculenta'') Roots and leaves contain two [[Cyanogenic glycoside|cyanogenic glucosides]], [[linamarin]] and [[lotaustralin]]. These are decomposed by [[linamarase]], a naturally occurring [[enzyme]] in cassava, liberating [[hydrogen cyanide]] .<ref name="cereda">{{Cite doi|10.1590/S0104-79301996000100002}}</ref>  Cassava varieties are often categorized as either sweet or bitter, respectively signifying the absence or presence of toxic levels of cyanogenic glucosides. The 'sweet' cultivars can produce as little as 20 milligrams of [[cyanide]] per kilogram of fresh roots, whereas bitter ones may produce more than 50 times as much (1 g/kg). Cassavas grown during [[drought]] are especially high in these toxins.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Aregheore E. M, Agunbiade O. O.  | title=The toxic effects of cassava (manihot esculenta grantz) diets on humans: a review. | journal=Vet. Hum.

It can also cause severe calcific pancreatitis in humans, leading to chronic pancreatitis. Processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.) of cassava root is necessary to remove the toxins and avoid getting sick. "Chronic, low-level cyanide exposure is associated with the development of [[goiter]] and with tropical ataxic neuropathy, a nerve-damaging disorder that renders a person unsteady and uncoordinated. Severe cyanide poisoning, particularly during famines, is associated with outbreaks of a debilitating, irreversible paralytic disorder called konzo and, in some cases, death. The incidence of [[konzo]] and tropical ataxic neuropathy can be as high as 3 percent in some areas."<ref>{{cite web

The cyanide is carried away in the processing water and the amounts produced in domestic consumption are too small to have environmental impact.<ref name="cereda"/>  The larger-rooted, bitter varieties used for production of flour or starch must be processed to remove the cyanogenic glucosides.<ref>{{cite pmid | 7576161}}</ref> Industrial production of cassava flour, even at the cottage level, may generate enough cyanide and cyanogenic glycosides in the effluents to have a severe environmental impact.<ref name="cereda"/> 
* '''[[Cherry]]''' (''Prunus cerasus''), as well as other ''Prunus'' species such as [[peach]] (''Prunus persica''), [[plum]] (''Prunus domestica''), [[almond]] (''Prunus dulcis''), and [[apricot]] (''Prunus armeniaca''). Leaves and seeds contain [[cyanogenic glycoside]]s.
* '''[[Lathyrus sativus|Indian pea]]''' (''Lathyrus sativus''). A legume grown in Asia and East Africa as an insurance crop for use during famines. Like other grain legumes, ''L. sativus'' produces a high-protein seed. The seeds contain variable amounts of [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid]] or ODAP, a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] [[amino acid]].<ref>{{cite journal

The disease has been seen to occur after [[famine]]s in Europe (France, Spain, Germany), North Africa and [[South Asia]], and is still prevalent in Eritrea, [[Ethiopia]] and parts of Afghanistan when ''Lathyrus'' seed is the exclusive or main source of nutrients for extended periods. 
* '''[[Common bean#Red or kidney beans|Kidney bean]]''' or '''common bean''' (''Phaseolus vulgaris''). The toxic compound [[phytohaemagglutinin]], a [[lectin]], is present in many varieties of common bean but is especially concentrated in red kidney beans. The lectin has a number of effects on cell metabolism; it induces [[mitosis]], and affects the cell membrane in regard to transport and [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] to proteins. It [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinates]] most mammalian [[red blood cell]] types. The primary symptoms of phytohaemagglutinin poisoning are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Onset is from 1 to 3 hours after consumption of improperly prepared beans, and symptoms typically resolve within a few hours.<ref name=FDA /> Consumption of as few as four or five raw kidney beans may be sufficient to trigger symptoms. Phytohaemagglutinin can be deactivated by cooking beans at {{convert|100|°C|°F}} for ten minutes. However, for dry beans the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) also recommends an initial soak of at least 5 hours in water; the soaking water should be discarded.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|publisher=United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2009-07-11 |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm |title=Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook: Phytohaemagglutinin |work=[[Bad Bug Book]]}}</ref> The ten minutes at {{convert|100|°C|°F}} is required to degrade the toxin, and is much shorter than the hours required to fully cook the beans themselves. However, lower cooking temperatures may have the paradoxical effect of potentiating the toxic effect of haemagglutinin. Beans cooked at {{convert|80|°C|°F}} are reported to be up five times as toxic as raw beans.<ref name=FDA /> Outbreaks of poisoning have been associated with the use of [[slow cooker]]s, the low cooking temperatures of which may be unable to degrade the toxin.
* '''[[Nutmeg]]''' (''[[Myristica]] fragrans''). Contains [[myristicin]].  Myristicin is a naturally occurring [[insecticide]] and [[acaricide]] with possible [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] effects on [[neuroblastoma]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee BK, Kim JH, Jung JW, Choi JW, Han ES, Lee SH, Ko KH, Ryu JH |title=Myristicin-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells |journal=Toxicol.

Users also report bloodshot eyes and memory disturbances.<ref>See [http://www.erowid.org/plants/nutmeg Erowid: Nutmeg] for various primary and secondary sources related to nutmeg/myristicin intoxication.</ref> Myristicin is also known to induce hallucinogenic effects, such as visual distortions. Nutmeg intoxication has an extremely long time before peak is reached, sometimes taking up to seven hours, and effects can be felt for 24 hours, with lingering effects lasting up to 72 hours.<ref>http://www.erowid.org/plants/nutmeg/nutmeg_basics.shtml</ref><ref>http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Nutmeg.shtml</ref>
* '''[[Phaseolus lunatus|Lima bean]]''' or '''butter bean''' (''Phaseolus lunatus''). Raw beans contain dangerous amounts of [[linamarin]], a [[cyanide|cyanogenic]] [[glucoside]].
*'''[[Lupin]]'''. Some varieties have edible seeds. Sweet Lupins have less, and Bitter Lupins have more of the toxic alkaloids [[lupinine]] and [[sparteine]].
* '''[[Allium|Onions and garlic]]'''.  Onions and garlic (genus ''Allium'') contain [[thiosulphate]], which in high doses is toxic to dogs, cats and some other livestock.
* '''[[Potato]]''' (''Solanum tuberosum''). Potatoes contain toxic compounds known as [[glycoalkaloid]]s, of which the most prevalent are [[solanine]] and [[chaconine]]. Solanine is also found in other members of the [[Solanaceae]] plant family, which includes ''Atropa belladonna'' ("deadly nightshade") and ''Hyoscyamus niger'' ("henbane") (see entries below). The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. The toxin affects the nervous system, causing [[headache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and intense digestive disturbances, [[cramps]], weakness and confusion, and in severe cases [[coma]] and death. Poisoning from cultivated potatoes occurs very rarely however, as the toxic compounds in the potato plant are, in general, concentrated in the green portions of the plant and in the fruits,<ref>{{cite web |title=Tomato-like Fruit on Potato Plants |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2004/7-2-2004/tomatopotato.html |accessdate=8 January 2009}}</ref> and cultivated potato varieties contain lower toxin levels.<ref>''Glycoalkaloid and calystegine contents of eight potato cultivars''
[http://grande.nal.usda.gov/ibids/index.php?mode2=detail&origin=ibids_references&therow=728718 J-Agric-Food-Chem. 2003 May 7; 51(10): 2964–73]</ref> Cooking at high temperatures (over 170 °C or 340 °F) also partly destroys the toxin.  However, exposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber,<ref>{{cite web |title=Greening of potatoes |publisher=Food Science Australia |year=2005 |url=http://www.foodscience.afisc.csiro.au/spuds.htm |accessdate=15 November 2008}}</ref> the highest concentrations occurring just underneath the skin. Tubers which are exposed to light turn green from [[chlorophyll]] synthesis, thus giving a visual clue as to areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Some varieties of potato contain greater glycoalkaloid concentrations than others; breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising [[cultivar]]. Breeders try to keep solanine levels below 200&nbsp;mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, when these commercial varieties turn green, even they can approach concentrations of solanine of 1000&nbsp;mg/kg (1000 ppmw). The U.S. National Toxicology Program suggests that the average American consume at most 12.5&nbsp;mg/day of solanine from potatoes (the toxic dose is actually several times this, depending on body weight). Douglas L. Holt, the State Extension Specialist for Food Safety at the [[University of Missouri]], notes that no reported cases of potato-source solanine poisoning have occurred in the U.S. in the last 50&nbsp;years, and most cases involved eating green potatoes or drinking potato-leaf tea.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* '''[[Rhubarb]]''' (''Rheum rhaponticum''). The leaf stalks ([[petiole (botany)|petioles]]) are edible, but the leaves themselves contain notable quantities of [[oxalic acid]], which is a [[nephrotoxic]] and [[corrosive]] acid that is present in many plants. Symptoms of poisoning include kidney disorders, convulsions and coma. Rarely fatal. The {{LD50}} (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375 [[milligram|mg]]/kg [[body weight]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rhurbarb poisoning on rhurbabinfo.com|url=http://www.rhubarbinfo.com/rhubarb-poison.html}}</ref> or about 25 [[gram]]s for a 65&nbsp;kg (~140&nbsp;lb) human. While the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical value is about 0.5%,<ref>GW Pucher, AJ Wakeman, HB Vickery. ''[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/citation/126/1/43 THE ORGANIC ACIDS OF RHUBARB (RHEUM HYBRIDUM). III. THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ORGANIC ACIDS DURING CULTURE OF EXCISED LEAVES]'' Journal of Biological Chemistry, 1938</ref> so a rather unlikely 5&nbsp;kg of the extremely sour leaves would have to be consumed to reach an {{LD50}} of oxalic acid. Cooking the leaves with soda can make them more poisonous by producing soluble [[oxalate]]s.<ref>Everist, Selwyn L., Poisonous Plants of Australia.  Angus and Robertson, Melbourne, 1974, p. 583</ref> However, the leaves are believed to also contain an additional, unidentified toxin,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002876.htm|title=Rhubarb leaves poisoning|work=Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia}}</ref> which might be an [[natural anthraquinone|anthraquinone]] [[glycoside]] (also known as [[senna glycosides]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/pp/ppack.info?p_psn=171&p_type=all&p_sci=sci|title=Canadian Poisonous Plants Information System|publisher=Cbif.gc.ca|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2010-03-05}}</ref> In the edible leaf stalks (petioles), the amount of oxalic acid is much lower, only about 2-2.5% of the total acidity which is dominated by [[malic acid]].<ref>McGee, Harold. On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen.  New York, NY: Scribner, 2004. p. 367</ref> This means that even the raw stalks may not be hazardous (though they are generally thought to be in the US). However the tart taste of raw stalks is so strong as to be unpalatable to many.
* '''[[Tomato]]''' (''Solanum lycopersicum''). Like many other [[nightshade]]s, tomato leaves and stems contain [[solanine]] that is toxic if ingested, causing digestive upset and nervous excitement. Use of tomato leaves as a tea ([[tisane]]) has been responsible for at least one death.<ref name="calimaster">{{Cite book|last=Pittenger |first=Dennis R. |title=California Master Gardener Handbook |chapter=Vegetables That Contain Natural Toxins |chapterurl=http://www.google.com/books?id=WhWjHB1Zjf8C&pg=PA643 |accessdate=2009-07-21 |year=2002 |publisher=ANR Publications |isbn=978-1-879906-54-9 |pages=643–4}}</ref> Leaves, stems, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant also contain small amounts of the poisonous alkaloid [[tomatine]],<ref name="Barceloux">{{Cite journal

== Other poisonous plants ==
* '''''[[Abrus precatorius]]''''' (known commonly as '''jequirity''', '''crab's eye''', '''rosary pea''', ''''''John Crow' '' bead''', '''precatory bean''', '''Indian licorice''', '''akar saga''', '''giddee giddee''', '''[[jumbie]] bead''', '''ruti''', and '''weather plant'''). The attractive seeds (usually about the size of a ladybug, glossy red with one black dot) contain [[abrin]], which is related to [[ricin]], and very potent. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, convulsions, liver failure, and death, usually after several days. Ingesting a single seed can kill an adult human. The seeds have been used as beads in jewelry, which is dangerous; inhaled dust is toxic and pinpricks can be fatal. The seeds are unfortunately attractive to children.
* '''''[[Aconitum]]''''' (Several species, commonly called '''aconite''', '''wolfsbane''' and '''monkshood''') All parts are poisonous. The poison is an alkaloid called [[aconitine]], which disables nerves, lowers blood pressure, and can stop the heart. Even casual skin contact should be avoided; symptoms include numbness, tingling, and cardiac irregularity. It has been used as poison for bullets (by Germany in WWII), as a bait and arrow poison (ancient Greece), and to poison water supplies (reports from ancient Asia). If ingested, it usually causes burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth, followed by vomiting and nervous excitement. It is usually a quick-acting poison. Used in the past for killing wolves (hence one of the common names).
* '''''[[Actaea pachypoda]]''''' (also known as '''doll's eyes''' or '''white baneberry'''). All parts are poisonous, but especially the berries, the consumption of which has a sedative effect on cardiac muscle tissue and can cause cardiac arrest.
* '''Adam and Eve''' – see '''''Arum maculatum'''''.
* '''''[[Adenium obesum]]''''' (also known as '''sabi star''', '''kudu''' or '''desert-rose'''). Exudes a highly toxic sap which is used by the Meridian High and Hadza in Tanzania to coat arrow-tips for hunting.
* '''''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]''''' (commonly known as '''horse-chestnut''').  All parts of the plant are poisonous, causing nausea, muscle twitches, and sometimes paralysis.
* '''African sumac''' – see '''''Rhus lancia'''''.
* '''''[[Agave]]'''''. The juice of a number of species causes acute contact dermatitis, with blistering lasting several weeks and recurring itching for several years thereafter.
* '''''[[Ageratina altissima]]''''' (commonly known as '''white snakeroot'''). All parts are poisonous, causing nausea and vomiting. Often fatal. Milk from cattle that have eaten white snakeroot can sicken, or kill, humans ([[milk sickness]]).
* '''''[[Common Corncockle|Agrostemma githago]]''''' (commonly known as '''corn cockle'''). Contains the saponins githagin and agrostemmic acid. All parts of the plant are reported to be poisonous and may produce chronic or acute, potentially fatal poisoning, although it has been used in folk medicine to treat a range of ills, from parasites to cancer . There are no known recent clinical studies of corn cockle which provide a basis for dosage recommendations, however doses higher than 3 g [of seeds] are considered toxic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/npp/corn-cockle.html |title=Corn Cockle professional information from |publisher=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>

* '''Angel Wings''' – see '''''Caladium'''''.
* '''''Anticlea''''' – see '''Deathcamas'''.
* '''''[[Aquilegia]]''''' (also known as '''columbine'''). Several species. Seeds and roots contain cardiogenic toxins which cause both severe [[gastroenteritis]] and [[heart palpitation]]s if consumed. The flowers of various species were consumed in moderation by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s as a [[condiment]] with other fresh greens, and are reported to be very sweet, and safe if consumed in small quantities. Native Americans also used very small amounts of the root as an effective treatment for [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s. However, the medical use of this plant is difficult due to its high toxicity; columbine poisonings are easily fatal.<ref>{{aut|Tilford, Gregory L.}} (1997): ''Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West''. Mountain Press Pub., Missoula, Montana. ISBN 0-87842-359-1</ref>
* '''''[[Areca catechu]]''''' (commonly known as '''betel nut palm''' and '''pinyang'''). The nut contains an alkaloid related to [[nicotine]] which is addictive. It produces a mild high, some stimulation, and lots of red saliva, which cannot be swallowed as it causes nausea. Withdrawal causes headache and sweats. Use is correlated with mouth cancer, and to a lesser extent asthma and heart disease.
* '''''[[Arum maculatum]]''''' (commonly known as '''cuckoo-pint''', '''lords and ladies''', '''jack in the pulpit''', '''wake robin''', '''wild arum''', '''devils and angels''', '''cows and bulls''', '''Adam and Eve''', '''bobbins''' and '''starch-root'''). All parts of the plant can produce allergic reactions. The bright red berries contain oxalates of [[saponins]] and can cause skin, mouth and throat irritation, resulting in swelling, burning pain, breathing difficulties and stomach upset. One of the most common causes of plant poisoning.

The root, when freshly pulled out of the ground, is extremely poisonous and contains the toxin ''[[cicutoxin]]'', a central nervous system stimulant, resulting in seizures. When dried, the poisonous effect is reduced. The most common species is ''C. maculata''; one of the species found in the Western USA, ''C. douglasii'', often found in pastures and swamps, has especially thick stems and very large and sturdy flowers which are sometimes harvested for flower displays. This is inadvisable as the sap is also toxic.

Colchicine poisoning has been compared to [[arsenic]] poisoning; symptoms start 2 to 5 hours after the toxic dose has been ingested and include burning in the mouth and throat, [[fever]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]] and [[renal failure|kidney failure]]. These symptoms may set in as many as 24 hours after the exposure. Onset of multiple-system organ failure may occur within 24 to 72 hours. This includes [[hypovolemic shock]] due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the [[GI tract]], which may result in death. Additionally, sufferers may experience kidney damage resulting in low urine output and bloody urine; low white blood cell counts (persisting for several days); [[anemia]]; muscular weakness; and [[respiratory failure]]. Recovery may begin within 6 to 8 days.

Horses do not normally eat fresh ragwort due to its bitter taste, however it loses this taste when dried, and become dangerous in hay. The result, if sufficient quantity is consumed, can be irreversible [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucus membranes, depression, and lack of coordination. The danger is that the toxin can have a cumulative effect; the alkaloid does not actually accumulate in the liver but a breakdown product can damage [[DNA]] and progressively kills cells. ''Jacobaea vulgaris'' is also theoretically poisonous to humans, although poisoning is unlikely as it is distasteful and not used as a food. However some sensitive individuals can suffer from an allergic skin reaction after handling the plant because, like many members of the compositae family, it contains sesquiterpine lactones (which are different from the [[pyrrolizidine alkaloids]] which are responsible for the toxic effects), which can cause compositae dermatitis.

* '''''[[Oak|Quercus]]''''' (several species, commonly known as '''oak''')).  The leaves and acorns of oak species are poisonous in large amounts to humans and livestock, including [[cattle]], [[horses]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s, but not [[pig]]s. Poisoning is caused by the toxin [[tannic acid]], which causes [[gastroenteritis]], heart trouble, contact dermatitis and kidney damage. Symptoms of poisoning include [[Anorexia (symptom)|lack of appetite]], depression, constipation, diarrhea (which may contain blood), [[Hematuria|blood in urine]], and [[equine colic|colic]]. Rarely fatal however, and in fact after proper processing acorns are consumed as a staple in many parts of the world.

* '''Redoul''' – see '''''Coriaria myrtifolia'''''.
* '''''[[Azalea|Rhododendron]]''''' (certain species commonly known as '''Azaleas'''). All parts are poisonous and cause nausea, vomiting, depression, breathing difficulties, coma. Rarely fatal.
* '''''[[Rhus]] lancia''''' (commonly known as '''African sumac''').  Closely related to poison ivy, all parts of this tree contain low levels of a highly irritating oil with [[urushiol]]. Skin reactions can include blisters and rashes. It spreads readily to clothes and back again, and has a very long life. Infections can follow scratching. As urushiol is not a poison but an [[allergen]], it will not affect certain people. The smoke of burning ''Rhus lancia'' can cause reactions in the lungs, and can be fatal.
* '''''[[Castor oil plant|Ricinus communis]]''''' (commonly known as '''castor oil plant''' or '''Palma Christi'''). The seeds contain [[ricin]], an extremely toxic water-soluble protein. Also present are ricinine, an alkaloid, and an irritant oil. According to the 2007 edition of the [[Guinness Book of World Records]], this plant is the most poisonous in the world. Castor oil, long used as a laxative, muscle rub, and in cosmetics, is made from the seeds, but the ricin is removed during processing. The lethal dose in adults is considered to be 4 to 8 seeds, but reports of actual poisoning are relatively rare.<ref>Wedin, G.P., Neal, J.S., Everson, G.W., and Krenzelok, E.P. 1986. ''Castor bean poisoning.'' Am J Emerg Med. 4(3): 259-61.

These include a burning sensation in mouth and throat, abdominal pain, purging and bloody diarrhea. Within several days there is severe dehydration, a drop in blood pressure and a decrease in urine. Unless treated, death can be expected to occur within 3–5 days; if victims have not succumbed after this time, they often recover.<ref name="ansci.cornell.edu">Ricinus communis (Castor bean) – [[Cornell University]] 2008. [http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/castorbean.html]</ref> In 1978, ricin was used to assassinate [[Georgi Markov]], a Bulgarian dissident. He was stabbed with the point of an umbrella while waiting at a bus stop near Waterloo Station in London. After his death a perforated metallic pellet was found embedded in his leg; this had presumably contained the ricin toxin.<ref name="ansci.cornell.edu"/> Toxicity varies among animal species: 4 seeds will kill a rabbit, 5 a sheep, 6 an ox or horse, 7 a pig, and 11 a dog. Poisoning occurs when animals ingest broken seeds or break the seed by chewing; intact seeds may pass through the digestive tract without releasing the toxin. Ducks have shown substantial resistance to the seeds: it takes an average of 80 to kill them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.ucc.edu/biology-ombrello/POW/castor_bean.htm |title=Union County College: Biology: Plant of the Week: Castor Bean Plant |publisher=Faculty.ucc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref>

* '''''[[Sambucus]]''''' (commonly known as '''elder''' or '''elderberry''').  The roots are considered poisonous and cause nausea and digestive upset.
* '''''[[Bloodroot|Sanguinaria canadensis]]''''' (commonly known as '''bloodroot'''). The [[rhizome]] contains [[morphine]]-like [[benzylisoquinoline]] [[alkaloid]]s, primarily the toxin [[sanguinarine]].
