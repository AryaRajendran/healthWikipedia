'''Mediastinoscopy''' is a [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] that enables visualization of the contents of the [[mediastinum]], usually for the purpose of obtaining a [[biopsy]].<ref name="Fishman1853">{{Cite book | author=Kaiser LR | title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2008 | page=1853&ndash;1854 | edition=4th | isbn=0-07-145739-9 }}</ref> Mediastinoscopy is often used for staging of [[lymph node]]s of [[lung cancer]] or for diagnosing other conditions affecting structures in the mediastinum such as [[sarcoidosis]] or [[lymphoma]].  

Mediastinoscopy involves making an incision approximately 1&nbsp;cm above the [[suprasternal notch]] of the [[Human sternum|sternum]], or breast bone. Dissection is carried out down to the pretracheal space and down to the [[carina (anatomy)|carina]]. A scope ([[mediastinoscope]]) is then advanced into the created tunnel which provides a view of the mediastinum. The scope may provide direct visualization or may be attached to a video monitor. 

Mediastinoscopy provides access to mediastinal lymph node levels 2, 4, and 7.

==Extended mediastinoscopy==
'''Extended mediastinoscopy''' is a technique which allows access to the pre-aortic (station 6) and [[aortopulmonary window]] (station 5) lymph nodes.

==Parasternal mediastinotomy==
Parasternal mediastinotomy, aka, a Chamberlain procedure, is the standard approach to access lymph nodes at [[lymph node stations|stations 5 and 6]].
