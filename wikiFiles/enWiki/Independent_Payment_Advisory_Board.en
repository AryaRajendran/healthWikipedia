The '''Independent Payment Advisory Board''', or '''IPAB''', is a fifteen-member [[Federal government of the United States|United States Government]] [[Government agency|agency]] created in 2010 by sections 3403 and 10320 of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] which has the explicit task of achieving specified savings in Medicare without affecting coverage or quality.<ref name="AMA">[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/399/hsr-payment-advisory-board.pdf Independent Payment Advisory Board] American Medical Association. Quote|"By Jan 1, 2015, and at least every other year thereafter, the IPAB will submit recommendations to slow the growth in national health care expenditures while preserving or enhancing quality of care."</ref> Under previous and current law, changes to Medicare payment rates and program rules are recommended by [[MedPAC]] but require an act of Congress to take effect.  The new system grants IPAB the authority to make changes to the Medicare program with the Congress being given the power to overrule the agency's decisions through supermajority vote.

Beginning in 2013, the Chief Actuary of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] will determine in particular years the projected per capita growth rate for Medicare for a multi-year period ending in the second year thereafter (the "implementation year"). If the projection exceeds a target growth rate, IPAB must develop a proposal to reduce Medicare spending in the implementation year by a specified amount. If it is required to develop a proposal, the Board must submit that proposal in January of the year before the implementation year; thus, the first proposal could be submitted in January 2014 to take effect in 2015. If the Board fails to submit a proposal that the Chief Actuary certifies will achieve the savings target, the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] must submit a proposal that will achieve that amount of savings.  The Secretary must then implement the proposal unless [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacts resolutions made to override the Board's (or the Secretary's) decisions under a fast-track procedure that the law sets forth.<ref name="AMA"/>

==Background==
IPAB was created as a strengthened version of the [[Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]] (MedPAC), a body with no regulatory power that solely advises Congress, but can not enact regulations in and of itself. Since 1997, MedPAC had recommended cuts totaling "hundreds of billions of dollars" to Medicare that were ignored by Congress.<ref name="Hill2">Mike Lillis.

===Legislative history===
On June 25, 2009, Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]] introduced the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission Reform Act of 2009, which would have changed MedPAC into an executive branch agency.<ref>{{USBill|111|S.|1380}}</ref> On July 17, 2009, the Obama administration submitted to Congress a similar proposal called the Independent Medicare Advisory Council Act, which would have created an independent five-member executive council to make recommendations to the president. From June 17 to September 14, 2009, three Democratic and three Republican [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] members met for a series of thirty one meetings to discuss the development of a health care reform bill. During this period, Senators [[Max Baucus]] (D-Montana), [[Chuck Grassley]] (R-Iowa), [[Kent Conrad]] (D-North Dakota), [[Olympia Snowe]] (R-Maine), [[Jeff Bingaman]] (D-New Mexico), and [[Mike Enzi]] (R-Wyoming), met for more than sixty hours, and their discussions established the principles upon which the health care reform legislation that later passed was based.<ref>{{cite web|title=Health Care Reform from Conception to Final Passage|accessdate=November 23, 2010|url=http://finance.senate.gov/issue/?id=32be19bd-491e-4192-812f-f65215c1ba65}}</ref> The Finance Committee included a provision establishing an independent Medicare advisory board in its health reform legislation,<ref>{{cite news |title=GOP Faces Choice If Health Bill Passes |author=Ronald Brownstein |newspaper=[[National Journal]] |date=November 13, 2009}}</ref> which passed the Senate on December 24, 2009.<ref name="Stockdale">Holly Stockdale.

==Mission==
IPAB is tasked with developing specific proposals to bring the net growth in Medicare spending back to target levels if the Medicare Actuary determines that net spending is forecast to exceed target levels, beginning in 2015.

With regard to IPAB's recommendations, the law says "The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria."<ref>{{USStat|111|490}}; to be codified at {{USC|42|1899A(c)(2)(A)(ii).}}</ref> The [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) must implement these proposals unless Congress adopts equally effective alternatives. The board is also required to submit to Congress annual reports on health care costs, access, quality, and utilization. IPAB must submit to Congress recommendations on how to slow the growth in total private health care expenditures.<ref name="Jost"/>

Every year on September 1, IPAB must submit a draft proposal to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. On January 15 of the next year IPAB must submit a proposal to Congress. If IPAB fails to meet this deadline, the HHS must create its own proposal. Congress must consider this proposal under special rules. Congress cannot consider any amendment to the proposal that does not achieve similar cost reductions unless both houses of Congress, including a three-fifths super majority in the Senate, vote to waive this requirement. If Congress fails to adopt a substitute provision by August 15, HHS must implement the proposal as originally submitted to Congress.<ref name="Jost"/>

==Predicted outcomes==

A 2009 ''[[Kaiser Health News]]'' article predicted [[primary care doctor]]s would likely see benefits from an "independent Medicare commission because the panel would be more likely to increase their fees and lower specialists' rates".<ref>{{cite news |title=Most health industry players would win under overhaul |author=Phil Galewitz |newspaper=[[Kaiser Health News]] |publisher=[[McClatchy Washington DC News Bureau]] |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/08/16/73802/most-health-industry-players-would.html |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> While payment cuts to hospitals and hospices are off-limits until 2020, and clinical laboratories are off limits until 2016, physician fees may be cut unless a [[doc fix]] to Medicare's sustainable growth rate formula makes those cuts off limits.<ref name="Aaron"/> Other "savings would have to be found in private [[Medicare Advantage]] plans, Medicare’s Part D prescription-drug program, or spending on skilled-nursing facilities, home-based health care, [[dialysis]], durable medical equipment, ambulance services, and services of ambulatory surgical centers".<ref name="Aaron"/> According to the New England Journal of Medicine, holding off creation of [[accountable care organization]]s (ACOs) is likely to be a bad long term strategy for physicians.<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1011712</ref>

Critics of IPAB have charged that the board's cost-cutting mandate will inevitably bring about a reduction in care, despite the anti-rationing language in the bill. Congressman [[Phil Roe]] from Tennessee, a medical doctor, warned that IPAB will ration care through payment policy. [[American Medical News]] charged that the bill gives IPAB "unprecedented, dangerous authority to cut Medicare pay rates and strangle access to care."<ref>Fiegl, Charles, [http://www.amednews.com/article/20121015/government/310159952/4/ "Medicare IPAB: Rational or rationing?"], ''American Medical News'', October 15, 2012</ref> IPAB has frequently been denounced by its critics as a [[Death panel]].<ref>Cliff, Sarah, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/28/who-wants-to-sit-in-the-hot-seat-on-a-federal-health-care-panel/ "Who wants to be a 'Death Panelist'?"], ''Washington Post'', January 28, 2013</ref><ref>Roy, Avik, [http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/256127/epistemology-death-panels-avik-roy The Epistemology of Death Panels], ''National Review'', December 31, 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Burke J.

{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
Health economist [[Uwe Reinhardt]] thinks that given the "dubious style of [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign financing]] of which we all are victims now", an independent Medicare commission is the U.S.'s only hope to restrain Medicare spending.<ref name="Helping">{{cite news |title=Helping Or Hurting Medicare? |author=Marilyn Werber Serafini |newspaper=[[National Journal]] |date=December 21, 2009 |url=http://healthcare.nationaljournal.com/2009/12/helping-or-hurting-medicare.php#1402314 |accessdate=July 31, 2011}}</ref> Reinhardt criticized former chairman of the [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health|House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health]] William Thomas' 1995 comment as emblematic of the spurious reasoning found in Congress. Of a payment system that resembled [[bundled payment]], Thomas said, "I'm not wild about a payment system that involves telling a bunch of innovative entrepreneurs that they can’t be in the business anymore". Reinhardt criticized this, saying Thomas "seemed uninterested in what made more clinical and economic sense. His was purely an [[industrial policy]], not a health policy. And his reasoning explains why, year in year out, Congress has rejected economically sensible proposals to attain greater efficiency in the Medicare program."<ref name="Helping"/> Reinhardt compares the IPAB to a similar board in Germany, which he says is efficient, effective and civilized.<ref name="Brickbats">{{cite news |title=Medicare Payment Board Draws Brickbats |author=Julie Rovner |newspaper=[[Morning Edition]] |date=July 12, 2011 |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/07/12/137774959/medicare-payment-board-draws-brickbats |accessdate=July 31, 2011}}</ref>

[[Douglas Holtz-Eakin]], a former CBO director and an economist who is currently president of [[American Action Network|a conservative political organization]], thinks that despite "requirements that would force Congress to adopt the recommendations or find comparable savings", "cuts will be politically infeasible, as Congress is likely to continue regularly to override scheduled reductions".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holtz-Eakin D, Ramlet MJ |title=Analysis & commentary.

Dr. J.

In an editorial opposing Sen. Cornyn's bill to repeal IPAB the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote, "The political system failed when it came to controlling health-care costs.

Congress isn't bound by its proposals if lawmakers can come up with what they think is a better approach.
