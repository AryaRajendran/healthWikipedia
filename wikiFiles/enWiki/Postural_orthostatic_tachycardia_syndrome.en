'''Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome''' ('''POTS''', also '''postural tachycardia syndrome''') is a condition of [[dysautonomia]],<ref>[http://www.dinet.org/ Dysautonomia Information Network]{{Unreliable medical source|date=January 2012}}</ref>  to be more specific [[orthostatic intolerance]], in which a change from the [[supine position]] to an upright position causes an abnormally large increase in [[heart rate]], called [[tachycardia]]. Several studies show a decrease in cerebral blood flow with systolic and diastolic [[cerebral blood flow]] (CBF) velocity decreased 44% and 60%, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/europace/eul001 |title=Cerebrovascular blood flow during the near syncopal phase of head-up tilt test: A comparative study in different types of neurally mediated syncope |year=2006 |last1=Hermosillo |first1=A.

Many also experience symptoms when stationary or even while lying down. 

Symptoms present in various degrees of severity depending on the individual.  POTS can be severely debilitating. Some afflicted individuals are unable to attend school or work and for especially severe cases, they are completely incapacitated.

==Symptoms==
The hallmark symptom of POTS is an increase in heart rate from the supine to upright position of more than 30 beats per minute or to a heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute within 12 minutes of head-up tilt.
 
This tachycardic response is sometimes accompanied by a decrease in blood flow to the brain and a wide variety of symptoms associated with cerebral hypoperfusion. Decreased cerebral perfusion may promote the following:<ref>http://www.dinet.org/symptoms.htm{{Unreliable medical source|date=January 2012}}</ref>

*[[lightheadedness]], sometimes called pre-syncope (pre-fainting) [[dizziness]] (but not [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], which is also called dizziness)<ref>Grubb, B. P. (2000, July). Orthostatic intolerance. National Dysautonomia Research Foundation Patient Conference. Minneapolis, Minnesota.{{Verify source|can't find this source|date=January 2012}}</ref>
*exercise intolerance
*extreme [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]
*[[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting)
*Excessive thirst ([[polydipsia]])

Chronic or acute hypoperfusion of tissues and organs in the upper parts of the body are thought to cause the following symptoms:

*cold extremities
*[[chest pain]] and discomfort
*[[disorientation]]
*[[syncope]]
*[[ventricular fibrillation]]
*[[myocardial infarction]]
*[[hypertension]]
*[[hypotension]]
*[[tinnitus]]
*[[dyspnea]]
*[[headache]]
*[[muscle weakness]]
*[[fibromyalgia]]
*tremulousness
*visual disturbances

[[dysautonomia|Autonomic dysfunction]] is thought to cause additional gastrointestinal symptoms:
*[[abdominal pain]] or discomfort
*[[bloating]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-8159.1997.tb04238.x |title=The Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome: A Neurocardiogenic Variant Identified During Head-Up Tilt Table Testing |year=1997 |last1=Grubb |first1=Blair P. |last2=Kosinski |first2=Daniel J. |last3=Boehm |first3=Kathy |last4=Kip |first4=Katrinka |journal=Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=2205–12 |pmid=9309745}}</ref>
*[[constipation]]
*[[diarrhea]]

Inappropriate levels of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] lead to anxiety-like symptoms:
*[[chills]]
*feelings of fear
*[[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]]
*[[hyperthermia|overheating]]

*over-stimulation

Symptoms of POTS overlap considerably with those of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], and a misdiagnosis of an anxiety disorder is not uncommon.

===Associated conditions===
*Many people affected with POTS exhibit comorbid [[small fiber peripheral neuropathy]] - both autonomic and in some cases sensory.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20035362</ref> 
*POTS is often accompanied by [[vasovagal syncope]], also called "neurally mediated hypotension" (NMH) or "neurocardiogenic syncope" (NCS). Vasovagal syncope is a fainting reflex due to a profound drop in blood pressure. Autonomic dysfunction that occurs with these disorders causes blood to inappropriately pool in the limbs away from the heart, lungs, and brain. The combination of misdirected bloodflow and hypotension will invoke syncope. Tachycardia associated with POTS may be a cardiac response to restore cerebral perfusion. However, a characteristic of POTS is normotension or even hypertension when presyncope or syncope is experienced, suggesting cerebral vasospasm or autoregulatory failure may account for syncope. 
*POTS may coexist with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] as one of the CFS symptoms as part of the [[orthostatic intolerance]] of this condition. Treating POTS may improve some of the patients CFS symptoms.
*Autonomic dysfunction is most likely responsible for [[irritable bowel syndrome]] in many patients as well.
*Patients with [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]] may also have POTS.  Joint [[hypermobility]] is a feature of the most common subtype of Ehlers-Danlos.
*Some people experience symptoms associated with [[restless leg syndrome]]. Treating POTS should also relieve these symptoms.
*A small percentage of pediatric cases of POTS have been associated with moderate to severe [[memory loss]].<ref>"Migraines, memory loss: Was it all in his head?" http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/12/AR2010021204444.html?hpid=artslot</ref>

==Causes==
The primary causal mechanisms in POTS remain unclear and are likely heterogeneous. Some people develop symptoms in their teenage years during a period of rapid growth and see gradual improvement into their mid-twenties. Others develop POTS after a viral or bacterial infection such as [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]] or [[pneumonia]] while others develop symptoms after experiencing some sort of trauma such as a car accident or injury. Women can also develop POTS during or after [[pregnancy]]. 

In one large test, 12.5% of 152 people with POTS reported a family history of orthostatic intolerance, suggesting that there is a genetic inheritance associated with POTS.<ref name=pmid17352367>{{cite journal |doi=10.4065/82.3.308 |title=Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome: The Mayo Clinic Experience |year=2007 |last1=Thieben |first1=Mark J. |last2=Sandroni |first2=Paola |last3=Sletten |first3=David M. |last4=Benrud-Larson |first4=Lisa M. |last5=Fealey |first5=Robert D. |last6=Vernino |first6=Steven |last7=Low |first7=Phillip A. |last8=Lennon |first8=Vanda A. |last9=Shen |first9=Win-Kuang |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=308–13 |pmid=17352367}}</ref>

While the primary causal mechanisms remain unclear, a number of theories have been offered based on preliminary research findings:

*Abnormal distal sudomotor findings are frequently reported suggesting patchy small fiber neuropathy in a large subset of POTS patients. The finding of abnormal quantitive sudomotor axon test results or skin biospies in this subset have been interpreted as supporting an autonomic neuropathic process.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/><ref>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10286-009-0045-y#page-1</ref><ref>http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/80/1_MeetingAbstracts/S37.005</ref> [[Small fiber peripheral neuropathy]] may be associated with autoimmune illnesses, exposure to toxins, certain medications, and in many cases are considered idiopathic.<ref>http://www.ccjm.org/content/76/5/297.full</ref>

*An autoimmune process has been suggested as a causal mechanism for some POTS patients, supported by the finding of autoantibodies against ganglionic alpha 3 acetylcholine receptors.<ref name=pmid17352367/> Anecdotally it has been suggested that POTS patients exhibit a higher incidence of comorbid autoimmune diseases than the general population and frequently report a family history of [[autoimmunity]] or [[migraine]]. More recently, alternative autoantibodies in POTS have been identified.<ref>http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/33/03_MeetingAbstracts/OR48-1</ref><ref>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prca.201200049/abstract</ref>

*Low blood volume or hypovolumia is a frequent finding in POTS, often coupled with an abnormal renin-aldosterone response to this volume deficit.<ref name=pmid15781744>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000160356.97313.5D |title=Renin-Aldosterone Paradox and Perturbed Blood Volume Regulation Underlying Postural Tachycardia Syndrome |year=2005 |last1=Raj |first1=S.

*Recent studies have described a subset of POTS patients with elevated [[angiotensin II]] levels coupled with paradoxically reduced absolute blood volume, signs of increased sympathetic activity and reduced peripheral blood flow. This subset appears to have abnormal [[catabolism]] of [[Angiotensin II]] that may contribute to reduced blood volume and orthostatic intolerance.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/CS20050254 |title=Increased plasma angiotensin II in postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is related to reduced blood flow and blood volume |year=2006 |last1=Glover |first1=June L. |last2=Stewart |first2=Julian M. |last3=Medow |first3=Marvin S. |journal=Clinical Science |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=255–63 |pmid=16262605}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.11.009 |title=Abnormalities of angiotensin regulation in postural tachycardia syndrome |year=2011 |last1=Mustafa |first1=Hossam I. |last2=Garland |first2=Emily M. |last3=Biaggioni |first3=Italo |last4=Black |first4=Bonnie K. |last5=Dupont |first5=William D. |last6=Robertson |first6=David |last7=Raj |first7=Satish R. |journal=Heart Rhythm |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=422–8 |pmid=21266211 |pmc=3050076}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.127357 |title=Defects in Cutaneous Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 and Angiotensin-(1-7) Production in Postural Tachycardia Syndrome |year=2009 |last1=Stewart |first1=J.

*Reduced venous return is one of the main mechanisms that cause POTS symptoms. Venous return can be reduced due to conditions such as [[hypovolemia]] (low plasma volume/low blood volume), venous pooling, and [[denervation]]. A hyperadrenergic state may result as the body attempts to compensate for these abnormalities.

*Abnormalities in [[cerebral autoregulation]] are a consistent findings in POTS.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724195/</ref><ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22180650</ref>

*Expression of [[Norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) protein appears to be reduced in some POTS patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/CIRCEP.107.750471 |title=Altered Sympathetic Nervous Reactivity and Norepinephrine Transporter Expression in Patients with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome |year=2008 |last1=Lambert |first1=E. |last2=Eikelis |first2=N. |last3=Esler |first3=M. |last4=Dawood |first4=T. |last5=Schlaich |first5=M. |last6=Bayles |first6=R. |last7=Socratous |first7=F. |last8=Agrotis |first8=A. |last9=Jennings |first9=G. |journal=Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=103}}</ref> Cardiac neurotransmission imaging of norepinephrine reuptake measured utilising MIBG has also been found to be abnormal in some POTS patients, suggesting cardiac denervation or NET deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2008.168484 |title=Cardiac neurotransmission imaging with 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine in postural tachycardia syndrome |year=2009 |last1=Haensch |first1=C.-A. |last2=Lerch |first2=H. |last3=Schlemmer |first3=H. |last4=Jigalin |first4=A. |last5=Isenmann |first5=S. |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=339}}</ref>

*Recently, an [[epigenetic]] mechanism (chromatin remodelling and gene supression of the norepinephrine transporter gene) that results in reduced expression of the [[norepinephrine transporter]] and consequently a phenotype of impaired neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine has been implicated in the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22723437</ref>

*[[Deconditioning]] either as a primary pathophysiology or an epimechanism have been suggested based on the frequent finding of low [[stroke volume]] and blood volume in POTS patients.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20579544</ref> However, norepinephrine transporter inhibition may create a phenotype with similarities to this finding.<ref>http://jap.physiology.org/content/104/3/756</ref>

*Levels or activation of endothelial vasodilating molecules such as [[nitric oxide]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]] may be increased in some POTS patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00171.2011 |title=Cutaneous constitutive nitric oxide synthase activation in postural tachycardia syndrome with splanchnic hyperemia |year=2011 |last1=Stewart |first1=J.

*"Hyperadrenergic" POTS has been associated with [[Mast Cell Disorders]] in some patients.<ref>http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/45/3/385.full</ref>

*POTS may also appear as a secondary manifestation of systemic autoimmune diseases such as [[Multiple Sclerosis]],<ref>http://www.medsci.org/v07p0062.htm</ref> [[Sjogrens Syndrome]],<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/522421_3</ref> [[Rheumatoid Arthritis]] and [[Lupus]].

==Diagnosis==
POTS can be difficult to diagnose. A routine physical examination and standard blood tests will not indicate POTS. A [[tilt table test]] is vital to diagnosing POTS, although all symptoms must be considered before a final diagnosis is made. Tests to rule out [[Addison's Disease]], [[pheochromocytoma]], electrolyte imbalance, [[Lyme Disease]], [[Celiac Disease]], and various food allergies are usually performed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} A blood test may be performed to verify abnormally high levels of [[norepinephrine]] present in some POTS patients.

Between 75 and 80 percent of POTS patients are female and of the [[menstruating]] age. Some women also develop POTS symptoms during or after [[pregnancy]].

==Prognosis==
Many POTS patients will see symptom improvement over the course of several years. Those who develop POTS in their early to mid teens during a period of rapid growth will most likely see complete symptom resolution in two to five years.<ref>

Adults who develop POTS, especially women during or after pregnancy, usually see milder improvement and can be plagued with their condition for life{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. Rarely, a teenager who develops POTS will gradually worsen over time and have lifelong symptoms. Patients with secondary POTS as a consequence of [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]] will also usually struggle with symptoms for life.

Many adult patients report a relapsing/remitting course characterised by periods of partial remission and occasional 'flare-ups' or exacerbations. 

Recovered individuals do complain of occasional, non-debilitating recurrence of symptoms associated with autonomic dysfunction including dizzy spells, lightheadedness, flushing, and transient syncope, as well as symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.   These symptoms are consistent with B12 deficiency in absence of anemia, which should always be ruled out directly by checking B12, homocysteine and methylmalonic acid.<ref name=pmid12643357>{{cite journal |first1=Robert C. |last1=Oh |first2=David L. |last2=Brown |title=Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Deficiency |journal=American Family Physician |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=12643357 |pmid=12643357 |year=2003 |volume=67 |issue=5 |pages=979–86}}</ref>

==Treatment==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
Most patients will respond to some form of treatment.  Lifestyle changes, in particular drinking extra water and avoiding trigger situations such as standing still or getting hot are necessary for all patients.  Some patients also benefit from the addition of other treatments, such as certain medications.

===Dietary changes===
* Drinking more water improves symptoms for nearly all patients.  Most patients are encouraged to drink at least 64 ounces (two liters) of water or other hydrating fluids each day.
* [[Alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]] has been shown to drastically exacerbate all types of [[orthostatic intolerance]] due to its [[vasodilation]] and [[dehydration]] properties. In addition to its adverse effects, it interacts unfavorably with many of the medications prescribed for POTS patients.
* Eating frequent, small meals can reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with POTS by requiring the diversion of less blood to the abdomen.
* Increasing salt intake, by adding salt to food, taking salt tablets, or drinking sports drinks  and other electrolyte solutions (most doctors recommend drinking [[Gatorade]] or [[Pedialyte]], or Nuun active hydration tablets), is a treatment used for many people with POTS; however, salt is not recommended for all patients. Increasing salt is an effective way to raise blood pressure in many patients with [[orthostatic hypotension]] by helping the body retain water and thereby expanding blood volume.  Different physicians recommend different amounts of sodium to their patients.<ref name=Low00/><ref name=Grubb06>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-8167.2005.00318.x |title=The Postural Tachycardia Syndrome: A Concise Guide to Diagnosis and Management |year=2005 |last1=Grubb |first1=Blair P. |last2=Kanjwal |first2=Yousuf |last3=Kosinski |first3=Daniel J. |journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology |pages=051123074027005}}</ref>
* Diets high in [[carbohydrates]] have been connected to impaired vasoconstrictive action. Eating foods with lower carbohydrate levels can mildly improve POTS symptoms.
* Some patients report an improvement in symptoms after switching to a strict [[gluten-free diet]], even if they have tested negative for [[Celiac Disease]].
* [[Caffeine]] helps some POTS patients due to its stimulative effects; however, other patients report a worsening of symptoms with caffeine intake.

===Physical therapy and exercise===
Exercise is very important for maintaining muscle strength and avoiding [[deconditioning]]. Though many POTS patients report difficulty exercising, some form of exercise is essential to controlling symptoms and, eventually, improving the condition. Exercises that improve leg and abdominal strength  may aid in improving the muscle pump and, therefore, preventing pooling of blood in the abdomen and lower extremities. 

[[Aerobic exercise]] performed for 20 minutes a day, three times a week, is sometimes recommended for patients that can tolerate it.<ref name=Grubb06/> Certain modalities of exercise may be more tolerable initially, such as riding a [[recumbent bicycle]] or swimming. However, as tolerable, upright exercise may benefit the participant through orthostatic training. All exercise programs for POTS patients should begin with low-intensity exercises for a short duration and progress slowly.

===Medications===

Several classes of drugs often provide symptom control and relief for POTS patients. Treatments must be carefully tested due to medication sensitivity often associated with POTS patients, and each patient will respond to different therapies in different ways. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The first drug of choice for symptomatic relief of POTS is usually [[fludrocortisone]], or Florinef, a [[mineralcorticoid]] used to increase sodium retention and thus increase blood volume and blood pressure. An increase in sodium and water intake must coincide with fludrocortisone therapy for effective treatment. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Dietary increases in sodium and sodium supplements are often used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Image:Propranolol 80mg.png|thumb|right|An 80&nbsp;mg capsule of Propranolol.]]
[[Beta blockers]] such as [[atenolol]], [[metoprolol]] and [[propanolol]] are often prescribed to treat POTS. These medications slow down the excessive heart rate response (tachycardia) that POTS patients experience. They also work by blocking the effects of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] released by the Autonomic Nervous System. In addition, beta blockers reduce Sympathetic Nervous System activity by blocking Sympathetic impulses.  For some patients, Beta blockers increase POTS symptoms (e.g., lowering blood pressure, increasing fatigue, which is why they are often prescribed in conjunction with [[Midodrine]]). Beta blockers may be dangerous to individuals with asthma or allergies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Midodrine]] (Proamatine), is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to treat [[orthostatic hypotension]], a condition related to POTS.  It is a stimulant that causes [[vasoconstriction]] and thereby increases [[blood pressure]] and allows more blood to return to the upper parts of the body. Use of midodrine is often discontinued due to intolerable side-effects, and it is known to cause supine hypertension (high blood pressure when lying down). Some doctors prefer to start patients on [[Midodrine]] without the concomitant use of [[Beta blockers]] and then add [[Beta blockers]] once the dose of [[Midodrine]] has been properly adjusted. This gives the [[Midodrine]] time to start raising the patient's blood pressure which often helps avoid the hypotension that is a common side effect of [[Beta blockers]]. Obviously lowering the blood pressure of a POTS patient would exacerbate any existing [[orthostatic hypotension]] or worsen orthostatic intolerance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Antidepressants, especially [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) such as [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), [[citalopram]] (Celexa), [[escitalopram]] (Lexapro), and [[paroxetine]] (Paxil), can be extremely effective in re-regulating the autonomic nervous system and raising blood pressure. Some studies indicate that [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) such as [[venlafaxine]] (Effexor) and [[duloxetine]] (Cymbalta) are even more effective. [[Tricyclic antidepressants]], [[tetracyclic antidepressants]], and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] are also occasionally, but rarely, prescribed. A combination of two antidepressants, usually an SSRI or SNRI with [[bupropion]] (Wellbutrin) or [[mirtazapine]] (Remeron), is also shown to be very effective.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Medications used to treat [[attention deficit disorder]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] such as [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin) and [[Adderall]] effectively increase norepinehprine and dopamine levels, thereby increasing vasoconstriction and blood pressure. 

In some cases, when increasing oral fluids and salt intake is not enough, intravenous saline is used to help increase blood volume, as many POTS patients suffer from hypovolemia.<ref name=pmid15781744/><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16943900 |year=2006 |last1=Raj |first1=SR |title=The Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): Pathophysiology, diagnosis & management |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=84–99 |pmc=1501099 |journal=Indian pacing and electrophysiology journal}}</ref> Increasing blood volume can decrease POTS symptoms caused or worsened by low blood volume such as tachycardia, low blood pressure, fatigue, and syncope.  Infusions can be taken on an as-needed basis in an Emergency Room, or on a regularly scheduled manner at an infusion center or at home with the assistance of a home-care nurse. Many patients report a profound though short-lived improvement in their symptoms from saline infusions. 

In the [[UK]], [[Ivabradine]] has been used to treat patients with POTS symptoms with good effect.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1874192401004010166 |title=Potentially New Indication of Ivabradine: Treatment of a Patient with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome |year=2010 |last1=Hersi |first1=Ahmad |journal=The Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal |volume=4 |pages=166–7 |pmid=21127745 |pmc=2995161}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/europace/euq390 |title=Single centre experience of ivabradine in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome |year=2010 |last1=McDonald |first1=C. |last2=Frith |first2=J. |last3=Newton |first3=J. L. |journal=Europace |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=427–30 |pmid=21062792 |pmc=3043639}}</ref> Ivabradine acts by reducing the [[heart rate]] in a mechanism different from that of [[beta blocker]]s and [[calcium channel blocker]]s, two commonly prescribed [[antianginal]] drugs. It is classified as a ''cardiotonic agent''.

*Anti-anxiety medications, such as [[alprazolam]] (Xanax), [[lorazepam]] (Ativan), and [[clonazepam]] (Klonopin), can be used to combat imbalances of [[adrenaline]] usually seen with POTS patients.
*[[Clonidine]] can be helpful in patients with excessive sympathetic activity. Clonidine lowers catecholamine(epinephrine and norepinephrine) production. 
*[[Disopyramide]] (Norpace) is an antiarrhythmic medication that inhibits the release of [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].
*[[Erythropoietin]], used to treat anemia via [[intravenous infusion]], is very effective at increasing blood volume. It is seldom used, however, due to the dangers of increasing the [[hematocrit]], the inconvenience of intravenous infusion, and its prohibitively expensive cost.
*[[Pregabalin]] (Lyrica), an [[anticonvulsant]] drug, has been shown to be especially effective in treating [[neuropathic pain]] associated with POTS. In fact, Lyrica was the first and, for its first year on the market, the only prescription drug approved by the FDA to treat [[fibromyalgia]]. Some POTS patients also report improvement in concentration and energy while on Lyrica.
*[[Pseudoephedrine]] and [[Phenylephrine]], over-the-counter [[decongestants]], increase [[vasoconstriction]]. [[Pseudoephedrine]] promotes the release of norepinephrine at the sympathetic synapse, allowing non selective agonism of alpha 1 and 2 constrictor adreno-receptors; [[Phenylephrine]] is a selective alpha 1 receptor agonist with a similar mode of action to [[Midodrine]].
*[[Pyridostigmine]] (Mestinon), inhibits the breakdown of [[acetylcholine]], promoting autonomic nervous system activity. It is especially effective in increasing both parasympathetic and sympathetic activity.
*[[Theophylline]], a drug used to treat respiratory diseases such as [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] and [[asthma]], is occasionally prescribed at low doses for POTS patients. Theophylline increases cardiac output, increases blood pressure, and stimulates [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] production. Due to its very narrow [[therapeutic index]], Theophylline is known to cause a wide variety of side-effects and even [[toxicity]].
*Women who report a worsening of symptoms during [[menstruation]] will often use combined (containing both estrogen and progestin) forms of [[hormonal contraception]] to prevent hormonal changes and an aggravation of their condition.
*[[IVIG]] (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) infusions may be helpful for patients whose POTS is caused by autonomic neuropathy associated with [[Guillain Barre Syndrome]], [[Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy]] (CIDP), [[Sjogren's Syndrome]] or other autoimmune diseases. More recently, immunosuppressive treatment has show utility in syndromes of orthostatic tolerance that are presumed autoimmune in etiology even where pathological autoantibodies can not be identified.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837591/</ref>
*[[Dihydroergotamine]] or DHE may be useful in some patients as a selective venoconstrictor through serotoninic receptor agonism.
*[[Piracetam]] may improve cerebral blood flow in POTS according to one study.<ref name="jms.ndmctsgh.edu.tw"/>

Trials are planned for other novel potential therapies for POTS.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22678960</ref>

Patients whose POTS symptoms are due to B12 deficiency need pharmacological doses of B12 for repletion of tissues.<ref name=pmid12643357/>

Recently it has become a popular belief that medical [[marijuana]] may have positive effects on POTS patients. However, there is little evidence supporting its efficacy, and the active constituents of marijuana are often associated with postural hypotension.

There are anecdotal reports of benefit being derived from [[Horse Chestnut]] seed extract (Aescin), [[Rehmannia glutinosa]], [[Licorice]] root, [[Eucommia ulmoides]], [[Diosmin]] and [[Ruscus aculeatus]] (Butcher Broom)<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11152059</ref> however there is currently no research to support the efficacy of these herbal remedies that is specific to POTS.

===External body pressure===
Pressure garments can reduce symptoms associated with [[orthostatic intolerance]] by constricting blood pressures with external body pressure. 

Compression devices, such as abdominal binders and compression stockings, help to reduce the amount of pooling blood. Compression stockings should be at least 30–40&nbsp;mm Hg and will work best if they are waist-high.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-8159.1999.tb00546.x |title=Clinical Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System Associated with Orthostatic Intolerance: An Overview of Classification, Clinical Evaluation, and Management |year=1999 |last1=Grubb |first1=Blair P. |last2=Karas |first2=Barry |journal=Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=798–810 |pmid=10353141}}</ref> Compression stockings should be fitted to achieve the greatest benefit.  If the patient finds compression stockings of 30-40 mmHg to be too uncomfortable, consider a lesser compression such as 20-30 mmHg.  Many patients see improvement with that level of compression, with full-length/waist-high stockings.

Compressions suits ([[G-suit|G-Suits]]) have also been used with some good results.<ref>http://www.oiresource.com/index.htm{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>http://www.oiresource.com/pdf/mstudy.pdf{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref>

===Changes in environment===
Some patients report that symptoms worsen with changes in barometric pressure (for instance, before a thunderstorm) and changes from outdoors to indoors (it is presumed that barometric pressure is higher inside) and depending on weight of clothes and coverage. These patients may find relief by moving to a new location where barometric pressure is relatively stable, e.g. [[San Diego]].<ref>http://emma-stronger.blogspot.com/2009/12/san-diego-day-5.html{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>http://dinet.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=12201&st=0{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref><ref>http://www.12morepages.com/blog/?p=140{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref>

==History==
POTS was first named and identified by Schondorf and Low in 1993;<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8423877 |year=1993 |last1=Schondorf |first1=R |last2=Low |first2=PA |title=Idiopathic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: An attenuated form of acute pandysautonomia? |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=132–7 |journal=Neurology |doi=10.1212/WNL.43.1_Part_1.132}}</ref> however, the syndrome has been described in medical studies dating back to at least 1940. Hypertension associated with POTS has been previously described as the "hyperadrenergic syndrome" by Streeten{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and as "idiopathic hypovolemia" by Fouad.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3511818 |year=1986 |last1=Fouad |first1=FM |last2=Tadena-Thome |first2=L |last3=Bravo |first3=EL |last4=Tarazi |first4=RC |title=Idiopathic hypovolemia |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=298–303 |journal=Annals of internal medicine}}</ref> Hypotension associated with POTS has been previously described as the "neurally mediated hypotension" form of POTS.
