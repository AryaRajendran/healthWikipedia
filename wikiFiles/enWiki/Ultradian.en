'''Ultradian''' rhythms are recurrent periods or cycles repeated throughout a 24-hour [[circadian rhythm|circadian]] day. In contrast, [[infradian rhythm]]s, such as the human [[menstrual cycle]], have periods longer than a day. 

The descriptive term ultradian is used in [[sleep]] research in reference to the 90–120 minute cycling of the sleep stages during human sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hobson JA, Pace-Schott EF |title=The cognitive neuroscience of sleep: neuronal systems, consciousness and learning |journal=Nat. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=679–93 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12209117 |doi=10.1038/nrn91510.1038/nrn915 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v3/n9/full/nrn915.html}}</ref>

Some of the other ultradian cyclings of the body are [[blood circulation]], [[blinking]], [[pulse]], [[hormonal]] release, [[heart rate]], [[thermoregulation]], [[urination]], [[bowel]] activity, [[nasal cycle|nostril dilation]] and [[appetite]]. The last involves rhythmic release of [[Neuropeptide Y]] (NPY) and [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), stimulating and inhibiting appetite ultradian rhythms.

''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' is often used as a model animal for ultradian rhythm. Defecation in ''C. elegans'' is a tightly controlled rhythmic process. Posterior body wall muscle contractions in ''C. elegans'' occur rhythmically every 45–50 seconds and mediate defecation. 

Ultradian mood states in [[bipolar disorder]] cycle much faster than [[Bipolar disorder#Rapid cycling|rapid cycling]]; the latter is defined as four or more mood episodes in one year, sometimes occurring within a few weeks.{{ref|reference_name_A|a}} Ultradian mood cycling is characterized by cycles shorter than 24 hours.<ref name=ultradian>{{cite journal |author=Kramlinger KG, Post RM |title=Ultra-rapid and ultradian cycling in bipolar affective illness |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=168 |issue=3 |pages=314–23 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8833685 |doi=10.1192/bjp.168.3.314}}</ref>

==Notes==
* {{note|reference_name_A|a}}The term rapid cycling was defined prior to discovery of ultradian mood states. Thus it can be misleading to think of these states as ''ultra-rapid cycling'', as this particular form of cycling is also described as a mixed state, and has not gained universal acceptance. Both terms are unable to capture the nature of this unique form of manic-depressive illness.<ref name=ultradian/>
