A '''hip protector''' is a specialized form of pants or underwear containing pads (either hard or soft) along the outside of each hip/leg, designed to prevent [[hip fracture]]s following a fall. They are most commonly used in elderly individuals who have a high risk of falls and hip fractures (for example, due to history of a previous fall and underlying [[osteoporosis]]).<ref name="hipprotector">{{cite journal | last1 = Holzer | first1 = G | last2 = Holzer | first2 = LA | title = Hip protectors and prevention of hip fractures in older persons | journal = Geriatrics | volume = 62 | issue = 8 | pages = 15–20 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17668960 }}</ref>

Most hip fractures follow an impact due to a [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] fall.<ref name="hipfracture">{{cite journal | last1 = Lauritzen | first1 = JB | title = Hip fractures: incidence, risk factors, energy absorption, and prevention | journal = Bone | volume = 18 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 65S–75S | year = 1996 | pmid = 8717550 | doi=10.1016/8756-3282(95)00382-7}}</ref> The pads are located over the [[Human trochanter|trochanter]]s, the bony extrusions of the hip region.

Hip protectors are either of the "crash helmet type" or "energy-absorbing type". The "crash helmet type" distributes impacts into the surrounding soft tissue, while the "energy-absorbing type" is made of a compressible material and diminishes the force of impact. Both of these systems aim to reduce the focused force beneath an estimated fracture threshold.<ref name="hipprotector"/><ref name="hipprotectordesign">{{cite journal | last1 = Holzer | first1 = LA | last2 = Holzer | first2 = G | title = Design: A neglected factor in medicine | journal = McGill journal of medicine : MJM : an international forum for the advancement of medical sciences by students | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 3 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18523599 | pmc = 2323546 }}</ref>

Several different commercially available hip protectors exist, such as the Safehip (Tytex A/S, Ikast, Denmark), the AHIP Protector (Astrotech, Vienna, Austria) and the KPH hip protector (HRA Pharma, Paris, France).<ref name="hipprotector"/> The former has been used in most clinical trials.<ref name="fracturerisk">{{cite journal | last1 = Lin | first1 = JT | last2 = Lane | first2 = JM | title = Nonpharmacologic management of osteoporosis to minimize fracture risk | journal = Nature clinical practice.

However, [[acceptance]] and long-term compliance towards them is quite low,<ref name="BMJ-review"/> mainly because of discomfort, dislike of their appearance by the person wearing it, and disagreement about fracture risk.<ref name="compliance">{{cite journal | last1 = Patel | first1 = S | last2 = Ogunremi | first2 = L | last3 = Chinappen | first3 = U | title = Acceptability and compliance with hip protectors in community-dwelling women at high risk of hip fracture | journal = Rheumatology (Oxford, England) | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 769–72 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12730537 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/keg215 }}</ref> A recent study showed that hip protectors' design and mechanical properties vary drastically among commercially available hip protectors.<ref name="mechanical study">{{cite journal | last1 = Holzer | first1 = LA | last2 = Von Skrbensky | first2 = G | last3 = Holzer | first3 = G | title = Mechanical testing of different hip protectors according to a European Standard | journal = Injury | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 1172–5 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19524913 | doi = 10.1016/j.injury.2009.02.005 }}</ref>
