'''Infant formula''' is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water). The U.S. [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FFDCA) defines infant formula as "a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants by reason of its simulation of human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk".<ref>U.S. Food and Drug Administration. [http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/InfantFormula/ucm056524.htm What is an infant formula.]</ref>

The composition of infant formula is designed to be roughly based on a human mother's milk at approximately one to three months postpartum, although there are significant differences in the nutrient content of these products.<ref>Wells, J.C.K. [http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/ysiny/article/PIIS1084275696800170/abstract Nutritional considerations in infant formula design.] ''Seminars in Fetal & Neonatal Medicine'', 1(1): 19–26 (February 1996).</ref>  The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cow's milk [[whey]] and [[casein]] as a [[protein]] source, a blend of [[vegetable oil]]s as a fat source, [[lactose]] as a [[carbohydrate]] source, a [[vitamin]]-mineral mix, and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer.<ref>http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10935&page=41</ref> In addition, there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cow's milk (mostly in the United States and Great Britain) and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins. An upswing in [[breastfeeding]] in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of [[baby food]]s (including cow's milk), resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3- and 12-months.<ref name="Fomon">{{cite conference

A 2001 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report found that infant formula prepared in accordance with applicable [[Codex Alimentarius]] standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast [[milk substitute]]. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their ''Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding'', which restated that "processed-food products for infants and young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission", and also warned that "lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality". In particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment.<ref name="WHO">.World Health Organization.

===Raw milk formulas===
As physicians became increasingly concerned about the quality of such foods, medical recommendations such as [[Thomas Morgan Rotch]]'s "percentage method" (published in 1890) began to be distributed, and gained widespread popularity by 1907.<ref name = "Schuman"/>  These complex formulas recommended that parents mix cow's milk, water, cream, and sugar or honey in specific ratios to achieve the nutritional balance believed to approximate human milk reformulated in such a way as to accommodate the believed digestive capability of the infant.<ref name="Fomon"/>

At the dawn of the 20th century in the United States, most infants were breastfed, although many received some formula feeding as well. Home-made "percentage method" formulas were more commonly used than commercial formulas in both Europe and the United States.<ref name="friedenwald">{{cite book

  | id =}}</ref>  They were less expensive and were widely believed to be healthier. However, formula-fed babies exhibited more diet-associated medical problems, such as [[scurvy]], [[rickets]] and bacterial infections than breastfed babies. By 1920, the incidence of scurvy and rickets in formula-fed babies had greatly decreased through the addition of orange juice and [[cod liver oil]] to home-made formulas. Bacterial infections associated with formula remained a problem more prevalent in the United States than in Europe, where milk was usually boiled prior to use in formulas.<ref name="friedenwald"/>

===Evaporated milk formulas===
In the 1920s and 1930s, [[evaporated milk]] began to be widely commercially available at low prices, and several clinical studies suggested that babies fed evaporated milk formula thrive as well as breastfed babies<ref name = "Schuman"/><ref name="Marriott">{{cite journal

  }}</ref>

These findings are not supported by modern research. These studies, accompanied by the affordable price of [[evaporated milk]] and the availability of the home icebox initiated a tremendous rise in the use of evaporated milk formulas.<ref name = "Fomon"/>  By the late 1930s, the use of evaporated milk formulas in the United States surpassed all commercial formulas, and by 1950 over half of all babies in the United States were reared on such formulas.<ref name="Schuman"/>

===Commercial formulas===
In parallel with the enormous shift (in industrialized nations) away from breastfeeding to home-made formulas, nutrition scientists continued to analyze human milk and attempted to make infant formulas that more closely matched its composition.<ref name="Fomon" />  [[Maltose]] and [[dextrin]]s were believed nutritionally important, and in 1912, the [[Mead Johnson]] Company released a milk additive called ''Dextri-Maltose''. This formula was made available to mothers only by physicians. In 1919, milkfats were replaced with a blend of animal and vegetable fats as part of the continued drive to closer simulate human milk. This formula was called SMA for "simulated milk adapted."<ref name="Schuman" />

In the late 1920s, [[Alfred Bosworth]] released ''Similac'' (for "similar to lactation"), and Mead Johnson released ''Sobee''.<ref name="Schuman" />  Several other formulas were released over the next few decades, but commercial formulas did not begin to seriously compete with evaporated milk formulas until the 1950s. The reformulation and concentration of Similac in 1951, and the introduction (by Mead Johnson) of Enfamil (for "infant meal") in 1959 were accompanied by marketing campaigns that provided inexpensive formula to hospitals and pediatricians.<ref name="Schuman" />  By the early 1960s, commercial formulas were more commonly used than evaporated milk formulas in the United States, which all but vanished in the 1970s. By the early 1970s, over 75% of American babies were fed on formulas, almost entirely commercially produced.<ref name="Fomon" />

When birth rates in industrial nations tapered off during the 1960s, infant formula companies heightened marketing campaigns in non-industrialized countries. Unfortunately, poor sanitation led to steeply increased [[infant mortality|mortality rates]] among infants fed formula prepared with contaminated (drinking) water.<ref name = "Solomon">{{cite news| last = Solomon| first = Stephen| title = The Controversy Over Infant Formula | work = The New York Times | pages = 8 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E2D61738F935A35751C1A967948260&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=5| accessdate =August 11, 2008 | date=December 6, 1981}}</ref> Organized protests, the most famous of which was the [[Nestlé boycott]] of 1977, called for an end to unethical marketing. This boycott is ongoing, as the current coordinators maintain that Nestlé engages in marketing practices which violate the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]].

===Generic brand formulas===
In addition to commercially marketed brands, [[generic brand]]s (or store brands) of infant formula were introduced in the United States in 1997, first by PBM Products. These [[private label]] formulas are sold by many leading food and drug retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Kroger]], [[Loblaws]], and [[Walgreens]]. All infant formula brands in the United States are required to adhere to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) guidelines. As reported by the [[Mayo Clinic]]: “as with most consumer products, brand-name infant formulas cost more than generic brands. But that doesn't mean that brand-name [Similac, Nestle, Enfamil] formulas are better. Although manufacturers may vary somewhat in their formula recipes, the FDA requires that all formulas contain the same nutrient density.”<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/infant-formula/PR00058 Mayo Clinic], November 2007</ref>

Similarly, in Canada all infant formulas regardless of brand are required to meet standards set by Health Canada.<ref>Government of Alberta, Health and Wellness. [http://www.health.alberta.ca/health-info/baby-formula.html Infant formula.]</ref>

===Follow-on and toddler formulas===
Generally up to age 6 or 12 months, (when infants are typically breastfed) was considered largely saturated, and in conjunction with regulations on infant formula advertising. Critics have argued that follow-on and toddler formulas were introduced partly to circumvent these regulations and have resulted in confusing advertising.<ref name="loophole"/>

An early example of follow-on formula was introduced by [[Wyeth]] in the Philippines in 1987, following the introduction in this country of regulations on infant formula advertising, but which did not address follow-on formulas (products that did not exist at the time of their drafting).<ref name="milkcode" /> Similarly, while infant formula advertising is illegal in the United Kingdom, follow-on formula advertising is legal, and the similar packaging and market results in follow-on advertisements frequently being interpreted as advertisements for formula.<ref name="loophole"/> (See also [[#Policy, industry and marketing|industry and marketing]], below.)

These products have also recently fallen under criticism for contributing to the [[childhood obesity]] epidemic in some developed countries due to their marketing and flavoring practices.<ref>ABC News.

===Usage since 1970s===
Since the early 1970s, industrial countries have witnessed a resurgence in [[breastfeeding]] among newborns and infants to 6 months of age.<ref name="Ryan"/> This upswing in breastfeeding has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of other foods (such as cow's milk), resulting in increased use of both breastfeeding and infant formula between the ages of 3–12 months.<ref name="Fomon"/><ref name="Ryan"/>

The global infant formula market has been estimated at $7.9 billion,<ref name="kaminis">[http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/jan2005/pi20050111_1011_pi008.htm A Growing Boost for Baby Formula], by Markos Kaminis, BusinessWeek, January 11, 2005</ref> with North America and Western Europe accounting for 33% of the market and considered largely saturated, and Asia representing 53% of the market.<ref name="ubic"/> South East Asia is a particularly large fraction of the world market relative to its population.<ref name="ubic"/> Infant formula is the largest segment of the baby food market,<ref name="ubic">[http://www.ubic-consulting.com/food/ingredient/chemical-industries/ingredients-worl-infant-formula-market.html Ingredients for the World Infant Formula Market], UBIC consulting</ref><!--<ref name="agc">[http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=423654 Google Answers: Infant Formula Sales/Market/Statistics]</ref>--> with the fraction given as between 40%<ref name="ubic"/> and 70%.<ref name="kaminis" /><!--<ref name="agc"/>-->

Leading health organizations (e.g. [[World Health Organization|WHO]], U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]) are attempting to reduce the use of infant formula and increase the prevalence of breastfeeding from birth through 12 to 24 months of age through [[public health]] awareness campaigns.<ref name="CDC Promotion">{{cite web

==Preparation and content==

===Variations===
Infant formulas come in powder, liquid concentrate, and ready-to-feed forms. They are designed to be prepared by the parent or caregiver in small batches and fed to the infant, usually with either a cup, as recommended by the WHO,<ref name="WHO"/> or a [[baby bottle]].

Infant formulas also come in a variety of types:
*Cow's milk formula is the most commonly used type (e.g.: ''[[Similac]]'', ''[[Enfamil]]'').
*Soy protein based formulas are frequently used for infants allergic to cow's milk (e.g.: ''Isomil'', ''ProSobee'').
*Partially hydrolyzed formulas (e.g.: ''Good Start'' and ''Gentlease'' brands) are marketed as having improved digestibility.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
*Extensively hydrolyzed formulas (e.g.: ''Alimentum'', ''Nutramigen'', and ''Pregestimil'') are considered "[[hypoallergenic]]". One study reported that 90% of children with cow's milk allergies will tolerate them.<ref>Friedman NJ; Zeiger RS "The role of breast-feeding in the development of allergies and asthma." 'J Allergy Clin Immunol' 2005 Jun;115(6):1238–48.</ref>
*[[Amino acid based formulas]] (e.g.: ''Neocate'', ''EleCare'', and ''Nutramigen AA'') are more expensive, but are reported least likely to cause allergic reactions.<ref>"Introducing formula and solid foods to infants at risk for allergic disease" Fleischer, D.M. et al. UpToDate Online 18.1 2010.</ref>

Hypoallergenic formulas, such as those containing free individual amino acids, and sometimes referred to as elemental infant formula, are considered to reduce the likelihood of certain medical complications in babies with specific health problems, such as severe allergies to cow's milk and soy. Made of purely synthetic [[monomeric]] amino acids, they are often considered quite foul-tasting, and it is not uncommon for infants to reject elemental formulas after having been established on a sweeter-tasting regular formula.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Manufacturers and health officials advise it is very important to measure powders or concentrates accurately to achieve the intended final product concentration; otherwise, the child will be malnourished. It is advisable that all equipment that comes into contact with the infant formula be cleaned and sterilized before each use. Proper [[refrigeration]] is essential for any infant formula which is prepared in advance.

In developing countries, formula is frequently prepared improperly, resulting in high infant mortality due to [[malnutrition]] and diseases such as [[diarrhea]] and [[pneumonia]]. This is due to lack of clean water, lack of sterile conditions, lack of refrigeration, illiteracy (so written instructions cannot be followed), poverty (diluting formula so that it lasts longer), and lack of education of mothers by formula distributors. These problems and resulting disease and death are a key factor in opposition to the marketing and distribution of infant formula in developing countries by numerous [[public health]] agencies and NGOs (discussed in more detail at [[Nestlé boycott]] and [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]]).

===Nutritional content===
Besides breast milk, infant formula is the only other milk product which the medical community considers nutritionally acceptable for infants under the age of one year (as opposed to cow's milk, for instance). Supplementing with [[baby food|solid food]] in addition to breast milk or formula begins during [[weaning]], and most babies begin supplementing about the time their first teeth appear, usually around the age of six months.

Although cow's milk is the basis of almost all infant formula, plain cow's milk is unsuited for infants because of its high [[casein]] content and low [[whey]] content, which may put a strain on an infant's immature [[kidney]]s, and untreated cow's milk is not recommended before the age of 12 months. The infant intestine is not properly equipped to digest non-human milk, and this may often result in diarrhea, intestinal bleeding and malnutrition.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med|title= Intestinal Blood Loss During Cow Milk Feeding in Older Infants |author=Jiang, Jeter, Nelson, and Ziegler |date=July 2000|volume=154|issue=7|pages=673–678|url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/154/7/673#REF-POA90404-2|accessdate=Apr 6, 2011}}</ref>  To reduce the negative effect on the infant's digestive system, cow's milk used for formula undergoes processing to be made into infant formula. This includes steps to make protein more easily digestible and alter the [[whey]]-to-[[casein]] protein balance to one closer to human milk, the addition of several essential ingredients (often called "fortification", see below), the partial or total replacement of dairy fat with fats of vegetable or marine origin, etc.

The nutrient content of infant formula for sale in the United States is regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) based on recommendations by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Committee on Nutrition. The following must be included in all formulas produced in the U.S.:<ref name=two>Blachford, Ed. Cengage, G.

** Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for growing infants, as they account for 35 to 42% of their daily energy intake. In most cow's milk-based formulas, [[lactose]] is the main source of carbohydrates present, but lactose is not present in cow's milk-based lactose-free formulas nor specialized non-milk protein formulas or hydrolyzed protein formulas for infants with milk protein sensitivity. Lactose is also not present in soy-based formulas. Therefore, those formulas without lactose will use other sources of carbohydrates, such as sucrose and [[glucose]], dextrins, and natural and modified [[starch]]es. Lactose is not only a good source of energy, it also aids in the absorption of the minerals magnesium, calcium, zinc and iron.<ref name=carb>Schmidl, M.K., Labuza, T.P.

Google Book Search. Retrieved on November 7, 2009.</ref>
*[[Nucleotides]]
** Nucleotides are compounds found naturally in human breast milk. They are involved in critical metabolic processes, such as energy metabolism and enzymatic reactions. Also, as the building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), they are essential for normal body functions. Compared to human breast milk, cow's milk has lower levels of the nucleotides uridine, inosine, and cytidine. Therefore, several companies that produce infant formula have added nucleotides to their infant formulas.<ref name=carb/>

Other commonly used ingredients:
*[[Emulsifiers]] and [[stabilizers]]: Ingredients added to prevent the separation of the oil from the water (and its soluble components) in the infant formula.

*[[Diluent]]s: Skim milk is commonly used as the primary diluent in milk-based liquid formula to provide the bulk of the volume. In contrast, purified water is the most commonly used diluent in milk-free formulations.<ref name="two" />

In addition, formulas not made with cow's milk include [[biotin]], [[choline]], and [[inositol]].

==Uses, risks and controversies==
The use and marketing of infant formula has come under scrutiny. [[Breastfeeding]], including exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, is widely advocated as "ideal" for babies and infants, both by health authorities<ref name="WHO"/><ref name="CDC Breastfeeding FAQ"/> — and accordingly in ethical advertising of infant formula manufacturers.<ref>[http://www.babymilk.nestle.com/FAQ/HomeFAQ.htm#question0 Nestlé FAQ – Should all mothers be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively for the first 6 months?]</ref>

Despite the recommendation that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, less than 40% of infants below this age are exclusively breastfed worldwide.<ref>World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/child_adolescent_health/news/archive/2011/29_07_2011/en/index.html World Breastfeeding Week August 1–7, 2011.] Retrieved August 8, 2011.</ref> The overwhelming majority of American babies are not exclusively breastfed for this period – in 2005 under 12% of babies were breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months,<ref name="CDC Breastfeeding FAQ"/> with over 60% of babies of 2 months of age being fed formula,<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/ifps/results/ch3/table3-1.htm Infant Feeding Practices Study II > Results]</ref> and approximately one in four breastfed infants having infant formula feeding within two days of birth.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/NIS_data/index.htm Breastfeeding Among U.S. Children Born 1999—2005, CDC National Immunization Survey]</ref>

Some studies have shown that use of formula can vary according to the parents' socio-economic status, ethnicity or other characteristics. For example, according to a research conducted in Vancouver, Canada, 82.9% of mothers breastfeed their babies at birth, but the number differed between Caucasians (91.6%) and non-Caucasians (56.8%), with the difference essentially attributed to marital status, education and family income.<ref>Williams, PL; Innis, SM; Vogel, AM;, (1998), [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8870300 Breastfeeding and weaning practices in Vancouver.] ''Can J Public Health''. 1996 Jul–Aug;87(4):231-6.</ref> In the United States, mothers of lower socio-economic status have been found less likely to breastfeed, although this may be partly related to adverse effects of government nutrition supplementation programs that provide subsidies for infant formula.<ref name="whopays"/>

===Use of infant formula===
In most cases, infant formula is used to avoid the discomforts of breast feeding (or expressing breast milk) as perceived by the mother. These include being the sole source of food for the infant, which implies waking several times a night for feedings, inconvenience involved with breastfeeding and working outside the home, physical discomforts such as nipple pain, and changes in the shape of the breasts. 
In some cases, breastfeeding is medically contraindicated. These include:

====Melamine contamination====
{{Main|2008 Chinese milk scandal}}
Health officials around the world have been on alert for [[melamine]] contamination in infant formula since the 2008 discovery of a massive case of melamine poisoning in [[People's Republic of China|China]], where milk was deliberately adulterated with the chemical, leading to illnesses in more than 300,000 infants, including cases of [[acute kidney failure]], and blamed for the deaths of at least six babies. Large quantities of melamine were added to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of having adequate protein levels.<ref name="theglobeandmail.com"/>

In November 2008, traces of melamine were reported to have been found by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] in infant formula sold in the United States made by the three main American firms<ref name="AP">[http://www.ap.org/FOI/foi_112608b.htm FDA Finds Traces Of Melamine In US Infant Formula], posted by [[Associated Press]], November 26, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27914218/ Calls for national infant formula recall spread: Worried parents look for guidance after traces of melamine found], posted by MSNBC.com, November 26, 2008.</ref> — [[Abbott Laboratories]], [[Nestle]] and [[Mead Johnson]] — responsible for 90–99% of the infant formula market in that country.<ref name="whopays"/><ref name="AP"/> The levels were much less than those reported in China, where levels of melamine contamination had reached as much as 2,500 parts per million, about 10,000 times higher than the recorded US levels. The [[material safety data sheet]] for melamine ([[CAS registry number]] 108-78-1; C3-H6-N6) recorded the acute oral toxicity ([[median lethal dose]]) at 3161&nbsp;mg/kg (3161 ppm) for a rat.

[[Health Canada]] conducted a separate test and also detected traces of melamine in infant formula available in Canada. The melamine levels were well below Health Canada's safety limits,<ref>Health Canada.

*In December 2011 Wal-Mart recalled a quantity of infant formula after a baby died in Missouri. "We extend our deepest condolences to this baby boy's family as they try to come to grips with their loss," said Dianna Gee, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. "As soon as we heard what happened, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the Department of Health and Senior Services to provide any information we may have to help with the investigation." Wal-Mart said it pulled a batch of Enfamil from its stores nationwide that matched the size and lot number ZP1k7G of the formula that may have sickened the baby in Missouri, Gee said. The baby formula was purchased from a Wal-Mart in Lebanon, Missouri. After the purchase, a 10-day-old infant died from a rare bacterial infection, CNN affiliate KYTV reported. Authorities ran tests to determine if the death came from the formula, the water to make the formula or any other factor, said Mead Johnson Nutrition, the company that makes Enfamil. "We are highly confident in the safety and quality of our products – and the rigorous testing we put them through," said Chris Perille, a Mead Johnson Nutrition spokesman.[Source CNN]

==Policy, industry and marketing==
The policy, regulatory and industry environments surrounding the infant formula market vary tremendously between countries.

===International===
{{Main|International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes}}
{{See also|Nestle Boycott}}

The [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] is an international [[health policy]] framework adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]] of the [[WHO]] in 1981 regarding infant formula marketing, including strict restrictions on advertising.<ref name="ICMBS"/> Its implementation depends on the laws of different countries and the behavior of infant formula manufacturers – the code has no power itself. Legislation and corporate behavior vary significantly between countries: at least 65 countries have enacted national legislation implementing all or many of the provisions of the Code;<ref>UNICEF. [http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_24805.html International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.] Retrieved August 9, 2011.</ref> whereas elsewhere neither the Code nor its principles are followed by governments or formula manufacturers.

Practices that are banned in the Code include most advertising, claiming health benefits for formula, and giving [[Product sample|free samples]] to women able to breastfeed – this latter practice is particularly criticized because it can interfere with lactation, creating dependence on formula. In many countries free samples of infant formula have been provided to hospitals for decades; infant formula is often the only product routinely provided free of charge to hospitals.<ref>Counseling the nursing mother, By Judith Lauwers, Anna Swisher, [http://books.google.com/books?id=crW6348Iw_wC&pg=PA597 p. 597]</ref> The [[Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative]] aims to reduce and eliminate this controversial practice.

Infant formula marketing has been regulated since the 1987 Executive Order 51 or "Milk Code",<ref name="milkcode" /> which regulated, but did not ban, practices such as advertising and providing free samples. Shortly after it was enacted, [[Wyeth]] introduced "follow-on formula", which was not in the purview of the Milk Code which predated its market entry.

In 2006, the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] banned the advertising of infant formula and the practice of providing free samples, regardless of intended age group (in the ''Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations'' of Executive Order 51, or RIRR).<ref name="UNICEF-P">UNICEF Philippines.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, infant formula advertising has been illegal since 1995,<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950077_en_1.htm Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 77: The Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula Regulations 1995]</ref> but advertising for "follow-on formula" is legal, which has been cited as a loophole allowing advertising of similarly-packaged formula.<ref name="loophole">[http://www.babyfriendly.org.uk/items/item_detail.asp?item=47 Legal loophole allows banned formula advertising to mothers]</ref>

==== United States ====
In the United States, infant formula is both heavily marketed – the country has not adopted [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|the Code]], nor is it being systematically implemented by manufacturers for domestic marketing<ref>[http://www.breastfeedingbasics.org/cgi-bin/deliver.cgi/content/International/his_code.html Breastfeeding Around the World: The International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes.] Retrieved August 9, 2011.</ref> – and even heavily [[subsidy|subsidized]] by the government: at least one third of the American market is supported by the government,<ref name="kaminis"/> with over half of infant formula sold in the country provided through the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]] (known as [[WIC]]).<ref name="whopays">[http://www.ers.usda.gov/AmberWaves/September04/Features/infantformula.htm Sharing the Economic Burden: Who Pays for WIC’s Infant Formula?], ''AmberWaves'', September 2004.</ref>

According to surveys, over 70% of large U.S. hospitals dispense infant formula to all infants, a practice opposed by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] and in violation of the Code.<ref name="AAPad">[http://www.aap.org/research/periodicsurvey/ps13.htm Periodic Survey of Fellows: Survey shows most AAP members support formula advertising policy], American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).</ref> The [[Gerber Products Company]] began marketing its brand of infant formula directly to the public in October 1989, while the [[Carnation Company]] began marketing ''Good Start'' infant formula directly to the public in January 1991.<ref name="AAPad" />

Infant formula costs are a significant fraction of the WIC program costs: 21% post-rebate and 46% pre-rebate.<ref name="whopays"/> Formula manufacturers are granted a WIC monopoly in individual states.<ref name="whopays"/> Meanwhile breastfeeding rates are substantially lower for WIC recipients;<ref name="gao">[http://www.gao.gov/htext/d06282.html Breastfeeding: Some Strategies Used to Market Infant Formula May Discourage Breastfeeding; State Contracts Should Better Protect against Misuse of WIC Name], U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)</ref> this is partly attributed to formula being free of charge to mothers in the WIC program, who are of lower socio-economic status.<ref name="whopays"/> Violations of federal policy have also been found in terms of infant formula company advertising using the WIC trademark, to reach both WIC and non-WIC participants.<ref name="gao"/> In recent years WIC has been expanding its [[breastfeeding promotion]] strategies, including providing subsidies for clients who use [[milk bank]]s.<ref>[http://www.breastfeeding.com/all_about/all_about_milk_banks.html Banking on Breastmilk]</ref>

| Protein was added because it was believed cow's milk protein content was lower than human milk protein content; protein at 3.3–4.0 g/100 kcal was added.<ref name=name />
|- style="background:white"
| ''' 1959 '''
| Iron fortification was introduced because a large amount of iron (~80%) is used to expand the red blood cell mass in a growing infant. Infants with birth weights between 1500 and 2500g require 2&nbsp;mg/kg of iron per day. Infants with weights of less than 1500g require 4&nbsp;mg/kg per day.<ref name=name /><ref>{{cite journal | author = American  | year = 1999 | title = Iron fortification of infant formulas | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 104 | issue = 1| pages = 119–123 }}</ref>

|- style="background:white"
| ''' 1984 '''
| [[Taurine]] fortification was introduced because newborn infants lack the enzymes needed to convert and form taurine.<ref name=name /><ref>Heird, W.C. (2004). Taurine in neonatal nutrition – revisited. ''Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed, 89,'' 473–474.</ref>

=== Current general procedure ===
The manufacturing process may differ for different types of formula made; therefore the following is the general procedure for liquid-milk based formulas:<ref name="two" />

==== Mixing ingredients ====
Primary ingredients are blended in large stainless steel tanks and skim milk is added and adjusted to 60 °C. Then, fats, oils and emulsifiers are added. Additional heating and mixing may be required to get proper consistency. Next, minerals, vitamins, and stabilizing gums are added at various points, depending on their sensitivity to heat. The batch is temporarily stored and then transported by pipelines to pasteurization equipment when mixing is complete.<ref name="two" />

==== Pasteurization ====
This is a process that protects against spoilage by eliminating bacteria, yeasts and molds.
It involves quickly heating and then cooling of the product under controlled conditions which micro-organisms cannot survive. The batch is held at around 85–94 °C for approximately 30 seconds which is necessary to adequately reduce micro-organisms and prepare the formula for filling.<ref name="two" />

==== Homogenization ====
This is a process which increases emulsion uniformity and stability by reducing size of fat and oil particles in the formula. It is done with a variety of mixing equipment that applies shear to the product and this mixing breaks fat and oil particles into very small droplets.<ref name="two" />

==== Standardization ====
Standardization is used to ensure that the key parameters like pH, fat concentration and vitamins and mineral content are correct. If insufficient levels of these are found, the batch is reworked to achieve appropriate levels. After this step, the batch is ready to be packaged.<ref name="two" />

==== Packaging ====
Packaging depends on manufacturer and type of equipment used, but in general, liquid formula is filled into metal cans with lids crimped into place.<ref name="two" />

==== Heat treatment or sterilization ====
Finally, infant formulas are heat treated to maintain the bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then [[spray drying]] would be required in addition.<ref name="multiple">{{cite journal | author = Lonnerdal B., Hernell O. | year = 1998 | title = Effects of feeding ultrahigh-temperature (UHT)-treated infant formula with different protein concentrations or powdered formula, as compared with breast-feeding, on plasma amino acids, hematology, and trace element status | url = | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 68 | pages = 350–6 }}</ref> Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118 °C.<ref name="multiple"/> Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142 °C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.<ref name="multiple"/>

=== Recent and future potential new ingredients ===

==== Probiotics ====
Recently, [[probiotics]] have become a new ingredient in many of our foods, and studies have been completed regarding the use of probiotics in infant formula<ref name="probiotics">Carvalho, R.S., Michail, S., Ashai-Khan, F., Mezoff, A.G. (2008). An Update on Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition: A Review of Some Recent Advances. ''Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care,'' 204–228.</ref> Several randomized, controlled trials completed recently have shown limited and short term clinical benefits for the use of probiotics in infants’ diet<ref name="probiotics"/> The safety of probiotics in general and in infants, especially preterm infants, has been investigated in a limited number of controlled trials. The findings thus far suggest probiotics are generally safe.<ref name="probiotics"/> Therefore, the study suggested more scientific research is necessary before a conclusion can be made about probiotic supplementation in infant formula, since the research is still quite preliminary.<ref name="probiotics"/>

==== Prebiotics ====
[[Prebiotics]] are undigestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in the gut. Human milk contains a variety of oligosaccharides believed to be an important factor in the pattern of microflora colonization of breastfed infants. Because of variety, variability, complexity and polymorphism of the oligosaccharide composition and structure, it is currently not feasible to reproduce the oligosaccharide components of human milk in a strictly structural fashion.<ref name="prebiotic">International Assassination of Infant Food Manufacturers,[http://www.ifm.net/industry/prebiotics.htm “Prebiotics in Infant Nutrition”], November 9, 2009</ref>

The European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition found evidence to support short term effects of ingesting prebiotics on stool microflora of infants with increased in the number of bifidobacteria. Babies can be at risk of dehydration with the induction of softer stools, if they have the kidney immaturity and/or a poor ability to concentrate urine.<ref name="prebiotic"/> A reduction of pathogens has been associated with the consumption of prebiotics.<ref name="prebiotic"/> However, there was no evidence to support major clinical or long-term benefits.<ref name="probiotics"/> Therefore, there is little evidence of beneficial effects of prebiotics in dietary products.<ref name="probiotics"/>

==== Lysozyme and lactoferrin ====
[[Lysozyme]] is an enzyme that is responsible for protecting the body by damaging bacterial cell walls. [[Lactoferrin]] is a globular, multifunctional protein that has antimicrobial activity. Compared to human milk, cow’s milk has a signifactly lower levels of lysozyme and lactoferrin; therefore, the industry has an increasing interest in adding them into infant formulas.<ref name=name/>
