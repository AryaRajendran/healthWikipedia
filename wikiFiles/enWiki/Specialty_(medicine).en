A '''specialty''' (or '''speciality''') in [[medicine]] is a branch of medical science. After completing [[medical school]], [[physician]]s or [[surgeon]]s usually further their [[medical education]] in a specific specialty of medicine by completing a multiple year [[residency (medicine)|residency]] to become a '''medical specialist'''.

==History of medical specialization==
To a certain extent, medical practitioners have always been specialized. According to [[Galen]], specialization was common among Roman doctors. The particular system of modern medical specialities evolved gradually during the 19th century. Informal social recognition of medical specialization evolved before the formal legal system. The particular subdivision of the practice of medicine into various specialities varies from country to country, and is somewhat arbitrary.<ref name="BullHistMed2003-Weisz">{{cite journal | author=Weisz G | title=The Emergence of Medical Specialization in the Nineteenth Century | journal=Bull Hist Med | date= Fall, 2003 | pages=536â€“574 | volume=77 | issue=3 | pmid=14523260 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bhm/summary/v077/77.3weisz.html }}</ref>

== Classification of medical specialization ==
Medical specialties can be classified along several axes. These are:
* Surgical or internal medicine
* Age range of patients
* Diagnostic or therapeutic
* Organ-based or technique-based

Throughout history, the most important has been the division into surgical and internal medicine specialties. The surgical specialties are the specialties in which an important part of diagnosis and treatment is achieved through major surgical techniques. The internal medicine specialties are the specialties in which the main diagnosis and treatment is never major surgery. Anesthesiology is classified as a surgical discipline, since it is vital in the surgical process, though anesthesiologists never perform major surgery themselves.

Many specialties are organ-based. Many symptoms and diseases come from a particular organ. Others are based mainly around a set of techniques, such as radiology, which was originally based around X-rays.

The age range of patients seen by any given specialist can be quite variable. Paediatricians handle most complaints and diseases in children that do not require surgery, and there are several subspecialties (formally or informally) in paediatrics that mimic the organ-based specialties in adults. Paediatric surgery may or may not be a separate specialty that handles some kinds of surgical complaints in children.

A further subdivision is the diagnostic versus therapeutic specialties. While the diagnostic process is of great importance in all specialties, some specialists perform mainly or only diagnostic examinations, such as pathology, clinical neurophysiology, and radiology. This line is becoming somewhat blurred with [[interventional radiology]], an evolving field that uses image expertise to perform minimally invasive procedures.

==Future medical specialties==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2013}}
Due to the large decline in men's use of healthcare services and facilities, there may be a future in creating a specialty dedicated exclusively to men's health and well being. It would be a counterpart to gynecology and would be most aptly named andrology.

==Physician compensation==
The mean annual salary of a medical specialist is $175,011<ref name=ibmdllc/> in the US, and $272,000<ref name=ibmdllc>[http://www.ibmdllc.com/docs/Physician%20Income%20not%20rising%20as%20fast%20as%20other%20professionals.pdf ibmdllc.com -Physician income not rising as fast as other professional pay] {{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> for surgeons. However, because of commodity [[inflation]], increasing negligent costs, steep price rise of rental, the annual salary range of a medical specialist varies and is not rising as fast as other professional pay. Oftentimes, especially in the United States, physicians practice in groups of specialists within a particular medical specialty. These practice groups are often formed to help reach economies of scales in rental, insurance and staff costs as well as other benefits of practicing with other professionals and are typically governed by various legal documents.<ref>{{cite web |title=Physician Separation Issues |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/physician-separation-issues|publisher=Baker & Hostetler LLP|work=The [[National Law Review]]|date=2011-11-21|accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref>

==Specialties by country==
===Australia and New Zealand===
Specialty training in Australia and New Zealand is overseen by the specialty colleges:
* [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]]
* [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]]

===Canada===
Specialty training in Canada is overseen by the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]]

===India===
Specialty training in India is overseen by the [[Medical Council of India]], which is responsible for recognition of post graduate training and by the [[National Board of Examinations]]. And education of [[Ayurveda]] in overseen by [[Central Council of Indian Medicine]] (CCIM), the council conducts u.g and p.g courses all over India, while [[Central Council of Homoeopathy]] does the same in the field of Homeopathy.

===United States===
There are three agencies or organizations in the United States that collectively oversee [[physician board certification]] of [[Medical Doctor|MD]] and [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|DO]] [[physicians in the United States]] in the 26 approved medical specialties recognized in the country. These organizations are the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] (ABMS) and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA); the [[American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists]] (AOABOS) and the [[American Osteopathic Association]]; the [[American Board of Physician Specialties]] (ABPS) and the [[American Association of Physician Specialists]] (AAPS). Each of these agencies and their associated national medical organization functions as its various specialty academies, colleges and societies.

All boards of certification now require that [[physician|medical practitioners]] demonstrate, by examination, continuing mastery of the core knowledge and skills for a chosen specialty. Recertification varies by particular specialty between every seven and every ten years.

==Other uses==
In the [[U.S. Army]], the term "medical specialist" refers to occupational therapists, physical therapists, dietitians and physician assistants, also known as [[allied health]] professionals.
