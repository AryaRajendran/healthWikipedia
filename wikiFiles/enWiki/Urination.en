'''Urination''', also known as '''micturition''', '''voiding''', '''peeing''', '''weeing''', '''pissing''', and more rarely, '''emiction''', is the ejection of [[urine]] from the [[urinary bladder]] through the [[urethra]] to the outside of the body. In healthy humans (and [[#Animals|many other animals]]) the process of urination is under voluntary control. In infants, some elderly individuals, and those with neurological injury, urination may occur as an [[involuntary]] [[reflex]]. In other animals, in addition to expelling waste material, urination [[#Other animals|can mark territory or express submissiveness]]. Physiologically, micturition involves coordination between the [[central nervous system|central]], [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], and [[somatic nervous system]]s. Brain centers that regulate urination include the [[pontine micturition center]], [[periaqueductal gray]], and the [[cerebral cortex]]. In male [[placental mammals]], urine is ejected through the [[penis]]. In female placental mammals (with some exceptions, including female [[galago]]s,<ref name="Roughgarden, 2004">{{cite book |last=Roughgarden |first=Joan |year=2004 |title=Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-24073-5|pages=38-39|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dASsUFtN57sC&pg=PA38&dq=The+animal+can+pee+with+the+organ,+making+it+a+penis.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iLNkUYmzBsXjrAG17YHIDQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=The%20animal%20can%20pee%20with%20the%20organ%2C%20making%20it%20a%20penis.&f=false}}</ref> female [[spider monkey]]s,<ref name="Dixson">{{cite book |last=Dixson |first=Alan F. |title=Primate Sexuality: Comparative Studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Humans |isbn=978-0-19-954464-6 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-11-22|page=364|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SY-PyKNQglIC&pg=PA364}}</ref> and female [[spotted hyena]]s,<ref name="Roughgarden, 2004"/> which urinate through a [[pseudo-penis]]), urine is ejected through the [[vulva]].

==Anatomy and physiology==
===Anatomy of the bladder and outlet===
[[Image:Gray1140.png|The interior of the bladder|thumb]]
{{Main|Urinary bladder|Urethra}}

The main organs involved in urination are the [[urinary bladder]] and the [[urethra]]. The [[smooth muscle]] of the bladder, known as the [[detrusor]], is innervated by [[sympathetic nervous system]] fibers from the [[lumbar]] [[spinal cord]] and [[parasympathetic]] fibers from the [[sacral]] spinal cord.<ref name=wennemer2008>{{cite web

Part of the urethra is surrounded by the [[external urethral sphincter]], which is innervated by the somatic [[pudendal nerve]] originating in the  cord, in an area termed [[Onuf's nucleus]].<ref>{{cite journal

Smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra, and these fibers are sometimes called the [[internal urethral sphincter]], although they do not encircle the urethra. Farther along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle, the sphincter of the membranous urethra (external urethral sphincter). The bladder's epithelium is termed [[transitional epithelium]] which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated. When the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous (flat) and the stratification of the cuboidal is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching.

===Physiology===
The physiology of micturition and the physiologic basis of its disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion, especially at the supraspinal level. Micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the [[pontine micturition center]] and, like [[defecation]], subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition.<ref name=yoshimura>{{cite journal |author=Yoshimura N, Chancellor MB |title=Neurophysiology of Lower Urinary Tract Function and Dysfunction |journal=Rev Urol |volume=5 |issue=Suppl 8 |pages=S3–S10 |year=2003 |pmid=16985987 |pmc=1502389 |ref=harv }}</ref>

In healthy individuals, the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine is stored in the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra.<ref name=yoshimura/> At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Groat WC, Ryall RW |title=Reflexes to sacral parasympathetic neurones concerned with micturition in the cat |journal=J. Physiol. (Lond.) |volume=200 |issue=1 |pages=87–108 |year=1969 |month=January |pmid=5248885 |pmc=1350419 |url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/200/1/87.long |ref=harv}}</ref> At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage.<ref name=yoshimura/> The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] and somatic nervous systems. During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] stimulation. During micturition, [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition.

It is commonly believed that in infants, voiding occurs involuntarily (as a reflex). However, the practice of [[elimination communication]] suggests otherwise.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of 2–3 years, as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops. In the adult, the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about {{convert|300|–|400|mL}}

====Storage phase====
During storage, bladder pressure stays low, because of the bladder's highly compliant nature. A plot of bladder (intravesical) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder (called a [[cystometrogram]]), will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled. This phenomenon is a manifestation of the [[Young–Laplace equation|law of Laplace]], which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fills, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. The bladder's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity; however, when its nerve supply is intact, stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle.

Action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves.<ref name=yoshimura/> Since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase, these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies. Low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Conversely, afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of Onuf's nucleus, and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons.

[[Polyuria|Diuresis]] (production of urine by the kidney) occurs constantly, and as the bladder becomes full, afferent firing increases, yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding.

====Voiding phase====
[[File:Female urination - on white - 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Urinating woman]]
[[File:Male urination - on white - 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Urinating man]]
Voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination, and continues until the bladder is empty.

Bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the [[periaqueductal gray]], where they project both to the [[pontine micturition center]] and to the cerebrum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blok BF, Holstege G |title=Direct projections from the periaqueductal gray to the pontine micturition center (M-region). An anterograde and retrograde tracing study in the cat |journal=Neurosci. Lett. |volume=166 |issue=1 |pages=93–6 |year=1994 |month=January |pmid=7514777 |doi=10.1016/0304-3940(94)90848-6 |ref=harv}}</ref> At a certain level of afferent activity, the conscious urge to void becomes difficult to ignore. Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued, neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally, causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons. The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract; as a result, a sudden, sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs. The pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of Onuf's nucleus, resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sie JA, Blok BF, de Weerd H, Holstege G |title=Ultrastructural evidence for direct projections from the pontine micturition center to glycine-immunoreactive neurons in the sacral dorsal gray commissure in the cat |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |volume=429 |issue=4 |pages=631–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11135240 |doi=10.1002/1096-9861(20010122)429:4<631::AID-CNE9>3.0.CO;2-M |ref=harv}}</ref> When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra. The micturition reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder.

The flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition, which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty.<ref>[http://www.jurology.com/pt/re/juro/fulltext.00005392-199907000-00069.htm Elsevier<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

After urination, the [[female urethra]] empties partially by gravity, with assistance from muscles.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} Urine remaining in the [[male urethra|urethra of the male]] is expelled by several contractions of the [[bulbospongiosus muscle]], and, by some men, manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine.

====Voluntary control====

The mechanism by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DasGupta R, Kavia RB, Fowler CJ |title=Cerebral mechanisms and voiding function |journal=BJU Int. |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=731–4 |year=2007|pmid=17378838 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.06749.x |ref=harv}}</ref> One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the [[detrusor muscle]] to initiate its contraction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kinder MV, Bastiaanssen EH, Janknegt RA, Marani E |title=Neuronal circuitry of the lower urinary tract; central and peripheral neuronal control of the micturition cycle |journal=Anat. Embryol. |volume=192 |issue=3 |pages=195–209 |year=1995|pmid=8651504 |doi=10.1007/BF00184744 |ref=harv}}</ref> Another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center, which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.<ref name=yoshimura/>

There is an inhibitory area for micturition in the midbrain. After transection of the brain stem just above the pons, the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it, whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain, the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal. There is another facilitatory area in the posterior hypothalamus. In humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus, the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced. However, stimulation experiments in animals indicate that other cortical areas also affect the process.

The bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine. Voluntary contraction of the [[abdominal muscles]] aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall, but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty.

Voiding can also be consciously interrupted once it has begun, through a contraction of the perineal muscles. The external sphincter can be contracted voluntarily, which will prevent urine from passing down the urethra.

Voiding can be facilitated by immersing a hand in a cup or sink full of warm water.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The mechanism is unclear. The phenomenon (and perhaps [[immersion diuresis]]) has given rise to the trick of immersing the hand of a sleeping person in water to make this victim urinate in sleep, although the efficacy of the trick is disputed.

====Experience of urination====
The need to urinate is experienced as an uncomfortable, full feeling. It is highly correlated with the fullness of the bladder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oliver S, Fowler C, Mundy A, Craggs M |title=Measuring the sensations of urge and bladder filling during cystometry in urge incontinence and the effects of neuromodulation |journal=Neurourol. Urodyn. |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=7–16 |year=2003 |pmid=12478595 |doi=10.1002/nau.10082 |ref=harv }}</ref> In many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder, even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself, and can be felt there as well.  In females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full. When the bladder becomes too full, the sphincter muscles will involuntarily relax, allowing urine to pass from the bladder. Release of urine is experienced as a lessening of the discomfort.

===Disorders===
[[Image:Konstantinderafrikaner.jpg|thumb|People showing the physician [[Constantine the African]] urine samples for diagnosis]]

====Clinical conditions====
Many clinical conditions can cause disturbances to normal urination, including:

* [[Urinary incontinence]], the inability to hold urine
** [[Stress incontinence]], incontinence as a result of external mechanical disturbances
** [[Urge incontinence]], incontinence that occurs as a result of the uncontrollable urge to urinate
** Mixed incontinence, a combination of the two types of incontinence
* [[Urinary retention]], the inability to initiate urination
* [[Overactive bladder]], a strong urge to urinate, usually accompanied by detrusor overactivity
* [[Interstitial cystitis]], a condition characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pain
* [[Prostatitis]], an inflammation of the prostate gland that can cause urinary frequency, urgency, and pain
* [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]], an enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary frequency, urgency, retention, and the dribbling of urine
* [[Urinary tract infection]], which can cause urinary frequency and [[dysuria]]
* [[Polyuria]], abnormally large production of urine, associated with, in particular, [[diabetes mellitus]] (types [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|1]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|2]]), and [[diabetes insipidus]]
* [[Oliguria]], low urine output, usually due to a problem with the upper urinary tract
* [[Anuria]] refers to absent or almost absent urine output.
* [[Paruresis]], the inability to urinate in the presence of others, such as in a public toilet.

A drug that increases urination is called a [[diuretic]], whereas [[antidiuretic]]s decrease the production of urine by the kidneys.

====Experimentally induced disorders====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
There are three major types of bladder dysfunction due to neural lesions: (1) the type due to interruption of the afferent nerves from the bladder; (2) the type due to interruption of both afferent and efferent nerves; and (3) the type due to interruption of facilitatory and inhibitory pathways descending from the brain. In all three types the bladder contracts, but the contractions are generally not sufficient to empty the viscus completely, and residual urine is left in the bladder. [[Paruresis]], also known as shy bladder syndrome, is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area. As these people may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals directly adjacent to another person.  Alternatively, they may opt for the privacy of a stall or simply avoid public toilets altogether.

=====Deafferentation=====
When the sacral dorsal roots are cut in experimental animals or interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as [[tabes dorsalis]] in humans, all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished. The bladder becomes distended, thin-walled, and hypotonic, but there are some contractions because of the intrinsic response of the smooth muscle to stretch.

=====Denervation=====
When the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed, as they may be by tumors of the [[cauda equina]] or [[filum terminale]], the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while. Gradually, however, the muscle of the "decentralized bladder" becomes active, with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra. The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied. The reason for the difference between the small, hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended, hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known. The hyperactive state in the former condition suggests the development of denervation hypersensitization even though the neurons interrupted are [[preganglionic]] rather than [[postganglionic]].

=====Spinal cord transection=====
During [[spinal shock]], the bladder is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock has passed, the voiding reflex returns, although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers when the spinal cord is transected. Some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs, provoking a mild mass reflex. In some instances, the voiding reflex becomes hyperactive. Bladder capacity is reduced, and the wall becomes hypertrophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder. The reflex hyperactivity is made worse by, and may be caused by, infection in the bladder wall.

==Techniques==
[[File:Gray1142.png|upright|thumb|Location of [[external urethral orifice (male)|external urethral orifice in adult human male]]]]
Due to the positions where the [[urethra]] ends, males and females often use different techniques for urination.

===Male urination===
Many males prefer to urinate standing, but because of the use of squat toilets in most parts of Asia and the Middle East, many males there prefer to urinate while they are sitting.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Extant foreskin (acropostheon) may block the direct path of the outgoing stream by causing [[turbulence]], resulting in a slower but thicker stream of urine that may also dribble. A retracted or absent foreskin may have a more focused stream of urine that travels at the same speed as it exits the [[urethra]]. To optimise penile hygiene, adult males are encouraged to retract their foreskin when urinating to prevent any excess urine remaining under the foreskin.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  When some males are finished urinating, they may shake and/or gently squeeze their penis to expel any excess urine trapped in the foreskin or on the [[Glans penis|glans]]. Trousers commonly have a [[fly (clothing)|fly]] allowing men to urinate without lowering them. Trousers without a fly, such as jogging pants, usually have an elastic waist band allowing the male to lower the front side like underpants. Some males prefer to urinate sitting down.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  For Muslim men this is associated with [[cleanliness]] practices or [[awra]].<ref>{{cite web
|title=turn to islam
|web=Voluntary action
|date=26 Dec 2011}}</ref> It is also possible to urinate during [[defecation]], as the anal and urethal sphincter muscles are closely linked and can be relaxed together.

{{anchor|Female}}
===Female urination===

In females, the urethra opens straight into the [[vulva]]. Because of this, the urine often does not exit at a distance from the body and is therefore seen as harder to control. Hence, in many Western cultures, urination will often take place while sitting on a toilet, like defecation. When not urinating into a toilet, [[squatting position|squatting]] is one way for a female to direct the urine stream. If done this way, the urine will often go downward and slightly forwards. Some females use one or both hands to focus the direction of the urine stream which sprays out in a somewhat cone pattern.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

It is also possible for females to urinate while standing, and while clothed. The "nonprotruding" nature of the average female urethra is not an issue, as one can, for example, pull down one's trousers and expose the vulva. If a female wears a [[sarong]], [[skirt]], or other such open bottomed garments, uncovering the vulva and merely spreading the legs may be enough to place the urine stream away from the body and clothes. The urine may or may not travel straight down. Many females can also angle their urine away from the body by spreading the [[labia minora]] and, in some cases, orienting the [[pelvis]] at an angle.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://restrooms.org/standing.html |title=A Woman’s Guide on How to Pee Standing |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030604104917/http://restrooms.org/standing.html |archivedate = 2003-06-04}}</ref> Reports indicate that it is common that women in the [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivory Coast]] use this method when they urinate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelblog.org/Africa/Cote-d-Ivoire/South/Abidjan/blog-234347.html |title=Courtesy Laughs in the Ivory Coast |publisher=Travelblog.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> Some sources seem to indicate that women urinate this way in West Africa in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.experienceproject.com/mobile/stories/Pee/528391?aok=t |title=Women Standing and Men Squatting to Pee – A Personal Story (Mobile Version) |publisher=Experienceproject.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> Other reports indicate, however, that it seems to be less common for women to urinate standing in West Africa,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/crcl/vol40_1/ehrenreich.pdf |title=Intersex Surgery, Female Genital Cutting, and the Selective Condemnation of "Cultural Practices" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> while it has been reported that it is common that women urinate standing up in the streets in [[Malawi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sophie-jama.blogspot.com/ |title=Humble Beginnings |publisher=Sophie-jama.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> In Ghana, [[Sign (display device)|signs]] which forbid public urination often show a picture of a female urinating like this.<ref>http://www.bigfoto.com/africa/ghana/ghana-66.jpg</ref> [[Laos]] is a country where it is common for women to urinate standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelblog.org/Asia/blog-27609.html |title=Road to Hanoi |publisher=Travelblog.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> There are reports that seem to indicate that in [[Togo]] women urinate using this method, while men do it squatting.<ref>http://jetcityjimbo.net/awful_wonderful/45.shtml{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> [[Herodotus]] described a similar custom in [[ancient Egypt]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/arts/10conn.html|title=Herodotus – The Histories – Connections|publisher=The New York Times|date=10 December 2007|accessdate=23 January 2010 | first=Edward | last=Rothstein}}</ref>

===Urination after injury===
Occasionally, if a male's penis is damaged or removed, or a female's genitals/urinary tract is damaged, other urination techniques must be used. Most often in such cases, doctors will reposition the urethra to a location where urination can still be accomplished, usually in a position that would only promote urination while seated/squatting, though a permanent [[urinary catheterization|urinary catheter]] may be used in rare cases.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Facilities==

===Toilets===
[[Image:Philadelphia Public Toilet.jpg|thumb|Toilet outside the [[Philadelphia City Hall]]]]
It is socially more accepted and more environmentally hygienic for those who are able to urinate in a [[toilet]].

===Urinals===
{{Main|Urinal (restroom)}}
Public toilets may have [[Urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s, usually for males, although [[female urinal]]s exist, designed to be used in one of several ways.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>[http://www.travelmateinfo.com/page002.html] {{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

===Alternative urination tools===
{{see also|Female urination device}}
[[Image:Pot de chambre 4.jpg|thumb|Stacked chamber pots]]
Sometimes urination is done in a container such as a bottle, [[urinal (health care)|urinal]], bedpan or [[chamber pot]], also known as a [[Wikt:gazunder|gazunder]], e.g., in case of lying sick in bed, in the case that the urine has to be examined (for medical reasons, or for a [[Doping (Sport)|drug test]]), or when no toilet is available, and there is no other possibility to dispose of the urine right away.

For the latter application a more expensive solution (hence for special occasions while traveling etc.) is a special disposable bag containing absorbent material that solidifies the urine within ten seconds, making it convenient and safe to keep.

It is possible for both sexes to urinate into bottles in case of emergencies. The technique can help the sickly and the children to urinate discreetly inside cars and in other places without being seen by others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mypeepeebottle.com/how.html |title=Simple On-The-Go Potty and Hygiene Aid for Toddlers |publisher=My Pee Pee Bottle |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref>

==Social and cultural aspects==

===Toilet training===
Babies have little socialized control over urination within traditions or families that do not practice [[elimination communication]] and instead use [[diaper]]s.  [[Toilet training]] is the process of learning to restrict urination to socially approved times and situations. Consequently, young children sometimes suffer from [[nocturnal enuresis]].<ref>Review of Medical Physiology, twentieth edition, William F. Ganong, MD</ref>

===Urination without facilities===

Acceptability of outdoor urination in a public place other than at a public urinal varies with the situation and with customs. Potential disadvantages include a dislike of the smell of urine, and some exposure of genitals.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The latter can be unpleasant for the one who exposes them (modesty, lack of privacy) and/or those who can see them;{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  it can be avoided or mitigated by going to a quiet place and/or facing a tree or wall if urinating standing up, or while squatting, hiding the back behind walls, bushes, or a tree.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The more developed and crowded a place is the more urination tends to be objectionable. In the countryside, it is more acceptable than in a street in a town. In the latter case it is a common transgression. Often this is done after the consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. The alcohol causes production of additional urine as well as a reduction of [[Social inhibition|inhibition]]s. In many places, public urination is punishable by fine, though attitudes vary widely by country. It is often more accepted in Europe<ref>[http://www.rogerjstarkey.com/NonFiction/Relieved%20in%20Europe.htm ]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> and Asia<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Asia/Japan/Warnings_or_Dangers-Japan-TG-C-1.html |title=518 Tips on Japan Warnings or Dangers - Stay Safe! |publisher=Virtualtourist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> for males but tends to be socially objectionable for females in most customs.<ref>[http://www.yementimes.com/DefaultDET.aspx?i=1126&p=health&a=1 The appalling state of Sana’a school toilets]{{dead link|date=February 2013}} Yemen Times</ref><ref>[http://houseonahill.net/why-cant-men/ Why can’t men...??? — House on a hill]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/23/international/africa/23ethiopia.html?pagewanted=all|title=Another School Barrier for African Girls: No Toilet|last=Lafraniere|first=Sharon|date=23 December 2005|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thevoiceslu.com/let_and_op/2010/january/21_01_10/Peeing_in_public.htm Peeing in public] St. Lucia News</ref><ref>[http://www.rivierareporter.com/component/option,com_myblog/show,URINATION-EXPLANATION.html/Itemid,157/ Urination Explanation – why do Latin men pee in public?]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}.

At one time in the UK, it was legal for a man to urinate in public, so long as it occurred on the rear wheel of his vehicle and he had his right hand on the vehicle. The laws allowing this were the Hackney Carriage Laws, which were repealed in 1976.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fascinating Facts & Curious Questions|author=Capella|year=2006|page=44|chapter=Laughable  Laws|series=Incredible|isbn=1-84193-495-X}}</ref> Public urination still remains more accepted by males in the UK, although British cultural tradition itself seems to find such practices objectionable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2010/01/public-toilet-british-sex-piss|title=From buttoned-up Britain to urine nation|work=New Statesman|accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref> Depending on the culture, adult women, unlike men, are restricted in where they can urinate.<ref name=Doress-Worters>The new ourselves, growing older: women aging with knowledge and power, Paula Brown Doress-Worters, Diana Laskin Siegal, Boston Women's Health Book Collective, Simon & Schuster, 1994, Page 301</ref>

According to some medical studies, women generally need to urinate more frequently than men (due to women having smaller bladders in general). Resisting the urge to urinate because of lack of facilities can promote [[urinary tract infection]]s which can lead to more serious infections and, in rare situations, can cause [[Renal failure|renal damage]] in women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&p_id=24369 |title=06/07/2002 - Mobile crews must have prompt access to nearby toilet facilities |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urologychannel.com/uti/prevention.shtml |title=Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Prevention – Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) |publisher=Urologychannel.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> [[Female urination device]]s also claim to allow women to urinate discreetly.

===Talking about urination===
<!-- linked from redirect [[wee-wee]] -->
In many societies and in many social classes, even mentioning the need to urinate is seen as a [[faux pas|social transgression]], despite it being a universal need. Even today, many adults avoid stating that they need to urinate.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Many expressions exist, some [[euphemism|euphemistic]] and some vulgar. For example, centuries ago the standard English word (both noun and verb, for the product and the activity) was "[[wiktionary:piss|piss]]", but subsequently "pee", formerly associated with children, has become more common in general public speech. Since elimination of bodily wastes is, of necessity, a subject talked about with toddlers during [[toilet training]], other expressions considered suitable for use by and with children exist, and some continue to be used by adults, e.g. "weeing", "doing/having a wee-wee", "to tinkle", "[[potty]]".{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Other expressions include "squirting" and "taking a leak", and, predominantly by younger persons for outdoor female urination, "popping a squat", referring to the position many women adopt in such circumstances. National [[varieties of English]] show creativity. [[American English]] uses "to whiz". [[Australian English]] has coined "I am off to take a [[Music of China|Chinese singing]] lesson", derived from the tinkling sound of urination against the China porcelain of a toilet bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.definition-of.com/have+Chinese+singing+lesson |title=have Chinese singing lesson |publisher=Definition-of.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> [[British English]] uses "going to see my aunt", "going to [[see a man about a dog]]", "to piddle", "to splash (one's) boots", as well as "to have a slash", which originates from the [[Scottish English|Scottish term]] for a large splash of liquid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/have%20a%20slash |title=have a slash – Dictionary of sexual terms |publisher=Sex-lexis.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> One of the most common, albeit old-fashioned, euphemisms in British English is "to spend a penny", a reference to coin-operated [[pay toilet]]s, which used ([[Decimal Day|pre-decimalisation]]) to charge that sum.<ref>{{cite web|author=About the author... |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/spend-a-penny.html |title=Spend a penny |publisher=Phrases.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref>
====Use in language====
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
References to peeing and pissing are commonly used in [[slang]]. Usage includes:
*Piss (someone) off (to anger someone)
*Piss off! (to express contempt)
*Pissing down (to refer to heavy rain)
*[[Pissing contest]] (an unproductive ego-driven battle)
*Pisshead (vulgar way to refer to someone who drinks too much [[alcohol]])
*[[Pissant#Slang|Piss ant]] (a worthless person; in non-slang usage the term refers to several species of ant whose colonies have a urine-like odor)
*Pissing up a flagpole (to partake in a futile activity)
*Pissing into the wind (to act in ways that cause self-harm)
*Piss away  (to squander or use wastefully)
*[[Taking the piss]] (to take liberties, be unreasonable, or to mock another person)

===Urination and sexual activity===
[[Urolagnia]] is an inclination to obtain [[Human sexuality|sexual enjoyment]] by looking at or thinking of urine or urination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/urolagnia |title=Definition of urolagnia |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> As a [[paraphilia]], urine may be consumed, or the person may bathe in it. Drinking urine is known as [[urophagia]], though uraphagia refers to the consumption of urine regardless of whether the context is sexual. Involuntary urination during sexual intercourse is common, but rarely acknowledged. In one survey, 24% of women reported involuntary urination during sexual intercourse; in 66% of sufferers urination occurred on [[sexual penetration|penetration]], while in 33% urine leakage was restricted to orgasm.<ref>HILTON, P. (1988), Urinary incontinence during sexual intercourse: a common, but rarely volunteered, symptom. BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 95: 377–381. {{doi|10.1111/j.1471-0528.1988.tb06609.x}}</ref>

While the primary purpose of urination is the same across the [[Kingdom (biology)|animal kingdom]], urination often serves a social purpose beyond the expulsion of waste material. In dogs and other animals, urination can [[territorial marking|mark territory]] or express submissiveness. In small [[rodent]]s such as rats and mice, it marks familiar paths.

The urine and urination of animals of differing [[physiology]] or [[sex]] sometimes have different characteristics. For example, the urine of birds and reptiles is whitish, consisting of a pastelike suspension of uric acid crystals, and discharged with the [[feces]] of the animal via the [[cloaca]], whereas mammals' urine is a yellowish colour, with mostly [[urea]] instead of uric acid, and is discharged via the urethra, separately from the [[feces]]. Some animals' (example: [[carnivore]]s') urine possesses a strong odour, especially when it is used to mark territory or {{clarify span|communicate in other ways.|date=February 2013}}
