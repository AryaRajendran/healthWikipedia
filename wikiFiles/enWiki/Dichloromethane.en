'''Dichloromethane''' (DCM)—or '''methylene chloride'''—is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[Carbon|C]][[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>2</sub>[[Chlorine|Cl]]<sub>2</sub>. This colorless, volatile liquid with a moderately sweet aroma is widely used as a [[solvent]]. Although it is not [[miscible]] with water, it is miscible with many organic [[solvent]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>M. Rossberg et al. "Chlorinated Hydrocarbons" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_233.pub2}}</ref>

==History==
DCM was first prepared in 1840 by the [[France|French]] [[chemist]] [[Henri Victor Regnault]] (1810–1878), who isolated it from a mixture of [[chloromethane]] and [[chlorine]] that had been exposed to [[sunlight]].

==Production==
DCM is produced by [[chemical reaction|treating]] either [[methyl chloride]] or methane with chlorine gas at 400&ndash;500&nbsp;°C. At these temperatures, both [[methane]] and methyl chloride undergo a series of reactions producing progressively more chlorinated products.<ref name=Ullmann/>

:[[methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]] + [[chlorine|Cl<sub>2</sub>]] → [[methyl chloride|CH<sub>3</sub>Cl]] + [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]]
:CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + HCl
:CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → [[chloroform|CHCl<sub>3</sub>]] + HCl
:CHCl<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → [[carbon tetrachloride|CCl<sub>4</sub>]] + HCl
The output of these processes is a mixture of [[methyl chloride]], dichloromethane, [[chloroform]], and [[carbon tetrachloride]]. These compounds are separated by [[distillation]].

==Uses==
DCM's volatility and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes it a useful solvent for many chemical processes. Concerns about its health effects have led to a search for alternatives in many of these applications.<ref name=Ullmann/>

It is widely used as a [[paint stripper]] and a [[degreaser]]. In the [[food industry]], it has been used to [[decaffeination|decaffeinate]] [[coffee]] and [[tea]] as well as to prepare extracts of [[hops]] and other [[flavoring]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author = Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment|publisher = [[California Environmental Protection Agency]]|month = September|year = 2000|work = Public Health Goals for Chemicals in Drinking Water|title = Dichloromethane|url = http://www.oehha.ca.gov/water/phg/pdf/dcm.pdf}}</ref> Its volatility has led to its use as an [[Aerosol_spray#Aerosol propellants|aerosol spray propellant]] and as a [[blowing agent]] for [[polyurethane]] [[foam]]s.

===Specialized uses===
The chemical compound's low [[boiling point]] allows the chemical to function in a [[heat engine]] that can extract mechanical energy from small temperature differences. An example of a DCM heat engine is the [[drinking bird]]. The toy works at room temperature.

DCM chemically welds certain plastics. For example, it is used to seal the casing of electric meters. Often sold as a main component of [[plastic welding adhesive]]s, it is also used extensively by [[model building]] hobbyists for joining plastic components together. It is commonly referred to as "Di-clo."

It is used in the garment printing industry for removal of heat-sealed garment transfers, and its volatility is exploited in novelty items: [[bubble light]]s and [[jukebox]] displays.

DCM is used in the material testing field of [[civil engineering]]; specifically it is used during the testing of bituminous materials as a solvent to separate the binder from the aggregate of an [[asphalt]] or [[macadam]] to allow the testing of the materials.<ref>{{cite book|author = Shell Bitumen|title = The Shell Bitumen Handbook|url = http://books.google.com/?id=bA1tIkRJL8kC&pg=PA277&lpg=PA277&dq=aliquot+bitumen+solvent+methylene+chloride|isbn = 978-0-7277-3220-0|date = 2003-09-25|authorlink = Royal Dutch Shell}}</ref>

==Toxicity==
DCM is the least [[toxic]] of the simple [[:Category:Organochlorides|chlorohydrocarbons]], but it is not without health risks, as its high [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] makes it an acute inhalation hazard.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Rioux JP, Myers RA|title = Methylene chloride poisoning: a paradigmatic review|journal = J Emerg Med|volume = 6|issue = 3|pages = 227–238|year = 1988|pmid = 3049777|doi = 10.1016/0736-4679(88)90330-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author = CDC |title = Fatal Exposure to Methylene Chloride Among Bathtub Refinishers — United States, 2000–2011 |journal = MMWR|volume = 61|issue = 07|pages = 119–122|year = 2012}}</ref> DCM is also metabolized by the body to [[carbon monoxide]] potentially leading to [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].<ref>{{cite journal|author = Fagin J, Bradley J, Williams D|title = Carbon monoxide poisoning secondary to inhaling methylene chloride|journal = Br Med J|volume = 281|issue = 6253|pages = 1461|year = 1980|pmid = 7437838|doi = 10.1136/bmj.281.6253.1461|pmc = 1714874}}</ref> Acute exposure by inhalation has resulted in [[optic neuropathy]]<ref>{{cite journal|author = Kobayashi A, Ando A, Tagami N, Kitagawa M, Kawai E, Akioka M, Arai E, Nakatani T, Nakano S, Matsui Y, Matsumura M|title = Severe optic neuropathy caused by dichloromethane inhalation|journal = J Ocul Pharmacol and Ther|volume = 24|issue = 6|pages = 607–612|year = 2008|pmid = 19049266|doi = 10.1089/jop.2007.0100}}</ref> and [[hepatitis]].<ref>{{cite journal|author = Cordes DH, Brown WD, Quinn KM|title = Chemically induced hepatitis after inhaling organic solvents|journal = West J Med|volume = 148|issue = 4|pages = 458–460|year = 1988|pmid = 3388849|pmc = 1026148}}</ref> Prolonged skin contact can result in DCM dissolving some of the [[Adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] in skin, resulting in skin irritation or [[chemical burns]].<ref>{{cite journal|author = Wells G, Waldron H|title = Methylene chloride burns|journal = Br J Ind Med|volume = 41|issue = 3|pages = 420|year = 1984|pmid = 6743591|pmc = 1009322}}</ref>

In many countries, products containing DCM must carry labels warning of its health risks.

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Parliament]] voted in 2009 to ban the use of DCM in paint-strippers for consumers and many professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/064-46096-012-01-03-911-20090113IPR46095-12-01-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm|title=Dichloromethane to be banned in paint-strippers|date=2009-01-14|accessdate=2009-01-15}}</ref> The ban took effect in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:086:0007:0012:EN:PDF|title=COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 276/2010 (Official Journal of the European Union, L 86/7)|date=2010-04-01|accessdate=2012-02-07}}</ref>

In Europe, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits ([[SCOEL]]) recommends for DCM an [[occupational exposure limit]] (8h time-weighted average) of 100 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 200 ppm.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/social/keyDocuments.jsp?type=0&policyArea=82&subCategory=153&country=0&year=0&advSearchKey=recommendation&mode=advancedSubmit&langId=en|title=SCOEL recommendations|date=2011-04-22|accessdate=2011-04-22}}</ref>

In February 2013, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] warned that 14 bathtub refinishers have died since 2000 from DCM exposure.<ref name="quicktake020113">[http://www.osha.gov/as/opa/quicktakes/qt02012013.html OSHA QuickTakes], February 1, 2013;</ref><ref name="mchazardalert">[http://www.osha.gov/dts/hazardalerts/methylene_chloride_hazard_alert.html Methylene Chloride Hazards for Bathtub Refinishers]</ref>
