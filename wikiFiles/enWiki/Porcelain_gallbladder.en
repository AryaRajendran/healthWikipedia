'''Porcelain gallbladder''' is a [[calcification]] of the [[gallbladder]] believed to be brought on by excessive [[gallstone]]s, although the exact [[etiology|cause]] is not clear. As with gallstone disease in general, this condition occurs predominantly in overweight female patients of middle age. It is a morphological variant of chronic cholecystitis. Inflammatory scarring of the wall, combined with dystrophic calcification within the wall transforms the gallbladder into a porcelain-like vessel.

==Association with cancer==
Porcelain gallbladder is associated with [[gallbladder cancer]], but the precise nature of the association is uncertain. Two review articles examined the association between cancer of the gallbladder and calcified gallbladder. One study reported an incidence of gallbladder cancer of about 1% in patients with calcified gallbladder.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Another study found that of 69 calcified gallbladders, 3 of them contained cancer.<ref name=pmid11206901>{{cite journal |pmid=11206901 |year=2001 |last1=Towfigh |first1=S |last2=McFadden |first2=DW |last3=Cortina |first3=GR |last4=Thompson Jr |first4=JE |last5=Tompkins |first5=RK |last6=Chandler |first6=C |last7=Hines |first7=OJ |title=Porcelain gallbladder is not associated with gallbladder carcinoma |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=7–10 |journal=The American surgeon}}</ref><ref name=pmid11391368>{{cite journal |doi=10.1067/msy.2001.113888 |title=Carcinoma in the porcelain gallbladder: A relationship revisited |year=2001 |last1=Stephen |first1=Antonia E. |last2=Berger |first2=David L. |journal=Surgery |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=699–703 |pmid=11391368}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
Symptoms can include [[abdominal pain]] (especially after eating), [[jaundice]], and [[vomiting]]. First symptom to appear is jaundice followed by right upper quadrant pain.

==Diagnosis==
Abdominal [[radiography]] (X-ray), abdominal [[ultrasound]] or [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]].

==Treatment==
Due to the increased risk for gallbladder cancer, the recommended treatment is cholecystectomy which usually includes pre-operative or intra-operative imaging of the biliary tree. Cholecystectomy may be performed via an open incision or via laparoscopic methods, but gallbladder anatomy and consistency may complicate the operation.<ref>Tomioka T, Tajima Y, Inoue K, Onizuka S, Ikematsu Y, Kanematsu T. "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe procedure for the treatment of porcelain gallbladder."</ref>
