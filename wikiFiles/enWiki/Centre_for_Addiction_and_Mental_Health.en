The '''Centre for Addiction and Mental Health''' ('''CAMH''') is a consortium of [[mental health]] clinics at several sites in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Its name in French is Centre de toxicomanie et de santé mentale. (The acronym CAMH is most commonly pronounced "Cam-H".)

Among the focuses of the organization are the assessment and treatment of [[schizophrenia]], [[mood disorder|mood]] & [[anxiety disorder]]s, and [[personality disorder]]s.  There is also a focus on [[Substance dependence|addictions]] to alcohol, drugs, and [[problem gambling]] at the former ARF site.  CAMH also has a Law and Mental Health Programme ([[forensic psychiatry]] and [[forensic psychology]]) and is a major research centre.

CAMH is a [[teaching hospital]] with central facilities located in [[Toronto]] and 26 community locations throughout the province of [[Ontario]]. CAMH is fully affiliated with the [[University of Toronto]] and is a [[Pan American Health Organization]] and [[World Health Organization]] Collaborating Centre.

In October 2008, CAMH was named one of "[[Canada's Top 100 Employers]]" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in ''[[Maclean's]]'' newsmagazine. Later that month, CAMH was also named one of [[Greater Toronto's Top Employers]], which was announced by the [[Toronto Star]] newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-centre-for-addiction-and-mental-health|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 Canada's Top 100 Employers Competition}}</ref> CAMH was the recipient of the Greater Toronto Top Employer Award in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and in 2010 won as one of Canada's Best Diversity Employers.

==Facilities==
CAMH was formed in 1998 as a result of the merger of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, the Addiction Research Foundation, the Donwood Institute and Queen Street Mental Health Centre.<ref name="scrivener2007">Scrivener, Leslie (February 25, 2007).

===Clarke Institute of Psychiatry===
[[Image:CAMH Toronto6520.jpg|right|thumb|200px|CAMH [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] site]]
[[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (College Street site)|The hospital]] was founded in 1966 and named the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, after [[Charles Kirk Clarke]], a pioneer in mental health in Canada.

The former Clarke Institute building is now referred to as the College St. site of CAMH.

===Addiction Research Foundation===
The Addiction Research Foundation (ARF), then named the Alcoholism Research Foundation was founded in 1949, when H. David Archibald, who had studied at the [[School of Alcohol Studies]] at [[Yale University]], was hired by the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]]. His mandate was to determine the scope of alcoholism in Ontario. He was named executive director when ARF opened and remained in that post until 1976. Focusing initially on outpatient treatment, their first facility was [[Brookside Hospital]] in 1951, expanding to branch offices and new locations in 1954, the same year they set up in-house research. In 1961, formally renamed the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Reseach Fondation of Ontario, ARF expanded its mission to include drugs. In 1971, they expanded to a clinical teaching hospital called the [[Clinical Research and Treatment Institute]]. In 1978 ARF opened the [[School for Addiction Studies]] and expanded their international role in policy rdevelopment and research. Following ongoing recession in the 1990s, ARF was folded in 1998 into CAMH.<ref name="blocker2003">Blocker JS, Fahey DM, Tyrrell IR.

===CAMH Redevelopment===
CAMH has been undergoing a 3 phase redevelopment plan which aims to accomplish 4 goals:
1) Deliver a new model of care and provide a healthy environment that promotes recovery;
2) Bring together the best research, clinical, education, health promotion, and policy experts in one place to change the future of mental health and addictions;
3) Revitalize the City of Toronto by opening up their site and by creating an inclusive new nine-block neighbourhood that benefits all and,
4) Change attitudes by breaking down barriers to eliminate the stigma of mental health.<ref>http://www.camh.net/News_events/Redeveloping_the_Queen_Street_site/index.html</ref>
