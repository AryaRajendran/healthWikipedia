The '''Rh (Rhesus) blood group system''' (including the '''Rh factor''') is one of thirty current [[human blood group systems]]. Clinically, it is the most important blood group system after [[ABO blood group system|ABO]]. At present, the Rh blood group system consists of 50 defined blood-group [[antigens]], among which the five antigens D, P, c, E, and e are the most important. The commonly used terms ''Rh factor'', '' Rh positive'' and ''Rh negative'' refer to the ''D antigen'' only. Besides its role in [[blood transfusion]], the Rh blood group system—specifically, the D antigen—is used to determine the risk of [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]] (or [[erythroblastosis fetalis]]) as [[Rh disease#Prevention|prevention]] is key.

==Rh factor==
An individual either has, or does not have, the "''Rhesus factor''" on the surface of their [[red blood cell]]s. This term strictly refers only to the most immunogenic D antigen of the Rh blood group system, or the Rh- blood group system. The status is usually indicated by ''Rh positive'' (Rh+ does have the D antigen) or ''Rh negative'' (Rh- does not have the D antigen) suffix to the [[ABO blood group system|ABO]] [[blood type]]. However, other antigens of this blood group system are also clinically relevant. These antigens are listed separately (''see below: [[#Rh nomenclature|Rh nomenclature]]''). In contrast to the ABO blood group, immunization against Rh can generally only occur through [[blood transfusion]] or placental exposure during pregnancy in women.

==History of discoveries==
In 1939, Drs. [[Philip Levine (physician)|Philip Levine]] and Rufus Stetson published in a first case report the clinical consequences of non-recognized ''Rh factor'', hemolytic [[transfusion reaction]] and [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]] in its most severe form.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Levine P, Stetson RE |title=An unusual case of intragroup agglutination |journal=JAMA |volume=113 |issue= |pages=126–7 |year=1939}}</ref> It was recognized that the serum of the reported woman [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinated]] with [[red blood cells]] of about 80% of the people although the then known blood groups, in particular [[ABO blood group system|ABO]] were matched. No name was given to this then for the first time described [[antibody|agglutinin]]. In 1940, Drs. [[Karl Landsteiner]] and [[Alexander S. Wiener]] reported a serum that also reacted with about 85% of different human red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Landsteiner K, Wiener AS |title=An agglutinable factor in human blood recognized by immune sera for rhesus blood |journal=Proc Soc Exp Biol Med |volume=43 |issue= |pages=223–4 |year=1940}}</ref> This serum was produced by immunizing rabbits with red blood cells from [[Rhesus macaque]]. The antigen that induced this immunization was designated by them as ''Rh factor'' "to indicate that ''rhesus'' blood had been used for the production of the serum."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Landsteiner K, Wiener AS |title=Studies on an agglutinogen (Rh) in human blood reacting with anti-rhesus sera and with human isoantibodies |journal=J Exp Med |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=309–320 |year=1941 |doi=10.1084/jem.74.4.309 |pmid=19871137 |pmc=2135190}}</ref>

Based on the serologic similarities ''Rh factor'' was later also used for antigens, and ''anti-Rh'' for antibodies, found in humans such as the previously described by Levine and Stetson. Although differences between these two sera were shown already in 1942 and clearly demonstrated in 1963, the already widely used term "Rh" was kept for the clinically described human antibodies which are different from the ones related to the Rhesus monkey. This real factor found in [[Rhesus macaque]] was classified in the [[Landsteiner-Wiener antigen system]] (antigen LW, antibody anti-LW) in honor of the discoverers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Avent ND, Reid ME |title=The Rh blood group system: a review |journal=Blood |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=375–387|year=2000 |pmid=10627438}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Scott ML |title=The complexities of the Rh system |journal=Vox sang |volume=87 |issue=(Suppl. 1) |pages=S58–S62|year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1741-6892.2004.00431.x}}</ref>
It was recognized that the ''Rh factor'' was just one in a system of various antigens. Based on different models of genetic inheritance, two different terminologies were developed; both of them are still in use 

The clinical significance of this highly immunizing D antigen (i.e. Rh factor) was soon realized. Some keystones were to recognize its importance for blood transfusion including reliable diagnostic tests, and hemolytic disease of the newborn including [[exchange transfusion]] and very importantly the prevention of it by screening and [[Rhesus_disease#Prevention|prophylaxis]].

The discovery of fetal free DNA in maternal circulation by Holzgrieve et al. led to the noninvasive genotyping of fetal Rh genes in many countries.

==Rh nomenclature==
The Rh blood group system has two sets of nomenclatures: one developed by [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[R.R. Race]], the other by {{visible anchor|Wiener}}. Both systems reflected alternative theories of inheritance. The Fisher-Race system, which is more commonly in use today, uses the CDE nomenclature. This system was based on the theory that a separate [[gene]] controls the product of each corresponding antigen (e.g., a "D gene" produces D antigen, and so on). However, the d gene was hypothetical, not actual.

The Wiener system used the Rh-Hr nomenclature. This system was based on the theory that there was one gene at a single locus on each chromosome, each contributing to production of multiple antigens. In this theory, a gene R<sub>1</sub> is supposed to give rise to the “blood factors” Rh<sub>0</sub>, rh’, and hr” (corresponding to modern nomenclature of the D, C and e antigens) and the gene r to produce hr’ and hr” (corresponding to modern nomenclature of the c and e antigens).<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Weiner | first = Alexander S. | authorlink = Alexander S. Weiner | title = Genetics and Nomenclature of the Rh-Hr Blood Types | journal = Antonie van Leeuwenhoek | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–28 | publisher = Springerlink | location = Netherlands | date = 1 February 1949 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4lg46567q12j8ul/ | issn = 0003-6072 | doi = 10.1007/BF02062626  | accessdate = 6 November 2010}}</ref>

Notations of the two theories are used interchangeably in blood banking (e.g., Rho(D) meaning RhD positive).  Wiener's notation is more complex and cumbersome for routine use. Because it is simpler to explain, the Fisher-Race theory has become more widely used.

DNA testing has shown that both theories are partially correct.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} There are in fact two linked genes, the ''[[RHD (gene)|RHD]]'' gene which produces a single immune specificity (anti-D) and the ''[[RHCE (gene)|RHCE]]'' gene with multiple specificities (anti-C, anti-c, anti-E, anti-e). Thus, Wiener's postulate that a gene could have multiple specificities (something many did not give credence to originally) has been proven correct. On the other hand, Wiener's theory that there is only one gene has proven incorrect, as has the Fischer-Race theory that there are three genes, rather than the 2. The CDE notation used in the Fisher-Race nomenclature is sometimes rearranged to DCE to more accurately represent the co-location of the C and E encoding on the RhCE gene, and to make interpretation easier.

==Rh system antigens==
The proteins which carry the Rh antigens are [[transmembrane protein]]s, whose structure suggest that they are [[ion channel]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gv/mhc/xslcgi.cgi?cmd=bgmut/systems_info&system=rh |title=dbRBC - Blood Group Antigen Gene Mutation Database |publisher=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-06-15 }}</ref> The main antigens are D, C, E, c and e, which are encoded by two adjacent gene loci, the ''RHD'' gene which encodes the RhD protein with the D antigen (and variants)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?itool=omim_Detailed&DbFrom=omim&Cmd=Link&LinkName=omim_gene&IdsFromResult=111680 |title=RHD Rh blood group, D antigen [Homo sapiens] - Gene Result |publisher=nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-06-15 }}</ref> and the ''RHCE'' gene which encodes the RhCE protein with the C, E, c and e antigens (and variants).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=6006&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Gene.Gene_ResultsPanel.Gene_RVDocSum |title=RHCE Rh blood group, CcEe antigens [Homo sapiens] - Gene Result |publisher=nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2010-06-15 }}</ref> There is no d antigen. Lowercase "d" indicates the absence of the D antigen (the gene is usually deleted or otherwise nonfunctional).

Rh phenotypes are readily identified by identifying the presence or absence of the Rh surface antigens. As can be seen in the table below, most of the Rh phenotypes can be produced by several different Rh genotypes. The exact genotype of any individual can only be identified by DNA analysis. Regarding patient treatment, only the phenotype is usually of any clinical significance to ensure a patient is not exposed to an antigen they are likely to develop antibodies against. A probable genotype may be speculated on, based on the statistical distributions of genotypes in the patient's place of origin.

==Hemolytic disease of the newborn==
{{Main|Hemolytic disease of the newborn}}
The hemolytic condition occurs when there is an incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and the fetus.  There is also potential incompatibility if the mother is Rh negative and the father is positive.  When any incompatibility is detected, the mother receives an injection at 28 weeks gestation and at birth to avoid the development of antibodies toward the fetus.  These terms do not indicate which specific antigen-antibody incompatibility is implicated.  The disorder in the fetus due to Rh D incompatibility is known as ''erythroblastosis fetalis''.

:* ''Hemolytic'' comes from two words: "''hemo''" (blood) and "''lysis''" (destruction) or breaking down of red blood cells
:* ''Erythroblastosis'' refers to the making of immature red blood cells
:* ''Fetalis'' refers to the fetus.

When the condition is caused by the Rh D antigen-antibody incompatibility, it is called '''Rh D Hemolytic disease of the newborn''' (often called '''Rhesus disease''' or '''Rh disease''' for brevity).  Here, sensitization to Rh D antigens (usually by feto-maternal transfusion during pregnancy) may lead to the production of maternal [[IgG]] anti-D antibodies which can pass through the [[placenta]].  This is of particular importance to D negative females at or below childbearing age, because any subsequent pregnancy may be affected by the [[Rhesus D hemolytic disease of the newborn]] if the baby is D positive.  The vast majority of [[Rh disease]] is preventable in modern [[antenatal]] care by injections of IgG anti-D antibodies ([[Rho(D) Immune Globulin]]).  The incidence of Rhesus disease is mathematically related to the frequency of D negative individuals in a population, so Rhesus disease is rare in [[East Asian]]s, [[South American]]s, and [[Africans]], but more common in [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]].

*'''Symptoms and signs in the fetus''':
** Enlarged liver, spleen, or heart and fluid buildup in the fetus' abdomen seen via ultrasound.

*'''Symptoms and signs in the newborn''':
** '''[[Anemia]]''' that creates the newborn's pallor (pale appearance).
** '''[[Jaundice]]''' or yellow discoloration of the newborn's skin, sclera or mucous membrane. This may be evident right after birth or after 24–48 hours after birth. This is caused by [[bilirubin]] (one of the end products of red blood cell destruction).
** Enlargement of the newborn's liver and spleen.
** The newborn may have '''severe [[edema]]''' of the entire body.
** '''Dyspnea''' or difficulty breathing.

==Population data==
The frequency of Rh factor blood types and the RhD neg [[allele]] gene differs in various populations.

==Inheritance==
The D antigen is inherited as one gene ([[RHD (gene)|RHD]]) (on the short arm of the [[Chromosome 1 (human)|first chromosome]], p36.13-p34.3) with various alleles. Though very much simplified, one can think of alleles that are positive or negative for the D antigen. The gene codes for the RhD [[protein]] on the red cell membrane. D- individuals who lack a functional ''RHD'' gene do not produce the D antigen, and may be immunized by D+ blood.

The [[epitope]]s for the next 4 most common Rh antigens, C, c, E and e are expressed on the highly similar RhCE protein that is genetically encoded in the ''RHCE'' gene, also cound on chromosome 1. It has been shown that the ''RHD'' gene arose by duplication of the ''RHCE'' gene during primate evolution. Mice have just one RH gene.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wagner FF, Flegel WA |title=RHCE represents the ancestral RH position, while RHD is the duplicated gene |journal=Blood |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=2272–3 |year=2002 |month=Mar |pmid=11902138 |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11902138 |doi=10.1182/blood-2001-12-0153}}</ref>

The RHAG gene, responsible for encoding Rh-associated glycoprotein (RhAG) is found on chromosome 6.  

The polypeptides produced from the RHD and RHCE genes form a complex on the red blood cell membrane with the Rh-associated glycoprotein. <ref> Mais, DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Chicago, ASCP Press, 2009. </ref>

RhD-negative compared to RhD-positive subjects without [[Medical history|anamnestic]] titres of anti-''[[Toxoplasma]]'' antibodies have shorter reaction times in tests of simple reaction times. And conversely, RhD-negative subjects with anamnestic titres (i.e. with latent toxoplasmosis) exhibited much longer reaction times than their RhD-positive counterparts. The published data suggested that only the protection of RhD-positive heterozygotes was long term in nature; the protection of RhD-positive [[homozygote]]s decreased with duration of the infection while the performance of RhD-negative homozygotes decreased immediately after the infection.

==Origin of RHD polymorphism==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2009}}
For a long time, the origin of RHD polymorphism was an evolutionary enigma.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Haldane JBF |title=Selection against heterozygosis in Man. |journal=Eugenics |volume=11 |pages=333–340 |year=1942 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fisher RA, Race RR, Taylor GL. |title=Mutation and the Rhesus reaction |journal=Nature |volume=153 |pages=106 |year=1944 | doi = 10.1038/153106b0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Li CC |title=Is the Rh facing a crossroad? A critique of the compensation effect. |journal=Am Naturalist. |volume=87 |pages=257–261 |year=1953 |doi=10.1086/281782 }}</ref> Before the advent of modern medicine, the carriers of the rarer allele (e.g. RhD-negative women in a population of RhD positives or RhD-positive men in a population of RhD negatives) were at a disadvantage as some of their children (RhD-positive children born to preimmunised RhD-negative mothers) were at a higher risk of fetal or newborn death or health impairment from hemolytic disease. It was suggested that higher tolerance of RhD-positive heterozygotes against ''[[Toxoplasma]]''-induced impairment of reaction time <ref name=Novotna08/><ref name=Flegr08/> and ''Toxoplasma''-induced increase of risk of traffic accident<ref name="Flegr, J., Klose, J., Novotna, M., Berenreitterová, M. Havlicek, J. 2009 72"/> could counterbalance the disadvantage of the rarer allele and could be responsible both for the initial spread of the RhD allele among the RhD-negative population and for a stable RhD polymorphism in most human populations. It was also suggested that differences in the prevalence of ''Toxoplasma'' infection between geographical regions (0–95%) could also explain the striking variation in the frequency of RhD-negative alleles between populations. According to some parasitologists <ref name=Novotna08/> it is possible that the better psychomotor performance of RhD-negative subjects in the ''Toxoplasma''-free population could be the reason for spreading of the “d allele” (deletion) in the European population. In contrast to the situation in Africa and certain (but not all) regions of Asia, the abundance of wild cats (definitive hosts of ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'') in Europe was very low before the advent of the domestic cat.

==Weak D==

In serologic testing, D positive blood is easily identified.  Units which are D negative are often retested to rule out a weaker reaction. This was previously referred to as D<sup>u</sup>, which has been replaced.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mark E. Brecher |title=Technical Manual |publisher=American Association of Blood Banks |location=Bethesda MD |year=2005 |pages=322 |isbn=1-56395-196-7 |edition=15th}}</ref> By definition, weak D phenotype is characterized by negative reaction with anti-D reagent at immediate spin (IS), negative reaction after 37C incubation, and positive reaction at anti-human globulin (AHG) phase. Weak D phenotype can occur in several ways. In some cases, this phenotype occurs because of an altered surface protein that is more common in people of European descent. An inheritable form also occurs, most often in African-Americans, as a result of a weakened form of the R0 gene. Weak D may also occur as "C in trans," whereby a C gene is present on the opposite chromosome to a D gene (as in the combination R0r’, or "Dce/dCe").  The testing is difficult, since using different anti-D reagents, especially the older polyclonal reagents, may give different results.

The practical implication of this is that people with this sub-phenotype will have a product labeled as "D positive" when donating blood.  When receiving blood, they are sometimes typed as a "D negative", though this is the subject of some debate.  Most "Weak D" patients can receive "D positive" blood without complications.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mark E. Brecher |title=Technical Manual |publisher=American Association of Blood Banks |location=Bethesda MD |year=2005 |pages=323 |isbn=1-56395-196-7 |edition=15th}}</ref> However, it is important to correctly identify the ones that have to be considered D+ or D-. This is important, since most blood banks have a limited supply of "D negative" blood and the correct transfusion is clinically relevant. In this respect, [[Blood_type#Blood_group_genotyping|genotyping of blood groups]] has much simplified this detection of the various variants in the Rh blood group system.

== Partial D ==
It is important to differentiate weak D (due to a ''quantitative'' difference in the D antigen) from partial D (due to a ''qualitative'' difference in the D antigen).  Simply put, the weak D phenotype is due to a reduced number of D antigens on a red blood cell.  In contrast, the partial D phenotype is due to an alteration in D-epitopes.  Thus, in partial D, the number of D antigens is not reduced but the protein structure is altered.  These individuals, if alloimmunized to D, can produce an anti-D antibody.  Therefore, partial D patients who are donating blood should be labeled as D-positive but, if receiving blood, they should be labeled as D-negative and receive D-negative units.<ref> Mais, DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Chicago, ASCP Press, 2009. </ref>

In the past, partial D was called 'D mosaic' or 'D variant.'  Different partial D phenotypes are defined by different D epitopes on the outer surface of the red blood cell membrane.  More than 30 different partial D phenotypes have been described.<ref> Mais, DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Chicago, ASCP Press, 2009. </ref>

== Rh Null Phenotype ==
Rh null individuals have no Rh antigens (no Rh or RhAG) on their red blood cells.  As a consequence of the absence of Rh antigens, Rh null red blood cells also lack LW and Fy5 and show weak expression of S, s, and U antigens.

Red blood cells lacking Rh/RhAG proteins have structural abnormalities (such as stomatocytosis) which can result in hemomlytic anemia.<ref> Mais, DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Chicago, ASCP Press, 2009. </ref>

==Other Rh group antigens==

Currently, 50 antigens have been described in the Rh group system; among those described here, the D, C, c, E and e antigens are the most important. The others are much less frequently encountered or are rarely clinically significant. Each is given a number, though the highest assigned number (CEST or RH57 according to the [[International Society of Blood Transfusion|ISBT]] terminology) is not an accurate reflection of the antigens encountered since many (e.g. Rh38) have been combined, reassigned to other groups, or otherwise removed.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mark E. Brecher |title=Technical Manual |publisher=American Association of Blood Banks |location=Bethesda MD |year=2005 |pages=324 |isbn=1-56395-196-7 |edition=15th}}</ref>

== Rh Antibodies ==
Rh antibodies are IgG antibodies which are acquired through exposure to Rh-positive blood (generally either through pregnancy or transfusion of blood products).  The D antigen is the most immunogenic of all the non-ABO antigens.  Approximately 80% of individuals who are D-negative and exposed to a single D-positive unit will produce an anti-D antibody.  The percentage of alloimmunization is significantly reduced in patients who are actively exsanguinating (some say to approx 15%)<ref> Roback et al. AABB Technical Manual, 16th Ed. Bethesda, AABB Press, 2008. </ref>

All Rh antibodies ''except'' D display dosage (antibody reacts more stongly with red cells homozygous for an antigen than cells heterozygous for the antigen (EE stronger reaction vs Ee).

Rh antibodies are capable of causing [[hemolytic transfusion reactions]] with extravascular hemolysis.  They may also result in severe [[hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn]] (HDFN or HDN).  

If anti-E is detected, the presence of anti-c should be strongly suspected (due to combined genetic inheritance).  It is therefore common to select c-negative and E-negative blood for transfusion patients who have an anti-E.  Anti-c is a common cause of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions.<ref> Mais, DD. ASCP Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology, 2nd Ed. Chicago, ASCP Press, 2009. </ref>
