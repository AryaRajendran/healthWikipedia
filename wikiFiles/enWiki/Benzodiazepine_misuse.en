'''Benzodiazepine drug misuse''', sometimes called '''benzodiazepine drug abuse''' (both terms are merely nominal, and cover all non-medical uses of the drugs), is defined as using [[benzodiazepine]]s for recreational purposes i.e. to get "high" or continuing benzodiazepines long term against medical advice.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-first = P. | editor1-last = Tyrer | editor2-first = K.

A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were drug abusers than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, halazepam, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard.<ref name="pmid1981067">{{cite journal | author = Griffiths, R.

Benzodiazepines have been abused both orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential; the more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was ‘strong’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.<ref name="Australian Government 2006">{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ni/2006-175/current/pdf/2006-175.pdf | title = ACT MEDICAL BOARD&nbsp;– STANDARDS STATEMENT&nbsp;– PRESCRIBING OF BENZODIAZEPINES | accessdate = 13 September 2011 | author = Australian Government | authorlink = Australian Government | coauthors = Medical Board | year = 2006 | format = pdf | publisher = ACT medical board | location = Australia }}</ref>

According to Dr Chris Ford, former clinical director of Substance Misuse Management in General Practice, among [[drugs of abuse]], benzodiazepines are often seen as the 'bad guys' by drug and alcohol workers. Illicit users of benzodiazepines have been found to take higher methadone doses, as well as showing more HIV/HCV risk-taking behaviour, greater poly-drug use, higher levels of psychopathology and social dysfunction. However, there is only limited research into the adverse effects of benzodiazepines in drug misusers and further research is needed to demonstrate whether this is the result of cause or effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exchangesupplies.org/conferences/NDTC/2009_NDTC/speakers/chris_ford.html |title=What is possible with benzodiazepines |author=Chris Ford |year=2009 |publisher=Exchange Supplies, 2009 National Drug Treatment Conference |location=UK }}</ref>

==Background==
Benzodiazepines are a commonly abused class of drugs, although there is debate as to whether certain benzodiazepines have higher abuse potential than others.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Dart | first1 = R. C. | title = Medical Toxicology | url = http://books.google.com/?id=qDf3AO8nILoC | edition = 3rd | year = 2003 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = USA | isbn = 978-0-7817-2845-4 | page = 819 }}</ref> In animal and human studies the abuse potential of benzodiazepines is classed as moderate in comparison to other drugs of abuse.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Griffiths, R. R.; Weerts, E. M. |title = Benzodiazepine Self-Administration in Humans and Laboratory Animals&nbsp;– Implications for Problems of Long-Term Use and Abuse | journal = Psychopharmacology (Berl.) | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–37 | year = 1997 | month = November | pmid = 9399364 | doi = 10.1007/s002130050422 | url = http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00213/bibs/7134001/71340001.htm }}</ref>
Benzodiazepines are commonly abused by [[poly drug users]], especially heroin [[Substance dependence|addicts]] or [[alcoholics]] but sometimes are misused in isolation as the primary drug of misuse. They can be misused to achieve the high that benzodiazepines produce or more commonly they are used to either enhance the effects of other [[CNS depressant]] drugs, to stave off [[withdrawal]] effects of other drugs or combat the effects of [[stimulant]]s. As many as 30–50% of alcoholics are also benzodiazepine misusers.<ref name=baashton>{{cite web |url = http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashbzab.htm | title = BENZODIAZEPINE ABUSE | work = Drugs and Dependence | accessdate = 25 September 2007 | author = Ashton, C. H. | year = 2002 | publisher = Harwood Academic Publishers }}</ref> Drug abusers often abuse high doses which makes serious [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] symptoms such as [[psychosis]] or [[convulsion]]s more likely to occur during withdrawal.

Benzodiazepine abuse increases risk taking behaviours such as unprotected sex and sharing of needles amongst intravenous abusers of benzodiazepines. Abuse is also associated with blackouts, memory loss, aggression, violence, and chaotic behaviour associated with paranoia. There is little support for long-term maintenance of benzodiazepine abusers and thus a withdrawal regime is indicated when benzodiazepine abuse becomes a [[physical dependence|dependence]] or [[Substance dependence|addiction]]. The main source of illicit benzodiazepines are diverted benzodiazepines obtained originally on prescription; other sources include thefts from pharmacies and pharmaceutical warehouses. Benzodiazepine abuse is steadily increasing and is now a major public health problem. Benzodiazepine abuse is mostly limited to individuals who abuse other drugs, i.e. poly-drug abusers. Most prescribed users do not abuse their medication, however, some high dose prescribed users do become involved with the illicit drug scene. Abuse of benzodiazepines occurs in a wide age range of people and includes teenagers and the old. The abuse potential or drug-liking effects appears to be dose related, with low doses of benzodiazepines having limited drug liking effects but higher doses increasing the abuse potential/drug-liking properties.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Caan | editor2-first = J. | editor2-last = de Belleroche | title = Drink, Drugs and Dependence: From Science to Clinical Practice | url = http://books.google.com/?id=nPvbDUw4w5QC | edition = 1st | year = 2002 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0-415-27891-1 | pages = 197–211 | chapter = Benzodiazepine Abuse | chapterurl = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nPvbDUw4w5QC&pg=PA197 }}</ref>

==Health related complications==
{{See also|Long-term effects of benzodiazepines}}
Complications of benzodiazepine abuse include drug-related deaths due to overdose especially in combination with other depressant drugs such as [[opioids]]. Other complications include:  [[Fainting|blackouts]] and [[memory loss]],  [[paranoia]], violence and [[criminal behaviour]], risk-taking sexual behaviour, foetal and neonatal risks if taken in pregnancy,  [[drug dependence|dependence]], withdrawal [[seizure]]s and [[psychosis]]. Injection of the drug carries risk of: [[thrombophlebitis]], [[deep vein thrombosis]], deep and superficial [[abscess]]es, [[pulmonary]] [[microembolism]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[tissue necrosis]], [[gangrene]] requiring amputation, [[hepatitis]] B and C,  as well as blood borne infections such as [[HIV infection]] (caused by sharing injecting equipment).<ref name=baashton /> [[Long-term use of benzodiazepines]] can worsen pre-existing depression and [[anxiety]] and may potentially also cause dementia with impairments in recent and remote memory functions.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Galanter | first1 = M. |last2 = Kleber | first2 = H.

Use is widespread among [[amphetamine]] users, with those that use amphetamines and benzodiazepines having greater levels of mental health problems and social deterioration. Benzodiazepine injectors are almost four times more likely to inject using a shared needle than non-benzodiazepine-using injectors. It has been concluded in various studies that benzodiazepine use causes greater levels of risk and psycho-social dysfunction among drug misusers.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Darke, S.; Ross, J.; Cohen, J. | title = The Use of Benzodiazepines among Regular Amphetamine Users | journal = [[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 1683–1690 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7866252 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1994.tb03769.x }}</ref>
Poly-drug users who also use benzodiazepines appear to engage in more risk taking behavior. Those who use stimulant and depressant drugs are more likely to report adverse reactions from stimulant use, more likely to be injecting [[stimulant]]s and more likely to have been treated for a drug problem than those using stimulant but not [[depressant]] drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Williamson, S.; Gossop, M.; Powis, B.; Griffiths, P.; Fountain, J.; Strang, J. | title = Adverse effects of stimulant drugs in a community sample of drug users | journal = Drug and  Alcohol Dependence | volume = 44 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 87–94 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9088780 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-8716(96)01324-5 }}</ref>

==Rates of misuse==
Little attention has focused on the degree that benzodiazepines are abused as a primary drug of choice, but they are frequently abused alongside other drugs of abuse, especially alcohol, stimulants and opiates.<ref name=dah2006>{{cite book |last1 = Karch | first1 = S.

A 2004 US government study of nationwide ED visits conducted by [[SAMHSA]] found that sedative-hypnotics in the USA are the most frequently misused pharmaceutical drug with 35% of drug-related visits to the Emergency Department involving sedative hypnotics. Benzodiazepines accounted for the majority of these. Benzodiazepines are more commonly misused than opiate pharmaceuticals which accounted for 32% of visits to the emergency department. Males and females misuse benzodiazepines equally. Of drugs used in attempted suicide, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used pharmaceutical drug with 26% of attempted suicides involving benzodiazepines. Alprazolam is the most commonly misused benzodiazepine, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam and diazepam as the 4th in the USA.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/files/DAWN2k4ED.htm | title = Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2004: National Estimates of Drug-Related Emergency Department Visits | accessdate = 9 May 2008 | author = United States Government | authorlink = SAMHSA | coauthors =  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | year = 2004 | publisher = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080331184508/http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/files/DAWN2k4ED.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | archivedate = 31 March 2008 }}</ref>

Whilst all benzodiazepines have abuse potential, certain characteristics increase the potential of particular benzodiazepines for abuse. These characteristics are chiefly practical ones—most especially, availability (often based on popular perception of 'dangerous' versus 'non-dangerous' drugs) through prescribing physicians or illicit distributors. Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic factors are also crucial in determining abuse potentials. A short [[elimination half-life]], high potency and a rapid onset of action are characteristics which increase the abuse potential of benzodiazepines.<ref name="pmid10779253">{{cite journal | author = Longo, L.

<nowiki>**</nowiki>The duration of apparent action is usually considerably less than the half-life. With most benzodiazepines, noticeable effects usually wear off within a few hours. Nevertheless, as long as the drug is present it will exert subtle effects within the body. These effects may become apparent during continued use or may appear as withdrawal symptoms when dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Drug dependence and withdrawal effects==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|Benzodiazepine dependence}}
[[File:Addictiondependence1.gif|thumbnail|Benzodiazepines can induce a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] as well as [[Substance dependence|drug seeking behaviour]].]]
[[Sedative]] [[hypnotics]] such as alcohol, benzodiazepines and the barbiturates are notorious for the severe [[physical dependence]] that they are capable of inducing which can result in severe withdrawal effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/can-drb.htm |title=Dr Ray Baker's Article on Addiction: Benzodiazepines in Particular |accessdate=14 February 2009 |author=Dr Ray Baker}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This severe neuroadaptation is even more profound in high dose drug users and misusers. A high degree of [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] often occurs in chronic benzodiazepine abusers due to the typically high doses they consume which can lead to a severe [[benzodiazepine dependence]]. The [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] seen in chronic high dose benzodiazepine abusers is similar to that seen in therapeutic low dose users but of a more severe nature. Extreme antisocial behaviours in obtaining continued supplies and severe drug-seeking behaviour when withdrawing occurs. The severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been described by one benzodiazepine drug misuser who stated that<ref name=baashton /> <blockquote>I'd rather withdraw off heroin any day. If I was withdrawing from benzos you could offer me a gram of heroin or just 20mg of diazepam and I'd take the diazepam every time&nbsp;– I've never been so frightened in my life.</blockquote> Those who use benzodiazepines intermittently are less likely to develop a dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon dose reduction or cessation of benzodiazepines than those who use benzodiazepines on a daily basis.<ref name=baashton />

Misuse of benzodiazepines is widespread amongst drug misusers; however, many of these people will not require withdrawal management as their use is often restricted to binges or occasional misuse. Benzodiazepine dependence when it occurs requires withdrawal treatment. There is little evidence of benefit from long-term substitution therapy of benzodiazepines, and conversely, there is growing evidence of the harm of [[long-term use of benzodiazepines]], especially higher doses. Therefore gradual reduction is recommended, titrated against withdrawal symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nta.nhs.uk/publications/documents/clinical_guidelines_2007.pdf |title=Drug misuse and dependence&nbsp;– UK guidelines on clinical management |author=National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse |authorlink=National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse |year=2007 |publisher=Department of Health |location=United Kingdom |format=PDF }}</ref> For withdrawal purposes, stabilisation with a long acting agent such as diazepam is recommended before commencing withdrawal. [[Chlordiazepoxide]] (librium), a long-acting benzodiazepine, is gaining attention as an alternative to diazepam in substance abusers dependent on benzodiazepines due to its decreased abuse potential.<ref name=dah2006 /> In individuals dependent on benzodiazepines who have been using benzodiazepines long-term, taper regimes of 6–12 months have been recommended and found to be more successful. More rapid detoxifications e.g. of a month are not recommended as they lead to more severe withdrawal symptoms.<ref name=sudapg>{{cite book | last1 = Gitlow | first1 = S. | title = Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide | url = http://books.google.com/?id=rbrSdWVerBUC | edition = 2nd | year = 2006 | publisher = Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | location = USA | isbn = 978-0-7817-6998-3 | pages = 103–121 }}</ref>

Tolerance leads to a reduction in GABA receptors and function; when benzodiazepines are reduced or stopped this leads to an unmasking of these compensatory changes in the nervous system with the appearance of physical and mental withdrawal effects such as anxiety, insomnia, autonomic hyperactivity and possibly seizures.<ref name="pmid10779253" />

All sedative-hypnotics, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[Z-drugs]] have a similar mechanism of action, working on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex and are [[cross tolerant]] with each other and also have abuse potential. Use of prescription sedative-hypnotics e.g. the [[non-benzodiazepine]] [[Z-drugs]] often leads to a relapse back into substance misuse with one author stating this occurs in over a quarter of those who have achieved abstinence.<ref name=sudapg />

==Drug-related crime==
{{See also|Drug-related crime}}
Problem benzodiazepine use can be associated with various [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]s, including [[drug-related crime]]. In a survey of police detainees carried out by the Australian Government, both legal and illegal users of benzodiazepines were found to be more likely to have lived on the streets, less likely to have been in full-time work and more likely to have used heroin or [[methamphetamine]]s in the past 30 days from the date of taking part in the survey. Benzodiazepine users were also more likely to be receiving illegal incomes and more likely to have been arrested or imprisoned in the previous year. Benzodiazepines were sometimes reported to be used alone, but most often formed part of a poly drug-using problem. Female users were more likely than men to be using heroin, whereas male users were more likely to report amphetamine use. Benzodiazepine users were more likely than non-users to claim government financial benefits and benzodiazepine users who were also poly-drug users were the most likely to be claiming government financial benefits. Those who reported using benzodiazepines alone were found to be in the mid range when compared to other drug using patterns in terms of property crimes and criminal breaches. Of the detainees reporting benzodiazepine use, one in five reported injection use, mostly of illicit [[temazepam]], with some who reported injecting prescribed benzodiazepines. Injection was a concern in this survey due to increased health risks. The main problems highlighted in this survey were concerns of [[drug dependence|dependence]], the potential for overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with [[opiates]] and the health problems associated with injection of benzodiazepines.<ref name="urlwww.aic.gov.au">{{cite journal | url = http://www.aic.gov.au/documents/4/3/3/%7B4336A1AE-AFEC-4D82-A1D9-EB94ECC5B008%7Dtandi336.pdf | title = Benzodiazepine use and harms among police detainees in Australia | author = Loxley, W. | year = 2007 | format = pdf | isbn = 978-1-921185-39-7 | journal = Trends & Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice | issue = 336 | accessdate = 2009-06-10 | publisher = Australian Institute of Criminology | location = Canberra, A.C.T. }}</ref>

Benzodiazepines are also sometimes used for drug facilitated sexual assaults and robbery, however, alcohol remains the most common drug involved in drug facilitated assaults. The muscle relaxant, disinhibiting and amnesia producing effects of benzodiazepines are the pharmacological properties which make these drugs effective in drug-facilitated crimes.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = R.

==Drug regulation and enforcement==

===Europe===
[[Temazepam]] abuse and seizures have been falling in the UK probably due to its reclassification as Schedule 3 [[controlled drug]] with tighter prescribing restrictions and the resultant reduction in availability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/226306/0061258.pdf | title = Statistical Bulletin&nbsp;– DRUG SEIZURES BY SCOTTISH POLICE FORCES, 2005/2006 AND 2006/2007 | accessdate = 13 February 2009 | author = The Scottish Government | authorlink = Scottish Government | date = 3 June 2008 | format = pdf | work = Crime and Justice Series | publisher = scotland.gov.uk | location = Scotland }}</ref>
A total of 2.75 million temazepam capsules were seized in the Netherlands by authorities between 1996 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/ar/1999/incb_report_1999_2.pdf | title = Operation of the international drug control system | accessdate = 13 February 2009 | author = INCB | authorlink = INCB | year = 1999 | month = January | format = pdf | publisher = incb.org }}</ref> In [[Northern Ireland]] statistics of individuals attending drug addiction treatment centers found that benzodiazepines were the 2nd most commonly reported main problem drugs (31 percent of attendees).

===Oceania===
Benzodiazepines are common drugs of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among those who may also be using other illicit drugs. The intravenous use of temazepam poses the greatest threat to those who misuse benzodiazepines. Simultaneous consumption of temazepam with heroin is a potential risk factor of overdose. An Australian study of non-fatal heroin overdoses, noted that 26% of heroin users had consumed temazepam at the time of their overdose. This is consistent with a NSW investigation of coronial files from 1992. [[Temazepam]] was found in 26% of heroin-related deaths. Temazepam, including tablet formulations, are used intravenously. In an Australian study of 210 heroin users who used temazepam, 48% had injected it. Although abuse of benzodiazepines has decreased over the past few years, temazepam continues to be a major drug of abuse in Australia. In certain states like Victoria and Queensland, temazepam accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary. Darke, Ross & Hall found that different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential. The more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference for a benzodiazepine were that it was the ‘strongest’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.<ref name="Australian Government 2006"/>

===North America===
Abuse of benzodiazepine drugs is a serious problem in North America. The most frequently abused of the benzodiazepines in both the United States and Canada are [[alprazolam]], [[clonazepam]], [[lorazepam]] and [[diazepam]].<ref name=dawn2neodredv>{{cite web | url = http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/files/ed2006/DAWN2k6ED.htm | title = Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2006: National Estimates of Drug-Related Emergency Department Visits | accessdate = 9 February 2009 | author = United States Government | authorlink = samhsa | coauthors = U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES | year = 2006 | publisher = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration }}</ref>

===East and Southeast Asia===
Abuse of benzodiazepines is a serious problem throughout East and Southeast Asia.

The [[Central Narcotics Bureau]] of Singapore seized 94,200 [[nimetazepam]] tablets in 2003. This is the largest nimetazepam seizure recorded since nimetazepam became a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act in 1992. In Singapore [[nimetazepam]] is a Class C controlled drug.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cnb.gov.sg/drugsituationreport/drugsituationreport2003.aspx | title = Drug Situation Report 2003 | accessdate = 23 September 2011 | author = Central Narcotics Bureau | authorlink = Central Narcotics Bureau | coauthors = Singapore Government | year = 2003 | publisher = cnb.gov.sg | location = Singapore }}</ref>

In Hong Kong abuse of prescription medicinal preparations continued in 2006 and seizures of midazolam (120,611 tablets), nimetazepam/nitrazepam (17,457 tablets), triazolam (1,071 tablets), diazepam (48,923 tablets) and chlordiazepoxide (5,853 tablets) were made. Heroin addicts used such tablets (crushed and mixed with heroin) to prolong the effect of the narcotic and ease withdrawal symptoms.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nd.gov.hk/text/en/report/pdf/2006/chapter4_e.pdf | title = Suppression of Illicit Trafficking and Manufacturing | accessdate = 13 February 2009 | author = Hong Kong Government | authorlink = Hong Kong Government | format = pdf | publisher = nd.gov.hk | location = Hong Kong }}</ref>

==Legal status==
In the United States, benzodiazepines are [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV drugs|Schedule IV drugs]] under the Federal [[Controlled Substances Act]], even when not on the market (for example, [[nitrazepam]] and [[bromazepam]]). Flunitrazepam is subject to more stringent regulations in certain states and temazepam prescriptions require specially coded pads in certain states. 

In Canada, all benzodiazepines are in Schedule 4 of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]].<ref name="urlDEA Briefs & Background, Drugs and Drug Abuse, Drug Descriptions, Benzodiazepines">{{cite web | url = http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/benzodiazepines.html | title = Benzodiazepines | work = DEA Briefs & Background, Drugs and Drug Abuse, Drug Descriptions | publisher = U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration | accessdate = 2009-05-27 }}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the benzodiazepines are schedule 4 controlled drugs, except for [[flunitrazepam]], [[temazepam]] and [[midazolam]], which are schedule 3 controlled drugs and carry stronger penalties for possession and trafficking.<ref name="urlwww.blackpool.nhs.uk">{{cite web | url = http://www.blackpool.nhs.uk/images/uploads/CD-update-GP-v2-may08.pdf | title = Medicines Management Update | author = Blackpool NHS Primary Care Trust | date = 1 May 2008 | publisher = United Kingdom [[National Health Service]] | accessdate = 2009-05-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cdlist.pdf?view=Binary | title = List of Drugs Currently Controlled Under The Misuse of Drugs Legislation | accessdate = 2009-05-27 | publisher = British Government | work = Misuse of Drugs Act UK }}</ref>

In the Netherlands, since October 1993, benzodiazepines, including formulations containing less than 20&nbsp;mg of temazepam, are all placed on List 2 of the [[Opium Law]]. A prescription is needed for possession of all benzodiazepines. Temazepam formulations containing 20&nbsp;mg or greater of the drug are placed on List 1, thus requiring prescriptions to be written in the List 1 format.<ref name="urlwww.cannabisbureau.nl">{{cite web | url = http://www.cannabisbureau.nl/pdf/Opiumwet_EN_29nov2004.pdf | title = Opium Law | date = 29 November 2004 | publisher = Dutch Government | accessdate = 2009-05-27 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In East Asia and Southeast Asia, [[temazepam]] and [[nimetazepam]] are often heavily controlled and restricted. In certain countries, [[triazolam]], [[flunitrazepam]], [[flutoprazepam]] and [[midazolam]] are also restricted or controlled to certain degrees.  In Hong Kong, all benzodiazepines are regulated under Schedule 1 of [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong's]] Chapter 134 ''Dangerous Drugs Ordinance''.<ref>{{cite web | author = Hong Kong Government | authorlink = Hong Kong Government | work = Hong Kong Ordinances | title = DANGEROUS DRUGS ORDINANCE&nbsp;– SCHEDULE 1 | url = http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/134/sch1.html | publisher = hklii.org | location = Hong Kong }}</ref> Previously only [[brotizolam]], [[flunitrazepam]] and [[triazolam]] were classed as dangerous drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lee, K.
