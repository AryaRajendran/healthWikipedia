'''Adie syndrome''', sometimes known as '''Holmes-Adie Syndrome''' or '''Adie's Tonic Pupil''', is a [[neurological disorder]] characterized by a [[Tonic (physiology)|tonic]]ally [[Mydriasis|dilated]] pupil.<ref name=ninds>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/holmes_adie/holmes_adie.htm |title= Holmes-Adie syndrome Information Page | author= [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]|publisher=|accessdate=2008-01-21 |format= |work=}}</ref> It is named after the British neurologist [[William John Adie]]. It is caused by damage to the [[postganglionic fiber]]s of the [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic innervation]] of the eye, usually by a [[virus|viral]] or [[bacterial]] infection which causes [[inflammation]], and affects the [[pupil]] of the eye and the [[autonomic nervous system]]. <ref name=ninds/>

==Signs and symptoms==
Adie syndrome presents with three hallmark symptoms, namely at least one abnormally dilated pupil ([[mydriasis]]) which does not constrict in response to light, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and abnormalities of sweating.<ref name=ninds/> Other signs may include [[hyperopia]] due to accommodative [[paresis]], [[photophobia]] and difficulty reading.<ref name=stedman>{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 27th Edition | publisher = | date = 2000 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-683-40007-X}}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
Pupillary symptoms of Holmes-Adie Syndrome are thought to be the result of a viral or bacterial infection that causes inflammation and damage to neurons in the [[ciliary ganglion]], an area of the brain that provides [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic control]] of eye constriction.  Additionally, patients with Holmes-Adie Syndrome can also experience problems with [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of the body.  This second set of symptoms is caused by damage to the [[dorsal root ganglia]] of the [[spinal cord]].<ref name=ninds/>

==Diagnosis==
Clinical exam may reveal sectoral paresis of the iris sphincter or vermiform iris movements. The tonic pupil may become smaller (miotic) over time which is referred to as "little old Adie's".<ref name=fundneuro>{{cite book | last = Haines | first = Duane E. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Fundamental Neuroscience, 2nd edition | publisher = | date = 2002 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-443-06603-5}}</ref> Testing with low dose (1/8%) [[pilocarpine]] may constrict the tonic pupil due to [[cholinergic]] denervation supersensitivity.<ref name=ninds/> A normal pupil will not constrict with the [[Concentration|dilute]] dose of pilocarpine.<ref name=fundneuro/> [[CT Scan|CT scans]] and [[MRI]] scans may be useful in the diagnostic testing of [[Focal dystonia|focal]] hypoactive reflexes.<ref name=wrong>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/a/adie_syndrome/diagnosis.htm |title= Diagnosis of Adie syndrome | author= |publisher= WrongDiagnosis.com|accessdate=2008-01-21 |format= |work=}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The usual treatment of a standardised Adie syndrome is to prescribe reading glasses to correct for impairment of the eye(s).<ref name=ninds/> [[Pilocarpine]] drops may be administered as a treatment as well as a diagnostic measure.<ref name=ninds/> [[Thoracic sympathectomy]] is the definitive treatment of [[diaphoresis]], if the condition is not treatable by [[drug therapy]].<ref name=ninds/>

==Prognosis==
Adie's syndrome is not life threatening or disabling.<ref name=ninds/> As such, there is no mortality rate relating to the condition; however, loss of deep tendon reflexes is permanent and may progress over time.<ref name=ninds/>

== Epidemiology ==
It most commonly affects younger women (2.6:1 female preponderance) and is unilateral in 80% of cases.<ref name=fundneuro/> Average age of onset is 32 years.
