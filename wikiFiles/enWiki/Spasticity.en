'''Spasticity''' is a feature of altered [[skeletal muscle]] performance in [[muscle tone]] involving [[hypertonia]]; it is also referred to as an unusual "tightness", stiffness, and/or "pull" of muscles.  The word spasm comes from the Greek word σπασμός (''spasmos''), meaning "drawing, pulling."

Clinically spasticity is defined as velocity dependent resistance to stretch, where a lack of inhibition results in excessive contraction of the muscles, ultimately leading to hyperflexia (overly flexed joints). It mostly occurs in disorders of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) impacting the [[upper motor neuron]] in the form of a [[lesion]], such as [[spastic diplegia]], but it can also present in various types of [[multiple sclerosis]], where it occurs as a symptom of the progressively-worsening attacks on [[myelin sheath]]s and is thus unrelated to the types of spasticity present in neuromuscular [[cerebral palsy]] rooted spasticity disorders.  

The clinical underpinnings of two of the most common spasticity conditions, [[spastic diplegia]] and [[multiple sclerosis]], can be described as follows: in [[spastic diplegia]], the upper motor neuron lesion arises often as a result of [[neonatal asphyxia]], while in conditions like [[multiple sclerosis]], spasticity is thought by some to be as a result of the [[autoimmune]] destruction of the [[myelin sheath]]s around nerve endings — which in turn can ''mimic'' the [[gamma amino butyric acid]] deficiencies present in the damaged nerves of spastic diplegics, leading to roughly the same ''presentation'' of spasticity, but which clinically is fundamentally different from the latter.

==Spasticity Pathophysiology==

The cause of spasticity is not really known, but there are several theories.  In general, spasticity develops when an imbalance occurs in the excitatory and inhibitory input to α motor neurons caused by damage to the spinal cord and/or central nervous system.  The damage causes a change in the balance of signals between the nervous system and the muscles, leading to increased excitability in the muscles.  

One factor that is thought to be related to spasticity is the stretch reflex. This reflex is important in coordinating normal movements in which muscles are contracted and relaxed and in keeping the muscle from stretching too far. Although the end result of spasticity is problems with the muscles, spasticity is actually caused by an injury to a part of the central nervous system (the brain or spinal cord) that controls voluntary movements. The damage causes a change in the balance of signals between the nervous system and the muscles. This imbalance leads to increased activity (excitability) in the muscles.  Receptors in the muscles receive messages from the nervous system, which sense the amount of stretch in the muscle and sends that signal to the brain.  The brain responds by sending a message back to reverse the stretch by contracting or shortening.<ref>WeMove.org http://www.mdvu.org/library/disease/spasticity/spa_mpath.asp</ref>

Overall, a defining feature of spasticity is that the increased resistance to passive stretch is velocity-dependent. Lance (1980) describes it this way:  “...a motor disorder, characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyper-excitability of the stretch reflex as one component of the upper motor neurone (UMN) syndrome."{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} 

Spasticity is found in conditions where the [[brain]] and/or [[spinal cord]] are damaged or fail to develop normally; these include [[cerebral palsy]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[spinal cord injury]] and [[acquired brain injury]] including [[stroke]]. Damage to the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] as a result of [[stroke]] or [[spinal cord]] injury, alter the [net inhibition] of [[peripheral nerve]]s in the affected region. This change in input to bodily structures tends to favor excitation and therefore increase [[nerve]] excitability. CNS damage also causes [[nerve]] [[cell membrane]]s to rest in a more [depolarized] state. The combination of decreased inhibition and an increased depolarized state of [[cell membrane]]s, decreases [[action potential threshold]] for nerve signal conduction, and thus increases activity of structures innervated by the affected nerves (spasticity). Muscles affected in this way have many other potential features of altered performance in addition to spasticity, including muscle ''weakness''; decreased movement control; [[clonus]] (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions often symptomatic of muscle over-exertion and/or muscle fatigue); exaggerated deep [[tendon]] reflexes; and decreased [[endurance]].

==Spasticity and Clonus==

[[Clonus]] tends to co-exist with spasticity in many cases of [[stroke]] and [[spinal cord injury]] likely due to their common physiological origins.<ref name="Reference 2">{{cite journal|last=Hilder|first=Joseph M.|coauthors=Zev W.

==History==

Historical progression of spasticity  and the upper motor neuron lesion it is based on has progressed considerably in recent decades. However, the term "spasticity" is still often used interchangeably with "Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome" in the clinical settings, and it is not unusual to see patients labeled as "spastic" who actually demonstrate not just spasticity alone, but also an array of upper motor neuron findings.<ref>Ivanhoe CB, Reistetter TA: Spasticity: The misunderstood part of the upper motor neuron syndrome. Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2004;83(suppl):S3–S9.</ref>

Research has clearly shown that exercise is beneficial for spastic muscles,<ref>Ada L, Dorsch S, Canning C G. Strengthening interventions increase strength and improve activity after stroke: a systematic review. Australian Journal of Physiotherapy. 2006;52(4):241-248.</ref> even though in the very early days of research it was assumed that strength exercise would ''increase'' spasticity. Also, from at least the 1950s through at least the 1980s, there was a strong focus on other interventions for spastic muscles, particularly stretching and [[orthotics|splinting]], but the evidence does not support these as effective.<ref>Bovend'Eerdt TJ, Newman M, Barker K, Dawes H, Minelli C, Wade DT. The effects of stretching in spasticity: a systematic review. Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2008 Jul;89(7):1395-406.</ref> While splinting is not considered effective for decreasing spasticity, a range of different orthotics are effectively used for preventing muscle contractures on patients with spasticity. In the case of [[spastic diplegia]] there is also a permanent [[neurosurgical]] treatment for spasticity, [[selective dorsal rhizotomy]], that directly targets nerves in the spine that cause the spasticity, and destroys them, so that the spasticity cannot be activated at all.

==Presentation and assessment==

Spasticity is assessed by feeling the resistance of the muscle to passive lengthening in its most relaxed state. A spastic muscle will have immediately noticeable, often quite forceful, increased resistance to passive stretch when moved with speed and/or while attempting to be stretched out, as compared to the non-spastic muscles in the same person's body (if any exist). As there are many features of the Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome, there are likely to be multiple other changes in affected musculature and surrounding bones, such as progressive misalignments of bone structure around the spastic muscles (leading for example to the [[scissor gait]] in [[spastic diplegia]].  Also, following an upper motor neuron lesion, there may be multiple muscles affected, to varying degrees, depending on the location and severity of the upper motor neuron damage.  The result for the affected individual, is that they may have any degree of impairment, ranging from a mild to a severe movement disorder.  A relatively mild movement disorder may contribute to a loss of dexterity in an arm, or difficulty with high level mobility such as running or walking on stairs.  A severe movement disorder may result in marked loss of function with minimal or no volitional muscle activation. There are several scales used to measure spasticity, such as the King’s Hypertonicity Scale {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}, the Tardieu {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and the Modified Ashworth {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Of these three, only the King’s Hypertonicity Scale measures a range of muscle changes from the UMN lesion, including active muscle performance as well as passive response to stretch. 

Assessment of a movement disorder featuring spasticity may involve several health professionals depending on the affected individual's situation, and the severity of their condition.  This may include [[physical therapists]], doctors (including [[neurologists]] and [[American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|rehabilitation physicians)]], [[orthotists]] and [[occupational therapists]].  Assessment is needed of the affected individual's goals, their function, and any symptoms that may be related to the movement disorder, such as pain.  A thorough assessment will include analysis of posture, active movement, muscle strength, movement control and coordination, and endurance, as well as spasticity (response of the muscle to stretch).  Spastic muscles typically demonstrate a loss of selective movement, including a loss of eccentric control (decreased ability to actively lengthen).  While multiple muscles in a limb are usually affected in the Upper Motor Neuron Syndrome, there is usually an imbalance of activity, such that there is a stronger pull in one direction, such as into elbow flexion.  Decreasing the degree of this imbalance is a common focus of muscle strengthening programs. Spastic movement disorders also typically feature a loss of [[core stability|stabilisation]] of an affected limb or the head from the [[torso|trunk]], so a thorough assessment requires this to be analysed as well. 

Secondary effects are likely to impact on assessment of spastic muscles.  If a muscle has impaired function following an upper motor neuron lesion, other changes such as increased muscle stiffness are likely to affect the feeling of resistance to passive stretch.  Other secondary changes such as loss of muscle fibres following acquired muscle weakness are likely to compound the weakness arising from the upper motor neuron lesion. In severely affected spastic muscles, there may be marked secondary changes, such as muscle [[contracture]], particularly if management has been delayed or absent.

==Treatment==
Treatment should be based on assessment by relevant health professionals.  For spastic muscles with mild-to-moderate impairment, [[strength training|exercise]] should be the mainstay of management, and is likely needed to be prescribed by a physical therapist or other health professional skilled in neurological rehabilitation.  

Muscles with severe spasticity are likely to be more limited in their ability to exercise, and may require help to do this.  They may require additional interventions, to manage the greater neurological impairment and also the greater secondary complications. These secondary complications involve the development of contractures, deformity and postural asymmetries. Interventions may include icing, serial casting, sustained stretching, inhibitory pressure and medical interventions. Treatment should be done with firm and constant manual contact positioned over nonspastic areas to avoid stimulating the spastic muscle(s).  Alternatively, [[rehabilitation robotics]] can be used to provide high volumes of passive or assisted movement, depending on the individual's requirements;<ref>Hillman, M. (2004). Rehabilitation robotics from past to present: A historical perspective. In Z.Z. Bien & D. Stefanov (Eds.), Advances in ''Rehabilitation Robotics'' (25-44). Berlin: Springer-Verlag.</ref> this form of therapy can be useful if therapists are at a premium, and has been found effective at reducing spasticity in patients suffering from [[stroke]].<ref>Krebs, H.I., et al. (2003). Rehabilitation robotics: Performance-based progressive robot-assisted therapy. ''Automatic Robots, 15'', 7-20.</ref>  For muscles that lack any volitional control, such as after complete [[spinal cord injury]], exercise may be assisted, and may require equipment, such as using a standing frame to sustain a standing position.
A general treatment guideline can be followed that involves:  
* The initial focus on first activating contraction of antagonist muscles to provide reciprocal inhibition and lengthen spastic muscles
* Reciprocal actions are attempted. Agonist contractions are performed first in small ranges progressing to larger arcs of movement
* Highly stressful activities be minimized early in training
* Functional skills are targeted for training
* Patients and family/caregivers should be educated about the importance of maintaining range of motion and doing daily exercises<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Susan|title=Physical Rehabilitation|year=2007|publisher=F.A Davis Company|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=496–497}}</ref>

Medical interventions may include such medications as [[baclofen]], [[diazepam]], [[dantrolene]], or [[clonazepam]]. [[Phenol]] injections can be used, or [[botulinum toxin]] injections into the muscle belly, to attempt to dampen the signals between nerve and muscle. The effectiveness of medications vary between individuals, and vary based on location of the upper motor neuron lesion (in the brain or the spinal cord). Medications are commonly used for spastic movement disorders, but research has not shown functional benefit for some drugs.<ref name="Taricco M 2000">Taricco M, Adone R, Pagliacci C, Telaro E. Pharmacological interventions for spasticity following spinal cord injury. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2000, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD001131.</ref><ref>Shakespeare D, Boggild M, Young CA. Anti-spasticity agents for multiple sclerosis. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2003, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD001332.</ref> Some studies have shown that medications have been effective in decreasing spasticity, but that this has not been accompanied by functional benefits.<ref name="Taricco M 2000"/> [[Surgery]] could be required for a tendon release in the case of a severe muscle imbalance leading to contracture. In spastic CP, selective dorsal [[rhizotomy]] has also been used to decrease muscle overactivity.

Incorporating [[hydrotherapy]] in the treatment program may help decrease spasm severity, promote functional independence, improve motor recovery and decrease medication required for spasticity, which may help reduce the side effects that are possible with oral drug treatments.<ref name="Kesiktas">{{cite journal | author = Kesiktas, N., Paker, N., Erdogan, N., Gulsen, G., Bicki, D., & Yilmaz, H | year = 2004 | title = The use of hydrotherapy for the management of spasticity | journal = Neurorehabilitation & Neural Repair | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 268–273}}</ref><ref name="Beresneva">{{cite journal | author = Beresneva, J., Stirane, D., Kiukucane, E., & Vetra, A | year = 2009 | title = The use of aquatic therapy in stroke patients for the management of spasticity...Proceedings of the 10th Congress of the European Federation for Research in Rehabilitation, Riga, Latvia | journal = International Journal of Rehabilitation Research | volume = 32 | page = S110}}</ref>   A 2004 study compared the effects of hydrotherapy on spasticity, oral [[baclofen]] dosage and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores of patients with a [[spinal cord injury]] (SCI). It was found that subjects who received hydrotherapy treatment obtained increased FIM scores and a decreased intake of oral baclofen medication.<ref name ="Kesiktas" />  A 2009 study looked at the effect of hydrotherapy to decrease spasticity on post-[[stroke]], [[hemiparetic]] patients with limited mobility and concluded that there was a significantly larger increase in FIM scores compared to the control group that did not receive hydrotherapy.<ref name ="Beresneva" />

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for those with spastic muscles depends on multiple factors, including the severity of the spasticity and the associated movement disorder, access to specialised and intensive management, and ability of the affected individual to maintain the management plan (particularly an exercise program).  Most people with a significant UMN lesion will have ongoing impairment, but most of these will be able to make progress. The most important factor to indicate ability to progress is seeing improvement, but improvement in many spastic movement disorders may not be seen until the affected individual receives help from a specialised team or health professional.
