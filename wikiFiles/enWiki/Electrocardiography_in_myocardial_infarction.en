'''[[Electrocardiography]] in suspected [[myocardial infarction]]''' has the main purpose of detecting [[ischemia]] or acute coronary injury in [[emergency department]] populations coming for symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI). Also, it can distinguish clinically different types of myocardial infarction.

==Technical issues==
The standard 12 lead [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) has several limitations. An ECG represents a brief sample in time. Because unstable ischemic syndromes have rapidly changing supply versus demand characteristics, a single ECG may not accurately represent the entire picture.<ref name=Cannon_175>Cannon CP at al. ''Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes''. p. 175. New Jersey: Humana Press, 1999. ISBN 0-89603-552-2.</ref> It is therefore desirable to obtain ''serial'' 12 lead ECGs, particularly if the first ECG is obtained during a pain-free episode. Alternatively, many [[emergency department]]s and [[chest pain center]]s use computers capable of continuous ST segment monitoring.<ref name="NHAAP_1997">{{cite journal |author=Selker HP, Zalenski RJ, Antman EM, ''et al.'' |title=An evaluation of technologies for identifying acute cardiac ischemia in the emergency department: executive summary of a National Heart Attack Alert Program Working Group Report |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=1997 |month=January |pmid=8998085 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(97)70297-X}}</ref> The standard 12 lead ECG also does not directly examine the [[right ventricle]], and is relatively poor at examining the posterior basal and lateral walls of the [[left ventricle]]. In particular, acute myocardial infarction in the distribution of the circumflex artery is likely to produce a nondiagnostic ECG.<ref name=Cannon_175/> The use of additional ECG leads like right-sided leads V3R and V4R and posterior leads V7, V8, and V9 may improve sensitivity for right ventricular and posterior myocardial infarction. In spite of these limitations, the 12 lead ECG stands at the center of risk stratification for the patient with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Mistakes in interpretation are relatively common, and the failure to identify high risk features has a negative effect on the quality of patient care.<ref name="EDQMI_2006">{{cite journal |author=Masoudi FA, Magid DJ, Vinson DR, ''et al.'' |title=Implications of the failure to identify high-risk electrocardiogram findings for the quality of care of patients with acute myocardial infarction: results of the Emergency Department Quality in Myocardial Infarction (EDQMI) study |journal=Circulation |volume=114 |issue=15 |pages=1565–71 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17015790 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.623652 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/114/15/1565}}</ref>

==Main patterns==
The 12 lead ECG is used to classify MI patients into one of three groups:<ref name="ECC_2005_ACS">{{cite journal | title=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care&nbsp;— Part 8: Stabilization of the Patient With Acute Coronary Syndromes | journal=Circulation | year=2005 | volume=112 | pages=IV–89–IV–110 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166561 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-89 | issue=24_suppl | pmid=16314375}}</ref>
# those with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block (suspicious for acute injury and a possible candidate for acute reperfusion therapy with [[thrombolysis|thrombolytics]] or primary [[percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]]),
# those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion (suspicious for ischemia), and
# those with a so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG. However, a normal ECG does not rule out acute myocardial infarction.

===ST elevation MI===
The current guidelines for the ECG diagnosis of the ST segment elevation type of acute myocardial infarction require at least 1&nbsp;mm (0.1 mV) of ST segment elevation in the limb leads, and at least 2&nbsp;mm elevation in the precordial leads. These elevations must be present in anatomically contiguous leads.<ref name="ECC_2005_ACS"/> (I, aVL, V5, V6 correspond to the lateral wall; V1-V2 correspond to the septal wall; V3-V4 correspond to the anterior wall; II, III, aVF correspond to the inferior wall.) This criterion is problematic, however, as acute myocardial infarction is not the most common cause of ST segment elevation in [[chest pain]] patients.<ref name="Cause_ST_ED">{{cite journal |author=Brady WJ, Perron AD, Martin ML, Beagle C, Aufderheide TP |title=Cause of ST segment abnormality in ED chest pain patients |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–8 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11146012 |doi=10.1053/ajem.2001.18029 |url=}}</ref> Over 90% of healthy men have at least 1&nbsp;mm (0.1 mV) of ST segment elevation in at least one precordial lead.<ref name="ST_Other_MI">{{cite journal |author=Wang K, Asinger RW, Marriott HJ |title=ST-segment elevation in conditions other than acute myocardial infarction |journal=N.

==Typical progression==
Sometimes the earliest presentation of acute myocardial infarction is the hyperacute T wave, which is treated the same as ST segment elevation.<ref name=Hyperacute2002>{{cite journal |author=Somers MP, Brady WJ, Perron AD, Mattu A |title=The prominant &#91;sic&#93; T wave: electrocardiographic differential diagnosis |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=243–51 |year=2002 |month=May |pmid=11992348 |doi=10.1053/ajem.2002.32630}}</ref> In practice this is rarely seen, because it only exists for 2–30 minutes after the onset of infarction.<ref name="ACS_Clin_NA">{{cite journal |author=Smith SW, Whitwam W |title=Acute coronary syndromes |journal=Emerg.

In the first few hours the ST segments usually begin to rise.<ref name=gpnotebook>[http://www..co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=261750790 gpnotebook.co.uk > ECG changes in myocardial infarction] Retrieved on June 16, 2010</ref> Pathological [[QRS complex|Q waves]] may appear within hours or may take greater than 24 hr.<ref name=gpnotebook/> The [[T wave]] will generally become inverted in the first 24 hours, as the ST elevation begins to resolve.<ref name=gpnotebook/>

Long term changes of ECG include persistent Q waves (in 90% of cases) and persistent inverted T waves.<ref name=gpnotebook/> Persistent ST elevation is rare except in the presence of a [[ventricular aneurysm]].<ref name=gpnotebook/>
