'''Amphetamine Withdrawal Psychosis''' (AWP)  is a previously rare condition which is increasing in prevalence due to rises in medical<ref>"Study: ADHD Checklist Too Easy to Fake", ''TIME'' Magazine Megan Gibson, June 15, 2010 http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/06/15/study-faking-adhd-is-easy-so-is-getting-adhd-drugs</ref> and illicit [[stimulant]] use<ref>On speed: the many lives of amphetamine Nicolas Rasmussen NYU Press, 2008</ref> with concomitant high rates of withdrawal. This may lead to [[psychosis]] in vulnerable individuals, who may also have other [[psychiatric]] diagnoses.

Despite the above factors increasing prevalence of AWP in modern society, it is still often confused with the  more common [[amphetamine]] induced psychoses, schizoaffective and bipolar disorders.<ref name="sarampote">J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol. 2002 Spring;12(1):63-7.Can stimulant rebound mimic pediatric bipolar disorder? Sarampote CS, Efron LA, Robb AS, Pearl PL, Stein MA</ref> Its relatively low rate compared to the separate and distinct categories of the more general withdrawal or psychotic syndromes of amphetamine use mean that no general [[DSM IV]] category exists, and it is currently included under DSM IV code 292.9 - amphetamine-related disorder NOS (Not Otherwise Specified)[[DSM-IV Codes#Amphetamine (or amphetamine-like) related disorders]]. Its similarity to other conditions and the lack of a generally recognised diagnostic category may be a contributing factor to high rates of [[misdiagnosis]], which can often lead to delays in appropriate treatment.<ref name="sarampote" />

Symptoms emerge with sudden cessation of amphetamine use and can include insomnia, irritability, [[paranoid delusions]], disordered thinking, agitated behaviour, somatic and auditory hallucinations, elevated or depressed mood and increased cravings for amphetamines.<ref name="Deveaugh-Geiss">Am J Psychiatry. 1982 Sep;139(9):1190-1. Confusional paranoid psychosis after withdrawal from sympathomimetic amines: two case reports.

However, unlike similar disorders, in AWP amphetamines reduce rather than increase symptoms, and the psychosis or mania resolves with resumption of the previous dosing schedule.<ref name="hegerl">Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 2006 Aug 30;30(6):1097-102. Epub 2006 Jun Are psychostimulants a treatment option in mania? Hegerl U, Sander C, Olbrich S, Schoenknecht P.</ref> Typically premorbid functioning is achieved with appropriate stimulant treatment – in fact, in the absence of clear biological markers, this clinical response is the primary diagnostic criteria for AWP.

There are some preliminary EEG markers for AWP, which relate to the vigilance hypothesis of bipolar disorder.<ref name="hegerl" /> Chronic underarousal is compensated for by increased physical and mental activity, which can manifest as both a mania acutely, or ADH/D in the long term<ref>Clin Electroencephalogr. 2001 Jan;32(1):36-9.</ref><ref>Decreased level of EEG-vigilance in acute mania as a possible predictor for a rapid effect of methylphenidate: a case study. Bschor T, Müller-Oerlinghausen B, Ulrich G.</ref> – rebound effects from withdrawal can  both unmask and precipitate episode.<ref name="sarampote" /><ref name="Deveaugh-Geiss" />

These findings suggest that patients with severe Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) are more susceptible to AWP with primarily manic as opposed to psychotic symptoms.<ref>Curr Opin Psychiatry. 2010 Jan;23(1):1-7.Mania and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: common symptomatology, common pathophysiology and common treatment? Hegerl U, Himmerich H, Engmann B, Hensch T.</ref> There is however considerable overlap between genetic markers for psychotic and affective vulnerabilities.

At the neurotransmitter level of explanation, a variety of explanations have been proposed. Noradrenergic hyperactivity and "withdrawal-induced cholinergic overdrive and the cholinergic-monoaminergic system dysregulation"<ref>Can J Psychiatry. 2003 May;48(4):258-64.Switch to mania upon discontinuation of antidepressants in patients with mood disorders: a review of the literature. Ali S, Milev Ra</ref> along with agonist-induced dopamine receptor hypersensitivity.<ref name="Deveaugh-Geiss" /> Psychoscial stressors are also likely to have significance in the onset and prognosis of this disorder.<ref>Int Pharmacopsychiatry. 1978;13(4):193-208.

Perhaps most importantly, "ramifications of a misdiagnosed psychotic illness are potentially long-lasting and harmful to a patient. It is, therefore, crucial that health care providers be aware of the complex relationship between substance abuse, psychotic symptoms, and independent psychotic disorders".<ref name="bacon" /> This viewpoint coincides with the opinion of medical and mental health professionals{{Who|date=August 2011}} who consider timely recognition and appropriate treatment of AWP to be essential to minimising impact on an individual's present and future functioning.
