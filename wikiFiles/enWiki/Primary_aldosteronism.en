'''Primary aldosteronism''', also known as '''primary hyperaldosteronism''', is characterized by the overproduction of the [[mineralocorticoid]] [[hormone]] [[aldosterone]] by the [[adrenal gland]]s,<ref name=conn>{{cite journal |author=Conn JW, Louis LH |title=Primary aldosteronism:  a new clinical entity |journal=Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians |volume=68 |issue= |pages=215–31; discussion, 231–3 |year=1955 |pmid=13299331 |doi= |url=}}</ref> when not a result of excessive renin secretion. Aldosterone causes increase in [[sodium]] and water retention and [[potassium]] excretion in the [[kidney]]s, leading to [[arterial hypertension]] (high blood pressure). An increase in the production of mineralocorticoid from the adrenal gland is evident. It is amongst the most common causes of [[secondary hypertension]],<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/117280-overview ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> [[renal disease]] being the most common.

Primary [[hyperaldosteronism]] has many causes, including adrenal [[hyperplasia]] and adrenal [[carcinoma]].<ref>http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec13/ch164/ch164e.html</ref> When it occurs due to a solitary aldosterone-secreting [[adrenal adenoma]] (a type of benign tumor), it is known as '''[[Conn's syndrome]]'''.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0187-1">{{cite book |author=Cotran, Ramzi S.; Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelson; Nelso Fausto; Robbins, Stanley L.; Abbas, Abul K. |title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |page=1210 |isbn=0-7216-0187-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> In practice, however, the terms are often used interchangeably, regardless of the underlying physiology.

==Causes==
The syndrome is due to:<ref>{{cite book|first=Henry M. Kronenberg|title=Williams textbook of endocrinology.|year=2008|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-2911-3|edition=11th ed.}}</ref>

*Most commonly Adrenal Adenoma (Conn's Syndrome) (66%)
*Bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia (30%)
*Primary (unilateral) adrenal hyperplasia—2% of cases
*Aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma—<1% of cases
*Familial Hyperaldosteronism (FH)
*Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (FH type I)—<1% of cases
*FH type II (APA or IHA)—<2% of cases
*Ectopic aldosterone-producing adenoma or carcinoma—< 0.1% of cases

Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of aldosteronism due to '''bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia''' (IAH) is higher than had previously been believed, for as many as 75% of aldosteronism cases.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/127080-overview ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

==Signs, symptoms and findings==
Aldosterone has effects on most or all cells of the body but, clinically, the most important actions are on cells of the late distal tubule and medullary collecting duct. In the [[principal cells]] aldosterone increases activity of basolateral membrane [[sodium-potassium ATPase]] and apical epithelial sodium channels, [[ENaC]], as well as potassium channels, [[ROMK]]. These actions increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. Since more sodium is reabsorbed than potassium secreted, it also makes the lumen more electrically negative, causing chloride to follow sodium. Water then follows sodium and chloride by osmosis. In Conn syndrome these actions cause increased extracellular sodium and fluid volume and reduced extracellular potassium. Aldosterone also acts on [[intercalated]] cells to stimulate an apical proton ATPase, causing proton secretion that acidifies urine and alkalizes extracellular fluid.

Finer notes on aldosterone include the fact that it stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase in muscle cells, increasing intracellular potassium and also increases sodium reabsoption all along the intestine and nephron, possibly due to widespread stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase. Finally, epithelial cells of sweat gland ducts and distal colon surface respond exactly the same as the principal cells of the nephron. These responses are important in climate adaptation and as a cause of constipation with elevated aldosterone.

The sodium retention leads to plasma volume expansion and elevated blood pressure. The increased blood pressure will lead to increased [[glomerular filtration rate]] and cause a decrease in [[renin]] release from the granular cells of the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] in the kidney. If there is a primary hyperaldosteronism the decreased renin (and subsequent decreased [[angiotensin II]]) will not lead to a decrease in aldosterone levels (a very helpful clinical tool in diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism).

Aside from high blood pressure manifestations of [[myalgia|muscle cramps]] (due to hyperexcitability of neurons secondary to hypocalcemia), [[muscle weakness]] (due to hypoexcitability of skeletal muscles secondary to hypokalemia), and [[headache]]s (due to hypokalemia or high blood pressure) may be seen.

Secondary hyperaldosteronism is often related to decreased [[cardiac output]] which is associated with elevated renin levels.

==Diagnosis==
Measuring aldosterone alone is not considered adequate to diagnose primary hyperaldosteronism. Rather, both [[renin]] and aldosterone are measured, and a resultant [[aldosterone-to-renin ratio]] is used for diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tiu S, Choi C, Shek C, Ng Y, Chan F, Ng C, Kong A |title=The use of aldosterone-renin ratio as a diagnostic test for primary hyperaldosteronism and its test characteristics under different conditions of blood sampling |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=72–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15483077 |doi=10.1210/jc.2004-1149}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ubht.nhs.uk/pathology/ChemicalPathology/TestProtocols/16Renin.html United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust, the major teaching trust in South West England<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A high aldosterone-to-renin ratio indicates presence of primary hyperaldosteronism.

If plasma levels of renin and aldosterone suggest hyperaldosteronism, [[computed axial tomography|CT scanning]] can confirm the presence of an adrenal adenoma. If the clinical presentation primarily involves hypertension and elevated levels of catecholamines, CT or MRI scanning can confirm a tumor on the adrenal medulla, typically an aldosteronoma.

Hyperaldosteronism can be mimicked by [[Liddle syndrome]], and by ingestion of [[licorice]] and other foods containing [[glycyrrhizin]].  In one case report, hypertension and [[quadriparesis]] resulted from [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] with a non-alcoholic [[pastis]] (an [[anise]]-flavored [[aperitif]] containing [[glycyrrhizinic acid]]).<ref name="pmid6623028">{{cite journal

==Therapy==
The treatment for hyperaldosteronism depends on the underlying cause. In patients with a single benign tumor (adenoma), surgical removal (adrenalectomy) may be curative. This is usually performed laparoscopically, through several very small incisions. For patients with hyperplasia of both glands, successful treatment is often achieved with [[spironolactone]] or [[eplerenone]], drugs that block the effect of aldosterone. With its antiandrogen effect, spironolactone drug therapy may have a range of effects in males, including sometimes [[gynecomastia]].  These symptoms usually do not occur with eplerenone drug therapy.<ref>http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=599</ref>

In the absence of proper treatment, individuals with hyperaldosteronism often suffer from poorly controlled high blood pressure, which may be associated with increased rates of stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is excellent.<ref>[http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/cs/pat/adrenal/hyperaldosteronism.html Columbia Adrenal Center, Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Eponym==
Conn's syndrome is named after [[Jerome W. Conn]] (1907–1994), the [[United States|American]] [[endocrinologist]] who first described the condition at the University of Michigan in 1955.<ref name=conn/>
