'''Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum''' (28 December 1828, [[Driesen]] – 15 April 1899, [[Görlitz]]) was a [[German people|German]] [[psychiatrist]].

==Life and career==
In 1855 he received his medical doctorate at [[Berlin]], and subsequently worked as a physician at the mental asylum in [[Wehlau]]. For a period he was also a lecturer at the [[University of Königsberg]] (1863–66), and from 1867 was director of the [[mental hospital]] at [[Görlitz]]. He would remain at Görlitz for the remainder of his life.

As a psychiatrist, Kahlbaum realized that attempting to group mental disorders based on similarities of outward symptoms was futile, and in his work tried to develop a classification system that grouped mental diseases according to their course and outcome. He is remembered for research done at Görlitz with his associate [[Ewald Hecker]] (1843–1909) involving studies of young psychotic patients. In their analyses of mental disorders, Kahlbaum and Hecker introduced a classification system that used descriptive terms such as [[dysthymia]], [[cyclothymia]], [[catatonia]], [[paraphrenia]] and [[hebephrenia]]. In their research they were pioneers in the application of modern clinical practices in the study of mental health.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuhas|first=Daisy|title=Throughout History, Defining Schizophrenia Has Remained a Challenge (Timeline)|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=throughout-history-defining-schizophrenia-has-remained-challenge|publisher=Scientific american Mind (March 2013)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}</ref> 

Kahlbaum referred to ''Jugendliche Irresein'' or "juvenile madness", and stressed the importance of parental upbringing to prevent this condition from occurring. In his research of catatonia, he published the [[monograph]], ''Die Katatonie oder das Spannungsirresein'', in which he characterizes the disorder as disturbance in motor functionality that represents a phase in a progressive illness that includes stages of mania, [[Clinical depression|depression]] and [[psychosis]] that typically ends in dementia.<ref>[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/160/7/1233 American Journal of Psychiatry] Catatonia in Psychiatric Classification: A Home of Its Own</ref>

Kahlbaum's work would in time influence German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]]. Strictly speaking however Kahlbaum's catatonia is not, as is commonly believed, the same as the catatonia found in Emil Kraepelin's concept of [[dementia praecox]]. Rather, as [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] would later complain with respect to dementia praecox, "Kahlbaum's catatonia was liberally extended so as to include everything that showed [[catalepsy]], negativism, automatism, [[stereotypy]], and verbigeration" (Meyer, 1910, p.&nbsp;276).

As the 20th century came to its close, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) would declare that occurrences of catatonia were, by 1987, rare (APA, 1987).

The eponymous "Kahlbaum's syndrome" is a catatonic symptom characterized by continuous and purposeless rhythmic repetition of words and sentences that are meaningless or insignificant.<ref>[http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/579.html] Kahlbaum's syndrome II @ [[Who Named It]]</ref>
