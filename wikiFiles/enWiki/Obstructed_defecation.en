'''Obstructed defecation''' (also known as '''rectal outlet obstruction''', '''evacuatory dysfunction''', '''obstructed defecation syndrome''', '''outlet constipation''', and '''pelvic outlet obstruction'''<ref name=Coloproctology>{{cite book|last=Wexner|first=edited by Andrew P. Zbar, Steven D.|title=Coloproctology|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84882-755-4}}</ref>), is "difficulty in evacuation or emptying the rectum [which] may occur even with frequent visits to the toilet and even with passing soft motions".<ref name="Obstructed Defaecation Web" />  The conditions that can create the symptom are sometimes grouped together as defecation disorders. The symptom [[tenesmus]] is a closely related topic.

Another source defines evacuatory dysfunction as "a constellation of symptoms such as prolonged repeated straining at bowel movements, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and the need for digital manipulation".<ref name=Coloproctology />

Some describe an "obstructed defecation syndrome", defining it loosely as "difficulty in evacuation, which may or may not be associated with constipation"<ref name="Obstructed Defaecation Web">{{cite web|last=Marzouk|first=Deya|title=Obstructed Defaecation Web|url=http://www.obstructed-defaecation.com/Welcome.html|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>

Others inappropriately equate obstructed defecation with [[anismus]].<ref name="Obstructed defecation: current status of pathophysiology and management.">{{cite journal|last=Lubowski|first=DZ|coauthors=King, DW|title=Obstructed defecation: current status of pathophysiology and management.|journal=The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery|date=1995 Feb|volume=65|issue=2|pages=87–92|pmid=7857236}}</ref> Although anismus is a type of obstructed defecation, obstructed defecation has many other possible causes other than anismus.

==Symptoms==

Symptoms include:
*incomplete or unsuccessful attempts to evacuate,
*prolonged episodes on the toilet,
*[[rectal pain]],
*posturing,
*digitations or perineal massage to aid defecation
*[[enema]] dependency

[[Fecal incontinence]] to gas, liquid, solid stool, or mucus in the presence of obstructed defecation symptoms may indicate occult [[rectal prolapse]] (i.e. [[rectal intussusception]]), [[anal sphincter]] dysfunction, or [[descending perineum syndrome]].<ref name=Coloproctology />

==Classification==
Obstructed defecation is one of the causes of chronic constipation.<ref name=Sun1993>{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=WM|title=Obstructed defecation.|journal=Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology|date=1993 Jul-Aug|volume=8|issue=4|pages=383–9|pmid=8374096}}</ref> Obstructed defecation could be considered to be a type of [[bowel obstruction]], where it may be classified under large bowel obstruction. Obstructed defecation frequently gives rise to a symptom called [[tenesmus]]. Constipation, bowel obstruction and [[tenesmus]] are therefore all closely related topics.

Outlet obstruction can be classified into 4 groups.<ref name="The Surgical Management of Evacutory Dysfunction">{{cite book|last=Wexner|first=edited by Andrew P. Zbar, Steven D.|title=Coloproctology|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84882-755-4|pages=140}}</ref>

* [[Functional disorder| Functional]] outlet obstruction
:* Inefficient inhibition of the internal anal sphincter
::* Short-segment [[Hirschsprung's disease]]
::* [[Chagas disease]]
::* Hereditary internal sphincter myopathy
:* Inefficient relaxation of the striated pelvic floor muscles
::* [[Anismus]] (Pelivic floor dyssynergia)
::* [[Multiple sclerosis]]
::* [[Spinal cord]] lesions
* Mechanical outlet obstruction
::* [[Internal intussusception]]

* Dissipation of force vector
::* [[Rectocele]]
::* [[Descending perineum]]
::* [[Rectal prolapse]]
* Impaired rectal sensitivity

==Diagnosis==

The two key features of obstructed defecation are:
:*An inability to voluntarily evacuate rectal contents<ref name="obstructed defecation">{{cite web|last=Welton|first=Mark Lane|title=Obstructed Defecation|url=http://www.health.am/ab/more/obstructed-defecation/|publisher=Armenian Medical Network, Inc|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>
:*Normal [[colonic transit time]]<ref name="obstructed defecation" />

A 5 item questionnaire was validated for diagnosis and grading of obstructed defecation syndrome.<ref name="Renzi 2012" /> The parameters were:

#Excessive straining
#Incomplete rectal evacuation
#Use of [[enemas]] and/or [[laxatives]]
#Vaginal-anal-perineal digitations (needing to press in the back wall of the vagina or on the perineum to aid defecation)
#Abdominal discomfort and/or pain

==Incomplete evacuation==
Obstructed defecation may be a cause of incomplete evacuation of stool.<ref name="Renzi 2012">{{cite journal|last=Renzi|first=A|coauthors=Brillantino, A; Di Sarno, G; d'Aniello, F|title=Five-Item Score for Obstructed Defecation Syndrome: Study of Validation.|journal=Surgical innovation|date=2012 May 17|pmid=22599920}}</ref> Normal emptying of rectal contents is 90-100%. <90% evacuation could be defined as incomplete evacuation. Incomplete evacuation is also one of the factors implicated in the cause of [[fecal leakage]].

==Etiology==
One review stated that the most common causes of disruption to the defecation cycle are associated with pregnancy and childbirth, gynaecological descent or neurogenic disturbances of the brain-bowel axis.<ref name="[Functional obstructed defecation syndrome].">{{cite journal|last=Kairaluoma|first=MV|title=[Functional obstructed defecation syndrome].|journal=Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirja|year=2009|volume=125|issue=2|pages=221–5|pmid=19341037}}</ref> Patients with obstructed defecation appear to have impaired [[pelvic floor]] function.<ref name=Sun1993 />

Specific causes include:
*[[Anismus]]<ref name="[Functional obstructed defecation syndrome]." /> and [[pelvic floor dysfunction]]<ref name="obstructed defecation" />
*[[Rectocele]]<ref name="[Functional obstructed defecation syndrome]." /><ref name="obstructed defecation" />
*"Rectal invagination" (likely refers to [[internal intussusception| rectal intussusception]])<ref name="[Functional obstructed defecation syndrome]." />
*[[Internal anal sphincter]] [[hypertonia]]<ref name="Obstructed defecation: current status of pathophysiology and management.">{{cite journal|last=Lubowski|first=DZ|coauthors=King, DW|title=Obstructed defecation: current status of pathophysiology and management.|journal=The Australian and New Zealand journal of surgery|date=1995 Feb|volume=65|issue=2|pages=87–92|pmid=7857236}}</ref>
*[[Anal stenosis]]<ref name="obstructed defecation" />
*[[Fecal impaction]]<ref name="obstructed defecation" />
*[[Rectal cancer| Rectal]] or [[anal cancer]]<ref name="obstructed defecation" />
*[[Descending perineum syndrome]]<ref name="obstructed defecation" />

==Treatment==
Obstructed defecation has many causes, so the management in any individual case is specific to the cause of the symptom.
