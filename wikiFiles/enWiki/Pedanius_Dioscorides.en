'''Pedanius Dioscorides''' ({{lang-grc|Πεδάνιος Διοσκουρίδης}}; circa 40—90 AD) was a Greek physician, pharmacologist and botanist, the author of ''[[De Materia Medica]]''—a 5-volume encyclopedia about herbal medicine and related medicinal substances (a [[pharmacopeia]]), that was widely read for more than 1,500 years.

==Life==
A native of [[Anazarbus]], [[Cilicia]], [[Asia Minor]], Dioscorides "practiced in Rome at the time of [[Nero]]. He was a surgeon with the army of the emperor, so he had the opportunity to travel extensively, seeking medicinal substances (plants and minerals) from all over the Roman and Greek world."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles and methods of toxicology|editor-first=Andrew Wallace |editor-last=Hayes|page=13|first=Joseph F. |last=Borzelleca|first2=Richard W.|last2=Lane|contribution=The Art, the Science, and the Seduction of Toxicology: an Evolutionary Development|edition=5th|year=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis Group|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Between AD 50 and 70 <ref>http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_dioscorides.html</ref> Dioscorides wrote a five-volume book in his native Greek, ''{{lang|grc|Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς}}'', known more widely by its Latin title ''De Materia Medica'' ("Regarding Medical Materials") which became the precursor to all modern [[pharmacopeia]]s. 

In contrast to many classical authors, Disocorides' works were not "rediscovered"  in the Renaissance, because his book had never left circulation; indeed, with regard to Western materia medica through the early modern period, Dioscorides' text eclipsed the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic corpus]].<ref name="Vos 2010">De Vos (2010) "European Materia Medica in Historical Texts: Longevity of a Tradition and Implications for Future Use", ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' 132(1):28-47</ref> In the medieval period, ''De Materia Medica'' was circulated in Latin, Greek, and Arabic.<ref>Some detail about medieval manuscripts of ''De Materia Medica'' at [http://www.ibidispress.scriptmania.com/custom.html Ibidis Press]</ref> While being reproduced in manuscript form through the centuries, it was often supplemented with commentary and minor additions from Arabic and Indian sources. A number of illustrated manuscripts of the ''De Materia Medica'' survive. The most famous of these is the lavishly illustrated ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'' produced in Constantinople in 512/513 AD. Densely illustrated Arabic copies survive from the 12th and 13th centuries, while the most important Greek manuscripts survive today in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. 

''De Materia Medica'' is the premiere historical source of information about the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the [[Dacian language|Dacian]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Nutton |first=Vivian | title = Ancient Medicine | publisher = Routledge | year = 2004|ref=CITEREFNutton2004}}.

Pages 75-76.</ref> although the descriptions are sometimes obscurely phrased: "Numerous individuals from the Middle Ages on have struggled with the identity of the recondite kinds"<ref>Isely, Duane (1994). One hundred and one botanists. Iowa State University Press.</ref> and some of the botanical identifications remain merely guesses.

The importance of Dioscorides' contribution should not be underestimated. His [[materia medica]] formed the core of the European pharmacopeia through the 19th century, from which it may be surmised that "the timelessness of Dioscorides' work resulted from an empirical tradition based on trial and error; that it worked for generation after generation despite social and cultural changes and changes in medical theory".<ref name="Vos 2010"/>
