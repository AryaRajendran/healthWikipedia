Ocular surgery may be performed under [[topical anaesthesia|topical]], [[local anaesthesia|local]] or [[general anesthesia]]. Local anaesthesia is more preferred because it is economical, easy to perform and the risk involved is less. Local anaesthesia has a rapid onset of action and provides a dilated [[pupil]] with low [[intraocular pressure]].

==History==
[[Susruta Samhita]] has evidences of use of anaesthesia for ocular surgeries. Inhalational anaesthesia was used for this purpose. Egyptian surgeons used carotid compression to produce transient [[ischemia]] during eye surgery to reduce the perception of pain. In 1884, [[Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|Karl Koller]] used [[cocaine]] for ocular surgery. The same year, [[Herman Knapp]] used cocaine for retrobulbar block. In 1914, van Lint achieved [[orbicularis oculi|orbicularis]] akinesia by local injection.

==Topical (Surface) anaesthesia==
Surface anaesthesia is given by instillation of 2.5 ml [[xylocaine]]. One drop of xylocaine instilled four times after every 4 minutes will produce conjunctival and corneal anaesthesia. [[Paracaine]], [[tetracaine]], [[bupivacaine]], [[lidocaine]] etc. may also be used in place of xylocaine.<ref name=anaesoc /> Cataract surgery by [[phacoemulsification]] is frequently performed under surface anaesthesia. [[Facial nerve]], which supplies the orbicularis oculi muscle is blocked in addition for intraocular surgeries. Topical anaesthesia is known to cause endothelial and epithelial toxicity, allergy and surface keratopathy.

===Facial block===
There are three types of facial block : van Lint's block, Atkinson block, O' Brien block and Nadbath block.
* '''van Lint's block''' : In van Lint's block, the peripheral branches of facial nerve are blocked. This technique causes akinesia of orbicularis oculi muscle without associated [[facial paralysis]]. 2.5 ml of anaesthetic solution is injected just above the eyebrow and below the inferior orbital margin, through a point about 2&nbsp;cm behind the lateral orbital margin in level with the outer canthus of the eye.<ref name=SydneyUni>{{cite web|last=Calobrizi, Cousins|title=Anaesthesia for eye surgery|url=http://www.anaesthesia.med.usyd.edu.au/resources/lectures/eye_anaes_nr.html|publisher=The University of Sydney|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref name= Yap>{{cite web|last=Yap|first=E.Y|title=A review of Anaesthesia in Ophthalmology|url=http://smj.sma.org.sg/3403/3403a9.pdf|publisher=Singapore Medical Journal|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>
* '''O' Brien's block''' : It is also known as facial nerve trunk block. The block is done at the level of the neck of the [[mandible]] near the condyloid process. The needle is inserted at this point and about 4 ml of local anaesthetic is injected while withdrawing the needle. Pain at the injection site may occur if O' Brien's block is applied.<ref name=Yap />
* '''Atkinson's block''' : The superior branch of the facial nerve are blocked by injecting the anaesthetic solution at the inferior margin of [[zygomatic bone]].
* '''Nadbath block''' : In Nadbath block, the facial nerve is blocked at the [[stylomastoid foramen]]. The patient is likely to experience pain.

===Retrobulbar block===
This technique was first practiced by Dr. [[Herman Knapp]] in 1884. Here, 2% xylocaine is introduced into the muscle cone behind the eyeball. The injection is usually given through the inferior fornix of the skin of outer part of lower lid when the eye is in primary gaze. The [[ciliary nerve]]s, [[ciliary ganglion]], [[oculomotor nerve]] and [[abducens nerve]] are anesthetized in retrobulbar block.<ref name=SydneyUni /> As a result, global akinesia, anaesthesia and analgesia are produced. The [[superior oblique muscle]], which is outside the muscle cone, is not usually paralyzed. The complications of retrobulbar block are globe perforation, [[optic nerve]] injury, retrobulbar [[haemorrhage]] and extraocular muscle palsy. Retrobulbar anaesthesia is contraindicated in posterior [[staphyloma]], high axial [[myopia]] and [[enopthalmos]].<ref name= nysora />

===Peribulbar block===
This technique was first applied by Davis. In peribulbar block, 6 ml of local anaesthetic is injected to the peripheral spaces of the orbit. The anaesthetic diffuses into the muscle cone and [[eyelid]]s, causing global and orbicularis akinesia and anaesthesia. After injection, orbital compression is applied for around 15 minutes.<ref name=nysora>{{cite web|title=Local and Regional Anaesthesia for Eye surgery|url=http://www.nysora.com/regional_anesthesia/sub-specialties/opthamology/3118-anesthesia_for_eye_surgery.html|publisher=NYSORA}}</ref>

==Regional (local) anaesthesia==
Nearly all ocular surgeries ''viz'' [[keratoplasty]], [[cataract extraction]], [[glaucoma surgery]],  [[iridectomy]], [[strabismus]],<ref name=pedeye>{{cite web|title=Anaesthesia for adults having eye surgery|url=http://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/23|publisher=American Association for Pediatric ophthalmology and Strabismus|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref> retinal detachment surgery etc. can be done under regional anaesthesia. [[Conjunctiva]], [[eyeball|globe]] and orbicularis can be paralysed using a combination of surface anaesthesia, facial anaesthesia and retrobulbar block.<ref name=anaesoc>{{cite web|last=Pittmann|first=James|title=Local anaesthesia for eye surgery|url=http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u12/u1205_01.htm|publisher=World Federation of Socities of Anaesthetologists|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref> The advantage is that it requires lest post operative restlessness. It has less post operative lung complications and less bleeding.<ref name=SydneyUni />

==General anaesthesia==
General anaesthesia is preferred for ocular surgeries in anxious adults, psychiatric patients, infants and children.<ref name=pedeye /> It is also indicated in perforating ocular injuries and major surgeries like exenteration. During the surgery, it has to be ensured that no carbon dioxide retention occurs. If this occurs, the [[choroid]] swells up and ocular contents may prolapse as soon as the eye is opened. The advantages of general anaesthesia is that it produces complete akinesia, controlled [[intraocular pressure]] and safe operating environment. It is the safest option for bilateral surgery. The complications of general anaesthesia are [[laryngospasm]], [[hypotension]], [[hypercarbia]], respiratory depression and [[cardiac arrhythmia]].
