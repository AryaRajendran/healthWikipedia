'''Norplant''' is a form of [[birth control]] developed by [[Sheldon Segal|Sheldon J. Segal]] and Horatio B. Croxatto at the [[Population Council]] beginning in 1966, with the first clinical trial in [[Chile]] in 1974.<ref name="IOM 1993">{{cite book|author=Subcommittee for Workshop on Implant Contraceptives, Committee on Contraceptive Research and Development, Division of Health Policy, Institute of Medicine|date=March 9, 1998|chapter=Appendix B: Norplant: historical background|editor1-last=Harrison|editor1-first=Polly F.|editor2-last=Rosenfield|editor2-first=Allan|title=Contraceptive research, introduction, and use: lessons from Norplant|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=National Academy Press|pages=107–114|isbn=978-0-309-05985-5|chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5946&page=107}}</ref><ref name="Sivin 2002">{{cite book|last1=Sivin|first1=Irving|last2=Nash|first2=Harold|last3=Waldman|first3=Sandra|date=February 28, 2002|chapter=Development and introduction of contraceptive implants|title=Jadelle® levonorgestrel rod implants: a summary of scientific data and lessons learned from programmatic experience|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=Population Council|isbn=0-87834-105-6|pages=1–6|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/jadelle_monograph.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Gunardi 2011">{{cite journal|last1=Gunardi|first1=Eka Rusdianto|last2=Affandi|first2=Biran|last3=Muchtar|first3=Armen|date=January 2011|title=Monoplant® the Indonesian implant: the overview of implant and its development|journal=Indoesian Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=35|issue=1|pages=40–46|issn=0303-7924|url=http://indonesia.digitaljournals.org/index.php/IJOG/article/view/1002}}</ref> It was first approved in [[Finland]] on November 23, 1983, where it was manufactured by Leiras Oy Pharmaceuticals.<ref name="Roy 1985">{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Subir|year=1985|chapter=Current status of Norplant subdermal implants for contraception|editor1-last=Runnebaum|editor1-first=Benno|editor2-last=Rabe|editor2-first=Thomas|editor3-last=Kiesel|editor3-first=Ludwig|title=Future aspects in contraception: proceedings of an international symposium held in Heidelberg, 5–8 September 1984; Part 2, Female contraception|location=Boston, Mass.|publisher=MTP Press|isbn=0-85200-906-2|pages=95–106|chapterurl=http://www.popline.org/node/419015|quote=The Finnish National Board of Health approved the NORPLANT sub-dermal implant system as a contraceptive method in Finland on 23 November 1983.}}</ref> The original Norplant consisted of a set of six small (2.4&nbsp;mm × 34&nbsp;mm) [[silicone]] capsules, each filled with 36&nbsp;mg of [[levonorgestrel]] (a [[progestin]] used in many birth control pills) implanted subdermally in the upper arm and effective for five years.<ref>[http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~monac/norplant.html Norplant<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The original (six capsule) Norplant's production has been phased out; [[USAID]]'s contract ran until December 2006.<ref>[http://www.jhuccp.org/pearls/pearl.php?id=325 CCP: Pearl of the Week<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The original (six capsule) Norplant was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on December 10, 1990, and marketed in the United States in 1991 by [[Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>Grimes, William.

'''Norplant II''' (Norplant-2, '''Jadelle'''), also developed by the Population Council and manufactured by [[Schering|Schering Oy]], consists of two small (2.5&nbsp;mm × 43&nbsp;mm) silicone rods each containing 75&nbsp;mg of levonorgestrel in a polymer matrix, instead of six capsules. It was approved May 31, 1996 by the FDA as being effective for three years; it was subsequently approved November 22, 2002 by the FDA as being effective for five years.

== Insertion ==
Norplant is implanted under the skin in the upper arm of a woman, by creating a small incision and inserting the capsules in a fanlike shape. Insertion of Norplant usually takes 15 minutes and the capsules can sometimes be seen under the skin, although usually they look like small [[vein]]s. They can also be felt under the skin. Once inserted, the contraceptive works within 24 hours and lasts up to five years.

== Function and effectiveness ==
Norplant works by preventing [[ovulation]], which means that no [[ovum|eggs]] are released for [[fertilization]], by thickening the [[mucus]] of the [[cervix]], which prevents [[spermatozoon|sperm]] from entering; and by thinning the lining of the uterus, which makes implantation of an embryo less likely.

The way in which Norplant causes these effects is by use of hormones.  A small amount of the [[hormone]] progestin is released through the capsules continuously, more during the first year and a half, but then at a level similar to most contraceptive pills afterward. According to studies completed, Norplant has been shown to be 99%{{spaced ndash}}99.95% effective at preventing [[pregnancy]], and is one of the most reliable, though not the most available, forms of birth control.

Like all hormonal contraception, Norplant does not protect against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.

== Contraindications ==
Norplant should not be used in women with [[liver|liver disease]], [[breast cancer]], or [[blood clot]]s. Women who believe they may already be pregnant or those with vaginal bleeding should first see a physician. However, since Norplant does not contain [[estrogen]] like some birth control pills, older women, women who smoke, and women with [[arterial hypertension|high blood pressure]] are not restricted from using the system.

== Side effects ==
After three months of using Norplant, women will need to schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor [[blood pressure]] and discuss any concerns. [[Adverse effect (medicine)|Side effects]] may include irregular [[menstrual cycle|menstrual period]]s for the first approximately three months, including periods lasting longer than normal, [[bleeding]] or spotting between periods, heavy bleeding, or going with no period for the mentioned period of time.  Common side effects include [[weight gain]], 
[[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[anxiety]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[mastalgia]], [[dizziness]], [[dermatitis]]/[[rash]], [[hirsutism]], [[baldness|scalp-hair loss]], [[headache]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[Acne vulgaris|acne]]. Sometimes, [[pain]], [[itching]] or infection at the site of the implant will occur. [[Ovarian cyst]]s may also occur, but usually do not require treatment, although they can cause pain even if [[benign]].

== Removal ==
Norplant can be removed at any time by creating a second incision and withdrawing the capsules. Norplant is normally removed when the five year period is over, or if:

* Pregnancy is desired
* Different birth control is preferred
* Complications arise

Normally removal is not complicated; removal difficulties have been reported with a frequency of 6.2%, based on 849 removals. Removal difficulties include: multiple incisions, capsule fragments remaining, pain, multiple visits, deep placement, lengthy removal procedure, or other.<ref>[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic2/norplant_ad.htm Norplant side effects (Levonorgestrel (Unavailable in US)) and drug interactions - prescription drugs and medications at RxList<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

If desired, a new implant can be inserted at the time of removal.

==Availability==
=== Norplant discontinued in the United States ===
By 1996, more than 50,000 women had filed lawsuits, including 70 class actions, against Wyeth and/or its subsidiaries, or doctors who prescribed Norplant.<!--
  --><ref>{{cite news | author=Erica Johnson | title=Medical device lawsuits | url=http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/health/medical_devices/lawsuits.html | date=April 1, 2003 | publisher=CBC news}}</ref> Wyeth never lost a Norplant lawsuit, even in cases which came before a jury.<!--
  --><ref>http://www.arhp.org/files/ndicimplants.pdf</ref>

On August 26, 1999, after winning 3 jury verdicts, 20 pretrial [[summary judgment]]s and the [[involuntary dismissal|dismissal]] of 14,000 claims, Wyeth offered out-of-court cash [[settlement (law)|settlements]] of $1,500 each to about 36,000 women who contended that they had not been adequately warned about possible side effects of Norplant such as irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea and depression. Wyeth said that most of the plaintiffs experienced routine side effects described in Norplant's labeling information. Wyeth did not admit to any wrongdoing, saying the settlement offer "was purely a business decision," noting "our legal success has come at a steep price because lawsuits are time-consuming, expensive, and have a chilling effect on research," and that it would continue to offer Norplant and would contest "any and all new lawsuits aggressively."<!--
 --><ref>{{cite journal |author= |month=September 5, |year=1998 |title=Contraceptive Maker Wins Woman's Suit Over Side Effects |journal=[[The New York Times]]| pages=A.7 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9500E5D7163EF936A3575AC0A96E958260}}</ref><!--

About 32,000 women accepted the out-of-court $1,500 settlements. On August 14, 2002, Wyeth won [[partial summary judgment]] and dismissal of the claims of the 2,960 remaining plaintiffs who had not accepted Wyeth's out-of-court settlement offer.<!--

In August 2000, Wyeth suspended shipments of Norplant in the United States because during regular quality assurance monitoring, representative samples of seven lots distributed beginning October 20, 1999 tested within product specifications, but at the lower end of the release rate specification for shelf life stability, raising concerns about those lots' contraceptive effectiveness. Wyeth recommended that women who had Norplant capsules from those lots implanted use backup contraception until they determined the clinical relevance of the atypically low levels of levonorgestrel release.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2000/safety00.htm#norpla Medwatch - 2000 Safety Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On July 26, 2002, Wyeth announced that data from investigations conducted in women with Norplant capsules from the suspect lots did not suggest less contraceptive effectiveness than that reported in clinical trials, and that therefore backup contraception could be safely discontinued. Wyeth also announced that due to limitations in product component supplies, they did not plan to resume marketing the six-capsule Norplant system in the United States.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01161.html Update on Advisory for Norplant Contraceptive Kits<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===New Zealand ===
Jadelle will be subsidized for use in New Zealand by government medical body PHARMAC from August 2010. Medical professionals raised concerns during a consultation process indicating preference for a product which is easier to insert. The agreement between Bayer New Zealand and PHARMAC was conditional on Bayer New Zealand providing adequate training to ensure doctors are comfortable in the insertion and removal technique. <ref>[http://www.pharmac.govt.nz/2010/07/01/Notification%20of%20approved%20Jadelle%20funding%20proposal.pdf] Pharmac - Jadelle funding</ref> The consultation process is not public and it is unclear if this addresses the concerns raised. Medical professionals also suggested follow up. PHARMAC will 'suggest' this to the manufacturer.

===Use in the developing world===
Despite its discontinuation in the US and the West, Norplant is still used in the developing world. According to one study 6.2 out of 100 rural women interviewed in one region in Bangladesh use the device, according to the [[United Nations Population Fund]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Norplant and other implantable contraceptives are especially effective in the developing world, as they do not require daily administration or access to a hospital to be effective.  In addition, no continual contraceptive supplies (pills, condoms, etc.) are necessary, and it is a highly effective, low cost contraceptive over the long term.
