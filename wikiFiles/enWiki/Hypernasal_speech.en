'''Hypernasal speech''' (also '''hyperrhinolalia''' or '''open nasality'''; medically known as '''Rhinolalia aperta''' from Latin ''rhinolalia'': "nasal speech" and ''aperta'': "open") is a disorder that causes abnormal [[resonance]] in a human's voice due to increased [[airflow]] through the nose during speech. It is caused by an open [[nasal cavity]] resulting from an incomplete closure of the [[soft palate]] and/or velopharyngeal sphincter.{{cn|date=May 2012}}

== Anatomy ==
[[File:Head neck vsphincter.png|thumb|Nasal and oral cavities with the velopharyngeal sphincter highlighted in blue]]
The [[palate]] comprises two parts, the [[hard palate|hard palate (palatum durum)]] and the [[Soft palate|soft palate (palatum molle)]], which is connected to the [[uvula]]. The movements of the soft palate and the uvula are made possible by the velopharyngeal sphincter.{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Does the v.sphincter ENABLE or CONTROL the movements?}} During speech or swallowing, the uvula lifts against the back throat wall to close the nasal cavity. When producing [[nasal consonants]] (such as "m", "n", and "ng"), the uvula remains relaxed, thereby enabling the air to go through the nose.

The [[Eustachian tube]], which opens near the velopharyngeal sphincter, connects the [[middle ear]] and [[Human pharynx#Nasopharynx|nasal pharynx]]. Normally, the tube ensures [[aeration]] and drainage (of secretions) of the middle ear. Narrow and closed at rest, it opens during swallowing and yawning, controlled by the [[tensor veli palatini]] and the [[levator veli palatini]] (muscles of the soft palate). Children with a [[cleft palate]] have difficulties controlling these muscles and thus are unable to open the Eustachian tube. Secretions accumulate in the middle ear when the tube remains dysfunctional over a long period of time, which cause hearing loss and [[ear infection|middle ear infections]]. Ultimately, hearing loss can lead to impaired speech and language development.<ref>{{cite web|title=Specifieke informatie over schisis per type schisis|url=http://www.schisis.nl/nvsca/pag.php?id=paK&item=pal#palsluit01||publisher=Nederlandse Vereniging voor Schisis en Craniofaciale Afwijkingen|accessdate=20 May 2012|trans_title=Specific information on each type of cleft lip and palate cleft|language=Dutch|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Stegenga|first1=B.|last2=Vissink|first2=A.|last3=Bont|first3=L.G.M. de|title=Mondziekten en kaakchirurgie|year=2000|publisher=Van Gorcum|location=Assen|isbn=9789023235002|page=388|trans_title=Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|language=Dutch}}</ref>

== Causes ==
[[File:Cleftpalate3.png|thumb|Incomplete cleft palate]]
The general term for disorders of the velopharyngeal valve is '''velopharyngeal dysfunction''' (VPD). It includes three subterms: velopharyngeal insufficiency, [[velopharyngeal inadequacy]], and velopharyngeal mislearning.
*'''Velopharyngeal insufficiency''' can be caused by an anatomical abnormality of the throat. It occurs in children with a history of cleft palate or submucous cleft, who have short or otherwise abnormal [[Soft palate|vela]]. Velopharyngeal insufficiency can also occur after [[adenoidectomy]].
*'''Velopharyngeal incompetence''' is a defective closure of the velopharyngeal valve due to its lack of speed and precision. It is caused by a neurologic disorder or injury (e.g. [[cerebral palsy]] or traumatic brain injury).
*Sometimes children present no abnormalities yet still have hypernasal speech: this can be due to '''velopharyngeal mislearning''', indicating that the child has been imitating{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Imitating whom?}} or has never learned how to use the valve correctly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/assets/0/78/759/781/65e90133-9243-4926-a065-8a97951944fb.pdf|last=Kummer|first=Ann W.|title=Speech Therapy for Cleft Palate or Velopharyngeal Dysfunction (VPD)|publisher=Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center}}</ref><ref name=emedicine>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/873018-overview#a0101|title=Velopharyngeal Insufficiency|last=Biavati|first=Michael J.|last2=Sie|first2=Kathleen|last3=Wiet|first3=Gregory J.|date=2 September 2011|publisher=WebMD LLC|work=Medscape Reference}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
There are several methods for diagnosing hypernasality.
*A speech therapist listens to and records the child while analysing perceptual speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://childrensnyp.org/mschony/otolaryngology-hypernasality.html|title=Otolaryngology (Ear, Nose and Throat)|author=Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital|publisher=Columbia University Medical Center}}</ref> In hypernasality, the child cannot produce [[oral consonant|oral sounds]] (vowels and consonants) correctly. Only the nasal sounds can be be correctly produced.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gelder|first=van J.|title=De open neusspraak, pathogenese en diagnostiek|language=Dutch|journal=Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde [Netherlands Journal of Medicine]|year=1957|volume=101|pages=1005–10}}</ref> A hearing test is also desirable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entcolumbia.org/hypernas.html|title=Hypernasality – Velopharyngeal Insufficiency|author=Department of Otolarynology/Head and Neck Surgery|publisher=Columbia University Medical Center}}</ref>
*A mirror is held beneath the nose while the child pronounces the vowels. Nasal air escape, and thus hypernasality, is indicated if the mirror fogs up.
*A pressure-flow technique is used to measure velopharyngeal orifice area during the speech. The patient must be at least three to four years old.
*A video nasopharyngeal [[endoscopy]] observes velopharyngeal function, movements of the soft palate, and pharyngeal walls. It utilises a very small scope placed in the back of the nasal cavity. The doctor will then ask the child to say a few words. The patient must be at least three to four years old to ensure cooperation.
*A [[Fluoroscopy|cinefluoroscopy]] gives dynamic visualisation and can easier be applied to younger children, though it has the disadvantage of [[Ionizing radiation#Medical, biological and sterilization applications|exposing the patient to radiation]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Rudolf|last1=Probst|first2=Gerhard|last2=Grevers|first3=Heinrich|last3=Iro|translator=Telger, Terry|illustrator=Baum, Karin|title=Basic Otorhinolaryngology a step-by-step learning guide|year=2006|publisher=Thieme|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783131324412|edition=revised|page=401}}</ref>
*A nasometer calculates the ratio of nasality. The patient wears a headset, where the oral and nasal cavities are separated by a plate.{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=Are the cavities separated by the headset? Or is separation a separate procedure?}} On both sides of the plate are microphones. The ratio calculated by the nasometer indicates the amount of nasality, with a higher ratio indicating more nasality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kayelemetrics.com/index.php?option=com_product&Itemid=3&controller=product&task=learn_more&cid%5B%5D=78|title=Nasometer II, Model 6450|author=KayPENTAX|publisher=PENTAX Medical Company}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
=== Speech therapy ===
In cases of muscle weakness or cleft palate, special exercises can help to strengthen the soft palate muscles with the ultimate aim of decreasing airflow through the nose and thereby increasing intelligibility. Intelligibility requires the ability to close the nasal cavity, as all English sounds, except "m", "n", and "ng", have airflow only through the mouth. Normally, by age three, a child can raise the muscles of the soft palate to close to nasal cavity.

==== Exercises ====
If a child finds it difficult to blow, pinching the nose can help regulate airflow. The child should then practise without pinching the nose, doing exercises such as blowing out a candle, blowing away tissues through a drinking straw, and, for sucking, drinking through a straw.

This exercises only work as treatments if hypernasality is small. Severe deviations should be treated surgically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schisis.nl/nvsca/pag.php?id=paK&item=spraak|title=Spraak en taal|language=Dutch|trans_title=Speech and Language|publisher=Nederlandse Vereniging voor Schisis en Craniofaciale Afwijkingen}}</ref>

=== Surgery ===
The two main surgical techniques for correcting the aberrations the soft palate present in hypernasality are the posterior pharyngeal flap and the sphincter pharyngoplasty. After surgical interventions, speech therapy is necessary to learn how to control the newly constructed flaps.<ref name=lianne>{{cite journal|last1=de Serres|first1=Lianne M.|last2=Deleyiannis|first2=Frederic W.-B.|last3=Eblen|first3=Linda E.|last4=Gruss|first4=Joseph S.|last5=Richardson|first5=Mark A.|last6=Sie|first6=Kathleen C.Y.|title=Results with sphincter pharyngoplasty and pharyngeal flap|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|year=1999|month=April|volume=48|issue=1|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/S0165-5876(99)00006-3}}</ref>

====Posterior pharyngeal flap====
{{see also|Pharyngeal flap surgery}}
Posterior pharyngeal flap surgery is mostly used for vertical clefts of the soft palate. The surgeon cuts through the upper layers of the back of the throat, creating a small square of tissue. This flap remains attached on one side (usually at the top). The other side is attached to (parts of) the soft palate. This ensures that the nasal cavity is partially separated from the oral cavity. When the child speaks, the remaining openings close from the side due to the narrowing of the throat caused by the muscle movements necessary for speech. In a relaxed state, the openings allow breathing through the nose.<ref name=lianne />

====Sphincter pharyngoplasty====
Sphincter pharyngolplasty is mostly used for horizontal clefts of the soft palate. Two small flaps are made on the left and right side of the entrance to the nasal cavity, attached to the back of the throat. For good results, the patient must have good palatal motion, as the [[occlusive|occlusion]] of the nasal cavity is mainly carried out by muscles already existing and functioning.<ref name=lianne />

}}

==== Complications ====
The most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap are [[hyponasality]], nasal obstruction, [[snoring]], and [[sleep apnea]]. Rarer complications include flap separation, [[sinusitis]], postoperative bleeding, and aspiration [[pneumonia]]. Possible complications of the sphincter pharyngoplasty are snoring, nasal obstruction, difficulty blowing the nose.

Some researches suggest that sphincter pharyngoplasty introduces less hyponasality and obstructive sleep symptoms than the posterior pharyngeal wall flap. Both surgeries have a favourable effect on the function of the Eustachian tube.<ref name=emedicine />
