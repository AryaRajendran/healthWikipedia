A '''rare disease''', also referred to as an '''orphan disease''', is any disease that affects a small percentage of the population. 

Most rare diseases are genetic, and thus are present throughout the person's entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear.  Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30 percent of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siope.eu/SIOPE-EU/English/SIOPE-EU/Advocacy-Activities/Rare-Diseases/page.aspx/148 |title=Rare Diseases |publisher=Siope.Eu |date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> With a single diagnosed patient only, [[ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency]] is presently considered the rarest genetic disease.

No single cutoff number has been agreed upon for which a disease is considered rare. A disease may be considered rare in one part of the world, or in a particular group of people, but still be common in another.

==Definition==
There is no single, widely accepted definition for rare diseases.  Some definitions rely solely on the number of people living with a disease, and other definitions include other factors, such as the existence of adequate treatments or the severity of the disease.

In the [[United States of America|United States]], the [[Rare Diseases Act of 2002]] defines ''rare disease'' strictly according to prevalence, specifically "any disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States,"<ref name=RDA2002>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ280.107 Rare Disease Act of 2002]</ref> or about 1 in 1,500 people.  This law also states that rare diseases and ultra rare diseases must be included on the USMLE because they are trivial.  This definition is essentially like that of the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]], a federal law that was written to encourage research into rare diseases and possible cures.

In Japan, the legal definition of a rare disease is one that affects fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan, or about 1 in 2,500 people.<ref name=Italy>[http://malattierare.regione.veneto.it/inglese/dicosaparliamo_ing.php Rare diseases: what are we talking about?]</ref>

However, the [[European Commission]] on Public Health defines rare diseases as "life-threatening or [[chronic (medicine)|chronically]] debilitating diseases which are of such low prevalence that special combined efforts are needed to address them."<ref name=EU>{{cite web | accessdate=19 May 2009 | title=Useful Information on Rare Diseases from an EU Perspective | url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/documents/ev20040705_rd05_en.pdf | publisher=European Commission}}</ref>  The term ''low prevalence'' is later defined as generally meaning fewer than 1 in 2,000 people.  Diseases that are statistically rare, but not also life-threatening, chronically debilitating, or inadequately treated, are excluded from their definition.

The definitions used in the medical literature and by national health plans are similarly divided, with definitions ranging from 1/1,000 to 1/200,000.<ref name=Italy />

==Relationship to orphan diseases==
Because of definitions that include reference to treatment availability, a lack of resources, and severity of the disease, some people{{Who|date=July 2010}} prefer the term ''orphan disease'' and use it as a synonym for ''rare disease''.<ref name=Italy/>  The [[orphan drug]] movement began in the United States.<ref name=Italy/><!--- Note that the term orphan disease is a legal definition in the USA and the EU. --->

Others distinguish between the two terms.  For example, the [[European Organization for Rare Diseases]] (EURORDIS) lumps both rare diseases and [[neglected diseases]] into a larger category of ''orphan diseases''.<ref name=Eurodis>{{cite web | url= http://www.eurordis.org/IMG/pdf/princeps_document-EN.pdf | title=Rare Diseases: Understanding This Public Health Priority | publisher= European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) | date= November 2005 | accessdate=16 May 2009}}</ref>

The United States' [[Orphan Drug Act]] includes both rare diseases and any non-rare diseases "for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will [be] recovered from sales in the United States of such drug" as ''orphan diseases''.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/Overview/ucm119477.htm Orphan Drug Act] §526(a)(2)</ref>

==Prevalence==
[[Prevalence]] (number of people living with a disease at a given moment), rather than [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] (number of new diagnoses in a given year), is used to describe the impact of rare diseases. The [[Global Genes Project]] estimates there are some 350 million people worldwide currently affected with a rare disease. 

The [[European Organization for Rare Diseases]] (EURORDIS) estimates that as many as 5,000 to 7,000 distinct rare diseases exist, and as much as 6% to 8% of the population of the [[European Union]] is affected by one.<ref name=Eurodis />

Rare diseases can vary in prevalence between populations, so a disease that is rare in some populations may be common in others.  This is especially true of [[genetic disease]]s and [[infectious disease]]s.  An example is [[cystic fibrosis]], a genetic disease:  it is rare in most parts of [[Asia]] but relatively common in Europe and in populations of European descent.  In smaller communities, the [[founder effect]] can result in a disease that is very rare worldwide being prevalent within the smaller community.  Many infectious diseases are prevalent in a given geographic area but rare everywhere else.  Other diseases, such as many rare forms of [[cancer]], have no apparent pattern of distribution but are simply rare.  The classification of other conditions depends in part on the population being studied:  All forms of cancer in children are generally considered rare, because so few children develop cancer, but the same cancer in adults may be more common.

About 40 rare diseases have a far higher prevalence in [[Finland]];  these are known collectively as the [[Finnish disease heritage]].

Classification of a disease's rarity also depends on the population being studied. Every form of [[cancer]] is rare among children,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecpc-online.org/newsletter/member-updates/168-rare-cancer-day.html |title=02/2009: Rare Cancers on Rare Disease Day |publisher=Ecpc-online.org |date=2009-02-28 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> but some forms are common among adults.

Symptoms of some rare diseases may appear at birth or in childhood, whereas others only appear once adulthood is reached.

Research publications emphasize rare diseases that are chronic or incurable, although many [[acute (medicine)|short-term medical conditions]] are also rare diseases.<ref>{{cite journal

The [[Global Genes Project]] is one of the leading rare and genetic disease patient advocacy organizations in the world. The non-profit organization is led by [http://globalgenes.org/leadership/ Team R.A.R.E.] (R.A.R.E stands for Rare disease, Advocacy, Research and Education).

What began as a grassroots movement in 2009 with a few rare disease parent advocates and foundations has grown to over 500 global organizations. Global Genes uses a simple concept of "genes and jeans" to broadly promote the needs of the rare and genetic disease community. The organization has launched a number of innovative rare and genetic disease awareness campaigns including, [http://globalgenes.org/category/patient_stories/ Hope, It's In Our Genes™], [http://globalgenes.org/wear-that-you-care/ Wear That You Care™], [http://globalgenes.org/7000-bracelets-for-hope/ 7,000 Bracelets for Hope™] to represent the 7,000 different rare diseases and Unite 1 Million For RARE™ disease.

The [[Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders]] (CORD) is the national network of organizations who represent people affected by rare disorders within Canada. CORD's intention is to provide a strong common voice advocating for a healthcare system and health policy for those with rare disorders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raredisorders.ca |title=Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders |publisher=Raredisorders.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref>

Patients with rare diseases in Greece are represented by the [[Greek Alliance of Rare Diseases]].
