'''Dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency''' is a condition involving inadequate [[Dopamine beta hydroxylase]].

==Symptoms==
A deficiency of [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]] that causes [[orthostatic hypotension]], nasal stuffiness, and droopy eyelids ([[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]) among other symptoms. Some people refer to this as [[norepinephrine]] deficiency. It's caused by largely increased amounts of serum [[dopamine]] and release of dopamine in place of norepinephrine. It is difficult for people with this to stand still for longer than one minute. Another symptom is [[hypoglycemia]] which is thought to be caused by adrenomedullary failure and the T-wave abnormalities from failure of noradrenergic control. Also, [[prolactin]] is frequently suppressed by excessive [[dopamine]]. This can also have an impact on digestion. "Dopamine has an emetic effect and inhibitis digestive motricity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacorama.com/en/Sections/Catecholamines_7_4.php |title=Dopamine receptor antagonists |publisher=Pharmacorama |date=2005-06-19 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref> People with dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency may have a paradoxical response to NRI antidepressant medication such as Edronax—they may experience more depression, less energy, and become more sleepy.
This is a form of [[dysautonomia]] but differentiated from [[familial dysautonomia]] by lack of familial dysautonomic symptoms such as loss of sense of pain and smell.

==Medications==
Most people can be treated using L-Threo-DOPS. Some other OTC medications can be beneficial as well. Researchers of disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[migraines]] are very interested in studying this disorder, as the persons generally have triple fold amounts of dopamine in their system and yet are generally normal.

==Circumstances to Avoid==
Untreated individuals with DBH deficiency should avoid hot environments, strenuous exercise, standing still, and dehydration.
