'''Theriac''' or '''theriaca''' was a medical concoction originally formulated by the [[Greeks]] in the 1st century AD and became adopted in the ancient world as far away as [[China]] and [[India]] via the trading links of the [[Silk Route]].<ref name="boulnois"/> It was an [[alexipharmic|alexipharmic, or antidote]], considered a universal [[panacea]],<ref>

The word ''theriac'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''θηριακή'' (''thēriakē''), the feminine of ''θηριακός'' (''thēriakos''), signifying "pertaining to animals",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dqhriako%2Fs θηριακός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> from ''θηρίον'' (''thērion''), "wild animal, beast".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dqhri%2Fon θηρίον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>  The ancient [[bestiary|bestiaries]] included information—often fanciful—about dangerous beasts and their bites. When [[cane sugar]] was an exotic Eastern commodity, the English recommended the sugar-based [[treacle]] as an antidote against poison,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/treacle | title = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''treacle'' | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> originally applied as a [[salve]].<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''s.v.'' "Treacle".</ref> By extension, ''treacle'' could be applied to any healing property: in the Middle Ages the  treacle (''i.e.'' healing) well at [[Binsey, Oxfordshire|Binsey]] was a place of pilgrimage.

[[Norman Cantor]] observes<ref>Cantor 2001:174.</ref> that the remedy was [[homeopathic]] in its supposed effect, following the principle of "the hair of the dog," in which a concoction containing some of the poisonous (it was thought) flesh of the serpent would be a sovereign remedy against the creature's venom: in his book on medicine,<ref>''Livre de seyntz medicines'', 1354.</ref> [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster]] wrote that "the treacle is made of poison so that it can destroy other poisons".  Thinking by [[analogy]], Henry Grosmont also thought of theriac as a moral curative, the medicine "to make a man reject the poisonous sin which has entered into his soul." Since the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], and notably the [[Black Death]], was believed to have been sent by [[God]] as a punishment for [[sin]] and had its origins in pestilential serpents that poisoned the rivers, theriac was a particularly appropriate remedy or therapeutic.<ref>Noted by Cantor 2001:174.</ref>

==History==

According to legends, the history of theriac begins with the king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] who experimented with poisons and antidotes on his prisoners. His numerous toxicity experiments eventually led him to declare that he had discovered an antidote for every venomous reptile and poisonous substance. He mixed all the effective antidotes into a single one, ''[[mithridatium]]'' or mithridate. Mithridate contained [[opium]], [[myrrh]], [[saffron]], [[ginger]], [[cinnamon]] and [[Castor oil plant|castor]], along with some forty other ingredients.<ref name="Hodgson_1">{{Harv|Hodgson|2001|p=18}}</ref> When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] defeated him, his medical notes fell into their hands and Roman ''medici'' began to use them. Emperor [[Nero]]'s physician [[Andromachus (physician)|Andromachus]] improved upon mithridatum by bringing the total number of ingredients to sixty four, including [[Viperidae|viper's flesh]],<ref name="Hodgson_1"/> a mashed decoction of which, first roasted then well aged, proved the most constant ingredient.<ref>Norman F. Cantor, ''In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It made''(New York: Harper) 2001: 174ff.</ref> Lise Manniche, however, links the origins of theriac to the ancient Egyptian [[kyphi]] recipe, which was also used medicinally.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manniche|first=Lise|title=Sacred Luxuries|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8014-3720-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCgVdm7UKhIC&lpg=PP1&ots=eHIATYCU02&dq=lise%20manniche%20sacred%20luxuries&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

Greek physician [[Galen]] devoted a whole book ''Theriaké'' to theriac. One of his patients, Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], took it on regular basis.

In 667, ambassadors from [[Rûm]] presented the [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in [[China]] with a theriac. The Chinese observed that it contained the [[gall]] of [[swine]], was dark red in colour and the foreigners seemed to respect it greatly. The Tang pharmacologist Su Kung noted that it had proved its usefulness against "the hundred ailments." Whether this panacea contained the traditional ingredients such as opium, myrrh and [[Cannabis|hemp]], is not known.<ref name="Schafer_1">{{Harv|Schafer|1985|p=184}}</ref>

In medieval London, the preparation arrived on galleys from the Mediterranean, under the watchful eye of the [[Worshipful Company of Grocers]]. Theriac, the most expensive of medicaments, was called ''Venice treacle'' by the English apothecaries. 

At the time of the Black Death in the mid 14th century, [[Gentile da Foligno]], who died of the plague in June 1348, recommended in his plague treatise that the theriac should have been aged at least a year. Children should not ingest it, he thought, but have it rubbed on them in a salve.<ref>Noted by Cantor 2001:175, who observes that Gentile also used [[gold]] and ground gemstones in medications and recommended amulets.</ref>

In 1669, the famous French [[apothecary]], [[Moyse Charas]], published the formula for theriac, seeking to break the monopoly held by the Venetians at that time on the medication, thereby opening up the transfer of medical information.<ref name="boulnois">{{cite book

==Traditional theriac==

The production of a proper theriac took months with all the collection and [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of herbs and other ingredients. It was supposed to be left to mature for years. As a result it was also expensive and hence available only for the rich.

Patients would use theriac for bites but also as a preventative against any kind of poisoning and eventually against just about anything. It was used in [[salve]]s and [[plaster]]s or just eaten in chunks.

According to the commentary on Exodus, Ki Thisa, the Ramban lists the ingredients of theriac as leaven, honey, flesh of wild beasts and reptiles, dried scorpion and viper.

By the time of the Renaissance, the making of theriac had become an official ceremony, especially in Italy. Pharmacists sold it as late as 1884.

==Theriaca Andromachi Senioris==
''Theriaca andromachi'' or Venice Treacle contained 64 ingredients. In addition to viper flesh and opium, it included [[cinnamon]], [[agaric]]s and [[gum arabic]]. The ingredients were pulverised and reduced to an [[electuary]] with honey.

The following ingredients for the theriac were taken from the ''Amsterdammer Apotheek'' (1683) and translated from the old Latin names into the Latin names now used where possible <ref>''Pharmacopaea Amstelredamensis'', (Amsterdam: Jan ten Hoorn over 't oude Heere Logement), 1683</ref>  Not all ingredients are known, and identifications and assignments below are tentative.
