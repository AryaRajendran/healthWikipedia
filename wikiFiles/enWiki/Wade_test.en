The '''Wade test''' is a neurological test performed by [[surgeon]]s and [[neurologist]]s, to determine whether a patient is left [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] hemisphere dominant or right cortical hemisphere dominant.

==Test==
Most individuals (about 95% of the time<ref name=james />) who are right handed are left cortical hemisphere dominant, while about 10% of individuals who are left handed, are right cortical hemisphere dominant. The dominance refers to the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] where often propositional language centers such as [[Broca's area]] located in [[pars opercularis]] and [[pars triangularis]] of the [[frontal lobe]] responsible for generation of speech, [[Wernicke's area]] located in [[superior temporal gyrus]], responsible for comprehension of speech, and other motor and [[somatosensory]] areas are located. The dominant hemisphere is therefore responsible for language, and comprehension of speech. 

;Description
The test involves injection of sodium amobarbital ([[Amytal]]),<ref name=james>{{cite book|title=Neuroanatomy (Board Review Series)|author=James D. Fix|edition=4|publisher=Wolter Kluwer Health: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|pages=304|year=2008 Baltimore|ISBN=978-0-7817-7245-7}}</ref> an [[anesthetic]] into the patient's [[common carotid artery|carotid artery]] on the suspected dominant side, and then evaluating patient for [[speech]] and [[language]] comprehension. Any form of [[aphasia]] (difficulty in speech) whether [[Expressive aphasia|non-fluent]], [[Receptive aphasia|fluent]], or [[conduction aphasia|conduction]] would indicate that the side into which Amytal was injected was in fact the dominant [[cerebral cortex]]. 

Since Wade test in essence, mimics a temporary [[lesion]] of the dominant cortex, other side effects such as [[astereognosis]], [[Gerstmann syndrome]], [[alexia (acquired dyslexia)|alexia]], [[agraphia]], tactile [[agnosia]] (bimanual astereognosis), [[ideomotor apraxia]], and [[ideational apraxia]] is possible.<ref name=james />

==Medical Use for Wade Test==
The test is used during neurosurgical and presurgical epilepsy evaluations to localize areas of language and memory that are important for normal functioning. Such a test can help determine if more presurgical tests are needed, whether a person is a suitable candidate for surgery, and the possible outcome or risk of a surgery at the area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Paolicchi|first=Juliann M|title=Is the Wada test still relevant?
