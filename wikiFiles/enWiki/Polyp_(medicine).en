A '''polyp''' is an abnormal growth of tissue projecting from a [[mucous membrane]]. If it is attached to the surface by a narrow elongated [[pedicle|stalk]], it is said to be ''[[pedunculated]]''.  If no stalk is present, it is said to be ''[[Sessility (medicine)|sessile]]''. Polyps are commonly found in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], [[stomach]], [[human nose|nose]], [[Paranasal sinus|sinus(es)]], [[urinary bladder]] and [[uterus]]. They may also occur elsewhere in the body where mucous membranes exist like the [[cervix]]&nbsp;<!--

==Colorectal polyp==
{{main|Colorectal polyp }}
Colon polyps are not commonly associated with symptoms. Occasionally [[Lower gastrointestinal bleeding|rectal bleeding]], and on rare occasions [[pain]], [[diarrhea]] or [[constipation]] may occur because of colon polyps. Colon polyps are a concern because of the potential for [[colon cancer]] being present microscopically and the risk of [[Benignity|benign]] colon polyps transforming over time into [[Malignancy|malignant]] ones. Since most polyps are [[Symptom#Types|asymptomatic]], they are usually discovered at the time of colon cancer screening. Common screening methods are [[Rectal examination|digital rectal examination]] (DRE), [[sigmoidoscopy]] (usually flexible sigmoidoscopy, using a flexible [[Endoscopy|endoscope]], but more rarely the older rigid sigmoidoscopy, using a rigid endoscope), [[lower gastrointestinal series]] (barium enema), [[colonoscopy]],<ref name="AGAfive">{{Citation |author1 =  American Gastroenterological Association |author1-link =  American Gastroenterological Association |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Gastroenterological Association]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AGA.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012}}</ref> and [[virtual colonoscopy]]. The polyps are routinely removed at the time of colonoscopy either with a polypectomy [[Snare device|snare]] (first description by P. Deyhle, Germany, 1970<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deyhle P |title=Results of endoscopic polypectomy in the gastrointestinal tract |journal=Endoscopy |issue=Suppl |pages=35–46 |year=1980 |pmid=7408789 }}</ref>) or with biopsy [[forceps]].  If an [[adenomatous]] polyp is found with [[sigmoidoscopy]] or if a polyp is found with any other [[Medical imaging|diagnostic modality]], the patient must undergo colonoscopy for removal of the polyp(s). Even though colon cancer is usually not found in polyps smaller than 2.5&nbsp;cm, all polyps found are removed since the removal of polyps reduces the future likelihood of developing colon cancer. When adenomatous polyps are removed, a repeat colonoscopy is usually performed in three to five years. 

Most colon polyps can be categorized as sporadic.

==Adenomatous polyps==
'''Adenomatous polyps''', or adenomas, are polyps that grow on the lining of the colon and which carry a high risk of [[cancer]]. The adenomatous polyp is considered [[pre-malignant]], i.e. likely to develop into colon cancer.<ref name="A1">{{cite web|url=http://www.gicare.com/endoscopy-center/adenomatous-polyps.aspx |title=Adenomatous Polyps| accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref> The other types of polyps that can occur in the colon are the hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps. They are unlikely to develop into colorectal cancer.

About 5% of people aged 60 will have at least one adenomatous polyp of 1&nbsp;cm diameter or greater.<ref name="B2">{{cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/colonpolyps.htm |title=Polyps in the colon (large bowel)| accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref> Multiple adenomatous polyps often result from familial polyposis coli or familial adenomatous polyposis, a condition that carries a very high risk of colon cancer.

===Types===
Adenomas constitute approximately 10% of polyps. Most polyps (approximately 90%) are small, usually less than 1&nbsp;cm in diameter, and have a small potential for malignancy. The remaining 10% of adenomas are larger than 1&nbsp;cm and approach a 10% chance of containing invasive cancer.<ref name="C3">{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/172674-overview |title=Colonic Polyps| accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref> 

There are three types of adenomatous polyp:
* Tubular adenomas are the most common of the adenomatous polyps; they may occur everywhere in the colon and they are the least likely colon polyps to develop into colon cancer;
* Tubulovillous
* Villous adenomas are commonly found in the rectal area and they are normally larger in size than the other two types of adenomas. They tend to be nonpedunculated, velvety, or cauliflowerlike in appearance and they are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality rates of all polyps. They can cause hypersecretory syndromes characterized by [[hypokalemia]] and profuse [[mucus|mucous]] discharge and can harbor [[carcinoma in situ]] or invasive carcinoma more frequently than other adenomas.

===Risks===
The risks of progression to colorectal cancer increases if the polyp is larger than 1&nbsp;cm and contains a higher percentage of villous component. Also, the shape of the polyps is related to the risk of progression into carcinoma. Polyps that are pedunculated (with a stalk) are usually less dangerous than sessile polyps (flat polyps). Sessile polyps have a shorter pathway for migration of invasive cells from the tumor into submucosal and more distant structures, and they are also more difficult to remove and to ascertain. Sessile polyps larger than 2&nbsp;cm usually contain villous features, have a higher malignant potential, and tend to recur following colonoscopic polypectomy.<ref name="D4">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssat.com/cgi-bin/polyps.cgi |title=Management of Colonic Polyps and Adenomas |accessdate=2010-04-13}}</ref>

Although polyps do not carry significant risk of [[colon cancer]], tubular adenomatous polyps may become cancerous when they grow larger. Larger tubular adenomatous polyps have an increased risk of malignancy when larger because then they develop more villous components and may become [[Sessility (medicine)|sessile]].

It is estimated that an individual whose parents have been diagnosed with an adenomatous polyp has a 50% greater chance to develop colon cancer than individuals with no [[family history]] of colonic polyps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/colon_polyps/page4.htm#9whatis| title=Colon Polyps (cont.)|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-25}}</ref> At this point, there is no method to establish the risks that patients with a family history of colon polyps have to develop these growths. Overall, nearly 6% of the population, regardless of the family history, is at risk to developing colon cancer.

===Screening===
Screening for colonic polyps as well as preventing them has become an important part of the management of the condition. Medical societies have established guidelines for colorectal screening in order to prevent adenomatous polyps and to minimize the chances of developing colon cancer. It is believed that some changes in the diet might be helpful in preventing polyps from occurring but there is no other way to prevent the polyps from developing into cancerous growths than by detecting and removing them.

According to the guidelines established by the [[American Cancer Society]], individuals who reach the age of 40 should perform an occult blood test yearly. Colon polyps as they grow can sometimes cause [[bleeding]] within the [[intestine]], which can be detected with the help of this test. Also, persons in their 50s are recommended to have flexible [[Sigmoidoscope|sigmoidoscopies]] performed once in 3 to 5 years to detect any abnormal growth which could be an adenomatous polyp. If adenomatous polyps are detected during this procedure, it is most likely that the patient will have to undergo a [[colonoscopy]]. Medical societies recommend colonscopies every 10 years starting at age 50 as a necessary screening practice for colon cancer.<ref name="AGAfive"/><ref name="coloscreen">{{cite PMID|12557158}}</ref> The screening provides an accurate image of the intestine and also allow the removal of the polyp, if found. Once an adenomatous polyp is identified during colonoscopy, there are several methods of removal including using a snare or a heating device.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adenomatouspolyp.com/| title=Adenomatous Polyps Symptoms and Prevention|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-25}}</ref> Colonoscopies are preferred over sigmoidoscopies because they allow the examination of the entire colon, a very important aspect considering that more than half of the colonic polyps occur in the upper colon which is not reached during sigmoidoscopies.

It has been statistically demonstrated that screening programs are effective in reducing the number of deaths caused by colon cancer due to adenomatous polyps. Yet their use is still controversial because of the complications that sometimes arise. However, most of the specialists agree that the benefits of colorectal screening overcome the risks. The risk of complications arising from colonoscopies is half the risk of that of developing colon cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibdcrohns.about.com/od/colonoscopy/p/colonoscopy.htm| title=Colonoscopy Risks|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-25}}</ref> As there is a small likelihood of recurrence, surveillance after polyp removal is recommended.

==Nasal polyps==
{{Main|Nasal polyp}}
Nasal polyps are polypoidal masses arising mainly from the mucous membranes of the nose and paranasal sinuses. They are overgrowths of the mucosa that frequently accompany allergic [[rhinitis]]. They are freely movable and nontender.
