A '''microsleep''' is an episode of [[sleep]] which may last for a fraction of a second or up to thirty seconds.<ref name=ICSD>[[International Classification of Sleep Disorders]] Diagnostic and Coding Manual, http://www.esst.org/adds/ICSD.pdf, page 343</ref> Often, it is the result of [[sleep deprivation]], mental [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], depression, [[sleep apnea]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[narcolepsy]], or [[idiopathic hypersomnia]]. For the sleep-deprived, microsleeping can occur at any time, typically without substantial warning.

Microsleeps (or microsleep episodes) become extremely dangerous when they occur in situations which demand constant alertness, such as [[sleep deprived driving|driving a motor vehicle]] or working with heavy machinery. People who experience microsleeps usually remain unaware of them, instead believing themselves to have been awake the whole time, or to have temporarily lost focus.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

There is little agreement on how best to identify microsleep episodes. Some experts define microsleep according to behavioral criteria (head nods, drooping eyelids, etc.),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzbri.org/research/publications/papers/0696.pdf |title=Losing the struggle to stay awake: divergent thalamic and cortical activity during microsleeps |accessdate=2013-03-20 |last=Poudel |first=G.R. |coauthors= Innes, C. R. H., Bones, P.J., Watts, R., Jones, R. D., |year=in press |format=PDF |work=Human Brain Mapping |doi=10.1002/hbm.22178}}</ref> while others rely on [[EEG]] markers. One study at the [[University of Iowa]] defined EEG-monitored microsleeps in driving simulation as "a 3–14 second episode during which 4–7 Hz (theta) activity replaced the waking 8–13 Hz (alpha) background rhythm."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://drivingassessment.uiowa.edu/DA2005/PDF/04_AmitPaul_LBoyleformat.pdf |title=Variability of driving performance during microsleeps |accessdate=2008-02-10 |last=Paul |first=Amit |coauthors=Linda Ng Boyle, Jon Tippin, Matthew Rizzo |year=2005 |format=PDF |work=Proceedings of the Third International Driving Symposium on Human Factors in Driver Assessment, Training and Vehicle Design}}</ref>

[[File:LKW Auffahrunfall 16122008 1.jpg|thumb|[[Traffic collision]], a possible consequence of microsleep]]
When experiencing microsleeps while driving an automobile, from the perspective of the driver, he or she drives a car, and then suddenly realizes that several seconds have passed by unnoticed. It is not obvious to the driver that he or she was asleep during those missing seconds, although this is in fact what happened. The sleeping driver is at very high risk for having an accident during a microsleep episode.<ref>http://www.sleepdex.org/microsleep.htm</ref>

Many accidents and catastrophes have resulted from microsleep episodes in these circumstances.<ref name="pmid17239659">{{cite journal |author=Blaivas AJ, Patel R, Hom D, Antigua K, Ashtyani H |title=Quantifying microsleep to help assess subjective sleepiness |journal=[[Sleep Med.]] |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=156–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17239659 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2006.06.011 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389-9457(06)00197-3}}</ref> For example, a microsleep episode is claimed to have been one factor contributing to the [[Waterfall train disaster]] in 2003; the driver had a heart attack and the guard who should have reacted to the train's increasing speed is said by his defender to have microslept, thus causing him to be held unaccountable.
