'''Stridor''' ([[Latin]] for "creaking or grating noise") is a high-pitched wheezing sound resulting from [[turbulent]] air flow in the upper airway. Stridor is a physical sign which is produced by narrowed or obstructed airway path. It can be inspiratory, expiratory or biphasic. Inspiratory stridor is common.<ref>{{DorlandsDict|seven/000101481|stridor}}</ref> It can be indicative of serious [[airway]] obstruction from severe conditions such as [[epiglottitis]], a foreign body lodged in the airway, or a laryngeal tumor. Stridor is indicative of a potential [[medical emergency]] and should always command attention.  Wherever possible, attempts should be made to immediately establish the cause of the stridor (e.g., foreign body, [[vocal cord]] [[edema]], tracheal compression by tumor, [[functional laryngeal dyskinesia]], etc.) That examination requires visualization of the airway by a team of medical experts equipped to control the airway.

A reduction in oxygen saturation is considered a late sign of airway obstruction, particularly in a child with healthy lungs and normal gas exchange.

==Treatments==
The first issue of clinical concern in the setting of stridor is whether or not [[tracheal intubation]] or [[tracheostomy]] is immediately necessary. Some patients will need immediate tracheal intubation.  If intubation can be delayed for a period, a number of other potential options can be considered, depending on the severity of the situation and other clinical details. These include:

* Expectant management with full monitoring, oxygen by face mask, and positioning the head on the bed for optimum conditions (e.g., 45 - 90 degrees).
* Use of [[nebulizer|nebulized]] [[racemic adrenaline]] [[epinephrine]] (0.5 to 0.75 ml of 2.25% racemic epinephrine added to 2.5 to 3 ml of normal saline) in cases where airway edema may be the cause of the stridor. (Nebulized [[cocaine]] in a dose not exceeding 3&nbsp;mg/kg may also be used, but not together with racemic adrenaline [because of the risk of ventricular arrhythmias].)
* Use of [[dexamethasone]] ([[Decadron]]) 4–8&nbsp;mg IV q 8 - 12 h in cases where airway edema may be the cause of the stridor; note that some time (in the range of hours) may be needed for dexamethasone to work fully.
* Use of inhaled [[Heliox]] (70% [[helium]], 30% [[oxygen]]); the effect is almost instantaneous. Helium, being a less dense gas than nitrogen, reduces turbulent flow through the airways. Always ensure an open airway.
In obese patients elevation of the panniculis has shown to relieve symptoms by 80%.

==Causes==
Stridor may occur as a result of:
* Foreign bodies (e.g., [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirated]] [[peanut]], aspirated food bolus);
* Tumor (e.g., laryngeal papillomatosis, [[squamous cell carcinoma]] of larynx, trachea or esophagus);
* Infections (e.g., [[epiglottitis]], [[retropharyngeal abscess]], [[croup]]);
* Subglottic [[stenosis]] (e.g., following prolonged intubation or congenital);
* Airway edema (e.g., following instrumentation of the airway, [[tracheal intubation]], drug side effect, [[allergic reaction]]);
* Subglottic [[hemangioma]] (rare);
* [[Vascular rings]] compressing the trachea;
* Many thyroiditis such as [[Riedel's thyroiditis]];
* Vocal cord palsy;
* [[Tracheomalacia]] or Tracheobronchomalacia (e.g., collapsed trachea).
* [[Congenital]] anomalies of the airway are present in 87% of all cases of stridor in infants and children.<ref name="pmid7436240">{{cite journal |author=Holinger LD |title=Etiology of stridor in the neonate, infant and child |journal=Ann.

==Diagnosis==
Stridor is usually diagnosed on the basis of history and physical examination, with a view to revealing the underlying problem or condition.  

Chest and neck [[x-rays]], [[bronchoscopy]], [[CT-scans]], and/or [[MRIs]] may reveal structural pathology. 

Flexible fiberoptic [[bronchoscopy]] can also be very helpful, especially in assessing vocal cord function or in looking for signs of compression or infection.
