This enzyme transfers phosphate to [[mannose]] residues on specific proteins, and serves as a marker for them to be targeted to [[lysosomes]] within the cell.  Without this marker, the proteins are instead excreted outside the cell -- the default pathway for proteins moving through the Golgi apparatus.  Lysosomes cannot function without these proteins, which function as catabolic enzymes for the normal breakdown of substances (e.g. oligosaccharides, lipids, and glycosaminoglycans)<ref>{{cite book|last=Bamshad|first=Lynn B.

As a result, a build up of these substances occurs within lysosomes because they cannot be degraded, resulting in the characteristic "I cells," or "inclusion cells."  These cells can be identified under the microscope.  In addition, the defective lysosomal enzymes normally found only within lysosomes are instead found in high concentrations in the blood. 

==Presentation==
ML II is a particularly severe form of ML that resembles one of the mucopolysaccharidoses called [[Hurler syndrome]].  Typically, by the age of 6 months, failure to thrive and developmental delays are obvious symptoms of this disorder.  Some physical signs, such as abnormal skeletal development, coarse facial features, and restricted [[joint]] movement, may be present at birth. Children with ML II usually have enlargement of certain organs, such as the liver ([[hepatomegaly]]) or spleen ([[splenomegaly]]), and sometimes even the [[heart valves]]. Affected children often have stiff claw-shaped hands and fail to grow and develop in the first months of life.  Delays in the development of their [[motor skills]] are usually more pronounced than delays in their [[cognitive]] (mental processing) skills. Children with ML II eventually develop a clouding on the [[cornea]] of their eyes and, because of their lack of growth, develop short-trunk [[dwarfism]] (underdeveloped trunk). These young patients are often plagued by recurrent respiratory tract infections, including [[pneumonia]], otitis media (middle ear infections), [[bronchitis]] and [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]. Children with ML II generally die before their seventh year of life, often as a result of [[congestive heart failure]] or recurrent respiratory tract infections.

==Pathophysiology==
I-cell disease is an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder caused by a deficiency of [[GlcNAc phosphotransferase]], which [[phosphorylate]]s [[mannose]] residues to [[mannose-6-phosphate]] on [[glycoprotein|N-linked glycoproteins]] in the [[Golgi apparatus]] within the cell. Without mannose-6-phosphate to target them to the [[lysosomes]], the enzymes are transported from the Golgi to the [[extracellular space]], resulting in large intracellular inclusions of molecules requiring lysosomal degradation in patients with the disease (hence the name of the disorder).<ref  name="lippincott's_3rd_biochem">{{cite book|title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry|last=Champe|first=Pamela|others= Richard A Harvey, Denise R Ferrier|edition=3rd|year=2004|isbn=0-7817-2265-9|page=167|publisher=Lippincott-Raven|location=Philadelphia, Pa.}}</ref> Hydrolases secreted into the blood stream cause little problem as they are deactivated in the neutral pH of the blood.

==Treatment==
There is no cure yet for I-Cell disease/Mucolipidosis II disease. Treatment is limited to controlling or reducing the symptoms that are associated with this disorder. Nutrition supplements, particularly iron and vitamin B12, are often recommended for individuals with I-Cell disease. Physical therapy to improve motor delays and speech therapy to improve language acquisition are treatment options. Surgery can remove the thin layer of corneal clouding to temporarily improve the complication. It is possible that bone marrow transplant may be helpful in delaying or correcting the neurological deterioration that occurs with I-Cell disease.[http://www.bmt.umn.edu/disease/Metabolic/home.html]
