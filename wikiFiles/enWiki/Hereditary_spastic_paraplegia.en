'''Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia''' (HSP), also called '''Familial Spastic Paraplegias''', [[French Settlement]] Disease, or '''Strumpell-Lorrain disease''', is a group of inherited diseases whose main feature is progressive stiffness and contraction ([[spasticity]]) in the lower limbs,<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |author=Fink JK |title=The hereditary spastic paraplegias: nine genes and counting |journal=Arch.

HSP is not a form of [[cerebral palsy]] even though it physically may appear and behave much the same as, for example, [[spastic diplegia]]. The origins of HSP are entirely separate phenomena from cerebral palsy. Despite this, some of the same anti-spasticity medications used in [[spastic cerebral palsy]] are sometimes used to try to treat HSP symptomatology. 

The condition sometimes also affects the optic nerve and retina of the eye, causes cataracts, [[ataxia]] (lack of muscle coordination), epilepsy, [[cognitive impairment]], peripheral [[neuropathy]], and [[deafness]].<ref>[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hereditary_spastic_paraplegia/hereditary_spastic_paraplegia.htm NINDS Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Information Page]</ref> HSP is caused by defects in the mechanisms that transport proteins and other substances through the cell. Long nerves are affected because they have to transport cellular material through long distances, and are particularly sensitive to defects of cellular transport.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMra0910494}}</ref>

Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia was first described in 1883 by [[Adolph Strümpell]], a German neurologist, and was later described more extensively in 1888 by Maurice Lorrain, a French physician.

==Neuropathology==
The major neuropathologic feature of HSP is axonal degeneration that is maximal in the terminal portions of the longest descending and ascending tracts. These include the crossed and uncrossed corticospinal tracts to the legs and [[fasciculus gracilis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Behan W, Maia M |title=Strümpell's familial spastic paraplegia: genetics and neuropathology |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=37 |pages=8–20 |year=1974 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.37.1.8 |pmid=4813430 |issue=1 |pmc=494557}}</ref> The [[spinocerebellar tract]] is involved to a lesser extent. Neuronal cell bodies of degenerating fibers are preserved and there is no evidence of primary [[demyelination]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harding AE |title=Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=13 |pages=333–336 |year=1993 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1041143 |pmid=8146482 |issue=4}}</ref> Loss of anterior spinal horn is observed in some cases. Dorsal root ganglia, posterior roots and peripheral nerves are normal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schwarz GA, Liu C-N |title=Hereditary (familial) spastic paraplegia. Further clinical and pathologic observations |journal=AMA Arch Neurol Psychiatry |volume=75 |pages=144–162 |year=1956 |pmid=13282534 |issue=2}}</ref>

==Classification==
Hereditary spastic paraplegias are classified based on the symptoms; on their mode of inheritance; on the patient’s age at onset; and, ultimately, on the [[gene]] associated with the condition.

===Based on symptoms===
[[Spasticity]] in the lower limbs alone is described as pure HSP. On the other hand, HSP is classified as complex or complicated when associated with other neurological signs, including [[ataxia]], [[mental retardation]], [[dementia]], extrapyramidal signs, visual dysfunction or epilepsy, or with extraneurological signs. Complicated forms are diagnosed as HSPs when pyramidal signs are the predominant neurological characteristic. This classification, however, is subjective and patients with complex HSPs are sometimes diagnosed as having cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation or [[leukodystrophy]].<ref name="Harding 1983">{{cite book |last = Harding |first = AE | title = Classification of the hereditary ataxias and paraplegias | publisher = Lancet | year = 1983 | location = New York}}</ref>

===Based on mode of inheritance===
HSP being a group of genetic disorders, they follow general [[heredity|inheritance]] rules and can be inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]], [[autosomal recessive]] or [[x-linked recessive]] manner. The mode of inheritance involved has a direct impact on the chances of inheriting the disorder.

===Based on patient's age at onset===
In the past, HSP also has been classified as type I or type II on the basis of the patient's age at the onset of symptoms, which influences the amount of [[spasticity]] versus weakness. Type I is characterized by age onset below 35 years, whereas Type II is characterized by onset over 35 years. In the type I cases, delay in walking is not infrequent and [[spasticity]] of the lower limbs is more marked than weakness. In the type II muscle weakness, urinary symptoms and sensory loss are more marked. Furthermore, type II form of HSP usually evolves more rapidly.<ref name="Harding AE 1981 871–883">{{cite journal |author=Harding AE |title=Hereditary "pure" spastic paraplegia: a clinical and genetic study of 22 families |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. |volume=44 | issue=10 |pages=871–883 |year=1981 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.44.10.871}}</ref>

===Based on associated gene===
The symptoms previously described are the results of a degeneration of the corticospinal tracts. The longest fibers, innervating the lower extremities, are the most affected. This explains why the spasticity and [[pyramidal signs]] are often limited to the lower limbs in patients. This neuronal degeneration is thought to be caused by mutations at specific genes. Genetic mapping has identified at least 52 different HSP [[Locus (genetics)|loci]], designated SPG (Spastic ParapleGia) 1 through 52 <ref> Schüle R, Schöls L. "Genetics of hereditary spastic paraplegias" ''Semin Neurol.'' 2011 Nov;31(5):484-93.PMID: 22266886 </ref> in order of their discovery. Different genetic types of HSP usually cannot be distinguished by clinical and neuroimaging parameters alone. This reflects both the clinical similarity between different types of HSP and the phenotypic variability within a given genetic type of HSP. Furthermore, there may be significant clinical variability within a given family in which all subjects have the same HSP gene mutation; between families with the same genetic type of HSP; and between families with different genetic types of HSP.<ref name="Fink JK 2003 1045–1049"/>

A recent research showed that antitubulin antibodies could precipitate spastin in vitro, hence indicating that spastin can bind to tubulin. More recently, another study showed that a spastin fusion protein colocalized with microtubules in Cos-7 and HeLa cells transfected with wild type and mutant SPG4 expression vectors. Findings that spastin may interact with microtubules support the hypothesis that disturbances in axonal [[cytoskeleton]] or transport underlie some forms of HSP.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Rainier S, Jones SM, Esposito C, Otterud B, Leppert M, Fink JK. |title= Analysis of microtubule-associated protein 1a gene in hereditary spastic paraplegia |journal=Neurology |volume=51 |pages=1509–1510 |year=1998 |pmid= 9818901 |issue= 5}}</ref>

| The function of NIPA1 is unknown. It is widely expressed in the [[central nervous system]]. The presence of nine alternating [[hydrophobic]]-[[hydrophilic]] domains suggests that NIPA1 might encode a [[transmembrane protein]]. This feature makes NIPA1 unique among HSP related proteins. The mutation on the NIPA1 gene appears to act through a dominant negative gain of function. This prediction is based on the fact that subjects who are missing one NIPA1 gene entirely do not develop HSP.<ref>{{cite journal |author= De Michele G, De Fusco M, Cavalcanti F, et al. |title= A new locus for autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia maps to chromosome 16q24.3 |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics. |volume=63 |pages=135–139 |year=1998 |doi= 10.1086/301930 |pmid= 9634528 |issue= 1 |pmc= 1377251}}</ref>

| Because paraplegin is a protein found on the [[mitochondria]], mutations in this protein cause mitochondrial malfunction in neurons, eventually leading to axonal degeneration. SPG7 knockout mice exhibit signs of HSP. Recent studies were conducted on [[homozygous]] SPG7/Paraplegin knockout mice.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms depend on the type of HSP inherited. The main feature of the disease is progressive [[spasticity]] in the lower limbs, due to [[pyramidal tract]] dysfunction. This also results in brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, muscle weakness, and variable bladder disturbances. Furthermore, among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking, decreased vibratory sense at the ankles, and [[paresthesia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= McAndrew CR, Harms P. |title= Paraesthesias during needle-through-needle combined spinal epidural versus single-shot spinal for elective caesarean section |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care. |volume=31 | issue=5 |pages=514–517 |year=2003 |pmid= 14601273}}</ref>
Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance, stubbing the toe or stumbling. Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age, from infancy to older than 60 years. If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses insidiously over many years. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs may eventually be required, although some people never require assistance devices.<ref name="Fink JK 2003 1045–1049">{{cite journal |author= Fink JK |title= The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias |journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=60 |pages=1045–1049 |year=2003 |doi= 10.1001/archneur.60.8.1045 |pmid= 12925358 |issue= 8}}</ref>
More specifically, patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement. Although [[jaw jerk]] may be brisk in older subjects, there is no [[speech disturbance]] or difficulty of swallowing. Upper extremity muscle tone and strength are normal. In the lower extremities, muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings, quadriceps and ankles. Weakness is most notable at the [[iliopsoas]], [[tibialis anterior]], and to a lesser extent, [[hamstring]] muscles.<ref name="Harding AE 1981 871–883"/>
In the complex form of the disorder, additional symptoms are present. These include: peripheral [[neuropathy]], [[amyotrophy]], [[ataxia]], [[mental retardation]], [[ichthyosis]], [[epilepsy]], optic [[neuropathy]], [[dementia]], [[deafness]], or problems with speech, swallowing or breathing.<ref name="Depienne C, Stevanin G, Brice A, Durr A 2007 674–680"/>

==Diagnosis==
Initial diagnosis of HSPs relies upon family history, the presence or absence of additional signs and the exclusion of other nongenetic causes of spasticity, the latter being particular important in sporadic cases.<ref name="Harding 1983"/>

Cerebral and spinal [[MRI]] is an important procedure performed in order to rule out other frequent neurological conditions, such as [[multiple sclerosis]], but also to detect associated abnormalities such as cerebellar or [[corpus callosum]] atrophy as well as [[white matter]] abnormalities. [[Differential diagnosis]] of HSP should also exclude [[spastic diplegia]] which presents with nearly identical day-to-day effects and even is treatable with similar medicines such as [[baclofen]] and [[orthopedic surgery]]; at times, these two conditions may look and feel so similar that the only ''perceived'' difference may be HSP's hereditary nature versus the explicitly non-hereditary nature of spastic diplegia (however, unlike spastic diplegia and other forms of [[spastic cerebral palsy]], HSP cannot be reliably treated with [[selective dorsal rhizotomy]]).

Ultimate confirmation of HSP diagnosis can only be provided by carrying out [[genetic test]]s targeted towards known genetic [[mutations]].

==Prognosis==
Although HSP is a progressive condition, the prognosis for individuals with HSP varies greatly. It primarily affects the legs although there can be some upperbody involvement in some individuals. Some cases are seriously disabling while others are less disabling and are compatible with a productive and full life. The majority of individuals with HSP have a normal [[life expectancy]].<ref name="Depienne C, Stevanin G, Brice A, Durr A 2007 674–680"/>

==Treatment==
No specific treatment is know that would prevent, slow, or reverse HSP. Available therapies mainly consist of symptomatic medical management and promoting physical and emotional well-being. Therapeutics offered to HSP patients include:
*[[Baclofen]] – a voluntary muscle relaxant to relax muscles and reduce tone
*[[Tizanidine]] – to treat nocturnal or intermittent [[spasm]]s
*[[Diazepam]] and [[Clonazepam]] – to decrease intensity of spasms
*[[Oxybutynin chloride]] – an involuntary muscle relaxant and spasmolytic agent, used to reduce spasticity of the bladder in patients with bladder control problems
*[[Tolterodine]] tartate – an involuntary muscle relaxant and spasmolytic agent, used to reduce spasticity of the bladder in patients with bladder control problems
*[[Botulinum toxin]] – to reduce muscle overactivity
*[[Antidepressants]] (such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) – for patients experiencing clinical depression
*[[Physical Therapy]] – to restore and maintain the ability to move; to reduce muscle tone; to maintain or improve range of motion and mobility; to increase strength and coordination; to prevent complications, such as frozen joints, contractures, or bedsores.

==Incidence and Prevalence==
Worldwide, the prevalence of all hereditary spastic paraplegias combined is estimated to be 2 to 6 in 100,000 people.<ref name="National Institute of Health 2008">{{Cite web |last = National Institute of Health |title = Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Information Page | year = 2008 | url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hereditary_spastic_paraplegia/hereditary_spastic_paraplegia.htm |accessdate = 2008-04-30}}</ref> A [[Norway|Norwegian]] study of more than 2.5 million people published in March 2009 has found an HSP prevalence rate of 7.4/100,000 of population – a higher rate, but in the same range as previous studies. No differences in rate relating to gender were found, and average age at onset was 24 years.<ref>Brain. 2009 Mar 31.
