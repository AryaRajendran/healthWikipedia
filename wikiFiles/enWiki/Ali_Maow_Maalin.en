'''Ali Maow Maalin''' (also '''Mao Moallim'''<ref name=bbc /> and '''Mao' Mo'allim'''<ref name=boston />) (born c. 1954) is a Somalian hospital cook and health worker from [[Merca]] who is the last person known to be infected with naturally occurring ''[[alastrim|Variola minor]]'' [[smallpox]] in the world. He was diagnosed with the disease in October 1977 and made a full recovery. Although he had many contacts, none of them developed the disease and an aggressive containment campaign was successful in preventing an outbreak. Smallpox was declared to have been eradicated globally by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) two years later. Maalin was subsequently involved in the successful [[poliomyelitis eradication]] campaign in Somalia.

==Smallpox eradication in Africa==

[[Smallpox]] is an infectious disease caused by two strains of [[virus]], ''Variola major'' and ''V. minor''. ''V. minor'' is the rarer of the two strains, and causes a much less severe disease (sometimes called "[[alastrim]]"), with a fatality rate of around 1%. No treatment is available, and the only protection is [[vaccination]]. The virus is usually transmitted by prolonged face-to-face contact with a person showing symptoms. The incubation period averages 12–14 days.<ref name=CDC>[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp CDC: Smallpox Factsheet: Smallpox Disease Overview] (accessed 15 February 2013)</ref> One of the most feared diseases of human history, smallpox was still causing an estimated 2 million deaths every year as late as 1967.<ref>Porter, ed., p. 33</ref><ref>Tucker, p. 3</ref>

The global effort to [[smallpox#Eradication|eradicate smallpox]] from [[endemic]] areas such as Africa began in 1959 with a mass vaccination campaign. This approach met with little success, and a more-effective targeted approach was developed in the late 1960s. This involved active surveillance by case hunting, combined with rapid containment of infection in areas reporting outbreaks by intensive vaccination.<ref name=Behbehani_p490>Behbehani, pp. 490–492</ref> The majority of African countries were free from smallpox by 1972. By the end of 1975, the virus had been eradicated worldwide except in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]], and their neighbour [[Kenya]].<ref name=Behbehani_p494>Behbehani, pp. 494, 496–497</ref><ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049694.htm ''MMWR'': Smallpox Surveillance – Worldwide] (accessed 15 February 2013)</ref>  The [[nomad]]ic people of the [[Ogaden]] Desert retained endemic smallpox with an unusually mild form of the disease, which facilitated persistence in the population.<ref name=Behbehani_p493>Behbehani, p. 493</ref> From 1975, [[World Health Organization|WHO]] efforts were concentrated on this region. Ethiopia saw its last case in August 1976 and Kenya in February 1977.<ref name=Behbehani_p494 /><ref name=Tucker_p115>Tucker, pp. 115–116</ref>

Somalia proved particularly challenging because much of its population of 3.5 million was nomadic. A mass vaccination campaign in the country in 1969 had failed because many nomadic people in the region had cultural objections to vaccination, and either refused or avoided it.<ref name=Behbehani_p497>Behbehani, p. 497</ref><ref>Tucker, pp. 113–114</ref> Elimination efforts relied on an intensive reporting system. A severe drought in 1975 exacerbated the difficulties by increasing movement across the border with Ethiopia, and frequent outbreaks continued.<ref name=Behbehani_p497 /> In March 1977, surveillance efforts found over 3000 cases in the south of the country.<ref name=Tucker_p115 /> The Somali government declared a state of emergency and successfully appealed to the [[United Nations]] for assistance. By June of that year, when the outbreak peaked, 3000 Somali health workers supervised by 23 international advisers were involved in the eradication efforts.<ref name=Tucker_p115 /><ref name=Behbehani_p497 /> Eradication work was hampered in July when the [[Ogaden War]] broke out, limiting access to the desert.<ref name=Tucker_p115 />

==Maalin's case==
[[File:Un-horn-of-africa-relief.png|right|300px|thumb|Map of the [[Horn of Africa]]; [[Merca]] (Marka) is immediately southwest of the capital, [[Mogadishu]].]]
Maalin worked as a cook at the hospital in the port-town of [[Merca]] in southern Somalia,<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /> as well as an occasional vaccinator for a WHO smallpox eradication team.<ref name=Tucker_p117 /> He had not been successfully vaccinated, even though smallpox vaccination was obligatory for hospital employees.<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Tucker_p117 /><ref name=Henderson /> According to [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] epidemiologist Jason Weisfeld, one of the people who led the later containment effort in Merca, Maalin had received the [[smallpox vaccine]] but it had failed to take, and he had not been protected.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/rxforsurvival/series/video/d_sma1_dis_smallpox2.html PBS: ''Rx for Survival'' series: ''The End of Smallpox: Part II - The Last Case''] (streaming video)</ref><ref name=Weisfeld>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vcDT9IzQDzgJ:globalhealthchronicles.org/smallpox/record/file/pid/emory:1dpk8/type/master+jason+weisfeld&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiAX1ybcb8OWG1B4frP86ZtvqIaGV43YVoKNEH5ozdryMhDc1Ff2R9tB6H72Gu7rOwsiUwJ53_p1CE74QTv7XNt51ietfP6_knVedn7a7_bNNVbxWxCJJL6LZLplaA23RQNRD3v&sig=AHIEtbR6ZUJZl0GBJ9nd5jJJhSBJPTD6cA CDC: Smallpox Eradication: Memories and Milestones (26 October 2007)] (accessed 15 February 2015)</ref> Other sources, however, state that he had not been vaccinated.<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Henderson /><ref name=Barrett>Barrett, ch. 2</ref> In an interview in 2007, Maalin said that he had not been vaccinated, explaining: "I was scared of being vaccinated then. It looked like the shot hurt."<ref name=boston />

In August 1977, an outbreak developed in a Somalian nomadic group of twenty families; eight children developed symptoms in August to October.<ref name=Tucker_p115 /> On 12 October 1977, two children with smallpox symptoms were discovered at an encampment near the small inland settlement of Kurtunawarey, around 90 km from Merca. Local officials drove the children to Merca, where there was a nearby [[isolation (health care)|isolation camp]].<ref name=Tucker_p115 /><ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Barrett /> Maalin, then aged 23, served as a guide to the party taking them in a closed [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Land Cruiser]] from the hospital where he worked either to the home of a surveillance supervisor or directly to the isolation camp. He is believed to have been infected during the journey, which lasted no more than 5–15 minutes.<ref name=Tucker_p115 /><ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Henderson /><ref name=Barrett /><ref name=Weisfeld /> One of the children, a six-year-old girl named Habiba Nur Ali, died two days later. She was the last person to die from naturally acquired smallpox.<ref name=Tucker_p115 /><ref name=Behbehani_p499 /> The outbreak among the nomadic group was successfully contained by WHO workers by 18 October, but – critically – investigators failed to identify Maalin as a contact.<ref name=Tucker_p115 /><ref name=Tucker_p117>Tucker, pp. 117–118</ref><ref name=Barrett />

On 22 October, Maalin fell ill with fever and headache, and received [[malaria]] treatment in hospital. After four days a rash appeared. Perhaps working on the assumption that he had been successfully vaccinated against smallpox,<ref name=Weisfeld /> Maalin was then believed to have [[chickenpox]] and was discharged from hospital.<ref name=Behbehani_p499>Behbehani, pp. 499–500</ref><ref name=Henderson /> Over the next few days, his symptoms developed to indicate smallpox as the cause. Not wishing to be put into isolation, Maalin failed to report himself. On 30 October, a male nurse colleague reported him, possibly for the reward of 200 Somali shillings (around $35), and Maalin was transferred to the isolation camp.<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Tucker_p117 / /><ref name=Barrett /> He was diagnosed with an infection of the ''Variola minor'' strain of smallpox, based on his symptoms and later confirmed by laboratory tests.<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /> The date of diagnosis is sometimes stated as 26 October 1977.<ref name=Behbehani_p497 /><ref name=Fenner>Fenner ''et al''., p. 1249</ref> Maalin did not experience complications, and subsequently recovered fully and was discharged in late November.<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Tucker_p117 /> 

[[Donald Henderson]], who directed the WHO eradication programme from 1967 until 1976,<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /> describes Maalin's case as "a classic one in depicting omissions and mistakes in program operations."<ref name=Henderson /> Maalin, described by Henderson as "a popular man,"<ref name=Henderson /> had been visited by many relations and friends during his illness before he entered isolation. While hospitalised with fever, he had walked freely around the hospital, interacting with multiple patients.<ref name=Tucker_p117 /><ref name=Henderson>[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2009/08/17/prsa0817.htm American Medical News: Smallpox – The Death of a Disease (book excerpt)] (accessed 14 February 2013)</ref>

==Containing the potential outbreak==
Multiple measures were used to contain the potential outbreak in the town of Merca. The response was coordinated by Weisfeld and Karl Markvart.<ref name=Weisfeld /> Maalin's contacts were all traced by the WHO eradication team. A total of 161 contacts were identified, 41 of whom had not been vaccinated.<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Barrett /><ref name=Weisfeld /> There were 91 people who had been in face-to-face contact with Maalin, 12 of whom were unvaccinated.<ref name=Tucker_p117 /><ref name=Henderson /> Some of his contacts lived up to 120 km outside the town.<ref name=Barrett /> All contacts were kept under surveillance for six weeks. His face-to-face contacts and their families were vaccinated, but none showed any sign of having been infected.<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Tucker_p117 /><ref name=Weisfeld /> Merca Hospital was closed to new patients, all its medical staff were vaccinated and existing patients were quarantined ''in situ''. The residents of the fifty houses neighbouring Maalin's lodgings were vaccinated, and vaccinations were later extended to the ward of the town in which Maalin lived. House-to-house searches throughout the entire town looked for cases. Police checkpoints on all exits to the town, including footpaths, were established to vaccinate anyone passing who had not been recently immunised.<ref name=Tucker_p117 /><ref name=Henderson /><ref name=Barrett /><ref name=Weisfeld /> A total of 54,777 people were vaccinated in the two weeks following Maalin's isolation.<ref name=Tucker_p117 /><ref name=Barrett /> The response later broadened, with monthly house-to-house searches across the region widening to a search throughout Somalia, completed in December 1977.<ref name=Henderson /> 

The containment efforts proved effective and, on 17 April 1978, WHO's [[Nairobi]] office sent a telegram stating: "Search complete. No cases discovered. Ali Maow Maalin is the world's last known smallpox case."<ref name=Tucker_p117 /> Although there have been subsequent cases of smallpox from laboratory contamination,<ref>Behbehani, pp. 501–503</ref> Maalin remains the last case of naturally acquired smallpox in the world.<ref name=Behbehani_p499 /><ref name=Tucker_p117 /><ref name=Henderson /><ref name=Fenner /> On 26 October 1979, two years after the day when Maalin's rash appeared, WHO declared that smallpox had been eradicated globally.<ref>Behbehani, p. 498</ref>

==Later life and involvement in polio eradication campaign==
Maalin remained in the Merca area, where he has been employed in a range of different roles.<ref name=Henderson /> In the mid-1990s, he was selling medicines in a nearby small town.<ref name=Weisfeld /> Maalin was among the 10,000 volunteers who participated in the effort to eradicate [[poliomyelitis]] from Somalia, which succeeded in 2008.<ref name=bbc /> He explains his motivation for volunteering: "Somalia was the last country with smallpox. I wanted to help ensure that we would not be the last place with polio too."<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7312603.stm BBC News: War-torn Somalia eradicates polio (25 March 2008)] (accessed 14 February 2013)</ref> Maalin worked for WHO as a local coordinator with responsibility for social mobilization, and spent several years travelling across Somalia, vaccinating children and educating communities.<ref name=boston>[http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/diseases/articles/2006/02/27/polio_a_fight_in_a_lawless_land/?page=full ''Boston Globe'': Polio: A fight in a lawless land (27 February 2006)] (accessed 15 February 2013)</ref><ref name=podcast>[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/multimedia/podcasts/2008/transcript_30/en/index.html WHO: Somalia is again polio-free (28 March 2008)] (accessed 15 February 2013)</ref> ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' describes him as one of the "most valuable" local coordinators for WHO.<ref name=boston /> He encouraged people to be vaccinated by sharing his experiences with smallpox: "Now when I meet parents who refuse to give their children the polio vaccine, I tell them my story. I tell them how important these vaccines are. I tell them not to do something foolish like me."<ref name=boston />
