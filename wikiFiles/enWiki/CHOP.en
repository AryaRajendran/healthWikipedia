{{Other uses|Chop (disambiguation)}}

'''CHOP''' is the acronym for a [[chemotherapy]] regimen used in the treatment of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]].  CHOP consists of:
* [[Cyclophosphamide|'''C'''yclophosphamide]], an alkylating agent which damages DNA by binding to it and causing cross-links
* [[Hydroxydaunorubicin|'''H'''ydroxydaunorubicin]] (also called doxorubicin or Adriamycin), an intercalating agent which damages DNA by inserting itself between DNA bases
* [[Oncovin|'''O'''ncovin]] ([[vincristine]]), which prevents cells from duplicating by binding to the protein tubulin
* [[Prednisone|'''P'''rednisone]] or [[prednisolone]], which are corticosteroids.

==Uses and indications==

Normal cells are more able than cancer cells to repair damage from chemotherapy drugs. 

This regimen can also be combined with the [[monoclonal antibody]] [[rituximab]] if the lymphoma is of [[B cell]] origin; this combination is called '''R-CHOP''' or '''CHOP-R'''. Typically, courses are administered at an interval of two or three weeks (CHOP-14 and CHOP-21 respectively). A [[Staging (pathology)|staging]] [[CT scan]] is generally performed after three cycles to assess whether the disease is responding to treatment.

In patients with a history of [[cardiovascular disease]], doxorubicin (which is [[cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxic]]) is often deemed to be too great a risk and is omitted from the regimen. The combination is then referred to as '''COP''' (cyclophosphamide, Oncovin, and prednisone or prednisolone) or '''CVP''' (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone or prednisolone).

==Side-effects and complications==
The combination is generally well tolerated. [[Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] may require [[antiemetic]]s (such as [[ondansetron]]), and [[hemorrhagic cystitis]] is prevented with administration of [[mesna]]. [[Alopecia]] (hair loss) is common.

[[Neutropenia]] generally develops in the second week. During this period, many clinicians recommend [[pegfilgrastim]] or prophylactic use of [[ciprofloxacin]]{{ref|Cullen}}. If a [[fever]] develops in the [[neutropenic]] period, urgent medical assessment is required for [[neutropenic sepsis]], as infections in patients with low [[neutrophil]] counts may progress rapidly.

[[Allopurinol]] is typically co-administered prophylactically to prevent [[hyperuricemia]] that results from [[tumor lysis syndrome]], the result of rapid death of tumor cells.

==History==
A pivotal study published in 1993 compared CHOP to several other chemotherapy regimens (e.g. [[m-BACOD]], [[ProMACE-CytaBOM]], [[MACOP-B]]) for advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.{{ref|SWOG}} CHOP emerged as the regimen with the least toxicity but similar efficacy.

However, in Germany in 2012, [[bendamustine]] has displaced [R-]CHOP to become the first line treatment of choice for [[indolent lymphoma]] (a less aggressive subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma).<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ASHHematology/36418 New Combo Replaces CHOP for Lymphoma.
