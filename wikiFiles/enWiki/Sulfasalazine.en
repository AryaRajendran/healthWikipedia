'''Sulfasalazine''' (brand name '''Azulfidine''' in the [[United States|U.S.]], '''Salazopyrin''' and '''Sulazine''' in [[Europe]] and [[Hong Kong]]) was developed in the 1950s<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics | title = Patient information: Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics) | accessdate = 2012-12-09 | date = May 2012 | publisher = [[UpToDate]]}}</ref> specifically to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. It was believed at the time that bacterial infections were the cause of rheumatoid arthritis. Sulfasalazine is a [[sulfa drug]], (a derivative of [[mesalazine]]) and is formed by combining [[sulfapyridine]] and [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] with an azo bond. It may be abbreviated '''SSZ'''. 

==Indications==
:''See also [[Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s for its role in [[rheumatoid arthritis]]''

Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. It is also indicated for use in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and used in other types of inflammatory arthritis (e.g. [[psoriatic arthritis]]) where it has a beneficial effect. It is often well tolerated compared to other [[DMARDS]]. 

In clinical trials for the treatment of chronic alcoholics, sulfasalazine has been found to reverse the scarring associated with cirrhosis of the liver.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Cells called myofibroblasts, which contribute to scar tissue in a diseased liver, also appear to secrete proteins that prevent the breakdown of the scar tissue. Sulfasalazine appears to retard this secretion.

A study at [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne|University of Newcastle]] found that the drug may also act to aid the healing of [[cirrhosis of the liver]].<ref name="urlBBC NEWS | Health | Drug may reverse liver disease">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5382172.stm |title= Drug 'may reverse liver disease' |format= |work= BBC News|accessdate= 2010-05-24| date=2006-09-26}}</ref><ref name="Inhibition of inhibitor of κB kinases stimulates hepatic stellate cell apoptosis and accelerated recovery from rat liver fibrosis">{{cite journal |author=Fiona Oakley, Muriel Meso, John P.

It is usually not given to children under 2 years of age.

The use of sulfasalazine in inflammatory bowel disease has declined due mainly to the fact that it yields the metabolite [[sulfapyridine]] which gives rise to side-effects such as [[agranulocytosis]] and [[hypospermia]]. However, the other metabolite of sulfasalazine, [[5-aminosalicylic acid]] (5-ASA) is attributed to the drug's therapeutic effect. Therefore, 5-ASA and other derivatives of 5-ASA, are now usually preferred and given alone (as [[mesalazine]]), despite their increased cost, due to their more favourable side-effect profile.

Sulfasalazine has also been used successfully to treat cases of idiopathic [[urticaria]] that do not respond to antihistamines.<ref name="pmid17043190">{{cite journal |author=McGirt LY, Vasagar K, Gober LM, Saini SS, Beck LA |title=Successful treatment of recalcitrant chronic idiopathic urticaria with sulfasalazine |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=10 |pages=1337–1342 |year=2006 |month=Oct |pmid=17043190 |doi= 10.1001/archderm.142.10.1337|url=}}</ref>

==Mode of action==
Sulfasalazine, and its metabolite 5-ASA, are poorly absorbed from the gut. Its main mode of action is therefore believed to be inside the intestine. 

===Bowel disease===
In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, it is thought to be an antinflammatory drug that is essentially providing topical relief inside the intestine. It does this via a number of mechanisms such as reducing the synthesis of inflammatory mediators known as [[eicosanoids]] and inflammatory [[cytokines]]. However, unlike [[glucocorticoids]] (another class of drug used in the treatment in [[inflammatory bowel disease]]), sulfasalazine is a mild [[immunosuppressant]].

===Arthritis===
When treatment for arthritis is successful, pain, joint swelling and stiffness will be reduced and this may slow down or stop the development of joint damage. The precise reasons why sulfasalazine are effective in various forms of arthritis is not clearly understood. 

Because sulfasalazine and its metabolite 5-ASA are poorly absorbed into the bloodstream, it is surprising that the drug is effective against symptoms outside of the intestine. One possible explanation is that, given that ulcerative colitis produces arthritic symptoms, the arthritic symptoms are actually a product of unrecognized ulcerative colitis,{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2013}} which is effectively treated with sulfazalazine.

The other metabolite, sulfapyridine, is absorbed into the blood, and is believed to be the source of the side-effects discussed below. It is possible that the sulfapyridine is responsible for some of the anti-arthritic effects of sulfasalazine.

==Side effects==
Sulfsalazine metabolizes to sulfapyridine. Serum levels should be monitored every three months, and more frequently at the outset. Serum levels above 50 μg/l are associated with side effects.
In rare cases, Sulfasalazine can cause severe [[depression (mood)|depression]] in young males. It can also cause temporary [[infertility]].<ref>http://www.medic8.com/medicines/Azulfidine.html</ref> Immune [[thrombocytopenia]] has been reported.<ref name="pmid17551063">{{cite journal |author=Cantarini L, Tinazzi I, Biasi D, Fioravanti A, Galeazzi M |title=Sulfasalazine-induced immune thrombocytopenia |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |volume=83 |issue=980 |pages=e1 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17551063 |pmc=2600053 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2006.055194 |url=}}</ref>
