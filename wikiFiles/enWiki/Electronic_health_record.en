An ''' electronic health record (EHR)''' is an evolving concept defined as a systematic collection of electronic health information about individual patients or populations.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gunter T.D., Terry N.P. | year = 2005 | title = The Emergence of National Electronic Health Record Architectures in the United States and Australia: Models, Costs, and Questions | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1550638 | journal = J Med Internet Res | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 1 }}</ref> It is a record in digital format that is theoretically capable of being shared across different health care settings.  In some cases this sharing can occur by way of network-connected enterprise-wide information systems and other information networks or exchanges. EHRs may include a range of data, including [[demographics]], medical history, medication and allergies, [[immunization]] status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal stats like age and weight, and billing information.

==Terminology==
The terms EHR, EPR (electronic patient record) and [[Electronic medical record|EMR (electronic medical record)]] are often used interchangeably, although differences between them can be defined. The EMR can, for example, be defined as the patient record created in hospitals and ambulatory environments, and which can serve as a data source for the EHR.<ref name="dbt.consultantlive.com">Habib JL. [http://dbt.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145628/1581538 EHRs, meaningful use, and a model EMR]. ''Drug Benefit Trends.'' May 2010;22(4):99-101.</ref><ref>[[Patrick Kierkegaard]] (2011) Electronic health record: Wiring Europe's healthcare, Computer Law & Security Review, Volume 27, Issue 5, September 2011, Pages 503-515, ISSN 0267-3649, 10.1016/j.clsr.2011.07.013. Retrieved Dec 15, 2011</ref> It is important to note that an EHR is generated and maintained within an institution, such as a hospital, integrated delivery network, clinic, or physician office, to give patients, physicians and other health care providers, employers, and payers or insurers access to a patient's medical records across facilities.<ref name="NIH">[http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/informatics/EHR.pdf Electronic Health Records Overview]</ref>

A [[personal health record]] (PHR) is, in modern parlance, generally defined as an EHR that the individual patient controls.

==Philosophical views of the EHR==
Within a meta-narrative [[systematic review]] of research in the field, Prof. Trish Greenhalgh and colleagues defined a number of different philosophical approaches to the EHR.<ref>Greenhalgh T, Potts HWW, Wong G, Bark P, Swinglehurst D (2009). Tensions and paradoxes in electronic patient record research: A systematic literature review using the meta-narrative method. Milbank Quarterly, 87(4), 729-88</ref> The health information systems literature has seen the EHR as a container holding information about the patient, and a tool for aggregating clinical data for secondary uses (billing, audit ''etc.''). However, other research traditions see the EHR as a contextualised artifact within a socio-technical system. For example, [[actor-network theory]] would see the EHR as an actant in a network (''e.g.''<ref>Berg, M. 1997. Of Forms, Containers, and the Electronic Medical Record: Some Tools for a Sociology of the Formal. Science, Technology, & Human Values 22(4):403–33</ref>), while research in [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) sees the EHR as a tool supporting particular work.

Several possible advantages to EHRs over paper records have been proposed, but there is debate about the degree to which these are achieved in practice (''e.g.''<ref>http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/jun16_4/c3111 Greenhalgh T, Stramer K, Bratan T, Byrne E, Russell J, Potts HWW (2010). Adoption and non-adoption of a shared electronic summary care record in England: A mixed-method case study. BMJ, 340, c3111</ref>).

==Implementation, end user and patient considerations==

===Quality===
Several studies call into question whether EHRs improve the quality of care.<ref>{{cite web | last=Gabriel| first=Barbara | year=2008 | url=http://www.physicianspractice.com/index/fuseaction/articles.details/articleID/1203/page/1.htm | title=Do EMRs Make You a Better Doctor? | publisher=Physicians Practice| accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref><ref>[http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/electronic-health-records-not-panacea-researchers-say Electronic health records not a panacea]</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Silverstein| first=Scot| year=2009 | url=http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/faculty/ssilverstein/cases/?loc=cases&sloc=2009 | title=2009 a pivotal year in healthcare IT| publisher=Drexel University |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref><ref>Greenhalgh T, Potts HWW, Wong G, Bark P, Swinglehurst D (2009).

EHR do help improve care coordination. Since anyone with that EHR can view the patients chart it cuts down on guessing histories, seeing multiple specialists, smoothing transitions between care settings, and better care in emergency situations <ref>http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/improved-care-coordination</ref>

===Costs===
The steep price of EHR and provider uncertainty regarding the value they will derive from adoption in the form of return on investment has a significant influence on EHR adoption.<ref name=autogenerated3>RWIF,GWUMC, and IHP Staff: "Health Information Technology in the United States: The Information Base for Progress", Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, George Washington University Medical Center, and Institute for Health Policy, 2006 [http://www.rwjf.org/files/publications/other/EHRReport0609.pdf], Retrieved February 17, 2008</ref> In a project initiated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information (ONC), surveyors found that hospital administrators and physicians who had adopted EHR noted that any gains in efficiency were offset by reduced productivity as the technology was implemented, as well as the need to increase information technology staff to maintain the system.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office concluded that the cost savings may occur only in large integrated institutions like Kaiser Permanente, and not in small physician offices. They challenged the Rand Corp. estimates of savings. "Office-based physicians in particular may see no benefit if they purchase such a product—and may even suffer financial harm. Even though the use of health IT could generate cost savings for the health system at large that might offset the EHR's cost, many physicians might not be able to reduce their office expenses or increase their revenue sufficiently to pay for it. For example. the use of health IT could reduce the number of duplicated diagnostic tests. However, that improvement in efficiency would be unlikely to increase the income of many physicians."<ref name=cbo2008>[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=9168 Evidence on the costs and benefits of health information technology.] Congressional Budget Office, May 2008.</ref> One CEO of an EHR company has argued if a physician performs tests in the office, it might reduce his or her income.<ref>Shahid Shah.

Doubts have been raised about cost saving from EHRs by researchers at [[Harvard University]], the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Stanford University]], and others.<ref>David U.

===Software quality and usability deficiencies===
The [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]] (HIMSS), a very large U.S. healthcare IT industry trade group, observed that EHR adoption rates "have been slower than expected in the United States, especially in comparison to other industry sectors and other developed countries. A key reason, aside from initial costs and lost productivity during EMR implementation, is lack of efficiency and usability of EMRs currently available."<ref>Defining and Testing EMR Usability. ''Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), June 2009''.[http://www.himss.org/content/files/HIMSS_DefiningandTestingEMRUsability.pdf]</ref> The U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] of the [[Department of Commerce]] studied usability in 2011 and lists a number of specific issues that have been reported by health care workers.<ref>NISTIR 7804: Technical Evaluation, Testing and Validation of the Usability of Electronic Health Records, p. 9-10. ''National Institute of Standards and Technology, Sept. 2011''.[http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/usability/upload/Draft_EUP_09_28_11.pdf]</ref> The U.S. military's EHR, [[Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application|AHLTA]], was reported to have significant usability issues.<ref>[http://www.usmedicine.com/articles/electronic-records-system-unreliable-difficult-to-use-service-officials-tell-congress.html ''U.S. Medicine - The Voice of Federal Medicine, May 2009.'']</ref>

However, physicians are embracing mobile technologies such as smartphones and tablets at a rapid pace. According to a 2012 survey by ''Physicians Practice'', 62.6 percent of respondents (1,369 physicians, practice managers, and other healthcare providers) say they use mobile devices in the performance of their job. Mobile devices are increasingly able to synch up with electronic health record systems thus allowing physicians to access patient records from remote locations. Most devices are extensions of desk-top EHR systems, using a variety of software to communicate and access files remotely. The advantages of instant access to patient records at any time and any place are clear, but bring a host of security concerns. As mobile systems become more prevalent, practices will need comprehensive policies that govern security measures and patient privacy regulations.<ref>[http://www.physicianspractice.com/mobile-health/content/article/1462168/2087697 "EHRs Go Mobile"] Marisa Torrieri, Physicians Practice, July/August 2012.</ref>

===Unintended consequences===
Per empirical research in [[social informatics]], [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) use can lead to both intended and unintended consequences.<ref>Kling, Rosenbaum, Sawyer, Indiana University. ''Understanding And Communicating Social Informatics: A Framework For Studying And Teaching The Human Contexts Of Information And Communication Technologies, pg. 23.''

A 2008 '''Sentinel Event Alert''' from the U.S. [[Joint Commission]], the organization that accredits American hospitals to provide healthcare services, states that ''"As health information technology (HIT) and 'converging technologies'—the interrelationship between medical devices and HIT—are increasingly adopted by health care organizations, users must be mindful of the safety risks and preventable adverse events that these implementations can create or perpetuate. Technology-related adverse events can be associated with all components of a comprehensive technology system and may involve errors of either commission or omission. These unintended adverse events typically stem from human-machine interfaces or organization/system design."''<ref>''Safely implementing health information and converging technologies'', The Joint Commission, Issue 42, December 11, 2008 [http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/18/SEA_42.PDF]</ref> The Joint Commission cites as an example the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] MEDMARX database<ref>[https://www.medmarx.com/docs/about.pdf ''MEDMARX Adverse Drug Event Reporting database'']</ref> where of 176,409 medication error records for 2006, approximately 25 percent (43,372) involved some aspect of computer technology as at least one cause of the error.

The [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the UK reports specific examples of potential and actual EHR-caused unintended consequences in their 2009 document on the management of clinical risk relating to the deployment and use of health software.<ref>''Health informatics - Guidance on the management of clinical risk relating to the deployment and use of health software (formerly ISO/TR 29322:2008(E)).

In a Feb. 2010 U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) memorandum, FDA notes EHR unintended consequences include EHR-related medical errors due to (1) errors of commission (EOC), (2) errors of omission or transmission (EOT), (3) errors in data analysis (EDA), and (4) incompatibility between multi-vendor software applications or systems (ISMA) and cites examples. In the memo FDA also notes the "absence of mandatory reporting enforcement of H-IT safety issues limits the numbers of medical device reports (MDRs) and impedes a more comprehensive understanding of the actual problems and implications."<ref>FDA memo. ''H-IT Safety Issues'', table 4, page 3, Appendix B, p. 7-8 (with examples), and p. 5, summary.

===Privacy and confidentiality===
In the United States in 2011 there were 380 major data breaches involving 500 or more patients' records listed on the website kept by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) Office for Civil Rights.<ref>http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/breachtool.html</ref> So far, from the first wall postings in September 2009 through the latest on December 8, 2012, there have been 18,059,831 "individuals affected," and even that massive number is an undercount of the breach problem. The civil rights office has not released the records of tens of thousands of breaches it has received under a federal reporting mandate on breaches affecting fewer than 500 patients per incident.<ref>http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20111222/blogs02/312229963</ref>

==Governance, privacy and legal issues==

===Privacy concerns===
In the United States, Great Britain, and Germany, the concept of a national centralized server model of healthcare data has been poorly received. Issues of privacy and security in such a model have been of concern.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/3343/opposition_calls_for_rethink_on_data_storage|title=Opposition calls for rethink on data storage|publisher=e-Health Insider (UK)|month=December | year=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-health-insider.com/news/3384/german_doctors_say_no_to_centrally_stored_patient_records|title=German doctors say no to centrally stored patient records|publisher=e-Health Insider (UK)|month=January | year=2008}}</ref>

Privacy concerns in healthcare apply to both paper and electronic records. According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', roughly 150 people (from doctors and nurses to technicians and billing clerks) have access to at least part of a patient's records during a hospitalization, and 600,000 payers, providers and other entities that handle providers' billing data have some access also.<ref>{{cite news | last = Health & Medicine | title = At risk of exposure: In the push for electronic medical records, concern is growing about how well privacy can be safeguarded. | publisher = Los Angeles Times | date = 2006-06-26 | url = http://www.latimes.com/features/health/medicine/la-he-privacy26jun26,1,3180537.column?ctrack=1&cset=true |accessdate = 2006-08-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060813005017/http://www.latimes.com/features/health/medicine/la-he-privacy26jun26,1,3180537.column?ctrack=1&cset=true <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-08-13}}</ref> Recent revelations of "secure" data breaches at centralized data repositories, in banking and other financial institutions, in the retail industry, and from [[government database]]s, have caused concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location.<ref>CNN.com (May 23, 2006): [http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/22/vets.data/index.html FBI seeks stolen personal data on 26 million vets] Retrieved July 30, 2006</ref> Records that are exchanged over the Internet are subject to the same security concerns as any other type of data transaction over the Internet.

The  [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)]] was passed in the US in 1996 to establish rules for access, authentications, storage and auditing, and transmittal of electronic medical records. This standard made restrictions for electronic records more stringent than those for paper records. However, there are concerns as to the adequacy of these standards.<ref>{{cite web

Threats to health care information can be categorized under three headings:
* Human threats, such as employees or hackers
* Natural and environmental threats, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and fires.
* Technology failures, such as a system crashing

These threats can either be internal, external, intentional and unintentional. Therefore, one will find health information systems professionals having these particular threats in mind when discussing ways to protect the health information of patients.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has developed a framework to mitigate the harm of these threats that is comprehensive but not so specific as to limit the options of healthcare professionals who may have access to different technology.<ref>Wager, K., Lee, F., & Glaser, J. Health care information systems: A practical approach for health care management (2nd ed.)Jossey-Bass,pages 253-254, 2009</ref>

In the [[European Union]] (EU), several Directives of the European Parliament and of the Council protect the processing and free movement of personal data, including for purposes of health care.<ref>European Parliament and Council (24 October 1995): [http://www.dataprivacy.ie/viewdoc.asp?m=&fn=/documents/LEGAL/6aii.htm EU Directive 95/46/EC - The Data Protection Directive] Retrieved July 30, 2006</ref>

[[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] (PIPEDA) was given Royal Assent in Canada on April 13, 2000 to establish rules on the use, disclosure and collection of personal information. The personal information includes both non-digital and electronic form. In 2002, PIPEDA extended to the health sector in Stage 2 of the law's implementation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act - Implementation Schedule|publisher=''Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada''|date=April 1, 2004|accessdate=February 12, 2008|url=http://www.privcom.gc.ca/legislation/02_06_02a_e.asp}}</ref> There are four provinces where this law does not apply because its privacy law was considered similar to PIPEDA: Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.

One major issue that has risen on the privacy of the US network for electronic health records is the strategy to secure the privacy of patients. Former US president Bush called for the creation of networks, but federal investigators report that there is no clear strategy to protect the privacy of patients as the promotions of the electronic medical records expands throughout the United States. In 2007, the Government Accountability Office reports that there is a "jumble of studies and vague policy statements but no overall strategy to ensure that privacy protections would be built into computer networks linking insurers, doctors, hospitals and other health care providers."<ref name=autogenerated1>Pear, Robert. "Warnings Over Privacy of U.S. Health Network." New York Times, February 18, 2007.</ref>

The privacy threat posed by the interoperability of a national network is a key concern. One of the most vocal critics of EMRs, New York University Professor Jacob M. Appel, has claimed that the number of people who will need to have access to such a truly interoperable national system, which he estimates to be 12 million, will inevitable lead to breaches of privacy on a massive scale. Appel has written that while "hospitals keep careful tabs on who accesses the charts of VIP patients," they are powerless to act against "a meddlesome pharmacist in Alaska" who "looks up the urine toxicology on his daughter's fiance in Florida, to check if the fellow has a cocaine habit."<ref>JM Appel. Why shared medical database is wrong prescription. ''Orlando Sentinel'', December 30, 2008. http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/opinion/views/orl-opappel3008dec30,0,4065787.story</ref> This is a significant barrier for the adoption of an EHR. Accountability among all the parties that are involved in the processing of electronic transactions including the patient, physician office staff, and insurance companies, is the key to successful advancement of the EHR in the US Supporters of EHRs have argued that there needs to be a fundamental shift in "attitudes, awareness, habits, and capabilities in the areas of privacy and security" of individual's health records if adoption of an EHR is to occur.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite journal |author=Nulan C |title=HIPAA--a real world perspective |journal=Radiol Manage |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=29–37; quiz 38–40 |year=2001 |pmid=11302064 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

According to the ''Wall Street Journal'', the DHHS takes no action on complaints under HIPAA, and medical records are disclosed under court orders in legal actions such as claims arising from automobile accidents. HIPAA has special restrictions on psychotherapy records, but psychotherapy records can also be disclosed without the client's knowledge or permission, according to the ''Journal''. For example, Patricia Galvin, a lawyer in San Francisco, saw a psychologist at Stanford Hospital & Clinics after her fiance committed suicide. Her therapist had assured her that her records would be confidential. But after she applied for disability benefits, Stanford gave the insurer her therapy notes, and the insurer denied her benefits based on what Galvin claims was a misinterpretation of the notes.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article_print/SB116709136139859229.html Theo Francis, Spread of records stirs fears of privacy erosion, The Wall Street Journal, December 28, 2006] [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06362/749444-114.stm]</ref>

Within the private sector, many companies are moving forward in the development, establishment and implementation of medical record banks and health information exchange.
By law, companies are required to follow all HIPAA standards and adopt the same information-handling practices that have been in effect for the federal government for years. This includes two ideas, standardized formatting of data electronically exchanged and federalization of security and privacy practices among the private sector.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
Private companies have promised to have "stringent privacy policies and procedures." If protection and security are not part of the systems developed, people will not trust the technology nor will they participate in it.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===Legal issues===

====Liability====
Legal liability in all aspects of healthcare was an increasing problem in the 1990s and 2000s. The surge in the per capita number of attorneys<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newsbatch.com/tort-lawyerinc.html|title=Lawyers Per 100,000 Population 1980-2003|publisher=Congressional Budget Office| accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> and changes in the [[tort]] system caused an increase in the cost of every aspect of healthcare, and healthcare technology was no exception.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newsbatch.com/tort.htm|title=Tort reform|publisher=News Batch|date=2006-05}}</ref>

Failure or damages caused during installation or utilization of an EHR system has been feared as a threat in lawsuits.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.healthimaging.com/content/view/5885/89/|title=Bigger focus on compliance needed in EMR marketplace|publisher=Health Imaging News|date=2007-02-05}}</ref> Similarly, it's important to recognize that the implementation of electronic health records carries with it significant legal risks.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-kerschberg/how-electronic-health-rec_b_806793.html|title=Ben Kerschberg, Electronic Health Records Dramatically Increase Corporate Risk|publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2010-01-10}}</ref>

This liability concern was of special concern for small EHR system makers. Some smaller companies may be forced to abandon markets based on the regional liability climate.<ref>[http://docs.mirrormed.org/index.php/Medical_Manager_History Medical Manager History]</ref>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=October 2011}} Larger EHR providers (or government-sponsored providers of EHRs) are better able to withstand legal assaults.

While there is no argument that electronic documentation of patient visits and data brings improved patient care, there is increasing concern that such documentation could open physicians to an increased incidence of malpractice suits. Disabling physician alerts, selecting from dropdown menus, and the use of templates can encourage physicians to skip a complete review of past patient history and medications, and thus miss important data.

Another potential problem is electronic time stamps. Many physicians are unaware that EHR systems produce an electronic time stamp every time the patient record is updated. If a malpractice claim goes to court, through the process of discovery, the prosecution can request a detailed record of all entries made in a patient's electronic record. Waiting to chart patient notes until the end of the day and making addendums to records well after the patient visit can be problematic, in that this practice could result in less than accurate patient data or indicate possible intent to illegally alter the patient's record.<ref>[http://www.physicianspractice.com/risk-management/content/article/1462168/2042414 "Can Technology Get You Sued?"] Shelly K.

In some communities, hospitals attempt to standardize EHR systems by providing discounted versions of the hospital's software to local healthcare providers. A challenge to this practice has been raised as being a violation of Stark rules that prohibit hospitals from preferentially assisting community healthcare providers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Laura Dunlop|date=2007-04-06|title=Electronic Health Records: Interoperability Challenges and Patient's Right for Privacy|publisher=Shidler Journal of Computer and Technology 3:16|url=http://www.lctjournal.washington.edu/Vol3/a016Dunlop.html}}</ref> In 2006, however, exceptions to the Stark rule were enacted to allow hospitals to furnish software and training to community providers, mostly removing this legal obstacle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gklaw.com/publication.cfm?publication_id=496|title=Newly Issued Final Rules under Stark and Anti-kickback Laws Permit Furnishing of [[Electronic prescribing|Electronic Prescribing]] and Electronic Health Records Technology|publisher=GKLaw|month=August | year=2006}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=October 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssd.com/publications/pub_detail.aspx?pubid=9675|title=New Stark Law Exceptions and Anti-Kickback Safe Harbors For Electronic Prescribing and Electronic Health Records|publisher=SSDlaw|month=August | year=2006}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=October 2011}}

====Legal interoperability====
In cross-border use cases of EHR implementations, the additional issue of legal interoperability arises. Different countries may have diverging legal requirements for the content or usage of electronic health records, which can require radical changes of the technical makeup of the EHR implementation in question. (especially when fundamental legal incompatibilities are involved) Exploring these issues is therefore often necessary when implementing cross-border EHR solutions.<ref>European Patient Smart Open Services Work Plan: [http://www.epsos.eu/about-epsos/work-plan-new.html#c501 epSOS: Legal and Regulatory Issues] Retrieved May 4, 2008</ref>

===Regulatory compliance===

* [[HIPAA]]
* [[Health Level 7]]

==Medical Data Breach==
The Security Rule, according to Health and Human Services (HHS), establishes a security framework for small practices as well as large institutions. All covered entities must have a written security plan. The HHS identifies three components as necessary for the security plan:
administrative safeguards, physical safeguards, and technical safeguards.

However, medical and healthcare providers have experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006-2012.<ref>[https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breach/new Privacy Rights Clearinghouse's Chronology of Data Security Breaches involving Medical Information]</ref>

The majority of the counties in Europe have made a strategy for the development and implementation of the Electronic Health Record Systems. This would mean greater access to health records by numerous stakeholders, even from countries with lower levels of privacy protection. The forthcoming implementation of the Cross Border Health Directive and the EU Commission's plans to centralize all health records are of prime concern to the EU public who believe that the health care organizations and governments cannot be trusted to manage their data electronically and expose them to more threats.

The idea of a centralized electronic health record system has been poorly received by the public who are wary that the governments may extend the use of the system beyond its purpose. There is also the risk for privacy breaches that could allow sensitive health care information to fall into the wrong hands. Some countries have enacted laws requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information as it is shared electronically and to give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications.<ref name="sciencedirect.com">[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364912000209 Kierkegaard, P. (2012) Medical data breaches: Notification delayed is notification denied, Computer Law & Security Report , 28 (2), p.163–183.]</ref>

The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) requires safeguards to limit the number of people who have access to personal information. However, given the number of people who may have access to your information as part of the operations and business of the health care provider or plan, there is no realistic way to estimate the number of people who may come across your records.<ref>[https://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs8a-hipaa.htm HIPAA Basics: Medical Privacy in the Electronic Age from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse www.privacyrights.org]</ref>

Additionally, law enforcement access is authorized under HIPAA. In some cases, medical information may be disclosed without a warrant or court order.

===Breach notification===
The purpose of a personal data breach notification is to protect individuals so that they can take all the necessary actions to limit the undesirable effects of the breach and to motivate the organization to improve the security of the infrastructure to protect the confidentiality of the data. The US law requires the entities to inform the individuals in the event of breach while the EU Directive currently requires breach notification only when the breach is likely to adversely affect the privacy of the individual. Personal health data is valuable to individuals and is therefore difficult to make an assessment whether the breach will cause reputational or financial harm or cause adverse effects on one's privacy.

The Security Rule that was adopted in 2005 did not require breach notification. However, notice might be required by state laws that apply to a variety of industries, including health care providers. In California, a law has been in place since 2003 requiring that a HIPAA covered organization's breach could have triggered a notice even though notice was not required by the HIPAA Security Rule.  Since January 1, 2009, California residents are required to receive notice of a health information breach.

Federal law and regulations now provide rights to notice of a breach of health information. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to jointly study and report on privacy and data security of personal health information. HITECH also requires the agencies to issue breach notification rules that apply to HIPAA covered entities and Web-based vendors that store health information electronically.  The FTC has adopted rules regarding breach notification for internet-based vendors.<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-08-24/pdf/E9-20169.pdf DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Breach Notification for Unsecured Protected Health Information]</ref>

The Breach notification law in the EU provides better privacy safeguards with fewer exemptions, unlike the US law which exempts unintentional acquisition, access, or use of protected health information and inadvertent disclosure under a good faith belief.<ref name="sciencedirect.com"/>

==Technical issues==

===Standards===
* [[ANSI X12]] ([[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]) - transaction protocols used for transmitting patient data. Popular in the United States for transmission of [[invoice|billing]] data.
* [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]]'s TC/251 provides EHR standards in Europe including:
** [[EN 13606]], communication standards for EHR information
** [[CONTSYS]] (EN 13940), supports continuity of care record standardization.
** [[HISA]] (EN 12967), a services standard for inter-system communication in a clinical information environment.
* [[Continuity of Care Record]] - ASTM International Continuity of Care Record standard
* [[DICOM]] - an international communications protocol standard for representing and transmitting radiology (and other) image-based data, sponsored by [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association|NEMA]] (National Electrical Manufacturers Association)
* [[HL7]] - a standardized messaging and text communications protocol between hospital and [[physician]] record systems, and between practice management systems
* [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] - [[ISO TC 215]] provides international technical specifications for EHRs. ISO 18308 describes EHR architectures

The U.S. federal government has issued new rules of electronic health records.<ref name="Pear">{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/health/policy/14health.html?_r=1&hpw | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Issues Rules on Electronic Health Records | first=Robert | last=Pear | date=July 13, 2010}}</ref>

====Open Specifications====
* [[openEHR]]: an open community developed specification for a shared health record with web-based content developed online by experts. Strong multilingual capability.
* [[Virtual Medical Record]]: HL7's proposed model for interfacing with clinical decision support systems.
* SMART (Subsitutable Medical Apps, reusable technologies): an open platform specification to provide a standard base for healthcare applications.<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.smartplatforms.org/about-2/|work=[http://www.smartplatforms.org/ SMART Platforms]|accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref>

====Customization====
Each healthcare environment functions differently, often in significant ways. It is difficult to create a "one-size-fits-all" EHR system.

An ideal EHR system will have record standardization but interfaces that can be customized to each provider environment. Modularity in an EHR system facilitates this. Many EHR companies employ vendors to provide customization.

This customization can often be done so that a physician's input interface closely mimics previously utilized paper forms.<ref>Clayton L. Reynolds MD, FACP, FACPE (March 2006): [http://www.infor-med.com/downloads/why_praxis_downloads/Charting_Bass_Ackward.pdf Paper on Concept Processing] Retrieved July 27, 2006</ref>

At the same time they reported negative effects in communication, increased overtime, and missing records when a non-customized EMR system was utilized.<ref>Maekawa Y, Majima Y.; "Issues to be improved after introduction of a non-customized Electronic Medical Record system (EMR) in a Private General Hospital and efforts toward improvement"; Studies in Health Technology and Informatics 2006</ref> Customizing the software when it is released yields the highest benefits because it is adapted for the users and tailored to workflows specific to the institution.<ref>Tüttelmann F, Luetjens CM, Nieschlag E.; "Optimising workflow in andrology: a new electronic patient record and database"; Asian Journal of Andrology March 2006</ref>

Customization can have its disadvantages. There is, of course, higher costs involved to implementation of a customized system initially. More time must be spent by both the implementation team and the healthcare provider to understand the workflow needs.

Development and maintenance of these interfaces and customizations can also lead to higher software implementation and maintenance costs.<ref>The Digital Office, September 2007, vol 2, no.9. HIMSS</ref>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=October 2011}}<ref>Gina Rollins."The Perils of Customization." Journal of AHIMA 77, no.6 (2006):24-28.</ref>{{Verify credibility|failed=y|date=October 2011}}

===Long-term preservation and storage of records===
An important consideration in the process of developing electronic health records is to plan for the long-term preservation and storage of these records. The field will need to come to consensus on the length of time to store EHRs, methods to ensure the future accessibility and compatibility of archived data with yet-to-be developed retrieval systems, and how to ensure the physical and virtual security of the archives{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

Additionally, considerations about long-term storage of electronic health records are complicated by the possibility that the records might one day be used longitudinally and integrated across sites of care. Records have the potential to be created, used, edited, and viewed by multiple independent entities. These entities include, but are not limited to, primary care physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, and patients. Mandl et al. have noted that "choices about the structure and ownership of these records will have profound impact on the accessibility and privacy of patient information."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mandl KD, Szolovits P, Kohane IS |title=Public standards and patients' control: how to keep electronic medical records accessible but private |journal=BMJ |volume=322 |issue=7281 |pages=283–7 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11157533 |pmc=1119527 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.322.7281.283|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11157533}}</ref>

The required length of storage of an individual electronic health record will depend on national and state regulations, which are subject to change over time. Ruotsalainen and Manning have found that the typical preservation time of patient data varies between 20 and 100 years. In one example of how an EHR archive might function, their research "describes a co-operative trusted notary archive (TNA) which receives health data from different EHR-systems, stores data together with associated meta-information for long periods and distributes EHR-data objects. TNA can store objects in XML-format and prove the integrity of stored data with the help of event records, timestamps and archive e-signatures."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ruotsalainen P, Manning B |title=A notary archive model for secure preservation and distribution of electrically signed patient documents |journal=Int J Med Inform |volume=76 |issue=5–6 |pages=449–53 |year=2007 |pmid=17118701 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2006.09.011 |url=}}</ref>

In addition to the TNA archive described by Ruotsalainen and Manning, other combinations of EHR systems and archive systems are possible. Again, overall requirements for the design and security of the system and its archive will vary and must function under ethical and legal principles specific to the time and place{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

While it is currently unknown precisely how long EHRs will be preserved, it is certain that length of time will exceed the average shelf-life of paper records. The evolution of technology is such that the programs and systems used to input information will likely not be available to a user who desires to examine archived data. One proposed solution to the challenge of long-term accessibility and usability of data by future systems is to standardize information fields in a time-invariant way, such as with XML language. Olhede and Peterson report that "the basic XML-format has undergone preliminary testing in Europe by a Spri project and been found suitable for EU purposes. Spri has advised the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish National Archive to issue directives concerning the use of XML as the archive-format for EHCR (Electronic Health Care Record) information."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olhede T, Peterson HE |title=Archiving of care related information in XML-format |journal=Stud Health Technol Inform |volume=77 |issue= |pages=642–6 |year=2000 |pmid=11187632 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Synchronization of records===
When care is provided at two different facilities, it may be difficult to update records at both locations in a co-ordinated fashion.

Two models have been used to satisfy this problem: a [[Client–server model|centralized data server solution]], and a peer-to-peer [[file synchronization]] program (as has been developed for other [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer networks]]).

Synchronization programs for distributed storage models, however, are only useful once record standardization has occurred.

Merging of already existing public healthcare databases is a common software challenge. The ability of electronic health record systems to provide this function is a key benefit and can improve healthcare delivery.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 2004 | title = Integrating the New York citywide immunization registry and the childhood blood lead registry | journal = Journal of Public Health Management and Practice | pages = S72–80}}The Master Child Index consolidated 4,610,585 records that were contained in both databases into 2,977,290 records through a match and merge system.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | year = 2001 | title = Quality improvements in pediatric well care with an electronic record | journal = Proc AMIA Symp | pages = 209–13}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | year = 2004 | title = Perspectives on integrated child health information systems: Parents, providers, and public health | journal = Journal of Public Health Management Practice | pages = S57–S60 }}</ref>

==eHealth and teleradiology==
The sharing of patient information between health care organizations and IT systems is changing from a "point to point" model to a "many to many" one. The European Commission is supporting moves to facilitate cross-border interoperability of e-health systems and to remove potential legal hurdles, as in the project www.epsos.eu/. To allow for global shared workflow, studies will be locked when they are being read and then unlocked and updated once reading is complete. Radiologists will be able to serve multiple health care facilities and read and report across large geographical areas, thus balancing workloads. The biggest challenges will relate to interoperability and legal clarity. In some countries it is almost forbidden to practice teleradiology. The variety of languages spoken is a problem and multilingual reporting templates for all anatomical regions are not yet available. However, the market for e-health and teleradiology is evolving more rapidly than any laws or regulations.<ref>Pohjonen H.

June/July 2010;26(4):16.</ref>

==European Union: Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare==
The European Commission wants to boost the digital economy by enabling all Europeans to have access to online medical records anywhere in Europe by 2020. With the newly enacted Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare due for implementation by 2013, it is inevitable that a centralised European health record system will become a reality even before 2020. However, the concept of a centralised supranational central server raises concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location. The privacy threat posed by a supranational network is a key concern. Cross-border and Interoperable electronic health record systems make confidential data more easily and rapidly accessible to a wider audience and increase the risk that personal data concerning health could be accidentally exposed or easily distributed to unauthorised parties by enabling greater access to a compilation of the personal data concerning health, from different sources, and throughout a lifetime.<ref>[[Patrick Kierkegaard]] (2011) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364911001257 Electronic health record: Wiring Europe's healthcare], Computer Law &amp; Security Review, Volume 27, Issue 5, September 2011, Pages 503-515, ISSN 0267-3649, 10.1016/j.clsr.2011.07.013.

====2009 HITECH Act====
The [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act]] ({{uspl|111|5}},§2.A.III & B.4) (a part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 stimulus package]]) set meaningful use of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ehrmeaningfuluse/introduction.html|work=Meaningful Use|publisher=CDC|accessdate=31 October 2011|author=CDC|authorlink=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=Jun 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name=blumenthal2010>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMp0912825}}</ref> The "goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs — that is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care."<ref name=blumenthaltavenner>{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMp1006114}}</ref>

Title IV of the act promises maximum incentive payments for [[Medicaid]] to those who adopt and use "certified EHRs" of $63,750 over 6 years beginning in 2011. Eligible professionals must begin receiving payments by 2016 to qualify for the program. For Medicare the maximum payments are $44,000 over 5 years. Doctors who do not adopt an EHR by 2015 will be penalized 1% of Medicare payments, increasing to 3% over 3 years. In order to receive the EHR stimulus money, the [[HITECH Act]] requires doctors to show "meaningful use" of an EHR system. As of June 2010, there are no penalty provisions for Medicaid.<ref name="dbt.consultantlive.com"/>

[[Health information exchange]] (HIE) has emerged as a core capability for hospitals and physicians to achieve "meaningful use" and receive stimulus funding. Healthcare vendors are pushing HIE as a way to allow EHR systems to pull disparate data and function on a more interoperable level{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

Starting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare if they are not using electronic health records.<ref name="Pear"/>

====Meaningful use====
The main components of Meaningful Use are:
* The use of a certified EHR in a meaningful manner, such as e-prescribing.
* The use of certified EHR technology for electronic exchange of health information to improve quality of health care.
* The use of certified EHR technology to submit clinical quality and other measures.
In other words, providers need to show they're using certified EHR technology in ways that can be measured significantly in quality and in quantity.<ref>{{cite web|title=CMS EHR Meaningful Use Overview|url=http://www.cms.gov/ehrincentiveprograms/30_Meaningful_Use.asp|work=EHR Incentive Programs|publisher=Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services|accessdate=31 October 2011|author=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services|authorlink=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|date=Oct 12, 2011}}</ref>

The meaningful use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as follows:
* Improve care coordination
* Reduce healthcare disparities
* Engage patients and their families
* Improve population and public health
* Ensure adequate privacy and security

The Obama Administration's Health IT program intends to use federal investments to stimulate the market of electronic health records:
* Incentives: to providers who use IT
* Strict and open standards: To ensure users and sellers of EHRs work towards the same goal
* Certification of software: To provide assurance that the EHRs meet basic quality, safety, and efficiency standards

The detailed definition of "meaningful use" is to be rolled out in 3 stages over a period of time until 2015. Details of each stage are hotly debated by various groups. Only stage 1 has been defined while the remaining stages will evolve over time.<ref name="Center for Medicare and Medicaid">http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1325&parentname=CommunityPage&parentid=21&mode=2&in_hi_userid=10741&cached=true</ref>

'''Meaningful use Stage 1'''

The first steps in achieving meaningful use are to have a certified electronic health record (EHR) and to be able to demonstrate that it is being used to meet the requirements. Stage 1 contains 25 objectives/measures for Eligible Providers (EPs) and 24 objectives/measures for eligible hospitals. The objectives/measures have been divided into a core set and menu set. EPs and eligible hospitals must meet all objectives/measures in the core set (15 for EPs and 14 for eligible hospitals). EPs must meet 5 of the 10 menu-set items during Stage 1, one of which must be a public health objective.<ref name="The Office of the National Coordinator">http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?CommunityID=1206&spaceID=399&parentname=&control=SetCommunity&parentid=&PageID=0&space=CommunityPage&in_hi_totalgroups=1&in_hi_req_ddfolder=6652&in_ra_topoperator=or&in_hi_depth_1=0&in_hi_req_page=20&control=advancedstart&in_hi_req_objtype=18&in_hi_req_objtype=512&in_hi_req_objtype=514&in_hi_req_apps=1&in_hi_revealed_1=0&in_hi_userid=8969&in_hi_groupoperator_1=or&in_hi_model_mode=browse&cached=false&in_ra_groupoperator_1=or&in_tx_fulltext=stage+1</ref>

Full list of the Core Requirements and a full list of the Menu Requirements.

Core Requirements:

#Use computerized order entry for medication orders.
#Implement drug-drug, drug-allergy checks.
#Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically.
#Record demographics.
#Maintain an up-to-date problem list of current and active diagnoses.
#Maintain active medication list.
#Maintain active medication allergy list.
#Record and chart changes in vital signs.
#Record smoking status for patients 13 years old or older.
#Implement one clinical decision support rule.
#Report ambulatory quality measures to CMS or the States.
#Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information upon request.
#Provide clinical summaries to patients for each office visit.
#Capability to exchange key clinical information electronically among providers and patient authorized entities.
#Protect electronic health information (privacy & security)

Menu Requirements:

#Implement drug-formulary checks.
#Incorporate clinical lab-test results into certified EHR as structured data.
#Generate lists of patients by specific conditions to use for quality improvement, reduction of disparities, research, and outreach.
#Send reminders to patients per patient preference for preventive/ follow-up care
#Provide patients with timely electronic access to their health information (including lab results, problem list, medication lists, allergies)
#Use certified EHR to identify patient-specific education resources and provide to patient if appropriate.
#Perform medication reconciliation as relevant
#Provide summary care record for transitions in care or referrals.
#Capability to submit electronic data to immunization registries and actual submission.
#Capability to provide electronic syndromic surveillance data to public health agencies and actual transmission.

To receive federal incentive money, CMS requires participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to "attest" that during a 90-day reporting period, they used a certified EHR and met Stage 1 criteria for meaningful use objectives and clinical quality measures. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, providers follow a similar process using their state's attestation system.<ref>[http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/content/article/1462168/2009082 Torrieri, Marisa  "Dealing with Meaningful Use Attestation Aggravation"]. ''Physicians Practice''.  January 2012.</ref>

'''Meaningful use Stage 2'''

The government released its final ruling on achieving Stage 2 of meaningful use in August 2012. Eligible providers will need to meet 17 of 20 core objectives in Stage 2, and fulfill three out of six menu objectives. The required percentage of patient encounters that meet each objective has generally increased over the Stage 1 objectives.

While Stage 2 focuses more on information exchange and patient engagement, many large EHR systems have this type of functionality built into their software, making it easier to achieve compliance. Also, for those eligible providers who have successfully attested to Stage 1, meeting Stage 2 should not be as difficult, as it builds incrementally on the requirements for the first stage.<ref>[http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/content/article/1462168/2098253 "Meaningful Use: Stage 2 Regulations Overview"] Robert Anthony, CMS, August 30, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/content/article/1462168/2099001 "EHR Incentive Program: A Progress Report"] Marisa Torrieri, Physicians Practice, September 2012.</ref>

====Barriers to adoption====

=====Start-up costs=====
In a survey by DesRoches et al. (2008), 66% of physicians without EHRs cited capital costs as a barrier to adoption, while 50% were uncertain about the investment. Around 56% of physicians without EHRs stated that financial incentives to purchase and/or use EHRs would facilitate adoption.<ref name=desroches2008/> In 2002, initial costs were estimated to be $50,000&ndash;70,000 per physician in a 3-physician practice. Since then, costs have decreased with increasing adoption.<ref name=menachemi2011>{{cite doi|10.2147/RMHP.S12985}}</ref> A 2011 survey estimated a cost of $32,000 per physician in a 5-physician practice during the first 60 days of implementation.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0768}} cited in {{cite doi|10.2147/RMHP.S12985}}</ref>

One case study by Miller et al. (2005) of 14 small primary-care practices found that the average practice paid for the initial and ongoing costs within 2.5 years.<ref name=miller2005>{{cite doi|10.1377/hlthaff.24.5.1127}}</ref> A 2003 cost-benefit analysis found that using EMRs for 5 years created a net benefit of $86,000 per provider.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/S0002-9343(03)00057-3}}</ref>

Some physicians are skeptical of the positive claims and believe the data is skewed by vendors and others with an interest in EHR implementation.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, estimated it achieved net savings of $5 million to $10 million per year following installation of a computerized physician order entry system that reduced serious medication errors by 55 percent. Another large hospital generated about $8.6 million in annual savings by replacing paper medical charts with EHRs for outpatients and about $2.8 million annually by establishing electronic access to laboratory results and reports.<ref name="CALAO">{{cite web|title=A State Policy Approach: Promoting Health Information Technology in California|publisher=California Legislative Analyst Office|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/2007/health_info_tech/health_info_tech_021307.aspx|month=February | year=2007}}</ref>

=====Maintenance costs=====
Maintenance costs can be high.<ref name=menachemi2011/> Miller et al. found the average estimated maintenance cost was $8500 per [[Full-time equivalent|FTE]] health-care provider per year.<ref name=miller2005/>

Furthermore, software technology advances at a rapid pace. Most software systems require frequent updates, often at a significant ongoing cost. Some types of software and operating systems require full-scale re-implementation periodically, which disrupts not only the budget but also workflow. Costs for upgrades and associated regression testing can be particularly high where the applications are governed by FDA regulations (e.g. Clinical Laboratory systems). Physicians desire modular upgrades and ability to continually customize, without large-scale reimplementation{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

=====Training costs=====
Training of employees to use an EHR system is costly, just as for training in the use of any other hospital system. New employees, permanent or temporary, will also require training as they are hired.<ref name="Parish">Parish, Colin (March 20, 2006). Edging towards a brave new IT world. ''Nursing Standard'' 27:15-16</ref>

In the United States, a substantial majority of healthcare providers train at a VA facility sometime during their career. With the widespread adoption of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture ([[VistA]]) electronic health record system at all VA facilities, few recently-trained medical professionals will be inexperienced in electronic health record systems. Older practitioners who are less experienced in the use of electronic health record systems will retire over time.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

====Implementations====
In the United States, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) has the largest enterprise-wide health information system that includes an electronic medical record, known as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture ([[VistA]]). A key component in VistA is their [[VistA imaging]] System which provides a comprehensive multimedia data from many specialties, including cardiology, radiology and orthopedics. A [[graphical user interface]] known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient's electronic medical record at any of the VA's over 1,000 healthcare facilities. CPRS includes the ability to place orders, including medications, special procedures, X-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets, and laboratory tests.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The 2003 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) ensured that the VA and DoD would work together to establish a bidirectional exchange of reference quality medical images. Initially, demonstrations were only worked in El Paso, Texas, but capabilities have been expanded to six different locations of VA and DoD facilities. These facilities include VA polytrauma centers in Tampa and Richmond, Denver, North Chicago, Biloxi, and the National Capitol Area medical facilities. Radiological images such as CT scans, MRIs, and x-rays are being shared using the BHIE. Goals of the VA and DoD in the near future are to use several image sharing solutions (VistA Imaging and DoD Picture Archiving & Communications System (PACS) solutions).<ref name="www1.va.gov">[http://web.archive.org/web/20091024042950/http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=23] Retrieved March 4, 2010</ref>

Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository (CDHR)is a database that allows for sharing of patient records, especially allergy and pharmaceutical information, between the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) in the United States. The program shares data by translating the various vocabularies of the information being transmitted, allowing all of the VA facilities to access and interpret the patient records.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20091024045131/http://www1.va.gov/vadodhealthitsharing/page.cfm?pg=9] Retrieved March 4, 2010</ref> The Laboratory Data Sharing and Interoperability (LDSI) application is a new program being implemented to allow sharing at certain sites between the VA and DoD of "chemistry and hematology laboratory tests."

One attribute for the start of implementing EHRs in the States is the development of the [[Nationwide Health Information Network]] which is a work in progress and still being developed. This started with the North Carolina
Healthcare Information and Communication Alliance founded in 1994 and who received funding from [[Department of Health and Human Services]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Traynor Kate | year = 2008 | title = National health information network passes live test | url = | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 65 | issue = 22| pages = 2086–2087 }}</ref>

The Department of Veterans Affairs and [[Kaiser Permanente]] has a pilot program to share health records between their systems VistA and [[Kaiser Permanente#HealthConnect|HealthConnect]], respectively.<ref name=mearian>{{cite journal|last=Mearian|first=Lucas|title=VA, Kaiser Permanente launch e-health records exchange|journal=Computerworld|date=Jan 6, 2010|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9143199/VA_Kaiser_Permanente_launch_e_health_records_exchange|accessdate=31 October 2011|location=Framingham, MA|issn=0010-4841}}</ref>
This software called 'CONNECT' uses [[Nationwide Health Information Network]] standards and governance to make sure that health information exchanges are compatible with other exchanges being set up throughout the country. CONNECT is an open source software solution that supports electronic health information exchange.<ref>http://www.connectopensource.org/about/what-is-CONNECT Retrieved March 4, 2010</ref> The CONNECT initiative is a Federal Health Architecture project that was conceived in 2007 and initially built by 20 various federal agencies and now comprises more than 500 organizations including federal agencies, states, healthcare providers, insurers, and health IT vendors.<ref>http://connectopensource.osuosl.org/sites/connectopensource.osuosl.org/files/CONNECTOverview.pdf Retrieved March 4, 2010</ref>

The US Indian Health Service uses an EHR similar to VistA called RPMS. VistA Imaging is also being used to integrate images and co-ordinate PACS into the EHR system.

===UK===
{{see also|NHS Connecting for Health}}
In 2005 the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the [[United Kingdom]] began deployment of EHR systems.

===Australia===
[[Australia]] is dedicated to the development of a lifetime electronic health record for all its citizens. [[PCEHR]] - the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record -  is the major national EHR initiative in Australia, being delivered through territory, state, and federal governments. This electronic health record was initially deployed in July 2012, and is under active development and extension.<ref>http://www.ehealth.gov.au www.ehealth.gov.au</ref>

MediConnect is an earlier program that provides an electronic medication record to keep track of patient prescriptions and provide stakeholders with drug alerts to avoid errors in prescribing.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mason, Moya K.|title=What Can We Learn from the Rest of the World?

<br />
<br />
Within Australia, there is a not-for-profit organisation called [[Standards Australia]], which has created a electronic health website relating to information not only about Australia and what is currently going on about EHRs but also globally.  There is a large number of key stakeholders that contribute to the process of integrating EHRs within Australia,they range from each States Departments of Health to Universities around Australia and [http://www.nehta.gov.au/ National E-Health Transition Authority] to name a few.<ref>http://www.e-health.standards.org.au/ABOUTIT014/Stakeholders.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.standards.org.au/OurOrganisation/AboutUs/Pages/default.aspx</ref> <ref>http://www.e-health.standards.org.au/Home.aspx</ref>

===Austria===
[[File:20120217_structure_of_the_Austrian_electronic_health_records_(ELGA).jpg|thumb|right|Structure and basic components of the Austrian EHR (ELGA)]]In December 2012 [[Austria]] introduced an Electronic Health Records Act (EHR-Act).<ref>[http://www.ilia.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/austrian_ehr-act_ILIA.pdf Electronic Health Records Act (EHR-Act)]</ref> These provisions are the legal foundation for a national EHR system based upon a substantial public interest according to Art 8(4) of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC]</ref> In compliance to the Data Protection Directive (DPD) national electronic health records could be based upon explicit consent (Art 8(2)(a) DPD), the necessity for healthcare purposes (Art&nbsp;8(3) DPD) or substantial public interests (Art 8(4) DPD).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reimer|first=Sebastian|title=Current and Future Settings of Austrian Legislation Regarding Electronic Health Records|page=21|year=2012|issue=2|journal=European Journal on Biomedical Informatics|url=http://www.ejbi.org/img/ejbi/2012/2/Reimer_en.pdf}}</ref>

The Austrian EHR-Act pursues an opt-out approach in order to harmonize the interests of public health and privacy in the best possible manner.

The 4th Part of the Austrian Health Telematics Act 2012 (HTA 2012) - these are the EHR provisions - are one of the most detailed data protection rules within Austrian legislation. Numerous safeguards according to Art 8(4) DPD guarantee a high level of data protection. For example:
* personal health data needs to be encrypted prior to transmission (§ 6 HTA 2012), or
* strict rules on data usage allow personal health data only to be used for treatment purposes or exercising patients' rights (§ 14 HTA 2012), or
* patients may declare their right to opt out from the national EHR at any time (§ 15 HTA 2012), or
* the implementation of an EHR-Ombudsman, to support the patients in exercising their rights (§ 17 HTA 2012), or
* the Access Control Center provides EHR-participants with full control over their data (§ 21 HTA 2012), or
* judicial penalties for privacy breaches (Art 7 of the EHR-Act).

===Canada===
The Canadian province of [[Alberta]] started a large-scale operational EHR system project in 2005 called [[Alberta Netcare]], which is expected to encompass all of Alberta by 2008.

The [http://www.cdsbc.org College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia] has compiled the [http://www.cdsbc.org/~ASSETS/DOCUMENT/Dental-Records-Mgt.pdf Dental Records Management] document which lays out the requirements, for records for their industry within the province of British Columbia.


===Jordan===
In 2009, the Jordanian Government made a strategic decision to address quality and cost challenges in their healthcare system by investing in an effective, national e-health infrastructure.  Following a period of detailed consultation and investigation, Jordan adopted the electronic health record system of the US  Veterans Health Administration [[VistA_EHR]] because it was a proven, national-scale enterprise system capable of scaling to hundreds of hospitals and millions of patients.   [http://nhsvista.net/jordan/]  In 2010 three of the country's largest hospitals went live with [[VistA_EHR]]. It is anticipated that all further hospital deployments based on this 'gold' version will require less than 20% effort and cost of the original hospitals, enabling rapid national coverage.  The implementation of VistA EHR was estimated at 75% less cost than proprietary products, with the greatest savings related to reduced costs of configuration, customization, implementation and support.  When completed, Jordan will be the largest country in the world with a single, comprehensive, national electronic health care delivery network to care for the country’s entire population in a single electronic network of over 850 hospitals and clinics.

===Denmark===
The five [[Regions of Denmark|regions]] each use their own setup of electronic health record systems. However, all patient data is registered in the national [https://www.sundhed.dk/borger/min-side/mine-sundhedsdata/min-e-journal/ e-journal].

===Estonia===
Estonia is the first country in the world that has implemented a nationwide EHR system, registering virtually all residents' medical history from birth to death.<ref>http://recordaccess.icmcc.org/tag/portal/</ref>

===Netherlands===
The fast majority of GP's <ref>http://www.informationWeek.com/healthcare/electronic-medical-records/ehr-adoption-us-remains-the-slow-poke/240142152, Ken Terry, Informationweek </ref> and all pharmacies and hospitals use EHR's. In hospitals computerized ordermanagment and medical imaging systems (PACS) are widely accepted.
Whereas healthcare institutions continue to upgrade their EHR's functionalties, the national infrastructure is still far from being generally accepted.

In 2012 the national EHR restarted under the joined ownership of GP's, pharmacies and hospitals. A major change is that as of January 2013 patients have to give their explicit permission that their data may be exchanged over the national infrastrucure.
The national EHR is a virtual EHR and basically is a reference server which knows in which local EHR what kind of patientdata is stored.
[[EDIFACT]] still is the most common way to exchange patient information electroniaclly between hospitals and GP's.

Abu Dhabi is leading the way in using national EHR data as a live longitudinal cohort in the assessment of risk of cardiovascular disease.<ref>http://www.3four50.com/v2/?page=summit10-vid23</ref>
