'''DRACO''' ("'''D'''ouble-stranded '''R'''NA ([[Dsrna#Double-stranded_RNA|dsRNA]]) '''A'''ctivated [[caspase|'''C'''aspase]] [[Oligomer|'''O'''ligomerizer]]") is a group of experimental [[antiviral drug]]s under development at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. DRACO is reported to have broad-spectrum efficacy against many infectious viruses, including ''[[Marburg marburgvirus]]'' and ''[[Zaire ebolavirus]]'', [[dengue virus|dengue flavivirus]], Amapari and Tacaribe [[arenavirus]], Guama [[Bunyaviridae|bunyavirus]], [[H1N1 influenza]] and [[rhinovirus]]. DRACO is reported to induce rapid [[apoptosis]] selectively in virus-infected mammalian cells, while leaving uninfected cells unharmed.<ref name="pmid21818340">{{cite journal |author=Rider TH, Zook CE, Boettcher TL, Wick ST, Pancoast JS, Zusman BD |title=Broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e22572 |year=2011 |pmid=21818340 |pmc=3144912 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022572}}</ref><ref name="Macrae">{{citation |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2024492/Greatest-discovery-penicillin-Scientists-work-drug-cure-viruses--including-flu.html |title=Greatest discovery since penicillin: A cure for everything - from colds to HIV |work=The Daily Mail |location=UK | |author=Fiona Macrae | date=11 August 2011 }}</ref>

==Mechanism==
DRACO is selective for virus-infected cells.  Differentiation between infected and healthy cells is made primarily via the length and type of RNA transcription helices present within the cell.  Most viruses produce long dsRNA helices during transcription and replication. In contrast, uninfected mammalian cells generally produce dsRNA helices of fewer than 24 base pairs during transcription.
Cell death is effected via one of the last steps in the apoptosis pathway in which complexes containing intracellular apoptosis signaling molecules simultaneously bind multiple [[caspase|procaspases]]. The procaspases transactivate via cleavage, activate additional caspases in the cascade, and cleave a variety of cellular proteins, thereby killing the cell.<ref name="pmid21818340"/>
