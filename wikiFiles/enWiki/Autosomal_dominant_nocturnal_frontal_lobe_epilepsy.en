'''[[Autosomal dominant]] [[nocturnal]] [[frontal lobe]] [[epilepsy]]''' (ADNFLE) is an epileptic disorder that causes frequent violent seizures during sleep. These seizures often involve complex motor movements, such as hand clenching, arm raising/lowering, and knee bending. Vocalizations such as shouting, moaning, or crying are also common. ADNFLE is often misdiagnosed as [[nightmare]]s. Attacks often occur in clusters and typically first manifest in childhood. There are four known loci for ADNFLE, three with known causative genes. These genes encode various [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] α and β subunits CHRNA4, CHRNB2, and CHRNA2.

==Signs and symptoms==
ADNFLE is a partial epilepsy disorder characterized by brief violent seizures during sleep. Seizures are complex, consisting of arm and leg movements, fist clenching, and vocalizations such as yelling and moaning. These seizures often occur in clusters and can first manifest in childhood. Diagnosis is often initially incorrectly made as [[nightmare]]s, [[night terror]]s, [[parasomnia]]s and various psychiatric disorders.

==Causes==
While not well understood, it is believed that malfunction in [[thalamocortical loop]]s plays a vital role in ADNFLE. The reasons for this belief are threefold. Firstly, thalamocortical loops are important in [[sleep]] and the [[frontal cortex]] is the origin of ADNFLE seizures. Secondly, both the [[thalamus]] and cortex receive cholinergic inputs and [[acetylcholine receptor]] subunits comprise the three known causative genes for ADNFLE. Thirdly, [[K-complex]] are almost invariably present at the start of seizures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = El Helou | first1 = J | last2 = Navarro | first2 = V | last3 = Depienne | first3 = C | last4 = Fedirko | first4 = E | last5 = LeGuern | first5 = E | last6 = Baulac | first6 = M | last7 = An-Gourfinkel | first7 = I | last8 = Adam | first8 = C. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2008 | title = K-complex-induced seizures in autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy | url = | journal = Clin Neurophysiol | volume = 119 | issue = 10| pages = 2201–4 | pmid = 18762450 | doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2008.07.212}}</ref>
It is thought that epilepsy is caused because these receptor subunits are expressed presynaptically by neurons that release the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Therefore, the mutation in the alpha-4 sunubit could lead to reduced GABA release, causing hyperexcitability.

==Pathophysiology==
===CHRNA4===
The first mutation associated with ADNFLE is a [[serine]] to [[phenylalanine]] transition at position 248 (S248F) according to the [[Pacific electric ray]] ''Torpedo californica'' protein numbering, located in the second transmembrane spanning region of the gene encoding a [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] α subunit.<ref name="Steinlein_1995">{{cite journal | author = Steinlein O, Mulley J, Propping P, Wallace R, Phillips H, Sutherland G, Scheffer I, Berkovic S | title = A missense mutation in the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit is associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–3 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7550350 | doi = 10.1038/ng1095-201}}</ref> Using the numbering based on the human CHRNA4 protein, this mutation is called S280F.<ref name="Matsushima_2002">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0920-1211(01)00336-9 | author = Matsushima N, Hirose S, Iwata H, Fukuma G, Yonetani M, Nagayama C, Hamanaka W, Matsunaka Y, Ito M, Kaneko S, Mitsudome A, Sugiyama H. | title = Mutation (Ser284Leu) of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit associated with frontal lobe epilepsy causes faster desensitization of the rat receptor expressed in oocytes. | journal = Epilepsy Res | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11904236 }}</ref> Receptors containing this mutant subunit are functional, but [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitize]] at a much faster pace compared to wild-type only receptors.

The second discovered ADNFLE mutation was also in CHRNA4. This mutation, L259_I260insL, is caused by the insertion of three nucleotides (GCT) between a stretch of [[leucine]] [[amino acid]]s and an [[isoleucine]]. As with the S248F mutation, the L259_I260insL mutation is located in the second transmembrane spanning region. Electrophysiological experiments have shown that this mutant is tenfold more sensitive to [[acetylcholine]] than wild-type. Calcium permeability, however is notably decreased in mutant compared to wild-type containing receptors.<ref name="Steinlein_1997">{{cite journal | author = Steinlein O, Magnusson A, Stoodt J, Bertrand S, Weiland S, Berkovic S, Nakken K, Propping P, Bertrand D | title = An insertion mutation of the CHRNA4 gene in a family with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. | journal = Hum Mol Genet | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 943–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9175743 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/6.6.943}}</ref> Furthermore, this mutant shows slowed desensitization compared to both wild-type and S248F mutant receptors.<ref name="Bertrand_1998"/><ref name="Bertrand_2002"/>

The most recently discovered mutation in CHRNA4 associated with ADNFLE is T265M, again located in the second transmembrane spanning segment. This mutation has been little studied and all that is known is that it produces receptors with increased sensitivity to acetylcholine and has a low penetrance.<ref name="Leniger_2003">{{cite journal | author = Leniger T, Kananura C, Hufnagel A, Bertrand S, Bertrand D, Steinlein O | title = A new Chrna4 mutation with low penetrance in nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 981–5 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12823585 | doi = 10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.61102.x}}</ref>

===15q24===
Some families have been shown to not have mutations in CHRNA4 and, furthermore, to show no [[Genetic linkage|linkage]] around it. Instead some of these families show strong linkage on [[chromosome 15]] (15q24) near CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNB4. Causative genes in this area are still unknown.<ref name="Phillips_1998">{{cite journal | author = Phillips H, Scheffer I, Crossland K, Bhatia K, Fish D, Marsden C, Howell S, Stephenson J, Tolmie J, Plazzi G, Eeg-Olofsson O, Singh R, Lopes-Cendes I, Andermann E, Andermann F, Berkovic S, Mulley J | title = Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal-lobe epilepsy: genetic heterogeneity and evidence for a second locus at 15q24. | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 1108–16 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9758605 | doi = 10.1086/302047 | pmc = 1377480}}</ref>

===CHRNB2===
Three mutations have been found in the gene CHRNB2, which encodes an acetylcholine receptor β subunit. Two of these mutations, V287L and V287M, occur at the same amino acid, again in the second transmembrane spanning region. The V287L mutation results in receptors that desensitize at a much slower rate compared to wild-type.<ref name="De_Fusco_2000">{{cite journal | author = De Fusco M, Becchetti A, Patrignani A, Annesi G, Gambardella A, Quattrone A, Ballabio A, Wanke E, Casari G | title = The nicotinic receptor beta 2 subunit is mutant in nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–6 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11062464 | doi = 10.1038/81566}}</ref> The V287M mutant displays a higher affinity for acetylcholine when compared to wild-type receptors.<ref name="Bertrand_2002"/><ref name="Phillips_2001">{{cite journal | author = Phillips H, Favre I, Kirkpatrick M, Zuberi S, Goudie D, Heron S, Scheffer I, Sutherland G, Berkovic S, Bertrand D, Mulley J | title = CHRNB2 is the second acetylcholine receptor subunit associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 68 | issue = 1 | pages = 225–31 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11104662 | doi = 10.1086/316946 | pmc = 1234917}}</ref> As with the mutations in CHRNA4, these mutants lead to receptors less sensitive to calcium.<ref name="Rodrigues-Pinguet_2003"/>

The other known mutation in CHRNB2 is I312M, located in the third membrane-spanning region. Receptors containing these mutant subunits display much larger currents and a higher sensitivity to acetylcholine than wild-type receptors.<ref name="Bertrand_2005">{{cite journal | author = Bertrand D, Elmslie F, Hughes E, Trounce J, Sander T, Bertrand S, Steinlein O | title = The CHRNB2 mutation I312M is associated with epilepsy and distinct memory deficits. | journal = Neurobiol Dis | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 799–804 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15964197 | doi = 10.1016/j.nbd.2005.05.013}}</ref>

===CHRNA2===
Recently, the I279N mutation has been discovered in the first transmembrane spanning segment of CHRNA2, which encodes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α subunit similar to that encoded by CHRNA4. This mutant shows a higher sensitivity to acetylcholine and unchanged desensitization compared to wild-type.<ref name="Aridon_2006">{{cite journal | author = Aridon P, Marini C, Di Resta C, Brilli E, De Fusco M, Politi F, Parrini E, Manfredi I, Pisano T, Pruna D, Curia G, Cianchetti C, Pasqualetti M, Becchetti A, Guerrini R, Casari G | title = Increased sensitivity of the neuronal nicotinic receptor alpha 2 subunit causes familial epilepsy with nocturnal wandering and ictal fear. | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 342–50 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16826524 | doi = 10.1086/506459 | pmc = 1559502}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically made upon patient history, although [[EEG]] recordings can be confirmatory if they occur during attacks.

==Treatment/Management==
Anti-epileptic drugs are normally used to combat ADNFLE. These drugs are discussed in the [[Epilepsy#Treatment|main epilepsy article]].
