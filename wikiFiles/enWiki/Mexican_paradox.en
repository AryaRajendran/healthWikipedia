The '''Mexican paradox''' is the observation that [[Demographics of Mexico|the Mexican people]] exhibit a surprisingly low incidence of low [[birth mass]], contrary to what would be expected from their [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). This appears as an [[outlier]] in graphs correlating SES with low-birth-weight rates. 

It has been proposed that resistance to changes in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is responsible for the positive birth weight association for Mexican-American mothers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McGlade MS, Saha S, Dahlstrom ME |title=The Latina Paradox: An Opportunity for Restructuring Prenatal Care Delivery |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=94 |issue=12 |pages=2062–5 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15569952 |pmc=1448590 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15569952 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.12.2062}}</ref>

Nevertheless, the medical causes of lower rates of [[low birth weight]]s (LBW) among birthing Mexican mothers has been called into question.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Buekens P, Notzon F, Kotelchuck M, Wilcox A |title=Why do Mexican Americans give birth to few low-birth-weight infants? |journal=Am. J. Epidemiol. |volume=152 |issue=4 |pages=347–51 |year=2000 |month=August |pmid=10968379 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/152/4/347 |doi=10.1093/aje/152.4.347}}</ref>

The results of the study showed that the mean birth weight of Mexican-American babies was 3.34&nbsp;kg (7.37&nbsp;lbs), while that of [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|non-Hispanic White]] babies was 3.39&nbsp;kg (7.48&nbsp;lbs.). This finding re-emphasized the independence of mean birth weight and LBW. This however did not refute the discrepancies in LBW for Mexicans. 

The study also showed that the overall [[preterm birth]] rate was higher among Mexican Americans (10.6%) than non-Hispanic Whites (9.3%). 

The overall hypothesis of the authors was that this finding reflected an error in recorded [[gestational age]], described in a strongly [[bimodal]] birth-weight distribution at young gestational ages for Mexican-Americans.
