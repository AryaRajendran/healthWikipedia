'''Acromegaly''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|æ|k|r|ɵ|ˈ|m|ɛ|ɡ|əl|i}}; from [[Greek language|Greek]] άκρος ''akros'' "extreme" or "extremities" and μεγάλος ''megalos'' "large") is a [[syndrome]] that results when the [[anterior pituitary]] gland produces excess [[growth hormone]] (GH) after [[epiphyseal plate]] closure at [[puberty]]. A number of disorders may increase the pituitary's GH output, although most commonly it involves a GH-producing tumor called [[pituitary adenoma]], derived from a distinct type of cell ([[somatotroph]]s).

Acromegaly most commonly affects adults in middle age,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec13/ch162/ch162e.html |title=Acromegaly and Gigantism |publisher=Merck.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101105075625/http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec13/ch162/ch162e.html| archivedate= 5 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and can result in severe disfigurement, complicating conditions, and premature death if unchecked. Because of its [[pathogenesis]] and slow progression, the disease is hard to diagnose in the early stages and is frequently missed for years until changes in external features, especially of the face, become noticeable.

Acromegaly is often associated with [[gigantism]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Features that result from high level of GH or expanding tumor include:
* [[Soft tissue]] swelling visibly resulting in enlargement of the hands, feet, nose, lips and ears, and a general thickening of the skin.
* Soft tissue swelling of internal organs, notably the heart with attendant weakening of its muscularity, and the kidneys, also the [[vocal cords]] resulting in a characteristic thick, deep voice and slowing of speech
* Generalized expansion of the skull at the [[fontanelle]]
* Pronounced brow protrusion, often with ocular distension
* Pronounced lower jaw protrusion with attendant [[macroglossia]] (enlargement of the tongue) and teeth gapping
* [[Hypertrichosis]], [[hyperpigmentation]], and [[hyperhidrosis]] may occur in these patients.<ref name="Andrews">James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). ''Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology''. (10th ed.). Saunders. ISBN 0-7216-2921-0.</ref>{{Rp|499|date=May 2009}}

==Causes==
===Pituitary adenoma===
In over 90 percent of acromegaly patients, the overproduction of growth hormones is caused by a [[benign tumor]] of the pituitary gland, called an [[pituitary adenoma|adenoma]]. These tumors produce excess growth hormones and, as they expand, compress surrounding brain tissues, such as the [[optic nerve]]s. This expansion causes the headaches and visual disturbances that often accompany acromegaly. In addition, compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other [[hormones]], leading to changes in [[menstruation]] and breast discharge in women and [[impotence]] in men because of reduced [[testosterone]] production.

There is a marked variation in rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of growth hormone excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the [[Paranasal sinuses|sinuses]], which are located near the pituitary. In general, younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors.

Most pituitary tumors arise spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. Many pituitary tumors arise from a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell which leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or [[mutation]], is not present at birth, but is acquired during life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells; it permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete growth hormones. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary [[cell growth]] and growth hormone oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.

===Other tumors===
In a few patients, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors but by [[tumor]]s of the [[pancreas]], [[lung]]s, and [[adrenal gland]]s. These tumors also lead to an excess of GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce [[GHRH]] (Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone), the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. In these patients, the excess GHRH can be measured in the blood and establishes that the cause of the acromegaly is not due to a pituitary defect. When these non-pituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.

In patients with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Therefore, it is important that physicians carefully analyze all "pituitary tumors" removed from patients with acromegaly in order not to overlook the possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder.

==Complications==
* Severe [[headache]]
* [[Arthritis]] and [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]
* Enlarged heart
* [[Hypertension]]
* [[Diabetes mellitus]]
* [[Heart failure]]
* [[Kidney failure]]
* [[Colorectal cancer]] <ref>{{cite journal |author=Renehan AG, O'Connell J, O'Halloran D, ''et al.'' |title=Acromegaly and colorectal cancer: a comprehensive review of epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and clinical implications |journal=Horm. Metab. Res. |volume=35 |issue=11-12 |pages=712–25 |year=2003 |pmid=14710350 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-814150 |url=}}</ref>
* Compression of the [[optic chiasm]] leading to loss of vision in the outer visual fields (typically [[bitemporal hemianopia]])
* Increased palmar sweating and [[sebum]] production over the face ([[seborrhea]]) are clinical indicators of active growth hormone (GH) producing pituitary tumors. These symptoms can also be used to monitor the activity of the tumor after surgery although biochemical monitoring is confirmatory.

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Acromegaly growth hormone levels.JPEG|thumb|Frequent blood sampling with serum GH measurement shows that in normal subjects (left panel) GH can fluctuate between undetectable levels (most of the time) and peaks of up to 30 μg/l (90 mIU/l), owing to the episodic nature of GH secretion, while in patients with acromegaly (an example is given on right panel), GH hypersecretion is continuous and GH never returns to undetectable levels.]]

If acromegaly is suspected, [[medical imaging]] and [[medical laboratory]] investigations are generally used together to confirm or rule out the presence of this condition.

[[IGF1]] provides the most sensitive lab test for the diagnosis of acromegaly, and a GH suppression test following an oral [[glucose]] load, which is a very specific lab test, will confirm the diagnosis following a positive screening test for IGF1. A single value of the growth hormone (GH) is not useful in view of its pulsatality (levels in the blood vary greatly even in healthy individuals).[[Image:Acromegaly pituitary macroadenoma.JPEG|thumb|left|[[Magnetic resonance image]] of a [[pituitary macroadenoma]] that caused acromegaly with compression of the [[optic chiasm]].]] GH levels taken 2 hours after a 75 or 100&nbsp;gram [[glucose tolerance test]] are helpful in the diagnosis: GH levels are suppressed below 1 μg/L in normal people, and levels higher than this cutoff are confirmatory of acromegaly.

Other pituitary hormones have to be assessed to address the secretory effects of the tumor as well as the mass effect of the tumor on the normal pituitary gland. They include [[thyroid stimulating hormone|TSH]] (thyroid stimulating hormone), [[gonadotrophin|gonadotropic hormones]] (FSH, LH), [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] (adrenocorticotropic hormone), [[prolactin]].

An [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of the brain focusing on the [[sella turcica]] after [[gadolinium]] administration allows for clear delineation of the pituitary and the hypothalamus and the location of the tumor.

==Treatment==
The goals of treatment are to reduce GH production to normal levels, to relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor exerts on the surrounding brain areas, to preserve normal pituitary function, and to reverse or ameliorate the symptoms of acromegaly. Currently, treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor, [[drug therapy]], and [[radiation therapy]] of the pituitary.

===Drugs===

====Somatostatin analogues====
[[Image:Acromegaly treatment diagram.JPEG|thumb|Site of action of the different therapeutic tools in acromegaly. [[Surgery]], [[radiotherapy]], [[somatostatin analogue]]s and [[dopamine agonist]]s act at the level of the [[pituitary adenoma]], while [[GH-receptor antagonist]]s act in periphery by blocking the [[growth hormone receptor]] and thus impairing the effects of GH on the different tissues.]]
The primary current medical treatment of acromegaly is to use somatostatin analogues – [[octreotide]] (Sandostatin) or [[lanreotide]] (Somatuline).
These somatostatin analogues are synthetic forms of a brain hormone, [[somatostatin]], which stops GH production. The long-acting forms of these drugs must be injected every 2 to 4 weeks for effective treatment. Most patients with acromegaly respond to this medication. In many patients, GH levels fall within one hour and headaches improve within minutes after the injection. Octreotide and lanreotide are effective for long-term treatment. Octreotide and lanreotide have also been used successfully to treat patients with acromegaly caused by non-pituitary tumors.

Somatostatin analogues are also sometimes used to shrink large tumors before surgery.

Because octreotide inhibits gastrointestinal and pancreatic function, long-term use causes digestive problems such as loose stools, nausea, and gas in one third of patients. In addition, approximately 25 percent of patients develop [[gallstone]]s, which are usually asymptomatic. In some cases, octreotide treatment can cause [[diabetes]] due to the fact that [[somatostatin]] and its analogues can inhibit the release of [[insulin]]. On the other hand, scientists have found that in some acromegaly patients who already have diabetes, octreotide can reduce the need for insulin and improve [[blood sugar]] control.

====Dopamine agonists====
For those who are unresponsive to somatostatin analogues, or for whom they are otherwise contraindicated, it is possible to treat using one of the [[dopamine agonists]], [[Bromocriptine]] (Parlodel) or [[Cabergoline]]. These have the advantage of being tablets rather than injections, and cost considerably less. These drugs can also be used as an adjunct to somatostatin analogue therapy. They are most effective in those whose pituitary tumours cosecrete [[prolactin]]. Side effects of these dopamine agonists include gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness when standing, and nasal congestion. These side effects can be reduced or eliminated if medication is started at a very low dose at bedtime, taken with food, and gradually increased to the full therapeutic dose. However, bromocriptine lowers GH and [[IGF-1]] levels and reduces tumor size in fewer than half of patients with acromegaly. Some patients report improvement in their symptoms although their GH and IGF-1 levels still are elevated.

====Growth hormone receptor antagonists====
The latest development in the medical treatment of acromegaly is the use of [[growth hormone receptor]] antagonists. The only available member of this family is [[pegvisomant]] (Somavert). By blocking the action of the endogenous growth hormone molecules, this compound is able to control disease activity of acromegaly in virtually all patients. Pegvisomant has to be administered subcutaneously by daily injections. Combinations of long-acting somatostatin analogues and weekly injections of pegvisomant seem to be equally effective as daily injections of pegvisomant.

===Surgery===

Surgery is a rapid and effective treatment, of which there are two alternative methods. The first method, a procedure known as [[Endonasal Transphenoidal surgery]], involves the surgeon reaching the pituitary through an incision in the [[nasal cavity]] wall. The wall is reached by passing through the [[nostril]]s with [[Microsurgery|microsurgical]] instruments. The second method is Transsphenoidal surgery during which an incision is made into the gum beneath the upper lip. Further incisions are made to cut through the [[septum]] to reach the nasal cavity, where the pituitary is located. Endonasal Transphenoidal surgery is a less invasive procedure with a shorter recovery time than the older method of Transphenoidal surgery, and the likelihood of removing the entire tumor is greater with reduced side-effects. Consequently, Endonasal Transphenoidal surgery is often used as a first option, with Transphenoidal and other treatments, such as medicinal therapy or radiostatic [[neurosurgery]], being used to reduce the remaining adverse effects of the remaining tumor.

These procedures normally relieve the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and lead to a lowering of GH levels. Surgery is most successful in patients with blood GH levels below 40&nbsp;ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10&nbsp;mm in diameter. Success depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. The success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. Ideally, GH should be less than 2&nbsp;ng/ml after an oral glucose load. A review of GH levels in 1,360 patients worldwide immediately after surgery revealed that 60 percent had random GH levels below 5&nbsp;ng/ml. Complications of surgery may include [[cerebrospinal fluid]] leaks, [[meningitis]], or damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, requiring lifelong pituitary [[hormone replacement]].

Even when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, patients must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence. More commonly, hormone levels may improve, but not return completely to normal. These patients may then require additional treatment, usually with medications.

===Radiation therapy===
Radiation therapy has been used both as a primary treatment and combined with surgery or drugs. It is usually reserved for patients who have tumor remaining after surgery. These patients often also receive medication to lower GH levels. Radiation therapy is given in divided doses over four to six weeks. This treatment lowers GH levels by about 50 percent over 2 to 5 years. Patients monitored for more than 5 years show significant further improvement. Radiation therapy causes a gradual loss of production of other pituitary hormones with time. Loss of vision and brain injury, which have been reported, are very rare complications of radiation treatments.

===Choice of treatment===
No single treatment is effective for all patients. Treatment should be individualized depending on patient characteristics, such as age and tumor size. If the tumor has not yet invaded surrounding brain tissues, removal of the pituitary adenoma by an experienced neurosurgeon is usually the first choice. After surgery, a patient must be monitored for a long time for increasing GH levels. If surgery does not normalize hormone levels or a relapse occurs, a doctor will usually begin additional drug therapy. The current first choice is generally octreotide or lanreotide. However, bromocriptine or cabergoline are much cheaper and easier to administer. With both types of medication, long-term therapy is necessary because their withdrawal can lead to rising GH levels and tumor re-expansion. Radiation therapy is generally used for patients whose tumors are not completely removed by surgery; for patients who are not good candidates for surgery because of other health problems; and for patients who do not respond adequately to surgery and medication.

===Prognosis upon treatment===
Upon successful treatment, symptoms and complications generally improve substantially or disappear, including headaches, visual disturbances, excess sweating and diabetes.<ref name=royalberkshire/> Soft tissue swellings generally decrease and acromegaly-associated facial features gradually return towards normal although this may take some time.<ref name=royalberkshire/> Life expectancy after the successful treatment of early acromegaly is equal to that of the normal population.<ref name=royalberkshire>[http://www.royalberkshire.nhs.uk/pdf/Acromegaly_jan11.pdf Acromegaly - Patient information] from Centre for Diabetes and Endocrinology at The Royal Berkshire NHS

==Pseudoacromegaly==
Pseudoacromegaly is a condition with the usual acromegaloid features but without an increase in growth hormone and IGF-1. It is frequently associated with insulin resistance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yaqub A, Yaqub N |title=Insulin-mediated pseudoacromegaly: a case report and review of the literature |journal=W V Med J |volume=104 |issue=5 |pages=12–5 |year=2008 |pmid=18846753 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Cases have been reported due to [[minoxidil]] at an unusually high dose.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nguyen KH, Marks JG |title=Pseudoacromegaly induced by the long-term use of minoxidil |journal=J.
