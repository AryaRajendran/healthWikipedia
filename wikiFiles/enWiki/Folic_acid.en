Folate is composed of the aromatic pteridine ring linked to para-aminobenzoic acid and one or more glutamate residues. Folic acid is itself not biologically active, but its biological importance is due to [[tetrahydrofolate]] and other derivatives after its conversion to [[dihydrofolic acid]] in the [[liver]].<ref name="Bailey">{{cite journal |author=Bailey SW, Ayling JE  |title=The extremely slow and variable activity of dihydrofolate reductase in human liver and its implications for high folic acid intake |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=106 |issue=36 |pages=15424–9  |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19706381 |pmc=2730961 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0902072106}}</ref>

Vitamin B<sub>9</sub> (folic acid and folate) is [[essential nutrient|essential]] for numerous [[physiology|bodily function]]s. Humans cannot synthesize folate de novo; therefore, folate has to be supplied through the diet to meet their daily requirements. The human body needs folate to synthesize DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a cofactor in certain biological reactions.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = SJ ''et al.'' | year = 2003 | title = Null Association Between Prostate Cancer and Serum Folate, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and Homocysteine | url =http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/12/11/1271.full.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=1 December 2010 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, & Prevention | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 1271–1272 }}</ref> It is especially important in aiding rapid [[cell division]] and [[cell growth|growth]], such as in infancy and pregnancy.

Folate and folic acid derive their names from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Wiktionary:folium|folium]]'' (which means "leaf").  Leafy vegetables are principal sources of folic acid, although in Western diets fortified cereals and bread may be a larger dietary source.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A lack of [[diet (nutrition)|dietary]] folates leads to [[folate deficiency]], which is uncommon in normal Western diets.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
A complete lack of dietary folate takes months before deficiency develops as normal individuals have about 500–20,000&nbsp;µg<ref>Gentili et al, 2009, Folic Acid Deficiency  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/200184-overview</ref> of folate in body stores.<ref>National Health Service U.K., "Anaemia, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency – Causes" http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anaemia-vitamin-B12-and-folate-deficiency/Pages/Causes.aspx</ref> This deficiency can result in many health problems, the most notable one being [[neural tube defects]] in developing embryos. Common symptoms of folate deficiency include diarrhea, [[macrocytic anemia]] with weakness or shortness of breath, nerve damage with weakness and limb numbness ([[peripheral neuropathy]]),<ref>Botez, M.I.1976. Folate deficiency and neurological disorders in adults. Medical Hypothesis.volume 2, issue 4 pages 135–140</ref> pregnancy complications, mental confusion, forgetfulness or other cognitive declines, mental depression, sore or swollen tongue, peptic or mouth ulcers, headaches, heart palpitations, irritability, and behavioral disorders.  Low levels of folate can also lead to homocysteine accumulation.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> DNA synthesis and repair are impaired and this could lead to cancer development.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Adequate folate intake during the [[preconception period]] (which is the time right before and just after a woman becomes pregnant) helps protect against a number of [[Congenital disorder|congenital malformations]], including [[neural tube defect]]s (which are the most notable birth defects that occur from folate deficiency).<ref name="Oldref_21">{{cite journal|author=Shaw GM, Schaffer D, Velie EM, Morland K, Harris JA |title=Periconceptional vitamin use, dietary folate, and the occurrence of neural tube defects|journal=Epidemiology|volume=6|issue=3|year=1995|pages=219–226|pmid=7619926|doi=10.1097/00001648-199505000-00005}}</ref>  Neural tube defects are severe abnormalities of the central nervous system that develop in babies during the first few weeks of pregnancy resulting in malformations of the spine, skull, and brain; the most common neural tube defects are  spina bifida and anencephaly.

===Stroke===
Folic acid appears to reduce the risk of stroke, which may be due to the role folate plays in regulating homocysteine concentration. The reviews indicate the risk of stroke appears to be reduced only in some individuals, but a definite recommendation regarding supplementation beyond the current RDA has not been established for stroke prevention.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6709101.stm |title=Folic acid 'reduces stroke risks' |date= 31 May 2007 | work=BBC News  | location = London}}</ref> Observed stroke reduction is consistent with the reduction in [[pulse pressure]] produced by folate supplementation of 5&nbsp;mg per day, since hypertension is a key risk factor for stroke.

Some investigations have proposed that good levels of folic acid may be related to lower risk of esophageal, stomach, and ovarian cancers, but the benefits of folic acid against cancer may depend on when it is taken and on individual conditions.

===Antifolates===
Folate is important for cells and tissues that rapidly divide.<ref name="Oldref_2"/> Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. The [[antifolate]] [[methotrexate]] is a drug often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form of THF from the inactive dihydrofolate (DHF). However, methotrexate can be toxic,<ref name="Oldref_46">{{cite journal | author=Rubio IT, Cao Y, Hutchins LF, Westbrook KC, Klimberg VS | title=Effect of glutamine on methotrexate efficacy and toxicity | journal=Annals of Surgery |volume=227 | issue=5 | year=1998 | pages=772–8 | pmid=9605669 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-199805000-00018 | pmc=1191365}}</ref><ref name="Oldref_47">{{cite journal | author=Wolff JE, Hauch H, Kuhl J, Egeler RM, Jurgens H | title=Dexamethasone increases hepatotoxicity of MTX in children with brain tumors | journal=Anticancer Research | volume=18 | issue=4B | year=1998 | pages=2895–9 | pmid=9713483}}</ref><ref name="Oldref_48">{{cite journal | author=Kepka L, De Lassence A, Ribrag V, Gachot B, Blot F, Theodore C, Bonnay M, Korenbaum C, Nitenberg G |title=Successful rescue in a patient with high dose methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity and acute renal failure | journal=Leukemia & Lymphoma |volume=29 | issue=1–2 | year=1998 | pages=205–9 | pmid=9638991 | doi = 10.3109/10428199809058397}}</ref>
producing side effects, such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make it difficult to eat normally. Also, bone marrow depression (inducing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), and acute renal and hepatic failure have been reported.

[[Folinic acid]], under the drug name [[leucovorin]], a form of folate (formyl-THF), can help "rescue" or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate.<ref name="Oldref_49">{{cite journal | author=Branda RF, Nigels E, Lafayette AR, Hacker M. | title=Nutritional folate status influences the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in rats | journal=Blood | volume=92 | issue=7 | year=1998 | pages=2471–6 | pmid=9746787}}</ref>
Folinic acid is ''not'' the same as folic acid.

There have been cases of severe adverse effects of accidental substitution of folic acid for folinic acid in patients receiving methotrexate cancer chemotherapy. It is important for anyone receiving methotrexate to follow medical advice on the use of folic or folinic acid supplements. The supplement of folinic acid in patients undergoing methotrexate treatment is to give cells dividing less rapidly enough folate to maintain normal cell functions. The amount of folate given will be depleted by rapidly dividing cells (cancer) very fast and so will not negate the effects of methotrexate.

===Psychological===

===Folic Acid, B<sub>12</sub> and Iron===

=== Malaria ===
Some studies show iron-folic acid supplementation in children under 5 may result in increased mortality due to [[malaria]]; this has prompted the World Health Organization to alter their iron-folic acid supplementation policies for children in malaria-prone areas, such as India.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pasricha S, Shet A, Sachdev HP, Shet AS  |title=Risks of routine iron and folic acid supplementation for young children |journal=Indian Pediatrics |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=857–66  |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19887691 |url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/oct2009/857.pdf}}</ref>

=== Aging ===
A study published in 2010 showed that folic acid has an effect on [[antiglycation]] in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', which affords the cultures protection against higher sugar levels that normally lead to the death of the culture. The same study also showed that too much folic acid is toxic to cells. Because of this, the authors theorized that folic acid could potentially have an effect on aging since glycation tends to increase with age.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pepper ED, Farrell MJ, Nord G, Finkel SE  |title=Antiglycation Effects of Carnosine and Other Compounds on the Long-Term Survival of Escherichia coli |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=76 |issue=24 |pages=7925–30  |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=20952637 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20952637}}</ref>

== Dietary reference intake ==
Because of the difference in bioavailability between supplemented folic acid and the different forms of folate found in food, the dietary folate equivalent (DFE) system was established. One DFE is defined as 1 μg (microgram) of dietary folate, or 0.6 μg of folic acid supplement.

The [[Dietary Reference Intake]] (DRIs) were developed by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] to set reference values for planning and assessing nutrient intake for healthy people.  DRIs incorporate two reference values, the [[Reference Daily Intake]] (RDI, the daily intake level that is adequate for 97–98% of the population in the United States where the standards were set) and [[tolerable upper intake levels]] (UL, the highest level of intake that is known to avoid toxicity).  The UL for folate refers to only synthetic folate, as no health risks have been associated with high intake of folate from food sources.<ref name="NIH-Gov"/>

Dr. Wills demonstrated anemia could be reversed with [[brewer's yeast]].

==Biological roles==
[[Image:Folat.svg|thumb|A diagram of the chemical structure of folate]]

===DNA and cell division===
Folate is necessary for the production and maintenance of new [[cell (biology)|cells]], for [[DNA replication|DNA synthesis]] and [[RNA synthesis]], and for preventing changes to [[DNA]], and, thus, for preventing [[cancer]].<ref name="Oldref_2">{{cite journal | author=Kamen B | title=Folate and antifolate pharmacology | journal=Seminars in oncology | volume=24 | issue=5 Suppl 18 | year=1997 | pages=S18–30–9 | pmid=9420019}}</ref> It is especially important during periods of frequent cell division and growth, such as infancy and pregnancy. Folate is needed to carry one-carbon groups for methylation reactions and [[nucleic acid]] synthesis (the most notable one being thymine, but also [[purine]] bases).<ref name="Figueiredo2009">{{cite journal | last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = JC | last2 = Grau | first2 = MV | last3 = Haile | first3 = RW | last4 = Sandler | first4 = RS | last5 = Summers | first5 = RW | last6 = Bresalier | first6 = RS | last7 = Burke | first7 = CA | last8 = McKeown-Eyssen | first8 = GE | last9 = Baron | first9 = JA | title = Folic Acid and Risk of Prostate Cancer: Results From a Randomized Clinical Trial | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 101 | issue = 6 | pages = 432–5 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19276452 | pmc = 2657096 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djp019 }}</ref> Thus, folate deficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division, affecting hematopoietic cells and neoplasms the most because of their greater frequency of cell division. RNA transcription, and subsequent protein synthesis, are less affected by folate deficiency, as the mRNA can be recycled and used again (as opposed to DNA synthesis, where a new genomic copy must be created). Since folate deficiency limits cell division, [[erythropoiesis]], production of [[red blood cell]]s, is hindered and leads to [[megaloblastic anemia]], which is characterized by large immature red blood cells. This pathology results from persistently thwarted attempts at normal DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell division, and produces abnormally large red cells called megaloblasts (and hypersegmented neutrophils) with abundant cytoplasm capable of RNA and protein synthesis, but with clumping and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin. Some of these large cells, although immature (reticulocytes), are released early from the marrow in an attempt to compensate for the [[anemia]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith C, Lieberman M, Marks DB, Marks AD  |title=Marks' essential medical biochemistry  |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD  |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-9340-8 }}</ref> Both adults and children need folate to make normal red and white blood cells and prevent [[anemia]].<ref name="Oldref_4">{{cite journal | author=Zittoun J | title=Anemias due to disorder of folate, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and transcobalamin metabolism | journal=La Revue du praticien | volume=43 | issue=11 | year=1993 | pages=1358–63 | pmid=8235383}} {{fr icon}}</ref> Deficiency of folate in pregnant women has been implicated in [[neural tube defects]] (NTD); therefore, many developed countries have implemented mandatory folic acid fortification in cereals, etc. NTDs occur early in pregnancy (first month), therefore women must have abundant folate upon conception.

===Biochemistry of DNA base and amino acid production===

[[Image:Folicacid-B12.png|thumb|Right|Metabolism of folic acid to produce methyl-vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]]

In the form of a series of [[tetrahydrofolate]] (THF) compounds, folate derivatives are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s in a number of single-carbon-transfer reactions, and also are involved in the synthesis of [[dTMP]] (2′-deoxythymidine-5′-phosphate) from [[dUMP]] (2′-deoxyuridine-5′-phosphate). It is a substrate for an important reaction that involves [[Vitamin B12|vitamin&nbsp;B<sub>12</sub>]] and it is necessary for the synthesis of DNA, and so required for all dividing cells.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/01443610701814195 | last1 = Goh | first1 = YI | last2 = Koren | first2 = G | year = 2008 | title = Folic acid in pregnancy and fetal outcomes | url = | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 3–13 | pmid = 18259891 }}</ref>

The pathway leading to the formation of [[tetrahydrofolate]] (FH<sub>4</sub>) begins when folic acid (F) is [[redox|reduced]] to [[dihydrofolate]] (DHF) (FH<sub>2</sub>), which is then reduced to THF. [[Dihydrofolate reductase]] catalyses the last step.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.expasy.org/enzyme/1.5.1.3 |title=EC 1.5.1.3 |publisher=Us.expasy.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> Vitamin B<sub>3</sub> in the form of [[NADPH]] is a necessary cofactor for both steps of the synthesis. Thus, hydride molecules are transferred from NADPH to the C6 position of the pteridine ring to reduce folic acid to THF.<ref>Benkovic, S. J. and S. Hammes-Schiffer. 2003. A perspective on enzyme catalysis. Rev. Sci. 301: 1196-2002.</ref>

[[Methylene-THF]] (CH<sub>2</sub>FH<sub>4</sub>) is formed from THF by the addition of a [[methylene bridge]] from one of three carbon donors: [[formate]], [[serine]], or [[glycine]]. [[Methyl tetrahydrofolate]] (CH<sub>3</sub>-THF, or methyl-THF) can be made from methylene-THF by reduction of the methylene group with NADPH. 

Another form of THF, 10-formyl-THF, results from [[oxidation]] of methylene-THF or is formed from formate donating formyl group to THF. Also, histidine can donate a single carbon to THF to form methenyl-THF.

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is the only acceptor of methyl-THF, and this reaction produces methyl-B<sub>12</sub> ([[methylcobalamin]]). There is also only one acceptor for methyl-B<sub>12</sub>, homocysteine, in a reaction catalyzed by [[homocysteine methyltransferase]]. These reactions are of importance because a defect in homocysteine methyltransferase or a deficiency of B<sub>12</sub> may lead to a so-called "methyl-trap" of THF, in which THF is converted to a reservoir of methyl-THF which thereafter has no way of being metabolized, and serves as a sink of THF that causes a subsequent deficiency in folate.<ref name="Hoffbrand AV 2001"/> Thus, a deficiency in B<sub>12</sub> can generate a large pool of methyl-THF that is unable to undergo reactions and will mimic folate deficiency. 

The reactions that lead to the methyl-THF reservoir can be shown in chain form:
: folate → dihydrofolate → tetrahydrofolate ↔ methylene-THF → methyl-THF
[[File:Folate metabolism.svg|thumb|Folate metabolism]]

===Conversion to biologically active derivatives===

All the biological functions of folic acid are performed by [[tetrahydrofolate]] and other derivatives. Their biological availability to the body depends upon [[dihydrofolate reductase]] action in the liver. This action is unusually slow in humans, being less than 2% of that in rats. Moreover, in contrast to rats, an almost-5-fold variation in the activity of this enzyme exists between humans.<ref name="Bailey"/> Due to this low activity, it has been suggested this limits the conversion of folic acid into its biologically active forms "when folic acid is consumed at levels higher than the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (1 mg/d for adults)."<ref name="Bailey"/>

====Overview of drugs that interfere with folate reactions====
A number of drugs interfere with the biosynthesis of folic acid and THF. Among them are the [[:Category:Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors|dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors]] such as [[trimethoprim]], [[pyrimethamine]], and [[methotrexate]]; the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s (competitive inhibitors of [[4-aminobenzoic acid]] in the reactions of [[dihydropteroate synthetase]]).

[[Valproic acid]], one of the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants that is also used to treat certain psychological conditions, is a known inhibitor of folic acid, and as such, has been shown to cause [[neural tube defects]] and cases of [[spina bifida]] and cognitive impairment in the newborn. Because of this considerable risk, those mothers who must continue to use valproic acid or its derivatives during pregnancy to control their condition (as opposed to stopping the drug or switching to another drug or to a lesser dose) should take folic acid supplements under the direction and guidance of their health care providers.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III 1988–91) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–96 CSFII) indicated most adults did not consume adequate folate.<!--

==Dietary fortification==
[[Image:GrainProducts.jpg|right|thumb|In the USA many grain products are fortified with folic acid.]]
{{See also|Food fortification}}
''Folic acid fortification'' is a process in which where folic acid is added to flour with the intention of promoting a public health through increasing blood folate levels in the public.  In the USA, food is fortified with folic acid, only one of the many naturally-occurring forms of folate, and a substance contributing only a minor amount to the folates in natural foods.<ref name="adavidsmith">[http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/3.full A. David Smith, "Folic acid fortification: the good, the bad, and the puzzle of vitamin", ''American Society for Clinical Nutrition'', Vol. 85, No. 1, 3-5. January 2007.]</ref>

Since the discovery of the link between insufficient folic acid and [[neural tube defects]], governments and health organizations worldwide have made recommendations concerning folic acid ''[[dietary supplement|supplementation]]'' for women intending to become [[Pregnancy|pregnant]].

Fortification is controversial, with issues having been raised concerning individual liberty,<ref name="adavidsmith" /> as well as the health concerns described in the [[#Toxicity|Toxicity]] section above.  In the USA, there is concern that the federal government mandates fortification, but does not provide any monitoring of any potential undesirable effects of fortification.<ref name="adavidsmith" />

Currently, more than 60 countries practice mandatory folic acid fortification of flour. Most countries on the American continent, Africa and the Middle East currently have mandatory folic acid fortification programs.<ref>FFI (Flour Fortification Initiative) http://www.sph.emory.edu/

Folic acid [[food fortification]] became mandatory in [[Canada]] in 1998, with the fortification of 150&nbsp;µg of folic acid per 100&nbsp;grams of [[enriched flour]] and uncooked [[cereal]] grains.<ref name="Mason">{{cite journal |last1=Mason |doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0329 |first1=J.

====Supplementation promotion====
According to a Canadian survey, 58% of women said they took a folic acid containing multivitamin or a folic acid supplement as early as three months before becoming pregnant.  Women in higher income households and with more years of school education are using more folic acid supplements before pregnancy.  Women with planned pregnancies and who are over the age of 25 are more likely to use folic acid supplement. Canadian public health efforts are focused on promoting awareness of the importance of folic acid supplementation for all women of childbearing age and decreasing socio-economic inequalities by providing practical folic acid support to vulnerable groups of women.<ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"/>

The [[Food Standards Agency]] has recommended fortification,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2007/may/folatefort  |title=Board recommends mandatory fortification |accessdate=2007-05-18 |author=FSA |date=2007-05-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6665109.stm  |title=Backing for folic acid in bread |accessdate=2007-05-18 | work=BBC News | date=17 May 2007}}</ref><ref>BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6648059.stm Experts back folic acid in flour] 11 May 2007</ref> but there is still no mandatory flour fortification with folic acid although voluntary fortification is allowed.

===United States===
The [[United States Public Health Service]] recommends an extra 0.4&nbsp;mg/day for newly pregnant women, which can be taken as a pill. However, many researchers believe supplementation in this way can never work effectively enough, since about half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, and not all women will comply with the recommendation. Approximately 53% of the US population uses dietary supplements and 35% uses dietary supplements containing folic acid.<ref name="Bailey RL 2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = RL | last2 = Dodd | first2 = KW | last3 = Gahche | first3 = JJ | last4 = Dwyer | first4 = JT | last5 = McDowell | first5 = MA | last6 = Yetley | first6 = EA | last7 = Sempos | first7 = CA | last8 = Burt | first8 = VL | last9 = Radimer | first9 = KL | title = Total folate and folic acid intake from foods and dietary supplements in the United States: 2003–2006 | journal = The American journal of clinical nutrition | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 231–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19923379 | pmc = 2793110 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28427 }}</ref> Men consume more folate (in dietary folate equivalents) than women, and non-Hispanic whites have higher folate intakes than Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks.<ref name="Bailey RL 2006"/> Twenty nine percent of black women have inadequate intakes of folate.<ref name="Bailey RL 2006"/> The age group consuming the most folate and folic acid is the >50 group.<ref name="Bailey RL 2006"/> 5% of the population exceeds the Tolerable Upper Intake Level.<ref name="Bailey RL 2006"/>

In 1996, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) published regulations requiring the addition of folic acid to enriched breads, cereals, flours, corn meals, pastas, rice, and other grain products.<ref name="Oldref_7">{{cite journal | author=Malinow MR, Duell PB, Hess DL, Anderson PH, Kruger WD, Phillipson BE, Gluckman RA, Block PC, Upson BM | title=Reduction of plasma homocyst(e)ine levels by breakfast cereal fortified with folic acid in patients with coronary heart disease | journal= New England Journal of Medicine | volume=338 | issue=15 | year=1998 | pages=1009–15 | pmid=9535664 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199804093381501}}</ref><ref name="Oldref_8">{{cite journal | author=Daly S, Mills JL, Molloy AM, Conley M, Lee YJ, Kirke PN, Weir DG, Scott JM | title=Minimum effective dose of folic acid for food fortification to prevent neural-tube defects | journal=Lancet | volume=350 | issue=9092 | year=1997 | pages=1666–9 | pmid=9400511 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)07247-4}}</ref>

As a result of the folic acid fortification program, fortified foods have become a major source of folic acid in the American diet. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] used data from 23 birth defect registries covering about half of United States births, and extrapolated their findings to the rest of the country.  These data indicate since the addition of folic acid in grain-based foods as mandated by the FDA, the rate of neural tube defects dropped by 25% in the United States.<ref name="Oldref_57">{{cite journal | author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title=Spina bifida and anencephaly before and after folic acid mandate—United States, 1995–1996 and 1999–2000 | journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume=53 | issue=17 | year=2004 | pages=362–5 | pmid=15129193}}</ref> The results of folic acid fortification on the rate of neural tube defects in [[Canada]] have also been positive, showing a 46% reduction in prevalence of NTDs;<ref>{{cite journal| author=De Wals P, Tairou F, Van Allen MI, Uh SH, Lowry RB, Sibbald B, Evans JA, Van den Hof MC, Zimmer P, Crowley M, Fernandez B, Lee NS &amp; Niyonsenga T |year=2007 |title=Reduction in neural-tube defects after folic acid fortification in Canada|journal=N Engl J Med| pmid=17625125|volume=357| issue=2|pages=135–142| doi=10.1056/NEJMoa067103}}</ref> the magnitude of reduction was proportional to the prefortification rate of NTDs, essentially removing geographical variations in rates of NTDs seen in [[Canada]] before fortification.

When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the folic acid fortification regulation in 1996, the projected increase in folic acid intake was 100&nbsp;µg/d.<ref name="Choumenkovitch SF 2798">{{cite journal |last1 = Choumenkovitch |first1 = SF |last2 = Selhub |first2 = J |last3 = Wilson |first3 = PW |last4 = Rader |first4 = JI |last5 = Rosenberg |first5 = IH |last6 = Jacques |first6 = PF |title = Folic acid intake from fortification in United States exceeds predictions |journal = The Journal of nutrition |volume = 132 |issue = 9 |pages = 2792–8 |year = 2002 |pmid = 12221247 }}</ref> Data from a study with 1480 subjects showed that folic acid intake increased by 190&nbsp;µg/d and total folate intake increased by 323&nbsp;µg dietary folate equivalents (DFE)/d.<ref name="Choumenkovitch SF 2798"/> Folic acid intake above the upper tolerable intake level (1000&nbsp;µg folic acid/d) increased only among those individuals consuming folic acid supplements as well as folic acid found in fortified grain products.<ref name="Choumenkovitch SF 2798"/> Taken together, folic acid fortification has led to a bigger increase in folic acid intake than first projected.<ref name="Choumenkovitch SF 2798"/>
