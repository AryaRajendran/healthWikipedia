The '''Tyler Foundation''' is a charitable organization located in [[Tokyo]], Japan, which offers [[psychosocial]] support to  children with [[cancer]] in Japan and their families.

==Background==
The Tyler Foundation is incorporated in Japan as a non-profit organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japaninc.com/tt392 |title=TT-392 -- Leukemia, ebiz news from Japan |publisher=Japan Inc |date=24 September 2006 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>  Founded in 2006 by Mark Ferris, and Kimberly Forsythe, the organization was dedicated in memory of their son, Tyler, who was diagnosed with infant [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] before he was one month old.<ref name="d1">{{cite web|url=http://bccjacumen.com/features/csr/2010/11/bring-on-bailey/ |title=Bring on Bailey!

Born in 2003,<ref name="intouch" /> Tyler died after almost two years of treatment at the National Center for Child Health and Development in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]] <ref name="tt616">{{cite web|url=http://www.japaninc.com/tt616_believers-in-the-Japanese-health-system |title=TT-616 -- Believers in Japan's Health System, e-biz news from Japan |publisher=Japan Inc |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref> in June 2005.<ref name="news3">{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20060902a1.html |title=Tyler Foundation helps other sick kids shine on |publisher=Japan Times |date=2 September 2006 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="news4">{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20071013a1.html |title=Shining on after the darkness of death |publisher=Japan Times |date=13 October 2007 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> The high standard of medical care they experienced contrasted with the lack of [[psychosocial]] support offered to families and children with [[cancer]] in Japan. Tyler's parents created the foundation to help patients and families in Japan going through the challenge of fighting childhood cancer.

===Mission===
The organization's mission is to improve quality of life during treatment and ensure a smooth and successful transition to normal life after treatment.<ref name="d1"/> The foundation's aim is to fundamentally change the way patients’ care is administered throughout Japan in the pediatric [[oncology]] wards.<ref name="intouch">{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/intouch_magazine/docs/august_2010/search?q=tyler |title=Turning Grief Into Hope |publisher=TAC InTouch Magazine |date=August 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref> They concentrate on patient and parent support such as an on-staff psychologist, support groups and childcare for siblings.<ref name="intouch" />

===Projects===
In the spring of 2007, the Tyler Foundation launched its counseling and support program, providing a clinical psychologist to the pediatric cancer ward of the National Center for Child Health and Development.<ref name="intouch" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/ipad-storybook-supports-families-children-cancer-080415400.html |title=New iPad Storybook Supports Families of Children with Cancer |publisher=Yahoo News |date=Feb 1, 2012 |accessdate=29 Feb 2012}}</ref>

In April, 2009, the Tyler Foundation opened its Shine On! House, which provides overnight accommodation for families, childcare for siblings of patients and a place for families to relax.<ref>「走って小児がん家族支援」（2月21日　共同ニュース） “Running to Support Families Facing Pediatric Cancer”. [[Kyodo News]]</ref> The Tyler Foundation is the sole representative of the US-based Beads of Courage program in Japan. Patients receive a colorful bead corresponding to each aspect of cancer treatment -  for example, surgery, radiation, blood tests, etc. The beads serve as symbols of courage to commemorate milestones the children achieved along their individual treatment path.<ref>「子どもの闘病励ますビーズ」（1月23日　朝日新聞）“Beads Encourage Children with Serious Illness”, [[Asahi Shinbun]]. 23 January 2011.</ref> Introduced to Japan by the foundation in 2010, the Beads of Courage Program is said to decrease illness-related distress; increase the use of positive [[coping strategies]]; enable children to find meaning in illness, and restore a sense of self in children coping with serious illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wifm-mag.com/2010/11/for-kids-with-cancer/ |title=For Kids With Cancer |publisher=WIFM |date=November 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

In addition, the foundation launched its Shine On! Therapy Dog program in 2010, placing Japan's first full-time [[therapy dog]] at [[Shizuoka City|Shizuoka]] Children’s Hospital. Bailey, a golden retriever, was trained for two years at Hawaii Canines for Independence in Maui, Hawaii. The dog goes bedside to give children courage and accompanies them during medical procedures.<ref name="d1" /><ref>“Ready to Serve”.

Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the Tyler Foundation decided to offer its expertise to those affected by the earthquake and tsunami. The foundation's Shine On! "Smile Ambassador", Guy Totaro, travels to schools in the affected areas getting the kids to smile as a way of relieving stress.<ref name="scrum">{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/T110705005073.htm |title=SCRUM DOWN / Talking the talk for charity |publisher=Daily Yomiuri |date=6 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

The foundation also created a musical project called “Shine On! Songs” as a way of raising funds.<ref>“’Ame Ni Mo Makezu’ With Strength”. Tohkai Shimpo. 24 August 2011.</ref> Students at Sakari Elementary School in Ofunato City participated in the chorus of one of the songs on the CD "Who I Want to Be". The song is based on an English version of [[Miyazawa Kenji]]'s famous poem ''Ame Ni Mo Makezu''. Recording artist [[Rie fu]], who sang the song, visited Sakari Elementary school to share in the happiness of completing the song.<ref>“Sakari Elementary School’s Chorus on CD”.
