'''Exercise prescription''' is the referral of patients to exercise programmes.  The term is also used to describe the development of exercise programs.
== Patient Referral ==

In the United Kingdom there is a scheme called "Exercise on prescription" in which doctors are able to prescribe exercise to those with conditions that benefit from it, such as [[asthma]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[obesity]].  The initiative particularly aimed to lower the rate of [[heart disease]].  National standards for such initiatives from doctors were established by the [[Department of Health]] in 2001.  Exercise on prescription aims to prevent deterioration of conditions, and views exercise as a preventative health measure.  Fitness classes or a course at the local gym are available on prescription at a reduced rate to people who might benefit from them.  It aims to make it easier for people to follow their doctors' advice about taking more exercise or losing weight.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1261950.stm Exercise on prescription (BBC)</ref>  Such preventative measures hope to lead to savings for the National Health Service.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article1031314.ece] Exercise on prescription (Times)</ref>
 
Researchers in New Zealand have also discussed the benefits of exercise referral by medical practitioners there.<ref>http://www.hi-mag.com/healthinsurance/article.do?articleid=20001764961 Analysis: Workplace Wellbeing</ref>  In New Zealand it is known as a [[green prescription]], while in the United States a similar initiative is known as [[Exercise is Medicine]].

== Exercise Program Development ==


Exercise prescription is designed to modulate acute exercise programming variables to create the adaptations desired by the individual or sport.  With [[aerobic exercise]] prescription, the type of exercise, duration of exercise, frequency, and duration is adjusted.  For [[resistance exercise]] prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined.  <ref>Kraemer, WJ.
