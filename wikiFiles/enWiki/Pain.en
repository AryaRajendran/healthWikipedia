'''Pain''' is an unpleasant feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, and bumping the "[[ulnar nerve|funny bone]]."<ref>The examples represent respectively the three classes of [[#Nociceptive|nociceptive pain]] - mechanical, thermal and chemical - and [[#Neuropathic|neuropathic pain]].</ref> The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage".<ref name = "IASPdef"/>

==Classification==
In 1994, responding to the need for a more useful system for describing chronic pain, the [[International Association for the Study of Pain]] (IASP) classified pain according to specific characteristics: (1) region of the body involved (e.g. abdomen, lower limbs), (2) system whose dysfunction may be causing the pain (e.g., nervous, gastrointestinal), (3) duration and pattern of occurrence, (4) intensity and time since onset, and (5) [[etiology]].<ref name= Merskey_Bogduk>{{vcite book| author = Merskey H & Bogduk N |title = Classification of Chronic Pain | edition = 2 | location = Seattle | publisher = International Association for the Study of Pain | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-931092-05-1 | pages = 3 & 4}}</ref> This system has been criticized by [[Clifford J.

===Duration===
{{main|Chronic pain}}
Pain is usually transitory, lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed, but some painful conditions, such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Cancer pain|cancer]] and [[idiopathic]] pain, may persist for years. Pain that lasts a long time is called ''[[Chronic pain|chronic]]'', and pain that resolves quickly is called ''[[Acute (medicine)|acute]]''. Traditionally, the distinction between ''acute'' and ''chronic'' pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain,<ref name = Turk&Okifuji2001>{{vcite book | author = Turk DC, Okifuji A | authorlink = | editor = Bonica JJ, Loeser JD, Chapman CR, Turk DC, Butler SH | others = | title = Bonica's management of pain | edition = | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Hagerstwon, MD | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-683-30462-3 | chapter = Pain terms and taxonomies of pain }}</ref> though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months.<ref name="isbn0-443-05683-8">{{vcite book | author = Spanswick CC, Main CJ | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Pain management: an interdisciplinary approach | edition = | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | location = Edinburgh | year = 2000 | pages = 93 | isbn = 0-443-05683-8 | chapter = | chapterurl = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=wcEQPzTOEAoC&pg=PA93&#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate = }}</ref> Others apply ''acute'' to pain that lasts less than 30 days, ''chronic'' to pain of more than six months duration, and ''subacute'' to pain that lasts from one to six months.<ref name=Thienhaus1>{{vcite book | author = Thienhaus O, Cole BE | authorlink = | editor = Weiner R | others = | title = Pain management: a practical guide for clinicians | edition = | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 2002 | pages = 28 | isbn = 0-8493-0926-3 | chapter = Classification of pain | doi = | url =}}</ref>  A popular alternative definition of ''chronic pain'', involving no arbitrarily fixed durations is "pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing."<ref name = Turk&Okifuji2001/> Chronic pain may be classified as [[cancer pain]] or benign.<ref name=Thienhaus1/>

===Nociceptive===
{{Main|Nociception}}
Nociceptive pain is caused by stimulation of [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerve fibers]] that respond only to stimuli approaching or exceeding harmful intensity ([[nociceptors]]), and may be classified according to the mode of noxious stimulation; the most common categories being "thermal" (heat or cold), "mechanical" (crushing, tearing, etc.) and "chemical" (iodine in a cut, chili powder in the eyes).

Nociceptive pain may also be divided into "visceral," "deep somatic" and "superficial somatic" pain. [[Viscus|Visceral structures]] are highly sensitive to stretch, [[ischemia]] and [[inflammation]], but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures, such as burning and cutting. [[Visceral pain]] is diffuse, difficult to locate and often [[referred pain|referred]] to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull.<ref name = Urch>{{vcite book | author = Urch CE & Suzuki R | chapter = Pathophysiology of somatic, visceral, and neuropathic cancer pain | editor = Sykes N, Bennett MI & Yuan C-S | title = Clinical pain management: Cancer pain | edition = 2 | isbn = 978-0-340-94007-5 | publisher = Hodder Arnold | location = London | pages = 3–12 }}</ref> ''Deep somatic'' pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, [[fasciae]] and muscles, and is dull, aching, poorly localized pain. Examples include [[sprain]]s and broken bones. ''Superficial'' pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue, and is sharp, well-defined and clearly located. Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor (first degree) burns.<ref name="isbn0-443-05683-8">{{vcite book | author = Coda BA, Bonica JJ | authorlink = | editor = Spanswick CC, Main CJ | others = | title = Pain management: an interdisciplinary approach | edition = | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | location = Edinburgh | year = 2000 | pages = | isbn = 0-443-05683-8 | chapter = General considerations of acute pain | doi = | url =}}</ref>

===Neuropathic===
{{Main|Neuropathic pain}}
Neuropathic pain is caused by damage or disease affecting any part of the nervous system involved in bodily feelings (the [[somatosensory system]]).<ref name= Treede2008>{{vcite journal | author = Treede RD, Jensen TS, Campbell JN, Cruccu G, Dostrovsky JO, Griffin JW, Hansson P, Hughes R, Nurmikko T, Serra J | title = Neuropathic pain: redefinition and a grading system for clinical and research purposes | journal = Neurology | volume = 70 | issue = 18 | pages = 1630–5 | year = 2008 | month = April | pmid = 18003941 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000282763.29778.59 | url = https://www.fpa-support.org/learning/Articles/2008/documents/Treed2008NeuropathicpainredefintionandgradingNeurology.pdf | issn = }}</ref> Peripheral neuropathic pain is often described as "burning," "tingling," "electrical," "stabbing," or "pins and needles."<ref name= Paice2003>{{vcite journal | author = Paice JA | title = Mechanisms and management of neuropathic pain in cancer | journal = J.

===Phantom===
{{Main|Phantom pain}}
[[Phantom pain]] is pain felt in a part of the body that has been lost or from which the brain no longer receives signals. It is a type of neuropathic pain. [[Phantom limb pain]] is a common experience of [[amputee]]s.<ref name="pmid10863043">{{vcite journal | author = Kooijman CM, Dijkstra PU, Geertzen JH, Elzinga A, van der Schans CP | title = Phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees: an epidemiological study | journal = Pain | volume = 87 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–41 | year = 2000 | month = July | pmid = 10863043 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(00)00264-5 | url = | issn = }}</ref>

The [[prevalence]] of phantom pain in upper limb amputees is nearly 82%, and in lower limb amputees is 54%.<ref name="pmid10863043"/> One study found that eight days after amputation, 72 percent of patients had phantom limb pain, and six months later, 65 percent reported it.<ref name="pmid6657285">{{vcite journal | author = Jensen TS, Krebs B, Nielsen J, Rasmussen P | title = Phantom limb, phantom pain and stump pain in amputees during the first 6 months following limb amputation | journal = Pain | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 243–56 | year = 1983 | month = November | pmid = 6657285 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3959(83)90097-0 | url = | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid3991231">{{vcite journal | author = Jensen TS, Krebs B, Nielsen J, Rasmussen P | title = Immediate and long-term phantom limb pain in amputees: incidence, clinical characteristics and relationship to pre-amputation limb pain | journal = Pain | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–78 | year = 1985 | month = March | pmid = 3991231 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3959(85)90090-9 | url = | issn = }}</ref> Some amputees experience continuous pain that varies in intensity or quality; others experience several bouts a day, or it may occur only once every week or two. It is often described as shooting, crushing, burning or cramping.

Local anesthetic injections into the nerves or sensitive areas of the stump may relieve pain for days, weeks or, sometimes permanently, despite the drug wearing off in a matter of hours; and small injections of [[:wikt:hypertonic|hypertonic]] saline into the soft tissue between vertebrae produces local pain that radiates into the phantom limb for ten minutes or so and may be followed by hours, weeks or even longer of partial or total relief from phantom pain. Vigorous vibration or electrical stimulation of the stump, or current from electrodes surgically implanted onto the spinal cord all produce relief in some patients.<ref name = "Melzack&Wall61–69"/>

Work by [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] using [[mirror box]] therapy allows for illusions of movement and touch in a phantom limb which in turn cause a reduction in pain.<ref name="pmid8637922">{{vcite journal | author = Ramachandran VS, Rogers-Ramachandran D | title = Synaesthesia in phantom limbs induced with mirrors | journal = Proc.

[[Paraplegia]], the loss of sensation and voluntary motor control after serious spinal cord damage, may be accompanied by [[girdle pain]] at the level of the spinal cord damage, [[visceral pain]] evoked by a filling bladder or bowel, or, in five to ten per cent of paraplegics, phantom body pain in areas of complete sensory loss. This phantom body pain is initially described as burning or tingling but may evolve into severe crushing or pinching pain, fire running down the legs, or a knife twisting in the flesh. Onset may be immediate or may not occur until years after the disabling injury. Surgical treatment rarely provides lasting relief.<ref name = "Melzack&Wall61–69"/>

===Psychogenic===
{{Main|Psychogenic pain}}
Psychogenic pain, also called ''psychalgia'' or ''somatoform pain'', is pain caused, increased, or prolonged by mental, emotional, or behavioral factors.<ref>[http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/Pain_Management/hic_Psychogenic_Pain.aspx Cleveland Clinic, Health information]

However, specialists consider that it is no less actual or hurtful than pain from any other source.<ref name=IASP_definitions>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080512061229/http%3A//www.iasp-pain.org/AM/Template.cfm%3FSection%3DGeneral_Resource_Links%26Template%3D/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm%26ContentID%3D3058#Pain "International Association for the Study of Pain | Pain Definitions".].

People with long term pain frequently display psychological disturbance, with elevated scores on the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] scales of [[hysteria]], [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[hypochondriasis]] (the "[[neurotic triad]]"). Some investigators have argued that it is this neuroticism that causes acute injuries to turn chronic, but clinical evidence points the other way, to chronic pain causing [[neuroticism]]. When long term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention, scores on the neurotic triad and [[anxiety]] fall, often to normal levels. Self-esteem, often low in chronic pain patients, also shows improvement once pain has resolved.<ref name=Melzack_Wall_1996_31-32>{{vcite book | author = Wall PD, Melzack R | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The challenge of pain | edition = | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 1996 | pages = | isbn = 0-14-025670-9 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref>

{{quote|"The term 'psychogenic' assumes that medical diagnosis is so perfect that all organic causes of pain can be detected; regrettably, we are far from such infallibility... All too often, the diagnosis of neurosis as the cause of pain hides our ignorance of many aspects of pain medicine."| [[Ronald Melzack]], 1996.<ref name=Melzack_Wall_1996_31-32/>}}

===Breakthrough pain===
Breakthrough pain is pain that comes on suddenly for short periods of time {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and is not alleviated by the patients' normal pain management. It is common in [[cancer]] patients who often have a background level of pain controlled by [[medication]]s, but whose pain periodically "breaks through" the medication. The characteristics of breakthrough [[cancer pain]] vary from person to person and according to the cause.

===Incident pain===
Incident pain is pain that arises as a result of activity, such as movement of an arthritic joint, stretching a wound, etc.

===Pain asymbolia and insensitivity===
{{Main|Pain asymbolia|Congenital insensitivity to pain}}

The ability to experience pain is essential for protection from injury, and recognition of the presence of injury. Episodic analgesia may occur under special circumstances, such as in the excitement of sport or war: a soldier on the battlefield may feel no pain for many hours from a traumatic amputation or other severe injury.<ref>Beecher, HK (1959).

Before the relatively recent discovery of [[neuron]]s and their role in pain, various different body functions were proposed to account for pain.

In 1644, René Descartes theorized that pain was a disturbance that passed down along nerve fibers until the disturbance reached the brain,<ref name=Linton /><ref name=MelzackKatz>{{vcite book | author = Melzack R, Katz J | authorlink = | editor = Craig KD, Hadjistavropoulos T | others = | title = Pain: psychological perspectives | edition = | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers | location = Mahwah, N.J | year = 2004 | chapter = The Gate Control Theory: Reaching for the Brain | pages = | isbn = 0-8058-4299-3 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref> a development that transformed the perception of pain from a spiritual, mystical experience to a physical, mechanical sensation. Descartes's work, along with Avicenna's, prefigured the 19th-century development of specificity theory. Specificity theory saw pain as "a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses".<ref name = Bonica1>{{vcite book | author = Bonica JJ | chapter = History of pain concepts and therapies | title = The management of pain | volume = 1 | edition = 2 | year = 1990 | publisher = Lea & Febiger | location = London | page = 7}}</ref> Another theory that came to prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries was intensive theory, which conceived of pain not as a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature.<ref name = Finger>{{vcite book | author = Finger S | title = Origins of neuroscience: a history of explorations into brain function | page 149 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-514694-8 | year = 2001 | location = USA }}</ref> By the mid-1890s, specificity was backed mostly by physiologists and physicians, and the intensive theory was mostly backed by psychologists. However, after a series of clinical observations by [[Henry Head]] and experiments by [[Max von Frey]], the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact.<ref name = Dallenbach/><ref name = Bonica1/>

In 1955, DC Sinclair and G Weddell developed "peripheral pattern theory", based on a 1934 suggestion by [[John Paul Nafe]]. They proposed that all skin fiber endings (with the exception of those innervating hair cells) are identical, and that pain is produced by intense stimulation of these fibers.<ref name = Bonica1/> Another 20th-century theory was "gate control" theory, introduced by [[Ronald Melzack]] and [[Patrick David Wall|Patrick Wall]] in the 1965 [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] article "Pain Mechanisms: A New Theory".<ref name="pmid5320816">{{vcite journal | author = [[Ronald Melzack|Melzack R]], [[Patrick David Wall|Wall PD]] | title = Pain mechanisms: a new theory | journal = Science | volume = 150 | issue = 3699 | pages = 971–9 | year = 1965 | month = November | pmid = 5320816 | doi = 10.1126/science.150.3699.971| url = http://www.hnehealth.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/70122/pain_mechanisms_20100315013844.pdf | issn = }}</ref> The authors proposed that both thin (pain) and large diameter (touch, pressure, vibration) nerve fibers carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the [[posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]] of the spinal cord, and that the more large fiber activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitory cell, the less pain is felt.<ref name="MelzackKatz"/> Both peripheral pattern theory and gate control theory have been superseded by more modern theories of pain.

===Three dimensions of pain===
In 1968 Ronald Melzack and [[Kenneth L. Casey|Kenneth Casey]] described pain in terms of its three dimensions: "sensory-discriminative" (sense of the intensity, location, quality and duration of the pain), "affective-motivational" (unpleasantness and urge to escape the unpleasantness), and "cognitive-evaluative" (cognitions such as appraisal, cultural values, distraction and hypnotic suggestion).<ref name="Melzack_1968"/> They theorized that pain intensity (the sensory discriminative dimension) and unpleasantness (the affective-motivational dimension) are not simply determined by the magnitude of the painful stimulus, but "higher" cognitive activities can influence perceived intensity and unpleasantness. Cognitive activities "may affect both sensory and affective experience or they may modify primarily the affective-motivational dimension. Thus, excitement in games or war appears to block both dimensions of pain, while suggestion and placebos may modulate the affective-motivational dimension and leave the sensory-discriminative dimension relatively undisturbed." (p.&nbsp;432) The paper ends with a call to action: "Pain can be treated not only by trying to cut down the sensory input by anesthetic block, surgical intervention and the like, but also by influencing the motivational-affective and cognitive factors as well." (p.&nbsp;435)

===Theory today===
[[File:Schematic of cortical areas involved with pain processing and fMRI.jpg|thumb|right|Regions of the cerebral cortex associated with pain.]]Wilhelm Erb's (1874) "intensive" theory, that a pain signal can be generated by intense enough stimulation of ''any'' sensory receptor, has been soundly disproved. Some sensory fibers do not differentiate between noxious and non-noxious stimuli, while others, [[nociceptors]], respond only to noxious, high intensity stimuli. At the peripheral end of the nociceptor, noxious stimuli are [[Transduction|transduced]] into currents that, above a given threshold, begin to generate [[action potential]]s that travel along the nerve fiber to the spinal cord. The "specificity" (whether it responds to thermal, chemical or mechanical features of its environment) of a nociceptor is determined by which [[ion channel]]s it expresses at its peripheral end. Dozens of nociceptor [[Transient receptor potential channel|transient receptor potential]], [[Acid-sensing ion channel|acid sensing]], [[Potassium channel|potassium]] and [[Ligand-gated ion channel|ligand-gated]] ion channels have so far been identified, and their exact functions are still being determined.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Woolf CJ, Ma Q |title=Nociceptors--noxious stimulus detectors |journal=Neuron |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=353–64 |year=2007 |month=August |pmid=17678850 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.07.016 |url=}}</ref>

The pain signal travels from the periphery to the spinal cord along an [[A delta fiber|A-delta]] or [[C fiber|C]] fiber. Because the A-delta fiber is thicker than the C fiber, and is thinly sheathed in an electrically insulating material ([[myelin]]), it carries its signal faster (5–30&nbsp;[[m/s]]) than the unmyelinated C fiber (0.5–2&nbsp;m/s).<ref name=Marchand>{{vcite book | author = Marchand S | authorlink = | editor = Beaulieu P, Lussier D, Porreca F & Dickenson A| others = | title = Pharmacology of pain | chapter = Applied pain neurophysiology | publisher = International Association for the Study of Pain Press | location = Seattle | year = 2010 | pages = 3–26 | isbn = 978-0-931092-78-7 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref> Pain evoked by the (faster) A-delta fibers is described as sharp and is felt first.

A-delta and C fibers synapse on second order neurons in [[Central gelatinous substance of spinal cord|substantia gelatinosa]] (laminae II and III of the dorsal horns). These second order fibers then cross the cord via the [[anterior white commissure]] and ascend in the [[spinothalamic tract]]. Before reaching the brain, the spinothalamic tract splits into the lateral [[neospinothalamic tract]] and the medial [[paleospinothalamic tract]].<ref name=Skevington1995>{{cite book |last=Skevington |first=S.

Second order neospinothalamic tract neurons carry information from A-delta fibers and terminate at the [[ventral posterolateral nucleus]] of the [[thalamus]], where they synapse on third order neurons (dendrites of the [[somatosensory cortex]]). Paleospinothalamic neurons carry information from C fibers and terminate throughout the [[brain stem]], a tenth of them in the [[thalamus]] and the rest in the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]], [[pons]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Zqzzi81MgKQJ:joson.rey.tripod.com/skinsofttissues/painpathway.rtf+slow+pain+Paleospinothalamic+aching,+throbbing+or+burning+pain&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a |title=Pain Pathway |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref>

Spinal cord fibers dedicated to carrying A-delta fiber pain signals, and others that carry both A-delta and C fiber pain signals up the spinal cord to the [[thalamus]] in the brain have been identified.

A. D. (Bud) Craig and [[Derek Denton]] include pain in a class of feelings they name, respectively, "[[Human homeostasis|homeostatic]]" or "primordial" emotions. These are feelings such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, evoked by internal body states, communicated to the central nervous system by [[interoceptors]], which motivate behavior aimed at maintaining the internal milieu at its ideal state. Craig and Denton distinguish these feelings from the "classical emotions" such as love, fear and anger, which are elicited by environmental stimuli sensed through the nose, eyes and ears.<ref name="Denton2006p10">{{vcite book |author=Derek A.

===Evolutionary and behavioral role===
Pain is part of the body's defense system, producing a [[Nervous system#Reflexes and other stimulus-response circuits|reflexive]] retraction from the painful stimulus, and tendencies to protect the affected body part while it heals, and avoid that harmful situation in the future.<ref name= Lynn1984/><ref name= Bernston2008>{{vcite book | author = Bernston GG, Cacioppo JT | authorlink = | editor = Gardner WL, Shah JY | others = | title = Handbook of Motivation Science | edition = | publisher = The Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2007 | page = 191 | isbn = 1-59385-568-0 | oclc = | chapter = The neuroevolution of motivation | chapterurl = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=iCxpZkZtDG8C&pg=PT209&dq=%22One+general+class+of+spinal+reflexes+consists+of+the+flexor+(pain)+withdrawal%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22One%20general%20class%20of%20spinal%20reflexes%20consists%20of%20the%20flexor%20(pain)%20withdrawal%22&f=true | accessdate = }}</ref> It&nbsp;is&nbsp;an important part of animal life, vital to healthy survival. People with [[congenital insensitivity to pain]] have reduced [[life expectancy]].<ref name="pmid12583863"/>

In his book, ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]'', biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] grapples with the question of why pain has to be so very painful. He describes the alternative as a simple, mental raising of a "red flag". To argue why that red flag might be insufficient, Dawkins explains that drives must compete with each other within living beings. The most fit creature would be the one whose pains are well balanced. Those pains which mean certain death when ignored will become the most powerfully felt. The relative intensities of pain, then, may resemble the relative importance of that risk to our ancestors (lack of food, too much cold, or serious injuries are felt as agony, whereas minor damage is felt as mere discomfort). This resemblance will not be perfect, however, because natural selection can be a [[Argument from poor design|poor designer]]. The result is often glitches in animals, including [[supernormal stimuli]]. Such glitches help explain pains which are not, or at least no longer directly adaptive (e.g. perhaps some forms of [[toothache]], or injury to fingernails).<ref name=Dawkins2009>{{vcite book | author = Dawkins, Richard |year=2009 | title = The Greatest Show on Earth |publisher = Free Press | Pages = 392-395}}</ref>

[[Idiopathic]] pain (pain that persists after the trauma or pathology has healed, or that arises without any apparent cause), may be an exception to the idea that pain is helpful to survival, although some [[psychodynamic]] psychologists argue that such pain is psychogenic, enlisted as a protective distraction to keep dangerous emotions unconscious.<ref name="Sarno-DividedMind">{{vcite book | author = Sarno JE | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The divided mind: the epidemic of mindbody disorders | edition = | publisher = ReganBooks | location = New York | year = 2006 | pages = | isbn = 0-06-085178-3 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref>

===Thresholds===
In pain science, thresholds are measured by gradually increasing the intensity of a stimulus such as electric current or heat applied to the body. The [[Threshold of pain|pain perception threshold]] is the point at which the stimulus begins to hurt, and the [[pain tolerance|pain tolerance threshold]] is reached when the subject acts to stop the pain.

Differences in pain perception and tolerance thresholds are associated with, among other factors, ethnicity, genetics, and sex. People of Mediterranean origin report as painful some radiant heat intensities that northern Europeans describe as nonpainful, and Italian women tolerate less intense electric shock than Jewish or Native American women. Some individuals in all cultures have significantly higher than normal pain perception and tolerance thresholds. For instance, patients who experience painless heart attacks have higher pain thresholds for electric shock, muscle cramp and heat.<ref name=Melzack_Wall_1996>{{vcite book | author = [[Ronald Melzack|Melzack R]], [[Patrick David Wall|Wall PD]] | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The challenge of pain | edition = 2nd | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 1996 | pages = 17–19 | isbn = 0-14-025670-9 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref> Women have lower pain perception and tolerance thresholds than men, and this sex difference appears to apply to all ages{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}, including newborn infants.<ref name="pmid10692611">{{vcite journal | author = Guinsburg R, de Araújo Peres C, Branco de Almeida MF, de Cássia Xavier Balda R, Cássia Berenguel R, Tonelotto J, Kopelman BI | title = Differences in pain expression between male and female newborn infants | journal = Pain | volume = 85 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 127–33 | year = 2000 | month = March | pmid = 10692611 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00258-4 | url = | issn = }}</ref>

(1968). ''Nursing practice theories related to cognition, bodily pain, and man-environment interactions''. LosAngeles: UCLA Students Store.<br/>More recently, McCaffery defined pain as "whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever the experiencing person says it does." {{vcite book | author = Pasero C, McCaffery M | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Pain: clinical manual | edition = | publisher = Mosby | location = St. Louis | year = 1999 | pages = | isbn = 0-8151-5609-X | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref> To assess intensity, the patient may be asked to locate their pain on a scale of 0&nbsp;to&nbsp;10, with 0 being no pain at all, and 10 the worst pain they have ever felt.

===Multidimensional pain inventory===
The Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) is a questionnaire designed to assess the [[psychosocial]] state of a person with chronic pain. Analysis of MPI results by Turk and Rudy (1988) found three classes of chronic pain patient: "(a) dysfunctional, people who perceived the severity of their pain to be high, reported that pain interfered with much of their lives, reported a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain, and reported low levels of activity; (b) interpersonally distressed, people with a common perception that significant others were not very supportive of their pain problems; and (c) adaptive copers, patients who reported high levels of social support, relatively low levels of pain and perceived interference, and relatively high levels of activity."<ref name= Turk&Rudy1988>{{vcite journal | author = Turk DC, Rudy TE | title = Toward an empirically derived taxonomy of chronic pain patients: integration of psychological assessment data | journal = J.

===In nonverbal patients===
{{See also|Pain and dementia|Pain in babies}}
When a person is [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] and cannot self-report pain, observation becomes critical, and specific behaviors can be monitored as pain indicators. Behaviors such as facial grimacing and guarding indicate pain, as well as an increase or decrease in vocalizations, changes in routine behavior patterns and mental status changes. Patients experiencing pain may exhibit withdrawn [[social behavior]] and possibly experience a [[Anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]] and decreased nutritional intake. A change in condition that deviates from baseline such as moaning with movement or when manipulating a body part, and limited [[range of motion]] are also potential pain indicators. In patients who possess language but are incapable of expressing themselves effectively, such as those with dementia, an increase in confusion or display of aggressive behaviors or agitation, may signal that discomfort exists, and further assessment is necessary.

[[Pain in babies|Infants feel pain]] but they lack the language needed to report it, so communicate distress by crying. A non-verbal pain assessment should be conducted involving the parents, who will notice changes in the infant not obvious to the health care provider. Pre-term babies are more sensitive to painful stimuli than full term babies.<ref name= Jarvis2004>{{vcite book | author = Jarvis C | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Physical examination & health assessment | edition = | publisher = Elsevier Saunders | location = St. Louis, Mo | year = 2007 | pages = 180–192 | isbn = 1-4160-3243-6 | oclc = | doi = | url =}}</ref>

===Other barriers to reporting===
An aging adult may not respond to pain in the way that a younger person would. Their ability to recognize pain may be blunted by illness or the use of multiple [[prescription drug]]s. Depression may also keep the older adult from reporting they are in pain. The older adult may also quit doing activities they love because it hurts too much. Decline in self-care activities (dressing, grooming, walking, etc.) may also be indicators that the older adult is experiencing pain. The older adult may refrain from reporting pain because they are afraid they will have to have surgery or will be put on a drug they become addicted to. They may not want others to see them as weak, or may feel there is something impolite or shameful in complaining about pain, or they may feel the pain is deserved punishment for past transgressions.<ref>lawhorne, L; Passerini, J (1999). ''Chronic Pain Management in the Long Term Care Setting: Clinical Practice Guidelines.'' Baltimore, Maryland: American Medical Directors Association. pp. 1–27.</ref>

Cultural barriers can also keep a person from telling someone they are in pain. Religious beliefs may prevent the individual from seeking help. They may feel certain pain treatment is against their religion. They may not report pain because they feel it is a sign that death is near. Many people fear the stigma of addiction and avoid pain treatment so as not to be prescribed addicting drugs. Many Asians do not want to lose respect in society by admitting they are in pain and need help, believing the pain should be borne in silence, while other cultures feel they should report pain right away and get immediate relief.<ref name= Jarvis2004/> Gender can also be a factor in reporting pain. [[Gender differences]] are usually the result of social and cultural expectations, with women expected to be emotional and show pain and men stoic, keeping pain to themselves.<ref name= Jarvis2004/>

===As an aid to diagnosis===
Pain is a symptom of many medical conditions. Knowing the time of onset, location, intensity, pattern of occurrence (continuous, intermittent, etc.), exacerbating and relieving factors, and quality (burning, sharp, etc.) of the pain will help the examining physician to accurately diagnose the problem. For example, chest pain described as extreme heaviness may indicate [[myocardial infarction]], while chest pain described as tearing may indicate [[aortic dissection]].<ref name="pmid9786377">{{vcite journal | author = Panju AA, Hemmelgarn BR, Guyatt GH, Simel DL | title = The rational clinical examination.

fMRI brain scanning has been used to measure pain, giving good correlations with self-reported pain.<ref>Towards a Physiology-Based Measure of Pain: Patterns of Human Brain Activity Distinguish Painful from Non-Painful Thermal Stimulation, Brown, Chatterjee, Younger, Mackey, PLos One, September 2011</ref><ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/234450.php</ref><ref>http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2011/september/pain.html</ref><ref>http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/13/us-pain-diagnostic-idUSTRE78C81920110913</ref>

===Hedonic adaptation===
[[Hedonic adaptation]] means that actual long-term suffering due to physical illness is often much lower than expected.<ref>http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/painSufferingAwards.pdf</ref>

===Legal awards for pain and suffering===
One area where assessments of pain are effectively required to be made is in legal awards for [[pain and suffering]]. In the Western world these are typically discretionary awards made by juries and are regarded as difficult to predict, variable and subjective, for instance in the US,<ref>http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v100/n1/87/LR100n1Avraham.pdf</ref> UK,

===Medication===
Acute pain is usually managed with medications such as [[analgesics]] and [[anesthetic]]s. Management of chronic pain, however, is much more difficult and may require the coordinated efforts of a [[pain management]] team, which typically includes [[medical practitioner]]s, [[clinical psychologist]]s, [[physiotherapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[physician assistant]]s, and [[nurse practitioner]]s.<ref>Thienhaus, O; Cole, BE (2002).

Sugar taken orally reduces the total crying time but not the duration of the first cry in newborns undergoing a painful procedure (a single lancing of the heel).

===Psychological===
Individuals with more [[social support]] experience less cancer pain, take less pain medication, report less labor pain and are less likely to use epidural anesthesia during childbirth or suffer from chest pain after coronary artery bypass surgery.<ref>Eisenberger, NI; Lieberman (2005).

Suggestion can significantly affect pain intensity. About 35% of people report marked relief after receiving a [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] injection they believe to have been [[morphine]]. This "[[placebo]]" effect is more pronounced in people who are prone to anxiety, so anxiety reduction may account for some of the effect, but it does not account for all of the effect. Placebos are more effective in intense pain than mild pain; and they produce progressively weaker effects with repeated administration.<ref name=Melzack_Wall_1996_26-28>Melzack, R; Wall, PD (1996).

A 2007 review of 13 studies found evidence for the efficacy of [[hypnosis]] in the reduction of pain in some conditions, though the number of patients enrolled in the studies was low, bringing up issues of power to detect group differences, and most lacked credible controls for placebo and/or expectation. The authors concluded that "although the findings provide support for the general applicability of hypnosis in the treatment of chronic pain, considerably more research will be needed to fully determine the effects of hypnosis for different chronic-pain conditions."<ref name= Elkins2007>{{vcite journal | author = Elkins G, Jensen MP, Jensen DR, Patterson | year = 2007 | title = Hypnotherapy for the management of chronic pain | url = | journal = International journal of clinical and experimental hypnosis | volume = 55 | issue = 3| page = 283 | doi = 10.1080/00207140701338621 | pmid = 17558718 | pmc=2752362}}</ref>

Physical pain is an important political topic in relation to various issues, including [[pain management]] policy, [[drug control]], [[animal rights]] or [[animal welfare]], [[torture]], and [[pain compliance]]. In various contexts, the deliberate infliction of pain in the form of [[corporal punishment]] is used as retribution for an offence, or for the purpose of disciplining or reforming a wrongdoer, or to deter attitudes or behaviour deemed unacceptable. In some cultures, extreme practices such as [[mortification of the flesh]] or painful [[rites of passage]] are highly regarded.

[[Pain (philosophy)|Philosophy of pain]] is a branch of [[philosophy of mind]] that deals essentially with physical pain, especially in connection with such views as [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], [[Type physicalism|identity theory]], and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].

More generally, it is often as a part of pain in the broad sense, i.e. [[suffering]], that physical pain is dealt with in culture, religion, philosophy, or society.

The most reliable method for assessing pain in most humans is by asking a question: a person may report pain that cannot be detected by any known physiological measure. However, like infants (Latin ''infans'' meaning "unable to speak"), animals cannot answer questions about whether they feel pain; thus the defining criterion for pain in humans cannot be applied to them. Philosophers and scientists have responded to this difficulty in a variety of ways.  [[René Descartes]] for example argued that animals lack consciousness and therefore do not experience pain and suffering in the way that humans do.<ref name=nuffield45>Working party of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (2005).

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1297, the word ''pain'' comes from the [[Old French]] ''peine'', in turn from [[Latin]] ''poena'', "punishment, penalty"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpoena poena], Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> (in L.L. also "torment, hardship, suffering") and that from [[Greek language|Greek]] "ποινή" (''poine''), generally "price paid", "penalty", "punishment".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpoinh%2F ποινή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pain pain], Online Etymology Dictionary</ref> It also exists in Frisian as "pine" which in turn is related to the English verb "to pine" which means to long for.
