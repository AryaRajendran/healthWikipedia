The '''pronator teres''' is a [[muscle]] of the [[human body]] (located mainly in the [[forearm]]) that, along with the [[Pronator quadratus|pronator quadratus muscle]], serves to pronate the forearm (turning it so that the palm faces posteriorly when the body is in the anatomical position).

==Etymology==
The word ''pronator'' comes from the Latin ''pronus'', which means “inclined forward or lying face downward”, and has to do with the muscle's action being [[pronation]] of the [[forearm]]. The Latin term ''teres'', which means "round or cylindrical shaped" or "long and round", refers to the shape of the muscle.<ref>http://www.anatomyexpert.com/structure_detail/5561/184/</ref><ref>http://books.google.dk/books?id=96jG5n-vmPcC&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=pronator+teres+latin&source=bl&ots=GBFGZE9o1M&sig=t8se4Ik0b_TgasPVjDXNagSGeLs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1fwlUYGHN8eQswabloGwCw&ved=0CG0Q6AEwEA#v=onepage&q=pronator%20teres%20latin&f=false</ref> The indirect English translation of pronator teres is therefore: cylindrical muscle that pronates (the forearm).

==Structure==

The pronator teres has two heads—humeral and ulnar.

The humeral head, the larger and more superficial, arises from the [[medial supracondylar ridge]] immediately superior to the [[medial epicondyle of the humerus]], and from the [[common flexor tendon]] (which arises from the medial epicondyle).

The ulnar head is a thin fasciculus, which arises from the medial side of the coronoid process of the [[ulna]], and joins the preceding at an acute angle. 

The [[median nerve]] enters the forearm between the two heads of the muscle, and is separated from the [[ulnar artery]] by the ulnar head. 

The muscle passes obliquely across the forearm, and ends in a flat tendon, which is inserted into a rough impression at the middle of the lateral surface of the body of the [[radius]], just distal to the insertion of the [[supinator]]. 

The lateral border of the muscle forms the medial boundary of the triangular hollow known as the [[cubital fossa]], which is situated anterior to the [[elbow]].

==Innervation==

The pronator teres is innervated by the [[median nerve]].

==Action==

Pronator teres pronates the forearm, turning the hand posteriorly. If the elbow is flexed to a right angle, then pronator teres will turn the hand so that the palm faces inferiorly. It is assisted in this action by [[pronator quadratus]].

It also weakly flexes the elbow, or assists in flexion at the elbow when there is strong resistance.

==Variations==

Occasionally, the ulnar head is absent.  Also, additional slips from the medial [[intermuscular septum]], from the [[biceps brachii]], and from the [[brachialis]] occasionally occur.

==Clinical aspects==

[[Pronator teres syndrome]] is one cause of [[wrist]] pain. It is a type of neurogenic pain.
* patients with the pronator teres syndrome have numbness in median nerve distribution with repetitive pronation/supination of the forearm, not flexion and extension of the elbow
* early fatigue of the forearm muscles is seen with repetitive stressful motion, especially pronation
* EMG may show only mildly reduced conduction velocities
* despite their anatomic proximity, patients with pronator teres syndrome do not have a higher incidence of AIN syndrome;
* other sites of compression:
** ligament of Struthers
** lacertus fibrosis
** pronator teres muscle
** proximal arch of the FDS
** rare causes such as following tendon transfers for radial palsy
* dissimilarity to CTS:
** positive Tinel's in forearm rather than at wrist
** negative phalen's test
** dysesthesia of palmar triangle
** pain on resistance to pronation
** pain in forearm on resistance to isolated flexion of the PIP joint of long and ring fingers
