'''Puerperal fever''' or '''childbed fever''', is a bacterial infection contracted by women during [[childbirth]] or [[miscarriage]]. It can develop into '''puerperal sepsis''', which is a serious form of [[septicaemia]].  If untreated, it is often fatal.

=="The Doctor's Plague"==
From the 1600s through the mid to late 1800s, the majority of childbed fever cases were caused by the doctors themselves. With no knowledge of [[Microorganism|germs]], doctors did not believe hand washing was needed. Statements like that of Dr. Charles Meigs, a leading [[obstetrician]] and teacher from [[Philadelphia]], were the attitude of the time: “Doctors are gentlemen, and gentlemen’s hands are clean.”<ref>{{cite book | title=Lying-in: a history of childbirth in America | publisher=Yale University Press | first1=Richard W. |last1=Wertz| first2=Dorothy C. |last2=Wertz | year=1989 | pages=122}}</ref> In the 1800s Dr. [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of childbed fever than those giving birth in the doctor's [[maternity ward]].  His investigation discovered that washing hands with an [[antiseptic]] solution before a delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities by 90%.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.med.mcgill.ca/mjm/issues/v01n01/fever.html | title=The Childbed Fever Mystery and the Meaning of Medical Journalism | last=Caplan| first=Caralee E. | journal=McGill Journal of Medicine | year=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1}}</ref> Publication of his findings was not well received by the medical fraternity. The idea conflicted with both the existing medical concepts and more importantly, with the image that doctors had of themselves.  That intransigence consigned large numbers of  mothers to painful, lingering deaths.<ref name="Semmelweis ">{{cite journal | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081013160051/http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/semmelweis.htm | title=Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, the prophet of bacteriology | last1=Hanninen |first1=O|last2=Farago |first2=M| last3=Monos |first3=E. | journal=Infect Control. | year=1983 | month=Sep-Oct; | volume=4 | issue=5 | pages=367–70 | pmid=6354955}}</ref> The scorn and ridicule of doctors was so extreme that Semmelweis moved from Vienna and was eventually committed to a mental asylum where he died.<ref name="childbed fever">{{cite journal | url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/177_11_021202/dec10354_fm.html | title="The contagiousness of childbed fever": a short history of puerperal sepsis and its treatment | first=Caroline M |last=De Costa | journal=The Medical Journal of Australia | year=2002 | month=(11/12) | volume=177 | pages=668–671 | pmid=12463995 | issue=11–12}}</ref>

Dr. Semmelweis  was not the only doctor ignored after sounding a warning about this issue: in ''Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever'' (1795), ex-naval surgeon and [[Aberdonian]] accoucheur Dr. Alexander Gordon warned that the disease was transmitted from one case to another by midwives and doctors.  Dr. Gordon wrote, "It is a disagreeable declaration for me to mention, that I myself was the means of carrying the infection to a great number of women."<ref name="Dr Alexander Gordon">{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080720005441/http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/images/ignaz-semmelweis.html | title=Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever | publisher=www.general-anaesthesia.com | work=Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever | date=1795, 2004 | accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>

==Victims==
[[Elizabeth of York]], the mother of [[Henry VIII of England]], died of puerperal fever one week after giving birth to a daughter. Other significant victims include author [[Jean Webster]], English queens [[Jane Seymour]] and [[ Katherine Parr]] (both wives of Henry VIII), housekeeping authority [[Isabella Beeton]], and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], author of ''[[Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' and mother of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' author [[Mary Shelley]]. Suzanne Barnard, mother of philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], contracted childbed fever after giving birth to him, and died nine days later. Her infant son was also in perilous health following the delivery; the adult Rousseau later wrote that "I came into the world with so few signs of life that little hope was entertained of preserving me". He was nursed back to health by an aunt.<ref>Quoted from Will Durant's "The Age of Rousseau".{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> African-American poet [[Phillis Wheatley]] (1753-84) died of puerperal fever.

==Modern overview==
The most common infection causing puerperal fever is genital tract [[sepsis]] caused by contaminated medical equipment or unhygienic medical staff who contaminate the mother's genital tract during the delivery. Other types of infection that can lead to [[sepsis]] after childbirth include [[urinary tract infection]], breast infection ([[mastitis]]) and respiratory tract infection (more common after [[anaesthesia]] due to lesions in the trachea).

Puerperal fever is now rare in the West due to improved [[hygiene]] during delivery, and the few infections that do occur are usually treatable with [[antibiotic]]s.

==Terminology==
Puerperal fever  (from the Latin ''puer'', ''male child (boy)''), is no longer favored as a diagnostic category. Instead, contemporary terminology specifies:<ref>Carter (2005):98</ref>
# the specific target of infection: [[endometritis]] (inflammation of the inner lining of the uterus), [[metrophlebitis]] (inflammation of the veins of the uterus), and [[peritonitis]] (inflammation of the membrane lining of the abdomen)
# the severity of the infection: less serious [[infection]] (contained multiplication of microbes) or possibly life-threatening [[sepsis]] (uncontrolled and uncontained multiplication of microbes throughout the blood stream).

==Causal organisms==
[[Endometritis]] is a polymicrobial infection.  It frequently includes organisms such as [[Ureaplasma]], [[Streptococcus]], [[Mycoplasma]], and [[Bacteroides]], and may also include organisms such as [[Gardnerella]], [[Chlamydia]], [[Lactobacillus]], [[Escherichia]], and [[Staphylococcus]]<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/1990/04000/bacteriologic_findings_of_post_cesarean.12.aspx | title=Bacteriologic Findings of Post-Cesarian Endometritis in Adolescents | first=AB |last=Berenson | journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology | year=1990 | month=(4/12) | volume=75 | pages=627-629 | pmid=2314783  | issue=4}}</ref>.

== History ==
[[Image:Yearly mortality rates 1784-1849.png|thumb|right|300px|In his 1861 book, [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] presented evidence to demonstrate that the advent of [[pathological anatomy]] in Vienna in 1823 (vertical line) was correlated to the incidence of fatal childbed fever there. Onset of chlorine handwash in 1847 marked by vertical line. Rates for Dublin maternity hospital, which had no pathological anatomy, is shown for comparison ([[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1784-1849|view rates]]). His efforts were futile, however.]]
Hospitals for childbirth became common in the 17th century in many European cities. These "lying-in" hospitals were established at a time when there was no knowledge of [[antisepsis]] or [[epidemiology]], and patients were subjected to crowding, frequent vaginal examinations, and the use of contaminated instruments, dressings, and bedding. It was common for a doctor to deliver one baby after another, without washing his hands or changing clothes in between.

The first recorded epidemic of puerperal fever occurred at the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris]] in 1646. Hospitals throughout Europe and America consistently reported death rates between 20% to 25% of all women giving birth, punctuated by intermittent epidemics with up to 100% fatalities of women giving birth in childbirth wards.<ref>Loudon I. Deaths in childbed from the eighteenth century to 1935. Med History 1986; 30: 1-41</ref> 

A number of physicians began to suspect contagion and hygiene as causal factors in spreading puerperal fever. In 1795, Alexander Gordon of Aberdeen, Scotland suggested that the fevers were infectious processes, that physicians were the carrier, and that "I myself was the means of carrying the infection to a great number of women.”<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/1.html Oliver Wendell Homes: ''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever'' paragraph 16]</ref> Thomas Watson, Professor of Medicine at King's College Hospital, London, wrote  in 1842: "Wherever puerperal fever is rife, or when a practitioner has attended any one instance of it, he should use most diligent [[Hygiene|ablution]]." Watson recommended [[handwashing]] with [[chlorine]] solution and changes of clothing for obstetric attendants "to prevent the practitioner becoming a vehicle of contagion and death between one patient and another." <ref>[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/177_11_021202/dec10354_fm.html#i1067496 ''The Medical Journal of Australia.''"The contagiousness of childbed fever: a short history of puerperal sepsis and its treatment"]</ref>

==Prevention via hygienic measures==

In 1843, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] published ''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever''<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holmes, O.W.|title=On the contagiousness of puerperal fever |journal=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine. |volume=i |pages=503–30 |year=1842–3}} in Richard Gordon. (1983), Great Medical Disasters. p.147 (see also p.43 for selected quote).</ref> and controversially concluded that puerperal fever was frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses; he suggested that clean clothing and avoidance of autopsies by those aiding birth would prevent the spread of puerperal fever.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/1.html Oliver Wendell Holmes: ''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever'']</ref> Holmes quoted Dr. James Blundell as stating, "... in my own family, I had rather that those I esteemed the most should be delivered unaided, in a stable, by the mangerside, than that they should receive the best help, in the fairest apartment, but exposed to the vapors of this pitiless disease."<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/1.html Oliver Wendell Holmes: ''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever'']</ref>
[[File:DBP 1956 244 Semmelweis.jpg|thumb|180px|Ignaz Semmelweis, discoverer of the cause of puerperal fever]]
Holmes' conclusions were ridiculed by many contemporaries, including [[Charles Delucena Meigs]], a well-known obstetrician, who stated, "Doctors are gentlemen, and gentlemen's hands are clean."<ref name="wertz">Wertz RM, Wertz DC.

In 1844, [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] was appointed assistant lecturer in the First Obstetric Division of the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (Allgemeines Krankenhaus), where medical students received their training. Working without knowledge of Holmes' essay, Semmelweis noticed his ward’s 16% mortality rate from fever was substantially higher than the 2% mortality rate in the Second Division, where midwifery students were trained. Semmelweis also noticed that puerperal fever was rare in women who gave birth before arriving at the hospital. Semmelweis noted that doctors in First Division performed autopsies each morning on women who had died the previous day, but the midwives were not required or allowed to perform such autopsies. He made the connection between the autopsies and puerperal fever after a colleague, [[Jakob Kolletschka]], died of septicaemia after accidentally cutting his hand while performing an autopsy.

Semmelweis began experimenting with various cleansing agents and, from May 1847, ordered all doctors and students working in the First Division wash their hands in chlorinated lime solution before starting ward work, and later before each vaginal examination. The mortality rate from puerperal fever in the division fell from 18% in May 1847 to less than 3% in June–November of the same year.<ref name="raju">{{cite journal |last=Raju |first=T.

==Incidence==
The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of puerperal sepsis shows wide variations among published literature — this may be related to different definition, recording etc.<ref name="gfmer.ch"/>

Today in the United States, '''puerperal infection''' is believed to occur in between one and 8 percent of all deliveries.  About three die from puerperal sepsis for every 100,000 deliveries. The single most important risk factor is [[Caesarean section]].<ref>{{cite book

The incidence of '''[[maternal death]]s''' in the United States is 13 in 100,000.

'''Puerperal fever''' or childbed fever in the 18th and 19th centuries affected, on average, six to 9 women in every 1,000 deliveries, killing two to three of them with peritonitis or septicemia. It was the single most common cause of maternal mortality, accounting for about half of all deaths related to childbirth, and was second only to tuberculosis in killing women of childbearing age.  A rough estimate is that about 250,000–500,000 died from puerperal fever in the 18th and 19th centuries in England and Wales alone.<ref>{{cite book

==Etiology and risk factors==
Causes (listed in order of decreasing frequency) include endometritis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia\atlectasis, wound infection, and septic pelvic thrombophlebitis. Septic risk factors for each etiologic condition are listed in order of the postpartum day(PPD) on which the condition generally occurs.
* PPD 0: atelectasis risk factors include general anesthesia, cigarette smoking, and obstructive lung disease.
* PPD 1-2: urinary tract infections risk factors include multiple catheterization during labor, multiple vaginal examinations during labor, and untreated bacteriuria.
* PPD 2-3: endometritis ( the most common cause ) risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and multiple vaginal examinations during labor.
* PPD 4-5: wound infection risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and multiple vaginal examination during labor.
* PPD 5-6: septic pelvic thrombophlebitis risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and diffuse difficult vaginal delivery.
* PPD 7-21: mastitis risk factors include nipple trauma from breastfeeding.

==Clinical findings and management==
[[Atelectasis]]: mild to moderate fever, no changes or mild rales on chest auscultation.
'''Management''': pulmonary exercises, ambulation.

[[Urinary tract infection]] : high fever, malaise, costovertebral tenderness, positive urine culture.
'''Management''': antibiotics as per culture sensitivity (cephalosporine 1-2 g parentral q6hr).

[[Endometritis]]: moderate fever, exquisite uterine tenderness, minimal abdominal findings.
'''Management''': multiple agent IV antibiotics to cover polymicrobial organisms: (clindamycin 900&nbsp;mg q8hr, gentamicin 500&nbsp;mg everyday, addition of ampicillin 1–2 g IV q6hr if no response, no cultures are necessary.

[[Wound infection]]: persistent spiking fever despite antibiotics, wound erythema or flactuance, wound drainage.
'''Management''': antibiotics for cellulitis, open and drain wound, saline-soaked packing twice a day, secondary closure.

[[Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis]]: persistent wide fever swings despite antibiotics, usually normal abdominal or pelvic exams.
'''Management''': IV heparin for 7–10 days at rates sufficient to prolong the PTT to double the baseline values.

[[Mastitis]]: unilateral, localized erythema, edema, tenderness.
'''Management''': antibiotics for cellulitis, open and drain abscess if present.
